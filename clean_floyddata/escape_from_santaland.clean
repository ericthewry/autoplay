 First time players may wish to type ABOUT before getting underway.


 Riverview Mall
 Ugh. Christmastime at the mall. The last place you want to be, during
 the worst time of year to be there.

 After a last-minute Christmas Eve shopping run (thank you Aunt Maxine
 and Uncle Felix, who RSVP'd for tomorrow just an hour before the mall
 closed) you're heading for the parking lot, shopping bags in hand.

 Everything about this place gives you a headache: the fluorescent
 lights reflecting off the polished faux-marble flooring, the greasy
 funk of the food court, the echoes of screaming children and Christmas
 music piped through tinny speakers. You have got to get out of here.

 But, where did you park? All of these mall entrances look the same. Are
 you going the right way? This doesn't look familiar...

 The cartoony plastic signpost in front of you has two arrows, both of
 which point east toward a fake-snowy astroturf pathway between
 fake-holly hedges. One arrow reads "Pictures With Santa" the other
 reads "Parking Lots A-G".

 The Christmas puzzle has been a tradition in my family since my brother
 and I were very young.

 At first, it was a way to extend the Christmas morning festivities
 during the years when there wasn't a lot of money for presents. My
 father would create a puzzle for each gifts tag -- usually a rebus --
 and my brother and I would have to solve the puzzle and guess at the
 package's contents before we could open it.

 As we grew up, the puzzles became more and more challenging. Plus, my
 brother and I wanted in on the action: we started to create puzzle tags
 for my father. Gifts would sometimes remain unopened for hours before
 the recipient had the breakthrough (or begged for the hint) that would
 solve the puzzle. We laughed a lot and we celebrated each other's
 creativity in both puzzle making and puzzle solving.

 But my brother and I grew up and started out own lives. Years passed
 and the old Christmas traditions changed, as they must.

 And yet sometimes, the old traditions are the best ones.

 This holiday puzzle is dedicated to my father.

 *** Merry Christmas ***

 Riverview Mall
 Everything about this place gives you a headache: the fluorescent
 lights reflecting off the polished faux-marble flooring, the greasy
 funk of the food court, the echoes of screaming children and Christmas
 music piped through tinny speakers. You have got to get out of here.

 The cartoony plastic signpost in front of you has two arrows, both of
 which point east toward a fake-snowy astroturf pathway between
 fake-holly hedges. One arrow reads "Pictures With Santa" the other
 reads "Parking Lots A-G".

>view river
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine me
 You are a little harried and headachy from this last minute trip to the
 mall, but you've bought the last of the gifts and you're ready to head
 home.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a scented candle (closed)
   an impenetrable super-plastic package (inside which is a flashlight)
   a Hickory Farms gift box (closed)
   your coat

>examine candle
 For the mere price of $24.99 you became the owner of twenty-two ounces
 of white wax in a glass jar. How does the Yankee Candle Company get
 away with it? Plus, is the name "Winter Wonderland" meant to describe
 the scent? What does that even mean?

>smell candle
 You can't smell much with the lid clamped shut. Mercifully.

>open candle
 You open the scented candle and immediately it begins making your eyes
 water with its piney, musky reek.

>smell candle
 "Winter Wonderland": the crispness of a damp pine forest mixed with the
 musky reek of a damp moose. Delightful. And imagine: somebody gets paid
 to design fragrances like this.

>close candle
 You close the scented candle and the fir-tree-plus-wet-fur funk
 gradually begins to dissipate.

>examine flashlight
 The Brookstone waterproof, shock-resistant flashlight, encased in a
 shell of nearly-impenetrable super-plastic packaging. It was a steal at
 $44.99, and when you saw the price you actually considered stealing it
 -- especially since you'll have to buy the not-included pair of AA
 batteries separately.

 While there in Brookstone you toyed for a minute with the idea of
 getting the combined flashlight and self-massager, but then you
 considered your audience. Aunt Maxine would not find it anywhere near
 as funny as you do.

>examine gift
 The Hickory Farms Sausage and Cheese gift box is $35.99 worth of
 artery-clogging goodness. "A great combo of rich and savory flavors,"
 the box claims. Uncle Felix is sure to love it.

>xyzzy
 No Easter eggs here. This is a Christmas game.

>xyzzy
 No Easter eggs here. This is a Christmas game.

>ho ho ho
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine lights
 Standard mall-issue lighting. It makes you want to get the heck out of
 here.

>listen
 A dim echo of some annoying Christmas tune. It sounds a bit like
 "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"?

>smell
 You catch a faint odor of food court.

>listen
 A dim echo of some annoying Christmas tune. Maybe "Mary's Boy Child"?

>smell gift box
 From the Hickory Farms gift box you smell nothing.

>smell me
 As inoffensive as ever.

>examine hedges
 The "hedges" are about ten feet high and covered in waxy, plastic holly
 leaves.

>search hedges
 The leaves are fake, but dense. You find nothing else inside the hedge.

>count leaves
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>go east
 You proceed down the narrow hallway of synthetic hedges: away from the
 mall, deeper into Santaland.

 Entrance to Santaland
 Something about the 10-foot tall hedges and the squishy, padded
 astroturf under your feet transports you away from the
 migraine-inducing chaos of the mall. But now the narrow pathways and
 tall hedges make you feel antsy and claustrophobic.

 From here, pathways lead to the north, the east, and the west.

 (Note: The right-hand side of the status bar displays a compass rose of
 possible locations to travel. Locations you have not yet visited are
 shown in red.)

>examine w
 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>examine n
 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>examine e

>go west
 That way takes you back into the mall. Surely the parking lot can't be
 far.

 Copper Panel
 This corner of Santaland would be indistinguishable from the
 neighboring passages were it not for an unexpected feature.

 Mounted in the fake hedge-wall you see a glinting copper panel.

>examine panel
 The upper part of the shiny panel frames a thin, horizontal window of
 glass. Beneath the window is a dial. A word, written in fancy
 calligraphy, is visible in the window: "Blitzen".

 Somewhere in Santaland
 You are at the intersection of several narrow, snowy passages.

 From here, pathways lead to the south (back toward the entrance to
 Santaland), the north (back to the room with the copper panel), and the
 east.

 Santa's Workshop
 This must be one of the highlights of Santaland. When it's powered up,
 that is.

 A small army of animatronic elves stands immobile amidst an array of
 silent toy producing machines. Dressed in festive red and green aprons,
 clenching mallets and bellows and hand-powered drills, they are Santa's
 sweatshop workforce (although you wonder how much sweating one does at
 the North Pole, and then remind yourself that these are animatronic
 elves who wouldn't sweat anyhow, and besides even if they could sweat
 they're just standing there not moving or anything at the moment).

 A string of Christmas lights extends from a power outlet in the hedge
 wall, trails across the floor of the workshop, and disappears into the
 cluster of machines.

 Off to the side, a lone robotic elf stands at a tall desk working
 busily, unlike his peers.

>examine lights
 The lights stretch from a power outlet in the hedge wall, across the
 floor, and into the cluster of animatronics. Despite being plugged in
 and having bulbs in all of its sockets, the string of Christmas lights
 is completely unlit. Typical. When one goes out they all go out.

 In the string of Christmas lights are five twinkle lights (orange,
 purple, white, red, and blue).

>take lights
 You tug on the string of Christmas lights, but meet resistance from the
 end that is tucked up among the automatons. It seems it's attached
 somehow. (If you wanted to take an individual light bulb, though, you
 could.)

>take bulb
 Which do you mean, the yellow twinkle light, the green twinkle light,
 the orange twinkle light, the purple twinkle light, the white twinkle
 light, the red twinkle light, or the blue twinkle light?

>take all

>examine elf
 This fellow must be on a different circuit than the others.
 Representing the toy factory's bookkeeper, he stands on a chair behind
 the tall desk and scribbles notes into a thick ledger. On top of the
 desk are a little ink bottle, into which the bookkeeper occasionally
 dips his quill pen, and an electric candle that has no light bulb.

>read notes
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine bottle
 A little prop jar that has dried ink running down the side. The jar
 itself is empty so nothing actually happens when the elf dips his pen
 in it.

>examine pen
 A long feather that the robot elf uses as he pretends to write notes in
 the ledger.

>examine candle
 The electric candle is attached to the tall desk. It has a little
 socket for a twinkle light where the flame would be.

>put purple bulb in candle
 You put the purple twinkle light into the electric candle. It lights
 up!

>examine candle
 The electric candle is attached to the tall desk. It has a purple
 twinkle light plugged into its socket which twinkles adorably.

>read ledger
 A thick, leather-bound book (actually, a plastic prop made to look like
 a thick, leather-bound book). Some scribbles have been painted on the
 pages, but they are just for show.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   six twinkle lights (blue, red, white, orange, green, and yellow)
   a scented candle (closed)
   an impenetrable super-plastic package (inside which is a flashlight)
   a Hickory Farms gift box (closed)
   your coat

>take purple bulb
 Taken.

>put blue bulb in candle
 You put the blue twinkle light into the electric candle. It lights up!

>take blue bulb

 You put the red twinkle light into the electric candle. The bulb
 remains dark.

 Dropped.

   your coat

>examine coat
 You started feeling dehydrated and headachy almost the moment you
 walked into the mall (a psychosomatic reaction, perhaps), so you took
 off your coat. And here it is.

>search coat
 In the pocket are your keys.

>examine keys
 Just a few keys (car, house) on a simple key ring. Nothing fancy.

>put bulbs in string
 green twinkle light: You put the green twinkle light into the string of
 Christmas lights. Nothing. (Of course that's because there are still
 empty sockets in the string of Christmas lights.

 brilliantly!

 Simultaneously, Santa's workshop clatters to life!

 Santa's Workshop
 A small army of animatronic elves work jerkily amidst an array of
 chugging and clanking toy producing machines. Dressed in festive red
 and green aprons, clenching mallets and bellows and hand-powered
 drills, they are Santa's sweatshop workforce (although you wonder how

 Suddenly, a whistle chirps and one of the toy machines burps a cloud of
 smoke. Something slides down the chute and lands in the basket with a
 muffled clank.

>examine basket
 A simple container at the terminus of the workshop toy chute.

 In the basket is a silver reindeer statue.

>examine statue
 Made of sparkling silver, the figure stands about six inches tall at
 the shoulder. The reindeer's antlers are small, but it has been
 sculpted in a particularly energetic pose, kicking its front legs into
 the air. You can imagine the holly wreath around its neck jostling as
 the animal bounds away.

 This corner of Santaland would be indistinguishable from the

 unexpected than it would have been earlier, though, since you have
 already seen something just like it).

 Flush with the fake hedge-wall, you see a sparkling silver panel.

 The upper part of the shiny panel frames a thin, horizontal window of
 glass. Beneath the window is a dial. A word, written in fancy
 calligraphy, is visible in the window: "Prancer".

>examine machines
 You can't see any such thing.

>go north
 You are about to begin down the pathway to the north, when you see a
 small man walking south down the path toward you. He is looking down,
 watching his curly-toed shoes kick up drifts of styrofoam snow, and for
 a moment he is oblivious to your presence.

 When he finally looks up and notices you, he leaps back with a jolt and
 clutches tightly to the golden statue he is carrying.

 "Who...? Who are you? What are you doing here? Santaland is... It's...
 We're closed!"

>examine man
 The man's ears and nose are slightly pointier than most people's, and
 his limbs seem too long for his four-foot frame. Green tights hug
 skinny legs and knobby knees, then tuck into huge curly-toed shoes. His
 candy cane turtleneck is particularly, well, some might call it
 "festive". (You would call it "ugly").

 Speaking of adjectives, you search for one that could summarize his
 overall appearance. You decide on "elfin".

 He carries a gold statue that looks like a reindeer (or, in any case,
 something with antlers). It's a bit hard to get a good look because he
 keeps moving it nervously out of your line of sight.

>examine statue
 (the silver statue)
 Made of sparkling silver, the figure stands about six inches tall at
 the shoulder. The reindeer's antlers are small, but it has been
 sculpted in a particularly energetic pose, kicking its front legs into
 the air. You can imagine the holly wreath around its neck jostling as
 the animal bounds away.

>examine gold statue
 The statue seems to be made of gold, and it looks a bit like a
 reindeer. Every time you try to get a good look, though, the small man
 twists away and tries to shield the statue from your view.

>talk to man
 The little man is clearly upset by your presence, but you figure it
 couldn't hurt to ask for directions. "Look, I'm just trying to find the
 parking lot."

 "I don't... You can't..." He pauses, staring at you and groping for a
 response. He looks nervously back over his shoulder to the north, then
 jabs a finger of his oversized, green-gloved hand over your shoulder to
 the south. "That way!"

>talk to man
 You look south, in the direction the little man's pointing finger. "Is
 that the way to the parking lot? Or..."

 "Just go that way!" He gestures so emphatically this time that he
 almost drops his golden statue. "Get out of here, would you?"

>talk to man
 "Please GO, would you!?" He jabs his finger to the south.

>talk to man
 "Just GO already!"

>smack man
>take statue
 (the gold statue)
 The elf twists violently away from you and swats at your hand. "No
 way!" he barks. "This one is mine. It's the most valuable of the set
 and I've already got a buyer!"

>GET HIM
 I don't suppose the elf would care for that.

>show silver statue to man
 The little man eyes the silver statue for a moment. "Mine's better," he
 sneers.

>show candle to man
 Something about the little man's twitchy temperament combined with the
 way the he's been clutching at that statue suggests that he's not to be
 trusted with your things. In fact, he looks a little larcenous. Or is
 that lecherous? Leprous? Anyhow: he looks like he wants to steal your
 stuff.

>ask man about statue
 (To communicate in Escape From Santaland, TALK TO a character.)

>talk to man about statue
 I only understood you as far as wanting to talk to the elf.

>look
 Somewhere in Santaland
 You are at the intersection of several snowy, narrow passages.

 From here, pathways lead to the west (back to Santa's workshop), the
 south (back to the room with the silver panel), and the north.

 The little man glowers at you and clutches tightly to the gold statue.

>go north
 You attempt to sidestep the little man and proceed on your quest for
 the parking lot.

 Quick as a whip the elf skitters up to you and starts grabbing at the
 scented candle. As you twist to avoid his hot little hands, he swipes
 your coat!

 "I bet this will be worth a few bucks!" he cries and scampers away to
 the north.

 You can't see any such thing.

 Pictures With Santa
 The heart of Santaland and the destination of families from miles
 around. It's not your destination, of course, but that doesn't change
 the fact that parents and children have for years made pilgrimages to
 this spot to have their pictures taken with Santa Claus.

 You arrive just as the larcenous little elf starts to climb down a
 secret staircase hidden beneath Santa's chair, which is tipped back at
 an awkward angle. When he sees you, the elf yelps and grasps at the
 underside of the trap door in an attempt to tip the chair back onto its
 feet.

 In the process, he fumbles the gold statue, which skitters across the
 astroturf as the trap-door-chair slams shut. With that, the elf and
 your coat (and, unfortunately, your car keys) are gone.

 Santa's big comfy chair stands in the center of the room. It's a
 dramatic affair, a throne really: lots of ostentatious gold-painted
 filigree and red velvet pillows.

 Next to Santa's chair is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. There
 are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the
 colorful decorative tree skirt underneath.

 The gold reindeer statue lies on its side in a pile of fake snow.

>take gold statue
 Taken.

>examine gold statue
 Cast in solid gold, the reindeer figure stands about six inches tall at
 the shoulder. The sculpture is unmistakably of Rudolph the reindeer.
 His nose isn't red (it's gold, like the rest of him), yet the sculptor
 has somehow made it seem to glow. It's also somewhat more bulbous than
 you'd expect to see on a reindeer, which is a bit of a giveaway.

>examine tree
 The tree itself is very attractive, but somehow less impressive than
 the colorful tree skirt spread out beneath it.

>examine skirt
 The nine reindeer have been beautifully rendered by the hand of an
 expert rug maker. The reindeer are not identified (except for Rudolph,
 whose nose gives him away), but they stand in single file between
 Rudolph and Santa's present filled sleigh.

 The four reindeer behind Rudolph are standing on their back legs as
 though ready to leap into the air. The next four have all hooves on the
 ground.

 Alternating pairs of reindeer wear different decorations: the first two
 reindeer behind Rudolph have holly wreaths around their necks. The next
 two wear collars clustered with jingle bells. The third pair again wear
 wreaths. The last two reindeer again wear bells.

 Every other reindeer, starting with the one behind Rudolph, has an
 impressive rack of antlers. The antlers of the other reindeer are
 smaller.

>examine silver statue
 Made of sparkling silver, the figure stands about six inches tall at

 You work the fancy tree skirt out from under the Christmas tree and
 shake off the fake snow and pine needles.

>examine chair
 Santa's chair, the place where untold numbers of children have screamed
 and wet themselves in terror. It's a dramatic piece of furniture with
 lots of gold decoration and red velvet pillows.

 The chair stands on a short, square platform which, as you saw when you
 first entered the room, is actually a trap door that conceals a
 stairway. The platform is marred with a bunch of scuff marks.

>examine pillows
 Up close, Santa's chair looks pretty cheap. You're sure it looks
 impressive in all of those holiday portraits, though.

 The chair doesn't move other than to wobble a bit. As it does, though,
 you hear the rattling of some kind of locking mechanism coming from the
 front of the chair. Beneath it, actually, down by the floor.

>examine floor
 The floor of Santaland is covered with a layer of padded astroturf
 (which, in turn, is heavily dusted with a layer of fake snow).

>examine floor in front of chair
 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the astroturf.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine astroturf
 The floor of Santaland is covered with a layer of padded astroturf
 (which, in turn, is heavily dusted with a layer of fake snow).

>examine snow
 The "snow" appears to be some kind of styrofoam shavings. Whatever it
 is, static electricity has it clinging to your pantlegs.

>examine lock
 You can't see any locking mechanism on the outside of Santa's chair.
 From the noise, it sounds like whatever it is works from the inside,
 under the chair. There must be some other means of unlocking it.
 Something sneaky, you suspect.

>go north

 Reindeer Pen
 Yeeouch. What a smell.

 Whoever thought it was a good idea to have a real, live reindeer living
 in Santaland for a month must have been fired (or should have been,
 based on the state of this place). There's a little rustic barn, a
 trough, and a few synthetic pine trees... and everything is coated with
 some combination of feces, oats, reindeer dander, and fake snow.

 However: mounted in the wall next to the barn glisters a shiny golden
 panel. It's just like the other two you found, but with a little added
 filth.

 The reindeer scratches at the astroturf with his hoof.

>examine gold panel
 The upper part of the shiny panel frames a thin, horizontal window of
 glass. Beneath the window is a dial. A word, written in fancy
 calligraphy, is visible in the window: "Dancer".

>examine reindeer
 (the animal)
 The reindeer's shaggy hair is mostly a dull brown, but lighter around
 its neck. He also has an impressive and, frankly, dangerous-looking
 rack of antlers. Otherwise, he seems a bit bored.

>pet reindeer
 Which do you mean, the animal, the gold reindeer statue, or the silver
 reindeer statue?

>animal
 The reindeer growls when you reach for him. Better to keep your
 distance.

>turn dial
 As you reach for the dial, the reindeer growls at you. He doesn't seem
 to like the idea of your touching the gold panel.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   the fancy tree skirt
   the gold reindeer statue and silver reindeer statue
   a scented candle (closed)
   an impenetrable super-plastic package (inside which is a flashlight)
   a Hickory Farms gift box (closed)

>examine gift box
 The Hickory Farms Sausage and Cheese gift box is $35.99 worth of
 artery-clogging goodness. "A great combo of rich and savory flavors,"
 the box claims. Uncle Felix is sure to love it.

>put skirt on reindeer
 Which do you mean, the animal, the gold reindeer statue, or the silver
 reindeer statue?

>animal
>ride reindeer
 Which do you mean, the animal, the gold reindeer statue, or the silver
 reindeer statue?

>ride animal
 You make like you're about to kick one leg up over the reindeer's back,
 but the squinty, not-on-your-life-buddy look he shoots you makes you
 change your mind in a hurry.

>pet animal
 The reindeer growls when you reach for him. Better to keep your
 distance.

>kick animal
 Have you no conscience? Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>show gold statue to animal
 The reindeer doesn't seem interested.

>show candle to animal
 The reindeer sniffs around the lid of the candle and seems interested.
 At least, he seems a little less bored than usual.

>open candle
 You open the scented candle and immediately it begins making your eyes
 water with its piney, musky reek. Who'd have thought it could smell any
 worse in here?

 It takes a moment for the smell to reach the reindeer, but when he
 finally gets a whiff of "Winter Wonderland" he lets out a snort that
 you somehow interpret as glee. The reindeer eyes you, and your smelly
 candle, with a passionate and unnerving intensity.

>drop candle
 Dropped.

>turn dial
 As you reach for the dial, the reindeer snorts angrily. Despite being
 somewhat more docile when he can smell that hideous candle, he still
 doesn't seem to like the idea of your touching the gold panel.

>take candle
 Taken.

>go south
 Drawn to the piney, musky scent of the candle, the reindeer lopes after
 you!

 Pictures With Santa
 The heart of Santaland and the destination of families from miles
 around. It's not your destination, of course, but that doesn't change
 the fact that parents and children have for years made pilgrimages to
 this spot to have their pictures taken with Santa Claus.

 Santa's big comfy chair stands in the center of the room. It's a
 dramatic affair, a throne really: lots of ostentatious gold-painted
 filigree and red velvet pillows.

 Next to Santa's chair is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. There
 are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the
 colorful decorative tree skirt underneath which was, until recently,
 spread out beneath it.

 The reindeer studies you carefully.

>examine gold statue
 Cast in solid gold, the reindeer figure stands about six inches tall at
 the shoulder. The sculpture is unmistakably of Rudolph the reindeer.
 His nose isn't red (it's gold, like the rest of him), yet the sculptor
 has somehow made it seem to glow. It's also somewhat more bulbous than
 you'd expect to see on a reindeer, which is a bit of a giveaway.

 The nine reindeer have been beautifully rendered by the hand of an
 expert rug maker. The reindeer are not identified (except for Rudolph,
 whose nose gives him away), but they stand in single file between
 Rudolph and Santa's present filled sleigh.

 The four reindeer behind Rudolph are standing on their back legs as
 though ready to leap into the air. The next four have all hooves on the
 ground.

 Alternating pairs of reindeer wear different decorations: the first two
 reindeer behind Rudolph have holly wreaths around their necks. The next
 two wear collars clustered with jingle bells. The third pair again wear
 wreaths. The last two reindeer again wear bells.

 Every other reindeer, starting with the one behind Rudolph, has an
 impressive rack of antlers. The antlers of the other reindeer are
 smaller.

>wear skirt
 Fetching though its holiday colors would undoubtedly be on you, I'm
 afraid it's not that kind of skirt.

 Depot
 Here kids can (beg their parents to) pay an additional $5 to have their
 picture taken aboard the H&O Railroad. In other malls, you recall
 seeing Santaland setups with working trains chugging along through
 their little Santa-scapes, but this one seems much less elaborate.

 In the hedge wall to the south stands the stony arch of a tunnel. From
 the tunnel emerges a narrow set of train tracks. The tracks run north
 across the turf and slip under a closed door in the hedge.

 The facade of a little ticket booth stands next to the tunnel.

 Somewhere in Santaland
 You are at the narrow, snowy intersection of several passages.

 From here, pathways lead to the south (back to Santa's workshop), the
 west (back to the room with the copper panel), and the east (back to
 Santa's chair and its trap door).

 At the base of the hedge, you spot a pink piece of paper half-buried in
 the synthetic snow.

>examine paper
 You pick up the paper and discover that, despite being printed on pink
 paper, it's a rather official-looking letter:

 Dear Jerry,

 As we discussed on Tuesday, recent economic conditions have caused us
 to eliminate several positions at the workshop. Regretfully, although
 your toy-crafting has always been of the highest caliber, we were
 forced to downsize your position.

 Accordingly, your employment will be terminated on December 22nd. Your
 medical insurance plan will also be discontinued at that time.
 Unfortunately, given our dire financial straits, we will be unable to
 offer any severance package.

 I am happy to provide you a letter of reference, however, if you so
 request.

 Sincerely,
 S. Nicholas

 The facade of a little ticket booth stands next to the tunnel.

>examine booth
 The facade is just a prop attached to the holly hedge. There's a little
 fake ticket window with a sign hanging on the inside that reads "Back
 soon!" The H&O Railroad logo is painted on the wall of the booth next
 to the window, and under that there is a train schedule posted.

>examine schedule
 The schedule simply reads: North Pole trains depart regularly.

>examine tracks
 The train tracks run north and south, cutting about ten feet across the
 astroturf. To the north, they disappear under an wooden door with a
 fluted glass doorknob. To the south, they lead into the tunnel.

>examine tunnel
 The fake-stone surround of the tunnel is made from something like
 styrofoam or papier-mâché. It is set in the hedge wall to the south and
 a narrow set of train tracks runs north out of it.

>examine door
 A wooden door with a fluted glass doorknob. It seems very out of place
 in the middle of a hedge (even a fake hedge). The train tracks
 disappear under it.

 You've worked your way pretty deep into the tunnel and it is really too

 The reindeer seems to be trying to stick his nose into the scented
 candle.

>rub candle on flashlight
 I only understood you as far as wanting to rub the scented candle.

>rub candle
 You'll have time to clean it up when you get home.

>take candle
 You pick up the candle and discover that it is slick with reindeer

 After a moment's pause, you decide that you can still give the

 hope Aunt Maxine doesn't want to return it) and saw your way through
 the not-so-impenetrable-after-all plastic with the serrated knife.

>turn on flashlight

 Nothing happens, most probably because there are no batteries in the

 You open the scented candle and immediately it begins stinking up the
 place with its piney, musky reek.

 Again: It takes a moment for the smell to reach the reindeer, but when

 Elves' Break Room
 This was the break room for the Santaland elves (meaning: the human
 teenagers who worked here in Santaland during their winter breaks from
 school). Once, this might have been an okay place to hang out with your
 fellow slackers and talk about how lame all of this Santaland junk is,
 but now the room has been trashed, even by teenage slacker standards.

 All of the drawers in the rickety desk have been dumped out onto the
 floor. Everything has been swept off the short rack of shelves: a
 scattering of magazines, a potted plant, a whole bunch of cup-o-noodle
 instant lunches. A can of ground coffee was opened, dug through, and
 dropped.

 Hmm. Coffee, but no coffee pot. Instant noodles, but no microwave. A TV
 remote control but no TV. It seems that all of the appliances have,
 shall we say, walked off. Wonder who might be responsible for that...

 In the wall to the west is the door back into Santaland.

>examine remote
 The remote control for the TV that was stolen from the break room.

>open remote
 (first taking the TV remote control)
 You snap open the battery compartment on the TV remote control, remove
 the pair of AA batteries, and click the compartment closed.

 Tunnel
 The plaster cave, you are somewhat disappointed to note (now that
 you've got a light in here), is just a dead end. The narrow train
 tracks terminate here and lead north out of the tunnel.

 A cartoony, brightly-colored locomotive sits on the tracks. It is large
 enough for two kids (or perhaps one adult) to sit on.

 On the ground behind the locomotive sits a small electric generator.

>examine locomotive
 The locomotive is a rideable kid-sized version, which means you can
 mount the train (and, once you are on the thing, dismount it).

>mount train
 You mount the locomotive. You're a bit bigger than the usual clientele,
 but you manage to find a comfortable-enough way to straddle it.

>go north
 The train chugs toward the quaint wooden door. Just as collision seems
 inevitable, the door pops open and the train plows headlong not into
 the mall, as you would have expected, but into a long dark corridor.

 The train continues through the disorienting darkness for some time,
 then suddenly emerges (you're not quite sure how) into startling
 territory.

 Snowy Landscape (on the locomotive)
 You find yourself in the middle of a grove of pine trees with the full
 expanse of the night sky opening above you. A full moon shines down and
 sparkles off the fluffy foot of snow coating the landscape, and the fat
 flakes that continue to fall lazily.

 A red and white striped signpost juts out of the snow bearing a
 snow-flecked sign.

 Nearby stands a small building.

>examine signpost
 The sign, in a sort of chunky, old-timey lettering reads: NORTH POLE.

>examine building
 The charming cabin seems to hunch itself contentedly in the snow,
 nesting like some furry arctic animal. It has a steep, shingled roof
 and dark wooden siding which frames a door and a window. Smoke drifts
 from the chimney. Icicles hang from the eaves.

>open door
 You climb off the locomotive and approach the workshop door.

 You are, by this point in your evening, less than totally surprised to
 find that the door to the little cabin is locked.

>examine snow
 A thick coating of snow covers the landscape as far as you can see, and
 sparkling white flakes catch the moonlight as they drift lazily down.

>search snow
 You find nothing of interest.

>unlock door
 Nothing you have would seem to be a candidate for unlocking this door.

>knock
 What do you want to knock on?

>knock on door
>examine door
 The cabin door is nothing particularly interesting. Very practical and
 tight-fitting.

>examine window
 The simple four-pane window has thick glass. Through it you can see the
 inside of the cabin.

>open window
 The window is tightly fitted into its frame to protect against the
 weather. You can't open it from out here.

>break window
 Yes, you're starting to get desperate, but vandalism? You'd be getting
 coal in your stocking until you're in a home.

>look through window
 You peer through the window into the cabin and see a cozy sort of den.
 To the left of the window, an overstuffed armchair stands by a
 crackling fireplace. To the right, there is a large work table with
 papers scattered across it. On the table stands a reindeer statue made
 of what appears to be copper.

>examine statue
 Which do you mean, the gold reindeer statue, the silver reindeer
 statue, or the copper reindeer statue?

>examine copper statue
 Crafted of shiny copper, the reindeer (like the other statues) is about
 six inches tall at the shoulder. You can practically hear the jingle
 bells on the reindeer's collar as it begins a jump into the air. The
 poised muscles of the leaping stag are as carefully sculpted as the
 elaborate antlers.

>examine skirt
 The nine reindeer have been beautifully rendered by the hand of an
 expert rug maker. The reindeer are not identified (except for Rudolph,
 whose nose gives him away), but they stand in single file between

 Yes, you came from the south, but now the train tracks stretch on for
 what seems like miles in that direction. Surely you can't make it on
 foot (especially without your coat).

>mount train
 You mount the locomotive.

>go south
 As the locomotive starts along the track, a sudden gust of wind whips
 up a white wall of snow. A moment later you find yourself back in the
 mall, a shower of styrofoam shavings drifting to the floor around you.

 dramatic affair, a throne really: lots of ostentatious gold-painted
 filigree and red velvet pillows.

 Next to Santa's chair is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. There
 are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the
 colorful decorative tree skirt underneath which was, until recently,
 spread out beneath it.

>go west

 Somewhere in Santaland
 You are at the narrow, snowy intersection of several passages.

 From here, pathways lead to the south (back to Santa's workshop), the
 west (back to the room with the copper panel), and the east (back to
 Santa's chair and its trap door).

>go west

 Copper Panel
 This corner of Santaland would be indistinguishable from the
 neighboring passages were it not for an unexpected feature (less
 unexpected than it would have been earlier, though, since you have
 already seen something just like it).

 Mounted in the fake hedge-wall you see a glinting copper panel.

>turn dial
 You turn the dial and the word "Dasher" appears in the window.

>again
 You turn the dial and the word "Dancer" appears in the window.

>again
 You turn the dial and the word "Prancer" appears in the window.

>go south

 Santa's Workshop
 A small army of animatronic elves work jerkily amidst an array of
 chugging and clanking toy producing machines. Dressed in festive red
 and green aprons, clenching mallets and bellows and hand-powered
 drills, they are Santa's sweatshop workforce (although you wonder how
 much sweating one does at the North Pole, and then remind yourself that
 these are animatronic elves who wouldn't sweat anyhow).

 A string of Christmas lights extends from a power outlet in the hedge
 wall, trails across the floor of the workshop, and disappears into the
 cluster of machines.

 Off to the side, a lone robotic elf stands at a tall desk working
 busily.

 You can also see a red twinkle light here.

>go south

 Somewhere in Santaland
 You are at the snowy intersection of several narrow passages.

 From here, pathways lead to the north (back to Santa's workshop), the
 west (back toward the entrance to Santaland), and the east (back to the
 room with the silver panel).

>go east

 Silver Panel
 This corner of Santaland would be indistinguishable from the
 neighboring passages were it not for an unexpected feature (less
 unexpected than it would have been earlier, though, since you have
 already seen something just like it).

 Flush with the fake hedge-wall, you see a sparkling silver panel.

>turn dial
 You turn the dial and the word "Comet" appears in the window.

>again
 You turn the dial and the word "Cupid" appears in the window.

>again
 You turn the dial and the word "Donner" appears in the window.

 You turn the dial and the word "Dancer" appears in the window.

 Faintly, a little chime plays somewhere to the north. It's over before
 you can really catch it, but it was either "Ha-a-a-le-lu-jah!" from
 Handel's Messiah or "Fi-i-i-ve Go-o-o-ld Rings", you can't be sure.
 Anyhow, you take it as a good sign.

 Entrance to Santaland
 Something about the 10-foot tall hedges and the squishy, padded
 astroturf under your feet has transported you away from the
 migraine-inducing chaos of the mall. But now the narrow pathways and
 tall hedges make you feel antsy and claustrophobic.

 From here, pathways lead to the north, the east, and the west.

 Pictures With Santa
 The heart of Santaland and the destination of families from miles
 around. It's not your destination, of course, but that doesn't change
 the fact that parents and children have for years made pilgrimages to
 this spot to have their pictures taken with Santa Claus.

 Santa's big comfy chair stands in the center of the room. It's a
 dramatic affair, a throne really: lots of ostentatious gold-painted
 filigree and red velvet pillows.

 are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the

>open chair
 You push against Santa's big comfy chair and the platform tips slowly
 back on a hidden hinge. Beneath the chair, a stairway leads downwards.

>go down
 The stairs go on for a long way. Eventually you reach the bottom.

 Deep Beneath the Mall
 The cramped little cave-room is hoarded with piles of merchandise. It
 appears to be a dead end.

 The light from the mall is just a small, bright square far above you.

 But there, lying among the debris, is your coat!

 You can also see a digital camera, coffee pot, television, and
 microwave oven here.

>take coat
 Taken.

>take all
 digital camera: It's tempting to just "acquire" a few extra gifts on
 the cheap, but you have more of a conscience than to take the
 already-stolen digital camera.
 coffee pot: It's tempting to just "acquire" a few extra gifts on the
 cheap, but you have more of a conscience than to take the
 already-stolen coffee pot.
 television: It's tempting to just "acquire" a few extra gifts on the
 cheap, but you have more of a conscience than to take the
 already-stolen television.
 microwave oven: It's tempting to just "acquire" a few extra gifts on
 the cheap, but you have more of a conscience than to take the
 already-stolen microwave oven.
 keys: You still won't need those until you find your car, but maybe now
 would be a good time to go ahead and wear your coat.
 summer sausage: Taken.
 cheese log: Taken.
 bunch of straw: Taken.

>wear coat
 You put on your coat (not willing to run the risk of losing it again).

>examine pocket
 In the pocket are your keys.

 The heart of Santaland and the destination of families from miles
 around. It's not your destination, of course, but that doesn't change
 the fact that parents and children have for years made pilgrimages to
 this spot to have their pictures taken with Santa Claus.

 Santa's big comfy chair  is tipped back, revealing the hidden staircase
 underneath. The stairs lead down into darkness.

 Next to Santa's chair is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. There
 are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the
 colorful decorative tree skirt underneath which was, until recently,

 Depot
 Here kids can (beg their parents to) pay an additional $5 to have their
 picture taken aboard the H&O Railroad. In other malls, you recall
 seeing Santaland setups with working trains chugging along through
 their little Santa-scapes, but this one seems much less elaborate.

 In the hedge wall to the south stands the stony arch of a tunnel. From
 the tunnel emerges a narrow set of train tracks. The tracks run north
 across the turf and slip under a closed door in the hedge.

 The brightly-colored locomotive sits on the tracks.

 The facade of a little ticket booth stands next to the tunnel.

>go east

 Somewhere in Santaland
 You are at the snowy, narrow intersection of several passages.

 From here, pathways lead to the west (back to the train depot) and the
 north (back toward the mall exit).

 In the wall to the east is a door that someone has tried,
 unsuccessfully, to camouflage. Bits of fake holly are stuck to it, but
 not enough that it blends in with the rest of the hedges. Plus, they
 did nothing to hide the shiny doorknob.

>go north

 Mall Exit
 You stand on the border between Santaland and the rest of the world,
 where the maze of fake shrubbery finally gives way to shiny, angular
 architecture. Who'd have thought you would be so happy to once again
 see polished PVC flooring.

 The mall exit lies just to the north: two sets of shiny glass doors and
 then freedom.

>go north
 Finally! After a long and unexpectedly difficult night, you pass
 through the sliding glass doors and step out into the chilly parking
 lot.

 You feel a flash of guilt about keeping the gold reindeer statue and
 the silver reindeer statue, but after a moment's reflection about all
 the elf has put you through, that feeling passes.

 Now... where the heck is your car?
