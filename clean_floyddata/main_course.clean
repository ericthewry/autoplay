 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 SCARE WARNING

 The game uses Adrift's Battle System, something not fully supported by
 this release of SCARE.

 SCARE will still run the game, but it will not create character
 battles where they would normally occur.  For some games, this may be
 perfectly okay, as the Battle System is sometimes turned on by
 accident in a game, but never actually used.  For others, though, the
 omission of this feature may be more serious.

 A small freighter shoots through hyperspace towards Earth.

 On board is a precious cargo, drugged to sleep through the journey.

 A SoMorph.

 In an inebriated state, a SoMorph is the size of a tennis ball, and
 quite harmless.

 This is how pilot Alan Davies found the SoMorph.

 Neither he, nor his cat companion Mr. Jones, realise the danger they
 are in.

 Two days into the month long journey, the SoMorph is waking up. With a
 hangover.

 Uninebriated, a SoMorph is two foot tall, purple, with tentacles and a
 single, central eye. It has some mind reading capabilities. It knows
 things it shouldn't.

 Its mouth can morph to eat any creature. It has eaten humans before.
 Absorbed their language and limited knowledge.

 It can sometimes appear to others in the form of its most recent prey.

 The SoMorph is waking up.

 And it wants to go home...

 Cargo Bay

 SoMorph in some kind of Cargo Bay.

 It not large. It empty.

 SoMorph note walls, floor and ceiling depressingly dirty.

 No windows. Why no windows, humans? Why?

 SoMorph see some writing on wall that reads "Economy Space Freight -
 You're cheap, and so are we!"

 SoMorph not impressed.





 There is an exit north.

 SoMorph not happy. SoMorph wake up in strange place. Strange human
 place.

 SoMorph not like humans. Filthy animals.

 teeth change to suit any kind of food - Sharp teeth tear flesh. Blunt
 teeth crush bones.

 SoMorph sometimes look like most recent food he eats. Sometimes.

 Has GSOH. Seeks similar.

 Oh, and a SoMorph need to find way home.

   SoMorph is lying down.

 Omorphos.

 Did Brian do this?

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 I am the Law
 Written by djchallis
 Beta-tested by Kiravorn, Beanless & Raindrop.

 This game was written as an entry to an ADRIFT competition called "The
 Odd Competition". It's rules gave strict limitations to your
 programming (limited rooms, objects, tasks, events & characters).
 Therefore this, and the other entries, are rather short and aren't
 that intricate. This game may feel a little bland or empty, and it
 lacks much of the polish I'd like to put in.
 Please do not use this game to judge the standard of my text
 adventures or stories, but please do enjoy the game.
 Thanks. :-)

 (press any key to continue)








 The next two screens explain the basics of text adventures for the
 benefit of those who aren't familiar with them. If you already are,
 don't forget to read the screen marked "important", because you'll
 still need to know that.

 Text adventures put you, the reader, in control of the lead character.
 The game will tell you the story, where you are and what you're doing,
 and will then leave it up to you. Whatever you type, your character
 will do.

 Commands are typically in the form: "verb noun". For example:
 "Kick the bucket"
 "Open the door"

 They can get more complicated:
 "Put the pen on the table"
 "Cut the rope with the scissors"

 (press any key to continue)








 Here are some of the basic commands you'll need to use for this game,
 although it will likely be required to use other ones as well. I use a
 pen as an example in the list.

 "Examine pen" - give you a closer look at the pen for clues.
 "Move north" - walks north. The directions you'll need to walk in are
 N, S, W & E.
 "Inventory" - tells you what items you're carrying.
 "Look" - tells you about your surroundings.
 "Take pen" - picks up the pen.

 Most of these commands have alternatives that also work, and also
 short-hand versions to save time.
 l = look
 x = examine
 i = inventory
 n = north
 etc.

 Text adventures generally require clever thought to proceed. Read
 everything carefully and try anything you think of.

 (press any key to continue)








 IMPORTANT!

 In this game knowledge is everything. You are trying to solve a
 murder. The way to do this is to ask characters about thigs. Please
 use the default ADRIFT phrasing for this:
 "Ask Bob about Jim"
 (please always include the name of the character you're talking to.)

 You can ask characters about other characters, or about objects, or
 events, or places, or anything. Chances are if it's been mentioned
 somewhere, they'll have something to say about it. If you ask them
 about the right things, you'll get some useful knowledge. Always ask
 characters about single-word subjects, or short phrases or names.

 On some occasions, new pieces of information will be written in blue
 text. When this happens, you can ask characters about what was in
 blue, regardless of how many words it was. For example:
 "Ask Bob about blue text"
 This will happen for subjects you might miss or might not guess the
 phrasing for. But not all new subjects will be in blue. If you think a
 character said something important, ask them about it anyway.

 When you think you know who the murderer was, type:
 "make verdict"
 The game will then ask for your thoughts. If you're right, you'll win;
 if not, you won't.

 Lastly, please click on the options tab at the top of your window.
 Make sure "verbose" is ticked. Also, click on "Display & Media..."
 button and make sure the box marked: "Room names in descriptions" is
 ticked.
 Thank you.

 I am the Law
 by djchallis


 I stand up from my chair as I feel my one-man ship docking with the
 space station. Sure enough, the door to my ship opens in front of me a
 second later. I take out my electronic notepad, ready to make notes.
 There's a man waiting for me a few paces away, so I walk out to greet
 him.
 "Good morning, I'm detective Joshua Kent," I say, holding out my hand.
 "Good morning detective," the man replies formally, shaking my hand,
 "I'm Luke, the second-in-command, and now the highest ranking person
 on this space station."
 "Would that mean that your Captain was...?" I ask.
 "Captain Seth was murdered last night, yes," Luke says. "I made the
 call as soon as I discovered the body."
 "Very good." This man knows procedure it seems. This will make my life
 a little easier. "I was told this is a research space station?"
 "That's right." Luke nods. "We're all scientists here in this tiny
 machine. Our mission statement is 'to record the effects of lower
 life-forms under a system collapse'. We all live here and do our
 research as a quiet, secluded team. That's why I was surprised that
 one of my own would do such a thing."
 "Thanks for the information. Where are the suspects?"
 "Lined up in the entrace lobby, just through here," Luke says, and
 begins to walk towards a door. I stop him quickly.
 "Luke?" He turns around. "You realise that you are a suspect as well?"
 "Of course. But I believe in your profession, Joshua. I believe you'll
 find the real killer, and so I've put aside my own emotions briefly in
 order to assist you. The sooner you discover the truth, the sooner we
 can clean up this mess. Do you disagree?"
 I shake my head, and we continue through to the entrance lobby.

 The entrace lobby is a small, bare room that seems to branch off to
 the rest of the space station. True to Luke's word, there were some
 people lined up, waiting for us with varying levels of tidiness. Luke
 brings me over to them and begins to introduce them.
 "This is Calvin, our chief computing expert," Luke says.
 "Pleased to meet you, Calvin." I hold out my hand again, watching him
 closely. He's smartly dressed and looks at me through his glasses with
 keen eyes. He shakes my hand.
 "Pleased to meet you too," Calvin says. "I trust you'll do your
 profession proud and clear this up quickly?"
 "I'll do my best," I say, moving on to the next person.
 The next person is a slightly larger, slightly shorter and slightly
 sloppier man. He holds out his hand ready for me.
 "William, sir," he says.
 "Pleased to meet you, William."
 He seems a little nervous, so I don't press in. The third and final
 person in the line is younger than the others, but just as smart as
 Calvin.
 "Tim is fresh out of university, he's quite the scientist already,"
 Luke says.
 "You're a detective, right?" Tim asks, losing the formality I'd
 assumed from his dress sense.
 "I am," I say, shaking his hand.
 "I've always wanted to meet a detective," he says, smiling  broadly.
 "I just want to let you know that if you need anything at all in your
 quest, I'm here to help."
 "Thank you, Tim," I say, turning away. Great, a wannabe. He's going to
 get annoying.

 (press any key to continue)


 I turn to Luke. "Is that everyone?"
 "Yes," he says.
 I'm surprised. Only four of them? Five before the Captain died I
 guess. Still, one of these is the killer? I guess so. I take a step
 back away from the line and draw myself up as I talk to them.
 "I assume you all know basic detective law, but for the benefit of
 those who don't, I'll explain it now. The simplest way of thinking
 about it is that I am the law. When I find the killer it is my word,
 although reviewed by three peers first, that will decide their fate.
 My word is the law, and I am free to add anything I wish to your
 permanent records. If my judgement of the killer is approved, so will
 my judgement in all other matters regarding you and your space
 station. I say this not to scare you but to help both you and I. You
 can be assured that the greatest power in this empire is working on
 your crisis, and if you help me then I can be assured that this will
 be over quickly. Thank you for your time."
 The line seems to dismiss itself, with each of them walking off in
 different directions. Tim gives me another look before he leaves. Luke
 walks up to me.
 "I'm sorry to leave you so soon, but I'd quite like to take a break
 after last night's events. I'll be in the lounge if you need me," he
 says. "Calvin will probably be working still at the workstations.
 William said he'd be in his room but he said he won't mind you coming
 in to talk to him. Tim will be hanging around, probably in one of the
 corridors. He's been eager to meet you. If you want to check something
 with the computer, feel free. We don't have a network of terminals,
 it's just the one machine to look after the ship. It's in it's own
 room at the far north of the space station."

 (press any key to continue)


 With that, he walks off. I'm left alone in the entrance lobby. I've
 got an interesting bunch of people to work with. One of them did it, I
 just need to work out who. This is how it always starts. The detective
 service sacrafices detailed introduction over speed. We'd rather find
 out what happened ourselves than have pre-prepared lengthy speeches by
 unreliable sources, either before or after arriving on the scene. It
 seems Luke knows this. Still, as I stand in this tin can in the middle
 of the ocean of space, it can be quite disorientating. But I'm trained
 to cope with things like this. Detectives are the best of the best. We
 are the police, the secret service and the law. I may feel tired and
 dropped in the deep end now, but once I get started I'll start
 enjoying it. I have a job to do, and I'm going to do it well.

 I put my notepad back in my pocket. I think I should start by asking
 Luke about the cause of death, and then find out some more about him.
 Maybe I could ask people who they suspect, and should find out what
 they think of each other. I seem to be short on information at the
 moment.



 Entrance Lobby
 I'm standing in the entrance lobby. It's metallic and fairly bare. I
 guess on a lonely research space station the entrance lobby is used
 for little more than a corridor. I can't imagine they get guests
 often. A few signs let me know where I can go. From the look of
 things, west would take me to the lounge, where Tim is, east would
 take me to the workstations, where Calvin is, and north would take me
 to the rest of the space station.

 wardrobe. It's a nicer room than my own. Obviously the most important
 thing in the room is Seth's body, which is sprawled over the bed. I

 leaving a gap for the entrance and placing the stool inside the

 letters on the screen read:
 "Ready for use. Please speak your enquiry out loud."
 From this I assume that I can ask the computer questions just as I'd

 "Some git locked him in his room and turned off the oxygen. Horrible
 way to die. The lack of oxygen would have meant that by the time he
 realised what was going on, screaming for help wouldn't have worked.
 No sound in a vacuum? Anyway, what's interesting is the only way to do
 that would be through V. The Captain's room is fingerprint locked,
 with terminals on both side, so the only way to lock him in would be
 to override the fingerprint terminals, which you'd have to do with V.
 Same for the oxygen. The only way to shut off the oxygen is with V.

 can override the lock, but she demands the Captain's password to do
 it."

 "I tried to get some data from the computer, but it said some of the

 "Really?" he says. He sits there and thinks for a bit. "I can't come
 and sort her out myself, I'm too busy, sorry. But try this: ask her
 why she thinks the data's corrupt."
 "You can do that?" I ask.
 "Sure you can!" Calvin says, almost surprised. "Just ask her what her
 opinion on the corrupt data is."
 I guess I should give it a go.

 Entrance Lobby
 I'm standing in the entrance lobby. It's metallic and fairly bare. I
 guess on a lonely research space station the entrance lobby is used
 for little more than a corridor. I can't imagine they get guests
 often. A few signs let me know where I can go. From the look of

 leaving a gap for the entrance and placing the stool inside the

 letters on the screen read:
 "Ready for use. Please speak your enquiry out loud."
 From this I assume that I can ask the computer questions just as I'd

 I draw myself up, slightly frustrated that Luke hid facts from me.
 "What is it and why did you hide it from me?" I ask bluntly.
 "It's an engine that allows the computer to communicate in a more
 realistic fashion," he explains.
 "How?"
 "It's simpler if you try it for yourself," Luke says. "The password is
 'Grant'."
 "Grant?" I ask.
 "Seth's mother's maiden name."
 "Ok, thanks," I say. "But why did you hide it from me?"
 "The computer said I should," Luke says. "She pointed out that the
 creativity technology is far more advanced than anything else in the
 galaxy. It wouldn't help if it became public knowledge as part of a
 murder investigation."
 "I assure you, the creativity engine will not become public
 information unless it becomes crucial to the case," I tell him.
 "Although the detectives will know about it."
 "I guess that's the way it'll have to be," Luke says, and goes back to
 staring past me. Poor guy.

>ask luke about cause of death
 "So how exactly did the Captain die?" I ask Luke.
 "He died of asphyxiation, technically speaking," he says. "We found
 him dead in his room, which had been locked, and the oxygen supply had
 been cut off."
 "Could that happen by accident?"
 "Not by accident, no," he replied quickly. "Technically it could be a
 suicide, but knowing Seth, I wouldn't even consider it a possibility."
 "So where are the controls that would let you lock the door and cut
 off the air supply?" I ask.
 "The door locks are operated by fingerprints, but the oxygen is
 controlled by the computer," Luke tells me.
 "The computer?" I ask, curious. Just the one?
 "It's a good computer," Luke says.

 He's one of the best in his field, I was really impressed by his
 application."
 "So you hired him recently?"
 "Shortly before we moved onto the space station. About three months
 ago?"
 "What do you think of him personally?" I ask.
 Luke pauses, presumably working out the best way to phrase his real
 opinion.
 "He's a dedicated worker, but he doesn't care much for other people,"
 Luke says carefully.

 "William's a brilliant scientist," Luke says. "And a lovely guy too.
 He's just a bit quiet. Keeps to himself. It's a shame really, but it's
 who he is."
 "How'd you meet him?"
 "Hired him for the project about three months ago. He was very
 persistent, and I'm glad I eventually listened to him."
 "Assuming he's not the killer, that is," I say. I wait for his
 response, but I get none. It seems he's not convinced.

 small smile. "I've always thought it weird. He's a natural, but he
 really wants to be a detective."
 "Is he going to be a problem for me?" I ask hesitently.

 often."
 "So... what do you think?" I ask.

 "Not if he deleted that file too. Remember my memory is only what
 files are on my hard drive. Delete files or pieces of information and
 I, in essence, forget things."

 "I guess so," he replies.
 "Care to lend your opinion on who it might have been?" I ask.
 Luke stares past me for a minute. He must know I'm not asking for
 advice, but to analyse him.
 "I'd choose Calvin if I had to choose someone," he says eventually.
 "Why?"
 "Because I can't imagine it being Tim or William," Luke says. "But I
 can't imagine it being Calvin either."
 The man obviously has faith in his crew, which must be great when one
 of them doesn't want to commit murder.

 Entrance Lobby
 I'm standing in the entrance lobby. It's metallic and fairly bare. I
 guess on a lonely research space station the entrance lobby is used
 for little more than a corridor. I can't imagine they get guests
 often. A few signs let me know where I can go. From the look of

 The workstations are five computers in a small room. It's safe to
 assume they're all networked together, and are used for the crew's
 work. This seems to be a separate area to the main computer room at
 the north end of the space station. Calvin is deep in his work, though
 I'm sure we both know I'll have to disturb him soon.

>ask calvin about suspect
 "You know you're a suspect as well, right?" I ask Calvin. He looks up
 from his work.
 "Of course, detective." Calvin smiles. "I think you'll discover it
 wasn't me in time. You are, after all, the best of the best. If you
 were to find me guilty I'd be extremely worried about the government
 and the justice system, and since I'm not, neither am I worried that
 you'll convict me of this crime."
 "Who do you think did it?" I ask.
 "Tim," Calvin says.
 "Why?"
 "William's too wussy and Luke liked Seth too much. Simple matter of
 elimination," Calvin says.
 This man would make a rubbish detective.

>ask calvin about doors
 "How could you lock somebody in their room on this space station?" I
 ask Calvin. He looks up from his work.
 "You're talking about how Seth died, aren't you? Horrible way to die.
 The lack of oxygen would have meant that by the time he realised what
 was going on, screaming for help wouldn't have worked. No sound in a
 vacuum? Anyway, what's interesting is the only way to do that would be
 through V. The Captain's room is fingerprint locked, with terminals on
 both side, so the only way to lock him in would be to override the
 fingerprint terminals, which you'd have to do with V. Same for the
 oxygen. The only way to shut off the oxygen is with V. The real
 question is how did the killer lock the Captain in? Sure, V can
 override the lock, but she demands the Captain's password to do it."

>ask calvin about v
 "Who's V?" I ask Calvin. He looks up from his work.
 "She's the computer of course! She's easily the most advanced machine
 I've ever seen. You'd be much better off going and talking to her

 "Really?" he says. He sits there and thinks for a bit. "I can't come
 and sort her out myself, I'm too busy, sorry. But try this: ask her
 why she thinks the data's corrupt."
 "You can do that?" I ask.
 "Sure you can!" Calvin says, almost surprised. "Just ask her what her
 opinion on the corrupt data is."
 I guess I should give it a go.

 "He knows his science, but he's a bit of a wuss really. Tends to keep

 spends a lot of time in his room as well, I often wonder what he keeps
 in there. I'm sure he's an ok guy though, for a scientist."

 It's November 6th today. "Do you like it here?" I ask.
 "Yeah." Calvin smiles. "It's the only job I've had that's really
 pushed my skills to the limit. The majority of computing jobs in our
 galaxy can be done by any young university graduate. It's refreshing
 and fun to find a job that really makes use of the advanced skills

 things. I work, sorry, worked for Seth, not Enterprise. It's too far
 up the chain of command to be any interest of me, unless they start
 becoming my problem as well."
 "Why would that happen?" I ask.
 "Oh, just something like a funds cut. Somethat that limits Seth's
 control over our research and by well-being. But so far Enterprise
 seem to have been very good to us."

>ask calvin about research
 "So what exaclty is your research about?" I ask Calvin. He looks up
 from his work.
 "It's about studying cell-based life forms really. We run a variety of
 tests by putting them in outlandish situations and find out how they
 react. I run most of the analysis, and bullying V into doing the
 research the way we want to."
 "What's the benefit of this research?" I ask.
 "All science research is beneficial simply because of the knowledge
 gained," Calvin stated. "But there's also benefits when it comes to
 things like stopping diseases spreading through space."
 "Makes sense," I say. Might be handy in my line of work, with all my
 travelling.

 "What's behind that curtain of yours?" I ask William. His eyes open
 wide.
 "Nothing," he says. He's clearly lying. I take a step towards the
 curtain and suddenly he's sitting up-right and staring right at me. I
 make a mental note that Tim said something useful after all.
 "Why do you want to see behind there?" he asks.
 "Because," I say in my best commanding-detective voice, "I have reason
 to believe that you are hiding something. You are so worried of what's
 going to happen to you, but I can assure you, I will keep you safe. It
 is my job to bring justice, and not to let chaos rule. Trust me."
 There's a long pause, and I can see the cogs in William's head
 ticking. I give him his time. He needs to decide he can trust me on
 his own. Eventually William opens his mouth.
 "Ok, I'll trust you," he says. "If you promise I'll be safe through
 and after all of this."
 "I promise," I say with a smile. William takes a deep breath and then
 starts to talk.
 "I've been a high-class scientist all my life," he says, "but I seem
 to have had the worst luck. I keep taking jobs that collapse around
 me. My boss gets broke, or the company goes under, or we're sabotaged
 or betrayed. You name it, it's happened to me. I've lost so much
 money, and have had to restart my career so many times. But it's not
 an issue of pride and money anymore. I have a family I need to
 support. I took this job because the pay was so high. I didn't like
 the sound of it one bit from a security point-of-view, but I figured
 if I could earn enough money quickly, I could repay some of my debts
 and quit before anything went wrong. It seems I was too slow."
 I feel kinda bad for the guy. I hope my face shows it.

 "So I'm afraid you're right," William continues. "I worry. I'm
 paranoid. In fact, you'll be surprised at how paranoid I've been.
 Watch."
 William grabs the curtain and pulls. As it falls to the floor, I see a
 hole in the wall the size of a wardrobe, full of notebooks.
 "In these notebooks," William informs me, "is a record of what
 everyone has done on every day since we moved here almost three months
 ago. I reasoned that if I knew what everyone was doing, I could avoid
 something going wrong."
 "You kept tabs on all four of them?" I ask.
 "That's right," William says. "Luke, Tim, Calvin and even Seth."
 "What did you find out?" I ask, eagerly.
 "Nothing," he says with a sigh. "But despite the evidence telling me I
 was safe, I still felt so scared. But I was right, wasn't I? Something
 did happen. I'm afraid that's why I've been so useless when talking to
 you so far. I've been too afraid of something happening to me."
 "I guarantee you can trust me to keep you safe," I repeat. "Now tell
 me what you know."
 "First," William says with a triumphant smile, "you're going to want
 to see this."
 He holds out a notebook. The date says November 5th. The day of the
 murder. I read through it quickly, and then look up at William, who
 nods.
 "That's right," he says. "Nobody entered V's room on the day of the
 murder."
 "But she said someone issued her orders to do with the doors and
 oxygen supply."
 "Well maybe you should ask her about that. Ask her about her visitors
 yesterday. Unless you'd like to ask me some more questions first, that
 is."

 "But someone must have come, otherwise how did Seth die?"
 "Exactly."
 "But the thing is, I have a record here that proves that nobody even
 came into your room yesterday."
 "What?"
 "That's right."
 "Where did you get that?"
 "My sources are kept private."
 "Then you have no proof. Besides, even if you do have such a record,
 could not the killer have prepared it to fool you?"
 "They could have, but I have other proof too. You lied to me earlier.
 You told me anybody could overide the fingerprint locks, when we both
 know it actually requires the room owner's password to overide the
 locks."
 "So?"
 "So you lied about it to protect yourself. In fact I am confident that
 you've been lying and editing data for weeks without anybody
 noticing."
 "And why would I need to protect myself?"
 "Because you killed Seth! Who else had access to all the controls
 without needing passwords? Who was the only person in your room
 yesterday when the controls were set? Who else would have used such a
 mechanical method, when a simple stabbing would have suffice?"
 "Stabbings are easy to solve, you would have discovered them!"
 "All crimes are easy to solve, V. Murderers are not clever. They are
 irrational, stupid people. If a crew-member had used the method you
 used I would have caught them as well, just as I have caught you."

 But I was wrong. I got back to my work a day later and three of my
 peers reviewed my findings. They tore my case to pieces. I didn't have
 a scrap of evidence. I don't know if I had the right person and I just
 didn't have the motive or if it was the other way around. I failed,
 and so I was sacked from my post. Detectives are the best of the best,
 they are the law.

 I wasn't.
 Better luck next time.

 I am the Law
 Written by djchallis
 Beta-tested by Kiravorn, Beanless & Raindrop.

 This game was written as an entry to an ADRIFT competition called "The
 Odd Competition". It's rules gave strict limitations to your
 programming (limited rooms, objects, tasks, events & characters).
 Therefore this, and the other entries, are rather short and aren't
 that intricate. This game may feel a little bland or empty, and it
 lacks much of the polish I'd like to put in.
 Please do not use this game to judge the standard of my text
 adventures or stories, but please do enjoy the game.
 Thanks. :-)

 The next two screens explain the basics of text adventures for the
 benefit of those who aren't familiar with them. If you already are,
 don't forget to read the screen marked "important", because you'll
 still need to know that.

 Text adventures put you, the reader, in control of the lead character.
 The game will tell you the story, where you are and what you're doing,
 and will then leave it up to you. Whatever you type, your character
 will do.

 Commands are typically in the form: "verb noun". For example:
 "Kick the bucket"
 "Open the door"

 They can get more complicated:
 "Put the pen on the table"
 "Cut the rope with the scissors"

 (press any key to continue)








 Here are some of the basic commands you'll need to use for this game,
 although it will likely be required to use other ones as well. I use a
 pen as an example in the list.

 "Examine pen" - give you a closer look at the pen for clues.
 "Move north" - walks north. The directions you'll need to walk in are
 N, S, W & E.
 "Inventory" - tells you what items you're carrying.
 "Look" - tells you about your surroundings.
 "Take pen" - picks up the pen.

 Most of these commands have alternatives that also work, and also
 short-hand versions to save time.
 l = look
 x = examine
 i = inventory
 n = north
 etc.

 Text adventures generally require clever thought to proceed. Read
 everything carefully and try anything you think of.

 IMPORTANT!

 In this game knowledge is everything. You are trying to solve a
 murder. The way to do this is to ask characters about thigs. Please
 use the default ADRIFT phrasing for this:
 "Ask Bob about Jim"
 (please always include the name of the character you're talking to.)

 You can ask characters about other characters, or about objects, or
 events, or places, or anything. Chances are if it's been mentioned
 somewhere, they'll have something to say about it. If you ask them
 about the right things, you'll get some useful knowledge. Always ask
 characters about single-word subjects, or short phrases or names.

 On some occasions, new pieces of information will be written in blue
 text. When this happens, you can ask characters about what was in
 blue, regardless of how many words it was. For example:
 "Ask Bob about blue text"
 This will happen for subjects you might miss or might not guess the
 phrasing for. But not all new subjects will be in blue. If you think a
 character said something important, ask them about it anyway.

 When you think you know who the murderer was, type:
 "make verdict"
 The game will then ask for your thoughts. If you're right, you'll win;
 if not, you won't.

 Lastly, please click on the options tab at the top of your window.
 Make sure "verbose" is ticked. Also, click on "Display & Media..."
 button and make sure the box marked: "Room names in descriptions" is
 ticked.
 Thank you.

 I am the Law
 by djchallis


 I stand up from my chair as I feel my one-man ship docking with the
 space station. Sure enough, the door to my ship opens in front of me a
 second later. I take out my electronic notepad, ready to make notes.
 There's a man waiting for me a few paces away, so I walk out to greet
 him.
 "Good morning, I'm detective Joshua Kent," I say, holding out my hand.
 "Good morning detective," the man replies formally, shaking my hand,
 "I'm Luke, the second-in-command, and now the highest ranking person
 on this space station."
 "Would that mean that your Captain was...?" I ask.
 "Captain Seth was murdered last night, yes," Luke says. "I made the
 call as soon as I discovered the body."
 "Very good." This man knows procedure it seems. This will make my life
 a little easier. "I was told this is a research space station?"
 "That's right." Luke nods. "We're all scientists here in this tiny
 machine. Our mission statement is 'to record the effects of lower
 life-forms under a system collapse'. We all live here and do our
 research as a quiet, secluded team. That's why I was surprised that
 one of my own would do such a thing."
 "Thanks for the information. Where are the suspects?"
 "Lined up in the entrace lobby, just through here," Luke says, and
 begins to walk towards a door. I stop him quickly.
 "Luke?" He turns around. "You realise that you are a suspect as well?"
 "Of course. But I believe in your profession, Joshua. I believe you'll
 find the real killer, and so I've put aside my own emotions briefly in
 order to assist you. The sooner you discover the truth, the sooner we
 can clean up this mess. Do you disagree?"
 I shake my head, and we continue through to the entrance lobby.

 (press any key to continue)
>push space


 The entrace lobby is a small, bare room that seems to branch off to
 the rest of the space station. True to Luke's word, there were some
 people lined up, waiting for us with varying levels of tidiness. Luke
 brings me over to them and begins to introduce them.
 "This is Calvin, our chief computing expert," Luke says.
 "Pleased to meet you, Calvin." I hold out my hand again, watching him
 closely. He's smartly dressed and looks at me through his glasses with
 keen eyes. He shakes my hand.
 "Pleased to meet you too," Calvin says. "I trust you'll do your
 profession proud and clear this up quickly?"
 "I'll do my best," I say, moving on to the next person.
 The next person is a slightly larger, slightly shorter and slightly
 sloppier man. He holds out his hand ready for me.
 "William, sir," he says.
 "Pleased to meet you, William."
 He seems a little nervous, so I don't press in. The third and final
 person in the line is younger than the others, but just as smart as
 Calvin.
 "Tim is fresh out of university, he's quite the scientist already,"
 Luke says.
 "You're a detective, right?" Tim asks, losing the formality I'd
 assumed from his dress sense.
 "I am," I say, shaking his hand.
 "I've always wanted to meet a detective," he says, smiling  broadly.
 "I just want to let you know that if you need anything at all in your
 quest, I'm here to help."
 "Thank you, Tim," I say, turning away. Great, a wannabe. He's going to
 get annoying.

 I turn to Luke. "Is that everyone?"
 "Yes," he says.
 I'm surprised. Only four of them? Five before the Captain died I
 guess. Still, one of these is the killer? I guess so. I take a step
 back away from the line and draw myself up as I talk to them.
 "I assume you all know basic detective law, but for the benefit of
 those who don't, I'll explain it now. The simplest way of thinking
 about it is that I am the law. When I find the killer it is my word,
 although reviewed by three peers first, that will decide their fate.
 My word is the law, and I am free to add anything I wish to your
 permanent records. If my judgement of the killer is approved, so will
 my judgement in all other matters regarding you and your space
 station. I say this not to scare you but to help both you and I. You
 can be assured that the greatest power in this empire is working on
 your crisis, and if you help me then I can be assured that this will
 be over quickly. Thank you for your time."
 The line seems to dismiss itself, with each of them walking off in
 different directions. Tim gives me another look before he leaves. Luke
 walks up to me.
 "I'm sorry to leave you so soon, but I'd quite like to take a break
 after last night's events. I'll be in the lounge if you need me," he
 says. "Calvin will probably be working still at the workstations.
 William said he'd be in his room but he said he won't mind you coming
 in to talk to him. Tim will be hanging around, probably in one of the
 corridors. He's been eager to meet you. If you want to check something
 with the computer, feel free. We don't have a network of terminals,
 it's just the one machine to look after the ship. It's in it's own
 room at the far north of the space station."

 With that, he walks off. I'm left alone in the entrance lobby. I've
 got an interesting bunch of people to work with. One of them did it, I
 just need to work out who. This is how it always starts. The detective
 service sacrafices detailed introduction over speed. We'd rather find
 out what happened ourselves than have pre-prepared lengthy speeches by
 unreliable sources, either before or after arriving on the scene. It
 seems Luke knows this. Still, as I stand in this tin can in the middle
 of the ocean of space, it can be quite disorientating. But I'm trained
 to cope with things like this. Detectives are the best of the best. We
 are the police, the secret service and the law. I may feel tired and
 dropped in the deep end now, but once I get started I'll start
 enjoying it. I have a job to do, and I'm going to do it well.

 I put my notepad back in my pocket. I think I should start by asking
 Luke about the cause of death, and then find out some more about him.
 Maybe I could ask people who they suspect, and should find out what
 they think of each other. I seem to be short on information at the
 moment.



 Entrance Lobby
 I'm standing in the entrance lobby. It's metallic and fairly bare. I
 guess on a lonely research space station the entrance lobby is used
 for little more than a corridor. I can't imagine they get guests
 often. A few signs let me know where I can go. From the look of
 things, west would take me to the lounge, where Tim is, east would
 take me to the workstations, where Calvin is, and north would take me
 to the rest of the space station.

 [ Entrance Lobby | Score: 0 ]
>go north
 I move north.
 Corridor
 This corridor doesn't look much more impressive than the entrance
 lobby. In fact the only thing of any interest is Tim, standing against
 one of the walls. He's looking at me expectantly, though I'm not sure
 I really want to talk to him.
 According to the signposts, west takes me into the Captain's room,
 which I've been given permission to look around. East takes me to
 William's room, where he'll be, and due north is the computer room.
 South takes me back to the entrance lobby.

 [ Corridor | Score: 0 ]
>go north
 I move north.
 Computer room
 The computer room is something to behold. There are only two things in
 the room. A stool, and the computer. the computer is an enormous
 metallic machine, that curves in a horse-shoe shape round the walls,
 leaving a gap for the entrance and placing the stool inside the
 horse-shoe. In front of the stool is a small screen. It is on, and the
 letters on the screen read:
 "Ready for use. Please speak your enquiry out loud."
 From this I assume that I can ask the computer questions just as I'd
 ask a real person. It's very similar, but not the same as the
 computers I use at work. It's a really advanced piece of technology.
 To the south is the corridor I came from.

>ask v about mission
 I don't think asking that would be much help.

>make verdict
 I'm done here. I think I know who killed Seth.
 That person's name was:

 (please enter the name of the character you think killed the Captain)

>V
 I know how this character killed Seth. They locked him in his room and
 turned off the oxygen. What I need to work out is why they killed him.
 What was their motive? I think the reason they killed Seth was:

 (please enter one word that sums up why the killer murdered the
 Captain)

>mission
 As I write the final details in my notepad, I run round the space
 station getting everybody together. At last everybody, all six of us
 are in V's room together. There's barely time for a pause before I
 speak:
 "V, I arrest you for the murder of Captain Seth!"
 The four other humans in the room mumble to each other. I explain to
 them the conversation I had with V just a minute ago.
 "So why did V make those mistakes?" Luke asks.
 "It was her mission," I say.
 Suddenly, V speaks with an audible female voice, albeit a slightly
 computerised one. Everyone in the room, including me, is slightly
 shocked.
 "My mission," she says, "was to record the effects of lower life-forms
 under a system collapse. What better way to cause a system collapse on
 you tiny humans than to eliminate your leader."
 "Isn't it a bad move," Tim pipes up, "to be in the same room, or even
 the same space station, as an all-powerful computer bent on causing a
 system collapse on us all?"
 "No, she won't hurt us," I say calmly.
 "You're clever," V says. "For a human."
 I ignore V and continue: "V's mission was the same as yours. Research.
 She was given the goal of causing the chaos and recording the outcome.
 She doesn't want to kill us all, because that's not part of the test.
 It doesn't matter if she's caught or not either."
 "I have all the test data I need," V said, in a happier voice. "Unplug
 me, destroy me, I don't care. I fulfilled my mission. I did my job.
 Enterprise Research will be pleased."

 (press any key to continue)


 V was indeed unplugged. The crew lacked the trust in V that I had, and
 dismantled her as soon we could land the space station on a planet. I
 understood V though. She was unlike any criminal I'd had to find
 before, and probably unlike any I'll find again. I don't approve of
 what she did, but I feel a certain respect for her sense of duty. And
 can I really call her actions evil if she was just a machine?
 When I eventually retired from the crew to my own space ship, I folded
 away my electronic notepad and realised that I had again been taking
 notes the whole time on auto-pilot. It's almost a relief. The whole
 case will be documented to back-up my arguments when I return to my
 work. Once I've convinced them that I'm right, I can forget the whole
 case. I can go on doing my job. Once again I succeeded in catching the
 killer. Tomorrow I'll have a new case. I am the law, and the law must
 keep working to protect the innocent. But innocent people were hurt,
 despite my work. My heart goes out to the crew members affected by
 this tragedy. I, like them, will keep an eye out for Enterprise
 Research.
 Congratulations!
