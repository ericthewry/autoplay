 Wizards.  From the kindly old white bearded casters wearing robes with
 stars and moons to the battle-hardened war-mage throwing fireballs at
 dragons.  The royal family has always had one on hand: a wise diviner
 to lead the kingdom into peace or a dangerous conjurer to dominate all
 of the land under one rule.  Or perhaps a divine healer?  An
 alchemist?  Or even a necromancer?  The combinations are boundless.
 Let me tell you my story.

 I wasn't always a wizened old wizard, you know.  Wizards begin their
 lives the same as everyone else.  I was born in a small village in the
 Kingdom of Daria.  King Norbert and Queen Audrey reigned in the
 capital city of Tornassa, which was many miles away from my small
 village.

 I remember the day I was born.

 A: My parents were good people.
 B: My parents didn't want me.


 A: Boy
 B: Girl


 A: Morgana
 B: Prunella
 C: Griselda
 D: Gladys
 E: Helena
 F: Something else

 although there were a few exceptions.  The entire kingdom of Daria was
 like that, besides the dwarves under the Grey Mountains, the elves in
 the Alderheart Forest and the orcs in the wilderness to the west.  Our
 kingdom was very racially tolerant, when I was young.

 A: My parents and I were human.
 B: My parents and I were elves.
 C: My parents and I were dwarves.
 D: My parents and I were halflings.
 E: My parents and I were gnomes.
 F: My parents and I were half-orcs.
 G: My parents and I were half-elves.
 H: My parents and I were pure blood orcs.
 I: My parents and I were goblins.
 J: My parents and I were trolls.

 up in a village of humans, but I managed.
 (Orc Faction +25, Fighting +25, Body +10, Willpower -5 and Personality
 -5)

 My parents weren't poor, although they never bothered to make sure
 that my clothes were without holes or that my shoes fit.  They fought
 a lot and my father was often drunk.  They never hit me, but I think
 it was because they knew that the temple priests would never allow
 such a thing.  I always had the impression that they were waiting for
 me to become old enough to move out.

 Even as a young child, I was drawn into the unknown.  I remember my
 first magical experience, even though I was only five years old.  I
 don't know where my parents were, but I wandered off alone:

 A: Into the forest.
 B: Into a graveyard.
 C: Into the temple.
 D: Into the village witch's hut.

>b
 that night.  I had wandered between the tombstones for some time
 before a glowing shape appeared before me.  It was a ghost, a spirit
 trapped on our side of the veil.

 A: I ran home and told the local priests what I saw.
 B: I tried to force it to do what I wanted.
 C: I felt sad for it, so I tried to cheer the ghost up.
 D: I tried to break the gravestone it was in front of.

>c
 I like to think that I brought the creature some measure of peace.
 (Good +1, Diplomacy +10 and Personality +3)

 At the age of seven, I made a friend.  Childhood friends are special
 since they remain a part of you for the rest of your life, even long
 after you have grown apart. My best friend was:

 A: A boy.
 B: A girl.
 C: Imaginary.

 Prunella behaved, but I couldn't help myself.
 (Elf Faction -10)

 I remember the first day Prunella started picking on me.

 A: I kicked her shins and ran away.
 B: I tried reasoning with the bully.
 C: I didn't want to be bullied my entire life, so I started
 exercising.
 D: I tried to join Prunella.  I thought that we'd be able to bully
 more kids together.

 Life in Elmvale was pleasant and it was a beautiful place to grow up.
 There were farms all around us and a sparkling river that ran through
 the center of it.  We had all of the amenities of a small town as
 well.

 A: I enjoyed swimming in the town's river on hot summer days.
 B: I did small jobs for the local business owners.
 C: I rarely left my home, I prefered to stay at home and read.
 D: I got into a lot of trouble.
 E: I helped out at the local temple.

 I remember one day when we found a little puppy in a back alley.  It
 looked so sad and lonely, which made me think it didn't belong to
 anyone.  It was very dirty and had a broken leg.

 A: I nursed it back to health.
 B: I threw rocks at it until it died.
 C: I caught it and sold it to some orcs.
 D: I ignored it.

 little dog.
 (Good +1 and Healing +15)

 I was twelve years old when tragedy struck.  Rumors of trouble had
 been building for weeks, but as a kid, I never paid it any attention.
 One day I saw the streets full of smoke.  At first, I thought it was
 the great dragon Parnaxxus, breathing fire upon my small village.
 That wasn't the case, soon I learned that raiders were setting fire to
 houses and stores.  Our small village was being attacked by:

 A: Elves
 B: Dwarves
 C: Orcs

 to protect us.  I later learned that most of Daria was attacked that
 year.  The king really had his hands full.  I did the only thing I
 could think of.

 A: I grabbed a sword to protect my friends and family.
 B: I went to the temple to tend the wounded.
 C: I looted the corpses.
 D: I hid in the basement of my house.

>c
 their belongings were there for the taking.  I even found an enchanted
 dagger on a dead elf.
 (Thievery +15, Gold +65 and Gained Enchanted Dagger)

 The elf raiders were ruthless.  Many people were killed and several
 buildings burned down.

 A: My parents were killed.
 B: I was very badly injured.

>a
 were still my parents and now they were dead. It didn't go unnoticed
 to me that Prunella, the bully, was an elf, like the attackers.  It
 was just a mean spirited thought since Prunella had nothing to do with
 the raid.

 The attack changed everything, putting an end to my carefree days as a
 child.  I likely would have had a few more years of fun and innocence,
 but after the attack, I had to get a job and become an adult.

 A: I moved into the temple orphanage.
 B: I got my own place and found a job.

>b

 A: I apprenticed to the local blacksmith.
 B: I joined the town guard.
 C: I became a nature guide.
 D: I became an apprentice to a scribe.
 E: Actually, I did something else.

 to collect rare reagents.  I was also hired by people for hunting
 trips, fishing trips and general camping.  I traveled far and wide,
 but I kept returning to my village.
 (Body +3, Willpower +1, Geography +25, Nature, +30 and Gold +20)

 When I was fourteen, Prunella the bully, and some of her friends,
 cornered me in an alley. I thought that now that I was a nature guide,
 these types of things wouldn't happen.  Prunella didn't see it that
 way.

 A: I stood up for myself and fought them off. (Needs 30 Fighting and
 30 Body)
 B: I talked them out of it. (Needs 35 Personality)
 C: I drew my magic dagger.
 D: Remember that dog I helped?  He came back and helped me fight them
 off.
 E: I got beaten up badly that day, but I vowed to get my revenge in
 the future.

 deeply while Prunella screamed in pain and surprise.  After a few

 He was surprisingly nice about the whole thing.  He said that I had

 Needless to say, Killah P, my dog, came with me.

 I had a nice little party before I left.  We had it in the newly
 rebuilt tavern since the old one had been burned down during the elf
 raid. I gave up the life of a nature guide and left for the Academy
 the next day.

 The trip to Tornassa went well.  I spent the first day as a tourist,
 just looking at the sights.  King Norbert and Queen Audrey's castle
 was impressive.  I stared up at the towers, hoping to catch a glimpse
 of Prince Gareth, who was now 25, or Princess Emily, who was two years
 younger.  I didn't see any royalty that day.

 The next morning, I went to the Academy.  This was where all of the
 great mages learned their skills, including the royal advisor
 Fraledan.  The Academy was financed by the Mage's Guild, which was
 nice, since it meant I didn't have to pay anything.

 I stood at the entrance to the Academy, uncertain as to how to
 proceed.

 "Why have you come?"

 The voice came from a little old man sitting on a rock next to the
 doors leading into the Academy.  He was very small and his bald head
 made him seem vulnerable.

 "Who are you?" I asked.

 "I am Master Durgan, the doorkeeper to the Academy.  Why have you
 come?"

 A: I told him that I wanted to learn magic.
 B: I told him that I wanted to learn Necromancy.
 C: I told him that I wanted to learn everything.
 D: I told him it was none of his business and to let me in.

>c

 will be invaluable."

 He smiled warmly at me and led me to the testing chamber.
 (Arcana +5, Agriculture +5, Diplomacy +5, Economics +5, Geography +5,

 Master Durgan placed his hands on my head and concentrated.  After a
 few moments, he nodded his bald head in approval.  "Yes, the spark is
 within you.  Welcome to the Academy."

 I was given a room in the Academy, it had a bed, a desk and a chair.
 It was very sparse, but it was my own.  I was given a schedule of
 classes.  My training as a wizard had begun.

 Although I learned many things at the Academy, my favourite class was:

 A: Alchemy
 B: Conjuration
 C: Divination
 D: Enchantment
 E: Illusion
 F: Summoning
 G: Transmutation
 H: Something else

 magic.  Healing also wasn't taught in a specific class, being
 considered mostly the domain of priests.

 at the Academy.

 B: No, not Illusion.

 (Illusion +30)

 My classes went well as I began to learn the arcane arts. It was a lot
 of work, reading ancient tomes and trying to force mystical energies
 to do as I wished.  I learned a little bit of everything that was
 taught during my time in the Academy.

 My Summoning class was always interesting.  We learned to create
 protective circles and to bring forth all kinds of animals, demons and
 elementals from various planes.  It was important to keep control of
 the creatures that were summoned.  I had a really difficult Summoning
 assignment in my first year.

 A: That ruby ring gave me an advantage.

 artifacts.  We learned about the nature of reality and how our
 mystical energies were able to change the very fabric of existence.

 A: It was tremendously exciting and I was an apt pupil.
 B: A fifth year student sold me a potion that helped me to concentrate
 better in class.

 I was beginning to learn that the Academy was a very dangerous place.
 I had made it to my fourth year, but I was becoming less concerned

 Another accident took place in my Summoning class.  Some student had
 found access to the Archmage's personal library and learned a spell

 I remember that fateful day in my fourth year when all classes were
 cancelled.  Good King Norbert had died, Prince Gareth, who was 28
 years old at the time, was to be our new king.  All of the wizards of
 the Academy gathered for the coronation ceremony.  The royal wizard,
 Fraledan, smiled at the students from his place of honor near the
 prince and princess.  He held his gnarled wooden staff in his hands
 and smiled through his thick white beard.

 King Norbert's widow, Queen Audrey, looked very sad, she had obviously
 loved her husband very much. Princess Emily looked very sad as well.
 Her lightly curled brown hair lay across her shoulders and her deep
 brown eyes had a shine to them that showed she had been crying.
 Prince Gareth seemed eager to assume the crown, his dark gaze never
 left the official who was conducting the coronation.  After the
 ceremony, the festivities began.  I saw Archmage Lacius sitting with
 Fraledan for most of the celebration. Ciel, Lacius' familiar, was
 nowhere to be seen.  The raven was likely flying high in the sky and
 out of sight.

 A: My accomplishments had become known to a few nobles. (Needs 1 Fame)
 B: I watched Princess Emily.  She was very beautiful.
 C: I watched our newly appointed ruler, King Gareth, he was very
 handsome.
 D: I sat with my fellow students and enjoyed the festivities.

 to say hello. I was even given a gift by one of them.  It was a
 beautifully enchanted ring to enhance the bravery I had already shown.
 (Diplomacy +10, Gained Ring of Courage)

 Everyone was sad that King Norbert had died, he had been a good king.
 We all had great hopes for our new monarch, King Gareth.  The Kingdom
 of Daria waited in eager anticipation to see what kind of king he
 would be.

 My Illusion teacher took the occasion to implement a unique type of
 test.  Our class gathered that night to cast entertainments into the
 sky for everyone to enjoy.

 A: I created a spectacle of lights and sounds that was talked about
 for years.
 B: I made up a fake cultural reason to get out of doing it. (Needs 20

 C: I cheated by making a special mixture using fertilizer. (Needs 20

 D: I didn't even bother to try.

 but then I started getting creative, sending up displays of fairies,
 griffons and charging horses.  For my grand finale, I created a
 life-sized Illusion of the fierce dragon Parnaxxus.  Although everyone
 was terrified at first, when the dragon glowed brightly and exploded
 into thousands of twinkling lights, I was given an applause that
 thundered across the city.  It really helped the relationship between
 the royal family and the mage guild.

 My days in the Academy were numbered, I only had one more year after
 this one.  Perhaps this was the reason that I started thinking about
 romance.

 A: I was still madly in love with Generic Love Interest.
 B: Although I was dating Generic Love Interest, I was secretly in love
 with Tessa, my friend from the Academy.  I decided to break up with
 Generic Love Interest and follow my heart's true desire.

 Whatever the future after the Academy held in store and the challenges
 it would bring, I knew that it would be at her side.

 My studies in the tower didn't deal exclusively with magic.  The royal
 wizard, Fraledan, was a great example. As the court mage, he was
 constantly being relied upon to know about the world around him in
 order to effectively advise the king.  Sometimes a wizard's sagely
 knowledge was just as beneficial as their arcane power.

 doorkeeper came in to get a midnight snack. His small stature made him
 very quiet as he entered unobtrusively.

 "How are your studies going?" he asked me in a friendly tone.

 "They're going well, but I'm having some troubles with recursive
 enchantments."

 "There's a book in the Archmage's library that explains it really
 well.  Come along."

 I got up immediately, astounded by my luck.  He led me across the
 Academy and to the Archmage's quarters, the torchlight reflecting on
 his bald head. He opened the door to the library and we were just
 about to enter when he said that he had forgotten an important task
 that he needed to do.  I had no idea what he could have forgotten
 about, that late at night, but I said that it was alright.  He
 apologized and said that he'd get me the book the next day.  He closed
 the door and hurried away.  But, the door didn't latch.  It was
 ironic, considering that he was the doorkeeper.

 A: So, I went in.
 B: I closed the door and returned to my studies.

 door and slipped quietly inside. The library was very exciting and
 there was a wealth of information to be had.  I wondered why the books
 weren't available to everyone.  After skimming a few of them, I saw
 why.  They were dangerous!  The magic involved was intense and
 powerful.  One book in particular caught my eye.  It was a book about
 golemcraft. I knew I couldn't stay long, but the book showed how to
 make a golem that would serve its master forever.  And, the best thing
 was, I had access to the materials from my assorted classrooms.

 A: The temptation was too great, I took the book.
 B: The danger was too great, I put the book back and left.

 My Transmutation class was pretty boring, although it might just have
 been the teacher.  We always seemed to be doing the same things, turn
 a stone into bronze, then to iron, then to gold...  That might sound
 like it should have been financially lucrative, but it wasn't.  We
 used to spend hours to create the tiniest bit of gold from another
 material.  I think I could have made the same amount of money, for the
 time it took, working at a normal job.  I knew that Transmutation
 would eventually allow you to turn an enemy to stone, or to craft an
 item into giving it special powers, but that was very advanced magic.

 We were each given a finely crafted statue of King Gareth, at the
 beginning of the year.  They had all been sculpted from stone by very
 talented artisans.  Our task was to convert the statue into ruby, the
 royal gemstone.

 It was a nervous time for all students, when they reached the end of
 their fifth year.  The courses had been difficult, and although I had
 learned a lot of magic.  I was afraid of what my final grades would
 be.  I remember being called into Archmage Lacius' office to see my
 final evaluation.  Ciel, his raven, sat on a wooden stand in the
 corner as I looked over my grades.

 Final Transcript for Morgana
 Alchemy: Passed.
 Conjuration: Passed.
 Divination: Passed.
 Enchantment: Failed.
 Illusion: Passed.
 Summoning: Passed.
 Transmutation: Passed.

 My heart leaped into my throat.  I had failed and wouldn't be
 receiving my wizardly robes.

 "Chin up," Archmage Lacius said sternly.  "Remember, some of the
 greatest wizards in history have been unsuccessful in their schooling.
 You are still Academy trained and you shall find your place in the
 world."

 I remember packing up my bags, books and other belongings.  The
 Academy had been my home for five years and I was a little nervous
 about what the future held. At least I wouldn't be alone, Killah P, my
 dog, would be at my side. Even though I no longer had a schedule or
 teachers, my education as a wizard was farfrom over.  I would
 continued to grow and learn for the rest of my life.  I had a large
 decision to make: I had to decide if I would continue to be an
 illusionist or if I should generalize my studies.

 A: I decided to specialize.  I would become an illusionist
 B: I decided to diversify.  I would study all of the magical arts.

>a
 Twilight Sparkle, my horse, seemed eager to be on the road. Generic
 Love Interest and Tessa had traveled with me to my home village from
 the academy.  I was grateful for their companionship.

 I had a lot to think about, now that my life as a student was over.
 The next logical step for any wizard was to find traveling companions
 and set out on an adventure. I stayed a few weeks in my village, but I
 knew that this was no longer my home.  I tearfully said goodbye to
 everyone, explaining that I needed some time alone to find my place in
 the world.  I promised that I would send word as soon as I could. I
 mounted Twilight Sparkle and left my village.  My destiny awaited.

 I spent some time looking for a suitable adventuring party, which was
 more difficult than I had thought. I knew that I'd need a fighter, a
 thief and a cleric.  A strong fighter would keep the enemies away
 while I cast my magic, a dexterous thief would open locks and find
 traps, and a wise cleric would heal us all when trouble occurred.
 Even though I could do a little of each job, I knew that it was
 important to have specialists so that I could concentrate on my magic.
 After nearly a year of searching, I came upon the solution, I would
 form the party myself.  I rented a room at the Full Cup Inn in
 Tornassa and began to accept applicants. Generic Love Interest moved
 in with me and the innkeeper was nice enough to let us stay for free,
 provided that I promised to help with security or any other troubles
 that routinely cropped up.

 Our first job came to us where first jobs usually did.  We were
 sitting around the Full Cup Inn and drinking.  We were also discussing
 tactics, but often the useful conversation gave way to the useless
 after as the night wore on.  A caravan guard from a nearby town came
 into our tavern complaining that he had been robbed.  He said that a
 group of kobold bandits were charging people a toll for using a
 kingdom road.  It was a small band, so the royal guards hadn't been
 sent.  This was our chance to begin our new careers.  We left
 immediately.

 Twilight Sparkle, my horse, was very impatient at our slow moving.  I
 knew that we would have to get mounts for everyone eventually, if we
 wanted to take jobs that were further away.  We hadn't gone far down
 the forest road when five kobolds stepped in front of us.

 "Give us your money!" they exclaimed upon our arrival.

 We spent several days in the Full Cup Inn as we looked for our next
 job.  There was a dwarf shopkeeper who had a task for us, a couple of
 orcs had stolen his wife's diamond necklace.  We learned that the orcs
 had a camp just outside of Tornassa.

 It wasn't difficult to find the orc encampment.  We spoke to the three
 warriors who were living there and they said that they took the
 necklace because the dwarf owed them money for services that they had
 provided but hadn't been paid for.  They claimed to have been working
 as guards for the dwarf's store.  I wasn't sure about this
 arrangement, perhaps if they had been half-orcs it would have made
 sense, but full orcs were not reliable and likely wouldn't have been
 hired.

 A: I spoke to them, using our orc heritage as common ground.
 B: I felt that they deserved the necklace, so I told them so, even
 though it meant we would fail the quest. (Needs 20 Personality)
 C: I sent in Kal, the thief, to steal it back.  (Needs Thief Power 5)

 necklace. (Needs 30 Enchantment)

 (Conjuration +10)

 It was in my first year of adventuring that rumors about King Gareth's
 rule began surface.  I had a front-row seat for the event because we
 came across a job from his royal highness.  A bounty was posted for an
 escaped elf prisoner.  The 250 gold reward drew bounty hunters and
 adventurers from across the land, all of us hoping to capture the
 prisoner first.

 After a few days of searching Tornassa with no success, we tried a new
 tactic.

 since the Silver Sea was on the other side of Daria. We left
 immediately.

 It took us a few weeks to get there.  We got to see a lot of the
 country as we went and Twilight Sparkle, my warhorse, was happy to be
 moving at a decent speed.
 (Geography +10, Summoning +10)

 The smell of salt hung in the air as we arrived at the shores of the
 Silver Sea.  I saw large ships and the blue ocean for the first time
 in my life. We got to work, looking for the elf once again.  When we
 asked around, we were given very specific directions to a street down
 by the docks.  It seemed like our luck was with us.

 We went to the seaside and searched where we were told.  The alley was
 dark and smelled of fish.  I'll never forget seeing that enormous fist
 flying right toward my face!

 surrendering and calling for mercy.
 (Illusion +10)

 The sailors turned on the elf right away, telling us everything.  They
 had been hired to slow down any pursuers to allow him a chance to get
 away.  We went immediately to where we were told he could be found. We
 found him in a seaside bar called the Rusty Harpoon where the elf was
 sitting at a table and having a drink.

 followed along and did as he was told.  All we needed to do was return
 to Tornassa.
 (Enchantment +10)

 The return trip went better than I suspected.  I asked the elf
 prisoner why he had been locked up.

 "I honestly don't know," the elf said.  "I was the official ambassador
 to the elf nation, it makes no sense for your king to have thrown me
 in the dungeons."

 Memories of the elf attack on my village went through my head as he
 spoke.    I guessed that he must be connected in some way, despite
 what he claimed.

 to know a lot of things.
 (Geography +5, Diplomacy +10)

 We finally arrived in Tornassa.  It was good to be home.  We took the
 elf directly to the royal castle and were granted an immediate
 audience with King Gareth.  It had only been two years since the
 coronation, but it looked like he had aged ten years instead.  His
 hair was still black, but he had a weariness in his eyes that spoke of
 many sleepless nights.

 "Put the elf in the dungeons!" he screamed to his guards, spittle
 flying from his lips.

 He left without granting us a reward, but Wizard Fraledan was there to
 make things right.

 "Thank you for your service," the white bearded wizard said as he gave
 us our reward.

 We heard about the public execution a few days later and naturally we
 went.
 (Gold +250, Fame +1, Royal Faction +10, Kingdom Faction +20)

 It was a cold and wet day, but the courtyard was filled with people.
 There hadn't been an execution in Daria for nearly a hundred years.
 Many of the citizens thought that it was barbaric, but they came
 anyway to see history in the making.  King Gareth watched from his
 balcony, his black hair waving in the wind.  He didn't address the
 crowd, instead he simply watched the proceedings with his dark eyes.
 The elf was escorted to the noose by a pair of royal guards but no
 words were said as they put the rope around his neck.

 A: I called out, demanding to know what his crimes were.
 B: I was happy to see the elf die, since it was his kind that had
 attacked my village.  I started throwing rocks at him.
 C: I said nothing and simply watched.

>A
 dirty looks and King Gareth ignored me.  I didn't get my answer that
 day, but later that night, Wizard Fraledan came by the Full Cup Inn.
 His clean white beard lay across his chest as he clutched his wooden
 staff in his wrinkled hands.

 "The king doesn't sleep well," the kindly wizard explained.  "He often
 flies into rages.  The elf used to be the royal ambassador to the
 elfnation, but his imprisonment and execution had nothing to do with
 any of this. King Gareth had been eating in the throne room and had
 spilled a glass of wine across the front of his shirt.  The elf had
 laughed, so the king sent him to the dungeons the very next day."

 "Please, tell no one.  King Gareth is having his troubles, but he is
 still our king and the people need to believe in him.  These stories
 are making it very difficult."

 He left the Full Cup Inn, leaving me with many questions about our
 monarch.
 (Diplomacy +15, History +10, Mage Guild +10)

 We were very fortunate to have the patronage of the Full Cup Inn for
 our base of operations.  The deal was that we would help the owner if
 he ever ran into trouble.  We had been staying there for nearly a year
 before we were needed.  A group of fighters from the Fighters Guild
 were drinking and not paying.  They claimed that they were protecting
 the inn, but since this was our job, we knew they were lying.

 A: I cast an Illusion of filth over the place every time they entered.
 (Needs 25 Illusion)
 B: I poisoned their drinks, killing the entire group. (Needs 30
 Nature)
 C: I told them about a bar that they might like better. (Needs 30

 cheaper," I told them.

 It worked well, they left happy and we had our bar back.
 (Fighter Guild +15, Geography +10)

 One day, a richly dressed halfling purchased our services.

 "My family graveyard is no longer resting in peace.  Several of my
 deceased relatives have been seen wandering the grounds."

 Tessa, our cleric, was eager to go.  This was exactly the type of
 mission that religious people enjoyed so much.

 We looked over our equipment and trained our skills before we left.

 A: Equip Grom, the fighter.
 B: Equip Kal, the thief.
 C: Equip Tessa, the cleric.
 D: Train Grom myself. (Needs Fighting Skill)
 E: Train Kal myself. (Needs Thievery Skill)
 F: Train Tessa myself. (Needs Healing Skill)
 G: Journey onward.

 estate was just outside of Tornassa, so I left Twilight Sparkle, my
 warhorse, in the stables and we walked.  We found his home easily and
 went straight to the graveyard.  The mausoleum doors were locked, so
 we acquired a key and went inside.  We didn't go far before the first
 halfling zombies approached us.

 A: Tessa turned them. (Needs Cleric Power 4)
 B: I used my dark magic to bind the halflings to my will. (Needs 25

 C: I roasted the halfling zombies with flame. (Needs 20 Conjuration)

 bindings that had been used, everything was a potential learning
 experience.
 (Necromancy +5, Religion +5)

 We followed the corridor some more and found ourselves at a dead end.
 There didn't seem to be anywhere to go.  It didn't seem likely that we
 would be hired to get rid of a couple of zombies.

 A: I used my Divination to find the way. (Needs 20 Divination)
 B: I suspected something about the crypt. (Needs 25 Religion)
 C: I could sense something magical. (Needs 25 Arcana)
 D: We returned to the halfling who had hired us, unable to get any
 further into the crypt.

>a
 a section of the wall opened to reveal a dark corridor.
 (Divination +10)

 The corridor took us to a well-lit chamber.  I saw the markings on the
 floor and the walls, someone had been doing some very powerful magic.
 I immediately suspected Necromancy, someone was trying to raise the
 dead.  The focus of the power led me to the center of the designs
 where the mummified remains of a halfling lay.  He was still dead, but
 I wasn't sure for how much longer.  Suddenly, five other halflings
 burst into the crypt!  They were wearing priestly gowns and held long
 sharp knives.

 A: I took control of the dead halfling, raising him myself. (Needs 40
 Necromancy)
 B: I cast chain-lightning from my fingertips. (Needs 30 Conjuration)
 C: I summoned an ogre. (Needs 30 Summoning)
 D: I let Grom handle it. (Needs Fighter Power 5)
 E: I enchanted the cultists to fight each other. (Needs 30

 F: We ran away as fast as we could.

>go down
 (Fighting +10, Warcraft +5)

 The halfling who had hired us returned to the crypt.

 "I am ashamed to say that those cultists are relatives of mine," he
 said, his eyes on the dead halfling on the slab in front of us.  "This
 was my great-great-grandfather.  I believe that they were planning to
 raise him in order to to have him retroactively change his will and
 give the estate to their side of the family."

 "Please clean this up before you leave," he said as he handed over a
 large bag of gold and left the crypt.
 (Gold +180, Fame +1)

 A: I studied the undead halfling, curious as to the powers being used.
 B: Loot!  He had asked us to clean up, so I really cleaned up.
 C: I took the gold and left things where they were.  I wasn't a maid
 or an undertaker.
 D: I tidied up the crypt, being careful to leave all of the valuables
 with the deceased bodies.

 situation.  It took a few hours, but when I was done, the crypt looked
 clean and tidy.
 (Good +10)

 It was a nice sunny day when an old man came into the Full Cup Inn
 with a job for us.

 "My name is Gorion.  I'm a former member of the Thieves Guild," he
 told us.  "I need an escort out of Tornassa. I'll be honest with you,
 I stole a large sum of money from the guild and they are hunting me
 down."

 A: We did as he asked and tried to escape Tornassa.
 B: I cut his throat and took his stolen money for myself.
 C: We took him directly to the guild for a reward.

>a
 and it wouldn't be good to cross them, but the man was willing to pay,
 so we took the job.

 A: I cast an Illusion upon him. (Needs 30 Illusion)
 B: I knew the guild, so I went to the guild master to discuss
 leniency. (Needs 20 Thieves Guild Faction)
 C: I bribed every thief I saw on our way out of the city. (Needs 90

 D: We put a disguise on him and tried to get out of the city.

>a

 Tornassa.
 (Illusion +10)

 Gorion was happy that we had gotten him out of the city.

 "I used to be the guild's top poisoner, but it's a terrible line of
 work.  I'll use this money to retire. You know, I can offer you more
 than money."

 A: He taught me the Alchemy needed to brew poisons.
 B: He taught me the Healing needed to heal poisons.
 C: I didn't accept the trade.  I wanted money.
 D: I told him that no reward was necessary.

>b
 anti-venoms.  It was really good information to know.
 (Nature +15, Healing +15)

 I continued to hear terrible stories about King Gareth's reign.  He
 had raised taxes every year since he had come into power, but nobody
 knew where the money was going. Generic Love Interest, my girlfriend,
 heard that he was simply stockpiling it in his treasury for reasons
 that nobody knew.  Public executions became commonplace in the capital
 city, yet the dungeons were still overflowing with prisoners from
 everyone that the king had imprisoned.  Even the other nations around
 Daria were beginning to become leary of Daria's monarch.  People were
 already starting to call him the Mad King at that time.  It was a name
 that would be on everyone's lips as the years went on.

 We had a very surprising visitor enter the Full Cup Inn one day.  She
 was in disguise at first, asking for a private meeting.  We took her
 up to our rooms before she removed her disguise.  It was Princess
 Emily, the king's sister!  Now that she had removed her costume, I was
 surprised that I didn't recognize her beautiful deep brown eyes.

 "I'm afraid for my life," the princess stated bluntly as she flipped
 her long brown hair away from her slender neck.  "My brother has
 always been troubled, but since he gained the crown, his moods are
 even darker.  He's suspicious of everything and has been becoming
 increasingly cruel."

 "He's planning to kill me.  He doesn't want me to bear children, since
 he has no heirs of his own.  He's afraid that any child I have will
 become a threat to his reign."

 "I intend to go to the elves.  I know that they will grant me refuge
 in their forest."

 I said it was a bad idea, the elves couldn't be trusted since their
 attacks upon the kingdom.

 "This is different.  The circumstances surrounding those attacks were
 unique, the elves are actually very trustworthy.  Perhaps my presence
 there will also help to mend the bad blood between our nations.

 A: I decided to take Princess Emily to the elves.
 B: I decided not to help her.

 A: Equip Grom, the fighter.
 B: Equip Kal, the thief.

 G: Journey onward.

>again
 Alderheart Forest would take nearly a week.  Princess Emily was a good
 traveling companion, packing only what she could carry on one horse
 and leaving all of her royal retainers behind. Twilight Sparkle, my
 warhorse was happy to be moving and so were the horses that my
 companions were mounted upon.  It was a pleasant ride and I learned
 about many of the small villages in Daria.
 (Geography +3)

 We left Tornassa with no trouble, heading due east.  Princess Emily
 had done well, the king never knew she had left, so nobody chased us.
 We didn't travel far when we ran into trouble, a group of bandits
 surrounded us on the king's road itself. This was no small band of
 stupid kobolds, but instead, a pack of 20 well-armored and
 well-trained criminals.  It was another sign of the deteriorating
 state of the kingdom.

 A: I created a burst of fire to burn them all. (Needs 35 Conjuration)
 B: I created an Illusion of a large group of kingdom soldiers
 approaching. (Needs 25 Illusion.)
 C: I talked our way through.  (Needs 40 Personality)
 D: I rode Twilight Sparkle, my warhorse past the bandits.
 E: I cast an Enchantment spell that made them all forget what they
 were doing. (Needs 25 Enchantment)
 F: I surrendered, allowing the bandits to go through our gear.

>b
 all of the bandits.  Many of them dropped what they were holding as
 they scattered in every direction.  Princess Emily was very happy with
 my solution, since it had caused no bloodshed.
 (Royal Faction +10, Illusion +10)

 The remainder of the trip to the Alderheart went smoothly, the
 enormous ancient forest loomed up all around us as we entered. The
 path we took looked to be little more than an animal run, but Princess
 Emily assured us that it was the correct way.  We traveled for a few
 hours, the feeling of being observed was very strong.

 "Halt," a voice said from above.

 I looked up to see a dozen elves in the trees, many of them holding
 longbows.  I suspected that there were even more that we couldn't see.

 A: I used my skills as a former nature guide to impress the elves.
 B: I greeted them using the appropriate formalities. (Needs 30
 Diplomacy)
 C: I set fire to their trees, attempting to burn them all. (Needs 20
 Conjuration)
 D: I let Princess Emily speak for us.

>b
 someone knowledgeable about their heritage. The elves came down out of
 the trees and escorted us to their city.
 (Elf Faction +20, Diplomacy +10)

 The elven city was beautiful to behold, the trees themselves were
 enormous and ancient.  I had never seen anything like it, they were
 thicker than a man was tall and had shimmering silver leaves.  Wooden
 bridges and spiralling walkways connected platforms high above us and
 everywhere I looked, I saw beautiful elves.

 "Greetings and welcome to Oneiduin," the Elf Queen said graciously in
 elven.

 "Thank you," Princess Emily said, surprising me with her elven
 language skills.  "I am eternally grateful for your hospitality."

 The queen escorted the princess to her new home and we were taken to a
 set of rooms to stay in.  We stayed in Oneiduin for several weeks
 while the princess settled in.

 A: I spent the days talking to the elves and learning about their
 ways.
 B: I spoke with the elven spell-binders, learning about elven magic.
 C: I snuck around the elven city, stealing everything that wasn't
 nailed down. (Needs 30 Thievery)
 D: I spent the days hiding in my room and studying my magic, I didn't
 want anything to do with the elves.

>b
 their magic.  They were impressed with my own magic, which was growing
 very strong through all of my studying.
 (Alchemy +5,  Healing +5, Summoning +5, Transmutation +10)

 Near the end of my stay with the elves, I found Princess Emily alone
 in one of the gardens.  The flowers were in bloom and she was looking
 very pretty.  She looked melancholy and sad as she sat on a wooden
 bench among the green foliage.

 A: I flirted with the princess. (Needs 40 Personality)
 B: I talked to her and tried to cheer her up.
 C: I called her a coward for leaving the kingdom.

>b
 together in the garden and became friends.
 (Personality +5, Royal Faction +10)

 One day, I was approached by the elf queen herself.  She had heard
 that my village had been one of those attacked by the elves and she
 wanted to explain why.

 "It started with a band of kingdom loggers," she explained in her
 melodious voice.  "They were plying their trade too deeply into the
 Alderheart.  We sent messengers to King Norbert, but he refused to do
 anything about it.  Numarri, an elf-lord, was the one wholed the
 attacks on the kingdom without my consent."

 "To make matters worse, I later learned that King Norbert had been
 lied to by one of his dukes, he never knew just how deep the logging
 had been.  The duke was executed and Numarri was stripped of his
 titles.  The king and I were both ashamed over the incident, but we
 have since put it behind us."

 "The logging boundaries not only protect our forests, but it also
 protects the loggers themselves.  That particular incursion had come
 perilously close to intruding upon a magical moon glade of enormous
 power."

 The conversation continued in other directions after that.  Naturally,
 my wizardly mind returned to the concept of a mystical glade of great
 power.

 A: My curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to see this glade
 with my own eyes.
 B: I hated the elves for what they had done to my village, so I
 decided to go to the glade and see if I could damage it in some way.
 C: I decided to stay away from the glade.

>a
 regret my decision, but I was intensely interested in such a mystical
 phenomena.

 A: I used my magic sight to uncover the location of the glade. (Needs
 30 Divination)
 B: I asked a few friendly elves where it was.  (Needs 30 Elf Faction)
 C: I studied a map and figured it out.  (Needs 25 Geography)
 D: I tracked the elves to the glade.  (Needs 35 Nature)
 E: I followed my sensing of the magic.  (Needs 30 Arcana)
 F: I had Killah P, my canine friend, sniff out the way.
 G: I had no idea where the moon glade was.

>f
 wanted to go.
 (Geography +10)

 I left the elf city and traveled into the woods.  The moon was my only
 light as I made my way through the ancient trees.  It took a little
 time, but I soon found the glade.  A shimmering pool of magical water
 glowed in front of me.  It was the same colour as the moon itself.
 This was the infamous moon glade I had heard about.  I knew I didn't
 have a lot of time so I would have to be quick.

 A: I took a sample of the glowing water and drank some myself.
 B: I bathed in the magical waters.
 C: I stood in it to my ankles, getting my boots wet.
 D: I analyzed the water, hoping to glean some insights about its
 magical nature.
 E: I did nothing but admire its beauty.

 within the mystical pool.  I could feel the magic washing over me,
 erasing all tensions, healing all wounds.  I felt amazing when I came
 out.
 (Body +20, Nature +15)

 I stood before the moonglade, awed by its power and majesty.

 A: I left the glade as I found it, respecting the elves and forgiving
 them for what they had done to my village.
 B: I desecrated the moon glade as best I could, hoping it would
 greatly hurt the elves.

>a
 weren't perfect, but they were trying and I couldn't hold the rest of
 them at fault for the deeds of a few.  I felt much more at peace when
 I returned to the city.
 (Elf Faction +50, Good +3)

 It was soon time to go, Princess Emily was settled into her new home
 and I was no longer needed. The elves were very gracious and honored
 me with many praises when I left.  I would never forget my time among
 them. We returned to Tornassa, leaving the princess behind.
 (Geography +5)

 The princess offered us our reward for helping her to escape her
 brother.

 A: I accepted the reward.
 B: I demanded more money, after all, what I had done would be
 considered treason.
 C: I told her that no reward was necessary.

>c
 were also impressed by my act of kindness.
 (Royal Faction +20, Elf Faction +10, Good +20)

 Rumours of the princess having left the castle were rampant when I
 returned.  Luckily, King Gareth never connected it to myself or my
 party.  It was easy to see that the princess was correct, had she
 stayed, she likely would have been imprisoned or killed.

 Four years went by as we continued to do various jobs for various
 clients.  We were slowly growing in fame and reputation.

 A: I continued my studies as an illusionist. (Current Skill: 67)
 B: I continued to study a little bit of everything.

 I wasn't the only one who used my spare time to improve my skills.

 all did well:

 improved.

 King Gareth's atrocities grew as the Kingdom of Daria continued to
 fall apart.  I saw more beggars and homeless people on the streets
 than ever before.  Rumours of Princess Emily's exile gave the people
 hope, especially when gossip began to proclaim that she had married
 her childhood sweetheart, Duke Peter, and had a child with him. This
 was monumental.  The current heir to the throne was now living in
 exile with the elves.

 It was probably for this very reason that the king married.  The new
 queen was a young woman named Janice.  We continued to work out of the
 Full Cup Inn as the years passed, taking on many adventuring jobs and
 building a name for ourselves.

 I was 30 years old when I got a royal summons to meet King Gareth, who
 was now 40.

 We looked over our equipment and trained our skills before we left.

 A: Equip Grom, the fighter.
 B: Equip Kal, the thief.
 C: Equip Tessa, the cleric.
 D: Train Grom myself. (Needs Fighting Skill)
 E: Train Kal myself. (Needs Thievery Skill)
 F: Train Tessa myself. (Needs Healing Skill)
 G: Journey onward.

>again

 I was nervous, at first, afraid he had found out that I knew about
 Princess Emily's escape nine years ago. That wasn't the case at all, I
 learned when I arrived.  The king met with me in his private chambers,
 just the two of us.  His eyes had an intensity to them that was
 unnerving.

 A: I found the king very attractive, so I flirted with him. (Needs 40
 Personality)
 B: I met him formally as my king.

>b
 and waited to hear why he had called me here. He then started to
 explain, very frankly, that Queen Janice would not give him an heir.
 He explained that he wanted me to use magic to help her carry his
 baby.  I asked why he didn't go to Fraledan, he said that he had, but
 the old wizard was a traditionalist and had never studied the Healing
 magics needed.

 A: I had just the Healing spell needed, I agreed to do the task.
 (Needs 25 Healing)
 B: I could use my Necromancy to bolster the child's lifeforce until it
 was born. (Needs 25 Necromancy)
 C: I didn't know any magic that would help, but I promised to look
 into it.
 D: I refused to help him.

>c
 researched the problem and eventually came up with the magic needed.
 It was a talented piece of sorcery, I was growing greatly in power, to
 be able to offer a solution that Fraledan could not.  I returned to
 the king with the answer to his problem.
 (Healing +5, Nature +5, Royal Faction +10)

 The next day, I was taken to Queen Janice herself.  She hardly spoke
 to me as I set up the magic I would need to help her carry a baby to
 term.  Once everything was in place, I began to cast. The magic worked
 flawlessly as it flowed directly into the queen.  It worked so well,
 that I was confident that she would get pregnant immediately and have
 a baby in nine months.

 The king and queen thanked me for my services.  It was somewhat odd,
 since they had no proof that my magic had done the deed.  Nine months
 later, the queen had a little boy, Prince Eric, the new heir to the
 throne.

 A few months after Prince Eric was born, Princess Emily and her small
 family moved back into the royal castle.  Now that the king had an
 heir of his own, the princess and her son were no longer in danger.
 The people of the kingdom were very happy, everyone hoped that two
 princes and the renewal of the royal family would mean that the
 troubled days were over. They were all wrong, of course, things got
 even worse.

 Nearly a year after I was called to King Gareth's private room and
 given my reward in secret.  Nobody knew that I was the one responsible
 for the queen's ability to have a baby.
 (Gold +300, Royal Faction +15)

 A stocky dwarf came into the Full Cup Inn and hired us a few months
 later.  He said that his brethren under the Grey Mountains had
 tunneled too deep and had awoken something ancient and evil.  It was
 an old tale, almost a cliche, but there it was.

 We rode north toward the Grey Mountains.
 (Geography +3)

 We arrived at the foothills of the Grey Mountains in the late fall of
 that year.  I was worried about the weather, afraid that one good
 snowfall might trap us for the entire winter, but we ventured forward
 anyway.  Our dwarf guide led us through a grand arch and deep into the
 mountain.

 "Welcome!" the Dwarf Chief said in a deep voice as he smiled at us
 through his thick beard.  "We have no time to waste.  The blasted
 monster has stopped all mining and production."

 He gave us maps to follow the mine shafts to where they had
 encountered the beast.  We spent the night in the dwarven halls and
 left the very next day.

 A: My Divination magic led us there unerringly. (Needs 35 Divination)
 B: I knew a little about underground phenomena. (Needs 40 Nature)
 C: Although the map was subterranean, the principles were the same.
 (Needs 30 Geography)
 D: We got miserably lost.

>c
 'down' notation.
 (Geography +10, Nature +5)

 The mineshaft had indeed broken into a much older tunnel.  The dead
 bodies of dwarves could be seen scattered all about, the monster had
 killed a great number of them.  We proceeded forward cautiously, but
 didn't have to go far before we found it.  It stood an easy fifteen
 feet tall, it had large horns in its head and thick leathery skin all
 over its body.  Its eyes seemed to have flames dancing in them as it
 approached us, ready for the kill.

 A: I battled the creature with my strongest fireballs. (Needs 40
 Conjuration)
 B: I summoned a demon to fight for us. (Needs 30 Summoning)
 C: I hid a vast canyon under an Illusion. (Needs 35 Illusion)
 D: I had read about such a beast, I knew its limitations. (Needs 35

 E: Grom charged the beast. (Needs Fighter Power 6)
 F: We had no choice but to run away, returning to the Dwarf Chief.

>go east
 versus tooth.  I sent a few small pieces of magic into the fray, but I
 had to be careful to not distract Grom.  In the end, the beast was
 killed.
 (Fighting +5, Warcraft +5)

 We returned through the tunnels, eventually finding our way back to
 the dwarven Great Hall.  The Dwarf Chief himself met us. He was
 overwhelmed with joy at our success!  He hugged each of us with his
 thick arms, lauging as he did so.

 "Wonderful!" he exclaimed.  "We'll be telling your tale for years to
 come!"

 The dwarves held a great feast in our honor.  They were very happy and
 pleased to give us a substantial reward.

 A: I accepted the reward.
 B: I demanded that they give us more, it had been a very difficult
 battle. (Needs 40 Personality)
 C: I declined the reward.

>c
 gold, so they were more than happy to keep it.
 (Dwarf Faction +40, Good +15, Fame +1)

 We left the dwarven kingdom and headed to Tornassa.

 The next summer proved to be very dry and hot, all across Daria,
 farmers were having trouble with their crops.  It wasn't a
 full-fledged drought or famine, but it was a difficult year.  A few
 towns and villages were hit worse than others, including my home
 village.  I heard about their troubles from a letter I received from
 the mayor.  It wasn't one of our regular jobs, but I took it anyway.

 Twilight Sparkle, my warhorse was happy to be moving, so were the
 other mounts that the rest of my party were riding. It was an
 enjoyableride as we traveled back to my home village.
 (Geography +3)

 Elmvale was much smaller than I had remembered it, I had seen many
 great things since I had been there last. The beautiful river that ran
 through my village was all dried up.

 We were given a room in the local tavern. We sat down with the mayor
 later that night to talk business. He said that the temple had used up
 all of their funds to help pay for food, but it wasn't going to be
 enough.

 A: I brewed many potions which would allow the crops to grow with very

 (Good +15, Fame +1)

 My party and I packed our bags and left my small village.

 I was 32 years old when the great dragon Parnaxxus renewed his
 terrible wrath upon the land.  King Gareth's reign was tearing the
 kingdom apart and the dragon was decimating what was left.  The
 Fighters Guild did very well through these years, gaining many
 contracts to defend villagers and merchants from the mighty beast.
 Grom, a dues paying member of the guild, was approached by the guild
 leader for a lucrative contract. Our fighter wasn't hired away from
 our party, instead, the entire party was offered a job.

 The guild hall in Tornassa had grown rich from the fear Parnaxxus was
 instilling in the land, even though the fighters who were hired out
 could do little against the mighty beast.  The guild leader brought
 the entire party into his office and told us what he needed.  A mighty
 wizard had hired the Fighters Guild to protect him against Parnaxxus.
 The guild sent a dozen fighters, but when the dragon attacked his
 tower, all twelve fighters were killed and the tower was laid to
 waste.  The contract was fulfilled, the fighters had fought to the
 best of their abilities, but the mage refused to pay.  The Mage Guild
 refused to get involved. We were to speak to the mage and get the 1000
 gold that was owed to the Fighters Guild.

 far from Tornassa, so we walked. Parnaxxus had really decimated the
 poor man's residence, broken equipment, scattered herbs and bricks lay
 everywhere.

 (Fighters Guild -5)

 I remember the historical day when the entire Kingdom shook from an
 enormous earthquake, even though it wasn't until weeks later that the
 results were known.  A small village named Scone, in southern Daria,
 had suddenly started being attacked from within.  Their temple had
 begun to spew forth all manner of foul beasts. Many adventuring
 parties took it upon themselves to investigate the tunnels below.
 This vast dungeon soon became known as the Abyss.

 We didn't try our luck until nearly halfway into our adventuring
 career, many years after the monsters had appeared.  We didn't want to
 be just another party of adventurers defeated deep beneath the ground.
 We decided that the time was right for our party to test its skills
 against the great dungeon.  The only other challenge that took every
 member of my party's skill into account was when we met Parnaxxus, but
 that didn't happen until much later.

 Twilight Sparkle, my warhorse was happy to be moving, so were the
 other mounts that the rest of my party were riding. It was a nice ride
 as we traveled to the small village of Scone.
 (Geography +3)

 The village of Scone had made the best of a bad situation.  Over the
 years, they had built a thriving community around the Abyss.
 Weaponsmiths, inns, taverns and general stores catered to the
 adventurers.  They purchased the loot that came from the dungeon and
 sold new equipment to parties who needed things.

 great Abyss through the front temple doors, at first, we didn't see
 anything besides broken pews and the old altar.  We cautiously made
 our way forward to the catacombs beneath.  So far, it didn't seem very
 dangerous.  But, everyone knew that the deeper an intrepid adventurer
 went, the stronger the danger and greater the reward.  We were broken
 from our thoughts by the sound of a group of skeletons approaching.

 had a cleric in our group.  Tessa was eager to call to her Gods and
 smite the skeletons.  They collapsed almost immediately.  Kal was
 quick to go through the bone fragments for treasure. It was grisly
 work, looting the undead corpses, but we found many valuables.  After
 we had finished taking everything of value, we continued deeper into
 the Abyss.
 (Gold +135, Healing +5, Religion +5)

 The catacombs had very little dust or spider webs on them, which
 wasn't really surprising, considering how many adventurers passed
 through every day.  We found a rickety old wooden staircase and
 descended down into the Abyss.  The wood looked old and ancient, we
 didn't get very far when something happened.

 had failed us.

 stood back and watched as his deft hands quickly disarmed each of
 them. We were pleasantly surprised to find a locked treasure chest
 tucked in behind the traps.  Kal picked the lock and we claimed our
 reward before pressing forward.
 (Gold +190, Thievery +10)

 There was a solid stone staircase with a light trace of moss that led
 us down to the next level.  The hall was covered in the same green
 fuzz as the steps.  I cast a spell to create a small ball of light and
 was surprised to see the spell fizzle and the moss glow brightly.  I
 knew that my magic wouldn't be useful until we left the area.  Almost
 immediately, we were attacked by a band of lizardmen!

 A: Grom fought them off. (Needs Fighter Power 6)
 B: With my magic out of commission and our fighter being unable to
 stop the attack, we had to leave.

>a
 Luckily, Grom had no such concerns. I watched as his Sword of Death
 ended the life of each lizardman that approached.  When it was over,
 we were able to proceed forward. The lizardmen had coin purses and
 wore various jewelry that would fetch a decent price when we returned.
 We collected our reward before going onward.
 (Gold +215, Fighting +5, Warcraft +5)

 I was pleased to see that the magic-leaching moss ended at the next
 staircase.  As we descended, the hairs on my arms stood up, I could
 feel great magic ahead of us.  Gem-filled runes glowed along the wall
 and floor ahead of us, but a shimmering wall of force prevented us
 from going forward.

 A: I used my knowledge of magic to dispel the barrier.  (Needs 30

 down the barrier.  It felt good, I felt that I had done my duty as the
 party's wizard. It was easy to pry the gems free from the runes and I
 knew they would fetch a good price.
 (Gold +285)

 I knew that we were starting to get somewhere.  I was quite certain
 that most other parties didn't have the ability to get as far as we
 did.  Once again, there was only one direction worth pursuing,
 straight down.  This time, the staircase went deeper than we had
 suspected until the glow of magma could be seen all around us.  The
 heat and poisonous gas was extremely thick.

 A: I used my Healing magic to allow us to go further. (Needs 30
 Healing)
 B: I transmuted our flesh into something that could handle the heat.
 (Needs 30 Transmutation)
 C: I crafted a potion of heat resistance. (Needs 35 Alchemy)
 D: We all touched the ruby ring.
 E: We had reached the end of the line, the heat was too intense to
 continue.

 continued to go deeper.  Using my magic, I also hid the pain, to allow
 us to function better.
 (Healing +10)

 We continued going down, further than anyone had ever gone before.
 Finally, we arrived at the heart of the Abyss.  An enormous throne had
 been built from the skulls and bones of failed adventurers and sitting
 upon it was a ferocious demon with blood red skin.  His dark black
 hair stood out in contrast from his bright red skin and his muscles
 rippled as he moved.  My demonology classes hadn't prepared me for
 such a sight.  I wasn't certain if he was a true demon, an evil God or
 something else entirely.  He began to clap as we arrived, but before
 he could explain his presence, he attacked!

 A: I conjured a great blast of ice.  (Needs 45 Conjuration)
 B: A throne of skulls was foolish, if you faced a necromancer.  (Needs
 45 Necromancy)
 C: I summoned a bigger demon.  (Needs 45 Summoning)
 D: I crafted a clever Illusion  (Needs 45 Illusion)
 E: We ran away as fast as we could.

 monster in front of me.  He became enraged and attacked it, smashing
 himself into the solid rock.  I moved my Illusion around, causing the
 demon to continue to smash at the rock.  The cave in occurred almost
 immediately, burying him under an enomormous pile of rock.
 (Illusion +10)

 We had done it, we had beat the Abyss!  I never learned the true
 nature of the beast, but the monsters stopped coming forth.  We were
 praised as heroes upon our return, but the best part was all of the
 treasure we found. We found gold, gems and jewelry galore.  But one of
 my party members noticed something special among the treasure.

 A: Tessa noticed an ancient holy symbol of enormous power.
 B: Kal noticed a shimmering cloak.
 C: Grom noticed a shiny gold ring.

 was unmistakable.  I took it and put it in my pocket, intending to
 give it to Tessa when I got a chance.

 We left Scone and returned to Tornassa, our fame traveling faster than
 we did.  When we returned to the Full Cup Inn, it was full of people
 wishing to congratulate us.  Our time toiling away in obscurity was
 over.

 Needless to say, I spent a lot of time with Generic Love Interest

 Even though I was now married, things went back to normal fairly
 quickly.  Considering the fact that we were already living together in
 the Full Cup Inn, our wedding didn't change very much.

 The years continued to pile up behind me.  I knew that wizards were
 supposed to be old, but as time wore on, I began to fit the mold.  My

 I was forty years old when Queen Janice died.  King Gareth seemed to
 not care at all, at least that was the public opinion of the matter.
 Terrible rumors even circulated that he had something to do with the
 queen's death.  Their nephew, Prince Travis was 19 years old.  Luckily
 for him and his mother, Princess Emily, Prince Eric was alive and
 healthy.  Since he was the uncontested heir to the throne, Prince
 Travis and his family were safe.

 The Kingdom of Daria was in a terrible mess as everything seemed to be
 falling apart.  It was no wonder that the orcs decided to launch a
 major offensive upon seeing that Daria was so weak.  The white bearded
 wizard, Fraledan himself, came to me requesting help.

 "It's good to see you again, Morgana," he said, treating me like an
 equal as he leaned on his wizardly staff.  "I need you and your
 companions to bring a treaty to the Orc Chieftain.  It has many
 concessions in it, but it's fair and it should stop the orcs from
 invading."

 It was a sad time for the kingdom of Daria, but we really had no
 choice.  We weren't prepared for war and the advantages that the
 treaty would give the orcs was the only way to stop an invasion.

 A: I accepted the task.
 B: I turned down the task.

>a
 said with a smile. Twilight Sparkle, my warhorse was happy to be
 moving, so were the other mounts the rest of my party was riding. It
 was a terrifyingjourney into the far west and into orc territory.
 (Geography +3)

 We left the Kingdom of Daria behind as we traveled toward the west and
 into orc territory, I was very excited to see my ancestral home.  Even
 though half-orcs were shunned by pure orcs, it would still be good to
 see where I had come from.

 We were deep into the wilderness when we stumbled upon something
 entirely different.  The trees had become older and older with each
 step and the forest was teeming with wildlife.  We were far from the
 orc homeland still, but as we passed through a circle of mushrooms, we
 began to see strange things.  Little people, similar to elves but much
 smaller, danced all around us. One of them came forward and asked for
 aid.  She wore a tiny little dress and her diminutive shoes were
 pointed.  She said that a 'monster' had attacked their forest home.
 We went to check it out.

 The creature was enormous, larger than any boar I'd ever heard of.  It
 looked badly diseased, its eyes were bleeding and its fur was all
 matted with filth.  I would have guessed that it was undead, a zombie
 of some type, but my arcane skills told me that no Necromancy was
 involved.  It was corrupted and far from natural, my best guess was
 that it was the result of some magical experiment.  The moment it saw
 us, it charged.

 A: Grom defended us well. (Needs Fighter Power 6)
 B: I shot a spark of fire toward the creature. (Needs 45 Conjuration)
 C: I sidestepped the creature without looking up. (Needs 45
 Divination)
 D: Killah P, my dog, attacked the boar.
 E: Tessa saved the day. (Needs Cleric Power 6)
 F: We were lucky to get away with our lives.

 ground.  Luckily, Tessa cast her healing magic upon me while Kal
 struck it across the back.  I got back on my feet, shaking off what
 could have been a mortal wound.
 (Healing +5, Religion +5)

 The corrupted beast roared in pain, but the fight wasn't over yet.  It
 charged a second time, this time, directly at me.

 A: I bathed the creature in fire. (Needs 50 Conjuration)
 B: I turned the creature into stone. (Needs 35 Transmutation)
 C: I reacted physically, forgetting to use my magic. (Needs 50

 D: I drained the creature of its lifeforce. (Needs 50 Necromancy)
 E: I healed the beast. (Needs 40 Healing)
 F: I froze in panic, just standing there.

 good idea about how to stop it.  I used my magic to remove the taint,
 turning the boar back into a normal creature.  The boar wandered away,
 no longer a threat.
 (Healing +10, Nature +10, Good +15)

 The fey creatures were very happy with us, the evil creature was gone
 and they were safe.  There had to be a thousand of them living there,
 not all of them were small.  I saw nymphs, dryads, pixies, brownies
 and all other types of nature creatures.  The small fey fairy whom had
 requested our aid came forward with a reward.

 A: I was presented with a bundle of herbs and plants that could make
 the most deadly poisons.
 B: I was presented with a bundle of herbs and plants that could make
 the most beneficial cures.
 C: I told them that no reward was necessary.

 We arrived at the great orc city.  It wasn't really a city, but more
 of a collection of orc tribes.  They had pelt houses and wooden
 enclosures that stretched across the wilderness.  They were a rough
 species, but they allowed us to pass with only a few bad words and
 dirty looks.  We stopped at an inn to rest before presenting ourselves
 to the Orc Chieftain.

 "You must be the great wizard I had heard about," the Orc Chieftain
 said to me when we arrived.

 I gave him the peace treaty that Fraledan had given us.

 "You will stay with us and bring back my reply."

 The enormous orc warrior waved to his attendents who led us to a tent
 for us to stay in.

 The days passed as I stayed with the orcs.

 A: I found myself more accepted than I thought I would.
 B: I understood why half-orcs were driven from the orc lands.

 The more time I spent among them, the more I realized that this didn't
 have to be the way.  They were dangerous and aggressive at times, but

 (Fighting +10, Body +3, Warcraft +10, Orc Faction +10)

 A few weeks later I was called back into the Orc Chieftain's tent.  He
 seemed very unsure of himself, obviously enjoying the concessions made
 within the treaty, but also wanting to continue with the invasion.

 A: I smoothed over any last uncertainties, paving the way for peace.
 (Needs 40 Diplomacy)
 B: I talked him into signing it. (Needs 40 Personality)

 Fraledan seemed tired and sad when we returned.  He leaned heavily
 upon his old staff and his eyes had bags under them.  He was happy
 that the treaty had been accepted, but he knew that the concessions
 would weaken Daria even more.  He gave us our reward for a job well
 done.
 (Fame +1, Gold +175)

 I was reading an old dusty tome when I had a surprise visitor at the
 Full Cup Inn.

 "Good morning, Morgana, I'm glad to see that you've continued to work
 on your magic."

 It was Master Durgan, the doorkeeper of the Academy!  I hadn't seen
 him in a long time but he hardly seemed to have changed at all.  He
 greeted me warmly as though the many years since I had failed to
 graduate didn't exist.

 "I'm afraid this isn't a social call," he said, bowing his bald head.
 "We need your help."

 wrongness the instant we arrived at the Academy.

 "Archmage Lacius took ill a few weeks before the incidents began,"
 Master Durgan explained.

 "What incidents?" I asked.

 Instead of telling me, he showed me.  He muttered the magic words and
 waved his hands in intricate mystical designs.  I recognized the
 simple spell and knew that it should have created a small ball of
 light.  Instead of creating a soft illumination, it changed into
 something completely different.  The very fabric of reality was torn
 in front of me and a sharp toothed demon stepped forth!  Master Durgan
 was ready for it and cracked its head open with his staff.

 "This is happening with any spell cast near the Academy," Master
 Durgan explained.  "They change into a Summoning spell.  The greater
 the magic, the greater the demon summoned.  The first summonings had
 been particularly destructive since the mages had tried to defend
 themselves with magic, which only made things worse."

 A: I asked to see Archmage Lacius.
 B: I experimented by casting various spells.

 researching.

 either.

 "What has happened?" he asked as he sat up.

 Master Durgan breathed a sigh of relief and gave me a grateful look.
 (Healing +15, Mage Guild +10)

 Together, Master Durgan and myself told the Archmage all about the
 misdirection of magic and the state of the Academy.  It took a few
 days to guess the cause, but after some investigation, we learned that
 an artifact had recently been seen in Master Ballin's room.  It had
 arrived at about the same time that the magic started to go astray.
 It was a longshot, but I went to his room to see if there was any
 connection.

 I opened the door to the Master's room and saw the Golden Apple of
 Dischord sitting on the bed.  There was no question that it was this
 artifact that was causing all of our troubles.

 A: I smashed the apple against the wall.
 B: I blackmailed Master Durgan, demanding a large reward for the
 solution to his problem.
 C: I hid the apple somewhere even better, knowing that it would bring
 down the Academy.

>a
 fell slowly to the ground, glowing as they drifted through the air.  I
 watched as the shards slowly lost their glow and realized immediately
 that the curse had been lifted.
 (Mage Guild +10)

 The door to the room opened and the owner of the apple walked in.  I
 recognized Master Ballin, although he had never taught me during my
 time in the Academy.

 "What is the meaning of this?" he exclaimed.

 "I destroyed your artifact," I informed him bluntly.  "Why did you do
 it?"

 Master Ballin gave a deep sigh before he spoke.  "The Academy is
 corrupt.  I should be Archmage, but instead, they picked  Lacius.
 It's ridiculous, he has no vision and avoids making the decisions that
 could make the Academy a place of legend."

 "So yes, I poisoned the fool and activated the Apple of Dischord.
 Once the Academy was in ruin, I was going to come to the rescue and be
 named the new Archmage."

 A: I attempted to take him to Master Durgan.
 B: I decided to blackmail him in return for not turning him in.
 C: I let him go.

>a
 alive?"

 The words of his spell tumbled quickly from his lips as sparks danced
 between his fingers.  The lightning arced out and I felt myself
 falling to the floor as the electricity washed over me.

 A: I cast my own lightning right back at him.  (Needs 60 Conjuration)
 B: I forced him to stop attacking  (Needs 50 Enchantment)
 C: I forced myself to stay conscious.  (Needs 35 Willpower or 40 Body)
 D: I woke up in the Academy infirmary the next day.

>c
 flowed through me, but I kept my wits. When his spell concluded, I had
 enough presence of mind to blast him with a simple force spell.  He
 flew backward into the wall, not expecting it, and was knocked out.
 (Fighting +15 and Willpower +3)

 I took him to Master Durgan and Archmage Lacius, who were overjoyed
 that I had not only saved the Archmage, but had also found the source
 of their problems and rectified the situation.

 "You saved the Academy," Master Lacius said solemnly.

 "I told you that this one was special," Master Durgan said with a
 friendly smile.

 They took Master Ballin into custody and set out criers to let the
 Academy know that the magical siege of their spells was over. Archmage
 Lacius put his arm around me and smiled happily.  He told me that I
 would make a great Archmage someday, despite the fact that I hadn't
 graduated. They noticed that I didn't have a Wizard Staff of my own,
 so they gave me one.  It was made from solid oak and felt very good in
 my hands.  They also gave me a wonderful present.  It was a tome of
 ancient magic, detailing many glyphs, runes and ley lines.  I knew
 that it must have come from the Archmage's personal library.  I
 thanked them and went on my way.
 (Arcana +25, Fame +1, Mage Guild +30, Gained Wizard's Staff)

 I remember when a finely dressed human came into the Full Cup Inn to
 hire us for a specific job.

 "I am Thaddeus Burrmont," the dandy said.  "I have spent a lot of
 money to purchase the location of a powerfully enchanted weapon.  My
 offer is simple, I give you the location, you get me the weapon and
 keep all of the other treasure."

 It was an excellent proposal, so I took the deal.

 We had an enjoyable ride, Twilight Sparkle enjoyed being outside and
 the horses of the other party members moved quickly.
 (Geography +3)

 We followed the road toward the destination marked on the map, a small
 cove in the far east along the shores of the Silver Sea. It was
 somewhere around the halfway mark that a very strange thing happened.
 We had a nice campsite alongside the road and it was my turn keeping
 watch.  There was a soft silvery glow on the edge of the campfire's
 light, when out stepped a miraculous creature straight from legend.
 At first, I thought it was a white horse, but the single horn on its
 forehead and fluffy white wings made me realize it was something
 special, a flying unicorn.

 A: I approached it, hoping to befriend it.
 B: I killed it, wondering what type of treasure it would have.
 C: I watched it in awe.

>a
 to the air, finding my presence intolerable.  I believe that it was my
 lack of purity that caused the unicorn to flee.
 (Nature +10)

 We arrived at the shores of the Silver Sea, finding the location
 marked on the map.  The X seemed to indicate an area just a few
 hundred meters offshore of a small town called Opal's Cove.

 A: I hired a boat to take us out there, it was very expensive. (Needs
 345 Gold)
 B: I summoned a dolphin to carry me. (Needs 40 Summoning)
 C: I gave up and went home.

>a
 ridiculous fee.  He knew I was stuck, so he took advantage of the
 situation.  I had no choice, so I paid the man and he rowed us out
 until we were floating over the approximate location.
 (Gold -345)

 It just looked like a lot of water to me.  I knew I needed a way to go
 underneath the waves and find the shipwreck.

 A: I used my magic to grow a pair of gills.  (Needs 35 Transmutation)
 B: I conjured air, lots of it.  (Needs 60 Conjuration)
 C: I simply stopped breathing.  (Needs 45 Necromancy)
 D: I used a potion of Water Breathing  (Needs 35 Alchemy)
 E: I was close to the treasure, but I had no way to go down and get
 it.

>a
 I panicked and fell into the water, which instantly fixed the problem
 as my newly formed gills were able to draw oxygen from the water.  I
 bubbled a sigh of relief and swam down into the dark blue depths.
 (Transmutation +10)

 It was difficult to see, but I managed.  Once I reached the sea's
 floor, I looked around for the wreckage.  I had to circle outward for
 a few minutes until I saw some old timbers embedded in the sand and
 covered in seaweed.  Once I found some of the debris, it was easy for
 me to find the rest of the shipwreck.  Most of the equipment was
 rusted and worthless, but I found a large treasure chest in what had
 been the captain's room.  I grabbed it and took it back up to the
 surface.  It was a lot of work, swimming with the chest, but I did it.

 After I had lugged the treasure chest to shore, Kal picked open the
 lock.  We eagerly looked inside and were surprised to find only a
 single item.

 A: The legendary Sword of Death
 B: The legendary Holy Mace
 C: The legendary Dagger of Sharpness

 It was sad to see such a legendary weapon go, but a deal was a deal.
 Word spread about what we had done and we gained a lot of positive
 reputation from the experience.

 One day, Generic Love Interest asked me point blank if I wanted to

 I remember a very difficult situation between the Thieves Guild and
 the Fighters Guild.  It started with a simple hiring, a merchant
 needed some mercenaries to protect his stores from robbers, so he
 hired the Fighters Guild. The problem was, a rival merchant had hired
 the Thieves Guild to put him out of business.  I don't know how the
 guild masters didn't see the problem early on, but by the time they
 realized what was happening, many fighters and thieves were killed and
 neither guild wanted to give up their contract.  The Mage Guild was
 soon hired, by both guilds, to fight the other.  This troubled time
 became known as the Guildwars and I found myself in the center of it.

 A: I had been hired by the Thieves Guild. (Thieves Faction: 15)
 B: I had been hired by the Fighters Guild. (Fighters Faction: 25)
 C: I had been hired by the Mage Guild. (Mages Faction: 130)

 fighters and thieves from working at cross purposes.
 (Mage Guild +15)

 A: I followed the merchant whose shops were being raided.
 B: I followed the merchant who was responsible for raiding the shops.

 were sitting in the same pub and enjoying a nice drink in front of a
 warm fire!  They were chatting to each other like old friends.

 A: I had Kal sneak in and listen to their conversation. (Needs Thief
 Power 7)
 B: I used my magic to listen to their conversation from outside.
 (Needs 55 Divination)
 C: I turned myself invisible and went in to listen.  (Needs 55
 Illusion)
 D: I set fire to the bar, killing both merchants.
 E: I walked in and demanded to know what was going on.

>c
 pittingthe guilds against each other.  They knew the strife it was
 causing and I soon found their motive.  One merchantsold weaponry,
 the other sold armor.  They didn't care who was winning the Guildwar,
 because every side was buying from them, and they were becoming filthy
 rich.
 (Illusion +10)

 A: I informed the guilds.
 B: I demanded a cut of the action.

>a
 banded together with such force that it made the entire Guildwar a
 unifying experience.  They removed the two merchants from business,
 sold everything they owned and splitthe profits amongst themselves.
 I think it was the Thieves Guild's idea. I was given a nice reward for
 uncovering the plot.
