 Are you sure you want to quit? Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation,
 library version 0.9.0.




 You've lived in this city all your life, but now you may be the last
 man left here. It's already dusk, and before the next dawn comes --
 well, it's not quite clear what's expected, but the whole city has fled
 from it. You could and should have been on that last train. You would
 have been on that last train but for her.

 Nightfall
 An Interactive Short Story by Eric Eve
 Release 2 / Serial number 081122 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Platform 1
 The train accelerates northwards up the track, its rear carriage
 disappearing into the distance. Just a minute ago this long, draughty
 platform was crammed with the last batch of people leaving the city.
 Now there isn't another soul in sight. The indicator boards are all
 blank: no more trains will be leaving here today - if ever. Just to the
 north the bridge across to Platform 2 has been blocked off with a steel
 gate; the only way out from here is thus east, back to the ticket
 office.

 Just as the last echo of the departing train fades away, the sun
 finally sinks beneath the western horizon.

 Nightfall takes place in a city the Player Character knows well; he's
 lived there all his life and so has a far better knowledge of the local
 geography than the player begins with. To help bridge this knowledge
 gap you can use the command GO TO X or FIND X (these mean the same
 thing) to go either to a named destination or an object the player
 knows about. This command will take the player character towards his
 destination one step at a time. To continue towards the destination,
 use the CONTINUE command (which you can abbreviate to C). Note that the
 CONTINUE command can be used after any number of intervening commands,
 including explicit compass-movement commands.

 The exit lister in the status line shows a list of directions you can
 go in from your current location. Any directions in upper case indicate
 directions to locations you haven't yet visited.

 Several locations trigger memories the first time you visit them. If
 you want see the memory associated with the location you're in again,
 you can use the command REMEMBER. To see the memory associated with
 another location you've visited, use the command REMEMBER &lt;location
 the names of all the places you've visited. To recapitulate all the
 memories you've triggered so far, you can use the command RECAP.

 You can use the command THINK to get some ideas for what to do next.
 These will be the player character's ideas, and some of them may be
 better than others. This command helps bridge the gap between player
 knowledge and player character knowledge. If you're stuck and THINK
 doesn't give you enough of a hint, you can try the command THINK HARDER
 (or just THINK HARD), which in some cases may provide a much more
 explicit hint.

 In brief, make regular use of the THINK command as an integral part of
 the game. Use THINK HARDER for hints.

 To converse with other characters use commands like ASK BOB ABOUT RING
 or TELL BOB ABOUT DAGGER; these commands may be abbreviated to A RING
 or T DAGGER. You can also respond to certain questions asked by other
 characters with a simple YES or NO.

 Finally, you may not like the ending you get first time round. To avoid
 having to play all the way through again from the beginning to find a
 better ending, you may want to save at fairly regular intervals.

 Platform 1
 The station feels sadly deserted, a ghost station in what has already
 become a ghost city. Not long ago this long, draughty platform was
 crammed with the last batch of people leaving the city. Now there isn't
 another soul in sight. The indicator boards are all blank: no more
 trains will be leaving here today - if ever. Just to the north the
 bridge across to Platform 2 has been blocked off with a steel gate; the
 only way out from here is thus east, back to the ticket office.

>inventory
 You are carrying a small brown envelope (closed).

 [You can change inventory listing style with the commands I WIDE, I
 TALL, I CURT and I MINIMAL]

>examine envelope
 It's a small square envelope, only a couple of inches to a side.
 There's nothing written on it.

>examine gate
 A large slatted steel gate has been closed across the foot of the
 bridge.

>open envelope
 You slit it open with your finger, and find a small silver key within.

>examine key
 It's a small, unmarked silver key.

>examine me
 A slightly stocky young man of 28, dressed for a chilly night.

 There's a distant hoot from the departing train as it rounds some bend
 on the outskirts of the city.

>go east
 Ticket Office
 It's the sheer emptiness of this place that strikes you. Just a few
 minutes ago a press of people were jostling one another in ill-natured
 queues, increasingly anxious to buy their tickets to safety. Now every
 ticket position is closed, and there's no one here, just a bare empty
 hall with nothing to see but the now irrelevant timetables posted on
 the walls and the station clock ticking ever on into the fateful night.
 The equally deserted platform is just to the west, while the way out to
 Station Road lies to the north.

 While you were queuing for your ticket just a few minutes ago, Jeremy
 turned to you and said, "She's still in the city, you know. She's not
 leaving; apparently there's something frantically important she has to
 do here."

 "More important than getting away from the Enemy?" you asked.

 "So she says," he replied, with a dismissive shrug, "Oh, and by the
 way, I nearly forgot. She asked me to give you this." He handed you a
 small brown envelope.

 You didn't need to ask who he meant. There were thousands of women in
 the city, but only one she - in Jeremy's case because of their
 relationship; in yours - well, it was then that your notion about
 staying behind for her finally started to harden into resolve.

>examine clock
 The clock that hangs here is an old-fashioned round one with a white
 face and Roman numerals round its dial. According to this clock the
 time is now three minutes past eight.

 Station Road
 As you emerge into Station Road you find that the sky has already
 turned black, but a full moon has risen, bathing the street in ghostly
 light which blends strangely with that from the row of lamp posts
 parading eastwards towards the junction with York Street. The entrance
 to the main railway station lies directly to the south. Otherwise,
 there's little here but litter.

 The quiet is momentarily broken by the sound of a loudspeaker in a
 nearby street. It can't be the Enemy - not yet; after a moment you
 realize it must be the police. You can't make out what the voice is
 saying, but you can guess.

>examine litter
 A couple of lager cans, boxes containing the remnants of take-away
 meals, scraps of packaging, all left littering the street.

 You hear a distant rumble of thunder off to the west. At least, it
 sounds a bit like thunder.

>search litter
 The litter looks quite useless to you, and you aren't about to start a
 new career as a refuse collector.

>go east
 Junction of York Street and Station Road
 This is normally one of the busiest junctions in the city, mainly due
 to the traffic from the railway station, but now there isn't so much as
 a bicycle in sight, just the ever-present street lighting, the river
 running by to the east, and the sign pointing north towards the City
 Sports Ground, south towards Mandlebury Bridge and the Hospital, and
 west towards the Railway Station.

 You stand at the Junction, considering which way to go next. You know
 where she lives, of course: in a flat at 18 Gladstone Terrace, a few
 blocks south of the railway station, so that would be one obvious place
 to try. The other would be her office, at 12 Devon Road, some way to
 the east of the station, across the river (you can use the GO TO
 command to find your way round the city; e.g. GO TO HER OFFICE or GO TO
 GLADSTONE TERRACE).

 [To see your character's thoughts in future, use the THINK command.]

>go to gladstone terrace
 (Gladstone Terrace)
 (going south)

 York Street (South)
 This part of York Street has moved considerably up-market in recent
 years. The old Victorian terraces lining the west side of the street
 may be small, and were probably built for Victorian labourers, but the
 recent hike in property prices makes them the best that many young
 professionals can afford. They lack nearby parking spaces, but that
 wouldn't be a problem tonight; there isn't a single car in sight;
 everyone with a car has used it to get away. The eerily deserted street
 continues alongside the river to north and south.

>c
 (going south)
 Embankment
 The Embankment is the name given to this short stretch of road by
 Mandlebury Bridge, which spans the river to the east. To the west the
 Embankment is lined by a row of shops; to the north it becomes York
 Street, while to the south it runs into Sussex Street.

 This is where you found her that dreadful night, seven years ago. Her
 clothes were soaked of course, but it's the water streaming from her
 long dark hair that you remember most vividly now - that and the fact
 that she was kneeling by Kate's body.

 She looked up, obviously distressed, but then relieved to see a
 familiar face. "She fell - off the bridge" she gasped, swallowing hard
 as she wiped the damp hair out of her eyes, "I don't know how - just a
 few minutes ago - I tried to save her - but - well - I dived in and I
 managed to get her out - but she's not breathing!"

 For a moment you just stood there, overcome by shock as you stared at
 her, unwilling to take in what she had just said. Then she galvanised
 you into action: "For goodness' sake! Don't just stand there! Fetch
 help! Go and call an ambulance!"

 And so off you ran, south towards the city hospital.

>c
 (going south)

 Sussex Street (north)
 A row of large Edwardian town houses lines the west side of the street,
 overlooking the river to the east. The houses are all in darkness, and
 the street deserted, making it all seem not quite real -- almost as if
 you'd wandered onto a film set or were experiencing a dream. Sussex
 Street continues north to the Embankment and south towards the junction
 with Gladstone Terrace.

>whois jeremy?
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>whois jeremy
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>remember jeremy
 The best way to do that is to find the places that trigger particular
 memories.

>c
 (going south)

 Junction of Sussex Street and Gladstone Terrace.
 This junction would be well-lit even without the moonlight. Sussex
 Street continues to north and south while Gladstone Terrace, where she
 lives, leads off to the west. Further north the street runs along the
 west bank of the river, but just here the river bends towards the
 southeast and parts company with the road.

>c
 (going west)
 Gladstone Terrace
 This short cul-de-sac is noticeably less well lit than the main road
 just to the east; although the bright moonlight compensates for this
 somewhat, parts of the street lie in mysterious shadow. At its western
 end, the street terminates at the railway line, along the side of which
 lie a large number of loose stones. Just short of the tracks the block
 of flats where she lives stands on the south side of the street.

 When you walked her home one night, about two years ago, this was as
 far as you got. You had hoped she would at least invite you in for a
 coffee. Indeed, for a moment you thought she seemed just on the point
 of doing so, but then all she said was, "Thank you - it was good to
 talk." Just before she turned away to let herself in, she added, "I'll
 see you around." Then she disappeared inside, leaving you standing in
 the street as if you could not possibly have expected anything else.

 You have arrived at your destination.

>take stone
 You select a large round stone and take that.

>examine flats
 She lives at number 18. It's three storeys tall, but otherwise a
 perfectly ordinary block of flats, especially by night, and you can't
 recall ever having seen it by day. As you might expect, there's a
 doorbell by the door.

>ring doorbell
 You ring the bell for flat G, but no one answers.

>open door
 The street door is locked.

>unlock door
 You need a key to unlock the street door.

>unlock door with key
 (first taking the small silver key)
 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>examine window
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine door
 It looks extremely solid, as if particularly designed to keep burglars
 out, but at least there's a doorbell next to it, as well as a large
 number 18 on it.

>think
 If she's not at home, her office would be the next obvious place to
 try. It's at 12 Devon Road, in the northeast part of the city.

>go to her office
 (going to Her Office)
 (going east)

 Junction of Sussex Street and Gladstone Terrace.
 This junction would be well-lit even without the moonlight. Sussex
 Street continues to north and south while Gladstone Terrace leads off
 to the west. Further north the street runs along the west bank of the
 river, but just here the river bends towards the southeast and parts
 company with the road.

>c
 (going north)

 Sussex Street (north)
 A row of large Edwardian town houses lines the west side of the street,
 overlooking the river to the east. The houses are all in darkness, and
 the street deserted, making it all seem not quite real. Sussex Street
 continues north to the Embankment and south towards the junction with
 Gladstone Terrace.

>c
 (going north)

 Embankment
 The Embankment is the name given to this short stretch of road by
 Mandlebury Bridge, which spans the river to the east. To the west the
 Embankment is lined by a row of shops; to the north it becomes York
 Street, while to the south it runs into Sussex Street.

 A distant clock strikes the quarter-hour; time is marching on.

>c
 (going east)
 As you're about to step onto the bridge, you happen to glance up and
 notice a CCTV camera fixed to a nearby lamp-post. If there are police
 still in the city, they might see you walk past it, and you'd much
 rather they didn't, since they'd probably try to make you leave.

>throw stone at camera
 You hesitate; throwing things at CCTV cameras is the kind of loutish
 behaviour you've always disapproved of. But tonight of all nights may
 be a night for bending the rules. The large stone leaves your hand and
 hits the end of the camera, knocking it so that it now points over the
 river, into which the stone falls. You have joined the ranks of the
 louts.

>c
 (going east)
 Mandlebury Bridge
 It's strange - almost unnatural - to see this bridge so deserted.
 You're more used to seeing it jammed with slow-moving rush-hour
 traffic, or at least a steady flow. But now there's nothing here apart
 from the bare tarmac, the street lights (one of which now has a large
 placard attached to it), the stone parapet, and the river sliding
 silently past below.

 It suddenly strikes you that you have, just once before, seen the
 bridge this deserted - a night burned on your memory. You were walking
 home from a late party - if only you had left that party a few minutes
 earlier you might have arrived here just in time to stop Kate falling
 to her death.

>examine placard
 It reads

 EVACUATION NOTICE
 An Unknown Enemy is coming! They are expected to arrive by nightfall.
 For your own safety, please ensure that you are well clear of the city
 before dusk. Extra trains are being laid on for those without any other
 transport. In case of difficulty, contact the police.

>remember'
 I didn't understand that sentence.

 Mandlebury Road (West)
 At this point Mandlebury Road is a broad, well-lit street, bordering
 the shadowy entrance to Mandlebury Park just to the north, and a
 traditional fish and chip shop to the south. The street continues east
 towards the city centre and west over Mandlebury Bridge.

 An old newspaper lies abandoned just outside the fish and chip shop.

 You hear the sound of a car engine and see a pair of headlights
 approaching rapidly from the east.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go north
 You step into the shadows of the park entrance just in time to avoid
 being caught in the beam of the approaching car's headlamps. You stand
 to watch as the car drives past onto Mandlebury Bridge. As it passes
 under the street lights in Mandlebury Road you can see that it's a
 police car. Your first thought is that it has been sent to investigate
 the CCTV camera you just knocked with that stone, but then it occurs to
 you it might just be out looking for stragglers left behind in the
 city. In either case, it seems a good idea to keep out of its way, so
 you carry on into the park.

 Mandlebury Park
 Although you've often been here in daylight, you've never visited the
 park by night before, and it looks quite different by moonlight. By day
 it's a pleasant, green open space overlooking the river to the west,
 but now it's shrouded in sinister black, cold and unwelcoming. The main
 exit onto Mandlebury Road lies to the south, but there's also a narrow
 lane off to the east leading to the High Street.

 When time permits you often come here to eat your lunch on the park
 bench. On one such occasion about four years ago you saw her jogging
 past on a circuit of the park. The second time round, much to your
 delight, she stopped to catch her breath and chat. You can't remember a
 great deal of the conversation - you were just so pleased to be talking
 with her - but you do remember she was enthusing about some book she'd
 just read.

 "Have you read any Stanilev?" she asked.

 "I've never heard of him," you admitted.

 "He's a great thinker, you should read him, you really should," she
 urged you, "Until I read him I never realized anyone else could feel
 that way. It was so liberating!"

 But though you promised her you'd look out for a copy of Stanilev's
 book, somehow you never got round to it.

>examine bench
 Although you can scarcely make out more than its outline now, you know
 it to be an old wooden bench, well weathered by years of exposure to
 the elements.

 There's a roar overhead. Perhaps it's just a jet airliner, but perhaps
 it's a warplane, or even an incoming missile. You pause, unconsciously
 holding your breath as you listen to its approach. But then, at last,
 it fades away: not a missile, then, at any rate.

>go south

 Mandlebury Road (West)
 At this point Mandlebury Road is a broad, well-lit street, bordering
 the shadowy entrance to Mandlebury Park just to the north, and a
 traditional fish and chip shop to the south. The street continues east
 towards the city centre and west over Mandlebury Bridge.

 An old newspaper lies abandoned just outside the fish and chip shop.

>take newspaper
 You pick up the old newspaper, fumbling a little as you try to keep the
 separate sheets together while they resist your efforts with the most
 stubborn display of the innate cussedness of inanimate objects. You
 eventually manage to tame it, with the surviving sheets forced into a
 reasonable semblance of order.

>read it
 Most of it is missing, and the rest of it is at least several weeks
 old. Apart from the grease stains testifying to its use as a
 fish-and-chips wrapper, it is full of the usual bad news about
 undesirable things on the increase: inflation, unemployment, taxes,
 crime, global warming; according to one columnist, there's even a sharp
 rise in severe personality disorders among the under thirties. The sole
 surviving page of foreign news is no cheerier, since it bemoans
 increasing tension in the Middle East coupled with the danger of former
 Soviet republics selling nuclear weapons on the black market.

>c
 (going east)

 City Centre
 The junction where the High Street crosses Mandlebury Road is generally
 reckoned to be the central point of the city. From here the High Street
 runs north up past your office and south towards Preston Bridge and the
 ring road, while Mandlebury Road runs east towards the police station
 and west towards the river. Most of the buildings on the junction are
 closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit,
 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.

>c
 (going east)

 Mandlebury Road (East)
 A large car park lies immediately to the south, while Church Street
 forks off to the northeast. Mandlebury Road continues to both east
 (past the Police Station) and west (back to the City Centre).

>c
 (going northeast)

 Church Street
 Church Street runs up the hill to the northeast and down to the
 southwest past rows of prickly bushes, while directly to the north a
 lych-gate leads through to St Michael's church yard.

>c
 (going northeast)
 Church Street Bus Stop
 The bus stop stands at the junction of Church Street, which runs
 northeast and southwest from here, and School Lane, which leads off to
 the south.

 A drunken tramp is staggering around in the middle of the street,
 singing loudly and tunelessly.

 There are many bus-stops in the city, but only this one holds special
 memories for you. As a teenager you often used to wait here for your
 bus home from school. It was on her route home, too, and though she
 took a different bus from yours, you'd sometimes spot her on her bus
 when it stopped here. Once or twice she spotted you too, and then she'd
 always smile and wave, as if you were some long-lost friend. And even
 as a teenager she was so pretty!

 The tramp sways unsteadily on his feet, and stares in your direction,
 as if willing his eyes to focus.

>c
 (going northeast)
 The drunken tramp staggers into your path, grabs your arm and says "I
 must have a drink." He seems determined not to let you pass until he
 gets what he wants.

>ask tramp about drink
 "Do I take it you'd like something to drink?" you enquire.

 "Hallelujah, the man has more than one brain cell!" the tramp replies.

>ask tramp about liquor store
 The tramp sways unsteadily on his feet. "Spare some change, mate?" he
 asks hopefully.

>SAVE
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>hit tramp
 There's a brief but vicious scuffle, in which you fail to make much
 impression on him.

 From somewhere across the city a clock chimes the half-hour.

>go to supermarket
 (going to the Supermarket)
 It looks like you'll have to go back and find another route.

 The tramp points down the hill. "There's a church down there" he says,
 "I used to sing in the choir. Would you believe that?" He starts to
 sing in a distorted parody of plain-chant, "Dies irae, dies illa,
 solvet saeclum in favilla!" and then offers the following translation:
 "That day of wrath, when fucking everything ends in ashes."

>ask tramp about church
 The tramp scratches his head, as if deeply puzzled by your remark. "The
 whole world is coming to an end, so let's get drunk!" he suggests.

>go southwest

 Church Street
 Church Street runs up the hill to the northeast and down to the
 southwest past rows of prickly bushes, while directly to the north a
 lych-gate leads through to St Michael's church yard.

>go north
 Churchyard
 A churchyard by moonlight is always a little spooky, but it is doubly
 so tonight, with the city so deserted. The gravestones are little more
 than looming shadows in the dark; the great bulk of St Michael's Church
 is just to the north, while the lych-gate to the south leads back out
 to Church Street.

 Kate's grave is somewhere here among the others; you used to visit it
 often. You'll never forget the shock you received when you came one day
 only a few weeks after Kate's funeral to find the grave desecrated. At
 least, someone had knocked over the headstone and smashed it, and the
 flowers were all torn up and strewn around. The police never did catch
 the culprits, and put it down to local hooligans, but that never seemed
 quite satisfactory somehow; why should it be Kate's grave that was
 attacked in this way?

 It's long since been put right, of course, but the memory of the broken
 gravestone still leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Kate deserved
 better than that - much better.

>examine kate's grave
 It's too dark to make any of them out individually, but you know Kate's
 is among them somewhere, and you'd have no difficulty finding it in the
 light.

>go north
 Nave
 St Michael's has a large nave, built at a time when Victorian
 congregations were booming. The original wooden pews are still here,
 facing the chancel to the east, as is the original Victorian stained
 glass, all but invisible in the poor light. The way out is to the
 south, next to the large stone font at the rear of the church.

 You remember when you came here for Kate's funeral, just over six years
 ago. She was sitting up in one of the front pews, quite unaware of your
 presence, although your eyes kept wandering to the back of her head. At
 some appropriate point in the service she went up to the lectern and
 made some thoroughly fitting speech about the tragically early death of
 her dear friend Kate, who had had a wonderful life ahead of her. You
 can't remember precisely what she said; what you remember is how solemn
 and composed she was as she spoke, saying just the right things in just
 the right sombre tone, without ever giving way to emotion and tears.

>examine chancel
 The chancel is to the east, set off from the nave for the use of choir
 and clergy.

>go east

 Chancel
 Raised slightly above the Nave, which lies just to the west, much of
 the space in the Chancel is taken up by the choir stalls on either side
 and the altar at the east end. A small wooden door is set in the wall
 on the north side of the altar.

>examine altar
 The altar is currently quite bare, the altar furniture no doubt locked
 away to protect it from burglaries.

>go north
 (first trying to open the small wooden door)
 The small wooden door is locked.

>examine door
 It may be small, but it looks pretty solid, with large iron hinges and
 an arched shape at the top. It's currently closed.

>unlock door with key
 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>knock on door
 You knock on the small wooden door, but there is no response.

>examine stalls
 Two rows of dark wooden stalls line either side of the chancel.

>look in stalls
 The choir stalls is empty.

>look under stalls
 You find nothing of interest.

>sit in stalls
 You get into the choir stalls.

 facing the chancel to the east, as is the original Victorian stained
 glass, all but invisible in the poor light. The way out is to the
 south, next to the large stone font at the rear of the church.

>examine font
 It's a large round font, made of stone, and covered by a wooden lid.

>open it
 Removing the lid reveals a large iron key in the font.

>take iron key
 Just a little reluctantly, you lift the iron key from its naively
 trusting hiding place, where it was perhaps left for the use of a
 church cleaner or some dear old lady coming to arrange the flowers.
 You're not that eager to add robbing churches to your achievements.

>go east
 (first putting the lid back on the font)

 Chancel
 Raised slightly above the Nave, which lies just to the west, much of
 the space in the Chancel is taken up by the choir stalls on either side
 and the altar at the east end. A small wooden door is set in the wall
 on the north side of the altar.

>unlock door with iron key
 You unlock the small wooden door.

 As a distant clock chimes quarter to the hour, it occurs to you it
 might be time to pay a visit to her office.

>open door
 You open the small wooden door.

>go north

 Vestry
 A plain wooden table runs under the window of this small, narrow room,
 with an old-fashioned safe set into the opposite wall. The only way out
 is via the door to the south.

 On the table is a large blue diary.

>examine diary
 (first taking the large blue diary)
 You flick through the diary. It's mainly a record of services and
 parish meetings, but you find an entry from two days ago that catches
 your eye: "Meet DS at KA 2 pm". "KA" is likely to be the Kings Arms,
 the pub in the High Street.

>examine safe
 All you can see of it is the green-painted metal door set into the
 wall. It's unlikely to contain anything of interest, just crosses,
 candlesticks and communion wafers.

>open it
 The safe is locked.

>unlock safe with iron key
 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

 Which do you mean, the small wooden door or the safe?

>safe
 All you can see of it is the green-painted metal door set into the
 wall. It's unlikely to contain anything of interest, just crosses,
 candlesticks and communion wafers.

>examine wooden door
 It may be small, but it looks pretty solid, with large iron hinges and
 an arched shape at the top. It's currently open

 Chancel
 Raised slightly above the Nave, which lies just to the west, much of
 the space in the Chancel is taken up by the choir stalls on either side
 and the altar at the east end. A small wooden door is set in the wall
 on the north side of the altar.

>close door
 You close the small wooden door.

 You lock the small wooden door.

 Nave
 St Michael's has a large nave, built at a time when Victorian
 congregations were booming. The original wooden pews are still here,
 facing the chancel to the east, as is the original Victorian stained
 glass, all but invisible in the poor light. The way out is to the
 south, next to the large stone font at the rear of the church.

 Somewhere in the distance a dog barks. You're not sure whether it's a
 local stray or the advance guard of the enemy, perhaps using dogs to
 flush out anyone remaining in the city. After a short while the barking
 stops.

>put iron key in font
 The font is closed.

>open font
 You pick up the round wooden lid and examine it.

 It's made of some dark wood, and looks both well-worn and solid.

>put iron key in font
 You put the large iron key into the font.

>go south
 (first putting the lid back on the font)

 Churchyard
 A churchyard by moonlight is always a little spooky, but it is doubly
 so tonight, with the city so deserted. The gravestones are little more
 than looming shadows in the dark; the great bulk of St Michael's Church
 is just to the north, while the lych-gate to the south leads back out
 to Church Street.

>go south

 Church Street
 Church Street runs up the hill to the northeast and down to the
 southwest past rows of prickly bushes, while directly to the north a
 lych-gate leads through to St Michael's church yard.

 You hear the sound of a car, and see headlights approach, so you
 instinctively dive into the shadows. A police patrol car drives past
 again, hopefully not looking for you, but you don't want them to see
 you.

 City Centre
 The junction where the High Street crosses Mandlebury Road is generally
 reckoned to be the central point of the city. From here the High Street
 runs north up past your office and south towards Preston Bridge and the
 ring road, while Mandlebury Road runs east towards the police station
 and west towards the river. Most of the buildings on the junction are
 closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit,
 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.

>c
 (going northeast)
 The supermarket is all locked up; you can't get in.

>examine supermarket
 The supermarket occupies the entire corner on which it stands, and was
 seemingly designed by an architect desperate to win the International
 Bland Building of the Millennium contest. Through its plate glass
 window you can see the front part of the shop is partially lit, perhaps
 as a security measure. An unmistakeable security measure is the burglar
 mounted just above the entrance.

>examine alarm
 It's a square, red box with "Metro Alarms" printed on it.

>look through window
 Through the window you can see the partly-lit interior of the shop,
 with a rack of budget CDs prominently displayed near the front.

 The High Street runs north to the City Centre and continues to the

 High Street (Outside Hairdressers and Pub)
 Amongst the various buildings lining the street here you particularly
 notice two: the glass-fronted Ladies' Hairdresser to the east and the
 mock-Tudor olde worlde pub - the Kings Arms - which stands directly
 opposite it to the west. The High Street continues to both north and
 south.

 You'll never forget the terrible shock you got when you happened to be
 passing this way not long after Kate's funeral (which had left you
 feeling pretty down in any case). She (not Kate - she) had stepped out
 of the Hairdressers, and for a moment you almost failed to recognize
 her, she'd had her hair cut so dreadfully short. You hated it at once;
 she'd had such a glorious mane of long dark hair, but this - well, it
 must have shown in your face, since she remarked, more than a little
 snippily. "I thought it was time for a change", and then stalked off up
 the street before you could reply.

 In the event she must have agreed with your judgement, though, since
 she never had her hair cut like that again; instead the way she let it
 grow longer year by year suggested she hardly had it cut again at all.

>c
 (going west)
 It seems that the Kings Arms is one more place left open in the rush to
 flee the city. You walk inside without any difficulty.

 Lounge Bar
 The interior of the Kings Arms matches its exterior, going for an olde
 worlde feel. On balance, you consider that a good thing, since even if
 the old-fashioned rustic look is largely a bogus marketing creation,
 the Lounge Bar of the Kings Arms at least feels as if it has some kind
 of character beyond the plastic blandness imposed by all too many
 soulless breweries. Besides, you really rather like the cosy feel the
 exposed wooden beams give to the place, and the way it divides the
 space into irregular nooks and crannies.

 The bar must have been evacuated in a hurry, since half the lights have
 been left on, the street exit to the east has been left wide open, and
 the counter left unattended.

 On the bar counter are a matchbook and a bar mat.

 You met her here about three years ago. You'd been giving her some
 routine legal advice on the phone, and you'd managed to drop the
 suggestion of a drink into the conversation. A little to your surprise
 she'd agreed, and that evening, you only had to wait for about five
 minutes before she walked in, spotted you from across the bar and came
 and joined you at your table.

 "Tell me," she said, once you'd bought her a drink and you'd both
 settled down for a chat, "What would you like to be remembered for?"

 "I'm not sure I'd ever given it much thought," you replied, "I suppose
 I'd be pretty content to be remembered as a decent sort of bloke."

 "Oh, I'm sure you'll be remembered for that, David!" she laughed, "But
 I've been thinking; how sad it must be to pass through life and never
 leave any kind of impression."

 "You seem to have made quite an impression round here already," you
 remarked.

 "Maybe -- but is it enough?" she wondered, "There are times when I feel
 that whatever I do, it's never quite enough!"

 "It sounds like you're demanding too much of yourself," you suggested.

 For a moment she stared at you, as if pondering how best to respond to
 this idea. Then she suddenly brightened, briskly changing the subject,
 "Sorry, I'm sure you don't want to hear about my existential angst all
 evening --  so, tell me about your day."

 So you did, and from there the conversation wandered on to other
 topics, till she quite suddenly announced that she had to leave.

 You have arrived at your destination.

>take all from counter
 matchbook: You pick up the matchbook and examine it.

 It's the sort of matchbook you see all over the place used to advertise
 the establishment that handed it out; from the front cover it's
 apparent that it must have come from the Grand Hotel (in Market
 Street). This one has no matches left in it, but inside someone has
 doodled:

 From somewhere across the city a clock chimes the hour. Time may be

 yourself that it's in a good cause you reach over the counter and take

 It's normally near impossible to find a parking space in this town
 centre car park at any time between 8 am and midnight, but now there's

 The bus stop stands at the junction of Church Street, which runs

 A drunken tramp is staggering around in the middle of the street,
 singing loudly and tunelessly.

 You have arrived at your destination.

 The tramp staggers around, singing raucously, "Beautiful mushroom,
 cloud over me!"

>give scotch to tramp
 You hand the bottle to the tramp saying, "Here, mate; have this!"

 The tramp takes the bottle from your grasp and stares at it blearily
 for a few moments. Then he removes the top with his teeth and takes a
 large swig. "Thanks, mate; that's just the ticket!" he declares.

 Still singing, he staggers away, probably to be picked up by the police
 before long.

 Her Office (in darkness)
 Too little light filters in from the outside for you to be able to see
 much in here apart from vague dark shapes, but you think the light
 switch is by the door. The way out is to the west.

 You've been here once or twice before; she's occasionally used your
 firm for legal advice. She set up in business here shortly after
 graduating, specializing in student lets. The business seems to have
 been moderately successful - at least, it's still going and she's not
 obviously poverty-stricken - but it's never grown, since she still
 works by herself after seven years at it.

 Her Office
 Her office is almost painfully tidy. The modern pine desk standing in
 the middle of the floor is quite uncluttered. Behind it on the back
 wall is a small safe, right next to an impressive collection of
 certificates. The sole door is out to the west.

 On the modern pine desk are a blotter and a green telephone.

>examine blotter
 On the blotter she has scribbled the words "Borodino Overture", and
 then a little further down "Home Office" and finally "No danger".

>look under it
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine desk
 It's of a clean, plain, modern design, large enough both to afford
 plenty of working space and to impart a certain status to its owner. A
 set of three drawers forms a pedestal down the right-hand side.

 On the modern pine desk are a blotter and a green telephone.

>open drawers
 You hesitate to start rifling through her desk; apart from a guilty
 feeling of sleazy dishonesty at behaving like a common burglar, you
 sense that searching her office drawers might be to cross the line from
 interest to infatuation; you are almost as much relieved as
 disappointed to find all the drawers locked.

>examine telephone
 It's a standard handset.

>examine safe
 It's a standard-looking wall-safe, of the sort one might keep papers
 in, equipped with a combination dial.

 From the look of it, the way to use the dial is to turn it to any
 number between 0 and 99.

>turn dial clockwise to 88
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine certificates
 The certificates show a range of her achievements, but her degree
 certificate is conspicuous by its absence.

>read them
 The certificates are not your immediate concern.

 "Borodino Overture"  -  With a chuckle you realize that these words
 point to precisely the same number as "Home Office", which, after all,
 probably doesn't refer to the government department.

>turn dial to 18
 Okay, you turn the dial to 18.

>turn dial to 12
 As you turn the dial to 12 you hear a faint click.

>open safe
 The safe door swings open easily. She did mean you to open it, you tell
 yourself, otherwise she wouldn't have sent you the key to her office
 and left that clue on the blotter.

 Inside the safe you see a small brass key and some miscellaneous
 papers.

 The green phone suddenly starts ringing.

 "Hello, I am just checking that the delivery of the merchandise was

 "Hello," you reply, trying to place the accent, "Who is this? I'm
 afraid..."

 "I am sorry, I must have a wrong number." the phone abruptly goes dead
 again.

 You replace the receiver, still trying to place the accent. It sounded
 vaguely Russian.

 As a clock chimes the quarter-hour you hear a dreadful scream from not
 far away. Your heart races momentarily until you realize it's just the
 yowling from a cat-fight.

>take all from safe
 small brass key: You pick up the small brass key and examine it.

 It's the kind of small brass house key that might unlock any of a
 billion homes. On it is stamped "18G".

 miscellaneous papers: You pick up the miscellaneous papers and examine
 them.

 They appear to relate to her letting business; you look through them
 quickly, but without knowing what you're looking for it's hard to find
 anything of interest.

 Among these otherwise uninteresting papers you discover a printed
 email.

>read email
 It's a printed copy of an email, addressed to her from one
 edward.dawlish@freegov.org. The main body of the email reads:


 We have given your CV and letter the most serious consideration but
 regret to inform you that we felt unable to add your name to our
 short-list of candidates. As I'm sure you will appreciate this has long
 been a safe seat, and we thus have an unusually strong field of
 potential candidates, many of whom already have considerable
 parliamentary experience.


 Your participation and achievements in the life of this city have
 indeed been remarkable, and we recognize that. We accordingly feel you
 would make an *excellent* candidate for the city council, and very much
 hope you will consider offering yourself as a candidate for the
 forthcoming local elections (we could virtually guarantee to find you a
 winnable ward). Any experience gained as a local councillor would also
 stand you in very good stead should you wish to pursue parliamentary
 ambitions at some later date.

 The email is dated about two years ago. At the bottom of it is written
 in large red letters: "NO!".

 Mandlebury Bridge
 It's strange - almost unnatural - to see this bridge so deserted.
 You're more used to seeing it jammed with slow-moving rush-hour
 traffic, or at least a steady flow. But now there's nothing here apart
 from the bare tarmac, the street lights (one of which now has a large
 placard attached to it), the stone parapet, and the river sliding
 silently past below.

 A row of large Edwardian town houses lines the west side of the street,

 This junction would be well-lit even without the moonlight. Sussex

 company with the road.

 Gladstone Terrace
 This short cul-de-sac is noticeably less well lit than the main road
 just to the east; although the bright moonlight compensates for this
 somewhat, parts of the street lie in mysterious shadow. At its western
 end, the street terminates at the railway line, along the side of which
 lie a large number of loose stones. Just short of the tracks the block
 of flats where she lives stands on the south side of the street.

 For some reason you feel you are being watched. You're not quite sure
 what it was, perhaps a movement half-glimpsed out of the corner of your
 eye, but whatever it was you see nothing when you turn round to look.
 You stop and listen, and half-hear a single footstep disappearing to

 You hardly notice any details at first; you are too struck by the
 potent mixture of excitement and guilt at having penetrated her private
 domain. For a moment or two you hold your breath, half-expecting her to

 remains silent, and curiosity begins to overcome guilt.

 Bedroom
 You find yourself almost tip-toeing into the room, as if afraid to
 disturb her, or rather, as if afraid of being caught invading somewhere
 so private. The bedroom looks almost obsessively neat, with virtually
 nothing on view apart from the double bed that occupies about a third
 of the floor space, the bedside cabinet right next to it, and the doors
 to what is presumably a large built-in wardrobe in the north wall.
 You're not sure what you expected: probably something more exotic and
 more sensual, but this, while by no means utilitarian, is nonetheless
 somehow disappointing. Perhaps what's lacking is simply her.

 On the bedside cabinet is a black telephone.

>examine bed
 It's very neatly made, as if its owner had been trained as a nurse in
 an old-fashioned hospital. But what's most interesting is that it's a
 double, given that she lives alone. You wonder whether anyone else has
 slept there, and if so who.

>look under bed
 As you suspected, the owner of this bed is far too tidy to leave any
 clutter underneath it.

>examine cabinet
 (the bedside cabinet)
 It's a smart wooden cabinet with a single shallow drawer.

 On the bedside cabinet is a black telephone.

>open drawer
 You open the cabinet drawer, revealing a business card and a crumpled

 On the reverse side of the card another phone number has been written
 by hand: 01921 743589

 crumpled piece of paper: You pick up the crumpled piece of paper and
 examine it.

 It's her degree certificate, showing that she graduated with an
 excellent first class degree. Despite your best efforts to straighten

 The kitchen could hardly be neater and cleaner if it had just been
 prepared for a health and safety inspection. It is also compact and
 modern, with some smart kitchen units along two walls, and a small pine
 table off to one side. The way out back to the hall is to the north.

>examine table
 Presumably this is where she eats, but from the modest size of the
 table you reckon she must mostly eat alone.

>examine units
 Just the usual blend of cupboards and drawers to hold cooking and
 eating utensils. You're not really interested in pots and plates and
 pans right now, but of course you never know what you might find.

 utensils of no immediate use to you, but then you come to the cutlery

 Living Room
 So this is where she relaxes. The living room is a good size, and is
 smartly furnished, as you would expect. A comfortable modern settee has
 been strategically placed to face the large flat screen television
 sitting in the corner, while a large black and white poster adorns one
 wall. The way out is to the east.

 On the mantelpiece are a menu, a familiar birthday card, a small gold
 trophy and a concert programme.

>examine birthday card
 (first taking the familiar birthday card)
 You recognize it at once. It is the card you sent her for her birthday
 a few weeks ago, a safe, arty kind of card that showed you were
 thinking of her without suggesting anything soppy. You're surprised,
 but highly gratified, that she should have kept it this long.

>examine poster
 It's a monochrome photograph of a painting depicting sunset over the
 city. You recognize it as the winning entry in a recent art
 competition; the original hangs in the Art Gallery Market Street. The
 black and white photo is not nearly so striking as the oil-colour
 original, but perhaps the original would be too overpowering for a
 living room - at least you always find it a bit disturbing to look at.
 The photograph differs from the original in another odd way: the
 signature in the bottom right-hand corner should be her name, but
 instead it looks like MASTEMA.

>examine menu
 (first taking the menu)
 It's a menu from Lafayette's (in York Street). The selection of food
 looks as appetizing as ever, but it's of purely academic interest since
 they obviously won't be serving anything there tonight. In any case, a

>read menu
 It's a menu from Lafayette's (in York Street). The selection of food
 looks as appetizing as ever, but it's of purely academic interest since
 they obviously won't be serving anything there tonight. In any case, a

 at the top was her birthday.

 Gladstone Terrace
 This short cul-de-sac is noticeably less well lit than the main road
 just to the east; although the bright moonlight compensates for this
 somewhat, parts of the street lie in mysterious shadow. At its western
 end, the street terminates at the railway line, along the side of which
 lie a large number of loose stones. Just short of the tracks the block
 of flats where she lives stands on the south side of the street.

 You begin to feel you are being followed. You keep hearing footsteps
 behind you and seeing fleeting movements out of the corner of your eye
 when you look round. But every time you stop the footsteps stop, and
 you are left uncertain whether you're perceiving anything more than
 echoes and shadows.

 river, but just here the river bends towards the southeast and parts
 company with the road.

 Sussex Street (south)
 Although so far as you know this part of the city never suffered any
 bomb damage, some group of town planners rapidly made up for the
 negligence of the Luftwaffe by tearing down whatever was here before
 and replacing it with a mass of soulless fifties architecture seemingly
 inspired by Soviet brutalism. The most striking eyesore is the City
 Hospital, which lies immediately to the east. Sussex Street continues
 to north and south.

 Hospital Reception
 Hospitals can be depressing places at the best of times, and
 considerable effort has been put into ensuring that this one is no
 exception. The flickering light from a couple of fluorescent tubes does
 nothing to help, but the drab seating in the waiting area is the
 clincher. Opposite this seating stands the reception desk, currently
 unstaffed. Corridors lead off in all directions to operating theatres,
 offices, and wards, but the only one that looks at all tempting is the
 one that leads back out to the west.

 On the reception desk are a blue cassette and a brown telephone.

 You'll never forget waiting here, with her beside you, still wet from
 her misadventure and shaking from cold and shock. She made no objection
 when you put your arm round her, and even nestled her head on your
 shoulder, but there was nothing amorous about it, you were both worried
 sick about Kate and just looking for comfort. It didn't last all that
 long anyway, for it was only a few minutes until the doctor came out to
 confirm that Kate was dead.

 So then you spent the next few hours talking to the police.

 You have arrived at your destination.

>take cassette
 You pick up the blue cassette and examine it.

 It's just a standard tape cassette.

 You think you hear a helicopter over a distant quarter of the city, but
 before you can pinpoint the sound, it fades away.

>examine phone
 It's a rather large model, with lots of extra buttons.

>call 01921743589
 You see no reason to try doing that.

>examine desk
 The reception desk is a long, flat surface behind which there would
 normally be situated a receptionist busily engaged in keeping visitors
 from patients, patients from doctors, and useful information from
 absolutely everyone (with the possible exception of the police and
 security services). Right now, however, it is as deserted as everywhere
 else.

 On the reception desk is a brown telephone.

 That Russian-sounding voice you heard when you picked up the green
 phone in her office said something about delivering some merchandise to
 the central car park; perhaps that would be worth checking out.

 The signature MASTEMA on the poster in her flat makes you curious; if
 you happen to be passing the local art gallery in Market Street you'd
 like to check what's on the original.

 It would be interesting to know the significance of the phone number
 scribbled on the back of her business card.

>read card
 Which do you mean, the familiar birthday card or the business card?

>business
 It's one of her business cards. On the front is printed:

  "The TAS Agency
  Timely Accommodation for Students
  12 Devon Road
  01921 833758

 On the reverse side of the card another phone number has been written
 by hand: 01921 743589

>call 01921 743589
 You pick up the phone but there's nothing: no dialling tone, no static,
 just silence. You try to recover a dialling tone, but the phone remains
 obstinately dead, so you replace the handset.

>go west

 Sussex Street (south)
 Although so far as you know this part of the city never suffered any
 bomb damage, some group of town planners rapidly made up for the
 negligence of the Luftwaffe by tearing down whatever was here before
 and replacing it with a mass of soulless fifties architecture seemingly
 inspired by Soviet brutalism. The most striking eyesore is the City
 Hospital, which lies immediately to the east. Sussex Street continues
 to north and south.

 As you pause in your stride, you fancy you hear some distant footsteps
 receding to the north. Looking around, you notice a golden object lying
 on the ground under one of the streetlights.


>examine golden object
 (first taking the gold brooch)
 It's a gold brooch, in the form of a scorpion. The design is quite
 distinctive, and you're sure she has a brooch like that. You've often
 wondered what kind of statement it's meant to make: not that she's
 poisonous, to be sure, but you suspect she'd not be averse to
 suggesting she's not to be messed with.

 A small piece of paper is attached to the brooch by its pin.

>read paper
 Which do you mean, the small piece of paper, the crumpled piece of
 paper or the old newspaper?

>small
 It's tightly folded and pinned to the brooch.

>open brooch
 You release the clasp of the brooch and pull the small piece of paper
 from the pin, unfolding it impatiently.

>read small paper
 The handwriting is as small as the piece of paper it's written on, but
 you still recognise it as hers. It reads, "Sorry, couldn't wait - just
 discovered I've lost something I must recover: a small, grey, flat
 metal key. I may have dropped it when I went for a run (in the usual
 place) or when I went to the knowledge factory. We must make sure they
 don't get it. It would be a big help if you could search those two
 places while I look elsewhere. See you later."

 No doubt she was deliberately trying to be cryptic in case the Enemy
 saw her note. She often used to go for a run in Mandlebury Park, so she
 might mean that - or she might mean the City Sports Ground. "Knowledge
 Factory" was her disparaging nickname for the University, so she could
 be referring to somewhere on campus, but she could equally well be
 talking about the Public Library.

>close brooch
 That's not something you can close.

 Sussex Street (north)
 A row of large Edwardian town houses lines the west side of the street,
 overlooking the river to the east. The houses are all in darkness, and
 the street deserted, making it all seem not quite real. Sussex Street
 continues north to the Embankment and south towards the junction with
 Gladstone Terrace.

 You hear a loud bang in the distance: a gunshot? A car backfiring? A
 muffled explosion? A large object falling over? You cannot tell.

 Embankment
 The Embankment is the name given to this short stretch of road by
 Mandlebury Bridge, which spans the river to the east. To the west the
 Embankment is lined by a row of shops; to the north it becomes York
 Street, while to the south it runs into Sussex Street.

>c

 Mandlebury Bridge
 It's strange - almost unnatural - to see this bridge so deserted.
 You're more used to seeing it jammed with slow-moving rush-hour
 traffic, or at least a steady flow. But now there's nothing here apart
 from the bare tarmac, the street lights (one of which now has a large
 placard attached to it), the stone parapet, and the river sliding
 silently past below.

 Mandlebury Road (West)
 At this point Mandlebury Road is a broad, well-lit street, bordering
 the shadowy entrance to Mandlebury Park just to the north, and a
 traditional fish and chip shop to the south. The street continues east
 towards the city centre and west over Mandlebury Bridge.

 Mandlebury Park
 Although you've often been here in daylight, you've seldom visited the
 park by night before, and it looks quite different by moonlight. By day
 it's a pleasant, green open space overlooking the river to the west,
 but now it's shrouded in sinister black, cold and unwelcoming. The main
 exit onto Mandlebury Road lies to the south, but there's also a narrow
 lane off to the east leading to the High Street.

 High Street (by Post Office)
 This part of the High Street contains some of the oldest buildings in
 the city, and the old shop fronts have been mercifully preserved from
 the depredations of three generations of philistine post-war planners.
 The main post office on the west side of the street is a particularly
 fine example of Victorian architecture, but all the shops retain a
 measure of charm here, even when they're only selling mortgages or
 computer games. The High Street continues to north and south, while a
 narrow lane runs off to the west just by the post office.

 High Street (by your office)
 The High Street continues to north and south past rows of shops and
 small offices. One of the latter, directly to the west, is the office
 where you work.

>c
 (going west)
 This is where you work, so you have no difficulty letting yourself in.

 As you walk into the office you automatically switch on the lights.

 Your Office
 Your desk is just one among the many in this large open plan office;
 you have to be a partner to get an office to yourself here. On any
 normal working day most of the desks would be occupied by your fellow
 junior lawyers and the office clerks, and there'd be a constant
 low-level buzz of conversations punctuated by the irritating ringing of
 telephones. But now the office is as quiet and deserted as everywhere
 else in the city - too bad it takes the threat of the Enemy to create a
 more civilized working environment. Heading off in most directions
 would take you to private offices and sundry facilities, but the way
 back out to the High Street is to the east.

 On your desk is a white telephone.

 A letter is lying on the floor under Jeremy's desk, as if it has
 accidentally dropped out of an over-stuffed drawer.

 You have arrived at your destination.

>read letter
 (first taking the letter)
 It's a handwritten letter from Jeremy, dated about two years ago,
 breaking off his relationship with her. You re-read it, your eye
 stopping on phrases like, "I'm sorry, but it's over. I still find you
 as charming and attractive as I always did, and you can be great
 company, but I'm worn out by your need to always be the best at
 everything, and I've had enough of playing second fiddle to your
 ambition" and "We've had good times together, but I realize now that
 you're just not the woman for me" and "Even now I don't really feel I
 know you. I'm sure you do have a heart, but I've never felt you've ever
 really opened it to me; for such a successful woman you seem strangely
 repressed." The letter must obviously have been returned to him, since
 across the bottom is written in another hand: "You should have thought
 twice before rejecting me!"

>SAVE

>examine desk
 (your desk)
 It's unusually clear, but then no one was doing much work here today.
 Your desk has a single drawer.

 On your desk is a white telephone.

>open drawer
 You open the desk drawer, revealing a load of junk, amongst which you
 spot a photograph and a torch.

>examine photo
 It shows the climax of the graduation ceremony, with Kate shaking hands
 with the Vice-Chancellor as she receives the award for the best degree
 result of the year. A little way over to the left a group of graduands
 in academic robes stand looking on and applauding; among them are
 Jeremy, Nick, yourself - and her. It's her you look at, every bit as
 beautiful at twenty-one as she is today. She's applauding and smiling
 with the rest, but the smile looks a little forced - but perhaps that's
 just the photograph.

 A few weeks ago, Jeremy handed you this photograph saying, "I came
 across this the other day, and I thought you might like a copy."

 "Thanks!" you replied. You assume he gave it to you because it showed
 your graduation, but you were particularly pleased to have it because
 she was in it, and you didn't have any other pictures of her.

>think

 phone in her office said something about delivering some merchandise to

 She wants you to help her find a small flat metal key she says she's
 lost - it seems to be important. She thinks she may have dropped it out
 running, which could either be in Mandlebury Park (if she meant her
 lunch-time jog) or at the Sports Ground (if she was doing serious
 training). It's also possible she left the key either in the Public
 Library or somewhere on the University Campus.
 To have any chance of finding anything in the dark you'll need a torch
 - you're pretty sure you left one in your office.

>remember
 When time permits you often come here to eat your lunch on the park
 bench. On one such occasion about four years ago you saw her jogging
 past on a circuit of the park. The second time round, she stopped to
 catch her breath and chat. You can't remember a great deal of the
 conversation , but you do remember she was enthusing about some book
 she'd just read.

 "Have you read any Stanilev?" she asked.

 "I've never heard of him," you admitted.

 "He's a great thinker, you should read him, you really should," she
 urged you, "Until I read him I never realized anyone else could feel
 that way. It was so liberating!"

 But though you promised her you'd look out for a copy of Stanilev's
 book, somehow you never got round to it.

 mock-Tudor olde worlde pub - the Kings Arms - which stands directly
 opposite it to the west. The High Street continues to both north and

 when the moon emerges from behind the cloud once more there is nothing

 Market Street (west)
 Market Street runs east towards Cornwallis Avenue and west toward the
 High Street. It's the sort of intimate little street where crowds

 the street is empty, and the Grand Hotel stands open but seemingly
 deserted to the north.

 Art Gallery
 The proprietors of this gallery are clearly not greatly concerned about
 global warming, since the lights are all blazing brightly even though
 there's no one about to appreciate the paintings. The way out is to the
 north.

 Although art isn't really your thing, you came here about a year ago to
 see an exhibition of paintings entered into a competition for local
 amateurs. Or rather you came to see one painting in particular: her
 painting, the painting that won the competition.

 You have arrived at your destination.

>examine painting
 Her painting, the winning entry, is still prominently on display. It
 portrays the city at sunset, with the buildings silhouetted in front of
 a blazing red glow. The painting is certainly striking, but you find it
 a little disturbing; it almost makes it look as if the whole city is on
 fire. The painting is called "Nightfall". You check the signature at
 the bottom right-hand corner, but it looks like her name, not the
 mysterious MASTEMA of the poster in her flat - curiouser and curiouser.

>read signature
 Yes, it's her name all right: an anagram of MASTEMA, but not the
 MASTEMA on the poster in her flat, which presumably must be some kind
 of obscure joke.

>examine paintings
 Many of them are nice enough, but they're a bit of a mixture, and even
 you can tell that there are few really great paintings here, just some
 portraits of local worthies, some pleasant but conventional landscapes,
 a few abstract pieces, and some second-rate kitsch. By far the most
 striking painting on show is hers.

 You walk up to the main entrance of the hotel and step inside.

 Hotel Lobby
 Even in the dim light, the plushness of the lobby is unmistakeable,
 accentuated by the ubiquitous plush red furnishings. Indeed, this is a
 lobby in name only; in reality it's a lounge given the modest name
 "lobby" in order to impart a corresponding grandeur to the rest of the
 hotel. But the rest of the hotel seems to be in darkness right now, and
 the only viable exit is to the south, back out onto the street.

 Incongruously, a large trestle table has been set up in the middle of
 the Lobby.

 On the trestle table are a long rod and a khaki peaked cap.

 This place holds two poignant memories for you. The first is of Kate's
 21st birthday party; she needed somewhere large for all her friends.
 She was really dazzling that night, with her whole life before her.
 Alas, she never lived to see her 22nd birthday. The recollection of
 that evening brings home to you just how much you miss her still.

 The second is more recent, from about three years ago. You took her out
 to dinner here, a week or so after that drink in the Kings Arms. She,
 too, seemed really dazzling that night, sparkling with wit and
 conversation, utterly charming throughout the entire meal. Even though
 in hindsight some of the things she said may have been just a little
 odd, at the time you were just happy to enjoy her company -- until,
 right at the end, she dropped her little bombshell.

 "Thanks for a lovely evening, David," she told you, "but now there's
 something I really ought to tell you. I've just started seeing Jeremy."

 "Seeing Jeremy," you repeated dully, feeling the whole evening
 crumbling around you.

 "I mean I'm going out with him," she explained, as if you hadn't
 understood perfectly well what she meant.

 You have arrived at your destination.

>examine rod
 It looks a little like a baton, or perhaps a makeshift pointer.

 It's made of wood, of course. A large map has been pinned to the top.

 On the trestle table are a long rod and a khaki peaked cap.

 It's a large-scale map of the city. Thick black lines drawn on the map
 divide the city into regions with names like C12 and T18, while a

 Hotel Lobby
 Even in the dim light, the plushness of the lobby is unmistakeable,
 accentuated by the ubiquitous plush red furnishings. Indeed, this is a
 lobby in name only; in reality it's a lounge given the modest name
 "lobby" in order to impart a corresponding grandeur to the rest of the
 hotel. But the rest of the hotel seems to be in darkness right now, and
 the only viable exit is to the south, back out onto the street.

 Incongruously, a large trestle table has been set up in the middle of
 the Lobby.

>examine furnishings
 The furnishings lend a general air of sumptuousness to the place.

>point rod at table
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>look under table

>think
 That Russian-sounding voice you heard when you picked up the green
 phone in her office said something about delivering some merchandise to
 the central car park; perhaps that would be worth checking out.

 It would be interesting to know the significance of the phone number
 scribbled on the back of her business card.

 She wants you to help her find a small flat metal key she says she's
 lost - it seems to be important. She thinks she may have dropped it out
 running, which could either be in Mandlebury Park (if she meant her
 lunch-time jog) or at the Sports Ground (if she was doing serious
 training). It's also possible she left the key either in the Public
 Library or somewhere on the University Campus.

 (going south)
 You walk back out into Market Street.

 Market Street (west)
 Market Street runs east towards Cornwallis Avenue and west toward the
 High Street. It's the sort of intimate little street where crowds
 gather to go the pubs and wine bars and late-night boutiques, with the
 Grand Hotel attracting a fair amount of the custom. Tonight, though,
 the street is empty, and the Grand Hotel stands open but seemingly
 deserted to the north.

 You hear a loud clattering, as if someone had just accidentally knocked
 off a dustbin lid somewhere nearby to the east, but try as you might,
 you cannot see where the sound came from.

 Junction of High Street and Market Street
 The lighting is a bit better here, since it's a junction of two
 normally busy roads: the High Street continues to north and south,
 while Market Street heads off to the east.

 High Street (Outside Hairdressers and Pub)
 Amongst the various buildings lining the street here you particularly
 notice two: the glass-fronted Ladies' Hairdresser to the east and the
 mock-Tudor olde worlde pub - the Kings Arms - which stands directly
 opposite it to the west. The High Street continues to both north and
 south.

>c

 High Street (South)
 The High Street runs north to the City Centre and continues to the
 south. A narrow alley runs off to the east, opposite a newsagent to the
 west.

 You hear the sound of a car, so you hastily retreat into the shadows
 once more as the headlights approach. A police patrol car drives past,
 apparently still looking for stragglers.

 Car Park
 It's normally near impossible to find a parking space in this town
 centre car park at any time between 8 am and midnight, but now there's
 scarcely a vehicle in sight. The main car park exit into Mandlebury
 Street is to the north, but there's also a narrow alley leading west to
 the High Street.

 The only vehicle parked here is a large lorry.

 You have arrived at your destination.

>examine lorry
 It's a very large lorry, of the kind that permanently risks doing
 serious damage to narrow streets. It may be painted a dark maroon
 colour, but it's rather hard to tell by moonlight. What you can make
 out is the lettering on the side proclaiming "Myles Biggar Haulage -
 tel: 01921 743589 - Main Depot: 54 Hythe Bridge Street". At the rear of
 the lorry is a single tambour door which is currently securely shut. At
 the other end the driver's cab looms well off the ground.

 You hear some footsteps behind you and turn to see a man walking
 briskly towards you. As soon as he catches sight of you, however, he
 turns and hurries away down the narrow alley.

>examine business card
 It's one of her business cards. On the front is printed:

  "The TAS Agency

 City Centre
 The junction where the High Street crosses Mandlebury Road is generally
 reckoned to be the central point of the city. From here the High Street
 runs north up past your office and south towards Preston Bridge and the
 ring road, while Mandlebury Road runs east towards the police station
 and west towards the river. Most of the buildings on the junction are
 closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit,
 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.

>c

 High Street (by Post Office)
 This part of the High Street contains some of the oldest buildings in
 the city, and the old shop fronts have been mercifully preserved from
 the depredations of three generations of philistine post-war planners.
 The main post office on the west side of the street is a particularly
 fine example of Victorian architecture, but all the shops retain a
 measure of charm here, even when they're only selling mortgages or
 computer games. The High Street continues to north and south, while a
 narrow lane runs off to the west just by the post office.

 The High Street continues to north and south past rows of shops and

 Junction of High Street and College Street
 The High Street (from the south) comes to an end at a fork where
 College Street runs off to the northeast and Hythe Bridge Street to the
 northwest.

 About two years ago you ran into her here as you were walking home, and
 she was doing the same, both of you rather later than normal. Your
 paths would normally have taken you in opposite directions, but instead
 of turning to walk down the High Street she took a detour up Hythe
 Bridge Street to walk along beside you.

 "Today has not been a good day," she explained, "I could do with seeing
 a friendly face!"

 So you walked on up Hythe Bridge Street together, but she seemed
 unwilling to say what was wrong.

 Hythe Bridge Street (south)
 Hythe Bridge Street is quite narrow, being one of the oldest parts of
 the city. It narrows even further as it approaches an old stone bridge
 to the northwest; to the southeast it runs towards a junction with the
 High Street. On the south side of the street stands a large haulage
 depot, round the side of which a narrow alley runs to the southwest.

 Short Alley
 This short alley comes to the end a few yards away from the street,
 which lies just to the northeast. A high wall runs along the east side
 of the alley, with a small window about seven feet off the ground at
 the end furthest from the street.

>examine window
 It's about seven feet off the ground, and about two foot square. It's
 currently closed.

 You are carrying a khaki peaked cap, a long rod, a torch, a gold

 Hythe Bridge Street (north)
 Hythe Bridge street runs over an old stone bridge to the southeast and

 War to the Victorian; prominent among the latter is the Old Library,
 which stands just to the north.

 Just use the command THINK, or for more specific hints THINK HARDER.

>remember park
 (Mandlebury Park)
 In Mandlebury Park you remembered:
 When time permits you often come here to eat your lunch on the park
 bench. On one such occasion about four years ago you saw her jogging
 past on a circuit of the park. The second time round, she stopped to
 catch her breath and chat. You can't remember a great deal of the
 conversation , but you do remember she was enthusing about some book
 she'd just read.

 "Have you read any Stanilev?" she asked.

 "I've never heard of him," you admitted.

 "He's a great thinker, you should read him, you really should," she
 urged you, "Until I read him I never realized anyone else could feel
 that way. It was so liberating!"

 But though you promised her you'd look out for a copy of Stanilev's
 book, somehow you never got round to it.

>c
 (going northwest)
 Junction of York Street and Hythe Bridge Street
 Beyond the point where York Street meets Hythe Bridge Street, it runs
 on into a residential suburb. Hythe Bridge Street runs off to the
 southeast, while York Street runs south towards the railway station.

 About two years ago you had walked up from the other end of Hythe
 Bridge Street with her one evening, as she'd taken a slight detour from
 her normal route. You had stopped at this junction, since her way home
 lay south and yours lay north. It was just at this point on your walk
 that she came closest opening herself up to you.

 "Would you say I was a failure?" she asked.

 "Certainly not!" You declared, surprised by her question, "I've never
 known anyone succeed at so many things!"

 "But not everything," she sighed, "and maybe not at anything really
 important."

 On impulse you offered, "Shall I walk you home?"

 "Why not?" she replied.

 So you'd both headed south together, and you tried to get her to expand
 on what she had just said, but somehow the moment had been lost and she
 insisted on changing the subject.

 Sports Ground
 You can't see anything clearly here in this light, but you know there's
 a running track, a couple of football and rugby pitches, and some
 tennis courts, as well as a building containing changing rooms and the
 like. The street lamps in York Street indicate that the way out is to
 the east.

 You don't come here much, sport really isn't your thing. But you did
 come a few times that summer, to watch the tennis tournament. She was
 in it. She reached the finals. You're no expert on tennis, but she
 seemed to be totally in control all the time; it was almost as if she
 were dancing round the court rather than exerting herself.

 She, won, of course: at least she won the women's singles, although she
 didn't do quite so well in the mixed doubles. When you spoke to her
 afterwards she seemed to be almost more preoccupied with that failure
 than with her success: "That idiot Nick!" she complained, "He was like
 an uncoordinated lobster on court! We should have won!"

 You have arrived at your destination.

>turn on torch
 You switch the torch on.

 You see lights just outside the entrance to the Ground and hear a car
 draw up. A few moments later you hear footsteps and voices just at the
 entrance to the ground. Nervously, you hide in the shadows by the
 entrance, carefully concealing the light of your torch, as you listen
 to the conversation between the two officers:

 "Can't see anyone here, sarge."

 "I thought I saw someone come this way. Could be here, or they could
 have gone to Lafayette's."

 "Why would anyone still be here?"

 "Probably some lowlife looking for easy pickings now the city's
 deserted -- they've already done Morgans. Let's check the Sports Ground
 first."

 You freeze as the footsteps draw closer, but then they suddenly stop.
 You realize that one of the officers has just answered his mobile
 phone.

 "We'll have to leave it for now," he announces.  "Apparently someone
 was seen going into the cinema, and then control want us to check out
 something on the southern by-pass."

 "Right-oh, sarge. The sooner we're out of here the better!"

 "We can leave just as soon as we've taken a look at the cinema," the
 other voice promises, "They're packing up at the station now, so once
 we've dropped off the metal detector we may as push off too."

 The footsteps recede, and a few moments later the car drives off.

 You walk briskly through the tiny entrance hall and straight onto the
 dance floor.

 Old Library Dance Floor
 Although this place is called the Old Library, no one's read a book
 here in living memory. Since before you were born this hall has been
 hired out for social events, possibly including whist drives and WI
 jam-making classes (not that you've ever been near either), but to the
 best of your knowledge mainly various types of dance. A stage for a
 small band or DJ plus sound equipment occupies one end of the hall; the
 main exit, to the south, lies at the other.

 For some reason, the hall has been largely stripped of furniture, but a
 solitary plain wooden chair remains on the stage.

 The last time you were here was a couple of years or so ago. You mainly
 recall music too loud for conversation and a floor too crowded to dance
 on without bumping into people at every turn; it really wasn't your
 scene at all. You only bought a ticket because you knew she'd be here.
 And so she was, effortlessly elegant in plain black, standing out from
 all the others in their colourful finery like a princess among apes.
 You kept stealing hopeful glances at her all evening. Surprisingly, for
 much of the time she seemed to be dancing with some nerdish-looking
 teenager (at the time you supposed either that she must have felt sorry
 for him and was just being nice, or else that he must be some cousin
 she'd been lumbered with for the evening). At last, when you'd given up
 all hope and had gone in search of a refill for your glass, she came up
 to you and asked you for a dance. You'd been secretly hoping for a slow
 romantic sway, of course, but your luck being what it was all you got
 was an energetic jive. At least, she was commendably energetic about it
 (but graceful with it, of course), which left you feeling a bit like a
 lumbering elephant with four left feet in comparison. But at the time
 you felt that one dance made the whole evening worthwhile.

>dance

 This is embarrassing, the sort of petty burglary you sometimes find

 Hythe Bridge Street (south)
 Hythe Bridge Street is quite narrow, being one of the oldest parts of
 the city. It narrows even further as it approaches an old stone bridge
 to the northwest; to the southeast it runs towards a junction with the
 High Street. On the south side of the street stands a large haulage
 depot, round the side of which a narrow alley runs to the southwest.

 This part of the High Street contains some of the oldest buildings in

 The main post office on the west side of the street is a particularly
 fine example of Victorian architecture, but all the shops retain a

 computer games. The High Street continues to north and south, while a

 College Street (south)
 You're not old enough to remember, but this area was apparently
 farmland back in the sixties. In the seventies it was decreed that the
 city was to receive a new university, and so College Street was
 created. The main university campus lies further up the street to the
 northeast, but in order to create something of an academic atmosphere
 at its gateway, so to speak, a new Public Library was erected, which
 now stands to the south, along with a new theatre, the Apollo, which is
 just off to the northwest. To the southwest College Street runs back
 towards the High Street.

 (going south)
 The Public Library is meant to have long opening hours, and it seems no
 one saw fit to lock it up in the confusion of the evacuation. You hurry
 through the entrance lobby and go straight to the main reading room.

 Public Library
 From the central hub aisles of books run off in every direction except
 north, which is the way out. The library desk is, of course, unstaffed,
 but there's a computer terminal on it which appears to be working.

 You remember coming here about four or five years ago to borrow a
 novel, and seeing her sitting off to one side, concentrating on some
 book. You exchanged smiles, but that was about as far as you got before
 a frown from a fierce librarian silenced your incipient greeting.

 You have arrived at your destination.

 You are already at your destination.

>remember park
 (Mandlebury Park)
 In Mandlebury Park you remembered:
 When time permits you often come here to eat your lunch on the park
 bench. On one such occasion about four years ago you saw her jogging
 past on a circuit of the park. The second time round, she stopped to
 catch her breath and chat. You can't remember a great deal of the
 conversation , but you do remember she was enthusing about some book
 she'd just read.

 "Have you read any Stanilev?" she asked.

 "I've never heard of him," you admitted.

 "He's a great thinker, you should read him, you really should," she
 urged you, "Until I read him I never realized anyone else could feel
 that way. It was so liberating!"

 But though you promised her you'd look out for a copy of Stanilev's
 book, somehow you never got round to it.

>look up stanilev
 (on the computer)
 The computer comes up with one entry:

 A.D. Stanilev Nightfall - D.143

 Looking round, you notice that aisle D is to the northeast.

>go northeast

 Aisle D
 Like every other aisle in the library, this one is lined on both sides
 by bookshelves. The only way out is to the southwest.

>get nightfall

 Aisle D
 Like every other aisle in the library, this one is lined on both sides
 by bookshelves. The only way out is to the southwest.

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine shelves
 The shelves are full of books.

 By following the indexing you easily find D.143, where Stanilev's book
 is in place. You duly take it.

>read book
 The introduction states that the book will explain the one true
 philosophy: love is best expressed in destruction, since Entropy rules
 all and Decay is the natural order of things. The sole end of life is
 death and to love death is to be in tune with the universe. The one
 goal of existence is the heat death of the Universe, the ultimate
 Nightfall.

 Turning to the last page you find that the book ends with a bitter
 parody of St Paul: "Death, destruction and decay, these three things
 abide, but the greatest of these is death."

 This is about as much as you can bear to read.

>go southwest
 You hurry through the entrance lobby once more and go straight to the
 main reading room.

 Public Library
 From the central hub aisles of books run off in every direction except
 north, which is the way out. The library desk is, of course, unstaffed,
 but there's a computer terminal on it which appears to be working.

>look up bomb

 You quickly discover that access to any potentially useful sites on
 this topic have been blocked; presumably whoever set up the library
 computer thought this type of information might be useful to
 terrorists.

 You're concerned about that big cylinder you found in the back of the

 Looking round, you notice that Aisle R is to the south.

>go south

 Aisle R
 There are a large number of reference works on the shelves here. The

 You pick up the large Russian dictionary and examine it.

 It's a large, well-presented dictionary that explains the Cyrillic
 alphabet and is helpful as it can be for the absolute beginner. It
 won't help you read War and Peace in the original with ease, but it
 should help you translate a few simple phrases.

 You see a movement in the distance off to the southwest, but you can't
 make out who or what it is, and it's gone before you can focus on it.

>go northwest
 You walk up to the front of the Apollo and find it unlocked, so you go
 inside.

 Theatre Lobby
 The ticket office is closed, and there's no one about, but there seems
 to be nothing to stop you wandering into the auditorium, which lies
 just to the north. The main exit is to the southeast.

 A poster advertising the next show is fixed to the wall, but it looks
 like someone has defaced it.

>examine poster
 The poster advertises a new play called "Martian Mores" by an author so
 obscure that it would be surprising if even his own mother has heard of
 him. Across the poster someone has written, apparently in red lipstick,
 the words "Beware the Enemy within!", although you can't be sure it's
 not meant to be part of the poster.

>go north
 Theatre Auditorium
 In the dim half-light you can just make out the outlines of the seating
 and the distant stage. An illuminated sign indicates that the exit is
 to the south.

 The sole item of scenery on the stage is a canvas chair.

 Not all the events held here were as representative of high culture as
 the builders of this theatre might have hoped. Three or four years ago
 the city held a contest here to choose a beauty queen for some local
 pageant. Of course she was one of the contestants, and of course she
 won; most of the other contestants were pretty enough but next to her
 beauty they struck you as fireflies competing with the sun. It wasn't
 just a matter of her looks, though she certainly looked drop-dead
 gorgeous that night; she also clearly had far more poise, far more
 intelligence, and far more personality than the rest of them put
 together.

>examine chair
 It's a canvas chair with a steel frame. It looks like there may be
 something on the chair, but from this distance you can't be sure.

>go north
 You can't go that way. The only obvious exit is south (to Theatre
 Lobby).

>stand on stage
 You get onto the stage.

 On the stage you can see a canvas chair (on which is a portable
 cassette player (closed)).

 with buttons marked PLAY, STOP, REWIND and EJECT.

>get player

>push play
 Some music begins to play, belting out in an insistent 5/4 rhythm. You
 recognize it as the first movement of Holst's Planets Suite -- Mars,
 the Bringer of War. The tape comes to an end and the cassette player
 stops with a click.

 You hear her voice speaking from the cassette player: "It's all a lie,
 you know, about the Enemy, I mean. Oh, there is an Enemy all right, but
 they're not telling us the truth about who or what the Enemy is. The
 government, the police, the army, the security services -- they're all
 in the know, but they're not telling. That's why I need to stay here,
 to deal with the Enemy, but I don't think I can do it alone. I can't
 say more right now - this tape might fall into the wrong hands - but
 I'll explain it all when I see you. In the meantime I'll try to get a
 message to you; and for goodness' sake watch out, stay clear of the
 police, and don't trust anyone. As for the Enemy -- well, just keep
 your wits about you and don't believe any of the official
 pronouncements. I'll be in touch again soon."

 Silence. The tape comes to an end and the cassette player stops with a
 click.

 You walk to the front entrance of the Police Station and listen
 carefully for any signs of life inside. According to what you

 listen for several moments but hear nothing, so you proceed cautiously
 inside.

 Police Station Reception Area
 The reception area is deserted - it would seem that the police have
 indeed fled the city (or at least, this station). Access deeper inside
 the police station is firmly blocked by the front desk, but it all
 looks pretty dark beyond there in any case. Otherwise the area is
 largely bare apart from the exit to the north and the ventilation
 grille high up in one wall.

 On the front desk is a yellow document.

 A metal detector leans abandoned against the desk.

 The last time you were here was when the police called you in to go
 over your statement about Kate's drowning, just a couple of days before
 the Inquest at the Coroner's Court just round the corner. They seemed
 particularly interested in what you could tell them about Kate's state
 of mind, but you couldn't really add much to the statement you'd given
 them in the Hospital just after the event.

 You have arrived at your destination.

>examine document
 (first taking the evacuation order)
 It's printed on bright yellow paper and headed "EVACUATION ORDER". A
 quick perusal of the document reveals that the police first received a
 warning about the Enemy only last night. It was originally dismissed as
 a hoax, until a message came through from the security services saying
 that the Enemy were to be regarded as a Level 1 threat, and  the city
 was to be evacuated immediately.

 The next few paragraphs detail the procedures for publishing a warning
 and getting everyone out of the city as quickly as possible. You skip
 over the dry officialese that already feels like ancient history.

 Right at the end, however, you find a striking conclusion: "To avoid
 unnecessary panic, on no account are the public to be informed about
 the true nature of the "Enemy". In reality what we're dealing with
 is..."

 Frustratingly, the bottom of the page has been torn off at just this
 point.

 York Street (South)
 This part of York Street has moved considerably up-market in recent
 years. The old Victorian terraces lining the west side of the street
 may be small, and were probably built for Victorian labourers, but the
 recent hike in property prices makes them the best that many young
 professionals can afford. They lack nearby parking spaces, but that
 wouldn't be a problem tonight; there isn't a single car in sight;
 everyone with a car has used it to get away. The eerily deserted street
 continues alongside the river to north and south.

 You think you hear a voice nearby, just off to the south but even when
 you turn round you can see no one there. Perhaps you just imagined it.

 Junction of York Street and Station Road
 This is normally one of the busiest junctions in the city, mainly due
 to the traffic from the railway station, but now there isn't so much as
 a bicycle in sight, just the ever-present street lighting, the river
 running by to the east, and the sign pointing north towards the City
 Sports Ground, south towards Mandlebury Bridge and the Hospital, and
 west towards the Railway Station.

 Hythe Bridge Street (north)
 Hythe Bridge street runs over an old stone bridge to the southeast and
 on to a junction with York Road to the northwest. A mixture of old
 buildings lines the street, representing every period from the Civil
 War to the Victorian; prominent among the latter is the Old Library,
 which stands just to the north.

 Hythe Bridge Street (south)
 Hythe Bridge Street is quite narrow, being one of the oldest parts of
 the city. It narrows even further as it approaches an old stone bridge
 to the northwest; to the southeast it runs towards a junction with the
 High Street. On the south side of the street stands a large haulage
 depot, round the side of which a narrow alley runs to the southwest.

>think
 You're concerned about that big cylinder you found in the back of the

 College Street (south)
 You're not old enough to remember, but this area was apparently

 city was to receive a new university, and so College Street was
 created. The main university campus lies further up the street to the
 northeast, but in order to create something of an academic atmosphere
 at its gateway, so to speak, a new Public Library was erected, which
 now stands to the south, along with a new theatre, the Apollo, which is
 just off to the northwest. To the southwest College Street runs back

 This large entrance lobby has a depressingly institutional appearance
 at the best of times. Dimly lit, with the rest of the building in
 sullen darkness, it feels oppressively gloomy. There are two main
 exits, to Devon Road to the south or College Street to the west.

 A prominent notice is affixed to the centre of the main notice board.

 You ran into her here in your first week as a student. You hesitated to
 approach her because, in all conscience, you hardly knew her, but while
 you were debating with yourself whether it was worth trying to renew
 your acquaintance, she flashed you a lovely smile and walked up to you.

 "Hello," she said, tossing her long dark hair over back her shoulder,
 "don't I know you? We were at primary school together, weren't we?"

 "That's right," you agreed, "though it seems a long time ago now. I'm
 flattered you remember!"

 "It's nice to see a familiar face!" she told you, "so what are you
 reading here?"

 "Law," you told her,  "and you?"

 "English," she replied, adding with a laugh "much less practical!
 Talking of which, I'm in danger late of being late for my first Dickens
 lecture, and I'd hate to upset my prof on my first day, so I'd better
 dash before Great Expectations turn into Bleak House! We'll catch up
 later."

 And after a fashion, over the next three years you did, but nowhere
 near as much as you'd have liked.

 University Hall (in darkness)
 It's dark in here, so you can't see much. Indeed, you can scarcely see
 your hand in front of your face. The only way out you know of is to the
 west.

 You attended three or four quite unmemorable lectures here when you
 were a student, but you mainly remember this hall for the two
 University rites of passage: matriculation and graduation. You can't
 even recall seeing her at the former, but she was definitely at the
 latter, and quite out of sorts that day -- you could scarcely get a
 cold nod out of her, let alone a word.

>turn on torch
 You switch the torch on.

 University Hall
 The hall is too large to make out very satisfactorily by torchlight;
 you can't even locate the light-switches. You can see that there's a
 lot of seating here, and sweeping the torch round in the other
 direction reveals a raised dais, but you can't get much sense of the
 whole. But you remember that when you attended the university the hall
 was a piece of rather bland sixties architecture done out in acres of
 pale pine, and this memory helps fill out the patchy picture revealed
 by torchlight. The way out is to the west.

>turn on detector
 That's already on.

>use detector
 You start walking round the hall, sweeping the beam of your torch over
 the seats. You search comes to an abrupt halt when you spot something
 lying between two rows of seats. A closer inspection reveals it to be a
 body.

>examine body
 You're no doctor, but you can detect no signs of life, and from the
 awkward angle of the head you'd guess that the young man's neck has
 been broken. His face looks vaguely familiar: it looks as if it could
 be the geek you saw grinning out of the picture on the Residence Hall
 poster.

 It was hard to see how she could have fallen off the bridge by
 accident, but nothing anyone who knew her said suggested any motive for
 suicide. The local press ended up attributing Kate's death to a "tragic
 accident" and hinting darkly about young people who drank too much -
 but you'd never known Kate to get drunk.

 Club Terrace
 The terrace forms part of the student club premises, but has the merit
 of being in the open air, overlooking the river. The clubhouse stands

 When you were a student, perhaps in your second year, you attended a
 particularly dire party in the club. All that smoke and beer and loud
 music wasn't really your scene, and the more everyone else around you
 seemed to be having "fun", the more fed up you felt, until eventually
 you wandered out here for some kind of relief from it all.

 You hadn't been out here that long when she came to join you,
 announcing her arrival by laying a friendly hand on your shoulder.
 "Hello," she said, "I hope you're not avoiding me!"

 "Certainly not!" you replied, "You're the last person I'd want to
 avoid!"

 "I'm glad to hear it," she smiled.

 "Shall we go somewhere else then?" you suggested hopefully, "How about
 a quiet drink at the KA?"

 For one moment you thought she was about to say yes, but instead she
 dashed your hope with an apologetic shake of the head. "Some other
 time," she replied, "I'd better go in; I'm with people." Then, with a
 parting pat on your arm, she turned away and went off to join the party
 in the club. It was several more years before you had that drink with
 her in the Kings Arms.

 before.

>examine brooch
 It's a gold brooch, in the form of a scorpion. The design is quite
 distinctive, and you're sure she has a brooch like that. You've often
 wondered what kind of statement it's meant to make: not that she's
 poisonous, to be sure, but you suspect she'd not be averse to
 suggesting she's not to be messed with.

>examine small paper
 Which do you mean, the small scrap of yellow paper or the small piece
 of paper?

>piece
 The handwriting is as small as the piece of paper it's written on, but
 you still recognise it as hers. It reads, "Sorry, couldn't wait - just
 discovered I've lost something I must recover: a small, grey, flat
 metal key. I may have dropped it when I went for a run (in the usual
 place) or when I went to the knowledge factory. We must make sure they
 don't get it. It would be a big help if you could search those two
 places while I look elsewhere. See you later."

 Just below that you see a crease that you missed before - you must have
 been in too much of a hurry, or maybe the light was too bad. Anyway,
 you unfold the crease and see that she has written:

 "I'll meet you where I left the tape for you at five past two. Don't be
 late!"

 then bends towards the south. It is a broad, pleasant street which
 feels particularly peaceful by moonlight. At this end the buildings are
 not too closely crowded together, the largest of them being the hall of
 residence to the north.

>go south

 Devon Road (mid)
 Devon Road continues north and south between leafy gardens and the
 occasional small office. In the latter category is the student letting
 office where she works, which stands just to the east.

>go south

 Junction of Devon Road and Church Street
 This three-way road junction is well lit. Devon Road leads off to the
 north, Tilbury Road to the east, and Church Street to the southwest.
 Immediately to the south of the junction stands the High School you
 attended as a teenager.

>go southwest

 Church Street Bus Stop
 The bus stop stands at the junction of Church Street, which runs
 northeast and southwest from here, and School Lane, which leads off to
 the south.

>go southwest

 Church Street
 Church Street runs up the hill to the northeast and down to the
 southwest past rows of prickly bushes, while directly to the north a
 lych-gate leads through to St Michael's church yard.

>go north

 Churchyard
 A churchyard by moonlight is always a little spooky, but it is doubly
 so tonight, with the city so deserted. The gravestones are little more
 than looming shadows in the dark; the great bulk of St Michael's Church
 is just to the north, while the lych-gate to the south leads back out
 to Church Street.

>turn on torch
 You switch the torch on.

>examine kate's grave
 It's too dark to make any of them out except by shining your torch on
 them individually, but you know Kate's is among them somewhere, and
 you'd have no difficulty finding it in the light. But scanning each
 gravestone one by one with your torch would take far too long,
 especially as it would do nothing to help you find her.

>go north

 Nave
 St Michael's has a large nave, built at a time when Victorian
 congregations were booming. The original wooden pews are still here,
 facing the chancel to the east, as is the original Victorian stained
 glass, all but invisible in the poor light. The way out is to the
 south, next to the large stone font at the rear of the church.

>use detector
 Your search turns up nothing of interest.

>go south
 You turn off the torch to save its battery.

>unlock door with iron key
 You unlock the small wooden door.

>go north
 (first opening the small wooden door)

 Vestry
 A plain wooden table runs under the window of this small, narrow room,
 with an old-fashioned safe set into the opposite wall. The only way out
 is via the door to the south.

 You can see a large blue diary here.

>unlock safe with small key
>examine safe
 Which do you mean, the small flat metal key, the small brass key or the
 office key?

 All you can see of it is the green-painted metal door set into the
 wall. It's unlikely to contain anything of interest, just crosses,
 candlesticks and communion wafers.

>flat

>unlock safe with flat key
 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>examine diary
 (first taking the large blue diary)
 You flick through the diary. It's mainly a record of services and
 parish meetings, but you find an entry from two days ago that catches
 your eye: "Meet DS at KA 2 pm". "KA" is likely to be the Kings Arms,
 the pub in the High Street.

>examine recorder
 It's scarcely bigger than a cassette. It also looks broken, as if
 smashed when its owner fell.

>fix recorder
 What do you want to fix the tiny cassette-recorder to?

>examine mat
 The front of it bears a crude depiction of the Kings Arms, and a slogan
 advertising "Mottles Real Ale". On the back someone has scribbled:

 A large car park lies immediately to the south, while Church Street
 forks off to the northeast. Mandlebury Road continues to both east
 (past the Police Station) and west (back to the City Centre).

>go south

 Car Park
 It's normally near impossible to find a parking space in this town
 centre car park at any time between 8 am and midnight, but now there's
 scarcely a vehicle in sight. The main car park exit into Mandlebury

 the High Street.

 The only vehicle parked here is a large lorry.

 It's a large lorry, and there'd be a fair amount of space in here if it
 weren't nearly all taken up by a large metal cylinder.

>translate cyrillic
 It's a struggle, but with the aid of the dictionary you manage to

 "radio-controlled detonator".

 Crossroads
 Well lit by the street lighting, this crossroads is formed by the
 intersection of Mandlebury Road running from east to west, School Lane
 running north, and Cornwallis Avenue running to the south.

>go north

 School Lane
 School Lane is a relatively short street running north up to the
 junction with Church Street and south to Cornwallis Avenue. It's mainly
 residential, but the primary school you attended is on this street; its
 playground is just to the east.

>go east
 Playground
 Little more than a large concreted square partly walled off from the
 road, this area serves as playground (and occasionally overflow car
 park) to the primary school you attended twenty years ago. The school
 building is just to the east, set a little further back from the road,
 but it looks dark and all locked up. With no light from the building
 and little from the street, the playground feels a strange, dark place,
 bathed in eerie moonlight. The street is just off to the west.

 This was a co-ed school, and this playground was where you first saw
 her, all those years ago. Perhaps your recollection of that first
 encounter has been coloured by events of the last two decades, but as
 you recall it, when your eyes met across the playground it was as if
 everything else around receded into two-dimensional monochrome, and she
 was the only three-dimensional technicolour object left in your field
 of view. Again, as you recall, she smiled shyly at you, and you went
 and introduced yourself in your earnest six-year-old fashion, but so
 much fantasy and wishful thinking has surrounded the frequent rehearsal
 of that memory that you can't really remember what either of you
 actually said.

 Cornwallis Avenue Nth
 Cornwallis Avenue runs straight down from the crossroads to the north
 and continues to the south. Amongst the buildings lining this part of
 the street is the Coroner's Court just to the east.

 You remember you had to attend the Coroner's Court after Kate drowned.
 It was a miserable business; the police doctor had confirmed that
 Kate's death was by drowning, but as you'd arrived on the scene so soon
 after she had fished Kate out of the river that you were an important
 witness. Although she (your friend, that is) said she'd seen Kate jump
 off the bridge, there was no suicide note and no evidence that Kate was
 feeling suicidal, so in the end the coroner's jury reached a verdict of
 death by misadventure. With the wisdom of hindsight you wish they'd
 been a bit more thorough and a lot more suspicious.

>go south

 Cornwallis Avenue (south)
 Cornwallis Avenue continues to north and south. The Odeon Cinema stands
 just to the east.

>go east
 You walk into the foyer, take a quick look round, and then proceed into
 the main auditorium.

 Cinema Auditorium
 It's almost totally dark in here, so you can hardly see anything apart
 from the bare outlines of the seats and the screen, and, of course, the
 exit to the west.

 You came here once with her to see a film when you were both students,
 it was one of the few occasions you actually went out with her. If you
 remember rightly the film was Titanic, but at the time you were much
 more interested in her than the film. Typically, she seemed so much
 more interested in the film than you that she didn't even notice where
 your interest lay.

>turn on torch
 You switch the torch on.

 Market Street (to the west) comes to an end at this junction with
 Cornwallis Avenue (running to north and south). Opposite Market street
 stands a small electronics store called The Radio Shop.

>go south

 London Road
 South of the junction with Market Street, Cornwallis Avenue becomes the
 London Road, and its character changes to match. The area looks
 grubbier and slightly more run-down. For the most part the road is
 lined with parades of uninviting-looking shops with blocks of flats
 built above them. Incongruously, the Fairfax Hall occupies one block on
 the east side of the road. The road itself runs north and south.

>go east
 The Concert Hall (in darkness)
 The auditorium is shrouded in semi-darkness, but you're quite familiar
 with it. It was designed to be multi-purpose, so, for example, that
 opera could be staged here as well as concerts.

 You've attended many concerts here over the years, many of them good,
 but the one you remember best is the amateur performance of The
 Marriage of Figaro in which she sang the part of Cherubino. You thought
 she sang like an angel, and in your mind's ear you can still hear her
 beautiful rendition of the aria "Voi che sapete" - "You who know what
 love is". You came back to hear her again several nights in succession;
 it's fortunate that you're so fond of Mozart.

>turn on torch
 You switch the torch on.

 Concert Hall
 The auditorium is shrouded in semi-darkness, but you're quite familiar
 with it. It was designed to be multi-purpose, so, for example, that
 opera could be staged here as well as concerts. A quick sweep of the
 area with the beam of your torch indicates nothing untoward, and in
 particular reveals no sign of her or anyone else. But you do spot a
 lectern on the stage, suggesting that the hall may recently have been
 used for something other than music, as does some of the litter left on
 the seats. The way out is to the west.

>examine litter
 The beam of your torch picks out some half-eaten sandwiches, folded
 copies of today's newspaper, the odd folder or two, even a military
 beret -- all suggesting that the people most recently here probably
 wasn't a typical concert audience.

>examine lectern
 (first climbing onto the stage)
 It's just an old wooden lectern, of plain utilitarian design. On closer
 inspection, it could almost be a conductor's music stand.

 You find a civil defence manual on the lectern.

>take manual
 You pick up the civil defence manual and examine it.

 It seems to be all about what to do in the event of a nuclear attack.
 It doesn't quite say "Dig a two-metre trench and lie in it", but at a
 quick glance the advice offered doesn't seem much more useful than
 that.

>take beret
 None of the stuff left on the seats looks worth bothering with.

 As you emerge from the Fairfax Hall you hear the distant clack of
 footsteps on the pavement, and turn to see a distant figure
 disappearing off to the south.

>go south
 Elmbridge Roundabout
 Elmbridge Roundabout is one of those huge roundabouts built on the edge
 of cities with the apparent intention of smoothing the traffic flow and
 the normal effect of snarling it up. Tonight, however, there is not a
 single vehicle in sight. The east and west exits lead to the ring road,
 the southern exit to the motorway, and the north exit back into the
 city.

 Whoever's footsteps it was that you heard just now, there's no one in
 sight here.

>go west
 Elm Bridge
 You must have driven down this section of road a dozen times without
 being more than minimally aware that it crosses the river at this
 point, but on foot it's all too obvious; you can stop and stare at the
 moonlight reflecting off the water without a single car headlight to
 disturb you. The ring road continues to both east and west.

 You vividly recall one occasion when you were driving this way. It was
 shortly after graduation and you were driving a group of friends back
 from a celebratory party. The traffic suddenly slowed to a crawl and
 you became aware of flashing blue lights a short way up ahead.

 "Quick; change places with me," she said.

 "But..." you began to protest.

 "Don't argue, there isn't much time." she insisted.

 There was something about her tone of voice that silenced any further
 argument, so you surreptitiously changed places before the traffic
 started moving again. A few dozen yards further on the police stopped
 the car and asked her to blow into a breathalyzer (there weren't meant
 to be random breath tests in those days, but they found some pretext).
 She, of course, was clean. To this day you don't know whether you would
 have been, but you're profoundly grateful that it wasn't put to the
 test.

>go west

 Ring Road East
 Walking along the ring road feels positively eerie; after all, it was
 built for cars, not pedestrians, and normally it wouldn't even be
 possible to walk here. But now it's totally deserted, apart from a
 large advertising hoarding by the side of the road. The ring road
 continues westwards to Oak Tree Roundabout and eastwards over Elm
 Bridge.

 Suddenly, the silence is rent by the roar of engines. You leap out of
 the way just in time as a sports car races past, hotly pursued by a
 police car with lights flashing and sirens blazing. Both cars vanish
 off to the west, and the road falls silent once more.

>examine hoarding
 The best-illuminated poster is one that declares:

>go west

 Oak Tree Roundabout
 This large roundabout is normally busy and frequently congested; seeing
 it without a car in sight seems distinctly strange. There are four
 exits from the roundabout: to east and west is the ring road; to the
 north the road over Preston Bridge into the city centre, and to the
 south the dual carriageway heading out into the country.

>go south
 That's one of the main routes out of the city. She can't have gone that
 way.

>go north

 Preston Bridge
 This bridge is normally something of a bottleneck at rush hour, but now
 it's just as deserted as everywhere else in the city. It's a bit too
 narrow for the volume of traffic it normally has to take, but its old
 stone parapets overlooking the river make it too historic to widen.

>go north

 Junction of High Street and Market Street
 The lighting is a bit better here, since it's a junction of two
 normally busy roads: the High Street continues to north and south,
 while Market Street heads off to the east.

>go north

 High Street (Outside Hairdressers and Pub)
 Amongst the various buildings lining the street here you particularly
 notice two: the glass-fronted Ladies' Hairdresser to the east and the
 mock-Tudor olde worlde pub - the Kings Arms - which stands directly
 opposite it to the west. The High Street continues to both north and

 The High Street runs north to the City Centre and continues to the

 west.

>go north

 City Centre
 The junction where the High Street crosses Mandlebury Road is generally
 reckoned to be the central point of the city. From here the High Street
 runs north up past your office and south towards Preston Bridge and the
 ring road, while Mandlebury Road runs east towards the police station
 and west towards the river. Most of the buildings on the junction are
 closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit,
 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.

>go southwest
 You walk cautiously towards the bank, wondering if there's anyone
 inside. You pause outside, just by the imposing classical pillars that
 surround the entrance, and listen for signs of life. Hearing nothing,
 you carry on inside.

 Morgans Bank
 The bank is deserted now, but it looks like someone was here not too
 long ago: the service counter is surrounded by broken glass. That
 presumably explains why the bank is unlocked and the lights left on;
 whoever has just robbed the bank didn't hang around to lock up and turn
 out the lights. The street exit is to the northeast.

 A heavy mallet left lying among the shards of glass indicates pretty
 clearly how the barrier was broken.

 You ran into her here about eighteen months ago; she was just ahead of
 you in the queue.

 "Oh, hello!" she said, with one of her brighter smiles, "Are you here
 to take all your money out too? These people obviously can't be trusted
 with it!"

 "Why not?" you asked.

 "Didn't you hear about it on the news?" she replied, "Someone hacked
 into Morgans' mainframe and siphoned off a couple of million. Doesn't
 say much for their security, does it?"

>take mallet
 You pick up the heavy mallet.

>examine mallet
 It has a long wooden handle and a massive metal head.

>examine counter
 The service counter is deserted, of course, but it is also surrounded
 by broken glass, a hole having been smashed through the barrier that
 would normally protect it. It looks as if some crooks have taken
 advantage of the evacuation to commit a tempting felony.

 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.

>go northeast
 The supermarket is all locked up; you can't get in.

>examine supermarket
 The supermarket occupies the entire corner on which it stands, and was
 seemingly designed by an architect desperate to win the International
 Bland Building of the Millennium contest. Through its plate glass
 window you can see the front part of the shop is partially lit, perhaps
 as a security measure. An unmistakeable security measure is the burglar
 alarm mounted just above the entrance.

>examine alarm
 It's a square, red box with "Metro Alarms" printed on it.

>hit alarm with mallet
 The burglar alarm is too high up.

 The sound of a clock striking three mingles with the roar of a jet
 aircraft flying overhead.

>hit glass with mallet
 You smash through the glass with the mallet, and then keep smashing
 until you've made a hole large enough to step through. Meanwhile the
 alarm starts to ring.

>go northeast
 Very carefully, so as not to cut yourself or tear your clothes, you
 step through the large jagged hole in the window and find yourself just
 inside the Supermarket.

 Supermarket
 There's no one here, and most of the aisles are in shadow; the only
 light is in the checkout area by the exit to the southwest.

 It was here that you last saw her, about ten days ago, when she came up
 behind you in the checkout queue. She seemed pleased to see you, and
 appeared to have made a deliberate choice to join your queue, but the
 conversation remained inconsequential until you were ready to leave.
 Just as you'd packed up your shopping and paid your bill, she became
 suddenly solemn.

 "If I ever needed you - I mean really needed you - you would be there
 for me, wouldn't you?" she asked.

 "Of course," you replied, without hesitation.

 "Good," she smiled, and then changed the subject to something
 inconsequential like the weather.

>turn on torch
 You switch the torch on.

 The aisles are mostly in shadow, but you've no reason to suppose that
 anyone's lurking there.

 closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit,
 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.

 The burglar alarm is ringing.

>go north

 High Street (by Post Office)
 This part of the High Street contains some of the oldest buildings in
 the city, and the old shop fronts have been mercifully preserved from
 the depredations of three generations of philistine post-war planners.
 The main post office on the west side of the street is a particularly
 fine example of Victorian architecture, but all the shops retain a
 measure of charm here, even when they're only selling mortgages or
 computer games. The High Street continues to north and south, while a
 narrow lane runs off to the west just by the post office.

 Junction of High Street and College Street
 The High Street (from the south) comes to an end at a fork where
 College Street runs off to the northeast and Hythe Bridge Street to the

>go northeast

 College Street (south)
 You're not old enough to remember, but this area was apparently
 farmland back in the sixties. In the seventies it was decreed that the
 city was to receive a new university, and so College Street was
 created. The main university campus lies further up the street to the
 northeast, but in order to create something of an academic atmosphere
 at its gateway, so to speak, a new Public Library was erected, which
 now stands to the south, along with a new theatre, the Apollo, which is
 just off to the northwest. To the southwest College Street runs back
 towards the High Street.

>go south
 You hurry through the entrance lobby once more and go straight to the
 main reading room.

 Public Library
 From the central hub aisles of books run off in every direction except
 north, which is the way out. The library desk is, of course, unstaffed,
 but there's a computer terminal on it which appears to be working.

 Hythe Bridge Street (south)
 Hythe Bridge Street is quite narrow, being one of the oldest parts of
 the city. It narrows even further as it approaches an old stone bridge

>go northwest

 Hythe Bridge Street (north)
 Hythe Bridge street runs over an old stone bridge to the southeast and

 which stands just to the north.

>go northwest

>go south

 York Street (north)
 York Street continues to north and south. On the west side of the
 street stands Lafayette's, an intimate little restaurant you used to
 frequent when you went out more.

>go west
 (first opening the restaurant door)
 It turns out to be unlocked, so you have no trouble letting yourself in
 and strolling inside.

 Lafayette's (in the dark)
 It's too dark to see much in here, apart from the exit to the east.
 There's probably a light switch near the door.

 You once brought Kate here for a meal a few weeks after her
 twenty-first birthday. You weren't sure you wanted a relationship with
 Kate, but you weren't sure you didn't want one either. She was
 frighteningly clever, but she was also kind, warm-hearted and
 extraordinarily perceptive. Above all, she was someone you could really
 talk to, more than anyone else you knew at the time.

 You can't remember much of what you talked about that evening, but you
 vividly recall one snippet of the conversation.

 "Do you wish it was her with you here tonight?" she asked quietly.

 It was obvious to both of you whom she meant, so you didn't bother to
 query it. Instead you replied, "She's an interesting enough woman, I
 suppose, but I'm very happy with the company I've got."

 "So am I," Kate smiled wistfully, "But I can see you fancy her all the
 same. You shouldn't go so much on externals."

>turn on light
 You fumble around by the door and manage to find the light switch,
 which you turn on.

 Lafayette's
 The rather small tables and slightly gaudy red mock-leather chairs
 hardly make this the grandest restaurant in town, but in your opinion
 it offers the best value for money, as well as a relaxed friendly
 atmosphere. It's rather sad to see it so deserted tonight.

 On the serving counter are a steak knife and an old radio.

>take knife
 (the steak knife)
 You pick up the steak knife and examine it.

 It looks pretty sharp.

>examine radio
 It certainly looks like an old model, unless it's just a particularly
 convincing retro imitation. It has a large dial, and the cable running
 from it suggests that it's meant to run off mains power.

 The old radio is currently switched off.

>turn on radio
 Nothing happens; perhaps the radio is broken, or perhaps there's no
 power.

>plug in radio
 You plug the cord into the socket.
 The radio comes to life, with the broadcast of an overture by Elgar.

>listen
 From the radio comes the sound of a symphony by Beethoven.

>examine dial
 It's a large circular dial that can be turned to tune the radio.

>read dial
 It's a large circular dial that can be turned to tune the radio.

>tune radio
 Try turning the dial.

>turn dial
 You turn the dial, tuning into some kind of game show. One of the
 contestants has just been challenged to sing an impromptu song about
 Icelandic cod fishing to the tune of Land of Hope and Glory.

>again
 You turn the dial, tuning into a piece of rock.

>again
 You turn the dial, tuning into the news. Apparently, England has lost
 yet another test match.

>again
 You turn the dial, tuning into the evening play. It appears to be a
 dramatization of War and Peace, but you can't quite place the actor
 playing General Kutuzov, even though his voice sounds vaguely familiar.

>listen to radio
 From the radio comes the sound of the evening play. It appears to be a
 dramatization of War and Peace, but you can't quite place the actor

 You turn the dial, tuning into some long Russian opera.

 A clock chimes half past the hour. It can't be much more than an hour
 to dawn; surely the Enemy will have arrived by then. Time really is
 running out.

>open recorder with knife
 Which do you mean, the steak knife or the sharp kitchen knife?

>steak
 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

>go east
 You leave the restaurant and walk back out into York Street.

 York Street continues to north and south. On the west side of the
 street stands Lafayette's, an intimate little restaurant you used to
 frequent when you went out more.

 Darkness
 This seems to be a large space, but you can see virtually nothing here
 apart from the faint outline of the window up to the west and of the
 desk just beneath it.

>turn on torch
 You switch the torch on.

 Haulage Depot
 Presumably this cavernous space would normally be full of lorries, but
 there's not a single one in sight now; they must all have been pressed
 into service to assist with the evacuation. About the only thing that
 remains here now is the battered old desk in the corner, just under the
 window. The way out is through a large steel door to the north.

 On the battered old desk is a grey telephone.

 A metal toolbox rests in another corner of the depot.

>examine toolbox
 The green metal toolbox looks quite big and heavy.

 In the green metal toolbox are some tools.

>search tools
 There's a hammer, some screwdrivers, and a selection of spanners.

>take screwdriver
 You pick up the small screwdriver and examine it.

 It's a small screwdriver with a narrow blade and a yellow plastic
 handle.

>pry recorder with screwdriver
 You pry the tiny cassette-recorder open with the small screwdriver,
 revealing a black cassette within. You then throw away the now useless
 pieces of the broken cassette recorder.

>inventory
 You are carrying a small screwdriver, a steak knife, a heavy mallet, a
 chocolate box (open but empty), a prominent notice, a metal detector, a
 portable cassette player (closed), inside which is a blue cassette, a
 khaki peaked cap, a long rod, a torch (providing light), a gold brooch,
 a sharp kitchen knife, a bar mat, a matchbook, a small brown envelope
 (open but empty), two cassettes (a black cassette and a grey tape
 cassette), seventeen documents (a civil defence manual, a large blue
 diary, a small scrap of yellow paper, an evacuation order, a large
 Russian dictionary, a black book, a photograph, a letter, a small piece
 of paper, a concert programme, a menu, a birthday card, a crumpled
 piece of paper, a business card, a printed email, some miscellaneous
 papers and an old newspaper) and five keys (a large iron key, a small
 flat metal key, a large car key, a small brass key and an office key).

>examine cassette player
 It's a small, basic tape cassette player, black and silver in colour,
 with buttons marked PLAY, STOP, REWIND and EJECT.

>open cassette player
 You press the EJECT button and the cassette player pops open.

>put black cassette tape in cassette player
 (first taking the blue cassette)
 You put the black cassette into the portable cassette player.

>close cassette player
 You close the portable cassette player.

>press play
 Nothing happens, beyond the faintest of whirring sounds.

>press rewind
 There's a brief whirring while the tape rewinds, and then a click when
 it comes to a stop.

>press play
 The recording is tinny and a bit muffled. There are two voices, one
 male, one female.

 "Hello" says the male voice, "You came. But why here?"

 "This is where it all started to go wrong, all those years ago, so it
 seemed fitting -- but you wouldn't understand. You betrayed me," says
 the woman, "why?"

 "Just doing my public duty," says the man.

 "You mean I woudn't pay your price for silence," the other replies.

 "It was hardly an unreasonable price, all things considered," says the
 man.

 "I didn't need to pay it. I already had an insurance policy," says the
 woman.

 "I can't imagine what," the man replies, with a slight chuckle.

 "I knew I couldn't trust you, so I lied," the woman answers,
 "Fortunately you've passed my disinformation on to the authorities.
 They're looking for it in the wrong place."

 "Why tell me that now?" he asks.

 "I wanted to you to know how badly you'd failed," the woman replies,
 "before you die."

 "Oh no, I'm out of here." says the man.

 "On no you're not." The recording is too poor to be able to identify
 either voice with certainty. You don't want the female voice to be
 hers, and you fervently hope that it isn't. It may not be; but you're
 forced to admit that it could be.

 The conversation breaks off. There's a series of bangs and crashes,
 which could be the sounds of a scuffle, then silence. The tape comes to
 an end and the cassette player stops with a click.

>remember university hall
 In the University Hall you remembered:
 You attended three or four quite unmemorable lectures here when you
 were a student, but you mainly remember this hall for the two
 University rites of passage: matriculation and graduation. You can't
 even recall seeing her at the former, but she was definitely at the
 latter, and quite out of sorts that day -- you could scarcely get a
 cold nod out of her, let alone a word.

>think
 You're beginning to run out of ideas. You're fairly sure she's been
 moving round the city even while you've been trying to find her, almost
 as if she's deliberately been trying to avoid you. But it does occur to
 you that you haven't yet tried Carlton Terrace.

>examine diploma
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine crumpled piece of paper
 It's her degree certificate, showing that she graduated with an

 it out, the certificate remains a bit scrumpled.

>examine photograph
 It shows the climax of the graduation ceremony, with Kate shaking hands
 with the Vice-Chancellor as she receives the award for the best degree
 result of the year. A little way over to the left a group of graduands
 in academic robes stand looking on and applauding; among them are
 Jeremy, Nick, yourself - and her. It's her you look at, every bit as
 beautiful at twenty-one as she is today. She's applauding and smiling
 with the rest, but the smile looks a little forced.

 place) or when I went to the knowledge factory. We must make sure they
 don't get it. It would be a big help if you could search those two
 places while I look elsewhere. See you later."

 Just below that you see a crease that you missed before - you must have
 been in too much of a hurry, or maybe the light was too bad. Anyway,
 you unfold the crease and see that she has written:

 "I'll meet you where we first met at twenty to four. Don't be late!"

 I beg your pardon?

 Mandlebury Road (West)
 At this point Mandlebury Road is a broad, well-lit street, bordering
 the shadowy entrance to Mandlebury Park just to the north, and a
 traditional fish and chip shop to the south. The street continues east
 towards the city centre and west over Mandlebury Bridge.

>go west

 Mandlebury Bridge
 It's strange - almost unnatural - to see this bridge so deserted.
 You're more used to seeing it jammed with slow-moving rush-hour
 traffic, or at least a steady flow. But now there's nothing here apart
 from the bare tarmac, the street lights (one of which now has a large
 placard attached to it), the stone parapet, and the river sliding
 silently past below.

>go west

 Embankment
 The Embankment is the name given to this short stretch of road by
 Mandlebury Bridge, which spans the river to the east. To the west the
 Embankment is lined by a row of shops; to the north it becomes York
 Street, while to the south it runs into Sussex Street.

>go south

 Sussex Street (north)
 A row of large Edwardian town houses lines the west side of the street,
 overlooking the river to the east. The houses are all in darkness, and
 the street deserted, making it all seem not quite real. Sussex Street
 continues north to the Embankment and south towards the junction with
 Gladstone Terrace.

>go south

 Junction of Sussex Street and Gladstone Terrace.
 This junction would be well-lit even without the moonlight. Sussex
 Street continues to north and south while Gladstone Terrace leads off

 river, but just here the river bends towards the southeast and parts
 company with the road.

>go south

 Sussex Street (south)
 Although so far as you know this part of the city never suffered any
 bomb damage, some group of town planners rapidly made up for the
 negligence of the Luftwaffe by tearing down whatever was here before
 and replacing it with a mass of soulless fifties architecture seemingly
 inspired by Soviet brutalism. The most striking eyesore is the City
 Hospital, which lies immediately to the east. Sussex Street continues
 to north and south.

>go east

 Hospital Reception
 Hospitals can be depressing places at the best of times, and
 considerable effort has been put into ensuring that this one is no
 exception. The flickering light from a couple of fluorescent tubes does
 nothing to help, but the drab seating in the waiting area is the
 clincher. Opposite this seating stands the reception desk, currently
 unstaffed. Corridors lead off in all directions to operating theatres,
 offices, and wards, but the only one that looks at all tempting is the
 one that leads back out to the west.

 On the reception desk is a brown telephone.

>time
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine desk
 The reception desk is a long, flat surface behind which there would
 normally be situated a receptionist busily engaged in keeping visitors
 from patients, patients from doctors, and useful information from
 absolutely everyone (with the possible exception of the police and
 security services). Right now, however, it is as deserted as everywhere
 else.

 In the Playground you remembered:
 This was a co-ed school, and this playground was where you first saw
 her, all those years ago. Perhaps your recollection of that first
 encounter has been coloured by events of the last two decades, but as
 you recall it, when your eyes met across the playground it was as if
 everything else around receded into two-dimensional monochrome, and she
 was the only three-dimensional technicolour object left in your field
 of view. Again, as you recall, she smiled shyly at you, and you went
 and introduced yourself in your earnest six-year-old fashion, but so
 much fantasy and wishful thinking has surrounded the frequent rehearsal
 of that memory that you can't really remember what either of you
 actually said.

 School Lane is a relatively short street running north up to the

 residential, but the primary school you attended is on this street; its
 playground is just to the east.

 You hear a footfall slowly approaching down the street, and turn to see
 a figure walking towards you. As the figure passes under a street
 light, you see it's a slender young woman with long dark hair. You feel
 sure it must be her even before you can see her properly. You start
 walking towards her, eager yet apprehensive at finally meeting her. She
 walks on a few paces, then stops in a dark place between lamp posts,
 waiting for you to reach her.

 It is her; of course it is her. Even from a few yards away in the
 moonlight you're quite sure, and once you stop a couple of feet away no
 possible doubt remains: it's Emma.

 "Good - you made it!" she declares, "I don't suppose you managed to
 find the key, did you?"

>SAVE
>cf18
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>say yes
 "Yes, miraculously enough, I did!" you reply triumphantly, handing her
 the key.

 "Thank heavens for that!" she replies, taking the key. She holds it up
 in the bright moonlight, then nods, "Yes, this looks like the one," she
 tells you. With a rapid motion she inserts the key into the small metal
 box she's holding and gives it a quick twist, "Oh yes," she declares,
 "That's definitely the one. Thank you!" Smiling her most alluring smile
 she adds, "Tell me David, do you trust me?"

>say no
 "To be honest, I'm not sure I do," you reply.

 Amazingly, she doesn't seem in the least offended. "Really?" she asks,
 "You're learning at last! But you should trust me now, David, you
 really should. I'm your only hope of defeating the Enemy. Here ... "
 she holds out the small grey box to you, "Just push the button on that.
 Show that you trust me now. Will you do that?"

>ask why
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask emma why
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine emma
 She is tall, slender, and to your eyes, utterly beautiful, but the
 moonlight makes her look a little ghostlike, exaggerating both the
 palor of her skin and the darkness of her hair. She's carrying a small
 flat metal key and a small grey box.

 "What are you waiting for?" she demands, "Are you going to press that
 button for me or aren't you?"

>close grey box
 That's not something you can close.

>say no
 "No, I won't do it," you reply.

 "No matter," she shrugs, "It's a missed opportunity, but I can just as
 easily do it myself."

 She pushes the button, but nothing obvious happens.

 Well, something obvious happens. She laughs out loud and punches the
 air in triumph, shouting, "Yes!" Beaming at you fondly she continues,
 "Dear David, I always knew you were my truest friend, the one person I
 could always rely on.  That's why I had to share this with you. Would
 you like to kiss me? Yes, I can see in your eyes you would. Go on -
 kiss me - I know you've always been dying to, and now you're about to
 die with me!"

 She smiles at your mild bemusement, then goes on, "I'm afraid someone
 tipped them all off -- I suppose it must have been Danny, he was the
 only one who knew enough -- so they all got away, and I really wanted
 to take them all with me. Still, David, you stayed behind for me, and
 that's good because you're the only one who never rejected me, so you
 mustn't reject me now -- me or my nightfall."

 "Emma, what are you talking about?" you ask sadly.

 "We're about to reach Nightfall: final, ultimate, wonderful nightfall!
 This whole city is about to become a pile of radioactive ash!" she
 declares brightly, as if this were the best possible thing imaginable,
 "I have just detonated my bomb! At last I've achieved something that no
 one can ignore! This place never did value me properly, I've suffered
 far too many rejections! You do understand, don't you? I tried - I
 really tried - I always did my best, but other people kept stealing the
 prizes. That's why I had to kill Kate, of course - and why I have to
 destroy this city! Don't look so upset, David -- death is the most
 loving gift I have to give, and you of all people deserve my best! Just
 think what I'm sharing with you! I know you've always fancied me, and
 now I know I love you madly, so go on, take me: hug me, kiss me, make
 mad passionate love to me; I'm yours till death us do part!"

>ask emma about kate
 "What really happened to Kate?" you ask.

 "Kate?" she replies, a little too shortly, "Oh - Kate. She stole too
 many things that should have been mine, so - she drowned. She had to.
 Now, how about answering my question:  Will you kiss me while you can?"

 "Death, destruction, decay, these three things abide," she says, "but
 the greatest of these... Hang on. It's late!" She frowns momentarily,
 then relaxes into a smile, "I should not be so impatient - any moment
 now! Just give me one last kiss while you still can!"

>kiss emma
 You kiss her on the lips and find yourself taken slightly aback at the
 enthusiasm of her response.

 "Something has definitely gone wrong," Emma frowns, "We should both be
 dead by now, and this city should be a radioactive crater. David, have
 you done something?"

>again
 You'd quite like to, but you're not sure she'd welcome it.

>say yes
 "Yes, I know exactly what's going on," you sigh, "You're sick, Emma,
 and I had to stop you, or else chooses to ignore your affirmation. So I
 did what I had to.  I suppose you could say I've saved this city from
 your insanity. But you -"

 "You fool!" she cries, staring at you in disbelief, but then corrects
 herself, "No, a fool could not have worked out a way of stopping my
 bomb. It's just such a shock that you of all people..." She looks away
 for a moment, absently clenching her fists as her eyes stare into some
 distant abyss. "I failed, that's all; I failed," she announces
 suddenly, "Rejected on all sides - well, I can still reject back, yes I
 can!"

 Her last words becomes an angry, yet strangely triumphant, shout;
 before you can reply she turns and stalks away, breaking into a run as
 you try to follow her. She's fitter than you, so as hard as you try,
 you can't catch her up.

 But you do arrive just in time to see her throw herself into the river.
 You dive in after her, of course, but it's hopeless; the water is too
 cold and the night is too dark; eventually you have to abandon any
 attempt to rescue her.

 It's not until more than a week later, once the City has started to get
 back to normal, that her body is recovered. By some supreme irony, her
 final resting place is only a few yards from Kate's.

 things to try, UNDO the last turn or QUIT?
>additional








    Other things to try





 Over the course of the game you should have visited a number of places
 that have triggered memories. Viewing these in sequence should help you
 form some idea of the back-story.

 Playground: This was a co-ed school, and this playground was where you
 first saw her, all those years ago. Perhaps your recollection of that
 first encounter has been coloured by events of the last two decades,
 but as you recall it, when your eyes met across the playground it was
 as if everything else around receded into two-dimensional monochrome,
 and she was the only three-dimensional technicolour object left in your
 field of view. Again, as you recall, she smiled shyly at you, and you
 went and introduced yourself in your earnest six-year-old fashion, but
 so much fantasy and wishful thinking has surrounded the frequent
 rehearsal of that memory that you can't really remember what either of
 you actually said.

 Church Street Bus Stop: There are many bus-stops in the city, but only
 this one holds special memories for you. As a teenager you often used
 to wait here for your bus home from school. It was on her route home,
 too, and though she took a different bus from yours, you'd sometimes
 spot her on her bus when it stopped here. Once or twice she spotted you
 too, and then she'd always smile and wave, as if you were some
 long-lost friend. And even as a teenager she was so pretty!

 Residence Hall Lobby: You ran into her here in your first week as a
 student. You hesitated to approach her because, in all conscience, you
 hardly knew her, but while you were debating with yourself whether it
 was worth trying to renew your acquaintance, she flashed you a lovely
 smile and walked up to you.

 "Hello," she said, tossing her long dark hair over back her shoulder,
 "don't I know you? We were at primary school together, weren't we?"

 "That's right," you agreed, "though it seems a long time ago now. I'm
 flattered you remember!"

 "It's nice to see a familiar face!" she told you, "so what are you
 reading here?"

 "Law," you told her,  "and you?"

 "English," she replied, adding with a laugh "much less practical!
 Talking of which, I'm in danger late of being late for my first Dickens
 lecture, and I'd hate to upset my prof on my first day, so I'd better
 dash before Great Expectations turn into Bleak House! We'll catch up
 later."

 And after a fashion, over the next three years you did, but nowhere
 near as much as you'd have liked.

 Club Terrace: When you were a student, perhaps in your second year, you
 attended a particularly dire party in the club. All that smoke and beer
 and loud music wasn't really your scene, and the more everyone else
 around you seemed to be having "fun", the more fed up you felt, until
 eventually you wandered out here for some kind of relief from it all.

 You hadn't been out here that long when she came to join you,
 announcing her arrival by laying a friendly hand on your shoulder.
 "Hello," she said, "I hope you're not avoiding me!"

 "Certainly not!" you replied, "You're the last person I'd want to
 avoid!"

 "I'm glad to hear it," she smiled.

 "Shall we go somewhere else then?" you suggested hopefully, "How about
 a quiet drink at the KA?"

 For one moment you thought she was about to say yes, but instead she
 dashed your hope with an apologetic shake of the head. "Some other
 time," she replied, "I'd better go in; I'm with people." Then, with a
 parting pat on your arm, she turned away and went off to join the party
 in the club. It was several more years before you had that drink with
 her in the Kings Arms.

 Cinema Auditorium: You came here once with her to see a film when you
 were both students, it was one of the few occasions you actually went
 out with her. If you remember rightly the film was Titanic, but at the
 time you were much more interested in her than the film. Typically, she
 seemed so much more interested in the film than you that she didn't
 even notice where your interest lay.

 Elm Bridge: You vividly recall one occasion when you were driving this
 way. It was shortly after graduation and you were driving a group of
 friends back from a celebratory party. The traffic suddenly slowed to a
 crawl and you became aware of flashing blue lights a short way up
 ahead.

 "Quick; change places with me," she said.

 "But..." you began to protest.

 "Don't argue, there isn't much time." she insisted.

 There was something about her tone of voice that silenced any further
 argument, so you surreptitiously changed places before the traffic
 started moving again. A few dozen yards further on the police stopped
 the car and asked her to blow into a breathalyzer (there weren't meant
 to be random breath tests in those days, but they found some pretext).
 She, of course, was clean. To this day you don't know whether you would
 have been, but you're profoundly grateful that it wasn't put to the
 test.

 Hotel Lobby: This place holds two poignant memories for you. The first
 is of Kate's 21st birthday party; she needed somewhere large for all
 her friends. She was really dazzling that night, with her whole life
 before her. Alas, she never lived to see her 22nd birthday. The
 recollection of that evening brings home to you just how much you miss
 her still.

 The second is more recent, from about three years ago. You took her out
 to dinner here, a week or so after that drink in the Kings Arms. She,
 too, seemed really dazzling that night, sparkling with wit and
 conversation, utterly charming throughout the entire meal. Even though
 in hindsight some of the things she said may have been just a little
 odd, at the time you were just happy to enjoy her company -- until,
 right at the end, she dropped her little bombshell.

 "Thanks for a lovely evening, David," she told you, "but now there's
 something I really ought to tell you. I've just started seeing Jeremy."

 "Seeing Jeremy," you repeated dully, feeling the whole evening
 crumbling around you.

 "I mean I'm going out with him," she explained patronisingly, as if you
 hadn't understood perfectly well what she meant.

 Lafayette's: You once brought Kate here for a meal a few weeks after
 her twenty-first birthday. You weren't sure you wanted a relationship
 with Kate, but you weren't sure you didn't want one either. She was
 frighteningly clever, but she was also kind, warm-hearted and
 extraordinarily perceptive. Above all, she was someone you could really
 talk to, more than anyone else you knew at the time.

 You can't remember much of what you talked about that evening, but you
 vividly recall one snippet of the conversation.

 "Do you wish it was her with you here tonight?" she asked quietly.

 It was obvious to both of you whom she meant, so you didn't bother to
 query it. Instead you replied, "She's an interesting enough woman, I
 suppose, but I'm very happy with the company I've got."

 "So am I," Kate smiled wistfully, "But I can see you fancy her all the
 same. You shouldn't go so much on externals."

 Mandlebury Bridge: You have, just once before, seen the bridge that
 deserted - a night burned on your memory. You were walking home from a
 late party - if only you had left that party a few minutes earlier you
 might have arrived here just in time to prevent Kate's death.

 Embankment: This is where you found her that dreadful night, seven
 years ago. Her clothes were soaked of course, but it's the water
 streaming from her long dark hair that you remember most vividly now -
 that and the fact that she was kneeling by Kate's body.

 She looked up, obviously distressed, but then relieved to see a
 familiar face. "She fell - off the bridge" she gasped, swallowing hard
 as she wiped the damp hair out of her eyes, "I don't know how - just a
 few minutes ago - I tried to save her - but - well - I dived in and I
 managed to get her out - but she's not breathing!"

 For a moment you just stood there, overcome by shock as you stared at
 her, unwilling to take in what she had just said. Then she galvanised
 you into action: "For goodness' sake! Don't just stand there! Fetch
 help! Go and call an ambulance!"

 And so off you ran, south towards the city hospital.

 Hospital Reception: You'll never forget waiting here, with her beside
 you, still wet from her misadventure and shaking from cold and shock.
 She made no objection when you put your arm round her, and even nestled
 her head on your shoulder, but there was nothing amorous about it, you
 were worried sick about Kate and just looking for comfort. It didn't
 last all that long anyway, for it was only a few minutes until the
 doctor came out to confirm that Kate was dead.

 So then you spent the next few hours talking to the police.

 Police Station Reception Area: The last time you were here was when the
 police called you in to go over your statement about Kate's drowning,
 just a couple of days before the Inquest at the Coroner's Court just
 round the corner. They seemed particularly interested in what you could
 tell them about Kate's state of mind, but you couldn't really add much
 to the statement you'd given them in the Hospital just after the event.

 Cornwallis Avenue Nth: You remember you had to attend the Coroner's
 Court after Kate drowned. It was a miserable business; the police
 doctor had confirmed that Kate's death was by drowning, but as you'd
 arrived on the scene so soon after she had fished Kate out of the river
 that you were an important witness. Although she (your friend, that is)
 said she'd seen Kate jump off the bridge, there was no suicide note and
 no evidence that Kate was feeling suicidal, so in the end the coroner's
 jury reached a verdict of death by misadventure. With the wisdom of
 hindsight you wish they'd been a bit more thorough and a lot more
 suspicious.

 Churchyard: Kate's grave is somewhere here among the others; you used
 to visit it often. You'll never forget the shock you received when you
 came one day only a few weeks after Kate's funeral to find the grave
 desecrated. At least, someone had knocked over the headstone and
 smashed it, and the flowers were all torn up and strewn around. The
 police never did catch the culprits, and put it down to local
 hooligans, but that never seemed quite satisfactory somehow; why should
 it be Kate's grave that was attacked in this way?

 It's long since been put right, of course, but the memory of the broken
 gravestone still leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Kate deserved
 better than that - much better.

 Nave: You remember when you came here for Kate's funeral, just over six
 years ago. She was sitting up in one of the front pews, quite unaware
 of your presence, although your eyes kept wandering to the back of her
 head. At some appropriate point in the service she went up to the
 lectern and made some thoroughly fitting speech about the tragically
 early death of her dear friend Kate, who had had a wonderful life ahead
 of her. You can't remember precisely what she said; what you remember
 is how solemn and composed she was as she spoke, saying just the right
 things in just the right sombre tone, without ever giving way to
 emotion and tears.

 High Street (Outside Hairdressers and Pub): You'll never forget the
 terrible shock you got when you happened to be passing this way not
 long after Kate's funeral (which had left you feeling pretty down in
 any case). She (not Kate - she) had stepped out of the Hairdressers,
 and for a moment you almost failed to recognize her, she'd had her hair
 cut so dreadfully short. You hated it at once; she'd had such a
 glorious mane of long dark hair, but this - well, it must have shown in
 your face, since she remarked, more than a little snippily. "I thought
 it was time for a change", and then stalked off up the street before
 you could reply.

 In the event she must have agreed with your judgement, though, since
 she never had her hair cut like that again; instead the way she let it
 grow longer year by year suggested she hardly had it cut again at all.

 photograph: It shows the climax of the graduation ceremony, with Kate
 shaking hands with the Vice-Chancellor as she receives the award for
 the best degree result of the year. A little way over to the left a
 group of graduands in academic robes stand looking on and applauding;
 among them are Jeremy, Nick, yourself - and her. It's her you look at,
 every bit as beautiful at twenty-one as she is today. She's applauding
 and smiling with the rest, but the smile looks a little forced.

 certificates: The certificates show a range of her achievements, but
 her degree certificate is conspicuous by its absence.

 University Hall: You attended three or four quite unmemorable lectures
 here when you were a student, but you mainly remember this hall for the
 two University rites of passage: matriculation and graduation. You
 can't even recall seeing her at the former, but she was definitely at
 the latter, and quite out of sorts that day -- you could scarcely get a
 cold nod out of her, let alone a word.

 Sports Ground: You don't come here much, sport really isn't your thing.
 But you did come a few times that summer, to watch the tennis
 tournament. She was in it. She reached the finals. You're no expert on
 tennis, but she seemed to be totally in control all the time; it was
 almost as if she were dancing round the court rather than exerting
 herself.

 She, won, of course: at least she won the women's singles, although she
 didn't do quite so well in the mixed doubles. When you spoke to her
 afterwards she seemed to be almost more preoccupied with that failure
 than with her success: "That idiot Nick!" she complained, "He was like
 an uncoordinated lobster on court! We should have won!"

 Concert Hall: You've attended many concerts here over the years, many
 of them good, but the one you remember best is the amateur performance
 of The Marriage of Figaro in which she sang the part of Cherubino. You
 thought she sang like an angel, and in your mind's ear you can still
 hear her beautiful rendition of the aria "Voi che sapete" - "You who
 know what love is". You came back to hear her again several nights in
 succession; it's fortunate that you're so fond of Mozart.

 Theatre Auditorium: Not all the events held here were as representative
 of high culture as the builders of this theatre might have hoped. Three
 or four years ago the city held a contest here to choose a beauty queen
 for some local pageant. Of course she was one of the contestants, and
 of course she won; most of the other contestants were pretty enough but
 next to her beauty they struck you as fireflies competing with the sun.
 It wasn't just a matter of her looks, though she certainly looked
 drop-dead gorgeous that night; at the time you imagined that she had
 far more poise, far more intelligence, and far more personality than
 the rest of them put together.

 Lounge Bar: You met her here about three years ago. You'd been giving
 her some routine legal advice on the phone, and you'd managed to drop
 the suggestion of a drink into the conversation. A little to your
 surprise she'd agreed, and that evening, you only had to wait for about
 five minutes before she walked in, spotted you from across the bar and
 came and joined you at your table.

 "Tell me," she said, once you'd bought her a drink and you'd both
 settled down for a chat, "What would you like to be remembered for?"

 "I'm not sure I'd ever given it much thought," you replied, "I suppose
 I'd be pretty content to be remembered as a decent sort of bloke."

 "Oh, I'm sure you'll be remembered for that, David!" she laughed, "But
 I've been thinking; how sad it must be to pass through life and never
 leave any kind of impression."

 "You seem to have made quite an impression round here already," you
 remarked.

 "Maybe -- but is it enough?" she wondered, "There are times when I feel
 that whatever I do, it's never quite enough!"

 "It sounds like you're demanding too much of yourself," you suggested.

 For a moment she stared at you, as if pondering how best to respond to
 this idea. Then she suddenly brightened, briskly changing the subject,
 "Sorry, I'm sure you don't want to hear about my existential angst all
 evening --  so, tell me about your day."

 So you did, and from there the conversation wandered on to other
 topics, till she quite suddenly announced that she had to leave.

 Mandlebury Park: When time permits you often come here to eat your
 lunch on the park bench. On one such occasion about four years ago you
 saw her jogging past on a circuit of the park. The second time round,
 she stopped to catch her breath and chat. You can't remember a great
 deal of the conversation , but you do remember she was enthusing about
 some book she'd just read.

 "Have you read any Stanilev?" she asked.

 "I've never heard of him," you admitted.

 "He's a great thinker, you should read him, you really should," she
 urged you, "Until I read him I never realized anyone else could feel
 that way. It was so liberating!"

 But though you promised her you'd look out for a copy of Stanilev's
 book, somehow you never got round to it until now.

 Public Library: You remember coming here about four or five years ago
 to borrow a novel, and seeing her sitting off to one side,
 concentrating on some book. You exchanged smiles, but that was about as
 far as you got before a frown from a fierce librarian silenced your
 incipient greeting.

 black book: The book has a plain black cover, on which is inscribed
 "Nightfall, by A.D. Stanilev".

 Art Gallery: Although art isn't really your thing, you came here about
 a year ago to see an exhibition of paintings entered into a competition
 for local amateurs. Or rather you came to see one painting in
 particular: her painting, the painting that won the competition.

 Her painting: Her painting, the winning entry, is still prominently on
 display. It portrays the city at sunset, with the buildings silhouetted
 in front of a blazing red glow. The painting is certainly striking, but
 you find it a little disturbing; it almost makes it look as if the
 whole city is on fire. The painting is called "Nightfall". You check
 the signature at the bottom right-hand corner, but it looks like her
 name, not the mysterious MASTEMA of the poster in her flat - curiouser
 and curiouser.

 Her Office: You've been here once or twice before; she's occasionally
 used your firm for legal advice. She set up in business here shortly
 after graduating, specializing in student lets. The business seems to
 have been moderately successful - at least, it's still going and she's
 not obviously poverty-stricken - but it's never grown, since she still
 works by herself after seven years at it.

 letter: It's a handwritten letter from Jeremy, dated about two years
 ago, breaking off his relationship with her. You re-read it, your eye
 stopping on phrases like, "I'm sorry, but it's over. I still find you
 as charming and attractive as I always did, and you can be great
 company, but I'm worn out by your need to always be the best at
 everything, and I've had enough of playing second fiddle to your
 ambition" and "We've had good times together, but I realize now that
 you're just not the woman for me" and "Even now I don't really feel I
 know you. I'm sure you do have a heart, but I've never felt you've ever
 really opened it to me; for such a successful woman you seem strangely
 repressed." The letter must obviously have been returned to him, since
 across the bottom is written in another hand: "You should have thought
 twice before rejecting me!"

 printed email: It's a printed copy of an email, addressed to her from
 one edward.dawlish@freegov.org. The main body of the email reads:


 We have given your CV and letter the most serious consideration but
 regret to inform you that we felt unable to add your name to our
 short-list of candidates. As I'm sure you will appreciate this has long
 been a safe seat, and we thus have an unusually strong field of
 potential candidates, many of whom already have considerable
 parliamentary experience.


 Your participation and achievements in the life of this city have
 indeed been remarkable, and we recognize that. We accordingly feel you
 would make an *excellent* candidate for the city council, and very much
 hope you will consider offering yourself as a candidate for the
 forthcoming local elections (we could virtually guarantee to find you a
 winnable ward). Any experience gained as a local councillor would also
 stand you in very good stead should you wish to pursue parliamentary
 ambitions at some later date.

 The email is dated about two years ago. At the bottom of it is written
 in large red letters: "NO!".

 Junction of High Street and College Street: About two years ago you ran
 into her here as you were walking home, and she was doing the same,
 both of you rather later than normal. Your paths would normally have
 taken you in opposite directions, but instead of turning to walk down
 the High Street she took a detour up Hythe Bridge Street to walk along
 beside you.

 "Today has not been a good day," she explained, "I could do with seeing
 a friendly face!"

 So you walked on up Hythe Bridge Street together, but she seemed
 unwilling to say what was wrong.

 Junction of York Street and Hythe Bridge Street: About two years ago
 you had walked up from the other end of Hythe Bridge Street with her
 one evening, as she'd taken a slight detour from her normal route. You
 had stopped at this junction, since her way home lay south and yours
 lay north. It was just at this point on your walk that she came closest
 opening herself up to you.

 "Would you say I was a failure?" she asked.

 "Certainly not!" You declared, surprised by her question, "I've never
 known anyone succeed at so many things!"

 "But not everything," she sighed, "and maybe not at anything really
 important."

 On impulse you offered, "Shall I walk you home?"

 "Why not?" she replied.

 So you'd both headed south together, and you tried to get her to expand
 on what she had just said, but somehow the moment had been lost and she
 insisted on changing the subject.

 Gladstone Terrace: When you walked her home one night, about two years
 ago, this was as far as you got. You had hoped she would at least
 invite you in for a coffee. Indeed, for a moment you thought she seemed
 just on the point of doing so, but then all she said was, "Thank you -
 it was good to talk." Just before she turned away to let herself in,
 she added, "I'll see you around." Then she disappeared inside, leaving
 you standing in the street as if you could not possibly have expected
 anything else.

 Old Library Dance Floor: The last time you were here was a couple of
 years or so ago. You mainly recall music too loud for conversation and
 a floor too crowded to dance on without bumping into people at every
 turn; it really wasn't your scene at all. You only bought a ticket
 because you knew she'd be here. And so she was, effortlessly elegant in
 plain black, standing out from all the others in their colourful finery
 like a princess among apes. You kept stealing hopeful glances at her
 all evening. Surprisingly, for much of the time she seemed to be
 dancing with some nerdish-looking teenager (at the time you supposed
 either that she must have felt sorry for him and was just being nice,
 or else that he must be some cousin she'd been lumbered with for the
 evening). At last, when you'd given up all hope and had gone in search
 of a refill for your glass, she came up to you and asked you for a
 dance. You'd been secretly hoping for a slow romantic sway, of course,
 but your luck being what it was all you got was an energetic jive. At
 least, she was commendably energetic about it (but graceful with it, of
 course), which left you feeling a bit like a lumbering elephant with
 four left feet in comparison. But at the time you felt that one dance
 made the whole evening worthwhile.

 Morgans Bank: You ran into her here about eighteen months ago; she was
 just ahead of you in the queue.

 "Oh, hello!" she said, with one of her brighter smiles, "Are you here
 to take all your money out too? These people obviously can't be trusted
 with it!"

 "Why not?" you asked.

 "Didn't you hear about it on the news?" she replied, "Someone hacked
 into Morgans' mainframe and siphoned off a couple of million. Doesn't
 say much for their security, does it?"

 old newspaper: Most of it is missing, and the rest of it is at least
 several weeks old. Apart from the grease stains testifying to its use
 as a fish-and-chips wrapper, it is full of the usual bad news about
 undesirable things on the increase: inflation, unemployment, taxes,
 crime, global warming; according to one columnist, there's even a sharp
 rise in severe personality disorders among the under thirties. The sole
 surviving page of foreign news is no cheerier, since it bemoans
 increasing tension in the Middle East coupled with the danger of former
 Soviet republics selling nuclear weapons on the black market.

 large metal cylinder: The large metal cylinder is mostly silver in
 colour, and has various coloured wires attached to it. There's quite a
 bit of writing on it, but it's all in the Cyrillic alphabet. A quick
 glance at the civil defence manual does not prove reassuring -- the
 cylinder could well be a bomb.

 large poster: It's a monochrome photograph of a painting depicting
 sunset over the city. You recognize it as the winning entry in a recent
 art competition; the original hangs in the Art Gallery Market Street.
 The black and white photo is not nearly so striking as the oil-colour
 original, but perhaps the original would be too overpowering for a
 living room - at least you always find it a bit disturbing to look at.
 The photograph differs from the original in another odd way: the
 signature in the bottom right-hand corner should be her name, but
 instead it looks like MASTEMA.

 Supermarket: It was here that you last saw her, about ten days ago,
 when she came up behind you in the checkout queue. She seemed pleased
 to see you, and appeared to have made a deliberate choice to join your
 queue, but the conversation remained inconsequential until you were
 ready to leave. Just as you'd packed up your shopping and paid your
 bill, she became suddenly solemn.

 "If I ever needed you - I mean really needed you - you would be there
 for me, wouldn't you?" she asked.

 "Of course," you replied, without hesitation.

 "Good," she smiled, and then changed the subject to something
 inconsequential like the weather.

 familiar birthday card: You recognize it at once. It is the card you
 sent her for her birthday a few weeks ago, a safe, arty kind of card
 that showed you were thinking of her without suggesting anything soppy.
 You wonder why she kept it.

 Ticket Office: While you were queuing for your ticket, Jeremy turned to
 you and said, "She's still in the city, you know. She's not leaving;
 apparently there's something frantically important she has to do here."

 "More important than getting away from the Enemy?" you asked.

 "So she says," he replied, with a dismissive shrug, "Oh, and by the
 way, I nearly forgot. She asked me to give you this." He handed you a
 small brown envelope.

 You didn't need to ask who he meant. There were thousands of women in
 the city, but only one she - in Jeremy's case because of their
 relationship; in yours - well, it was then that your notion about
 staying behind for her finally started to harden into resolve.

 gold brooch: It's a gold brooch, in the form of a scorpion. The design
 is quite distinctive, and you're sure she has a brooch like that.
 You've often wondered what kind of statement it's meant to make: not
 that she's poisonous, to be sure, but you suspect she'd not be averse
 to suggesting she's not to be messed with.

    Review your memories

 Various places in the city trigger important memories. You didn't visit
 them all this time. Next time try visiting Carlton Terrace as well.
 You might want to take a closer look at the small grey box and the
 television. There are also several important objects you haven't found

>look
 Morgans Bank
 The bank is deserted now, but it looks like someone was here not too
 long ago: the service counter is surrounded by broken glass. That
 presumably explains why the bank is unlocked and the lights left on;
 whoever has just robbed the bank didn't hang around to lock up and turn
 out the lights. The street exit is to the northeast.

>out

 City Centre
 The junction where the High Street crosses Mandlebury Road is generally
 reckoned to be the central point of the city. From here the High Street
 runs north up past your office and south towards Preston Bridge and the
 ring road, while Mandlebury Road runs east towards the police station
 and west towards the river. Most of the buildings on the junction are
 closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit,
 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.

>go west

 Mandlebury Road (West)
 At this point Mandlebury Road is a broad, well-lit street, bordering
 the shadowy entrance to Mandlebury Park just to the north, and a
 traditional fish and chip shop to the south. The street continues east
 towards the city centre and west over Mandlebury Bridge.

 The sound of a clock striking three mingles with the roar of a jet
 aircraft flying overhead.

>go west

 Mandlebury Bridge
 It's strange - almost unnatural - to see this bridge so deserted.
 You're more used to seeing it jammed with slow-moving rush-hour
 traffic, or at least a steady flow. But now there's nothing here apart
 from the bare tarmac, the street lights (one of which now has a large
 placard attached to it), the stone parapet, and the river sliding
 silently past below.

>go west

 Embankment
 The Embankment is the name given to this short stretch of road by
 Mandlebury Bridge, which spans the river to the east. To the west the
 Embankment is lined by a row of shops; to the north it becomes York
 Street, while to the south it runs into Sussex Street.

>go south

 Sussex Street (north)
 A row of large Edwardian town houses lines the west side of the street,
 overlooking the river to the east. The houses are all in darkness, and
 the street deserted, making it all seem not quite real. Sussex Street
 continues north to the Embankment and south towards the junction with
 Gladstone Terrace.

>go south

 Junction of Sussex Street and Gladstone Terrace.
 This junction would be well-lit even without the moonlight. Sussex
 Street continues to north and south while Gladstone Terrace leads off
 to the west. Further north the street runs along the west bank of the
 river, but just here the river bends towards the southeast and parts
 company with the road.

>go south

 Sussex Street (south)
 Although so far as you know this part of the city never suffered any
 bomb damage, some group of town planners rapidly made up for the
 negligence of the Luftwaffe by tearing down whatever was here before
 and replacing it with a mass of soulless fifties architecture seemingly
 inspired by Soviet brutalism. The most striking eyesore is the City
 Hospital, which lies immediately to the east. Sussex Street continues
 to north and south.

>go south

 Junction of Sussex Street and Carlton Terrace
 Sussex Street runs on to north and south, while Carlton Terrace leads
 off to the west.

>go west
 Carlton Terrace
 Carlton Terrace runs east into Sussex Street and continues westwards
 under a railway bridge.

 You once considered renting your first flat in this street, but
 eventually decided against it. The flat would have been relatively
 cheap, but it there were good reasons for that, among them being (a)
 that Carlton Terrace is not in a nice area and (b) that the trains
 rattling over the bridge would probably have kept you awake all night.
 In the end you settled for a flat out in the northern suburbs.

>examine bridge
 The bridge is but a vague outline in the moonlight, but the dark tunnel
 running under it looks profoundly uninviting.

>go west
 That way leads to Fordbury, a run-down quarter with a high crime rate.
 It has presumably been evacuated along with the rest of the city, so
 the risk of getting mugged is no doubt lower than usual, but it's most
 unlikely she went that way, and you feel sure you'd do better to
 concentrate your search nearer the city centre.

>go east

 Junction of Sussex Street and Carlton Terrace
 Sussex Street runs on to north and south, while Carlton Terrace leads
 off to the west.

>go south

 Blackbird Roundabout
 This is yet another of the large roundabouts on the ring road, all of
 which look more or less alike, especially by moonlight. This one has
 four exits: north into the city, south to the industrial estate, and
 east and west to the ring road.

>go west
 You're hardly likely to find her by walking on round the ring road.

>go south
 That way leads to the main industrial estate. You very much doubt she'd
 have gone there.

>go east

 Ring Road West
 Normally there'd be a lot of cars racing or queuing along this expanse
 of tarmac, depending on the time of day. Right now, however, there is
 not a single one in sight; just about every vehicle in the city has
 been used for the evacuation, and no one in their right mind would come
 here with the Enemy about to arrive. Walking along the tarmac by
 moonlight feels distinctly strange.

>go east

 Oak Tree Roundabout
 This large roundabout is normally busy and frequently congested; seeing
 it without a car in sight seems distinctly strange. There are four
 exits from the roundabout: to east and west is the ring road; to the
 north the road over Preston Bridge into the city centre, and to the
 south the dual carriageway heading out into the country.

>examine tree
 Oak Tree Roundabout
 This large roundabout is normally busy and frequently congested; seeing
 it without a car in sight seems distinctly strange. There are four
 exits from the roundabout: to east and west is the ring road; to the
 north the road over Preston Bridge into the city centre, and to the
 south the dual carriageway heading out into the country.

>go north

 Preston Bridge
 This bridge is normally something of a bottleneck at rush hour, but now
 it's just as deserted as everywhere else in the city. It's a bit too
 narrow for the volume of traffic it normally has to take, but its old
 stone parapets overlooking the river make it too historic to widen.

>go north

 Junction of High Street and Market Street
 The lighting is a bit better here, since it's a junction of two
 normally busy roads: the High Street continues to north and south,
 while Market Street heads off to the east.

>go north

 High Street (Outside Hairdressers and Pub)
 Amongst the various buildings lining the street here you particularly
 notice two: the glass-fronted Ladies' Hairdresser to the east and the
 mock-Tudor olde worlde pub - the Kings Arms - which stands directly
 opposite it to the west. The High Street continues to both north and
 south.

>go north

 High Street (South)
 The High Street runs north to the City Centre and continues to the
 south. A narrow alley runs off to the east, opposite a newsagent to the
 west.

>go north

 City Centre
 The junction where the High Street crosses Mandlebury Road is generally
 reckoned to be the central point of the city. From here the High Street
 runs north up past your office and south towards Preston Bridge and the
 ring road, while Mandlebury Road runs east towards the police station
 and west towards the river. Most of the buildings on the junction are
 closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit,
 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.

>go east

 Mandlebury Road (East)
 A large car park lies immediately to the south, while Church Street
 forks off to the northeast. Mandlebury Road continues to both east
 (past the Police Station) and west (back to the City Centre).

>go northeast

 Church Street
 Church Street runs up the hill to the northeast and down to the
 southwest past rows of prickly bushes, while directly to the north a
 lych-gate leads through to St Michael's church yard.

>go northeast

 Church Street Bus Stop
 The bus stop stands at the junction of Church Street, which runs
 northeast and southwest from here, and School Lane, which leads off to
 the south.

>go northeast

 Junction of Devon Road and Church Street
 This three-way road junction is well lit. Devon Road leads off to the
 north, Tilbury Road to the east, and Church Street to the southwest.
 Immediately to the south of the junction stands the High School you
 attended as a teenager.

>go east

 Tilbury Road
 Tilbury Road runs eastwards out of the city through the Tilbury Park
 Council Estate. It's obvious that it's leaving the city centre from the
 way the street lighting becomes less frequent. The junction with Church
 Street and Devon Road lies back to the west.

>examine estate
 It's too far out to be worth looking for her; it would take you weeks
 to search all the suburbs and housing estates and you haven't even got
 all night.

>restore
>cf18
 Enter saved game to load: Ok.

>examine her
 She is tall, slender, and to your eyes, utterly beautiful, but the
 moonlight makes her look a little ghostlike, exaggerating both the
 palor of her skin and the darkness of her hair. She's carrying a small
 grey box.

 "I asked you a question," she reminds you. "Have you found the key?"

>tell her no
 "No, I'm afraid not," you lie, "There really wasn't much hope of
 finding it in any of those places in the dark, was there?"

 "No, I suppose not," she sighs. "Damn! You may as well have this then,"
 she says, handing you the small grey box, "It's our only hope of
 defeating the Enemy, but it's no good without the key. So what are we
 going to do now? Do you have a plan for dealing with the Enemy?"

>ask her about enemy
 "What do you know about the Enemy? Who are they?" you ask.

 "I wonder if you'd understand if I told you," she replies, "but you
 haven't answered my question.  What are we to do now? Do you have a
 plan for dealing with the Enemy?"

>tell her no
 "No -- let's get out of here before the Enemy arrive," you suggest.

 "It's much too late for that," she tells you, "The Enemy has been here
 all along. Wait a minute though..." she feels in her pockets and then
 gives a triumphant smile, "Ah, thank goodness for that! I think I've
 found the spare!" She grabs your palm as if pressing something into it,
 but when you look you just see the one flat metal key there. Meanwhile
 she watches you with a twisted smile, as if challenging you to
 acknoweldge that she saw through your lie.

 "We can defeat the Enemy after all," she tells you, "all you need to do
 is to put the key in the hole, give it a turn, and push the red button.
 Will you do that for me, David?"

>tell her no
 "No, I won't do it," you reply.

 "No matter," she shrugs, "It's a missed opportunity, but I can just as
 easily do it myself."
 She takes the flat metal key, inserts it in the small grey box, and
 gives it a twist.
 She pushes the button, but nothing obvious happens.

 Well, something obvious happens. She laughs out loud and punches the
 air in triumph, shouting, "Yes!" Beaming at you fondly she continues,
 "Dear David, I always knew you were my truest friend, the one person I
 could always rely on.  That's why I had to share this with you. Would
 you like to kiss me? Yes, I can see in your eyes you would. Go on -
 kiss me - I know you've always been dying to, and now you're about to
 die with me!"

 She smiles at your mild bemusement, then goes on, "I'm afraid someone
 tipped them all off -- I suppose it must have been Danny, he was the
 only one who knew enough -- so they all got away, and I really wanted
 to take them all with me. Still, David, you stayed behind for me, and
 that's good because you're the only one who never rejected me, so you
 mustn't reject me now -- me or my nightfall."

 "Emma, what are you talking about?" you ask sadly.

 "We're about to reach Nightfall: final, ultimate, wonderful nightfall!
 This whole city is about to become a pile of radioactive ash!" she
 declares brightly, as if this were the best possible thing imaginable,
 "I have just detonated my bomb! At last I've achieved something that no
 one can ignore! This place never did value me properly, I've suffered
 far too many rejections! You do understand, don't you? I tried - I
 really tried - I always did my best, but other people kept stealing the
 prizes. That's why I had to kill Kate, of course - and why I have to
 destroy this city! Don't look so upset, David -- death is the most
 loving gift I have to give, and you of all people deserve my best! Just
 think what I'm sharing with you! I know you've always fancied me, and
 now I know I love you madly, so go on, take me: hug me, kiss me, make
 mad passionate love to me; I'm yours till death us do part!"

>ask her about nightfall
 "What's the connection between your painting and Stanilev's book?" you
 ask.

 "Beyond the name, you mean?" she replies, "I should have thought that
 was obvious: I was trying to express in paint what Stanilev said in
 words. Now, how about answering my question: Will you kiss me while you
 can?"

 "Death, destruction, decay, these three things abide," she says, "but
 the greatest of these... Hang on. It's late!" She frowns momentarily,
 then relaxes into a smile, "I should not be so impatient - any moment
 now! Just give me one last kiss while you still can!"

>tell her no
 She appears not to hear you, or else chooses to ignore your negation.
 "Something has definitely gone wrong," Emma frowns, "We should both be
 dead by now, and this city should be a radioactive crater. David, have
 you done something?"

>tell her no
 "I don't know what you're talking about, Emma," you lie, knowing the
 lie to be justified now, "All this stuff about bombs and nightfall -
 whatever do you mean?"

 She looks momentarily puzzled, "We should be dead," she replies.

 "I don't see why!" you reply, "It's so much better to be alive! And
 somehow I don't think the Enemy will be troubling us any more."

 "You don't?" she asks suspiciously.

 "We've defeated them, Emma," you tell her.

 "We have?" she asks.

 "I see no Enemy here, Emma," you tell her, "Do you?"

 In reply, she merely stares at you, finally at a loss for words, so you
 decide to press your advantage.

 "I don't know what's been going on here tonight, Emma," you say, "but I
 do know that life is worth living, especially now I find myself alone
 in this city with the most beautiful and talented woman I shall ever
 set eyes on. And you know what? The Enemy that's been stalking me all
 my life is the fear of rejection, and that Enemy has just been routed.
 So - I'm going to walk you home now and I'm not taking no for an
 answer."

 For a moment she continues to stare at you, then finally nods. "Very
 well," she agrees, "Let's try it your way."

 She makes no protest at all as you take her hand and start walking back
 to her flat. That way you can keep her under your control while you
 plan the final reckoning.

>examine wires
 A red wire, an orange wire, a yellow wire, a green wire, a blue wire, a
 purple wire and a black wire are all attached to various parts of the
 cylinder.

>examine small piece of paper
 The handwriting is as small as the piece of paper it's written on, but
 you still recognise it as hers. It reads, "Sorry, couldn't wait - just
 discovered I've lost something I must recover: a small, grey, flat
 metal key. I may have dropped it when I went for a run (in the usual
 place) or when I went to the knowledge factory. We must make sure they
 don't get it. It would be a big help if you could search those two
 places while I look elsewhere. See you later."

 Just below that you see a crease that you missed before - you must have
 been in too much of a hurry, or maybe the light was too bad. Anyway,
 you unfold the crease and see that she has written:

 "I'll meet you where we first met at twenty past two. Don't be late!"

>go east
 You can't go that way. The only obvious exit is outside (to Car Park).

>outside
 You turn off the torch to save its battery.

 Car Park
 It's normally near impossible to find a parking space in this town
 centre car park at any time between 8 am and midnight, but now there's
 scarcely a vehicle in sight. The main car park exit into Mandlebury
 Street is to the north, but there's also a narrow alley leading west to
 the High Street.

 The only vehicle parked here is a large lorry.

>go east
 You can't go that way. The obvious exits are north (to Mandlebury Road
 (East)), west (to High Street (South)) and inside (to Lorry Interior).

>go north

 Mandlebury Road (East)
 A large car park lies immediately to the south, while Church Street
 forks off to the northeast. Mandlebury Road continues to both east
 (past the Police Station) and west (back to the City Centre).

>go east

 Mandlebury Road (outside Police Station)
 Mandlebury Road continues to east and west, while the main city police
 station stands just to the south, and Church Road runs off to the
 north.

>go east

 Crossroads
 Well lit by the street lighting, this crossroads is formed by the
 intersection of Mandlebury Road running from east to west, School Lane
 running north, and Cornwallis Avenue running to the south.

>go north

 School Lane
 School Lane is a relatively short street running north up to the
 junction with Church Street and south to Cornwallis Avenue. It's mainly
 residential, but the primary school you attended is on this street; its
 playground is just to the east.

 You hear a footfall slowly approaching down the street, and turn to see
 a figure walking towards you. As the figure passes under a street
 light, you see it's a slender young woman with long dark hair. You feel
 sure it must be her even before you can see her properly. You start
 walking towards her, eager yet apprehensive at finally meeting her. She
 walks on a few paces, then stops in a dark place between lamp posts,
 waiting for you to reach her.

 It is her; of course it is her. Even from a few yards away in the
 moonlight you're quite sure, and once you stop a couple of feet away no
 possible doubt remains: it's Emma.

 "Hello David," she says, "I'm glad you made it. I hope you had better
 luck than I did; did you find the key?"

>tell her yes
 "Yes, miraculously enough, I did!" you reply triumphantly, handing her
 the key.

 "Thank heavens for that!" she replies, taking the key. She holds it up
 in the bright moonlight, then nods, "Yes, this looks like the one," she
 tells you. With a rapid motion she inserts the key into the small metal
 box she's holding and gives it a quick twist, "Oh yes," she declares,
 "That's definitely the one. Thank you!" Smiling her most alluring smile
 she adds, "Tell me David, do you trust me?"

>tell her yes
 (Emma that)
 "Yes, of course I trust you!" you declare.

 "Then help me defeat the Enemy once and for all, just push this
 button," she requests, holding out the small box to you, "Will you do
 that for me?"

>push button
 (the big red button)
 You push the button, but nothing obvious happens.

 Well, something obvious happens. She laughs out loud and punches the
 air in triumph, shouting, "Yes!" Beaming at you fondly she continues,
 "Dear David, I always knew you were my truest friend, the one person I
 could always rely on.  That's why I had to share this with you. Would
 you like to kiss me? Yes, I can see in your eyes you would. Go on -
 kiss me - I know you've always been dying to, and now you're about to
 die with me!"

 She smiles at your utter bafflement, then goes on, "I'm afraid someone
 tipped them all off -- I suppose it must have been Danny, he was the
 only one who knew enough -- so they all got away, and I really wanted
 to take them all with me. Still, David, you stayed behind for me, and
 that's good because you're the only one who never rejected me, so you
 mustn't reject me now -- me or my nightfall."

 "Emma, what are you talking about?" you ask, aghast.

 "We're about to reach Nightfall: final, ultimate, wonderful nightfall!
 This whole city is about to become a pile of radioactive ash!" she
 declares brightly, as if this were the best possible thing imaginable,
 "You have just detonated my bomb, bless you! So, you deserve to share
 in my triumph! At last I've achieved something that no one can ignore!
 This place never did value me properly, I've suffered far too many
 rejections! You do understand, don't you? I tried - I really tried - I
 always did my best, but other people kept stealing the prizes. That's
 why I had to kill Kate, of course - and why I have to destroy this

 love you madly, so go on, take me: hug me, kiss me, make mad passionate
 love to me; I'm yours till death us do part!"

>make love to emma
 You kiss her on the lips and find yourself taken slightly aback at the
 enthusiasm of her response.

 "Death, destruction, decay, these three things abide," she says, "but
 the greatest of these..."

 Then suddenly there's an ear-splitting roar that shatters your eardrums
 so you hear no more, a blinding flash that melts your eyeballs so you
 see no more, and a searing moment of intense pain as your skin blisters
 in intense heat and your body is buffeted by wind and debris. Then, at
 last, comes merciful oblivion.

 key?"

>ask emma about mastema
 "What's all this stuff about Mastema -- the signature on the poster in

 "Oh that," she laughs, "Once I realized that A.D. Stanilev was an

 own name, as a kind of homage to the great man. But I asked you
 something: Did you manage to find the key?"

>ask emma about degree
 "You got a very good degree, Emma," you remark, "Wasn't it good enough

 "It wasn't good enough, was it?" she snaps back, "Kate's was better, as

 She barely glances at the khaki peaked cap.

 She brushes your question aside: "No, David, I asked if you'd found the

 Emma takes the box of chocolates off you and looks inside. "How kind,"

 hadn't been empty. It would be kinder still if you'd just answer my
 question: Did you manage to find the key?"

>ask emma about brooch
 "Here, you might want this back," you say, handing her the gold brooch.

 "Thank you, how -- quaint," she replies with a lopsided smile, "I'll

 You are carrying a small screwdriver, a steak knife, a heavy mallet, a
 prominent notice, a metal detector, a portable cassette player
 (closed), inside which is a black cassette, a khaki peaked cap, a long
 rod, a torch, a sharp kitchen knife, a bar mat, a matchbook, a small
 brown envelope (open but empty), seventeen documents (a civil defence
 manual, a large blue diary, a small scrap of yellow paper, an

>ask her about jeremy

 "What exactly happened between you and Jeremy?" you inquire.

 "We went out for a bit, then he called it off," she shrugs, "he turned

 never mind that; I asked you something: Did you manage to find the

 Don't you have any compunction about killing Saunders?" you ask.

 "Why should I?" she replies, "I planned far more deaths than that. Now
 tell me: Have you found the key?"

 "Never mind Danny," she interrupts you, "He really doesn't matter now.
 Now tell me: Did you manage to find the key?"

 manage to find the key?"

>again
 (Emma about that)
 "Did you kill Kate?" you ask.

 "What do you think?" she shoots back, "But never mind that, just answer
 the question I asked you: Have you found the key?"

>again
 (Emma about that)
 "Did you kill Kate?" you ask.

 "What do you think?" she shoots back, "But never mind that, just answer
 the question I asked you: Did you manage to find the key?"

>look
 School Lane
 School Lane is a relatively short street running north up to the
 junction with Church Street and south to Cornwallis Avenue. It's mainly
 residential, but the primary school you attended is on this street; its
 playground is just to the east.

 She stands staring at you.

 "I asked you a question," she reminds you. "Have you found the key?"

>go east
 Emma blocks your path, saying "Oh no, David, you're not slipping away
 now I've finally caught up with you!"

>sing
 You're embarrassed to; her singing voice is so much better than yours.

>throw flat key
 Dropped.

 "I asked you a question," she reminds you. "Have you found the key?"

>say no
 "No, I'm afraid not," you lie, "There really wasn't much hope of
 finding it in any of those places in the dark, was there?"

 "No, I suppose not," she sighs. "Damn! You may as well have this then,"
 she says, handing you the small grey box, "It's our only hope of
 defeating the Enemy, but it's no good without the key. So what are we
 going to do now? Do you have a plan for dealing with the Enemy?"

>yes
 "Yes -- let's get out of here before the Enemy arrive," you suggest.

 "It's much too late for that," she tells you, "The Enemy has been here
 all along. Wait a minute though..." she feels in her pockets and then
 gives a triumphant smile, "Ah, thank goodness for that! I think I've
 found the spare!" She grabs your palm and presses something into it.
 When you look you see a flat metal key there.

 "We can defeat the Enemy after all," she tells you, "all you need to do
 is to put the key in the hole, give it a turn, and push the red button.
 Will you do that for me, David?"

>drop flat key
 Dropped.

 "What are you waiting for?" she demands, "Are you going to press that
 button for me or aren't you?"

>look
 School Lane
 School Lane is a relatively short street running north up to the
 junction with Church Street and south to Cornwallis Avenue. It's mainly
 residential, but the primary school you attended is on this street; its
 playground is just to the east.

 She stands staring at you.

 You can also see a small flat metal key here.

 "What are you waiting for?" she demands, "Are you going to press that
 button for me or aren't you?"

>examine grey box
 It's rectangular in shape, with a big red button and a small keyhole.

 "What are you waiting for?" she demands, "Are you going to press that
 button for me or aren't you?"

>take grey box
 You already have that.

>drop it
 Emma looks mildly vexed, but picks up the box and hands it back to you.
 "Careful!" she admonishes you.

>throw it
 Emma looks vaguely annoyed, but picks up the box and hands it back to
 you. "Clumsy!" she admonishes you.

>eat it
 That's plainly inedible.

>break it
 You smash the box against the ground, bursting open its case. She
 watches bemused as you rip out its wires, and then stamp the remains of
 the thing underfoot.

 "No! No!" she cries, "What have you done? You've ruined everything! You
 - you of all people - you have betrayed me!"

 With a demented shriek, she runs off into the night, leaving you
 momentarily dazed and alone, until you collect yourself and hurry off
 after her.

 City Centre
 The junction where the High Street crosses Mandlebury Road is generally
 reckoned to be the central point of the city. From here the High Street
 runs north up past your office and south towards Preston Bridge and the
 ring road, while Mandlebury Road runs east towards the police station
 and west towards the river. Most of the buildings on the junction are
 closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit,
 and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest.





 The night is just turning to dawn and you hear the sound of distant
 birdsong. Soon the city will be bustling with life once more; the bomb
 disposal people are already at work and it should be safe for people to
 start returning this afternoon. You have saved the city.

 You couldn't save her. You caught up with her just in time to see her
 throw herself into the river. You tried looking for her; you jumped in
 where you thought you'd seen her go under, and swam around for as long
 as you could, but you never found her, so eventually you gave up.

 Perhaps it's better that way, for now at last she is at peace.

 And you? You feel quite strange, as if you'd suddenly woken up on an
 alien world that was both like and unlike home. Your idol has been
 shattered: she was not what you thought; for all her brilliance and
 beauty, she was not worthy of the pedestal you put her on. But then,
 perhaps no human being should be worshipped. In any case, now she's
 gone you can at last move on. It's time to start living your life
 without her. You look around you and decide that from now on your life
 is probably best lived elsewhere - this city holds too many memories
 for you. But before you go you know there is one last task you must
 perform.

 You must put some fresh flowers on Kate's grave.

>examine her
 (Emma)
 She is tall, slender, and to your eyes, utterly beautiful, but the
 moonlight makes her look a little ghostlike, exaggerating both the
 palor of her skin and the darkness of her hair. She's carrying a
 chocolate box.

 "What are you waiting for?" she demands, "Are you going to press that
 button for me or aren't you?"

>kill emma
 You don't want to harm her yet.

>stab emma with knife
 Which do you mean, the steak knife or the sharp kitchen knife?

>sharp kitchen knife
 You're not feeling quite that murderous yet.

>hit emma
 You don't want to harm her yet.

>press button
 (the big red button)
 You push the button, but nothing happens.

 "It won't work without the key. Put the key in the keyhole and turn
 it," Emma tells you.

>put key in box
 Which do you mean, the small flat metal key, the large iron key, the
 large car key, the small brass key or the office key?

>flat key
 (the small grey box)
 (first taking the small flat metal key)
 "Good!" Emma declares, as you fit the key into its hole, "Now just turn
 it and push the button!"

 "What are you waiting for?" she demands, "Are you going to press that
 button for me or aren't you?"

>turn key
 (the small flat metal key)
 You turn the key through 180 degrees.

 "Good!" she declares, "Now press the button. Will you do that?"

>press button
 (the big red button)
 You push the button, but nothing obvious happens.

 Well, something obvious happens. She laughs out loud and punches the
 air in triumph, shouting, "Yes!" Beaming at you fondly she continues,
 "Dear David, I always knew you were my truest friend, the one person I
 could always rely on.  That's why I had to share this with you. Would
 you like to kiss me? Yes, I can see in your eyes you would. Go on -
 kiss me - I know you've always been dying to, and now you're about to
 die with me!"

 She smiles at your mild bemusement, then goes on, "I'm afraid someone
 tipped them all off -- I suppose it must have been Danny, he was the
 only one who knew enough -- so they all got away, and I really wanted
 to take them all with me. Still, David, you stayed behind for me, and
 that's good because you're the only one who never rejected me, so you
 mustn't reject me now -- me or my nightfall."

 "Emma, what are you talking about?" you ask sadly.

 "We're about to reach Nightfall: final, ultimate, wonderful nightfall!
 This whole city is about to become a pile of radioactive ash!" she
 declares brightly, as if this were the best possible thing imaginable,
 "You have just detonated my bomb, bless you! So, you deserve to share
 in my triumph! At last I've achieved something that no one can ignore!
 This place never did value me properly, I've suffered far too many
 rejections! You do understand, don't you? I tried - I really tried - I
 always did my best, but other people kept stealing the prizes. That's
 why I had to kill Kate, of course - and why I have to destroy this
 city! Don't look so upset, David -- death is the most loving gift I
 have to give, and you of all people deserve my best! Just think what
 I'm sharing with you! I know you've always fancied me, and now I know I
 love you madly, so go on, take me: hug me, kiss me, make mad passionate
 love to me; I'm yours till death us do part!"

>kill her
 (Emma)
 In sudden fury, you lash out at her with your fists. She's momentarily
 taken off guard, so you land one punch on her jaw, but then she dodges
 out of your range, saying, "Really, David, that's no way for a
 gentleman to behave!"

 "Death, destruction, decay, these three things abide," she says, "but
 the greatest of these... Hang on. It's late!" She frowns momentarily,
 then relaxes into a smile, "I should not be so impatient - any moment
 now! Just give me one last kiss while you still can!"

>stab her with kitchen knife
 (Emma with the sharp kitchen knife)
 In sudden fury, you stab Emma through the heart, crying "You murderous
 bitch!"

 She stares at you in astonishment, then sinks slowly to the ground.
 You turn and walk away, leaving her to die alone. Whether you'll
 confess to killing her is something you can leave to tomorrow -- you
 suspect no one will blame you if you tell the story in the right way.
 Right now you just want to walk and walk, and ponder the salvation of a
 city and the death of a dream.
