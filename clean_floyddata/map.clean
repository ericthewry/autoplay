 The white door in the hallway is new. You can't remember having seen
 it before. After the children left home, you had expected the house to
 be quieter. You hadn't expected it to grow. Now, with Brady gone,
 Samantha living with her boyfriend one town over, and everything being
 packed for the move, unexpected doorways and passages are the norm.
 Just yesterday morning, you had been vacuuming the bedroom and noticed
 a small archway behind the wardrobe leading to goodness knows where.

 Sometimes, on the nights when Derek doesn't come home, you imagine you
 can hear the creaks and groans of rending wood and stone as the house
 tortuously shifts itself into new configurations.

 When Derek arrived home from work last night, you tried to tell him
 about it, as you do most nights.

 "You should be glad of the extra space, Elaine," he said, "you've
 always wanted a workroom." Most of the time he just sighs and turns
 the TV on, only half listening to you.

 A Deconstructural Fiction by Ade McT
 Release 1 / Serial number 150926 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)


 <span class="floydstyle em">Monday</span>

 The week starts like it always does. Slowly. It was an effort to get
 out of bed this morning. Derek had left before the morning light
 spilled half-heartedly into the room and from the coolness of the
 sheets on his bed, you judge he had left early. His coffee cup was
 still warm, though. You imagine he had taken his coffee out into the
 garden.

 Some mornings, especially in summer when the weight of light on your
 eyelids wakes you early, you come across him in the garden staring
 across the expanse of lawn. At these times especially you try not to
 intrude but occasionally you will watch him through the kitchen
 window, wondering what he is thinking about.

 But today all that's left of Derek's morning routine is a half-empty
 coffee cup and a few toast crumbs on the sideboard. A week can go past
 when these remains are all you see of him, and this morning, like
 every morning, you begin your day by wiping away this evidence that
 Derek was ever here. Most of the rest of the morning is spent doing
 those little things that are done on auto-pilot, and, once done,
 forgotten until they need to be done again.

 It's not until you are on the upstairs hallway, dusting the leaves of
 the rubber plant, that you see the white door you noticed yesterday
 stands open, light spilling from it into the darkened hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway has no windows. It's always been a dingy place when the
 doors to the bedrooms are closed. Pictures line the walls, barely
 illuminated. To the south of you is the spare room, opposite it,
 Brady's room and the hallway stretches toward the east side of the
 house. A flight of stairs leads down into the entrance hall, and the
 new white door hangs open next to the staircase to the west.


 The rubber plant you brought home from the garden centre a year after
 you moved in sits on a small plinth in the corner.

>examine pictures

 You don't really enjoy having your picture taken. You haven't for
 years. If the camera comes out, it's always you who is holding it, or
 trying to blend into the background blur, looking away.

 When you were first married, it was fun, and you still have the black
 and white passport sized set of linked photographs from the
 photo-booth in which you and Derek made funny faces at the camera,
 laughing.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a map

>examine map

 You started drawing the map on the day you noticed the house start to
 grow. Now, your drawing seems to have taken on a life of it's own.
 Each morning, it has changed. Sometimes, when you are walking around
 the house, the map seems to come to life in your hands.

 You see that since yesterday, there is a new door on the west wall of
 the hallway, and a new door east of the Main Bedroom.
>examine me

 You don't often look at yourself. It's difficult to pinpoint the
 moment when you stopped looking in the mirror, or glancing at your
 hair in a handy reflection in a shop window. How would someone else
 sum you up? Elaine Paterson. 40 years old. Dowdy in a neat and
 unassuming sort of way. Quiet. You wear thick jumpers when it's cold.

>examine white door

 You see nothing special about the white door.

>examine plant

 Perhaps it's where you put it, but for some reason, over the years,
 this plant has grown slowly, the leaves small, the trunk pencil-wide.

 You remember the day you brought it home. "It won't grow flowers, you
 know," had said Derek as soon as he saw you come in the door.

 You nodded and smiled. "Yes," you had said, "It says so on the label."
 You remember having a cold, coughing, the wind outside had made your
 fingers feel like they belonged to someone else.

 "You know," he had said, "Malcolm and Judy were thinking of inviting
 us to dinner tonight."

 "Oh?" you replied, unwilling to commit, a vague feeling of dread
 creeping over you.

 "We should go. Maybe you could try and make an effort this time."

 You didn't answer him, but you felt bright spots of red appears on
 your cheeks. He turned, losing interest in both the plant and you, and
 walked away. Three steps. You had been left holding the plant,
 uncertain.

 "Where shall we put it," you had said to his back,  your voice small.
 "It might look nice in the lounge."

 "Good Lord, no," he had snapped. "What's the point if it will never
 flower? Ugly looking thing anyway. Keep it out of the way somewhere."

 You had burst into tears right there in the middle of the entrance
 hall. It was the first time you had ever cried in this house. Maybe
 that's why you remember it so clearly. So you had stuck it away in the
 upstairs hall - out of sight.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway has no windows. It's always been a dingy place when the
 doors to the bedrooms are closed. Pictures line the walls, barely
 illuminated. To the south of you is the spare room, opposite it,
 Brady's room and the hallway stretches toward the east side of the
 house. A flight of stairs leads down into the entrance hall, and the
 new white door hangs open next to the staircase to the west.


 The rubber plant you brought home from the garden centre a year after
 you moved in sits on a small plinth in the corner.

>go south

 (first opening the spare room door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spare Room</span>
 The work bench, so recently unpacked and painstakingly pieced
 together, sits unused in the corner. The vast expanse of empty floor
 is intimidating.

 Over the years, the function of this room has changed and evolved
 alongside the family. It used to be a playroom for the children. Then
 it was an office when Derek worked at home for six months. Then it was
 a spare bedroom for visitors. But it was used so infrequently that
 Derek suggested you use it as a workroom "to do all those things
 you've always wanted to do."

 It was a good idea, but now you've cleared the old bed away and put a
 workbench in here, it still remains almost entirely unused. It's as
 if, when confronted with all this space and opportunity, your mind
 went blank, and everything you thought of seemed a waste of time
 somehow. It's like you're paralysed by indecision.



>examine bench

 The wooden surface of the workbench is entirely empty.

>dismantle bench

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look under bench

>stand on bench

 You get onto the workdesk.

 (first getting off the workdesk)
 You can't go that way.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway has no windows. It's always been a dingy place when the
 doors to the bedrooms are closed, but the open door allows some light
 to creep in. Pictures line the walls, barely illuminated. To the south
 of you is the spare room, opposite it, Brady's room and the hallway
 stretches toward the east side of the house. A flight of stairs leads

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Away from the faint light from the stairwell, the hall is darker, and
 the pictures that continue to line the walls are more indistinct. The
 door in the north wall leads to Samantha's room, opposite it, your and
 Derek's room, and the hallway stretches to the west. To the east, a
 doorway leads into the bathroom.

>go north

 (first opening Brady's bedroom door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brady's Room</span>
 Brady's room remains in the state it was when he moved out. You've
 left it untouched in the hope that one day you will hear a knock on
 the door and it will be Brady there, his tall thin frame slightly
 stooped, leaning against the doorway, a five day scrag of beard
 covering his habitual cheeky grin.

 The posters on the wall, reminders of winning sports teams and fading
 rock bands, are further apart than yesterday, as though spaced out and
 shifted by some unseen hand, showing acres of cream wallpaper. The
 bed, stripped of sheets, is only a textured mattress, the desk, piled
 with hockey trophies from his schooldays. Grey light from the window
 filters into the hallway behind you.


 Derek had said that Brady wasn't going to be back, and you should
 remove his things - sell them maybe - empty the room. You had shaken
 your head. "He'll be back," you said, "he'll always come home." Derek
 had disagreed. Privately, lately, you have been doubting it also. It
 wouldn't hurt for him to call, you often find yourself thinking. When
 the message light blinks on the answering machine, you always have a
 moment of hope.


>examine posters

 Brady's tastes always ran to...loud. The posters seem to be mainly
 long haired men shouting into the camera or clean cut young men,
 heavily muscled under hockey armour.

>examine trophies

 Golden plastic reminders of all Brady's hockey injuries.

 It wasn't something you and Derek had pushed him into, hockey. One day
 he had come home from school, face flushed around a wide grin and a
 black eye and had announced he was going to play hockey. On the ice.
 You hadn't even know they did ice hockey at his school. He had been
 good at it, too.

 The first time you went to see him play, his slim build standing out
 amongst his stockier team mates, even your uneducated eyes could see
 he had something - some sort of grace that floated him over the ice
 and lifted the game somehow. Whenever he had the puck, a palpable
 excitement seized the crowd - an unconscious reaction to his easy
 elegance.

 It only made the times he was brutally crushed into the barrier or
 mowed down by a lumpen opponent all the more unbearable.

>examine window

 Through the window, you can see the garden.

>examine garden

 Brady's room overlooks the lawn.

 The wooden desk is battered and dented and completely covered by
 Brady's old hockey trophies.

 Away from the faint light from the stairwell, the hall is darker, and
 the pictures that continue to line the walls are more indistinct. The
 door in the north wall leads to Samantha's room, opposite it, your and
 Derek's room, and the hallway stretches to the west. To the east, a
 doorway leads into the bathroom.


>examine pictures

 It's like a history, this hallway, or a story. Black and white becomes
 colour. Hairstyles change from long to short and then long again.
 Young people become middle aged. Babies appear and disappear, becoming
 children. Through it all is the constant presence of Derek: A frowning
 boy; a serious looking young man with neat hair; A harried young
 father balancing two small children in his arms at some seaside
 resort; A middle aged man sat at the kitchen table.

 At this end of the hallway you are part of the tale, but your story
 seems to end somewhere in the middle.

>go north

 The pause before you enter Sam's room is almost subconscious. When she
 was at home, you were always an uninvited presence there and with both
 of you in her room, resentment hung thick, turning most interactions
 poisonous. Now, even with the room vacated there's a sense, at the
 doorway, of unwelcoming. It's not something you've been able to shake
 off even after these last two months without her.

 (first opening Sam's bedroom door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Samantha's Room</span>
 The bed under the window seems further away today. The floor,
 uncluttered with Sam's possessions, has stretched slightly during the
 night. You used to be able to touch the empty desk from the door, and
 the walls, bare of brightly coloured posters, appear taller - the
 ceiling more distant.

 After Sam left, Derek had piled everything remaining into black
 plastic bags and, shaking with anger, had dumped them in the garbage.
 You feel now that maybe this had been the wrong thing to do - that you
 should have taken Sam's possessions from the trash and stored them
 somewhere. But, at the time, you had been angry too.

 It had been the first time you noticed the house's growth. As Derek
 removed books and posters and CD's and plastic figurines or furry
 jumbles of cuddly toys, the walls of the room had expanded. Walking
 across the floors had taken longer. Not much, but enough to be
 noticeable. Eight years living in the same house, vacuuming the same
 floors, has made you sensitive to any small change.


>examine bed

 You bought this bed when Sam was only eight. You had just moved here.
 At the time it had been a princess bed with a pink gauze canopy. Over
 the years, Sam had grown out of the canopy, but she had refused to let
 the bed go, even though, as she grew, her feet stuck further and
 further over the bottom.

>examine posters

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine desk

 Just a plain wooden desk but, over the years, Sam has decorated it in
 graffiti, sequins, and vari-colored crepe paper, depending on her
 moods.

>read graffiti

 You see nothing special about decorations.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Away from the faint light from the stairwell, the hall is darker, and
 the pictures that continue to line the walls are more indistinct. A
 little more light spills in from the open door. The door in the north
 wall leads to Samantha's room, opposite it, your and Derek's room, and
 the hallway stretches to the west. To the east, a doorway leads into
 the bathroom.


>go east

 (first opening the bathroom door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 The bathroom is all in pale green. The toilet, sink and bath were here
 when you moved in, and there never really seemed to be a reason to
 change them. The mirrored cabinet above the sink steams up when anyone
 has a shower and because of the poor ventilation through the small fan
 in the window, the grouting between the tiles has always had mold
 problems.

>examine window

 Through the window, you can see the garden.

 wall leads to Samantha's room, opposite it, your and Derek's room, and
 the hallway stretches to the west. To the east, a doorway leads into
 the bathroom.


>go south

 (first opening the main bedroom door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Bedroom</span>
 This has always been your favourite room. The large south facing
 window lets in plenty of light which makes it brighter than the rest
 of the house. However, over the last couple of days, the wooden floor
 has stretched, each pine tile becoming larger and the two single beds
 that used to be separated by the width of the small table are now
 several paces apart. Your dressing table, loaded with detritus, is
 under the window and a wardrobe in the corner partially obscures a new
 passageway that leads out of the eastern side of the house.

 The beds are new. It had been your suggestion. You had surprised
 yourself one night, when, after a couple of glasses of wine, you had
 said to Derek, "Shall we get single beds, do you think? You need to
 get up so early, and you know how I toss and turn and keep you awake
 sometimes."

 Derek had looked up, surprised. "I suppose we might as well," he had
 said, after a pause, "it's not as though we need a double at our time
 of life."

 It had been a strange feeling, that first night, when the new beds had
 been unpacked and covered in freshly bought linen. Twenty five years
 of sleeping next to a warm, breathing body, and space to throw out an
 arm or a leg and still feel supported, replaced by open space each
 side of you. It had been a strange feeling, but not an unpleasant one,
 and you had slept better that first night than in a long time.


>examine detritus

 Just your accumulated personal items that seem to have built up over
 the years. A small avalanche of lipsticks and mascara bottles,
 hairbrushes and curlers, foundation and pins.

>examine bed

 Which do you mean, your bed or Derek's bed?

>examine my bed

 A single bed. It's quite small, but comfortable. After twenty years of
 sharing a bed, you had forgotten how pleasurable it was to be able to
 sleep in your own space.

>examine derek's bed

 Derek prefers a much harder mattress to you. He says it's good for his
 back.

>flip matress

>dust

 You rub the map.

>examine wardrobe

 A large wooden wardrobe in the corner of the room. It is closed.

 A thicket of greys and green, the clothes hang listlessly.

>look behind clothes

 You can't see any such thing.

>enter wardrobe

 You get into the wardrobe.

 In the wardrobe you can see your and Derek's clothes.

>go south

 You would have to get out of the wardrobe first.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Bedroom</span>

 window lets in plenty of light which makes it brighter than the rest

 several paces apart. Your dressing table, loaded with detritus, is
 under the window and a wardrobe in the corner partially obscures a new
 passageway that leads out of the eastern side of the house.


>go east

 As you walk through the entrance, the air seems to <span class="floydstyle em">shimmer</span>
 somehow.

 You recognise this room. It's the downstairs hallway in your Aunt
 May's house. It has the same musty becalmed air, smelling of age and
 dust.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Short Corridor</span>
 The old clock in the corner punctuates the seconds with its deep bass
 ticking. All the pictures are still on the wall - lined up ancestors
 and forgotten relatives mixing with cheap reproductions of Monet's
 landscapes. A musty old sofa against the wall is lit up by the one
 window. A door to the south leads into your Aunt's front room.


 You were here only last month. Just before your Aunt was finally
 shipped off to the old folk's home. It wasn't a pleasant visit. Aunt
 May had been quiet, pensive, sad even. She had spent the whole time
 staring out of the window into her garden and hardly speaking. When
 you came in, Aunt May had been sat ramrod straight in her armchair.
 She turned her head when you entered the room, but hardly seemed to
 recognise you.

 She had been upset. Your Aunt Anna was taking her to an old folk's
 home because she was getting too frail to look after herself. When she
 had asked you if she couldn't come and live with you, a big part of
 you wanted to say yes. But, with the move, and everything that was
 happening with Samantha, it just seemed as though the fight with Derek
 would be too daunting.

 So you had made some excuses.

 On your way out she had looked up at you. "Remember me," she had said.
 "But not like this." You hadn't known how to respond. So you had left
 quietly, closing the lounge door behind you. Your mother's younger
 sister, Anna, had taken May to the home two weeks later. You haven't
 seen her since.

>examine pictures

 A brief history of your maternal family tree. Uncles and aunts you
 have a passing acquaintance with mingle with more distant relatives.
 Dotted here and there are Monet prints. Your Aunt May loved Monet.

>examine sofa

 Your Aunt May has had this faded old thing for years. It was in her
 caravan when you were a child.

 She always told you it was a wedding present . When you pointed out
 that she had never been married, Aunt May would tap her nose and wink.
 As a young woman, you pretended to be annoyed but secretly you were
 delighted that this woman had so many secrets. So many hidden sides to
 her. You always hoped that when you reached her age, your life would
 have been as complicated and interesting.

>examine window

 Through the window, you can see the vegetable garden.

>examine garden

 Aunt May's garden used to be beautiful. And productive. She grew all
 kinds of vegetables and fruit. When she visited, it was always with a
 basket in which were unlikely combinations of odd vegetables.
 Aubergines mixed alongside purple french beans and baby turnips. Now,
 with her advancing years, she has let it become overgrown and wild.

>examine clock

 Aunt May has had this clock forever. Its tick is like a constant note
 in your life.

>look behind clock

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine map

 You see that since yesterday, there is a new door on the west wall of
 the hallway, and a new door east of the Main Bedroom.
>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aunt May's Front Room</span>
 Despite her age, Aunt May keeps her home spotlessly clean. The window
 allows her to watch the comings and goings in the street from her
 strategically positioned armchair. An old dresser holds brass
 ornaments and a selection of glass flowers. The only door leads back
 out into the hallway.


 On the dresser is an old folk's home leaflet.

 Aunt May sits in her chair, hands folded quietly in her lap, staring
 out of the window. She looks up and smiles wanly. It seems to take her
 a while to recognise you. "Hello, Elaine love," she says, eventually.
 "It's nice that you could drop in, especially now I'm not going to be
 here much longer."

>talk to may

 To engage in a conversation, try to ASK Aunt May ABOUT something, TELL
 Aunt May ABOUT something, or SHOW Aunt May something. Or, even, try
 saying "hello". Once you are chatting, you can just use "ASK ABOUT
 something", or if you are feeling confident, as a short hand, just "A
 something". You could also ask Aunt May to do things using: Aunt May,
 GO SOUTH for example.

>ask may about may

 "Hi, Aunt May," you say.

 "Yes, dear?" she asks.

 "How are you, Auntie May?" you ask.

 "I'm fine, thank you," she assures you. "Not that any of you care."

 Aunt May sighs heavily.

>examine leaflet

 "Shady Willow Retirement Community". The photographs make it look
 quite nice.

 Aunt May shifts in her seat, and clasps her hands in her lap.

>ask may about me

 You prattle on for a while about your life, and the move, and Derek
 and the kids, but it's not long before you run out of things to say,
 and the enormous silence in the room reasserts itself.

 "Sounds like things are going well," says Aunt May, but she shakes her
 head slightly. "I'm surprised you've got time to come and visit."

 Aunt May lets out a sigh that seems to come right from deep inside
 her. ""Oh, Elaine," she says, "they're wanting me to go to an old
 folk's home. I don't want to go. They're saying I'm not right on my
 own because of the fire."

 The call with Aunt Anna had been difficult. After the fire, she had
 wanted you to take Aunt May "for a few weeks while we get her sorted
 out". You had thought at the time, with some justification, that it
 was unfair of her to ask at such short notice. Anna is only just older
 than you. She has plenty of space in her house now her kids have left
 home. She blamed her husband. "He's always working," she had said. "I
 don't think I can cope with her by myself." You had demurred, making
 some excuses about moving house and Samantha being difficult. "You
 could at least try, Elaine," Anna had ended the call by saying. "We
 don't ask you to do much for the family."

>ask may about fire

 "Did you have a fire?" you say.

 "Just a little accident," replies Aunt May. "I nodded off while my
 dinner was on the stove."

 Aunt May turns her head slightly to look up the street, but you can't
 see what she is looking at.

 "I know I can't stay," says Aunt May, and her voice catches for a
 moment, "but it would be nice to live with someone I loved rather than
 all those strangers."

 Aunt May had stayed with Anna for just a short time. She moved back
 into her flat despite Anna's protestations. Anna wanted to sell May's
 house. To do it up and use the money to fund May's final years in an
 old folks home. Your other aunts had disagreed. They wanted to get May
 a nurse - to let her stay here amongst all her things. The
 conversation had passed you by.

>ask may about anna

 "How is Aunt Anna?" you ask.

 "Don't talk to me about her", says your Aunt, her voice raising
 slightly. "She's no sister of mine. Forcing me into that Shady Willows
 place. It's a place for old people. Not for me."

 Aunt May looks at you directly. "I know you've had a tough time
 recently, Elaine, she says, "and I don't want to put on you, but
 you've got all that spare space now Brady and Sam are gone, and I know
 you're lonely what with Derek working all the time. Perhaps I could
 come and stay with you? We could be company for each other, and I
 could help out a bit around the house. What do you say?"

 Do you tell Aunt May "yes" or "no"?
>yes
 Do you tell Aunt May "yes" or "no"?


 "I'd love to have you, Aunt May," you reply. "You're welcome to say as
 long as you like."

 Aunt May smiles, and a tear trickles slowly down the side of her nose.
 "I knew you'd come through, Elaine," she says. "You've always had the
 kindest heart."


>hug may

 You place a kiss against your Aunt's dry cheek. She smiles, but
 doesn't turn to face you.


 "Derek's been working hard," you say. "He says he is up for a
 promotion"

 "I remember when you met him," replies Aunt May. "You two looked good
 together."

 Aunt May coughs, and dabs at her lips with a small handkerchief.

>ask may about garden

 "Your garden's a bit overgrown," you say. "Doesn't Mr Turner come
 around anymore?"

 "No," replies Aunt May. "I can't really afford him these days on my
 pension, and I don't get out there much anymore."

>tell may about house

 "We're moving house," you say. "Derek has picked us a little bungalow
 up cheap. It's going to be much less work now the kids have left
 home."

 "Does it have a garden?" asks Aunt May. "You always loved gardening."

 You don't answer, because you realise you are not entirely sure.

>may, bye

 Aunt May just shakes her head. "I'm sure with your young legs, you
 could do that," she says.

 Aunt May wipes a weary hand across her face.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aunt May's Front Room</span>
 Despite her age, Aunt May keeps her home spotlessly clean. The window
 allows her to watch the comings and goings in the street from her
 strategically positioned armchair. An old dresser holds brass
 ornaments and a selection of glass flowers. The only door leads back
 out into the hallway.


 On the dresser is an old folk's home leaflet.

 Aunt May sits in her chair, hands folded quietly in her lap, staring
 out of the window.

>examine flowers

 You used to play with the brass ornaments as a child. They are a mix
 of circus animals and ancient horse brasses. The glass flowers are
 your Aunt's pride and joy. She has collected them for years.

>examine dresser

 A chipped white antique dresser.

 On the dresser is an old folk's home leaflet.

>go north

 On your way out of the room, Aunt May looks up at you. "I'll see you
 soon," she says, with a wide smile, "just give me a call when you're
 ready for me." Her smile turns slightly wolfish. "I'll call Anna and
 give her the good news."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Short Corridor</span>
 The old clock in the corner punctuates the seconds with its deep bass
 ticking. All the pictures are still on the wall - lined up ancestors
 and forgotten relatives mixing with cheap reproductions of Monet's
 landscapes. A musty old sofa against the wall is lit up by the one
 window. A door to the south leads into your Aunt's front room.


>go north

 The window is shut: you'd break the glass.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Bedroom</span>
 This has always been your favourite room. The large south facing
 window lets in plenty of light which makes it brighter than the rest
 of the house. However, over the last couple of days, the wooden floor
 has stretched, each pine tile becoming larger and the two single beds
 that used to be separated by the width of the small table are now
 several paces apart. Your dressing table, loaded with detritus, is
 under the window and a wardrobe in the corner partially obscures a new
 passageway that leads out of the eastern side of the house.


>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Away from the faint light from the stairwell, the hall is darker, and
 the pictures that continue to line the walls are more indistinct. A
 little more light spills in from the open door. The door in the north
 wall leads to Samantha's room, opposite it, your and Derek's room, and
 the hallway stretches to the west. To the east, a doorway leads into
 the bathroom.


>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway has no windows. It's always been a dingy place when the
 doors to the bedrooms are closed, but the open door allows some light
 to creep in. Pictures line the walls, barely illuminated. To the south
 of you is the spare room, opposite it, Brady's room and the hallway
 stretches toward the east side of the house. A flight of stairs leads
 down into the entrance hall, and the new white door hangs open next to
 the staircase to the west.


 The rubber plant you brought home from the garden centre a year after
 you moved in sits on a small plinth in the corner.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">White Room</span>
 The walls and floor seem to glow, as if lit by something inside the
 very fabric of the building. The only exit is back out to the hallway
 to the east.

 In the centre of the room, an old fashioned movie projector sits atop
 a plinth.

>examine projector

 It looks exactly like the projector your Aunt May used to have. Maybe
 she still does.

 When you were a child, every time your Mum took you to Aunt May's, the
 projector would make an appearance. Aunt May delighted in showing
 films of the family and films she had taken on her travels. Year after
 year, new footage emerged. It seemed never ending. You favourite movie
 was of your Mum as a young girl, playing on the beach with her
 sisters. It's a sharp, clear memory. Your Mum looks at the camera for
 a moment with a half-smile - distracted by something happening just
 off screen - and it was like you were there with them.

 The projector is currently switched off.

>turn on projector

 The projector crackles to life, the reels beginning to whirr and spin.
 On the wall opposite the door, silently, a white square of projected
 light appears.

 The white square is split and slashed by the visual crackle of
 fleeting imperfections and the number three flashes up, surrounded by
 a dark circle. Then this disappears and is replaced by the number two.
 Then the number one. The countdown stops, and the screen shows only
 pure white light.

 The film ends, to be replaced with crackles and dashes of visual
 noise. There is a clatter from the projector, and then a high speed
 whirring as it rewinds itself to the beginning. With a click, the
 white square disappears as the projector switches off.

>examine plinth

 The plinth is a twisted, organic looking column leading up to a small
 platform, on top of which is an old-fashioned movie projector.

 The glassed front door leads directly south onto the driveway, and

 lounge and the dining room to the north. The room is bare except for
 an occasional table next to the front door in the southern wall, on
 which the telephone and answering machine squat.

 The display on the answering machine is blank. The play messages
 button is right next to the display.

 You take the play messages button, but there's really nothing you want

 A slim plastic phone in its cradle.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lounge</span>
 Sometimes you think this room is made entirely from memories: the
 barometer on the wall that has indicated rain for years; the picture
 of your daughter, staring defiantly at the camera, flanked by the
 peaks of mountains; the wood paneling, a forgotten texture below the
 bookshelves; the books themselves, all green and blue leather -
 alphabetised soldier-sentries; a balding sofa and chair where Derek
 spends most of his evenings staring at the TV mounted to the wall.
 The too-small window overlooks the front driveway and lets in only
 just enough light.

 When you came to view the house, eight years ago this coming May, the
 first thing you had noticed was this window. A south facing room
 should be bright, sunlit, welcoming. Over the years, you had always
 meant to change it - to get the builders in and make it larger. Maybe
 a bay-window in which you could sit and read while the sun warmed your
 shoulders.

 But for some reason you had never got round to it, and now, if you are
 being honest with yourself, you are glad. Some days, you spend all day
 in here, curled up on the sofa, welcoming the tepid light.


>examine sofa

 Over the years the leather of the sofa has become shiny and worn.

>examine barometer

 This was your Aunty May's. It's never worked. The needle has always
 been stuck halfway between rain and drizzle.

 Aunt May gave it to you for your sixteenth birthday. It was an odd
 present, being broken even back then, but you had dutifully smiled and
 accepted it. Your father had hung it up in your bedroom where it lived
 on the wall between (and occasionally covered by) posters of Pink
 Floyd and, later, Nirvana.

 When she gave it to you, your Aunt had said "It's always useful for a
 sixteen year old to know the weather." She had said it with a wink,
 before planting a hairy kiss on your cheek. According to your mother,
 May had always been the strange sister. The oldest of six, she let her
 grey hair flow long and wild over her shoulders and had lived most of
 her life in a caravan.

>examine books

 Derek joined a book club. It sent him one blue leather bound classic
 per month for two years. Then it sent him one green bound work by
 Dickens. Now it's sending him red bound works by authors in their
 "American Masters" series. Neither he nor you have every actually read
 one, although you did start "Little Dorrit" once. The text was so
 small and dense though you kept drifting off to sleep and reading the
 same paragraph over and over again.

>examine tv

 A large flat screen attached to the wall opposite the window. Derek
 insisted on getting the largest. It is currently switched off, and the
 darkened screen shows a weakened reflection of the room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 All the bric-a-brac on the sideboard has been packed away for the
 move, leaving only dusty imprints on the wood. It had been filled with
 colourful plates and cups and seldom-used cookery books and odds and
 ends that the family had brought back from various holidays that
 couldn't find another home. Now the brown boxes on the floor and
 table, taped and anonymous, only serve to remind you of how much there
 is left to do before the removal van arrives next week.

 It hadn't been your idea to sell the house. Now, with the move only a
 few days away, the sheer volume of things you have accumulated as a
 family is entirely daunting. You have tried to pack, but instead, half
 way through filling a box, you find yourself wandering around the
 house with an ornament or a lamp or a small table in your hands,
 wondering where to put it.

 When he gets home from work, Derek doesn't say anything, but you can
 sense his frustration that the pile of packed boxes in the dining room
 hasn't grown.


>examine boxes

 The boxes are taped shut and give no clue as to what is inside them.

>examine sideboard

 This was your mother's, who had got it from her mother. It covers most
 of the wall against which it stands. You can't remember a time in your
 life when it wasn't present in your home.

 Your mother gave it to you when you were first married, and had moved
 into the little flat over the shop. "A good start," she had said,
 "something to build on."

 It had been far too big for your tiny new home, but you and Derek,
 laughing, had maneuvered it into place. You remember it had covered
 half of the kitchen door, so you both had to enter the room sideways.

>exits

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go north

 You can't go that way.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is due an update - it feels very seventies, with a faux
 marble worktop, dark wood-effect cupboards and garish tiling. The
 refrigerator is covered in scraps of paper and bills, all held in
 place by magnetic capital letters. The back door leads out of the east
 wall into the garden.

 The kitchen in the new house is smaller than this. That's OK, though.
 You don't spend as much time in here as you used to when the kids were
 at home. Derek usually doesn't get home until after he's eaten. The
 last time you cooked a proper meal was probably a couple of months
 ago. Before Sam left. You had cooked her favourite, lasagna, because
 she said she didn't feel well, and she had looked so tired and
 unhappy. You wanted to cheer her up. Straight afterward, she had run
 to the toilet to throw it all back up again.


 A calendar on the wall shows a grid of boxes for the month, all
 covered in small handwriting.

 On the refrigerator is a yellow post-it note.

 The clock on the wall ticks the seconds away into the air.

>examine post-it note

 "I'll be home at 7.00 pm. Derek."

 That's so like Derek. To put his name. As if you wouldn't know who had
 written it.

>examine clock

 The clock reads 3:13 pm.

>examine calendar

 Today your only job, according to the calendar, is to pack.


>examine fridge

 The fridge has become Derek's filing cabinet. It's where he puts all
 the unpaid bills and reminders and bank statements, all held in place
 in some sort of order by a magnetic alphabet.

 On the refrigerator is a yellow post-it note.

>open fridge

 The mostly empty shelves remind you that you need to tell Derek to go
 to the supermarket on his way home from work tomorrow. When you let go
 of the handle, the fridge door closes by itself.

>open cabinet

 You can't see any such thing.

>open door

 You open the back door.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden</span>
 High fences surround the garden, giving it an air of privacy,
 sheltered from the street and any watchful eyes peeping from behind
 curtains in the neighbour's windows. A small patio area, attached to
 the side of the house, on which is a table and a set of peeling wooden
 chairs gives way to scrubby grass that you haven't quite got around to
 cutting for far too long.

 Derek calls this your "little patch of wilderness". That's his
 half-joke that isn't a joke at all, but instead, really it's a cutting
 indictment wrapped up in humour - contempt masked with levity.

 "You can't even look after the bloody garden," Derek snapped at you
 once, after an argument about something you can't even remember. "It's
 what you wanted. It's why we moved here for goodness sake."

 When you were first married, gardening had been your passion. You
 inherited it from your mother, you suppose, whose own garden was, each
 year, a wondrous mass of colour and life.

>go south

 (first opening the front door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Driveway</span>
 Bounded by small grass borders that, via some unseen line down the
 middle, demarcate your house from the next, the driveway stretches out
 onto the road to the south. The open plan nature of the street is
 disconcerting.

 You're still not used to it, this openness of space, and this sharing
 of communal grass. When you grew up, each house in your terrace had
 its own little square patch of front garden bounded by a low stone
 wall. Sometimes with iron railings, painted green, or rusty, or
 shining black. Each garden had been a little statement by the house
 owner or tenant. Some had been lush bursts of colour in the spring and
 summer, some unkempt and weed-choked. Others had only been bare
 flagstones, empty and stark.

 It had been a matter of pride for your mother, that little twelve foot
 by twelve foot patch of space. Your father had the back yard reserved
 for his chickens and vegetables. Your mother owned that front space.
 It was hers entirely. She made it reflect herself.

 Your car is parked here.


>examine car

 Just a small grey car. You can't even remember what make and model it
 is. Nor can you remember the last time your drove it anywhere. Derek
 occasionally takes it out for a spin "to stop it seizing up."

 The bathroom is all in pale green. The toilet, sink and bath were here
 when you moved in, and there never really seemed to be a reason to
 change them. The mirrored cabinet above the sink steams up when anyone
 has a shower and because of the poor ventilation through the small fan
 in the window, the grouting between the tiles has always had mold
 problems.

 The too-small window overlooks the front driveway and lets in only
 just enough light.


 Derek perches at the end of the sofa watching the TV. He glances up at
 you and smiles briefly before turning back to the show.

>kiss derek

 You want to kiss Derek, but he's been so distant recently that you
 can't bring yourself to bridge the space between you.

>examine barometer

 This was your Aunty May's. It's never worked. The needle has always
 been stuck halfway between rain and drizzle.

>fix barometer

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to derek

 To engage in a conversation, try to ASK Derek ABOUT something, TELL
 Derek ABOUT something, or SHOW Derek something. Or, even, try saying
 "hello". Once you are chatting, you can just use "ASK ABOUT
 something", or if you are feeling confident, as a short hand, just "A
 something". You could also ask Derek to do things using: Derek, GO
 SOUTH for example.

>hit barometer

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>ask derek about work

 "Hi," you say.

 "Hmm?" he replies non-commitally, his eyes not leaving the TV.

 "How was work?" you ask.

 Derek shrugs. "It was ok. Nothing exciting to report."

>tell derek about may

 When you first told Derek about Aunt May being shipped off to a home,
 he had been furious. "Why didn't you tell me," he had said, barely
 containing his anger. "She could have come and lived with us. You know
 you would have liked that. You and May have always got along."

 "I thought you would have been against it," you had said, weakly.

 Derek had sighed. "Don't put this on me." You haven't really spoken
 about it since, and Derek looks so tired you're too nervous to bring
 it up again.

>ask derek about move

 "Are you looking forward to moving?" you ask.

 "It will be nice to get out of this place and start afresh," says
 Derek. "We need to hurry up with the packing though. The movers will
 be here next Tuesday."

>initiate the sexytimes with Derek

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tell derek about projector

 You start to tell Derek about the white room, and the plinth and the
 projector. But something holds you back. You realise you don't want
 to. That this is somehow too private to share with this man, even
 though you've been married all these years.

 Derek switches over the channel.

>ask derek about supper

 Derek doesn't respond, but continues to watch the TV.

>ask derek about food

 "You need to go to the supermarket tomorrow," you remind him. Derek
 grunts in acknowledgement.

>ask derek about bagel

 Derek doesn't respond, but continues to watch the TV.

>help

>tomorrow

 In your dreams, you are running towards something, but it is
 constantly moving away from you. There is a hand reaching out, but it
 is just out of reach and someone is calling you but you can't quite
 make out if it is a child or just the wind blowing through a partially
 open window.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Tuesday</span>

 The morning has disappeared. You don't know where it went. The house
 continues its inexorable growth. Earlier, when you were dusting the
 upstairs hallway it seemed to take so much longer than usual, and a
 new door had appeared through which you were sure you could hear muted
 voices.

 Actually, you had woken late, and, slightly disoriented by the
 brightness of the morning, it had taken you a while to get your
 bearings. The phone had been ringing. You lay in bed and let it go to
 answer phone.

 As you drifted in and out of a doze, you listened to Aunt May
 pottering about the house. She tends to rise early. Ever since she
 moved in, each morning, you lie in bed listening to her moving about.
 It's comforting somehow, and, with Derek working so many hours, it's
 been nice to have someone to share the last days in the house with.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is due an update - it feels very seventies, with a faux
 marble worktop, dark wood-effect cupboards and garish tiling. The
 refrigerator is covered in scraps of paper and bills, all held in
 place by magnetic capital letters. The back door leads out of the east
 wall into the garden.


 A calendar on the wall shows a grid of boxes for the month, all
 covered in small handwriting.

 On the refrigerator is a yellow post-it note.

 The clock on the wall ticks the seconds away into the air.


 Today, you need to give the removals company a call in the morning to
 confirm the time for next Tuesday.


>examine calendar

 Today, you need to give the removals company a call in the morning to

 On the map, you see the upstairs hallway seems to have grown longer,
 and, in the middle of it is a new door leading north.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 All the bric-a-brac on the sideboard has been packed away for the
 move, leaving only dusty imprints on the wood. It had been filled with
 colourful plates and cups and seldom-used cookery books and odds and
 ends that the family had brought back from various holidays that
 couldn't find another home. Now the brown boxes on the floor and
 table, taped and anonymous, only serve to remind you of how much there
 is left to do before the removal van arrives next week. The pile of
 boxes seems to be higher than yesterday, but that's ok, because the
 room seems to have grown to accommodate them.


 On a plinth in the corner, a rubber plant brushes the ceiling.

>examine plant

 Since being moved into the sunlight of the dining room, the plant
 seems to have had a new lease on life. Its leaves stretch above your
 head, oriented toward the warming sun through the window.


 It was Aunt May's doing, moving the plant into the dining room. As
 soon as she had seen it on the upstairs hallway, she had cried out in
 horror and insisted that you move it immediately. Derek wasn't too
 happy. He doesn't like clutter. But you have to admit, in the
 sunshine, the plant transforms a little. Leaves that were dull greyish
 green suddenly sparkle in the sun. You could almost imagine it sighing
 with relief.

>climb plant

 You don't think the branches would support your weight.

>examine boxes

 The boxes are taped shut and give no clue as to what is inside them.

>open boxes

 They are securely taped shut and there's nothing in there that you
 really want to have to pack again.

 In the distance, you can hear the phone ringing.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance Hall</span>
 The glassed front door leads directly south onto the driveway, and
 carpeted stairs angle up to the first floor. Doors lead east to the
 lounge and the dining room to the north. The room is bare except for
 an occasional table next to the front door in the southern wall, on
 which the telephone and answering machine squat.


 The display on the answering machine flashes with the number 1.


 You hear noises coming from the room above. Aunt May keeps
 unconventional hours. Sometimes you will hear her moving about the
 house in the early hours of the morning. Some days she stays in bed
 till lunchtime and the house remains quiet. Most days, she stays in
 her room, sitting in her chair and watching through the window. Her
 presence is comforting somehow, and you know you can always pop in and
 have someone to talk to.


 The phone on the hall table rings insistently.

 The phone stops ringing.

>answer phone

 The telephone isn't ringing right now.

>push button

 You take the play messages button, but there's really nothing you want
 to do with it, so you put it back where it was.

>listen to answer phone

 You can't see any such thing.


 A briskly impersonal voice says "Hi, Mrs Paterson?" There is a pause.
 "It's Churchill's removals, you were going to call to arrange a time
 for pick up on Tuesday. Can you give us a call please and ask to speak
 to Karen. Thank you."


 The machine whirrs on to the next message.

 Derek's voice, made small by distance, says "Hi Elaine, it's me. I
 just got a call at the office from the removals people. I guess you
 forgot to ring them. I told them to turn up at about 10 am on Tuesday.
 See you tomorrow night."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway has no windows. It's always been a dingy place when the
 doors to the bedrooms are closed, but the open door allows some light
 to creep in. Pictures line the walls, barely illuminated. To the south
 of you is Aunt May's room, opposite it, Brady's room and the hallway
 stretches toward the east side of the house. A flight of stairs leads
 down into the entrance hall, and the new white door hangs open next to
 the staircase to the west.


>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway stretches endlessly from east to west through the house.
 The blank white walls are broken only by a door to the north.


 You can hear voices, low and muted,  coming through the  door.


>go north

 As you walk through the entrance, the air seems to <span class="floydstyle em">shimmer</span>
 somehow.

 You recognise this place. It's been months since you were here, but
 this is where you brought Samantha after she had told you. There she
 is, sat in the same chair, shoulders sagging sullenly, face turned
 away from you, chin in her hand. She looks so young.

 (first opening the reception door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Waiting Room</span>
 The reception area is painted a clinical light green and smells of
 disinfectant. Rows of chairs line the walls. A reception desk in the
 corner hold pamphlets and leaflets. The only other door apart from the
 one back into your house is in the opposite wall.


 You pause at the entrance for a moment. The only sounds in the room
 are the clicking heels of the nurse behind the reception desk. The
 cold air in the room makes you shiver.


 The receptionist stands behind the desk staring out into space.

 Samantha sits quietly on one of the chairs. She barely glances up at
 you as you enter the room.

 At first, Samantha had not wanted you to come. Sat at the dining room
 table, she had hid her face behind her hair when she told you. "I've
 got an appointment at the Doctor's," she had said. "I guess you won't
 be coming."

 But you had surprised yourself. "Of course I'm coming," you had
 replied. "You're not keeping it," you said, before you had even
 thought what that would mean. The words had come directly out of you,
 an unintended accusation.

 Samantha's head had jerked upwards. "It's my baby," she said, "I'll do
 what I want."

 The Doctor had been kind, if a little distant. Samantha had trembled
 next to you while he outlined her options, each more distressing than
 the last. When he had asked her what she wanted to do, Samantha, her
 face white and close to tears, had not replied. She had turned to look
 at you, her eyes beseeching you to answer for her. "What do you think,
 Mum?" she had said. You hadn't replied straight away.

>ask Sam about baby

 "Hey, Sam," you say.

 "Yeah?" replies Sam.

 "When did you know?" you say.

 "I suppose I guessed when I took the pregnancy test," replies Sam,
 sarcastically. You restrain the urge to shout at her. There's so many
 things you could say.

 Samantha sighs with irritation and rubs her face.

 "What do you think, Mrs. Paterson?" the doctor had asked you,
 eventually. "This is Samantha's decision, but I'm sure she would like
 your guidance and support."

 You had answered him. Samantha had burst into tears and ran from the
 room.

 It's my choice," Samantha had screamed in the car on the way home. And
 then she had left. Gone to live with her boyfriend. When Derek had
 come home, you had hesitantly told him about Sam's condition, and the
 row. Derek had been furious. Not about the pregnancy, that he had
 accepted without comment. He had been furious with her because she had
 left home. "Of course we would have supported her," he had said.
 "Whatever she decided."

 You had kept quiet.

 The receptionist stands behind the desk writing something down.

 Samantha sits quietly on one of the chairs.

 "Miss Paterson?" the receptionist says, brightly, interrupting your
 train of thought. "Doctor Bridge will see you now."

 Samantha glances in your direction, gets up unwillingly from the chair
 and walks slowly into the Doctor's office.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">White Room</span>
 The walls and floor seem to glow, as if lit by something inside the
 very fabric of the building. The only exit is back out to the hallway
 to the east.

 In the centre of the room, an old fashioned movie projector sits atop
 a plinth.

>turn on projector

 The projector crackles to life, the reels beginning to whirr and spin.
 On the wall opposite the door, silently, a white square of projected
 light appears.

 The picture coarsens and then slips into focus. Aunty May is sitting
 in a featureless bedroom staring out of the window. As you watch, a
 nurse comes into the room and puts a tray down on the table next to
 her. Aunt May doesn't turn her head.

 The film ends, to be replaced with crackles and dashes of visual
 noise. There is a clatter from the projector, and then a high speed
 whirring as it rewinds itself to the beginning. With a click, the
 white square disappears as the projector switches off.

 place by magnetic capital letters. The back door leads out of the east

 (first opening the back door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden</span>
 High fences surround the garden, giving it an air of privacy,
 sheltered from the street and any watchful eyes peeping from behind
 curtains in the neighbour's windows. A small patio area, attached to
 the side of the house, on which is a table and a set of peeling wooden
 chairs gives way to scrubby grass that you haven't quite got around to
 cutting for far too long.


 When Aunt May arrived, she had taken one look at the garden and given
 a gasp of horror. "You used to like gardening," she had said, shaking
 her head. "We've got to get this sorted out."

 "There's no point, Aunt May," you had replied. "We're moving soon."

 Aunt May had looked at you shrewdly. "Hmmm...." she had said, "We'll
 see. This new house of yours, does it actually have a garden?"

 "Not really," you had said.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lounge</span>
 Sometimes you think this room is made entirely from memories: the
 picture of your daughter, staring defiantly at the camera, flanked by
 the peaks of mountains; the wood paneling, a forgotten texture below
 the bookshelves; the books themselves, all green and blue leather -
 alphabetised soldier-sentries; a balding sofa and chair where Derek
 spends most of his evenings staring at the TV mounted to the wall.
 The too-small window overlooks the front driveway and lets in only
 just enough light, especially now the room is so much larger.


>examine barometer

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine books

 Derek joined a book club. It sent him one blue leather bound classic
 per month for two years. Then it sent him one green bound work by
 Dickens. Now it's sending him red bound works by authors in their
 "American Masters" series. Neither he nor you have every actually read
 one, although you did start "Little Dorrit" once. The text was so
 small and dense though you kept drifting off to sleep and reading the
 same paragraph over and over again.

 Your Aunt has put her chair in front of the window where she can watch

 wall alongside the grandfather clock that ticks time away in its deep
 voice. On the other side of the room is the dresser, weighed down with
 glass ornaments. Pictures cover most of the walls.

 When Aunt May moved in, somehow you managed to squeeze all her things
 into the room. Fortunately, the room has expanded to accept them.


 Aunt May sits in her chair, hands folded quietly in her lap, staring
 out of the window.

>ask may about garden

 "Hi, Aunt May," you say.

 "Yes, dear?" she asks.

 You remember when you used to visit Aunt May years ago. You always
 took away a bag of home gown vegetables. The kids complained in the
 car on the way home, knowing that for the next few days, there would
 always be something green on their plate. "I used to like growing my
 vegetables," says Aunt May. "Frozen veg just aren't the same."

>ask may about derek

 "He never seems to have much time these days," you say. "It's like
 he's avoiding being at home."

 "Don't you worry, love, he's always loved you deep down." Aunt May
 shakes her head. "It's a funny thing, isn't it. The more you love
 them, the further away they seem to get."

>ask may about samantha

 "Sam..." you begin, but it's still too raw.

 Aunt May looks at you and smiles sadly, "Children are hard, aren't
 they? I never had any, but I watched over your aunties and your mother
 growing up and they never stopped breaking my heart."

>ask may about baby

 Aunt May doesn't respond. She just shakes her head slightly and purses
 her lips.

 Aunt May shifts in her seat, and clasps her hands in her lap.

>ask may about projector

 You tell Aunt May about the white room, and about the plinth and the
 projector. She looks out of the window for a while, as if deep in
 thought. "I don't know what they are," she says, "but it sounds like
 there's something that can be changed. It sounds like the past is not
 always as fixed as you might think."

>ask may about rubber plant

 "It's still not doing well," you say, "the rubber plant I bought. Do
 you remember?"

 "I did tell you to put somewhere more sunny," responds Aunt May, a
 little acidly. "They like sun on their leaves, a ficus."

>ask may about may

 "I said I'm fine."

 Aunt May sighs heavily.

>ask may about me

 "You look nice, love."

>ask may about removals

 Aunt May doesn't respond. She just shakes her head slightly and purses
 her lips.

 A brief history of your maternal family tree. Uncles and aunts you
 have a passing acquaintance with mingle with more distant relatives.
 Dotted here and there are Monet prints. Your Aunt May loved Monet.

 Aunt May turns her head slightly to look up the street, but you can't
 see what she is looking at.

>examine clock

 Aunt May has had this clock forever. Its tick is like a constant note
 in your life.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway has no windows. It's always been a dingy place when the
 doors to the bedrooms are closed, but the open door allows some light
 to creep in. Pictures line the walls, barely illuminated. To the south
 of you is Aunt May's room, opposite it, Brady's room and the hallway
 stretches toward the east side of the house. A flight of stairs leads
 down into the entrance hall, and the new white door hangs open next to
 the staircase to the west.


>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway stretches endlessly from east to west through the house.
 The blank white walls are broken only by a door to the north.


 You can hear voices coming through the open door.


>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Away from the faint light from the stairwell, the hall is darker, and
 the pictures that continue to line the walls are more indistinct. A
 little more light spills in from the open door. The door in the north
 wall leads to Samantha's room, opposite it, your and Derek's room, and
 the hallway stretches to the west. It seems to be so much longer than
 yesterday. To the east, a doorway leads into the bathroom.


>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Bedroom</span>
 This has always been your favourite room. The large south facing
 window lets in plenty of light which makes it brighter than the rest
 of the house. However, over the last couple of days, the wooden floor
 has stretched, each pine tile becoming larger and the two single beds
 that used to be separated by the width of the small table are now
 several paces apart. Your dressing table, loaded with detritus, is
 under the window and a wardrobe in the corner partially obscures a new
 passageway that leads out of the eastern side of the house.


>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Short Corridor</span>
 The old clock in the corner punctuates the seconds with its deep bass
 ticking. All the pictures are still on the wall - lined up ancestors
 and forgotten relatives mixing with cheap reproductions of Monet's
 landscapes. A musty old sofa against the wall is lit up by the one
 window. A door to the south leads into your Aunt's front room.

 The room feels empty somehow, as if all the life in it has drained
 away.


>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aunt May's Front Room</span>
 Despite her age, Aunt May keeps her home spotlessly clean. The window
 allows her to watch the comings and goings in the street from her
 strategically positioned armchair. An old dresser holds brass
 ornaments and a selection of glass flowers. The only door leads back
 out into the hallway.

 The room feels empty somehow, as if all the life in it has been used
 up.


>examine dresser

 You can't see any such thing.

>search table

 Which do you mean, the small table or the dressing table?

>dressing

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine small table

 You bought this a couple of months ago when you got the new beds. Now
 both you and Derek have a reading lamp. Derek likes to read late
 sometimes and at least now the light doesn't spill directly into your
 eyes.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Waiting Room</span>
 The reception area is painted a clinical light green and smells of
 disinfectant. Rows of chairs line the walls. A reception desk in the
 corner hold pamphlets and leaflets. The only other door apart from the
 one back into your house is in the opposite wall.


 The receptionist stands behind the desk sorting through some
 paperwork.

>ask receptionist about samantha

 "Hi," you say.

 "How can I help you?" replies the receptionist.

 "The doctor will see you soon," says the receptionist, and smiles
 without showing her teeth. "I'm sure you can discuss any issues with
 him." She turns away.

>examine pamphlets

 Glossy brochures with titles like "Is Adoption for You?" or "You and
 Your Baby".

>wait an hour

 I only understood you as far as wanting to wait.

>time

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask receptionist about time

 The receptionist smiles at you, but doesn't respond. She just goes
 back to her work.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aunt May's Room</span>
 Your Aunt has put her chair in front of the window where she can watch
 the comings and going of your neighbours. Her old sofa is against one
 wall alongside the grandfather clock that ticks time away in its deep
 voice. On the other side of the room is the dresser, weighed down with
 glass ornaments. Pictures cover most of the walls.

 Aunt May sits in her chair, hands folded quietly in her lap, staring
 out of the window.

 Aunt May coughs, and dabs at her lips with a small handkerchief.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brady's Room</span>
 The posters on the wall, reminders of winning sports teams and fading
 rock bands, are further apart than yesterday, as though spaced out and
 shifted by some unseen hand, showing acres of cream wallpaper. The
 bed, stripped of sheets, is only a textured mattress, the desk, piled
 with hockey trophies from his schooldays. Grey light from the window
 filters into the hallway behind you.


 Still no word from Brady. You had hoped that when the phone rang this
 morning, it was him and it would have been his voice on the answering
 machine. It was still too hard to actually pick up the phone though -
 that's why you stayed in bed. Just a message on the machine would have
 been enough.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance Hall</span>
 The glassed front door leads directly south onto the driveway, and
 carpeted stairs angle up to the first floor. Doors lead east to the
 lounge and the dining room to the north. The room is bare except for
 an occasional table next to the front door in the southern wall, on
 which the telephone and answering machine squat.


>go south

 (first opening the front door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Driveway</span>
 Bounded by small grass borders that, via some unseen line down the
 middle, demarcate your house from the next, the driveway stretches out
 onto the road to the south. The open plan nature of the street is
 disconcerting.

 Your car is parked here.


>close door

 You close the front door.

>go south

 The street is too open. There are too many eyes - all those blank
 windows reflecting and multiplying the world. Even thinking about
 passing the end of the driveway makes you feel uncomfortable. It's as
 if, unbounded by anything solid, all that space is too big to endure.
 It might dissipate you entirely.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 All the bric-a-brac on the sideboard has been packed away for the
 move, leaving only dusty imprints on the wood. It had been filled with
 colourful plates and cups and seldom-used cookery books and odds and
 ends that the family had brought back from various holidays that
 couldn't find another home. Now the brown boxes on the floor and
 table, taped and anonymous, only serve to remind you of how much there
 is left to do before the removal van arrives next week. The pile of
 boxes seems to be higher than yesterday, but that's ok, because the
 room seems to have grown to accommodate them.


 On a plinth in the corner, a rubber plant brushes the ceiling.

>dust plant

 You rub the Rubber Plant.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is due an update - it feels very seventies, with a faux
 marble worktop, dark wood-effect cupboards and garish tiling. The
 refrigerator is covered in scraps of paper and bills, all held in
 place by magnetic capital letters. The back door leads out of the east
 wall into the garden.


 A calendar on the wall shows a grid of boxes for the month, all
 covered in small handwriting.

 On the refrigerator is a yellow post-it note.

 The clock on the wall ticks the seconds away into the air.

>open fridge

 The mostly empty shelves remind you that you need to tell Derek to go
 to the supermarket on his way home from work tomorrow. When you let go
 of the handle, the fridge door closes by itself.

>examine clock

 The clock reads 5:18 pm.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lounge</span>
 Sometimes you think this room is made entirely from memories: the
 picture of your daughter, staring defiantly at the camera, flanked by
 the peaks of mountains; the wood paneling, a forgotten texture below
 the bookshelves; the books themselves, all green and blue leather -
 alphabetised soldier-sentries; a balding sofa and chair where Derek
 spends most of his evenings staring at the TV mounted to the wall.
 The too-small window overlooks the front driveway and lets in only
 just enough light, especially now the room is so much larger.


>turn on tv

 You switch the TV on.

>watch tv

 A large flat screen attached to the wall opposite the window. Derek
 insisted on getting the largest. It is switched on, and an
 advertisement desperately tries to gain your attention.
