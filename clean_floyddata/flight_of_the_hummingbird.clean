 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 December 31st, 2014.

 Dr. Sinister is at it again! The Concordance of Powered Response isn't
 entirely clear on what it is he's planning, but it's big and it's
 based in his island fortress. This is clearly a task for one of the
 world's mightiest champions!

 Unfortunately, they've had to send you instead; the world's mightiest
 champions have other emergencies to deal with. New Year's Eve is
 always rough.

 Regardless, this looks by-the-book so far. The containment fields have
 been put in place. Now all you have to do is get over to his island
 base, infiltrate it, defeat him, and bring him in.

 Flight of the Hummingbird
 An Interactive Costumed Caper by Michael Martin
 Release 2 / Serial number 110101 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)
 [Type ABOUT for information unique to this game, even if you've played
 Interactive Fiction before.]

 Shalestorm Shingle
 City Hall teleported you here to Shalestorm Shingle mainly for the
 drama of the name. Small rocks and stones litter the ground here, but
 it dissolves to good clean sand a little ways to the south.

 The city's containment force fields wall off the area to the north and
 east. The great Pacific Ocean stretches out to the west. Across the
 sea some distance, you can see Dr. Sinister's island fortress.

 This game will occasionally put critical information in the status
 line by default. If you are using a restricted interpreter that cannot
 render status lines, the command STATUS ON will cause this data to
 instead be dumped to the main window every turn that it is relevant.
 This can be ugly, however, and so it may also be disabled with the
 command STATUS OFF.

 As more special commands become available, this section will expand to
 keep a record of them.

>status on
 FLIGHT OF THE HUMMINGBIRD will now dump important information to the
 main window instead of leaving it in the status line like usual. To
 restore default behavior, enter the command STATUS OFF.

>examine ocean
 The seas look deceptively quiet, but they nevertheless unnerve you.

>examine sand
 The sand on this beach is dark and gritty, no doubt ground down from
 the rocks to the north.

>examine fortress
 It juts out of the island to the west, probably reaching at least a
 hundred feet into the air.

>examine me
 You are The Hummingbird. Not really the kind of totemic resonance that
 lets you play in the really big leagues, but you've managed a bit of
 recognition, and a lot of the other heroes give you credit for coming
 by your powers the hard way.

 Your Hummingbird Suit lets you, when suitably charged up, flap your
 arms fast enough to actually maintain flight. You've got to have a lot
 of energy available to do that, of course, but you can still manage
 it.

 You're particularly proud of the fact that unlike most of your heroic
 comrades-in-arms, you have a proper excuse for your ridiculously
 overdeveloped pectoral muscles.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   the HummingBelt (being worn)
     an energy drink

>examine belt
 This is a masterpiece of engineering, built to your specifications. It
 lets you carry an enormous amount of stuff without unbalancing your
 flight at all.

>examine energy drink
 This drink is an incredibly powerful concoction of sugar and
 electrolytes. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that it is the
 source of all your power. Given the energy contained within it, the
 properties of your suit, and your superhuman pectorals, you can fly
 and even hover under your own power.

 You only need a small amount to activate your powers, so this canteen
 has more than enough to keep you supplied for the duration of the
 mission.

>take rock
 You don't need any rocks.

>go south

 Sable Strand
 The rocky beach from the north tapers off a bit; down here, closer to
 the water, the rocks have been worn down to black sand. To the west is
 the ocean itself (and beyond that, Sinister's island fortress); the
 sand gives way to concrete to the south.

>get sand
 You don't need any sand.

>go south

 Shattered Shack
 The containment field makes a sharp turn here, blocking travel to the
 south as well as the east. Metallic wreckage is strewn throughout this
 corner of the beach. Possibly this is the work of Dr. Sinister on his
 latest rampage, but you suspect that this is actually what's left of
 some innocent building torn apart by the creation of the containment
 field.

 The coastline extends to the north, while the Pacific Ocean lies to
 the west. You can also make out Dr. Sinister's island fortress out at
 sea.

 An enormous rumbling noise comes from the tower on the island. You
 cover your eyes as the shockwave hits, and as you recover, you see a
 rocket streaking up towards the sky.

 You think you can hear Dr. Sinister's malicious laughter, but it's
 surely just a trick of the wind. He's far too far away to be audible.

 Great. Well, hopefully you'll still be able to thwart him with what's
 left in the base.

>examine wreckage
 It's a pile of metal beams, once an innocent building.

>search wreckage
 You select a small, crowbar-like piece of metal, and pick it up.

>go west
 Water isn't particularly good for your suit. Besides, Dr. Sinister has
 an ugly penchant for genetically engineering nasty sea life.

>drink drink
 (first taking the energy drink)
 (first stowing the crowbar)
 You take a quick swig of your mighty energy drink and are charged with
 unbelievable energy. You quickly re-stow the drink and begin to flap
 your arms with all your might.

 [Now that you've charged up, you may start or stop flying with FLY or
 LAND. You may change your altitude with UP and DOWN as usual.]

 [Your altitude will be marked in the status line at the top of the
 screen, and in the main text with brackets after each turn. If you
 would rather restrict this information to the status line, keeping the
 main text less cluttered, the command STATUS OFF will do so.]

 [You are flying.]

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>go west
 You fly off the shore and out to sea.

 Above the Ocean (skimming the waves)
 The sea extends in all directions. An island lies a good distance to
 the west, while the main shore is just to the east.

 [You are skimming the waves.]

>go west

 Above the Ocean (skimming the waves)
 The sea extends in all directions. An island lies a good distance to
 the west, while the main shore is a bit to the east.

 Your energy is beginning to flag. Below you, you think you catch sight
 of a green fin breaking the waves, and some larger things lurking in
 the deeps.

 Looks like the Doctor has been modifying the local sea life. At least
 it isn't a synthetic plague of poisonous frogs like the last time he
 made headlines.

 Flapping your arms mightily, you ascend.

 Your energy fails you, and your old nemesis gravity reasserts his
 dominance.

 [You are 25 feet and falling.]

>drink drink
 (first taking the energy drink)
 Your recharge didn't have quite enough altitude to work in, so you hit
 the water at great speed. At this height it's only slightly less
 resilient than concrete, really.

 Well, at least that means you don't have to worry about drowning.



     *** You are a shooting star ***


 In that game you scored 2 out of a possible 50, in 24 turns, earning
 you the rank of Wild Talent.

 You seem to have had a flight mishap. These are rather severe; a
 single UNDO is unlikely to put you in a position where you can
 continue. Two, however, should usually suffice for a safe landing, and
 three should guarantee you a survivable option in even the most
 extreme of circumstances.

 Sinister Isle Shore (50 feet above the ground)
 This is the southernmost reach of Sinister Isle's shoreline reachable

 the north, while the island itself spreads off to the west. Dr.
 Sinister's enormous tower awaits you to the northwest.

 You settle back to earth, your energy exhausted.

 Finally. Man, that was a pain. One of these days you're going to have
 to get one of those hats with the drink holders and the long straws.

 As you catch your breath, you hear a soft chime. The Coalition wants
 to talk.

 You activate the communicator in your Hummingbird suit. "Hummingbird
 here. I'm on the island, but there's been a complication."

 The voice on the other end is half frantic. "We had no idea Sinister
 was space capable! We've been tracking his rocket since launch, and
 have found both him and the base he's flying to. North American Space
 Command is ready to scramble a full set of LEO hunter-killer drones.
 Incidentally, don't even try to get to the island - it's out of your
 range and he's probably infested the waters."

 [1] "Beyond my range?"
 [2] "Way to warn me in advance, guys - I'm on the island now."

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>1
 "You may want to update that profile. I'm on the island now."

 "What? But..."

 "Later. For now..."

 [1] "We don't have the full story yet. I'm going to investigate."
 [2] "I'm not willing to let NASC kill everyone unless it's our last
 option."
 [3] "Have NASC take the shot. It's the only way to be sure."

>1
 "...for now, you're all going off half-cocked. We've seen a rocket
 launch. That might be the Doctor. It might be the key to his plan. It
 might be part of it. It might be a feint to throw us off the scent.
 I'm here, so I'm going to see what's going on."

 "Fair enough, Hummingbird. We'll tell NASC to stand by until we know
 more. We'll be in touch later."

>look
 Sinister Isle Shore

 the north, while the island itself spreads off to the west. Dr.
 Sinister's enormous tower awaits you to the northwest.

>go north

 Sinister Isle Shore
 The shore of Sinister Isle continues to the north and south from here,
 while the Doctor's imposing tower stands directly to the west.

>go north

 Sinister Isle Shore
 Sinister Isle's beach is full of sparkling sand, and would make an
 excellent vacation spot were it not for the enormous tower of doom to
 the southwest. The shore continues for some distance to the south,
 while the containment fields prevent further travel north. The island
 itself continues off to the west.

>examine sand
 Unlike the black, gritty sand on the mainland, this island's shoreline
 is full of sparkling sand only a few shades off from white. It would
 make an excellent vacation spot, if you discount the whole Evil Lair
 thing.

>taste sand
 That sounds vaguely unsanitary.

>go west

 Sinister Isle
 Dr. Sinister may be evil, but he's obviously not part of the desolate
 and blasted stronghold school. West of the sparkling sands of this
 beach, the island shifts over to verdant fields. It's also clear that
 he or his minions take good care of it; the grass around here is so
 well-kept it could practically be a lawn.

 The massive main door of the tower is to the south, and a path cut out
 of the grass leads from it off to the west.

>examine lawn
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine grass
 A path is cut into the grass, leading in a neat path around the tower.
 You suppose even evil masterminds appreciate the occasional bit of
 good landscaping.

 Sinister Isle
 The force field shifts direction here, forming the northwest corner of
 the containment zone. The tower itself is off to the southeast.

 A path is cut into the grass leading south and east.

>search grass
 You find nothing of interest.

 Sinister Isle
 The tower of Dr. Sinister stands proudly to the east of here, its grey
 bulk left a bit greenish by the glow of the containment fields to the
 west.

 A path leads from north to south around the tower.

 Sinister Isle
 The containment fields block you from moving any further to the south
 or west here, while the tower rises to the northeast. A neatly-trimmed
 path cut into the grass here leads north and east.

 A fuel truck sits quietly on the path here. Good to see the Doctor
 didn't destroy all his supplies when he left.

>examine containment field
 In the interests of containing the forces of villainy, the local
 authorities have surrounded the area with impenetrable green force
 walls. It should go down once you get your man.

>examine truck
 This truck looks like it's been around for awhile, but it's got the
 distinctive shape of a fuel truck. A hose is attached to the tanks on
 the back.

 Sinister Isle
 Dr. Sinister clearly doesn't follow the usual rules for evil
 strongholds. His evil tower is on a lovely coastline and is surrounded
 on all other sides by well-kept grass. This section of the island
 could almost be a lawn.

 The tower is to the north of you, and the containment fields block you
 to the south. A path cut out of the grass leads east to the beach and
 west to the rest of the island.

 You'll be landing faster than you'd like soon enough, unless you do

 After a long fall with no power, you slam into the ground at
 incredible speed. Though you do have superhuman strength, it doesn't
 translate into resistance to that kind of damage.

 You climb down into Dr. Sinister's island tower.

 Hangar Catwalk
 You're standing on a narrow catwalk ringing a vast hangar. To the west
 is an airlock leading into a bright yellow rocket that fills most of
 the area. A ladder leads both up through the ceiling, and down to the
 floor of the hangar proper. The roof forms a dome about 30 feet above
 your head. You could also easily take off from here, if you were so

 Most of the roof is curved into a retractable dome, except for the
 access path ringing the roof.

>go down
 You once again infiltrate the Doctor's compound.

 Hangar Catwalk
 You're standing on a narrow catwalk ringing a vast hangar. To the west
 is an airlock leading into a bright yellow rocket that fills most of
 the area. A ladder leads both up through the ceiling, and down to the
 floor of the hangar proper. The roof forms a dome about 30 feet above
 your head. You could also easily take off from here, if you were so
 inclined.

 A small round access hatch stands open on the ceiling, leading up and
 out of the tower.

>examine hangar

>shake tush

>go down

 Hangar
 This enormous hangar appears to take up nearly all the space in this
 tower-or, at least, the space in the tower that's above the ground.
 Most of the space in the hangar is taken up by an enormous, yellow,
 finned rocket. A catwalk far above leads into it.

 A ladder leads up to the catwalk, and then further up to provide roof
 access. The roof itself looks quite solid, and you don't expect that
 rocket will be able to launch through it as-is.

 A hallway large enough to pass a freight train leads off to the south,
 to some kind of staging area.

>go south

 Staging Area
 This large area looks like it was once central to Dr. Sinister's
 operations. However, any signs of his plots based here have been
 removed. There hasn't been much time for dust to accumulate, either;
 he must have been expecting to leave this base behind.

 You suppress an involuntary but unheroic shudder. If he was willing to
 abandon an entire base to further his plot, it must be a big one.

 This area continues off to the east, and narrows considerably to the
 west. The rocket hangar lies through the huge archway to the north.

 You can't go that way.

 Minions' Chambers
 The base continues from east to west. This area looks like a barracks;
 rows and rows of empty bunk beds line the halls. This must be where
 his minions slept when they weren't on-duty.

 To the west you can see a fancy desk. Looks like the boss had an
 open-door policy.

>examine beds
 At this point they're just an array of hard mattresses.

>look under beds
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine desk
 You can only see part of it from here, but it's pretty imposing even
 from this distance.

>go west

 Dr. Sinister's Office
 This luxurious office must be where Dr. Sinister spends most of his
 time scheming. A huge mahogany desk takes up most of the west side of
 the room, and behind it is a tall, black leather chair. A smaller door
 hides behind it. The rest of the base lies to the east.

>examine desk
 It would look out of place anywhere else in the base, but here, it
 provides an excellent sense of power and control. The right-hand side
 of it includes a small drawer, easily accessible whether or not one is
 seated in the chair.

>open drawer
 As you open the desk, you barely get a glimpse of its contents - a
 silver key - before the floor opens up beneath you, revealing a vast
 pit below!

 You drop like a rock.

 Pit Trap (175 feet and falling)
 This pit trap is almost two hundred feet deep, and surrounded by
 smooth walls on all sides. Nevertheless, the bottom seems mostly
 clean. Perhaps he has some means of flushing it out - or maybe it's
 just never been used to dispose of anyone.

 Down at the bottom of the pit you can see a wooden crate and a
 large-handled key.

 You make an undignified crash as the pit trap's floor does what it was
 designed to do - be solid and a long way down.



     *** You've fallen for the oldest trick in the book ***


 In that game you scored 10 out of a possible 50, in 135 turns, earning
 you the rank of Third-String Hero.

 You seem to have had a flight mishap. These are rather severe; a
 single UNDO is unlikely to put you in a position where you can
 continue. Two, however, should usually suffice for a safe landing, and
 three should guarantee you a survivable option in even the most
 extreme of circumstances.

 Dr. Sinister's Office (flying)
 This luxurious office must be where Dr. Sinister spends most of his
 time scheming. A huge mahogany desk takes up most of the west side of
 the room, and behind it is a tall, black leather chair. A smaller door
 hides behind it. The rest of the base lies to the east.

 Most of the floor is gone at the moment, revealing an ominous pit that
 leads down a good distance. At the bottom you can just make out a
 wooden crate. Someone standing could still walk to either door,
 though.

 You settle down on one of the few safe spots in the room.

 In the small drawer is a silver key.

 Command Center
 Dr. Sinister seems to have found an interesting solution to the
 problem of maintaining operational security: he has placed his master
 command center in his bedroom. A surprisingly humble bed sits off
 against the south wall, while an impressive command terminal full of
 controls and displays occupies most of the opposite one. The Doctor's
 office lies back to the east.

>pull bed
 It is fixed in place.

>examine terminal
 The terminal's displays are all dark. Beneath the displays, you note
 that the defense grid switch and the launch hatch switch are on, and

 There is also a button marked "TRAP TOGGLE".

 It's little more than a cot, really. You wonder if he sleeps here
 normally, or if this was just for the occasional all-nighter. It
 certainly doesn't match up with the ostentation out in the main
 office.

 You've got vastly more important things to be doing.

>examine south wall
 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine south.

>turn on power
 (not first getting out of the bed - Dr. Sinister clearly has his
 priorities straight)
 The displays flicker to life. The old status screen appears
 momentarily - you can just make out the words "POST-LAUNCH SHUTDOWN
 COMPLETE" before they turn to other feeds. The terminal's displays are
 now showing various parts of the base. One view looks at the closed
 bulk of the main gate, while another shows the roof of the hangar
 opening up, revealing the blue sky above. Other images flicker through
 the displays, but the only other one that catches your eye is the grid
 of light starting to flicker to life, sealing off the hangar from the
 main halls.

 This is, in all likelihood, more of an "exit hall" than an "entrance

 after them.

 That does raise the question of how he planned on getting them to the
 mainland, but you suppose that's neither here nor there.

 The huge doors to the north bar your passage.

 Your suit chimes again. "Hummingbird here. Good timing; I've finished

 This large area looks like it was once central to Dr. Sinister's
 operations. However, any signs of his plots based here have been
 removed. There hasn't been much time for dust to accumulate, either;
 he must have been expecting to leave this base behind.

 This area continues off to the east, and narrows considerably to the
 west. The rocket hangar lies through the huge archway to the north.
 However, access to the hangar is currently blocked by a grid of
 shimmering light beams.

 Main Hall
 Colorful tapestries hang on the wall here. Most of them carry the
 series of red slashes that are Dr. Sinister's trademark insignia, but
 a few others show his benevolent face smiling down upon any visitors
 from the main entrance to the north, or perhaps to inspire his troops
 marching out from the west.

 Entrance Hall
 This is, in all likelihood, more of an "exit hall" than an "entrance
 hall." Dr. Sinister is unlikely to be receiving visitors often, and
 this "entrance" is broad enough to let a budding overlord's armies
 march out twenty abreast and still have room to move out vehicles
 after them.

 The huge doors to the north stand open to the island.

 You walk back out into the sunlight.

 Sinister Isle
 Dr. Sinister may be evil, but he's obviously not part of the desolate
 and blasted stronghold school. West of the sparkling sands of this
 beach, the island shifts over to verdant fields. It's also clear that
 he or his minions take good care of it; the grass around here is so
 well-kept it could practically be a lawn.

 The massive main door of the tower is to the south, and a path cut out
 of the grass leads from it off to the west.

 Dr. Sinister seems to have found an interesting solution to the

 Most of the space in the hangar is taken up by an enormous, yellow,
 finned rocket. A catwalk far above leads into it.

 A ladder leads up to the catwalk, and then further up to provide roof
 access. The roof itself looks quite solid, and you don't expect that
 rocket will be able to launch through it as-is.

 A hallway large enough to pass a freight train leads off to the south,

 Dr. Sinister's Tower (flying)
 You're hovering above the top of Dr. Sinister's stronghold. Most of

 ringing the roof. The dome is currently open, revealing the cavernous
 hangar below.

 A small round access hatch stands open, leading down into the tower.

 You settle down on the walkway.

 Hangar Catwalk
 You're standing on a narrow catwalk ringing a vast hangar. To the west
 is an airlock leading into a bright yellow rocket that fills most of
 the area. A ladder leads both up through the ceiling, and down to the
 floor of the hangar proper. Sunlight streams in from the open launch
 hatch, illuminating the entire area. You could also easily take off
 from here, if you were so inclined.

 leads east to the hangar.

>sit

 As you sit in the acceleration chair, a variety of webs and restraints
 affix you to the chair.

>press button
 As you press the launch button, machinery rumbles to life underneath
 you. You hear a chime, and a pleasant genderless voice comes from the
 panel.

 "Good morning, O most worthy overlord. It's too bad that it has become
 necessary to flee your lovely island base. I will be your autopilot
 today. Please sit tight while I take us to your orbital redoubt."

 Well, that's a good sign, at least. You relax a bit while the
 landscape dwindles below you and the sky darkens above you.

 After a few more minutes, the autopilot chimes again. "We're nearly
 here. I've put you into an east-to-west orbit approaching the station,
 but you will have to perform the final approach yourself." The launch
 button recesses into the control panel, and a control stick emerges.
 "I will, as always, keep your orbit stable as you move. Docking arms
 will engage once you are stopped at location (1, 0, 0)."

 Displays bloom around the window, indicating your present position and
 velocity. The station itself is now clearly visible to the west.

 Station Rocketway
 Dr. Sinister's space station seems to be reasonably well put together.
 This extensible walkway fits snugly against your rocket's airlock.
 Since the station is spinning, that direction feels like "down". The
 station proper awaits you up above, towards the center.

 A ladder is just visible up at the top of the chamber.

>go up
 With some trepidation, you work your way up the access tube. The spin
 of the station is not playing well with your sense of balance, and you
 carom off the walls a few times on your way to the top of the chamber.

 But you do make it, and a hand closes on the bottommost rung of the
 ladder. Your weight pulls the ladder down to the bottom of the
 chamber, taking you with it.

>examine ladder
 It looks sturdy, and it takes up most of the rocketway.

>go up
 You climb the ladder confidently, but still, you worry. Your arrival
 was not exactly stealthy, and it can't have gone unnoticed. Where's
 the welcoming committee? You strain your ears listening for ambushes
 or other traps as you ascend into the station proper.

 You're almost relieved when you find four goons waiting for you up
 top.

 They spring into action as soon as you become visible. Fortunately,
 this involves more screaming into headsets and retreating than
 hammering you while you can't fight back.

 "It's the Hummingbird! He's bypassed our teleport blockers and is in
 the Vestibule! Initiating lockdown procedures!"

 They're fast. By the time you pull yourself all the way through the
 hatch, they're gone and the hatches out of this chamber are sealed.

 You pause for a moment to catch your breath and get your bearings.

 Vestibule
 This is actually pretty swank for a space station. Every gram counts
 in rocketry, yet not only has the Doctor lifted up a full set of
 draperies for the walls, the floor here is even carpeted.

 Portholes lead spinward, antispinward, out, and down. All but the down
 porthole are firmly sealed.

 Dr. Sinister's voice crackles over the intercom. "The Hummingbird? I
 invest all this in an island fortress and a space station - a space
 station - and all CPR sees fit to send is the Hummingbird? Pah!"

 Dr. Sinister's voice booms out once again through the public address
 system. "Fall back to the Hub, men; our visitor won't be going
 anywhere, and even if he somehow does, your numbers will be more than
 enough to fight him back until the cannon is charged."

 You sneer inwardly. You're ten times the fighter of any minions the

 corridor continues both spinwards and antispinwards.

 [As you are on a spinning spacecraft, normal compass directions no

 Crew Pod
 Dr. Sinister appears to keep better care of his minions when they're

 the bunks back on the island.

 A doorway leads out to the center of the station, while an access
 hatch leads back down into the corridors.

 [The parser couldn't handle that sentence. Try rephrasing it, or use a

>out
 There's a good fifteen or so unfriendly-looking goons in the hub of
 the station. That's more than you feel comfortable taking on; you'll
 have to do something to diminish their numbers, or at least make them
 less effective.

>look
 Crew Pod
 Dr. Sinister appears to keep better care of his minions when they're
 in outer space. The cots in this crew section look a lot softer than
 the bunks back on the island.

 A doorway leads out to the center of the station, while an access
 hatch leads back down into the corridors.

 You hear some muttering from the guards in the central hub.

 "We've been up for awhile now. Bob, it's your turn to fetch the
 coffee."

 "Roger that."

 You hear some quick movement, then the motion stops as the guards
 return to their normal posts.

>go down
 You duck back into the tunnels.

 Access Corridor, Quadrant 4
 This narrow access tunnel seems to ring the entire station. A small
 sign near a hatch on the ceiling reads "QUADRANT 4: CREW POD". The
 corridor continues both spinwards and antispinwards.

 Access Corridor, Quadrant 3
 This narrow access tunnel seems to ring the entire station. A small
 sign near a hatch on the ceiling reads "QUADRANT 3: RECREATION POD".
 The corridor continues both spinwards and antispinwards.

>in
 You climb back into the starbase's main quarters.

 Recreation Pod
 Dr. Sinister clearly retains a higher class of minion than your normal
 supervillain; this rec room is full of bookcases, with a game console
 in one corner for more interactive pursuits. A kitchen nook with an
 integrated sink and coffeemaker protrudes from the wall opposite the
 books.

 The sink is another hole in the nook with a faucet sprayer extending
 from it. The faucet is flush with the top of the counter, you suppose
 to deal with the fact that the not-quite-gravity might make water
 spray everywhere.

>examine coffeemaker
 This coffee machine is part of the wall itself in the kitchen nook -
 it is a receptacle carved into the wall with a burner at the bottom to
 heat a coffee pot - if that. It looks like the receptacle itself might
 double as the pot.

 You can't actually find where the coffee itself is; the burner is
 obvious, but you can't find where the beans themselves are.

 You duck back into the tunnels.

>go up
 You climb back into the starbase's main quarters.

 Supply Pod
 Dr. Sinister continues to show his maniacal levels of organization.
 This pod is lined with storage lockers packed tightly together and
 with no visible seams. The only gap is the doorway out to the center
 of the station. The way down to the maintenance tunnels is also clear.

 Disrupting the neatness is a crate in the corner labeled
 "COUNTERMEASURES".

>examine countermeasures
 Searching through the crate, you find a platinum-studded rope. Colonel
 Spectacular would be hard-pressed to escape from this.

 Other unidentified items still remain in the crate.

>search crate
 Searching through the crate, you find some vials. They're labeled as
 various bromine compounds. Halogens like these could seriously ruin
 Mr. Mysterious's day.

 A cursory glance doesn't identify anything else, but more
 investigation might help.

>again
 Searching through the crate, you find a box with circuitry you
 recognize as a teleport blocker. If the Coalition of Powered Response
 had sent Star-R-Star, he'd be fighting with his hands tied.

 You put the teleport blocker back in the crate, near some other things
 you haven't checked yet.

 More voices from the hub. "Dave. Coffee. Fast." More motion. Though
 the voice is still quite alert, you can hear the fatigue behind it.

>SAVE

>search countermeasures
 Searching through the crate, you find a tuning fork. You give it an
 experimental strike, and it produces a clean-high note. You recognize
 it immediately as A-880 - the precise tone that shifts the Ethereal
 Wonder into the physical realm.

 You've almost finished completely sorting through the crate.

>search countermeasures
 Searching through the crate, you find some jars full of
 brightly-colored reflective dust. That would negate a lot of
 Justice-Bot's firepower.

 Dr. Sinister was ready for anyone. Well. Anyone but you. He'll pay for
 that oversight.

>hit coffeemaker
 This thing is well-enough integrated into the countertop that you
 can't do much damage to it with your bare hands.

 You are carrying:
   a tuning fork
   a platinum-studded rope
   a teleport blocker
   some vials
   some jars full of brightly-colored reflective dust
   the HummingBelt (being worn)
     some blankets
     some torn curtains
     an energy drink
     a large-handled key
     a crowbar
     a silver key

>pry coffeemaker
 (first taking the crowbar)
 The coffeemaker has no obvious lock to force.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>examine vials
 These vials are labeled neatly - they all seem to be various bromine
 compounds.

>empty vials into coffeemaker
 I only understood you as far as wanting to empty the vials.

>put vials into coffeemaker
 You check through the vials, looking for anything you could safely
 spike the coffee with. You settle on potassium bromide. If you
 remember right, about 40 grams of this spread through the coffeepot
 should slow down that platoon of thugs without permanently harming any
 of them.

 Now you just need to wait for them to get it into their system.

 You tore this off of the curtains in the vestibule. It's about 20
 square feet of cloth.

>out
 You stride into the main hall, where fifteen of Dr. Sinister's finest
 await you. That's well past your comfort zone, but they're not looking
 like they're really in fighting trim.

 However, they're still numerous enough that you cannot battle your way
 through to the central bridge access ladder they guard. You make a
 careful retreat before the situation gets any worse.

 They do not follow.

 That's good for your prospects of survival, at least in the short
 term, but not so great for your long-term prospects of success. You've
 weakened their forces some, but it looks like you'll need to either
 weaken them some more or strengthen yourself to actually break
 through.

 You recharge and start flying.

 [You are flying.]

>out
 You flutter through into the main hall, where fifteen of Dr.
 Sinister's finest await you. That's normally just a tad more than
 you're comfortable facing alone, but they were expecting someone
 coming in on the ground. More fool they. While you'd perhaps hoped to
 just fly over all of them, the spun gravity sends you careening about
 the room like a pinball, whacking and bowling over most of the men
 hoping to ambush you.

 Before the ones left conscious can regroup, you tilt your flight path
 to the central bridge's access ladder.



 Please press SPACE to continue.
>press space








 As you climb, the Hub narrows into a ring-shaped corridor. It's almost
 as if there's some long, thin object running the length of the
 station.

 You recall the Doctor mentioning some kind of beam weapon when you
 first entered the station. You can only hope you aren't...

 ...well, it looks like you aren't too late after all. A display on the
 wall prominently announces "3:47:32 to full beam charge". That more or
 less matches your position over the Pacific when you first docked -
 unless his master plan involves ruining a cruise ship's day, you
 should be able to wrap this up with time to spare.

 You continue your climb to Dr. Sinister's inner sanctum.


 Please press SPACE to continue.








 You tense as you slip into the central bridge, ready for anything. Who
 knows what forces could guard Dr. Sinister's sanctum sanctorum?

 It turns out the answer is "nothing"; there isn't anyone here except
 Dr. Sinister himself, flipping through paperwork behind a mahogany
 desk.

 How on Earth did he manage to spare the mass to send up a mahogany
 desk? Ah well. No time to question his priorities; you've got an
 evildoer to stop.

 You advance on the doctor, winding up. He puts his paper down and
 makes some futile warding gestures. "Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa,

 "Well, there was your army of genetically-modified sharks."

 Sinister blanches. "You were able to defeat them? They should have

 You think back. "Actually, now that you mention it, no; I just flew
 out of their reach."

 "You can fly. Doesn't count."

 [1] "Trap doors."
 [2] "Orbital Doom Cannons."

 "There's this entire station, which you've built around a huge

 "That never threatened you. It would have been able to hold the world
 hostage in a few more hours, but..."

 "I've wasted far too much time with this as it is. Enough." You wind
 up again, but Dr. Sinister again waves you off.

 "No, really, that won't be necessary. I'll come quietly. I know when
 I'm beaten."

 Dr. Sinister narrows his eyes. "Why send you, then?"

 [2] "To make them unnecessary."

 "You might have missed this, but I'm one of the good guys. I'm not a

 You gesture at the door. "It's over. Save who you can, and just come
 quietly."

 Dr. Sinister considers you, and nods slowly. "If what you say is true,
 it sounds like I may owe you my thanks." Just then the screens on his
 desk glow red. He looks at it briefly. "Yes. Thank you. Let's go."

 December 31st, 2014.

 Dr. Sinister is at it again! The Concordance of Powered Response isn't
 entirely clear on what it is he's planning, but it's big and it's
 based in his island fortress. This is clearly a task for one of the
 world's mightiest champions!

 Unfortunately, they've had to send you instead; the world's mightiest
 champions have other emergencies to deal with. New Year's Eve is
 always rough.

 Regardless, this looks by-the-book so far. The containment fields have
 been put in place. Now all you have to do is get over to his island
 base, infiltrate it, defeat him, and bring him in.

 Interactive Fiction before.]

 Shalestorm Shingle
 City Hall teleported you here to Shalestorm Shingle mainly for the
 drama of the name. Small rocks and stones litter the ground here, but
 it dissolves to good clean sand a little ways to the south.

 The city's containment force fields wall off the area to the north and
 east. The great Pacific Ocean stretches out to the west. Across the
 sea some distance, you can see Dr. Sinister's island fortress.

 Dr. Sinister's Tower
 You're standing on the top of Dr. Sinister's stronghold. Most of the
 roof is curved into a retractable dome, except for the access path
 ringing the roof.

 A small round access hatch sits on the floor of the walkway.

>pry hatch
 (the access hatch)
 (first taking the crowbar)
 Ah, the crowbar. Truly a tool with a thousand uses. You make quick
 work of whatever was making the hatch stick, and it pops open with a
 gratifying hiss.

>go down
 You climb down into Dr. Sinister's island tower.

 Hangar Catwalk
 You're standing on a narrow catwalk ringing a vast hangar. To the west
 is an airlock leading into a bright yellow rocket that fills most of
 the area. A ladder leads both up through the ceiling, and down to the
 floor of the hangar proper. The roof forms a dome about 30 feet above
 your head. You could also easily take off from here, if you were so
 inclined.

 A small round access hatch stands open on the ceiling, leading up and
 out of the tower.

 Right then. Time to get to work.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>take rocket
 You're as likely to manage that as to take the entire tower.
