  "Greetings Almighty! Allow me to tell you about your world, Aarkland."

 Our story begins here.

 The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from early
 morning until all that must be done is done. The summer has been good
 and this winter no one will starve. That is what the villagers believe,
 anyway. In ignorance they have turned from you and cannot see the
 coming darkness. For them Ignorance is bliss, but refusing to see the
 truth is no protection against evil.

 The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You watch
 her treading along the road and when she stops next to the water, you
 once more feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in more than a
 hundred years that has been born with the old power. The youngest
 daughter to Lorne and Noki, this innocent girl searches the sky for
 your presence. She smiles when she senses it and gives you a little
 wave. She is the last one. The last hope.

 Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance
 back along the road, and makes sure her sandals are fastened properly.
 Surely she can sense you watching her, but she says nothing. She
 reaches into her rucksack and brings out some bread. She nibbles on it
 without much enthusiasm while watching the flowing river, and she waits
 for you.

 The girl has the power to "reach" beyond what the eye can see and
 "heal" what is broken, but she is not strong enough to make a
 difference. Not without guidance. That is where you come in. As the God
 of this land, you must guide her. First, you should send her to the
 unholy stones to see what the world around her is hiding.

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)
 This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
 forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
 Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
 the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.

 Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by
 grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east.
 Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare
 to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast
 is a pile of stones. The stones are barely visible above the grass.

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 A whiff of the deformed bushes reaches Lornedei's nose and she waves
 the unpleasant odor away.

>examine me
 You are The almighty, the last of the Gods. Your wish is Lornedei's
 command and she will do as you ask if it is possible.

 When she was born you managed to give her, as your chosen one, the
 power to heal and to reach into things with her mind. She is young
 though and you must show her the way. You might be a god but you are
 not much more than a vague presence in this world.
 Lornedei suddenly looks startled.
 "Master what is this?" A firefly is buzzing around her head. She waves
 her hand to wave it away when suddenly a small voice pipes up.
 "No, No, silly girl. I am no harm! I am here to help you must know!"
 Lornedei stops waving but she looks dubiously at the tiny creature.
 Once safe from the terribly waving arm, the firefly stops for a rest on
 Lornedei's brow. The tiny voice pipes up again. "I must come, curious
 am I, and I can help such as you!" Lornedei tries to look up at the fly
 but all that happens is that her eyes cross. "There is magic here,
 magic in you girl. I have not sensed magic in a long time, yes!" the
 fly takes off and starts buzzing around Lornedei's head again. "Strong
 you are not! Oh, no. That god of yours was stingy in his giving so he
 was. Pity, pity. You can be stronger though. Sometimes from nature,
 sometimes from other things. You must know girl, to regain strength
 that you lose, you must eat. Ah, there are some here, I have searched
 for these." the fly buzzes off towards the deformed bushes and lands on
 one of the berries growing there. "Eat these and be strong, do not
 forget." there is an angry buzzing, a strange grunting sound, and a
 thud as a white berry, seemingly with a firefly attached on the top,
 falls to the ground. "Me... Will just.." In an amazing display of
 over-insectile powers, the fly lifts the berry off the ground. "will
 just take this." The firefly, along with its booty, disappears with a
 pop and a flash.

 The firefly is available for questioning. It is happy to help. Just
 type "hint" and it will come.

 Aarkland (On the Unholy Stones)
 For as long as Lornedei can remember, she has been told not to go
 there. There is nothing strange about the stones at a distance. It
 could just be a collection of fieldstones, perhaps from the time when
 the settlers first prepared the field. Nothing could be more wrong.
 There are piles of stones in many fields, but none with this kind of
 history.

 She hesitates and turns to you. It seems like she wants to say
 something. She keeps silent and steps up on the platform.
 The collection of stones is over ten paces from edge to edge. The top
 has been flattened to create a platform and that is where Lornedei
 stands. No new stones have been added in several hundred years. Despite
 the lack of activity, nothing grows near the stones.

 There are powers here that make it easier for her to use her magic. You
 can make her see what hides around her. She will see the world as it
 is, what hides beyond what the eye can see.

 She can go north to the field or northwest back to the dusty road.

>borrow stone
 "Master? I don't understand."

>reach stone
 Lornedei reaches down in the ground by her feet. She shuts her eyes and
 lets her mind touch the stones one by one. One lost name after another
 flies through her mind like a swarm of insane and vicious insects.
 Hundreds, thousands of names of men, women and children. Each one has a
 history, a life led in pain or ignorance, but they all share the same
 pain. The same longing, the same sorrow, the same terrible fate.
 Crying, she drops to her knees.
 "These people were all severed. Their names were stolen, ripped away
 from their souls. They did not all deserve this fate, I am sure. These
 names belong to the spirits Master, but they can never be whole again.
 Never!" Lornedei takes a deep breath and gets back up on her feet.

 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>examine lornedei
 This is Lornedei. She is the youngest child of Lorne and Noki and the
 only girl out of the four children. She is not quite a woman, not quite
 a child. Her long golden hair, blue eyes and innocent eagerness to
 please is charming. Unlike her family and other villagers, she believes
 in you.
 She is dressed in a finely woven shirt worn over a pair of riding
 trousers. The outfit is borrowed from her brother. He is of course
 unaware of his generosity. On her feet is a pair of leather sandals.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>get stone
 Lornedei picks up one of the stones to take a closer look. She quickly
 drops it again.
 "I cannot touch these Master. There is so much evil here, so much
 sorrow. They make me feel ill."


>examine trousers
 She is wearing a pair of pants that she borrowed for the day from one
 of her brothers. Well worn but clean and dry.

>search them
 Perhaps you should leave Lornedei's clothing alone.

>examine world
 There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a
 distant object, but she can do nothing with it.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>reach world
 The world around Lornedei fades. She finds herself high up in the air,
 hovering above a seemingly endless field. She flaps her white wings
 tentatively at first, but then she catches an upwind and rises.
 Not far ahead of her is a vast and lush forest, stretching north and
 northeast. She looks east. Between the field and the endless ocean are
 a few homes, perhaps a fishing village, and a patchwork of fields. As
 she hovers far above the field, turning to the south, she can see a
 road following a river to another village far to the south. It is
 Lornedei's own.

 She turns west and the forbidden forest, a landscape of gray, stretches
 out ahead of her. It stretches to the southwest and to the northwest as
 far as she can see. It is a swirling black and gray mass of mist or
 smoke, for the most part unbroken except for the occasional tree-top
 protruding here and there.



 She moves closer until she is above the glittering water of the
 Aarkland river and turns north. She follows the flowing water until it
 seems to disappear into a large cliff. The two forests meet at the top
 of the cliff, but the old forest seems to give way more and more so
 that the border turns northeast towards a distant mountain chain. The
 river does not seem to appear again.

 She turns west, soaring above unbroken gray, seeing only the occasional
 twisted treetop shooting out of the thick mist and a blue sky above.
 She flies on, across a landscape of gray and black. The mist Swirls
 here and there, darkens here and there, but never reveals what is
 below.

 Then the air seems to thin and she sinks down. She sinks down below the
 mist. She finds herself racing between twisted tree-trunks and grasping
 branches. A dry whisper follows her as she loses her orientation.
 Silent shapes like shadows follow her path. Spirits, hollow-eyed, pale
 and ragged, open their mouths in rage and longing before they shy away
 from her. They melt back into the shadows between the trees. Suddenly
 she is out of the forest.

 Below her is a barren landscape of sand and broken earth. The forbidden
 forest surrounds this field of despair, although the sky is clear.
 Above the mist, to the northeast, she can see a pale silhouette of the
 mountains. She can see a far distant shade of green to the east, beyond
 which is a blue horizon.

 The same view meets her to the southeast, but to the south, southwest
 and west, there is only the forbidden forest with its blanket of mist.

 She lowers herself until she is just above stony ground. A deep ravine
 separates the field from the forest to the west. The ravine runs south
 to north into a misty plain where it disappears out of sight. To the
 northwest, clinging to the edge of the ravine, there is an old ruin...a
 castle. Only part of the ruin is visible as the rest of it fades into
 gray mist.

 She turns westward and sinks down in the ravine. Making her way north,
 the tip of her left wing nearly strokes the far ravine wall. She turns
 upwards and flies clockwise around the entire castle ruin. Most of the
 old castle is gone. As she is viewing it from the outside she can see
 chambers, dungeons and rooms in several levels that are exposed. The
 rest of the ruin is at the bottom of the ravine. After flying through
 the mist on the far side of the ruin, she appears at a great wall that
 separates the castle grounds from the northern wastelands before
 turning southeast. In the southeast corner of the big desolate field
 the ground slopes down and turns into a ragged hole in the ground. Heat
 ripples the air around it. A large fire burns within a ring of stones.

 She circles the fire. She is in a hurry, searching for the thing that
 should be but is no longer. She returns to the ruin. There is a high
 wall east of the castle and she stops to rest on top of it.

 The world wavers its way back to reality and Lornedei looks pale and a
 bit unsteady on her feet.
 "Too high! Master? If I die and must come back, please do not make me a
 bird!"There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a
 distant object, but she can do nothing with it.

>reach fire
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>reach ravine
 "I cannot focus enough to find that Master. It is too distant for me,
 or too weak for me to reach from here."
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>reach bread
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>examine cheese
 A piece of cheese. Fortunately, this is not made by Noki. It may
 actually be edible.

>reach river
 "The river is flowing past in peace Master. It disappears into a cliff
 somewhere north, and I cannot follow it with my mind."

>pray
 She does. Every night. You taught her well.
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

>go north

 Aarkland (Billowing Field)
 Lornedei hesitates throwing an anxious glance south.

 Maybe she would prefer to be back in the safe grasp of her kin. If that
 is the case, she will never tell her God. She does not know why she is
 here or how easy her mind and flesh may be corrupted, and she may be
 better off that way.

 Very carefully, you give her just the slightest of mental nudges to
 remove the hesitation from her mind. Not again can you give her a
 command without letting her choose how to proceed. What she has ahead
 of her she must do of her own free will as much as possible. Lornedei
 takes her eyes off the road and moves on.
 The grass grows waist high. Touched by sun, wind, and rain, it
 patiently waits for the farmers that will not come. The edge of the old
 forest lies close by to the north. To the south, a big pile of stones
 rises above the grass. The road is back west.

 There is a low growling coming from the high grass. An injured wolf
 lies there.

>examine wolf
 A wolf lies in the grass near the edge of the forest. The wolf is
 female and quite small. She is breathing heavily in obvious pain.
 Despite the apparent distress, she manages to show Lornedei an
 impressive set of sharp teeth. One of her hind legs seems broken and
 dried blood covering a big part of the grey fur tells its own story.

 The animal is exhausted and badly injured. She will most definitely die
 if nothing is done soon.

>heal wolf
 Lornedei shuts her eyes, raising both hands towards the dying animal.
 She summons her powers and the air starts to shimmer above the wolf. In
 sudden panic the wolf yelps miserably and tries to get up on its feet,
 but Lornedei's soft mumbling calms the animal. Still, the stare from
 those yellow eyes and a deep growl behind the exposed sharp teeth
 cannot be mistaken for friendliness.

 Another mumbled phrase is heard from the girl and the predator's eyes
 slowly close. The wolf is asleep. The girl kneels while the swirling
 blue light covers the wolf with healing power. In one quick move, she
 corrects the broken leg to allow it to heal properly. A long while
 passes. Then she sits back in the grass, tired but smiling. She lets
 the healing light dissipate in the air.
 "All is well Master. I shall call her Deini."

 Another long while passes. The air is warm but a slight breeze moves
 the grass around Lornedei. It sways gently, like waves, across the vast
 field.

 The wolf opens its eyes, blinks, gets up. Lornedei sits on the ground
 with a confident smile on her lips and her hands in her lap. The
 beautiful animal stands absolutely still for a moment, meeting the
 girl's eyes. Then, in a heartbeat, it turns away. It runs along the
 edge of the forest. It stops near a big tree and turns around to watch
 the human. It sits down while considering its options.

 Then suddenly, the wolf that Lornedei named "Deini" comes running back.
 She smells the human, inspects her carefully, and makes a decision. She
 puts a cool muzzle in the hand that Lornedei is holding out. Lornedei
 has gained a friend.

 Lornedei's magic just dropped by five.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>talk to Deini
 The wolf looks at Lornedei expectantly but when the subject doesn't
 appear to be about food she starts gnawing on an itchy spot on her leg.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>ask Deini about leg
 Deini looks at Lornedei for a moment before she looses interest.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

 "What should I do?"

>reach deini

>go north

 Aarkland (Billowing Field)

 Deini is here.

>deini, follow me
 Deini looks at Lornedei, wondering if there might be something to eat
 first. When that doesn't seem to happen, the wolf ignores her command.

>sance
 "Master? I don't understand."

>dance
 "Master? I don't understand."

>give bread to deini
 Deini smells the bread, sneezes, and backs away. She glances
 suspiciously at the piece of bread.

>give cheese to deini
 (Taking the piece of cheese first.)
 Deini smells the piece of cheese but she is not very interested in
 anything that never had a heart beat at one point.

>go west

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>go west

 In the River (By the Road)
 Lornedei tightens her sandals and checks her rucksack, making sure it
 is closed tight before entering the river. She steps carefully down the
 slippery slope and through the parting rushes and reeds. Something
 squawks at her but it is gone before she can see it. When her feet lose
 contact with the bottom, she floats and lets the remaining hesitation
 float away with the invisible currents below.
 The river runs from north to south. Ahead of her, the glittering water
 becomes shaded by the two forests. The forbidden forest on the left and
 the still green old forest on the right. The river disappears out of
 sight perhaps a hundred paces into the tunnel of trees, water, and
 shadows. The dusty road is east, where she can get out of the water.
 She can also dive down to the bottom of the river.
 Lornedei fumbles and dips the bread in the water. The loaf of horrid
 bread sucks up water like a sponge. It is totally ruined in seconds. It
 turns into mush that dissolves in Lornedei's hand. With a disgusted
 grimace, she lets it float away down stream.
 A dry black leaf drops from the forbidden forest into the water right
 in front of Lornedei. It bobs up and down a couple of times before it
 floats away downstream.

>undo

 Let it be so!

 She can also dive down to the bottom of the river.

>dive to bottom
 All I understood was a wish to dive.

>dive down
 All I understood was a wish to dive.

>dive
 She dives down.

 River Bottom (Here be Sand)
 A magical world reveals itself. The river continues north. The bottom
 is mostly composed of sand, rocks, some mud, and quickly fleeing fish.
 All kinds of things have been thrown in the river from the road and are
 now resting under a layer of sand until the end of time. The river
 continues north.

>go south
 That is not the way.  She can go north or up.

>go north

 River Bottom (Here be Mud)
 It's harder to see here. The river flows from north to south. The mud
 swirls up, preventing her from seeing more than a few arm lengths
 ahead. The old trees reach out their roots under the water. They crowd
 the bottom along with swaying vegetation and rocks.

 She can see a small gray plaque here.

>take plaque
 As you wish.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine plaque
 It is a small round plaque in a material unknown to Lornedei. The
 surface is smooth and with a deep polish. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's hand. The surface shows nothing, not even the distorted
 image of Lornedei herself that one might expect. What shows in the
 plaque is like a reflection of a stormy sky in a puddle of murky water,
 just before the rain starts hammering.
 Her lungs are starting to ache. She will have to go to the surface
 soon!

>go up

 In the River (Between the Forests)
 Giant trees shade the river from both sides. Deformed branches dip
 their fingers in the water as if testing the depth before entering the
 water. Lornedei throws her head to the left, when a sudden sound is
 heard from the black forest. She moves a little bit closer to the east
 riverbank.

 A constant play of light and shadow goes on around her. The two forests
 lean towards each other from both sides. The sketched outlines of the
 two forests against a clear sky create deep shadows, distorted mirrored
 images, and an illusion of endless depths below.
 The forbidden forest is to the west and the old forest to the east. The
 river flows back south and down takes her to the bottom of the river.
 To the north the river disappears out of sight around a bend, and there
 is a slight opening in the trees to the east.
 A tiny voice suddenly pipes up from somewhere in the dark forest. "Most
 interesting... Most strange this is. Oh, no, nasty bug, go away!" The
 firefly comes out of the forest in a reckless speed, skids on the
 surface in front of Lornedei with a shocked screech, gets airborne and
 settles on her head, clearly exasperated.
 "Nasty, nasty things. Let me just rest girl, just for a moment."
 Lornedei watches the black forest for a moment, waiting for the firefly
 to calm down. When the little creature talks again, it seems to have
 regained its composure. It lifts off and starts circling Lornedei.

 "The nasty forest has secrets. It might tell you if you look beyond.
 You must reach inside it to get knowledge girl. So many secrets are
 everywhere in this forest, and the other forest, leaves and rocks and
 the beasts living there." The fly buzzes over to a black leaf floating
 on the river. "This here is not what it seems either." The fly lands on
 the edge of the leaf and with an angry buzzing, it propels its little
 ship downstream without another word.

>examine leaf
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the black leaves or the green leaves?

>black
  The leaves look the same on each tree, even though the types of trees
 are different altogether. It is more like an infestation of these
 things, these leaves. They are leaves are they not? They grow in
 clusters that hang down from each limb. They give the entire forest a
 drooping, weighed down appearance. Each cluster holds somewhere around
 eight shell-like leaves and each branch holds eight to twelve clusters,
 depending on the size of the tree. The occasional single leaf grows
 directly on the black trunk of some of the trees. They look more like a
 shimmering wart or pimple growing on the scorched bark. The clusters
 look more and more like colonies of big water bugs clinging to each
 other in fear of dropping to the ground.

 The leaves move, but not by wind. There is a barely perceptible
 rearrangement within the clusters. A quick adjustment of the leaves
 takes place and then it is entirely still again. Each slight movement
 in a cluster creates a dry, scratching, whispering sound. The sound
 generated by a single cluster of leaves is barely audible, but since
 some of the clusters are always moving, the resulting sound is a shrill
 whispering, a scraping, almost a singing. It is a strangely modulated
 melody that travels from tree to tree through the forest. It varies in
 pitch and volume but is always present.

>reach leaf
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the black leaves or the green leaves?

>black
 Lornedei lets her mind reach into the leaves.
 "Master, these are not leaves, not entirely. They have been, and
 perhaps they can be again, but what I feel is something else. It is
 alive, in a way, and it is waiting."

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>get black leaf
 Lornedei grabs one of the black leaves in the nearest cluster of leaves
 and twists it loose. The leaf, being as long as her middle finger,
 falls to its side in her palm. The curved inside of the leaf suddenly
 fills with a hideous mush that swells and boils as she watches. Flesh
 grows and shapes itself in the shell into an insect's body. The mush is
 white with brown and dark red streaks. The nasty mess is swirling
 around inside the leaf, forming the flesh bit by bit. The shiny wetness
 dries quickly once the beetle's body takes form inside its shell. A
 thin purple layer finally covers the belly. Six black legs pop out
 through the newly formed glittering layer of skin. It takes only a
 moment for them to start moving around. Another pop forces a wriggling
 head out and the insect is near completion. The bug grows at a furious
 pace and finally it extrudes a pair of black antennae that unfold until
 they're as long, if not longer, than the entire beetle.

 Lornedei turns the beetle over. It stays nearly motionless in her hand.
 The long antennae, shivering slightly, carefully touch the outline of
 the hand holding it, the sensitive inside of Lornedei's wrist, the
 sleeve of her shirt. The beetle seems satisfied with its new master.

>go south

 In the River (By the Road)

>go south
 Even if she needed to go south back to the village, following the road
 would be easier than swimming the entire way. She can get out of the
 river to the east or follow it north.

>go east
 Lornedei drags herself up on the east riverbank. She stops a moment to
 rest before stepping up on the dusty road.

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.

 She can also see a loaf of horrid bread, a handful of white berries and
 a piece of cheese here.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>get all
 loaf of horrid bread: As you wish.
 handful of white berries: As you wish.
 piece of cheese: As you wish.
 "Master?"

>go north
 No, she can go east to the field, southeast to the unholy stones, or
 enter the river to the west.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>go east

 Aarkland (Billowing Field)

 Deini is here.

>go north
 No, that is not the way. The river is west and the unholy stones are to
 the south.

>go west

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.

>close backpack
 Lornedei takes care of the rucksack. She will open it when she needs
 something and close it properly when it needs to be closed. Just
 remember that she cannot do anything with it while she is under water.

>raise backpack
 "Master? I don't understand."

>hold backpack above head
 All I understood was a wish to hold the leather rucksack.

>put bread in rucksack
 She drops the loaf of horrid bread into the leather rucksack.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>put cheese in rucksack
 She drops the piece of cheese into the leather rucksack.

>put berries in rucksack
 She drops the handful of white berries into the leather rucksack.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 76.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a large black beetle (Fluffing up its wings at the moment.)
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)

     a piece of cheese
     a loaf of horrid bread

>put beetle in rucksack
 She drops the big black beetle into the leather rucksack.

>go west

 In the River (By the Road)

>go down
 She dives down.

 River Bottom (Here be Sand)

>search sand
 Lornedei digs around in the sand but finds nothing but rocks, sand,
 mud, rotting pieces of wood and other vegetation.

>get sand
 The sand and mud is everywhere and it's utterly useless.

>reach plaque
 Lornedei just shrugs. There doesn't seem to be anything she can learn
 about the plaque.

>go north

 River Bottom (Here be Mud)
 Her lungs are starting to ache. She will have to go to the surface
 soon!

>go up

 In the River (Between the Forests)

>go north

 In the River (By the Cliff)
 She floats on the surface in the shadows of the trees, accompanied by
 the sounds of the forests: A murmur of life from the old forest, and a
 dry whispering, not quite as pleasant, from the black trees on the
 other riverbank.
 The river makes a slight turn, hiding the road from view. A vertical
 cliff stops her from going any further north in this tunnel of water,
 trees, and shadows. Above her head is a frayed ribbon of blue sky and
 at the top of the cliff, the two forests meet. Below and around her
 there is that play of light and dark, maybe just a little bit darker.
 South takes her back around the bend. Looking down she can see an
 opening in the cliff.

>rub plaque
 There is no need for her to do that.

>reach sky
 (the sky)
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 76.
 Lornedei is carrying:

>examine beetle
 It's a black beetle as big as Lornedei's hand from antenna tip to end.
 The hard shell shimmers in shades of red and green.

>talk to beetle
 "I do not believe this little chap talks a whole lot. It is quiet now
 in any case."

>verbose

 An Interactive Fantasy.
  is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
 locations (even if she's been there before).

>examine opening
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine forest
 These trees all look dead at first sight. Scorched and tortured, they
 reach out their blackened limbs over the cowering undergrowth. They do
 have leaves, however, not green and lush but almost black.

>examine cliff
 The river ends here. Ahead is a nearly triangular formation of smooth
 rock, its flat face perpendicular to the water, facing south. The
 triangle stands with its wide base in the water and the ragged tip
 acting as a divider beetween the two forests. The rock is smooth and
 dark.

>stand on rock
 Lornedei glances questioningly at the vertical cliff. That is not
 something that she can enter.

>exits
  She can go south or down.

>go down
 She dives down.

 River Bottom (At the Cave Entrance)
 The bottom is littered with rocks. There are piles of them of varying
 sizes, washed clean by the constant flow of water. Around the sides of
 the opening into the cave, a few colonies of a slimy and sickly green
 plant have managed to make a home. They sway back and forth in the
 current while clinging desperately to the rocks. The opening leads
 northwest into a cave and south takes her back around the river bend.

>examine plant
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine rock
 Rocks of all sizes: some sharp as if crushed, some reasonably round,
 some smooth smaller stones, and even some smoother pebbles are
 scattered everywhere on top of a layer of mud and sand.

>take rock
 The rocks do not interest Lornedei. Leave them be.

>in

 Caves (Entering the Caves)
 Lornedei's pale hand trails the cave wall as she quickly swims through
 the opening in the cliff. The opening is just big enough for her to go
 through. Inside, the cave widens slightly.
 Darkness is chased away by only a few illusive reflections in the
 stone, thanks to the little light leaking in from the opening. The
 tunnel continues west into total darkness and Southeast takes her out
 of the cave.

 She can see a fairy lamp with a crystal spider inside here.

>get lamp
 As you wish.
 Her lungs are starting to ache. She will have to go to the surface

 South takes her back around the bend. Looking down she can see an
 opening in the cliff.

>examine lamp
 The fairy lamp is a perfectly round, transparent orb that fits
 inLornedei's hand. It is hard as a rock, cold as ice and covered with
 years of grime and dirt. Through the dirt, a soft light is visible. It
 is not enough to illuminate anything at the moment.

 This is one of the old people's fairy lamps. Crystal spiders light up
 in the presence of someone with any magical powers. However, the
 spiders are, according to legend, not to be trusted. That is why they
 were, and apparently, some still are, trapped this way.

 There used to be many of these around and they were used as lamps by
 the light bearers but the use of them has been forgotten over the
 years.

>push save
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>clean lamp
 Lornedei starts to clean away the layer of dirt from the surface of the
 lamp. After some heavy duty scrubbing, the lamp shines bright.

 There is a strange ticking sound. When she looks at the lamp, the
 crystal spider inside stares back at her. It lifts a leg and gives the
 inside of its prison another tap. After that, the spider curls up and
 is still again.

>examine spider
 She can't quite see what it looks like as long as it's trapped inside
 the lamp. She'll have to free it somehow.

>reach spider
 She is surrounded by crimson light. Intense, dancing light streaked
 with strands of pure dark. Greasy suffocating smoke, then a flash of
 blinding white, Deafening thunder of falling rocks. Then nothing.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>go down
 She dives down.

>go west

 Caves (Choosing the Path)
 Lornedei moves on through a current caused by the narrowing of the
 tunnel. She makes it past and to calmer water where the tunnel splits
 into four.
 The main flow seems to continue north, while two smaller tunnels lead
 northwest and west. East takes her back near the opening.

>go west

 Caves (In the Restless Waters)
 A strong current grabs her. She is flipped around, thrown like a
 puppy's toy. The water tries to drag her down to the bottom. She is
 immediately confused and swims towards the surface. Hard rock meets her
 outstretched hand in each direction. There is nothing but stone.

>exits
  There seems to be no other way but down.

>go down

 Caves (In the Gathering of Dead)
 The water is colder. The pressure in her ears is starting to get
 painful but now she can see it. The bottom is littered with bones,
 skulls and rib cages of all sizes that lie in droves on the sand. Pale
 bony hands wave at her in the unexplainable current. Grinning skulls
 mock her and whisper.
 "Come! Rest here with us!"
 There is a subtle movement near one wall. The bones twitch and move
 slightly as if pulled by a current.
 Her lungs are starting to ache. She will have to go to the surface
 soon!

>get bone
 Lornedei looks terrified, but she moves closer to the layer of bones
 covering the bottom.
 Suddenly, Lornedei is grabbed by a current stronger than she can
 handle.

 She is dragged and pulled through the water, through a narrow opening
 in the cliff, up through a narrow well, and through wet cold darkness.
 She breaks the surface, spitting water, choking in her greedy quest for
 air.

 Inside an Old Stone Well (In Gurgling Water)
 The dark water swirls and gurgles in this small well. The crumbling
 edge of the stone cylinder is perhaps an arms length higher than the
 surface.
 Dim rays of light find their way down to the dark water, but help
 little to chase away the shadows.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 75.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   A brightly shining fairy lamp with a crystal spider inside
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a large black beetle (Airing out its shell at the moment.)
     a handful of white berries
     a piece of cheese
     a loaf of horrid bread

>go up
 She grabs the slippery stones and climbs out of the old well, wet and
 exhausted. She sits down on the ground, leaning against the cold
 stones.

 Hall of Severance
 Slowly, Lornedei looks around this dark clearing. An oppressive gray
 fog hangs over everything and seems to add weight to the air itself.
 There is a presence here. Something is waiting among the dark trees.
 Something sinister.
 The gray mist hides the sun from sight and there is no way to make out
 which direction is which.
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly. The shadows beneath them
 seem to grow momentarily, but when Lornedei Looks at them the movement
 stops.
 There is a loud buzzing from the rucksack. Suddenly the Beetle comes
 crawling out and scrambles down to the ground. It spins around.

>examine beetle
 It's a black beetle as big as Lornedei's hand from antenna tip to end.
 The hard shell shimmers in shades of red and green.

>ask beetle about tree
 The beetle actually seems to consider this for a moment. That was only
 wishful thinking though.
 The beetle runs off to one of the paths. It spins around once before
 returning to Lornedei.
 Something touches Lornedei's foot. She pulls her leg away from the
 grasping root with a shriek.

>examine roots
 The roots are black and scorched just like the rest of the tree, but
 there are patches where the crusted surface has cracked and large
 pieces, almost like scales, have dropped off. There in the open wounds,
 the surface is the colour of cheese gone hard and sweaty, but the
 texture is stringy instead of smooth. The bigger roots bend upwards and
 then down through the ground. In this way they leave hollows and
 shadows seeming to lead in under the oak's twisted and gnarled trunk.
 The deformed bushes rustle and seem to reach for her.

>examine bushes
 These bushes resemble those at the village road, but there are quite a
 few more of them. These look even more gnarled and deformed, as though
 starved of clean water and sunlight.
 These also have thorns as well as, oddly enough, plenty of purple nuts.
 The beetle stands still, seemingly watching the deformed bushes.
 A dry black leaf drops down on Lornedei's shoulder. With a grimace, she
 flicks it with a finger to get rid of it.

>heal roots
 Healing drains too much power. That would be a waste.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.
 A dry black leaf drops down on Lornedei's shoulder. With a grimace, she
 flicks it with a finger to get rid of it.

>take nuts
 "No thank you Master. Only a fool would try to do anything with those
 nuts." To emphasize her point, she gives the nearest bush a kick and a
 cloud of putrid dust from the leaves rises. A thorny nut falls to the
 ground.
 The beetle stands still, seemingly watching the deformed bushes.

>reach bushes
 Lornedei lets her mind sink into the dry twisted branches of the
 bushes. After just a moment she steps backwards, clasping her throat
 with wide, fearful eyes.
 "These trees do not feed on water and sun. Their thirst is for
 something else and they have not received any for so long. That is why
 they have died, but the nuts... I do not understand."

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>take nut
 Lornedei carefully picks up the nut. She quickly drops it in the
 rucksack.

>examine oak
 A giant black oak takes pride of place in the hall of severance. The
 shadow of the huge crown, a shadow that is nothing more than a slightly
 darker darkness, seems to reach beyond what it ought to be able to.
 The oak watches over the clearing. It gives the impression of a greedy
 old man guarding his treasures with suspiciously gleaming eyes.

 One of the big black branches reaches out far above Lornedei's head and
 seems to disappear into a cloud of black smoke. Steps are cut in the
 oak to provide a way up.

>examine altar
 This less than holy stone is five feet long, four feet wide and is
 waist high. The old stone is almost black.
 Whether it is the natural color of the stone or if the color is caused
 by something else is hard to tell. Lornedei will not speculate.

 Ancient carvings cover all visible sides. Most of them are faded and
 impossible to read.
 The beetle runs off to one of the paths. It spins around once before
 returning to Lornedei.

>exits
  She can enter the stone house, climb the oak or try one of the trails.

>examine house
 This death house was not built in your name. The forgotten ones, when
 they were still only humans, were chained in there. Sometimes they were
 chained for hours, sometimes for weeks. They all gave up their names in
 the end, and their spirits fled into the vast forest. The trees were
 still green, the soil not yet tainted beyond repair, the forest alive
 and well.

 What stands here now is a crumbling round stone building not more than
 perhaps six paces from opening to far wall, with a mostly sunken in
 roof. The opening in the gray and faltering stonework, the only
 opening, leads into darkness. This ragged and sorrowful eye is slightly
 askew and it seems to glare moodily at the altar, dead tired of the
 view, or perhaps relishing it. The door that must have hung there at
 one point is now gone. It is most likely now rotting away under a layer
 of dirt. Since the rituals ended, there has been no one to tend to this
 house of shame. The acknowledgement of its existence perhaps too
 painful.

 The acts of cruelty, so wrongly justified in the name of peace, have
 stopped. The screams are now silence, but the memories remain.

>examine paths
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the trail going right , the path to
 the left  or the path leading straight ahead?

>examine right path
 The right trail is quite wide and as well maintained as any great
 castles gardens trail. Seemingly so. The forbidden forest makes it dark
 and menacing, contradicting what the eye can clearly see.
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.

>examine left path
 The trail is dark but hard packed and seemingly well traveled. Shadows
 line the sides even though there is no light to cast them.

>examine ahead path
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine straight path
 This path is not so much a trail as a country road, Straight and flat,
 free from muddy wheel tracks or invading vegetation.

 Looks a bit too straight, too clean, too good to be true.
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.
 A dry black leaf drops down on Lornedei's shoulder. With a grimace, she
 flicks it with a finger to get rid of it.

>go up

 Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak)
  A shiver runs through the tree and the shrill song of the leaves seems
 to increase in volume for a moment. Lornedei folds herself over the
 branch and stays hanging precariously over it. She looks down. The
 clearing below her swims out of focus, seems to move away from her and
 then come rushing back at her. She clings desperately to the scorched
 limb, unsure if she is going to slide backwards and down on the ground,
 or tip over forward with the same fatal result. She shuts her eyes
 hard.

 And the world is still once more. Very carefully, she lifts one leg
 over the branch and then she is sitting steady. She opens her eyes and
 with a sigh of relief. The clearing looks as it should, all
 considering.

 Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper
 branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She
 can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is
 nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing
 and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can
 climb down to the ground or follow the branch.

>examine smoke
 The cloud of smoke seems to be spinning slowly. It shifts in black and
 sometimes purple. It obscures the branch and she cannot see anything in
 or around it. Everything seems to disappear within the smoke.

>examine shield
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>reach smoke
 "I cannot use my powers to reach into the smoke Master. It frightens
 me."

>follow branch
 Lornedei follows the branch outwards towards the smoke. It seems to
 rise and meet her and then it surrounds her.

 Nightmare's Den
 A dark wall of smoke surrounds her. Occasionally a ragged veil of
 broken vapor is detached from it and dissolves in the air. There is
 nothing here. Even the ground is gone. Although she can feel it under
 her feet, she will not try to touch it.
 "I feel so strange. It is so dark here, so wrong. Everything seems to
 be turning. I feel something here but it is hidden from me."
 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>exits
  there does not seem to be anywhere she can go from here.

>reach smoke
 "I feel ill Master. It feels like I would be sick if I try. Something
 is draining me and there is nothing I can do. It feels like everything

 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden

 Ancient carvings cover all visible sides. Most of them are faded and
 impossible to read.

>reach altar
 She lifts her hands towards the stained altar. She focuses, frowning,
 then she is shoved back by something. The connection breaks and
 Lornedei gasps for air.
 "No Master, I cannot! There is so much wickedness there and it does not
 want to reveal its secrets. All I could sense was pain. Pain, fear, and
 blood."
 Lornedei's magic just dropped by five.
 "What should I do?"

>undo
 Hall of Severance
 Let it be so!

>eat berry
 (Taking the handful of white berries first.)
 Lornedei eats another white berry.
 Lornedei's magic just went up by three.
 Something touches Lornedei's foot. She pulls her leg away from the
 grasping root with a shriek.

>enter house

 Hall of Severance (In the House of Penance)
  Lornedei steps through the crumbling opening into a darkness that is
 not quite total. There is dim light sifting down from the ruined
 ceiling above. She glances up, perhaps fearing that the whole
 construction will give up at her intrusion.

 But the only thing falling down on her is the weight of history;
 stories of cruel ignorance, memories that linger. The light catches a
 glittering thread and Lornedei swipes at the descending spider before
 it can land on her. With a grimace she steps on it before it can
 scramble away, burying it in the dry dirt. She looks around, but if
 there are more spiders here, they keep out of her way.
 The many years have taken its toll on this house. The circular wall
 tapers slightly towards the ceiling. Above her, a framework of thick
 beams support several generations worth of spider webs. There is not
 much left of the roof now. The light from outside leaks in through the
 holes in the ceiling. It magnifies the presence of fine dry dust that
 floats lazily in the still air. Long since rotted straw and reeds cover
 the earthen floor.

 A pair of rusty manacles hangs on the wall.

>examine straw
 She gives the rotted straw and dirt a quick glance but she has nothing
 to say about it.
 "What should I do?"

>examine manacles
 Lornedei shakes her head.

>reach manacles
 Lornedei shakes her head.

>search straw
 Lornedei kicks the rotted remains around with a grimace, holding her
 breath against the odors rising from the floor. A shriek cuts through
 the still air and she takes a step back.

 Empty sockets in a yellowed and cracked skull stare up at her. She
 takes another step towards the opening and starts to turn to leave.
 Something causes her to look back, though, perhaps a sense of shame for
 disturbing this final resting place. She stares at the human skull
 peeking out from its shallow grave, and goes to cover it again. Before
 she can throw a handful of the old straw over it, she stops. There is a
 sudden glimmering light from within one of the dark holes. There is
 something inside the skull. She also notices a small pouch in the
 shallow grave, half buried in the dirt.

>look in skull
 In the cracked skull is An amulet.

>examine amulet
 It's a pale blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.

>take amulet
 Lornedei's hand trembles at the touch.
 "So much power!"

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>wear it
 Lornedei hangs the amulet around her neck. Immediately it flares up and
 shines brightly. The blinding light fades somewhat and the light
 becomes soft and steady. Lornedei shivers in delight from the power in
 the crystal that gives itself to her.

 Lornedei's magic just went up by one hundred.

 "What should I do?"

>take pouch
 As you wish.

>examine pouch
 It is a dry and withered leather pouch, no bigger than a woman's fist.
 A leather string is used to close it and hang it in a belt.

>wear it
 She can't wear that!
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>open pouch
 She opens the small leather pouch, revealing a golden acorn.

>examine acorn
 It is an acorn in shape and form but it seems to be one in solid gold.

>reach acorn
 Lornedei holds the golden acorn in her hand. The images come to her
 without being reached for.

 A seedling, a sapling, a giant oak.
 All in a matter of seconds. Dripping water, a silver goblet.
 A wish to grow, a wish to heal.
 Instant flashes, not much more than emotion and fleeing images, but
 strong and urgent.
 Time is running out.
 The vision fades.

>examine beams
 Lornedei has no interest in the construction of this place. It may not
 even be safe to stay here very long.

>out
 She steps out in the clearing.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly. The shadows beneath them
 seem to grow momentarily, but when Lornedei Looks at them the movement
 stops.

 She can also see a large black beetle (Taking a nap at the moment.)
 here.
 Something touches Lornedei's foot. She pulls her leg away from the
 grasping root with a shriek.

>search roots
 After a quick look, she just shakes her head. She does not know.
 The beetle runs off to one of the paths. It spins around once before
 returning to Lornedei.

>ask beetle about paths
 The beetle actually seems to consider this for a moment. That was only
 wishful thinking though.
 The beetle scrambles through the dead grass to one of the paths. It
 spins around and comes back to Lornedei.

>take beetle
 The beetle crawls up in her hand.
 The beetle squirms its way out of Lornedei's grasp and drops to the
 ground. It runs off, climbs up on the stone well, climbs back down,
 crawls through the bushes and seems to inspect the stone house, to
 finally stop at one of the paths.

>examine stone well
 All I understood was a wish to examine the stone altar.

>examine well
 It is an old, neglected well made of stones. It's nearly invisible
 among the long dry grass dying bushes that surround it.
 Something touches Lornedei's foot. She pulls her leg away from the
 grasping root with a shriek.

>examine beetle
 It's a black beetle as big as Lornedei's hand from antenna tip to end.
 The hard shell shimmers in shades of red and green.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.

>where beetle
 All I understood was a wish to where.

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>left
 "Master? I don't understand."

>go left
 Lornedei takes a couple of steps towards the dark trail, glancing
 nervously up at the trees. Then she takes a deep breath before moving
 forward. The shadows of the forbidden forest fall on her.
 She walks without sun as guidance or aim to where she is going.
 The path twists and turns and soon she is cursing her own
 thoughtlessness. The prickling sensation of a forgotten spirit's hatred
 sinks down on her like a heavy blanket.
 Her feet feel strangely heavy and clumsy, as if the undergrowth hinders
 her movement. However there is nothing growing on the path. It is
 empty. Flat and hard-packed, it should be easy to walk on.
 A somewhat stronger light appears further ahead and with a soft sob of
 relief Lornedei starts running towards the clearing.
 She stops with the beginning of a smile freezing on her lips.
 The clearing is dark, a stone well gurgles softly, and three paths
 disappear into the forbidden forest.
 The beetle scrambles through the dead grass to one of the paths. It
 spins around and comes back to Lornedei.

>reach right path
 Lornedei closes her eyes, letting the unseen take over. Nothing. The
 scorched trees stand guard over the withered undergrowth, the rocks,
 the fallen trees,...but not one single trail.
 She turns her attention to the next passage, and then the final one,
 but there is nothing except the forest hiding its secrets even from
 Lornedei's magic eye.
 She opens her eyes, blinking a few times to make sure. Yes, there they
 are.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 176.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a small leather pouch (which is open)
     a golden acorn
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries
   A brightly shining fairy lamp with a crystal spider inside
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a purple nut with thorns
     a piece of cheese
     a loaf of horrid bread
 "Master?"

>SAVE
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>put nut on altar
 She needs to be holding the purple nut with thorns before she can put
 it on top of something else.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.
 The beetle disappears into the crumbling stone house. It comes back
 out, stays a moment in the opening, waving its antennae, before coming
 back to Lornedei.
 Lornedei stares at the leaf clusters in the black forest. She looks
 away, biting her lower lip.

>take nut. put nut on altar
 Lornedei carefully takes the nut, holding it with two fingers by one of
 the thorns. That way she won't get hurt.
 She puts the purple nut with thorns on the stone altar.

>look

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly. The shadows beneath them
 seem to grow momentarily, but when Lornedei Looks at them the movement
 stops.

 On the stone altar is a purple nut with thorns.

 She can also see a large black beetle (Spinning around waving its
 antennae at the moment.) here.

>take nut
 Lornedei carefully picks up the nut. She quickly drops it in the
 rucksack.
 The beetle scrambles through the dead grass to one of the paths. It
 spins around and comes back to Lornedei.

>follow beetle
 The black beetle is still for a few moments. Sniffing the air for
 danger. Then suddenly it decides where to go and takes off along one of
 the paths. Lornedei follows.

 Shadows reach for her, imaginary or not, from the growing darkness
 between the trees, as she moves into the forbidden forest. The beetle
 is ahead of her, leading on, stopping now and then to find its way. The
 path twists and changes direction so many times that Lornedei has to
 rely totally on her glimmering little guide.

 Lornedei keeps her eye on the bug, but looks around now and then. The
 trees all look the same. No matter which kind they might have been
 originally, they are now all black and scorched. Clusters of leaves,
 singing their strange melody, hang from nearly all of them, some nearly
 touching the undergrowth. The forest is cold, the air thick, and
 Cowering under the stare of the shadows, she moves on. The bug leads.
 It runs ahead, over a dry and cracked puddle of mud, through the
 hollowed out insides of a dead tree, forward.

 The beetle stops. Its antennae wave frantically and it spins around on
 the ground a couple of times. When Lornedei reaches down to pick it up
 it quickly unfolds its wings, takes off with a buzzing and disappears
 among the trees.

 Forbidden Forest (Near the Raven Tree)
 Disappointed, Lornedei looks around.
 "I think I am lost."
 The scorched trees tower over anyone and anything unfortunate enough to
 be here. An air of ill will hangs over the treetops.
 The gray fog touches the trees highest branches, hiding the sun from
 view. Two paths lead into the black forest from here.
 Lornedei sighs.

 An enormous raven sits high up on a blackened branch, surrounded by the
 bug like leaves. It stares unblinking at Lornedei as she moves around
 in the crossing. It greets her with a threatening flutter with the
 wings, a guttural croaking and constant nervous sidestepping on the
 branch.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>reach raven
 In the moment she reaches the bird with her mind, she is pushed
 backwards by an unknown force. She loses the connection.
 The bird croaks as it shakes the unwelcome intrusion from its mind.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>undo
 Forbidden Forest (Near the Raven Tree)
 Let it be so!

>give cheese to raven
 (Taking the piece of cheese first.)
 The piece of cheese does not seem to interest the bird.

>put cheese in sack
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine raven
 A large black bird with a shaggy, iridescent plumage. It never moves
 its gaze far from the trespasser. Every move she makes results in a
 nervous side step, a twitching in the wedge-shaped tail and a curious
 tilt of the black head.

>put cheese in rucksack
 She drops the piece of cheese into the leather rucksack.

>examine tree
 These trees all look dead at first sight. Scorched and tortured, they
 reach out their blackened limbs over the cowering undergrowth. They do
 have leaves, however, not green and lush but almost black.

>examine branch
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>exits
  She can try following one of the paths.

>examine fog
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>talk to raven
 "I cannot talk to animals Master. Besides that, I am sure that a thing
 like that has nothing but nasty things to say."
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>examine branch
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>show plaque to raven
 The small gray plaque does not interest the bird. It just keeps on
 sidestepping.

>follow raven
 Follow the bird? The black bird is not going anywhere at the moment.
 Perhaps it needs some incentive.

>give bread to raven
 (Taking the loaf of horrid bread first.)
 The loaf of horrid bread does not seem to interest the bird.

>give acorn to raven
 Really? the golden acorn?

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]
 The golden acorn does not interest the bird. It just keeps on
 sidestepping.

>examine acorn
 It is an acorn in shape and form but it seems to be one in solid gold.

>give nut to raven
 Really? the purple nut with thorns?
 Lornedei carefully takes the nut, holding it with two fingers by one of
 the thorns. That way she won't get hurt.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>put nut in rucksack
 She drops the purple nut with thorns into the leather rucksack.
 A dry black leaf drops down on Lornedei's shoulder. With a grimace, she
 flicks it with a finger to get rid of it.

>take leaf
 Lornedei grabs one of the black leaves in the nearest cluster and
 twists it loose from the branch. The leaf falls over and the beetle
 quickly takes shape in her hand. When it is done growing, it crawls up
 on Lornedei's shoulder.
>take leaf
 She already woke one beetle. There's no need to wake another one.

>caw
 "Master? I don't understand."

>pet raven
 "I fail to see a point in what you ask!"
 A dry black leaf falls to the ground next to her. A gust of wind
 catches it and carries it away.

>heal raven
 "There is nothing wrong with that bird Master."

>catch raven
 "Master? I don't understand."

>get raven
 The bird is too far up in the tree; it will not come close enough to be
 caught.

>climb tree
 There's no way she could.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>dig
 (the raven)
 The ground is too hard to dig in this place.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.
 A dry black leaf falls to the ground next to her. A gust of wind
 catches it and carries it away.

>what raven
 The raven seems healthy enough.

>examine sandal
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>where raven
 All I understood was a wish to where.

>pray
 She does. Every night. You taught her well.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 176.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a large black beetle (Spinning around waving its antennae at the
 moment.)
   a golden acorn
   a loaf of horrid bread
   a small leather pouch (which is open but empty)
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries
   A brightly shining fairy lamp with a crystal spider inside
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a purple nut with thorns
     a piece of cheese
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>give crystal to raven
 (the amulet to the raven)
 The amulet does not interest the bird. It just keeps on sidestepping.
 A dry black leaf falls to the ground next to her. A gust of wind
 catches it and carries it away.

>rub crystal
 (the amulet)
 There is no need for her to do that.

>read plaque
 It is a small round plaque in a material unknown to Lornedei. The
 surface is smooth and with a deep polish. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's hand. The surface shows nothing, not even the distorted
 image of Lornedei herself that one might expect. What shows in the
 plaque is like a reflection of a stormy sky in a puddle of murky water,
 just before the rain starts hammering.

>holiness
 Your current holiness is 30 out of a possible holiness of 105, in 173
 moves.

>look

 Forbidden Forest (Near the Raven Tree)
 The gray fog touches the trees highest branches, hiding the sun from
 view. Two paths lead into the black forest from here.
 Lornedei sighs.

 An enormous raven sits high up on a blackened branch, surrounded by the
 bug like leaves. It stares unblinking at Lornedei as she moves around
 in the crossing. It greets her with a threatening flutter with the
 wings, a guttural croaking and constant nervous sidestepping on the
 branch.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>point lamp at branch
 "Master? I don't understand."

>rub ball
 Lornedei polishes the fairy lamp some more. The light remains the same.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>look into ball
 In the fairy lamp is a crystal spider.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>watch spider
 She can't quite see what it looks like as long as it's trapped inside
 the lamp. She'll have to free it somehow.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>twist ball
 Lornedei turns the fairy lamp in her hand. The crystal spider jerks to
 life in there and taps angrily at the inside of its prison.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>feel ball
 "It is very cold. It feels almost like ice but it does not melt in my
 hand."
 "What should I do?"

>give beetle to raven
 Lornedei holds the beetle in a tight grip, and shows it to the bird.
 The black bird leans its head to one side. Most interested, it moves
 restlessly on its branch. Lornedei slowly puts the beetle on the
 ground. She steps back and waits.

 The beetle turns towards Lornedei, turns back, notices the bird and
 makes a run for it. It heads for the high grass. The hungry bird dives
 from the tree and drops in a cloud of dirt between the bug and the safe
 undergrowth. The beetle stops dead in its track, changes direction and
 rushes forward, but the bird is already there, flipping the bug over.
 For one moment, it is immobilized. That moment is enough.

 While the beetle is helpless, the bird gets to the eating. Big chunks
 of the insect's body is ripped out and swallowed. At some point, the
 legs and antennae stop moving. Finally, there is nothing left of the
 beetle but an empty shell, lined with a few sad remains of legs, flesh,
 and unidentifiable insect parts.

 The bird skips along the path where, if one looks hard enough, one can
 see another trail. The bird turns to Lornedei and croaks.
 Waiting.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>take leaf
 Lornedei grabs one of the black leaves in the nearest cluster and
 twists it loose from the branch. The leaf falls over and the beetle
 quickly takes shape in her hand. When it is done growing, it crawls up
 on Lornedei's shoulder. Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like a
 bird, unlike any other.

>tap on ball
 "Master? I don't understand."

>follow raven
 Lornedei dares a careful step towards the black bird. It turns and hops
 along the path a short distance before it again faces the girl.
 Waiting.

 Lornedei takes another step and the bird takes off in the air. It flies
 in circles in front of her, high up and almost out of sight at times
 but always close enough for Lornedei to follow. The path winds its way
 through and around the disturbing shadows of the forbidden forest.
 Fallen trees and dense undergrowth is constantly in her way and she has
 to climb over, through, or around these obstacles, while keeping an eye
 on the bird. It is just ahead and above her. She follows the black
 bird, expecting the cold grip of the forgotten ones around her ankles
 at any moment. Images of soul wrenching, flesh ripping, and blood
 drinking spirits run through her mind. Nothing happens. Exhausted and
 bruised, with her clothes torn and dusty, she stumbles on.

 Something grabs her foot; she loses her balance and falls forward with
 a painful thud. Frozen in a breathless heap on the ground, she takes a
 moment to gather her strength as well as her breath. The bird croaks,
 Light seeps in through her closed eyelids.

 She looks up in time to catch a final glimpse of the bird. It
 disappears into a glowing sunset beyond a desolate field.

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Slowly Lornedei gets up on her feet. Nearly blinded by the light from
 the dying sun, she inspects the damage. She sighs deeply.

 She opens her mouth to speak again but the words never come. She takes
 in the view of this seemingly empty wasteland in shocked silence for
 some time. She swallows. A dry wind tugs at her clothing while playing
 restlessly in the dry ground.
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>go east

 Wasteland (By the Circle of Stones)
 Lornedei walks east and the ground slopes down. It becomes increasingly
 difficult to walk. On the other side of the valley she is entering, the
 forest resumes. At the bottom of the slope where the sharp rocks slip
 under her feet, heat ripples the air. Lornedei makes her way down.

 This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden
 forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her
 out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces
 across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken
 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.

 There is a fire inside the ring of stones, blasting out heat and light.
 Shadows cast by the stones stretch out from the circle. Their wavering
 tips caress the ragged ground where it begins to ascend to the plane
 above.

 A black plaque lies near the center of the fire pit.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>examine black plaque
 The plaque is too close to the flames, she cannot get near it without
 setting herself on fire.

>jump flames
 All I understood was a wish to jump.

>examine circle
 The circle is almost ten paces wide. Inside the edging of boulders, the
 ground sinks further down, into another bowl. This one is smooth and
 perfectly round.

>enter circle
 Lornedei glances questioningly at the circle of stones. That is not
 something that she can enter.

>enter circle
 Lornedei glances questioningly at the circle of stones. That is not
 something that she can enter.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like a
 wolf. Yes, a wolf, but it's far away.

>howl
 "Master? I don't understand."

>call wolf
 All I understood was a wish to call.

>reach fire
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>call
 Lornedei whistles but does Deini want to come to her?

>reach circle
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>reach stone
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>put plaque in fire
 (the small gray plaque in the Blazing fire)
 This fire needs no fuel. Never mind burning up her inventory.
 A dry black leaf falls to the ground next to her. A gust of wind
 catches it and carries it away.

>examine crystal
 (the amulet)
 It's a pale blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like a
 bird, unlike any other.

>wear chain
 Lornedei hangs the amulet around her neck. Immediately it flares up and
 shines brightly. The blinding light fades somewhat and the light
 becomes soft and steady. Lornedei shivers in delight from the power in
 the crystal that gives itself to her.

 Lornedei's magic just went up by one hundred.

>reach black plaque
 Lornedei just shrugs. There doesn't seem to be anything she can learn
 about the plaque.

>reach fire
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>reach jenny brennan
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>reach amulet
 A golden haired woman walks across the courtyard of a long lost castle.
 A young lad in a brown tunic with a wooden sword in hand immediately
 interrupts his training to bow respectfully as she passes.
 An exhausted but smiling young woman lies in a bed with an infant in
 her arms. The blue light reflected in the child's so far unseeing eyes
 comes from a crystal hanging around the new mother's neck.
 A white haired old woman reaches into her robe to hold up a shining
 blue crystal hanging on a silver chain. She pulls it over her head and
 hands it to the girl kneeling before her on the stone floor.
 Generation after generation passes by in Lornedei's mind. Fleeing
 images of the many bearers, the many powerful women yielding respect
 and sometimes fear, but never hatred.
 Not until the final image.
 The amulet is thrown carelessly on top of a broken and bloody mess
 lying against cold stone. This very wall.
 Lornedei shivers and lets go of the crystal.


>get crystal
 (the amulet)
 She already has that.

>dig
 What do you want Lornedei to dig?

>ground
 (the ground)
 Lornedei digs a hole in the dry ground.

>plant acorn
 "Master! Nothing can grow here." She picks up a handful of dirt but
 drops it again with a grimace.
 "This soil is poisoned, I can feel it."

>go west

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 A high pitched squeal from somewhere among the blackened trees fills
 the air, and Lornedei shudders.

>go northwest

 Castle Courtyard
 Lornedei steps in-between a big wall that continues north, away from
 her, and the remains of another wall trailing west. What stands before
 her is only a small part of a castle. The rest of it, including any
 main gate or towers, is gone, as if cut away. She stops and looks
 around.

 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 Lornedei enters a long stone hall. The sudden noise of her own foot
 falls echoing makes her stop after just a few steps. She stands just
 inside the gate. The corridor is dim and it takes a while for her eyes
 to adjust to the darkness.
 The wide stone corridor continues north for perhaps sixty feet and
 there is a dim light at the far end.
 She takes a few more steps forward through the dusty corridor. She
 stops at an opening in the wall where a staircase leads down into
 darkness.

>go north
 Lornedei walks towards the dim light. The corridor ends, the floor
 drops away, and beyond is the mist. The edge of the cliff itself has
 dropped off, taking the entire inner castle down with it. The entire
 northwest corner of the big ledge has slid down to the bottom of the
 ravine.

 Lornedei takes a quick look down the ravine, through veils of mist, but
 the floor suddenly feels very unsteady under her feet. She returns to
 the opening to the staircase.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 Lornedei leans into the opening in the wall, trying to see what is
 below the dark staircase. There is light down there. Without further
 hesitation, she descends the dusty stone steps.

 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

>examine statue
 The stone statue stands against the south wall. It seems undamaged by
 what ever happened here. It is a woman. She is dressed in a guard's
 robust clothing and she is standing with her feet somewhat apart, one
 arm bent to let her hand rest on a stone dagger at her waist.
 The statue is holding up its right arm as if holding something, perhaps
 a staff or a spear, but the hand is empty. The stone woman looks as if
 she could wake up at any moment, ready to protect.
 The polished stone eyes are fixed on something in the northeast corner
 of the chamber.

>examine ne
 Cracked marble in walls and floor. Rubble. Nothing of interest catches
 her eye.

>go northeast
 Lornedei takes a few steps to take a look at the corner but a fair bit
 of the wall has cracked and fallen. There is nothing to see but rubble.

>search rubble
 Lornedei scratches her head, looking at the mountain of rubble.
 "If I could get through this first pile of blocks, then maybe, I am not
 sure I can though. I am going to need some help."

>go up

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go south

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.

>climb wall
 There is no way she can get up on the wall. It is too high and there
 are no handholds.

>go north
 She should not venture too far into this scarred landscape. Beyond is
 the mist, where she would be lost. Lornedei turns back.

>se

 Wasteland (By the Circle of Stones)
 This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden
 forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her
 out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces
 across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken
 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.

 There is a fire inside the ring of stones, blasting out heat and light.
 Shadows cast by the stones stretch out from the circle. Their wavering
 tips caress the ragged ground where it begins to ascend to the plane
 above.

 A black plaque lies near the center of the fire pit.

 She can also see a small hole in the hard ground (which is empty) here.

>go north

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.

>examine tree
 These are scattered remains of a tree. Mostly ashes, a few charred
 branches, a hollowed out trunk lying on its side, all petrified by time
 and lack of rain. All is covered in years of sand.

>heal tree
 There is nothing left here that can be healed. The tree is long since
 dead.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>reach tree
 Lornedei puts her hand on the petrified wood. She shuts her eyes.
 Suddenly, the air is fresh with a scent of damp soil, grass and the new
 flowers of spring. Golden leaves tremble on silver limbs. Rooted deep
 in fertile soil, cared for, held in awe, the golden oak waits.

 Soft grass beneath bare feet, feet tredding silently towards the great
 oak, but stopping to wait at the proper distance. A mumble, a nervous
 questioning, a whispered reply. A moment of silence. A silver cup
 carried the last two steps to the roots below the tree.

 A trickle of water, a new light bearer's gift, then the acceptance of
 it, knowing the young one is true and strong. A golden acorn drops to
 the ground.

 Ages has passed, eons of repeated procedures, of dying and re-birth.
 The golden oak feels no fear, no regret, knowing that after this life,
 it will come again. The light bearers will plant the acorn and the
 spiral of life will turn once more. It is soon time. Very soon.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>dig ground
 (the ground)
 Lornedei digs a hole in the dry ground.
 "Master?"

>look in trunk
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>plant acorn
 "Master! Nothing can grow here." She picks up a handful of dirt but
 drops it again with a grimace.
 "This soil is poisoned, I can feel it."

>search tree
 Lornedei looks around, in the trunk, kicks away some dirt, but all she
 finds is more sad remains of the tree. Anything of interest is long
 since gone.

>reach grass
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go west

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.
 "What should I do?"

>go west

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>go south

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Ravine)
 Lornedei stands on an outcropping overlooking a deep ravine going as
 far north as she can see. The ledge seems to be the remains of a road,
 cut off by the creation of the break in the earth. On the other side of
 the ravine, there's a barely visible opening through the trees. There
 is no way over there though. A steady wind tears at her clothes and
 hair in sudden gusts that seem eager to throw her off balance.

 East, northeast and north are the ways off the ledge.

>go northeast

 east side of the east wall.

>go west
 A few paces away, the courtyard ends abruptly as the ground is replaced
 by the ravine. A vertical cliff of bare rock is all that is left. If
 there was a western wall there, it now lies at the bottom of the
 ravine, along with a big part of the castle. On the other side, the
 forbidden forest starts again. Lornedei quickly backs away from the
 edge.

 East, northeast and north are the ways off the ledge.

>go west
 Lornedei takes one step towards the edge of the ravine, then another
 longer step away from it. The ravine is too deep and too wide to cross.
 Lornedei turns her head towards a sudden rustling in the forbidden
 forest. There is nothing there.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

>go west
 Lornedei steps closer to the huge hole in the wall. One glimpse down is
 enough. She steps back on unsteady legs.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 376.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a large black beetle (Taking a nap at the moment.)
   a golden acorn
   a loaf of horrid bread
   a small leather pouch (which is open but empty)
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries

>reach ravine
 She cannot reach things from such a distance.

>examine forest
 These trees all look dead at first sight. Scorched and tortured, they
 reach out their blackened limbs over the cowering undergrowth. They do
 have leaves, however, not green and lush but almost black.

>go south
 The forbidden forest stands guard. There is no way through it.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like
 something that does not want to be heard. Careful, tentative.

>listen
 There is nothing here to listen to but the constant wind.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.
 A dry black leaf falls to the ground next to her. A gust of wind
 catches it and carries it away.

>go northeast

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.

 She can see a small hole in the hard ground (which is empty) here.

 Wasteland (By the Circle of Stones)
 This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden
 forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her
 out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces
 across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken
 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.

 There is a fire inside the ring of stones, blasting out heat and light.
 Shadows cast by the stones stretch out from the circle. Their wavering
 tips caress the ragged ground where it begins to ascend to the plane
 above.

 A black plaque lies near the center of the fire pit.

 The forbidden forest stands guard as if regretting giving passage. She
 is lucky to have made it through at all. Now there is no way back. She
 can however go east, west, northeast, northwest, and north.

>blow ball
 "Master?"

>knock on ball
 "Master? I don't understand."

>hit ball
 "Perhaps. There might be a way but violence is not the answer."
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like a
 wolf. Yes, a wolf, but it's far away.

>shake ball
 "Master? I don't understand."

>examine nut
 A purple nut from the deformed bushes in the hall of severance. It is
 deep purple and hosts a number of sharp thorns.

 The heat forces her back.

 She does. Every night. You taught her well.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.
 A dry black leaf falls to the ground next to her. A gust of wind
 catches it and carries it away.

>heal fire
 Healing drains too much power. That would be a waste.

>throw dirt on fire
 She needs to be holding the ground before she can put it on top of
 something else.
 "What should I do?"

>take dirt
 Lornedei picks up a handful of dry soil. Frowning, she lets it scatter.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 376.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a large black beetle (Airing out its shell at the moment.)
   a golden acorn
   a loaf of horrid bread
   a small leather pouch (which is open but empty)
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries
   A brightly shining fairy lamp with a crystal spider inside
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a purple nut with thorns
     a piece of cheese

>toast bread
 "Master? I don't understand."

>examine spider
 She can't quite see what it looks like as long as it's trapped inside
 the lamp. She'll have to free it somehow.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>throw ball into fire
 Lornedei throws the fairy lamp into the fire. There is a loud whistling
 and the fire grows. After a short while, a crystal spider comes
 crawling out of the flames and the fire returns to normal.

 The spider stops for a moment between the fire and the boulder closest
 to Lornedei.
 It bobs up and down a couple of times as if working the stiffness out
 of its long legs, then it sprints out of the pit. The spider stops at
 her feet, turns around once and curls itself up into a ball.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine spider
 It's a large spider made of crystal. It has curled up as if either dead
 or sleeping most of the time. It is hard to tell which. It gives off a
 cold sparkling light and has a pair of multi facetted eyes. Oddly
 enough, the eyes seem both beady and shifty. No matter from where it is
 observed, it seems to glare suspiciously. She will have to touch the
 spider to examine it further. That is, if it will let her.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>jar spider
 "Master? I don't understand."

>touch spider
 Lornedei reaches for the spider and it actually lets her investigate.
 She carefully holds one leg and the spider lets her flex it
 experimentally before resolutely pulling it away from her. The spider
 is cold and strangely flexible. It seems to be able to appear as hard
 as the crystal it is at will, just to move around like any other spider
 the next moment. It is however staring suspiciously at her, wondering
 what this touchy feely thing is all about.

>take spider
 The spider reluctantly steps up on her hand.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine boulder
 The circle is almost ten paces wide. Inside the edging of boulders, the
 ground sinks further down, into another bowl. This one is smooth and
 perfectly round.

>enter circle
 Lornedei glances questioningly at the circle of stones. That is not
 something that she can enter.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>examine plaque
 (the small black plaque)
 The plaque is too close to the flames, she cannot get near it without
 setting herself on fire.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>push boulder
 Lornedei puts one shoulder against one of the big stones, digs her
 heels in and pushes. It flips over and rolls down in the fire pit. The
 stone settles on top of the blazing fire that immediately suffocates
 and dies.

 "BUZZ! BUZZ!" The firefly sits on one of the big stones in the circle.
 "Oh, dear, much gooder I say. Too hot, much too hot it was here. Good
 job Girl. Now I can... " The fly crawls down the side of the rock and
 disappears in a small hole in the ground. A tiny voice pipes up from
 some kind of hollow down below. "Oh, still hot, Most uncomfortable it
 is but... yes!" From the hole comes intense buzzing and grunting
 followed by huffing an puffing and a cloud of dust. The fly comes out
 of the hole that caves in on itself, dragging something. "Ah, I knew it
 would be ready, long cooking it needs yes."

 With more buzzing and grunting, the fly takes off. Hanging in a tiny
 netting seemingly made of fine grass or some other kind of plant fiber,
 is a well baked, somewhat wrinkled white berry. It is still warm and
 steam rises from it. With no further waste of breath, the fly along
 with its hot meal, disappears with a pop and a flash. The scent of
 baked berry lingers for a moment until it dissipates.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine netting
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>smell
>examine baked berry
 "I can smell nothing here but dust Master. The air is dead and dry."

 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>read plaque
 (the small black plaque)
 It's a totally black round plaque. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's palm. The smooth stone is of a kind that Lornedei has never
 seen. A strange picture is carved on one side. It looks like a flying
 insect of some sort, with a giant tree in the background.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

 As you wish.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

 Nothing happens.

 Lornedei just shrugs. There doesn't seem to be anything she can learn
 about the plaque.

 "This soil is poisoned, I can feel it."

 The fire is already extinguished. There is no need to push any more
 boulders.

>go west

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 A high pitched squeal from somewhere among the blackened trees fills
 the air, and Lornedei shudders.

>go north

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.

>go north
 She should not venture too far into this scarred landscape. Beyond is
 the mist, where she would be lost. Lornedei turns back.

>go west

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>examine debris
 Sad remains of a once great building. Blocks of stone that once made up
 the walls, smaller rocks, old faded pieces of wood, dust and gravel. A
 precariously stacked pile is blocking the way northeast.Everything is
 covered in years of sand that has drifted in from the dry fields.

>move it
 That is not possible.

>search debris
 Lornedei scratches her head, looking at the mountain of rubble.
 "If I could get through this first pile of blocks, then maybe, I am not
 sure I can though. I am going to need some help."

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the

 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

>drop spider
 Your wish is her command.

>spider, x debris
 The spider straightens to show its maximum height. It taps one of its
 legs against another and turns away. It is clearly beneath a creature
 of light to obey common humans.

>move statue
 The stone statue cannot be moved in any way. Lornedei makes a couple of
 attempts of pushing the statue but there is not much point in trying.

>examine eyes
 Beautiful blue eyes dominate her pale and quite thin face. So far, it
 has that innocent glow that will fade with time and experience.
 For the most part her lips are tightened into a disapproving line. It
 is most likely an unconscious imitation of her step mother but when she
 does smile her face changes drastically and she looks like the child
 she is.

>give beetle to spider
 The spider stretches out to its full height and pokes the beetle in the
 eye. The bug gives off a high-pitch squeal and crawls in under
 Lornedei's hair.

>give acorn to statue
 Lornedei drops the acorn in the hand. After falling halfway through, it
 stops. The stone hand has turned into a fist. The stone limbs crackle
 slightly as the hand turns palm side down. After a moment, the fingers
 flex jerkily and opens. The acorn drops to the floor. The hand turns
 back to holding its imaginary item.

>get acorn
 As you wish.

>take acorn and spider
 crystal spider: The spider reluctantly steps up on her hand.

>give plaque to statue
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the small black plaque or the small
 gray plaque?

>black
 Lornedei looks at the small black plaque. She looks at the hole in the
 stone hand. She looks at you, smiles a little, and shakes her head.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 376.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   A crystal spider with shifty, beady eyes (Polishing its underside at
 the moment.)
   a golden acorn
   a small black plaque
   a large black beetle (Airing out its shell at the moment.)
   a loaf of horrid bread
   a small leather pouch (which is open but empty)
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a purple nut with thorns
     a piece of cheese
 "Master?"

>examine statue
 The stone statue stands against the south wall. It seems undamaged by
 what ever happened here. It is a woman. She is dressed in a guard's
 robust clothing and she is standing with her feet somewhat apart, one
 arm bent to let her hand rest on a stone dagger at her waist.
 The statue is holding up its right arm as if holding something, perhaps
 a staff or a spear, but the hand is empty. The stone woman looks as if
 she could wake up at any moment, ready to protect.
 The polished stone eyes are fixed on something in the northeast corner
 of the chamber.
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

>reach statue
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>examine dagger
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>pretty sure
 "Master? I don't understand."

>give spider to statue
 Lornedei looks at the crystal spider. She looks at the hole in the
 stone hand. She looks at you, smiles a little, and shakes her head.

>give berry to statue
 Lornedei looks at the handful of white berries. She looks at the hole
 in the stone hand. She looks at you, smiles a little, and shakes her
 head.

>give acorn to statue
 Lornedei drops the acorn in the hand. After falling halfway through, it
 stops. The stone hand has turned into a fist. The stone limbs crackle
 slightly as the hand turns palm side down. After a moment, the fingers
 flex jerkily and opens. The acorn drops to the floor. The hand turns
 back to holding its imaginary item.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>take acorn
 As you wish.

>give nut to statue
 Really? the purple nut with thorns?
 Lornedei carefully takes the nut, holding it with two fingers by one of
 the thorns. That way she won't get hurt.

>go south
 There is nothing there but rubble and cracked marble walls. She can't
 go that way.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>go up

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go south

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.

>go south

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 A high pitched squeal from somewhere among the blackened trees fills
 the air, and Lornedei shudders.

>go northeast

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.

>examine remains
 These are scattered remains of a tree. Mostly ashes, a few charred
 branches, a hollowed out trunk lying on its side, all petrified by time
 and lack of rain. All is covered in years of sand.
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

>get branch
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>enter trunk
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>get ashes
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go southwest

 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.

>go west

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Ravine)
 Lornedei stands on an outcropping overlooking a deep ravine going as
 far north as she can see. The ledge seems to be the remains of a road,
 cut off by the creation of the break in the earth. On the other side of
 the ravine, there's a barely visible opening through the trees. There
 is no way over there though. A steady wind tears at her clothes and
 hair in sudden gusts that seem eager to throw her off balance.

 East, northeast and north are the ways off the ledge.

>cry
 "Master? I don't understand."

>examine ledge
 Some things in this world are not for her to be concerned with.

>examine opening
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go north

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>examine facade
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>climb debris
 There's no way she could.
 "Master?"

>examine ravine
 The ravine ends here only twenty paces or so to the south, where it
 narrows and meets the forbidden forest. It stretches north, past the
 old ruins, beyond which it disappears in a wall of mist. A deep cut in
 the earth, more than a stone-throw across and deeper than is
 comfortable to even consider.
 "Master?"

>enter ravine
 Lornedei moves closer to the edge. Against better knowledge she looks
 down. Immediately she retreats to safe ground.

>talk to spider
 The spider's shifty, beady eyes seem both shiftier and more beady. It
 has nothing to say though.

>stroke spider
 "I fail to see a point in what you ask!"

>ask spider about itself
 The spider stares suspiciously at her. It is beneath a creature of
 light to indulge in conversation with lower beings.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go north
 Lornedei walks towards the dim light. The corridor ends, the floor
 drops away, and beyond is the mist. The edge of the cliff itself has
 dropped off, taking the entire inner castle down with it. The entire
 northwest corner of the big ledge has slid down to the bottom of the
 ravine.

 Lornedei takes a quick look down the ravine, through veils of mist, but
 the floor suddenly feels very unsteady under her feet. She returns to
 the opening to the staircase.

>go northwest
 Lornedei takes one step but stops. She cannot go there.  She can go
 south or down.

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

>reach nut
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>give nut to statue
 Lornedei looks at the purple nut with thorns. She looks at the hole in
 the stone hand. She looks at you, smiles a little, and shakes her head.

>feed spider

>feed cheese to spider
 (Taking the piece of cheese first.)
 The spider pokes the piece of cheese with some interest. The curiosity
 doesn't last long though and the spider returns to its suspicious
 glaring.

>kiss statue
 Lornedei ignores you. she has no time for nonsense.

>search statue
 She can not find anything that might interest you.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 376.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a piece of cheese

   a loaf of horrid bread
   a small leather pouch (which is open but empty)
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)

>climb statue
 Lornedei takes a closer look at the stone woman's head and shoulders,
 the walls and the ceiling behind and above her, but decides against it.

>eat nut
 That's simply not edible!

>feed bread to statue
 Lornedei looks at the loaf of horrid bread. She looks at the hole in
 the stone hand. She looks at you, smiles a little, and shakes her head.

>hint
 The firefly appears. it buzzes around Lornedei's head.
 "Me, yes, has come to help! Now hurry and ask!"

>tell firefly to buzz off
 This critter is not much for conversation.

>go up

 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 "I must go, yes I must. The firefly disappears with a pop and a flash.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>throw nut into ravine
 Lornedei throws the nut over the edge. A sudden gust of wind grabs it.
 After dancing around in the air for a few moments, it drops down at her
 feet.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>get nut
 Lornedei carefully picks up the nut. She quickly drops it in the
 rucksack.

>throw acorn into ravine
 "No Master. I think I should hold on to this."

>jump ravine
 All I understood was a wish to jump.

>score
 Your current holiness is 60 out of a possible holiness of 105, in 352
 moves.

>open nut
 That's not something that can be opened.
 "Master?"

>crack nut
 Never mind having her wreck her inventory, unless it is truly called
 for.

>examine pouch
 It is a dry and withered leather pouch, no bigger than a woman's fist.
 A leather string is used to close it and hang it in a belt.

>take string
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>put acorn in pouch
 She drops the golden acorn into the small leather pouch.

>okay, so the string and pouch aren't separable.
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

 cut off by the creation of the break in the earth. On the other side of
 the ravine, there's a barely visible opening through the trees. There
 is no way over there though. A steady wind tears at her clothes and

 East, northeast and north are the ways off the ledge.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>go east

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 A dry black leaf falls to the ground next to her. A gust of wind
 catches it and carries it away.

>put gray plaque on black plaque.
 Placing things on the small black plaque will not do her any good.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like a
 wolf. Yes, a wolf, but it's far away.

>go south
 The forbidden forest stands guard as if regretting giving passage. She
 is lucky to have made it through at all. Now there is no way back. She
 can however go east, west, northeast, northwest, and north.

>go west

 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

 "Master? I don't understand."

>search trees
 She can't find anything that might interest you besides those leaves.
 They are the only thing close enough for her to reach without entering
 the shadows.

>reach spider
 She is surrounded by crimson light. Intense, dancing light streaked
 with strands of pure dark. Greasy suffocating smoke, then a flash of
 blinding white, Deafening thunder of falling rocks. Then nothing.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the Circle of Stones)
 This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden
 forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her
 out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces
 across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken
 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A big round stone lies in the middle of the pit. The fire is gone.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.

 She can also see a small hole in the hard ground (which is empty) here.

>examine tone
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine round stone
 It's a big round stone from the circle. It was pushed into the fire pit
 to suffocate the flames.
 Lornedei looks over her shoulder into the dark forest, anxious.

>go east
 The forbidden forest stands guard above the rim of the bowl she is in.
 She can get back to the field by going north, west, or northwest.

>get stone
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the big round boulder or the circle
 of stones?

>circle
 You are the almighty here. Lornedei does not have that kind of
 strength.
 Lornedei turns her head towards a sudden rustling in the forbidden
 forest. There is nothing there.

>go north

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)

 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry

 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the

 dwelled in gray mist.

 There is no way she can get up on the wall. It is too high and there
 are no handholds.

 "Master?"

>climb wall
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the eastern wall or the walls?

>walls
 There's no way she could.

>climb eastern wall
 There is no way she can get up on the wall. It is too high and there
 are no handholds.

>reach castle
 A great castle stands before Lornedei. A massive gate leading into the
 castle is to the northwest, The south wall with another gate runs west,
 parallel to the castle wall. The corridor between the inner and outer
 gate lies open to the west. There it meets the west wall that
 disappears around the corner and out of site. The courtyard is still,
 silent, peaceful, and empty.

 There is a shadow though, barely perceptible, but the longer Lornedei
 looks, the clearer it gets. It is creeping across the stones. A moving
 darkness that emerges from the air itself creeps across the stone to
 melt into a crack in a stone or a mortar joint. It glides over the
 ground until sinking between the flagstones.

 Then the world breaks.

 Although the images are old, the time long ago, the earth seems to
 shake under her feet. A woman runs past her, fleeing through deadly
 projectiles dislodged from falling towers, towards the main gate.
 Holding her arms above her head, she stumbles and falls. The moment
 after, the ground disappears ahead of her. The ground moves, cracks,
 and slides away as she is scrambling back. The woman gets up on her
 feet, staggers before regaining some balance, and backs away from the
 opening in the earth that was not there a moment ago. The castle cracks
 as the ground, solid stone, disappears beneath it. The south wall
 crumbles into piles of stone. Everything starting at an imagined line
 drawn between the two great gates and beyond them, drops away through a
 cloud of smoke and dust.

 An enormous cloud of dust spews out of the ravine, and even though
 Lornedei knows it is only in her mind, she coughs.

 The images fade.
 Lornedei's magic drops by one.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>go northwest
 The front wall of the castle ends there in a jagged edge. The rest of
 it is at the bottom of the ravine. There is no way of knowing how big
 the castle might have been before. Lornedei takes a quick look over the
 edge of the ravine. It is too far down to see anything clearly and she
 retreats.

>examine walls
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the walls or the old castle ruins?

>walls
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the walls or the old castle ruins?

>examine the walls
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the walls or the old castle ruins?

>castle
 Only two walls remain of a once big castle. Those walls seem strong and
 reach up into a ceiling of mist far above her head. Lornedei is
 surrounded by rubble. A small opening leads into the building to the
 north.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>move rubble
 That is not possible.

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 374.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a piece of cheese
   A crystal spider with shifty, beady eyes (Stretching out, apparently
 snoozing at the moment.)
   a small black plaque
   a large black beetle (Taking a nap at the moment.)
   a loaf of horrid bread
   a small leather pouch (which is open)
     a golden acorn
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a purple nut with thorns

>examine chain
 It's a pale blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.

>examine black plaque
 It's a totally black round plaque. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's palm. The smooth stone is of a kind that Lornedei has never
 seen. A strange picture is carved on one side. It looks like a flying
 insect of some sort, with a giant tree in the background.

>where is staff
 All I understood was a wish to where.

>drop beetle
 Lornedei tries to let the bug go. As soon as she manages to shake the
 thing off her hand, it spreads its wings, makes a short trip around her
 head to finally land on her shoulder, not pleased with Lornedei at all.
 The bug crawls underneath her hair, grabs a few of those fine hairs in
 the back of her neck and tugs on  them. Lornedei shrieks.

>where silver
 All I understood was a wish to where.

>where
 You can only use this command when trying to find the wolf.

>where wolf
 Deini is running all over the place. The last I saw of her she was
 somewhere in the Aarkland (Billowing Field).

>whats
 Whats what?
 Here are some commands you can use:

 health.
 specifics. As a rule there are no changes in normal objects. Examine
 and reach are still the main commands to use when interacting with
 objects and creatures.


 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>examine spider
 It's a large spider made of crystal. It has curled up as if either dead
 or sleeping most of the time. It is hard to tell which. It gives off a
 cold sparkling light and has a pair of multi facetted eyes. Oddly
 enough, the eyes seem both beady and shifty. No matter from where it is
 observed, it seems to glare suspiciously. She will have to touch the
 spider to examine it further. That is, if it will let her.

>h ld
 Lornedei looks fine. She is as healthy as she will ever be.

>h spider
 The crystal spider seems healthy enough.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>touch spider
 Lornedei reaches for the spider and it actually lets her investigate.
 She carefully holds one leg and the spider lets her flex it
 experimentally before resolutely pulling it away from her. The spider
 is cold and strangely flexible. It seems to be able to appear as hard

 the next moment. It is however staring suspiciously at her, wondering
 what this touchy feely thing is all about.

 The firefly appears. it buzzes around Lornedei's head.
 "Me, yes, has come to help! Now hurry and ask!"

>ask firefly about statue
 "It is one of the old ones sentries. They are all gone now I believe.
 Shame, such a shame. The light bearers held them very high but now they
 are all gone. This one must be angry though. Someone has stolen her
 spear. Oh dear oh dear!"

 "Acorn? Pretty thing is it not? An acorn is a nut, is a seed, is a
 thing that needs growing, needs soil and water? It needs to be planted
 in the mist. Oh no, not the dangerous mist. The golden mist."

>ask firefly about spider
 "This is a magical little creepy crawly. The light bearers used them to
 bring light and to cast away dark spirits. They do very little
 voluntarily those nasty creatures. Me, I don't know if they are lazy or
 only full of themselves, but they do seem to think that they are above
 simple humans."

>look

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.

 She can see a Firefly here.

 "I must go, yes I must. The firefly disappears with a pop and a flash.

>go west

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>go west

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

 She can see A crystal spider with shifty, beady eyes (Curled up acting
 dead at the moment.) here.

>ask spider for light
 The spider straightens to show its maximum height. It taps one of its
 legs against another and turns away. It is clearly beneath a creature
 of light to obey common humans.

>rub spider
 The crystal spider would most certainly not appreciate that.

>kick spider
 Lornedei would never.

>stamp
 "Master? I don't understand."

>give berry to spider
 The spider pokes the handful of white berries with some interest. The
 curiosity doesn't last long though and the spider returns to its
 suspicious glaring.

>give nut to spider
 Really? the purple nut with thorns?
 Lornedei carefully takes the nut, holding it with two fingers by one of
 the thorns. That way she won't get hurt.

 north.

 She can see A crystal spider with shifty, beady eyes (Glaring
 suspiciously.) here.

>examine staircase
 The stone staircase spirals down into the dark. The steps are worn and
 cracked. A layer of sand and dust covers each step. No one has walked
 here for many years.

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

 "This place is dry and dusty but there are no smells, nothing but
 despair and loneliness. Everything is dead."

>listen
 All is quiet.

 I can't understand you. Try to say it differently.

 Lornedei takes a careful little bite. Once proven safe and truly
 edible, she quickly gobbles it down.
 "Pardon my manners Master, but I was hungry."

>search debris
 Lornedei's magic just went up by seven.

 Lornedei scratches her head, looking at the mountain of rubble.

>ground

 Lornedei digs a hole in the dry ground.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>go south

 Wasteland (By the Circle of Stones)
 This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden
 forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her
 out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces
 across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken
 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A big round stone lies in the middle of the pit. The fire is gone.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like
 someone crying. An abandoned cry of loneliness.

>talk to sone
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>talk to stone
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the big round boulder or the circle
 of stones?

 Lornedei glances up at you. After a moment of puzzled silence, she
 shakes her head.

>feel boulder
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the big round boulder or the circle
 of stones?

>round
 Lornedei shrugs. What the big round boulder feels like does not
 interest her.

>push round boulder
 The stone is too heavy to move around.

>in
 The forbidden forest stands guard above the rim of the bowl she is in.
 She can get back to the field by going north, west, or northwest.

>listen to forest
 "I hear nothing but a careful whispering from these trees right now. It
 is the sound of dry leaves scraping against each other, that is all. I
 cannot hear any animals at all."

>go west

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.

>listen
 There is nothing here to listen to but the constant wind.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>go west

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Ravine)
 Lornedei stands on an outcropping overlooking a deep ravine going as
 far north as she can see. The ledge seems to be the remains of a road,
 cut off by the creation of the break in the earth. On the other side of
 the ravine, there's a barely visible opening through the trees. There
 is no way over there though. A steady wind tears at her clothes and
 hair in sudden gusts that seem eager to throw her off balance.

 East, northeast and north are the ways off the ledge.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.
 A high pitched squeal from somewhere among the blackened trees fills
 the air, and Lornedei shudders.

>listen
 There is nothing here to listen to but the constant wind.

>examine sun
 Right above her the sky is clear, darkening to a graphite tinted blue.
 All around this patch, in all directions, there is a ceiling of
 constant mist. Visible above this blanket of gray, to the west, a dying
 sun sets the horizon in flames.

>heal mist
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>shout
 I can't understand you. Try to say it differently.

 She can hear nothing from the small gray plaque.
 "Master?"

>break grey plaque
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine gray plaque
 It is a small round plaque in a material unknown to Lornedei. The
 surface is smooth and with a deep polish. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's hand. The surface shows nothing, not even the distorted
 image of Lornedei herself that one might expect. What shows in the
 plaque is like a reflection of a stormy sky in a puddle of murky water,
 just before the rain starts hammering.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>break gray plaque
 Never mind having her wreck her inventory, unless it is truly called
 for.

>show plaque to sky
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the small black plaque or the small
 gray plaque?

 Sorry, that can't be corrected.

>throw gray plaque into ravine
 Lornedei gives you a doubtful glance. After just a moments hesitation,
 she decides to trust your judgment. She drops the small gray plaque in
 the ravine. She does not stay at the edge long enough to watch it fall.
 "Was that necessary?"

 A step by step walkthrough is difficult to write for this game. I can
 point out necessary steps to get the most out of it, nothing more.
 Try this first though:
 If you are lost, you can try to type exits.
 Alternatively, type hint to summon the firefly.
 Perhaps Lornedei can answer your question.
 Are you sure you want to do this?


>duh!

>no
 There is no need to answer her. Better to keep your peace.

>black
 There is no need for her to do that.

>ask ld about gray plaque
 Lornedei shrugs.
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

>examine black plaque
 It's a totally black round plaque. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's palm. The smooth stone is of a kind that Lornedei has never
 seen. A strange picture is carved on one side. It looks like a flying
 insect of some sort, with a giant tree in the background.
 "What should I do?"

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 374.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a purple nut with thorns
   a golden acorn
   A crystal spider with shifty, beady eyes (Polishing its underside at
 the moment.)
   a piece of cheese
   a small black plaque
   a large black beetle (Spinning around waving its antennae at the
 moment.)
   a loaf of horrid bread
   a small leather pouch (which is open but empty)
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)

>give black plaque to beetle
 The bug spins around and around but that's it.
 "Master?"

>feed beetle to spider
 The spider stretches out to its full height and pokes the beetle in the
 eye. The bug gives off a high-pitch squeal and crawls in under
 Lornedei's hair.

>eat spider
 Lornedei is not in the mood for tasting critters.

>examine acorn
 It is an acorn in shape and form but it seems to be one in solid gold.

>feel acorn
 Lornedei holds the golden acorn in her hand. The images come to her
 without being reached for.

 A seedling, a sapling, a giant oak.
 All in a matter of seconds. Dripping water, a silver goblet.
 A wish to grow, a wish to heal.
 Instant flashes, not much more than emotion and fleeing images, but
 strong and urgent.
 Time is running out.
 The vision fades.

>hint
 The firefly appears. it buzzes around Lornedei's head.
 "Me, yes, has come to help! Now hurry and ask!"

>ask firefly about plaque
 "Me, yes me, I will not tell."

>ask firefly about wolf
 "Eeee! Just keep that horrible animal away from me. Have you fed it?
 You should not! You will spoil it rotten and then it will come after
 you for more food!
 If you are stupid enough to ask it to follow you it is even worse. You
 will never get rid of it."

>ask firefly about nut
 "Me, yes me, I will not tell."

 "I must go, yes I must. The firefly disappears with a pop and a flash.

 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.

>plant acorn in mist
 All I understood was a wish to plant the golden acorn.

>go north
 She should not venture too far into this scarred landscape. Beyond is
 the mist, where she would be lost. Lornedei turns back.

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

>search rocks
 Lornedei scratches her head, looking at the mountain of rubble.
 "If I could get through this first pile of blocks, then maybe, I am not
 sure I can though. I am going to need some help."

>remove dust
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>look into ravine
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go up

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go south

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>reach wall
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the walls or the eastern wall?

>walls
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>beetle, search debris
 The beetle seems to ponder this. Then it crosses its antennae, willing
 but confused.

>spider, search debris
 The spider straightens to show its maximum height. It taps one of its
 legs against another and turns away. It is clearly beneath a creature
 of light to obey common humans.
 "What should I do?"

>beetle, ne
 The beetle seems to ponder this. Then it crosses its antennae, willing
 but confused.

>crush beetle in rage
 All I understood was a wish to crush the big black beetle.

>beetle, find wolf
 The bug waves its antennae but has very little to say.

>summon rain
 "Master? I don't understand."

>examine clouds
 Right above her the sky is clear, darkening to a graphite tinted blue.
 All around this patch, in all directions, there is a ceiling of
 constant mist. Visible above this blanket of gray, to the west, a dying
 sun sets the horizon in flames.

>throw plaque into mist
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the small black plaque or the small
 gray plaque?

>black
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>throw gray plaque into ravine
 Lornedei gives you a doubtful glance. After just a moments hesitation,
 she decides to trust your judgment. She drops the small gray plaque in
 the ravine. She does not stay at the edge long enough to watch it fall.
 "Was that necessary?"


>undo

 Let it be so!

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 374.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a purple nut with thorns
   a golden acorn
   A crystal spider with shifty, beady eyes (Stretching out, apparently
 snoozing at the moment.)
   a piece of cheese
   a small black plaque
   a large black beetle (Airing out its shell at the moment.)
   a loaf of horrid bread
   a small leather pouch (which is open but empty)
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a handful of white berries
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)

>throw spider in ravine
 "No Master. I think I will hold on to this for now."

>throw acorn in ravine
 "No Master. I think I should hold on to this."

>throw cheese in ravine
 Lornedei gives you a doubtful glance. After just a moments hesitation,
 she decides to trust your judgment. She drops the piece of cheese in
 the ravine. She does not stay at the edge long enough to watch it fall.
 "Was that necessary?"


>undo
 Castle Courtyard
 Let it be so!

>throw nut in ravine
 Lornedei throws the nut over the edge. A sudden gust of wind grabs it.
 After dancing around in the air for a few moments, it drops down at her
 feet.

>get it
 Lornedei carefully picks up the nut. She quickly drops it in the
 rucksack.

>tie pouch to nut
 That is not possible.

>put nut in pouch
 She needs to be holding the purple nut with thorns before she can put
 it into something else.

>take nut
 Lornedei carefully takes the nut, holding it with two fingers by one of
 the thorns. That way she won't get hurt.

>put nut in pouch
 She drops the purple nut with thorns into the small leather pouch.
 "What should I do?"

>examine pouch
 It is a dry and withered leather pouch, no bigger than a woman's fist.
 A leather string is used to close it and hang it in a belt.

>look in it
 In the small leather pouch is a purple nut with thorns.

>throw pouch into ravine
 Lornedei drops the small leather pouch over the edge.

  "Greetings Almighty! Allow me to tell you about your world, Aarkland."

 Our story begins here.

 The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from early
 morning until all that must be done is done. The summer has been good
 and this winter no one will starve. That is what the villagers believe,
 anyway. In ignorance they have turned from you and cannot see the
 coming darkness. For them Ignorance is bliss, but refusing to see the
 truth is no protection against evil.

 The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You watch
 her treading along the road and when she stops next to the water, you
 once more feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in more than a
 hundred years that has been born with the old power. The youngest
 daughter to Lorne and Noki, this innocent girl searches the sky for
 your presence. She smiles when she senses it and gives you a little
 wave. She is the last one. The last hope.

 Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance
 back along the road, and makes sure her sandals are fastened properly.
 Surely she can sense you watching her, but she says nothing. She
 reaches into her rucksack and brings out some bread. She nibbles on it
 without much enthusiasm while watching the flowing river, and she waits
 for you.

 The girl has the power to "reach" beyond what the eye can see and
 "heal" what is broken, but she is not strong enough to make a
 difference. Not without guidance. That is where you come in. As the God
 of this land, you must guide her. First, you should send her to the
 unholy stones to see what the world around her is hiding.

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)
 This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
 forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
 Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
 the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.

 Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by
 grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east.
 Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare
 to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast
 is a pile of stones. The stones are barely visible above the grass.

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 A whiff of the deformed bushes reaches Lornedei's nose and she waves
 the unpleasant odor away.

 Is that a language I have not yet learned?

>se

 Aarkland (On the Unholy Stones)
 For as long as Lornedei can remember, she has been told not to go
 there. There is nothing strange about the stones at a distance. It
 could just be a collection of fieldstones, perhaps from the time when
 the settlers first prepared the field. Nothing could be more wrong.
 There are piles of stones in many fields, but none with this kind of
 history.

 She hesitates and turns to you. It seems like she wants to say
 something. She keeps silent and steps up on the platform.
 The collection of stones is over ten paces from edge to edge. The top
 has been flattened to create a platform and that is where Lornedei
 stands. No new stones have been added in several hundred years. Despite
 the lack of activity, nothing grows near the stones.

 There are powers here that make it easier for her to use her magic. You
 can make her see what hides around her. She will see the world as it
 is, what hides beyond what the eye can see.

 She can go north to the field or northwest back to the dusty road.
 Lornedei suddenly looks startled.
 "Master what is this?" A firefly is buzzing around her head. She waves
 her hand to wave it away when suddenly a small voice pipes up.
 "No, No, silly girl. I am no harm! I am here to help you must know!"
 Lornedei stops waving but she looks dubiously at the tiny creature.
 Once safe from the terribly waving arm, the firefly stops for a rest on
 Lornedei's brow. The tiny voice pipes up again. "I must come, curious
 am I, and I can help such as you!" Lornedei tries to look up at the fly
 but all that happens is that her eyes cross. "There is magic here,
 magic in you girl. I have not sensed magic in a long time, yes!" the
 fly takes off and starts buzzing around Lornedei's head again. "Strong
 you are not! Oh, no. That god of yours was stingy in his giving so he
 was. Pity, pity. You can be stronger though. Sometimes from nature,
 sometimes from other things. You must know girl, to regain strength
 that you lose, you must eat. Ah, there are some here, I have searched
 for these." the fly buzzes off towards the deformed bushes and lands on
 one of the berries growing there. "Eat these and be strong, do not
 forget." there is an angry buzzing, a strange grunting sound, and a
 thud as a white berry, seemingly with a firefly attached on the top,
 falls to the ground. "Me... Will just.." In an amazing display of
 over-insectile powers, the fly lifts the berry off the ground. "will
 just take this." The firefly, along with its booty, disappears with a
 pop and a flash.

 The firefly is available for questioning. It is happy to help. Just
 type "hint" and it will come.
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

>go northwest

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.

>examine bsh
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine bush
 They all look sick, small, and deformed as they reach their oddly
 shaped digits towards her. There must be something wrong with them.
 Despite it being in the middle of Harvest Moon, their leaves are yellow
 and riddled with brown and black blotches.
 A few white berries still cling to the branches.

>get berries
 Lornedei picks all of the berries that seem edible. It turns out to be
 quite a handful. She drops them all into the rucksack.

>go north
 No, she can go east to the field, southeast to the unholy stones, or
 enter the river to the west.

>go east

 Aarkland (Billowing Field)
 Lornedei hesitates throwing an anxious glance south.

 Maybe she would prefer to be back in the safe grasp of her kin. If that
 is the case, she will never tell her God. She does not know why she is
 here or how easy her mind and flesh may be corrupted, and she may be
 better off that way.

 Very carefully, you give her just the slightest of mental nudges to
 remove the hesitation from her mind. Not again can you give her a
 command without letting her choose how to proceed. What she has ahead
 of her she must do of her own free will as much as possible. Lornedei
 takes her eyes off the road and moves on.
 The grass grows waist high. Touched by sun, wind, and rain, it
 patiently waits for the farmers that will not come. The edge of the old
 forest lies close by to the north. To the south, a big pile of stones
 rises above the grass. The road is back west.

 There is a low growling coming from the high grass. An injured wolf
 lies there.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>heal wolf
 Lornedei shuts her eyes, raising both hands towards the dying animal.
 She summons her powers and the air starts to shimmer above the wolf. In
 sudden panic the wolf yelps miserably and tries to get up on its feet,
 but Lornedei's soft mumbling calms the animal. Still, the stare from
 those yellow eyes and a deep growl behind the exposed sharp teeth
 cannot be mistaken for friendliness.

 Another mumbled phrase is heard from the girl and the predator's eyes
 slowly close. The wolf is asleep. The girl kneels while the swirling
 blue light covers the wolf with healing power. In one quick move, she
 corrects the broken leg to allow it to heal properly. A long while
 passes. Then she sits back in the grass, tired but smiling. She lets
 the healing light dissipate in the air.
 "All is well Master. I shall call her Deini."

 Another long while passes. The air is warm but a slight breeze moves
 the grass around Lornedei. It sways gently, like waves, across the vast
 field.

 The wolf opens its eyes, blinks, gets up. Lornedei sits on the ground
 with a confident smile on her lips and her hands in her lap. The
 beautiful animal stands absolutely still for a moment, meeting the
 girl's eyes. Then, in a heartbeat, it turns away. It runs along the
 edge of the forest. It stops near a big tree and turns around to watch
 the human. It sits down while considering its options.

 Then suddenly, the wolf that Lornedei named "Deini" comes running back.
 She smells the human, inspects her carefully, and makes a decision. She
 puts a cool muzzle in the hand that Lornedei is holding out. Lornedei
 has gained a friend.

 Lornedei's magic just dropped by five.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>deini, follow me
 Deini looks at Lornedei, wondering if there might be something to eat
 first. When that doesn't seem to happen, the wolf ignores her command.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>reach wolf
 "I do not need to reach inside her to know that she is better now. The
 pain is gone."
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>give bread to deini
 Deini smells the bread, sneezes, and backs away. She glances
 suspiciously at the piece of bread.

>give cheese to deini
 (Taking the piece of cheese first.)
 Deini smells the piece of cheese but she is not very interested in
 anything that never had a heart beat at one point.
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

>give berry to deini
 (Taking the handful of white berries first.)
 Deini smells the handful of white berries but she is not very
 interested in anything that never had a heart beat at one point.

>get deini
 Deini is still a wild animal in her true element. She should not be
 captured or provoked.

>put all in backpack
 handful of white berries: Done.
 piece of cheese: Done.
 loaf of horrid bread: Done.

>go south

 Aarkland (On the Unholy Stones)

>reach world
 The world around Lornedei fades. She finds herself high up in the air,
 hovering above a seemingly endless field. She flaps her white wings
 tentatively at first, but then she catches an upwind and rises.
 Not far ahead of her is a vast and lush forest, stretching north and
 northeast. She looks east. Between the field and the endless ocean are
 a few homes, perhaps a fishing village, and a patchwork of fields. As
 she hovers far above the field, turning to the south, she can see a
 road following a river to another village far to the south. It is
 Lornedei's own.

 She turns west and the forbidden forest, a landscape of gray, stretches
 out ahead of her. It stretches to the southwest and to the northwest as
 far as she can see. It is a swirling black and gray mass of mist or
 smoke, for the most part unbroken except for the occasional tree-top
 protruding here and there.



 She moves closer until she is above the glittering water of the
 Aarkland river and turns north. She follows the flowing water until it
 seems to disappear into a large cliff. The two forests meet at the top
 of the cliff, but the old forest seems to give way more and more so
 that the border turns northeast towards a distant mountain chain. The
 river does not seem to appear again.

 She turns west, soaring above unbroken gray, seeing only the occasional
 twisted treetop shooting out of the thick mist and a blue sky above.
 She flies on, across a landscape of gray and black. The mist Swirls
 here and there, darkens here and there, but never reveals what is
 below.

 Then the air seems to thin and she sinks down. She sinks down below the
 mist. She finds herself racing between twisted tree-trunks and grasping
 branches. A dry whisper follows her as she loses her orientation.
 Silent shapes like shadows follow her path. Spirits, hollow-eyed, pale
 and ragged, open their mouths in rage and longing before they shy away
 from her. They melt back into the shadows between the trees. Suddenly
 she is out of the forest.

 Below her is a barren landscape of sand and broken earth. The forbidden
 forest surrounds this field of despair, although the sky is clear.
 Above the mist, to the northeast, she can see a pale silhouette of the
 mountains. She can see a far distant shade of green to the east, beyond
 which is a blue horizon.

 The same view meets her to the southeast, but to the south, southwest
 and west, there is only the forbidden forest with its blanket of mist.

 She lowers herself until she is just above stony ground. A deep ravine
 separates the field from the forest to the west. The ravine runs south
 to north into a misty plain where it disappears out of sight. To the
 northwest, clinging to the edge of the ravine, there is an old ruin...a
 castle. Only part of the ruin is visible as the rest of it fades into
 gray mist.

 She turns westward and sinks down in the ravine. Making her way north,
 the tip of her left wing nearly strokes the far ravine wall. She turns
 upwards and flies clockwise around the entire castle ruin. Most of the
 old castle is gone. As she is viewing it from the outside she can see
 chambers, dungeons and rooms in several levels that are exposed. The
 rest of the ruin is at the bottom of the ravine. After flying through
 the mist on the far side of the ruin, she appears at a great wall that
 separates the castle grounds from the northern wastelands before
 turning southeast. In the southeast corner of the big desolate field
 the ground slopes down and turns into a ragged hole in the ground. Heat
 ripples the air around it. A large fire burns within a ring of stones.

 She circles the fire. She is in a hurry, searching for the thing that
 should be but is no longer. She returns to the ruin. There is a high
 wall east of the castle and she stops to rest on top of it.

 The world wavers its way back to reality and Lornedei looks pale and a
 bit unsteady on her feet.
 "Too high! Master? If I die and must come back, please do not make me a
 bird!"There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a
 distant object, but she can do nothing with it.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>go northwest

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.

>get leaf
 (the yellow leaves)
 Lornedei pulls a leaf off of one of the branches and it immediately
 crumbles into a smelly dust. She quickly brushes it off her hands while
 wrinkling her nose in disgust.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>get branch
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>look

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)
 This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
 forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
 Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
 the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.

 Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by
 grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east.
 Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare
 to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast
 is a pile of stones. The stones are barely visible above the grass.

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.

>go east

 Aarkland (Billowing Field)

 Deini is here.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>go east
 No, there is nothing but the field as far as the eye can see and then
 the ocean beyond. Today is not the day to make that trip. The river is
 west and the unholy stones are to the south.
 Deini plunks her behind down and starts attacking an itchy spot on her
 leg with her front teeth.

>go west

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.

>examine tree
 There is nothing she can do from where she is. She will have to get
 closer.

>go east

 Deini is here.

>examine tree
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go west

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.

>examine bush
 The bushes are a truly sad sight now that Lornedei has picked all the
 berries.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 75.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a loaf of horrid bread
     a piece of cheese
     a handful of white berries

>in
 No, she can go east to the field, southeast to the unholy stones, or
 enter the river to the west.

>go west

 In the River (By the Road)
 Lornedei tightens her sandals and checks her rucksack, making sure it
 is closed tight before entering the river. She steps carefully down the
 slippery slope and through the parting rushes and reeds. Something
 squawks at her but it is gone before she can see it. When her feet lose
 contact with the bottom, she floats and lets the remaining hesitation
 float away with the invisible currents below.
 The river runs from north to south. Ahead of her, the glittering water
 becomes shaded by the two forests. The forbidden forest on the left and
 the still green old forest on the right. The river disappears out of
 sight perhaps a hundred paces into the tunnel of trees, water, and
 shadows. The dusty road is east, where she can get out of the water.
 She can also dive down to the bottom of the river.

>dive
 She dives down.

 River Bottom (Here be Sand)
 A magical world reveals itself. The river continues north. The bottom
 is mostly composed of sand, rocks, some mud, and quickly fleeing fish.
 All kinds of things have been thrown in the river from the road and are
 now resting under a layer of sand until the end of time. The river
 continues north.

>catch fish
 Lornedei looks puzzled. She seems not to understand your command.

>get fish
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go north

 River Bottom (Here be Mud)
 It's harder to see here. The river flows from north to south. The mud
 swirls up, preventing her from seeing more than a few arm lengths
 ahead. The old trees reach out their roots under the water. They crowd
 the bottom along with swaying vegetation and rocks.

 She can see a small gray plaque here.

>get plaque
 As you wish.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine roots
 Some things in this world are not for her to be concerned with.

>search mud
>go north
 Lornedei digs through some of the mud but there doesn't seem to be
 anything of interest down there.


 River Bottom (At the Cave Entrance)
 The bottom is littered with rocks. There are piles of them of varying
 sizes, washed clean by the constant flow of water. Around the sides of
 the opening into the cave, a few colonies of a slimy and sickly green
 plant have managed to make a home. They sway back and forth in the
 current while clinging desperately to the rocks. The opening leads
 northwest into a cave and south takes her back around the river bend.
 Her lungs are starting to ache. She will have to go to the surface
 soon!

>go up

 In the River (By the Cliff)
 She floats on the surface in the shadows of the trees, accompanied by
 the sounds of the forests: A murmur of life from the old forest, and a
 dry whispering, not quite as pleasant, from the black trees on the
 other riverbank.
 The river makes a slight turn, hiding the road from view. A vertical
 cliff stops her from going any further north in this tunnel of water,
 trees, and shadows. Above her head is a frayed ribbon of blue sky and
 at the top of the cliff, the two forests meet. Below and around her
 there is that play of light and dark, maybe just a little bit darker.
 South takes her back around the bend. Looking down she can see an
 opening in the cliff.

>reach cliff
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>go east
 She can't get out of the river that way. She can go back south along
 the river or down to the bottom.

>go south

 In the River (Between the Forests)
 Giant trees shade the river from both sides. Deformed branches dip
 their fingers in the water as if testing the depth before entering the
 water. Lornedei throws her head to the left, when a sudden sound is
 heard from the black forest. She moves a little bit closer to the east
 riverbank.

 A constant play of light and shadow goes on around her. The two forests
 lean towards each other from both sides. The sketched outlines of the
 two forests against a clear sky create deep shadows, distorted mirrored
 images, and an illusion of endless depths below.
 The forbidden forest is to the west and the old forest to the east. The
 river flows back south and down takes her to the bottom of the river.
 To the north the river disappears out of sight around a bend, and there
 is a slight opening in the trees to the east.
 A tiny voice suddenly pipes up from somewhere in the dark forest. "Most
 interesting... Most strange this is. Oh, no, nasty bug, go away!" The
 firefly comes out of the forest in a reckless speed, skids on the
 surface in front of Lornedei with a shocked screech, gets airborne and
 settles on her head, clearly exasperated.
 "Nasty, nasty things. Let me just rest girl, just for a moment."
 Lornedei watches the black forest for a moment, waiting for the firefly
 to calm down. When the little creature talks again, it seems to have
 regained its composure. It lifts off and starts circling Lornedei.

 "The nasty forest has secrets. It might tell you if you look beyond.
 You must reach inside it to get knowledge girl. So many secrets are
 everywhere in this forest, and the other forest, leaves and rocks and
 the beasts living there." The fly buzzes over to a black leaf floating
 on the river. "This here is not what it seems either." The fly lands on
 the edge of the leaf and with an angry buzzing, it propels its little
 ship downstream without another word.

>examine tree
 These trees all look dead at first sight. Scorched and tortured, they
 reach out their blackened limbs over the cowering undergrowth. They do
 have leaves, however, not green and lush but almost black.

>get leaf
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the black leaves or the green leaves?

>green
 The leaves are fine just the way they are. I'm sure Lornedei would
 agree.
 A dry black leaf drops from the forbidden forest into the water right
 in front of Lornedei. It bobs up and down a couple of times before it
 floats away downstream.

>get black leaf
 Lornedei grabs one of the black leaves in the nearest cluster of leaves
 and twists it loose. The leaf, being as long as her middle finger,
 falls to its side in her palm. The curved inside of the leaf suddenly
 fills with a hideous mush that swells and boils as she watches. Flesh
 grows and shapes itself in the shell into an insect's body. The mush is
 white with brown and dark red streaks. The nasty mess is swirling
 around inside the leaf, forming the flesh bit by bit. The shiny wetness
 dries quickly once the beetle's body takes form inside its shell. A
 thin purple layer finally covers the belly. Six black legs pop out
 through the newly formed glittering layer of skin. It takes only a
 moment for them to start moving around. Another pop forces a wriggling
 head out and the insect is near completion. The bug grows at a furious
 pace and finally it extrudes a pair of black antennae that unfold until
 they're as long, if not longer, than the entire beetle.

 Lornedei turns the beetle over. It stays nearly motionless in her hand.
 The long antennae, shivering slightly, carefully touch the outline of
 the hand holding it, the sensitive inside of Lornedei's wrist, the
 sleeve of her shirt. The beetle seems satisfied with its new master.

>put it in backpack
 That makes very little sense. Try something else.

>put leaf in rucksack
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the black leaves or the green leaves?

>put beetle in rucksack
 She drops the big black beetle into the leather rucksack.

>go east
 Lornedei drags herself up on the east bank, steps carefully over the
 slippery rocks and into the old forest.

 Old Forest
 Leaving the river behind her, she stops a moment to rest. In the cool
 shade she is surrounded by the comforting whispers of life. Leaning
 against a big tree, she silently watches the river. She does not notice
 the small brown shape rushing down the tree until it uses her shoulder
 as a springboard. It propels itself outward from there, sprints across
 the trail, and vanishes among the trees before Lornedei's gasp of
 surprise changes into a scream. With her shoulders relaxing again she
 looks for the squirrel among the trees, but it has already moved on to
 somewhere else. She clears her throat and glances up at you.
 "Just a stupid squirrel."
 A narrow path leads east into the forest. All is still. The old forest
 surrounds her.

 The glittering water of the Aarkland can be seen through the trees to
 the west.

>go east

 Hall of Elevation
 After the walk through the dark forest, she is surprised to suddenly
 step into a big clearing. She stops just beyond the tree line to look
 around.
 The clearing is perfectly round and it's surrounded by the old forest
 in all directions. A giant oak tree stands in solitude a short distance
 into the hall of trees, separated from the wall of birch, ash, silver
 pine and the myriad of other plants growing there. The barely visible
 path through the forest is to the west.

 An old urn sits in the grass next to the big oak.

>examine oak
 (the giant oak)
 The giant oak stands proud and enormous, shading a big part of the
 clearing with its outstretched limbs with their dense foliage. The
 first big branch reaches out far above Lornedei's head. Craning her
 neck, she still cannot see the highest branches.
 All she can see is something glittering green far above. To see what's
 behind the big tree she'll have to go around to the northwest or the
 northeast.

>examine urn
 It's an old bronze urn as long as your lower arm and as wide as your
 neck. The outside is covered with symbols whose meaning has long since
 been forgotten.

>look in urn
 The old tarnished bronze urn is empty.

>reach urn
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>reach oak
 (the giant oak)
 The tree fades away before Lornedei's inner sight. For a moment there
 is nothing but a shimmering mist all around, but then three shapes
 appear in the distance. They are trees. This she is sure of. Giant
 trees. They are somehow out of focus and no matter how she strains,
 they remain that way. The only thing clear about the shapes is the
 color of the mist surrounding them. They are surrounded by green,
 black, and gold. Suddenly the golden tree fades, leaving the mist
 behind. The black tree grows, and the green one appears to cower under
 it. Lornedei's vision fades.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>take urn
 As you wish.

>go northeast

 Hall of Elevation (Behind the Oak)
 Lornedei walks around the enormous tree. The giant oak's shadow has all
 but starved everything growing on the ground behind it.
 She is standing between the big oak and the dense forest. Southeast or
 southwest will take her back to the open clearing. Steps are cut in the
 big oak.

 An old water sack lies against the trunk. Someone must have left it
 here recently.

 A dead rabbit lies next to the tree.

 She can also see a small dented silver plate (which is empty) here.

>examine sack
 It's a small water sack with a wooden cork and a leather strap to tie
 to a belt. It seems to be in good shape.

>examine rabbit
 Someone has recently hunted and killed this rabbit, probably using a
 snare of some sort. The little furry thing is still fresh and edible.

>examine plate
 It is a somewhat dented silver dish. One side returns a distorted but
 clear image of the holder.

>take all
 small water sack: As you wish.
 dead rabbit: As you wish.
 small dented silver plate: As you wish.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>go up

 Hall of Elevation (In the Giant Oak)
 A soft warm breeze catches Lornedei's hair when she finally reaches a
 branch. It is, in fact, the first branch she gets to and the only one
 she can reach. It's as thick as a well-fed pig and she swings one leg
 over it. She ends up sitting with her face towards the trunk. Above her
 is an enormous and glittering green ceiling that is the crown of the
 oak.

 She looks up. The endless movements of the countless leaves trick her
 into swaying with them. That is, until she nearly loses her balance.
 She grabs the branch and focuses instead on the unmoving trunk. A pale
 shadow of a smile touches her lips when she quickly glances up at you.
 The shadow of the big oak trembles on the ground below. The far end of
 the branch Lornedei is sitting on seems to disappear in a gray mist.
 The other two branches on this level are just as unreachable for her as
 the limbs higher up.

 In the trunk in front of her, three holes are lined up in a tidy row.
 They are apparently inhabited by some kind of worm. She can climb down
 or go north along the branch.
 A fat blue worm quickly crawls over to the third hole.

 The beetle scrambles out of its confinement. It sits motionless but
 trembling on Lornedei's shoulder, making a strange hissing noise.

 After a moment of that, it scrambles down to the branch, utters that
 strange hissing again, louder this time. One of the worms sticks its
 head out and hisses back at the beetle. It makes a very hasty retreat
 back in the hole though.

>examine holes
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the first hole, the second hole or
 the third hole?

>examine first hole
 Three holes, neatly in a row, can be seen in the trunk. Apparently
 worms live there.
 The beetle hisses at the worms. The yellow worm shows its head and
 hisses back.
 Suddenly, all the worms crawl out of their holes. In an instant they're
 all relocated. The yellow worm drags its chunk of wood into its new
 home.

>yellow worm
 "Master? I don't understand."

>examine yellow worm
 "I Cannot see as long as it is hiding in the hole Master."
 The beetle hisses at the worms. The yellow worm shows its head and
 hisses back.

>look in third hole
 "I can see something blue in there, Oh, dear! It has teeth.
 The beetle hisses at the worms. The yellow worm shows its head and
 hisses back.

>look in second hole.
 "There is something red and shiny deep in the hole."
 The beetle hisses at the worms. The yellow worm shows its head and
 hisses back.
 Suddenly, all the worms come out of their holes. They crawl over each
 other in a haste to switch habitats. In an instant they're all back in
 their chosen holes.

>look in second hole
 "There is something yellow and squirmy in there."
 The beetle hisses at the worms. The yellow worm shows its head and
 hisses back.
 Suddenly, all the worms crawl out of their holes. In an instant they're
 all relocated. The yellow worm drags its chunk of wood into its new
 home.

>examine chunk of wood
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine wood
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>reach yellow worm
 "Ahum! Interesting idea, but I think it would make me sick."

 The beetle hisses at the worms. The yellow worm shows its head and
 hisses back.

>put beetle in first hole
 She needs to be holding the big black beetle before she can put it into
 something else.
 The beetle hisses at the worms. The yellow worm shows its head and
 hisses back.
 A shiny red worm squirms its way over to the first hole.
 A skinny yellow worm quickly pops out of its hole and disappears into
 the third hole. In its path, it drops tiny pieces of wood that scatter
 in the breeze.

>take beetle
 The beetle crawls up in her hand.
 A fat blue worm quickly pops out of its hole and disappears into the

 Suddenly, all the worms come out of their holes. They crawl over each

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine yellow worm
 The worm is as long as a mans foot from toes to heel, as thick as the
 middle toe on that same foot and canary yellow. At each end of the
 somewhat slimy body sits a head. It has no eyes, only two mouths. Each
 mouth opens and closes in turns, when one is open the other is closed,
 revealing several rows of very small but razor sharp teeth.
 When one mouth closes and almost disappears in the stubby face, the
 other end opens its mouth and starts attacking the other end, biting it
 furiously until it seems to be satisfied and it turns away from its
 other self for a while.
 After some time the procedure repeats itself with the tables turned.

>put beetle in third hole
 The trusty little bug rushes into the hole but comes out right away. It
 quickly examines the other two holes but when there's nothing more to
 find, it crawls back into Lornedei's hand.

>go north
 Lornedei makes her way along the wide branch. The fog rises to meet her
 as she steps into it. For a dizzying moment, she can see nothing at
 all. Then she is passed the moment of blindness and steps into another
 one, different but possibly more disturbing. She is surrounded by a
 wall of mist. The clearing is gone, the light dim and nondescript, and
 the sounds muffled and distant.

 Sleepwalker's Lair
 There is nothing but a slightly greenish mist all around her. Even the
 ground is nothing but greenish vapor. Lornedei turns around like in a

 "Raccdaha, NO! Stop!"
 She moves in her sleep. Occasionally a hand touches one of the stones
 and she pulls it back as if it burns. Her face is full of agony.

>again
 She wakes up with a scream. She looks sick. She scrambles off the pile
 of stones on her hands and knees.
 Moving away from the unholy. She sits in the grass staring at her
 surroundings.
 "Umpffp" she says. You have no reply to that. She looks up at you and
 opens her mouth to say something but she keeps silent and looks away.
 Eventually, she stands up. She gives the stone pile a strange look and
 then suddenly she is calm, but distant. She stares into space while
 chewing on her hair.

 Aarkland (On the Unholy Stones)

 "Buzz! Dear oh dear." Lornedei looks down all of a sudden and points to
 the ground. "Oh, silly girl, rude you are. Put that finger away!"
 Lornedei quickly puts her finger in her mouth and starts chewing on it
 instead as her gaze wanders. The firefly crawls up from under one of
 the rocks. "Oh, dear, bad you are little girl. I see you have met a
 minion of Raccdaha girl. Oh dear." the fly lifts off and starts buzzing
 around Lornedei's head. Lornedei tries to follow the flight, turning
 and turning, but she gets dizzy and shuts her eyes, giggling
 uncontrollably. "Wake up Girl; this is not good, not at all." the fly
 charges and hits Lornedei between the eyes. *WHACK* Lornedei blinks but
 nothing happens. "Oh, dear. Well worry you should not Girl. The
 sleepwalker is no real harm unless it holds you too long in its dream.
 I must be off now. Perhaps your god can wake you up." the fly
 disappears with a pop and a flash.

 instead of just "her".

 Lornedei makes an effort to clear her mind. She rubs her eyes and drags

 "Ouch!" She looks at you. Then she gets distracted by a spot of dirt on
 her arm and she is gone again.

>go north

 Aarkland (Billowing Field)

 Deini is here.

>give rabbit to deini
 The hungry wolf snatches the rabbit from Lornedei's hand and sinks her
 teeth into the body. It is not a pretty sight and Lornedei looks away
 as the wolf eats. The wolf seems quite satisfied after that meal and
 Lornedei has gained a friend.

 Suddenly the wolf turns around and runs off in the grass. She seems to
 be searching for something specific and Lornedei waits. After a while,
 she comes back. Between her teeth is a bone, gnawed clean of meat. She
 drops the bone at Lornedei's feet, looking proud of her find.

 Lornedei pats Deini on the head.
 "Smart doggy."


 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

 Deini gets in front of Lornedei but the girl just gives her a

 Darkness is chased away by only a few illusive reflections in the

 inside of its prison another tap. After that, the spider curls up and
 is still again.

 Lornedei moves on through a current caused by the narrowing of the

 The main flow seems to continue north, while two smaller tunnels lead
 northwest and west. East takes her back near the opening.

>go north

 Caves (Where Bubbles Rise)
 Lornedei stops for a moment, surprised to see a stream of glittering
 bubbles rise from the bottom.
 Following the bubbles upwards, she notices a slight rippling of the
 water above.
 There is air above in this larger cave and just a hint of light
 somewhere ahead.
 The cave curves gently to the left and continues northwest towards the
 light while south takes her back to the Junction.

 Lornedei looks down to see where the bubbles are coming from, but she
 can't locate the source. She doesn't seem all that interested anyway.
 Her lungs are starting to ache. She will have to go to the surface
 soon!

>go up

 Caves (Among the Restless Roots)
 Lornedei floats on the surface in a small pocket of stale air. The
 ceiling is an arms length above her head, too far for her to reach. The
 air reeks of mold and damp wood. The trees above, not too far away but
 separated from her by a layer of cracked rock, reach down through the
 rock to this underground watering hole. The roots cling to all sides,
 and it's like a nest full of snakes turned upside down. The slithering
 animals are still hanging on to it.
 "There is something...." Lornedei shuts her mouth when the mass of
 roots comes alive. It trembles, writhes. The movements slowly fade as
 the silence returns.

 Lornedei turns around in the water, making sure to stay away from the
 walls and ceiling. She is staring at the tangle of roots in horrified
 fascination.
 The space she is in is not more then twice Lornedei's length in any
 direction. The tangle of roots makes the space seem smaller yet. The
 pale mass of roots stirs restlessly. Below her, the inky water of the
 river flows past.

  Something pulls Lornedei's hair and she shrieks. Less a few strands of
 hair, she turns around in the water. A thin root slithers away to
 disappear among the others.

>reach roots
 There is a low grumbling from above. Lornedei looks uneasily up at the
 ceiling of roots.

 "Eh?"
 A low squeaking makes Lornedei turn around. The sound stops.

>examine roots
 There is a low grumbling from above. Lornedei looks uneasily up at the
 ceiling of roots.

 They are like a lid above the putrid liquid in a warlocks kettle. Some
 of the roots hang from the ceiling and down in the dark water next to
 Lornedei, but most of them are curled up, braided, weaved, or simply
 twisted around each other like a two-threaded rope. They cover each
 side of this small space. The roots are a sickly pale yellow, some as
 thick as Lornedei's waist, others as thin as the thread you might use
 to tie around a large ham before baking it.

>go down
 She dives down.

 Caves (Where Bubbles Rise)
 There is air above in this larger cave and just a hint of light
 somewhere ahead.
 The cave curves gently to the left and continues northwest towards the
 light while south takes her back to the Junction.

 A stream of bubbles rises from the pitch-black bottom, meets the girl
 on its way up, and then explode in a glittering cascade of air around
 her.

>go down
 That is not the way.  She can go south, northwest, southwest or up.

>go northwest

 River Bottom (Below the Waterfall)
 Lornedei swims towards the light. As she comes out of the dark cave, a
 dull thundering meets her. The water is restless, striving noticeably
 back southeast. The bottom is washed clean from debris and vegetation.
 There is a dim light from above.

>go up

 In the River (By the Waterfall)
 She surfaces to a misty daylight and a loud thundering. At first she
 can't see what's ahead of her and she takes a couple of backstrokes,
 gasping for air. She looks up.
 She is in the middle of a short stretch of the river, with the
 forbidden forest leaning over the restless water from both riverbanks.
 A cover of gray mist hangs over the treetops. In-between, where there
 ought to be clear sky, a fog hangs low. Out of that mist, to the
 northwest, water falls from unknown heights. Down takes her back to the
 bottom.

>examine waterfall
 The water falls from the cliff and thunders down into the waterfall
 pool.

>examine pool
 Some things in this world are not for her to be concerned with.

>examine forest
 These trees all look dead at first sight. Scorched and tortured, they
 reach out their blackened limbs over the cowering undergrowth. They do
 have leaves, however, not green and lush but almost black.

>exits
  She can go northwest or down.

>go northwest
 Lornedei climbs up on a small ledge to one side of the waterfall.

 Elder's Spring (Behind the Waterfall)
 Lornedei climbs the ledge and makes her way in behind the waterfall.
 The light is dim, yet livid, glittering on damp stone walls. She takes
 a few steps forward, leaving the pooling water behind. She stops
 further into the cave where the floor is comparatively dry, and starts
 to leave a puddle of her own at her feet.
 Southeast takes her back out in the waterfall pool.

 The cave is only a few paces wide and perhaps ten paces deep. The
 ceiling is just above her head in this, mostly natural cavity in the
 stone. The cave narrows and at the far end, the rough stone has been
 hollowed out further and smoothed into a rectangular niche. Water drips
 down from somewhere far above in the niche. For centuries the water has
 been gathered in ceremonial cups by selected light bearers. Drop by
 drop, never less and never more than necessary.

 In the narrow hollow in the wall stands a stone pillar hidden by
 shadows.

 A silver goblet lies thrown on the stone floor next to the pillar.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine goblet
 The goblet shines as if it were newly polished by careful hands. Its
 cup is richly engraved on both the outside and inside.
 It narrows into a slender stem that spirals down until its twined
 silver threads separate into three smoothly curved tips, like the roots
 of a tree.

>reach goblet
 Lornedei is standing in the middle of a puddle on the stone floor. She
 giggles and stomps her feet.

>take goblet
 Lornedei is busy trying to drink from the waterfall.

>examine pillar
 The pillar is about shoulder height and an arms length wide at the
 bottom. It tapers off near the top, where the surface is just about as
 wide as a fully extended hand.

 It is circular with a deep polished surface. The stone is the color of
 newly fallen snow on a bed of mahogany wood shavings. The pillar is
 standing on an oval slab of the same kind of stone. A large metal ring
 sticks out from the pillar about half way up.

>examine urn
 It's an old bronze urn as long as your lower arm and as wide as your
 neck. The outside is covered with symbols whose meaning has long since
 been forgotten.

>examine ring
 It's a shiny metal ring attached to the front of the stone pillar. It
 might be a handle of some sort.

>pull ring
 Lornedei pulls the pillar backwards and out of the dark niche until its
 bottom sits edge to edge with the supporting slab's outer edge.

>look in niche
 There is nothing in there but the dripping water.

>enter niche
 That's not something she can enter.

>pull ring
 She can't pull the pillar any further.

>climb pillar
 There's no way she could.

>search niche
 There is nothing in there but the dripping water.

>take goblet
 Lornedei is busy trying to drink from the waterfall.

>wake her
 (Lornedei)
 You decide to break the rules just slightly. You give her a tiny nudge.
 A mental slap if you will. Her head snaps up and she is staring at you,
 shocked.

 Her eyes are bright and aware. She smiles.
 "I was not quite here Master. I am sorry. I am awake now."
 "What should I do?"

>take goblet
 As you wish.

>put goblet on pillar
 She puts the silver goblet on the stone pillar.

>examine pillar
 The pillar is about shoulder height and an arms length wide at the
 bottom. It tapers off near the top, where the surface is just about as
 wide as a fully extended hand.

 It is circular with a deep polished surface. The stone is the color of
 newly fallen snow on a bed of mahogany wood shavings. The pillar is
 standing on an oval slab of the same kind of stone. A large metal ring
 sticks out from the pillar about half way up.

>examine slab
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>take goblet
 As you wish.

>fill goblet
 Lornedei reaches out to hold the silver goblet under the dripping
 water. Her arm is pushed back and away from the dark niche and its
 water. The spring will not let her come any closer.

>put goblet on pillar
 She puts the silver goblet on the stone pillar.

>push pillar
 Lornedei pushes the pillar forward into the niche until the silver
 goblet stands directly under the dripping water. Slowly, drop by drop
 the sparse flow fills the goblet. When the goblet is full, the water
 stops dripping.

>pull pillar
 Lornedei pulls the pillar backwards until the silver goblet again
 appears.

>open sack
 She opens the small water sack.

>empty sack
 The river water pours onto the ground creating a puddle that soon
 disappears.

>take goblet
 As you wish.

>pour goblet into sack
 She pours the water from the Elder's spring into the small water sack.

>close sack
 She closes the small water sack.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 72.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a silver goblet
   A brightly shining fairy lamp with a crystal spider inside
   a bone
   a large black beetle (Spinning around waving its antennae at the
 moment.)
   a small dented silver plate
   a small water sack (which is closed)
     the water from the Elder's spring
   an old tarnished bronze urn
     a fat blue worm
     a shiny red worm
     a skinny yellow worm
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a loaf of horrid bread
     a piece of cheese
     a handful of white berries
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>se
 Lornedei moves towards the opening in the cave but suddenly she stops
 with her arm stretched out awkwardly behind her.
 She grabs the goblet with both hands and pulls hard. It will not move.
 It stays in mid air a short distance from the falling water. Lornedei
 takes one step back into the cave, and the goblet is suddenly willing
 to go with her.
 Staring at the stubborn object in her hand, she frowns.
 "The Goblet does not want to leave the cave Master!"

>put goblet on pillar
 She puts the silver goblet on the stone pillar.

 In the River (By the Waterfall)
 She is in the middle of a short stretch of the river, with the
 forbidden forest leaning over the restless water from both riverbanks.
 A cover of gray mist hangs over the treetops. In-between, where there
 ought to be clear sky, a fog hangs low. Out of that mist, to the
 northwest, water falls from unknown heights. Down takes her back to the
 bottom.

>go down
 She dives down.

 River Bottom (Below the Waterfall)
 Lornedei swims towards the light. As she comes out of the dark cave, a
 dull thundering meets her. The water is restless, striving noticeably
 back southeast. The bottom is washed clean from debris and vegetation.
 There is a dim light from above.

>se

 Caves (Where Bubbles Rise)
 There is air above in this larger cave and just a hint of light
 somewhere ahead.
 The cave curves gently to the left and continues northwest towards the
 light while south takes her back to the Junction.

 A stream of bubbles rises from the pitch-black bottom, meets the girl
 on its way up, and then explode in a glittering cascade of air around
 her.

>go southwest

 Caves (The Latent Waters)
 There's a soft light and a rippling from the surface up above.
 Southeast takes her back to the Junction and there is a ragged hole in
 the rock to the northeast. The bottom here is mostly sand and rocks,
 and nothing grows here.

 The water is still.

>search sand
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go up

 Cave of Knowing
 After the total silence during the swim through the tunnels, eerie
 sounds shock her into being as still as she can.
 Every sound reverberates in this chamber: the sound of dripping water,
 the soft splashing from Lornedei's movements, her heavy gasping for air
 before it fades into a shallow, awe struck breathing.
 This is a big, nearly circular cave. The ceiling is enveloped in
 darkness but a light, barely more than the glow of fireflies, comes
 from the walls themselves.
 The mirror of dark water reflects the light.
 Above a narrow ledge sticking out from the west wall, carvings cover a
 big part of the wall.


>examine carvings
 The stone print fills the entire wall above the ledge. The writing is
 old and forgotten but the essence of the message should still be in the
 stone itself.

>reach carvings
 She may be better off if she gets up on the ledge first. She is quite
 tired.

>get on ledge
 She gets onto the Narrow ledge.

>examine ledge
 Lornedei is sitting with her back against the west wall. The ledge is
 barely wide enough to sit on, let alone standing, as the wall leans
 outward over the dark water.

>reach stone
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>reach carvings
 Lornedei places a cold, wet hand on the carvings.
 "I cannot understand it all. There is a message here that will not
 reveal itself to me. What I understand, or think I understand is this:

 One great is the light.
 One great is the dark.
 One great is the lost one that judges us all."

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>eat berry
 (Taking the handful of white berries first.)
 Lornedei eats one of the white berries.
 "These are actually not too awful Master! They remind me of something
 but I cannot recall what." She shrugs.
 Lornedei's magic just went up by three.

>put berries in rucksack
 She drops the handful of white berries into the leather rucksack.

>SAVE
>cf7
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>exits

>go up

 Caves (Among the Restless Roots)
 The space she is in is not more then twice Lornedei's length in any
 direction. The tangle of roots makes the space seem smaller yet. The
 pale mass of roots stirs restlessly. Below her, the inky water of the
 river flows past.


>take red worm
 As you wish.
 Something wraps itself around Lornedei's hand. She pulls her hand away
 with a shriek.

>put red worm on roots
 Lornedei places the red worm on one of the roots. It sniffs the air,
 surveying the roots for a moment before taking a huge bite out of one.
 All the roots seem to stir and shudder, trying to avoid the biting
 pest. After only a few big bites out of the root the red worm seems
 satisfied. The root's restless movement seizes right away as the worm
 curls up into a ball. Lornedei picks it up again.

>put red worm in urn. take yellow worm. put yellow worm on roots
 She drops the shiny red worm into the old tarnished bronze urn.
 Something wraps itself around Lornedei's hand. She pulls her hand away
 with a shriek.
 As you wish.
 A low squeaking makes Lornedei turn around. The sound stops.
 The skinny worm starts biting the moist tangle of roots. One after
 another get to feel the starved fury of the yellow worm. The roots
 start to shake violently to get rid of the furiously eating worm. Big
 pieces of moist wood are torn from the roots. Some disappear down the
 worm's seemingly bottomless stomach. Most, however, drop in the water.

 Eventually, the tree gives in. The roots move aside, revealing a
 passage south into darkness. Lornedei picks up the worm that oddly
 enough looks no less skinny now.
 A low squeaking makes Lornedei turn around. The sound stops.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>go south
 After squeezing herself through the tight passage she is not just
 dripping wet but also filthy and out of breath.

 Hall of Severance
 Slowly, Lornedei looks around this dark clearing. An oppressive gray
 fog hangs over everything and seems to add weight to the air itself.
 There is a presence here. Something is waiting among the dark trees.
 Something sinister.
 The gray mist hides the sun from sight and there is no way to make out
 which direction is which.
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.
 A greenish fog seeps out of the darkness between the trees. Lazily it
 gathers itself until a green pillar of mist is formed. It glides slowly
 over the dead grass and stops next to Lornedei. It starts to spin.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.
 The beetle squirms its way out of Lornedei's grasp and drops to the
 ground. It runs off, climbs up on the stone well, climbs back down,
 crawls through the bushes and seems to inspect the stone house, to
 finally stop at one of the paths.

>examine green mist
 A stubby pillar of greenish fog hovers just above ground level. It
 spins around its own axis like a slow motion whirlwind.

>enter house

 Hall of Severance (In the House of Penance)
  Lornedei steps through the crumbling opening into a darkness that is
 not quite total. There is dim light sifting down from the ruined
 ceiling above. She glances up, perhaps fearing that the whole
 construction will give up at her intrusion.

 But the only thing falling down on her is the weight of history;
 stories of cruel ignorance, memories that linger. The light catches a
 glittering thread and Lornedei swipes at the descending spider before
 it can land on her. With a grimace she steps on it before it can
 scramble away, burying it in the dry dirt. She looks around, but if
 there are more spiders here, they keep out of her way.
 The many years have taken its toll on this house. The circular wall
 tapers slightly towards the ceiling. Above her, a framework of thick
 beams support several generations worth of spider webs. There is not
 much left of the roof now. The light from outside leaks in through the
 holes in the ceiling. It magnifies the presence of fine dry dust that
 floats lazily in the still air. Long since rotted straw and reeds cover
 the earthen floor.

 A pair of rusty manacles hangs on the wall.
 "Master?"

>search straw
 Lornedei kicks the rotted remains around with a grimace, holding her
 breath against the odors rising from the floor. A shriek cuts through
 the still air and she takes a step back.

 Empty sockets in a yellowed and cracked skull stare up at her. She
 takes another step towards the opening and starts to turn to leave.
 Something causes her to look back, though, perhaps a sense of shame for
 disturbing this final resting place. She stares at the human skull
 peeking out from its shallow grave, and goes to cover it again. Before
 she can throw a handful of the old straw over it, she stops. There is a
 sudden glimmering light from within one of the dark holes. There is
 something inside the skull. She also notices a small pouch in the
 shallow grave, half buried in the dirt.

>take pouch. look in skull. take amulet. wear amulet
 As you wish.
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.
 In the cracked skull is An amulet.
 Lornedei's hand trembles at the touch.
 "So much power!"

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]
 Lornedei hangs the amulet around her neck. Immediately it flares up and
 shines brightly. The blinding light fades somewhat and the light
 becomes soft and steady. Lornedei shivers in delight from the power in
 the crystal that gives itself to her.

 Lornedei's magic just went up by one hundred.


>examine skull
 The skull shares the shallow grave under straw, dirt and reeds with the
 rest of the skeleton. Lornedei takes only a quick look at the bones
 before making sure they are covered. They are of no interest to her.

 The skull is cracked, and brutally so it seems. This person, whoever it
 may have been, was sent to the afterlife with the help of something
 heavy but blunt, a rock, perhaps a hammer. No doubt it was swung in
 fury or fear. Lornedei cringes when she sees scattered pieces of bone
 near the skull. She quickly covers the teeth, hiding them from view
 while holding a protective hand over her own mouth.

>reach skull
 Lornedei places a hand lightly on the skull and shuts her eyes. A low
 sound escapes her tightly closed lips. The final moments of a girl's
 life spill into her mind. An already pale face turns ash gray and she
 trembles, tries to pull her hand away, but cannot.

 "No! No please." The screams have lost their strength and turned to
 whispers, gurgling coughing, and inaudible pleading. Now they are only
 in her mind. She knows there will be no mercy. She tries to turn to the
 side on the hard ground, tries to spit the teeth out before they choke
 her, but another blow forces her head the other way. Someone is holding
 her legs down. She cannot pull them up, bring them together, cannot get
 rid of the weight. Something else is pushing down on her stomach, a
 boot, and she cannot turn, barely breathe. Something is holding her
 hands, but then one comes free. She lifts it to her face. The next
 thing that breaks are four of her fingers along with her nose, the nose
 that is underneith the hand.

 There are four of them. They take turns with her, sharing the pleasure
 of beating her with the rock. They take turns using her body, the part
 of her body that is not yet covered in blood. She cannot see them. What
 slits might be left to see through have filled with blood. She has no
 wish to see. She knows it will be over soon, very soon.

 There is no salvation, no hope of rescue, but in the end there is no
 longer any pain. When Anadei's body is used up and is systematically
 broken up, the way it is told it should be done, she is long gone.

 Lornedei reels back from the skull, turns, and staggers away from you.
 She leans forward and struggles to avoid being sick.

 You watch her with clinical curiosity. Can this young and soft girl, in
 the end, do what you need her to do? Can she banish the evil and then
 bring back the old ways? The old beliefs? Perhaps even the old rituals
 could be revived. You must think this over as time moves on. For now,
 you turn your attention to the task at hand.

 Lornedei is watching you. She is pale but composed.
 "Her name was Anadei, daughter of Meredea. She was the last of the
 light bearers Master. They feared her so much that she was ordered
 dead." Lornedei laughs dryly and continues with a cynicism very unlike
 her. "I guess they completed that task, but that is not all they did."
 She shudders and will not say more on the subject.
 Lornedei's magic just dropped by five.

>bury skull
 The cracked skull? Think that will grow?

>cover skull.
 That's not something she can close.

>take skull
 As you wish.

>heal skull
 She cannot heal things that are not alive.

>wear skull
 She can't wear that!

 Lornedei shakes her head.

 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>go up
 There is no way she could climb up to the ceiling. The building would
 most likely drop down on top of her.

>out
 She steps out in the clearing.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.

 The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly.

 She can also see a large black beetle (Taking a nap at the moment.)
 here.

>examine bushes
 These bushes resemble those at the village road, but there are quite a
 few more of them. These look even more gnarled and deformed, as though
 starved of clean water and sunlight.
 These also have thorns as well as, oddly enough, plenty of purple nuts.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>take nuts
 "No thank you Master. Only a fool would try to do anything with those
 nuts." To emphasize her point, she gives the nearest bush a kick and a
 cloud of putrid dust from the leaves rises. A thorny nut falls to the
 ground.
 The deformed bushes rustle and seem to reach for her.

>take nut
 Lornedei carefully picks up the nut. She quickly drops it in the
 rucksack.

>kick bush
 No Master. Why would I do anything like that?

>ask ld about nuts
 Lornedei shrugs.
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.

>reach oak
 The tree fades away before Lornedei's inner sight. For a moment, there
 is nothing but a shimmering mist all around her. Then three shapes
 appear in the distance. They are trees, that she is sure of. Giant
 trees. One shimmers in gold, one is shrouded in black smoke, and one is
 bright green. The green tree suddenly fades into the distance, leaving
 only a greenish mist. Once gone, the black tree grows. It reaches
 towards the golden tree, shades it and suffocates it. The image fades.
 Lornedei's magic drops by one.
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.

>SAVE
>cf8
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>open pouch
 She opens the small leather pouch, revealing a golden acorn.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like
 someone whimpering. Someone, or something.

>go up

 Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak)
  A shiver runs through the tree and the shrill song of the leaves seems
 to increase in volume for a moment. Lornedei folds herself over the
 branch and stays hanging precariously over it. She looks down. The
 clearing below her swims out of focus, seems to move away from her and
 then come rushing back at her. She clings desperately to the scorched
 limb, unsure if she is going to slide backwards and down on the ground,
 or tip over forward with the same fatal result. She shuts her eyes
 hard.

 And the world is still once more. Very carefully, she lifts one leg
 over the branch and then she is sitting steady. She opens her eyes and
 with a sigh of relief. The clearing looks as it should, all
 considering.

 Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper
 branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She
 can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is
 nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing
 and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can
 climb down to the ground or follow the branch.

>reach smoke
 "I cannot use my powers to reach into the smoke Master. It frightens
 me."

>follow branch
 Lornedei follows the branch outwards towards the smoke. It seems to
 rise and meet her and then it surrounds her.

 Nightmare's Den
 A dark wall of smoke surrounds her. Occasionally a ragged veil of
 broken vapor is detached from it and dissolves in the air. There is
 nothing here. Even the ground is gone. Although she can feel it under
 her feet, she will not try to touch it.
 "I feel so strange. It is so dark here, so wrong. Everything seems to
 be turning. I feel something here but it is hidden from me."
 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>sleep
 Lornedei sits down, puts her head in her hands and shuts her eyes.
 "I should not Master. But I feel so strange."
 "The air is so hard to breathe. So dark here."
 "I feel ill."
  Amidst her dream, Lornedei speaks. An insistant whispering. Spoken
 through her, not by her.

 "Wake up and be mine.
 Wake up and come to me.
 Give your blood to the seed.
 Give me a tree.
 Destroy the other one, the golden one.
 We will rule together.
 Wake and I am with you.

 WAKE NOW!

 The hall of severance is silent. The whispering from the forest is
 gone, the air seems dense.

 Lornedei is sitting on the stone altar with her head bent as in prayer.
 The long hair hides her face from you and you listen to her breathing.
 The dry whispers and the shrill singing from the black leaves returns
 as Lornedei wakes up.
 Slowly, the girl looks up. She seems surprised and her eyes glide over
 the clearing as if she's never seen it before.

 When she looks at you, her eyes are gray and a weary smile turns into a
 grin. Then the grin fades and her entire body tenses in fear. She turns
 her face away from you.

 A very tentative voice speaks up from the old stone well. "Girl?"
 Lornedei turns her head and stares at the tiny creature sitting on a
 blade of razor grass next to the well. She takes two fast steps toward
 the fly. With a screech, the fly buzzes off to sit on the stone house
 roof. "The same you are not Girl. I know not if you can be trusted
 Girl." Lornedei picks up a rock and throws it at the fly that buzzes
 off to sit on the stone altar. "Will you listen Girl?" Lornedei crosses
 her arms and glares at the fly. After a moment's indecision, she nods.

 The fly moves to the edge of the altar and pauses a moment. "You have
 met one of Raccdaha's minions I see. You must have set it free. Shame.
 Such shame. Do not believe him Girl! Raccdaha is not strong enough now
 to possess you from where he is hiding, but he lets his lesser demons
 do his bidding. Do not believe the messages he sends!" Lornedei takes a
 step forward and raises a hand to swat the fly, but the fly is already
 sitting in the black oak. "Oh dear, temper, temper. Me, yes, will be in
 this place to tell the story when your god evicts the demon that is in
 you Girl." The firefly disappears with a pop and a flash.
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.

>h ld
 Lornedei is possessed. She is unpredictable and at times
 self-destructive. Her mind is a battle-field of opposites.

>enter sleepwalker
 Lornedei's stare is not just hostile. It is pure poison. She has no
 intention of entering the sleepwalker.
 Lornedei shivers. She looks behind her. There is nothing there.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like
 something that does not want to be heard. Careful, tentative.

>take nuts
 "No, I only need one. I have it."

>wake ld
 "Just leave me be! I have my eyes open, can you not see that?"
 The beetle runs off to one of the paths. It spins around once before

 A dry black leaf falls down to rest on Lornedei's shoulder. It crumbles
 into dust and is gone.
 The beetle scrambles through the dead grass to one of the paths. It
 spins around and comes back to Lornedei.

>touch sleepwalker
 Lornedei is clearly skeptical. What the sleep walker feels like does
 not interest her.
 The beetle disappears into the crumbling stone house. It comes back
 out, stays a moment in the opening, waving its antennae, before coming
 back to Lornedei.

>reach sleepwalker
 Lornedei turns her back to it.
 "I will not waste magic on that!"

>reach ld
 "I cannot! I will not! Just leave my mind alone!"
 Lornedei shivers. She looks behind her. There is nothing there.
 The beetle runs off to one of the paths. It spins around once before
 returning to Lornedei.

>enter house

 Hall of Severance (In the House of Penance)
 The many years have taken its toll on this house. The circular wall
 tapers slightly towards the ceiling. Above her, a framework of thick
 beams support several generations worth of spider webs. There is not
 much left of the roof now. The light from outside leaks in through the
 holes in the ceiling. It magnifies the presence of fine dry dust that
 floats lazily in the still air. Long since rotted straw and reeds cover
 the earthen floor.

 A pair of rusty manacles hangs on the wall.

>examine manacles
 Lornedei shakes her head.
 Lornedei shivers. She looks behind her. There is nothing there.

>take manacles
 "Interesting, but I have no use for those. For the moment."

>pet yellow worm
 "Do I really want to? No!"

>follow beetle
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine beetle
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>take black leaf
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

 A pair of rusty manacles hangs on the wall.

>out
 She steps out in the clearing.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.

 The sleepwalker is here. It has stopped spinning.

 She can also see a large black beetle (Spinning around waving its
 antennae at the moment.) here.
 Lornedei reaches down to scratch her ankle.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like a
 bird, unlike any other.

>follow beetle
 The black beetle is still for a few moments. Sniffing the air for
 danger. Then suddenly it decides where to go and takes off along one of
 the paths. Lornedei follows.

 Shadows reach for her, imaginary or not, from the growing darkness
 between the trees, as she moves into the forbidden forest. The beetle
 is ahead of her, leading on, stopping now and then to find its way. The
 path twists and changes direction so many times that Lornedei has to
 rely totally on her glimmering little guide.

 Lornedei keeps her eye on the bug, but looks around now and then. The
 trees all look the same. No matter which kind they might have been
 originally, they are now all black and scorched. Clusters of leaves,
 singing their strange melody, hang from nearly all of them, some nearly
 touching the undergrowth. The forest is cold, the air thick, and
 Cowering under the stare of the shadows, she moves on. The bug leads.
 It runs ahead, over a dry and cracked puddle of mud, through the
 hollowed out insides of a dead tree, forward.

 The beetle stops. Its antennae wave frantically and it spins around on
 the ground a couple of times. When Lornedei reaches down to pick it up
 it quickly unfolds its wings, takes off with a buzzing and disappears
 among the trees.

 Forbidden Forest (Near the Raven Tree)
 Disappointed, Lornedei looks around.
 "I think I am lost."
 The scorched trees tower over anyone and anything unfortunate enough to
 be here. An air of ill will hangs over the treetops.
 The gray fog touches the trees highest branches, hiding the sun from
 view. Two paths lead into the black forest from here.
 Lornedei sighs.

 An enormous raven sits high up on a blackened branch, surrounded by the
 bug like leaves. It stares unblinking at Lornedei as she moves around
 in the crossing. It greets her with a threatening flutter with the
 wings, a guttural croaking and constant nervous sidestepping on the
 branch.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>take black leaf
 Lornedei grabs one of the black leaves in the nearest cluster and
 twists it loose from the branch. The leaf falls over and the beetle
 quickly takes shape in her hand. When it is done growing, it crawls up
 on Lornedei's shoulder.
>give beetle to raven
 Lornedei holds the beetle in a tight grip, and shows it to the bird.
 The black bird leans its head to one side. Most interested, it moves
 restlessly on its branch. Lornedei slowly puts the beetle on the
 ground. She steps back and waits.

 The beetle turns towards Lornedei, turns back, notices the bird and
 makes a run for it. It heads for the high grass. The hungry bird dives
 from the tree and drops in a cloud of dirt between the bug and the safe
 undergrowth. The beetle stops dead in its track, changes direction and
 rushes forward, but the bird is already there, flipping the bug over.
 For one moment, it is immobilized. That moment is enough.

 While the beetle is helpless, the bird gets to the eating. Big chunks
 of the insect's body is ripped out and swallowed. At some point, the
 legs and antennae stop moving. Finally, there is nothing left of the
 beetle but an empty shell, lined with a few sad remains of legs, flesh,
 and unidentifiable insect parts.

 The bird skips along the path where, if one looks hard enough, one can
 see another trail. The bird turns to Lornedei and croaks.
 Waiting.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>follow raven
 Lornedei dares a careful step towards the black bird. It turns and hops
 along the path a short distance before it again faces the girl.
 Waiting.

 Lornedei takes another step and the bird takes off in the air. It flies
 in circles in front of her, high up and almost out of sight at times
 but always close enough for Lornedei to follow. The path winds its way
 through and around the disturbing shadows of the forbidden forest.
 Fallen trees and dense undergrowth is constantly in her way and she has
 to climb over, through, or around these obstacles, while keeping an eye
 on the bird. It is just ahead and above her. She follows the black
 bird, expecting the cold grip of the forgotten ones around her ankles
 at any moment. Images of soul wrenching, flesh ripping, and blood
 drinking spirits run through her mind. Nothing happens. Exhausted and
 bruised, with her clothes torn and dusty, she stumbles on.

 Something grabs her foot; she loses her balance and falls forward with
 a painful thud. Frozen in a breathless heap on the ground, she takes a
 moment to gather her strength as well as her breath. The bird croaks,
 Light seeps in through her closed eyelids.

 She looks up in time to catch a final glimpse of the bird. It
 disappears into a glowing sunset beyond a desolate field.

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Slowly Lornedei gets up on her feet. Nearly blinded by the light from
 the dying sun, she inspects the damage. She sighs deeply.

 She opens her mouth to speak again but the words never come. She takes
 in the view of this seemingly empty wasteland in shocked silence for
 some time. She swallows. A dry wind tugs at her clothing while playing
 restlessly in the dry ground.
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 Lornedei turns her head slowly from side to side, dazed. She blinks.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>go east

 Wasteland (By the Circle of Stones)
 Lornedei walks east and the ground slopes down. It becomes increasingly
 difficult to walk. On the other side of the valley she is entering, the
 forest resumes. At the bottom of the slope where the sharp rocks slip
 under her feet, heat ripples the air. Lornedei makes her way down.

 This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden
 forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her
 out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces
 across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken
 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.

 There is a fire inside the ring of stones, blasting out heat and light.
 Shadows cast by the stones stretch out from the circle. Their wavering
 tips caress the ragged ground where it begins to ascend to the plane
 above.

 A black plaque lies near the center of the fire pit.

>throw lamp at boulder
 The stones are more or less round. Anything placed on the stones would
 drop to the ground.

>examine stones
 The circle is almost ten paces wide. Inside the edging of boulders, the
 ground sinks further down, into another bowl. This one is smooth and
 perfectly round.

>throw lamp at fire
 No, that is not what she had in mind.

>throw lamp at smooth boulder
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>throw lamp at round boulder
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine boulder
 The circle is almost ten paces wide. Inside the edging of boulders, the
 ground sinks further down, into another bowl. This one is smooth and
 perfectly round.

>throw lamp at it
 The stones are more or less round. Anything placed on the stones would
 drop to the ground.

>break lamp
 Lornedei lets a blue spark appear in one palm. She focuses and the
 light turns red. She quickly moves the fairy lamp until she is holding
 it between both hands. the red light seeps through her fingers and a
 sizzling is heard. A cloud of steam surrounds her hands.
 "Ouch! The little bastard bit me!" A storm of ugly words fly out of her
 mouth as the crystal spider drops to the ground.
 Lornedei looks over her shoulder into the dark forest, anxious.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>take spider
 the spider jumps backwards. It apparently doesn't like her.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like
 something that does not want to be heard. Careful, tentative.

>examine spider
 It's a large spider made of crystal. It has curled up as if either dead
 or sleeping most of the time. It is hard to tell which. It gives off a
 cold sparkling light and has a pair of multi facetted eyes. Oddly
 enough, the eyes seem both beady and shifty. No matter from where it is
 observed, it seems to glare suspiciously. She will have to touch the
 spider to examine it further. That is, if it will let her.

>touch spider
 Lornedei shakes her head. She has no wish to touch that thing. It
 bites!

>push boulder
 Lornedei turns her hand palm side up, looking at the boulder closest to
 her. Then she thinks the better of it and gives the big stone a hard
 push with the bottom of her dirty sandal. It tips over and rolls down
 in the pit where it settles on top of the fire, suffocating it.

 "BUZZ! BUZZ!" The firefly sits on one of the big stones in the circle.
 "Oh, dear, much gooder I say. Too hot, much too hot it was here. Good
 job Girl. Now I can... " The fly crawls down the side of the rock and
 disappears in a small hole in the ground. A tiny voice pipes up from
 some kind of hollow down below. "Oh, still hot, Most uncomfortable it
 is but... yes!" From the hole comes intense buzzing and grunting
 followed by huffing an puffing and a cloud of dust. The fly comes out
 of the hole that caves in on itself, dragging something. "Ah, I knew it
 would be ready, long cooking it needs yes."

 With more buzzing and grunting, the fly takes off. Hanging in a tiny
 netting seemingly made of fine grass or some other kind of plant fiber,
 is a well baked, somewhat wrinkled white berry. It is still warm and
 steam rises from it. With no further waste of breath, the fly along
 with its hot meal, disappears with a pop and a flash. The scent of
 baked berry lingers for a moment until it dissipates.
 Lornedei turns her head towards a sudden rustling in the forbidden
 forest. There is nothing there.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>take plaque
 (the small black plaque)
 If you insist.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine it
 It's a totally black round plaque. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's palm. The smooth stone is of a kind that Lornedei has never
 seen. A strange picture is carved on one side. It looks like a flying
 insect of some sort, with a giant tree in the background.

>go north

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.
 Lornedei's shadow trembles and disappears. In an instant, it is back.
 She seems not to notice.

>go south

 Wasteland (By the Circle of Stones)
 This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden
 forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her
 out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces
 across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken
 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A big round stone lies in the middle of the pit. The fire is gone.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.

 She can also see A crystal spider with shifty, beady eyes (Curled up
 acting dead at the moment.) here.
 A high pitched squeal from somewhere among the blackened trees fills
 the air, and Lornedei shudders.

>call wolf
 All I understood was a wish to call.

>call
 Lornedei whistles.

>wait
 Lornedei waits as the dry wind tears at her torn clothing.

>wait
 Lornedei waits as the dry wind tears at her torn clothing.
 Lornedei's shadow jerks to life, reaches for her ankle, and pulls. She
 stumbles.

>examine shadow
 It is only a shadow. There is nothing she can do with it.
 Lornedei feels something against her leg. Like a shadow, silent and
 cautious, Deini has come to her. The wolf is sniffing the air, is
 constantly watching Lornedei, but she finally lies down. She puts her
 head on her front paws but keeps constant watch.
 "You just stay out of my way."

>Deini, help
 Deini looks at Lornedei for a moment before she looses interest.

>Deini, sniff
 The wolf just looks at Lornedei. Willing but confused.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.
 Lornedei looks over her shoulder into the dark forest, anxious.

>pet deini
 In an attempt to seem friendly, she calls for Deini. The wolf
 hesitates. This human is different from the other and there is
 something very wrong with this one.

>deini, kill shadow
 Deini stands still, seemingly wondering about Lornedei's choice of
 enemy.

>go north

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.

>examine tree
 These are scattered remains of a tree. Mostly ashes, a few charred
 branches, a hollowed out trunk lying on its side, all petrified by time
 and lack of rain. All is covered in years of sand.

>search sand
 She can not find anything that might interest you.

>look in tree
 Lornedei looks around, in the trunk, kicks away some dirt, but all she
 finds is more sad remains of the tree. Anything of interest is long
 since gone.

>examine ground
 (the ground)
 The soil is dry and starved of both moisture and nutrition. It looks
 and feels dead.

>climb tree
 There's no way she could.

>kill tree
 The tree is already as dead as it can be, so what would be the point?

>put yellow worm on tree
 Placing things on the petrified tree will not do her any good.

>break tree
 The tree is already as dead as it can be, so what would be the point?

>heal ld
 There may not be a way to heal her now. She has been changed. There is
 something dark lurking in her mind. Perhaps if you could get that
 presence out. Perhaps an exorcism?

>vomit
 "What was that you said?"

>turn head 360 degrees
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>pray
 She may or may not. Just hope that her prayers go to you and not
 something... else.

>search ld
 Lornedei is wearing a shirt, a pair of riding pants and sandals. Type
 inv to see what else she is carrying.

>reach ld
 "I cannot! I will not! Just leave my mind alone!"

>look in ld
 Lornedei is wearing a shirt, a pair of riding pants and sandals. Type
 inv to see what else she is carrying.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>examine demon
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine shadow
 It is only a shadow. There is nothing she can do with it.

>zap shadow
 It is only a shadow. There is nothing she can do with it.

>kill shadow
 Light banishes one shadow while creating another. Then how can a shadow
 be killed?

>wear amulet
 "Wear that? No! It hates me."

>go southwest

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.

>go north

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.

>go west

 Castle Courtyard
 Lornedei steps in-between a big wall that continues north, away from
 her, and the remains of another wall trailing west. What stands before
 her is only a small part of a castle. The rest of it, including any
 main gate or towers, is gone, as if cut away. She stops and looks
 around.

 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 Lornedei enters a long stone hall. The sudden noise of her own foot
 falls echoing makes her stop after just a few steps. She stands just
 inside the gate. The corridor is dim and it takes a while for her eyes
 to adjust to the darkness.
 The wide stone corridor continues north for perhaps sixty feet and
 there is a dim light at the far end.
 She takes a few more steps forward through the dusty corridor. She
 stops at an opening in the wall where a staircase leads down into
 darkness.

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 Lornedei leans into the opening in the wall, trying to see what is
 below the dark staircase. There is light down there. Without further
 hesitation, she descends the dusty stone steps.

 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

>examine statue
 The stone statue stands against the south wall. It seems undamaged by
 what ever happened here. It is a woman. She is dressed in a guard's
 robust clothing and she is standing with her feet somewhat apart, one
 arm bent to let her hand rest on a stone dagger at her waist.
 The statue is holding up its right arm as if holding something, perhaps
 a staff or a spear, but the hand is empty. The stone woman looks as if
 she could wake up at any moment, ready to protect.
 The polished stone eyes are fixed on something in the northeast corner
 of the chamber.

>search debris
 "I have no intention of crawling in there. Find someone else to do
 that. Perhaps you, god as you are, can conjure up some faithful and
 ridiculously loyal companion to do that kind of work.

>put red worm in debris
 She needs to be holding the shiny red worm before she can put it into
 something else.

>take red worm
 If you insist.

>put it in debris
 That cannot be used to contain items. The purpose here is otherwise.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>put red worm on debris
 Placing things on the rubble will not do her any good.
 There is a shadow stretching out on the ground behind Lornedei. It
 folds into inky black and then it rises, takes one step away from her,
 and is gone.

>drop red worm
 Your wish is her command.

>red worm, search debris
 She can't talk to the shiny red worm.

>take red worm
 If you insist.

>put it in urn
 She drops the shiny red worm into the old tarnished bronze urn.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 167.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a small black plaque
   a cracked skull
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a small leather pouch (which is open)
     a golden acorn
   a skinny yellow worm
   a bone
   a small dented silver plate
   a small water sack (which is closed)
     the water from the Elder's spring
   an old tarnished bronze urn
     a shiny red worm
     a fat blue worm
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a purple nut with thorns
     a handful of white berries
     a loaf of horrid bread
     a piece of cheese

>yellow worm, search debris
 She can't talk to the skinny yellow worm.

>look in debris
 "I have no intention of crawling in there. Find someone else to do
 that. Perhaps you, god as you are, can conjure up some faithful and
 ridiculously loyal companion to do that kind of work.

>whistle
 Lornedei whistles.

>wait
 The spiral that is life keeps on turning.

>wait
 The spiral that is life keeps on turning.

>wake ld
 "Just leave me be! I have my eyes open, can you not see that?"
 Lornedei hears careful steps behind her. She turns towards a very
 reluctantly approaching Deini. The wolf sneezes.

>again
 "Just leave me be! I have my eyes open, can you not see that?"

>again
 "Just leave me be! I have my eyes open, can you not see that?"

>again
 "Just leave me be! I have my eyes open, can you not see that?"

>Deini, search debris
>again
 Deini sniffs around. After a while, she comes back, carrying an old
 torch. She drops it at Lornedei's feet.

 Deini sniffs a couple of the rocks and sneezes. She seems to search
 aimlessly and finds nothing of interest.

>take torch
 If you insist.

>examine torch
 The old torch must have been lying around here for many years, along
 with many others. It's totally useless and may just fall apart if given
 a harsh glance.

>put torch in statue
 The only thing capable of holding items on the statue, is the grasping
 hand. Try to put the old torch there instead.

>put torch in hand
 Lornedei places the torch in the stone hand. It does not really fit so
 she forces it down in the hole. It stands nearly upright in place for a
 moment. Then, the stone fingers flex and spread. The torch topples over
 and drops to the floor as the hand tightens its grip around its
 imaginary object again.

>take torch
 If you insist.

>deini, search debris
 Deini sniffs a couple of the rocks and sneezes. She seems to search
 aimlessly and finds nothing of interest.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>light torch
 Nothing would benefit from that.
 Deini comes up to Lornedei and puts her nose in the girl's hand.
 Lornedei pulls her hand away.

>go up

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go north
 Lornedei walks towards the dim light. The corridor ends, the floor
 drops away, and beyond is the mist. The edge of the cliff itself has
 dropped off, taking the entire inner castle down with it. The entire
 northwest corner of the big ledge has slid down to the bottom of the
 ravine.

 Lornedei takes a quick look down the ravine, through veils of mist, but
 the floor suddenly feels very unsteady under her feet. She returns to
 the opening to the staircase.

>go south

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

>whistle
 Lornedei whistles.

>wait
 Lornedei waits as the dry wind tears at her torn clothing.

>wait
 Lornedei waits as the dry wind tears at her torn clothing.
 Lornedei's shadow trembles and disappears. In an instant, it is back.
 She seems not to notice.

>whistle
 Lornedei whistles.

>wait
 Lornedei waits as the dry wind tears at her torn clothing.
 Lornedei feels something against her leg. Like a shadow, silent and
 cautious, Deini has come to her. The wolf is sniffing the air, is
 constantly watching Lornedei, but she finally lies down. She puts her
 head on her front paws but keeps constant watch.
 "You just stay out of my way."

>deini, search rubble
 Deini takes off and enters the tunnel through the big pile of rubble.
 She shows up safely on the other side. A number of loud sneezes and a
 cloud of rising dust show her path. After some time, she comes crawling
 out again, dragging something with her. Between her teeth is a long
 spear. She drops it in front of Lornedei, looking mighty happy.

>take spear
 If you insist.

>examine spear
 The spear is a head taller than Lornedei. The dark wood is decorated
 with carvings and the stone tip is sharp.

>reach spear
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)

 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

>give spear to statue
 Lornedei puts the spear into the grasping hand. It is a perfect fit.
 The hand suddenly tightens. The stone fingers crackle slightly and a
 puff of dust flies from it as it grips the spear.

>wait
 The spiral that is life keeps on turning.

>examine statue
 The stone guard stands in the southeast corner staring intently at the
 opposite corner of the chamber. In her right hand she has a long wooden
 spear with a stone tip.

>talk to statue
 You wish her to talk to the stone statue? Seems a bit odd to me.

>touch statue
 Lornedei brushes off some of the dust gathered on the statue an
 sneezes.
 Lornedei wipes her forehead with her shirtsleeve.

>reach statue
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>move statue
 The stone statue cannot be moved in any way. Lornedei makes a couple of
 attempts of pushing the statue but there is not much point in trying.
 Lornedei's shadow tears one shadow-leg from Lornedei's real one, then
 the other. It fades as it rises. Once upright, it melts into Lornedei.
 She shivers.

>go northwest
 There is nothing there but rubble and cracked marble walls. She can't
 go that way.

>examine statue
 The stone guard stands in the southeast corner staring intently at the
 opposite corner of the chamber. In her right hand she has a long wooden
 spear with a stone tip.
 There is a shadow stretching out on the ground behind Lornedei. It
 folds into inky black and then it rises, takes one step away from her,
 and is gone.

>look northwest
 Cracked marble in walls and floor. Rubble. Nothing of interest catches
 her eye.
 Lornedei's shadow stretches out behind her. It sits up. It reaches. It
 touches the exposed skin on her neck before lying back down. Lornedei
 scratches her neck furiously.

>turn statue
 The stone statue cannot be moved in any way. Lornedei makes a couple of
 attempts of pushing the statue but there is not much point in trying.

>go west
 Lornedei steps closer to the huge hole in the wall. One glimpse down is
 enough. She steps back on unsteady legs.

>go up

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go south

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 Deini is here.

>go west
 A few paces away, the courtyard ends abruptly as the ground is replaced
 by the ravine. A vertical cliff of bare rock is all that is left. If
 there was a western wall there, it now lies at the bottom of the
 ravine, along with a big part of the castle. On the other side, the
 forbidden forest starts again. Lornedei quickly backs away from the
 edge.

>take leaf
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go south

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Ravine)
 Lornedei stands on an outcropping overlooking a deep ravine going as
 far north as she can see. The ledge seems to be the remains of a road,
 cut off by the creation of the break in the earth. On the other side of
 the ravine, there's a barely visible opening through the trees. There
 is no way over there though. A steady wind tears at her clothes and
 hair in sudden gusts that seem eager to throw her off balance.

 East, northeast and north are the ways off the ledge.

>examine ledge
 Some things in this world are not for her to be concerned with.

>take leaf
 Lornedei grabs one of the black leaves in the nearest cluster and
 twists it loose from the branch. The leaf falls over and the beetle
 quickly takes shape in her hand. When it is done growing, it crawls up
 on Lornedei's shoulder.
>go down
 Lornedei takes one step towards the edge of the ravine, then another
 longer step away from it. The ravine is too deep and too wide to cross.

>go east

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 A high pitched squeal from somewhere among the blackened trees fills
 the air, and Lornedei shudders.

>turn spear
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>go northwest

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 Deini is here.
 There is a shadow stretching out on the ground behind Lornedei. It
 folds into inky black and then it rises, takes one step away from her,
 and is gone.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

>turn spear
 Lornedei grabs the spear on each side of the hand and turns it. A click
 is heard from inside the statue and the entire guard woman rotates on
 her right foot, swinging her left side outwards.
 In doing that, a slab of stone comes loose from the corner thus
 revealing a narrow passage to the southeast.

>se

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Mirrors)
 Silence, perfect stillness, a sense of waiting.
 As soon as Lornedei steps past the statue, the sensation overwhelms
 her. For once, she is silent for a long while before making her remark.
 "What a mess!"
 The chamber seems to have survived the devastation of the castle with
 only minor damages though. Sand and scattered pieces of marble lie
 beneath a few cracks in one corner.

 This chamber is over ten paces across and perfectly square. A large
 oval mirror dominates each wall. Four mirrors. North, west, south and
 east.

 Lornedei came in from the northwest. An old burned out torch sits askew
 on the south wall.

 A big pile of stone and steel takes up a large part of the space in the
 middle of the floor.
 "Who would bring that junk down here? Seems very strange to me."

 Lornedei stumbles on a big staff on the floor. She barely avoids
 stepping on a sad looking long dead somebody.

 The dead somebody seems to be the owner of the staff.
 "I believe that this might be one of the Elders."

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine elder
 Lornedei bends down to take a look at the grim pile of bones. The
 figure lies near the west wall with the arms stretched out above the
 head. The grinning skull is bent backwards and in an odd angle. The
 spine showing above the robe it is dressed in has been turned until it
 broke off from the rest of the body. The feet are still protected by a
 pair of leather sandals.
 Lornedei looks around, puzzled.

>examine robe
 The figure on the floor is dressed in a robe that once must have been
 sky blue but now it's faded and covered in dust and cobwebs. The fabric
 is finely woven and smooth. The hems are decorated with golden vines
 just like the sandals that still sit securely on the skeletons feet.

>examine grinning skull
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>take robe
 It is probably better if she leaves them where they are.

>examine pile
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the pile of steel and stone or the
 pile of bones?

>steel
 It is a big pile of stone and steel. It takes up a big portion of the
 floor. She can see small stones and big boulders covered in moss, dirt
 and dust.

 A few of the bigger rocks seem to be attached to each other with steel
 rings and rusty chains. A row, uneven and broken up, of triangular
 pieces of steel sit along an oblong rock near one end of the pile.

>search steel pile
 She can not find anything that might interest you.
 Lornedei reaches down to scratch her ankle.

>examine staff
 It's a heavy staff in what appears to be oak. It reaches Lornedei to
 the shoulder, is thicker in one end and irregular in shape, with the
 natural shape preserved. It is polished and given a patina with many
 years use.

>take it
 If you insist.

>examine mirrors
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>examine north mirror
 A wide and heavy frame surrounds a dark mirror. There is only a dull
 reflection of the chamber behind Lornedei when she looks in it.
 There's an indentation in the top part of the frame. It is empty.


>examine north indentation
 There is an indentation in the top part of the frame. A plaque might
 fit there.

 Under a layer of dust covering the frame, the wood is decorated with
 delicately painted vines and leaves of all sizes and shapes. Tiny
 animals peek out from behind the leaves, which seem to stand out even
 though the surface is flat: a red squirrel's curious gaze, a deer and
 its offspring, ready to flee, a miniature snake on a vine.

 Lornedei reaches down to scratch her ankle.

>examine east mirror
 The glass, underneath a layer of dust, has no reflection whatsoever.
 Lornedei glances at the frame but she just shakes her head in
 puzzlement. She looks away from the strange sight.
 There's an indentation in the top part of the frame. It is empty.


>examine east indentation
 Reluctantly, Lornedei examines the frame. The heavy frame around the
 east mirror has a deep, almost black surface. Delicate, spidery
 carvings cover every surface. The intricate pattern of geometrical
 shapes underlies other shapes. These seem to avoid observation.
 Sometimes a shapeless blob turns into a perfectly logical entity for a
 split second. Although the logic eludes the mind to be just a blob
 again, the feeling of an unreachable, untouchable wisdom remains.
 Lornedei blinks and looks away.

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 167.

 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>examine south mirror
 On the south wall hangs a big oval mirror. The glass is dark and cold.
 There's a shallow indentation in the top part of the frame. It is
 empty.

>examine black plaque
 It's a totally black round plaque. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's palm. The smooth stone is of a kind that Lornedei has never
 seen. A strange picture is carved on one side. It looks like a flying
 insect of some sort, with a giant tree in the background.

>examine south indentation
 The wide frame around the south mirror has a shallow indentation where
 a plaque might fit.

 The frame itself is totally featureless. It has a deep gray polish that
 almost, but not quite, looks like the glass itself.

>put black plaque in east indentation
 Lornedei puts the small black plaque in the round hole on the frame. It
 goes into place with a click.

>examine west mirror
 The glass is cracked and dark. The frame surrounding the broken mirror
 seems to be in bad shape. There appears to be a shallow indentation in
 the top part of the frame. She may need to look closer at the frame.

>examine west indentation
 The wide frame seems at first to be a mosaic of different types of
 frayed fabric. Upon closer inspection, it is clear that the frame is
 made up of different types of wood, stone, and even metal. It has
 however been demolished by something, cut and beaten into a mess of
 splinters. There seems to be an indentation in the top part of the
 frame but it may not be able to hold anything in place.

>heal it
 She cannot heal things that are not alive.

 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

 Lornedei came in from the northwest. An old burned out torch sits askew

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.

 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>pull torch
 The torch is not of any use now. Let's just leave it as it is.

>reach bones
 (the pile of bones)
 Lornedei reaches into the figure on the cold stone floor but something
 is resisting her. Something suddenly gives. The air starts to shimmer
 above the pale bones and a figure rises from the pile. The transparent
 shape standing before her is a man. An old man dressed in a sky blue
 robe, his thin face with a thin white beard looks gaunt and tired
 beyond his apparent age. He is holding a long staff in one hand that
 partially supports his old frail and bent body.
 He is looking around the chamber. He lets his gaze touch the mirrors on
 the wall, rest a moment on the stone pile until he is looking straight
 at Lornedei.
 Assessing her, judging her.
 Suddenly his eyes turn to steel. He seems to recoil from her and swings
 his staff through the air.
 It goes through her body and for a moment, she feels numb, tingling. He
 sinks back down in his remains and is gone.

>h ld
 Lornedei is possessed. She is unpredictable and at times
 self-destructive. Her mind is a battle-field of opposites.

>reach steel
 suddenly Lornedei smiles.
 "If you say so."
 She Lifts one arm, turns the hand over and makes a blue spark appear in
 her palm. Lornedei glances up at you, still smiling, as the blue spark
 turns to red.
 Slowly she turns her head and blows the spark towards the pile.
 The red light drops down and disappears between two rocks. Nothing
 happens for a short while. And then there is movement. Slowly, the
 rocks rearrange themselves, moving into place with a grinding noise
 that causes the entire chamber to vibrate.
 Triangular metal pieces covered in rust and dust, although they seem
 sharp enough, align themselves in two rows.
 Some of the smaller rocks, scattered around the periphery of the pile,
 skip and hop along the dusty floor until they are also in place. There
 is a loud bang as the two largest pieces come together. The noise gets
 louder as hundreds of rocks of all sizes and rusty pieces of metal move
 into place, all at the same time.
 For a heartbeat, everything is still. Then it rises - grunting,
 grinding, and groaning, it rises.
 Lornedei is awestruck, but whispers to the being.
 "Raccdaha!"

>talk to raccdaha
 Lornedei's eyes change again. She smiles.
 "Did you come for me?" She holds up both hands, offering herself to
 him. Everything is silent. A strand of darkness wraps itself around her
 fingers, her hands and her arms.
 "Yes! Take me with you."
 She shuts her eyes. Her body shakes as the spirit caresses her, touches
 her face, her hair. The touch leaves her skin scorched and bleeding.
 She comes to him willingly and all the promises of power, of eternal
 bliss, are coming true.
 The spirit that was once human embraces her. He wraps his arms around
 her body, seeking warmth. He holds her with arms of stone. She melts
 into the darkness.

 Smiling, she lets herself be crushed between stones, cut to pieces by
 sharp metal. He reaches for her hand, which turns to a bloody mess. He
 holds her head, which cracks like a ripe melon. Only then does the
 smile fade from her lips.

 Finally, he nods and looks pleased. He opens his mouth to speak but his
 remains are pulling him back.
 There is not much time. He lifts a hand towards the stone pile. He
 shakes his head violently. Then he moves his hand to indicate the west
 wall while producing a weak smile. He slowly sinks down towards his
 bones with a deep sigh of relief that is felt but never heard.

 The matted surface of the glass suddenly flares up in a cascade of
 crimson sparks. A shower of hot air and red light throws Lornedei back.
 It throws her on the floor, and she desperately claps at her shirt to
 kill the tiny flames. She drags herself back across the dusty floor.

 The moment passes, the sparks fade and die. Lornedei gets up on her
 feet, staring at a wavy, unsettling darkness. There is nothing at all
 beyond the polished frame.

 The portal to the Eternal Void is open.

>go south
 It reaches for her. The void, the darkness. It grabs her. She recoils
 and tries to back away. Tentacles of greasy smoke around and inside her
 pull her towards the void.

 Curiously silent while she is tearing at the darkness surrounding her,
 it drags her relentlessly through the open portal. She gets a hand
 around the frame of the mirror as it pulls her through. Just one
 uselessly grasping and clawing hand. The rest of her is beyond this
 world, and that other world tears her apart.

 An impossible wind rips her hair, clothes, skin and flesh from her
 bones. The dark eternity sucks her in.

 Left in the hall of mirrors is Lornedei's right hand and scattered
 hope.

 Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak)
 Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper
 branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She
 can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is
 nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing
 and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can
 climb down to the ground or follow the branch.

>go down
 Lornedei climbs down.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.

 The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly.
 Black smoke seeps out of the darkness between the trees. The smoke
 gathers itself until a dark pillar of smoke is formed. In erratic,
 twitching moves, it comes closer.

 It stops next to the staring Lornedei. It starts to turn slowly,
 releasing veils of broken smoke from its ragged surface. They dissolve
 in the air and new ones form to take their place.
 "The maker of horrors at night. The roaming nightmare. I thought they
 were stories."
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like
 something that does not want to be heard. Careful, tentative.

>examine nightmare
 A ragged pillar of smoke shifting in black and purple. It is floating
 just above ground level. It spins around its own axis like a slow
 motion whirlwind.
 There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around,
 mystified.
 "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly,
 the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a
 piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end,
 with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with
 Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly
 gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level.
 "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense
 buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it
 from falling.

 "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks
 the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in
 front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of
 straw.
 "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh,
 dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down
 on the ground to listen.

 "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always
 so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a
 long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the
 pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water,
 catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I
 heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He
 pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his
 parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one
 could tell, as he was still only a little boy.

 Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go
 with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was
 gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy
 ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten
 rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his
 home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the
 straw again.

 "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade
 honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers
 he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young.
 Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for
 himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's
 father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With
 magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very
 wrong."

 "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in
 desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love.
 She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than
 you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the
 magic spell to Raccdaha.

 The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body
 in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel
 punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House
 of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast
 forest.

 He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of
 them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he
 felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to
 the other forgotten souls that dwelled there.

 He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally
 felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he
 could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary
 body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing.
 Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He
 spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light
 bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of
 Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many
 years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me,
 cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place
 is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I
 don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest
 somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may
 be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting."

 The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end
 of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from
 Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck
 Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and
 vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a
 scent of burnt straw in the air.

>examine bone
 As far as Lornedei can gather, it's a bone from a dear's leg. It has
 plenty of bite marks on it so this might have been one of Deini's
 unfortunate preys.

>enter well
 "No Master, I will not go down there."
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.

>go north
 Hesitantly she takes a few steps forward, but she has no idea in what
 directions the paths lead. Uncertain, she looks up at you.

>enter roots
 Lornedei drops down into the opening between the roots of the black
 oak. She tumbles down into cool dark water.

 Caves (Among the Restless Roots)
 The space she is in is not more then twice Lornedei's length in any
 direction. The tangle of roots makes the space seem smaller yet. The
 pale mass of roots stirs restlessly. Below her, the inky water of the
 river flows past.

 The roots on the south wall have slid apart enough to reveal a narrow
 passage through rock and soil.

>go down
 She dives down.

 Caves (Where Bubbles Rise)
 There is air above in this larger cave and just a hint of light
 somewhere ahead.
 The cave curves gently to the left and continues northwest towards the
 light while south takes her back to the Junction.

 A stream of bubbles rises from the pitch-black bottom, meets the girl
 on its way up, and then explode in a glittering cascade of air around
 her.

>follow bubbles
 She kicks her feet until her speed is the same as the rising bubbles.
 In the company of the glittering bubbles she reaches the surface.

>go down
 That is not the way.  She can go south, northwest, southwest or up.

>go south

 Caves (Choosing the Path)
 The main flow seems to continue north, while two smaller tunnels lead
 northwest and west. East takes her back near the opening.

>go west

 Caves (In the Restless Waters)
 A strong current grabs her. She is flipped around, thrown like a
 puppy's toy. The water tries to drag her down to the bottom. She is
 immediately confused and swims towards the surface. Hard rock meets her
 outstretched hand in each direction. There is nothing but stone.

>exits
  There seems to be no other way but down.

>go down

 Caves (In the Gathering of Dead)
 The water is colder. The pressure in her ears is starting to get
 painful but now she can see it. The bottom is littered with bones,
 skulls and rib cages of all sizes that lie in droves on the sand. Pale
 bony hands wave at her in the unexplainable current. Grinning skulls
 mock her and whisper.
 "Come! Rest here with us!"
 There is a subtle movement near one wall. The bones twitch and move
 slightly as if pulled by a current.
 Her lungs are starting to ache. She will have to go to the surface
 soon!

>search bones
 (the bones)
 Lornedei looks terrified, but she moves closer to the layer of bones
 covering the bottom.
 Suddenly, Lornedei is grabbed by a current stronger than she can
 handle.

 She is dragged and pulled through the water, through a narrow opening
 in the cliff, up through a narrow well, and through wet cold darkness.
 She breaks the surface, spitting water, choking in her greedy quest for
 air.

 Inside an Old Stone Well (In Gurgling Water)
 The dark water swirls and gurgles in this small well. The crumbling
 edge of the stone cylinder is perhaps an arms length higher than the
 surface.
 Dim rays of light find their way down to the dark water, but help
 little to chase away the shadows.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>exits
  She can go up.

>go up
 She grabs the slippery stones and climbs out of the old well, wet and
 exhausted. She sits down on the ground, leaning against the cold
 stones.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.

 The nightmare is here, spinning slowly. The frayed edges are constantly
 releasing veils of broken smoke that dissolves in the air.

 The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.
 The deformed bushes rustle and seem to reach for her.

>dig hole
 The ground is too hard to dig in this place.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.
 The beetle squirms its way out of Lornedei's grasp and drops to the
 ground. It runs off, climbs up on the stone well, climbs back down,
 crawls through the bushes and seems to inspect the stone house, to
 finally stop at one of the paths.

>go up

 Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak)
 Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper
 branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She
 can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is
 nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing
 and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can
 climb down to the ground or follow the branch.

>exits
  She can go down to the ground or try the branch.

>go west
 If she moves around too much she will fall and break her neck. She can
 go down to the ground or try to follow the branch.

>follow branch
 Lornedei follows the branch. She steps through the smoke and enters the
 Hall of Mirrors.

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Portals)
 This square chamber is dominated by four portals. Each has a small
 impression to place one of the plaques. Lornedei came in from the
 northwest. If all portals are open, she can also go south, east, west
 or north.

 On the portal to the void is a small gray plaque.

 On the portal to the Hall of Severance is a small black plaque.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.


>put stone pile in void
 She needs to be holding the pile of steel and stone before she can put
 it into something else.

>take stone pile
 that is way too heavy to move around.

>dig hole
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the south frame, the north frame, the
 east frame or the west frame?

>reach north frame
 "Something is not right. Something is missing."

>reach west frame
 "I cannot reach into this one Master. I am not sure what is stopping
 me. Perhaps it needs to be whole."

>examine staff
 It's a heavy staff in what appears to be oak. It reaches Lornedei to
 the shoulder, is thicker in one end and irregular in shape, with the
 natural shape preserved. It is polished and given a patina with many
 years use.

>reach staff
 "No need for that Master. I have heard about things like this. I
 believe that this staff once had much power but it is now useless. A
 staff like this focuses the owner's powers only and this ones owner is
 obviously quite dead."

>go northwest

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

 She can see an old torch here.

>go up

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.
 The column of black smoke rushes towards the opening, jerks through it.
 It struggles to stay, twitching.

>examine opening
 The stone staircase spirals down into the dark. The steps are worn and
 cracked. A layer of sand and dust covers each step. No one has walked
 here for many years.
 The nightmare twitches, stirring up dust.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>go south

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 Deini is here.
 The hovering sleepwalker shows up at the edge of the forest. It picks
 up speed over the dry land, swirls up sand and dust and stays next to
 Lornedei.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>dig hole
 The ground is too hard to dig in this place.

>go west
 A few paces away, the courtyard ends abruptly as the ground is replaced
 by the ravine. A vertical cliff of bare rock is all that is left. If
 there was a western wall there, it now lies at the bottom of the
 ravine, along with a big part of the castle. On the other side, the
 forbidden forest starts again. Lornedei quickly backs away from the
 edge.

>dig hole
 The ground is too hard to dig in this place.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.
 "What should I do?"

>dig hole
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>dig
 (the sleep walker)
 Lornedei digs a hole in the dry ground.

>put nut in hole
 She needs to be holding the purple nut with thorns before she can put
 it into something else.
 "Master?"

>take nut
 Lornedei carefully takes the nut, holding it with two fingers by one of
 the thorns. That way she won't get hurt.

>put nut in hole
 "No Master. I will not plant that thing. It is wrong."
 "Master?"

>go southwest

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.

>go west

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Ravine)
 Lornedei stands on an outcropping overlooking a deep ravine going as
 far north as she can see. The ledge seems to be the remains of a road,
 cut off by the creation of the break in the earth. On the other side of
 the ravine, there's a barely visible opening through the trees. There
 is no way over there though. A steady wind tears at her clothes and
 hair in sudden gusts that seem eager to throw her off balance.

 East, northeast and north are the ways off the ledge.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>go northeast

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and

 Deini is here.
 The wolf tires of Lornedei and pretends to sleep for a bit.

>enter nightmare
 "Master? Are you sure about this?"
 She looks terrified but she decides to trust your judgment. She walks
 into the spinning smoke.
 the nightmare stops spinning and Lornedei appears on the other side.
 She looks at you with gray eyes and an uncanny smile on her lips.

>go east

 She can see a small hole in the hard ground (which is empty) here.

>put nut in hole
 "Lornedei stares at the nut.
 "No! It is not ready. It needs something else. It needs blood to grow.
 That is what he said."

>cut me
 That makes very little sense. Perhaps you should think that one
 through.

>take red worm
 If you insist.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>kill it
 Lornedei mumbles.
 "With time. The end is coming and they will all die."
 Lornedei's shadow trembles and disappears. In an instant, it is back.
 She seems not to notice.

>stab it
 "What was that you said?"

>bite the red worm
 Lornedei mumbles.
 "With time. The end is coming and they will all die."

>inventory

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 165.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   a shiny red worm
   a purple nut with thorns
   a wizard's staff
   a cracked skull
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a small leather pouch (which is open)
     a golden acorn
   a skinny yellow worm
   a bone
   a small dented silver plate
   a small water sack (which is closed)
     the water from the Elder's spring
   an old tarnished bronze urn
     a fat blue worm
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a handful of white berries
     a loaf of horrid bread
     a piece of cheese

>stab red worm with nut
 "What was that you said?"

>stab red worm with thorn
 "What was that you said?"

>examine bone
 As far as Lornedei can gather, it's a bone from a dear's leg. It has
 plenty of bite marks on it so this might have been one of Deini's
 unfortunate preys.
 Lornedei's shadow tears one shadow-leg from Lornedei's real one, then
 the other. It fades as it rises. Once upright, it melts into Lornedei.
 She shivers.

>prick red worm
 "What was that you said?"

>cut red worm
 Lornedei will not cut any animals up today.

>cut ld
 That makes very little sense. Perhaps you should think that one
 through.

>cut me
 That makes very little sense. Perhaps you should think that one
 through.

>She's distractable and sleepwalky.
 "What was that you said?"

>exorcise ld
 Lornedei is possessed. Would you like to perform an exorcism on her?

>yes
 You give it your best shot, chanting and carrying on.
 "Master?" Lornedei is extremely pale but she seems well.
 The exorcism succeeded.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.

>enter sleepwalker
 "Master?" She glances up at you, frowning, but she walks into the
 spinning mist.
 The sleepwalker stops spinning and Lornedei appears on the other side,
 apparently not sure where she is or why.

 Lornedei moves to pet the wolf but halfway there, she seems to forget
 what she was about to do.

>go west
 A few paces away, the courtyard ends abruptly as the ground is replaced
 by the ravine. A vertical cliff of bare rock is all that is left. If
 there was a western wall there, it now lies at the bottom of the

 Deini gets in front of Lornedei but the girl just gives her a

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go north
 Lornedei walks towards the dim light. The corridor ends, the floor
 drops away, and beyond is the mist. The edge of the cliff itself has
 dropped off, taking the entire inner castle down with it. The entire
 northwest corner of the big ledge has slid down to the bottom of the
 ravine.

 Lornedei takes a quick look down the ravine, through veils of mist, but
 the floor suddenly feels very unsteady under her feet. She returns to
 the opening to the staircase.

>go down

 Lornedei steps closer to the huge hole in the wall. One glimpse down is
 enough. She steps back on unsteady legs.

 Lornedei is sleepwalking. She is having trouble following orders as
 well as using her magic. She can only perform the simplest things at
 the moment. Her ignorance can be a protection from evil. It can also be
 abused.

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Portals)
 This square chamber is dominated by four portals. Each has a small

 northwest. If all portals are open, she can also go south, east, west
 or north.

 On the portal to the void is a small gray plaque.

 On the portal to the Hall of Severance is a small black plaque.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.

 Lornedei gives the pile of bones a sad look.
 "Is he dead?"

>yes
 There is no need to answer her. Better to keep your peace.

 Lornedei gives the pile of bones a sad look.
 "Is he dead?"

>search elder
 Lornedei is less than interested in digging around in old dead peoples
 remains.

>rest
 "Huh?"

>wake ld
 You decide to break the rules just slightly. You give her a tiny nudge.
 A mental slap if you will. Her head snaps up and she is staring at you,
 shocked.

 Her eyes are bright and aware. She smiles.
 "I was not quite here Master. I am sorry. I am awake now."

>go northwest

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

 She can see an old torch here.
 The sleepwalker hovers past.
 The whirlwind of black smoke twitches past the opening in the wall.
 Then it turns back, rushes, and enters the guard chamber. It twitches,
 hovering over the rubble, casting out broken smoke that escapes through
 the opening.

>se

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Portals)
 This square chamber is dominated by four portals. Each has a small
 impression to place one of the plaques. Lornedei came in from the
 northwest. If all portals are open, she can also go south, east, west
 or north.

 On the portal to the void is a small gray plaque.

 On the portal to the Hall of Severance is a small black plaque.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.


>go east
 Lornedei steps through the mirror.

 Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak)
 Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper
 branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She
 can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is
 nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing
 and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can
 climb down to the ground or follow the branch.

>go down
 Lornedei climbs down.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.

 She can also see a large black beetle (Airing out its shell at the
 moment.) here.
 The sleepwalker comes charging out of the forest in a hurry. It stops
 next to Lornedei, disposing of sand, leaves and sticks, dead grass and
 not just a little dry soil.

>go down
 Lornedei drops down into the opening between the roots of the black
 oak. She tumbles down into cool dark water.

 Caves (Among the Restless Roots)
 The space she is in is not more then twice Lornedei's length in any
 direction. The tangle of roots makes the space seem smaller yet. The
 pale mass of roots stirs restlessly. Below her, the inky water of the
 river flows past.

 The roots on the south wall have slid apart enough to reveal a narrow
 passage through rock and soil.
 SPLASH!

>go down
 She dives down.

 Caves (Where Bubbles Rise)
 There is air above in this larger cave and just a hint of light
 somewhere ahead.
 The cave curves gently to the left and continues northwest towards the
 light while south takes her back to the Junction.

 A stream of bubbles rises from the pitch-black bottom, meets the girl
 on its way up, and then explode in a glittering cascade of air around
 her.

>go south

 Caves (Choosing the Path)
 The main flow seems to continue north, while two smaller tunnels lead
 northwest and west. East takes her back near the opening.

>go east

 Caves (Entering the Caves)
 Darkness is chased away by only a few illusive reflections in the
 stone, thanks to the little light leaking in from the opening. The
 tunnel continues west into total darkness and Southeast takes her out
 of the cave.

>se

 River Bottom (At the Cave Entrance)
 The bottom is littered with rocks. There are piles of them of varying
 sizes, washed clean by the constant flow of water. Around the sides of
 the opening into the cave, a few colonies of a slimy and sickly green
 plant have managed to make a home. They sway back and forth in the
 current while clinging desperately to the rocks. The opening leads
 northwest into a cave and south takes her back around the river bend.

>go up

 In the River (By the Cliff)
 The river makes a slight turn, hiding the road from view. A vertical
 cliff stops her from going any further north in this tunnel of water,
 trees, and shadows. Above her head is a frayed ribbon of blue sky and
 at the top of the cliff, the two forests meet. Below and around her
 there is that play of light and dark, maybe just a little bit darker.
 South takes her back around the bend. Looking down she can see an
 opening in the cliff.
 A dry black leaf drops from the forbidden forest into the water right
 in front of Lornedei. It bobs up and down a couple of times before it
 floats away downstream.

>go south

 In the River (Between the Forests)
 The forbidden forest is to the west and the old forest to the east. The
 river flows back south and down takes her to the bottom of the river.
 To the north the river disappears out of sight around a bend, and there
 is a slight opening in the trees to the east.
 A dry black leaf drops down on Lornedei's shoulder. With a grimace, she
 flicks it with a finger to get rid of it.

>go south

 In the River (By the Road)
 The river runs from north to south. Ahead of her, the glittering water
 becomes shaded by the two forests. The forbidden forest on the left and
 the still green old forest on the right. The river disappears out of
 sight perhaps a hundred paces into the tunnel of trees, water, and
 shadows. The dusty road is east, where she can get out of the water.
 She can also dive down to the bottom of the river.

>go east
 Lornedei drags herself up on the east riverbank. She stops a moment to
 rest before stepping up on the dusty road.

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)
 This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
 forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
 Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
 the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.

 Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by
 grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east.
 Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare
 to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast
 is a pile of stones. The stones are barely visible above the grass.

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 The deformed bushes seem to reach for Lornedei as she walks by.

>go east

 Aarkland (Billowing Field)
 The grass grows waist high. Touched by sun, wind, and rain, it
 patiently waits for the farmers that will not come. The edge of the old
 forest lies close by to the north. To the south, a big pile of stones
 rises above the grass. The road is back west.

>dig
 What do you want Lornedei to dig?

>hole
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>dig ground
 (the ground)
 The ground is too hard to dig in this place.

>go south

 Aarkland (On the Unholy Stones)
 The collection of stones is over ten paces from edge to edge. The top
 has been flattened to create a platform and that is where Lornedei
 stands. No new stones have been added in several hundred years. Despite
 the lack of activity, nothing grows near the stones.

 There are powers here that make it easier for her to use her magic. You
 can make her see what hides around her. She will see the world as it
 is, what hides beyond what the eye can see.

 She can go north to the field or northwest back to the dusty road.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

>search stones
 There is nothing on the unholy stones.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>reach stones
 Lornedei reaches down in the ground by her feet. She shuts her eyes and
 lets her mind touch the stones one by one. One lost name after another
 flies through her mind like a swarm of insane and vicious insects.
 Hundreds, thousands of names of men, women and children. Each one has a
 history, a life led in pain or ignorance, but they all share the same
 pain. The same longing, the same sorrow, the same terrible fate.
 Crying, she drops to her knees.
 "These people were all severed. Their names were stolen, ripped away
 from their souls. They did not all deserve this fate, I am sure. These
 names belong to the spirits Master, but they can never be whole again.
 Never!" Lornedei takes a deep breath and gets back up on her feet.

 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>reach urn
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>wave bone
 Lornedei frowns. She is not quite sure what it is that you wish her to
 do.

>reach bone
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.

>break bone
 She gives you a quick glance but shakes her head.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>smash yellow worm with bone
 All I understood was a wish to smash the skinny yellow worm.

>hit yellow worm with bone
 All I understood was a wish to hit the skinny yellow worm.

>heal bone
 She cannot heal things that are not alive.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>grasp bone
 "Master? I don't understand."

>go northwest

 Aarkland (End of Village Road)
 This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
 forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
 Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
 the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.

 sight perhaps a hundred paces into the tunnel of trees, water, and
 shadows. The dusty road is east, where she can get out of the water.
 She can also dive down to the bottom of the river.
 Lornedei slowly turns around in the water. She looks down through the
 surface, then up at the trees. She mutters under her breath.

>go north

 In the River (Between the Forests)
 The forbidden forest is to the west and the old forest to the east. The
 river flows back south and down takes her to the bottom of the river.
 To the north the river disappears out of sight around a bend, and there
 is a slight opening in the trees to the east.

 Darkness is chased away by only a few illusive reflections in the

>go west

 Caves (Choosing the Path)
 The main flow seems to continue north, while two smaller tunnels lead

 What makes you think that she wants to be nearly drowned in there
 again? Especially as the passage under the giant black oak is open.

>look

 Caves (Choosing the Path)
 The main flow seems to continue north, while two smaller tunnels lead

 Her lungs are starting to ache. She will have to go to the surface
 soon!

>go north

 Caves (Where Bubbles Rise)
 There is air above in this larger cave and just a hint of light

 The cave curves gently to the left and continues northwest towards the

 The space she is in is not more then twice Lornedei's length in any

 pale mass of roots stirs restlessly. Below her, the inky water of the
 river flows past.

 The roots on the south wall have slid apart enough to reveal a narrow
 passage through rock and soil.

>go up
 She'll have to get out of the river at one of the riverbanks. Type
 "exits" to find a way.
 Something pulls Lornedei's hair and she shrieks. Less a few strands of
 hair, she turns around in the water. A thin root slithers away to
 disappear among the others.

>exits
  She can go down or south.

>go south
 After squeezing herself through the tight passage she is not just
 dripping wet but also filthy and out of breath.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.

 The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly.

 She can also see a large black beetle (Fluffing up its wings at the
 moment.) here.
 The wandering nightmare crashes out from the black forest. It swirls up
 dust and dry grass on its erratic route through the dead grass. It
 twitches past the altar and stops near the black oak.
 The beetle disappears into the crumbling stone house. It comes back
 out, stays a moment in the opening, waving its antennae, before coming
 back to Lornedei.

>take left path
 Lornedei takes a couple of steps towards the dark trail, glancing
 nervously up at the trees. Then she takes a deep breath before moving
 forward. The shadows of the forbidden forest fall on her.
 She walks without sun as guidance or aim to where she is going.
 The path twists and turns and soon she is cursing her own
 thoughtlessness. The prickling sensation of a forgotten spirit's hatred
 sinks down on her like a heavy blanket.
 Her feet feel strangely heavy and clumsy, as if the undergrowth hinders
 her movement. However there is nothing growing on the path. It is
 empty. Flat and hard-packed, it should be easy to walk on.
 A somewhat stronger light appears further ahead and with a soft sob of
 relief Lornedei starts running towards the clearing.
 She stops with the beginning of a smile freezing on her lips.
 The clearing is dark, a stone well gurgles softly, and three paths
 disappear into the forbidden forest.
 A dry black leaf drops down on Lornedei's shoulder. With a grimace, she
 flicks it with a finger to get rid of it.

>h ld
 Lornedei looks fine. She is as healthy as she will ever be.

>take straight path

 The beetle runs off to one of the paths. It spins around once before
 returning to Lornedei.

>go west
 Hesitantly she takes a few steps forward, but she has no idea in what
 directions the paths lead. Uncertain, she looks up at you.

>go east
 Hesitantly she takes a few steps forward, but she has no idea in what
 directions the paths lead. Uncertain, she looks up at you.
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

>examine well
 It is an old, neglected well made of stones. It's nearly invisible
 among the long dry grass dying bushes that surround it.
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.
 Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.
 And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest. It sounds like a
 bird, unlike any other.

>examine grass
 The brush is dry, withered, gnarled, deformed, starved. In the midst of
 that, razor-like blades of grass poke up. Their tips are shaped like
 scalpels, their stems straight and silvery gray.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

>search grass
 She reaches for one of the dry tufts of dead grass. She quickly pulls
 her hand back.
 "Ouch!"
 The grass is razor-sharp and she is better off keeping her hands away
 from it.

>take grass
 She reaches for one of the dry tufts of dead grass. She quickly pulls
 her hand back.
 "Ouch!"
 The grass is razor-sharp and she is better off keeping her hands away

 Lornedei bites on a nail.

 The beetle scrambles through the dead grass to one of the paths. It
 spins around and comes back to Lornedei.

 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden

 The nightmare is here, spinning slowly. The frayed edges are constantly
 releasing veils of broken smoke that dissolves in the air.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.

 The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly.

 She can also see a large black beetle (Spinning around waving its
 antennae at the moment.) here.

>reach sleepwalker
 Lornedei focuses on the spinning mist but suddenly she seems weary and
 confused.
 "It is strange Master. If I try to feel what is inside it, I feel like
 I am going to fall asleep."
 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>reach altar
 She lifts her hands towards the stained altar. She focuses, frowning,
 then she is shoved back by something. The connection breaks and
 Lornedei gasps for air.
 "No Master, I cannot! There is so much wickedness there and it does not
 want to reveal its secrets. All I could sense was pain. Pain, fear, and
 blood."
 Lornedei's magic just dropped by five.
 A dry black leaf drops down on Lornedei's shoulder. With a grimace, she
 flicks it with a finger to get rid of it.

>cut ld
 That makes very little sense. Perhaps you should think that one
 through.
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.
 Lornedei stares at the leaf clusters in the black forest. She looks
 away, biting her lower lip.

>enter sleepwalker
 "Master?" She glances up at you, frowning, but she walks into the
 spinning mist.
 The sleepwalker stops spinning and Lornedei appears on the other side,
 apparently not sure where she is or why.

>search grass
 Lornedei is staring at the black oak.

>take grass
 Lornedei is staring at the black oak.

>search grass
 Lornedei is staring at the black oak.
 Something touches Lornedei's foot. She pulls her leg away from the

 grasping root with a shriek.

>wake ld

 shocked.

 Her eyes are bright and aware. She smiles.
 "I was not quite here Master. I am sorry. I am awake now."
 The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.

>enter nightmare
 "Master? Are you sure about this?"
 She looks terrified but she decides to trust your judgment. She walks
 into the spinning smoke.
 the nightmare stops spinning and Lornedei appears on the other side.
 She looks at you with gray eyes and an uncanny smile on her lips.
 Lornedei shivers. She looks behind her. There is nothing there.
 Lornedei turns her head slowly from side to side, dazed. She blinks.

>search grass
 The thin strands of grass are sharp enough to cut her hand to pieces,
 but she shoves her hand in the middle of one of the tufts of grass.
 she pulls it out of the ground and throws it into the gurgling stone
 well. In doing that, a rusty something is revealed. It looks like an
 old sword.
 Lornedei's hand is undamaged.

>examine sword
 It might have been a mighty sword in a brave warriors hand at one
 point. There is now a fingers length left of the blade and the thing
 looks more like a clump of rust.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>take sword
 If you insist.

>reach sword
 There seems to be nothing beyond what the eye can see.
 The beetle stands still, seemingly watching the deformed bushes.

>cut me
 That makes very little sense. Perhaps you should think that one
 through.
 Lornedei reaches down to scratch her ankle.
 Lornedei stares at the leaf clusters in the black forest. She looks
 away, biting her lower lip.

>touch sword
 What she feels she will not tell.

>search grass
 "There is nothing more to find there."
 Something touches Lornedei's foot. She pulls her leg away from the
 grasping root with a shriek.

>go up

 Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak)
 Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper
 branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She
 can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is
 nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing
 and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can
 climb down to the ground or follow the branch.

>follow branch
 Lornedei steps through the smoke.
 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Portals)
 This square chamber is dominated by four portals. Each has a small
 impression to place one of the plaques. Lornedei came in from the
 northwest. If all portals are open, she can also go south, east, west
 or north.

 On the portal to the void is a small gray plaque.

 On the portal to the Hall of Severance is a small black plaque.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.


>go northwest

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

 She can see an old torch here.

>go up

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.
 Lornedei stumbles for no apparent reason. She looks up at you,
 accusingly.

>go south

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 Deini is here.
 The girl looks at the wolf as if seeing it for the first time. Deini
 backs away from her.

>kill deini
 Lornedei just looks at you. Her blank stare reveals none of her
 thoughts.

>throw sword at deini
 Lornedei's aim is awful. The rusty sword grip is so far off the
 intended target it is not even funny.

>undo
 Castle Courtyard
 Let it be so!

>kill deini with sword
 All I understood was a wish to kill Deini.

>kill deini with staff
 All I understood was a wish to kill Deini.

>zap deini
 Lornedei just looks at you. Her blank stare reveals none of her
 thoughts.
 Lornedei's shadow trembles and disappears. In an instant, it is back.
 She seems not to notice.
 Deini comes up to Lornedei to be scratched.
 "Deini NO!" Lornedei waves the wolf away.

>go northeast
 There is a mountain of rubble in the way. There is a couple of passages
 through the precariously stacked pile, but it is far to risky to send
 Lornedei in there.
 Deini comes up to Lornedei to be scratched.
 "Deini NO!" Lornedei waves the wolf away.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.

 She can see a small hole in the hard ground (which is empty) here.
 Lornedei's shadow stretches out behind her. It sits up. It reaches. It
 touches the exposed skin on her neck before lying back down. Lornedei
 scratches her neck furiously.

>whistle
 Lornedei whistles.

>wait
 Lornedei waits as the dry wind tears at her torn clothing.
 Lornedei wipes her forehead with her shirtsleeve.

>wait
 Lornedei waits as the dry wind tears at her torn clothing.

>wait
 Lornedei waits as the dry wind tears at her torn clothing.
 Lornedei feels something against her leg. Like a shadow, silent and
 cautious, Deini has come to her. The wolf is sniffing the air, is
 constantly watching Lornedei, but she finally lies down. She puts her
 head on her front paws but keeps constant watch.
 "You just stay out of my way."
 Deini stares at the small hole in the ground, then at Lornedei. She
 growls.

>kill deini
 Lornedei just looks at you. Her blank stare reveals none of her
 thoughts.
 Deini looks at the hole in the ground and walks over to it. She lies
 down and rolls around on top of it, effectively filling it with dirt.

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Mirrors)
 This chamber is over ten paces across and perfectly square. A large

>examine crystal
 It's a pale blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.

>put crystal in west indentation
 No, the amulet will not fit in that hole.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>examine plate
 It is a somewhat dented silver dish. One side returns a distorted but
 clear image of the holder.

 ear.

 There is no need for her to do that.

 Lornedei needs to know which one, the south frame, the north frame, the
 east frame or the west frame?

 All I understood was a wish to examine the northwest.

>go northwest

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

 She can see an old torch here.

>go up

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.

>go south

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 Deini is here.
 The hovering sleepwalker shows up at the edge of the forest. It picks
 up speed over the dry land, swirls up sand and dust and stays next to
 Lornedei.
 A black smoke is rising from the forbidden forest. It hovers over the
 treetops and is barely distinguishable from the constant mist. It moves
 closer and starts spinning. It drops down to the ground at the edge of
 the forest and forms a ragged column of black smoke. It swirls up sand
 and dust at touchdown. It picks up speed across the flat ground and
 stops close to Lornedei. It is turning slowly while releasing strands
 of broken smoke that dissolves in the air.
 "The nightmare. The maker of bad dreams. I thought that they were only
 stories."
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>heal nightmare
 She cannot heal things that are not alive.

>heal sleepwalker
 She cannot heal things that are not alive.
 Deini yawns, utterly bored.

>go northwest
 The front wall of the castle ends there in a jagged edge. The rest of
 it is at the bottom of the ravine. There is no way of knowing how big
 the castle might have been before. Lornedei takes a quick look over the
 edge of the ravine. It is too far down to see anything clearly and she
 retreats.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.
 The sleepwalker stalks the courtyard.
 The column of black smoke rushes towards the opening, jerks through it.
 It struggles to stay, twitching.

>go west
 Lornedei takes one step but stops. She cannot go there.  She can go
 south or down.
 The sleepwalker stalks the courtyard.
 The nightmare twitches, stirring up dust.

>push nightmare
 It is not possible to do that with the nightmare.
 The sleepwalker stalks the courtyard.
 The nightmare twitches, stirring up dust.

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Mirrors)
 This chamber is over ten paces across and perfectly square. A large
 oval mirror dominates each wall. Four mirrors. North, west, south and
 east.

 Lornedei came in from the northwest. An old burned out torch sits askew
 on the south wall.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.

 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>put black plaque in east indentation
 Lornedei puts the small black plaque in the round hole on the frame. It
 goes into place with a click.

>put gray plaque in north indentation
 Lornedei puts the small gray plaque in the round hole on the frame. It
 goes into place with a click.
 Lornedei bites on a nail.

>touch north frame
 What she feels she will not tell.

>go north
 A wide and heavy frame surrounds a dark mirror. There is only a dull
 reflection of the chamber behind Lornedei when she looks in it.
 The green plaque is in place on the frame.

>touch north mirror
 "the frame feels warm."
 "Master?"

>examine green plaque
 It is a small round plaque made of a green smooth stone. It is small
 enough to fit in Lornedei's hand and has a delicate carving on one
 side. The picture shows a woman's head and shoulders in profile. A
 giant oak is in the background. The woman is wearing a leather helmet
 on top of her braided hair and she is holding a long spear.

>examine gray plaque
 It is a small round plaque in a material unknown to Lornedei. The
 surface is smooth and with a deep polish. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's hand. The surface shows nothing, not even the distorted
 image of Lornedei herself that one might expect. What shows in the
 plaque is like a reflection of a stormy sky in a puddle of murky water,
 just before the rain starts hammering.

>examine black plaque
 It's a totally black round plaque. It is small enough to fit in
 Lornedei's palm. The smooth stone is of a kind that Lornedei has never
 seen. A strange picture is carved on one side. It looks like a flying
 insect of some sort, with a giant tree in the background.

 Lornedei examines the mirror, looks behind it, and taps the dark glass
 where nothing is reflected but darkness. Finally, she shakes her head.

>take green plaque
 "I cannot seem to take the plaque again. Perhaps it is exactly where it
 is supposed to be now."
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.

 The glass, underneath a layer of dust, has no reflection whatsoever.
 Lornedei glances at the frame but she just shakes her head in
 puzzlement. She looks away from the strange sight.
 A small black plaque is placed on the frame.

>examine north indentation
 There is an indentation in the top part of the frame. A plaque might
 fit there.

 Under a layer of dust covering the frame, the wood is decorated with
 delicately painted vines and leaves of all sizes and shapes. Tiny
 animals peek out from behind the leaves, which seem to stand out even
 though the surface is flat: a red squirrel's curious gaze, a deer and
 its offspring, ready to flee, a miniature snake on a vine.


>take black plaque
 "Ouch, I broke a nail! the plaque is stuck. At least I do not know how
 to get it out again. Maybe it is the way it is supposed to be."

 Hall of Elevation (In the Giant Oak)
 The shadow of the big oak trembles on the ground below. The far end of
 the branch Lornedei is sitting on seems to disappear in a gray mist.
 The other two branches on this level are just as unreachable for her as
 the limbs higher up.

 In the trunk in front of her, three holes are lined up in a tidy row.
 They are apparently inhabited by some kind of worm. She can climb down
 or go north along the branch.

 "Greetings Almighty! Allow me to tell you about your world,
 Aarkland."

 Our story begins here.

 The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from
 early morning until all that must be done is done. The summer has been
 good and this winter no one will starve. That is what the villagers
 believe, anyway. In ignorance they have turned from you and cannot see
 the coming darkness. For them Ignorance is bliss, but refusing to see
 the truth is no protection against evil.

 The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You
 watch her treading along the road and when she stops next to the
 water, you once more feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in
 more than a hundred years that has been born with the old power. The
 youngest daughter to Lorne and Noki, this innocent girl searches the
 sky for your presence. She smiles when she senses it and gives you a
 little wave. She is the last one. The last hope.

 Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance
 back along the road, and makes sure her sandals are fastened properly.
 Surely she can sense you watching her, but she says nothing. She
 reaches into her rucksack and brings out some bread. She nibbles on it
 without much enthusiasm while watching the flowing river, and she
 waits for you.

 The girl has the power to "reach" beyond what the eye can see and
 "heal" what is broken, but she is not strong enough to make a
 difference. Not without guidance. That is where you come in. As the
 God of this land, you must guide her. First, you should send her to
 the unholy stones to see what the world around her is hiding.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aarkland (End of Village Road)</span>
 This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
 forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
 Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
 the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.

 Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by
 grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east.
 Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare
 to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast
 is a pile of stones. The stones are barely visible above the grass.

 The Aarkland river flows past as always.

 A whiff of the deformed bushes reaches Lornedei's nose and she waves
 the unpleasant odor away.

>search bones
 (the long dead wizard)
 Lornedei carefully searches the bones on the floor. After gingerly
 lifting the wide sleeve covering one arm, she stops and looks up at
 you.
 "I found something Master. It is a green plaque."

>examine west
 (the west mirror (broken))
 The glass is cracked and dark. The frame surrounding the broken mirror
 seems to be in bad shape. There appears to be a shallow indentation in
 the top part of the frame. She may need to look closer at the frame.

>examine west frame
 The wide frame seems at first to be a mosaic of different types of
 frayed fabric. Upon closer inspection, it is clear that the frame is
 made up of different types of wood, stone, and even metal. It has
 however been demolished by something, cut and beaten into a mess of
 splinters. There seems to be an indentation in the top part of the
 frame but it may not be able to hold anything in place.

>heal west frame
 She cannot heal things that are not alive.

>heal west mirror
 Lornedei lifts her hand to the mirror, wondering if it is possible to
 heal. She gathers her powers and lets a thin blue streak of light touch
 the glass fragments. A sudden rumble makes her turn around, loosing the
 connection with the magic. The statue slides back over the opening in
 the wall. The sound of it drowns in a loud grinding noise. Steel
 against steel. The sound turns into a scream, a guttural growl.
 Lornedei staggers backwards as the floor shakes.
 The big pile of steel and stone stands before Lornedei with every
 seemingly random part now in its right place. The creature is almost
 twice as tall as the girl, and it stares down at her from within a
 diffuse darkness that surrounds it. This darkness is the force keeping
 all of its parts together and enabling the heavy body to move.

 An enormous head sits directly on a giant shoulder, and the jaw of
 rusty metal opens and closes constantly with a creaking and a clank
 that echoes in the chamber.
 The enormous body of stone shifts constantly, as if restless. The sound
 of stone grinding against stone, steel against stone and steel against
 steel is terribly loud.

 A crimson glow pulsates deep in a horizontal crack in the head.
 Puffs of dust fly out of the many joints between the rocks. Tufts of
 mold, moss, and shards of stone are raining down on the marble floor.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.
 Clouds of dust swirl up around stomping stone feet.

>reach south mirror
 "No Master, there is something not right. It feels like I should be
 able to but something is missing."
 A crimson light dances on the white walls of the chamber, metal jaws
 snap and stone limbs creak.

>put gray in south
 (the small gray plaque in the south mirror)
 Lornedei puts the small gray plaque in the round hole on the frame. It
 goes into place with a click.
 Clouds of dust swirl up around stomping stone feet.

>reach south mirror
 The matted surface of the glass suddenly flares up in a cascade of
 crimson sparks. A shower of hot air and red light throws Lornedei back.
 It throws her on the floor, and she desperately claps at her shirt to
 kill the tiny flames. She drags herself back across the dusty floor.

 The moment passes, the sparks fade and die. Lornedei gets up on her
 feet, staring at a wavy, unsettling darkness. There is nothing at all
 beyond the polished frame.

 The portal to the Eternal Void is open.
 "What should I do?"
 Lornedei barely escapes a swinging stone arm. The chamber shakes when
 the arm hits the wall.

>heal west
 (the west mirror (broken))
 Lornedei yells: "There is no time for that now!"
 "What should I do?"
 A loud scream of frustration fills the chamber. Lornedei staggers, and
 a tendril of greasy smoke touches her forehead before she can get out
 of the way. The magic is slowly fading.

 Lornedei's magic just dropped by two.

>put green in west

 Lornedei stumbles backwards.

 The Elders water cannot be wasted that way. It is needed elsewhere.
 Raccdaha is staring into the polished surface, oblivious.

 She closes the small leather pouch.
 Raccdaha drops the silver plate on the floor and turns to Lornedei. He
 leans forward and reaches for her. She realizes that the time is up. He
 is furious now, not just annoyed with her.
 She sidesteps and ducks under his massive arm, and she nearly gets
 away. Unfortunately, he gets a hold of her hair. Using it as rope, he
 swings her around the chamber, throws her like a sack of potatoes, and
 hits her against the walls until the screaming stops.

>put black plaque in east indentatino
 Lornedei puts the small black plaque in the round hole on the frame. It
 goes into place with a click.
 A black tendril of darkness creeps toward Lornedei's head. It touches
 her mind, and she can feel her powers weaken.

 Lornedei's magic just dropped by 4.

>reach east mirror
 The darkness in the mirror changes into a swirling mist. The portal to
 the Hall of Severance is open.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>go east
 Lornedei steps through the mirror.

 Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak)
 Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper
 branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She
 can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is
 nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing
 and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can
 climb down to the ground or follow the branch.

>go down
 Lornedei climbs down.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.

 The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly.
 Black smoke seeps out of the darkness between the trees. The smoke
 gathers itself until a dark pillar of smoke is formed. In erratic,
 twitching moves, it comes closer.

 It stops next to the staring Lornedei. It starts to turn slowly,
 releasing veils of broken smoke from its ragged surface. They dissolve
 in the air and new ones form to take their place.
 "The maker of horrors at night. The roaming nightmare. I thought they
 were stories."

>enter nightmare
 "Master? Are you sure about this?"
 She looks terrified but she decides to trust your judgment. She walks
 into the spinning smoke.
 the nightmare stops spinning and Lornedei appears on the other side.
 She looks at you with gray eyes and an uncanny smile on her lips.
 There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around,
 mystified.
 "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly,
 the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a
 piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end,
 with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with
 Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly
 gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level.
 "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense
 buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it
 from falling.

 "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks
 the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in
 front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of
 straw.
 "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh,
 dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down
 on the ground to listen.

 "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always
 so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a
 long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the
 pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water,
 catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I
 heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He
 pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his
 parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one
 could tell, as he was still only a little boy.

 Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go
 with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was
 gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy
 ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten
 rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his
 home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the
 straw again.

 "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade
 honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers
 he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young.
 Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for
 himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's
 father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With
 magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very
 wrong."

 "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in
 desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love.
 She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than
 you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the
 magic spell to Raccdaha.

 The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body
 in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel
 punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House
 of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast
 forest.

 He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of
 them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he
 felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to
 the other forgotten souls that dwelled there.

 He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally
 felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he
 could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary
 body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing.
 Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He
 spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light
 bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of
 Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many
 years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me,
 cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place
 is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I
 don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest
 somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may
 be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting."

 The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end
 of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from
 Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck
 Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and
 vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a
 scent of burnt straw in the air.
 Lornedei is muttering to herself.
 Lornedei turns her head slowly from side to side, dazed. She blinks.

>follow branch
 Lornedei steps through the smoke.
 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Portals)
 This square chamber is dominated by four portals. Each has a small
 impression to place one of the plaques. Lornedei came in from the
 northwest. If all portals are open, she can also go south, east, west
 or north.

 Raccdaha stomps the floor, shifting its weight. It is getting ready to
 crush Lornedei.


 On the portal to the Hall of Severance is a small black plaque.


 She can also see a small green plaque here.

>give plate to raccdaha
 Lornedei holds up the silver plate with trembling hands. Raccdaha stops
 moving. He is quiet, absorbed by the reflection in the polished
 surface. He grabs the plate.
 His attention is far from Lornedei for a little while.
 Lornedei looks around, puzzled.
 Raccdaha is staring into the polished surface, oblivious.

>put gray plaque in south indentation
 Lornedei puts the small gray plaque in the round hole on the frame. It
 goes into place with a click.
 Raccdaha is staring into the polished surface, oblivious.

>reach south mirror
 The matted surface of the glass suddenly flares up in a cascade of
 crimson sparks. A shower of hot air and red light throws Lornedei back.
 It throws her on the floor, and she desperately claps at her shirt to
 kill the tiny flames. She drags herself back across the dusty floor.

 The moment passes, the sparks fade and die. Lornedei gets up on her
 feet, staring at a wavy, unsettling darkness. There is nothing at all
 beyond the polished frame.

 The portal to the Eternal Void is open.
 Raccdaha is staring into the polished surface, oblivious.

 Lornedei says calmly: "No!"

>kiss raccdaha
 Raccdaha snaps out of it and turns to her.
 Lornedei smiles her uncanny smile and looks calm, pleased. She holds up
 one hand and Raccdaha is still. She walks closer and puts a hand on one
 of the rocks, caressing it slowly.
 "Yes. You can live again. Let me come with you. Let's find a body for
 you."
 A strand of darkness twists itself around her hand, touching her
 fingers, moving over her entire body. Light as the draft from a
 butterfly's wing, yet leaving her skin scorched and bleeding.
 If she feels the burning, her face shows nothing of it.
 The spirit that was once human embraces her. He wraps his arms around
 her body, seeking warmth. He holds her with arms of stone. She melts
 into the darkness.

 Smiling, she lets herself be crushed between stones, cut to pieces by
 sharp metal. He reaches for her hand, which turns to a bloody mess. He
 holds her head, which cracks like a ripe melon. Only then does the
 smile fade from her lips.

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor

 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 Deini is here.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.
 There is a shadow stretching out on the ground behind Lornedei. It
 folds into inky black and then it rises, takes one step away from her,
 and is gone.

>go east

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.

>reach oak
 (the petrified tree)
 Lornedei puts her hand on the petrified wood. She shuts her eyes.
 Suddenly, the air is fresh with a scent of damp soil, grass and the new
 flowers of spring. Golden leaves tremble on silver limbs. Rooted deep
 in fertile soil, cared for, held in awe, the golden oak waits.

 Soft grass beneath bare feet, feet tredding silently towards the great
 oak, but stopping to wait at the proper distance. A mumble, a nervous
 questioning, a whispered reply. A moment of silence. A silver cup
 carried the last two steps to the roots below the tree.

 A trickle of water, a new light bearer's gift, then the acceptance of
 it, knowing the young one is true and strong. A golden acorn drops to
 the ground.

 Ages has passed, eons of repeated procedures, of dying and re-birth.
 The golden oak feels no fear, no regret, knowing that after this life,
 it will come again. The light bearers will plant the acorn and the
 spiral of life will turn once more. It is soon time. Very soon.
 Lornedei is waiting for your command.

 The hovering sleepwalker shows up at the edge of the forest. It picks

 Lornedei.
 A black smoke is rising from the forbidden forest. It hovers over the
 treetops and is barely distinguishable from the constant mist. It moves
 closer and starts spinning. It drops down to the ground at the edge of
 the forest and forms a ragged column of black smoke. It swirls up sand
 and dust at touchdown. It picks up speed across the flat ground and
 stops close to Lornedei. It is turning slowly while releasing strands
 of broken smoke that dissolves in the air.

 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A big round stone lies in the middle of the pit. The fire is gone.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.

 A high pitched squeal from somewhere among the blackened trees fills
 the air, and Lornedei shudders.

>go north

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.

>examine oak
 (the petrified tree)
 These are scattered remains of a tree. Mostly ashes, a few charred
 branches, a hollowed out trunk lying on its side, all petrified by time
 and lack of rain. All is covered in years of sand.

>look in oak
 (the petrified tree)
 Lornedei looks around, in the trunk, kicks away some dirt, but all she
 finds is more sad remains of the tree. Anything of interest is long
 since gone.
 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>search oak

 Lornedei looks around, in the trunk, kicks away some dirt, but all she

 There is nothing left here that can be healed. The tree is long since
 dead.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>examine sand
 The soil is dry and starved of both moisture and nutrition. It looks
 and feels dead.

>heal sand
 "There is nothing I can do for this soil."

>put spider on oak

 Placing things on the petrified tree will not do her any good.

>heal spider
 Healing drains too much power. That would be a waste.

 Lornedei digs a hole in the dry ground.

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 166.
 Lornedei is carrying:
   A crystal spider with shifty, beady eyes (Polishing its underside at
 the moment.)
   a wizard's staff
   a large black beetle (Taking a nap at the moment.)
   a small black plaque
   a cracked skull
   A blue crystal hanging on a silver chain.
   a small leather pouch (which is open)
     a golden acorn
   a skinny yellow worm
   a bone
   a small dented silver plate
   a small water sack (which is closed)
     the water from the Elder's spring
   an old tarnished bronze urn
     a shiny red worm
     a fat blue worm
   a small gray plaque
   a leather rucksack (being worn)
     a purple nut with thorns
     a handful of white berries
     a loaf of horrid bread
     a piece of cheese

>plant acorn
 "Master! Nothing can grow here." She picks up a handful of dirt but
 drops it again with a grimace.
 "This soil is poisoned, I can feel it."

>go southwest

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.

 Wasteland (By the Circle of Stones)
 This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden
 forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her
 out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces
 across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken
 land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight.

 A big round stone lies in the middle of the pit. The fire is gone.

 A stone circle is laid out on the ground.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.

 Lornedei digs a hole in the dry ground.

>put acorn in hole
 She needs to be holding the golden acorn before she can put it into
 something else.

>take acorn
 As you wish.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>put acorn in hole
 Lornedei puts the golden acorn in the small hole in the ground. After a
 moment, it starts to move around in there. It circles the inside of the
 hole and when reaching enough speed, the acorn makes it out of the hole
 completely. It rolls over to stop next to Lornedei's left foot.
 A high pitched squeal from somewhere among the blackened trees fills
 the air, and Lornedei shudders.

>open bag
 That's already open.

>pour water into hole

 The Elders water cannot be wasted that way. It is needed elsewhere.

 Wasteland (By the East Wall)
 The eastern wall of the ruined castle stands strong here. Fifty or so
 paces north, it fades into a wall of mist. East, south, southwest and
 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is
 dwelled in gray mist.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.

>go west

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 The nightmare is here, spinning slowly. The frayed edges are constantly
 releasing veils of broken smoke that dissolves in the air.

 Deini is here.

>go north

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.
 The sleepwalker stalks the courtyard.
 The column of black smoke rushes towards the opening, jerks through it.
 It struggles to stay, twitching.

>go down

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

 She can see an old torch here.
 The sleepwalker hovers past.

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Mirrors)
 This chamber is over ten paces across and perfectly square. A large
 oval mirror dominates each wall. Four mirrors. North, west, south and
 east.

 Lornedei came in from the northwest. An old burned out torch sits askew
 on the south wall.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.


>put black plaque in east indentation
 Lornedei puts the small black plaque in the round hole on the frame. It
 goes into place with a click.

>reach east mirror
 The darkness in the mirror changes into a swirling mist. The portal to
 the Hall of Severance is open.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>go east
 Lornedei steps through the mirror.

 Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak)
 Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper
 branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She
 can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is
 nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing
 and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can
 climb down to the ground or follow the branch.

>go down
 Lornedei climbs down.

 Hall of Severance
 The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
 It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
 A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
 Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
 suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
 up.

 A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
 are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
 in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.

 An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
 On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
 forest.

 The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
 passage.
 There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around,
 mystified.
 "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly,
 the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a
 piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end,
 with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with
 Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly
 gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level.
 "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense
 buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it
 from falling.

 "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks
 the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in
 front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of
 straw.
 "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh,
 dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down
 on the ground to listen.

 "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always
 so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a
 long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the
 pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water,
 catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I
 heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He
 pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his
 parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one
 could tell, as he was still only a little boy.

 Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go
 with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was
 gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy
 ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten
 rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his
 home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the
 straw again.

 "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade
 honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers
 he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young.
 Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for
 himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's
 father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With
 magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very
 wrong."

 "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in
 desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love.
 She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than
 you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the
 magic spell to Raccdaha.

 The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body
 in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel
 punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House
 of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast
 forest.

 He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of
 them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he
 felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to
 the other forgotten souls that dwelled there.

 He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally
 felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he
 could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary
 body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing.
 Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He
 spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light
 bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of
 Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many
 years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me,
 cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place
 is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I
 don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest
 somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may
 be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting."

 The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end
 of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from
 Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck
 Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and
 vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a
 scent of burnt straw in the air.
 The sleepwalker comes charging out of the forest in a hurry. It stops
 next to Lornedei, disposing of sand, leaves and sticks, dead grass and
 not just a little dry soil.
 The wandering nightmare crashes out from the black forest. It swirls up
 dust and dry grass on its erratic route through the dead grass. It
 twitches past the altar and stops near the black oak.
 The beetle squirms its way out of Lornedei's grasp and drops to the
 ground. It runs off, climbs up on the stone well, climbs back down,
 crawls through the bushes and seems to inspect the stone house, to
 finally stop at one of the paths.

 Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
 ear.

>examine bushes
 These bushes resemble those at the village road, but there are quite a
 few more of them. These look even more gnarled and deformed, as though
 starved of clean water and sunlight.
 These also have thorns as well as, oddly enough, plenty of purple nuts.

>touch thorns
 Lornedei is better off keeping her fingers away from those thorns.
 Losing her concentration could draw blood.
 The beetle disappears into the crumbling stone house. It comes back
 out, stays a moment in the opening, waving its antennae, before coming
 back to Lornedei.

>enter sleepwalker
 "Master?" She glances up at you, frowning, but she walks into the
 spinning mist.
 The sleepwalker stops spinning and Lornedei appears on the other side,
 apparently not sure where she is or why.
 Lornedei stares at the leaf clusters in the black forest. She looks
 away, biting her lower lip.

>h ld
 Lornedei is sleepwalking. She is having trouble following orders as
 well as using her magic. She can only perform the simplest things at

 abused.

>out

 Lornedei reaches for the nut but just a bit too fast. The sharp thorns
 puncture her skin. She pulls her hand back.

 The nut just got stained with Lornedei's blood.

 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

 She looks terrified but she decides to trust your judgment. She walks

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Portals)
 This square chamber is dominated by four portals. Each has a small
 impression to place one of the plaques. Lornedei came in from the
 northwest. If all portals are open, she can also go south, east, west
 or north.

 On the portal to the Hall of Severance is a small black plaque.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.

 Lornedei reaches down to scratch her ankle.

 southeast takes her to the rest of the field. West takes her past the
 east wall to the courtyard of the castle. Anything north of here is

 There is a shadow stretching out on the ground behind Lornedei. It
 folds into inky black and then it rises, takes one step away from her,

 Wasteland (By the Petrified Tree)
 This is nothing but wasteland. Scattered remains of a once big tree
 cover the ground. It might have been a great oak at one point. A dry
 and hot wind tears at her while throwing sand in her eyes and mouth.
 Beyond rocks, sand and starved soil, there is nothing but a gray mist.
 In the distant west, beyond more wasteland, she can see a high stone
 wall. South, the broken land dips down in a bowl beyond which is the
 forbidden forest. Southwest would take her back to the edge of the
 forest where she first entered the field.
 Lornedei wipes her forehead with her shirtsleeve.

>dig
 What do you want Lornedei to dig?

>ground

 Lornedei digs a hole in the dry ground.
 Lornedei's shadow jerks to life, reaches for her ankle, and pulls. She
 stumbles.

>put nut in hole
 She needs to be holding the purple nut with thorns before she can put
 it into something else.

>take nut
 If you insist.

>put nut in hole
 Lornedei inspects the nut carefully. She looks pleased. She plants the
 nut in the ground, flattens the soil over the nut and steps back.

 She smiles expectantly and lifts one hand. She turns it over and lets a
 blue spark appear. It turns to red as she focuses on it, and then she
 blows it towards her little patch of garden.

 The wind suddenly changes direction. It seems to come from everywhere
 now, focusing on the thorn that slowly grows out of the ground, feeding
 it. Lornedei looks up. The mist follows the wind, billowing like clouds
 towards the new tree. A turmoil of gray soon covers the entire field,
 tightens, grows heavy, and darkness falls.

 The single thorn grows, pointing straight up towards the mist, and the
 ground seems restless under Lornedei's feet. The mist sinks further to
 meet the thorn, a greasy black spike, taller than Lornedei now and
 growing still. A small slit opens up at the base of the spike. it oozes
 a black liquid before a smaller spike is thrust straight out of it,
 barely missing Lornedei.

 More slits appear and more of these spiked branches come to be. The
 "tree" continues to grow. The base is now two paces wide and suddenly
 the earth cracks around it. The spikes, more than thirty now, reach out
 several paces in every direction, twisting and deforming as they grow.
 The glistening black skin cracks and oozes more black sap, and thorns
 starts to grow from these as well.

 The crack in the stone widens, but the spike clings to the rock that
 isn't moving. It doesn't lose its grip as the spike grows down more
 than up, creating an enormous pillar going down in the mist and out of
 sight. The crack widens further and the ground shakes violently. With
 an enormous rumble and screaming stone, everything north of the spike
 falls out of sight in the deepening mist.
 At the same time in the Hall of Unification, a lush oak shudders as
 gray mist darkens the sky. In the village, the ground trembles and the
 blacksmith tries in vain to calm the horse he is putting new shoes on.
 Over the Aarkland river, the forgotten ones follow the mist that rolls
 out over the billowing field and the road. The villagers on the
 streets, on their porches, glancing out the door to call in their
 children for supper, fall silent. All look up at the sky to the
 northwest as the mist rolls closer.
 Lornedei puts the nut in the small hole in the ground.

 The hovering sleepwalker shows up at the edge of the forest. It picks
 up speed over the dry land, swirls up sand and dust and stays next to
 Lornedei.
 A black smoke is rising from the forbidden forest. It hovers over the
 treetops and is barely distinguishable from the constant mist. It moves
 closer and starts spinning. It drops down to the ground at the edge of
 the forest and forms a ragged column of black smoke. It swirls up sand
 and dust at touchdown. It picks up speed across the flat ground and
 stops close to Lornedei. It is turning slowly while releasing strands
 of broken smoke that dissolves in the air.

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is

 The spider reluctantly steps up on her hand.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>w.nw.n.d.se

 Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
 Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
 with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
 uniform gray ahead.

 The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
 the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
 field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
 side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
 dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
 forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
 cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
 an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
 northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.
 The sleepwalker stirs up a cloud of dust and dirt as it follows
 Lornedei.
 "What should I do?"

 Castle Courtyard
 Ahead of her is the southeastern corner of the castle. The corridor
 between the building and the outer wall leads northeast, but is blocked
 by a great pile of stone blocks and other debris. To the west, the
 courtyard ends at the ravine.

 Looking up, the facade disappears into a swirling ceiling of mist.
 Right at the corner of the castle, a narrow doorway leads north into
 darkness. She can look around, or walk around to learn more. South or
 southeast takes her away from the ruins. East brings her around to the
 east side of the east wall.

 The nightmare is here, spinning slowly. The frayed edges are constantly
 releasing veils of broken smoke that dissolves in the air.

 Deini is here.
 Deini yawns, utterly bored.

 Castle Ruins (In a Stone Corridor)
 A staircase leads down in darkness and south takes her out to the
 courtyard. The corridor seems to lead only to the dim light to the
 north.
 The sleepwalker stalks the courtyard.
 The column of black smoke rushes towards the opening, jerks through it.
 It struggles to stay, twitching.

 Castle Ruins (In the Guard Chamber)
 The spiral staircase ends in the middle of a square chamber. The west
 wall has fallen out into the ravine, letting in the glowing sunset. The
 walls that are still standing and the marble floor have cracked in
 several places. Rocks, a thick layer of dust, and all sorts of debris
 cover the floor. The only thing still intact is a stone statue standing
 in the southeast corner.

 The spiral staircase leads up and the west wall is open to the ravine.

 She can see an old torch here.
 The sleepwalker hovers past.

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Mirrors)
 This chamber is over ten paces across and perfectly square. A large
 oval mirror dominates each wall. Four mirrors. North, west, south and
 east.

 Lornedei came in from the northwest. An old burned out torch sits askew
 on the south wall.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.


>SAVE
>cf12
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>reach pile
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the pile of steel and stone or the
 long dead wizard?

>reach pile of steel
 Lornedei reaches into the strange pile of stone on the floor. A shiver
 runs through her body and the stone and steel is suddenly gone,
 replaced with a torch lit smooth marble floor.
 The room is full of people, all of them looking at the west mirror.
 They are nothing but diffuse memories of this chamber as it was, as it
 used to be, but the tension in the group is clear.

 Flickering torches on the walls light up the chamber, creating illusive
 shadows across frightened faces. The silent spirits seem to hesitate.

 They talk hastily among themselves, casting nervous looks into the
 mirror and over their shoulders. The mirror in this vision is whole and
 shows a picture of a giant golden oak. The image is fading with each
 breath. Several of the people in the crowd stagger as if the floor
 itself is moving. An old man raises a staff towards the mirror,
 uttering a string of words that catch the attention of the group. A
 young woman picks up a silently crying child in her arms, looks around
 the chamber and walks through the mirror. The rest of the crowd quickly
 follows her until only the old man remains.

 He takes a step towards the mirror but then he stops. Something that
 Lornedei is unable to see looms over him. His eyes widen in horror and
 his mouth opens in a silent scream. He raises his staff against the
 oncoming threat with a thin shaking hand. He knows the end is close as
 a shadow falls over his pale face. Several long moments he stands
 still, facing the danger while speaking words that cannot be heard,
 holding the staff in front of him. The horror in his eyes grows with
 each meaningless attack.

 His back straightens as the answer comes to him. Instead of fighting a
 futile battle, he turns to the mirror. He swings his staff with full
 force at the mirror. The glittering image disappears.

 Lornedei lowers her hand when the vision explodes in a shower of
 shattered glass and blood.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>give plate to him
 She can only do that to something living that has at least half a
 brain.

>look

 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Mirrors)
 This chamber is over ten paces across and perfectly square. A large
 oval mirror dominates each wall. Four mirrors. North, west, south and
 east.

 Lornedei came in from the northwest. An old burned out torch sits askew
 on the south wall.

 The stone pile still takes up too much room and the dead somebody is
 still very much dead.


>heal mirror
 Lornedei needs to know which one, the south mirror, the north mirror,
 the east mirror or the west mirror (broken)?

>go west
 Lornedei lifts her hand to the mirror, wondering if it is possible to
 heal. She gathers her powers and lets a thin blue streak of light touch
 the glass fragments. A sudden rumble makes her turn around, loosing the
 connection with the magic. The statue slides back over the opening in
 the wall. The sound of it drowns in a loud grinding noise. Steel
 against steel. The sound turns into a scream, a guttural growl.
 Lornedei staggers backwards as the floor shakes.
 The big pile of steel and stone stands before Lornedei with every
 seemingly random part now in its right place. The creature is almost
 twice as tall as the girl, and it stares down at her from within a
 diffuse darkness that surrounds it. This darkness is the force keeping
 all of its parts together and enabling the heavy body to move.

 An enormous head sits directly on a giant shoulder, and the jaw of
 rusty metal opens and closes constantly with a creaking and a clank
 that echoes in the chamber.
 The enormous body of stone shifts constantly, as if restless. The sound
 of stone grinding against stone, steel against stone and steel against
 steel is terribly loud.

 A crimson glow pulsates deep in a horizontal crack in the head.
 Puffs of dust fly out of the many joints between the rocks. Tufts of
 mold, moss, and shards of stone are raining down on the marble floor.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

 oval mirror dominates each wall. Four mirrors. North, west, south and

 Lornedei came in from the northwest. An old burned out torch sits askew
 on the south wall.

 Raccdaha stomps the floor, shifting its weight. It is getting ready to
 crush Lornedei.


 A black tendril of darkness creeps toward Lornedei's head. It touches
 her mind, and she can feel her powers weaken.

 Lornedei's magic just dropped by 4.

>give plate to raccdaha
 Lornedei holds up the silver plate with trembling hands. Raccdaha stops
 moving. He is quiet, absorbed by the reflection in the polished
 surface. He grabs the plate.
 His attention is far from Lornedei for a little while.
 Raccdaha is staring into the polished surface, oblivious.

>undo
 Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Mirrors)
 Let it be so!

>give spider to raccdaha
 Lornedei holds up the crystal spider in front of Raccdaha. He recoils,
 spewing out crimson sparks that rain down around Lornedei. He throws an
 arm out, and she has to throw herself backwards.
 Lornedei shakes her foot to get rid of a painful stone from her sandal.

>give plate to him
 Lornedei holds up the silver plate with trembling hands. Raccdaha stops
 moving. He is quiet, absorbed by the reflection in the polished
 surface. He grabs the plate.
 His attention is far from Lornedei for a little while.
 Lornedei glances up at you, uncertain.
 Raccdaha is staring into the polished surface, oblivious.

>throw spider at raccdaha
 Taking advantage of the distraction, Lornedei moves closer to Raccdaha
 with the crystal spider in her hand.
 The crystal spider jerks to life and jumps from her hand.
 A sparkling light flares up around it. The light grows stronger and
 Lornedei has to throw her hands up in front of her face to keep the
 blinding light from her eyes.
 As she steps back, she stumbles on the pile of bones and drops hard on
 the marble.
 A roar echoes in the chamber and the floor shakes.
 Raccdaha is moving away from Lornedei, trying to back away from the
 small creature of light.
 The spider is growing. Soon it is doubling, tripling, and quadrupling
 its size, becoming brighter each second. It glows furiously, the light
 pulsating as it keeps growing.
 the roaring increases and turns from rage into fear. Raccdaha is trying
 to shield itself from the light, but the light is everywhere. It throws
 its arms at the spider to crush it. It gets a hold of one leg of the
 spider, and with a sharp explosion, it pulverizes the leg. But the
 spider is already where it wants to be.
 The spider wraps its remaining legs around Raccdaha's head, obscuring
 it entirely. Raccdaha's trashing is slowly fading. The crushing arms
 have lost their aim and the few blows hitting the spider make little
 damage. A cloud of pulverized crystal sparkles in the pulsating light.
 The crimson light flares up through the spider's body, but it has no
 effect on the spider.
 The creature's head is now only a blinding light, and the swirling
 darkness starts to melt away from the rock. The roar of terror from the
 creature changes into a howling shriek that comes from everywhere.
 The sound cuts through Lornedei's mind and soul. Then the horrible
 scream is not just one.
 There are now hundreds, thousands of howling screams of terror and pain
 filling the chamber.
 The light from the crystal spider travels to the tips of the stone
 fingers on both hands and down the legs. As the light covers one stone
 foot and reaches to cover the final glimpse of gray mossy rock on the
 other foot, the screaming climbs in volume further. Then it stops,
 leaving only a ringing in Lornedei's ears.
 Finally, the darkness that held the stone limbs together is gone. The
 spider is gone, the light is fading and for a moment, Raccdaha stays
 upright. Then it falls into a pile of stone and steel.
 Lornedei hears the crash, but it is as if she hears it through water.
 The ringing is still loud in her head.
 She steps forward, and now the pile is actually nothing but stone and
 rusted steel covered with a layer of crystal dust.
 A glimmer catches her eye and she notices something golden lying among
 the stones.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine golden
 (the small golden plaque)
 It is a small round plaque made of purest gold. A carving on one side
 shows an old man kneeling before a small hole in the ground. He is
 holding a goblet of some sort in one hand. A giant oak can be seen in
 the background.

>take golden
 (the small golden plaque)
 As you wish.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>examine west
 (the west mirror (broken))
 The glass is cracked and dark. The frame surrounding the broken mirror
 seems to be in bad shape. There appears to be a shallow indentation in
 the top part of the frame. She may need to look closer at the frame.

>examine west frame
 The wide frame seems at first to be a mosaic of different types of
 frayed fabric. Upon closer inspection, it is clear that the frame is
 made up of different types of wood, stone, and even metal. It has
 however been demolished by something, cut and beaten into a mess of
 splinters. There seems to be an indentation in the top part of the
 frame but it may not be able to hold anything in place.

>heal west mirror
 Lornedei lets her blue light touch the shards of glass. One by one the
 pieces fuse together, leaving a smooth glass surface.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.
 The crystal dust rises, then floats above the pile of steel and stones.
 It spreads out in the chamber before surrounding Lornedei.
 The swirling dust stays motionless in the air for a few moments.
 Lornedei waits without fear.
 Then it reaches for her, entering her. She takes an involuntary breath
 and in an instant, the shimmering dust is gone.
 An enormous surge of power runs through her body.
 The ringing in her head disappears. Every bruise and cut she received
 this day fades and disappears.
 Lornedei is still, closing her eyes for a moment. Then she laughs
 aloud.
 "The light bearers will come back now. There is only one thing left to
 do."

 Lornedei's magic just went up...
 Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

>magic

 Lornedei's magic is currently at 10159.

>examine spider
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>put golder in west
 She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here?

>put golden in west
 (the small golden plaque in the west mirror)
 Lornedei puts the small golden plaque in the round hole on the frame.
 It goes into place with a click.

>reach west mirror
 The darkness in the mirror changes into a swirling mist. The portal to
 the Hall of Unification is open.

 Lornedei's magic drops by one.

>go west
 Lornedei steps through the mirror.

 Hall of Unification
 The disappointment is obvious. Lornedei turns around in the
 nothingness.
 "I thought..."
 She never tells you what she thought but there is no need. She sighs
 and scratches her head.
 She is surrounded by a shimmering mist. The ground is flat and
 featureless. She takes a few steps across the flat soil but the mist
 stays with her. There seems to be nowhere to go from here besides back
 to the hall of mirrors.

 The portal back into the hall of mirrors is open to the east.


>dig
 (the portal to the hall of mirrors)
 Lornedei digs in the soft fertile ground until she has a small hole.

>plant acorn
 She needs to be holding the golden acorn before she can put it into
 something else.

>take acorn
 As you wish.

 [Your holiness has just gone up by five.]

>plant acorn
 Lornedei drops the golden acorn into the hole.

>cover acorn
 That's not something she can close.

>water acorn
 Lornedei pours the Elder's water over the Golden acorn. She covers the
 hole with soil and steps back.

 At first, nothing happens. Then a soft golden light emerges from the
 soil covering the acorn. A shudder goes through the ground and the soil
 starts to bulge.
 The fog around Lornedei sings to her. It whispers long forgotten words
 to the earth below. A thin green leaf breaks The surface of the small
 pile of soil in front of Lornedei. It is quickly followed by another.
 They shoot out of the ground, eager to grow.

 A tree starts to grow before her eyes. A seedling turns into a sapling,
 the sapling turns into a young tree. With limbs trembling and leaves
 turning towards the sky it grows into a giant oak.

 The tree is growing leaves that shimmer in gold and silver, deep green
 and bright yellow. It keeps growing and the oak widens and stretches
 towards the sky to the sound of the singing mist.

 The branches reach out and turn silvery.  The leaves are gold. The tree
 just keeps growing and roots stretch out below the soil under
 Lornedei's feet. Lornedei takes a couple of steps back and watches the
 still changing tree in awe. The mist begins to disappear around the
 girl and the oak and it is done.

 The giant oak has finished growing and the leaves are humming in a soft
 wind coming from the west.

 Lornedei finds herself in the outskirts of a small village. She is
 standing next to the big golden oak. People gather around the tree and
 they all stare at it. The group consists of ten or so old women and
 even fewer old men in robes in sky blue, green and white. They have all
 gathered around the golden oak. A few of them cry, one laughs, one man
 grabs the arm of the man next to him for support. Smiling faces,
 trembling gestures towards this leaf or that. Excited whispers quickly
 fade as one of the old women comes forward.

 She walks very slowly, supporting herself on a long staff. Despite her
 fragile appearance, Lornedei can feel the power within her.

 Her voice is old. Her face is ancient. The words she speaks are spoken
 slowly.
 "We knew you were coming child but it took so long, so very long." she
 smiles and holds out her hands to Lornedei that takes them in her own.
 "I should have known you were a powerful one child.
 Now she turns towards the people. She pushes Lornedei ahead and raises
 a hand to get their full attention, a totally unnecessary gesture as
 they are all staring at the girl
 "Raccdaha is gone. He has been cast out of this world. He is beyond the
 eternal void. I cannot sense him any longer. The giant old ones are
 three again and the balance of the three will heal the land. Now we
 must step back into the world to receive the new light bearers that
 will come. We have waited long for the passage to open. We fled from
 the world outside, but now the time has come."
 "We are old now and we are still many years older than we seem. We are
 tired and not as strong as we used to be. The mist that trapped us here
 has also kept us alive for centuries. Now the mist is gone. Do you
 understand what this means girl?"
 Lornedei nods but she looks uncertain.
 The old light bearer removes a chain from her neck and holds it out to
 Lornedei. On the chain hangs a crystal spider. The old woman hangs it
 around Lornedei's neck without a word.
 Lornedei can hear a low murmuring of approval from the small group of
 people gathered and when the former Queen of the light bearers holds
 her arm out Lornedei gently takes it under her own and smiles.
 The new queen of this so far very small kingdom straightens her back
 and turns to the people.
