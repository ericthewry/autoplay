 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 You wake and see blood.

 There's blood everywhere. So much blood, that at first you don't
 realise there's a figure behind the blood. It's alive, just; there's a
 face, twisted with pain, and more blood that bubbles from its mouth as
 it breathes, and a hand that spasms as it tries to paw at the thing
 projecting from where a chest should be. The eyes gaze into yours.
 There is still life and desperation there, but it it knows that it is
 quickly running out.

 You want to help. You reach out --- and that is when you realise that
 you are looking into the inside of the reflective cockpit canopy, and
 that the face you can see is yours.

 Changes
 An Interactive Fiction by David Given

 You wake.

 Something's different.

 Cocoon
 You are immersed in a warm, comforting heap of something soft. It
 envelops you like an old blanket.

>examine cocoon
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine heap
 It's not dissimilar to cotton wool, although feels both more fibrous
 and less clinging.

>out
 You fight your way free of the cottony stuff. Dim light blinds you for
 a moment.

 Forest Cathedral
 The trees here are huge: massive columnar towers rising out of the soft
 green turf to support the dense leaf canopy above. Golden rays angle
 down between the trees, filling the vast space with dim light, and
 reflecting off the river that runs down the east side. The air seems
 permeated with peacefulness.

 Large green cocoons are attached to the bases of some of the trees.

 You climb out of the pile of fluff to find it's heaped on a low, leafy
 dais. As you step off, the dais silently folds closed behind you to
 become one of the cocoons.

>examine cocoons
 On closer inspection, the cocoons are actually growing out of the
 trees. They're hard balls of veiny green leaves of all different sizes,
 from half a metre to several metres in diameter. You're not sure which
 one you climbed out of.

>examine open cocoon
 On closer inspection, the cocoons are actually growing out of the
 trees. They're hard balls of veiny green leaves of all different sizes,
 from half a metre to several metres in diameter. You're not sure which
 one you climbed out of.

>open cocoon
 (the closed cocoons)
 They open and close by themselves.

>tickle cocoon
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory
 You aren't carrying anything.

>about
 Changes is a game by David Given. This is the IFComp 2012 edition.

 If you're new to interactive fiction, I would strongly suggest visiting
 a website such as [<a href="http://pr-if.org/play">LINK</A>], which will explain what it's
 all about and what the commands are.

 As basic advice for playing Changes: the game can be completed using
 simple verb-noun commands. If you find yourself trying to do things
 with other things, or putting stuff on top of other stuff, you may want
 to try reconsidering your approach.

 This game is polite by the Zarfian Cruelty Scale. There are occasions
 when the game can become uncompletable but it's totally obvious when
 this has happened.

 If you have any comments or feedback or cakes, please send them to
 dg@cowlark.com.

>xyzzy
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine me
 You walk over to the water and study your reflection. The river is wide
 and dark, and in the dim light makes an almost perfect mirror.

 Rather than the face you were expecting --- a battered one, but human
 --- you instead see a furry snout with bulbous eyes on each side and a
 wide mouth.

 You recognise it from the survey report: the temporary name tagged on
 the creature is rabbit, for fairly obvious reasons. Numbly, you find
 yourself interested that you're finally seeing one up close.

 It's definitely you. Now you're actually noticing, it's perfectly
 apparent that the body you're inhabiting is not your own. The fact that
 it feels totally natural is strangely unnerving.

 But that still doesn't explain how, or why, although you can make a
 decent guess at where.

>examine trees
 Your gaze slowly follows the tree trunks up to the canopy far overhead.
 It's an awesome sight. You've never seen anything this big that was
 alive before. At least, not in person. You recognise it from the
 Concerto's survey photographs: it's a Mother Tree.

 The Mother Tree is, according to the Concerto, a commensal plant which
 is semi-symbiotic on the surrounding wildlife. Actually getting more
 details was like pulling hen's teeth; the ship wouldn't answer
 questions about them, and the survey department seemed to be almost
 frightened. Eventually you managed to push enough alcohol down Francis
 so that he muttered something about taking life with one hand and
 giving it back with the other before he clammed up.

>examine river
 The river is wide and dark, and in the dim light makes an almost
 perfect mirror.

 Yes, still a rabbit. You stare in horrified fascination for a few
 moments.

>go east
 The canopy is so dense that it's almost like wicker, and is completely
 impossible to push through. The only ways out seems to be the low
 arches to the north and south where the river passes through.

>go north
 Just as you're about to move, you see motion at the northern edge of
 the Mother Tree. In panic, you dive behind a tree.

 A shape emerges from the light of the river arch: one rabbit dragging
 another. The one that is doing the pulling is a bit bigger than you
 are, and marked in black and white. The one on the ground... is
 obviously dead, eyes staring, grey fur tattered and muddy. It's heavy
 and awkward and the black and white rabbit is having difficulty moving
 it.

 As you watch, one of the green cocoons silently splits open and
 unfolds. The black and white rabbit glances in your direction and then
 continues dragging the corpse after it into the cocoon.

 ...the rabbit knows very little, but it knows this: its companion was
 once alive, and is now dead. And it wants it to be alive. This cannot
 happen, but there is a way they can be reunited, and the Mother Tree is
 kind. The rabbit is old and tired but it has enough strength to do
 this, and so it drags the rigid corpse to the Mother Tree. The strange
 zombie rabbit is watching it, but that is unimportant now. All there is
 left to do is wait.

 ...what just happened?

 Are you sure you want to quit?

>examine rabbit


 The cocoon closes, as silently as it opened, about the two rabbits.

 The wide mouth, widely-spaced bulbous eyes, and folded frog-like hind
 legs made Francis want to call these creatures <span class="floydstyle em">ribbits</span>. To
 everyone's relief, the <span class="floydstyle em">Concerto</span> put its foot down and
 insisted that any names assigned now be strictly temporary: the
 exploitation team, if they ever landed on Elysia, would have the
 naming rights. And so for now, everyone's just calling them
 <span class="floydstyle em">rabbits</span>.

 Knowing human nature, of course, they'll probably be rabbits from now
 until the end of time, and you find yourself wondering whether Francis
 did it on purpose.

>again

 On closer inspection, the cocoons are actually growing out of the

 sure which one you climbed out of.

>examine mother tree

 overhead. It's an awesome sight. You've never seen anything this big
 that was alive before. At least, not in person. You recognise it from

 Francis so that he muttered something about taking life with one hand
 and giving it back with the other before he clammed up.

>go north


 You emerge, blinking, into the sunlight. Once your eyes have adjusted,
 you look up. Yes, this is Elysia. The <span class="floydstyle em">Semiquaver</span> at least
 managed to crash on the right planet.

 Although you <span class="floydstyle em">were</span> hurt pretty badly. Maybe the
 <span class="floydstyle em">Concerto</span> picked you up and this is some sort of recuperative
 virtuality? That would at least explain the whole... rabbit... thing.

 Assuming for sanity's sake that this is real, the shuttle should be
 around here somewhere.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marsh</span>
 Here in the shadow of the Mother Tree the ground is flat and wet;
 reed-like plants with white flowers grow everywhere and the air is
 musky. The river winds slowly along the east side of the marsh with
 woodlands beyond it. To the west the ground rises to what look like a
 series of sandy bluffs. The ground looks drier to the north where the
 canyon ramparts start to close in.

 A small group of deer-like animals, much larger than you are, is
 grazing here. One of them turns its head to look at you.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The buck is completely secure in his world. He has few needs: his</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">mates, enough to eat, safety. Here in the canyon the only thing he has</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to be at all wary of is that annoying little creature with the sharp</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">teeth that is always hanging around; if it ever came close enough he</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">could kill it with a single kick, but it always keeps its distance.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">There is a nagging itch at the back of his mind, however: somewhere in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the canyon there is the smell of the Wonderful Plant. He just can't</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">find it.</span>

 There. It happened again. The deer stare into space for a while.

 Something... very strange... starts to happen. You find yourself with
 this strong feeling of peacefulness, except you know it's not you
 feeling it; you can even sense the direction. You never felt anything
 like it before, but nevertheless, you can distinctly feel peacefulness
 from the west.

>examine deer


 There are five of the creatures. One male, two females, and a couple
 of juveniles? It's very hard to tell, as they're all very similar
 apart from the size. They're smaller than you were expecting from the
 survey, barely the size of a large dog, but the blue-green fur is just
 as startling as you remember. They each have a single forward-curving
 horn that looks extremely sharp.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off west.

 A vicious-looking brown and white creature trots up from the north.
 You see bright eyes and hunger. The survey report mentioned these.
 It's a...

 <span class="floydstyle em">The fox is hungry, but it is always hungry. A long time ago it was</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">mauled by one of those horrible animals at the dam, and was unable to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">hunt and was starving; then it found a dead deer, and gorged itself on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the half-rancid meat. It was the best thing it ever experienced, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">for a few brief hours afterwards, it was replete. Now it follows the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">deer around endlessly. They are far too large for it to kill, but it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">lives in hope of another windfall. In the meantime it scavanges for</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">insects and tiny furry things. And, of course, it's always on the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">lookout for a bigger meal.</span>

 You blink, disoriented.

 It eagerly begins to chase you.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warren</span>
 This little grassy hollow half-way up the side of the canyon looks
 like it's been colonised by rabbits. The tough grass-like ground
 covering has been dug away and the sandy soil underneath is full of
 burrows. Down to the east the view over the Mother Tree is
 spectacular, and you wonder what it would be like from the top; you
 can probably climb up to the west. The slope steepens and becomes
 impassably steep to the south, but the warren continues to the north.

 There are burrows everywhere.

 You're suddenly face to face with a swarm of small furry creatures,
 scattered across the grass. For a moment you panic... and then you
 recognise them as other rabbits. Some of them look at you, but mostly
 they ignore you completely. You study them, fascinated. You never
 realised they came in so many different colours.

 A rabbit scratches itself.

 The rabbits, all in unison, suddenly look to the east for a moment.
 Then briskly but calmly they file into the burrows and are gone.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off north.

 The fox is chasing behind you from the east.

>examine burrows


 There are rabbits sitting in the entrance of the burrows staring at
 you.

 The fox pounces on you. You just have time to think <span class="floydstyle em">oh, sh---</span>
 as its jaws close on your neck, and then everything stops.



     <span class="floydstyle i">*** You have been eaten ***</span>

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warren</span>

>enter burrow


 The burrow is blocked by a large rabbit. It stares at you calmly. It's
 quite unthreatening, but it's still not letting you in.

 The fox pounces on you. You just have time to think <span class="floydstyle em">oh, sh---</span>

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warren</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sandy Mound</span>
 Part of the canyon wall has fallen here, forming a huge bank of sandy
 rubble. This looks like it used to be part of the rabbit warren you
 can see to the south, but this section has been abandoned. Part of the
 mound has begun to be colonised by the woods that extend to the north.
 You can see the river in the distance down to the east.

 The bank doesn't look very stable and is full of partially collapsed
 burrows.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off north.

 The fox is chasing behind you from the south.

 There's that strange sensation again, of caution from the south.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Meadow</span>
 The flat river valley here isn't as wet as the marsh further south,
 and has bloomed into an astonishing wildflower meadow. The flowers are
 all strange and alien, of course, but the air is fragrant and
 peaceful. The only sound is the gentle noise of the river to the east.
 Off to the west the ground begins to rise up to meet the canyon wall,
 while forests dominate the north.

 The fox is chasing behind you from the west.

>go east


 The river's in the way, and rabbits can't swim.

 The fox pounces on you. You just have time to think <span class="floydstyle em">oh, sh---</span>
 as its jaws close on your neck, and then everything stops.



     <span class="floydstyle i">*** You have been eaten ***</span>

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Meadow</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rapids</span>
 The river is narrow and rocky here, and the river churns noisily
 between the boulders. Trees come down to the water's edge on both
 sides, and twigs and dead leaves spiral dizzyingly in the vortices.
 The woods are fairly dense here and seem to go on in all directions.

 The fox is chasing behind you from the south.

 You can feel contentment from the west.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Open Woodland</span>
 The ground rises to meet the canyon wall to the west here, and small
 trees are scattered across the slope. There is very little
 undergrowth, lending the woods an airy, garden-like feel. The trees
 get denser to the north and east, but space opens out to the south.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off north.

 The fox is chasing behind you from the east.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boulder</span>
 A massive slab of rock has fallen into the woods from the canyon walls
 to the west. It is halfway sunk into the turf and looks almost
 sculpted. The canyon wall looms over you from the west. The woodlands
 parallel it, running north-south, although the canyon steepens to the
 north. Water glints between the trees to the east.

 The huge boulder towers over the surrounding trees.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off north.

 The fox is chasing behind you from the south.

>climb boulder


 You jump and scrabble wildly with your powerful hind legs, eventually
 managing to haul yourself to the top.

 The fox sniffs around a bit, obviously having lost track of you, and
 then gives up trying to figure out where you've gone.

 There's that peculiar sensation again; there is a new feeling of
 annoyance from the north.

>examine boulder


 A long spear of stone, projecting from the ground at an angle. Little
 wiry plants are rooted in the cracks.

 The fox snaps at a flea.

 You suddenly notice the feeling of annoyance changing to irritation
 from the north.

>examine plants


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine fox


 The fox looks even less like a fox than the rabbits looked like
 rabbits. It's more cat-like than dog-like, with a mottled brown and
 white coat and long, lynx-like ears; but the tail is bushy and it's a
 carnivore, so the name stuck.

 The fox paces off to the north.

>examine plants


 You can't see any such thing.

>go down


 You jump down from the boulder.

 You sense the feeling of irritation fading and a new feeling of hunger
 from the north.

 You can feel hunger from the north.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 A half-dozen or so humped, stocky creatures are bustling about,
 working on the dam: Elysian beavers. They bustle about, working on the
 dam.

>examine fish


 They're brown and trout-like, but on closer inspection the fins are
 all wrong and the tail is bifurcated. You think that Elysia could have
 some very plausible mermaid myths.

 A beaver pulls something out of the dam, and the other beavers start
 barking in panic at it.

>examine beavers


 Unlike the other Earth namesakes in the canyon, the beavers here look
 <span class="floydstyle em">absolutely nothing like</span> the Earth kind. They're small and
 stocky, with a bulldog neck and serrated tusks that stick out sideways
 from their mouths which they use to saw through trees. They don't have
 big teeth, they don't gnaw and they certainly don't have the trademark
 tail. The dam they're building isn't much good, either.

 You did ask Francis about them, you remember: he was the primary
 author of the survey report. He just shrugged. "They had a dam, and we
 ran out of imagination," he said.

 Two beavers seem to be arguing over where to place a forked branch.

 You sense a new feeling of annoyance from the north.

>examine dam


 The dam is a big embankment of logs. Unlike dams built by Earth
 beavers, they haven't sealed it with mud, and the water is pouring
 through in numerous places. This doesn't seem to affect the water
 level in the lake, though.

 The deer gallop up from the north with a thunder of hooves. They spend
 several moments looking around with suspicion before returning to
 their grazing.

 The beavers suddenly dash up towards the deer, trying to drive them
 away from the dam and the river bed.

 One of the beavers darts in to nip one of the deer's legs, but a
 flourish of the deer's horn sends it running.

 You sense annoyance fading from the north.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 Over on the other side of the lake, a black animal is playing on the
 edge of the water. It never seems to stay still and it takes you a few
 moments to identify it as an Elysian otter.

 You almost run into the fox again. It eagerly begins to chase you.

 You can feel hostility and irritation from the south.

 One of the smaller deer lips the grass in a dissatisfied manner.

 You can feel hunger from the north.

>examine hunger


 All you can tell is that it's coming from the north.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off south. The beavers
 relax, disperse, and go about their business again.

 One of the beavers rests for a moment on top of the dam, enjoying the
 sun.

 The fox approaches from the north. It eagerly begins to chase you.

 The beavers suddenly notice the fox and start hissing threateningly.
 It stays well over to the west side of the dam.

 You sense hunger fading from the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Forest</span>
 The woodland here is quite unlike the west side of the canyon. The
 trees are short and gnarled and look quite unhealthy: they are also
 very close together and visibilty through the tangled branches is
 poor. Despite the gloom, the undergrowth is thick, with ferns, tall
 grasses, and less identifiable plants filling the space between the
 tree trunks. The forest sweeps east up to the rock face above and
 south as far as you can see through the trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 You can feel hostility and irritation from the west.

>examine hunger


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine irriation


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine plant


 Unlike the animals, this plant defies neat categorisation into the
 Earth ecosystem. A great froth of slightly furry parsley-like leaves
 shields long, razor sharp thorns underneath. It smells intensely of...
 something. Mint crossed with vanilla? It's very strong and not very
 appetising.

 You sense irritation fading and a new feeling of hunger from the west.

>examine irritation


 You can't see any such thing.

>take plant


 You gingerly take a mouthful of leaves, avoiding the thorns.

 You sense hunger fading and hostility changing to concentration from
 the west.

>inventory


 You are carrying a bundle of aromatic leaves in your mouth.

>go east


 You can't go that way.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spring</span>
 The ground here is steep and rocky, but still covered with scrawny
 trees. The canyon wall rises precipitously to the east; there's a band
 of wet rock, and water oozes out and forms in a little pool before
 trickling down the slope to the river which you can just make out to
 the west. All you can see to the north and south are more trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 A pair of shining eyes stares at you from out of the thorny bush.
 After a few seconds, the shape of a vaguely anthropoid creature
 resolves around them. Ah, yes, you remember this: it's a lemur. You
 have just enough warning to brace yourself before...

 <span class="floydstyle em">The lemur stares at the strange rabbit with a distant curiosity.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Its mind is unfocused, blurred by the psychedelic drug in the leaves</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">it loves so much. It knows that the rabbit is unusual, but it doesn't</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">care. It doesn't care much about anything except the leaves. It just</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">sits and watches the world, and occasionally, when the colours focus</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">for a moment, interacts with it.</span>

 That was... unusual.

 The lemur is sitting in one of the thorny bushes.

 The lemur seems to find something very interesting under one armpit.

 There must be something about Earth-like planets. In shape the Elysian
 lemur is a startlingly similar creature to the ones in the
 <span class="floydstyle em">Concerto</span>'s garden, with long spindly arms and legs and
 delicate fingers. The green and brown mottled fur is different,
 though.

 The lemur bounces out of the bush, shoots up a tree and leaps through
 the branches to the north.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Slopes</span>
 Nestled in the south-east corner of the canyon, the terrain here
 sweeps up from the river to a low pass through the canyon wall to the
 east. Through the dense trees you can just make out the green dome of
 the Mother Tree far below to the south-west.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

>examine mother tree


 From here you can see the way the Mother Tree completely blocks the
 throat of the canyon.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern Desert</span>
 The pass in the canyon wall, now behind you to the west, leads out
 into open desert. Barren sand stretches off in all directions to the
 flat horizon.

 A track seems to have been scraped in the sand, heading south. There's
 something large and metallic in the distance that way.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wrecked Shuttle</span>
 The desert abruptly drops away on two sides here: to the west you can
 see the green dome of the Mother Tree a few hundred metres below, and
 to the south the incomparably vaster drop down to the sea of clouds
 below. The cliff continues east as far as the eye can see.

 Of considerably more interest, however, is the wreckage of the
 <span class="floydstyle em">Semiquaver</span>.

 The shuttle's main hatch is tightly closed.

>examine shuttle


 Looking at the smashed shuttle, you find yourself utterly astonished
 that it made it down in one piece. Most of the engine module is simply
 missing, the hull truncated half-way along in a jumble of twisted
 wreckage. The shuttle hit the ground to the north of here, and skidded
 south, stopping just in time --- you can see the burnt out shield
 projectors where the <span class="floydstyle em">Semiquaver</span> tried to dig into the sand in
 a desperate attempt to stop itself. It worked, too: only a few metres
 more and the <span class="floydstyle em">Semiquaver</span> would have gone over the edge of the
 cliff and fallen down to the lowlands. The nose actually overhangs the
 edge.

 It looks completely dead. You hope the <span class="floydstyle em">Semiquaver</span>'s simple
 mind survived. You want to buy it a drink and tell it what a good job
 it did.

>examine hatch


 The <span class="floydstyle em">Semiquaver</span>'s main hatch is on the starboard side, now
 facing west. It's not locked, per se, but in order to prevent
 accidents it will only open if you enter an access code on a little
 panel. (The code is written underneath.)

>read code


 A little nine-digit keypad is next to the door. The access code is
 written underneath. (It's 314159, of course.)

>examine keypad

>examine cluff

>examine cliff


 Which do you mean, the western cliff or the southern cliff?

>examine souther

>examine southern cliff


 The edge of the cliff under the nose of the shuttle is fractured and
 crumbly, and you're not willing to go close enough to look down. You
 know what you'll see, though: several thousand metres of empty air and
 then the opaque cloud that covers the lowlands. The only way to get
 down there is at terminal velocity.

>examine western cliff


 You sidle close to the edge and try to peer over. The drop sucks at
 you and you can feel your paws sweating. You get a climpse of the
 green dome of the Mother Tree far below before backing away with great
 relief.

>go east


 The edge of the plateau goes on as far as you can see, and there is
 absolutely nothing of interest you can see out there.

>examine debris


 You remember a flash not long after leaving the <span class="floydstyle em">Concerto</span>; the
 <span class="floydstyle em">Semiquaver</span> said "Oh, no," and then something stabbed you in
 the back. Everything after that was a vivid but incoherent memory of
 pain, noise, blood spattering everywhere, and the sight of Elysia
 wheeling through the cockpit canopy while the <span class="floydstyle em">Semiquaver</span>
 quietly gibbered. You don't like to think about it --- it makes your
 fur stand on end.

>rub shuttle


 You achieve nothing by this.

>dance

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spring</span>
 The ground here is steep and rocky, but still covered with scrawny
 trees. The canyon wall rises precipitously to the east; there's a band
 of wet rock, and water oozes out and forms in a little pool before
 trickling down the slope to the river which you can just make out to
 the west. All you can see to the north and south are more trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 You can feel peacefulness from the north.

>examine pool


 The water is reddish and probably full of minerals.

>drink water


 Not when you're carrying the bundle of aromatic leaves in your mouth!

>inventory


 You are carrying a bundle of aromatic leaves in your mouth.

>drop leaves


 (the bundle of aromatic leaves)
 You carefully put down the bundle of aromatic leaves.

 There's a loud rustling of leaves as the lemur swings up from the
 north, runs down a tree and dives into the spiky bush.

 You sense peacefulness fading from the north.

>drink water


 The water tastes just the way it looks.

 The lemur languidly picks up a some small insect of some kind, stares
 at it for a while, and then pulls the legs off before throwing it
 away.

>take leaves


 Which do you mean, the bundle of aromatic leaves, the trees or the
 aromatic bush?

>the bundle of aromatic leaves


 In the absence of any other options, you pick up the bundle of
 aromatic leaves in your mouth.

 The lemur just stares into space for a while.

>examine insect


 You can't see any such thing.

>gives leaves to lemur


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>give leaves to lemur


 (the bundle of aromatic leaves to the lemur)
 The lemur doesn't seem interested.

 The lemur licks itself contemplatively.

>lemur, hello


 There's no way you, or anyone else, can reach the lemur while it's
 inside those thorny bushes.

 The lemur gives you a suspicious look.

>enter bushes


 That's not something you can enter.

 The lemur starts carefully pulling leaves off a twig and popping them
 into its mouth, one by one.

>feed leaf to lemur

 The lemur doesn't seem interested.

 The lemur bounces out of the bush, shoots up a tree and leaps through
 the branches to the north.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Forest</span>
 The woodland here is quite unlike the west side of the canyon. The
 trees are short and gnarled and look quite unhealthy: they are also
 very close together and visibilty through the tangled branches is
 poor. Despite the gloom, the undergrowth is thick, with ferns, tall
 grasses, and less identifiable plants filling the space between the
 tree trunks. The forest sweeps east up to the rock face above and
 south as far as you can see through the trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 The lemur is sitting in one of the thorny bushes.

 The lemur gives you a suspicious look.

 You can feel concentration from the west.

 You sense a new feeling of peacefulness from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 The beavers bustle about, working on the dam.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 The little herd of deer is grazing here. The deer seem to find you
 utterly fascinating to an extent that makes you quite nervous.

 Over on the other side of the lake, a black animal is playing on the
 edge of the water. It never seems to stay still and it takes you a few
 moments to identify it as an Elysian otter.

 You can feel hunger from the north, and concentration from the south.

>show leaves to deer

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Precarious Ledge</span>
 You are balanced on a rock overhanging the north edge of the rock
 pool. The boulder is slippery from spray, and shifts under your feet
 when you move your weight giving you the feeling like it might give
 way at any moment. The narrow ledge to the south leads back to safety.

 The rock pool churns unnervingly below you.

 The fox chases you from the south onto the ledge --- which abruptly
 gives way underneath you. You, the fox, and what seems like several
 tonnes of rock drop into the water in a shocking plunge that stuns you
 for a few moments.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In The Rock Pool</span>
 From down here the sides of the pool are steeper and even less
 climbable than they were from above --- this is less of a pool and
 more of a well, and you are at the bottom of it. One of the many
 waterfalls crashes into the dark water near where you are and vortices
 in the water buffet you.

>go up

 You're not quite desperate enough to use your mouth to pick up things
 that have been chewed and spat out by something else.

 The deer gallop up from the north with a thunder of hooves. They spend
 several moments looking around with suspicion before returning to
 their grazing.

 Over on the other side of the lake, the otter appears to be chasing
 its own tail.

 You sense annoyance fading from the north.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 The beavers bustle about, working on the dam.

 You can feel annoyance from the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Forest</span>
 The woodland here is quite unlike the west side of the canyon. The
 trees are short and gnarled and look quite unhealthy: they are also
 very close together and visibilty through the tangled branches is
 poor. Despite the gloom, the undergrowth is thick, with ferns, tall
 grasses, and less identifiable plants filling the space between the
 tree trunks. The forest sweeps east up to the rock face above and
 south as far as you can see through the trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 You can feel peacefulness from the south, and concentration from the

 A massive slab of rock has fallen into the woods from the canyon walls

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Straggly Forest</span>
 The trees here are stunted and wiry, and the steeply sloping ground is

 shrunken by distance. The canyon ends not far to the north in a tumble
 of fallen rock.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 Over on the other side of the lake, you can see a trail of bubbles
 where the otter is swimming underwater.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cascades</span>
 The river pours out of an aperture in the northern wall of the canyon

 eastern shore is a sheer rockface, but the western shore is a rocky
 slope that rises to meet the canyon wall in the distance. Some trees
 hug the edge of the water.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Desert</span>

 see where the river falls away over the edge of the cliff.

 angle down between the trees, filling the vast space with dim light,

 seems permeated with peacefulness.

 Large green cocoons are attached to the bases of some of the trees.

 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 The beavers bustle about, working on the dam.

 You can feel hunger from the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boulder</span>
 A massive slab of rock has fallen into the woods from the canyon walls
 to the west. It is halfway sunk into the turf and looks almost
 sculpted. The canyon wall looms over you from the west. The woodlands
 parallel it, running north-south, although the canyon steepens to the
 north. Water glints between the trees to the east.

 The huge boulder towers over the surrounding trees.

 You can feel concentration from the east.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Straggly Forest</span>
 The trees here are stunted and wiry, and the steeply sloping ground is
 showing its rocky bones through the thin grass. The canyon is spread
 out below you: the lake to your east, the woodland covering the lower
 slopes, and the green dome of the Mother Tree far to the south, now
 shrunken by distance. The canyon ends not far to the north in a tumble
 of fallen rock.

 The deer gallop up from the north with a thunder of hooves. They spend
 several moments looking around with suspicion before returning to
 their grazing.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scree</span>
 You are perched at the very north-west tip of the canyon, where the
 slopes disintegrate into a tangle of smashed rock. Wiry, heather-like
 grass grows between the gaps between the boulders, and there are even
 a few trees. Below to the east is a maelstrom of white water at the
 head of the river; to the south, the slope begins to flatten.

 Tiny multicoloured birds dart back and forth on the cliff face above
 you.

 You almost run into the fox again. It eagerly begins to chase you.

 You can feel annoyance from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 The deer walk purposefully up from the west.

 Over on the other side of the lake, the otter is floating on its back,
 apparently studying the sky.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cascades</span>
 The river pours out of an aperture in the northern wall of the canyon

 the lake, to the south. The noise of rushing water is everywhere. The
 eastern shore is a sheer rockface, but the western shore is a rocky
 slope that rises to meet the canyon wall in the distance. Some trees
 hug the edge of the water.

 Water pours around, through, and over the massive pile of boulders.
 There are nooks and crannies and vortices everywhere.

 The water swirling in one large rock pool in particular catches your
 eye.

 The fox approaches from the west. It eagerly begins to chase you.

 The fox sniffs around a bit, obviously having lost track of you, and
 then gives up trying to figure out where you've gone.

 That fox is really annoying, but at least you can run faster than it
 can --- provided you keep moving it's no real danger. You're grimly
 sure that a real rabbit would have some kind of animal sense to let it
 keep a safe distance away.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Straggly Forest</span>
 The trees here are stunted and wiry, and the steeply sloping ground is
 showing its rocky bones through the thin grass. The canyon is spread
 out below you: the lake to your east, the woodland covering the lower
 slopes, and the green dome of the Mother Tree far to the south, now
 shrunken by distance. The canyon ends not far to the north in a tumble
 of fallen rock.

 The fox approaches from the north. It eagerly begins to chase you.

 You can feel irritation from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boulder</span>
 A massive slab of rock has fallen into the woods from the canyon walls
 to the west. It is halfway sunk into the turf and looks almost
 sculpted. The canyon wall looms over you from the west. The woodlands
 parallel it, running north-south, although the canyon steepens to the
 north. Water glints between the trees to the east.

 The huge boulder towers over the surrounding trees.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Open Woodland</span>
 The ground rises to meet the canyon wall to the west here, and small

 undergrowth, lending the woods an airy, garden-like feel. The trees
 get denser to the north and east, but space opens out to the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sandy Mound</span>
 Part of the canyon wall has fallen here, forming a huge bank of sandy
 rubble. This looks like it used to be part of the rabbit warren you
 can see to the south, but this section has been abandoned. Part of the
 mound has begun to be colonised by the woods that extend to the north.
 You can see the river in the distance down to the east.

 The bank doesn't look very stable and is full of partially collapsed
 burrows. One of them has been dug free of sand.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off south.

 You can feel peacefulness from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warren</span>
 This little grassy hollow half-way up the side of the canyon looks
 like it's been colonised by rabbits. The tough grass-like ground
 covering has been dug away and the sandy soil underneath is full of
 burrows. Down to the east the view over the Mother Tree is
 spectacular, much better than it was from the top; you can probably
 climb up to the west. The slope steepens and becomes impassably steep
 to the south, but the warren continues to the north.

 There are burrows everywhere.

 The ground is covered with rabbits.

 Several rabbits are sitting motionless close to each other, with an
 air of being busy.

 The rabbits, all in unison, suddenly look to the north for a moment.
 Then briskly but calmly they file into the burrows and are gone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Desert</span>
 You were wrong: the view is terrible from here. Outside the canyon
 there is just barren, sandy wasteland, with the occasional scrubby
 plant, stretching away in all directions. There are mountains on the
 horizon, but there's no way you could survive out here long enough to
 reach them. Down to the east the oasis of the canyon is mostly hidden
 behind the terrain. There is a rise to the south, near where the land
 stops.

 You can feel excitement and caution from the east.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,

 The woodland here is quite unlike the west side of the canyon. The
 trees are short and gnarled and look quite unhealthy: they are also
 very close together and visibilty through the tangled branches is
 poor. Despite the gloom, the undergrowth is thick, with ferns, tall
 grasses, and less identifiable plants filling the space between the
 tree trunks. The forest sweeps east up to the rock face above and
 south as far as you can see through the trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 The lemur is sitting in one of the thorny bushes.

 The lemur languidly picks up a some small insect of some kind, stares
 at it for a while, and then pulls the legs off before throwing it
 away.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 The beavers bustle about, working on the dam.

 You can feel hunger from the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rapids</span>
 The river is narrow and rocky here, and the river churns noisily

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Meadow</span>
 The flat river valley here isn't as wet as the marsh further south,

 Off to the west the ground begins to rise up to meet the canyon wall,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marsh</span>
 Here in the shadow of the Mother Tree the ground is flat and wet;
 reed-like plants with white flowers grow everywhere and the air is

 woodlands beyond it. To the west the ground rises to what look like a
 series of sandy bluffs. The ground looks drier to the north where the
 canyon ramparts start to close in.

 You can feel peacefulness from the west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warren</span>
 This little grassy hollow half-way up the side of the canyon looks
 like it's been colonised by rabbits. The tough grass-like ground
 covering has been dug away and the sandy soil underneath is full of
 burrows. Down to the east the view over the Mother Tree is
 spectacular, much better than it was from the top; you can probably
 climb up to the west. The slope steepens and becomes impassably steep
 to the south, but the warren continues to the north.

 There are burrows everywhere.

 The ground is covered with rabbits.

 One rabbit chases another a few metres.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sandy Mound</span>
 Part of the canyon wall has fallen here, forming a huge bank of sandy

 mound has begun to be colonised by the woods that extend to the north.
 You can see the river in the distance down to the east.

 The bank doesn't look very stable and is full of partially collapsed
 burrows. One of them has been dug free of sand.

 You can feel peacefulness from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Open Woodland</span>
 The ground rises to meet the canyon wall to the west here, and small
 trees are scattered across the slope. There is very little
 undergrowth, lending the woods an airy, garden-like feel. The trees
 get denser to the north and east, but space opens out to the south.

 The deer gallop up from the north with a thunder of hooves. They spend
 several moments looking around with suspicion before returning to
 their grazing.

 Dropped.

 There's a brief tussle as the deer fight for the bundle of aromatic
 leaves. The winner chews blissfully, green-tinted drool dripping from
 its mouth.

 You sense a new feeling of hunger from the north.

>examine deer


 There are five of the creatures. One male, two females, and a couple
 of juveniles? It's very hard to tell, as they're all very similar
 apart from the size. They're smaller than you were expecting from the
 survey, barely the size of a large dog, but the blue-green fur is just
 as startling as you remember. They each have a single forward-curving
 horn that looks extremely sharp.

 The deer suddenly look up, and then bound off south.

 A massive slab of rock has fallen into the woods from the canyon walls

 trees are short and gnarled and look quite unhealthy: they are also
 very close together and visibilty through the tangled branches is
 poor. Despite the gloom, the undergrowth is thick, with ferns, tall
 grasses, and less identifiable plants filling the space between the
 tree trunks. The forest sweeps east up to the rock face above and
 south as far as you can see through the trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 You can feel peacefulness from the south, and excitement and hostility
 from the west.

 You gingerly take a mouthful of leaves, avoiding the thorns.

 You sense excitement changing to hunger from the west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 The beavers bustle about, working on the dam.

 You can feel hunger from the north.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rapids</span>
 The river is narrow and rocky here, and the river churns noisily
 between the boulders. Trees come down to the water's edge on both
 sides, and twigs and dead leaves spiral dizzyingly in the vortices.
 The woods are fairly dense here and seem to go on in all directions.

 You can feel concentration from the north.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Open Woodland</span>
 The ground rises to meet the canyon wall to the west here, and small
 trees are scattered across the slope. There is very little
 undergrowth, lending the woods an airy, garden-like feel. The trees
 get denser to the north and east, but space opens out to the south.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sandy Mound</span>
 Part of the canyon wall has fallen here, forming a huge bank of sandy
 rubble. This looks like it used to be part of the rabbit warren you
 can see to the south, but this section has been abandoned. Part of the
 mound has begun to be colonised by the woods that extend to the north.
 You can see the river in the distance down to the east.

 The bank doesn't look very stable and is full of partially collapsed
 burrows. One of them has been dug free of sand.

 You can feel peacefulness from the south.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Meadow</span>
 The flat river valley here isn't as wet as the marsh further south,
 and has bloomed into an astonishing wildflower meadow. The flowers are
 all strange and alien, of course, but the air is fragrant and
 peaceful. The only sound is the gentle noise of the river to the east.
 Off to the west the ground begins to rise up to meet the canyon wall,
 while forests dominate the north.

 There are five of the creatures. One male, two females, and a couple
 of juveniles? It's very hard to tell, as they're all very similar
 apart from the size. They're smaller than you were expecting from the
 survey, barely the size of a large dog, but the blue-green fur is just
 as startling as you remember. They each have a single forward-curving
 horn that looks extremely sharp.

 The deer all watch you intently. Green-coloured slime dribbles out of
 their mouths.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warren</span>
 This little grassy hollow half-way up the side of the canyon looks
 like it's been colonised by rabbits. The tough grass-like ground
 covering has been dug away and the sandy soil underneath is full of
 burrows. Down to the east the view over the Mother Tree is
 spectacular, much better than it was from the top; you can probably
 climb up to the west. The slope steepens and becomes impassably steep
 to the south, but the warren continues to the north.

 There are burrows everywhere.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Desert</span>
 You were wrong: the view is terrible from here. Outside the canyon
 there is just barren, sandy wasteland, with the occasional scrubby
 plant, stretching away in all directions. There are mountains on the
 horizon, but there's no way you could survive out here long enough to
 reach them. Down to the east the oasis of the canyon is mostly hidden
 behind the terrain. There is a rise to the south, near where the land
 stops.

 You can feel irritation and peacefulness from the east.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marsh</span>
 Here in the shadow of the Mother Tree the ground is flat and wet;
 reed-like plants with white flowers grow everywhere and the air is
 musky. The river winds slowly along the east side of the marsh with
 woodlands beyond it. To the west the ground rises to what look like a
 series of sandy bluffs. The ground looks drier to the north where the
 canyon ramparts start to close in.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boulder</span>
 A massive slab of rock has fallen into the woods from the canyon walls
 to the west. It is halfway sunk into the turf and looks almost
 sculpted. The canyon wall looms over you from the west. The woodlands
 parallel it, running north-south, although the canyon steepens to the
 north. Water glints between the trees to the east.

 The huge boulder towers over the surrounding trees.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Straggly Forest</span>
 The trees here are stunted and wiry, and the steeply sloping ground is
 showing its rocky bones through the thin grass. The canyon is spread
 out below you: the lake to your east, the woodland covering the lower
 slopes, and the green dome of the Mother Tree far to the south, now
 shrunken by distance. The canyon ends not far to the north in a tumble
 of fallen rock.

 The deer walk purposefully up from the south.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scree</span>
 You are perched at the very north-west tip of the canyon, where the
 slopes disintegrate into a tangle of smashed rock. Wiry, heather-like
 grass grows between the gaps between the boulders, and there are even
 a few trees. Below to the east is a maelstrom of white water at the
 head of the river; to the south, the slope begins to flatten.

 Tiny multicoloured birds dart back and forth on the cliff face above
 you.

 The deer slowly amble towards you, from the south.

 One of the deer leans over and sniffs you. It looks very big.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cascades</span>
 The river pours out of an aperture in the northern wall of the canyon
 and tumbles down through a snarl of fallen rock before flowing into
 the lake, to the south. The noise of rushing water is everywhere. The
 eastern shore is a sheer rockface, but the western shore is a rocky
 slope that rises to meet the canyon wall in the distance. Some trees
 hug the edge of the water.

 Water pours around, through, and over the massive pile of boulders.
 There are nooks and crannies and vortices everywhere.

 The water swirling in one large rock pool in particular catches your

 You nervously crawl along the ledge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Precarious Ledge</span>

 It's not really an otter, of course; it's a quasi-mammal with the
 usual cartiligenous backbone that creatures have here. But it's got
 fur, warm blood, lives in water and eats fish, so the necessities of
 physics make it look vaguely otter-like, which means that's what

 slope that rises to meet the canyon wall in the distance. Some trees
 hug the edge of the water.

 Water pours around, through, and over the massive pile of boulders.
 There are nooks and crannies and vortices everywhere.

 The water swirling in one large rock pool in particular catches your
 eye.

 The otter follows you from the south, whiskers twitching. It waits for
 you patiently.

>go north


 You nervously crawl along the ledge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Precarious Ledge</span>
 You are balanced on a rock overhanging the north edge of the rock
 pool. The boulder is slippery from spray, and shifts under your feet
 when you move your weight giving you the feeling like it might give
 way at any moment. The narrow ledge to the south leads back to safety.

 The rock pool churns unnervingly below you.

 You can also see a bundle of aromatic leaves here.

 The otter chases you from the south onto the ledge --- which abruptly
 gives way underneath you. You, the otter, and what seems like several
 tonnes of rock drop into the water in a shocking plunge that stuns you
 for a few moments.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In The Rock Pool</span>
 From down here the sides of the pool are steeper and even less
 climbable than they were from above --- this is less of a pool and
 more of a well, and you are at the bottom of it. One of the many
 waterfalls crashes into the dark water near where you are and vortices
 in the water buffet you.

 The otter smoothly surfaces, startled.

>ride otter


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>climb otter


 The sides of the pool and sheer. There's no way out that way.

 The survey report said that rabbits can't swim. You paddle furiously
 nevertheless in the hope that you remembered incorrectly.

 The otter is getting a little puzzled.

>examine otter


 It's not really an otter, of course; it's a quasi-mammal with the
 usual cartiligenous backbone that creatures have here. But it's got
 fur, warm blood, lives in water and eats fish, so the necessities of
 physics make it look vaguely otter-like, which means that's what
 everyone on the <span class="floydstyle em">Concerto</span> calls it.

 You keep paddling, but your strength is beginning to give out.

 The otter is beginning to look disappointed.

>bite otter


 You're a rabbit. About the only thing you're capable of hurting are
 leaves.

 You're having trouble keeping your head above the surface...

 The otter gives you a look full of betrayal.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 You can feel concentration from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 You can also see a bundle of aromatic leaves here.

 The beavers bustle about, working on the dam.

 The otter follows you from the north, whiskers twitching. It is

 One of the beavers starts whittling a branch with its serrated tusks.

 The otter is beginning to look disappointed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Forest</span>
 The woodland here is quite unlike the west side of the canyon. The

 poor. Despite the gloom, the undergrowth is thick, with ferns, tall
 grasses, and less identifiable plants filling the space between the

 south as far as you can see through the trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 parallel it, running north-south, although the canyon steepens to the

 shrunken by distance. The canyon ends not far to the north in a tumble

 It takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust to the dim light.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forest Cathedral</span>
 The trees here are huge: massive columnar towers rising out of the
 soft green turf to support the dense leaf canopy above. Golden rays
 angle down between the trees, filling the vast space with dim light,
 and reflecting off the river that runs down the east side. The air
 seems permeated with peacefulness.

 Large green cocoons are attached to the bases of some of the trees.

 You emerge, blinking, into the sunlight.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marsh</span>
 Here in the shadow of the Mother Tree the ground is flat and wet;
 reed-like plants with white flowers grow everywhere and the air is
 musky. The river winds slowly along the east side of the marsh with
 woodlands beyond it. To the west the ground rises to what look like a
 series of sandy bluffs. The ground looks drier to the north where the
 canyon ramparts start to close in.

 You can feel peacefulness from the west.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Meadow</span>
 The flat river valley here isn't as wet as the marsh further south,
 and has bloomed into an astonishing wildflower meadow. The flowers are
 all strange and alien, of course, but the air is fragrant and
 peaceful. The only sound is the gentle noise of the river to the east.
 Off to the west the ground begins to rise up to meet the canyon wall,
 while forests dominate the north.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rapids</span>
 The river is narrow and rocky here, and the river churns noisily
 between the boulders. Trees come down to the water's edge on both
 sides, and twigs and dead leaves spiral dizzyingly in the vortices.
 The woods are fairly dense here and seem to go on in all directions.

 You can feel concentration from the north.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 The beavers bustle about, working on the dam.

 You can feel peacefulness from the east.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 The deer walk purposefully up from the north.

 You can feel concentration from the south.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cascades</span>
 The river pours out of an aperture in the northern wall of the canyon
 and tumbles down through a snarl of fallen rock before flowing into
 the lake, to the south. The noise of rushing water is everywhere. The
 eastern shore is a sheer rockface, but the western shore is a rocky
 slope that rises to meet the canyon wall in the distance. Some trees
 hug the edge of the water.

 Water pours around, through, and over the massive pile of boulders.
 There are nooks and crannies and vortices everywhere.

 The water swirling in one large rock pool in particular catches your
 eye.

 The fox approaches from the west. It eagerly begins to chase you.

 You can feel irritation from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Straggly Forest</span>
 The trees here are stunted and wiry, and the steeply sloping ground is
 showing its rocky bones through the thin grass. The canyon is spread
 out below you: the lake to your east, the woodland covering the lower
 slopes, and the green dome of the Mother Tree far to the south, now
 shrunken by distance. The canyon ends not far to the north in a tumble
 of fallen rock.

 The deer walk purposefully up from the east.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boulder</span>
 A massive slab of rock has fallen into the woods from the canyon walls
 to the west. It is halfway sunk into the turf and looks almost
 sculpted. The canyon wall looms over you from the west. The woodlands
 parallel it, running north-south, although the canyon steepens to the
 north. Water glints between the trees to the east.

 The huge boulder towers over the surrounding trees.

 The deer walk purposefully up from the north.

 You can feel concentration from the east.

>go up


 Dropping the bundle of aromatic leaves, you jump and scrabble wildly

 You jump down from the boulder.

 There's a brief tussle as the deer fight for the bundle of aromatic

 its mouth.

 You sense a new feeling of hunger from the north.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scree</span>
 You are perched at the very north-west tip of the canyon, where the
 slopes disintegrate into a tangle of smashed rock. Wiry, heather-like
 grass grows between the gaps between the boulders, and there are even
 a few trees. Below to the east is a maelstrom of white water at the
 head of the river; to the south, the slope begins to flatten.

 Tiny multicoloured birds dart back and forth on the cliff face above
 you.

 You almost run into the fox again. It eagerly begins to chase you.

 You can feel satisfaction from the south.

>sweep scree


 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't go that way.

 The fox pounces on you. You just have time to think <span class="floydstyle em">oh, sh---</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Open Woodland</span>
 The ground rises to meet the canyon wall to the west here, and small
 trees are scattered across the slope. There is very little
 undergrowth, lending the woods an airy, garden-like feel. The trees
 get denser to the north and east, but space opens out to the south.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rapids</span>
 The river is narrow and rocky here, and the river churns noisily

 The woods are fairly dense here and seem to go on in all directions.

 You can feel concentration from the north, and hunger from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 The beavers bustle about, working on the dam.

 You can feel peacefulness from the east.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 You can feel concentration from the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cascades</span>
 The river pours out of an aperture in the northern wall of the canyon
 and tumbles down through a snarl of fallen rock before flowing into
 the lake, to the south. The noise of rushing water is everywhere. The
 eastern shore is a sheer rockface, but the western shore is a rocky
 slope that rises to meet the canyon wall in the distance. Some trees
 hug the edge of the water.

 Water pours around, through, and over the massive pile of boulders.
 There are nooks and crannies and vortices everywhere.

 The water swirling in one large rock pool in particular catches your

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Meadow</span>
 The flat river valley here isn't as wet as the marsh further south,
 and has bloomed into an astonishing wildflower meadow. The flowers are
 all strange and alien, of course, but the air is fragrant and
 peaceful. The only sound is the gentle noise of the river to the east.
 Off to the west the ground begins to rise up to meet the canyon wall,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marsh</span>
 Here in the shadow of the Mother Tree the ground is flat and wet;
 reed-like plants with white flowers grow everywhere and the air is
 musky. The river winds slowly along the east side of the marsh with
 woodlands beyond it. To the west the ground rises to what look like a
 series of sandy bluffs. The ground looks drier to the north where the
 canyon ramparts start to close in.

 You can feel disappointment from the south, and peacefulness from the
 west.

>go south


 It takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust to the dim light.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forest Cathedral</span>
 The trees here are huge: massive columnar towers rising out of the
 soft green turf to support the dense leaf canopy above. Golden rays
 angle down between the trees, filling the vast space with dim light,
 and reflecting off the river that runs down the east side. The air
 seems permeated with peacefulness.

 Large green cocoons are attached to the bases of some of the trees.

 You were rather expecting the Mother Tree to react to the dead fish,
 but nothing happens. Maybe it's only interested in mammals?

 The otter is dithering worriedly.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warren</span>
 This little grassy hollow half-way up the side of the canyon looks
 like it's been colonised by rabbits. The tough grass-like ground
 covering has been dug away and the sandy soil underneath is full of
 burrows. Down to the east the view over the Mother Tree is
 spectacular, and you wonder what it would be like from the top; you
 can probably climb up to the west. The slope steepens and becomes
 impassably steep to the south, but the warren continues to the north.

 There are burrows everywhere.

 The ground is covered with rabbits.

 One of the rabbits is asleep on its back, legs waving in the air.

 The otter dashes off to the north.

 The woodland here is quite unlike the west side of the canyon. The
 trees are short and gnarled and look quite unhealthy: they are also
 very close together and visibilty through the tangled branches is
 poor. Despite the gloom, the undergrowth is thick, with ferns, tall
 grasses, and less identifiable plants filling the space between the
 tree trunks. The forest sweeps east up to the rock face above and
 south as far as you can see through the trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 The lemur is sitting in one of the thorny bushes.

 You can also see a bundle of aromatic leaves here.

 The lemur just stares into space for a while.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The lake nestles under the cliffs at the edge of the canyon, so that
 the east side is a sheer wall rising out of the water; but here on the
 west side the ground slopes gradually so there is a wide shore of
 pebbles and rough sand. Mats of grassy plants form little green
 islands here and there, some under the water. Beyond the beach,
 unkempt woodland rises up the west side of the canyon, while far to
 the north, at the head of the canyon, there is a distant skein of
 falling water as the river tumbles down the cliff into the lake.

 Scattered along the waterfront are some splintered fish bones.

 Over on the other side of the lake, you can see a trail of bubbles
 where the otter is swimming underwater.

 The fox approaches from the south. It eagerly begins to chase you.

 You can feel contentment from the north, hostility from the south, and
 frustration from the east.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scree</span>
 You are perched at the very north-west tip of the canyon, where the
 slopes disintegrate into a tangle of smashed rock. Wiry, heather-like
 grass grows between the gaps between the boulders, and there are even
 a few trees. Below to the east is a maelstrom of white water at the
 head of the river; to the south, the slope begins to flatten.

 Tiny multicoloured birds dart back and forth on the cliff face above
 you.

 The deer gallop up from the east with a thunder of hooves. They spend
 several moments looking around with suspicion before returning to
 their grazing.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Straggly Forest</span>
 The trees here are stunted and wiry, and the steeply sloping ground is
 showing its rocky bones through the thin grass. The canyon is spread
 out below you: the lake to your east, the woodland covering the lower
 slopes, and the green dome of the Mother Tree far to the south, now
 shrunken by distance. The canyon ends not far to the north in a tumble
 of fallen rock.

 The deer walk purposefully up from the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beaver Dam</span>
 A haphazard but substantial dam has been built across the river out of
 logs and fallen trees. Water pours through the many little gaps to
 form a delta of pools and runnels, before joining back together into
 the main flow of the river, which disappears into the woods to the
 south. Upstream of the dam to the north there is a substantial lake,
 but everywhere else, all you can see are trees. The river looks
 crossable, to reach the east side of the canyon.

 Some fish flap about in the pools.

 The deer slowly amble towards you, from the north.

 The beavers suddenly dash up towards the deer, trying to drive them
 away from the dam and the river bed.

 The beavers are confronting the deer, forming a line blocking them
 from crossing the river.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Forest</span>
 The woodland here is quite unlike the west side of the canyon. The
 trees are short and gnarled and look quite unhealthy: they are also
 very close together and visibilty through the tangled branches is
 poor. Despite the gloom, the undergrowth is thick, with ferns, tall
 grasses, and less identifiable plants filling the space between the
 tree trunks. The forest sweeps east up to the rock face above and
 south as far as you can see through the trees.

 Bushes of the thorny aromatic plant grow profusely.

 You can feel hostility and irritation from the west.

 Dropping the dead fish, you jump and scrabble wildly with your

 The fox sniffs around a bit, obviously having lost track of you, and
 then gives up trying to figure out where you've gone.

 You sense disappointment fading from the north.

 That fox is really annoying, but at least you can run faster than it
 can --- provided you keep moving it's no real danger. You're grimly
 sure that a real rabbit would have some kind of animal sense to let it
 keep a safe distance away.
