 <span class="floydstyle header">Captain Verdeterre's Plunder</span>
 An account of the wreck of the Feckless by Ryan Veeder
 Release 1 / Serial number 131003 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fore Hold</span>
 This is the foremost section of the hold, the location of the giant
 hole that the reef tore in the ship's hull. Water is gushing in at an
 alarming rate.

 The rest of the hold (and the stairs to the decks above) is aft.

 "All right," says Captain Verdeterre. "Let's round up everything
 that's worth anything and put it in that bag." He indicates a nearby
 sack, which you pick up.

 A perturbed-looking gorilla skull hangs from a hook on the wall.

 In one corner of the room is a pewter goblet.

 A thick book lies close by.

>take all

>take book


 You pick up the book.

 "Oh, just drop that," says Verdeterre. "We're looking for
 <span class="floydstyle em">treasure,</span> not mildewy <span class="floydstyle em">books.</span>"

 Now the water is lapping at your shins.

>put book in bag


 You put the thick book into the commodious sack.

 Your knees are covered by the rising waves.

 The captain smiles at the skull. "Good old Charlie! What a spirited
 guy. If I had the chance, I think I'd shoot him again."

 You stuff the gorilla skull into the sack.

 Now the water is up to your thighs.

>take cup


 "That one, for sure," says the captain. "People will pay all kinds of
 money for fancy chalices like that."

 You stuff the pewter goblet into the sack.

 You wince as the waters climb up around your hips.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aft Hold</span>
 A lot of the things kept in the hold are just ballast, but there are a

>open box


 You yank on the lid of the strongbox, but it's locked tight.

 "Oh, shoot," says Verdeterre. "I forget where I left the key. Knowing
 me, it's probably hidden extremely well. But I can't remember what was
 in there, either, so it's not a big loss."

 Now the water is up to your chest.

 The vase is overturned by the waves and lost.

 The captain strokes his tail thoughtfully.

 Roughly in the center of the space is an iron strongbox.

>examine captain


 Captain Verdeterre cuts an imposing figure, with his plumed hat and
 his snappy jacket. There are so many reasons to look up to him: his
 tactical brilliance, his dauntlessness, his self-certainty&mdash;and his
 ability to inspire the certainty of others in himself.

 You can't literally look up to him, as he's several feet shorter than
 you, but that's because he's a rat.

>examine book


 There's no title on the cover or the spine. It looks profoundly
 uninteresting.

>open book


 Taken.

 You open the book. Carved into the pages is a cavity containing a
 steel bracelet.

 "Well, how about that," says Verdeterre.

 You stretch out your neck as the waters close over your shoulders.

>take bracelet


 You stuff the steel bracelet into the sack.

 The waters have reached your chin. You're having trouble keeping your
 footing.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Deck</span>
 The lower deck is quite a bit homier than the hold, and in fact
 actually smells somewhat pleasant. The galley is fore, and the map
 room is aft.<span class="floydstyle em"> {Nautical Vocabulary Note: "Fore" and "aft" here are</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">adverbs indicating relative position, toward the prow or stern of a</span>

 main deck.

 A portrait of your captain hangs on one wall.

 Lying on the floor is a wooden doll.

 There's a large wooden crate here, because there was no room for it
 anywhere else.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>open crate


 The top of the crate is nowhere to be seen.

>take crate


 "Leave that be!" Verdeterre barks. "There's no room for any huge boxes
 on the lifeboat."

>look in crate


 In the smelly crate is a musky grey lump.

>examine lump


 It's grey and irregular, like a rock. It could almost be a rock, but
 it smells more strongly than any rock you've encountered.

>look in lump


 You find nothing of interest.

 The rising water has reached your ankles.

>get portrait


 Verdeterre sighs. "It'll be a shame to sell off an item of such
 gorgeousness and sentimentality," he says, "but I suppose these are
 desperate times."

 You stuff the captain's portrait into the sack.

 Now the water is lapping at your shins.

>get doll


 "You know," says Verdeterre, "that doll gives me an idea. Better take
 it along."

 You stuff the wooden doll into the sack.

 Your knees are covered by the rising waves.

>aft



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Miscellaneous</span>
 This was the map room originally, and then it became a kind of general
 storage space, and then it was picked almost clean by various
 deserters.

 The flag box stands nearby.

 In the center of the room is the map table; sitting on top is a
 sextant.

 There's a barrel over in the corner.

 Now the water is up to your thighs.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>look in barrel


 Trying to turn over the barrel in water this deep is an unsuccessful
 endeavor, and it rolls away on the rising waves.

 You wince as the waters climb up around your hips.

>get sextant


 "I hate those things," says the captain. "Nobody will build one that's
 small enough for us to use."

 You stuff the sextant into the sack.

 The water is up to your waist.

>get flag box


 You are unable to pick up the flag box, as it has been securely
 attached to the cabin floor. In retrospect, that wasn't a great idea.

 Now the water is up to your chest.

 The flag box is covered by water.

>open flag box


 You can't see any such thing.

 There's a large wooden crate here, because there was no room for it

 You stretch out your neck as the waters close over your shoulders.

 The crate disappears under the water, and the horrible smell starts to
 fade away.

 The captain scurries along after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Captain's Quarters</span>
 Here is where the captain sleeps, where he eats, where he does his
 deep thinking. Most of this happens in his bed. Hung on one wall is a
 shelf, set aside for the captain's favorite objects.

 A pin is sticking out of the forward bulkhead, holding up the
 handkerchief outside.

 On the captain's bed is a silk pillow.

 On the shelf are a gold medallion and an iron key.

 Your knees are underwater now.

 The rising waters swallow up the pin.

 The captain rushes ahead of you, since coming here was his idea.

>get medallion


 You give the medallion a quick once-over and ask Verdeterre, "What did
 you do to earn this?"

 "I stole it."

 You stuff the gold medallion into the sack.

 The water rises up around your thighs.

>get handkerchief


 You can't see any such thing.

>take key


 Verdeterre's eyes light up as you lift the key. "I know what that is!
 That's the key to the strongbox in the hold! I knew it was somewhere."

 Now the water reaches your hips.

 You are carrying:
   an iron key
   a false book (open but empty)

>take pillow


 You pick up the pillow.

 "Oh, no. I'm gonna miss that little guy," says Verdeterre. "I've never
 been able to get to sleep without it. But it needs to must, when
 devils drive!"

 You stuff the silk pillow into the sack.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quarterdeck</span>
 You have often stood here, at the stern of the vessel, with a steady
 hand on the ship's wheel, wondering where you were going. Right now
 you are not going anywhere.

 From here you can see the vast stretches of sea you crossed to reach
 this point&mdash;they look much like the stretches of sea you can see in
 every other direction. Downstairs is the main deck.<span class="floydstyle em"> {Nautical</span>

 A bronze statuette is lying on the boards.

 Soon the main deck will be too deep underwater for you to walk around
 on it.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>take statuette


 You stuff the bronze statuette into the sack.

 The main deck has to be under at least five feet of water now.

 For a second there, you could swear you heard music.

 The captain scurries along after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mainmast</span>
 The mainmast is lodged in the deck here, near the middle of the ship.
 It's somewhat like the ship's belly button. Fore is the capstan, aft
 are the stairs to the lower deck, and up at the top of the mainmast is
 the top.

 You're struggling to keep your head above water.

 The water closes over your head. What would your like for the final

 off without you.

 ***The return to civilization was a long one, but you both survived,
 and the long task of liquidating your assets finally began. Now,
 having dealt with numerous fences, suckers, and a few legitimate
 businessmen, you take inventory of your priceless treasures and how
 much they turned out to worth:

 A cut steel bracelet, apparently of Russian design, sold for 53
 dollars...
 The skull of an African gorilla, sold for 70 Spanish dollars to a
 credulous fellow already possessing the incomplete skeleton of an
 orangutan...
 A communion chalice lifted from some poor church somewhere, valued at
 11 dollars...
 A portrait of Captain Verdeterre, which held no value to anyone but
 Captain Verdeterre and was therefore impossible to sell...
 A Dutch peg doll which, after some modification and repainting, was
 sold as an "African fertility idol" for 36 dollars...
 An unremarkable but serviceable violin, sold for 50 dollars...
 A broken sextant, which cost 20 dollars to fix before being sold for
 68 dollars, for a total profit of 48 dollars...
 A silver locket, sold to a lovesick and desperate young man for 15
 dollars...
 A silk pillow that Captain Verdeterre could not bear to part with, and
 which he now sleeps on through most of the day...
 A medallion of mysterious provenance, sold for 68 dollars...
 A cheap reproduction of a Ptolemaic statuette of the Egyptian god
 Thoth, melted down into lead ingots worth four dollars...

 ...For a total of 355 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 22 Spanish dollars and one
 real.

 ***
 Captain Verdeterre has his chin in his paw, and his eyes are lidded in
 deep thought.

 "I think..."

 The city outside is quiet, except for the rain falling weakly against
 the windows.

 "I think we're gonna be okay. Yes. We are not going to starve to
 death."

 You finally exhale. Verdeterre opens his eyes and smiles at you.

 "Don't worry about it. You did your best, right? I feel like this is
 probably the best you could have done. So relax! Pull up a chair!"

 There is only one chair in the apartment, however, and Captain
 Verdeterre is sitting in it, so you nod politely and continue to stand
 as he curls up and drifts off to sleep.

 the top.

 The point of an exotic-looking dagger is lodged in the mast.

 A hand mirror is lying on the floor.

 The water glides over the decks and soon it is up to your ankles.

 The captain scurries along after you.

 You pick up the mirror, and Verdeterre motions for you to point it at

 say.

 He frowns. "Man, I think you're right. Wow. I shoulda been nicer."

 Your knees are underwater now.

 What a dizzying height! The shrouds reach higher, of course, but up

 A piece of brass is caught between the boards.

 A seagull is perched further out on the rigging.

 There might be about a foot of water over the main deck now.

 The captain scampers up the lines ahead of you.

 It's a miniature crown, maybe the size of a tablespoon.

 "That!" Verdeterre shrieks. "That is important. Put that in the sack.
 Do not lose that."

 You have to lean uncomfortably over the gunwale to get a good look,
 but there she is: a wooden human woman in need of a coat of paint.

 "Hey, what's that she's wearing?" asks Verdeterre.

 In fact, the figurehead is wearing very little, but Verdeterre
 indicates what seems to be a non-wooden necklace around her neck. "Go
 get that!"

 From this position you can look right in the figurehead's face. She
 seems entirely too calm, given the circumstances.

 Around her neck is a string of pearls.

 The waters continue to bury the main deck.

>get necklace


 You pull one hand free from the bowsprit to snatch up the necklace,
 and nearly lose your grip.

 "Careful down there!" Verdeterre cries. "I don't know what I'd do with
 myself if you lost any of our stuff. You should probably toss the
 necklace up to me so you don't drop it. Or I guess just put it in the
 bag."

 You stuff the pearl necklace into the sack.

 The water is too high now for you to safely hang from the bowsprit
 without drowning.

 Very, very carefully, you climb back from the bowsprit to the relative
 safety of the fo'c'sle.

 The rising water has almost reached the level of the upper decks.

 A musky grey lump, later identified as a piece of rare ambergris,
 valued at 179 dollars...
 A worthless oil lamp, sold to a theater troupe for 6 dollars...

 A cheap hand mirror, worth 12 dollars to a man who thought his soul
 was trapped inside...
 A small brass crown, which Verdeterre refused to even consider
 selling...
 A slightly chipped nautilus shell, sold to a British dandy for 49

 You finally exhale. Verdeterre opens his eyes and smiles at you.

 The flag that was underneath is striped.

 It's just a Russian flag anyway, so you toss it. The next flag in the

 navy."

 You pull out the tapestry and unfold it. It depicts a rat in clerical
 garb lying on his back, his stomach pierced by the spear of a human
 paladin. The rat's fingers are either raised in pious benediction or

 "Well, between the Human Catholic Church and the Rat Catholic Church

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fore Hold</span>
 This is the foremost section of the hold, the location of the giant
 hole that the reef tore in the ship's hull. Water is gushing in at an
 alarming rate.

 The rest of the hold (and the stairs to the decks above) is aft.

 "All right," says Captain Verdeterre. "Let's round up everything
 that's worth anything and put it in that bag." He indicates a nearby
 sack, which you pick up.

 A perturbed-looking gorilla skull hangs from a hook on the wall.

 In one corner of the room is a pewter goblet.

 Roughly in the center of the space is an iron strongbox.

 An ornate vase stands nearby.

 A crystal ball is rolling around on the floor.

 Now the water is lapping at your shins.

 The captain rushes ahead of you, since coming here was his idea.

 "Good eye. Superstitious suckers eat that kind of thing up."
 Verdeterre chuckles.

 You stuff the crystal ball into the sack.

>aft



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Miscellaneous</span>
 This was the map room originally, and then it became a kind of general
 storage space, and then it was picked almost clean by various
 deserters.

 The flag box stands nearby.

 In the center of the room is the map table; sitting on top is a
 sextant.

 There's a barrel over in the corner.

 The captain scurries along after you.

>open flag box


 You open the flag box, revealing a red and yellow flag.

>get flag


 You pull the flag out of the box and unfold it: the design is a yellow
 cross on a red field. "Whose flag is this?" you ask your captain.

 "I dunno. I think Denmark? Anyway, it's useless. Toss it."

 You nod, and throw the flag somewhere where it won't get in the way.

 The flag that was underneath is striped.

>get flag


 You unfold the striped flag to see the entire design. It's a blue
 stripe, a white stripe, a red stripe, a white stripe, and a blue
 stripe.

 "That's the Russian flag," Verdeterre explains. "You're holding it
 upside down."

 It's just a Russian flag anyway, so you toss it. The next flag in the
 box has a red X on it.

>get flag


 This flag has a red X on a white field. "That's the Swiss flag,"
 Verdeterre says, but then he stops himself: "No, wait. The Swiss flag
 is a white cross on red. So this one, I guess, is for... the Swiss
 navy."

 The captain seems put off a bit at himself, so you throw away the
 offending flag.

 At the bottom of the flag box is an old tapestry.

>get flag


 You can't see any such thing.

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Miscellaneous</span>

>get tapestry


 You pull out the tapestry and unfold it. It depicts a rat in clerical
 garb lying on his back, his stomach pierced by the spear of a human
 paladin. The rat's fingers are either raised in pious benediction or
 twisted in pain.

 "Hey, that's the Martyrdom of Saint Incertus!" says Verdeterre. "He's
 the patron saint of the pursued, I think. Too bad he's not the patron
 saint of shipwrecks. Better take it along."

 You fold it up carefully. "Why did they martyr him?" you ask.

 "Well, between the Human Catholic Church and the Rat Catholic Church
 there are some differences in the rules&mdash;such as, according to the
 human church, you're not allowed to declare yourself a saint. It's
 considered presumptuous. But we did get a tapestry out of it."

 You stuff the tapestry of Saint Incertus into the sack.

 You can worry about that later, though. Fore is the mainmast, aft is

 What a dizzying height! The shrouds reach higher, of course, but up
 here is high enough.

 A piece of brass is caught between the boards.

 A seagull is perched further out on the rigging.

 The captain scampers up the lines ahead of you.

 Your shot goes wide, but the report is enough to make the seagull drop
 its prize and fly away. The watch falls to the deck below.

 You stuff the gold watch into the sack.

 This end of the deck is home to the capstan. The crew's quarters are

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

 He says, "I kinda doubt it, but you might as well."

 The captain surveys the situation with a sober eye.

>examine figurehead


 You have to lean uncomfortably over the gunwale to get a good look,
 but there she is: a wooden human woman in need of a coat of paint.

 "Hey, what's that she's wearing?" asks Verdeterre.

 In fact, the figurehead is wearing very little, but Verdeterre
 indicates what seems to be a non-wooden necklace around her neck. "Go
 get that!"

>go down

 The only way to reach that necklace would be to climb out onto the
 bowsprit.

>clmb out onto bowsprit


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>climb out onto bowsprit


 You climb out to hang precariously from the bowsprit.

 From this position you can look right in the figurehead's face. She
 seems entirely too calm, given the circumstances.

 Around her neck is a string of pearls.

>get necklace


 You pull one hand free from the bowsprit to snatch up the necklace,
 and nearly lose your grip.

 "Careful down there!" Verdeterre cries. "I don't know what I'd do with
 myself if you lost any of our stuff. You should probably toss the
 necklace up to me so you don't drop it. Or I guess just put it in the
 bag."

 You stuff the pearl necklace into the sack.

>go up


 Very, very carefully, you climb back from the bowsprit to the relative
 safety of the fo'c'sle.

>get dagger


 You pull on the handle of the dagger, but it remains stuck in the
 mast.

 "Hey, that was Saad's, right?" Verdeterre asks. "What happened to
 him?"

 "I think you told him you were going to kill him, so he ran away," you
 say.

 He frowns. "Man, I think you're right. Wow. I shoulda been nicer."

 The water glides over the decks and soon it is up to your ankles.

>examine fid


 It's a long wooden cone with a mean-looking point.

>hit dagger with fid


 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the curved dagger.

 That's fine where it is.

 says.

 Now the water is up to your shins.

 The dagger stays stuck. Verdeterre rolls his eyes.

 Your knees are underwater now.

 The mirror disappears beneath the waves.

>take dagger


 As much as you pull, the knife won't budge. "Leave it alone, will
 you?" cries Verdeterre.

 The water rises up around your thighs.

>take dagger


 You pull again. You're almost there. You can feel the dagger's resolve
 fading.

 Now the water reaches your hips.

 ***The return to civilization was a long one, but you both survived,
 and the long task of liquidating your assets finally began. Now,
 having dealt with numerous fences, suckers, and a few legitimate
 businessmen, you take inventory of your priceless treasures and how
 much they turned out to worth:

 A cheap imitation "Chinese" vase, hocked for 9 dollars...
 A flawless crystal ball worth 60 dollars...
 A remarkably well-preserved tapestry of Saint Incertus the Audacious,
 worth 160 dollars to the monks of his order...
 A gold watch, used as bait in a grift that netted 160 dollars...
 An extremely fine pearl necklace, sold to a "Bavarian princess" for
 186 dollars...

 ...For a total of 575 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 35 Spanish dollars and 7
 reales.

 Captain Verdeterre has his chin in his paw, and his eyes are lidded in
 deep thought.

 "I think..."

 The city outside is quiet, except for the rain falling weakly against
 the windows.

 "I think we're gonna be okay. Yes. We are not going to starve to
 death."

 You finally exhale. Verdeterre opens his eyes and smiles at you.

 "Don't worry about it. You did your best, right? I feel like this is
 probably the best you could have done. So relax! Pull up a chair!"

 There is only one chair in the apartment, however, and Captain
 Verdeterre is sitting in it, so you nod politely and continue to stand
 as he curls up and drifts off to sleep.

 ***The return to civilization was a long one, but you both survived,
 and the long task of liquidating your assets finally began. Now,
 having dealt with numerous fences, suckers, and a few legitimate
 businessmen, you take inventory of your priceless treasures and how
 much they turned out to worth:

 An unremarkable but serviceable violin, sold for 50 dollars...
 A worthless oil lamp, sold to a theater troupe for 6 dollars...
 A zither, origins unknown, sold to a musical enthusiast for 40
 dollars...

 ...For a total of 96 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 6 Spanish dollars.

 Captain Verdeterre contemplates his calculations with a critical eye.
 "This is not a lot of money," he observes.

 He looks up at you. "This really is a fairly dismal amount of money.
 Which, no offense, is about what I was expecting. But, still. It'll
 take some work to get back on our feet again."

 He scampers to the window and surveys the city below. "I'm gonna need
 you to head out and recruit some seamen. I'll be up here, meditating
 on a plan to get us a new ship. You should pick up whoever you can,
 but make sure you at least try to find someone good. I'm gonna be
 needing a new first mate."

 He looks you in the eye, to make sure you got the message. "So, maybe
 you oughta get to work?"

 A portrait of your captain hangs on one wall.

 Lying on the floor is a wooden doll.

 There's a large wooden crate here, because there was no room for it
 anywhere else.

 The captain scurries along after you.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aft Hold</span>
 A lot of the things kept in the hold are just ballast, but there are a

 stairs lead up to the lower deck.

 Despite the height of the water, you can still just barely reach the
 iron strongbox.

 You're struggling to keep your head above water.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>unlock strongbox


 (with the iron key)
 You unlock the iron strongbox.

 You can barely see where you're going, squeezing your eyes to keep out
 the salt water. You need to get to higher ground.

>open it


 You open the strongbox, revealing a green glass bottle. The captain's
 eyes brighten. "Now I remember! Grab hold of that bottle before it
 sinks!"

 The water closes over your head. You might have time to do one last
 thing before you drown...

>get bottle


 You stuff the green glass bottle into the sack.

 You can't hold your breath any longer, and now water rushes into your
 mouth and nostrils. You're able to struggle for a little while, but
 it's no use.

 The Captain, as it turns out, is a fairly capable swimmer, and he
 paddles away without you.

 The tiny painting depicts a fairly respectable-looking rat. Engraved

 Verdeterre for inspection.

 "Oh, hey, I know her. Let me see that," he says, prying the locket
 from your hands. He swings it over his head and throws it as far away

 ***The return to civilization was a long one, but you both survived,
 and the long task of liquidating your assets finally began. Now,
 having dealt with numerous fences, suckers, and a few legitimate
 businessmen, you take inventory of your priceless treasures and how
 much they turned out to worth:

 The skull of an African gorilla, sold for 70 Spanish dollars to a
 credulous fellow already possessing the incomplete skeleton of an
 orangutan...
 A musky grey lump, later identified as a piece of rare ambergris,
 valued at 179 dollars...
 An unremarkable but serviceable violin, sold for 50 dollars...
 A silk handkerchief, sold for 10 dollars...
 A medallion of mysterious provenance, sold for 68 dollars...
 A slightly chipped nautilus shell, sold to a British dandy for 49
 dollars...

 ...For a total of 426 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 26 Spanish dollars and 5
 reales.

 The city outside is quiet, except for the rain falling weakly against

 "I think we're gonna be okay. Yes. We are not going to starve to
 death."

 You finally exhale. Verdeterre opens his eyes and smiles at you.

 "Don't worry about it. You did your best, right? I feel like this is
 probably the best you could have done. So relax! Pull up a chair!"

 There is only one chair in the apartment, however, and Captain

 A pin is sticking out of the forward bulkhead, holding up the
 handkerchief outside.

 On the captain's bed is a silk pillow.

 On the shelf are a gold medallion and an iron key.

 The captain rushes ahead of you, since coming here was his idea.

>get key


 Verdeterre's eyes light up as you lift the key. "I know what that is!
 That's the key to the strongbox in the hold! I knew it was somewhere."

>fore



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Deck</span>
 The sea stretches out in all directions. There is no land in sight.

 You can worry about that later, though. Fore is the mainmast, aft is
 the captain's quarters, upstairs is the quarterdeck, and downstairs is
 the lower deck.

 A silk handkerchief hangs from the aft bulkhead.

 There's a silver locket lying on the deck.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Deck</span>
 The lower deck is quite a bit homier than the hold, and in fact
 actually smells somewhat pleasant. The galley is fore, and the map
 room is aft. Stairs lead down to the hold and up to the main deck.

 A portrait of your captain hangs on one wall.

 Lying on the floor is a wooden doll.

 There's a large wooden crate here, because there was no room for it
 anywhere else.

 The captain scurries along after you.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aft Hold</span>
 A lot of the things kept in the hold are just ballast, but there are a
 few items of interest. Fore from here is the rest of the hold, and
 stairs lead up to the lower deck.

 Despite the height of the water, you can still just barely reach the
 iron strongbox.

 The water is in your mouth now.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>unlock box


 (with the iron key)
 You unlock the iron strongbox.

 You're struggling to keep your head above water.

>open box


 You open the strongbox, revealing a green glass bottle. The captain's
 eyes brighten. "Now I remember! Grab hold of that bottle before it
 sinks!"

 You can barely see where you're going, squeezing your eyes to keep out
 the salt water. You need to get to higher ground.

>get bottle


 You stuff the green glass bottle into the sack.

 The water closes over your head. You might have time to do one last
 thing before you drown...

 You stuff the wooden doll into the sack.

 don't like the looks of it."

 You hold onto it anyway.

 Your knees are covered by the rising waves.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Miscellaneous</span>
 This was the map room originally, and then it became a kind of general
 storage space, and then it was picked almost clean by various
 deserters.

 The flag box stands nearby.

 In the center of the room is the map table; sitting on top is a
 sextant.

 There's a barrel over in the corner.

 Now the water is up to your thighs.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>get sextant


 "I hate those things," says the captain. "Nobody will build one that's
 small enough for us to use."

 You stuff the sextant into the sack.

 You wince as the waters climb up around your hips.

>open flagbox


 You open the flag box, revealing a red and yellow flag.

 The water is up to your waist.

 The waves lift the barrel off the floor, and it rolls away.

>get flag


 You pull the flag out of the box and unfold it: the design is a yellow
 cross on a red field. "Whose flag is this?" you ask your captain.

 "I dunno. I think Denmark? Anyway, it's useless. Toss it."

 You nod, and throw the flag somewhere where it won't get in the way.

 The flag that was underneath is striped.

 Now the water is up to your chest.

 The flag box is covered by water.

 Now the water is up to your thighs.

>get flag


 You unfold the striped flag to see the entire design. It's a blue
 stripe, a white stripe, a red stripe, a white stripe, and a blue
 stripe.

 "That's the Russian flag," Verdeterre explains. "You're holding it
 upside down."

 It's just a Russian flag anyway, so you toss it. The next flag in the
 box has a red X on it.

 You wince as the waters climb up around your hips.

>get flag


 This flag has a red X on a white field. "That's the Swiss flag,"
 Verdeterre says, but then he stops himself: "No, wait. The Swiss flag
 is a white cross on red. So this one, I guess, is for... the Swiss
 navy."

 The captain seems put off a bit at himself, so you throw away the
 offending flag.

 At the bottom of the flag box is an old tapestry.

 The water is up to your waist.

 The waves lift the barrel off the floor, and it rolls away.

>get tapestry


 You pull out the tapestry and unfold it. It depicts a rat in clerical
 garb lying on his back, his stomach pierced by the spear of a human
 paladin. The rat's fingers are either raised in pious benediction or
 twisted in pain.

 "Hey, that's the Martyrdom of Saint Incertus!" says Verdeterre. "He's
 the patron saint of the pursued, I think. Too bad he's not the patron
 saint of shipwrecks. Better take it along."

 You fold it up carefully. "Why did they martyr him?" you ask.

 "Well, between the Human Catholic Church and the Rat Catholic Church
 there are some differences in the rules&mdash;such as, according to the
 human church, you're not allowed to declare yourself a saint. It's
 considered presumptuous. But we did get a tapestry out of it."

 You stuff the tapestry of Saint Incertus into the sack.

 Now the water is up to your chest.

 The flag box is covered by water.

 get that!"

>take necklace


 The only way to reach that necklace would be to climb out onto the
 bowsprit.

>climb bowsprit


 You climb out to hang precariously from the bowsprit.

 From this position you can look right in the figurehead's face. She
 seems entirely too calm, given the circumstances.

 Around her neck is a string of pearls.

 You notice that the waters have just crested over the main deck.

>take necklace


 You pull one hand free from the bowsprit to snatch up the necklace,
 and nearly lose your grip.

 "Careful down there!" Verdeterre cries. "I don't know what I'd do with
 myself if you lost any of our stuff. You should probably toss the
 necklace up to me so you don't drop it. Or I guess just put it in the
 bag."

 You stuff the pearl necklace into the sack.

 The water continues to rise down on the main deck.

>go down


 Very, very carefully, you climb back from the bowsprit to the relative
 safety of the fo'c'sle.

 The main deck keeps on sinking.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Capstan</span>
 This end of the deck is home to the capstan. The crew's quarters are
 fore and the mainmast is aft. Up a short flight of stairs is the
 fo'c'sle.

 Your life boat is hanging from the davits here.

 The water rises up around your thighs.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>get in boat

 Are you sure you want to abandon ship? [y/n]

 You shove off with all due haste.

 ***The return to civilization was a long one, but you both survived,
 and the long task of liquidating your assets finally began. Now,
 having dealt with numerous fences, suckers, and a few legitimate
 businessmen, you take inventory of your priceless treasures and how
 much they turned out to worth:

 A musky grey lump, later identified as a piece of rare ambergris,
 valued at 179 dollars...
 A silk handkerchief, sold for 10 dollars...
 A silver locket, sold to a lovesick and desperate young man for 15
 dollars...
 A Yemeni <span class="floydstyle em">jambiya,</span> with a handle of rhinoceros horn, worth 276
 dollars...
 A cheap hand mirror, worth 12 dollars to a man who thought his soul
 was trapped inside...
 A medallion of mysterious provenance, sold for 68 dollars...
 A cheap reproduction of a Ptolemaic statuette of the Egyptian god
 Thoth, melted down into lead ingots worth four dollars...
 An extremely fine pearl necklace, sold to a "Bavarian princess" for
 186 dollars...

 ...For a total of 750 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 46 Spanish dollars and 7
 reales.

 You and the Captain have both indulged in new coats, and the two of
 you draw many a glance as you stride down the street.

 "Really, I think we can take some time off," Verdeterre says. "We've
 got cash to live on for a good while, and something new will come up
 before we run out. Opportunities are constantly presenting themselves
 to me."

 He looks up at you approvingly. "Like you. I didn't have to hire you,

 doubt you could have done any better," he says, "and I really mean

 "All right," says Captain Verdeterre. "Let's round up everything

 In one corner of the room is a pewter goblet.

 In lieu of an actual map, some vague charts have been carved on the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fore Hold</span>
 This is the foremost section of the hold, the location of the giant
 hole that the reef tore in the ship's hull. Water is gushing in at an
 alarming rate.

 The rest of the hold (and the stairs to the decks above) is aft.

 "All right," says Captain Verdeterre. "Let's round up everything
 that's worth anything and put it in that bag." He indicates a nearby
 sack, which you pick up.

 A perturbed-looking gorilla skull hangs from a hook on the wall.

 In one corner of the room is a pewter goblet.

 A thick book lies close by.

>examine hole


 You would have thought the hull was too strong to be busted up so much
 by a reef, but on the other hand you did hit that reef pretty hard.

>examine reef


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine water


 The water flowing in around you is clouded with filth from down in the
 bilge and from decks that haven't been swabbed in months.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a commodious sack (empty)
   a flintlock pistol

>examine captain


 Captain Verdeterre cuts an imposing figure, with his plumed hat and
 his snappy jacket. There are so many reasons to look up to him: his
 tactical brilliance, his dauntlessness, his self-certainty&mdash;and his
 ability to inspire the certainty of others in himself.

 You can't literally look up to him, as he's several feet shorter than
 you, but that's because he's a rat.

>take rat


 I don't suppose Captain Verdeterre would care for that.

 Captain Verdeterre looks up at you. The fires of Hell are burning in
 his eyes.

 "My arms are too short to hold the oars," he hisses, "so you're going
 to do the rowing. But when we get to dry land..."

 He takes a deep breath. You grab the oars.

 "...When we get to dry land, I am honestly, seriously, literally going

 You nod and continue rowing as the <span class="floydstyle em">Feckless</span> slips beneath the

 your gratitude that it's a very fine prize.

 too fine. Yes, you'd better put it in with the other loot so we can
 sell it later. Good idea."

 Verdeterre looks on with interest as you struggle to undo the locket's
 tiny clasp, and when you finally get it open he asks, "Who's the
 picture of?"

 The tiny painting depicts a fairly respectable-looking rat. Engraved
 inside the cover is the name "Etienne". You turn the interior toward
 Verdeterre for inspection.

 "Oh, hey, I know her. Let me see that," he says, prying the locket
 from your hands. He swings it over his head and throws it as far away

 This room used to be the domain of Blaise, the ship's cook. Now the

 The cabinet's door won't budge. It's locked.


 Verdeterre rolls his eyes. "Yeah, I have no idea where the key is.
 Just forget about it."

 "Good idea!" Verdeterre shouts, as he gets out of the way. You blast
 away the lock, and the cabinet door falls open.

>look in cabinet


 In the cabinet are a porcelain plate and a pile of silverware.

 "Where did that come from?" Verdeterre mumbles. "Do you think Blaise
 was holding out on us?"

 You stuff the porcelain plate into the sack.

 In the smelly crate is a musky grey lump.

 Now the water is lapping at your shins.

 You hold onto it anyway.

 A silk handkerchief hangs from the aft bulkhead.

 There's a silver locket lying on the deck.

 handkerchief outside.

 On the captain's bed is a silk pillow.

 On the shelf are a gold medallion and an iron key.

 The captain scurries along after you.

 You give the medallion a quick once-over and ask Verdeterre, "What did
 you do to earn this?"

 "I stole it."

 You stuff the gold medallion into the sack.

 You rub the silk between your fingers, and remark by way of expressing
 your gratitude that it's a very fine prize.

 The captain nods. "You're right about that. Actually, it's probably
 too fine. Yes, you'd better put it in with the other loot so we can
 sell it later. Good idea."

 You stuff the silk handkerchief into the sack.

 ***The return to civilization was a long one, but you both survived,
 and the long task of liquidating your assets finally began. Now,
 having dealt with numerous fences, suckers, and a few legitimate
 businessmen, you take inventory of your priceless treasures and how
 much they turned out to worth:

 A Dutch peg doll which, after some modification and repainting, was
 sold as an "African fertility idol" for 36 dollars...
 A musky grey lump, later identified as a piece of rare ambergris,
 valued at 179 dollars...
 An unremarkable but serviceable violin, sold for 50 dollars...
 A plate of fine Japanese porcelain, sold to a heron enthusiast for 160
 dollars...
 An incomplete set of Verlaine silver worth 90 dollars...
 A silk handkerchief, sold for 10 dollars...
 A silver locket, sold to a lovesick and desperate young man for 15

 A medallion of mysterious provenance, sold for 68 dollars...

 ...For a total of 608 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 38 Spanish dollars.

 "Really, I think we can take some time off," Verdeterre says. "We've

 before we run out. Opportunities are constantly presenting themselves
 to me."

 He looks up at you approvingly. "Like you. I didn't have to hire you,

 "Oh, shoot," says Verdeterre. "I forget where I left the key. Knowing
 me, it's probably hidden extremely well. But I can't remember what was
 in there, either, so it's not a big loss."

 You unlock the iron strongbox.

 You open the strongbox, revealing a green glass bottle. The captain's
 eyes brighten. "Now I remember! Grab hold of that bottle before it
 sinks!"

 You can't hold your breath any longer, and now water rushes into your
 mouth and nostrils. You're able to struggle for a little while, but
 it's no use.

 The Captain, as it turns out, is a fairly capable swimmer, and he
 paddles away without you.

 The rest of the hold (and the stairs to the decks above) is aft.

 "All right," says Captain Verdeterre. "Let's round up everything

 A perturbed-looking gorilla skull hangs from a hook on the wall.

 In one corner of the room is a pewter goblet.

 The lower deck is quite a bit homier than the hold, and in fact

 Lying on the floor is a wooden doll.

 There's a large wooden crate here, because there was no room for it

 You pull the flag out of the box and unfold it: the design is a yellow
 cross on a red field. "Whose flag is this?" you ask your captain.

 "I dunno. I think Denmark? Anyway, it's useless. Toss it."

 You nod, and throw the flag somewhere where it won't get in the way.

 The flag that was underneath is striped.

>again


 You unfold the striped flag to see the entire design. It's a blue
 stripe, a white stripe, a red stripe, a white stripe, and a blue
 stripe.

 "That's the Russian flag," Verdeterre explains. "You're holding it
 upside down."

 It's just a Russian flag anyway, so you toss it. The next flag in the
 box has a red X on it.

>again


 This flag has a red X on a white field. "That's the Swiss flag,"
 Verdeterre says, but then he stops himself: "No, wait. The Swiss flag
 is a white cross on red. So this one, I guess, is for... the Swiss
 navy."

 The captain seems put off a bit at himself, so you throw away the
 offending flag.

 At the bottom of the flag box is an old tapestry.

>take tapestry


 You pull out the tapestry and unfold it. It depicts a rat in clerical
 garb lying on his back, his stomach pierced by the spear of a human
 paladin. The rat's fingers are either raised in pious benediction or
 twisted in pain.

 "Hey, that's the Martyrdom of Saint Incertus!" says Verdeterre. "He's
 the patron saint of the pursued, I think. Too bad he's not the patron
 saint of shipwrecks. Better take it along."

 You fold it up carefully. "Why did they martyr him?" you ask.

 "Well, between the Human Catholic Church and the Rat Catholic Church
 there are some differences in the rules&mdash;such as, according to the
 human church, you're not allowed to declare yourself a saint. It's
 considered presumptuous. But we did get a tapestry out of it."

 You stuff the tapestry of Saint Incertus into the sack.

 The rising water has reached your ankles.

 You stuff the porcelain plate into the sack.

 A pin is sticking out of the forward bulkhead, holding up the
 handkerchief outside.

 On the captain's bed is a silk pillow.

 On the shelf are a gold medallion and an iron key.

 The captain scurries along after you.

 You give the medallion a quick once-over and ask Verdeterre, "What did

 "That's a nautilus," Verdeterre explains. "You oughta see one when the

 From this position you can look right in the figurehead's face. She
 seems entirely too calm, given the circumstances.

 Around her neck is a string of pearls.

 There might be about a foot of water over the main deck now.

>take necklace


 You pull one hand free from the bowsprit to snatch up the necklace,
 and nearly lose your grip.

 "Careful down there!" Verdeterre cries. "I don't know what I'd do with
 myself if you lost any of our stuff. You should probably toss the
 necklace up to me so you don't drop it. Or I guess just put it in the

 You stuff the pearl necklace into the sack.

 The skull of an African gorilla, sold for 70 Spanish dollars to a
 credulous fellow already possessing the incomplete skeleton of an
 orangutan...
 A flawless crystal ball worth 60 dollars...
 A musky grey lump, later identified as a piece of rare ambergris,
 valued at 179 dollars...
 An unremarkable but serviceable violin, sold for 50 dollars...
 A plate of fine Japanese porcelain, sold to a heron enthusiast for 160

 An incomplete set of Verlaine silver worth 90 dollars...
 A remarkably well-preserved tapestry of Saint Incertus the Audacious,
 worth 160 dollars to the monks of his order...
 A medallion of mysterious provenance, sold for 68 dollars...
 An ivory chessboard worth 28 dollars...
 A slightly chipped nautilus shell, sold to a British dandy for 49
 dollars...
 An extremely fine pearl necklace, sold to a "Bavarian princess" for
 186 dollars...

 ...For a total of 1100 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 68 Spanish dollars and 6

 Captain Verdeterre closes his eyes and sighs loudly as he rolls around
 in his pile of coins. "We made it," he sighs. "They said we'd never
 make it, but we showed them. We absolutely made it."

 "Who's they?" you ask.

 "Shut up," Verdeterre snaps. But then his eyes open, and he scurries
 over to you with an unfamiliar expression on his face.

 "I'm sorry," he says. "I shouldn't have yelled at you like that. I owe
 all of this to you. I owe a lot of it to you, anyway. But I've never
 thanked you."

 He touches your hand with his paw. "Thank you, Tibert. Thank you for

 other jerk I ever hired did. And thank you for making me so incredibly

 You can't think of anything to say. Verdeterre turns around to survey

 the salt water. You need to get to higher ground.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Deck</span>
 The lower deck is quite a bit homier than the hold, and in fact
 actually smells somewhat pleasant. The galley is fore, and the map
 room is aft. Stairs lead down to the hold and up to the main deck.

 A portrait of your captain hangs on one wall.

 Lying on the floor is a wooden doll.

 There's a large wooden crate here, because there was no room for it
 anywhere else.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Miscellaneous</span>
 This was the map room originally, and then it became a kind of general
 storage space, and then it was picked almost clean by various
 deserters.

 The flag box stands nearby.

 In the center of the room is the map table; sitting on top is a
 sextant.

 There's a barrel over in the corner.

 The rising water has reached your ankles.

 The captain rushes ahead of you, since coming here was his idea.

>open box


 You open the flag box, revealing a red and yellow flag.

 Now the water is lapping at your shins.

>take flag


 You pull the flag out of the box and unfold it: the design is a yellow
 cross on a red field. "Whose flag is this?" you ask your captain.

 "I dunno. I think Denmark? Anyway, it's useless. Toss it."

 You nod, and throw the flag somewhere where it won't get in the way.

 The flag that was underneath is striped.

 Your knees are covered by the rising waves.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Galley</span>
 This room used to be the domain of Blaise, the ship's cook. Now the
 cabinets are empty, and the room is in a state of rapidly sinking
 disrepair.

 On top of one cabinet is a piece of hardtack.

 Hanging on the wall is an old violin.

 The rising water has reached your ankles.

 The captain rushes ahead of you, since coming here was his idea.

>shoot cabinet


 "Good idea!" Verdeterre shouts, as he gets out of the way. You blast
 away the lock, and the cabinet door falls open.

 Now the water is lapping at your shins.

>take plate


 "Where did that come from?" Verdeterre mumbles. "Do you think Blaise
 was holding out on us?"

 You stuff the porcelain plate into the sack.

 Your knees are covered by the rising waves.

>take silverware


 Verdeterre nods in approval as you struggle to pick up every fork,
 knife, and spoon. For him to assist in any way would be
 unprofessional.

 You stuff the pile of silverware into the sack.

 Now the water is up to your thighs.

>take violin


 "Sure was nice of Blaise to leave that behind for us," Verdeterre
 sniggers.

 You stuff the violin into the sack.

 You wince as the waters climb up around your hips.

 The water is up to your waist.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>take ambergris


 Captain Verdeterre wrinkles his nose. "What on earth is that thing? I
 don't like the looks of it."

 You hold onto it anyway.

 Now the water is up to your chest.

>take doll


 You can't see any such thing.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Deck</span>
 The sea stretches out in all directions. There is no land in sight.

 You can worry about that later, though. Fore is the mainmast, aft is
 the captain's quarters, upstairs is the quarterdeck, and downstairs is
 the lower deck.

 A silk handkerchief hangs from the aft bulkhead.

 There's a silver locket lying on the deck.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>a



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Captain's Quarters</span>
 Here is where the captain sleeps, where he eats, where he does his
 deep thinking. Most of this happens in his bed. Hung on one wall is a
 shelf, set aside for the captain's favorite objects.

 A pin is sticking out of the forward bulkhead, holding up the
 handkerchief outside.

 On the captain's bed is a silk pillow.

 On the shelf is a gold medallion.

 The captain scurries along after you.

>take medallion


 You give the medallion a quick once-over and ask Verdeterre, "What did
 you do to earn this?"

 "I stole it."

 You stuff the gold medallion into the sack.

>look under bed


 You stoop down to check under the captain's bed, and turn up a curvy
 shell, bigger than your hand.

 "That's a nautilus," Verdeterre explains. "You oughta see one when the
 squishy part is still inside. It's a sight that'd keep you up at
 night, let me tell you. Anyway, let's try and sell it."

 You stuff the nautilus shell into the sack.

 It's somewhat like the ship's belly button. Fore is the capstan, aft

 the top.

 The point of an exotic-looking dagger is lodged in the mast.

 A hand mirror is lying on the floor.

 The captain scurries along after you.

 You pull on the handle of the dagger, but it remains stuck in the

 "I think you told him you were going to kill him, so he ran away," you
 say.

 Your knees are underwater now.

 You climb out to hang precariously from the bowsprit.

 From this position you can look right in the figurehead's face. She
 seems entirely too calm, given the circumstances.

 Around her neck is a string of pearls.

 The deck below is still sinking.

>take necklace


 You pull one hand free from the bowsprit to snatch up the necklace,
 and nearly lose your grip.

 "Careful down there!" Verdeterre cries. "I don't know what I'd do with
 myself if you lost any of our stuff. You should probably toss the
 necklace up to me so you don't drop it. Or I guess just put it in the
 bag."

 You stuff the pearl necklace into the sack.

 By now the main deck is under about three feet of water.

>go down


 Very, very carefully, you climb back from the bowsprit to the relative
 safety of the fo'c'sle.

 The sea continues to bury the main deck, inching its way toward you.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Capstan</span>
 This end of the deck is home to the capstan. The crew's quarters are

 ***The return to civilization was a long one, but you both survived,
 and the long task of liquidating your assets finally began. Now,
 having dealt with numerous fences, suckers, and a few legitimate
 businessmen, you take inventory of your priceless treasures and how
 much they turned out to worth:

 A bottle of apparently very rare wine from the obscure Pr&eacute;venge
 region, sold for 220 dollars...
 A musky grey lump, later identified as a piece of rare ambergris,
 valued at 179 dollars...
 An unremarkable but serviceable violin, sold for 50 dollars...
 A plate of fine Japanese porcelain, sold to a heron enthusiast for 160
 dollars...
 An incomplete set of Verlaine silver worth 90 dollars...
 A Yemeni <span class="floydstyle em">jambiya,</span> with a handle of rhinoceros horn, worth 276
 dollars...
 A medallion of mysterious provenance, sold for 68 dollars...
 A slightly chipped nautilus shell, sold to a British dandy for 49
 dollars...
 An extremely fine pearl necklace, sold to a "Bavarian princess" for
 186 dollars...

 ...For a total of 1278 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 79 Spanish dollars and 7
 reales.

 Captain Verdeterre closes his eyes and sighs loudly as he rolls around
 in his pile of coins. "We made it," he sighs. "They said we'd never
 make it, but we showed them. We absolutely made it."

 "Who's they?" you ask.

 "Shut up," Verdeterre snaps. But then his eyes open, and he scurries
 over to you with an unfamiliar expression on his face.

 "I'm sorry," he says. "I shouldn't have yelled at you like that. I owe
 all of this to you. I owe a lot of it to you, anyway. But I've never
 thanked you."

 He touches your hand with his paw. "Thank you, Tibert. Thank you for
 joining my crew. Thank you for not abandoning me like every single
 other jerk I ever hired did. And thank you for making me so incredibly
 rich."

 You can't think of anything to say. Verdeterre turns around to survey
 his money again.

 "Yeah. Yes," he says. "I am going to buy a polar bear."

 "I know what you're thinking, lad. And you're right, this is all your

 The captain makes a pained clicking noise. "You did your best, and it
 wasn't good enough. All we can do now is make the best of a bad

 He allows himself a moment of silence. Then he fixes you with a beady
 black eye:

 ***The return to civilization was a long one, but you both survived,
 and the long task of liquidating your assets finally began. Now,
 having dealt with numerous fences, suckers, and a few legitimate
 businessmen, you take inventory of your priceless treasures and how
 much they turned out to worth:

 The skull of an African gorilla, sold for 70 Spanish dollars to a
 credulous fellow already possessing the incomplete skeleton of an
 orangutan...
 A flawless crystal ball worth 60 dollars...
 A musky grey lump, later identified as a piece of rare ambergris,
 valued at 179 dollars...
 A cheap reproduction of a Ptolemaic statuette of the Egyptian god
 Thoth, melted down into lead ingots worth four dollars...
 An extraordinary Genevese music box worth 300 dollars...

 ...For a total of 613 Spanish dollars.

 The first mate's share of that came to 38 Spanish dollars and 2
 reales.

 ***
 You and the Captain have both indulged in new coats, and the two of
 you draw many a glance as you stride down the street.

 "Really, I think we can take some time off," Verdeterre says. "We've
 got cash to live on for a good while, and something new will come up
 before we run out. Opportunities are constantly presenting themselves
 to me."

 He looks up at you approvingly. "Like you. I didn't have to hire you,
 but I did, and it seems to have worked out pretty okay." He smiles. "I
 doubt you could have done any better," he says, "and I really mean
 that."

 This is the foremost section of the hold, the location of the giant
 hole that the reef tore in the ship's hull. Water is gushing in at an
 alarming rate.

 The rest of the hold (and the stairs to the decks above) is aft.

 "All right," says Captain Verdeterre. "Let's round up everything
 that's worth anything and put it in that bag." He indicates a nearby
 sack, which you pick up.

 A perturbed-looking gorilla skull hangs from a hook on the wall.

 In one corner of the room is a pewter goblet.

 A thick book lies close by.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Miscellaneous</span>
 This was the map room originally, and then it became a kind of general
 storage space, and then it was picked almost clean by various
 deserters.

 The flag box stands nearby.

 In the center of the room is the map table; sitting on top is a
 sextant.

 There's a barrel over in the corner.

 The captain darts ahead to take stock of the situation.

>open box


 You open the flag box, revealing a red and yellow flag.

>take flag


 You pull the flag out of the box and unfold it: the design is a yellow
 cross on a red field. "Whose flag is this?" you ask your captain.

 "I dunno. I think Denmark? Anyway, it's useless. Toss it."

 You nod, and throw the flag somewhere where it won't get in the way.

 The flag that was underneath is striped.

>again


 You unfold the striped flag to see the entire design. It's a blue
 stripe, a white stripe, a red stripe, a white stripe, and a blue
 stripe.

 "That's the Russian flag," Verdeterre explains. "You're holding it
 upside down."

 It's just a Russian flag anyway, so you toss it. The next flag in the
 box has a red X on it.

>again


 This flag has a red X on a white field. "That's the Swiss flag,"
 Verdeterre says, but then he stops himself: "No, wait. The Swiss flag
 is a white cross on red. So this one, I guess, is for... the Swiss
 navy."

 The captain seems put off a bit at himself, so you throw away the
 offending flag.

 At the bottom of the flag box is an old tapestry.

>take tapestry


 You pull out the tapestry and unfold it. It depicts a rat in clerical
 garb lying on his back, his stomach pierced by the spear of a human
 paladin. The rat's fingers are either raised in pious benediction or
 twisted in pain.

 "Hey, that's the Martyrdom of Saint Incertus!" says Verdeterre. "He's
 the patron saint of the pursued, I think. Too bad he's not the patron
 saint of shipwrecks. Better take it along."

 You fold it up carefully. "Why did they martyr him?" you ask.

 "Well, between the Human Catholic Church and the Rat Catholic Church
 there are some differences in the rules—such as, according to the
 human church, you're not allowed to declare yourself a saint. It's
 considered presumptuous. But we did get a tapestry out of it."

 You stuff the tapestry of Saint Incertus into the sack.

 Here is where the captain sleeps, where he eats, where he does his
 deep thinking. Most of this happens in his bed. Hung on one wall is a
 shelf, set aside for the captain's favorite objects.

 A pin is sticking out of the forward bulkhead, holding up the
 handkerchief outside.

 On the captain's bed is a silk pillow.

 On the shelf are a gold medallion and an iron key.

 The captain scurries along after you.

 You give the medallion a quick once-over and ask Verdeterre, "What did
 you do to earn this?"

 "I stole it."

 You stuff the gold medallion into the sack.

 You stoop down to check under the captain's bed, and turn up a curvy
 shell, bigger than your hand.

 "That's a nautilus," Verdeterre explains. "You oughta see one when the
 squishy part is still inside. It's a sight that'd keep you up at
 night, let me tell you. Anyway, let's try and sell it."

 You pull on the handle of the dagger, but it remains stuck in the

 "Hey, that was Saad's, right?" Verdeterre asks. "What happened to

 "I think you told him you were going to kill him, so he ran away," you
 say.

 He frowns. "Man, I think you're right. Wow. I shoulda been nicer."

 Now the water reaches your hips.

 Rifling through your old crewmates" hammocks, you find something
