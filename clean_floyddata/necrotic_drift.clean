 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 My dad came home late one night when I was nine and threw an old copy
 of the Monster Manual by Gary Gygax onto my bed. He woke me up,
 stressed and shaking at the humiliation his friends had put him
 through earlier that evening.

 He asked me if I wanted the book. I was still groggy, but I picked it
 up and thumbed through it. "We didn't play Monopoly tonight, Jarret,"
 he told me. "That's because not a one of them can beat me. Instead,
 they brought out this... thing. Some 'game of the imagination'." He
 practically spat that last word. "You can move all you like without
 throwing any dice, but to actually do anything, you need to throw a
 handful!!" I was both reading entries on the different monsters and
 paying half-attention to his rant. "Five minutes in, Benson tells me
 that I come across something called a gorgon. That got me stoned. Why
 would I play a game that depicted the recreational use of marijuana
 cigarettes? I got up and left."

 "They let you read this during play?" I asked him. He nodded. I turned
 to page 49. "I don't think they were supposed to. It says right here
 that the gorgon can turn you to stone. It doesn't get you stoned. And
 right here are all its weaknesses! How did you not see this? Are you
 stupid or something? Or what?"

 My father snatched back the Monster Manual. He didn't state that what
 he was going to do was going to hurt him more than it hurt me. (I
 think all he did say was that he should have left his 'patented Duffy
 blast' on my mother's face the night I was conceived, which didn't
 make a whole lot of sense to me then.) He instead just quietly gave me
 a spanking for back talk. But as that 112 page reference to a modern
 mythology of villainy struck my bony behind, it was as if he were
 bonding the pages and me for all time. Like directed osmosis through
 anger or something.

 (Okay, it actually wasn't like osmosis at all, but I've sacrificed
 knowledge in basic chemistry for additional levels in Modern
 Mythology, so please cut me some slack on the occasional analogy
 outside of my experience.)

 In the week that followed, my father tried to ban Dungeons & Dragons
 from the house as he had previously banned video games, cursing, Cajun
 food and music recorded after 1959. I stood up to him on D&D, though,
 and he caved for the only time in my childhood. Within a week I was
 running my own games for the kids in my tract. We were creating
 adventures together with Devils, Demons and Dragons and it was one of
 the best times of my life. My old man may have never been on the short
 list for an award from the PTA, but his maniac antics did a better job
 helping me understand just what I was interested in than the fathers
 of anyone else I grew up with. And heck, he did have my back that one
 time I met D&D creator Gary Gygax himself at DragonCon and started
 kicking him in his bag of magic beans (if you're digging my ditch
 here) in misplaced, latent vengeance due to how hard the board stock
 was for those manual covers.

 I don't think you've truly bonded with your father until you've spent
 36 consecutive hours in a holding cell mocking and taunting an inmate
 set consisting of multiple thirty-somethings decked out in homemade
 hobbit, fairie and chocobo costumes, where the only thing the lot of
 them had in common, aside from a complete lack of human dignity, was
 relating how difficult it was to sleep late when the sump pump went
 off.

 Release 1.03 / Serial number 040623 / Hugo 3.1

 I'm here this evening at an Academy Videos store thirty-five minutes
 from my home with two of my roommates and my best friend. We have to
 come all the way down here to rent because of the late fees on my
 memberships at all the video places back in the Fort. I wish I had a
 good story for why that is the case, but I don't. I'm just poor and
 had the first Lord of the Rings movie overdue for more than two weeks
 at multiple video chains. I kept it around to mainly prove trivia. (It
 will probably end up costing me more to show my friends that the elf
 character Legolas was walking on, and not in the snow, than it did for
 director Peter Jackson to implement that effect on-screen.)

 Supposedly, Audrey is dropping by tonight to watch a movie, which is
 why I'm even here to begin with. In the five years we've been together
 we've dumped each other a total of nine times. She is currently ahead
 of me six to three. Her most shallow dumping was when she wanted to
 exclusively hang around a hardcore goth guy who had somehow managed to
 finance or lease his own cemetery plot. That guy was the black
 fingernail Alpha male until he missed his first payment. To be fair,
 mine was when she filled out Student Loan paperwork for me without my
 knowledge or consent and almost enrolled me into classes at the nearby
 University of Central Hill. She doesn't like the fact that I work at
 the Funtime Teen Mall for $5.51 an hour at age 27.

 I have to work later tonight, so I guess I'd better pick something and
 get out of here quickly.

 What?

 <span class="floydstyle em">Academy Videos</span>
 The inside of the video store looks like it was slapped together in a
 weekend by enslaved, tool-wielding howler monkeys and routinely
 cleaned by an anosmic with all the enthusiasm of a man who lost a bet.
 Rotting floorboards create a random topography that would put the
 landshifts and valleys of the legendary Umar Hills to shame. Faded
 posters cover much of the surface area of the walls, and a few of them
 have begun peeling or been stricken with graffiti.

 All the available movies have been shoved into racks labeled with one
 of four categories: Action, Drama, Fantasy and Horror. Alphabetical
 order isn't implemented in any of them either, so trying to find a
 specific movie is often futile. It's usually best just to look along
 the racks and hope something good catches your eye.
 Gibs, Pang, Criswell, and the clerk are here.

 "So..." says Gibs, as he scans the movies half-heartedly, "You and
 Audrey are on the rocks again, eh, Duffy? What happened this time, did
 she get you enrolled into MIT?"

>examine action

 It's constructed from a cheap wood board, and sags quite a bit due to
 the number of movies placed within it.

 Inside the action rack is a movie from action rack.

 Pang clears his throat and holds up a copy of <span class="floydstyle em">Blade</span>. "I have
 found the movie for us all tonight," he states, with an annoying
 authority. "It has electronica and vampires, as all classics should."

 "<span class="floydstyle em">Blade?</span>" screeches Criswell. He's another one of my
 roommates. "They merged techno music and goths for that one. No
 chance. No way. And if you pick out one that merges country music with
 the French art film or opera with a Pixar kiddie flick I will drop
 trou and take a crap on the TV while it's playing."

 Criswell's only half joking, as he's demonstrated his willingness to
 do that before. When his favorite CFL football team lost in the finals
 last year he was so pissed off at the TV for depicting it that he
 grabbed a chair from the kitchen, got up and plopped a steaming load
 on top of the set. Worse, it was two weeks before anyone cleaned it
 up. We had a veritable bumper crop of flies around the house that
 year.

>take action movie

 I grab a movie from the rack. And behold! It's <span class="floydstyle em">The Lord of the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Rings.</span> Why on earth the dip behind the counter would deign to
 keep it in <span class="floydstyle em">this</span> rack is beyond my comprehension. But it
 doesn't matter. I don't really possess the discipline to go get
 something else.

 "OK, I'm set," says Criswell. "<span class="floydstyle em">Truman Show</span>. Jim Carrey is the
 funniest man alive. This'll be a <span class="floydstyle em">gem</span>. Hey, Duffy, you
 bringin' that chick you hang around with over tonight? Well, thank me
 later, man, 'cos she'll be all out of giggles by the time you pull off
 your pants. For once, anyway."

 Barnaby idly toys with a movie and then puts it back on the shelf.
 "There were some real hotties at that Bead Store, the other day," he
 says to me. "Cute, but not so cute that they would have nothing to do
 with you, I mean."

>examine lord of the rings

 I haven't seen anything like that.

>examine video

 The clerk at Academy Videos is famous through New Haz for being one of
 its most smug and sarcastic citizens. He will always criticize a
 customer's movie choice unless it's one of the ten or fifteen films
 that he thinks are classic. He is wearing a hypercolor shirt like all
 employees in the chain, as well as a pair of dirty sweatpants.

 "Yo, fruit loops," says the clerk to the lot of us, "I'm shutting this
 store down to go get a full body massage from the Taiwanese Parlor
 down the street. <span class="floydstyle em">Pronto.</span> Get your movies and get out."

 "Full-body?" asks Barnaby. "That means they give you a hand job,
 right?" The clerk perks up and nods gleefully. "Hey, I've always
 wondered..." Barnaby decides exactly how he wants to phrase it. "Is it
 customary to let them know when you're about to come? Like, a warning?
 Or do you not have to do that because they are professionals?"

 Nobody says anything for a few moments. I shrug. "I guess it depends
 on whether you're a sprayer or a lumper," I say.

>inventory

 I am carrying my glasses (being worn) and the DVD case.  Inside the
 DVD case is the Lord of the Rings DVD.

 "Anyway, I wasn't kidding around. Get your movies and get lost,"
 repeats the clerk. The clerk continues to get ready for his little
 excursion. He places his armament upon the counter.

 "Yeah, yeah! I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'..." says Criswell. I'm all
 set, but it looks like we'll have to wait for him or Pang now.

>take horror movie

 I haven't seen anything like that.

>rent dvd

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "rent" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>examine horror

 The horror rack used to be pretty good, but it's fallen into anarchy
 just like all the other racks. Criswell once accidentally rented
 <span class="floydstyle em">Beaches</span> from this rack and failed to note it was a chick
 flick. He's the only guy in the city that thinks the best horror flick
 of all-time doesn't feature Bruce Campbell or Bill Chepil or whoever,
 but rather Bette Midler.

 A grime-encrusted area denizen slams his hand on the door and the
 clerk reluctantly lets him in. The thing shambles his way into the
 video store. He leaves muddy streaks upon the entrance door, drawing
 the further ire of the clerk.

 "Hey, what the hell is the matter with you, cracky?" I suppose that I
 disagree that the new denizen is a crackhead (he meanders more in his
 movement than he shakes, I mean). But I don't say anything. The clerk
 points a stern finger at him from across the counter. "Can't you read?
 We're closed! Get out of here!"

>buy dvd

 That doesn't seem to be for sale.

>examine crackhead

 This creature is covered in a thick grit. He (it?) is draped in a
 musty flannel and shambles about with an unwholesome gait. His
 forearms are unnaturally long and jaundiced, and his there are several
 patches of mosiaced-over scabs and seeping wounds covering his face
 and neck.

 The area denizen grabs at the clerk's neck! He gets two hands round
 the clerk's esophagus, and begins choking the life right out of him!

 The clerk gurgles in pain! I hear a guttural moaning sound coming from
 the attacker. The violence causes Pang and Criswell to hide in the
 back of the store.

 "Hey!" says Barnaby, "Knock it off! Let him go!"

>examine armament

 I should first say something about the city of New Haz and explain why
 a video clerk would be packing heat.

 Culturally, New Haz is kind of a stinking dump. It's been described as
 everything from a holding cell for miscreants and scuzzballs, to a
 bleak planned community gone horribly and violently wrong, to a
 slightly Utopian New Haven, Connecticut. I like it so much I live
 thirty-five minutes away, and believe me when I say that I would not
 work here if the Fort had a mall. Truthfully, it used to be a lot
 worse before some kid brought to justice 80% of the city's Most Wanted
 Criminals a while back. But it's nevertheless rather rough, and you're
 legally required to possess a firearm to enter the west side.

 This gun uses nail magazines, and fires them off slowly and messily,
 one at a time. Nice accuracy, but it has no spray or automatic
 settings. It's on the small side, as small as the manufacturer could
 go without embracing the "ladies choice" designation.

 This weapon has 7 shots remaining.

 The grimy denizen throttles the clerk!

 The clerk slumps to the floor, disappearing behind the register
 counter.

 "Christ, Duffy, get the goddamn gun!" screams Barnaby. The guy
 (creature, whatever it is) is between the gun and Barnaby. It emits a
 throaty snarl and slowly shambles toward him. Barnaby gives the door a
 couple solid kicks and opens it.


>get armament

 I casually lift the gun from the counter without the clerk really
 noticing.

 Barnaby takes a swing at the filthy mound. He connects to its sternum
 (a solid blow) but the guy / creature is not stunned, not driven back,
 not nearly phased by it at all.

 "Shoot the damn thing, Duffy!" yells Barnaby. <span class="floydstyle em">"Now,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">goddammit!"</span>

>shoot zombie

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Specify which gun to shoot with.]</span>

>shoot zombie with armament

 I shoot the creature!

 The creature collapses and falls to the ground.

>search zombie

 The creature is empty.

>examine clerk

 The clerk at Academy Videos is famous through New Haz for being one of
 its most smug and sarcastic citizens. He will always criticize a
 customer's movie choice unless it's one of the ten or fifteen films
 that he thinks are classic. He is wearing a hypercolor shirt like all
 employees in the chain, as well as a pair of dirty sweatpants.

 He  is currently knocked out.

>examine sweatpants

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "sweatpants" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>wake up clerk

 I try, but I don't get any sort of response back into wakefulness.

>examine zombie

 This creature is covered in a thick grit. He (it?) is draped in a
 musty flannel that hasn't been in fashion since Gygax was happily
 married to his first wife. His forearms are unnaturally long and
 jaundiced, and his there are several patches of mosiaced-over scabs
 and seeping wounds covering his face and neck.

 It  is currently knocked out.

>get flannel

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "flannel" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>look behind counter

 I don't find anything behind the counter.

>slap clerk

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "slap" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>search counter

 I don't find anything.

>ask guys about zombie

>ask gibs about zombie
>talk to barnaby

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ Use "TALK TO CHARACTER" to talk to a particular character in the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">game. ]</span>


 I can't think of anything to say right now.

>talk to barnaby

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

>talk to gibs

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

>examine drama
>read poster

 The drama rack should, in theory, contain a bunch of films that are
 shown on TNN, but it instead contains a hodgepodge of differently
 genred flicks. Criswell once took the DVD that Gibs shot a couple
 years ago where he was apologizing to his girlfriend for getting into
 a threesome at this one guy Avandre's bachelor party and put it in
 this rack. That was some serious drama. But I think Gibs rented and
 destroyed it when he found out.


 I can't do that with the posters.

>examine posters

 An original <span class="floydstyle em">Day of the Dead</span> promo has been tacked onto the
 wall. That's really the only one of note. There are some other ones
 that I can't make out, and by 'make out,' I mean 'they were filmed in
 the sixties so I have no idea what their deal is.'

>get tack

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "tack" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

 There's an exit east to Main Street.
 Gibs, Pang, Criswell, the clerk, and the creature are here.

>out


 <span class="floydstyle em">Main Street</span>
 The stench of the city of New Haz hits me like a cruel sucker-punch
 through the septum. It's a ringing, persistent odor. One of sewage
 mixed with old gasoline. I shift to breathing exclusively through my
 mouth. But fortunately we'll be out of here soon enough (and before
 the stink can settle on my clothes.)
 My car is here.

 Gibs, Pang, and Criswell are here.

 "What the <span class="floydstyle em">hell</span> was that in there?" asks Pang.

 "Who knows?" says Barnaby. "Who cares? Let's just go. At least by
 putting down the homeless guy inside he won't get grime nor slime over
 Duffy's windshield in some half-assed attempt to clean it."

 "I thought you knew that guy, Duffy," says Criswell, unhelpfully, as
 if that somehow explains why he was cowering in the corner.

 We need to get in my car and get out of here quickly -- both before
 the cops come round due to the encounter with that thing in the store,
 but also before the city's ripe stench can settle into our clothes.

>go car

 The car is shut.

>open car

 Opened.

 The thing from inside breaks through a section of the door!

>go car

 I get into the car. Pang, Criswell and Barnaby join me.

 The zombie slams its open palms against the side of the car!

>start car or drive car, I guess.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "or" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>start car

 (Entering my car first...)

 I double-check to make sure everyone's into the car.

 The guy from inside keeps clawing away at the passenger side of my
 car.

 "Drive, dammit, <span class="floydstyle em">drive!</span>" screeches Criswell from the backseat.
 "Get us outta here!"

 I put the car in reverse and prepare to get the hell out of town. The
 guy staggers over and gets right in my path.

 "Hit 'em, Duffy!" Criswell's going crazy back there. "Run him over!"

 I put the car in first and stomp the accelerator more out of panic
 than anything else. The guy doesn't move, flinch, anything. I ram him
 and he smacks right into the windshield, chipping it with his elbow.
 He tumbles about and we hear him on the roof for a moment before
 seeing his face appear on the back window, shocking the hell out of
 Pang and Criswell. I downshift from third gear back into second for a
 moment which causes my car to red line and enough of a jolt for him to
 fall off completely. I see him, through the rear-view mirror, take a
 vicious fall onto the road, bouncing against it at painful angles like
 a discarded rag doll.

 Nobody says anything for a second, until Criswell pops opens his
 mouth. "That... man, that was <span class="floydstyle em">awesome!!</span>"

 "You don't think I killed that guy, do you? Do you think he's OK?"

 "It was probably a bot," says Gibs. "Look, he was trying to attack us,
 anyway."

 "That's true," says Pang. "Both items are totally true."

 I get us on the Interstate and head north, back towards home. I chuck
 the gun out the window on the way back. Nobody says anything else
 until I drop Gibs off and get the rest of us back to the house...
>It's OK, Floyd. Don't pay any attention.
>look

 I've only been on, really, truly <span class="floydstyle em">on</span>... once in my life.

 It was about five years ago. The first week of March. The Wizards of
 the Coast (the company that publishes all the D&D books these days)
 were sponsoring a huge, two-day tournament in the Fort. I signed up
 for it with Barnaby, who used to be more into this kind of thing back
 then, and we started gaming it on a Saturday morning.

 It wasn't a 'competitive' tournament, per se, especially since around
 that time the two local gangs of Korean role players had pretty much
 wiped each other out when an on-line housing refresh dispute went from
 the virtual world of the internet to the physical one of reality,
 resulting in thirteen dead and seven wounded. That would have normally
 taken the edge off for the rest of us for the whole of the weekend,
 but we soon found out that WotC were putting up an eight-thousand
 dollar first prize for the weekend's 'Most Outstanding Roleplayer.'
 When I found that out, something clicked inside me, and I drew from a
 strength of personality I didn't know I had.

 All day the dice were with me. Just about every time I threw a
 twenty-sided die I got an incredibly favorable result. I started
 getting a bit more bold and soon found that the other kids at my table
 started <span class="floydstyle em">following</span> me. Looking to me for direction, for
 decisions, for witticisms. I became bolder and overly gregarious. I
 hardly needed any of the booty the game's Dungeon Master was giving us
 in-game, and won over the entire table through generosity. I was
 confident and having fun being <span class="floydstyle em">me</span> for the first time ever.

 My luck stayed with me when I went to different tables and played with
 different people. When the tournament finished the next day, I was
 awarded the top prize and a check for $8,000. I accepted it graciously
 and thanked everyone I played with for giving me the chance to shine.
 As Barnaby and I were rounding up our backpacks and bags of dice, I
 Xeroxed a copy of my character sheet, signed my name and phone number
 to it, and gave it to the cutest girl who seemed single during the
 event, someone I had played with on the first day.

 When I got home, I spent the entire check on a car and a new wardrobe.
 I had nothing left of it by Tuesday.

 Audrey didn't call the number on the sheet, maybe because it was a
 pompous act of nigh-Olympic level. But when she dropped by the Mall
 later that week I asked her out on a date. She said yes and has been
 in various states of flabbergastation with me over the years that have
 followed.

 I got my car, clothes and relationship within a lucky streak that
 lasted 48 hours five years ago. And I've been living off that success
 ever since. I'd confess that in my darker moments, when I am at my
 most honest, it rather spooks me to know that I have essentially been
 stagnant ever since.
>push enter
 stagnant ever since.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Living Room</span>
 I live in a four-bedroom rented house in a college town we all call
 'The Fort.' The exterior to this place was kind of beat up when we
 decided to rent here, and through the last three years we've worked
 our hardest to make the interior nicely match.
 Sitting corpulently in the blue couch is Pang.
 On the tattered couch are the green blanket and the pillow.  Sitting
 on the entertainment center are the television and the DVD player.
 Sitting on the table are Vecna's hand, the Dreamcast, the bottle of
 wine, a cup, the Blade DVD, the The Truman Show DVD, and the Lord of
 the Rings DVD.

 The other three guys who live here include Pang and Criswell and
 another guy named Leary who isn't around much. (But then, he's an
 engineer and the only guy with his life remotely in order.) Criswell
 found most of our crummy furniture when he went Dumpster Diving a
 while back, and we place blankets over the rotting parts like they
 were giant cloth band-aids to hide their pronounced ghetto factor.

>examine wine

 Okay, actually it's a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20.

>examine vecna's hand

 Vecna was a bad-ass (and quite mad) guy described in the original D&D
 game. One of the game's artifacts was his 'hand,' and this is a
 novelty item that they passed out at DragonCon a few years back.

 There's a knock at the door. It's probably Audrey.

>take bottle

 Taken.

 There's another knock on the door. I should probably get that.

>open door

 I let Audrey inside, and give her a kiss on the cheek.

 "Hello, Jarret..." she looks over and sees Pang on the couch. Distaste
 can't help but crawl across her face. "So... what have we got planned
 for tonight?"

 I see Audrey for the first time. I probably should have gotten the
 door for her.

 "Thanks for getting the door, jerk," she says. Ouch. This isn't good,
 I've managed to come off as irritating before she'd even entered the
 house. I usually have ten minutes of grace period.

 "I was in the bathroom, brushing my hair so it would look nice and
 stylish for you," I say with a shrug.

 "It's a brush. Not a magic wand. You know... I've never met a man who
 was so obsessed with his hair. But anyway. What are we doing tonight?"

>talk to audrey

 Please select one:

 (1) "Movie Night! Movie Night sure sounds great, doesn't it?"
 (2) "I'm going to avoid that question by telling you how great you
 look, Miss Case."

>2


 "Well, that's certainly nice of you to say," says Audrey. "Thank you.
 But..." she says with just the trace of a smile, "You can't avoid the
 question <span class="floydstyle em">forever</span>, you know."

 Well, she's right about that, but I could at least probably
 <span class="floydstyle em">try</span>.

 Please select one:

 (1) "OK, to be honest, I thought we'd watch a movie."

 "A movie. Oh-kay," she says. "Which theatre?" she asks, hopefully.

 "Casa de Duffy, funnily enough."

 "Funnily enough? What's so funny, <span class="floydstyle em">or</span> fun, about being cooped
 up in this house for the millionth time?" She puts her hands on her
 hips, which is an subconscious indicator that she's starting to get
 agitated. "You really don't want to leave and do something?"

 "Well, it's not ha-ha funny, no," I tell her. "Look, we got some good
 stuff. I broke the bank here. If you don't like the films then at
 least you've got me providing Tom-Servo-style running commentary."

 She relaxes her pose and waves her hand in a dismissal of her
 argument. "Okay, okay... but you'd better be <span class="floydstyle em">on</span>, Jarret
 Duffy. What's your term for it? Comedy Jupiter? It had better be
 Comedy Jupiter."

 "You betcha. I'll even throw in Io and Europa." I'm not quite sure
 what that means, but those were the only two moons I could recall in a
 pinch, so.

 Pang puts the copy of <span class="floydstyle em">Blade</span> into the DVD player.

>sit on tattered couch

 I sit down on the tattered couch.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Living Room, on a tattered couch</span>
 This room is centered around the television, a 32" Sony that Leary
 brought when he moved in. The set sits on a wooden entertainment
 center, with 'satellite' speakers all around the room. The tattered
 white couch is perpendicular to the set, and the blue one (where Pang
 normally situates himself) is eight or nine feet directly across from
 it.
 On the tattered couch are the green blanket and the pillow.
 Sitting corpulently in the blue couch is Pang.
 Sitting on the entertainment center are the television and the DVD
 player.  Inside the DVD player is the Blade DVD.  Sitting on the table
 are Vecna's hand, the Dreamcast, a cup, the The Truman Show DVD, and
 the Lord of the Rings DVD.
 Audrey is here.

 "What.. aw, hell, what the hell is this, Pang?" asks Criswell, as he
 enters. "Oh, hey, by the way, I don't think we're gonna be able to
 keep beers at the neighbor's house any longer. Someone has begun the
 moving-in process. Wait, did you end up getting this fucking
 <span class="floydstyle em">Blade</span> thing? Oh, Kee-<span class="floydstyle em">rist!</span>"

 I don't understand why Criswell is so against this movie. I guess I
 could ask him, or something, if I really cared. Only I don't. I just
 want him gone.

 "Just watch the movie," says Pang.

 "No!" exclaims Criswell. "I'm gonna make The Call!"

 "You're not going to have a quorum," says Pang.

>throw hand at criswell

 I'm not holding that.

>take hand

 I can't reach Vecna's hand from the tattered couch.

>throw hand at criswell

 I'm not holding that.

>stand

 Be a little more specific about what you'd like me to stand.

>stand up

 I get up off the tattered couch.

 Leary walks down the stairs. He gives everyone a 'hey' and waves to
 Audrey.

 "Yo, Leary, what's your take on <span class="floydstyle em">Blade</span>?" asks Criswell.

 Pang's not thrilled about opinions being offered up on his choice
 before the opening credits are even finished.

 "Ehh," says Leary as he picks up the phone to make a call. "Not my
 thing. Nothing personal, Panger."

 "Damn fuckin' straight!" says Criswell. "I'm makin' the call! The Call
 for Ejection! Duffy? What're you saying?"

 I don't know how to go with this one. On one hand, it could mean that
 my movie will get played and these two morons will leave out of
 boredom. On the other hand -- just how freaking immature am I going to
 come across?

>talk to audrey

 Please select one:

 (1) "Sorry. The next movie will probably be better anyway."
 (2) "Did you particularly want to see <span class="floydstyle em">Blade?</span>?"

>2


 "Not especially," she says. "I think I saw it when it first came out."

 "What? Are you kidding me?" I think about the math for a second. "By
 my calculations, you were eight when it came out. You mean to tell me
 that the Neuromancer didn't like you dating me at first because at
 three years your elder, I was a bad example, but he was OK with you
 watching a movie where Snipes hacks apart vampires for 90 minutes?" I
 call her father 'The Neuromancer' because his first name is Henry, and
 the main character of the novel _Neuromancer_ is named Henry Case.
 I've been lucky in not saying it when he's been around so far.

 "I was very mature for my age," she replies. "I think we'd have been a
 perfect match, intellectually, if you met me when I was eight and you
 were twenty-seven.

 "Hey, what about if you met me?" says Criswell.

 "Two," Audrey and I say at the same time.

 "The thumb points down, bitchkin!" says Criswell to Pang. It was
 inevitable that he was going to pull the movie no matter what popular
 choice happened to be. Criswell hops over to the DVD player and ejects
 the disc. He places <span class="floydstyle em">The Truman Show</span> in. "We're now starin'
 down the barrel of a whole lotta giggles," he says to Audrey.

 I keep one eye trained underneath the sofa in case Audrey's rolling
 eyes pop out of her head.

 "What are you talking about?" she says. Audrey has never, ever liked
 Criswell. "This is a drama, not a ninety minute episode of 'White Guys
 Gone Jostling.'" Criswell's head strains to the side as he
 simultaneously doesn't believe her and doesn't comprehend her.

 Audrey continues. "You know what drama is, right? It's the name given
 to a movie that <span class="floydstyle em">adults</span> tend to enjoy, as well as being the
 standard root cause of every Linkin Park song."

 "Yeah, whatever." Criswell shrugs. "I bet you Truman here is making
 like he's talking out of his ass before the opening credits are
 finished."

>talk to audrey

 Please select one:

 (1) "So... how is school going these days?"
 (2) "What are you doing later?"

 "Probably storming out of here in anger," she says. I give her one of
 those looks that would look more in place on a puppet after the jaw
 string got cut. "Just kidding," she says after a beat. "You're
 working, right? I am actually going to be at the Mall, 'funnily
 enough.'" She does that, sometimes, claim my cliched remarks as her
 own. "Sydney and a few of my other friends will be at the Bead Store.
 I'll stop by."

 Five minutes elapse. The only possession Criswell has left is the
 dumbfounded look upon his face.

 Minute seven comes and Pang can't help himself any longer.

 "You stupid, simple... <span class="floydstyle em">child</span>," he says, quietly. "Next week
 go get <span class="floydstyle em">Good Will Hunting</span> -- Robin Williams is hilarious in
 it." Pang points his thumb down.

>wait

 Time passes...

 Leary turns around from his phone call and squints a bit at the TV. He
 chuckles, points his own thumb down for a second and then turns back
 away from the living room. Pang wiggles the Vecna's Hand toy around
 with its thumb pointing down in order to taunt Criswell just a bit
 more.

 Pang gets up to change the movie.

 He places in <span class="floydstyle em">Lord of the Rings</span>, apparently without really
 recognizing what it is. The intro starts. Audrey lets out a sigh. I
 have no idea if I'm correctly interpreting it, but I'm guessing that
 she's resigned herself to at least watching the movie on the TV
 screen.

 "What the shit is this?" asks Criswell. "More fuckin' ghouls and orcs
 and shit?"

>talk to criswell

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

 Pang and Criswell both put their thumbs down as Leary leaves.

 "What are you two doing?" I ask. "There aren't any other movies. We
 didn't get any."

 "Someone has forgotten our massive porn collection," says Pang,
 matter-of-factly.

 "Oh, for Heaven's sake," says Audrey. She gets off the couch and
 leaves the room, heading towards my bedroom. Not, I should say, in a
 'let's go make out' way or a 'we need to talk' way but in a
 pre-emptive strike on a fight way.

 "What's her problem?" asks Criswell, to Pang. "We've got
 chick-on-chick stuff."

 I've got a fairly high boiling point, but I've absolutely had it with
 these two. The frustrations concerning the fact that my bad decisions
 and sloth have forced me into this decision boils right over. I decide
 it's time to probably let them have it.

>throw bottle at Pang

 I ultimately decide  that throwing the bottle of wine at Pang isn't
 such a great idea.

>talk to pang

 Please select one:

 (1) "That -- this, all of this: Not cool, dude."
 (2) "What the FUCKING HELL is wrong with you?"

>2


 Pang doesn't say anything at first, a bit taken aback by my outburst.

 "You two fucking pieces of shit really make me sick. I know neither
 one of you have the looks or personality to ever get a fucking girl to
 come over here more than once, but for me, you two acting like a bunch
 of immature little fucks just pisses me the hell right off. What the
 fuck is wrong with you? How fucking old are you?"

 "Hey, look -- "

 "Just shut the fuck up, Chunky. This is the last fucking time. If this
 shit ever happens again -- if you or your little sidekick are anywhere
 NEAR me when I have her over, I will fucking break both of you."

 Pang doesn't say anything. He just looks over towards Criswell.

>go to bedroom


 <span class="floydstyle em">Bedroom</span>
 My bedroom's the smallest one in the house. (I got here last so I got
 the skankiest room.) There's not a whole lot going on in here, just
 some shelves with all my crap on it and a bed. It smells a bit less
 like cigarettes than it used to since I have gone a week and a half
 since my last one.

 "What the hell was that?" asks Audrey. "When are you going to get
 it... this has got to stop."

>talk to audrey

 (1) "You're pissed. Aren't you?"

 "Well, when is it going to stop? I mean, really. They're animals."

 "Oh, come on now! You're over-reacting if you really think that."

 "Fine, Leary isn't. But he's never around. Those other two? They're
 out there right now hurling feces at one another while masturbating,
 sorry, <span class="floydstyle em">furiously</span> masturbating and you <span class="floydstyle em">know</span> it."

 "Look, I can't help my roommates, OK?"

 "Yes, you can, Jarret! You're better than this! We're better than
 this. You're too intelligent and talented to be working for minimum
 wage. But because you are, you have to live with three other people."

 "Look, I happen to like my job. Shouldn't that account for something?"

 "Jarret, if you had as little going for you as Pang and Criswell then
 I wouldn't care. I really wouldn't. But I know you better, and I know
 that with the smallest bit of drive or ambition you could be writing,
 writing <span class="floydstyle em">well.</span> The guy that I fell in love with was the
 greatest storyteller, er, albeit in the fantasy genre, that I had ever
 met. And you're just sitting on that gift. Seeing you waste yourself
 like this isn't fun."

 (1) "Well, what is fun, then? Educate me."

 "Spending time with you is fun, normally. You know, doing date-type
 things. I am not old enough where I want to spend every evening with
 my boyfriend just sitting on a couch watching film. My sister became
 that way, but she works all day, is married and is tired when she gets
 home. I'm not ready to retire just yet."

 Please select one:

 (1) "Hey, look, me either. OK? I'm not retiring on you."
 (2) "Look, we'll go skydiving or something, okay?"

 "Well, I appreciate the sentiment, Jarret, but it's been like this for
 a while now. I don't know if it's just the inevitable ennui you get
 when you reach your late twenties or what, but that kind of brings me
 to what I wanted to talk about when I came over tonight..."

 I realize now that we're probably only just getting started with what
 she wants to discuss. Geez. Well, I'll try to keep this quick.

 Please select one:

 (1) "Lay it on me, then. What's up?"

 "I'm going to be moving soon."

 "What? Why? Where to? Moving like you're moving to Cheyenne moving or
 moving like you're moving to Eastern Islamistan moving?"

 "To Texas... I'm going to Texas. Houston, specifically. A company from
 there sent some recruiters up over Christmas Break and most of us in
 my program interviewed well. After I finish up this semester I am
 taking a job with them and headed down there."

 "Uh... okay." <span class="floydstyle em">Don't you break down, Duffy. Do not let this girl</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">get under your skin.</span>

 "And it goes without saying that I'd love it if you came with me. I
 mean, I hope you know that."

 "To Texas. Uh... well..."

 (1) "Look, there's not a chance in hell I'm moving to Texas."

 She shakes her head, she doesn't understand what I mean.

 "I'm just saying, if you're going to move the hell away then don't
 beat around the bush. Get to some place that I'll really never be able
 to see you." For the record, I thought that mentioning Persephone or
 another Kuiper Belt object would have come off as too sarcastic, but I
 don't tell her that.

 "That's not why I am going there. Why are you being so thick with
 this? What on earth is keeping you here?"

 "So you want me to come with you?"

 She pauses before answering. "With you like this? No. No, I don't want
 this version of you coming with me. I don't think you get just how
 much I am into you, Jarret. And it's painful to see you like this. The
 guy that I fell for and have been with all these years would not get
 defensive about simply moving somewhere."

 Please select one:

 (1) "Look... I have to get to work."

 "I understand," she says.

 Technically, I had a couple hours before I was due at work, but I
 might as well go in early and pick up some overtime.
 "We can talk about this after I get out of there, right?"

 "Of course," she says. Again, in her terse form of communicating more
 without words than with.

 "I get out at eleven. Gibs might want me to do his radio show but I
 will blow it off if so. I'll give you a call when I get home, okay?"

 She nods, gives me a hug and leaves my room.

 doing? <span class="floydstyle em">Goddess,</span> I don't need this shit. Goodbye!"

>examine pang

 Pang used to be an athlete but he's let himself go in recent years.
 He's about 6'4" tall and 270 pounds. He's wearing a mesh orange jersey
 stuffed into a pair of scrub blue jeans.

 Audrey opens the door to the Front Porch, leaves, and slams it behind
 her.

>out

 I shake my head at my horrible home life and leave for work...
 I'm still rather pissed off when I pull up into the Mall parking lot
 and showroom park my car. What kind of game is Audrey playing here?
 Surely she's bluffing. We've gone to Defcon 2 or maybe 3 before, but
 we were always able to talk one another down before the bombshells
 were dropped.

 I didn't want to have to go into work tonight worrying about this kind
 of crap. My job becomes a lot easier when I'm able to turn off the
 parts of my mind that don't deal with twenty-sided dice, Player's
 Handbooks and noticing customer body odor. The greatest curse you can
 inflict upon someone who works at the Mall is getting them to fret.

 (And the greatest curse you can inflict upon yourself while at the
 Mall is to attempt to stop smoking. I seriously picked a bad week for
 it.)

 I walk down to the east end of the Mall, avoid the guy taking surveys,
 and enter my store.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Benji's Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium</span>
 Trott had been working the evening shift; I greet him and take my
 usual place behind the counter. There's really no reason for two of us
 to close the store, except that Benji (the owner) is still a little
 freaked after someone tried to blow up his arcade next door a couple
 of weeks ago. It's unlikely that we'll have any customers, though, so
 Trott and I should be able to logout the register and drop the gate
 quickly when the time comes.
 The counter contains the Magic: The Gathering cards.
 The counter has a postcard on it.
 Trott is here.

>get postcard

 Taken.

 Gibs arrives from the north.

>examine postcard

 It's a postcard sent from a friend of Trott's.

 It reads, <span class="floydstyle em">"Greetings from New Mexico, Trotskie! Clara and I are</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">living in a town called -- get this -- 'Rockville' of all things. It's</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">right near Alamogordo, too, which is the city where Atari buried all</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">those E.T. cartridges. I'll probably make the trip to check out the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">site one of these days. Clara has been completing her degree off the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">internet, and I've already cracked and released my first ware. It's</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">great to be back in the loop! Keep it cool and hopefully we'll be back</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">for a visit later this year. Try to remember to lovingly palm the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">breasts of the corpses you've been slabbing lately, bud! You know they</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">like that. Your pal, Delarion."</span>

 "Hey, Duffy, solid. Glad you're here," says Barnaby. He puts his big
 gulp drink down by the counter. "Got a question for you."

>talk to gibs

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

 Barnaby nods over to Trott. "What's going on, man?" he asks.

>examine cards

 The cards are used in a game called 'Magic:The Gathering.' It's sort
 of like poker for nerds, except that the cards have special powers and
 so forth. I've never really gotten into it. Anyway, this is a small
 box containing wrapped packs of cards. There are about fifty or so in
 a box.

 "It's all great here, man," says Trott to Barnaby. "Yourself?" he
 asks.

 "Bitchin'" says Gibs in reply.

>get box

 I don't see that.

>get cards

 The counter is closed.

>open counter

 I can't, it's locked. I have no idea where the key is, either.

 I hear a 'pop' sound come from near the counter.

 "Aw, Christ," says Trott. "The goddamn lock just burst on the counter
 shelf. Cheap plastic crap."

 and the usual bunch of backpack-wearing kids bought their <span class="floydstyle em">Magic:</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">The Gathering</span> packs after classes let out. Other than that,
 nothing of note. Why's Benji even having two of us close the store
 these days?"

 "He still thinks that the bomb that was planted in the arcade a few
 weeks back had something to do with him. He's as paranoid as a
 dope-smoking Everquest player chilling in a Greek Net cafe."

 then I'm all set. If not, at least I can see well.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Necrotic Drift</span>
 Interactive Fiction
 Copyright (c) 2004. Written and programmed by Robb Sherwin
 Release 1.03 / Serial number 040623 / Hugo 3.1

 NECROTIC DRIFT was written between December of 2001 and May of 2004.

 Minimum Recommended Resolution: 1024x768x16b.
 Platforms Supported : All graphics-enabled Hugo platforms.

 Conversation and violence are oftentimes the key to solving problems
 in this game. You can instruct Duffy to speak with someone by typing
 "<span class="floydstyle em">TALK</span> to <span class="floydstyle em">character</span>" (or simply <span class="floydstyle em">T</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">character</span>, for short). The resulting menu allows the player
 to pick from a menu of what you'd like your character to say. The game
 will then respond with the NPC's response. For details on the game's
 combat system, consult the Help Menu.

 It is not possible to get the game in an completely unfinishable
 state. In certain situations, the player is allowed to solve different
 puzzles at his/her leisure, and information pertaining to those
 unsolved puzzles will be repeated when necessary to cut down on
 required player memorization. Please type "<span class="floydstyle em">HELP</span>" for a brief
 Command Summary, further answers to common gameplay questions, and
 this ware's design notes & credits.

>remove glasses

 I can't remove my specs like that! They are a valuable
 information-gathering tool!

 <span class="floydstyle em">Benji's Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium</span>
 The Emporium is rather smallish, as far as stores around here go,
 nestled into the far corners of the Mall, distant from practically
 every other decent or worthwhile store. Shelves of gaming books and
 modules are arranged everywhere, and promotional kiosks occupy the
 floorspace between the register and the far wall.

 The rest of the Mall is to the north.
 The counter has Barnaby's Big Gulp drink on it.
 Trott and Gibs are here.  Gibs has Gibs's lacrosse stick.

>examine kiosk

 Benji bought up a bunch of skanky, rotting shelves from some other
 business here in the Mall that went under a while back. He moved the
 nice, clean ones that we had previously to his home when he was
 installing his home theatre system. These shelves have a stench to
 them which I'm sure probably gets into my clothes and on my person to
 a disgusting degree.
 Sitting on the shelves are some gaming manuals.

 save for the last one, which I haven't had to get into yet. (AOL
 Keyword being 'yet,' I guess.)

>drink drink

 It's not mine.

>examine counter

 It's an acrylic blue countertop, useful for leaning upon during the
 workday. We keep some media inside the counter, but nothing
 particularly interesting or important.
 Behind the counter is a stool.

>close store

 I can't do that with the Emporium.

>examine stool

 The Game Store stool is a very short and incredibly uncomfortable
 4-legged stool that we prop ourselves on when we know that Benji isn't
 going to be around. (Benji is an incredibly irritating person to work
 for, and will yell at us if he sees us slouching on the stool. He is a
 miserable person, in this regard. ... In <span class="floydstyle em">all</span> regards, really,
 but still.) Trott once hurled the stool at me, and the thing really
 smarted when I got hit by the sharp legs of the thing.

>get stool

 Taken.

>examine far wall

 I haven't encountered any "far wall".  (If you're sure you need to
 refer to that, try putting it another way.)

>wield stool

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "wield" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>examine register

 The cash register is beige and on the large side. They come in all
 shapes and sizes and I suppose I have seen a bunch at the Mall where I
 work that differ in structure and security features... Jesus, this is
 depressing. I'm a cash register expert at age 27. What have I been
 doing with my life?

>look under stool

 I don't find anything under the stool.

>open register

 The register is locked.

>hit register with stool

 I can't really fight that.

>close out register

 I haven't encountered any "out register".  (If you're sure you need to
 refer to that, try putting it another way.)

>close store

 I can't do that with the Emporium.

>take manual

 I've got all the info contained within memorized for those games I'm
 into, and somewhat proud of myself for those games that I don't have
 committed to memory, if you're digging my ditch here (and I think you
 are).

>give cards to trott

 My goodwill is ignored.

 It is not possible to get the game in an unwinnable state. General
 advice would be to role play Duffy and make those choices that he
 faces which he is seemingly incapable of making on his own, as well as
 talk at length to the other characters that you will encounter.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Benji's Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium</span>
 The Emporium is rather smallish, as far as stores around here go,
 nestled into the far corners of the Mall, distant from practically
 every other decent or worthwhile store. Shelves of gaming books and
 modules are arranged everywhere, and promotional kiosks occupy the
 floorspace between the register and the far wall.

 The rest of the Mall is to the north.
 Trott and Gibs are here.  Gibs has Gibs's lacrosse stick.

>examine gibs

 Barnaby Gibbons is 5'11" tall and 175lbs, and right about my age. He
 has hazel eyes and brown hair. He's wearing a backwards baseball cap
 and a Rochester Knighthawks authentic lacrosse jersey. Barnaby makes
 his living as the host of a semi-popular sports radio show that is
 broadcast from two in the morning until six AM weekdays. I've known
 him for about a decade. He was my roommate for my three semesters at
 Syracuse University, and always keeps me rooted back in reality when
 I've been spending too much time with role-playing games. He also has
 the worst taste in music of anybody I know.

>give postcard to trott

 My goodwill is ignored.

>wait

 Time passes...

>examine stick

 Gibs's stick is a Patterson brand Men's field lacrosse stick, designed
 for the Attack-Midfield position. It has a rawhide quick wall and
 bridge, woven with black leather, at one end (for catching and
 shooting balls) and a standard wood frame and handle at the other.
 Gibs has removed the plastic butt-end for his stick and filed it down,
 as he often thrusts it at his opponents during play in one of the
 nastier leagues he plays in.

>show postcard to gibs

 Gibs doesn't seem too interested in the postcard.

>show postcard to trott

 Trott doesn't seem too interested in the postcard.

>show cards to trott

 Trott doesn't seem too interested in the Magic: The Gathering cards.

>play magic

 I can't play with that.

>show cards to gibs

 Gibs doesn't seem too interested in the Magic: The Gathering cards.

>talk to cards

 I can't speak to that!

>unlock register

 I'd rather not get involved.

>fix lock

 I can't fix that.

>examine lock

 It's just a little lock placed on the counter to stop the mallrats
 from stealing Magic:The Gathering cards when we're not looking. And,
 to be honest, we're almost never looking. The cheapness of the lock
 caused it to become brittle and break when Gibs set his frosty Big
 Gulp drink by it.

>put drink on register

 I can't do that with the register.

>pour drink on register

 That doesn't seem to be feasible.

>pour drink on gibs

 That doesn't seem to be feasible.

>give drink to trott

 My goodwill is ignored.

>examine drink

 It's sixty-four ounces of refreshing lime cola in a cup that looks
 like a chalice. The 128 ounce version of this drink is called the
 'Supreme Maw Thrust' and even though it's a better deal it doesn't get
 purchased much by many Mall denizens.

>give drink to gibs

 My goodwill is ignored.

>inventory

 I am carrying my glasses (being worn), a postcard, the Magic: The
 Gathering cards, Barnaby's Big Gulp drink, and the stool.

>put drink on door

 I can't do that with the back office door.

>exits

 There's an exit north to the rest of the Mall, but I'm really not
 supposed to leave until my shift is over. (That won't be for another
 couple of hours.)

>sleep

 Not now -- I'm not very tired.

>trott, close store

 Trott can't do that with the Emporium.

>t gibs

 Just talking to Gibs will suffice.

>talk to gibs

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

>shuffle cards

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "shuffle" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>examine cards

 The cards are used in a game called 'Magic:The Gathering.' It's sort
 of like poker for nerds, except that the cards have special powers and
 so forth. I've never really gotten into it. Anyway, this is a small
 box containing wrapped packs of cards. There are about fifty or so in
 a box.

 My dad came home late one night when I was nine and threw an old copy
 of the <span class="floydstyle em">Monster Manual</span> by Gary Gygax onto my bed. He woke me
 up, stressed and shaking at the humiliation his friends had put him
 through earlier that evening.

 He asked me if I wanted the book. I was still groggy, but I picked it
 up and thumbed through it. "We didn't play Monopoly tonight, Jarret,"
 he told me. "That's because not a one of them can beat me. Instead,
 they brought out this... thing. Some 'game of the imagination'." He
 practically spat that last word. "You can move all you like without
 throwing any dice, but to actually do anything, you need to throw a
 handful!!" I was both reading entries on the different monsters and
 paying half-attention to his rant. "Five minutes in, Benson tells me
 that I come across something called a gorgon. That got me stoned. Why
 would I play a game that depicted the recreational use of marijuana
 cigarettes? I got up and left."

 "They let you read this during play?" I asked him. He nodded. I turned
 to page 49. "I don't think they were supposed to. It says right here
 that the gorgon can turn you <span class="floydstyle em">to</span> stone. It doesn't
 <span class="floydstyle em">get</span> you stoned. And right here are all its weaknesses! How
 did you not see this? Are you stupid or something? Or what?"

 My father snatched back the <span class="floydstyle em">Monster Manual.</span> He didn't state
 that what he was going to do was going to hurt him more than it hurt
 me. (I think all he did say was that he should have left his 'patented
 Duffy blast' on my mother's face the night I was conceived, which
 didn't make a whole lot of sense to me then.) He instead just quietly
 gave me a spanking for back talk. But as that 112 page reference to a
 modern mythology of villainy struck my bony behind, it was as if he
 were bonding the pages and me for all time. Like directed osmosis
 through anger or something.

 (Okay, it actually wasn't like osmosis at all, but I've sacrificed
 knowledge in basic chemistry for additional levels in Modern
 Mythology, so please cut me some slack on the occasional analogy
 outside of my experience.)

 In the week that followed, my father tried to ban Dungeons & Dragons
 from the house as he had previously banned video games, cursing, Cajun
 food and music recorded after 1959. I stood up to him on D&D, though,
 and he caved for the only time in my childhood. Within a week I was
 running my own games for the kids in my tract. We were creating
 adventures together with Devils, Demons and Dragons and it was one of
 the best times of my life. My old man may have never been on the short
 list for an award from the PTA, but his maniac antics did a better job
 helping me understand just what I was interested in than the fathers
 of anyone else I grew up with. And heck, he did have my back that one
 time I met D&D creator Gary Gygax himself at DragonCon and started
 kicking him in his bag of magic beans (if you're digging my ditch
 here) in misplaced, latent vengeance due to how hard the board stock
 was for those manual covers.

 I don't think you've truly bonded with your father until you've spent
 36 consecutive hours in a holding cell mocking and taunting an inmate
 set consisting of multiple thirty-somethings decked out in homemade
 hobbit, fairie and chocobo costumes, where the only thing the lot of
 them had in common, aside from a complete lack of human dignity, was
 relating how difficult it was to sleep late when the sump pump went
 off.

 Release 1.03 / Serial number 040623 / Hugo 3.1

 I'm here this evening at an Academy Videos store thirty-five minutes
 from my home with two of my roommates and my best friend. We have to
 come all the way down here to rent because of the late fees on my
 memberships at all the video places back in the Fort. I wish I had a
 good story for why that is the case, but I don't. I'm just poor and
 had the first <span class="floydstyle em">Lord of the Rings</span> movie overdue for more than
 two weeks at multiple video chains. I kept it around to mainly prove
 trivia. (It will probably end up costing me more to show my friends
 that the elf character Legolas was walking <span class="floydstyle em">on</span>, and not
 <span class="floydstyle em">in</span> the snow, than it did for director Peter Jackson to
 implement that effect on-screen.)

 Supposedly, Audrey is dropping by tonight to watch a movie, which is
 why I'm even here to begin with. In the five years we've been together
 we've dumped each other a total of nine times. She is currently ahead
 of me six to three. Her most shallow dumping was when she wanted to
 exclusively hang around a hardcore goth guy who had somehow managed to
 finance or lease his own cemetery plot. That guy was the black
 fingernail Alpha male until he missed his first payment. To be fair,
 mine was when she filled out Student Loan paperwork for me without my
 knowledge or consent and almost enrolled me into classes at the nearby
 University of Central Hill. She doesn't like the fact that I work at
 the Funtime Teen Mall for $5.51 an hour at age 27.

 I have to work later tonight, so I guess I'd better pick something and
 get out of here quickly.

>space

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "space" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>examine action

 It's constructed from a cheap wood board, and sags quite a bit due to
 the number of movies placed within it.

 Inside the action rack is a movie from action rack.

 "So..." says Gibs, as he scans the movies half-heartedly, "You and
 Audrey are on the rocks again, eh, Duffy? What happened this time, did
 she get you enrolled into MIT?"

>take action movie

 I grab a movie from the rack. And behold! It's <span class="floydstyle em">The Lord of the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Rings.</span> Why on earth the dip behind the counter would deign to
 keep it in <span class="floydstyle em">this</span> rack is beyond my comprehension. But it
 doesn't matter. I don't really possess the discipline to go get
 something else.

 Pang clears his throat and holds up a copy of <span class="floydstyle em">Blade</span>. "I have
 found the movie for us all tonight," he states, with an annoying
 authority. "It has electronica and vampires, as all classics should."

 "<span class="floydstyle em">Blade?</span>" screeches Criswell. He's another one of my
 roommates. "They merged techno music and goths for that one. No
 chance. No way. And if you pick out one that merges country music with
 the French art film or opera with a Pixar kiddie flick I will drop
 trou and take a crap on the TV while it's playing."

 Criswell's only half joking, as he's demonstrated his willingness to
 do that before. When his favorite CFL football team lost in the finals
 last year he was so pissed off at the TV for depicting it that he
 grabbed a chair from the kitchen, got up and plopped a steaming load
 on top of the set. Worse, it was two weeks before anyone cleaned it
 up. We had a veritable bumper crop of flies around the house that
 year.

>wait

 Time passes...

 "OK, I'm set," says Criswell. "<span class="floydstyle em">Truman Show</span>. Jim Carrey is the
 funniest man alive. This'll be a <span class="floydstyle em">gem</span>. Hey, Duffy, you
 bringin' that chick you hang around with over tonight? Well, thank me
 later, man, 'cos she'll be all out of giggles by the time you pull off
 your pants. For once, anyway."

 Barnaby idly toys with a movie and then puts it back on the shelf.
 "There were some real hotties at that Bead Store, the other day," he
 says to me. "Cute, but not so cute that they would have nothing to do
 with you, I mean."

>wait

 Time passes...

 "Yo, fruit loops," says the clerk to the lot of us, "I'm shutting this
 store down to go get a full body massage from the Taiwanese Parlor
 down the street. <span class="floydstyle em">Pronto.</span> Get your movies and get out."

 "Full-body?" asks Barnaby. "That means they give you a hand job,
 right?" The clerk perks up and nods gleefully. "Hey, I've always
 wondered..." Barnaby decides exactly how he wants to phrase it. "Is it
 customary to let them know when you're about to come? Like, a warning?
 Or do you not have to do that because they are professionals?"

 Nobody says anything for a few moments. I shrug. "I guess it depends
 on whether you're a sprayer or a lumper," I say.

>wait

 Time passes...

 "Anyway, I wasn't kidding around. Get your movies and get lost,"
 repeats the clerk. The clerk continues to get ready for his little
 excursion. He places his armament upon the counter.

 "Yeah, yeah! I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'..." says Criswell. I'm all
 set, but it looks like we'll have to wait for him or Pang now.

>wait

 Time passes...

 A grime-encrusted area denizen slams his hand on the door and the
 clerk reluctantly lets him in. The thing shambles his way into the
 video store. He leaves muddy streaks upon the entrance door, drawing
 the further ire of the clerk.

 "Hey, what the hell is the matter with you, cracky?" I suppose that I
 disagree that the new denizen is a crackhead (he meanders more in his
 movement than he shakes, I mean). But I don't say anything. The clerk
 points a stern finger at him from across the counter. "Can't you read?
 We're closed! Get out of here!"

>take gun

 I casually lift the gun from the counter without the clerk really
 noticing.

 The area denizen grabs at the clerk's neck! He gets two hands round
 the clerk's esophagus, and begins choking the life right out of him!

 The clerk gurgles in pain! I hear a guttural moaning sound coming from
 the attacker. The violence causes Pang and Criswell to hide in the
 back of the store.

 "Hey!" says Barnaby, "Knock it off! Let him go!"

>shoot thing

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Specify which gun to shoot with.]</span>

>out

 (opening the store door first)
 It's stuck!!

 The grimy denizen throttles the clerk!

 The clerk slumps to the floor, disappearing behind the register
 counter.

 "Shoot the goddamn thing, Duffy!" screams Barnaby. He kicks open the
 door to the outside and gets into a defensive posture.
 We run outside and slam the door shut. Pang gives it an angled kick,
 'locking' it the best he can.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Main Street</span>
 The stench of New Haz suddenly hits us all like a cruel sucker-punch
 through the septum. Individually (but within moments, in concert) we
 all gasp for fresher air. We need to get in my car and get out of here
 quickly -- both before that <span class="floydstyle em">thing</span> finishes up in the store,
 and before the city's stink can settle in our clothes.
 My car is here.

 Gibs, Pang, and Criswell are here.

 "What... what <span class="floydstyle em">the hell</span> was that?" asks Pang. I don't have a
 decent answer for him. I don't know, I don't have any idea.

 "There are sometimes bots," starts Barnaby, before shutting up. "Oh,
 Christ, let's just get the hell out of here before it comes looking
 for us!"

>open car
>enter car

 Opened.


 I get into the car. Pang, Criswell and Barnaby join me.

 The thing from inside breaks through a section of the door!

>drive

 I double-check to make sure everyone's into the car.

 The guy from inside starts banging and clawing at the passenger side
 of my car.

 "Drive, dammit, <span class="floydstyle em">drive!</span>" screeches Criswell from the backseat.
 "Get us outta here!"

 I put the car in reverse and prepare to get the hell out of town. The
 guy staggers over and gets right in my path.

 "Hit 'em, Duffy!" Criswell's going crazy back there. "Run him over!"

 I put the car in first and stomp the accelerator more out of panic
 than anything else. The guy doesn't move, flinch, anything. I ram him
 and he smacks right into the windshield, chipping it with his elbow.
 He tumbles about and we hear him on the roof for a moment before
 seeing his face appear on the back window, shocking the hell out of
 Pang and Criswell. I downshift from third gear back into second for a
 moment which causes my car to red line and enough of a jolt for him to
 fall off completely. I see him, through the rear-view mirror, take a
 vicious fall onto the road, bouncing against it at painful angles like
 a discarded rag doll.

 Nobody says anything for a second, until Criswell pops opens his
 mouth. "That... man, that was <span class="floydstyle em">awesome!!</span>"

 "You don't think I killed that guy, do you? Do you think he's OK?"

 "It was probably a bot," says Gibs. "Look, he was trying to attack us,
 anyway."

 "That's true," says Pang. "Both items are totally true."

 I get us on the Interstate and head north, back towards home. I chuck
 the gun out the window on the way back. Nobody says anything else
 until I drop Gibs off and get the rest of us back to the house...
>press space

>wait
 I've only been on, really, truly <span class="floydstyle em">on</span>... once in my life.

 It was about five years ago. The first week of March. The Wizards of
 the Coast (the company that publishes all the D&D books these days)
 were sponsoring a huge, two-day tournament in the Fort. I signed up
 for it with Barnaby, who used to be more into this kind of thing back
 then, and we started gaming it on a Saturday morning.

 It wasn't a 'competitive' tournament, per se, especially since around
 that time the two local gangs of Korean role players had pretty much
 wiped each other out when an on-line housing refresh dispute went from
 the virtual world of the internet to the physical one of reality,
 resulting in thirteen dead and seven wounded. That would have normally
 taken the edge off for the rest of us for the whole of the weekend,
 but we soon found out that WotC were putting up an eight-thousand
 dollar first prize for the weekend's 'Most Outstanding Roleplayer.'
 When I found that out, something clicked inside me, and I drew from a
 strength of personality I didn't know I had.

 All day the dice were with me. Just about every time I threw a
 twenty-sided die I got an incredibly favorable result. I started
 getting a bit more bold and soon found that the other kids at my table
 started <span class="floydstyle em">following</span> me. Looking to me for direction, for
 decisions, for witticisms. I became bolder and overly gregarious. I
 hardly needed any of the booty the game's Dungeon Master was giving us
 in-game, and won over the entire table through generosity. I was
 confident and having fun being <span class="floydstyle em">me</span> for the first time ever.

 My luck stayed with me when I went to different tables and played with
 different people. When the tournament finished the next day, I was
 awarded the top prize and a check for $8,000. I accepted it graciously
 and thanked everyone I played with for giving me the chance to shine.
 As Barnaby and I were rounding up our backpacks and bags of dice, I
 Xeroxed a copy of my character sheet, signed my name and phone number
 to it, and gave it to the cutest girl who seemed single during the
 event, someone I had played with on the first day.

 When I got home, I spent the entire check on a car and a new wardrobe.
 I had nothing left of it by Tuesday.

 Audrey didn't call the number on the sheet, maybe because it was a
 pompous act of nigh-Olympic level. But when she dropped by the Mall
 later that week I asked her out on a date. She said yes and has been
 in various states of flabbergastation with me over the years that have
 followed.

 I got my car, clothes and relationship within a lucky streak that
 lasted 48 hours five years ago. And I've been living off that success
 ever since. I'd confess that in my darker moments, when I am at my
 most honest, it rather spooks me to know that I have essentially been
 stagnant ever since.
>wait
 stagnant ever since.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Living Room</span>
 I live in a four-bedroom rented house in a college town we all call
 'The Fort.' The exterior to this place was kind of beat up when we
 decided to rent here, and through the last three years we've worked
 our hardest to make the interior nicely match.
 Sitting corpulently in the blue couch is Pang.
 On the tattered couch are the green blanket and the pillow.  Sitting
 on the entertainment center are the television and the DVD player.
 Sitting on the table are Vecna's hand, the Dreamcast, the bottle of
 wine, a cup, the Blade DVD, the The Truman Show DVD, and the Lord of
 the Rings DVD.

 The other three guys who live here include Pang and Criswell and
 another guy named Leary who isn't around much. (But then, he's an

 found most of our crummy furniture when he went Dumpster Diving a
 while back, and we place blankets over the rotting parts like they
 were giant cloth band-aids to hide their pronounced ghetto factor.

 There's a knock at the door. It's probably Audrey.

>open door

 I let Audrey inside, and give her a kiss on the cheek.

 "Hello, Jarret..." she looks over and sees Pang on the couch. Distaste
 can't help but crawl across her face. "So... what have we got planned
 for tonight?"

 I see Audrey for the first time. I probably should have gotten the
 door for her.

 "Thanks for getting the door, jerk," she says. Ouch. This isn't good,
 I've managed to come off as irritating before she'd even entered the
 house. I usually have ten minutes of grace period.

 "I was in the bathroom, brushing my hair so it would look nice and
 stylish for you," I say with a shrug.

 "It's a brush. Not a magic wand. You know... I've never met a man who
 was so obsessed with his hair. But anyway. What are we doing tonight?"

>talk to audrey

 "Movie night?" asks Audrey. "You want to sit around the house and
 watch a movie? Come on. Really?"

 Pang pops up with his opinion. "Well, <span class="floydstyle em">I</span> want to."

 "Nobody's asking you," says Audrey. Then it hits her that Pang is
 probably going to sit around for the showing. "Your little friend
 isn't around is he, Pang?" She means Criswell.

 "He will be in a minute. The pipes froze and burst next door and
 flooded the kitchen. He's been keeping beer there."

 Audrey doesn't roll her eyes or anything, but it's obvious to me that
 she envisioned something else when I asked her over. I'd love to go
 out somewhere, but I barely have enough gas to get me to work and back
 and I don't get paid until Wednesday. In a storybook world or in some
 kind of made-up <span class="floydstyle em">dream</span> relationship I'd just come correct and
 let her know how broke I was. We could then just play in the snow,
 frolic for a couple hours and eat pieces of our gingerbread house for
 dinner. In the world I reside in, though, in the reality I've made for
 myself that's not an option I have available.

 Pang puts the copy of <span class="floydstyle em">Blade</span> into the DVD player.

>talk to audrey

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

 "What.. aw, hell, what the hell is this, Pang?" asks Criswell, as he
 enters. "Oh, hey, by the way, I don't think we're gonna be able to
 keep beers at the neighbor's house any longer. Someone has begun the
 moving-in process. Wait, did you end up getting this fucking
 <span class="floydstyle em">Blade</span> thing? Oh, Kee-<span class="floydstyle em">rist!</span>"

 I don't understand why Criswell is so against this movie. I guess I
 could ask him, or something, if I really cared. Only I don't. I just
 want him gone.

 "Just watch the movie," says Pang.

 "No!" exclaims Criswell. "I'm gonna make The Call!"

 "You're not going to have a quorum," says Pang.

 "Not especially," she says. "I think I saw it when it first came out."

 "What? Are you kidding me?" I think about the math for a second. "By
 my calculations, you were eight when it came out. You mean to tell me
 that the Neuromancer didn't like you dating me at first because at
 three years your elder, I was a bad example, but he was OK with you
 watching a movie where Snipes hacks apart vampires for 90 minutes?" I
 call her father 'The Neuromancer' because his first name is Henry, and
 the main character of the novel _Neuromancer_ is named Henry Case.
 I've been lucky in not saying it when he's been around so far.

 "I was very mature for my age," she replies. "I think we'd have been a
 perfect match, intellectually, if you met me when I was eight and you
 were twenty-seven.

 "Hey, what about if you met me?" says Criswell.

 "Two," Audrey and I say at the same time.

 Leary walks down the stairs. He gives everyone a 'hey' and waves to
 Audrey.

 "Yo, Leary, what's your take on <span class="floydstyle em">Blade</span>?" asks Criswell.

 Pang's not thrilled about opinions being offered up on his choice
 before the opening credits are even finished.

 "Ehh," says Leary as he picks up the phone to make a call. "Not my
 thing. Nothing personal, Panger."

 "Damn fuckin' straight!" says Criswell. "I'm makin' the call! The Call
 for Ejection! Duffy? What're you saying?"

 I don't know how to go with this one. On one hand, it could mean that
 my movie will get played and these two morons will leave out of
 boredom. On the other hand -- just how freaking immature am I going to
 come across?

>talk to audrey

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

 "The thumb points down, bitchkin!" says Criswell to Pang. It was
 inevitable that he was going to pull the movie no matter what popular
 choice happened to be. Criswell hops over to the DVD player and ejects
 the disc. He places <span class="floydstyle em">The Truman Show</span> in. "We're now starin'
 down the barrel of a whole lotta giggles," he says to Audrey.

 I keep one eye trained underneath the sofa in case Audrey's rolling
 eyes pop out of her head.

 "What are you talking about?" she says. Audrey has never, ever liked
 Criswell. "This is a drama, not a ninety minute episode of 'White Guys
 Gone Jostling.'" Criswell's head strains to the side as he
 simultaneously doesn't believe her and doesn't comprehend her.

 Audrey continues. "You know what drama is, right? It's the name given
 to a movie that <span class="floydstyle em">adults</span> tend to enjoy, as well as being the
 standard root cause of every Linkin Park song."

 "Yeah, whatever." Criswell shrugs. "I bet you Truman here is making
 like he's talking out of his ass before the opening credits are
 finished."

 "Pretty well, actually." Audrey is in the last year of Medical School.
 It's taken her forever to finish up, but I guess that's normal for
 would-be doctors. "They are having a dress-up party in my department
 for Martin Luther King day in a couple weeks, you know. You should
 come."

 "Who do you have to dress up as?"

 "Someone who did something positive for civil rights."

 "So you could dress up as someone who freed the slaves, then, right?"

 "Sure. You'd look cute, I think, if you had that Abraham Lincoln-style
 beard for a few days."

 "Ah! Ah-ha. Yes." I don't bother to tell her that I was thinking more
 along the lines of Cameron Maj?re than Lincoln, which is probably for
 the best.

 Five minutes elapse. The only possession Criswell has left is the
 dumbfounded look upon his face.

 Minute seven comes and Pang can't help himself any longer.

 "You stupid, simple... <span class="floydstyle em">child</span>," he says, quietly. "Next week
 go get <span class="floydstyle em">Good Will Hunting</span> -- Robin Williams is hilarious in
 it." Pang points his thumb down.

 She doesn't say anything. She just nods, looking straight ahead. I
 can't really blame her... these two idiots are really getting in my
 way tonight, and ruining everything.

 Leary turns around from his phone call and squints a bit at the TV. He
 chuckles, points his own thumb down for a second and then turns back
 away from the living room. Pang wiggles the Vecna's Hand toy around
 with its thumb pointing down in order to taunt Criswell just a bit
 more.

 Pang gets up to change the movie.

 He places in <span class="floydstyle em">Lord of the Rings</span>, apparently without really
 recognizing what it is. The intro starts. Audrey lets out a sigh. I
 have no idea if I'm correctly interpreting it, but I'm guessing that
 she's resigned herself to at least watching the movie on the TV
 screen.

 "What the shit is this?" asks Criswell. "More fuckin' ghouls and orcs
 and shit?"

>wait

 Time passes...

 Pang and Criswell both put their thumbs down as Leary leaves.

 "What are you two doing?" I ask. "There aren't any other movies. We
 didn't get any."

 "Someone has forgotten our massive porn collection," says Pang,
 matter-of-factly.

 "Oh, for Heaven's sake," says Audrey. She gets off the couch and
 leaves the room, heading towards my bedroom. Not, I should say, in a
 'let's go make out' way or a 'we need to talk' way but in a
 pre-emptive strike on a fight way.

 "What's her problem?" asks Criswell, to Pang. "We've got
 chick-on-chick stuff."

 I've got a fairly high boiling point, but I've absolutely had it with
 these two. The frustrations concerning the fact that my bad decisions
 and sloth have forced me into this decision boils right over. I decide
 it's time to probably let them have it.

>wait

 Time passes...

>enter bedroom


 <span class="floydstyle em">Bedroom</span>
 My bedroom's the smallest one in the house. (I got here last so I got
 the skankiest room.) There's not a whole lot going on in here, just
 some shelves with all my crap on it and a bed. It smells a bit less
 like cigarettes than it used to since I have gone a week and a half
 since my last one.

 "It's got to stop, Jarret. You know that."

 Eight years ago I was a sophomore at Syracuse University. I had not
 only barely gotten in, but barely survived my first year. My grade
 point average was a 1.8. (Well, 1.78; I used to always round that up.)
 My father had two main tenets when it came to raising me: obedience
 and grades. The first half of my sophomore year I failed all my
 classes except for Organic Chemistry Lab and Mythologies II. (Chem Lab
 was because I was fucking the teaching assistant; bitch still only
 gave me a B-.) When my father got my semester's grades in the mail he,
 for the first time, didn't go berserk or explode in a wave of
 profanity. He simply shrugged and said 'it's got to stop.'

 It feels just the same as Audrey saying it now.

 Please select one:

 (1) "What? Come on, we were just goofing around in there."

 "Well it's not funny!" she says. "And I can't think of any substance I
 could take that would make those idiots 'funny.' I could give you the
 formula and arrangement of at least a hundred molecules off the top of
 my head, and not a single one can be ingested in sufficient quantities
 that would make what went on in there 'funny' without killing me
 first."

 The thing about dating smart girls, I should tell you, is that you
 don't feel half as bad when they attempt to humiliate you. Audrey and
 I also give each other plenty of time to finish our sentences, which I
 think is something that we both require more than oxygen, fresh water,
 and C6 H... er, 12, and O... well, glucose, anyway.

 "Spending time is normally fun with you, Jarret. Doing date-type
 things. Even studying when you were still going to uni. But this
 middle-age sitting-around watching-DVDs thing... I'm just not ready
 for every day to be like this."

 "To Texas... I'm going to Texas. Houston, specifically. A company from
 there sent some recruiters up over Christmas Break and most of us in
 my program interviewed well. After I finish up this semester I am
 taking a job with them and headed down there."

 "Uh... okay." <span class="floydstyle em">Don't you break down, Duffy. Do not let this girl</span>

 "Really?" she says, a bit annoyed at my attitude. "And why's that?
 You're not worried about losing your seniority at that shithole you
 work at, are you?"

 "No! Jesus. It's not that. But look at it from my perspective. Why
 would I move to a city where I know exactly nobody?"

 "You'd know me."

 "Besides you."

 "Some of my friends from class are headed down there. They like you."

 "I understand," she says.

 Technically, I had a couple hours before I was due at work, but I
 might as well go in early and pick up some overtime.
 "We can talk about this after I get out of there, right?"

 "Of course," she says. Again, in her terse form of communicating more
 without words than with.

 "I get out at eleven. Gibs might want me to do his radio show but I
 will blow it off if so. I'll give you a call when I get home, okay?"

 She nods, gives me a hug and leaves my room.

>out


 <span class="floydstyle em">Living Room</span>
 This room is centered around the television, a 32" Sony that Leary
 brought when he moved in. The set sits on a wooden entertainment
 center, with 'satellite' speakers all around the room. The tattered
 white couch is perpendicular to the set, and the blue one (where Pang
 normally situates himself) is eight or nine feet directly across from
 it.
 On the tattered couch are the green blanket and the pillow.  Sitting
 on the entertainment center are the television and the DVD player.
 Inside the DVD player is the Lord of the Rings DVD.  Sitting on the
 table are Vecna's hand, the Dreamcast, the bottle of wine, a cup, the
 Blade DVD, and the The Truman Show DVD.
 Criswell, Pang, and Audrey are here.

 "Oh, Jesus Christ!" exclaims Audrey. "What the hell are you two chimps
 doing? <span class="floydstyle em">Goddess,</span> I don't need this shit. Goodbye!"

>out

 (opening the porch door first)
 Opened.

 Audrey strides out the open door. I shake my head at my horrible home
 life and leave for work...
 I'm still rather pissed off when I pull up into the Mall parking lot
 and showroom park my car. What kind of game is Audrey playing here?
 Surely she's bluffing. We've gone to Defcon 2 or maybe 3 before, but
 we were always able to talk one another down before the bombshells
 were dropped.

 I didn't want to have to go into work tonight worrying about this kind
 of crap. My job becomes a lot easier when I'm able to turn off the
 parts of my mind that don't deal with twenty-sided dice, Player's
 Handbooks and noticing customer body odor. The greatest curse you can
 inflict upon someone who works at the Mall is getting them to fret.

 (And the greatest curse you can inflict upon yourself while at the
 Mall is to attempt to stop smoking. I seriously picked a bad week for
 it.)

 I walk down to the east end of the Mall, avoid the guy taking surveys,
 and enter my store.

 Trott had been working the evening shift; I greet him and take my
 usual place behind the counter. There's really no reason for two of us
 to close the store, except that Benji (the owner) is still a little
 freaked after someone tried to blow up his arcade next door a couple
 of weeks ago. It's unlikely that we'll have any customers, though, so
 Trott and I should be able to logout the register and drop the gate
 quickly when the time comes.

 "Fair enough," I say with a shrug. Why get into it with him? "What's
 up, anyway?"

 "I need you to come on the air tonight. After you get done here and
 everything. Both of my interviews fell through so I need to make this
 an all-comedy night."

 I've gone by the studio with Barnaby a couple times before. Though
 previously I've known in advance and could brush up on the various
 crimes committed by NFL players.

 "I dunno, Gibs... I haven't been paying much attention as of late, I
 don't even know who's going to be in the Super Bowl."

 "You'll do fine!" he says. "Tavarian Pittman was identified as a
 participant in a snuff film earlier today! All we're going to do is

 "Private would be fantastic," says says, quickly. She takes my hand

 "Hey, look," I start, "About before -- "

 "Oh, no," she says, "This isn't about that. We can get some coffee
 when you get out of work and talk about that. No, Sydney and Casey
 wanted me to ask you a favor. They are having difficulties getting
 their register to interface with the mainframe tonight. Something is
 broken with their PC. They thought maybe you could look at it for
 them."

 I am crazy about this girl, and I guess I will always be and
 everything, but her coming over here to get me to do work for her
 friend's store is kind of cold. "Isn't Mall Security supposed to
 handle that?" It's not really that I don't want to help, I tell
 myself, as much as that I'll look like a jerk in front of a small

 "They only have one guy working now, what with Christmas Rush being

 "Which one? I know one or two girls that work there."

 "Not one that works there. He's obsessed with with one of the giant
 push-up bra posters in the window."

 "Fan-<span class="floydstyle em">tastic</span>," she says, with more than a hint of
 exasperation. "Let's go." I wave to Trott in order to inquire if it's
 OK if I leave the store. He gives me a nod. We run this store through
 a regime of efficient hand-signals and basic telepathy. Gibs perks up
 at all of this.

 "Hey, I'm coming along," he says.

 "No, you're not," replies Audrey.

 "You're out of your mind if you think I'm missing a chance to hang out
 with the girls at the <span class="floydstyle em">Bead</span> Store, Yoko," says Gibs.

 Audrey turns to make what I predict to be a sharp comment, but I try
 to defuse the situation first. "Audrey isn't anybody's Yoko fucking
 Ono, Gibs. That doesn't even make any sense, since she's not bringing
 me down, making me dress poorly, stopping me from shaving and bathing,
 or getting me shot in New York City. She's not the Yoko to my Lennon,
 not the Delilah to my Samson. No, what she is, is -- "

 "I'm going to prepare some vomit bags in case you say she's the
 Laurana to your Tanis," says Trott from behind the counter. He's
 referring to the male and female lead of the <span class="floydstyle em">Dragonlance</span>

 games you can play on the thing in a green and black color scheme.

 Benji (the same guy who is my boss as well) keeps them outside the

 experience into buying a larger-ticket item. Either that, or they are
 placed outside the arcade to balance the weight of the dozen, ancient,
 hulking arcade games inside it. Either / or.

 There's only one more stretch of corridor on this level before one
 gets to the elevator, which leads down to the ground floor. To the
 south of this area is the Bead Store, exits otherwise lead west and
 east.

 Gibs and Audrey follow me.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Bead Store</span>
 I part aside a dense curtain of strung-together beads and enter the
 store. The Bead Store has always had a unique odor among the shops on
 this block of the Mall -- it smells strongly of incense and old
 marijuana. The owner of this place has a sweetheart deal on the rent
 along with clearance from the Fire Marshall that allows her to burn
 all manner of scent sticks popular with Wiccans and hippies.

 There are shelves on all sides of the store, but none in the middle of
 the store due to the drawn pentagram.

 On the far side of the store is the register counter, and next to
 that, the broken PC that Audrey wanted me to take a look at.
 Alongside the shelves is a tall crystal ball holder.
 Sydney and Casey are here.

 Gibs and Audrey follow me.

>examine sydney

 Sydney is a very feisty and sarcastic blonde, and close friend of
 Audrey's.

 Casey and Sydney hold each other's hands along the edge of the
 pentagram. I give Gibs a nudge and a thumbs-up sign.

 "So, Barnaby," says Casey, "Would you like to help us in our little
 seance?"

 Audrey gives Casey a dirty look.

 "What?" murmurs Casey to Audrey, "You're the one who told me I was
 gonna get a boyfriend at the mall."

 "I'd be delighted to help out," says Barnaby. "I've never done this
 before, so just let me know what to do and where to go. Did I mention
 that I am famous? I'm famous."

>examine casey

 She has brown eyes and jet-black, though obviously dyed, hair. She is
 wearing a textbook goth outfit, complete with the black fingernails,
 eyeliner and steel-toed boots. She looks dark, mysterious, dangerous
 and completely off her rocker.

 The blonde (Sydney) gets Audrey, Gibs and Casey situated just how she
 wants them. "I memorized the passage we need to incant," she says to
 them. "You, the new guy, just don't speak out of turn. There are four
 names you need to remember. They are Nysrogh, Verin, Valafar and
 Cyramoir. We say them in an order based on just who we are trying to
 raise. Can you remember those names?"

 "He's a sports geek," says Audrey, "He can remember the average number
 of cup adjustments a player for the Nukes makes in a game -- He can
 remember this."

 "I'll be fine," beams Gibs.

>get ball

 I can't separate the crystal ball from the crystal ball holder.

 The girls and Gibs continue the summoning ritual...

 "Nysrogh, we are not fit for your attention, milord," sings Casey,
 sweetly.

>examine pc

 The register computer is run by an ancient Pentium IV-based processor
 within a mini-ATX case. It, like all register computers, connects to
 the Mall hub via a serial cable in the back.

 The girls and Gibs continue the summoning ritual...

 With the girls' eyes closed, I take the opportunity to check out their
 bodies. These three can seriously fill out a costume.

>examine serial cable

 Hmm... it looks like it's been plugged into the computer incorrectly.
 I could probably fix it.

 The girls and Gibs continue the summoning ritual...

 Sydney keeps mumbling in some sort of inane chant.

>fix cable

 I take a look at the back of the computer. The serial cable has been
 shoved into the back panel of the case. I'm not a hardware guru, but I
 can count pins and figure out where most stuff goes. I look over to
 the girls to tell them what the problem is, but they are holding one
 another's hands trying to engage in some pseudo-religious summoning
 ceremony. I fail at stifling an eye roll and give the serial cord a
 gentle tug. Nothing happens, as it's quite stuck. I pull a little
 harder, but still nothing. I decide to get a bunch of slack on the
 cord and give it a forceful yank --

 The serial cord rips free from the back of the computer! I see,
 briefly, that it was attached to some sort of small plug-in card that
 was squirreled away inside the box.

 The force of pulling on the cord launches the card behind me. It falls
 into the pentagram that the girls and Gibs are around.

 The girls and Gibs continue the summoning ritual...

 "Verin, love, do not forget us this dark eve, we miss you so..."
 chants Sydney, slowly.

 There is a sudden and quick flash of fire and light a second after the
 cable lands on the floor!

 A deafening boom accompanies it -- the five of us fall right to the
 floor.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle em">Bead Store, on the floor</span>
 The Bead Store smells strongly of incense and stale joints, and it
 almost overpowers every other sense. There are shelves on all sides of
 the store, but none in the middle of the store due to the drawn
 pentagram.

 On the far side of the store is the register counter, and next to
 that, the broken PC that Audrey wanted me to take a look at.
 Alongside the shelves is a tall crystal ball holder.
 Sydney, Casey, Gibs, and Audrey are here.  Gibs has Gibs's lacrosse
 stick.

 Gibs stirs for a bit, and gives everyone in the room a look of
 disgusted confusion. He leaves a rather pregnant pause. He finally
 gives his own comment on the explosion: "What... <span class="floydstyle em">the fuck</span>...
 was that?

 Audrey slowly picks herself up off the ground. I crawl over towards
 her. "Did you..." she starts. She sees the cable in the middle of the
 floor.

 "That was incredible!" says Casey, as she gets up and dizzily staggers
 around. "We <span class="floydstyle em">have</span> to do that again!"

>get holder

 I'm carrying too much to take that.

 Audrey, Gibs, and Casey are all up after the knockdown. Sydney is
 still down and out, though.

 "Syd?" asks Audrey. "You okay? Syd?" Audrey picks up the serial cable
 from the floor. "Oh, no..." she stumbles back as if something cut her
 legs out from underneath her. She knocks her head up against the
 counter and slumps to the ground without displaying a bit of evidence
 that she felt any pain. She stares ahead, so vacant...

 She snaps out of it. She looks up to me. "Jarret... " She swallows --
 hard. "I think we summoned something. I think we summoned a
 <span class="floydstyle em">ghost.</span>"

 If anyone else had said it at any other time I would have began a
 sarcastic riff. But she's not kidding around. "Are you okay? Did you
 hurt your head at all -- " She shakes her head in the negative. "Look,
 I'll check on Sydney, OK? Just relax, just stay still for a second..."
 Sydney is the only one still unconscious.

>wake sydney

 I get up off the floor and go over towards Sydney in an attempt to
 wake her up. I place my hand on her shoulder... and suddenly her eyes
 snap open. She recognizes me quickly and gives me a look which
 communicates that she could have me at <span class="floydstyle em">any time she wished</span> in
 a split-second.

 Her eyes begin to swirl. She begins to turn transparent, she starts to
 float... she rises off the ground, breaking the look of pure sex and
 hypnotism that she shared with me, and looking over the others.

 "Always the inadvertent knight in shining armor, no, Jarret?" she
 whispers. It's still Sydney's voice, but softer, much more melodic.

 "Syd?" asks Audrey. "Are you --"

 "Oh, I feel <span class="floydstyle em">wonderful,</span>" she says, answering the question
 before Audrey can finish it. "It has been so long since I have walked
 among you all... Too long. I have forgotten how good it feels to take
 a breath of air rather than soot..."

 She crosses her legs and raises herself a bit higher. She begins to
 slightly glow.

>examine holder

 It's a wooden stand, roughly four feet in height. It has three
 protruding grips on top to hold a smallish crystal ball (which is
 present). The base is circular in shape and rather thick.

 An animate human skeleton staggers into the store from outside. Its
 walk is slow, considered and focused, as if controlled by an
 inexperienced puppeteer. It has in its fingers a bloody and seeping
 severed head, which it discards to one side of the room.

 Audrey lets out a quick scream of shock when she sees it hobble in,
 and I grab her arm and get her behind me. The skeleton's head swivels
 quickly from right to left as it gives the four of us on the ground a
 haunting peer.

 I scan the room and recall what's in my pockets and trying to find a
 decent weapon.

>take holder

 I'm carrying too much to take that.

 The skeleton attacks and hits me!

>hit skeleton with xbox

 That object cannot be used in melee combat.

>attack skeleton

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Choke it all down!"</span> I scream. I hit the skeleton!

 The skeleton screeches horribly -- a dry, dusty rasp somehow escaping
 from its ribs and jaw.

 The skeleton attacks and hits me!

>status

 I have a few minor scratches but am otherwise fine.

 The skeleton attacks and hits me!

>kick head

 I cruelly break the severed head!

>drop all. take holder.

 Taken.

 The skeleton attacks and hits me!

>hit skeleton with holder

 I clobber the skeleton with the crystal ball holder.

 (The crystal ball holder breaks as a result, and I throw it down.)

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Choke it all down!"</span> I scream.

 The skeleton collapses and falls to the ground.

 "Excellent, Jarret," Sydney rasps to me, from above. "It could not
 handle being hit that way..."

 "Skeletons are susceptible to blunt attacks." I shrug in a despondent
 attempt to mask my fear. "Y'know, Syd, I was thinking of just pulling
 off my trousers there for a second and breaking it into kibble with
 the Hammer of Thunderbolts that lives in my pants, but I didn't want
 to knock down all my friends in the process."

 She ignores my comment, as if unable to process it and feeling me not
 worthy of inquiry. The skeleton's weakness has been in every revision
 of the <span class="floydstyle em">Monster Manual</span> over the years. It's one of the first
 --

 "It's one of the first things you learn when playing D&D," says
 Sydney. A terrible smile crosses her face.

 It's terribly effective.

 I try to show no fear. (No additional fear, anyway.) "But that's an
 artifact of the game," I say. "It's a made-up construct. Something to
 give them a little more personality. There's no real-world basis for
 any of it." Keep thinking, Duffy, keep your mind busy, don't let this
 telepath get into your hea--

 "Probably not," she says. Her eyes turn empty and glow. "But who can
 tell? You have complicated my return slightly, but not for much
 longer. The look into your mind I obtained when we touched was so
 insightful. You're made up of so many deep, arbitrary little undead
 rules, rules you need to learn and exceptions you need to note."

 "What? Those aren't mine! I didn't make them!"

 "They will be. They are. You will find this place governed by them
 when you return to it. My power within this world will grow and that
 should keep you busy..."

 The room becomes much colder. Barnaby grabs me by the collar and leads
 the four of us out of the Bead Store.
 Gibs drags me out of the Bead Store as I try to plead with Sydney (or
 whatever is possessing her) to use anybody else as her template
 tonight, to give us back our friend, to let us all go. The room just
 keeps getting colder, and my words and breath form puffy clouds that
 fall short of reaching her. She never wavers in her silent smirk.

 We leave the Bead Store and collect ourselves out in the foyer. Most
 of the lighting in the Mall is now completely gone; lit instead by the
 moon through the skylights.

 "Fuck this fucking mall," says Gibs. "Let's go get Trott and get the
 fuck out of here. Jesus Fucking Christ."

 "I don't think we can just leave," says Audrey.

 "Why not?"

 "The thing that possessed Sydney said that the Mall will be governed
 by the arbitrary rules she found floating about in my head," I say.
 "With the showing of the skeleton, I think she means the undead
 rules."

 "What undead rules?" asks Gibs. "What are they, specifically? Which
 undead are we going to encounter? What will they act like?"

 "Who <span class="floydstyle em">are</span> all you people?" says Casey in a voice like Gibs's,
 making fun of all his questions.

 "There's a progression," I say. "In the D&D undead table, it goes
 skeleton, zombie, ghoul, shadow, ghast or wight, wraith, mummy,
 spectre, vampire, ghost, lich... and then 'special.'"

 Gibs reflects on that for a couple seconds. "Ah. Sure. Special like
 Special Olympics, or -- "

 "Special like they can kill with a scream or single touch."

 "Yeah." Gibs shrugs. "I guess that's pretty special."

 "Wait," says Casey. "Do you hear that? There's something groaning out
 there, in that direction." She points to the west. "Can you guys hear
 it? It sounds like there's a lot of them."

 "I'll get us out of here," I say, quietly. I don't know if the others
 are paying attention to me. "I'll keep us all safe..."

 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side Corridor</span>
 There's only one more stretch of corridor on this level before one
 gets to the elevator, which leads down to the ground floor. To the
 south of this area is the Bead Store, exits otherwise lead west and

 Audrey, Casey, and Gibs are here.  Gibs has Gibs's lacrosse stick.

>examine cards

 The cards are used in a game called 'Magic:The Gathering.' It's sort
 of like poker for nerds, except that the cards have special powers and
 so forth. I've never really gotten into it. Anyway, this is a small
 box containing wrapped packs of cards. There are about fifty or so in
 a box.

>unwrap cards

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "unwrap" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side of the Mall</span>
 I'm at the eastern side of the Mall. To the north is Choad's Sporting
 Goods. My store is a bit to the east, and the Bead Store a bit to the
 west.

 There is a table here, set adjacent to the Sporting Goods store.

 Gibs goes over to the gate of the Sporting Goods store and gives it a
 tug. "It's locked... what, do all the gates fall down when the power
 goes out or something?"

 "That's my understanding, yes." I casually inspect the gate. "Ever
 since somebody brought a bomb into the arcade there have been a host
 of security procedures not in other, normal malls. Trott knows how to
 work the security console, though. Let's go find him."

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Eastern End of the Mall</span>
 This is far east as the Mall goes. The Mall technically dips a bit as
 one goes west, as it was originally constructed upon a landfill.
 There's a three-sided advertising kiosk in the middle of the corridor.

 To the west is the Beads Store, Sporting Good Outlet and the (closed)
 Arcade.

 My store, the Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium, is to the south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Benji's Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium</span>
 My store is covered in darkness and shadows, giving it a far more
 foreboding look than it's otherwise ever had.

 The rest of the Mall is to the north. The door to the back room leads
 east.

>go east

 (opening the back office door first)
 Okay, the door is now open.
 I enter the back office hand-first, groping for the light switch. I
 find it, but flipping it has no effect. This act is not lost on Gibs.

 "Good work, there, Tesla," he says, albeit rather quietly. "The
 electricity is out everywhere."

 It takes a moment, but our eyes adjust to the darkness.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Back Office</span>
 The back office is made up of a number of shelves which hold boxes of
 'Magic' game cards, and other stock we don't want out by the
 customers. There's barely enough room for two people to stand
 side-by-side here.  There are two exits, one back to the store and one
 that leads to the garbage hall (and eventually, beyond that, to the
 security area).
 Sitting on the shelves is a cardboard box.

 "Trott's not here..." I say to Gibs.

 Gibs doesn't say anything. I turn back to look at him and his face has
 blanched. He snaps out of it but doesn't look at me. He points ahead
 and whispers, "Look at the window to the door, Duffy..."

>look out window

 I can't see through that.

>look at window

 I creep up to the window of the hallway door and take a closer look at
 it. A bloody handprint has been smeared  upon the other side.

>look in box

 Inside the cardboard box is the gaming glove.

>look in box

>get glove

 I slip on the thick, pleather gaming glove. I begin to feel downright
 sexy.

>examine handprint

 Well, five fingers are there, and there seems to be no doubt that they
 were covered in blood when they were pressed up against the other side
 of the glass.

>examine glove

 The Sierra Hobbies Gaming Glove is an inky black novelty gaming
 companion for the hurried Games Master. It's full of mnemonics,
 scribbled shortcuts and tables to allow for a smoother (and more
 stylish) game of D&D. No Dungeon Master that takes his craft seriously
 should be without!

 I'm currently wearing the gaming glove.

>read glove

 I can't do that with the gaming glove.

>search shelves

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "shortcuts" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>exits

 There's an exit north to the Garbage Hall, or west to Benji's Gaming
 and Role-Playing Emporium.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Garbage Hall</span>
 Gibs and I enter the long hallway that sits behind a number of stores.
 It's here to allow us to drop off whatever cardboard and trash we
 accumulate during the day for janitorial services. I know from memory
 that there is a door on the east side that opens into a sort of
 mini-lounge for the mallcops, but there isn't enough light to really
 make it out very well.

>go east

 (opening the second corridor door first)
 Opened.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mallcop Lounge</span>
 The Lounge is far more spacious than the last few areas, and has
 enough room for a couple of couches, a television, a big plant, and a
 water cooler.

 On the far side of the room is a door which leads to a long walkway
 (on the other side of which, I think, is the actual Mall Security
 headquarters).

 "This isn't what I expected a Mall lounge to look like," says Gibs.

>examine cooler

 The water cooler usually holds a few gallons of water, but it's
 currently empty. Busting up urchins all day makes a man
 <span class="floydstyle em">thirsty</span>, narmean?

>examine plant

 It's just a generic pink pot that can store green vegetation and
 wildlife. It's about half a foot in diameter.

>go east

 I can't go that way.  I can go west to the garbage hall or north to
 the mall back hallway.

>examine television

 The TV is 19" in size or thereabouts, quite small, really. It doesn't
 work due to the lack of power in this section of the Mall.

>search couches

 I don't need to refer to that.

>go north

 (opening the lounge door first)
 Opened.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall Back Hallway</span>
 This hallway is strangely shaped, and I am unable to make out
 everything within it. On the far side of the hall is a door that leads
 to the Security Room, but I can only barely make it out from here. The
 only real items in the room are a pair of doors and a large
 garden-variety plant in the corner.

 There is no transparent moon roof or anything in this room, so Gibs
 sticks his lacrosse stick up against the door so that we get light
 from the Lounge.

 "Do you think Trott got into the Security Room?" asks Gibs. "Do you
 think he made it this far?"

>examine plant

 It's comprised of a large potted base filled with soil, and a leafy,
 oversized garden plant of some unknown (to me, anyway) variety.

 Taking a closer look at the plant reveals a zombie hiding behind it!

 "What the fuck is that?" says Gibs. "Jesus -- look out, Duffy!" Gibs
 rips the lacrosse stick from the doorjamb. The resident light
 disappears as the door closes and locks with a click and I can only
 make out a quick glance of the creature before us before we're
 enveloped in complete darkness.

 Gibs takes a roundhouse swing at the creature with his stick. He
 doesn't connect, though. The creature emits a hoarse groan. I can hear
 it shuffling closer.

>examine plant

 It's comprised of a large potted base filled with soil, and a leafy,
 oversized garden plant of some unknown (to me, anyway) variety.

 "Get me some goddamn light!" shouts Gibs. I hear him struggle a bit
 more. "Hit this fucking thing!" I hear Gibs begin to gurgle and choke.

 Gibs's lacrosse stick falls to the floor -- Gibs never managed to get
 a shot at the creature with it.

 Waves of stench emit from the creature; it's some sort of dead fish
 and carrion stink that forms a nigh palpable cloud in the room.

>exits

 There are exits to the north and south from here.

 The creature screams deeply and Gibs's arms flail about, knocking me
 to the side. I make out Gibs slumping to the ground as he's let go.
 The thing turns with sudden quickness before beginning to shamble
 towards me with arms outstretched and awkwardly groping for me...

 The creature attacks and hits me!

>hit creature with holder

 The crystal ball holder is broken and useless.

>take stick

 Taken.

 The creature attacks, but misses me!

>hit creature with stick

 I clobber the creature with Gibs's lacrosse stick.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"And then I kicked him in the head till he was dead!"</span> I say,
 quoting <span class="floydstyle em">Baldur's Gate.</span>

 The creature collapses and falls to the ground.

 Gibs slowly staggers up, gently feeling his throat. "Ooof... guess you
 got him. Thanks, man," he says.

 "You bet," I say. "You OK?"

 "Yeah... my throat's a bit sore, but I'll be all right."

>status

 <span class="floydstyle em">Security Room</span>
 We open the door and see Trott bolt right up from his chair.

 "Oh, geez... thank Christ it's you guys. Wait, did you get past that
 -- "

 "Yeah, we did," I say. "I think we killed it."

 I take a look around the room. There's a big console against the west
 wall which controls the gates, electricity and breakers for all the
 shops in the Mall. I imagine that Trott has been trying to get it
 operational for sometime now.
 Trott is here.

 "Well, it took a chunk out of me." Trott lifts his shirt up to show
 some deep claw marks just below his rib cage. "I first saw it when I
 went through the door to our back room. I was able to get back, and it
 started groping at the window every few seconds. I timed it, opened
 the door, and just bolted back here. I sure had no idea where it was
 or if it had followed me... looks like it was just on the other side

 "What do you mean, 'turned into a zombie?' That guy was a nobody. Just

 "No, not like that," I say. "Whatever summoning Audrey was trying
 ended up working. Her friend Sydney is possessed by someone. That
 someone stated that we'd find the Mall governed by the undead rules. I
 guess it's turning the Mall denizens into the undead."

 "When?"

 "When we were fighting that freaking thing," I say.

 "Oh. No," says Trott. "I heard the fighting but I guessed that it was
 another creature or something. I was hoping that you'd all take each
 other out, like when imps start fighting each other in <span class="floydstyle em">Doom</span>."

 "In what?"

 "<span class="floydstyle em">Doom</span>. The game, <span class="floydstyle em">Doom</span>? Don't tell me you don't know
 what <span class="floydstyle em">Doom</span> is. Oh dear. Ohhh, dear."

 "Hey, I don't give you crap for not knowing what Man Down Defense is,"
 I say, trying to use sports knowledge against Trott.

 Trott stops for a beat and calmly says, "That probably didn't come off
 quite as scathing as you thought it would have." Unfortunately, he's
 right. Damn 'im.

 "What? No," says Trott. "I've been here -- what do you mean, a
 'testicle'? Cripes, I -- "

 "I'm just kidding around. Would you have preferred 'gonad'? What did
 you do when the lights went out?"

 "I was in the back room when the lights went out. I heard the
 auto-kick-in for the gate... kick in, so I went out and verified that
 the thing was locked and that it wouldn't open from the inside. What
 happened anyway?"

 "Duffy interrupted his girlfriend's seance," says Barnaby.

 "It wasn't a seance," I say.

 "I know. I just wanted to see if you'd be able to resist
 anal-retentively correcting me."

 Trott waits a bit before he says anything further. He doesn't like
 Gibs much.

 "Anyways," says Trott, "The only way to get out is to get the mallcops
 to let me out. I made my way back through the first door when I saw
 that thing. It took a chunk out of my side, but I eventually got by
 it, ran in here and locked the door. What was that? It wasn't a bot.
 It was wearing the clothes of one of the security guys who works at
 the Mall. But what happened to him?"

 "I think so," he says. "Much of it was damaged before I got here, but

 "Can you raise the gate to the Sporting Goods store?"

 "Ummm," Trott says, as he looks over the console, "Yeah. That one I

 "Okay... " Trott flips a few switches on the console. "It's up."

 "Thanks."

 "OK, before you go, why don't you take this phone? The Mall only pays
 for it to work as a CB radio for the mallcops, but if you need more
 gates raised, just let me know through it."

 "All right, sounds like a plan," I say. "I'll try to keep you posted
 as to what is going on out there."

>talk to trott

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

>out

 I can't go that way.  I can go south to the mall back hallway.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall Back Hallway</span>
 This is an oddly-shaped hallway that connects the Lounge with the
 Security Room. There are doors that lead to both rooms.
 There is a potted plant here.
 The creature is here.

>examine creature

 The thing's face features a dramatic gaping burn wound on the
 forehead, presidentially presiding over a quick voting bloc consisting
 of two or three jagged teeth. It's wearing some tattered mallcop
 clothes, but my expert opinion is that the creature is in fact a
 zombie.

 It  is currently knocked out.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mallcop Lounge</span>
 The Lounge is a largish, open room with a high ceiling. There are a
 couple of old couches here, along with a television, water cooler and
 plant life of unknown make and origin.

 Exits lead north and west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Garbage Hall</span>
 This is a long hallway that sits behind a number of stores. The store
 owners and workers put their trash in this hallway for janitorial
 services. There is a door to the security lounge to the east and a
 door to the back office of Benji's store to the south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Back Office</span>
 The back office is a cramped and tight little room with shelves on
 both sides.

 There are two exits, one back to the store and one that leads to the
 garbage hall (and eventually, beyond that, to the security area).
 Sitting on the shelves is a cardboard box.

>go south

 I can't go that way.  I can go west to Benji's Gaming and Role-Playing
 Emporium or north to the garbage hall.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Benji's Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium</span>
 My store is covered in darkness and shadows, giving it a far more
 foreboding look than it's otherwise ever had.

 The rest of the Mall is to the north. The door to the back room leads
 east.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Eastern End of the Mall</span>
 This is far east as the Mall goes. The Mall technically dips a bit as
 one goes west, as it was originally constructed upon a landfill.
 There's a three-sided advertising kiosk in the middle of the corridor.

 To the west is the Beads Store, Sporting Good Outlet and the (closed)
 Arcade.

 My store, the Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium, is to the south.
 Audrey and Casey are here.

 "Hey, Dungeon Master," says Audrey. "Did you find Trott?"

 "Yeah. He's back operating the security console for us." Huh. 'DM,'
 she said. She normally only calls me that when she's in a good mood
 about our chances.

 "He didn't want to come with you?" she asks.

 "Maybe he would have, but he'll be able to open the gates we want if I
 contact him through this," I show her the phone.

 "Did you guys try the gate at the Sporting Good store already?" asks
 Gibs.

 "No, not yet," says Audrey. "We just got bored waiting for you, so we
 headed over this way."

 "Also," says Casey, "We went over to where the escalator was. You
 wouldn't believe how foul it smells over there!"

 "How bad is it? My previous high score in this department is my
 roommate Pang's custom <span class="floydstyle em">Dance Dance Revolution</span> pad that he
 keeps downstairs and only uses with bare feet in some bizarro-logic
 attempt to keep it 'nice.' I mean, is it worse than -- "

 "It's worse," Audrey says softly, her eyes closed in the pain of the
 persistence of this memory, "Much, much worse."

 I'm at the eastern side of the Mall. To the north is Choad's Sporting

 west.

 There is a table here, set adjacent to the Sporting Goods store.

 Audrey and Casey follow me.

 "This won't take me a moment to sort out," says Gibs. "I'll be in and
 out like a greased German through the Maginot Line."

 "I thought the Germans circumvented <span class="floydstyle em">around</span> the Maginot Line?"
 I say.

 "No. You've got that confused with what they did with the bounds of
 good taste when they collectively invented <span class="floydstyle em">scheisse </span> porn,"
 says Gibs with commanding authority. "Anyway, more importantly, I know
 just where the shotguns would be in this store. Anyone want to come
 with?"

 "I'll go," says Audrey. "I'll try to find some helmets and pads and
 such."

 "Pads?" This is good. Very good. "Oh, so you were able to trickle a
 puck past the five hole with the Detroit Red Wings after all?" I ask
 Audrey.

 "What?" It takes Audrey a moment to translate my intended delicate
 innuendo in her head, but when she does, she's not laughing. "No. I
 meant like shoulder pads and shin guards. For personal defense." She
 pauses for a moment. "What on earth is wrong with you?"

 Whoops. "I'll just, ah, stay out here with Casey, then."

 "I broke up with my boyfriend not too long ago," says Casey. "Other
 than that, nothing much."

 "Hey, really? What brought that on?"

 "He never wanted to go do anything," she says, "But you know what it

 the bill was always right over his eyes. Every time I would try to
 kiss him, I would have to navigate around the thing. Romance shouldn't
 be a frustrating puzzle in three-dimensionality, you know? Sometimes I

 "That's definitely a point in his favor. Make sure he gives me his
 number when we get out of here. I'm tired of being either cooped-in on
 the weekend or hanging out at the Bead Store like tonight."

 "You seem awfully confident that we are going to get out of here."

 "Shouldn't I be? From what Audrey tells me, whatever we resurrected...
 or, I guess, 'surrected' in this case, isn't any match for the geek
 encyclopedia you've got knocking about in that skull of yours." She
 gives me a genuine smile of reassurance and I, to my discredit, don't
 have the heart to tell her that in reality most of the thoughts
 knocking about in my head have to do with how I'm going to get back
 with her best friend.

 Please select one:

 (1) "What does Audrey want from me, then?"

 "You're going to have to ask her that, eventually, Jarret."

 "Yes. I know. Eventually."

 "What does she want? She wants to be with you, in my opinion, anyway.
 I've seen her with other guys in between the dozen or so times you two
 have broken up. She is always so much happier when she is together
 with you. She just lights up when you enter the room, you know that?"

 "I didn't know that." I try to think back the best I can, to try to
 get some sort of visual holographic proof of this, but I just can't.
 Maybe I've just never been paying attention.

 "But she wants to see you take the next step, Jarret." Casey turns and
 looks right into my eyes. "She's going to graduate soon. The future is
 coming and everything. I think, ultimately, what she wants to know is
 if you think you have one."

 I hear Gibs swear violently from within the Sporting Goods store.

 "Jarret!" screams Audrey, <span class="floydstyle em">"Help!"</span>

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Choad's Sporting Goods</span>
 There is a light blue-skinned, feral beast hunched over towards the
 corner of this store. A ghoul, just as how I'd imagine it. It has
 Audrey backed up against the eastern wall. A row of jacket racks
 separates them from me. Gibs is much closer, and seems to be holding
 the ghoul at bay by slowly darting in and out of its range, and
 preventing it from ripping Audrey apart by giving it another target.
 That won't stop it for long. The only thing preventing the ghoul from
 shredding Audrey is its attempt to work out just how he can
 incapacitate and consume them both.
 There is a circular jacket rack here.
 The ghoul, Audrey, and Gibs are here.

 Gibs swears violently.

 "Jarret!" screams Audrey, <span class="floydstyle em">"Help!"</span>

>inventory

 I am carrying my glasses (being worn), some socks, the crystal ball
 holder (broken), the Magic: The Gathering cards, the gaming glove
 (being worn), Gibs's lacrosse stick, and the phone.

 The beast is content, for the moment, to look back between his prey
 and his attacker. I know that at any moment it is going to choose one
 of them to attack first.

>push rack

 Pushing the circular jacket rack doesn't get me anywhere.

 Gibs attacks the ghoul!

 Gibs throws a punch at the thing and connects against its bare jaw.
 Gibs's body begins to seize up. <span class="floydstyle em">It's the paralysis,</span> I think
 to myself. <span class="floydstyle em">He's going to be stiff and unable to defend himself in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">another second.</span>

>hit ghoul with stick

 I clobber the ghoul with Gibs's lacrosse stick.

 I try to wail like a banshee: <span class="floydstyle em">"ooOOooOOOO!"</span>

 The ghoul attacks and hits me!

>examine glove

 The Sierra Hobbies Gaming Glove is an inky black novelty gaming
 companion for the hurried Games Master. It's full of mnemonics,
 scribbled shortcuts and tables to allow for a smoother (and more
 stylish) game of D&D. No Dungeon Master that takes his craft seriously
 should be without!

 I'm currently wearing the gaming glove.

 The ghoul attacks, but misses me!

>take rack

 Taken.

 The ghoul attacks and hits me!

>hit ghoul with rack

 That object cannot be used in melee combat.

>throw rack at ghoul

 I hit the ghoul with the circular jacket rack.

 (The circular jacket rack breaks as a result.)

 I hear a grotesque snapping sound coming from the thing. I completely
 flattened it on that last one!

 I walk over to Audrey. She's shivering.

 "Are you OK?" She nods. "Where did your coat go?" She doesn't say. She
 shakes her head and melts into my arms. I hold her, hug her and bring
 her as close as I can. Her face is buried within my chest and I
 scratch the back of her head and feel her close-cropped hair on her
 neck flick through my fingers. I had no idea if I'd ever feel that
 again, or feel her body, alive and whole, this close to mine. "I'll
 keep you warm," I say with a whisper.

 Casey enters from the entrance to the south. "Ugh," she says, after
 spotting what's left of the ghoul. "What on earth did you do to that
 thing?"

 it. Her body shakes with a quick, stifled bit of laughter. I'm so glad
 she's here with me that it doesn't even occur to me that it must be
 <span class="floydstyle em">killing</span> Gibs to not be able to tell us just how bop we are

>look


 <span class="floydstyle em">Choad's Sporting Goods</span>
 Choad's Sporting Goods exists under the unfortunate circumstance that
 the owner's name translates into Bengali as 'fuck.' Once or twice a
 year there will be a demonstration or protest from a bunch of local
 student Hindus, but nothing ever changes.

 The store is one of the larger ones in the Mall, about 40' wide and
 140' long. Ski jackets take up almost all the area towards the front
 of the store, as far as I can see, with the entire western wall filled
 with displays of discount tennis sneakers.

 There doesn't seem to be any rifles or shotguns for sale. (It appears
 as if Gibs's intuition was incorrect.)
 There is a circular jacket rack here.
 The ghoul, Audrey, Gibs, and Casey are here.

>get jacket

 Which jacket do you mean, the circular jacket rack or the ski jackets?

>ski

 They are essentially permanently part of the circular jacket rack.

>go south

 "Can you watch Gibs for a bit?" I ask Casey.

 "It won't be a problem," she says.

 Audrey goes up to him, still in his frozen state, and gives him a kiss
 on the cheek. "Have a good thaw," she says.

 I take her hand and put it in mine and together we leave the Sporting
 Goods store.

 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side of the Mall</span>
 I'm at the eastern side of the Mall. To the north is Choad's Sporting
 Goods. My store is a bit to the east, and the Bead Store a bit to the
 west.

 There is a table here, set adjacent to the Sporting Goods store.

 Audrey follows me.

 Audrey pulls on my hand, to begin to drag me towards the far side of
 the Mall. "Jarret, let's go this way," she says. "The elevator is on
 the over this way. I think I know how we can get to it."

>follow audrey

 Audrey is right here.

>go south

 I can't go that way.  I can go west to the beginning of the east wing,
 east to the eastern end of the mall, or north to Choad's Sporting
 Goods.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Eastern End of the Mall</span>
 This is far east as the Mall goes. The Mall technically dips a bit as
 one goes west, as it was originally constructed upon a landfill.
 There's a three-sided advertising kiosk in the middle of the corridor.

 To the west is the Beads Store, Sporting Good Outlet and the (closed)
 Arcade.

 My store, the Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium, is to the south.

 Audrey follows me.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side of the Mall</span>
 I'm at the eastern side of the Mall. To the north is Choad's Sporting

 west.

 There is a table here, set adjacent to the Sporting Goods store.

 Audrey follows me.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side Corridor</span>
 There's only one more stretch of corridor on this level before one
 gets to the elevator, which leads down to the ground floor. To the
 south of this area is the Bead Store, exits otherwise lead west and
 east.

 Audrey follows me.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Before the Elevator</span>
 The floor of the Mall comes up against a rail, forming a barrier which
 prevents further (sane) western travel. The bottom (ground floor)
 level can be viewed with ease, though, as the guardrail mainly
 prevents kids -- future productive Mall denizens! -- from ragdolling
 their way off the edge.

 There is a horrific stench in this area. It's new, too -- the guy who
 used to take the surveys always kept himself cheerfully clean.
 There is a kiosk in the center of the hallway. At the far end of the
 rail is an elevator.

 Audrey follows me.

 Audrey quietly points over to the kiosk and whispers right into my
 ear.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Do you see that? Do you see the wraith?"</span>

 I squint. The lighting is so dark... I don't see it. I adjust my
 glasses and still nothing. I shake my head in the negative.

 Audrey takes my hand in hers and we duck into the Jewelry Store...
>look
 Audrey takes my hand in hers and we duck into the Jewelry Store...
 <span class="floydstyle em">Jewelry Store</span>
 We both press ourselves flat up against the wall of the Jewelry Store.

 "How are we to get past the wraith, Jarret?" Her eyes dart down and to
 the side as she tries to remember if she ever encountered one in a
 role playing game. "... I can't remember," she says.

 "Sunlight, and I don't know how long until that will show up." I say.
 Was there really a wraith there? Outside the store? I didn't see a
 thing. It is colder down this way than it was in the rest of the Mall,
 though. "Yeah. Sunlight is the only thing I'm 100% positive on, maybe
 there are others." I strain to try to remember, but I haven't used a
 'wraith' character in any games that I've played in a very long time.
 I'm certain there are other ways... I just can't recall.
 Sitting on the tabletop is a pleather purse.

>take purse

 Taken.

>open purse

 The pleather purse is already open.

 A bit of smoke and haze begins to form against the eastern wall.

>search purse

 Inside the pleather purse is the silver comb.

 Audrey looks over to the east wall. "What do you think... what is
 that, Jarret?" she whispers.

 I can't quite tell at first, but as the haze beings to form more
 familiar shapes, it starts to dawn on me.

 "It's a vision," I tell her.

 Displayed on the west wall of the Jewelry Store is a scene. I can make
 out Gibs and Audrey clearly... there seems to be one or two other
 figures moving in the background.

 "That's a scene from that tournament we went to, isn't it?" asks
 Audrey.

>comb wraith

 Better start with a verb.

>take comb

 Got it. Ooh, silvery!

 Audrey continues to look at the vision. The scene takes on a greater
 contrast, with muted blues smeared together in fog with darker earth
 colors.

 "Why... what's up with Gibs giving you a thumbs-up sign? This vision
 takes place from your perspective, doesn't it?"

 "I just made what was my sixth straight saving throw. He gave me a
 thumbs-up because I was using loaded dice."

 "What?!" says Audrey, and then instantly brings her voice down a
 couple levels due to the wraith. "What the hell do you mean, you were
 <span class="floydstyle em">using loaded dice?</span>"

 "I ordered some red 20 sided dice before the tourney over the
 Internet. They were weighted to give out mostly 18s, 19s and 20s.
 What? What's the big deal? That was years ago!"

 "Ssh!" Audrey puts her hand over my mouth. "The big deal is that the
 Tourney is where we met! Do you think I would want to go out with you
 if you were cheating everybody in the room?"

 "Oh come on, don't start this bullshit. It wasn't like I was at
 DragonCon or something. Christ!"

 "No. You weren't. You were cheating your friends. That makes it worse,
 you know."

>examine vision

 I haven't seen anybody like that.

>talk to audrey

 Please select one:

 (1) "Oh, what does it matter if I cheated at the tourney?"
 (2) "C'mon, you have to admit it's pretty funny."

>2


 "Oh, it's hilarious, all right," says Audrey. "You know me. There's
 nothing I find funnier than stories of the guy that I've been with for
 the last five years ripping off everyone I know like a unconscionable
 rogue at a lawless bazaar."

 "The Wizards of the Coast were going to give that to me anyway. The
 dice didn't really change anything, other than the fact that I made a
 few extra saving throws and got a few extra hits in. You have to
 appreciate the return on the investment, at least."

 "Oh, sure. You're a regular Gordon Gecko," says Audrey.

 "I can't believe you're comparing me to white collar criminals."

 "I can't believe you essentially commit white collar crime." Audrey
 shrugs her shoulders.

 The ether(?) that makes up the vision dissipates completely and it
 completely disappears.

 Audrey sits herself up against the east wall of the store.

 "So you found a comb, I see," says Audrey. "Maybe you can do something
 with that mound of straight hay on top of your head with it." She
 gives me a smile after she says that to let me know it was said with
 affection.

 "It's a silver comb," I tell her. "I'm sure it's quite valuable."

 "Isn't silver a type of bane to wraiths?" asks Audrey.

 I try to bring up the memory of what affects wraiths from the back of
 my mind, but my memory is hardly photographic. "I think you're right,"
 I say to her. "I think it works against a lot of undead. A little
 trinket like this might just scare it off, but that's a big maybe. I
 don't really want to throw the comb and find out."

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

 I took a look over towards the wall that Audrey is leaning up against.
 The shadow that she should be throwing is nowhere near the one that is
 present.

 "Audrey," I whisper, "Do not move. You're not casting a proper shadow.
 I -- "

 "What?" she asks. She moves away from the wall, and sure enough, the
 light that she should be blocking is completely inconsistent with
 what's there.

>show comb to wraith

 Showing the silver comb to wraith doesn't accomplish a whole lot.

 The shadow jumps from the wall!

 The shadow points a long, tapered finger onto Audrey's neck. She
 freezes up as it sucks the strength from her body.

>hit shadow with comb

 I clobber the shadow with the silver comb.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Who else wants a piece of the pain pie?"</span> I ask.

 Upon coming in contact with the silver, the shadow halts in place and
 disintegrates -- it falls to the floor in a little pile of soot-like
 dust. I get down and blow it away in order to properly scatter it into
 nothingness.

 I walk over towards Audrey. She's shivering. "You OK, doll?"

 "Yes," says Audrey, quietly. "It's just so cold in here. I'm sorry. I
 don't mean to complain."

 I embrace her for a few moments and rub my hands over her bare
 shoulders. "I'll keep you warm..." She nods. "Silver definitely worked
 on the shadow," I muse. "It used up the comb, however. But the same
 thing'll work on the wraith. We just need to find more of it. The
 girls that work here (presuming that they didn't rip the place off
 blind before calling it a night) keep all the jewelry locked up in the
 safebox." I point over towards the big locker-style cabinet against
 the western wall of the store. "If we can get the temperature in here
 to be significantly colder, I'm betting that lock will pop."

 "How do we do that?" asks Audrey. She looks over towards the wraith.
 "Oh, no. You don't mean -- "

 "Yes," I say quietly. "Let's get the wraith in here."

 "Jarret, no! You can't be serious!"

 "Jarret! I don't want that thing in here!"

 "Audrey, you know that I will not let it touch you. There's a lock
 just like this one in my store, and it's made of ridiculously poor
 components. Everyone involved in owning a store in this Mall is
 incredibly cheap and only worried about the bottom line and how much
 money they can squeeze out of their customers. I will guarantee you
 that as soon as the temperature is brought down a few degrees Celsius
 that lock is coming off like a prom dress. A lock of this type busted
 earlier today at my store when Gibs placed his iced soft drink next to
 it."

 "Okay..." she says. She kisses me for entirely too brief a time and
 looks right into my eyes. "I trust you."

 I suddenly feel like I can do anything. One scream and the wraith will
 make its way over here.

>scream

 I scream like a housewife in a 50s sitcom coming across a mouse. Like
 an English siren during the blitz. (Like Lorraine Williams surrounded
 by a bunch of pen & paper gamers, even.) And it works. The wraith
 turns round and passes right through the kiosk. It slowly begins to
 come near us.

>break lock

 That doesn't seem to work.

>open cabinet

 I can't open it on my own. The lock, while not incredibly sturdy and
 powerful, is still more than I can crack on my own.

 I hear a voice, strangely disembodied, but one I instinctively know is
 coming from the wraith.

 "oh delightful maiden this will be a wonderful meeting will it not and
 you seem oh so achingly warm and tight and I really only want to get
 close to you for only a moment do not you see how wonderful oh how
 wonderful that will be my darling..."

 The wraith never really stops its sending, but instead meanders about
 a couple different themes. What he's going to do to my girlfriend
 being one of them. (With all the guys who have tried to steal my
 girlfriend over the years, I finally feel I am on somewhat familiar
 territory.)

 The wraith glides a bit closer to the entrance of the Jewelry Store.
 It is already several degrees colder in here.

>open cabinet with stick

 Better start with a verb.

>break cabinet with stick

 I can't really fight that.

>hit cabinet with stick

 I can't really fight that.

>break lock with stick

 The lock is especially designed to be impervious to any and all brute
 attacks.

 The wraith glides further; it's now within the Jewelry Store, but
 still a fair ways away from Audrey.

 The lock to the safebox pops.

 It continues its raving, more in my head than not:

 "your death will be so pleasing my love I promise that getting there
 will be quick and painless I am the only one you can trust you know I
 will always be there for you and never leave your side you and I there
 isn't a thing that we wouldn't be able to do together my lovely witch
 princess all it takes is for you to just sit still that is it just
 another few moments and I will be there and we will be together so
 wonderfully so wonderfully it will be so wonderful...

>take all from cabinet

 Nothing to take.

>take all from safebox

 Nothing to take.

>look in cabinet

 The safebox is closed.

 The wraith sends another meandering rhyme to me...

 "let me tell you of our wonderful death my darling," mentally
 continues the wraith, "you cannot begin to imagine the wonders that we
 will see together everything you could ever want everything that has
 been out of your reach well it is not out of mine it is not out of
 ours let me ask you this my darling a simple question take all the
 time in the world just answer me truthfully... have you ever wanted to
 fly?"

>open safebox

 Done -- it's open.
 Inside the safebox are the handful of silver rings.

 The wraith inches closer to Audrey...

 Amazingly (to me at least) I see Audrey enraptured by the wraith and
 she actually nods her head a little in response to its question. It
 takes all my self-control to not attack the fucking <span class="floydstyle em">nothing</span>
 with my bare hands.

 "of course you have there is no shame in admitting such a thing let me
 tell you my darling just how wondrous it is to float above this city
 this world this plane with nothing holding you down and nothing
 keeping you from doing what you want to do being who you wish to be
 you will see oh how you will see it will not be long now my darling
 just hold yourself I will be there and we will be together..."

>wear rings

 I can't wear the handful of silver rings.

>get rings

 Taken.

 The wraith moves until he is directly in front of Audrey. I won't have
 much time now.

 "hold still my darling this is so much easier when you just stay there
 so beautifully within my own view..."

>throw rings at wraith

 I hit the wraith with the handful of silver rings.

 Upon coming in contact with the charms, the wraith immediately
 atomizes, taking the silver with him into oblivion.

 "That was my <span class="floydstyle em">Treasure Type</span> you were fucking with, creep!" I
 say it even though the wraith is completely blinked out of existence.
 It takes me a fair trice to realize that thing is truly gone. "Let's
 get out of here," I say to Audrey. "Unless you want to get to work on
 raising the temperature of the room with a little bit of body heat."

 To my surprise, she looks back at me with nothing but love. "If I
 thought it could be done," she says, "without it becoming a menage a
 trois with a lurking horror, or a four-way with an undead ettin... you
 know I would." (An ettin is a two-headed beastie in D&D, which elicits
 a smile from me. That's my girl!)

 <span class="floydstyle em">Before the Elevator</span>
 The floor of the Mall comes up against a rail, forming a barrier which
 prevents further (sane) western travel. The bottom (ground floor)
 level can be viewed with ease, though, as the guardrail mainly
 prevents kids -- future productive Mall denizens! -- from ragdolling
 their way off the edge.

 There is a horrific stench in this area. It's new, too -- the guy who
 used to take the surveys always kept himself cheerfully clean.
 There is a badly-cracked kiosk in the center of the hallway. At the
 far end of the rail is an elevator.

 Audrey follows me.

 Barnaby and Casey come up to us as we leave...

 "Heya there, Duffy," says Gibs, no longer paralyzed. Casey is with
 him. "Any luck with the elevator?"

 "Not yet. We encountered a vision , shadow and wraith, though."

 "So what's changed?" asks Gibs.

 "Well, the Jewelry Store is open and the makeup kiosk is broken down.
 Other than that..."

>examine kiosk

 The makeup kiosk is a business that operates in a very small rectangle
 in the middle of the Mall corridor. Girls (and in this town, a
 not-insignificant number of goth guys) stop by to pretty themselves up
 for their dates and/or midnight angstings.

 It looks like the intense cold of the wraith passing through the kiosk
 caused the thing to crack open.

 Inside the makeup kiosk is a bottle of perfume.

 Gibs spits once off the guardrail because he's a filthy, disgusting
 animal at heart.

>take perfume

 I'm carrying too much to take that.

 I am carrying my glasses (being worn), some socks, the crystal ball

 Gibs spits once off the guardrail because he's a filthy, disgusting

>examine it

 (assuming you mean the bottle of perfume)
 This bottle of perfume is a fairly large container of the Elizabeth
 Arden perfume 'True Love' (A feminine scent that is a blend of lotus,
 iris and jasmine, recommended for office wear.)

 A girl who worked at my D&D store for a season used to wear this
 scent, and it was all I could concentrate on. She'd erode my sense of
 smell regarding all else within a minute of beginning her shift.

>wear perfume

 I can't wear the bottle of perfume.

>open bottle

 I can't do that with the bottle of perfume.

>spray me with perfume

 I spray a bit of the perfume on it. Sek-sai!

>spray perfume on me

 There's not a path in that direction.

 There are exits north to the Jewelry Store, in towards the Elevator
 and east towards the east side of the Mall.

>enter elevator

 Audrey says, "No way. We're not going to follow you until you do
 something about that smell."

 <span class="floydstyle em">Elevator</span>
 The elevator smells terrible, strongly of untreated or unembalmed
 cadavers. There are three buttons here in the elevator labelled 'up,'
 'down' and 'open doors.'

 I'm currently on the <span class="floydstyle em">second</span> level of the Mall. Aside from the
 operational panel, there is little else here in the lift.

 I can see into the corridor ahead, although only a few feet before the
 darkness completely envelopes the hall.

>spray elevator

 I can't spray that.

>spray perfume on elevator

 I can't do that with Elevator.

>spray

 Be a little more specific about what you'd like me to spray.

>spray audrey

 I can't spray that.

>push down button

 I press the down button. After a few seconds, the elevator transports
 me to the first (ground) level of the Mall.

 The doors remain shut for some reason.

>push open button

 The doors are now open.

>out

 The elevator doors open, and I'm struck by the terrible, pungent odor
 of carrion. It's far too much for what I can bear: it's absolutely the
 worst-smelling air I have ever experienced.

 I briefly steal a glance of what lay beyond in the corridor on the
 first level of the Mall before squashing the up button on the elevator
 -- it's mostly dark, but I can make out the cupid statue. The stench
 is just too much for me. however. I can't force myself to do anything
 from here except escape.

 The elevator comes to rest on the top floor.

>spray perfume on audrey

 "Hey, I'm not your Barbie doll!" exclaims Audrey as I give her a hit
 of <span class="floydstyle em">True Love.</span>

>examine cupid

 It's a nicely-sculpted, eight-foot marble work of the mythological god
 of love. Cupid (known as Eros in Greek myth) was often depicted as
 being a winged baby or cherub that would just start freaking out and
 begin slinging arrows at people so they would indulge in a torrent of
 romance, love and sex.

 This statue was commissioned by the guy who owns and rents out the
 Mall, from a student at the local art college. Cupid's in a pose where
 he seems to be taking deadly aim at people.

>throw perfume at cupid

 I toss the perfume bottle at the statue. It shatters, natch, and
 releases a giant pool of stench-killing fumes into the area below.

 There is an exit leading out.

>press down

 I press the down button. After a few seconds, the elevator transports
 me to the first (ground) level of the Mall.

 The doors remain shut for some reason.

 They are competently constructed steel doors, and possibly the only
 item not of ridiculously cheap construction in the entire Mall.

>press open doors

 The doors are now open.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, East Edge</span>
 I'm on the first level (ground floor) of the Mall, a lot closer to the
 lone exit than where I was previously. I'll need to get past a few
 more stretches of corridor (which is under a blanket of darkness) and
 then past the Food Court. And I hesitate to think about what is in
 store for me until I get to that point.

 In the center of the corridor is a sculpted marble statue.

 Audrey, Gibs, and Casey follow me.

 "Well, we got this far," says Gibs. "What's the plan, now? How are we
 getting out?"

 "We could try the exit by the big Outlet Tech Store, can't we?" asks
 Casey.

 "They went bankrupt," I say. "When the Septium Computer Processor was
 declared an instrument of bedevilment and banned by the Mayor in 2012,
 the hottest selling item that Christmas had to be removed from the
 store. We can try to go that way, but I am almost positive that exit
 access was cemented over." I shrug.

 "So we'll probably have to slog through the Food Court, speedily going
 about our business with as much haste as molasses slow-fucking a giant
 land turtle." says Gibs. He spits with disgust -- the Food Court floor
 never gets cleaned. It's kind of gross.

 "Yeah, everyone jump over the ochre jellies," whispers Audrey, almost
 to herself. After a beat, she realizes what she said and turns towards
 me. "Hey! You've got <span class="floydstyle em">me</span> doing it now!"

 Gibs laughs. "Duffy's veritable roster of sexually transmitted
 diseases is <span class="floydstyle em">not</span> the only thing infectious about him," he
 offers.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Eastern Edge</span>
 I enter this bit of hallway and am taken back by the glorious fountain
 that dominates the scene. I've seen it hundreds, even thousands of
 times in normal daylight, but the small bits of ambient light
 currently available reflects off the fountain in a simply breathtaking
 manner.

 While Audrey, Casey and myself are checking out the fountain (and
 momentarily entranced by the beauty thereof) Gibs wanders off and goes
 further down the corridor. I forget him for a moment until he lets out
 a blood-curdling scream.

 "Duffy! Look out! It's the fucking ghast!"

 I turn and look -- that's exactly what it is. A green-skinned feral
 beast with glazed-over eyes and torn clothes. Gibs falls to the floor,
 presumably knocked out by the ghast's stench and so far from where the
 perfume bottle broke open. The ghast stomps once on his head and runs
 over towards us. I motion for Audrey and Casey to get back behind the
 fountain.
 The ghast, Gibs, Audrey, and Casey are here.

 The ghast attacks and hits me!

>examine fountain

 The fountain is rich limestone artifact that was discovered years ago
 in a poured-over closet in Italy and flown out here at great expense.
 It has been converted from its original state as a Renaissance-era
 commissioned sculpture to a marketing tool for the Mall.

 It's about six feet at the base and rather shallow -- water would only
 come up to one's ankles in its normal, calm state. The spout extends a
 couple of feet up from the dead center of the base. There are a few
 inscriptions and symbols on the thing, but nothing I can decipher.

 Inside the fountain is some water.

 flows through my hands...)

 The ghast attacks and hits me!

>throw water at ghast

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Drink up, Dupre!"</span> I throw the water at the ghast's upper
 torso. It screams -- a horrible, piercing shriek of disbelief, and
 inhuman pain. My aim was a bit off, as the water chews through his
 shirt, eats through his belly and stomach and begins hissing away at
 the consumption of his rotting intestines and grodie twists of
 entrails.

 I wipe a little sweat away from my face and see that he truly can't
 comprehend what has happened to him. I sort of feel sorry for him...
 not just because the ghost killed him once, but because she brought
 him back and then he got killed in a second, crueler, manner.

 The slashing sounds of evaporation fade away as the last bits of the
 ghast inanimately fall to the floor and crumble into nothingness. His
 head bounces to the floor of the Mall. Gibs wakes himself up and
 blinks stupidly a couple times as he sees the ghast's skull resting
 peacefully on the floor. He winds up and kicks it down the corridor.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Poster Store</span>
 This place has been in the Mall for as long as I can remember. It
 really is just called 'Poster Store,' though when I first noticed it a
 few years back the 'T' on the sign was missing. For months I thought
 it was some theme store where white suburban kids exclusively bought
 cassettes detailing cop killing and bitch slapping.

 The Poster Store sells posters... and little else. There's a hanging
 flip-rack of posters in the corner of the store, and a few hanging up
 on the walls.

 Alongside the far wall is a set of oversized disembodied lips.

 Audrey, Gibs, and Casey follow me.

 I'm fed up with the mouth's nonsense. I cut it off from going any
 further.

 "Just shut that wretched little hole before I cover you with a custom
 balm milked from your disgusting, available organs, bitchlips. I need
 help and answers and I'm wholly not interested in even remotely taking
 abuse from some matted, chudlike non-life hung up on a wall."

 A sudden unease creeps over me. What am I <span class="floydstyle em">doing</span> with my life?
 This is a terrible time for reflection, and I try to fight it off.
 Audrey starts to say something, like how lips aren't officially organs
 or something equally helpful, but I ignore the interruption and
 continue. "You don't want to be in the Mall any more than I do. Help
 me out."

 Nothing happens for at least fifteen seconds. I get ready to leave
 before the lips purse. Finally.

 "How?" it says, at last.

>talk to lips

>examine posters

 There isn't a poster in the slot currently, but if I turn the flip
 rack, I am sure to see one.

>turn rack

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The first poster in this set depicts a kind of ritual. There is a red
 pentagram on the floor, and a bunch of pilgrims, quakers or hippies
 holding hands around it. (I can never really differentiate between the
 three.) It's eerily reminiscent of the attempt at an invoking
 performed earlier by Audrey, Gibs, Syd and Casey... <span class="floydstyle em">Relatively</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">speaking,</span> anyway, as encountering a wraith and zombie tonight has
 raised the scale for what I will consider 'eerie' in the future.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The second poster shows a ghost -- a child's rendition of a spirit,
 really, with looming, evil eyes and a reversed teardrop shape. It's
 emerging from some other world or dimension inside the pentagram.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 Er, this poster is actually one of Samantha Fox pouring milk all over
 herself in the shower.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 This poster seems to be by the same artist as the other two, but
 rather than being drawn from a bird's eye perspective like those
 posters, it is a close-up of a young boy reading passages from a
 thick, craggily book. Locks of the boy's hair descend over his glasses
 and he's decked out all in black, wrapped in a weary and somber
 expression.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The fourth poster in this set shows a little girl with her eyes
 downcast. She is drinking from a radiant, glowing urn. The girl is
 wearing a silvery dress and has a key around her neck.

 "Do you see the symbolism in this picture, Jarret?"

 "The girl? No. Is she ashamed? Is that why she's looking down?"

 "No... I mean, around her neck. The key."

 "What's the key to?" I ask.

 "It's... well, actually, maybe it isn't really symbolism. But I think
 that's to a chastity belt." She releases her study of the picture and
 gives me a subtle, wry smile. "You know, my father wanted to put me in
 one when we first started dating."

 "It's good that he didn't. I would have just picked it."

 "Oh, really?" she says, with a bit of faux, exaggerated inquiry. "You
 know, skills from a game don't always translate to real life."

 "I know. I would have done it with my tongue. I have like a cold iron
 fetish, I just haven't told you yet because the subject hasn't come up
 and that's a tough one to drop on somebody." We stare at each other's
 eyes for a moment, 'till she breaks the gaze with a smile she
 unsuccessfully tries to hide.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The second-to-last image is of a person from the first poster
 surrounded by numerous lit candles. There are seemingly millions of
 candles in the scene, and it's almost like an optical illusion, as the
 'negative space' for certain candles comprise many separate ones when
 viewed in a different way. No candle seems to have a single,
 identifiable color (or rather, they seem to include all possible

 <span class="floydstyle em">Poster Store</span>
 The Poster Store sells posters... and little else. There's a hanging
 flip-rack of posters in the corner of the store, and a few hanging up
 on the walls.

 Alongside the far wall is a set of oversized disembodied lips.
 Audrey, Gibs, and Casey are here.

 The fourth poster in this set shows a little girl with her eyes
 downcast. She is drinking from a radiant, glowing urn. The girl is
 wearing a silvery dress and has a key around her neck.

>turn rack

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The second-to-last image is of a person from the first poster
 surrounded by numerous lit candles. There are seemingly millions of
 candles in the scene, and it's almost like an optical illusion, as the
 'negative space' for certain candles comprise many separate ones when
 viewed in a different way. No candle seems to have a single,
 identifiable color (or rather, they seem to include all possible
 colors) and one can only really make out a single flame glowing
 serenely upon them.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 <span class="floydstyle em">yousTayaWayyouSICKLITTLEBOY!!</span>

 The last scene shows vibrant fire all over the edges, and the subjects
 all seem burned to a crisp. There is no sign of the ghost, but the
 bodies of the boy, the girl, and all their compatriots are viciously
 chunked and charred. It's a beautiful little bit of art, regardless of
 how horrible the scene it depicts, and how terrible the ulcer is that
 begins to grow in my stomach.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Eastern Edge</span>
 This bit of hallway features an enormous and beautiful fountain. There
 are exits in all four primary compass directions.

 Audrey, Gibs, and Casey follow me.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Central Corridor</span>
 This stretch of the Mall hallway is covered with just a bit of rubble.
 There are clear exits to the west and south (in addition to the east,
 back from where we came). The gate to the Record Store is down to the
 north.
 The spectre is here.

 Audrey, Gibs, and Casey follow me.

 "Where do we go from here?" asks Gibs. "There's an exit past the Food
 Court, right?" He gestures over towards the west.

 "Yeah. I don't think we can get out going to the Tech SuperStore." The
 SuperStore is to the south. "Audrey and I can take a jaunt down there
 and make sure, though."

 "Either way," says Gibs. "Just be careful. Who knows what's lurking
 about down there?"

 "Well, as my father always said, 'He who fights with monsters might
 take care lest he thereby become a monster. "

 Gibs thinks about that for a second. "Your dad didn't say that.
 Freddie Nietzsche did, dummy."

 "What? No he didn't. You're completely wrong." I am really not sure if
 Barnaby is correct or not, so I just immediately go on the defensive.

 "Did Papa Duffy also say 'In heaven, all the interesting people are
 missing?' Or maybe 'Only sick music makes money today?"

 (Truth to tell, my dad <span class="floydstyle em">did</span> used to say the latter, but I
 don't tell Gibs that.)

 "Your father is really weird," says Audrey, unhelpfully.

 "Look, enough with ragging on poor, old Nichodeimos. He liked all of
 you well enough."

 "He <span class="floydstyle em">hated</span> me," says Audrey.

 "He called me 'fruitier than a blueberry pudding pop.'" says Gibs.

 "I never met him" says Casey.

 "Yeah, well, he hated Goths," says Gibs.

 "He hated <span class="floydstyle em">everybody</span>," says Audrey.

 The spectre heads off to the north.

>go north

 The gate to the Record Store is down, blocking my path.

>go down

 There is not an exit that way.

 There are exits north to the Record Store, and west, east and south to
 other corridors of the Mall.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, West Edge</span>
 A kind of cave-in has apparently occurred here. While the gate north
 to the Novel Shoppe has been destroyed (and passage is possible), our
 path to the west is blocked by an enormous amount of rubble.

 Audrey, Gibs, and Casey follow me.

 "This is the way out, isn't it?" asks Gibs. I nod, sagely, in the
 affirmative.

 He looks over the mess.

 "Look," says Gibs, "Why don't you and Audrey see if you can find any
 items that we'll need to get past whatever horrors are in store for us
 on the other side of this wall of junk? I'll start digging away at
 this and clear a path. Your sissy, atrophied she-muscles won't be able
 to really help any, Duffy."

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Discount Novel Shoppe</span>
 You're supposed to be pumped to enter a book store in a mall.

 This isn't the case with this one. The novels contained herein are not
 discounted in terms of their cost, they are discounted, rather, in
 terms of their quality. A few years back there was a fad in publishing
 that resulted in the release of a large number of non-fiction books
 that were little more than paper printouts of 'successful' blog sites.
 (I say 'successful' in a manner of speaking like that, as in my
 opinion the only <span class="floydstyle em">successful</span> blog site is one that ends with
 the webcam suicide of its maintainer.)

 <span class="floydstyle em">El circo de chamuscarse de la retina</span> doesn't stop there.
 Shitty steampunk, trite Lycanthropian romance novels, pre-civilization
 thrillers featuring cavemen (well, cavepeople) and gimmick
 dictionaries were all part of the hardcover publishing's switch
 towards the tactics of pop music the last few years. These outright
 dolorous genres are fully represented here, making this place more a
 library or museum than a boutique.

 There is an exit to the south.

 Nailed to a couple of boards in the far corner of the room is a girl.
 Sitting on the cross is the crucified girl.

 Carelessly discarded on the ground next to the crucified girl is a
 thick, burgundy text.

 Audrey follows me.

>examine girl

 The crucified girl seems to be of mild Hispanic descent. Her features
 are slightly olive, her hair dark and her eyes stained all the round
 by blood. She is wearing a torn black tank top, blue bandana with
 floral print, and sleek pair of tight shorts. Her build is slight --
 she is probably about five foot five at most, with slim, athletic
 legs.

 The girl's arms and right leg have been nailed to a makeshift cross,
 and the cross seems solidly affixed to the western wall. There are
 cuts and tears elsewhere on her body as well. It is difficult to tell
 how long she has been dead, but she is not sending off a waft of
 stench or anything, currently. She looks a lot like a girl that used
 to work in the paint and housewares store that used to be here in the
 Mall before they closed. I remember that she was really bright,
 resourceful, helpful and was working on her four-year degree. I really
 hope it's not her.

 She is dead.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "neck" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>examine tank top

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "tank" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>examine cross

 The cross runs about six feet high, wide enough for a grown woman to
 be nailed to and made of some sort of indeterminate wood.

 There is a dead girl nailed to it.

 Sitting on the cross is the crucified girl.

>remove girl

 I ease the girl down from the cross and place her on the floor.

>examine text

 The text has a grooved, sturdy cover, designed out of pressed reed and
 dyed a rich burgundy. It is about fifteen inches long, nine or ten
 inches thick.

>get it

 (assuming you mean the aged text)
 Got it.

 <span class="floydstyle em">noyoUreYescasTtheMaSiDelittlefucKsicklittleboy!!! !</span>

>read it

 (assuming you mean the aged text)
 I flip through a few pages, but nothing really catches my eye. I'm
 sure that some long dead monk or priest who nearly acquired whatever
 the 14th century version of repetitive motion syndrome in writing this
 thing is revolving in a European Potter's grave at my disinterest, but
 the words just seem to roll off my eyeballs in a splash of drama and
 desperate Calligraphy.

>kiss girl

 I don't discover anything else by fooling around with the poor
 crucified girl.

>talk to girl

 The crucified girl isn't in any shape to talk to anyone.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, West Edge</span>
 This area is adjacent to the huge Food Court which is just over to the

 There's paths to the west (into the Food Court) and east (back into

 <span class="floydstyle em">Discount Novel Shoppe</span>
 I hate going in here, but I have apparently been a patron enough times
 to notice how peculiar the store is without its overhead fluorescent
 spotlights. The low light received from outside produces oddly-angled
 little shadows, albeit (apparently) non-sentient ones.

 There are two long rows of shelves along the north-south orient of the
 store, and a cashier's counter in back.
 Barnaby's Big Gulp drink, a pleather purse, some socks, the Magic: The
 Gathering cards, Gibs's lacrosse stick, the aged text are here.

 The spectre arrives from the east.

>talk to spectre

 I can't think of anything to say right now.

>examine spectre

 The spectre is a powerful, intangible, undead spirit consumed with
 hatred for those with warmth in their souls. Its touch drains an
 enormous amount of life energy, it is unaffected by silver, 'normal'
 iron, or cold.

 It would be powerless in daylight, but I am obviously several hours
 away from any such thing. It may be best to just avoid and and not
 antagonize it.

 The spectre heads off to the north.

>call phone

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Speaking to Trott on the phone...]</span>
 Just talking to Trott will suffice.

 The spectre arrives from the north.

 "Hmm," says Trott, "Let me try... argh. I can't. I'm not getting
 anything to respond in that area."

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Southern Edge</span>
 I enter the southern-most section of the Mall, and it's as I feared:
 the Outlet SuperStore has been cemented over, so I won't be able to
 get to the exit doors that way. (I always arrive through the food
 court due to how the parking lots are structured.)

 There's two stores here that are accessible, however: a party favors
 store to the east, and then the Bead Store's main competitor -- a
 candle store, which is to the west.

 Audrey follows me.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Party On Central</span>
 This store is mostly unfurnished, with a low, bare ceiling, cold floor
 covered in cheap carpeting, and blankets and rugs thumb-tacked up to
 hide the peeling wallpaper and crumbling drywall.

 The contents of the room are a cluttered mess, as this place seems to
 be more of a craftsman's think-tank and construction area than pure
 chamber for commerce like so many other shops in the Mall. There's a
 workdesk and mirror along the northern wall and a file cabinet across
 from it. A small window is visible behind some junk, and directly
 across from the entrance are seven masks attached to the back wall in
 a proud display. Attached to one of the naked support beams is a disco
 laser pointer.

 Prominently displayed in the center of the room is a reserved, yet
 sizeable urn.
 Sitting on the workdesk is the blue balloon.

 Audrey follows me.

>get mirror

 I can't take that.

>look in mirror

 I can't do that with the mirror.

>examine cabinet

 It's colored a deep beige and stands about as tall as I do. It, like
 most of the other things in the room, is of cheap construction.

>get balloon

>examine it

 (assuming you mean the blue balloon)
 It's colored blue, but the material used is a heavier than I'd expect
 -- like an expandable metallic bag. It floats in the air about where
 it's placed, so presumably it's got some helium in it, though a fair
 amount has leaked out.

>examine masks

 There's a collection of masks in the Party Store, though many of them
 valueless, and all of them locked up tight to the wall.

>examine mirror

 A stylin' and engaging Chortlemaster with great hair is staring back
 at me.

>break mirror

 That doesn't seem to work.

>open window

 I can't do that with the window.

>examine window

 This rare window offers a glimpse to what is going on outside. There
 is a terrible storm along the horizon that is visible from this
 direction. The clouds right above the mountains are electric with
 activity. The moon is soft and blurred and red-orange.

 I stay for too long a moment and take it all in. The window itself is
 unbreakable, of course, to fend off thieves, and it's far too small
 for me to fit through, but I can't deny how strong the feeling is to
 get on the other side of these walls, to sprint off into the distance
 until the snow-capped peaks are before me and to just burrow within
 them and hide until dawn... till some other dawn, days away.

 I come back to my senses after a few moments. I'll find another way
 out.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Southern Edge</span>
 This is the southern-most section of the Mall. There's a large block
 of impenetrable cement to the south, which covers over the failed
 Outlet Store, and two paths to two other stores: the candle store
 (west) and party favors store (east).

 Audrey follows me.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Christ's Candles</span>
 The Candle Store is the second-most picketed store, right after
 Choad's. It used to be a lot worse when it was a nail and board
 emporium, though. Some old and independently wealthy latin guy owns
 the place, though, and he just doesn't care about the Cash-In of the
 Christ.

 Christ's Candles is decked out in a similar manner to the Bead Store,
 hippie stuff and dark shadows even when the power isn't completely
 out. This isn't the kind of city where one can set up a number of
 candles on stands like in the video to 'Wrapped Around Your Finger,'
 so instead all the candles and other objects are on shelves.
 There are a number of tiny birthday candles in packages all over the
 store, but the most impressive display is in the back, where an
 elegant, if clouded menorah rests upon a long display table.
 A Revenant is here.

 Audrey follows me.

>get menorah

 <span class="floydstyle em">oUTOUTboysickchildOUTNONONONONONONO!!!</span>

 I take it.

 A bit of smoke and fog begins to form against the southern wall.

>examine revenant

 The Revenant is about a foot taller than me, and decked out in an old,
 charred robe. Its face is covered in hideous burn scars, not that the
 thing is doing itself any favors in the charisma department by wearing
 a constant sneer. Its fingernails are overgrown and apparently chewed
 or filed down to function as sharp claws. It breathes heavily, each
 gasp of air apparently being quite an effort to draw.

 Another vision appears before us. It shows a slender hand over a sink
 holding a one of those card pregnancy tests.

 The vision quickly pulls back, revealing Audrey in a bathrobe and her
 hair in towel. I think that I saw the card show a 'plus' sign before
 the vision ended. The only thing is... I have no idea what plus
 represents. Pregnant? Not expecting? Gender? I don't have a lot of
 experience in this sort of thing.

 "There is no need for thanks. It was not a favor I did, but an attempt
 to uncover the truth about my death." I give him a quick look of

 outburst: there are absolutely no other sounds audible this far into
 the Mall. "A sweet, everlasting relaxation that I so richly deserve.
 Many cultures have had many different names for it. Nirvana...
 Heaven... Ragnar?k..."

 "Actually, Ragnar?k wasn't a final state of bliss, like the Sanskrit
 Nirvana, but rather a foretelling of -- " The Revenant cuts me off and
 continues his monologue. What a complete cock!

 "A final resting place for a warrior such as I. It is as I deserve. I
 crave it, desperately... but first I must find the one that put me

 "What does a plus mean?" asks Audrey. "On a home pregnancy test? It
 means that you're not pregnant. Thank God."

 "Did you have a close call or something?"

 "Yes, <span class="floydstyle em">we</span> had a close call. Don't you remember? It wasn't that
 long ago. I had got off ICQ talking to one of your ex-girlfriends the
 night before. She told me that you, quote, 'wig out' when spoken to in
 Elvish or some other made-up language along those lines."

 Audrey continues her story, but I start to get a flood of memories
 back from that night. I had actually deigned to go out clubbing with
 her for a night a few weeks back. (I usually don't, as I am such a
 lousy, self-conscious dancer.) She was wearing this tight little gray
 dress with slight horizontal lines across it, made out of this fuzzy
 fabric -- the outfit practically squealed 'do me' by itself.

 Audrey was grinding her way up against me every time I went onto the
 floor. I just seizured out. That's the only way I know how to dance. I
 almost never really consume much alcohol, but that night I was taking
 pull after pull of some Safeway Vodka that Sydney had smuggled into
 the club as if the contents of the bottle were nothing more innocuous
 than Mexican Kool-Aid. Audrey and I took a cab back to her place, and
 we were all over one another before we could find the light switch.

 She was on top of me for what seemed like the better part of an hour
 when she dipped down and whispered something into my ear.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Tye-mela'ne</span>. It's Tolkein Elvish for 'I love you.' We don't
 seem to say that to each other very much, but even drunk I instantly
 translated what she said and I... well, I went off like a Soviet
 Catapult: unexpectedly, unpredictably, and altogether quite messily.

 I hadn't thought about it -- about the consequences of it -- until
 just right now. I didn't mean for her to go through a pregnancy scare
 like that by herself. I just wasn't thinking about the details.

 (For what it's worth, the story that Audrey related as I had this
 flashback was pretty much exactly like mine, except that she said that
 we only jammed for something like fifteen minutes. She's got this
 crazy, post-Einsteinian view of how time really works though, so don't
 believe her.)

 (1) "Well, what is fun, then? Educate me."
 (2) "Are we looking for a particular candle?"

 "Um... I'm not really sure," said Audrey. "If I remember right, the
 candle or candles didn't have an apparent identifying trait that I
 could see..." She screws up her face in thought for a moment. "I'll
 think, though, about it..." It's probably nothing more than ego on my
 part, but I could <span class="floydstyle em">swear</span> that there was a hint of, 'if I don't
 get it, I am betting that my charming and resourceful boyfriend
 <span class="floydstyle em">certainly</span> will.' OK, maybe a lot of ego, but still.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Christ's Candles</span>
 The Candle Store is the second-most picketed store, right after
 Choad's. It used to be a lot worse when it was a nail and board
 emporium, though. Some old and independently wealthy latin guy owns
 the place, though, and he just doesn't care about the Cash-In of the
 Christ.

 Christ's Candles is decked out in a similar manner to the Bead Store,
 hippie stuff and dark shadows even when the power isn't completely
 out. This isn't the kind of city where one can set up a number of
 candles on stands like in the video to 'Wrapped Around Your Finger,'
 so instead all the candles and other objects are on shelves.

 The floorspace towards the rear of the store is completely taken up by
 the long display table against the western wall.
 Audrey is here.

>examine table

 The display table is a sort of countertop, approximately fifteen feet
 long and about three feet deep. It is made out of a hard plastic,
 faced off with a chipping formica plate.

>search it

 (assuming you mean the long display table)
 I don't find anything.

 A horrible scream pierces the air, originating from the far end of the
 Food Court.

 Audrey follows me.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, East Edge</span>
 This is the first level, or ground floor, of the Funtime Teen Mall.
 The lone Mall Exit leads in a westerly direction, past a few more
 stretches of darkness-enveloped corridor, and the Food Court. There's
 also a few more stores to the west, with the Mall passageways
 expanding to all four directions at that point.

 Exits lead west to the rest of the Mall, and inside to the elevator.

 In the center of the corridor is a sculpted marble statue.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Sunglasses Hut</span>
 I'm not quite sure why sunglasses and shades are only sold in 'huts'
 but this store is very un-hut like. There are three very solid walls
 here and a roof made not of thatch, but poured, cracking cement. The
 floor is hardly comprised of peat or mud, but the same tile present
 everywhere else in the Mall.

 A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with
 the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still
 function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the
 room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters
 of the Sunglasses Hut.

 I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my
 manager at the D&D store. I acquired a little bit of trivia regarding
 this place (for instance, the center display case will open if it's
 tapped upon) but nothing useful otherwise.

 Audrey follows me.

>tap on case

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ The word "tap" is not recognized by the game. ]</span>

>hit case

 I give the case a good whack, and it opens with ease.

 Inside the center display case are the mirrored shades.

>take shades

 Got it.

>examine them

 (assuming you mean the mirrored shades)
 They are circular frames, with perfect mirrors on the outside. My eyes
 are completely hidden while wearing the sunglasses, at the expense of
 a lot of light getting through.

>remove glasses

 I can't remove my specs like that! They are a valuable
 information-gathering tool!

>wear shades

 I take off my glasses and put the shades on. Things get considerably
 darker.

 The area is free from the wreckage. Gibs, though is just standing up,

 Gibs is here.

 Audrey follows me.

 "She was here, Duffy. She was beautiful."

 "Who was? Casey? Where's Casey?"

 "Casey... " Gibs turns and looks at me for the first time since I came
 back. "No... not poor Casey. We finished up getting all the wreckage
 out of the way and as I looked up Casey was entranced by the most
 beautiful creature I have ever seen. Her skin was so pale, so fragile.
 She had this dark shock of bangs that framed her perfect face. As soon
 as I looked up, I froze. But she had locked eyes with Casey. I knew
 her name was Kali, but not how. Casey didn't seem to be able to move,
 at first, just like me. Then -- "

 "It was a vampire, Gibs. I was hoping we'd avoid one, but -- "

 "She took Casey by the hand and they both walked that way... into the
 darkness."

 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area and I can only see about half of
 it from here due to the lack of light -- the entire western end of it
 is cloaked in darkness. There are a number of cheap square tables and
 static plastic chairs bolted to the floor here, although a few have
 somehow broken off and are loose.

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. They carry a large assortment
 of tabs, pills, drugs and spices. The Court has another section to the
 west, and there is an exit east from where we came.

 Audrey lets out a little surprised 'yip!' and runs over towards me.

 "Jarret!" she says, "I felt something brush up against my leg!
 Something's here, in this area with us!" Before I can pooh-pooh her
 objections to this area, a metal chair comes flying at us. It appears
 as if a poltergeist has infected the food court.
 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,
 a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts
 are here.
 Casey is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 A garbage can comes flying right at me!

 A garbage can strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

 I notice something moving over in the far corner of the Food Court.
 It's a girl. She is wearing a reserved violet dress and has the most
 perfect, slim little figure I have ever seen.

 The vampire, I guess. It has to be; she's just as stunning as Gibs
 said.

 Focusing harder, I see Casey beside her, unmoving, defeated,
 completely obedient. The vampire whispers softly to her -- Casey snaps
 back into proper consciousness, and after a moment begins to look at
 her with loving trust. They are both several yards away, but I can
 make what the vampire says to her perfectly: <span class="floydstyle em">Follow me, my</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">pet.</span>

 The vampire heads off to the west.

 Casey heads off to the west.

>go west

 I can't get by the Poltergeist!

 "I don't think Casey has a lot of time," says Gibs. "I don't remember
 as much D&D crap as you do, Duffy, but I'm thinking she has maybe
 fifteen minutes."

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green which some junior ad exec no doubt thinks promotes quick sales
 decisions, when all it truly does is make customers eager to get the
 hell out before they add an equally off-putting color to the
 surrounding by use of their own acrid vomit.

 In the rear of the store is a modest plastic counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Further behind that is a closed metal door that
 really clashes with what's going on otherwise, stylistically.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.

 Exits lead to the southwest and through the door.

 "There should <span class="floydstyle em">surely</span> be some garlic here," I say to myself...

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>open door

 "I'm going to take a quick look below. Be right back."
 Opened.

>in

 I can't go that way.  I can go down to the basement entrance or
 southwest to the food court's east half.

>go through door


 <span class="floydstyle em">Basement to the Nutrition Store</span>
 I descend the stairs and enter the basement. The air is at least
 twenty degrees cooler down here than it is up above and it has a bit
 of a tangy, acrid -- almost 'chewy' quality to it. My breath turns
 into wispy, stringy clouds the instant it leaves my lips and I begin
 to feel my very bones come across a deep chill. I usually prefer
 winter to summer, so normally I wouldn't be put off by the frost down
 here and a few bad smells, but there's something different about the
 chill in the air down here. The temperature of the air seems
 malevolent, almost.

 The ceiling of the basement is about five and a half feet high, so I
 have to lurch over like I'm the hunchback of Notre Dork just to get
 around. The walls have a very rough texture to them, as if they were
 blasted away and then sanded down in a very half-assed manner.

 The corridor continues into darkness to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">First Basement Corridor</span>
 The light is very poor in this room, all of it coming from what can
 seep and pour through the metal door up above. The floor has turned to
 earth, however, and the walls seem to have a texture wholly different
 from the blasted rock earlier in the corridor. I can't say I'm totally
 suprised to find this area down here below the Mall, as rumor was that
 the place was built upon some burial grounds. I just never knew that
 they were, in parts, integrated.

 Exits lead south and further on to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The basement ceiling gets much taller in this room, about up to 15
 feet or so, I'd guess. At the very top is a small torch, which is
 providing a fair bit of the light in the room -- the rest of it is
 reflected from the coffin in the corner.

 The ground is no longer soft earth, either, but rather blocks of cold
 stone. The walls are made of some kind of brick which reflects a bit
 of light as well, although nowhere near as well as the coffin.

 A support beam has been installed next to the coffin. Beyond it, to
 the right, is a small and very dark alcove.

>get torch

 It's too far up.

>go alcove

 I can't enter the alcove.

>examine it

 (assuming you mean the alcove)
 It's a very small and hidden away subsection of the basement. It's to
 the east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Alcove</span>
 I practically have to crawl to get into this little cave-like section
 cut away from the basement. The light is gobbled up from something
 inside, as nothing from the coffin room manages to get in here.

 The only thing of note here is a very small trestle up against the
 wall.

>examine beam

 I don't see that.

>examine trestle

 In the corner of the alcove is a single trestle. It's obviously
 rotting away, and emitting a little bit of an old musty smell. It
 stands about two feet high and looks as if it might crumble at any
 time.

 The trestle has a garlic clove on it.

>get clove

 I take the garlic.

 I hear metallic stone sliding up against metallic stone coming from
 the next room.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The ceiling in this room is unique within the basement, as it is
 actually enough up where I don't have to hunch. At the top of the
 ceiling is a single, lit torch, held at a diagonal against the wall
 with a bracket. All available light is strongly reflected from the
 coffin, which sits quietly in the corner of the room. The walls are
 made out of a flecked brick, and a support beam stands to the right of
 the coffin.

 Exits are south towards the stairs and east into a tight alcove.
 The lid is here.

 I see two bandaged hands slowly emerge from darkness. They grope at
 the sides of the coffin. A figure rises, I see first the unwrapped,
 rotting head and then the torso, wound tight with stinking fibers and
 rags.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The mummy turns its head directly towards me.</span>

 The mummy exits the coffin.

 The mummy slowly begins to moan, seemingly within a weary, endless
 pain. It quickly shifts this to a scream. Its keen is of a deep tenor,
 and it begins thrashing about. Small scraps of deteriorating bandages
 fall from its person and onto the floor.

 The mummy strikes the support beam! Chunks of the ceiling fall
 downwards and it sounds as if the entire Mall has collapsed a little.

 The chaos breaks me out of my fear-trance. I feel I could flee now if
 I wanted to try.

 The mummy attacks and hits me!

 I feel awful after that last touch.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">First Basement Corridor</span>
 This stretch of corridor is little more than a narrow, forgotten
 passageway. Soft earth makes up the floor, a distinct change from the
 cement seen to the south.

 probably no more than thirty degrees Fahrenheit. The ceiling is just
 over five feet high, and the walls have a very rough texture to them,
 as if they were blasted away and then poorly sanded.

 The mummy follows me.

 The mummy attacks and hits me!

 There's a flash of pain right where the mummy first struck me.

 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green and contrast with the subdued nature of the shelves and all the
 jars of pills placed upon them.

 In the rear of the store is a modest wood counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Even further, behind the counter and register,
 is a metal door.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in

 (The cross breaks as a result, and I throw it down.)

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Bring back pre-casting, beeeeyatch!"</span> I scream!

 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,

 <span class="floydstyle em">Party On Central</span>
 This store is mostly unfurnished, with a low, bare ceiling, cold floor
 covered in cheap carpeting, and blankets and rugs thumb-tacked up to
 hide the peeling wallpaper and crumbling drywall.

 The contents of the room are a cluttered mess, as this place seems to
 be more of a craftsman's think-tank and construction area than pure
 chamber for commerce like so many other shops in the Mall. There's a
 workdesk and mirror along the northern wall and a file cabinet across
 from it. A small window is visible behind some junk, and directly
 across from the entrance are seven masks attached to the back wall in
 a proud display. Attached to one of the naked support beams is a disco
 laser pointer.

 Audrey follows me.

>examine laser

 The laser pointer is out there jivin'! It's scattering laser light
 everywhere and it's turned this placed into a Block Party Central!
 Whoo-hoo!

>examine balloon

 It's colored blue, but the material used is a heavier than I'd expect
 -- like an expandable metallic bag. It floats in the air about where
 it's placed, so presumably it's got some helium in it, though a fair

 <span class="floydstyle em">Poster Store</span>
 The Poster Store sells posters... and little else. There's a hanging
 flip-rack of posters in the corner of the store, and a few hanging up
 on the walls.

 Alongside the far wall is a set of oversized disembodied lips.

 Audrey follows me.

>examine poster

 The last scene shows vibrant fire all over the edges, and the subjects
 all seem burned to a crisp. There is no sign of the ghost, but the
 bodies of the boy, the girl, and all their compatriots are viciously
 chunked and charred. It's a beautiful little bit of art, regardless of
 how horrible the scene it depicts, and how terrible the ulcer is that
 begins to grow in my stomach.

 I flip the posters in the rack all the way back to the start.

>examine poster

 There isn't a poster in the slot currently, but if I turn the flip
 rack, I am sure to see one.

>flip rack

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The first poster in this set depicts a kind of ritual. There is a red
 pentagram on the floor, and a bunch of pilgrims, quakers or hippies
 holding hands around it. (I can never really differentiate between the
 three.) It's eerily reminiscent of the attempt at an invoking
 performed earlier by Audrey, Gibs, Syd and Casey... <span class="floydstyle em">Relatively</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">speaking,</span> anyway, as encountering a wraith and zombie tonight has
 raised the scale for what I will consider 'eerie' in the future.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The second poster shows a ghost -- a child's rendition of a spirit,
 really, with looming, evil eyes and a reversed teardrop shape. It's
 emerging from some other world or dimension inside the pentagram.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 Er, this poster is actually one of Samantha Fox pouring milk all over
 herself in the shower.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 This poster seems to be by the same artist as the other two, but
 rather than being drawn from a bird's eye perspective like those
 posters, it is a close-up of a young boy reading passages from a
 thick, craggily book. Locks of the boy's hair descend over his glasses
 and he's decked out all in black, wrapped in a weary and somber
 expression.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The fourth poster in this set shows a little girl with her eyes
 downcast. She is drinking from a radiant, glowing urn. The girl is
 wearing a silvery dress and has a key around her neck.

>again

 I flip to the next poster in the series and take a look at it.

 The second-to-last image is of a person from the first poster
 surrounded by numerous lit candles. There are seemingly millions of
 candles in the scene, and it's almost like an optical illusion, as the
 'negative space' for certain candles comprise many separate ones when
 viewed in a different way. No candle seems to have a single,
 identifiable color (or rather, they seem to include all possible
 colors) and one can only really make out a single flame glowing
 serenely upon them.

>again

 Audrey follows me.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Sunglasses Hut</span>
 I'm not quite sure why sunglasses and shades are only sold in 'huts'
 but this store is very un-hut like. There are three very solid walls
 here and a roof made not of thatch, but poured, cracking cement. The
 floor is hardly comprised of peat or mud, but the same tile present
 everywhere else in the Mall.

 A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with
 the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still
 function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the
 room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters
 of the Sunglasses Hut.

 I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my
 manager at the D&D store. I acquired a little bit of trivia regarding
 this place (for instance, the center display case will open if it's
 tapped upon) but nothing useful otherwise.

 Audrey follows me.

 I give the case a good whack, and it opens with ease.

 Inside the center display case are the mirrored shades.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, East Edge</span>
 This is the first level, or ground floor, of the Funtime Teen Mall.
 The lone Mall Exit leads in a westerly direction, past a few more
 stretches of darkness-enveloped corridor, and the Food Court. There's
 also a few more stores to the west, with the Mall passageways
 expanding to all four directions at that point.

 Exits lead west to the rest of the Mall, and inside to the elevator.

 In the center of the corridor is a sculpted marble statue.

 Audrey follows me.

>examine statue

 It's a nicely-sculpted, eight-foot marble work of the mythological god
 of love. Cupid (known as Eros in Greek myth) was often depicted as
 being a winged baby or cherub that would just start freaking out and
 begin slinging arrows at people so they would indulge in a torrent of
 romance, love and sex.

 This statue was commissioned by the guy who owns and rents out the
 Mall, from a student at the local art college. Cupid's in a pose where
 he seems to be taking deadly aim at people.

 I can't move the cupid statue.

 The cross is here.

 Audrey follows me.

 The gate is made up of interwoven metal links, but due to the lack of

 the words just seem to roll off my eyeballs in a splash of drama and
 desperate Calligraphy.

 The menorah has places for nine candles -- one for each day of
 Hanukkah, and then one candle which is the Shamash, which is used to

 menorah is made out of brass and does not appear to have had any
 attention or cleaning in quite some time.
 Inside the menorah are the crimson candle, the cyan candle, the jade
 candle, the umber candle, the indigo candle, the canary candle, the
 black candle, the slate candle, and the white candle.

 The area is free from the wreckage. Gibs, though is just standing up,
 completely motionless, facing the inky blackness that shrouds the Food
 Court from here. Casey is nowhere to be found.
 Gibs is here.

 Audrey follows me.

 "She was here, Duffy. She was beautiful."

 "Who was? Casey? Where's Casey?"

 "Casey... " Gibs turns and looks at me for the first time since I came
 back. "No... not poor Casey. We finished up getting all the wreckage
 out of the way and as I looked up Casey was entranced by the most
 beautiful creature I have ever seen. Her skin was so pale, so fragile.
 She had this dark shock of bangs that framed her perfect face. As soon
 as I looked up, I froze. But she had locked eyes with Casey. I knew
 her name was Kali, but not how. Casey didn't seem to be able to move,
 at first, just like me. Then -- "

 "It was a vampire, Gibs. I was hoping we'd avoid one, but -- "

 "She took Casey by the hand and they both walked that way... into the
 darkness."

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area and I can only see about half of
 it from here due to the lack of light -- the entire western end of it
 is cloaked in darkness. There are a number of cheap square tables and
 static plastic chairs bolted to the floor here, although a few have
 somehow broken off and are loose.

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. They carry a large assortment
 of tabs, pills, drugs and spices. The Court has another section to the
 west, and there is an exit east from where we came.

 Audrey lets out a little surprised 'yip!' and runs over towards me.

 "Jarret!" she says, "I felt something brush up against my leg!
 Something's here, in this area with us!" Before I can pooh-pooh her
 objections to this area, a metal chair comes flying at us. It appears
 as if a poltergeist has infected the food court.
 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,
 a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts
 are here.
 Casey is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 I notice something moving over in the far corner of the Food Court.
 It's a girl. She is wearing a reserved violet dress and has the most
 perfect, slim little figure I have ever seen.

 The vampire, I guess. It has to be; she's just as stunning as Gibs
 said.

 Focusing harder, I see Casey beside her, unmoving, defeated,
 completely obedient. The vampire whispers softly to her -- Casey snaps
 back into proper consciousness, and after a moment begins to look at
 her with loving trust. They are both several yards away, but I can
 make what the vampire says to her perfectly: <span class="floydstyle em">Follow me, my</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">pet.</span>

 The vampire heads off to the west.

 Casey heads off to the west.

 Poltergeists are a form of invisible undead that whines for attention
 by flinging shit at people. Of all the creatures and spirits that make
 up the hierarchy of walking dead, these mewling little bitches are the
 ones I despise with the most passion. They're the worst drama queens
 in the underworld. In reality, 'poltergeists' are just the
 manifestations of picked-on, spoiled little emo or Goth kids... I
 can't imagine what this demonically-realized little ghost brat has
 going on underneath the surface.

 Please select one:

 (1) "Whoa, that was you in the vision! What does a plus mean?"

>1


 "What does a plus mean?" asks Audrey. "On a home pregnancy test? It
 means that you're not pregnant. Thank God."

 "Did you have a close call or something?"

 "Yes, <span class="floydstyle em">we</span> had a close call. Don't you remember? It wasn't that
 long ago. I had got off ICQ talking to one of your ex-girlfriends the
 night before. She told me that you, quote, 'wig out' when spoken to in
 Elvish or some other made-up language along those lines."

 Audrey continues her story, but I start to get a flood of memories
 back from that night. I had actually deigned to go out clubbing with
 her for a night a few weeks back. (I usually don't, as I am such a
 lousy, self-conscious dancer.) She was wearing this tight little gray
 dress with slight horizontal lines across it, made out of this fuzzy
 fabric -- the outfit practically squealed 'do me' by itself.

 Audrey was grinding her way up against me every time I went onto the
 floor. I just seizured out. That's the only way I know how to dance. I
 almost never really consume much alcohol, but that night I was taking
 pull after pull of some Safeway Vodka that Sydney had smuggled into
 the club as if the contents of the bottle were nothing more innocuous
 than Mexican Kool-Aid. Audrey and I took a cab back to her place, and
 we were all over one another before we could find the light switch.

 She was on top of me for what seemed like the better part of an hour
 when she dipped down and whispered something into my ear.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Tye-mela'ne</span>. It's Tolkein Elvish for 'I love you.' We don't
 seem to say that to each other very much, but even drunk I instantly
 translated what she said and I... well, I went off like a Soviet
 Catapult: unexpectedly, unpredictably, and altogether quite messily.

 I hadn't thought about it -- about the consequences of it -- until
 just right now. I didn't mean for her to go through a pregnancy scare
 like that by herself. I just wasn't thinking about the details.

 (For what it's worth, the story that Audrey related as I had this
 flashback was pretty much exactly like mine, except that she said that
 we only jammed for something like fifteen minutes. She's got this
 crazy, post-Einsteinian view of how time really works though, so don't
 believe her.)

 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 Some chair parts strike me, and I take a little bit of damage.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green which some junior ad exec no doubt thinks promotes quick sales
 decisions, when all it truly does is make customers eager to get the
 hell out before they add an equally off-putting color to the
 surrounding by use of their own acrid vomit.

 In the rear of the store is a modest plastic counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Further behind that is a closed metal door that
 really clashes with what's going on otherwise, stylistically.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.

 Exits lead to the southwest and through the door.

 "There should <span class="floydstyle em">surely</span> be some garlic here," I say to myself...

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>search shelves

 I don't find anything.

 It's one more in an endless parade of registers that are probably
 filled with cash that would solve all my financial problems, only I
 don't know how to get to it. Oh, well, stealing is wrong anyway.

 This smooth, treated plastic counter is towards the back of the store,
 in front of a steel door.

 "Hey, Duffy... Casey's got maybe 12 minutes left by my count," says
 Gibs.

 Opened.

>exits

 There are exits southwest to the Food Court and down (through the
 door).

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle em">Basement to the Nutrition Store</span>
 I descend the stairs and enter the basement. The air is at least
 twenty degrees cooler down here than it is up above and it has a bit
 of a tangy, acrid -- almost 'chewy' quality to it. My breath turns
 into wispy, stringy clouds the instant it leaves my lips and I begin
 to feel my very bones come across a deep chill. I usually prefer
 winter to summer, so normally I wouldn't be put off by the frost down
 here and a few bad smells, but there's something different about the
 chill in the air down here. The temperature of the air seems
 malevolent, almost.

 The ceiling of the basement is about five and a half feet high, so I
 have to lurch over like I'm the hunchback of Notre Dork just to get
 around. The walls have a very rough texture to them, as if they were
 blasted away and then sanded down in a very half-assed manner.

 The corridor continues into darkness to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">First Basement Corridor</span>
 The light is very poor in this room, all of it coming from what can
 seep and pour through the metal door up above. The floor has turned to
 earth, however, and the walls seem to have a texture wholly different
 from the blasted rock earlier in the corridor. I can't say I'm totally
 suprised to find this area down here below the Mall, as rumor was that
 the place was built upon some burial grounds. I just never knew that
 they were, in parts, integrated.

 Exits lead south and further on to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The basement ceiling gets much taller in this room, about up to 15
 feet or so, I'd guess. At the very top is a small torch, which is
 providing a fair bit of the light in the room -- the rest of it is
 reflected from the coffin in the corner.

 The ground is no longer soft earth, either, but rather blocks of cold
 stone. The walls are made of some kind of brick which reflects a bit
 of light as well, although nowhere near as well as the coffin.

 A support beam has been installed next to the coffin. Beyond it, to
 the right, is a small and very dark alcove.

 without any sort of ridges to hold onto or place my feet within about
 two or three feet up.

>inventory

 I am carrying the gaming glove (being worn), a pleather purse, the
 Magic: The Gathering cards, Gibs's lacrosse stick, the phone, the aged
 text, the blue balloon, the menorah, the mirrored shades, my glasses,
 an urn, and Barnaby's Big Gulp drink.  Inside the menorah are the
 crimson candle, the cyan candle, the jade candle, the umber candle,
 the indigo candle, the canary candle, the black candle, the slate
 candle, and the white candle.

>examine coffin

 The coffin is made out of some kind of stone-like substance that I am
 not altogether familiar with. It's like a chiseled and well-grooved
 offshoot of pyrite. It nevertheless reflects light quite well, and
 practically shimmers down here in the basement, excepting those bits
 of it flecked with dried blood.


>look under coffin

 I don't find anything under the coffin.

>climb coffin

 I can't climb the coffin.

>search cards

 I don't find anything.

>examine cards

 The cards are used in a game called 'Magic:The Gathering.' It's sort
 of like poker for nerds, except that the cards have special powers and
 so forth. I've never really gotten into it. Anyway, this is a small
 box containing wrapped packs of cards. There are about fifty or so in
 a box.

>open box

>wear shades

 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The ceiling in this room is unique within the basement, as it is
 actually enough up where I don't have to hunch. At the top of the
 ceiling is a single, lit torch, held at a diagonal against the wall
 with a bracket. All available light is strongly reflected from the
 coffin, which sits quietly in the corner of the room. The walls are
 made out of a flecked brick, and a support beam stands to the right of
 the coffin.

 Exits are south towards the stairs and east into a tight alcove.

 It's a very small piece of metal designed to keep the torch in place
 along the wall.

 Inside the bracket is the torch.

 I knock the torch off of the bracket! The torch falls to the ground,
 where the cold fog quickly extinguishes it.

 Even if these beam had a 'keystone' -- which it doesn't -- and I could

 the ceiling would crush me to death.

 cadavers. There are three buttons here in the elevator labelled 'up,'
 'down' and 'open doors.'

 I'm currently on the <span class="floydstyle em">first</span> level of the Mall. Aside from the
 operational panel, there is little else here in the lift.

>hit down

 I can't really fight that.

>press down

 Nothing happens since I am already on the first floor of the Mall.
 Pushing the down button doesn't get me anywhere.

>press up

 I press the up button. After a few seconds, the elevator transports me
 to the second level of the Mall.

>press up

 Nothing happens; I'm already on the second floor.

>out


 <span class="floydstyle em">Before the Elevator</span>
 The floor of the Mall comes up against a rail, forming a barrier which
 prevents further (sane) western travel. The bottom (ground floor)
 level can be viewed with ease, though, as the guardrail mainly
 prevents kids -- future productive Mall denizens! -- from ragdolling
 their way off the edge.

 There is a badly-cracked kiosk in the center of the hallway. At the
 far end of the rail is an elevator.
 There is a crystal ball holder here.

>examine holder

 It's a wooden stand, roughly four feet in height. It has three
 protruding grips on top to hold a smallish crystal ball (which is
 present). The base is circular in shape and rather thick.

 The stand is broken, and cannot be used effectively as a weapon.

 I am carrying my glasses (being worn), the gaming glove (being worn),
 a pleather purse, the Magic: The Gathering cards, Gibs's lacrosse
 stick, the phone, the aged text, the blue balloon, an urn, the
 menorah, and the mirrored shades.  Inside the menorah are the crimson
 candle, the cyan candle, the jade candle, the umber candle, the indigo
 candle, the canary candle, the black candle, the slate candle, and the
 white candle.

>examine purse

 It's one of those cheap, black pseudo-leather purses that you can get
 in any Imitation Fabric Store in America.

>drop it

 Dropped.

>get holder

 Taken.

>exits

 There are exits north to the Jewelry Store, in towards the Elevator
 and east towards the east side of the Mall.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Jewelry Store</span>
 The Jewelry Store is of average dimensions for the Mall, with
 significantly less maneuvering room due to the long tabletop display
 that snakes about the room. They sell all manner of jewelry (ear
 rings, bracelets, watches) but as they close much earlier than
 everybody else, it's all under lock and key.

 On the east side of the store, against the wall, is a large safebox.

>open safebox

 Done -- it's open.

>examine it

 (assuming you mean the safebox)
 This is a towering cabinet, in which all the valuable jewelry is kept
 when the store closes down at night. It is about seven feet tall and
 compartmentalized into different sections, one of which I can get to
 easily at my own relatively meager height.

 It's open.

>go cabinet

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Bead Store</span>
 The Bead Store smells strongly of incense and stale joints, and it

 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side of the Mall</span>
 I'm at the eastern side of the Mall. To the north is Choad's Sporting
 Goods. My store is a bit to the east, and the Bead Store a bit to the
 west.

 There is a table here, set adjacent to the Sporting Goods store.

>examine table

 Some of the stores have tables on the outside, in an attempt to entice
 customers to come inside. This table is one of them, for Choad's
 Sporting Goods Store. Usually only extremely cheap items are set on
 them, so as to minimize shortages and loss.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Choad's Sporting Goods</span>
 Choad's Sporting Goods exists under the unfortunate circumstance that
 the owner's name translates into Bengali as 'fuck.' Once or twice a
 year there will be a demonstration or protest from a bunch of local
 student Hindus, but nothing ever changes.

 The store is one of the larger ones in the Mall, about 40' wide and
 140' long. Ski jackets take up almost all the area towards the front
 of the store, as far as I can see, with the entire western wall filled
 with displays of discount tennis sneakers.

 There doesn't seem to be any rifles or shotguns for sale. (It appears
 as if Gibs's intuition was incorrect.)
 There is a circular jacket rack here.

 Audrey says, "We'll wait down here for you."

 <span class="floydstyle em">Elevator</span>
 The elevator smells terrible, strongly of untreated or unembalmed
 cadavers. There are three buttons here in the elevator labelled 'up,'
 'down' and 'open doors.'

 I'm currently on the <span class="floydstyle em">second</span> level of the Mall. Aside from the

>press down

 I press the down button. After a few seconds, the elevator transports
 me to the first (ground) level of the Mall.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, East Edge</span>
 This is the first level, or ground floor, of the Funtime Teen Mall.
 The lone Mall Exit leads in a westerly direction, past a few more
 stretches of darkness-enveloped corridor, and the Food Court. There's
 also a few more stores to the west, with the Mall passageways
 expanding to all four directions at that point.

 Exits lead west to the rest of the Mall, and inside to the elevator.

 In the center of the corridor is a sculpted marble statue.
 Audrey is here.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Eastern Edge</span>
 This bit of hallway features an enormous and beautiful fountain. There
 are exits in all four primary compass directions.

 Audrey follows me.

 The spectre arrives from the north.

>examine fountain

 The fountain is rich limestone artifact that was discovered years ago
 in a poured-over closet in Italy and flown out here at great expense.
 It has been converted from its original state as a Renaissance-era
 commissioned sculpture to a marketing tool for the Mall.

 It's about six feet at the base and rather shallow -- water would only
 come up to one's ankles in its normal, calm state. The spout extends a
 couple of feet up from the dead center of the base. There are a few
 inscriptions and symbols on the thing, but nothing I can decipher.

 Inside the fountain is some water.

>climb fountain

 I can't climb the fountain.

 The spectre heads off to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Sunglasses Hut</span>
 A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with
 the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still
 function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the
 room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters
 of the Sunglasses Hut.

 I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my
 manager at the D&D store. I acquired a little bit of trivia regarding
 this place (for instance, the center display case will open if it's
 tapped upon) but nothing useful otherwise.
 The spectre is here.

 Audrey follows me.

 I am carrying my glasses (being worn), the gaming glove (being worn),
 the Magic: The Gathering cards, Gibs's lacrosse stick, the phone, the

 crimson candle, the cyan candle, the jade candle, the umber candle,

 I take off my glasses and put the shades on. Things get considerably

 "What does a plus mean?" asks Audrey. "On a home pregnancy test? It
 means that you're not pregnant. Thank God."

 "Did you have a close call or something?"

 "Yes, <span class="floydstyle em">we</span> had a close call. Don't you remember? It wasn't that
 long ago. I had got off ICQ talking to one of your ex-girlfriends the
 night before. She told me that you, quote, 'wig out' when spoken to in
 Elvish or some other made-up language along those lines."

 Audrey continues her story, but I start to get a flood of memories
 back from that night. I had actually deigned to go out clubbing with
 her for a night a few weeks back. (I usually don't, as I am such a
 lousy, self-conscious dancer.) She was wearing this tight little gray
 dress with slight horizontal lines across it, made out of this fuzzy
 fabric -- the outfit practically squealed 'do me' by itself.

 Audrey was grinding her way up against me every time I went onto the
 floor. I just seizured out. That's the only way I know how to dance. I
 almost never really consume much alcohol, but that night I was taking
 pull after pull of some Safeway Vodka that Sydney had smuggled into
 the club as if the contents of the bottle were nothing more innocuous
 than Mexican Kool-Aid. Audrey and I took a cab back to her place, and
 we were all over one another before we could find the light switch.

 She was on top of me for what seemed like the better part of an hour
 when she dipped down and whispered something into my ear.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Tye-mela'ne</span>. It's Tolkein Elvish for 'I love you.' We don't
 seem to say that to each other very much, but even drunk I instantly
 translated what she said and I... well, I went off like a Soviet
 Catapult: unexpectedly, unpredictably, and altogether quite messily.

 I hadn't thought about it -- about the consequences of it -- until
 just right now. I didn't mean for her to go through a pregnancy scare
 like that by herself. I just wasn't thinking about the details.

 (For what it's worth, the story that Audrey related as I had this
 flashback was pretty much exactly like mine, except that she said that
 we only jammed for something like fifteen minutes. She's got this
 crazy, post-Einsteinian view of how time really works though, so don't
 believe her.)

 The gate is made up of interwoven metal links, but due to the lack of

 I flip through a few pages, but nothing really catches my eye. I'm
 sure that some long dead monk or priest who nearly acquired whatever
 the 14th century version of repetitive motion syndrome in writing this

 the words just seem to roll off my eyeballs in a splash of drama and
 desperate Calligraphy.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Southern Edge</span>
 This is the southern-most section of the Mall. There's a large block

 (west) and party favors store (east).
 The spectre is here.

 Audrey follows me.

 The spectre heads off to the south.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Christ's Candles</span>
 The Candle Store is the second-most picketed store, right after
 Choad's. It used to be a lot worse when it was a nail and board
 emporium, though. Some old and independently wealthy latin guy owns
 the place, though, and he just doesn't care about the Cash-In of the
 Christ.

 Christ's Candles is decked out in a similar manner to the Bead Store,
 hippie stuff and dark shadows even when the power isn't completely
 out. This isn't the kind of city where one can set up a number of
 candles on stands like in the video to 'Wrapped Around Your Finger,'
 so instead all the candles and other objects are on shelves.

 The floorspace towards the rear of the store is completely taken up by
 the long display table against the western wall.

 Audrey follows me.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Party On Central</span>
 This store is mostly unfurnished, with a low, bare ceiling, cold floor
 covered in cheap carpeting, and blankets and rugs thumb-tacked up to
 hide the peeling wallpaper and crumbling drywall.

 The contents of the room are a cluttered mess, as this place seems to
 be more of a craftsman's think-tank and construction area than pure
 chamber for commerce like so many other shops in the Mall. There's a
 workdesk and mirror along the northern wall and a file cabinet across
 from it. A small window is visible behind some junk, and directly
 across from the entrance are seven masks attached to the back wall in
 a proud display. Attached to one of the naked support beams is a disco
 laser pointer.

 Audrey follows me.

 Gibs is here.

 Audrey follows me.

 "She was here, Duffy. She was beautiful."

 "Who was? Casey? Where's Casey?"

 "Casey... " Gibs turns and looks at me for the first time since I came
 back. "No... not poor Casey. We finished up getting all the wreckage
 out of the way and as I looked up Casey was entranced by the most
 beautiful creature I have ever seen. Her skin was so pale, so fragile.
 She had this dark shock of bangs that framed her perfect face. As soon
 as I looked up, I froze. But she had locked eyes with Casey. I knew
 her name was Kali, but not how. Casey didn't seem to be able to move,
 at first, just like me. Then -- "

 "It was a vampire, Gibs. I was hoping we'd avoid one, but -- "

 I hate going in here, but I have apparently been a patron enough times
 to notice how peculiar the store is without its overhead fluorescent
 spotlights. The low light received from outside produces oddly-angled
 little shadows, albeit (apparently) non-sentient ones.

 There are two long rows of shelves along the north-south orient of the
 store, and a cashier's counter in back.
 The crucified girl is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>examine girl

 The crucified girl seems to be of mild Hispanic descent. Her features
 are slightly olive, her hair dark and her eyes stained all the round
 by blood. She is wearing a torn black tank top, blue bandana with
 floral print, and sleek pair of tight shorts. Her build is slight --
 she is probably about five foot five at most, with slim, athletic
 legs.

 She has not been dead long as she is just a few degrees cooler than
 living human flesh ought to be.

 She is dead.

 "I don't think Casey has a lot of time," says Gibs. "I don't remember
 as much D&D crap as you do, Duffy, but I'm thinking she has maybe
 fifteen minutes."

 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area and I can only see about half of
 it from here due to the lack of light -- the entire western end of it
 is cloaked in darkness. There are a number of cheap square tables and
 static plastic chairs bolted to the floor here, although a few have
 somehow broken off and are loose.

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. They carry a large assortment
 of tabs, pills, drugs and spices. The Court has another section to the
 west, and there is an exit east from where we came.

 Audrey lets out a little surprised 'yip!' and runs over towards me.

 "Jarret!" she says, "I felt something brush up against my leg!
 Something's here, in this area with us!" Before I can pooh-pooh her
 objections to this area, a metal chair comes flying at us. It appears
 as if a poltergeist has infected the food court.
 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,
 a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts
 are here.
 Casey is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 Some chair parts come flying right at me!

 Some chair parts strike me, and I take a little bit of damage.

 I notice something moving over in the far corner of the Food Court.
 It's a girl. She is wearing a reserved violet dress and has the most
 perfect, slim little figure I have ever seen.

 The vampire, I guess. It has to be; she's just as stunning as Gibs
 said.

 Focusing harder, I see Casey beside her, unmoving, defeated,
 completely obedient. The vampire whispers softly to her -- Casey snaps
 back into proper consciousness, and after a moment begins to look at
 her with loving trust. They are both several yards away, but I can
 make what the vampire says to her perfectly: <span class="floydstyle em">Follow me, my</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">pet.</span>

 The vampire heads off to the west.

 Casey heads off to the west.

>call vampire

 Some chair parts are drawn up from the floor and thrown at me!

 I dodge the item, though.

>examine table

 This table is a longish one, six or seven people could sit on a single
 side of it and eat comfortably.

 Something roughly picks up a fluorescent light and throws it at me!

 A fluorescent light strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

 I can't go that way.  I can go west to the food court's west half,
 east to the corridor, or northeast to a health store.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green which some junior ad exec no doubt thinks promotes quick sales
 decisions, when all it truly does is make customers eager to get the
 hell out before they add an equally off-putting color to the
 surrounding by use of their own acrid vomit.

 In the rear of the store is a modest plastic counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Further behind that is a closed metal door that
 really clashes with what's going on otherwise, stylistically.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.

 Exits lead to the southwest and through the door.

 "There should <span class="floydstyle em">surely</span> be some garlic here," I say to myself...

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>open door

 "I'm going to take a quick look below. Be right back."
 Opened.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle em">Basement to the Nutrition Store</span>
 I descend the stairs and enter the basement. The air is at least
 twenty degrees cooler down here than it is up above and it has a bit
 of a tangy, acrid -- almost 'chewy' quality to it. My breath turns
 into wispy, stringy clouds the instant it leaves my lips and I begin
 to feel my very bones come across a deep chill. I usually prefer
 winter to summer, so normally I wouldn't be put off by the frost down
 here and a few bad smells, but there's something different about the
 chill in the air down here. The temperature of the air seems
 malevolent, almost.

 The ceiling of the basement is about five and a half feet high, so I
 have to lurch over like I'm the hunchback of Notre Dork just to get
 around. The walls have a very rough texture to them, as if they were
 blasted away and then sanded down in a very half-assed manner.

 The corridor continues into darkness to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">First Basement Corridor</span>
 The light is very poor in this room, all of it coming from what can
 seep and pour through the metal door up above. The floor has turned to
 earth, however, and the walls seem to have a texture wholly different
 from the blasted rock earlier in the corridor. I can't say I'm totally
 suprised to find this area down here below the Mall, as rumor was that
 the place was built upon some burial grounds. I just never knew that
 they were, in parts, integrated.

 Exits lead south and further on to the north.

>get earth

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The basement ceiling gets much taller in this room, about up to 15
 feet or so, I'd guess. At the very top is a small torch, which is
 providing a fair bit of the light in the room -- the rest of it is
 reflected from the coffin in the corner.

 The ground is no longer soft earth, either, but rather blocks of cold
 stone. The walls are made of some kind of brick which reflects a bit
 of light as well, although nowhere near as well as the coffin.

 A support beam has been installed next to the coffin. Beyond it, to
 the right, is a small and very dark alcove.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Alcove</span>
 I practically have to crawl to get into this little cave-like section
 cut away from the basement. The light is gobbled up from something
 inside, as nothing from the coffin room manages to get in here.

 The only thing of note here is a very small trestle up against the
 wall.

>examine trestle

 In the corner of the alcove is a single trestle. It's obviously
 rotting away, and emitting a little bit of an old musty smell. It
 stands about two feet high and looks as if it might crumble at any
 time.

 The trestle has a garlic clove on it.

>get garlic

 I take the garlic.

 I hear metallic stone sliding up against metallic stone coming from
 the next room.

>get trestle

 I can't take that.

 The sound is so soft, but I hear something brush up against the coffin
 walls. I... I can't bear to turn my head and look at what it is.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The ceiling in this room is unique within the basement, as it is
 actually enough up where I don't have to hunch. At the top of the
 ceiling is a single, lit torch, held at a diagonal against the wall
 with a bracket. All available light is strongly reflected from the
 coffin, which sits quietly in the corner of the room. The walls are
 made out of a flecked brick, and a support beam stands to the right of
 the coffin.

 Exits are south towards the stairs and east into a tight alcove.
 The lid is here.

 The mummy exits the coffin.

 The mummy slowly begins to moan, seemingly within a weary, endless
 pain. It quickly shifts this to a scream. Its keen is of a deep tenor,
 and it begins thrashing about. Small scraps of deteriorating bandages
 fall from its person and onto the floor.

 The mummy strikes the support beam! Chunks of the ceiling fall
 downwards and it sounds as if the entire Mall has collapsed a little.

 The mummy attacks and hits me!

 I feel awful after that last touch.

>hit mummy with stick

 I attack, but miss the mummy!

 The mummy attacks and hits me!

>throw menorah at torch

 I knock the torch off of the bracket! The torch plummets to the
 ground, but on the way down it strikes the mummy! The mummy quickly
 catches fire and lets out a set of horrible screams. It begins to
 flail about wildly, but I'm able to stay out of its way. Within
 moments the fire consumes most of the mummy and I give the charred
 skeletal and bandage bits that are left a helpful kick.

 The mummy is reduced to extinguished, dusty chunks.

>get menorah

 I take it.

 There's a flash of pain right where the mummy first struck me.

>light menorah

 I can't get that to work.

>status

 I have a light wound.

>examine mummy

 It's covered in strips of treated linen, except for the face, which is
 exposed completely. The skin on its face is stretched tightly over the
 angular and hardened skull, which at one time, millennia ago, may have
 been handsome.

 It is dressed in dry, crisp rags that crackle with every movement. The
 rags look dusty, pained... without a hint of humidity and with no
 possibility of moisture.

 Modern myth indicates that mummies are riddled with diseases that
 cause a quick and painful rotting in their hosts.

 It  is dead.

>get mummy

 The mummy is too heavy for me to lift.

 Got it.

 There's a dull, raw ache on the left side of my jaw. I try to rub it
 away, but it doesn't help.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">First Basement Corridor</span>
 This stretch of corridor is little more than a narrow, forgotten
 passageway. Soft earth makes up the floor, a distinct change from the
 cement seen to the south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Basement to the Nutrition Store</span>
 The temperature of the air down here in the basement is quite cold,
 probably no more than thirty degrees Fahrenheit. The ceiling is just
 over five feet high, and the walls have a very rough texture to them,
 as if they were blasted away and then poorly sanded.

 My right hand has started to throb, and I take a closer look at it --
 it's starting to blacken a little bit. I suspect this is from the
 mummy.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green and contrast with the subdued nature of the shelves and all the
 jars of pills placed upon them.

 In the rear of the store is a modest wood counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Even further, behind the counter and register,
 is a metal door.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.
 Audrey and Gibs are here.

 "Jarret, are you okay? What happened down there?"

 "The mummy... it touched me," I say. It's tough to get the words out
 of my throat as it seems so dry and craggy.

 "Do you think -- " Audrey pauses for a sec -- "Did it infect you with
 something? Oh, goddess. Okay, let's find something to put on it.
 Something's got to help the pain."

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area, and I can only make out about
 half of it from here. (The entire west end is shrouded in darkness.)

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. The Court has another section
 to the west, and there is an exit east from where we originally came.
 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,
 a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts
 are here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 Something roughly picks up a short gray table and throws it at me!

 A short gray table strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

 My hand has begun to rot away.

>throw rags on poltergeist

 The poltergeist is invisible, so I'd have no way to target it.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, West Edge</span>
 The area is free from the wreckage. Gibs, though is just standing up,
 completely motionless, facing the inky blackness that shrouds the Food
 Court from here. Casey is nowhere to be found.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Central Corridor</span>
 This stretch of the Mall hallway is covered with just a bit of rubble.
 There are clear exits to the west and south. The gate to the Record
 Store is down to the north.
 The cross is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 The rotting sickness has spread to my body.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Eastern Edge</span>
 This bit of hallway features an enormous and beautiful fountain. There
 are exits in all four primary compass directions.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>enter fountain

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Eastern Edge, in the fountain</span>
 This bit of hallway features an enormous and beautiful fountain. There

 The spectre arrives from the west.

 I have a lot of minor scratches, but will be okay, since I still have

 A little more water trickles into the fountain.

 The spectre heads off to the north.

>go west

 I will have to get out of the fountain first.

>out

 I get out of the fountain.

 I collapse to the floor. The pain all over my body has gone from a
 throbbing that I can deal with to sharp, sudden piercings of agony...
 Audrey sees me fall. She comes to my side.

 I lash out to keep her away. I see her talking to me, pleading to get
 up and get better, but my ears don't pick up the sound. I try to move
 my hands up to clear them, but there's just molding and seeping sacs
 of pus where my ears once were.

 I try to tell her to stay away and to burn me so that I infect no one
 else, but I can't make the words escape. She cradles me in her arms
 anyway. I am up against her cool body, she is stroking my forehead
 with her hands. I shift. My right arm begins to separate and cracks
 off into my jacket. Everything feels so warm, this fever is
 terrible...

 <span class="floydstyle em">Christ's Candles</span>
 The Candle Store is the second-most picketed store, right after
 Choad's. It used to be a lot worse when it was a nail and board
 emporium, though. Some old and independently wealthy latin guy owns
 the place, though, and he just doesn't care about the Cash-In of the
 Christ.

 Christ's Candles is decked out in a similar manner to the Bead Store,
 hippie stuff and dark shadows even when the power isn't completely
 out. This isn't the kind of city where one can set up a number of
 candles on stands like in the video to 'Wrapped Around Your Finger,'
 so instead all the candles and other objects are on shelves.

 The floorspace towards the rear of the store is completely taken up by
 the long display table against the western wall.
 Audrey is here.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Southern Edge</span>
 This is the southern-most section of the Mall. There's a large block
 of impenetrable cement to the south, which covers over the failed
 Outlet Store, and two paths to two other stores: the candle store
 (west) and party favors store (east).
 The spectre and a Revenant are here.

 Audrey follows me.

 The spectre heads off to the north.

 The Revenant heads off to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Central Corridor</span>

 The spectre heads off to the south.

 The Revenant heads off to the west.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, West Edge</span>
 The area is free from the wreckage. Gibs, though is just standing up,
 completely motionless, facing the inky blackness that shrouds the Food
 Court from here. Casey is nowhere to be found.
 Gibs and a Revenant are here.

 Audrey follows me.

 "She was here, Duffy. She was beautiful."

 "Who was? Casey? Where's Casey?"

 "Casey... " Gibs turns and looks at me for the first time since I came
 back. "No... not poor Casey. We finished up getting all the wreckage
 out of the way and as I looked up Casey was entranced by the most
 beautiful creature I have ever seen. Her skin was so pale, so fragile.
 She had this dark shock of bangs that framed her perfect face. As soon
 as I looked up, I froze. But she had locked eyes with Casey. I knew
 her name was Kali, but not how. Casey didn't seem to be able to move,
 at first, just like me. Then -- "

 "It was a vampire, Gibs. I was hoping we'd avoid one, but -- "

 "She took Casey by the hand and they both walked that way... into the
 darkness."

 The Revenant heads off to the west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area and I can only see about half of
 it from here due to the lack of light -- the entire western end of it
 is cloaked in darkness. There are a number of cheap square tables and
 static plastic chairs bolted to the floor here, although a few have
 somehow broken off and are loose.

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. They carry a large assortment
 of tabs, pills, drugs and spices. The Court has another section to the
 west, and there is an exit east from where we came.

 Audrey lets out a little surprised 'yip!' and runs over towards me.

 "Jarret!" she says, "I felt something brush up against my leg!
 Something's here, in this area with us!" Before I can pooh-pooh her
 objections to this area, a metal chair comes flying at us. It appears
 as if a poltergeist has infected the food court.
 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,
 a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts
 are here.
 The vampire, Casey, and a Revenant are here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 A fluorescent light comes flying right at me!

 I dodge the item, though.

 The Revenant heads off to the west.

 I notice something moving over in the far corner of the Food Court.
 It's a girl. She is wearing a reserved violet dress and has the most
 perfect, slim little figure I have ever seen.

 The vampire, I guess. It has to be; she's just as stunning as Gibs
 said.

 Focusing harder, I see Casey beside her, unmoving, defeated,
 completely obedient. The vampire whispers softly to her -- Casey snaps
 back into proper consciousness, and after a moment begins to look at
 her with loving trust. They are both several yards away, but I can
 make what the vampire says to her perfectly: <span class="floydstyle em">Follow me, my</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">pet.</span>

 The vampire heads off to the west.

 Casey heads off to the west.

>go west

 Something roughly picks up a metal chair and throws it at me!

 A metal chair strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green which some junior ad exec no doubt thinks promotes quick sales
 decisions, when all it truly does is make customers eager to get the
 hell out before they add an equally off-putting color to the
 surrounding by use of their own acrid vomit.

 In the rear of the store is a modest plastic counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Further behind that is a closed metal door that
 really clashes with what's going on otherwise, stylistically.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.

 Exits lead to the southwest and through the door.

 "There should <span class="floydstyle em">surely</span> be some garlic here," I say to myself...

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 A horrible scream pierces the air, originating from the far end of the
 Food Court.

>go down

 (opening the door first)
 "I'm going to take a quick look below. Be right back."
 Opened.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Basement to the Nutrition Store</span>
 I descend the stairs and enter the basement. The air is at least
 twenty degrees cooler down here than it is up above and it has a bit
 of a tangy, acrid -- almost 'chewy' quality to it. My breath turns
 into wispy, stringy clouds the instant it leaves my lips and I begin
 to feel my very bones come across a deep chill. I usually prefer
 winter to summer, so normally I wouldn't be put off by the frost down
 here and a few bad smells, but there's something different about the
 chill in the air down here. The temperature of the air seems
 malevolent, almost.

 The ceiling of the basement is about five and a half feet high, so I
 have to lurch over like I'm the hunchback of Notre Dork just to get
 around. The walls have a very rough texture to them, as if they were
 blasted away and then sanded down in a very half-assed manner.

 The corridor continues into darkness to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">First Basement Corridor</span>
 The light is very poor in this room, all of it coming from what can
 seep and pour through the metal door up above. The floor has turned to
 earth, however, and the walls seem to have a texture wholly different
 from the blasted rock earlier in the corridor. I can't say I'm totally
 suprised to find this area down here below the Mall, as rumor was that
 the place was built upon some burial grounds. I just never knew that
 they were, in parts, integrated.

 Exits lead south and further on to the north.

 "I don't think Casey has a lot of time," says Gibs. "I don't remember
 as much D&D crap as you do, Duffy, but I'm thinking she has maybe
 fifteen minutes."

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The basement ceiling gets much taller in this room, about up to 15
 feet or so, I'd guess. At the very top is a small torch, which is
 providing a fair bit of the light in the room -- the rest of it is
 reflected from the coffin in the corner.

 The ground is no longer soft earth, either, but rather blocks of cold
 stone. The walls are made of some kind of brick which reflects a bit
 of light as well, although nowhere near as well as the coffin.

 A support beam has been installed next to the coffin. Beyond it, to
 the right, is a small and very dark alcove.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Alcove</span>
 I practically have to crawl to get into this little cave-like section
 cut away from the basement. The light is gobbled up from something
 inside, as nothing from the coffin room manages to get in here.

 The only thing of note here is a very small trestle up against the
 wall.

>get garlic

 I take the garlic.

 I hear metallic stone sliding up against metallic stone coming from
 the next room.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>

 the coffin.

 Exits are south towards the stairs and east into a tight alcove.
 The lid is here.

 I see two bandaged hands slowly emerge from darkness. They grope at
 the sides of the coffin. A figure rises, I see first the unwrapped,
 rotting head and then the torso, wound tight with stinking fibers and
 rags.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The mummy turns its head directly towards me.</span>

>throw menorah at torch

 I knock the torch off of the bracket! The torch falls to the ground,
 where the cold fog quickly extinguishes it.

 The mummy exits the coffin.

 The mummy slowly begins to moan, seemingly within a weary, endless
 pain. It quickly shifts this to a scream. Its keen is of a deep tenor,
 and it begins thrashing about. Small scraps of deteriorating bandages
 fall from its person and onto the floor.

 The mummy strikes the support beam! Chunks of the ceiling fall
 downwards and it sounds as if the entire Mall has collapsed a little.

 The chaos breaks me out of my fear-trance. I feel I could flee now if
 I wanted to try.

 The mummy attacks and hits me!

 I feel awful after that last touch.

 they were, in parts, integrated.

 Exits lead south and further on to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The basement ceiling gets much taller in this room, about up to 15
 feet or so, I'd guess. At the very top is a small torch, which is
 providing a fair bit of the light in the room -- the rest of it is
 reflected from the coffin in the corner.

 The ground is no longer soft earth, either, but rather blocks of cold
 stone. The walls are made of some kind of brick which reflects a bit
 of light as well, although nowhere near as well as the coffin.

 A support beam has been installed next to the coffin. Beyond it, to
 the right, is a small and very dark alcove.

 "I don't think Casey has a lot of time," says Gibs. "I don't remember
 as much D&D crap as you do, Duffy, but I'm thinking she has maybe
 fifteen minutes."

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Alcove</span>
 I practically have to crawl to get into this little cave-like section
 cut away from the basement. The light is gobbled up from something
 inside, as nothing from the coffin room manages to get in here.

 The only thing of note here is a very small trestle up against the
 wall.

>examine trestle

 In the corner of the alcove is a single trestle. It's obviously
 rotting away, and emitting a little bit of an old musty smell. It
 stands about two feet high and looks as if it might crumble at any
 time.

 The trestle has a garlic clove on it.

>get garlic

 I take the garlic.

 I hear metallic stone sliding up against metallic stone coming from
 the next room.

>wait

 Time passes...

 The sound is so soft, but I hear something brush up against the coffin
 walls. I... I can't bear to turn my head and look at what it is.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The ceiling in this room is unique within the basement, as it is
 actually enough up where I don't have to hunch. At the top of the
 ceiling is a single, lit torch, held at a diagonal against the wall
 with a bracket. All available light is strongly reflected from the
 coffin, which sits quietly in the corner of the room. The walls are
 made out of a flecked brick, and a support beam stands to the right of
 the coffin.

 Exits are south towards the stairs and east into a tight alcove.
 The lid is here.

 The mummy exits the coffin.

 The mummy slowly begins to moan, seemingly within a weary, endless
 pain. It quickly shifts this to a scream. Its keen is of a deep tenor,
 and it begins thrashing about. Small scraps of deteriorating bandages
 fall from its person and onto the floor.

 The mummy strikes the support beam! Chunks of the ceiling fall
 downwards and it sounds as if the entire Mall has collapsed a little.

 The mummy attacks and hits me!

 I feel awful after that last touch.

>throw menorah at torch

 I knock the torch off of the bracket! The torch plummets to the
 ground, but on the way down it strikes the mummy! The mummy quickly
 catches fire and lets out a set of horrible screams. It begins to
 flail about wildly, but I'm able to stay out of its way. Within
 moments the fire consumes most of the mummy and I give the charred
 skeletal and bandage bits that are left a helpful kick.

 The mummy is reduced to extinguished, dusty chunks.

>get rags

 Got it.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">First Basement Corridor</span>
 This stretch of corridor is little more than a narrow, forgotten
 passageway. Soft earth makes up the floor, a distinct change from the
 cement seen to the south.

 There's a flash of pain right where the mummy first struck me.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Basement to the Nutrition Store</span>
 The temperature of the air down here in the basement is quite cold,
 probably no more than thirty degrees Fahrenheit. The ceiling is just
 over five feet high, and the walls have a very rough texture to them,
 as if they were blasted away and then poorly sanded.

>go south

 I can't go that way.  I can go up to a health store or north to a
 basement corridor.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green and contrast with the subdued nature of the shelves and all the
 jars of pills placed upon them.

 In the rear of the store is a modest wood counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Even further, behind the counter and register,
 is a metal door.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.
 Audrey and Gibs are here.

 "Jarret, are you okay? What happened down there?"

 "The mummy... it touched me," I say. It's tough to get the words out
 of my throat as it seems so dry and craggy.

 "Do you think -- " Audrey pauses for a sec -- "Did it infect you with
 something? Oh, goddess. Okay, let's find something to put on it.
 Something's got to help the pain."

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area, and I can only make out about
 half of it from here. (The entire west end is shrouded in darkness.)

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. The Court has another section
 to the west, and there is an exit east from where we originally came.
 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,
 a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts
 are here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 A broken chair is drawn up from the floor and thrown at me!

 A broken chair strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

 The area is free from the wreckage. Gibs, though is just standing up,
 completely motionless, facing the inky blackness that shrouds the Food
 Court from here. Casey is nowhere to be found.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Central Corridor</span>
 This stretch of the Mall hallway is covered with just a bit of rubble.
 There are clear exits to the west and south. The gate to the Record
 Store is down to the north.
 The cross is here.
 The spectre is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 My right hand has started to throb, and I take a closer look at it --
 it's starting to blacken a little bit. I suspect this is from the
 mummy.

 The spectre heads off to the north.

 Something roughly picks up a broken chair and throws it at me!

 A broken chair strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

>hit poltergeist with cross

 The poltergeist is invisible, so I have no way of really tracking it.
 Likewise, it can't directly affect me with its transparent non-body.

 An urn comes flying right at me!

 An urn strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

 The rotting sickness has spread to my body.

>show cross

 Try having me show something to someone in particular.

>show cross to poltergeist

 The poltergeist doesn't seem too interested in the cross.

>examine poltergeist

 Poltergeists are a form of invisible undead that whines for attention
 by flinging shit at people. Of all the creatures and spirits that make
 up the hierarchy of walking dead, these mewling little bitches are the
 ones I despise with the most passion. They're the worst drama queens
 in the underworld. In reality, 'poltergeists' are just the
 manifestations of picked-on, spoiled little emo or Goth kids... I
 can't imagine what this demonically-realized little ghost brat has
 going on underneath the surface.

 The poltergeist hurls the garlic clove at me!

 The garlic clove strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

 Poltergeists can not communicate that way.

 There's a dull, raw ache on the left side of my jaw. I try to rub it

 The poltergeist picks up Gibs's lacrosse stick and throws it towards

 I dodge the item, though.

 "Hey, Duffy... Casey's got maybe 12 minutes left by my count," says
 Gibs.

>examine it

 (assuming you mean the urn)
 This rather large urn is crafted in the shape of an upside-down
 mushroom. It's a base silver in color with a floral pattern painted on
 top.

 The poltergeist hurls a metal chair at me!

 A metal chair strikes me, and I take a little bit of damage.

 I collapse to the floor. The pain all over my body has gone from a
 throbbing that I can deal with to sharp, sudden piercings of agony...
 Audrey sees me fall. She comes to my side.

 I lash out to keep her away. I see her talking to me, pleading to get
 up and get better, but my ears don't pick up the sound. I try to move
 my hands up to clear them, but there's just molding and seeping sacs
 of pus where my ears once were.

 I try to tell her to stay away and to burn me so that I infect no one
 else, but I can't make the words escape. She cradles me in her arms
 anyway. I am up against her cool body, she is stroking my forehead
 with her hands. I shift. My right arm begins to separate and cracks
 off into my jacket. Everything feels so warm, this fever is

 It is not possible to get the game in an unwinnable state. General
 advice would be to role play Duffy and make those choices that he
 faces which he is seemingly incapable of making on his own, as well as
 talk at length to the other characters that you will encounter.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Sunglasses Hut</span>
 I'm not quite sure why sunglasses and shades are only sold in 'huts'
 but this store is very un-hut like. There are three very solid walls
 here and a roof made not of thatch, but poured, cracking cement. The
 floor is hardly comprised of peat or mud, but the same tile present
 everywhere else in the Mall.

 A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with
 the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still
 function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the
 room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters
 of the Sunglasses Hut.

 I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my
 manager at the D&D store. I acquired a little bit of trivia regarding
 this place (for instance, the center display case will open if it's

>talk to audrey

 Please select one:

 (1) "Whoa, that was you in the vision! What does a plus mean?"

>1


 "What does a plus mean?" asks Audrey. "On a home pregnancy test? It
 means that you're not pregnant. Thank God."

 "Did you have a close call or something?"

 "Yes, <span class="floydstyle em">we</span> had a close call. Don't you remember? It wasn't that
 long ago. I had got off ICQ talking to one of your ex-girlfriends the
 night before. She told me that you, quote, 'wig out' when spoken to in
 Elvish or some other made-up language along those lines."

 Audrey continues her story, but I start to get a flood of memories
 back from that night. I had actually deigned to go out clubbing with
 her for a night a few weeks back. (I usually don't, as I am such a
 lousy, self-conscious dancer.) She was wearing this tight little gray
 dress with slight horizontal lines across it, made out of this fuzzy
 fabric -- the outfit practically squealed 'do me' by itself.

 Audrey was grinding her way up against me every time I went onto the
 floor. I just seizured out. That's the only way I know how to dance. I
 almost never really consume much alcohol, but that night I was taking
 pull after pull of some Safeway Vodka that Sydney had smuggled into
 the club as if the contents of the bottle were nothing more innocuous
 than Mexican Kool-Aid. Audrey and I took a cab back to her place, and
 we were all over one another before we could find the light switch.

 She was on top of me for what seemed like the better part of an hour
 when she dipped down and whispered something into my ear.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Tye-mela'ne</span>. It's Tolkein Elvish for 'I love you.' We don't
 seem to say that to each other very much, but even drunk I instantly
 translated what she said and I... well, I went off like a Soviet
 Catapult: unexpectedly, unpredictably, and altogether quite messily.

 I hadn't thought about it -- about the consequences of it -- until
 just right now. I didn't mean for her to go through a pregnancy scare
 like that by herself. I just wasn't thinking about the details.

 (For what it's worth, the story that Audrey related as I had this
 flashback was pretty much exactly like mine, except that she said that
 we only jammed for something like fifteen minutes. She's got this
 crazy, post-Einsteinian view of how time really works though, so don't
 believe her.)

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green and contrast with the subdued nature of the shelves and all the
 jars of pills placed upon them.

 In the rear of the store is a modest wood counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Even further, behind the counter and register,
 is a metal door.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 My hand has begun to rot away.

 Audrey looks at me with a little bit of inquisitive sympathy, but I
 don't say or reveal anything.

 are exits in all four primary compass directions.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Sunglasses Hut</span>
 I'm not quite sure why sunglasses and shades are only sold in 'huts'
 but this store is very un-hut like. There are three very solid walls
 here and a roof made not of thatch, but poured, cracking cement. The
 floor is hardly comprised of peat or mud, but the same tile present
 everywhere else in the Mall.

 A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with
 the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still
 function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the
 room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters
 of the Sunglasses Hut.

 I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my
 manager at the D&D store. I acquired a little bit of trivia regarding
 this place (for instance, the center display case will open if it's
 tapped upon) but nothing useful otherwise.

 also a few more stores to the west, with the Mall passageways
 expanding to all four directions at that point.

 Exits lead west to the rest of the Mall, and inside to the elevator.

 In the center of the corridor is a sculpted marble statue.

 There's a dull, raw ache on the left side of my jaw. I try to rub it
 away, but it doesn't help.

 Some chair parts are drawn up from the floor and thrown at me!

 I dodge the item, though.

>examine light

 This light fixture is from a chunk of the Mall's ceiling. It's at

 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area, and I can only make out about
 half of it from here. (The entire west end is shrouded in darkness.)

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. The Court has another section
 to the west, and there is an exit east from where we originally came.
 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,
 a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts
 are here.
 Audrey and Gibs are here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Eastern Edge</span>
 This bit of hallway features an enormous and beautiful fountain. There

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 My right hand has started to throb, and I take a closer look at it --
 it's starting to blacken a little bit. I suspect this is from the
 mummy.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, East Edge</span>
 This is the first level, or ground floor, of the Funtime Teen Mall.
 The lone Mall Exit leads in a westerly direction, past a few more
 stretches of darkness-enveloped corridor, and the Food Court. There's
 also a few more stores to the west, with the Mall passageways
 expanding to all four directions at that point.

 Exits lead west to the rest of the Mall, and inside to the elevator.

 In the center of the corridor is a sculpted marble statue.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>in

 Audrey says, "We'll wait down here for you."

 <span class="floydstyle em">Elevator</span>
 The elevator smells terrible, strongly of untreated or unembalmed
 cadavers. There are three buttons here in the elevator labelled 'up,'
 'down' and 'open doors.'

 I'm currently on the <span class="floydstyle em">first</span> level of the Mall. Aside from the
 operational panel, there is little else here in the lift.

 My hand has begun to rot away.

>press up

 I press the up button. After a few seconds, the elevator transports me
 to the second level of the Mall.

>press open

 The doors are now open.

>out


 <span class="floydstyle em">Before the Elevator</span>
 The floor of the Mall comes up against a rail, forming a barrier which
 prevents further (sane) western travel. The bottom (ground floor)
 level can be viewed with ease, though, as the guardrail mainly
 prevents kids -- future productive Mall denizens! -- from ragdolling
 their way off the edge.

 There is a badly-cracked kiosk in the center of the hallway. At the
 far end of the rail is an elevator.
 There is a crystal ball holder here.

 The rotting sickness has spread to my body.

>go south

 There's not a path in that direction.

 There are exits north to the Jewelry Store, in towards the Elevator
 and east towards the east side of the Mall.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side Corridor</span>
 There's only one more stretch of corridor on this level before one
 gets to the elevator, which leads down to the ground floor. To the
 south of this area is the Bead Store, exits otherwise lead west and
 east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side of the Mall</span>
 I'm at the eastern side of the Mall. To the north is Choad's Sporting
 Goods. My store is a bit to the east, and the Bead Store a bit to the
 west.

 There is a table here, set adjacent to the Sporting Goods store.

>go south

 I can't go that way.  I can go west to the beginning of the east wing,
 east to the eastern end of the mall, or north to Choad's Sporting
 Goods.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Choad's Sporting Goods</span>
 Choad's Sporting Goods exists under the unfortunate circumstance that
 the owner's name translates into Bengali as 'fuck.' Once or twice a
 year there will be a demonstration or protest from a bunch of local
 student Hindus, but nothing ever changes.

 The store is one of the larger ones in the Mall, about 40' wide and
 140' long. Ski jackets take up almost all the area towards the front
 of the store, as far as I can see, with the entire western wall filled
 with displays of discount tennis sneakers.

 There doesn't seem to be any rifles or shotguns for sale. (It appears
 as if Gibs's intuition was incorrect.)
 There is a circular jacket rack here.
 The ghoul is here.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side of the Mall</span>
 I'm at the eastern side of the Mall. To the north is Choad's Sporting

 There's a dull, raw ache on the left side of my jaw. I try to rub it

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Eastern End of the Mall</span>
 This is far east as the Mall goes. The Mall technically dips a bit as
 one goes west, as it was originally constructed upon a landfill.
 There's a three-sided advertising kiosk in the middle of the corridor.

 To the west is the Beads Store, Sporting Good Outlet and the (closed)
 Arcade.

 My store, the Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium, is to the south.

 "Hey, Duffy... Casey's got maybe 12 minutes left by my count," says
 Gibs.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side of the Mall</span>

 There's only one more stretch of corridor on this level before one

 south of this area is the Bead Store, exits otherwise lead west and
 east.

 I collapse to the floor. The pain all over my body has gone from a
 throbbing that I can deal with to sharp, sudden piercings of agony...
 Audrey sees me fall. She comes to my side.

 I lash out to keep her away. I see her talking to me, pleading to get
 up and get better, but my ears don't pick up the sound. I try to move
 my hands up to clear them, but there's just molding and seeping sacs
 of pus where my ears once were.

 I try to tell her to stay away and to burn me so that I infect no one
 else, but I can't make the words escape. She cradles me in her arms
 anyway. I am up against her cool body, she is stroking my forehead
 with her hands. I shift. My right arm begins to separate and cracks
 off into my jacket. Everything feels so warm, this fever is
 terrible...

 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area and I can only see about half of
 it from here due to the lack of light -- the entire western end of it
 is cloaked in darkness. There are a number of cheap square tables and
 static plastic chairs bolted to the floor here, although a few have
 somehow broken off and are loose.

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. They carry a large assortment
 of tabs, pills, drugs and spices. The Court has another section to the
 west, and there is an exit east from where we came.

 Audrey lets out a little surprised 'yip!' and runs over towards me.

 "Jarret!" she says, "I felt something brush up against my leg!
 Something's here, in this area with us!" Before I can pooh-pooh her
 objections to this area, a metal chair comes flying at us. It appears
 as if a poltergeist has infected the food court.
 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,
 a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts
 are here.
 Casey is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 Some chair parts come flying right at me!

 I dodge the item, though.

 I notice something moving over in the far corner of the Food Court.
 It's a girl. She is wearing a reserved violet dress and has the most
 perfect, slim little figure I have ever seen.

 The vampire, I guess. It has to be; she's just as stunning as Gibs
 said.

 Focusing harder, I see Casey beside her, unmoving, defeated,
 completely obedient. The vampire whispers softly to her -- Casey snaps
 back into proper consciousness, and after a moment begins to look at
 her with loving trust. They are both several yards away, but I can
 make what the vampire says to her perfectly: <span class="floydstyle em">Follow me, my</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">pet.</span>

 The vampire heads off to the west.

 Casey heads off to the west.

 A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table,

 This table is one of the smaller ones in the food court, ideal for

 Something roughly picks up a garbage can and throws it at me!

 I dodge the item, though.

>examine brown table

 This table is a longish one, six or seven people could sit on a single
 side of it and eat comfortably.

 My right hand has started to throb, and I take a closer look at it --
 it's starting to blacken a little bit. I suspect this is from the
 mummy.

>examine chair parts

 They are a collection of pieces that were once part of a larger, more
 whole (wholer?) chair.

>examine metal table

 I haven't encountered any "metal table".  (If you're sure you need to
 refer to that, try putting it another way.)

 The metal chair is shiny and foldable, but rusted out, so the advanced
 folding properties are not available.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green and contrast with the subdued nature of the shelves and all the
 jars of pills placed upon them.

 In the rear of the store is a modest wood counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Even further, behind the counter and register,
 is a metal door.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.

>go south

 I can't go that way.  I can go down to the basement entrance or
 southwest to the food court's east half.

>examine pills

 I take a quick look at the shelves and spot a jar of ointment. It
 catches my eye as its decked out in a bright purple label with the
 word 'GENERAL OINTMENT' in a canary Impact font. If I remember my
 general health studies classes, stuff like this has good
 disease-fighting capabilities.

 "Hey, Duffy... Casey's got maybe 12 minutes left by my count," says
 Gibs.

 away. The rest of the Food Court is to the east, and the final

 "REST!" bellows the Revenant. I'm momentarily taken back by his
 outburst: there are absolutely no other sounds audible this far into
 the Mall. "A sweet, everlasting relaxation that I so richly deserve.
 Many cultures have had many different names for it. Nirvana...
 Heaven... Ragnar?k..."

 "Actually, Ragnar?k wasn't a final state of bliss, like the Sanskrit
 Nirvana, but rather a foretelling of -- " The Revenant cuts me off and
 continues his monologue. What a complete cock!

 "A final resting place for a warrior such as I. It is as I deserve. I
 crave it, desperately... but first I must find the one that put me
 into this state and remove her from this world."

 I give the guy the fingerguns sign. "Good luck with that," I tell him.
 Jerk.

 Please select one:

 (1) "The vampire wasn't your killer, was she?"

 "She was not," the Revenant says quickly. "It is of little matter,
 however. Mistakes get made. She offered no real value to this world or
 any others. She will not be back for the foreseeable future."

 "That's excellent," I reply. "Thanks."

 "There is no need for thanks. It was not a favor I did, but an attempt
 to uncover the truth about my death." I give him a quick look of
 sympathy and understood pain, but it's totally fake. I'm hoping he
 can't determine my ruse, what with the flamb?ed face and eyes and
 everything. But either way he seems pretty relaxed.

 We've come to the last long hall. To the north, approximately fifty
 yards away, are the exit doors. Dawn has yet to creep up upon us. It's
 still pitch black outside. Freedom is all I can think of at this
 point.

 I take a single step forward. That's when she materializes.

 "Hello, Sydney," I say, intentionally agitating the spirit that thinks
 it's in total control.

 "Hi there, doll," she says in return. "What happened to her?" she
 asks, looking over towards Casey. "How unfortunate. I was hoping to

 "We have to get out of here before the sun rises. Otherwise she'll
 die," I say. "Get out of the way."

 "The door is shut by my command, Jarret. Though I'll confess that the
 thought of her turning to sawdust as the sun rises right before I take
 each of your lives is especially intriguing. We could do it that way.
 That's fine with me."

 "Shut up," suggests Audrey. "We know how to exorcise you, and we're
 going to do exactly that."

 Audrey turns towards me and looks at me with a kind of love and somber
 happiness that I have never before seen. "Read the passage from the
 book, Jarret..."
 The ghast's head is here.
 Sydney, Audrey, Gibs, and Casey are here.

 Gibs pipes up for a moment. "Casey's got probably ten minutes left at
 my count before the ichor spreads."

>read book

 I turn over the book and it opens to a section in the back. Just like
 in the <span class="floydstyle em">Dungeon Master's Guide</span> and, I suppose, <span class="floydstyle em">The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Bible,</span> this is where <span class="floydstyle em">all</span> the good bits are:

 <span class="floydstyle em">Tombs containing carrion, and hate within the ground</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">A claw-scratched forced Caesarian, who could not remain bound</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Groping, moaning pantomime, beasts within the air</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Rending tortured friends of mine, killing with a stare</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Stacked on a forgotten grave, crushing souls and mud</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Virgin souls we try to save, walls crying with blood</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Leave the host, this eve, you took -- no longer will you dine</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">The mart's collapse, the walls all shook -- your attention shall</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">be mine!</span>

 All the arrogance and jeering has left Sydney, and she remains
 hovering over with an expectant, slightly confused expression on her
 face. We've got her enraptured for the moment, it would seem.

 "We need someone to drink the water... But whoever does needs to be a
 virgin," says Audrey.

 hangs open in a particularly grotesque manner. The head formerly
 belonged to a guy named Randolph who would guilt people into taking
 his surveys and was always talking about all the women he met at his

 broadcast from two in the morning until six AM weekdays. I've known
 him for about a decade. He was my roommate for my three semesters at

 The Sierra Hobbies Gaming Glove is an inky black novelty gaming

 "What does a plus mean?" asks Audrey. "On a home pregnancy test? It
 means that you're not pregnant. Thank God."

 "Did you have a close call or something?"

 "Yes, <span class="floydstyle em">we</span> had a close call. Don't you remember? It wasn't that
 long ago. I had got off ICQ talking to one of your ex-girlfriends the
 night before. She told me that you, quote, 'wig out' when spoken to in
 Elvish or some other made-up language along those lines."

 Audrey continues her story, but I start to get a flood of memories
 back from that night. I had actually deigned to go out clubbing with
 her for a night a few weeks back. (I usually don't, as I am such a
 lousy, self-conscious dancer.) She was wearing this tight little gray
 dress with slight horizontal lines across it, made out of this fuzzy
 fabric -- the outfit practically squealed 'do me' by itself.

 Audrey was grinding her way up against me every time I went onto the
 floor. I just seizured out. That's the only way I know how to dance. I
 almost never really consume much alcohol, but that night I was taking
 pull after pull of some Safeway Vodka that Sydney had smuggled into
 the club as if the contents of the bottle were nothing more innocuous
 than Mexican Kool-Aid. Audrey and I took a cab back to her place, and
 we were all over one another before we could find the light switch.

 She was on top of me for what seemed like the better part of an hour
 when she dipped down and whispered something into my ear.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Tye-mela'ne</span>. It's Tolkein Elvish for 'I love you.' We don't
 seem to say that to each other very much, but even drunk I instantly
 translated what she said and I... well, I went off like a Soviet
 Catapult: unexpectedly, unpredictably, and altogether quite messily.

 I hadn't thought about it -- about the consequences of it -- until
 just right now. I didn't mean for her to go through a pregnancy scare
 like that by herself. I just wasn't thinking about the details.

 (For what it's worth, the story that Audrey related as I had this
 flashback was pretty much exactly like mine, except that she said that
 we only jammed for something like fifteen minutes. She's got this
 crazy, post-Einsteinian view of how time really works though, so don't
 believe her.)

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area, and I can only make out about
 half of it from here. (The entire west end is shrouded in darkness.)

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. The Court has another section
 to the west, and there is an exit east from where we originally came.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, West Edge</span>
 The area is free from the wreckage. Gibs, though is just standing up,
 completely motionless, facing the inky blackness that shrouds the Food
 Court from here. Casey is nowhere to be found.
 Barnaby's Big Gulp drink, a pleather purse, some socks, the torch
 (broken), the ointment jar, a fluorescent light, a garbage can, a
 brown table, a plastic chair, a metal chair, a short gray table, a
 broken chair, some chair parts are here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Central Corridor</span>

 This bit of hallway features an enormous and beautiful fountain. There

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, East Edge</span>
 This is the first level, or ground floor, of the Funtime Teen Mall.
 The lone Mall Exit leads in a westerly direction, past a few more
 stretches of darkness-enveloped corridor, and the Food Court. There's
 also a few more stores to the west, with the Mall passageways
 expanding to all four directions at that point.

 Exits lead west to the rest of the Mall, and inside to the elevator.

 In the center of the corridor is a sculpted marble statue.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 The kind gesture goes unnoticed by the cupid statue.

 The cross is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 The spectre arrives from the south.

>give urn to spectre

 That's not what the spectre seems to be looking for.

 The spectre heads off to the south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, Southern Edge</span>
 This is the southern-most section of the Mall. There's a large block
 of impenetrable cement to the south, which covers over the failed
 Outlet Store, and two paths to two other stores: the candle store
 (west) and party favors store (east).
 The spectre is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>follow spectre

 The spectre is right here.

>kiss spectre

 I try to get close, but the spectre resonates extreme cold from his
 person... much too painfully cold to touch.

 The spectre heads off to the west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Christ's Candles</span>
 The Candle Store is the second-most picketed store, right after
 Choad's. It used to be a lot worse when it was a nail and board
 emporium, though. Some old and independently wealthy latin guy owns
 the place, though, and he just doesn't care about the Cash-In of the
 Christ.

 Christ's Candles is decked out in a similar manner to the Bead Store,
 hippie stuff and dark shadows even when the power isn't completely
 out. This isn't the kind of city where one can set up a number of
 candles on stands like in the video to 'Wrapped Around Your Finger,'
 so instead all the candles and other objects are on shelves.

 The floorspace towards the rear of the store is completely taken up by
 the long display table against the western wall.
 The spectre is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>give water to spectre

 The spectre shakes his head sadly. "I'm not thirsty for that," he
 says. "Not at all..." His eyes narrow, his head tilts slightly to the
 side -- he's trying to communicate <span class="floydstyle em">something</span> to me, and
 unlike some of the other denizens of the Mall, it's not a horrible
 curse or disease.

 "Six minutes, Jarret," says Gibs.

 The spectre heads off to the east.

>go east

 Audrey says, "We'll wait down here for you."

 <span class="floydstyle em">Elevator</span>
 The elevator smells terrible, strongly of untreated or unembalmed
 cadavers. There are three buttons here in the elevator labelled 'up,'
 'down' and 'open doors.'

 I'm currently on the <span class="floydstyle em">first</span> level of the Mall. Aside from the
 operational panel, there is little else here in the lift.

>push up

 I press the up button. After a few seconds, the elevator transports me
 to the second level of the Mall.

>push open

 The doors are now open.

>out


 <span class="floydstyle em">Before the Elevator</span>
 The floor of the Mall comes up against a rail, forming a barrier which
 prevents further (sane) western travel. The bottom (ground floor)
 level can be viewed with ease, though, as the guardrail mainly
 prevents kids -- future productive Mall denizens! -- from ragdolling
 their way off the edge.

 There is a badly-cracked kiosk in the center of the hallway. At the
 far end of the rail is an elevator.
 There is a crystal ball holder here.

>inventory

 I am carrying my glasses (being worn), the gaming glove (being worn),
 the phone, Gibs's lacrosse stick, the aged text, an urn, the blue
 balloon, and the garlic clove.  Inside the urn is some water.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">East Side Corridor</span>

 gets to the elevator, which leads down to the ground floor. To the
 south of this area is the Bead Store, exits otherwise lead west and
 east.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Bead Store</span>
 The Bead Store smells strongly of incense and stale joints, and it
 almost overpowers every other sense. There are shelves on all sides of
 the store, but none in the middle of the store due to the drawn
 pentagram.
 A postcard, the X-box are here.
 The skeleton is here.

 I'm at the eastern side of the Mall. To the north is Choad's Sporting

 There's not a path in that direction.

 There are exits north to the Jewelry Store, in towards the Elevator
 and east towards the east side of the Mall.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Jewelry Store</span>
 The Jewelry Store is of average dimensions for the Mall, with
 significantly less maneuvering room due to the long tabletop display
 that snakes about the room. They sell all manner of jewelry (ear
 rings, bracelets, watches) but as they close much earlier than
 everybody else, it's all under lock and key.

 On the east side of the store, against the wall, is a large safebox.

 There is a table here, set adjacent to the Sporting Goods store.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Eastern End of the Mall</span>
 This is far east as the Mall goes. The Mall technically dips a bit as
 one goes west, as it was originally constructed upon a landfill.
 There's a three-sided advertising kiosk in the middle of the corridor.

 To the west is the Beads Store, Sporting Good Outlet and the (closed)
 Arcade.

 My store, the Gaming and Role-Playing Emporium, is to the south.

 "I don't mean to be annoying," says Gibs, "Not now, anyway, but
 Casey's got maybe four minutes left before she can no longer be
 saved."

>go west

 west.

 There is a table here, set adjacent to the Sporting Goods store.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Choad's Sporting Goods</span>
 Choad's Sporting Goods exists under the unfortunate circumstance that
 the owner's name translates into Bengali as 'fuck.' Once or twice a
 year there will be a demonstration or protest from a bunch of local
 student Hindus, but nothing ever changes.

 The store is one of the larger ones in the Mall, about 40' wide and
 140' long. Ski jackets take up almost all the area towards the front
 of the store, as far as I can see, with the entire western wall filled
 with displays of discount tennis sneakers.

 There doesn't seem to be any rifles or shotguns for sale. (It appears
 as if Gibs's intuition was incorrect.)
 There is a circular jacket rack here.
 The ghoul is here.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Sunglasses Hut</span>
 I'm not quite sure why sunglasses and shades are only sold in 'huts'
 but this store is very un-hut like. There are three very solid walls
 here and a roof made not of thatch, but poured, cracking cement. The
 floor is hardly comprised of peat or mud, but the same tile present
 everywhere else in the Mall.

 A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with
 the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still
 function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the
 room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters
 of the Sunglasses Hut.

 I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my
 manager at the D&D store. I acquired a little bit of trivia regarding
 this place (for instance, the center display case will open if it's
 tapped upon) but nothing useful otherwise.

 This store is mostly unfurnished, with a low, bare ceiling, cold floor
 covered in cheap carpeting, and blankets and rugs thumb-tacked up to
 hide the peeling wallpaper and crumbling drywall.

 The contents of the room are a cluttered mess, as this place seems to
 be more of a craftsman's think-tank and construction area than pure
 chamber for commerce like so many other shops in the Mall. There's a
 workdesk and mirror along the northern wall and a file cabinet across
 from it. A small window is visible behind some junk, and directly
 across from the entrance are seven masks attached to the back wall in
 a proud display. Attached to one of the naked support beams is a disco
 laser pointer.

 A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with
 the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still
 function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the
 room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters
 of the Sunglasses Hut.

 I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my
 manager at the D&D store. I acquired a little bit of trivia regarding
 this place (for instance, the center display case will open if it's
 tapped upon) but nothing useful otherwise.

 legs.

>examine spectre

 The spectre is a powerful, intangible, undead spirit consumed with
 hatred for those with warmth in their souls. Its touch drains an
 enormous amount of life energy, it is unaffected by silver, 'normal'
 iron, or cold.

 It would be powerless in daylight, but I am obviously several hours
 away from any such thing. It may be best to just avoid and and not
 antagonize it.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green and contrast with the subdued nature of the shelves and all the
 jars of pills placed upon them.

 In the rear of the store is a modest wood counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Even further, behind the counter and register,
 is a metal door.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.
 The Magic: The Gathering cards are here.

 The menorah has places for nine candles -- one for each day of

 light the other candles once per day for each day of the holiday. This
 menorah is made out of brass and does not appear to have had any
 attention or cleaning in quite some time.
 Inside the menorah are the crimson candle, the cyan candle, the jade
 candle, the umber candle, the indigo candle, the canary candle, the
 black candle, the slate candle, and the white candle.

>clean menorah

 The menorah gets a little brighter.

>examine coffin

 The coffin is made out of some kind of stone-like substance that I am
 not altogether familiar with. It's like a chiseled and well-grooved
 offshoot of pyrite. It nevertheless reflects light quite well, and
 practically shimmers down here in the basement, excepting those bits
 of it flecked with dried blood.


>examine lid

 The coffin lid is about six and a half feet long, three feet wide and
 a good eight or nine inches deep. It's made out of rough stone, but of
 a type filled with flecks of highly reflective metal. The stonework is
 strictly functional, as there are several gashes and lines in the lid
 and it hardly even approximates a smooth surface anywhere that I can
 see.

>examine blood

 Which blood do you mean, the dried blood or the bag of blood?

>bag of blood?

 This is a very large bag of, presumably, fresh human blood. The
 packaging indicates that it is of type O negative. There's like five
 liters of it here, it's quite a solid little package.

 impossibly takes hold of the bag with intangible fingers. "Perfect,"

 A pleather purse, some socks, the torch (broken), the ointment jar, a
 garbage can, a brown table, a plastic chair, a metal chair, a short
 gray table, a broken chair, some chair parts, the cross are here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 The Food Court is a vast, open area, and I can only make out about
 half of it from here. (The entire west end is shrouded in darkness.)

 To the northeast is a Nutrition Store. The Court has another section
 to the west, and there is an exit east from where we originally came.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 There doesn't seem to be anything for the Poltergeist to throw at
 me... it's probably possible for me to get by it and get into the
 other section of the Food Court now.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle em">Nutrition & Herb Store</span>
 The Nutrition Store is dominated by a series of five-foot high shelves
 that make up four distinct aisles. The walls are a sickly shade of
 green and contrast with the subdued nature of the shelves and all the
 jars of pills placed upon them.

 In the rear of the store is a modest wood counter and an ancient
 analog cash register. Even further, behind the counter and register,
 is a metal door.

 There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in
 the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane
 of glass has been placed into the southern wall.
 The Magic: The Gathering cards are here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle em">Basement to the Nutrition Store</span>
 The temperature of the air down here in the basement is quite cold,
 probably no more than thirty degrees Fahrenheit. The ceiling is just
 over five feet high, and the walls have a very rough texture to them,
 as if they were blasted away and then poorly sanded.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">First Basement Corridor</span>
 This stretch of corridor is little more than a narrow, forgotten
 passageway. Soft earth makes up the floor, a distinct change from the
 cement seen to the south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Coffin Room</span>
 The ceiling in this room is unique within the basement, as it is
 actually enough up where I don't have to hunch. All available light is
 strongly reflected from the coffin, which sits quietly in the corner
 of the room. The walls are made out of a flecked brick, and a support
 beam stands to the right of the coffin.

 Exits are south towards the stairs and east into a tight alcove.
 The lid is here.
 The mummy is here.

>enter coffin

 I can't get on the coffin.

>go coffin

 I can't get on the coffin.

>get lid

 I'm carrying too much to take that.

>examine mummy

 It's covered in strips of treated linen, except for the face, which is
 exposed completely. The skin on its face is stretched tightly over the
 angular and hardened skull, which at one time, millennia ago, may have
 been handsome.

 It is dressed in dry, crisp rags that crackle with every movement. The
 rags look dusty, pained... without a hint of humidity and with no
 possibility of moisture.

 Modern myth indicates that mummies are riddled with diseases that
 cause a quick and painful rotting in their hosts.

 It  is dead.

>search mummy

 The mummy is empty.

>search coffin

 I don't find anything.

>push coffin

 I could never muster enough strength to push the lid off, much less
 the push the coffin itself around.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Food Court</span>
 This far section of the Food Court pinches off to a slight, concrete
 wall extension. There were plans to expand this once, by the
 corporation that owns the Mall, but they now seem forever ago and far
 away. The rest of the Food Court is to the east, and the final
 corridor leading out of the Mall completely is around a turn to the
 northwest.
 A Revenant is here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

 I can't go that way.  I can go northwest to Mall, First Level, North
 Edge or east to the food court's east half.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle em">Mall, First Level, North Edge</span>
 We are before the last long hall. To the north, approximately fifty
 yards away, are the exit doors. There are no stores to either side of
 us. An informational kiosk and some planted trees are the only things
 in between us and the exit. Well, that and the levitating, possessed
 body of one of my friends, natch.
 The ghast's head is here.
 Sydney and Casey are here.

 Audrey and Gibs follow me.

>examine casey

 She has brown eyes and jet-black, though obviously dyed, hair. She is
 wearing a textbook goth outfit, complete with the black fingernails,
 eyeliner and steel-toed boots. She looks dark, mysterious, dangerous
 and completely off her rocker.

>go north

 I kicked open the first set of exit doors, entered the airlock and
 pushed open the second set. I held it as all my friends made it out.
 The sky was completely free from clouds and had the slightest hint of
 azure swirling within its fair blue mix. The sun hadn't yet crept up
 over the plains and scrub to the east, but it was only going to be
 moments before we started to see the first few beams.
>give shades to casey
 moments before we started to see the first few beams.Audrey
 desperately looked for some cover from the sun for her friend. She
 spotted the group of the anonymously parked lorries sitting in the lot
 and ran towards one. I took Casey's hand and brought her to them. The
 van would give us a few extra seconds relief from the daylight that
 would kill her.

 I brushed Casey's hair away from her face. I couldn't help a
 tangential glance at the bite marks on her neck. They were terrible,
 fascinating... beautiful. Members of my generation have had hundreds
 of thousands of tattoos and this was more striking than any of them.

 "I'm not going to give up on you, Casey," I whispered to her. She
 offered no response. Trott, Gibs and Sydney joined us. I tossed my
 keys to Trott and told him to bring my car around. Casey hadn't made a
 sound since we had left the Mall. "I'll get some blankets for you," I
 told her. "We'll cover you up, get you to a hospital, get you a
 transfusion..." Audrey let out a little sound of a cry. I saw that her
 cheeks were streaked with tears. She had been so silent I hadn't
 noticed.

 I jumped flat-out of my skin when Casey grabbed my arm. She opened her
 eyes. They were blank, as if her eyes had rolled to the back of her
 head. But she was still able to lock onto me and stare right through
 me.

 "I don't want to live like this," she said. Her voice was so soft, but
 her grip -- her nails were digging through the sleeves of my jacket,
 almost breaking the skin on my wrist.

 "I won't live like this," she said. "You already all look so tempting.
 You, Jarret... I can't stop thinking of what it would be like to just
 take the littlest sip from you..." She released her grip on her own.
 She was still in control of herself, albeit barely. "And you," she
 said, a wry smile forming on her lips as she looked up at Gibs, "You
 would have been <span class="floydstyle em">delicious...</span>"

 "That's not the vampirism talking," whispered Gibs.

 Casey turned slightly and faced me again. "The sun. I feel can feel it
 already. I won't be able to make this decision tomorrow night.
 Tomorrow will be too late." She rose until she stood, giving no pause
 to worry about leverage or looking slightly awkward as she took to her
 feet. She hugged me. She hugged us all, one by one, until only Audrey
 was left. Casey gave her a kiss on her cheek and Audrey finally broke
 down. They embraced. And as terrible as I felt for Casey, it was
 killing me that my girl was having to go through the mechanics of
 saying goodbye forever to her best friend.

 "There is no other group that I would like to spend my final moments
 with," said Casey. "I will miss you all."

 I took Casey's hand and pulled her up as we climbed on top of the
 truck. I tried to tell her that I could find a way to heal her, to fix
 her -- that there was still time. But she was staring straight ahead.
 The sky continued to turn brighter. We were up there for less than a
 minute, but it felt like I had tried to argue with her and talk her
 down for ages

 At exactly 7:21am she briefly turned to me with a sad smile and
 stretched her arms out as wide as they would go. I grabbed hold of her
 in an attempt to drag her down, but daylight peeked out over the
 horizon and instantly vaporized her. She disintegrated away into a
 whiff of dust and only the smallest bit of her was left in my hand.
 Her clothes fell to the top of the van. I heard Audrey shriek from
 below. I picked up Casey's clothes and hopped down to the ground.

 I opened the passenger door to my car and directed Audrey in. The rest
 of us dispersed and went our separate ways. I drove up to the Fort,
 expecting to drop Audrey off and go home. She brought me inside and
 together we both crawled into her bed. She fell asleep quickly, and
 within moments I was hypnotized by her rise and fall. We both slept
 for most of the rest of the day.

 After about twelve hours I fell back into consciousness. I kissed my
 girl on the lips, but she only stirred, smiled faintly, and fell back
 into sleep without ever opening her eyes. In the modern mythology I
 <span class="floydstyle em">don't</span> follow, a kiss on that is supposed to wake up the girl
 when it's delivered by her own Prince Charming.

 It just made it all the more obvious that I've never been that guy for
 her.

 I slipped out of her room and drove myself home.




 <span class="floydstyle em">Four months later...</span>
>hit enter
 I thought the five of us would have difficulties explaining what
 happened in the Mall right after the incident. I thought there would
 be questions, interrogations, solicitors and then time in locked rooms
 downtown before good cops gone bad, and then thrown off our case, but
 at the last second rehired because they always got results.

 But there was none of that. Not so much as a single arched eyebrow.
 Electricity had been restored when I sheepishly returned a few days
 later for my next shift. The bodies were removed, either when the
 ghost vanished or by carry-out after the fact. I never found out
 because I was too much of a coward to ever research what officially
 happened to them.

 It was easy to not get into a nervous furor about things with my
 friends because I hardly saw any of them afterwards. Gibs treated
 missing his shift that night as a power ploy and ended up getting
 promoted and the afternoon drive-time slot. Sydney I only ever saw
 through Audrey, and Audrey moved to Texas at me a week after what went
 down in the Mall. I mean, <span class="floydstyle em">right</span> at me. (If it could be said
 that someone could aggressively move 'at' somebody, I mean. If that's
 possible, then that's definitely what Audrey did.) Trott was the only
 one of the group that I ever encountered with any regularity, and that
 was because we worked together. We never spoke about that night.

 But after four days of living with the spectre of the night
 figuratively breathing a chilling ulcer into my bones I decided that
 it was time that we did.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Benji's Old Time Curiosity Shoppe</span>
 The Curiosity Shoppe is rather smallish, as far as stores around here
 go, nestled into the far corners of the Mall, distant from practically
 every other decent or worthwhile store. Shelves of gaming books and
 modules are arranged everywhere, and promotional kiosks occupy the
 floorspace between the register and the far wall.

 In the last few months, Benji has decided to sell all sorts of other
 worthless crap to increase the profit margin of the store. This
 includes, but is not limited to, baseball cards, DDR mats, stuffed
 Japanese Gromit Dolls, stripper poles, headphones and joy buzzers.

 Trott and I are working here this evening, and it's been a rather slow
 night.
 Trott is here.

>talk to trott

 Please select one:

 (1) "Hey, Trott... You know That Night we never talk about?"

>1


 "Uhm, yeah..." Trott shifts uncomfortably.

 "I think it's high time we talked about it." I look him dead in the
 eye, but Trott doesn't respond. "C'mon! What the fuck went on that
 night?" I start to get really agitated and animated. This is how you
 need to be to get through to Trott sometimes. "All that undead? What
 <span class="floydstyle em">was</span> all that? How on earth have you rationalized that in your
 mind?"

 Trott looks around for a cigarette. He finally finds one and takes a
 long drag on it.

 "Truth to tell, Jarret... heh. I deal with it every day by remembering
 to completely forget about it. I put it all out of my head. Let me
 tell you a story." Trott offers me a cigarette. I accept.

 Trott exhales a long stream of smoke. "When I was in college, a few of
 my friends and I were playing with a ouija board. I had never done it
 before. And neither had my friend Raida. We were both put together on
 the board, on opposite sides, naturally. As first-timers, this was
 going to be of interest to the old pros."

 "Naturally," I say.

 "Well, the 'spirits' were asked a bunch of questions. We saw the
 planchette moved intelligently to the different letters. I know for a
 fact that I didn't move it. I am pretty sure that she didn't as well.
 What we saw and what we were told through the board spooked the hell
 out of us. The spirits knew our names and threatened us and told us
 that they were going to suck down our souls and so forth. There was
 only one thing that bugged me, though."

 Trott frowns. "Well, actually, the entire thing shocked the living
 Christ right out of me. But anyway. At one point <span class="floydstyle em">Herr</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">geistenhaus</span> was asked which one of us they were going to get
 first, me or Raida. The ghost said that it was going to be me, and
 spelled my name out T-R-O-T-T. Three instances of the letter 'T.'
 Immediately after, a similar question was asked, and Raida's name came
 up. Her name was spelled -- by the spirits! -- with the letter 'I' and
 not 'Y.' So not only are those beasties in contact with us on the
 physical plane, but they also instinctively knew how to spell our
 names with all our crazy variants. Oh, and it referred to me by my
 last name rather than my first. Of course."

 "What the hell is your first name, anyway?" I ask.

 "Sveinsgeird?ttir," says Trott. I wouldn't have guessed that. I would
 have gone with 'John' if pressed. "It's Norse," says Trott, helpfully.

 "Anyway. I borrowed the board a couple nights later. I set it up on my
 bed. Raida and I put it backwards to us, and we closed our eyes. I set
 up a webcam to record what happened on the board." Trott takes a
 thoughtful puff. "And what happened later, away from the board, too,
 as it turns out." He shakes his head to remove a quick smile based on
 old memories. "We got back gibberish from what we asked. You'd think
 the banshees and demons could account for the board being oddly
 placed, but they couldn't, apparently. Ah! Ah! Ah! There is something
 called the ideomotor effect, I later learned. But the point is...
 there's plenty of standard explanations for remarkable things that
 happen that everyday. So Sydney was 'levitating.' Sometimes magnetism
 looks like super powers. It got cold in the Mall. <span class="floydstyle em">Fuck.</span> The
 power was out. And when is it ever not cold in the Mall? July? People
 turned into monsters..."

 "Admittedly, tougher to explain," continues Trott. "Maybe the
 government tried out an ebola strain on people." He lowers his voice.
 "People like Rudolph. Er, Randolph. Whoever." He looks around the
 store to make sure nobody else has wandered in. "It's already legal to
 create a bot and just let it run loose around town. I don't know for
 certain. But I do know that I am not prepared to blindly believe in
 anything. I don't mind playing role playing games and being a dungeon
 master and whatever else, but I certainly won't baaa-baaaa my way
 around life and absorb every pseudo-supernatural event I encounter
 like a peanut-brained little sheep."

 A strangely familiar and altogether repulsive customer shambles into
 the store.

 musty flannel and shambles about with an unwholesome gait. His

 Barnaby Gibbons is 5'11" tall and 175lbs, and right about my age. He
 has hazel eyes and brown hair. He's wearing a backwards baseball cap
 and a Rochester Knighthawks authentic lacrosse jersey. Barnaby makes
 his living as the host of a semi-popular sports radio show that is
 broadcast from two in the morning until six AM weekdays. I've known
 him for about a decade. He was my roommate for my three semesters at
 Syracuse University, and always keeps me rooted back in reality when
 I've been spending too much time with role-playing games. He also has
