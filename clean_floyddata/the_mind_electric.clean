 The Kaden finally realized you were spying and locked your mind essence
 in a digital cell. Normally the Kaden would already be at work
 analyzing your mind to run the loyalty transfer program, but you
 haven't felt anything at all in the last five hours. The delay is
 unnerving, since the mind can survive in virtual space for a limited
 amount of time before it destroys itself. Your companions, the Souden,
 should be close to beginning the assault now, although since they know
 nothing of your predicament survival is still doubtful.

 Containment Grid
 The design of virtual space can be almost anything, but in this case
 the room is merely a small cube surrounded by an electric fence, with
 lines of blue against black crossing the floor and ceiling. A large
 square door is inset into the floor, slightly off the center, sending
 the design of the entire room into asymmetrical confusion.

>examine door
 Rendered light green, and very tightly shut. It resembles the type that
 opens with some sort of password, although going through the entire
 dictionary to open it would take an inordinate amount of time.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

 Out of the corner of your eye you see a piece of paper suddenly appear
 on the ground. Very odd. Any anomalous material in a containment grid
 should immediately set off an alarm, but there is no sound.

>take paper
 Taken.

>read it
 It feels more like a piece of plastic than a piece of paper because of
 its virtual nature. It has the word "ivory" imprinted on it.

>say ivory
 The door begins sliding open, but stops halfway.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine door

 Special thanks go to Richard Barnett, Jim Newland, and Gareth Rees for
 programming help, as well as Michael Kinyon, Bernd Schmidt, and Aileen
 Dyer for playtesting. Also, thanks to Catherine Mori and Earl Dille for
 help with the Latin text.

 Release 2 fixes a small bug with the door and a mistake in the credits.

 Release 3 relaxes some of the time pressures, and adds some more
 description to some of the objects to make the puzzles easier.

 For the curious, works of literature and culture
 indirectly/symbolically used in the game are: Mourning Becomes Electra,
 Billy Budd, Snow Crash, The Neverending Story, Anti-Ice, The Legend
 Lives!, Burning Chrome, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Earth 2, and the old
 arcade game Tempest.

>search paper
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine fence
 Simulated of both metal and electricity, it somewhat resembles a row of
 Jacob's Ladders placed side by side intertwined with strips of bronzed
 metal, but the virtual image flickers so rapidly it is hard to tell.
 Beyond it is nothing but black.

>turn over paper
 You can't see any such thing.

>flip paper
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look behind paper
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>turn paper over
 I only understood you as far as wanting to turn the piece of paper.

>turn paper
 Nothing obvious happens.

>read paper
 It feels more like a piece of plastic than a piece of paper because of
 its virtual nature. It has the word "flood" imprinted on it.

>say flood

 Containment Grid
 The design of virtual space can be almost anything, but in this case
 the room is merely a small cube surrounded by an electric fence, with
 lines of blue against black crossing the floor and ceiling. A large
 square door is inset into the floor, slightly off the center, sending
 the design of the entire room into asymmetrical confusion.

>go down

 Crystal Cave
 Light bounces off glassy walls in every direction for a dazzling
 effect. Crystals protrude from the wall at odd angles. Sparks of
 electricity are passed back and forth. The entire room vibrates and
 hums like a large electric generator. Portals are placed in all the
 main directions.

 You can see a granite rock here.

>examine rock
 A rock far too much in the shape of a cube to be natural, if it was
 real at all.

>take it
 The rock emits a loud warbling noise and vanishes. In its place appears
 a red cube, rotating slowly clockwise, with a humanlike face on each
 side so no matter where you are standing a face can be seen.

 The expressions of the faces change together, like they are connected
 by a giant string; the mouths are moving rapidly, as if speaking, but
 they make no sound.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine cube
 A floating red cube, slowly rotating clockwise. Molded into each side,
 like a child's lump of clay, is a humanlike face, complete with facial
 expressions and moving lips. It looks like it is trying to say
 something, but the words don't come out.

>cube, hi
 The cube moves its lips slightly but it seems unable to talk.

>examine paper
 It feels more like a piece of plastic than a piece of paper because of
 its virtual nature. It is blank.

>touch cube
 Keep your hands to yourself!

>ask cube about cube
 The cube moves its lips slightly but it seems unable to talk.

 Your body seems to be getting less stable.

>kiss cube
 The cube looks very confused.

 main directions.

 You can see a rotating humanfaced cube here.

>go east

 Star Plateau
 A flat plain of black sand sprouts dark obelisks reaching to the sky.
 The sky itself is a mixture of stars, real and unreal--fractal images
 along with glowing dots shine softly together. Two portals, black voids
 in the landscape, are to the north and south.

 You can see a metal loop (on which is a spider) here.

>examine loop
 "Loop" is a somewhat innacurate term, but it is the only word that
 comes to mind when looking at this topological nightmare. Bands of dull
 and bright metal twist and bend around each other to form something
 like a large circular cage. An almost magnetic force compels you
 towards it.

 A voice without direction or origin announces "Scanning program
 initiated for sector 482."

>examine spider
 A spider constructed of chrome and glass, with long legs that are
 multi-jointed. It is carrying a doll.

 "Scan in process for sector 482."

 A loud warbling noise briefly echoes into the room.

 The spider turns to face a different direction.

>examine doll
 A ragged yet cheerful looking doll, with a dark face.

 "Scan in process for sector 482."

>examine doll

 Containment Grid
 The design of virtual space can be almost anything, but in this case
 the room is merely a small cube surrounded by an electric fence, with
 lines of blue against black crossing the floor and ceiling. A large
 square door is inset into the floor, slightly off the center, sending
 the design of the entire room into asymmetrical confusion.

>examine lines
 They glow with electrical intensity. You surmise the only purpose of
 them is to add shape to the mostly black room, keeping those contained
 within the grid from going insane. It still happens occasionally,
 though.

>say ivory
 The door begins sliding open, but stops halfway.

 Out of the corner of your eye you see a piece of paper suddenly appear

 Storage Room
 Many plain boxes with numbers printed on them fill this room. The

 exit to the east and west.

 Simple cardboard boxes, numbered and in order, from 0001-9999. They are

 A spider constructed of chrome and glass, with long legs that are
 multi-jointed. It is carrying a doll.

 A sound like creaking floorboards can be heard from far above.

>examine loop
 "Loop" is a somewhat innacurate term, but it is the only word that
 comes to mind when looking at this topological nightmare. Bands of dull
 and bright metal twist and bend around each other to form something
 like a large circular cage. An almost magnetic force compels you
 towards it.

 Many plain boxes with numbers printed on them fill this room. The
 ceiling, floor, and walls are a simple dull gray. A low pitched whine

 exit to the east and west.

 Crystal Cave
 Light bounces off glassy walls in every direction for a dazzling
 effect. Crystals protrude from the wall at odd angles. Sparks of
 electricity are passed back and forth. The entire room vibrates and
 hums like a large electric generator. Portals are placed in all the
 main directions.

 You can see a rotating humanfaced cube here.

 Star Plateau
 A flat plain of black sand sprouts dark obelisks reaching to the sky.
 The sky itself is a mixture of stars, real and unreal--fractal images

 The cube begins talking in a wavering tone. "System has been activated,

 word the inflection changing slightly: "In nova fert animus mutatas
 dicere formas corpora di coeptis nam vos mutastis et illas adsirate
 meis primaque ab origine mundi ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora
 carmen."

 The humanfaced cube pauses, and begins speaking again, this time in a
 voice that is both masculine and feminine.

 "Ah, that's much better now. My voice calibration that I had stored got
 erased somewhere along the line, but I'm back to normal now. How may I

 Crystal Cave
 Light bounces off glassy walls in every direction for a dazzling
 effect. Crystals protrude from the wall at odd angles. Sparks of
 electricity are passed back and forth. The entire room vibrates and
 hums like a large electric generator. Portals are placed in all the
 main directions.

 You can see a rotating humanfaced cube here.

>cube, lxprog
 The cube gives a blank stare momentarily, and then says, "Some type of
 program has been activated, it will take an unknown amount of time to
 complete."

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>wait

 The cube looks concerned. "The execution of lxprog has been halted.
 Something is stopping the program from running."

 Star Plateau
 A flat plain of black sand sprouts dark obelisks reaching to the sky.
 The sky itself is a mixture of stars, real and unreal--fractal images
 along with glowing dots shine softly together. Two portals, black voids
 in the landscape, are to the north and south.

 You can see a metal loop (on which is a spider) here.

 For half a second you hear a crackling noise.

 The spider shifts to a slightly different position.

>spider, status
 "Status normal, all systems check clean."

 The spider idly plays with the doll it is carrying.

>spider, help

 Containment Grid
 The design of virtual space can be almost anything, but in this case
 the room is merely a small cube surrounded by an electric fence, with
 lines of blue against black crossing the floor and ceiling. A large
 square door is inset into the floor, slightly off the center, sending
 the design of the entire room into asymmetrical confusion.

 A disembodied voice announces, "Location program complete, intruder has
 been located, sentac pulse now active."

 Crystal Cave
 Light bounces off glassy walls in every direction for a dazzling
 effect. Crystals protrude from the wall at odd angles. Sparks of
 electricity are passed back and forth. The entire room vibrates and
 hums like a large electric generator. Portals are placed in all the
 main directions.

 You can see a rotating humanfaced cube here.

 Many plain boxes with numbers printed on them fill this room. The

 Star Plateau
 A flat plain of black sand sprouts dark obelisks reaching to the sky.
 The sky itself is a mixture of stars, real and unreal--fractal images
 along with glowing dots shine softly together. Two portals, black voids

 Crystal Cave
 Light bounces off glassy walls in every direction for a dazzling
 effect. Crystals protrude from the wall at odd angles. Sparks of
 electricity are passed back and forth. The entire room vibrates and
 hums like a large electric generator. Portals are placed in all the
 main directions.

 You can see a rotating humanfaced cube here.

 Containment Grid
 The design of virtual space can be almost anything, but in this case
 the room is merely a small cube surrounded by an electric fence, with
 lines of blue against black crossing the floor and ceiling. A large
 square door is inset into the floor, slightly off the center, sending
 the design of the entire room into asymmetrical confusion.

>put paper on fence
 The paper is sucked into the fence structure and disappears.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>examine fence
 Simulated of both metal and electricity, it somewhat resembles a row of
 Jacob's Ladders placed side by side intertwined with strips of bronzed
 metal, but the virtual image flickers so rapidly it is hard to tell.
 Beyond it is nothing but black.

 Apex of Obelisk
 A flat plain of black sand lies below you, and starry fractal sky
 above. The sky looks so realistic and close you feel you could almost
 reach out and touch it. Patches of black threaten you from every
 direction.

 A loud warbling noise briefly echoes into the room.

>touch sky
 You raise your hand, and, as in a childhood fantasy, touch the sky. As
 you do so, you are sucked into it...

 Factory
 High above you on various platforms, machines clatter and clang,
 shifting connected parts in constant motion, like the inner workings of
 a giant mechanical beast. The walls and floor are textured with ridged
 metal; the ceiling is a dull gray. There is no exit.

 You can see a duplicator, a green pad, a blue pad and a storage bin (in

 Going through the sky seems to have put a strain on your body.

>examine me
 Your "body" is a crude model, textured with some type of rock, almost
 as if you were a golem. Your virtual body has degenerated slightly.

 A gauge attached to a spinning crank briefly makes a loud warbling
 noise.

>examine widget
 A generic program without modelling is called a "widget". This one is
 incomplete, which is why it looks like a plain rectangular box.

>examine duplicator
 It is used to make it easy to duplicate objects in the virtual
 environment. An object is placed on the green pad, the duplicator is
 touched, and a duplicate of the object on the green pad appears on the
 blue pad.

 You hear explosions coming from a disconnected universe.

 since I had to speed up the program a little."

 You have the extreme urge to say something, but your mouth is unable to
 move. Your entire body is exhausted.

 "I know what you want to ask. You want to know why I saved you. I
 thought perhaps I could get someone to understand the true nature of
 the war, and after such a situation you may understand without me even
 telling you."

 The man studies you in silence for a few moments, and then says, "You
 see, the war between the Kaden and Souden is not a real war, for a just
 cause, or even a lost cause, but a cycle. The impact of the loyalty
 transfer programs has been that the war is merely a transfer of people
 from one loyalty to the other, repeatedly, so much that their identity
 is lost. The war is a collection of toy soldiers marching back and
 forth across a line, and slowly dying out. You are all fighting
 yourselves, each other, all on the same side."

 "But you may still not understand until you know who created the cube,
 which died in saving you at the base."
