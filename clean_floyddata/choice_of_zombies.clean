 Outside the sky is mercilessly bright, and the hot air full of all the
 varied sounds of an army ready to march; but inside this small shrine
 are coolness,darkness and solitude.  And peace, which is a rare and
 precious thing to find in these years since the Usurper placed himself
 upon Tsoly\xe1nu's Petal Throne, igniting a civil war.

 Before you stands a statue of your god, presiding over an alter on
 which other legionaries have placed offerings.  There are ten gods in
 Tsoly\xe1nu: five who champion the cause of unchanging Stability, and five
 who wish to bring about endless Change.  All are permitted their
 temples and honored on their holy days, but you and your family, like
 most Tsoly\xe1ni, have a particular patron deity.  Who's face do you look
 into?

 A: Lord Hn\xe1lla, the Illumination of All the World and supreme principal
 of Stability
 B: Lord Karak\xe1n, Lord of Glorious War and high general of Stability
 C: Lady Av\xe1nthe, Mistress of Heaven and the goddess of women and nature
 D: Lord Hr\xfa'\xfc, the Dispenser of Calamities and supreme principal of
 Change
 E: Lord Vimh\xfala, the Power of Destruction and Red Ruin, Lord of Flame
 F: Lady Dlam\xe9lish, the Green Eyed Lady of Fleshly Joys and Mistress of
 Demons

 worshiped Lord Hn\xe1lla since the ancient days of the Empire of the
 Gods-- the most noble of gods for the most noble of families.  Lord
 Hn\xe1lla  calls upon his worshipers to fulfill their place in society
 with dignity and to strive industriously against change and decay, both
 in a spiritual sense and in the physical world.  Kneeling before a
 statue of his twelfth aspect: Baj\xe1n Ke'\xfan, "Guardian of the Imperium
 and Patron of the Armies," you scatter a handful of fresh white
 blossoms and flawless quartz crystals upon the altar. And what brings
 you to Hn\xe1lla's Temple?

 A: I hope to lead my men well in the coming siege.
 B: I want to find glory and promotion
 C: I wish to return safely to my home and family when this is over

>c
 offerings to come if you make it home alive.

 Though few soldiers would admit it, many of them share this secret
 prayer.

 As you finish praying the silence of the temple is disturbed by the
 faint scuffing of sandals upon stone.  You turn in time to see a woman,
 wearing the badge of an assassin's clan, raise a blowgun to her lips.
 As you duck, a poisoned dart whistles by your ear to thunk into the
 altar.  You are alone in the small shrine and unarmored, though your
 _chl\xe9n_ hide sword leans against the altar.  (Metal is too rare on
 Tekumel to be of common use, and so soldiers fight with weapons cut
 from a tough hide which has been chemically treated to resemble soft
 bronze.)

 A: I grab my _chl\xe9n_ hide sword and lunge for the woman in expert form.
 B: I cast the spell 'Hands of Kra the Mighty', and crush her, as one
 does a fly.
 C: I focus my psychic energies and time slows around me.  Picking up my
 chl\xe9n hide sword I advance.
 D: I whistle for two of my soldiers who are stationed outside.

>c
 which were honed in Temple School.  You harness these now and move
 toward the assassin like a bolt of Lord Karak\xe1n's lightning.

 Though momentarily off balance, the assassin displays the speed and
 trickery for which her kind are known, and a poisoned blade is soon at
 your throat.

 A: I fight defensively and whistle for two of my soldiers who are
 stationed outside.
 B: You must be mistaken.  She may be talented, but I am one of the
 finest psychic warriors in the empire.

>a
 formidable, and you are no exception.  By focusing purely on defense
 you negate any difference in skill, and the assassin is soon flanked by
 your soldiers.  Realizing, too late, her position, she looks around for
 a route of escape.

 A: As she turns to parry one of my soldiers I finish her with a single
 sword stroke.  Her death is a fair price for an attempt upon my life,
 but I make it quick.
 B: I motion for my soldiers to grab her.   I'm curious to know whether
 it's true that Assassins cannot be tortured into betraying their
 clients.
 C: I lunge, stopping my sword inches from her throat.  "Do you yield?"

>b

 The assassin's face remains blank as she is grabbed, a picture of
 perfect stillness.  It is clear she intends to die with dignity, and
 silence.

 A: So it's true then?  Well I know who her employer is anyway.  I give
 her a merciful end.
 B: It's a shame intentions don't always equal success.

>b
 Lord Ks\xe1rul, for deliverance, she does not speak.

 In the end she manages to end her life with a quick slap to her neck,
 resembling the swatting of a mosquito, which leaves behind a poisoned
 dart. The soldier who had let her arm free in his blanching distraction
 is stabbed as well, with snake-like swiftness.  He collapses to the
 stones, foaming at the mouth.

 She passes from this life having not betrayed her clan or her employer.

 So, why would someone send an assassin after you anyway?

 A: I killed a rival for the sake of my beloved.
 B: The weak envy the strong.? I don't have time to enumerate every
 grievance brought against me by lesser men.
 C: I prevented an injustice
 D: I killed a man in anger, and deeply regret it.

>c
 ignoble action, it is a truism that all men are corruptible.  Having
 failed to gain his revenge in the courts, your powerful enemy uses his
 fortune to send greedy assassins after you on the flimsiest of
 pretexts.  Thus far you have been lucky in surviving such attempts.

 The next day sees your legion marching down one of the large fortified
 s\xe1kbe roads which serve in peacetime as rivers of trade between the
 cities of the empire, and in war as defensible walls guarding its
 provinces.  Behind you is the stone guard tower at which you took your
 noon meal, while ahead of you the road snakes away toward the horizon.
 The top tier of the s\xe1kbe is unoccupied, except for occasional runners
 sprinting by on Imperial business.

 Most of the ranking officers ride in palanquins carried by slaves upon
 the middle tier, but the soldiers and the baggage train move slowly
 along the broad road of well-worn stone at the base of the wall.  As a
 _k\xe1si_ of the legion of the Blue Peak and a commander of a _tsur\xfam_ of
 400 soldiers you may choose to travel in style if you wish.

 A: I am riding in my palanquin.
 B: I am marching with my soldiers.

>a
 it?

 A: I need to catch up on paperwork.
 B: After the week I have had, and with a battle to come, I could use
 the relaxation.
 C: I enjoy trading jokes and news with my fellow commanders.
 D: In truth I would rather be marching, but I have to keep up
 appearances.

>go down
 chummy with one's soldiers is often seen as a weakness in a _k\xe1si_, and
 serves as a block to future promotion.  It is safer to blend in with
 the crowd, and let appropriate behavior be your guide.

 To take your mind off the tedium of riding in a palanquin across the
 breadbasket of the Empire, you  begin replay the recent attempt upon
 your life in your mind.

 From there, it is a small step to thinking about the events around the
 time of your naming day celebration, and the unfortunate incident that
 resulted in the assassination attempt. . .

 Your childhood in the great clan-house of Golden Sunburst was pleasant.
 Your household possessed plenty of slaves to do menial toil and an
 abundance of wealth.  Your numerous clan mothers and fathers (your
 parents' siblings and their spouses) lavished affection upon you.
 During the day you were taught reading, writing, maths, psychics and
 history at the temple school of Hn\xe1lla; and in the evenings you slept
 in barracks-like dormitories with your "clan cousins"(other children of
 the clan, most of them unrelated to you by any close blood tie).

 Many of the older adolescents, on the verge of adulthood, snuck between
 the boys and girls dormitories to warm each other's beds, and in the
 past year you had begun to join in this pastime.  The night before your
 _khatunj\xe1lim_, or naming ceremony, found you sneaking into your
 "cousin" Wave's bed.  Where were you coming from and where were you
 heading to?

 A: I slept in the boys' dormitory and was visiting Wave in the girls'
 dormitory
 B: Both Wave and I slept in the boys' dormitory.
 C: I slept in the girls' dormitory and was visiting Wave in the boys'
 dormitory
 D: Both Wave and I slept in the girls' dormitory.

>go down
 dormitory and walk through the damp hall on the chilly spring night.
 You simply dragged your sleeping mat over next to Wave, who was still
 awake, waiting for you.  "Tiuni, I was worried you were mad at me and
 were not coming tonight," she whispered.  You thought how strange it
 would be that after tomorrow no one would ever call you Tiuni again.
 There was pride in the idea that you would finally have an adult's name
 and an adult's responsibilities.

 Earlier that day you had found Wave gambling with some of the other
 girls in one of the courtyards.  You knew that her mother would not
 have approved of gambling, and worst of all, she had placed the small
 ceramic amulet of _Ss\xe1ni_ "The Lover," patroness of love between women,
 that you had given her in the pot!  After the dice had been thrown and
 she had won, Wave had claimed she had only bet it because she had known
 it would bring her luck; but as Wave slipped the amulet back around her
 neck, and gathered up her winnings, you had stormed off with tears in
 your eyes.  Though Wave was beautiful and clever, she could also be
 spoiled, sure that her winning personality could get her out of any
 situation.

 Now she was looking up at you with a vulnerable worry, different from
 the brash assurance of earlier in the day.

 A: "I could not stay angry with you."
 B: "You hurt my feelings, _ts\xe1mmeri_, when you do not value my gifts."
 C: "If you ever do something like that again, we're through!"

>b
 hair comb, and I couldn't lose it, and I knew the Goddess would not let
 me be parted from your amulet, that it would ensure my winning. . ."
 The two of you talked for a _kir\xe9n_ or more, starting with
 remonstrances, but ending in joint apologies followed by pledges of
 love, and eventually more physical affirmations of your mutual
 affection; until, physically and emotionally exhausted, you passed into
 sleep.

 The next thing you knew, cold water was startling you out of sleep.
 Sputtering you looked up to see your elder brother, Gay\xe1n, smiling down
 at you.

 "Sleep well, little sister? Or did you not sleep at all?"  Here he
 leered at Wave, and waggled his eyebrows.  Gay\xe1n fancied himself a
 comedian.  "Well, I have come to break you two apart. Mother Hal\xe9 is in
 a state of distraction over the fit of your formal dress, and has told
 me that if I do not bring you back immediately she will feed me to a
 dragon.  Oh!" here he looked again at Wave, "and your parents wish your
 company as well."

 Without waiting for a response, Gay\xe1n grabbed you up by the arm and
 dragged you from the barracks.

 You were barely through the door before Mama Hal\xe9 was fastening a
 jeweled _chl\xe9n_-hide collar over your shoulders, and arranging a kilt
 around your waste.  As she eyed and adjusted its drape she barraged you
 with unsolicited advice about the upcoming ceremony.

 "Ti\xfani, you must keep your posture during the parade, and during the
 feast.  The headdress will be heavy, but you must look regal. And
 afterwards do not drink too heavily or overindulge in the powders.
 There will be ten of you getting your names today, and half of Jak\xe1lla
 has turned out to see, and you must be the most shining youth present.
 . ." on and on she chattered.

 Mama Hal\xe9 was your birth-mother's sister and had raised you since you
 were an infant. Your other mother, Dz\xe1i, had declared herself _arid\xe1ni_
 at her own naming ceremony, and so taken on rights and responsibilities
 normally reserved for men.  She had joined a legion and marched to war
 while her sister elected to remain a "good clan girl" and accept the
 more traditional role for women.  Hal\xe9 was not considered legally a
 person in her own right, could not own property, and could not be sued
 or challenged to a duel; but she was still a formidable personality,
 actively involved in the work and social life of Clan Golden Sunburst.

 And now all of her will was bent on getting you through the day without
 a misstep that might provide fodder for gossips and lower your family's
 prestige within the clan-house.   How did you feel about the
 celebration?

 A: I was excited to be an adult, but just wanted to survive the day
 without disgracing myself.
 B: I am always up for a good party and meant to enjoy myself.
 C: This was my chance to impress my clan elders and the rest of the
 city's notables.

>c
 though the elders saw the _khatunj\xe1lim_ as a chance to boost the
 prestige of the clan-house, it would be you and your compatriots all
 the populace of Jak\xe1lla would be staring at.  Mama Hal\xe9 was alternately
 enthused and frustrated that you had an interest in the proceedings,
 depending on whether your views matched with hers on a given issue.

 In the end you were impeccably turned out as you joined the other nine
 soon-to-be adults for the procession through the city. The city of
 Jak\xe1lla lies on the delta of the Eq\xfanoyel river, facing out over tidal
 flats and the Bay of Jak\xe1lla.  Jak\xe1llans consider Dlam\xe9lish to be their
 city patron, and their town to be the most cultured in Tsoly\xe1nu.  Thus,
 as Golden Sunburst's parade wound through the city's streets it
 attracted an entourage of curiosity seekers, revelers, and
 entertainers.

 By the time you returned to your clan-house, the parade had swelled to
 become a mob.  Your clan elders had anticipated this and, while only
 the most exalted of noble families would celebrate and dine with you
 inside, a vast feast with associated entertainments was set up in the
 courtyard.  Monstrous _tsi'\xedl_ beasts roasted over fire pits, their
 juices crackling as they hit the flames and filling the air with savory
 smells. Bread was handed out, and wine flowed freely.  It is by such
 largess that the lower clans are kept peaceable, and in awe of mighty
 Golden Sunburst.

 The noble guests filed through a vast room with frescoes upon the
 plastered walls and an intricate mosaic upon the floor, up a grand
 marble staircase, and onto a terraced rooftop garden.  Here the spring
 breezes could flow freely, but the walls and roofs of the surrounding
 buildings blocked prying eyes.  The guests arranged themselves on a
 series of raised daises under peaked pavilions according to rank while
 the ten of you stood beneath a bower.  There you waited, still and
 proud, on display, as what seemed like every notable in Jak\xe1lla filed
 in.

 When all were seated, a hush descended.  An older man, dressed in
 finery of the 19th formal circle, stood, bowed to priests waiting
 beside the bower, and began to speak.  He orated upon the ancient roots
 of Clan Sea Blue in the days of the Engsvany\xe1li Imperium; on the
 histories of the lineages of each young man or woman standing before
 him; on the virtues of duty to the clan, of honor and dignity.
 Finally, when you felt your knees must buckle from supporting the
 massive weight of your jeweled and feather headdress, he approached the
 first youth.  In turn each new name was read from a scroll, and a
 sacrifice was passed from a waiting slave to the man or woman, and from
 them to a priest of their faith.  When the elder came to stand before
 you, what name did he read out?

 A: Chents\xfani
 B: Mik\xfasa
 C: Lin\xe1tla
 D: Osur\xe9
 E: Tlay\xe9sha
 F: Vish\xe1ya
 G: None of these

>c

 A: A flawless clear diamond that my mother Dz\xe1i captured while away at
 war
 B: A delicate white orchid from the Ch\xe1kan jungles
 C: A white th\xe9sun gauze priest's robe

>b
 and exalted clan of Sea Blue is proud to welcome its newest member,
 Lin\xe1tla hiMar\xf3dla. _Otul\xe9ngba!_" At his joyous shout, the crowd
 replied in a chorus: "_Otul\xe9ngba!_, All Hail!" Having been cued before
 the ceremony by Dz\xe1i, the clan-elder now waited for you to claim your
 _arid\xe1ni_ status.  Since you were little your birth-mother had made it
 clear that she expected you to be the equal of all men before the law
 and follow her into the army.  How did you feel about this?

 A: I would have preferred to remain a simple woman of my clan, and live
 a life surrounded by my aunts and sisters.
 B: I was eager to assume the role of _arid\xe1ni_ and soldier, and to make
 my mark upon the world.
 C: I was glad to become _arid\xe1ni_ and escape the stifling life of the
 good clan girl, but was not so sure about the soldier part.

>b
 be recorded that before all the honored and respectable people gathered
 here, I declare myself an _arid\xe1ni_ woman."  The announcement was
 greeted with polite applause from the crowd and a look of pride on the
 faces of your mothers.

 The ritual of naming was repeated for the next clan cousins, and then
 the elder stood before Wave, who presented the priest of Hn\xe1lla with a
 necklace of milky white moonstones. The elder then read from the scroll
 "The ancient and exalted clan of Sea Blue is proud to welcome its
 newest member, S\xe1yi hiT\xe1nkolel. _Otul\xe9ngba!_," and once more the crowd
 shouted approval.

 Soon the ceremony ended, and attention drifted away from the newly
 named adults and onto more important things like fashion, gossip, trade
 deals, and news of the war with the country of Yan Kor.  Mama Dz\xe1i came
 forward and gave you a tight hug, as did her husbands Vis\xe1n and Pi'\xfar;
 but she had just arrived that morning after over two years away, and it
 was not long until social obligation dragged them all off.  You found
 yourself left to your own devices.  Various rooms in the clan-house
 were set aside for puppet shows, poetry readings, and a display by
 dancers.  How did you occupy yourself?

 A: I looked for Wave, I mean S\xe1yi
 B: I went to watch the puppet show
 C: I went to see the dancers
 D: I went to go listen to the poetry reading

>b
 larger rooms, and had gathered a crowd.  On this stage, in front of
 backdrops of painted cloth, moved magically animated puppets, each the
 size of your forearm.  Directed by the spells of the puppeteers -- the
 secrets of which are protected by law and assassination -- the wooden
 figures were acting out the tale of Pend\xe1rte of Kh\xe9iris who had
 traveled throughout the many planes of reality to rescue the soul of
 Princess Ss\xedneleth from the horrific demon R\xfc'\xfctl\xe1nesh.

 The puppet playing Pend\xe1rte moved from Plane to Plane (each with its
 own backdrop, showing fantastical landscapes) and in each one faced a
 new foe crafted of paper or bone or gems.  Sometimes they would battle,
 while in other scenes Pend\xe1rte would humorously trick the demon.  In
 the climactic battle, the small hero was pitted against a monstrous and
 ill-formed puppet made of reeds and paper.  Pend\xe1rte's wooden sword
 clattered against R\xfc'\xfctl\xe1nesh's many limbs, occasionally breaking a
 reed with a loud snap that would cause the audience to gasp.
 R\xfc'\xfctl\xe1nesh appeared to use magic to cause wounds to spontaneously open
 upon Pend\xe1rte and pour forth blood (or rather, red ink).

 The battle was waged back and forth across the stage, until finally
 Pend\xe1rte leaped upon the great demon's back, and stabbed down with his
 sword into the fragile paper.  Then, from this husk rose the Princes
 Ss\xedneleth.  The crowd all snapped approval. The evening was yet young;
 where did you go next?

 A: I looked for Wave, I mean S\xe1yi
 B: I went to see the dancers
 C: I went to go listen to the poetry reading

>b
 green (very little of it) danced to the music of drums and a stringed
 _tentur\xe9n_.  The silver bells upon their anklets created their own tune
 as they swayed and stamped in unison. There are many stories in Jak\xe1lla
 of men who have risked their wealth, social standing, and even lives
 for the favor of a skilled dancing girl, and those hired by clan Golden
 Sunburst are very skilled indeed.

 The dancers continued their display, at times languorous, at others
 frantic. The dancers continued their display, at times languorous, at
 others frantic.  Watching them sway rhythmically to and fro, you fell
 into a gentle sleep.  It had been a long day.  Someone must have
 collected you when the party ended, for you have a vague memory of
 being groggily undressed, and then more unconsciousness.

 . . . What happens the next morning and in the years to come is a story
 not yet written.

 I hope you enjoyed playing my game.  If you did, keep an eye out on
 www.choiceofgames.com for the full story when I have written it.

 I want to thank M.A.R. Barker for giving me permission to spin a tale
 in his fabulously detailed world of Tekumel, more information about
 which can be found at www.tekumel.com.

 I also want to thank Dan and Adam for letting me write in choicescript
 and teaching me how to do so.

 of Lady Dlam\xe9lish.  The Green Eyed Lady is a mystical goddess of
 pleasure who encourages her followers to live in the moment and seek
 out new experiences.   As a soldier you do her honor whenever you feel
 the rush of battle or gaze triumphantly upon a new vista.  The statue
 of a beautiful and sensuous woman before you is her thirty-fourth
 aspect: Mrik\xe1ya, "She Who Takes Pleasure in Battle".  On the altar you
 pleasingly arrange three large green blossoms and several silver coins.
 And what brings you to Dlam\xe9lish's Temple?

 the Tsoly\xe1ni Imperium; and a soldier who is good at his trade,
 respectful of his superiors, and liberal with bribes can rise far,
 especially with a little luck.  Hopefully this offering has brought you
 that luck.

 As you finish praying the silence of the temple is disturbed by the

 corps, you studied the casting of spells in Temple School, attaining a
 low priestly rank.   You strike the ritual poses needed to bring forth
 a spell and the assassin's eyes widen in fear.

 A great force cracks the stone flagging as she leaps aside and throws a
 small bronze  dagger which lodges in your thigh.  It is suicide to cast
 spells while touching metal, and she charges you like a wild zrn\xe9
 beast, pressing the attack before you can remove the knife.

 A: Though an accomplished spell caster and leader of men, I am no match
 for an assassin in close combat, so I fight defensively and whistle for
 two of my soldiers who are stationed outside.
 B: I am as deadly with a sword as I am with my spells, and leap to meet
 her attack with a ferocious counter attack.

>b
 grab your chl\xe9n hide sword and leap forward.  After a few exchanges,
 you boldly duck down and remove the bronze dagger.  Fearing your spells
 the assassin backs away.

 A: She is too tired now to dodge my spell which crushes her with
 terrifying force.  Her death is a fair price for an attempt upon my
 life, but I make it quick.
 B: With careful finesse I use my spell to pin her gently to the stone
 floor. I'm curious to know whether it's true that Assassins cannot be
 tortured into betraying their clients.
 C: I once more strike the poses needed to cast spells and summon forth
 a ball of flame.  "Do you yield?"

 A: I let her go.
 B: I have changed my mind.  She cannot be left alive.

 somehow.

 So, why would someone send an assassin after you anyway?

 status and the situation taken into consideration, you were given a
 light punishment.  Not knowing the regret you carry in your heart for
 that red deed, his family saw only a murderer going unpunished, and
 have spent a small fortune in pursuit of vengeance.  You are unsure how
 to handle the situation.

 the manner of wine-merchants offering a vintage for evaluation.  The
 first couple miles pass in small-talk, but as the afternoon proceeds
 you are left alone with your thoughts which naturally settle upon the
 recent attempt upon your life.

 From there, it is a small step to thinking about the events around the
 time of your naming day celebration, and the unfortunate incident that
 resulted in the assassination attempt. . .

 Your childhood in the great clan-house of White Stone was pleasant.
 Your household possessed plenty of slaves to do menial toil and an
 abundance of wealth.  Your numerous clan mothers and fathers (your
 parents' siblings and their spouses) lavished affection upon you.
 During the day you were taught reading, writing, maths, ritual magic
 and history at the temple school of Dlam\xe9lish; and in the evenings you
 slept in barracks-like dormitories with your "clan cousins"(other
 children of the clan, most of them unrelated to you by any close blood

 Many of the older adolescents, on the verge of adulthood, snuck between

 dormitory and walk through the damp hall on the chilly spring night.
 You simply dragged your sleeping mat over next to Wave, who was still
 awake, waiting for you.  "Tiuni, I was worried you were mad at me and
 were not coming tonight," he whispered.  You thought how strange it
 would be that after tomorrow no one would ever call you Tiuni again.
 There was pride in the idea that you would finally have an adult's name
 and an adult's responsibilities.

 Earlier that day you had found Wave gambling with some of the other
 boys in one of the courtyards.  You knew that his mother would not have
 approved of gambling, and worst of all, he had placed the small ceramic
 amulet of _Dlet\xe1ra_ "The Goddess of Reflective Pleasures," patroness of
 love between members of the same sex, that you had given him in the
 pot!  After the dice had been thrown and he had won, Wave had claimed
 he had only bet it because he had known it would bring him luck; but as
 Wave slipped the amulet back around his neck, and gathered up his
 winnings, you had stormed off with tears in your eyes.  Though Wave was
 beautiful and clever, he could also be spoiled, sure that his winning
 personality could get him out of any situation.

 Now he was looking up at you with a vulnerable worry, different from
 the brash assurance of earlier in the day.

 A: "I could not stay angry with you."
 B: "You hurt my feelings, _ts\xe1mmeri_, when you do not value my gifts."
 C: "If you ever do something like that again, we're through!"

>a
 under.  "I knew you would understand!" His smile was like the sun
 coming out from behind the clouds, a joyous grin that made your heart
 speed faster, and promised an evening of sweet delight.  The birds were
 chirping in the pre-dawn darkness before you fell asleep that night.

 The next thing you knew, cold water was startling you out of sleep.
 Sputtering you looked up to see your elder brother, Gay\xe1n, smiling down
 at you.

 "Sleep well, little brother? Or did you not sleep at all?"  Here he
 leered at Wave, and waggled his eyebrows.  Gay\xe1n fancied himself a
 comedian.  "Well, I have come to break you two apart. Mother Hal\xe9 is in
 a state of distraction over the fit of your formal dress, and has told
 me that if I do not bring you back immediately she will feed me to a
 dragon.  Oh!" here he looked again at Wave, "and your parents wish your
 company as well."

 Without waiting for a response, Gay\xe1n grabbed you up by the arm and
 dragged you from the barracks.

 You were barely through the door before Mama Hal\xe9 was fastening a
 jeweled _chl\xe9n_-hide collar over your shoulders, and arranging a kilt
 around your waste.  As she eyed and adjusted its drape she barraged you
 with unsolicited advice about the upcoming ceremony.

 "Ti\xfani, you must not slouch during the parade.  And when you get to the
 temple, and are upon the altar, be decorous. And afterwards do not
 drink too heavily or overindulge in the powders.  There will be ten of
 you getting your names today, and half of B\xe9y S\xfc has turned out to see,
 and you must be the most shining youth present. . ." on and on she
 chattered.

 Mama Hal\xe9 was your birth-mother's sister and had raised you since you
 were an infant. Your other mother, Dz\xe1i, had declared herself _arid\xe1ni_
 at her own naming ceremony, and so taken on rights and responsibilities
 normally reserved for men.  She had joined a legion and marched to war
 while her sister elected to remain a "good clan girl" and accept the
 more traditional role for women.  Hal\xe9 was not considered legally a
 person in her own right, could not own property, and could not be sued
 or challenged to a duel; but she was still a formidable personality,
 actively involved in the work and social life of Clan White Stone.

 And now all of her will was bent on getting you through the day without
 a misstep that might provide fodder for gossips and lower your family's
 prestige within the clan-house.   How did you feel about the
 celebration?

 A: I was excited to be an adult, but just wanted to survive the day
 without disgracing myself.
 B: I am always up for a good party and meant to enjoy myself.
 C: This was my chance to impress my clan elders and the rest of the
 city's notables.

>b
 maintain an enthusiastic and relaxed demeanor.  At one point you saw
 Wave being herded through a corridor by all 8 of his parents, and give
 him a smile.  Eventually you found yourself joining the other nine
 soon-to-be adults for the procession to the Temple of Dlam\xe9lish. Many
 of them seemed petrified or puffed up, but you managed to crack the
 tension with smiles and wit. The city of B\xe9y S\xfc lays alongside the
 mighty Mss\xfama river in the heart of the Empire.  This epicenter of
 mercantile trade, bureaucracy and priestly politics is known as 'The
 Soul of the World'.  Thus, as White Stone's parade wound through the
 city's streets to the temple of Dlam\xe9lish it was but one small display
 amongst many in the giant metropolis.  It was, however, an especially
 fine one, including a select group of the most important people in most
 powerful city in the greatest empire since the fall of Engsv\xe1n hla
 G\xe1nga.

 The ceremony at the temple was similarly tasteful and intimate.  The
 noble guests filed through a vast courtyard lined with statues of the
 aspects of the goddess, and into a small, but opulent shrine.  In the
 cool shadows of the vaulted ceiling the guests arranged themselves on a
 series of raised daises according to rank while the ten of you stood
 before an altar.  There you waited, still and proud, on display, as
 what seemed at the time like every notable in B\xe9y S\xfc filed in.

 When all were seated, a priest and priestess, each dressed in elaborate
 finery, appeared. The woman orated upon the ancient roots of Clan White
 Stone; on the histories of the lineages of each young man or woman
 standing before her; on the virtues of duty to the clan, of honor and
 piety before the goddess.  With these words, she approached the first
 youth and led him up to lie upon the altar amidst a bed of flowers.
 There, in view of all, the priestess and the young man came together in
 the way most pleasing to Dlam\xe9lish.  Afterward, all present snapped
 polite approval.

 As the applause died away the priest read out the man's new name from a
 scroll, and a sacrifice was passed from a waiting slave to the new
 adult, and from him to the priestess.  This ritual was then repeated
 for each young man or woman in turn.  When you had been helped down
 from the altar, what name was read out?

 A: Ach\xe1n
 B: F\xedru
 C: K\xe1mar
 D: Mn\xe9ktu
 E: T\xfarisan
 F: Zhur\xe1k
 G: None of these

>again

>Snuggles
 An excellent and noble name! And what offering did you present?

 A: A large pile of coins of pure silver
 B: A green glass vial filled with sweet perfume
 C: An emerald colored snake

>c
 ancient and exalted clan of White Stone is proud to welcome its newest
 member, Snuggles hiVriy\xe9n. _Otul\xe9ngba!_" At his joyous shout, the
 crowd replied in a chorus: "_Otul\xe9ngba!_, All Hail!"

 The ritual of naming was repeated for the next clan cousins, and then
 Wave was led up upon the altar.  Afterwards he presented the priest of
 Dlam\xe9lish with a necklace of emeralds. The priestess then read from the
 scroll "The ancient and exalted clan of White Stone is proud to welcome
 its newest member, S\xe1njesh hiT\xe1nkolel.  _Otul\xe9ngba!_," and once more
 the crowd snapped approval.

 Soon the ceremony ended, and attention drifted away from the newly
 named adults and onto more important things like fashion, gossip, trade
 deals, and news of the war with the country of Yan Kor.  Mama Dz\xe1i came
 forward and gave you a tight hug, as did her husbands Vis\xe1n and Pi'\xfar.
 You walked with them as the group proceeded to the House of Unmarred
 Repose, where White Stone had reserved a suite of rooms for a
 celebration. But Dz\xe1i had just arrived that morning after over two
 years away, and as soon as you passed through the door social
 obligation dragged her away.  You found yourself left to your own
 devices.  Various rooms in the hostel were set aside for puppet shows,
 poetry readings, and a display by dancers.  How did you occupy
 yourself?

 A: I looked for Wave, I mean S\xe1njesh
 B: I went to watch the puppet show
 C: I went to see the dancers
 D: I went to go listen to the poetry reading

>a
 you explored the party.  S\xe1njesh was clearly enjoying acting the part
 of the sophisticated adult, an effect that was only ruined by
 occasional grins and laughter. Now that you young lovers were reunited,
 where did you venture?

 A: I went to watch the puppet show
 B: I went to see the dancers
 C: I went to go listen to the poetry reading

>c
 one corner was a dais upon which stood a poet, declaiming lines from
 'The Lament to the Wheel of Black', the tale of the great war between
 the gods at the beginning of days, begun when Lord Ks\xe1rul, god of
 secrets and arcane magic, attempted make himself supreme over the
 others.  At first, the gods of Change gladly joined him in fighting
 against their opposite numbers who served Stability, but one by one
 they realized that his victory would mean their subservience and joined
 forces with Stability to lock him within the Blue Room, where he
 remains imprisoned today.

 The last of the gods to leave his side was his lover Dlam\xe9lish, and it
 is of her betrayal that the poet spoke.  She began with the two walking
 together upon D\xf3rmoron Plain, and Ks\xe1rul gifting Dlam\xe9lish an obsidian
 dagger.  At this the audience all nodded and sighed, for it was well
 known that it was this dagger which Dlam\xe9lish used to erect her seal
 upon his prison.  The poet was good--or perhaps had just suffered a
 breakup herself?--for she managed to infuse the dialogue between the
 two with frustration and sorrow, turning the stanzas into a referendum
 on the impossibility of love in a universe where pride holds sway.  The
 more soft hearted audience members were openly weeping by the story's
 end. S\xe1njesh looked at you apologetically, and squeezed your arm
 through the end of the tale, clearly regretting the events of the
 previous day.

 No one seemed eager to follow the woman and there was a brief lull.
 Did you seize the moment and deliver a poem?

 A: I am a classically educated and extremely cultured noble, of course
 I chose to orate!
 B: I am afraid I never had a head for memorization of such stories.
 C: I know a great many poems, but was too shy to present myself.

>a

 A: These people needed to be cheered up.  I declaimed something light
 and comical..
 B: Clearly everyone present was a sucker for romantic tragedy, so I
 gave them more of the same.
 C: A tale of martial valor seemed appropriate, there was a war on after
 all.

>b
 Garden of the Weeping Snows--only to end frozen as a statue a hair's
 breadth from her touch for all eternity--reinforced the mood of
 sentimental despair.  A certain despondency hung in the room as you
 left. The evening was yet young; where did you go next?

 A: I went to watch the puppet show
 B: I went to see the dancers

>a
 larger rooms, and had gathered a crowd.  On this stage, in front of
 backdrops of painted cloth, moved magically animated puppets, each the
 size of your forearm.  Directed by the spells of the puppeteers -- the
 secrets of which are protected by law and assassination -- the wooden
 figures were acting out the tale of Pend\xe1rte of Kh\xe9iris who had
 traveled throughout the many planes of reality to rescue the soul of
 Princess Ss\xedneleth from the horrific demon R\xfc'\xfctl\xe1nesh.

 The puppet playing Pend\xe1rte moved from Plane to Plane (each with its
 own backdrop, showing fantastical landscapes) and in each one faced a
 new foe crafted of paper or bone or gems.  Sometimes they would battle,
 while in other scenes Pend\xe1rte would humorously trick the demon.  In
 the climactic battle, the small hero was pitted against a monstrous and
 ill-formed puppet made of reeds and paper.  Pend\xe1rte's wooden sword
 clattered against R\xfc'\xfctl\xe1nesh's many limbs, occasionally breaking a
 reed with a loud snap that would cause the audience to gasp.
 R\xfc'\xfctl\xe1nesh appeared to use magic to cause wounds to spontaneously open
 upon Pend\xe1rte and pour forth blood (or rather, red ink).

 The battle was waged back and forth across the stage, until finally
 Pend\xe1rte leaped upon the great demon's back, and stabbed down with his
 sword into the fragile paper.  Then, from this husk rose the Princes
 Ss\xedneleth.  The crowd all snapped approval. By this time the party had
 begun to thin, and by mutual consent you and S\xe1njesh left to return to
 the clan house's dormitory, where you had a great deal of fun
 discovering how to remove formal dress of the 19th traditional form.

 . . . What happens the next morning and in the years to come is a story
 not yet written.

 I hope you enjoyed playing my game.  If you did, keep an eye out on
 www.choiceofgames.com for the full story when I have written it.

 I want to thank M.A.R. Barker for giving me permission to spin a tale
 in his fabulously detailed world of Tekumel, more information about
 which can be found at www.tekumel.com.

 I also want to thank Dan and Adam for letting me write in choicescript
 and teaching me how to do so.

 Not a Dungeon

 No! My shiniest of shiny objects! Don't fly aw--- Come back! I love
 you!

 Well, now that my girlfriend's mad at me, where were we? Ah, right.

 It's kind of boring here. I hear the king hasn't put anybody in the
 dungeon in over a year. Must make you feel special. It's drafty, being
 up in the tower, and the stones in the wall have chips and various---
 do you really care? They're old. The door looks pretty sturdy. There's
 some light coming into the room from a window about, uh, twice your
 height up. Can we leave?

 I can see a tapestry, a bed, a mirror and an annoying git in a dress
 here.

>examine me
 You're a mediocre wizard. No, no, boss, don't look sad! Wait for me to
 finish! You're a great inventor! See, there was a compliment coming.
 You always have the best ideas. Remember Primo Eyeballs-in-a-Can? That
 was my personal favorite, for obvious reasons. But your ideas don't
 always, er, work right. That's why you took the wizarding job: 'cause
 it gets you money to work on your inventions until we hit it big. Which
 we will, as soon as we replace all that missing money and keep you from
 getting killed and, um, okay, this is probably not cheering you up as
 much as I'd hoped.

 Right now your body is in the corner, unconscious. You're wearing your
 completely awesome purple robe, but your hat got lost in the arrest
 fiasco. The stupid fat guy searched you and took all your stuff, but
 maybe there's something he missed. I don't know.

>inventory
 I'm carrying around:
   the mind of a mediocre wizard

>examine mirror
 It's an oval mirror with a steel frame bolted to the wall. The frame
 has little diamond-shaped cutouts in it. The mirror itself is about as
 big as I am. It's got a big dent in it, but it still works as a
 reflective surface.

>look in mirror
 Hey, it's me! I'm W.D., your familiar, and I'm awesome. Check out these
 feathers!

>examine dent
 I can't see any such thing.

>open mirror
 That's not something I can open.

 Not a Dungeon
 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine dress
 I love your robe. It's so stylish. It's purple and dark purple and
 darker purple and all swirly patterned and stuff, and it's covered in
 sequins and sparkles and shiny and glittery and glowy! It's
 mesmerizing. You look great, even unconscious. There are big floppy
 pockets sewn inside. You usually keep all kinds of stuff in there.

>look in pockets
 Hey, hey, there's a magic wand in one of the pockets! Man, the fat guy
 didn't even think it was worth taking? That's just sad.

>examine wand
 This is the Aetheric Coin Generator Mark III! It turns air into faery
 coins. The Mark I only lasted through seven thousand uses or so, and
 Mark II backfired and turned coins into air.

>examine tapestry
 It's a garish sight. I'm usually all over things with more than thirty
 colors, but none of these even go together. I don't think humans are
 supposed to be that shade of orange. I think the blue blobby thing is
 meant to be a unicorn, but that's a wild guess.

 The tapestry was probably made by the late queen. I've heard stories
 about her prolific and, er, unique talent. I'm sure the old guy
 couldn't bear to throw it out, and nobody else could bear to look at
 it. There's a wobbly inscription woven into the corner.

>examine inscription
 "To my beloved on our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. May our love
 always be as eternal as the flowing fountain."

 That's a fountain? I guess this was made by the queen. Aw, that's so
 sad. I mean, she had no taste, but they say the old guy really loved
 her and went mad with grief after she died. I guess that was good for
 us, with you getting the job here and him never caring what you did.

>look behind tapestry
 I don't see anything interesting or valuable.

>examine inscription
 "To my beloved on our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. May our love
 always be as eternal as the flowing fountain."

>get tapestry
 That's fixed in place.

>examine bed
 It's a wooden bed frame that would be big enough for one human with a
 mattress or pillows, but there aren't any around. It doesn't look
 particularly comfortable, and the wood's splintering.

>look under bed
 Nothing but a bit of dust.

>examine door
 It's a big wooden door, wide enough for two humans to walk through it
 at once. Based on all the noise when they threw us in here, it's locked
 from the outside.

>open door
 Hmm, the latch won't move. I think it's locked, and I don't think I'd
 be strong enough to push it open even if it weren't. Wings aren't
 really good for that kind of task.

>examine hinges
 I can't see any such thing.

>examine window
 The "window" is just a space in the stones. It's smaller than a human
 but bigger than a raven, if you catch my drift.

>wake wizard
 (the annoying git in a dress)
 Your body is out cold from that whack the guards gave you, apparently
 unconscious beyond what I can fix with ravenous violence. You're lucky
 you ate one of your Mind Melding Mints when you did. I am not so lucky.

 I will also point out that I have not eaten your delicious eyeballs,
 despite having a perfect opportunity to do so. You're welcome.

>examine mind
 It's...well...it's hard to describe what it's like to have someone else
 in your head.

>eat eyeballs
 I can't see any such thing.

>put mind in wizard
 (the annoying git in a dress)
 If only it was that easy.

>poke wizard
 That's not a verb I recognize, boss.

>peck wizard
 (the annoying git in a dress)
 ..You know what? You, I will do random violence to. Consider yourself
 pecked. You're still unconscious, though.

>fly through window
 Whooooosh! I'm flying out the window to sweet, delicious freedom! And
 to sweet, delicious rotting meat, with any luck.

 Castle Gate
 The gate's closed, which is a pity since we could probably steal a lot
 of nice stuff if we could get into the throne room or the king's
 bedroom. But the castle's on lockdown while the treasurer tries to
 figure out where the king's wandered off to, and I'm not going to
 attempt to peck my way through the giant wooden doors.

>go west

 Farmland
 I've stopped in front of a cottage, which is the only interesting thing
 for miles. Fields of corn barely taller than I am surround us and make
 for a really dull view. Civilization is back to the northwest, and the
 castle is east of here.

 There's a red barn off to the west.

 I can also see a hedgehog here.

>examine hedgehog
 Hedgehogs are, sadly, inedible, so there's not much to say about them.
 This one is frolicking, which is very undignified. In fact, I think
 it's singing.


>listen to hedgehog
 It appears to be singing about how nice it is to be pointy. I think I'm
 losing intelligence just listening to it.

 The hedgehog starts to sing:

     Doop de dooooooo,
     It's a round life for meeeeee!
     We're roly and poly
     And hedgyhogoly,
     A life in the hedge is for meeeeee!

>peck hedgehog
 I wish I could, but he's just too pointy.

>hedgehog, hello
 "Hey, hedgehog, I---"

 "Hi! Got any food? Got any food? Iiiiiiiiii'm pointy!"

 I think I'm done here.

 The hedgehog starts to sing:

     Singing is the best,
     The best, the best!
     What's the best?
     That's riiiiiiiiight, it's siiiiiiiinging!

>ask hedgehog about food

 "Hi! Got any food? Got any food? Iiiiiiiiii'm pointy!"

 I think I'm done here.

>feed hedgehog

 I haven't got the hedgehog.

>take hedgehog
 I don't see how, and I would probably just get shooed away again.

>ask hedgehog what is wrong
 I didn't understand that sentence.

 The corn won't be ripe for months. I wish we still had some of that
 Numinous Plant Enhancer left. Man, that was a great invention. It
 turned plants into rotting meat! I don't understand why nobody wanted
 to buy it.

 The hedgehog starts to sing:

     The best, the best!
     What's the best?
     That's riiiiiiiiight, it's siiiiiiiinging!

 It's a bit far off to see very well.

 The hedgehog starts to sing:

     Is a happy happy hog!
     It's a good day for eating
     And siiiiiiiiiiiinging!

>examine cottage
 A fairly nondescript house of the sort I understand humans like to live
 in. Its door is ajar.

>enter cottage

 Cottage
 These little country houses are hit or miss. Sometimes they have good
 food to steal. Sometimes their owners want to cook and eat you. This
 particular one is a one-room cottage with a thatched roof. The
 chimney's the nicest thing here. Unfortunately for us, there's nothing
 cooking on the fireplace. No fire either, so waiting around here isn't
 going to get us any food. Nobody's here, though the door to the north
 is ajar.

 A ramshackle table stands against the wall.

 There are some farming tools in the corner of the cottage.

>examine chimney
 It's a red brick chimney. I'm not a great judge--- I don't know why
 anyone would ruin meat by setting it on fire--- but it looks nicer than
 the rest of the house. The bricks look like they're exactly the same
 size, and they're laid out in straight rows. Most of them, anyway; one
 is sticking out a bit. It looks like the mortar surrounding it has been
 cut away.

>examine brick
 There's one brick in the fireplace that's sticking out. It looks like
 the mortar around it's been cut away.

>pull brick
 Okay. It's a rough surface. I can probably get my claws in and drag it
 out. Rrrgh! Well, I didn't manage to pry it all the way out, but I did
 shift it a little. There's a parchment concealed under the brick.

>get parchment
 Taken.

>read it
 This is...well...man, this is a lot of text. I didn't know humans could
 write letters that tiny. Give me a minute.

 ...Okay, I'm pretty sure it's some kind of insurance policy. Bearer
 gets...um, hmm. I think it's an insurance policy on a barn west of
 here, but don't quote me on that.

>examine table
 The table doesn't have any food on it, so it's hard to work up any
 interest in it.

>look under table
 Good idea! Maybe there are some shiny coins or something!

 No, sadly.

>examine tools
 They're some tools that you humans probably use to farm, uh, farm
 stuff. Some of them have pointy bits, if that helps.

>get tools

 usually a violent one.

 Hey, this is hard-earned stuff. I'm not just giving it away here.

>go west

 Barn
 Yep, big red barn. It's got a new paint job, too. It looks like it's in
 good condition, actually. I don't see any cobwebs in the corners or
 birds' nests, so either it's been freshly-built or they really cleaned
 the place out recently. Even the hay in the stalls is untrampled.

 I can see a pile of hay here.

>examine hay
 The hay is dry and clean, which is pretty atypical for hay in a barn. I
 wonder if they haven't moved the animals in yet.

 Big Street, South End
 Big Street is the main street in the city. It's big enough for four
 wagons to pass side by side (hence the name), and it's actually cobbles
 instead of dirt like all the other roads. There are various shops
 selling clothes and other things we don't care about. This stretch of
 the road is pretty boring; the financial district is farther north.

 Big Street is as big here as it is further to the south, although

 Magic Shop
 Mel's Magnificent Mystical Minutiae is the real deal. You can get all
 sorts of magical things here. Some of it is cheap junk that doesn't
 work, and that's what most people get; but if you want serious magic
 (and you've got serious money), Mel's is the place.

 We're here to ask Mel for a Midas potion specifically, which might save
 your bacon.

 Some of Mel's famous Exploding Cockroaches are on display here.

 A red balloon is here, probably as part of some promotion.

 Mel's at the counter.

>examine mel
 Mel notices me and gives me a boisterous greeting. "Hey, W.D.! How's my
 favorite raven doing? How's your boss? Need more color-changing powder?
 I have to warn you, I don't think this 'Cow of a Different Color'
 project is going to catch on."

 "Not good, Mel. The Perfectly Foolproof Illusion on the treasury
 wasn't."

 "Oh. Does that mean you are recently unemployed? Would you like a job?
 I've been meaning to branch out into delivery, but people are afraid of
 golems, so..."

 "No, no. The boss is still good, at least for a few hours. I may be
 back tomorrow, though. (No offense, boss.) We, er, figure the only
 thing that might save the chief's bacon is to, uh, turn the fake
 treasure into...er..."

 "Yes?"

 "...real treasure. Uh, you wouldn't happen to have a Midas potion just,
 you know, lying around?"

 Mel's normally placid face darkens, and he glowers at me. "W.D., you
 know that I like you and your master, but I do not typically keep
 potions which are primarily composed of irreplaceable components just
 'lying around'. Besides, their manufacture is highly illegal, and I
 have an unfortunate allergy to prison."

 "I know, I know. It was a long shot. We just thought you might have
 something."

 Mel sighs. "I could possibly sell you some components, and then what
 you did with them would be up to you. But these ingredients are not
 cheap, and my favor to you would be selling them at all. You would have
 to come up with nearly enough money to repopulate the treasury on your
 own."

 "Oh. Well, I'm sure we can come up with something. I like shiny
 objects, after all. I can probably scrounge up some money."

 "All right. Good luck, W.D."

 ...Oh, shoot, I forgot what you asked me to do. Sorry, boss.

>examine cockroach
 They're amazingly realistic, except for the exploding part.

>ask mel about cockroach
 "How are the Exploding Cockroaches working out for you?"

 "Excellently, thank you. I will never tire of watching little Billy
 Goatsmith try to steal them."

>examine mel
 You know Mel! He runs the magic shop. He finds you charming, because
 you're like a kid to him, what with him being an actual super-duper
 wizard and you being sort of a tinkerer who can do a few spells here
 and there. Don't think that frowny face at me! It's not an insult! It's
 a fact. Mel likes the tinkering, anyway. He buys more of your
 inventions than anybody. I think he's still got some of the Exploding
 Cockroaches on the tricks shelf. He likes it when kids try to shoplift
 them.

 Anyway, in case you've somehow forgotten, Mel always looks happy. He's
 got enough magic power to do whatever he wants, but what he wants is to
 quietly retire in this little shop. He dresses all in green, and I
 think he conjures up his clothes himself. He wears glasses that can see
 into your soul. (Or maybe he just thinks they look cool.) He's also the
 only person in town other than you who isn't too stupid to speak Raven.

>examine balloon
 It's a shiny red balloon on a string, filled with that special air that
 makes things float. It's really shiny. We should keep it and look at it
 for a while.

>examine glasses
 I can't see any such thing.

>ask mel about tapestry
 "I'm not quite sure I follow you, W.D."

>tell mel about tapestry
 Frankly, boss, I don't think there's anything I can tell Mel that he
 doesn't already know. The man's a genius. We might have better luck
 asking questions, though.

>get balloon
 Taken.

>ask mel about balloon
 "Can I have the balloon?"

 "Yes, W.D. It's just there for advertisement. I can conjure up another
 one."

>get cockroach
 As you well know, those little guys are extremely unstable. Also, Mel's
 Magic Shop is you-break-it-you-buy-it.

>ask mel about hedgehog
 Mel shakes his head. "Sorry, I didn't catch that."

>ask mel about queen
 "The queen died, what, five years ago? That was before we got here.
 What was she like?" you ask Mel.

 "She was very active. Always a new project. One year it was beets; the
 next it was tapestries. I believe the populace approved of her in a
 bemused sort of way. She never did anything too harmful, and she never
 stuck with anything for too long. She was our own little goddess of
 chaos. She and the king were very much in love, of course. He loved her
 more than anything. More than his own sanity, certainly."

>ask mel about king
 "Do you think the king will let the treasurer go ahead and off the
 boss?"

 "I think the our dear king is not so mad that he can ignore the theft
 of the entire treasury. I think your employer is correct that replacing
 the money is his last, best hope for survival."

>ask mel about wand
 "Know anything about magic wands, Mel?"

 "Not much. They're really only used by less experienced or talented
 wizards. Most people outgrow them quickly. I think the usual way to
 activate one is by waving it."

>out
 I'm not in anything at the moment.

>go north

 Big Street, North End
 This is the heart of Moneyville, the financial district. There's a
 bank, the stock market, money changers - you want to spend and get
 money, you come here. This is a terrible part of town for getting food,
 but it's a great place for shiny, shiny gold. Everything here sparkles.
 Yeah...coins everywhere....Oh, sorry. I spaced out for a minute there.

 You can go west deeper into the city if you feel like being harassed by
 guards. The bank's east of here and the stock market's northeast.

 The bank's already closed for the day. That's unfortunate; it's
 probably full of money.

 Stock Market
 This is the floor of the stock market, and it's full of animals.
 There's hooting and honking and barking and mooing. I'm getting hungry
 just thinking about it.

 I can see a salesman here.

>examine salesman
 The salesman is wearing a fancy black suit. He seems faintly oily, but
 not in the delicious fried meats kind of way.

>examine animals
 There are more kinds of animals here than I can count. There must be,
 like, ten different kinds. They're currently alive, which is not the
 most delicious state for an animal, but I can dream.

>ask salesman about animals
 "Awk!"

 "Howdy, little birdie! Would you like to hear about Surety Insurance?
 We have policies to cover every..."

 This guy is evangelizing insurance to a bird. I've already zoned out.

 happen to the barn at 1 Farmland Farm, then the bearer will be entitled
 to...ah, let's see...eight thousand florins."

 This is Mindo Street. I think Mindo was the chancellor a long time ago

 which is less likely to contain snacks but also less likely to smell
 like people. Big Street's back east.

 Sandie's Hot Meats stall is here. Sandie's at the counter.

>examine sandie
 Sandie is a short, round woman. To a first approximation, she's a
 sphere. To a second approximation, she's a sphere with hands. She's got
 a greasy apron on and she smells fantastic. I love her and her meaty
 ways. She only loves me when I have money.

>get meat
 Boss, that is an excellent idea, but Sandie has a mean backhand.

>go south

 Castle Gate
 The gate's closed, which is a pity since we could probably steal a lot
 of nice stuff if we could get into the throne room or the king's
 bedroom. But the castle's on lockdown while the treasurer tries to
 figure out where the king's wandered off to, and I'm not going to
 attempt to peck my way through the giant wooden doors.

>go up

 Not a Dungeon
 It's kind of boring here. I hear the king hasn't put anybody in the
 dungeon in over a year. Must make you feel special. It's drafty, being
 up in the tower, and the stones in the wall have chips and various---
 do you really care? They're old. The door looks pretty sturdy. There's
 some light coming into the room from a window about, uh, twice your
 height up. Can we leave?

 I can see a tapestry, a bed, a mirror and an annoying git in a dress
 here.

>look in pockets
 In the robes is a magic wand.

>get wand

>wave wand
 Poof! A glittering coin materializes in the air in front of me and
 drops to the floor.

>give coin to sandie
 Sandy knows all about the fake money, Boss.

>examine coin
 This is one of your majick faery coins. They were incredibly useful for
 a while, but then some wiseacre figured out that they explode if you
 put salt on them. Now everyone in town knows they're not real gold. The
 coins are useless as currency, at least until we find a new idiot.

>examine salt
 I'm told that humans put salt on things to make them taste salty. Psh.
 The only seasoning meat needs is more meat.

>ask sandie about salt
 "Awk awk caw!"

 "I know what you want, W.D., but I'm not giving you any food unless you

>examine counter
 Sandie's Hot Meats is exactly what it says on the tin. It's a tent with
 a couple of tables and the delicious smell of hot, hot meat products.
 You can get the "Excitement Mix", which contains the random meat mix of
 the day, or you can pay twice as much to guarantee that you're eating
 pork or beef or some other animal you humans are picky about. (I
 suspect you get the Excitement Mix no matter what you pay for.) As
 usual, Sandie's here running the stall.

 Inside the meats stall are some meat pans, some salt and some pepper.

 Farmland
 I've stopped in front of a cottage, which is the only interesting thing
 for miles. Fields of corn barely taller than I am surround us and make
 for a really dull view. Civilization is back to the northwest, and the

 There's a red barn off to the west.

 I can also see a hedgehog here.

>go west

 Barn
 Yep, big red barn. It's got a new paint job, too. It looks like it's in
 good condition, actually. I don't see any cobwebs in the corners or
 birds' nests, so either it's been freshly-built or they really cleaned
 the place out recently. Even the hay in the stalls is untrampled.

 I can see a pile of hay here.

 You really aren't awake yet. You never are until at least your second
 cup of coffee, and this is only your first. You're having a hard time
 getting your eyes to focus. But it certainly looks like there's a man
 in your front yard, crouched down on all fours, gnawing at a leg.

 A human leg. Definitely. It's still wearing a sneaker. And a sock.

 The man gnawing on the human leg suddenly stops chewing, as though some
 sound disturbs him. He slowly looks up from his meal. His eyes don't
 blink, and they seem to be too large for his face. His mouth hangs
 open. Drool and blood trail down his chin.

 You heard about the outbreak in Millbury, of course. You just hadn't
 thought it was as serious as the eleven o'clock news made it out. They
 get hysterical about everything. A couple of inches of snow, and it's
 THE SNOWPOCALYPSE. You can't really be blamed for putting their
 ZOMBIEPOCALYPSE warnings in the same category. Boy who cried wolf,
 right?

 But it seems the newscasters were at least a little right, because
 there's a zombie chowing down on a human leg in your front yard.

 Shit.

 And just then you catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your
 eye, and a herd of at least twenty more zombies come staggering around
 the bend in the road. They are covering ground pretty steadily. Faster
 than you would have thought.

 The zombie with the leg sees them coming. He rises from his crouch,
 teeth bared, leg in hand. Some of the zombie herd move towards him.
 (Herd? Is that the right word? Maybe a flock? A decomposition of
 zombies or an infestation perhaps? ANYWAY...) They start a messy tug of
 war with the leg, mostly using teeth.

 Others look around for different prey. One goes for a squirrel. Some
 seem to be eyeing your front windows, though you're standing far enough
 back that you don't think they can actually see you.

 Still, this is really not good. Your house is on one floor, and the
 news footage made it pretty clear that zombies can break through glass
 with no trouble, zombifying some humans and eating others. And it seems
 that they've already started doing just that in your neighborhood,
 because those two zombies there have glass shards sticking out of their
 faces. And you recognize one of them--that annoying woman who always
 cuts in line at the coffee shop. She is moving towards your windows. So
 are about five others.

 You obviously can't stay in your house. What are you going to do?

 A: Sprint out the back door and into the woods.
 B: Slip out the side door and try to sneak past them to my car, while
 they're all occupied with legs and squirrels and windows.

>b
 really feel like you need it any more; your heart is hammering like
 you've just downed a triple espresso. You ease backward, moving
 carefully so the zombies approaching the window won't notice you. You
 duck out of sight into the kitchen, pause to slip your shoes on, and
 quietly unlock the side door.

 "Argh," you hear from the front room. It is followed by a sticky sound,
 probably from a wet hand (wet with what? ugh) slapping against your
 window.

 Ever so carefully, you turn the knob and open the door. You hear more
 hammering behind you, and now you can hear the growls of the zombies
 fighting over the human leg in your front yard. Your car is just ahead
 of you, backed into its usual parking space against the shed. You hope
 the front yard zombies are so obsessed with their leg-of-war that they
 won't catch sight of you tiptoeing across the driveway.

 The ten steps it takes you to reach the car are the ten most
 nervewracking of your entire life. But you manage to be quiet
 enough--the tangle of zombies in your front yard doesn't look up until
 the thud of the closing driver's side door.

 Then all their wide eyes go wider and they start for you, but you drive
 with your foot to the floor, tires squealing, out of your driveway and
 down your side street, heading for the main road.

 We should pause here to get straight a few details about you. First of
 all, are you male or female?

 A: Male.
 B: Female.

>Shawn Macaroni
 What's your profession? I mean, your profession now appears to be
 "zombiepocalypse survivor." But what was your profession before the
 world went to hell?

 A: Advertising executive.
 B: Paramedic.
 C: Software engineer.
 D: Plumber.

>b
 terrible accidents. That severed leg in your yard was not the first
 you've ever seen. You'd know how to amputate a limb yourself if you had
 to. More to the point, you know how to do the stuff necessary so
 amputating limbs isn't required. You're very good at CPR, setting
 broken bones, and stabilizing patients when hospitals are not
 available.

 And what do you most like to do in your spare time?

 A: Play sports.
 B: Play video games.
 C: Collect stamps.
 D: Woodwork.
 E: Hunting.

>c
 that.

 Congratulations, you have the most boring hobby on the planet. But I
 guess it might come in useful when fleeing from zombies. . . somehow.
 After all, you must have good eyes to distinguish one valuable stamp
 from ten thousand worthless ones. Maybe those pattern recognition
 skills will be useful when fleeing from zombies. You can hope.

 That tells us what you're good at, but you can't be perfect. What would
 you say is your worst quality?

 A: I'm terribly out of shape. I always say I'm going to do something
 about it, but I'm always so busy. . .
 B: I'm terribly uncoordinated. Always have been. I trip over stuff all
 the time.

>b
 The ability to keep quiet isn't likely to be important when you're. . .
 er, running from zombies.

 Right, then! Now that we know who you are, we'll return to "flight from
 the zombies," already in progress!

 The tires of your little Honda Civic squeal as you shoot down your
 street, heading for the main drag through town. You try not to look too
 hard at the scenes playing out on your neighbors' lawns. Some zombies
 cluster around first floor windows, matter-of-factly marching through
 shrubbery and glass to get at the tasty humans inside. Others cluster
 around tasty humans already dragged outside. A few chase your car for a
 while, but soon give it up in favor of pursuing the sounds or movements
 that signal easier prey.

 You really try not to look, but you can't help noticing that
 partially-eaten humans rise from the grass within a few moments of
 becoming partially-eaten, and join the throng of hungry zombies. Only
 if the hungry zombies have ripped their meal to pieces in the process
 of dining does the human appear to stay dead.

 The main street of town is even worse. Zombies punching through the
 glass windows of the pharmacy. Zombies dragging screaming people out of
 the coffee shop. Zombies pouring out of the pizza parlor. You don't
 think that's tomato sauce on their faces.

 You keep driving.

 You're almost at the town limits, and there aren't many buildings
 lining the street now. Mostly woods and fields. You're getting into
 farming territory. Sometimes you see a car abandoned on the side of the
 road, but you don't see any people. There aren't many people out here,
 which you hope means fewer zombies. . .

 . . . except there are three of them, right there in front of you.

 On the left side of the road is a large oak tree. I mean, a _really_
 large tree--it's locally famous; the base is something like twenty feet
 around. Three zombies are pressed up against the base, looking up into
 the branches like dogs who have just treed a squirrel.

 Which is an apt comparison, you realize a moment later. High up in the
 branches is a little kid. A boy, maybe nine or ten. As you come closer,
 you see that one of the zombies is jumping, and another trying to crawl
 up the tree trunk. The third seems to be experimenting with all the
 moving parts necessary to actually climb the tree, but hasn't worked
 them out yet.

 Still, it's very likely only a matter of time. You can see the kid's
 face clearly now. He looks terrified, and his mouth is open as though
 he is screaming for help.

 He's looking at you.

 Are you going to stop and help him?

 A: Yes, of course!
 B: No, there's nothing I can do.

>a

 Uh, what's your plan?

 You slow down as you approach the tree, considering your options.

 You could stop the car and fight the zombies. If you stopped the car
 some distance away, you might be able to fight them one at a time. You
 have a shovel in your trunk--because this past winter actually did have
 a lot of snowpocalypses, and in your part of the country, it's only
 sense to carry a shovel with you. You're glad now that you'd been lazy
 about putting it back in the shed.

 You could try to run the zombies over with the car. They'd have to move
 away from the tree first, though, because crashing the car into the
 tree wouldn't exactly be the desired outcome.

 Or. . . well, the Civic has a sunroof. And the kid is a little kid. You
 think you can drive close enough to the tree that the kid could jump
 through the sunroof. Or at least, jump onto the roof and then lower
 himself through the sunroof. You think you could execute the manuever
 before the zombies figured out how to swarm you, and anyway, they don't
 seem to be very coordinated. You might even be able to run one or more
 of them down at the same time.

 So what do you want to do?

 A: Stop the car, get out, and fight the zombies with my shovel.
 B: Beep the horn to get the zombies' attention, then run them over when
 they come to investigate.
 C: Open the sunroof, then drive the car close enough so the kid can
 drop down.

>b
 they move towards the hood of your Honda to investigate.

 You wait, heart pounding, until the female is correctly positioned.

 Then you gun the engine.

 She goes down under your wheels with a satisfying splat.

 You jerk the wheel quickly and manage to also graze the older male
 zombie, trapping his leg under the car. He pulls away, and it tears
 off. Not quite as effective as squashing him, but then, he won't be
 very effective either with only one leg. Out of the corner of your eye,
 as you turn your attention to the younger male, you see the older male
 pulling himself away using his hands. He isn't moving very fast.

 The younger male zombie pulls away slightly. Might that be a look of
 concern on his face? If they have enough intelligence or instinct to go
 after easy prey, they might have enough intelligence or instinct to
 retreat from predators--

 The younger male zombie backs away a few steps, then turns slightly.

 You think he is about to run.

 You have to get him now.

 You correctly judge in which direction he is about to move, and you gun
 the engine in time to have the car there when he does. Another splat
 under your wheels. Nicely done!

 "Wow," the kid says, once he's safely in the car beside you. "Three at
 once."

 You resume driving, with the kid beside you.

 You okay?

 A: Not really, no. I think about the things that used to be human
 beings, and it's all I can do not to vomit.
 B: More or less okay. That was. . . that was upsetting, but at least I
 saved a living person.
 C: Hell yeah! That was awesome!

>c

 "Oh," the kid says. "Yeah." He does.

 "What's your name?" you ask.

 "Kayden."
 "I'm Shawn Macaroni," you say. "Where are your parents, Kayden?"

 There's a pause. "Bottom of the tree," Kayden says. Another pause.
 "Third one was my brother."

 "Oh." You can't think of anything else to say.

 "It's okay," Kayden says.

 That's probably not true. But you're not quite sure how to say that.

 You also realize that the kid might be able to tell you how fast his
 parents turned into zombies after being bitten, and a number of other
 useful pieces of information. But you might traumatize him or something
 by asking.

 Is it more important to find out or to not traumatize the kid
 (further)?

 What do you say?

 A: "That's probably not true."
 B: "It doesn't have to be okay."
 C: "I'm really sorry."
 D: "How did your parents turn into zombies?"

>go down

 Are you going to question him any further?

 A: Yes.
 B: No, I just let it go.
 C: Only if I can figure out a way to do it gently.

>a
 really important later."

 He doesn't say anything.

 A: I let it go.
 B: I push harder.

>b

 Kayden sets his teeth. "There was a lady on the side of the road waving
 at us. Dad stopped and let her in. Mom didn't want him to, but he did.
 The lady was normal at first, but then she. . . got sorta quiet and
 weird. And we stopped because I had to pee, and when I got back to the
 car, she was. . . eating them. And then they were all. . . zombiefied,
 and I. . . climbed the tree."

 "Where did the lady go?"

 "I dunno. She ran off into the woods."

 So if somebody gets bitten and killed, they change almost instantly.
 But if they just get bitten, it takes longer. How much longer? "How
 long was the lady in the car with you before you stopped to pee?"

 "I dunno. A while."

 Even though you press, Kayden can't (or won't) give you any further
 information than that. Finally you let it go.

 It's quite for a while.

 "So," Kayden says. "Um. . . where are we going?"

 That's a very good question.

 In search of ideas, you switch on the radio. ". . . have upgraded the
 Zombie Watch to a Zombie Warning for the following counties," the radio
 says, and then the announcer rattles off a long list. The announcer
 seems pretty rattled herself. "I repeat, this is a serious and
 life-threatening situation. If you are in this area, you are in the
 path of the zombiepocalypse and should take shelter immediately.
 Zombies can break through glass and can climb stairs, so we are
 advising all residents to leave their homes while they still can.
 Groups of survivors have been forming at various locations throughout
 the state. Within the last hour, we have heard from the group at Maple
 Valley Mall, Cedar Junction Correctional Facility, and First Church of
 Fulton, so we can confirm that those are still viable sanctuaries for
 state residents fleeing the zombiepocalypse. Here is a list of school
 and business closings as a result of the zombiepocalypse. . . "

 Static engulfs the station again.

 It seems you have a decision to make.

 The church, the prison, and the mall are all in different directions.
 The church is about half the distance away as the other two
 sanctuaries. Which one will you head for?

 A: The mall.
 B: The prison.
 C: The church.

>a
 main road that will take you to the mall.

 "We're heading for the mall," you tell Kayden.

 You've still got a ways to drive through the country before you can
 pick up a main road, though. At least it's peaceful. No zombies. Just
 farmland. Old New England at its finest.

 You wonder what Lovecraft would have made of the zombiepocalypse.

 In some places, great big McMansions sit up on hills looking over acres
 of manicured lawn that used to be farmland but was sold to some rich
 person. You're coming up on one now, off to the left.

 "Who lives there?" Kayden wants to know.

 You have no idea.

 "Should we tell them what's happening?"

 Do you head for the house?

 A: No, can't risk it. They could already have turned, and I need to put
 my own safety first.
 B: Yes, to warn them.
 C: Yes, maybe I can leave Kayden with them.
 D: Yes, that house looks defensible.

>go down
 golf course, around some artistically-shaped shrubberies, and finally
 to a front door flanked by statues of stone lions.

 You hesitate, engine idling, wondering how best to approach. What if
 there are zombies inside?

 A: I leave the car, take the snowpocalypse shovel from the trunk, and
 go ring the bell. But I keep the car running.
 B: I honk the horn.
 C: To hell with this. I leave.

>b
 healthiest-looking fifty-year-old man you've ever seen pokes his head
 out. His short graying hair is standing all on end, and he is wearing a
 silk bathrobe and an irritated expression.

 "What the hell do you want?" he demands.

 "There's a horde of zombies on the loose," you say. "I stopped to warn
 you."

 Shortly thereafter, you and Kayden are installed at a breakfast nook
 table so spotless you're sure it can't be used very much. The entire
 house, in fact, looks so spotless it can't be used very much. The man
 in the bathrobe lives here alone. He's a surgeon, as it turns
 out--works in the hospital one city over. His name is Michael.

 He frowns as you describe your morning. It's the first he's heard of a
 zombie horde nearby. He's been at the hospital the last two days,
 because somebody infected with zombieism committed suicide by parking
 his car on railroad tracks, so there were many severe injuries
 requiring Michael's surgical expertise. He only got home and to bed a
 few hours ago. When you're done talking, he nods slowly. Then his eyes
 drift to contemplate the wall over your head as he thinks.

 So what are you going to say next?

 A: "Look, I'm going on to the mall, but I think it would be better if I
 left Kayden with you. A doctor would be better able to take care of a
 child."
 B: "I was thinking of going to the mall, but when I saw your house I
 thought maybe it would be better to try to defend a place like this."
 C: "I'm headed for mall. You should come too."

>b
 turning my house into a stronghold. It's a bad idea anyway--we'd be
 much better off joining a larger group. I'll come with you to the
 mall." Dryly, he adds, "You look like you could use all the help you
 can get."

 Right, so this asshole is pretty full of himself. How are you going to
 handle it?

 A: Snap back.
 B: Point out my own qualifications.
 C: Flatter his ego.
 D: Ignore his tone of voice.

>go down
 appreciate it."

 Michael nods. "Let me just get dressed and pack some medical supplies."

 It doesn't take Michael long to get ready. "It's not like I work out of
 my house," he says when he sees you eyeing his very small box of
 medical supplies. "Some are better than none, right? So what is it
 you're driving?" He looks out the window and makes a face at your
 little Civic. "We'd better take my car. It's an off-road vehicle--I
 like to go hiking in out of the way places when I'm not working--and we
 might have to drive off-road before this is all over."

 What do you say?

 A: He's right. It would be better to have an off-road vehicle.
 B: He's wrong. Off-road capability might be useful, but running out of
 gas will get us killed, and the Civic is more fuel-efficient.
 C: I don't care strongly either way, but I agree with him for the sake
 of building a relationship.
 D: He's probably right, but I resent his tone of voice, so I argue.

>a
 He insists on driving, of course.

 Out of the corner of your eye, you see Kayden playing around with what
 looks like a smartphone. "What are you doing?" you ask.

 "I thought my phone fell out of my jacket when I was up the tree,"
 Kayden says, "but it didn't. And I thought maybe the internet was still
 there. And it is. Look, Facebook has a zombiepocalypse survivor group!
 That way you can tell people you're okay. I'll put my name on it, and
 yours, and Michael's, okay?"

 "Sure," you say.

 "Hey, this is weird," Kayden says after another few minutes.

 "What's weird?"

 "So, there's all these posts, from the last few days--they're from all
 different people, and they all say, 'I'm still okay!' and 'Not
 zombified yet!' Except there aren't any from yesterday or today. Except
 from one guy-- Chris Murray. He's posted over and over again, every
 couple of hours, the same status--'COME GET ME! If you provide
 transportation to the Cedar Junction Correctional Facility, I can keep
 you safe from zombies on the way! I know what I'm talking about--look
 how long I've stayed alive!'" Kayden bends over the phone, a look of
 concentration on his face. "I'm going to message him and find out where
 he is."

 "Shit," Michael mutters.

 That puts you instantly on alert. "What?"

 "We're, um. . . " He looks sheepish. "Almost out of gas."

 How do you respond?

 A: "We're WHAT? You didn't freaking check before we left?"
 B: "Oh my God, that's it. We're going to get stranded and eaten."
 C: I don't say anything. I just check the apps menu to see if there's a
 GPS app that can take us to a gas station.

>A
 didn't."

 How do you respond?

 A: "This stupid all-terrain vehicle you wanted us to take is going to
 get us killed. We would have been okay with my Civic."

>a

 He's right there. What do you say?

 A: "Oh my God, we're dead, we're so dead. We're going to get stranded
 and eaten."
 B: I don't say anything. I just check the apps menu to see if there's a
 GPS app that can take us to a gas station.

>b

 You read out the directions, and Michael manuevers the Jeep into a
 deserted gas station along a lonely stretch of highway just as it
 begins to splutter and choke and stall.

 You get out of the car. Seems quiet enough.

 "I'm hungry," Kayden says.

 Michael looks with distaste at the gas station. "What they sell in
 there isn't really food, but it's better than starvation. Here--" He
 gets out of the car and says to you, "I'll pump, you go pick out
 whatever stuff you usually eat. Get me some bottled water and some
 nuts. Or plain granola bars. Something without high-fructose corn
 syrup."

 What a pain in the ass.

 A: I leave him to pump gas, and I go to get munchies.
 B: Since he's so particular, I send him to get munchies.

>b

 A: None at all. The best way to handle this jerk is pleasantly.
 B: Just a little, to hopefully communicate that he's crossing a line.
 C: Edge, nothing. I snap back that I'm not his servant.
 D: Edge, nothing. I communicate calmly and directly that I would
 appreciate him making requests instead of issuing orders.

>b
 and I'll pump the gas?" you say, in that over-precise tone people use
 when they are annoyed. Michael doesn't seem to notice it. He gives the
 gas station another contemptuous look and goes inside. You pump the
 gas.

 A moment later, Michael comes tearing back outside, dead white.
 "Zombie!" he snaps, and you scramble to get inside the car.

 You're quite a way down the road before your heart settles down, and
 only then do you realize that you got no food out of the encounter (and
 only half the gas you wanted). Still, better than nothing and much
 better than being zombie food.

 You really aren't awake yet. You never are until at least your second
 cup of coffee, and this is only your first. You're having a hard time
 getting your eyes to focus. But it certainly looks like there's a man
 in your front yard, crouched down on all fours, gnawing at a leg.

 A human leg. Definitely. It's still wearing a sneaker. And a sock.

 The man gnawing on the human leg suddenly stops chewing, as though some
 sound disturbs him. He slowly looks up from his meal. His eyes don't
 blink, and they seem to be too large for his face. His mouth hangs
 open. Drool and blood trail down his chin.

 You heard about the outbreak in Millbury, of course. You just hadn't
 thought it was as serious as the eleven o'clock news made it out. They
 get hysterical about everything. A couple of inches of snow, and it's
 THE SNOWPOCALYPSE. You can't really be blamed for putting their
 ZOMBIEPOCALYPSE warnings in the same category. Boy who cried wolf,
 right?

 But it seems the newscasters were at least a little right, because
 there's a zombie chowing down on a human leg in your front yard.

 Shit.

 And just then you catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your
 eye, and a herd of at least twenty more zombies come staggering around
 the bend in the road. They are covering ground pretty steadily. Faster
 than you would have thought.

 The zombie with the leg sees them coming. He rises from his crouch,
 teeth bared, leg in hand. Some of the zombie herd move towards him.
 (Herd? Is that the right word? Maybe a flock? A decomposition of
 zombies or an infestation perhaps? ANYWAY...) They start a messy tug of
 war with the leg, mostly using teeth.

 Others look around for different prey. One goes for a squirrel. Some
 seem to be eyeing your front windows, though you're standing far enough
 back that you don't think they can actually see you.

 Still, this is really not good. Your house is on one floor, and the
 news footage made it pretty clear that zombies can break through glass
 with no trouble, zombifying some humans and eating others. And it seems
 that they've already started doing just that in your neighborhood,
 because those two zombies there have glass shards sticking out of their
 faces. And you recognize one of them--that annoying woman who always
 cuts in line at the coffee shop. She is moving towards your windows. So
 are about five others.

 You obviously can't stay in your house. What are you going to do?

 A: Sprint out the back door and into the woods.
 B: Slip out the side door and try to sneak past them to my car, while
 they're all occupied with legs and squirrels and windows.

>a
 like you need it any more; your heart is hammering like you've just
 downed a triple espresso. You shove your feet into your running shoes
 and bolt for the back door. You snap open the lock, yank the door open,
 and run like hell across your yard and into the woods.

 As you run, you can hear growling and screaming from your front yard
 and your neighbors' front yards. It decreases doppler-fashion the
 farther into the trees you get.

 We should pause here to get straight a few details about you. First of
 all, are you male or female?

 A: Male.
 B: Female.

>b

>Zarah the Zombie Killer
 What's your profession? I mean, your profession now appears to be
 "zombiepocalypse survivor." But what was your profession before the
 world went to hell?

 A: Advertising executive.
 B: Paramedic.
 C: Software engineer.
 D: Plumber.

>a
 things they didn't actually want. Now that you're in management, you
 spend your life persuading your clients to go with your good ideas
 rather than their stupid ones, and persuading the people who work for
 you not to kill each other. This means you are both good at reading
 people and unusually persuasive.

 And what do you most like to do in your spare time?

 A: Play sports.
 B: Play video games.
 C: Collect stamps.
 D: Woodwork.
 E: Hunting.

>go east
 go several weekends during the season, with friends. You love the deep
 quiet of the woods, and you're proud of your precision with a rifle.

 You wonder if shooting zombies will turn out to be more or less
 difficult than shooting deer. You expect you'll be finding out. Soon.
 You wish you'd had time to get your gun on the way out the door.

 That tells us what you're good at, but you can't be perfect. What would
 you say is your worst quality?

 A: I'm terribly out of shape. I always say I'm going to do something
 about it, but I'm always so busy. . .
 B: I'm not a visual sort of person at all. Sometimes I envy people who
 can easily read maps and put together puzzles.
 C: I'm terribly uncoordinated. Always have been. I trip over stuff all
 the time.

>b
 you think about conceptually rather than things that you visualize.
 That's okay. You've developed many important skills that way, and I'm
 sure they'll come in useful as you. . . er, run from zombies.

 Right, then! Now that we know who you are, we'll return to "flight from
 the zombies," already in progress!

 Right, so you were running into the woods, zombie sounds decreasing
 doppler-fashion behind you. . .

 Once you're well into the forest, you stop to listen. You don't hear
 any rustling or anything, so you walk more slowly.

 Soon the trees begin to thin, and you can see glimpses of apple trees
 on the other side. This must be the outlying edge of Coursers' Farm,
 though you've never come at it from this direction. When you go to
 their farmstand, you always go by road. A few steps more, and you can
 see the farmhouse, some distance away. Beyond that is the long dirt
 road that leads from the farmstand to the farmhouse, and beyond that
 (though you can't see it) is a paved road.

 Are you going to head for the paved road, or go warn the Coursers?

 A: Warn the Coursers, of course! They may need my help.
 B: Warn the Coursers, of course! I bet they've got food and guns and
 useful supplies.
 C: Head for the paved road, thanks. I'm not about to risk going into
 that farmhouse. What if they've already turned?
 D: I'm staying right here.

>b

 You take the first step forward. . .

 . . . and something grabs your ankle and pulls you down. And then up,
 with astonishing strength.

 You find yourself upside down, dangling headfirst a few feet off the
 ground. There's a band of tight, hot pain clamped around your foot.

 Oh shit, you think dazedly. Zombies can set traps?

 The distinctive chi-chink of a shotgun comes to your ears.

 Oh, shit, you think. Zombies can use shotguns, too?

 But the old woman who steps slowly into your field of vision, shotgun
 aimed at your head, doesn't have the drooling, fixed-eyed look of the
 zombies in your front yard. She doesn't have the sagging, rotting
 flesh, either. She looks overall pretty healthy. She is observing you
 closely.

 "Lucky you didn't run into the bear trap," she says.

 How do you answer that?

 A: "Yeah, I guess so. That snare was really well-hidden. Yours?"
 B: "A BEAR trap? What the hell is the matter with you? What do you
 think you're doing, setting up dangerous things like this in the woods?
 Get me down from here!"
 C: It's sort of difficult to know how to respond, under the
 circumstances. I stay quiet.

>a
 both logic and the English language.

 The old woman grins a little. "You bet your behind, they're mine. No
 zombie's getting closer than this to my land."

 The old woman circles you again. "Don't seem like you want to eat me,"
 she says. "But you could be bit and just not turned yet. Safest thing
 is probably to leave you here."

 You don't think much of this idea at all. You envision yourself hanging
 here as a horde of zombies swarms through the woods. You envision them
 all trying to eat you as you dangle helplessly. They'd start with your
 head, you're sure. They'd try to take bites out of you as you swung
 back and forth between them, like bobbing for apples.

 "On the other hand," the old woman goes on, "that wouldn't be very
 neighborly, if you're really not bit. Guess I'd better let you down."
 She's near a particularly large oak tree now. She does something you
 can't see, and the pain around your ankle vanishes.

 To be replaced by a pain in your head, after you fall on it.

 "Now strip," the old woman orders, shotgun pointed at your head. "Prove
 you're not bit."

 You don't have lots of choices right at this moment, so you comply.

 And the old woman smiles. "Well, good, then! Good for you. You'd better
 come inside the perimeter. I'm Bonnie Courser, by the way. And you are?
 Nice to meet you, Zarah the Zombie Killer. Careful where you step, now.
 There's a few more snares where that came from."

 You follow in her footsteps veryveryvery carefully. On the way to the
 farmhouse, she points out five bear traps, four trapping pits, three
 snares, and two deadfall traps. "Knew they were coming," she says, in
 reference to the zombies--at least, you think so; you suppose it could
 as easily be in reference to the government or the Commies or
 something. "Can't be too prepared."

 In front of the farmhouse, a Jeep is waiting, about three-quarters
 packed with stuff. The farmhouse itself is empty and silent.

 "Where's the rest of your family, Bonnie?"

 "Won't be coming back," she says shortly. "I had to stay until I was
 sure, but I'm leaving now. There's a group of survivors dug in at the
 Cedar Junction Correctional Facility. I'm off to join them."

 "Why bother with all those traps, then. . .?"

 "I told you, had to wait until I was sure my family wouldn't be coming
 back. Had to slow the dead critters down. But the traps won't be enough
 against a real big horde. I'll do better at the prison." She puts her
 shotgun in the Jeep, where it has, you notice, several others to keep
 it company. Along with plenty of ammunition, and boxes of MREs. Bonnie
 looks up from her packing job at you. "So will you, if you want to
 come."

 Do you want to go with her to the prison, or do you want to fend for
 yourself?

 A: I'll go with her to the prison. She's got food and guns and a Jeep
 and seems to know what she's doing.
 B: She's got food and guns because she's clearly crazy. I don't want to
 be trapped in a Jeep with her. I'll fend for myself.

>a

 Bonnie takes the road that skirts around the edge of town, so you only
 pass a few houses.

 You try not to look too hard at the scenes playing out on the various
 lawns. Some zombies cluster around first floor windows,
 matter-of-factly marching through shrubbery and glass to get at the
 tasty humans inside. Others cluster around tasty humans already dragged
 outside. A few chase your car for a while, but soon give it up in favor
 of pursuing the sounds or movements that signal easier prey.

 You really try not to look, but you can't help noticing that
 partially-eaten humans rise from the grass within a few moments of
 becoming partially-eaten, and join the throng of hungry zombies. Only
 if the hungry zombies have ripped their meal to pieces in the process
 of dining does the human appear to stay dead.

 Bonnie turns on the radio at this point, distracting you.

 ". . . have upgraded the Zombie Watch to a Zombie Warning for the
 following counties," the radio says, and then the announcer rattles off
 a long list. The announcer seems pretty rattled herself. "I repeat,
 this is a serious and life-threatening situation. If you are in this
 area, you are in the path of the zombiepocalypse and should take
 shelter immediately. Zombies can break through glass and can climb
 stairs, so we are advising all residents to leave their homes while
 they still can. Groups of survivors have been forming at various
 locations throughout the state. Within the last hour, we have heard
 from the group at Maple Valley Mall, Cedar Junction Correctional
 Facility, and First Church of Fulton, so we can confirm that those are
 still viable sanctuaries for state residents fleeing the
 zombiepocalypse. Here is a list of school and business closings as a
 result of the zombiepocalypse. . . "

 Static engulfs the station again.

 That's interesting.

 The church, the prison, and the mall are all in different directions.
 The church is about half the distance away as the other two
 sanctuaries. Bonnie said you were headed for the prison, but it seems
 as though there are other options. You might be able to convince her to
 go to the mall or the church instead. Do you want to try?

 A: Yes, I want to go to the mall.
 B: Yes, I want to go to the church.
 C: No, I think the prison is the best bet.
 D: No, I don't want to anger Bonnie. I need her to survive.

>go down
 buildings lining the street now. Mostly woods and fields. You're
 getting into real farming territory. Sometimes you see a car abandoned
 on the side of the road, but you don't see any people. There aren't
 many people out here at all, which you hope means fewer zombies. . .

 . . . except there are three of them, right there in front of you.

 On the left side of the road is a large oak tree. I mean, a really
 large tree--it's locally famous; the base is something like twenty feet
 around. Three zombies are pressed up against the base, looking up into
 the branches like dogs who have just treed a squirrel.

 Which is an apt comparison, you realize a moment later. High up in the
 branches is a girl, you think maybe your age. As you come closer, you
 see that one of the zombies is jumping, and another trying to crawl up
 the tree trunk. The third seems to be experimenting with all the moving
 parts necessary to actually climb the tree, but hasn't worked them out
 yet.

 Still, it's very likely only a matter of time. You can see the girl's
 face clearly now. She looks terrified, and her mouth is open as though
 she is screaming for help.

 She's looking at you.

 What do you say to Bonnie?

 A: "We've got to help that woman!"
 B: "Step on the gas before the zombies start chasing us!"

>a
 I'll drive, you shoot."

 You brace the shotgun against your shoulder and flick the safety off.
 Five shells. Three zombies. You can do this. You've been shooting guns
 since you were a kid.

 Not that you generally shoot deer from the windows of Jeeps screaming
 in circles, though. And the deer aren't generally trying to eat you
 while you do. You feel your palms sweat as the three zombies look away
 from the tree and at the approaching Jeep.

 "Ready?" Bonnie says, and slams on the brakes before you can answer.

 The lurch of the Jeep spoils your aim, and your first shot goes wide.

 The female zombie starts briskly towards the Jeep.

 You raise the gun again and blow her head off. You see the shower of
 brains go up as she falls over.

 One down.

 Bonnie hits the gas hard and you whirl away. "We'll come back for
 another pass," Bonnie says, and only then do you see how close to the
 window the other two zombies got. Both are male--or were, in life. One
 young, one older.

 "Ready?" Bonnie says again, and slams on the brakes.

 Three shells, two zombies. This time, you are ready. You hit the
 younger male on the first try, and are whirling to face the older male
 before the younger body has hit the ground. The older male stumbles
 away, spoiling your aim--your shot goes wide--Bonnie swings the Jeep
 around to give you another pass--

 And you find yourself face-to-face with a grinning, snarling, drooling
 zombie, not more than an arms'-length from your open window.

 You blow its head off.

 It falls over.

 "Nice," Bonnie says, and jumps out and runs over to the tree to get the
 girl you've saved.

 You okay?

 A: . . . no. I stare down at the things that used to be human beings,
 and then I get the car door open just in time to throw up.
 B: More or less okay. That was. . . that was upsetting, but it was
 necessary. I'm glad we saved the girl in the tree.
 C: Hell yeah! That was awesome!

>c
 extremely pale and limp. "This is Jennifer," Bonnie says briefly.
 "Jennifer, Zarah the Zombie Killer." And you are off again.

 "So," you say to Jennifer, "what's your story?"

 "The two guys were my roommate and his son," Jennifer says. "The woman
 was hitchhiking, and I _said_ we shouldn't pick her up, but Bob never
 did think I was worth listening to--he insisted. . . And then we
 stopped because I had to pee, and when I got back from the bushes, all
 of them had zombified. I was right. We shouldn't have picked her up."

 "How long was she in the car with you first?" Bonnie asks sharply.

 "What? I don't know . . . what do you mean?"

 "You know how long it takes for someone to turn, if they're not
 killed," Bonnie says impatiently. "If they're killed, we know it's
 almost immediate, but we don't know exactly how long if you're just bit
 and left alive. . . "

 "I don't know," Jennifer says again. "I wasn't really paying
 attention."

 "Well, ballpark then. An hour? A half hour? Five hours? Five minutes?"

 "I said I don't know!" Jennifer sounds defensive, almost teary.

 Are you going to get involved here?

 A: Yes. Bonnie is obviously coming on too strong. I can get the
 information more gently.
 B: Yes. I don't want my two companions to be at each other's throats,
 and this beginning isn't promising.
 C: Nope. Not my problem.

>a
 and finally Jennifer remembers that it was about fifteen minutes
 between when they picked up the hitchhiker and when the hitchhiker
 started eating her roommate.

 Jennifer seems calmer now, though she has apparently decided to only
 talk to you, not Bonnie. "Where are we going?" she asks.

 You explain about the prison.

 "Oh." She sounds disappointed.

 "Why?"

 "I was hoping we were headed for the interstate. Do you know about Lisa
 Murray?" She waves a smartphone.

 "No," Bonnie says.

 "I've been following the Zombiepocalypse Survivors group on Facebook,"
 Jennifer explains. "There aren't, um, aren't so many of them posting as
 there used to be, but Lisa's still updating her status every couple of
 hours."

 She shows you the smartphone screen. Lisa's status updates are all
 almost the same. "COME GET ME! If you provide transportation to the
 Cedar Junction Correctional Facility, I can keep you safe from zombies
 on the way! I know what I'm talking about--look how long I've stayed
 alive!"

 "I've been messaging with her," Jennifer says. "She's at the transfer
 center off exit 13. Bob said we'd go there first, and then the church.
 . .  I think that's the best plan, but if you want to do something
 else, of course, it's your car, I can't do anything about it. . . "

 Do you want to sidetrack to rescue Lisa?

 A: Yes.
 B: No.

>a
 bad idea--mostly, you get the impression, because she finds Jennifer
 annoying and wants to contradict her.

 What are you going to do?

 A: Let it drop--let Bonnie call the shots.
 B: Make a forceful argument.
 C: Make a logical argument.
 D: Make a deferential argument.

>c
 for in this particular circumstance, all things being equal, prefering
 to take the risks involved in rescuing the student because of the
 advantages her presence might provide, as well as the arguments of
 honor and duty. . .

 Bonnie is distinctly unimpressed, and informs you that you'll be
 continuing on your way to the prison without stopping to rescue the
 student.

 Which gives you some useful information. Long logical arguments aren't
 the way to persuade Bonnie. That may be good to know later, although it
 would have been better to know before now. You hope someone else
 rescues that poor student.

 After a short while, a gas station comes up on your right. Bonnie pulls
 in. "We'd better fuel up while we have the opportunity."

 "I'm hungry," Jennifer says.

 "There's MREs in the box beside you."

 Jennifer makes a face. "No, I mean I want food. I can't eat that weird
 shit. Can't one of you get some real food from the gas station?"

 You wouldn't have thought what was sold at gas stations counted as
 "real food", but apparently Jennifer does. Bonnie looks like she wishes
 she'd left this whiny brat to be eaten by zombies. What do you do?

 A: I offer to get munchies.
 B: I suggest Jennifer go get her own munchies.
 C: I point out to Bonnie that munchies would make the MREs last longer.

>%undo
>c

 You walk into the gas station, in search of munchies.

 And you find--probably you should have expected this--a zombie inside,
 also in search of munchies.

 In fact, the zombie has found munchies.

 The zombie appears to have a kid cornered in the very back of the
 store, between the ice cream cooler and the shelf of
 artifically-flavored-and-colored "potato" chips.

 But the zombie doesn't seem to have actually started munching yet. It
 turns its head as you enter and studies you with interest. You're not
 quite sure why you'd seem like more attractive prey than the cowering
 kid--a girl of about nine or ten--but it's possible that you do. To
 judge by the (sort-of) expression on (what's left of) the zombie's
 face. It sweeps its long hair out of its eyes to look at you better.

 This one seems to have been a teenage girl.

 So what do you do?

 A: Try to save the kid.
 B: Run like hell.

>a

 You have a plan, right?

 A: I'll make a lot of noise and dance around a little, to distract the
 zombie long enough for the kid to run out the door. And then I'll
 figure out how to escape myself.
 B: I'll attack the zombie directly.

>b

 You look around the gas station. You are standing almost in one corner,
 with the counter and cash register behind you. The zombie and its
 potential victim are in the opposite corner. Along the wall to your
 left is a display of frisbees, beachballs, and wiffle balls and bats.
 Past it, in the left-hand corner, is a freezer with bags of ice. Along
 the wall to your right are shelves containing cat food cans,
 condiments, lighters, bags of charcoal, bags of hot dog and hamburger
 buns, and lighter fluid. (On some more relaxed occasion you might pause
 to wonder what the cat food is doing in the cookout display.) Perhaps
 out of fear regarding the lighter fluid, there is a fire extinguisher
 over the shelves. In the middle of the store, more towards your left
 than your right, are some rickety-looking stands holding candy, maps,
 and newspapers.

 Before you can decide quite what to do, the zombie charges across the
 center of the room at you.

 Which way do you run?

 A: Left.
 B: Right.
 C: I jump over the counter.

>b

 What do you grab?

 A: Cat food cans.
 B: The fire extinguisher.
 C: A lighter and the lighter fluid.

>c
 purposefully towards you.

 You swing the lighter fluid container, flinging the liquid inside in a
 long arc through the air. A good healthy splash lands on the zombie,
 which blinks at the liquid in its eyes.

 You swing the container again, pouring lighter fluid on the floor, in a
 straight line between yourself and the zombie.

 Then you flick the lighter on, touch it to the lighter fluid, and jump
 out of the way.

 You don't watch. You don't want to. Instead you stumble towards the
 cowering kid, who still hasn't moved, physically haul her to her feet,
 and drag her with you out the door.

 You're quite a ways down the road before your heart settles down. "You
 should probably put your seatbelt on," you say to the kid. Bonnie
 snorts a little, apparently considering seatbelts to be a wussy
 invention of the modern era.

 "Oh," the kid says. "Yeah." She does.

 "What's your name?" you ask.

 "Kayden."

 "I'm Zarah the Zombie Killer," you say. "Where are your parents,
 Kayden?"

 "Don't know," Kayden says. After a while, she adds, "That was my
 sister, inside."

 "Oh." You can't think of anything else to say.

 "It's okay."

 "Where are we going?" Kayden asks after a while.

 "To a prison," Bonnie says.

 Jennifer makes a little sniffing noise.
