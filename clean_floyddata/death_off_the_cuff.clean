 "I assume you have gathered us here for a reason, Monsieur Saint
 Germain?", says Shane Pearson.

 "Is it not obvious?" says the Doctor. "The detective has figured out
 who killed the Colonel and intends to explain to us how he did it."

 You twirl your moustache. "The good Doctor is correct, Mademoiselle
 Pearson. I have indeed solved the case. The murderer was clever, but
 he proved no match for my gray matter." You tap a finger against the
 side of your head to illustrate the point.

 They all stare at you expectantly, like children waiting to be told a
 bedtime story. And who can blame them? You are, after all, Anthony
 Saint Germain, the great French detective. No criminal has ever been a
 match for you, and everybody is looking forward to a description of
 your brilliant deductions.

 There is just one small problem. One tiny detail that makes it
 different this time. A mere trifle, really. This time you have no idea
 who did it. An entire day of investigation have turned up nothing. No
 one even seems to have a damn motive.

 No matter. Most of the time when you do this the murderer breaks down
 and confesses half way through your speech anyway. All you have to do
 is stall and wait for the guilty party to slip up. People love talking
 about themselves. If you wait long enough, they always end up
 revealing something you can use.

 It is going to be fine.

 First time players should type ABOUT for some basic information about
 the game.

 Death Off the Cuff
 An Interactive Fiction by Simon Christiansen
 Release 1 / Serial number 100926 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Hotel Lounge
 The hotel lounge is small, but comfortable. A large couch stands near
 one wall, with a mahogany couch table in front of it. Next to it is an
 old fashioned reclining chair. In the corner of the room, an old
 grandfather clock is steadily ticking away, lending a dignified air to
 the proceedings.

 James Garfield, the owner of Seafront Hotel, is standing by the clock,
 watching you expectantly.

 Jonathan Allington stands next to Mr. Garfield, his employer. His face
 reveals no emotions.

 Shane Pearson is sitting in the couch with her legs crossed.

 Doctor Elias Mole is sitting next to Shane in the couch, leaning
 forward with an inquisitive look in his eyes.

 Count Heinrich Von Carstein is leaning backwards in the reclining
 chair, sipping a glass of wine.

 Detective Goodfellow is standing behind you, eagerly waiting to assist
 you in arresting the murderer.

>about
 "Death Off the Cuff" is a conversation based game where you need to
 talk about various things to move the plot forward. This is
 accomplished by typing "TALK ABOUT SOMETHING", or simply "T SOMETHING"
 for convenience. "Something" can be anything you can see in the
 environment. You will often have more than one thing to say about the
 same object.

 You can only talk about visible objects, not just arbitrary topics.

 Occasionally, talking about something or someone will bring up a menu
 with various options for what to say. If you don't like any of the
 options, you can simply change the topic by talking about something
 else instead.

 Talking doesn't solve every problem, though. You may also need to
 physically interact with things and people to progress.

 Make sure you examine your surrounding regularly. You might notice new
 things.

 If you get stuck, typing "HINT" or "HELP" will provide a hint on what
 to do in the current situation. There is usually more than one hint
 available for a given scene, so if the first one doesn't help the next
 one might.

 Typing "WALKTHRU" will provide detailed instructions on how to finish
 the game.

 Lastly, I would like thank my testers: Katzy, Brooks Reeves and John
 Murphy.

 "Mr. Garfield did not seem to have any connection to the victim. He
 had been running the hotel by himself since his wife died two years
 ago. Before starting the hotel he was a lieutenant in the british
 army. None of this information seemed to be of any use at first, but
 my investigation was not over."

 "I considered Monsieur Garfield. In the days before the murder several
 witnesses overheard the two men furiously  arguing. Monsieur Garfield
 insists that the Colonel was simply impossible to please. I knew that
 Mr. Garfield had often complained of the stress of running the hotel.
 Was it possible that he had simply snapped during a later argument? It
 seemed almost too simple."

 James sneers. "Of course it is. If you really think I would kill a man
 over a simple disagreement then your reputation has been severely
 exaggerated."

 You nod politely. "As part of my investigation, I consider every
 option, Monsieur."

 "Mr. Garfields alibi seemed to exclude him from the list of possible
 suspects. The Colonel's pocket watch had stopped at 02:30 when he was
 stabbed. Doctor Mole confirmed the time of death.

 At 02:35 James Garfield was awoken by his employee, Mr. Allington, who
 informed him that one of the guests had had a terrible nightmare and
 had requested some medication to help her sleep. It is highly unlikely
 that mister Garfield could have sprinted back to his room after
 commiting the murder, washed off the blood, changed into his pajamas
 and gotten into bed. No, if Mr. Garfield had commited the murder, the
 Doctor was either wrong about the time of death, or Mr. Allington was
 in on it."

 Jonathan Allington raises an eyebrow.

 "I turned my attention to the young Doctor. He was the one who had
 examined John McClaren. According to his examinations, the poor
 Colonel had been first sedated with laudanum in his wine, then stabbed
 three times with a knife. All fingerprints had been wiped from the
 knife after the grisly deed was done. His pocket watch had apparently
 been struck by the knife and had stopped at exactly 02:30. The doctors
 examinations confirmed that time of death could have occured at that
 hour. The Doctor himself had no alibi for the time of the murder."

 German accent seems to have mysteriously disappeared. "It's obvious
 that Mr. Germain has seen through my disguise. I might as well come
 clean."

 With a single smooth movement of his hand, he removes the beard
 revealing the face of a much younger man in his thirties. "My real
 name is Sylvester Starfield. I am an investigative reporter with the
 London Tribune, currently doing a series of articles on the actions of
 the intelligence service during the war. After I realized that the
 Colonel had been working for MI6 during the war, I disguised myself as
 "Count von Carstein" and checked into the seafront hotel to get close

 which he subsequently abandoned."

 "I was not always just a hotel owner. In fact, I changed my name after
 the war to avoid my enemies. My original name was Brian Holmes. During
 the war I worked for MI6 doing Special Ops behind enemy lines. The
 Colonel was in my unit. When he was killed, I feared our enemies had
 finally caught up with us. So, naturally, I armed myself."

 "I had reached a turning point in my investigation," you continue.
 "Not only had the Colonel turned out to be a former secret agent, but
 his colleague was even running the hotel. Mr. Starfields research
 turned up several new avenues of investigation. It seemed likely that
 the Colonel's past had finally caught up with him. Perhaps his German
 nemesis had managed to track him down. Or maybe his illegitimate son
 had decided to seek revenge for being abandoned. I continued my

 "I knew the Doctor was not a hardened murderer. Once he realized I
 knew everything, he would no doubt break down and confess. As you can
 all plainly see, my predictions proved true. Detective, take him
 away."

 As the Doctor is handcuffed, he looks at you with uncomprehending
 eyes. "Wait... No... That's not what I meant. I am not a murderer."

 You send him a comforting smile. "It's okay, Doctor. It's all over
 now. A physical prison will no doubt be an improvement on the prison
 of guilt you had build for yourself."

 There is no real evidence, so the Doctor is soon released. Everyone
 believes he is guilty, though. After all, who would doubt the word of

 he is found hanging from the roof of his house.

 You slap him hard across the face. "Snap out of it, Doctor. We need

 The Doctor blinks, as if he had just woken up from a bad dream.
 "Right... I am sorry. It's obvious that you have found me out,
 Monsieur Germain," he sighs. "I covered for Mrs. Pearson because I
 couldn't bear the thought that her talent would waste away in jail."

 "I know," you say. "You'll better tell the whole story, Doctor. For
 your own sake."

 He nods. "At midnight I was awoken by a noise in the hallway. When I
 peered out I saw Mrs. Pearson running down the hallway as if the devil
 himself was chasing her. I went downstairs to see what she might have
 been running from, and a terrible sight awaited me. The Colonel was
 lying on the floor with a bloody knife planted in his chest. Perhaps
 my mind was still clouded from tiredness, but I decided to cover for
 her. I wiped all the fingerprints off the knife, and when I was later
 made to examine the body I lied and said that he had been sedated with
 opium. I figured that would throw the police off the tracks."

 You nod. "I had quickly deduced that the opium story made no sense.
 Why would anyone sedate someone only to stab him right afterwards?
 Once I realised this, I knew that the Doctor had lied."

 "I suppose you have already figured out the rest," says the Doctor.
 "The drug in the Colonel's body was not opium. It was cyanide. The
 poison would have killed him anyway, even without the knife."

 "Indeed, and that realisation changed everything. If the Colonel had
 been poisoned with a lethal poison, then the stabbing was clearly a
 red herring. But how? And why?"

 "The case was starting to unravel. The Doctor had seen Shane Pearson
 run from the scene of the crime around the time of the murder.
 However, Mr. Allington claimed that Mrs. Pearson was fast asleep at
 that time."

 "Just stop, Monsieur Germain," says Shane Pearson. "You don't have to
 say any more. It was foolish of me to try to hide the truth in the
 first place. I should have known that no one can hide anything from
 you.

 I did go down to the library at around midnight because I couldn't
 sleep. All of sudden the Colonel came running towards me from behind
 one of the shelves. I grapped a knife from one of the tables and held
 it in front of me, telling him to keep away. He just kept coming until
 he impaled himself on the knife and fell to the ground. It was
 horrible. I panicked and ran back to my bedroom. Some time later, I
 was awoken by Jonathan who told me I had been having a nightmare.
 Luckily, time of death was for some reason estimated to the time
 Jonathan woke me up so I had an alibi. I know I should have come clean
 sooner, but I just wasn't thinking straight."

 to keep our relationship private until we got married, but that idea
 doesn't seem realistic any more."

 "It is obvious that you have figured it out, Mr. Germain," says
 Jonathan. "I tried to help my fiancee by giving her an alibi. It was
 foolish thing to do. At around midnight, I heard Shane walk down the
 stairs and followed her down to the library where I saw what happened.
 She was clearly blameless - the Colonel had attacked her - but I
 couldn't take the chance that the police might not believe her. I
 found the Colonel's watch in his pocket and set it to 02:30. Then I
 took the knife and stabbed him several times myself, making sure I hit
 the watch so it would stop. I felt dirty afterwards, so I scrubbed my
 hands until they started bleeding. Afterwards, I made sure Shane would
 have an alibi for 02:30 AM by waking her up by then and then telling
 James about it. I made sure to make a lot of noise so plenty of people

 under surveillance until I finally got my chance.

 About half an hour before midnight, Colonel McClaren came down to get
 a drink. I approached him, claiming to be a recent arrival to the
 hotel. He did not recognize me and we struck up a conversation. I
 procured some wine, slipping the cyanide into the Colonel's glass
 while he wasn't watching. After he had drunk the wine, I made an
 excuse to leave and hid outside the window so I could watch him die.
 After a few minutes the American girl came down to the library as
 well. By that time, the Colonel must have started to feel the effects
 of the poison because he staggered towards her, desperately seeking
 assistance. The girl misinterpreted his approach as an attack; the
 rest you know."

 His eyes widen. "You damned frog. What have you done with my gun?" He
 furiously examines the gun, trying to determine how it might have been
 sabotaged.

>take gun
 While Franz is distracted, you deftly grab the gun from his hands. He
 lunges at you, but is quickly overpowered by the other inhabitants of
 the hotel.

 "I am going to kill you for this, detective," he shouts while being
 restrained by his own handcuffs. "You are only putting off the
 inevitable."

 "I suspect I will be dead long before you get out of jail, Monsieur,"
 you reply. "Mr. Holmes," you say to the man formerly known as James
 Garfield, "Would you be so kind as to call the real Scotland Yard? I
 think they will be delighted to hear that we have managed to arrest
 the murderer without their help."

 tadsr - A text-only TADS 2.5.10 Interpreter.
 Copyright (c) 1993, 2006 by Michael J. Roberts.

    The mystery, for you, started two years ago.
    "Come here, there's something I want to tell you," your old
 grandfather had said, "Quick, before your mother comes back in the
 room."
    The smell of antiseptic and an unidentifiable odor that seemed to
 emanate from the very walls of the old age home made you uncomfortable
 enough.  The thought of your grandfather having a secret he wanted to
 share only made that unplanned visit to the Shady Pastures
 Convalescent Home all the more nerve-wracking.
    "If you have any mind for it, go back to Dalton.  Your Grandmother
 left something she wanted you to have."  Before you could ask him
 specifics, he turned away as your Mom reentered the room with a bottle
 of water.  The topic would not come up again, which was fine by you.
 No one in your family had been to the Dalton property since your
 grandmother died over eight years ago, and as far as you knew, the
 place could have burned down by now.
    When you thought back to your childhood, you could remember
 spending the summers with your grandmother at the old house in Dalton,
 located on the Texas Gulf Coast.  Grandma Eleanor Sorich always had
 smiles for you, and made you feel that she understood you better than
 you did yourself.  When she eventually passed away, you were deeply
 saddened, as if you had lost one of your best friends.
    Grandpa Sorich, on the other hand, was a different story.  A bitter
 man who spent most of the time during your visits off by the Dalton
 Harbor with his drinking buddies.  As far as you could tell, their
 marriage was more of convenience than love.  At her funeral, he showed
 only the faintest hint of remorse.  He spent the years after her death
 mostly silent in an old age home...  until that visit.
    It's been two years since your chat with Grandpa.  In that time,
 you have often reflected back on the conversation, curious as to what
 would make your grandfather act in such a mysterious fashion, and
 curious about what your grandmother could've possibly wanted you to
 have.
    Finally, an unexpected road trip across the country has allowed you
 to make a brief detour at the old family property.  You find yourself
 back in the draining heat of Dalton, Texas, assessing the old Sorich
 property your family all but abandoned years ago.  It hasn't burned
 down, but indeed stood patiently waiting for someone to return.  The
 house, like your grandfather, has not aged gracefully, and looks as if
 it too is just waiting out the rest of it's years....

 Front of House
    You stand before the small coast house where you used to go on
 summer vacations with your parents when you were young.  A weathered
 fence which has long since given up it's white paint to hot Texas sun
 and salty coastal air surrounds the property.  To the east lies Beach
 Street, as old as the town itself, separating the property from harbor
 and the bay.  Across the road to the east you can make out the remains
 of the Dalton Fishing Pier and Dalton Harbor.  The old house itself is
 to the west, facing the water like it has for the last 100 years.
 Though you are shin deep in weeds, you can make out a small path that
 winds around the house to the northwest and southwest.  Crumbling
 cement stairs lead up to the porch of the house.

>examine fence
 From what you remember, this old fence has been re-built several times
 over the lifetime of the house.  The last time it was restored was
 around 1980.  The fence extends for a ways north and south.

>inventory
 You have an old house key.

>examine me
 All things considered, you're not doing too badly considering the long
 bus trip you took to get here and how hot it currently is.

>examine key
 The key to the coast house, given to you by your grandfather ages ago.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>look n

>go west
 Front Porch
    The deck of this house seems to be of newer construction than the
 rest.  As a younger child you remember sitting on the deck chairs and
 telling ghost stories long into the night while watching the boats
 sway in the harbor.  A deteriorating plastic lawn chair remains as a
 reminder of those days.  The sliding glass door to enter the house is
 to the west.

>about
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>sit
 (the plastic lawn chair)
 You sit down in the old chair.  You're not sure it likes your weight
 having been left stranded in the elements for the last ten years, but
 it supports you. You look out across the yard towards the water.  The
 view of the boats docked in the harbor moving rocking softly in the
 breeze is breathtaking.
 Okay, you're now sitting on the plastic lawn chair.

>examine boats
 Off in the distance you can make out some shrimp boats tied-off to a
 dock.  They gradually sway in the calm harbor.  Beyond that is a small
 bay that opens into the Gulf of Mexico.

>rock
 You rock back and forth on your heels.  You consider putting 'yer
 thumb in 'yer britches and yelling `Yeehaw!'

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer in the plastic lawn chair.

>examine door
 The sliding glass door of your grandparents house has been shut for
 the last ten years since your grandmother passed away.  Years of rain,
 humidity, dust, and wind-blown dirt have caked the outside of the
 door, making it difficult to see inside.  The door is warm to the
 touch, much like everything else here.  There is a small keylock close
 to the top.

>yell
 Your throat is a bit sore now.

>examine lock
 The lock is quite small and rusty, obviously having weathered the
 elements since anyone last put anything into it ten years ago.

>open door
 It's locked.

>umlock door
 I don't know the word "umlock".

>um, unlock door
 I don't know the word "um".

>unlock door
 The key fits into the rusty slot with some difficulty but after a few
 grunts and some tasteful profanity, the lock gives way.  The door is
 now unlocked.

>in
 You can't go that way.

>go west
 You'll have to open the sliding glass door first.

>open door
 The door gives quite a fight, but you pull hard on the handle opening
 the door. As the glass door slides open, a burst of stale hot air
 trapped in the house for the last decade rushes past you.  You're
 momentarily overwhelmed with scents of mold, mothballs and your
 grandmother's old perfume.  A quick wind robs you of her memory.

>go west
 Den
    Standing in this room conjures shadows of your summer vacations as
 a youth.  A giant air conditioner is mounted into the north wall, next
 to a small utility closet.  In the opposite corner there is a small
 television with a rocking chair facing it.  The kitchen is to the
 west, the sliding glass door to the porch is east.  The musty hot air
 in this room makes it difficult to breathe.
    Oh man..  it is hot in here!

>undress
 I don't know the word "undress".

>turn on air conditioner
 Nothing happens.  The AC is as silent as ever.  It's mocking silence
 makes you feel even hotter.
    I'm not joking..  it is seriously hot in this house.  You are
 suddenly dripping with sweat and feeling a bit woozy.

>go west
 Kitchen
    Small kitchen..  It has tacky furnishings from the 1950s to
 mid-70's.  A grease-stained refrigerator takes up what little walking
 space there actually is.
    You see a calendar here.
    You can't take it anymore.  The heat in the house is horrible even
 for Texas standards.  You bolt out the door.

 Ah, they don't make them like they used to.  This giant wall-mounted
 hulk of an air conditioner had the prime responsibility of cooling
 down the entire house.  You remember your uncles always fretting that
 it was going to give out at any moment and then the house would be
 doomed.  Standing now in the sweltering heat of the abandoned house
 you can appreciate why they were so worried!

 Front of House

>go east
 Beach Road..  in front of house
    Unevenly paved, Beach Road separates your house from the small
 harbor and pier to the east.  A light coat of sand blows across the
 pavement in lazy swirls.  Beach road doesn't see much traffic.  The
 old family house lies to the west.  The road continues up a small hill
 to the north and down towards the edge of town to the south.  To the
 east a small service road heads towards an old fishing pier.

>go east
 Entrance to Fishing Pier
    When you were a youngster, you remember this pier being a lot
 longer, but that was two hurricanes ago.  Mother Nature has taken the
 pier and had her way with it.  The pier extends out into the water but
 the wood is broken and splintered farther out stopping well short of
 it's original length.  A second, inaccessible section of the pier is
 visible even farther out; the area that connected the two having been
 washed away.
    On this side of the pier, only one guardrail remains, the other
 lost to the elements.  Choppy water splashes against the few remaining
 supports beneath the pier sending plumes of water shooting up through
 the planks.  The constant splashes has made the planks of the pier
 mossy and slick.  A sign nearby advised that the pier is closed until
 storm damage can be repaired.  What remains of the pier extends to the
 east.  The service road leads away to the west.

>JUMP
 Wheeee!

>jump over gap
 I don't know the word "gap".

>go east
    Ignoring the warnings, you boldly start down the pier...

    The waves splash around you shooting up through the planks, the
 foamy spray offering temporary relief from the Texas heat.  You pause
 gripping the remaining guardrail with your hands and the planks with
 your toes.  With this cat like grip, you slowly inch your way to the
 end of the pier.

 End of Fishing Pier
    You're at the end of the pier, well, what now acts as the end of
 the pier.  You can see the original end of the pier off like a small
 platform about 20 yards out to the east.  From here, you can make out
 that there is some large object wedged within its supports.
    Beneath you, the planks end suddenly where they were ripped from
 the supports.  The warm water of the bay is just eight feet below you.
 The waves roll by you as if they were on some perpetual northern
 pilgrimage.
    The wind blows in from the south whipping your hair and putting a
 salty taste in your mouth.

>go down

    You put down all your stuff, take a deep breath, pinch your nose
 shut and....
    Splash!
    The coastal waters envelop you.  The taste of the salty water makes
 you grimace, not to mention the stinging effect it has on your eyes!
 Instinctively you start kicking towards the surface where you start
 gasp for air.  Did I forget to mention earlier that you're not the
 strongest swimmer?
    You dog paddle for a while, but it takes so much energy just to
 stay afloat. Panic slowly rises as you begin remember reading stories
 about how drowning is considered one of the more gruesome ways to
 expire.  You flail your arms ineffectually, your weight pulling you
 down...  when you realize that water here is only about four feet
 deep.  You quickly realize that it gets deeper towards the east and
 instead of pressing your luck you manage to work your way back to
 shore.  It takes a while but you eventually manage to find a good spot
 to berth yourself.

 Boat Ramp
    A small driveway descends into the murky green water of the Texas
 Gulf.  Above the land, scores of black bugs scurry out of your way
 disappearing into crevices you didn't even notice.  In the shallow
 part of the water you can see the ghostly images of small fish and
 crabs darting just under the surface.  Several tires are securely
 fastened against the ramp wall to prevent boats from bumping against
 the breakwater.
    You see a pair of white fishing boots here.

>examine boots
 These old wading boots are so old and sunbleached they're almost
 brittle.  If you distrusted your fashion sensibilities enough to put
 them on they would come up to your mid-thigh.  If boots could talk, no
 doubt this pair would have some good fishing stories.

>get them
 pair of white fishing boots:  Taken.

>go east
 Having just spent the better part of the afternoon struggling to get
 to shore, the thought of going back through boat oil, crabs and
 jellyfish just makes you cringe.

>wear boots
 Okay, you're now wearing the pair of white fishing boots.

 Partially submerged in the salty water, the tires are mostly covered

 fungus or two.  They are hung to protect boats from bumping the ramp
 wall.

>go west
 Beach Road..  near the boatramp
    In addition to the usual weeds and sand, this section of Beach Road
 has a few road-kill crabs squished into the pavement.  A small boat
 ramp lies to the east.  The road continues north and south.

>go north
 Beach Road..  near the harbor
    The Texas heat seems to bounce right off of Beach Road.  Dry
 withered weeds line the sides of the street.  To the east you see the
 entrance to the harbor.  To the north and south lie more sandy road.

>go east
 Harbor
    You remember stories your grandfather would tell you about Dalton
 Harbor back in his day - the shrimp industry supported the town and
 boats could be seen leaving early in the morning with seagulls
 circling closely overhead as their nets were drawn up.  Now, however,
 one would uses the term harbor loosely when viewing this small dock.
 Today's harbor is nothing more than a couple of rotted wooden poles
 being used to tie old shrimp boats against.  The shrimp boats hardly
 look seaworthy with their hulls scraped and their nets faded and
 tattered.  A small A-shaped sign offers tourist bargains.
    A fisherman is sitting on an old bucket near a sink de-veining
 shrimp.
    The fisherman notices you as you walk up the harbor.  `You must be
 one of Eleanor Sorich's kin.  You look just like her.'

>talk to fisherman
 I don't know the word "talk".

>yes
 I don't know the word "yes".

>fisherman, hello
 The fisherman doesn't appear interested.
    The fisherman continues to slice through the backs of shrimp
 flinging the offal into the water where it's quickly snarfed by
 hardheads.

>sit
 What do you want to sit on?

>examine fisherman
 The old leathery fisherman is wearing rubber boots and an old flannel
 shirt covered in old fish-gut stains.  His hands are hard and
 calloused and his hair is bleached and thin.  He has the haggard look
 of a man who has gotten up every morning at 4:30 A.M.  for the last 45
 years.
    The fisherman pauses, wipes sweat from his lined forehead, sighs
 heavily, and resumes carving the shrimp.

>examine shrimp
 Pink and veiny, just the way you like them.
    `Squall of '67 blew down the whole town,' mumbles the fisherman.

>examine shirt
 I don't know the word "shirt".

>ask fisherman about shrimp
    `Lifeblood of the town...  and tasty too!'The fisherman glances
 your way, `Nice boots,' he comments with a trace of sarcasm.

    `A good pair of waders is a fisherman's best friend.  Most of the
 local boys have a pair.'
 `Damn, it's hot!'

>ask fisherman about weather
 The old fence isn't important.
    `The sea buries her secrets,' mumbles the fisherman.

>ask fisherman about sea

    The fisherman mumbles something about a north wind blowing through.

>ask fisherman about wind

    You certainly seem to be on the road less traveled now.  You can
 see small town of Dalton off in the distance to the north.  A heat
 mirage bubbles up from the road to the south.  An equally small and
 lonely road trails off towards the old cemetery to the west.

>go west
 Cemetery Gates
    The humidity and the gray sky make the already ominous pair of old
 rusty gates appear even creepier.  The town's founding fathers, what's
 left of them anyhow, as well as quite a few of your own ancestor's lie
 beyond the gates to the west.  There is a historical marker here.  The
 cemetery lies beyond the gates to the west, the road back to the town
 is east.

>examine marker
 The historical marker stands firmly planted into the ground with
 etched out lettering holding up surprisingly rust-free.

>read marker
 `The Dalton cemetery has provided a comforting resting place for the
 towns citizens for over a century.  The oldest marked grave is that of
 Helen McHenry (d.1819), the only child of Port Dietrich resident
 Lionel McHenry.  Dalton co-founder Col.  Clyde Dalton also rests here.
 Col.  Clyde Dalton is credited for, amongst other things, the Dalton
 Mansion, the Dalton Library, and the Dalton Firehouse.  He was entered
 into the cemetery in 1949.
    A large number of burials occurred in 1918 from a wide-spread
 Influenza Epidemic.  The Dalton Cemetery contains graves of the
 veterans of the Texas Revolution, Civil War, World War I, World War
 II, Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf War.  The Dalton Estates Association
 maintains the cemetery.'

 You'll have to open the old rusty gates first.

 Inside Cemetery
    The Dalton Cemetery is one of the oldest fixtures of the town.  To
 the right of the path, you can see the cement mausoleum of the Dalton
 brothers.  From the looks of it, it has not been cleared of its weeds
 in some time.  You look around at some of the other stones, some
 buried by the grass, some with dying flowers, and a few with small
 American Flags hanging limply in the heat, providing just enough shade
 for a few noisy crickets.  A path leads deeper into the cemetery
 towards the west.  An old rusty gate is to the east.

>examine mausoleum
 For as wealthy as the Dalton's were, their tomb is not overly
 spectacular.  Based on it's overgrown appearance, you guess that the
 Daltons don't get many visitors.  If it weren't for the names and
 dates carved into it's doors, it could pass for a large cement
 toolshed.

>go west
 Deep Inside Cemetery
    It would seem the deeper you travel into the cemetery, the less
 maintained the graves become.  Your eyes are drawn to a particular set
 of graves before you.  Two headstones stand before two graves - one of
 which covered by a large stone grave cover.  On the left lies your
 grandmother, and on the right the place where your grandfather will
 eventually be buried.  Your grandmother's grave cover, mostly
 concealed beneath sand and weeds, seems to be suffering in the humid
 climate.

>examine cover
 Some accident has caused the grave cover to break down the center!  A
 crevice runs about 7 inches across and nearly a foot long down the
 cover breaching the sanctuary of your ancestor's earthly remains.  The
 entire slab seems to be slowly collapsing into the grave.  You suspect
 it's just a matter of time before the entire slab collapses down upon
 your grandmother!

>examine headstones
 I don't know the word "headstones".

>examine headstone
 Which headstone do you mean, Grandpa's headstone, or Grandma's
 headstone?

>examine grandma's headstone
 Grandma's headstone..  chipped with age...

>examine grandpa's headstone
 Your grandfather's headstone was bought at the same time that your
 grandmother passed away.  As your grandfather is still alive, it waits
 patiently for the inevitable.

 modest houses that make up Dalton, the old harbor, fishing pier, and
 the Gulf of Mexico stretching out beneath gray clouds to the east.
 The road travels off some distance to the north, with not a whole lot
 between where you stand and Houston some 300 miles away.  To the west
 lies a small driveway leading towards the largest house in Dalton.

 Outside Dalton Mansion
    While not necessarily a mansion by modern standards, the structure
 was one of the first houses in the area to have such modern
 conveniences as indoor plumbing.  The two-story house is freshly
 painted - a stark contrast to the rest of the dwellings in the area.
 The front door has a brass placard and there is a small stone memorial
 nearby.  The path back to the road is off to the east.

>examine memorial
 The simple stone memorial has an old picture of Col.  Clyde Dalton
 along with a colorful biography.

>read memorial
 `The house on this property was built by town co-founder Col.  Clyde
 Beauregard Dalton in 1933.  Clyde Dalton was born in 1898, the second
 of two children from Beauregard and Esther Lynn Dalton, wealthy cattle
 ranchers from Lubbock, Texas. Clyde and his brother, Claude, came to
 what was then known as Port Dietrich in 1922.  From an inheritance
 left by their parents, Claude opened a meat-packing plant while Clyde
 began investing money to local businesses.  The meat-packing plant and
 the businesses funded by Clyde helped the growth of Port Dietrich.  In
 1925, the increasing port population and growth of the economy,
 despite nationwide depression, made Port Dietrich eligible for "town"
 status.  With considerable influence from the Dalton brothers, Port
 Dietrich was renamed "Dalton."  Claude left the Dalton estate in 1930.
 Clyde Dalton, an influential Board member and businessman himself,
 remained.  Clyde Dalton passed in 1949 and is buried in Dalton
 Cemetery.'

 and salty coastal air surrounds the property.  To the east lies Beach
 Street, as old as the town itself, separating the property from harbor
 and the bay.  Across the road to the east you can make out the remains
 of the Dalton Fishing Pier and Dalton Harbor.  The old house itself is
 to the west, facing the water like it has for the last 100 years.
 Though you are shin deep in weeds, you can make out a small path that
 winds around the house to the northwest and southwest.  Crumbling
 cement stairs lead up to the porch of the house.

>go northwest
 Really swampy side of house
    You stand shin deep in weeds and ankle deep in mud.  A small trail
 towards the old boat shed goes off to the north, and the small path
 that circles the house continues to the southeast and southwest.

>go north
 Swampy path
    The ground squishes beneath your feet as you walk the old path to
 the boatshed.  The air swarms around you as the mosquitoes grow
 thicker with each step through the tall grass.  To the south you can
 see the path back to the old house.  Between you and the boat shed
 visible to the west lies a great puddle which seems to be the mosquito
 breeding grounds.

>go west
 The mosquitoes feverishly attempt to use your legs for their blood
 feast, but the old rubber boots protect you.  Waving your hand in
 front of you to keep them from roosting on your face, you continue
 across the path.


 Woohoo!  Your score has increased.

 Outside Boatshed
    You're standing outside the boatshed.  The overgrown weeds and sand
 build up around the large corrugated sliding door indicate that the
 door hasn't been opened in some time.  A nasty looking puddle breeding
 mosquitoes lies in the middle of the path to the east.

>open door
 It's locked.

>unlock door with key
 I don't see any key here.

>inventory
 You have a pair of white fishing boots (being worn).

 The door is large enough to accommodate the passage of a small boat,
 which is indeed what used to be stored in the boatshed.  There is a
 small keyhole in the boatshed door.

 Kinda swampy side of house
    You stand shin deep in weeds and ankle deep in mud with the back
 porch of the old house to the east.  The screen door to the old back
 porch sways noisily on rusted hinges.  The small path that circles the
 house towards the northeast and southeast.

>go east
 Back porch
    You are in the back porch of the house.  It stinks like dead
 animal, though you cannot see any nearby.  A small metal box about the
 size of a shoebox is affixed to the wall of the house.

>smell
 I don't know the word "smell".

>examine box
 On the cover of the box is imprinted `TX Gulf Coast Power'.  It's

 You turn on the panel.  A couple of quick sparks and a pop startle
 you, but then you hear a faint reassuring hum.
 Somewhere off in the distance, you hear hear tired machinery
 reluctantly coming to life.
 Okay, it's now turned on.

    Standing in this room conjures shadows of your summer vacations as

 You grab the handle and tug the door shut.

 An old rocking chair with a small foamy cushion for marginal comfort.

>sit

 Okay, you're now sitting on the rocking chair.

>examine television
 The evenings from your childhood summers that didn't take place
 sitting on the porch took place watching this television.  As the
 nearest broadcasting station was 60 miles away station the images were
 usually just scratchy ghosts.  The TV has long gone silent and can now
 basically be considered merely a bulky paperweight with fake wooden
 paneling.

 Hallway
    You are in a cramped hallway.  There are several framed photos on
 the wall some of whom you recognize as family members with the others
 being too old for you to remember.  The kitchen is to the east with
 other rooms lying to the north and south.  The door to the back porch
 is to the west.
    You see the first photograph, the second photograph, the third
 photograph, and the fourth photograph here.

>examine first
 The first photograph is of your grandfather and seems to have been
 taken prior to him going off to World War II.  Your Grandfather is
 standing tall in his new Army uniform, you guess he's no more than
 seventeen years old.  His face is beaming with youthful pride and
 excitement but with an underlying nervousness.  Behind him is the old
 house that once stood on this property.

>examine old house
 I don't see any old house here.

>examine second
 Another photograph of your young Grandfather in his army uniform, this
 time with your Grandmother at his side.  She has short hair in this
 photo with no signs of aging.  You briefly pause to appreciate the odd
 sensation of looking at pictures of persons long deceased who look
 younger and healthier than yourself.

>examine third
 Your Grandmother, with longer hair, with her arms around several other
 girls at the beach.  One of them you think is your aunt based on the
 strong family resemblance, but you can't be sure.  The photographer's
 shadow has snuck into the bottom of the picture; a man wearing a
 cowboy hat.

>examine fourth
 Your Grandfather, older now..  obviously taken after the War, is
 standing next to your Grandmother holding their first child - your
 mother Gwen Sorich.  Your Grandfather has a beard in this photo and
 early streaks of gray.  His eyes are not as exuberant as in the first
 photo, he looks guarded and weary.  Your Grandmother is looking away
 while your Grandfather looks straight at the camera.  Your Mom looks
 as goofy as ever.

 The Small Room
    This tiny room contains little more than a commode and a sink, the
 less glamorous side of the house.  The bathtub had been removed years
 ago leaving only a small, unfinished space.

 The bowl of the sink long ago gave up it's white brilliance to rusty
 calcium deposits.

>turn on sink
 The sink isn't important.

>examine commode
 Why do people feel compelled to look into toilets?  What were you
 really hoping to find?  Let's just say that after ten years of
 non-use, the toilet has dark calcium stains from the stagnant coastal
 water collected at the bottom of the bowl.

 Grandparent's Room
    You are in your grandparents old room.  There is an antique bed
 along the south wall dressed with cheap sheets and pillows.  A
 sun-stained small carpet covers the floor in the center.  Along the
 east wall there is a wooden dresser and a matching nightstand.
    Sitting on the nightstand is a photo of Grandma.

>examine photo
 This was the last picture taken of your grandmother.  She is sitting
 alone on the cement stairs at the front of the house looking quite
 frail.  Her tired smile and weary look makes you think she must have
 known she didn't have much time left.  You notice she's wearing an
 ornate silver locket that you had never noticed her wearing during
 your visits together.

>examine carpet
 The rug is multi-colored with circular patterns that would look tacky
 anywhere but a coast house owned by your grandparents.

>look under rug
 The sun-stained carpet isn't important.

>examine bed
 This ornate bed seems to date back from early in the 20th century.  It
 smells faintly of mothballs and has generations of drool stains on
 it's sheets.  (At least you hope that's drool...)

    The fisherman mumbles something about a north wind blowing through.

>show cap to fisherman
    The fisherman looks at the hat long and hard for a moment before
 speaking, this time quite clearly.  `I never really expected to see
 that hat again.  I loaned it to your grandfather the last time we went
 out fishing together.  Your grandfather and I were once very, very
 close friends.  The old coot in his youth was one of the nicest,
 friendliest guys you could know.  Everything changed after we got back
 from the war.  He pulled away from us all for years.  Only in the last
 few years of your grandmother's life did he seem to open up again to
 us.  This hat goes back to the days of our friendship, if it's all the
 same to you, I'd like it when you're done - if it's no trouble.'
    The fisherman continues to slice through the backs of shrimp
 flinging the offal into the water where it's quickly snarfed by
 hardheads.

>ask fisherman about grandfather
    `George Sorich and I grew up practically brothers.  Both of us had
 to work on the harbor emptying nets, neither of our parents could
 afford to hire much help.  South was much different then.  He was a
 good mam, but got too stubborn for his own good.  Dwelled too much on
 the past - wasn't was good for him.'
    The fisherman pauses, wipes sweat from his lined forehead, sighs
 heavily, and resumes carving the shrimp.

>ask fisherman about grandmother
    `Lovely woman she was, and made the best fried shrimp y'ever had as
 well!  Probably the sweetest woman I ever met.  Having her husband
 away during the war was hard on her, Hell, on everyone!'
    `Squall of '67 blew down the whole town,' mumbles the fisherman.

>give cap to fisherman
 McHugh looks sentimental as he takes the hat.  He admires it closely
 and then says, `You know, I believe I have something for you too.  Are
 you going to be in town for awhile?  Yes?  Well, then, I'll be back in
 a hour or so with something you may find interesting.  I'll know where
 to find you.'  With that thought, the fisherman grabs his belongings

    The coastal waters envelop you.  The taste of the salty water makes
 you grimace, not to mention the stinging effect it has on your eyes!
 Instinctively you start kicking towards the surface where you start
 gasp for air.  Did I forget to mention earlier that you're not the
 strongest swimmer?
    You felt ridiculous putting them on, but now the water wings are
 paying off. Their buoyancy gives you the extra boost you need to
 dog-paddle towards the lost section of pier.

 Under the Lost Pier
    You are now bobbing in the Gulf's rolling long swells; your patched
 Sammy the Seal wings helping you to stay afloat.  Above you is the
 remains of the original end of the pier supported by old wooden poles
 covered with barnacles and starfish.  Wedged into the supports is the
 wreckage of a small fishing boat.  It must have blown into the pier
 during the last storm.  The shoreline is visible to the west.

>examine boat
 Only a small portion of the bow remains above water.  While you're not
 a boating expert, you would guess that the boat is about 19-feet long,
 give or take a few inches now missing from it's hull.  Most of the

 crabs darting just under the surface.  Several tires are securely

 Today's harbor is nothing more than a couple of rotted wooden poles
 being used to tie old shrimp boats against.  The shrimp boats hardly
 look seaworthy with their hulls scraped and their nets faded and
 tattered.  A small A-shaped sign offers tourist bargains.

>examine poles
 I don't see any poles here.

>examine boats
 I don't see any boats here.

>examine boat

>examine sign
 The sign seems to be hand-painted, and badly at that.  Guessing by the
 amount of wear and seagull guano around it's edges, one could probably
 call it authentic...  or junk..  or both.

    You stand before the small coast house where you used to go on
 summer vacations with your parents when you were young.  A weathered
 fence which has long since given up it's white paint to hot Texas sun
 and salty coastal air surrounds the property.  To the east lies Beach
 Street, as old as the town itself, separating the property from harbor
 and the bay.  Across the road to the east you can make out the remains
 of the Dalton Fishing Pier and Dalton Harbor.  The old house itself is
 to the west, facing the water like it has for the last 100 years.
 Though you are shin deep in weeds, you can make out a small path that

 HOW TO PLAY


 In an adventure game, you play by typing commands that describe what
 you want to do.  Unfortunately, the game isn't as smart as you are, so
 it can't understand nearly as many sentences as a person could.
 You'll type things like the following:

    GO NORTH
    NORTH
    N
    UP
    TAKE THE BOX
    PUT THE FLOPPY DISK INTO THE BOX
    REPAIR THE LAMP WITH THE GLUE
    CLOSE BOX
    LOOK AT DISK
    TAKE DISK OUT OF BOX
    LOOK IN BOX
    WEAR THE CONICAL HAT
    TAKE OFF HAT
    CLOSE BOX
    TURN ON THE LANTERN
    RING BELL
    PUSH BUTTON
    TURN KNOB
    EAT COOKIE
    DRINK MILK
    READ NEWSPAPER
    LOOK THROUGH WINDOW
    UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY
    CLIMB UP THE LADDER
    TURN THE KNOB
    JUMP
    GET IN THE CAR
    GET OUT OF THE CAR
    GET ON THE HORSE
    GIVE WAND TO WIZARD
    ASK WIZARD ABOUT WAND
    SHOW SWORD TO WIZARD


 OTHER CHARACTERS

 You may encounter other characters in the game.  You can interact in
 certain ways with these characters.  For example, you can GIVE things
 to them, SHOW things to them and even attack them (although this is a
 non-violent game, so you shouldn't expect to solve any of your
 problems this way).  In addition, you can ask characters about things:

    ASK WIZARD ABOUT WAND



 SPECIAL COMMANDS

 The game understands several special commands that you can use to
 control the game.  You can use these commands at any prompt.

 AGAIN or G:  Repeats your last command.  If your last input line was
 composed of several commands, only the last command on the line is
 repeated.

 CREDITS:  Show a list of the people that developed this game.

 INVENTORY or I:  Shows the list of items you are carrying.

 LOOK or L:  Shows the full description of your location.

 NOTIFY:  Tells the game whether you want to be notified of score
 changes when they happen.  When the game starts, NOTIFY is turned on,
 so you will see a message whenever you do something that changes your
 score.  If you'd prefer not to see these messages, type NOTIFY.  (If
 you later change your mind, typing NOTIFY again will turn notification
 back on.)

 OOPS:  Allows you to correct the spelling of a word in the last
 command.  You can use OOPS when the game displays this complaint:  "I
 don't know the word ."  Immediately after this message, you can type
 OOPS followed by the corrected spelling of the misspelled word.  You
 can only type one word after OOPS, so this command doesn't allow you
 to correct certain types of errors, such as when you run two words
 together without a spce.

 QUIT:  Stops the game, and returns you to your operating system.

 RESTART:  Starts the game over from the beginning.

 RESTORE:  Restores a position previously saved with the SAVE command.

 SAVE:  Stores the current state of the game in a disk file, so that
 you can come back to the same place later (with the RESTORE command).

 SCORE:  Shows you your current score, the maximum possible score, and
 the number of turns you have taken so far.

 SCRIPT:  Starts writing everything you see on the screen (your
 commands and the game's responses) to a disk file.  The game will ask
 you for a filename to be used for the transcript; you should select a
 filename that does not yet exist on your disk, because if you use an
 existing filename, data in the file will be destroyed.  Use the
 UNSCRIPT command to stop making the transcript.

 TERSE:  Tells the game that you wish to see only short descriptions of
 locations you have already seen when you enter them.  This is the
 default mode. See also the VERBOSE command.

 UNDO:  Take back the last command.  This can be used multiple times to
 take back a series of commands in sequence.  The number of commands
 that you can undo at any given time varies, but you can generally undo
 over a hundred commands.

 UNSCRIPT:  Turns off the transcript being made with the SCRIPT
 command.

 VERBOSE:  Tells the game to show you the full description of every
 location you enter, whether or not you have seen the description
 before.  By default, the game will show you the full description of a
 location only when you first enter it, and will show you the short
 description each time you enter the location thereafter.  Of course,
 you can get a full description at any time by typing LOOK.  See also
 the TERSE command.

 VERSION:  Shows you the current version of the game.

 WAIT or Z:  Causes game time to pass.  When the game is waiting for
 you to type command, no game time passes; you can use this command to
 wait for something to happen.

 something...?

 Entrance to Fishing Pier

>go east
    Ignoring the warnings, you boldly start down the pier...

    The waves splash around you shooting up through the planks, the
 foamy spray offering temporary relief from the Texas heat.  You pause
 gripping the remaining guardrail with your hands and the planks with
 your toes.  With this cat like grip, you slowly inch your way to the
 end of the pier.

 End of Fishing Pier

>go down

    You put down all your stuff, take a deep breath, pinch your nose
 shut and....
    Splash!
    The coastal waters envelop you.  The taste of the salty water makes
 you grimace, not to mention the stinging effect it has on your eyes!
 Instinctively you start kicking towards the surface where you start
 gasp for air.  Did I forget to mention earlier that you're not the
 strongest swimmer?
    You felt ridiculous putting them on, but now the water wings are
 paying off. Their buoyancy gives you the extra boost you need to
 dog-paddle towards the lost section of pier.

 Under the Lost Pier

>go east
 Nothing but miles of water in that direction.

>look
 Under the Lost Pier
    You are now bobbing in the Gulf's rolling long swells; your patched
 Sammy the Seal wings helping you to stay afloat.  Above you is the
 remains of the original end of the pier supported by old wooden poles
 covered with barnacles and starfish.  Wedged into the supports is the
 wreckage of a small fishing boat.  It must have blown into the pier
 during the last storm.  The shoreline is visible to the west.

>examine boat
 Only a small portion of the bow remains above water.  While you're not
 a boating expert, you would guess that the boat is about 19-feet long,
 give or take a few inches now missing from it's hull.  Most of the
 contents of the boat seem to have been salvaged or sank long ago, but
 the water is so murky it really is hard to tell.

>look under boat
 There's nothing under the half-sunken boat.

>look in boat
 Ay matey..  could there be booty?
 You find a boat hook!

>take hook

 Woohoo!  Your score has increased.

 Taken.

>examine hook
 The forgotten boat hook is about 6 feet long and made of aluminum,
 which has kept it from rusting, but it's covered with sea phelgm.  It
 has an dull open hook at one end, presumably for snagging ropes that
 have fallen overboard.

>clean hook
 The boat hook looks a bit cleaner now.

>hook boat
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>go west
 Bobbing like a wounded manatee, you gradually make your way towards
 shore.

 Entrance to Fishing Pier
    When you were a youngster, you remember this pier being a lot
 longer, but that was two hurricanes ago.  Mother Nature has taken the
 pier and had her way with it.  The pier extends out into the water but
 the wood is broken and splintered farther out stopping well short of
 it's original length.  A second, inaccessible section of the pier is
 visible even farther out; the area that connected the two having been
 washed away.
    On this side of the pier, only one guardrail remains, the other
 lost to the elements.  Choppy water splashes against the few remaining
 supports beneath the pier sending plumes of water shooting up through
 the planks.  The constant splashes has made the planks of the pier
 mossy and slick.  A sign nearby advised that the pier is closed until
 storm damage can be repaired.  What remains of the pier extends to the
 east.  The service road leads away to the west.

 Harbor back in his day - the shrimp industry supported the town and
 boats could be seen leaving early in the morning with seagulls
 circling closely overhead as their nets were drawn up.  Now, however,
 one would uses the term harbor loosely when viewing this small dock.
 Today's harbor is nothing more than a couple of rotted wooden poles
 being used to tie old shrimp boats against.  The shrimp boats hardly
 look seaworthy with their hulls scraped and their nets faded and

 `The house on this property was built by town co-founder Col.  Clyde
 Beauregard Dalton in 1933.  Clyde Dalton was born in 1898, the second
 of two children from Beauregard and Esther Lynn Dalton, wealthy cattle
 ranchers from Lubbock, Texas. Clyde and his brother, Claude, came to
 what was then known as Port Dietrich in 1922.  From an inheritance
 left by their parents, Claude opened a meat-packing plant while Clyde
 began investing money to local businesses.  The meat-packing plant and
 the businesses funded by Clyde helped the growth of Port Dietrich.  In
 1925, the increasing port population and growth of the economy,
 despite nationwide depression, made Port Dietrich eligible for "town"
 status.  With considerable influence from the Dalton brothers, Port
 Dietrich was renamed "Dalton."  Claude left the Dalton estate in 1930.
 Clyde Dalton, an influential Board member and businessman himself,
 remained.  Clyde Dalton passed in 1949 and is buried in Dalton
 Cemetery.'

 television with a rocking chair facing it.  The kitchen is to the
 west, the sliding glass door to the porch is east.

 Ah, they don't make them like they used to.  This giant wall-mounted
 hulk of an air conditioner had the prime responsibility of cooling
 down the entire house.  You remember your uncles always fretting that
 it was going to give out at any moment and then the house would be
 doomed.  Standing now in the sweltering heat of the abandoned house
 you can appreciate why they were so worried!
 The behemoth air conditioner pumps out cool air in laborious grunts.

 The utility closet is open.  There's nothing in the utility closet.

 The evenings from your childhood summers that didn't take place
 sitting on the porch took place watching this television.  As the
 nearest broadcasting station was 60 miles away station the images were
 usually just scratchy ghosts.  The TV has long gone silent and can now
 basically be considered merely a bulky paperweight with fake wooden
 paneling.

 I don't know the word "paneling".

 Which rocking do you mean, the rocking chair, or the chair cushion?

 rocking chair:  An old rocking chair with a small foamy cushion for
 marginal comfort.
 chair cushion:  You poke the cushion...  it might be comfortable
 enough to get you through one movie, but not a marathon.

 Inside Boatshed

 Inside Boatshed
    Even in broad daylight, the interior of the boatshed gives you the
 spook.  The walls and rafters are covered in cobwebs and you catch
 spiders and other crawling nastiness lurking in the dark spaces that
 heretofore had been undisturbed for years.  Your grandfather's boat is
 not here - your Uncle Alexander had sold it shortly after he was put
 into the rest home.

 Outside Boatshed

>go east
 The mosquitoes feverishly attempt to use your legs for their blood
 feast, but the old rubber boots protect you.  Waving your hand in
 front of you to keep them from roosting on your face, you continue
 across the path.

 Swampy path

 Really swampy side of house

 Front of House

>go east
 Beach Road..  in front of house
    You see Sammy Seal Water Wings here.

>go south
 Beach Road..  near the harbor

>inventory
 You have a boat hook, a bag, a pair of white fishing boots (being
 worn), a cotton jacket (being worn), a sturdy tacklebox, a keyrack, an
 old house key, and a calendar.  The bag seems to contain a piece of
 withered meat.  The sturdy tacklebox seems to contain a fish hook and
 a bicycle tire repair kit.  The keyrack seems to contain a small key.

>go south
 Beach Road..  near the boatramp

>go south
 Beach Road..  out yonder

>go south
 Beach Road..  south side of town

>go south
 You take a few steps towards the south before figuring it's just way
 too hot to continue.

 Inside Cemetery
    The Dalton Cemetery is one of the oldest fixtures of the town.  To
 the right of the path, you can see the cement mausoleum of the Dalton
 brothers.  From the looks of it, it has not been cleared of its weeds
 in some time.  You look around at some of the other stones, some
 buried by the grass, some with dying flowers, and a few with small
 American Flags hanging limply in the heat, providing just enough shade
 for a few noisy crickets.  A path leads deeper into the cemetery
 towards the west.  An old rusty gate is to the east.

>examine stones
 I don't know the word "stones".

>examine mausoleum
 For as wealthy as the Dalton's were, their tomb is not overly
 spectacular.  Based on it's overgrown appearance, you guess that the
 Daltons don't get many visitors.  If it weren't for the names and
 dates carved into it's doors, it could pass for a large cement
 toolshed.

 Deep Inside Cemetery

 Deep Inside Cemetery
    It would seem the deeper you travel into the cemetery, the less
 maintained the graves become.  Your eyes are drawn to a particular set
 of graves before you.  Two headstones stand before two graves - one of
 which covered by a large stone grave cover.  On the left lies your
 grandmother, and on the right the place where your grandfather will
 eventually be buried.  Your grandmother's grave cover, mostly
 concealed beneath sand and weeds, seems to be suffering in the humid
 climate.

>cover
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine cover
 Some accident has caused the grave cover to break down the center!  A
 crevice runs about 7 inches across and nearly a foot long down the
 cover breaching the sanctuary of your ancestor's earthly remains.  The
 entire slab seems to be slowly collapsing into the grave.  You suspect
 it's just a matter of time before the entire slab collapses down upon
 your grandmother!

>look in crevice
 You're not sure if it's the cloud cover casting eerie shadows, or the
 product of your over-active imagination, but as you peer into the
 gloom of your Grandmother's gave you can just barely make out some
 shiny object resting on a withered skeleton.

>examine shiny object
 It's hard to tell from here, but it looks like a small round silver
 locket.  It seems to have a small clasp so that it can be opened.

>open locket
 I don't know how to open 'Grandma's locket'.

>take locket
 You reach through crack in the grave cover but Grandma, and her
 locket, are about 4-feet beyond your reach.

>inventory
 You have a boat hook, a bag, a pair of white fishing boots (being
 worn), a cotton jacket (being worn), a sturdy tacklebox, a keyrack, an
 old house key, and a calendar.  The bag seems to contain a piece of
 withered meat.  The sturdy tacklebox seems to contain a fish hook and
 a bicycle tire repair kit.  The keyrack seems to contain a small key.

>take locket with hook
 Which hook do you mean, the boat hook, or the fish hook?

>boat

 Woohoo!  Your score has increased.

    Reaching through the cracked grave cover with the boat hook, you
 manage to snag the hook around the locket.  With some subtle
 maneuvering and no small amount of awkward fumbling, you manage to
 wrangle the locket over the skull of your grandmother and pull it up
 through the crevice!

    With nervous fingers you open the delicate clasp on the silver
 locket.  Inside, you see two small black and white photos:  on the
 left is a picture of your grandfather George Sorich and on the right
 Col.  Clyde Dalton!

    `So I guess now you know.'

    The sudden voice startles you!  With a jump you turn about to see
 the old fisherman McHugh looking at you with an odd expression of
 shame and pity.  `I figured you'd probably suspected something,
 otherwise why would you've come?  When your grandfather was away on
 the war old Dalton was running the numbers on everyone in town.  When
 poor Eleanor couldn't afford the house payments or food for her and
 her mother, old man Dalton started taking liberties.  When George came
 home from the war, he found his young wife carrying another man's
 child.'

    You look back down at the small locket and examine the pictures
 within the pendant.  You take a closer look at the tiny portrait of
 Dalton.  A knot starts forming in your stomach as you now realize you
 share a resemblance to the man - your real grandfather.

    `Yeah, well, here's what I came to give you.  It's a copy of
 Dalton's will.  You'll see, that if you're really Gwen's oldest child,
 it looks like you probably have claim the Dalton estate, what's left
 of it anyway.  It was passed down to his heirs, but your grandmother
 was too proud to claim it.  I know your grandma never wanted to touch
 the money while she was alive - she never wanted your mom to know who
 her real father was.  I suppose your grandfather sent you out here?
 He must've had his reasons...'

    You silently consider this new revelation as you look in the
 direction of the Mansion.

 *** You have won..  if you can consider defiling your grandmother's
 eternal rest really winning ***
