    You awaken, finding yourself in a grassy field.  Twisted images
 flash through your mind quickly:  driving out on Halloween to do a
 little camping and try and work things out by yourself ...  your
 awakening in the middle of the night ...  walking to the cliff-top in
 the moonlight, not exactly knowing why ...  stepping up to the edge,
 and falling off -- no, stepping off.  Only a few scattered memories
 remain past that:  sensations of wind rushing past you, and then wings
 surrounding you, and then blackness.  Now you're here, wherever that
 is.  The sun shines brightly overhead, and a brook babbles gently along
 nearby. An apple tree grows in the center of the field, branches rich
 with fruit.

>examine apple tree
 A grassy field, by an apple tree
    This is a field of lush green grass.  In the center of the field, an
 apple tree grows.  Its branches are hung with ripe red apples.
 Scattered flowers wink at you from the grass, as the sun shines
 brightly overhead.  A babbling brook softly runs westwards.  A small
 foot-bridge allows you to cross from one bank to the other.
    A robin is perched atop the tree, whistling a merry tune.

 It's an old, gnarled apple tree.  As you stare at it, you think you can
 see vague outlines of a grumpy-looking face in the trunk.  Juicy,
 delicious-looking red apples hang from the branches above your head,
 and the tree looks great for climbing.  A colorful kite-like object is
 sitting on a branch, high up in the tree.

 You approach the tree and start to climb it.  You are startled by a
 sudden voice which seems to emanate from the tree itself, like some
 mystic speech from the kingdom of faerie.  The voice says "Hey
 birdbrain!  Put that foot on my branch and I'll whack yer bleedin' head
 off!"  Rather surprised, you desist for the moment.

>ask tree about itself
 I don't know the word "itself".

 The tree haughtily ignores you.

>ask tree about himself
 I don't know the word "himself".

>ask tree about tree
 "I'm an apple tree, and a damn fine specimen of one, if I do say so
 myself.  Which I do, since you're obviously too busy gawking to say
 anything of any use."
 "Tweet-tweet!"  goes the robin.

>ask tree about kite
>tree, give me an apple
 "Nice one, eh?  Picked it up 'bout a year ago in a windstorm."
 The robin whistles loudly.

 "Ooh, I'd bet you'd like one of these nice, juicy, apples."  A branch
 lowers slightly, lifting one into reach.  "Well too bad!  They're
 mine!"  The branch jerks away again.

 What do you want to attack it with?

>examine face
 It's a face all right.  Perhaps someone carved it in there?  The face
 is quite a grumpy one.  The artist must have been having a bad day.

>flip bird to tree
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine robin
 A happy-looking robin.  It sings a playful little song.

>sing
 I don't know the word "sing".

 The robin cocks its head sideways and looks at you for a moment, but
 makes no response.

>ask robin about tree
 It's too far away.
 The robin whistles loudly.

>ask tree for kite
 I don't know the word "for".

>ask tree about robin
 "If you could get rid of that annoying bird, I'd be much obliged.  I'd
 let you climb up there, but I have this terrible case of woodrot on
 that side, and ..."
 The tree spends the next ten minutes or so explaining its troubles to
 you in great detail.

>cut tree
 I don't know the word "cut".

 You are empty-handed.

 Your stomach rumbles.  You realize that you're getting hungry.
 The robin chirps.

>ask tree about kite
 "I suppose you want it?  Too bad!"

>examine kite
 You can't make out much from here.  It looks like a kite, only bigger.
 The robin glances stealthily around to look for female robins.  Must be
 mating season.

>cross bridge
 I don't know the word "cross".

>sing
 I don't know the word "sing".

 A small wooden bridge, so you don't have to get your feet wet wading
 across the stream.

 "Tweet-tweet!"  goes the robin.

 You find nothing of interest.

 Your stomach rumbles.  You realize that you're getting hungry.

>climb tree
 "Hey!  Don't climb me!  I don't want your ugly fat feet all over me!"
 says the tree.  Ignoring its protests, you reach for a low branch and
 start climbing.  The leaves rustle angrily, but nothing seems to
 happen, so you continue up the tree.  Suddenly, though, there's a sound
 from above you.  You look up just in time to see a large red apple
 falling.  It *THWACKS* you on the nose, you cry out and let go, and
 everything becomes all tumbled up in a heap on the ground.  "Hah!"
 says the tree.  "That'll teach you."  "Ha!"  you say back, grabbing the
 apple.
    "Oh," says the tree.  "I hadn't thought of that."

 Quite possibly the finest apple you have ever tasted in your life.
 That was delicious!

>throw apple at robin
 "Don't try and throw things at it, idiot!  You'll only end up knocking
 my leaves off, and then who knows what will happen?  I suppose you
 think I can photosynthesize with my bark, hmm?  Sheesh, humans!"  The
 tree continues to talk.  You decide to find another approach and save
 yourself a second lecture on the subject.

>go north
 You walk for a few minutes, when the ground abruptly seems to fall away
 beneath your feet.  You stumble forward, and look up to find yourself
 in a different place.

 A burning desert
    Just looking at the scorched and blasted terrain is enough to make
 you gasp for water.  The sun beats down all around with no hope of
 shade or any other respite, and there are no land-marks in sight in any
 direction.

>examine sand
 I don't see any sand here.

>examine sun
 The sun is high in the sky, as usual.  It doesn't seem to be moving,
 though.

 Shadows from distant dunes make the image of cool water.  You rush
 towards it, only to have the scene dissolve as you get closer.

>go south
 You stagger on ahead, baking in the sun.  Finally, you must stop to
 breathe.  Taking a look behind yourself, it is hard to tell that you
 have moved at all.  Already, the hot desert breeze is erasing the signs
 of your passage.

 Your stomach rumbles.  You realize that you're getting hungry.

 Abruptly, the desert air seems to swirl around you.  You blink your
 eyes, and when they open again, you're back where you came here from:

>climb tree
 "Oh, no," the tree says.  "I'm not falling for that one again.  I
 didn't drop off the tree yesterday, I can tell you that much.  You want
 any more apples, bud, you're doing me a favor first."  The apple tree's
 branches move around enough to make climbing impossible now.

 You have an apple.

    Just looking at the scorched and blasted terrain is enough to make
 you gasp for water.  The sun beats down all around with no hope of

 You're feeling really hungry.  You should find some food soon.

>go west
 You stagger on ahead, baking in the sun.  Finally, you must stop to
 breathe.  Taking a look behind yourself, it is hard to tell that you
 have moved at all.  Already, the hot desert breeze is erasing the signs
 of your passage.

>eat apple
 Quite possibly the finest apple you have ever tasted in your life.
 That was delicious!

 The wind picks up, and as the burning breeze blows past your ear, you
 fancy you hear voices.  Whose voices?  Even the words they say are
 beyond comprehension.

>listen
 I don't know the word "listen".

    A robin is perched atop the tree, whistling a merry tune.

>examine flowers
 The wild flowers grow among the grasses, in a wild assortment of
 colors.
 The robin chirps.

 You walk along the banks of the stream for a time.

 In a garden
    A beautifully-sculpted garden, bounded by brick walls to the north
 and west. A stream flows in from the east and curves to flow to the
 south, slowly drifting through the garden.  The brook lazily winds its
 way under the small bridges and between the large rocks and stone paths
 that have been placed here. Small, pretty bushes are scattered here as
 well, each one elegantly trimmed and shaped.  In one corner of the
 garden there is a fountain, shaped like a dragon's head.  From the
 dragon's open mouth flows a steady stream of water, falling into the
 brook.
    Sitting on the large black rocks you see a sheet of red paper.

 Taken.
 A gentle breeze ruffles the leaves on the bushes.

 It looks to be the kind of paper used in making origami figures.  It's
 a plain sheet of red paper.

>make robin
 I don't know the word "make".

>fold paper
 What do you want to fold it into?

>fold paper into bird
 The only kind of origami bird you ever learned how to make was a crane,
 so you attempt that instead.  You skillfully fold the sheet of paper
 into an origami crane.
 The branches on the bushes sway gently in the wind.

>examine fountain
 The fountain, as has been mentioned, is made of stone, and shaped like
 the head of a dragon.  The dragon's mouth is open, and water pours from
 it into the stream.

 You find nothing of interest.

>put crane in fountain
 The water flowing out prevents things from going in.
 The leaves on the bushes are actually bending in the breeze.  Strange,
 really, considering the wind is barely blowing.

>drink water
 The cool draught refreshes you.
 The hedges are moving.  Casually, as non-chalant as a bush can be, the
 hedges have uprooted themselves.  Well, some of them have, anyway.
 Most of the bushes are sitting there looking innocent again.  The
 uprooted ones begin to move about the garden.  One or two of them reach
 under rocks and bushes and pull out rakes and spades and a bucket.
 They quietly start to water the flowers, rake the paths, and prune the
 bushes.  You look on in amazement.  The hedge beasts totally ignore
 you.

 Well, I guess they aren't just your ordinary hedges.  Definitely a
 close relative, however, as the hedge beasts still seem to have leaves
 and branches and such.  At the moment, the hedge beasts are moving
 around the garden, tending to the flowers and raking the paths.

>examine bucket
 I don't see any bucket here.

>examine rake
 I don't see any rake here.

>examine rakes
 I don't know the word "rakes".

 In a garden
    A beautifully-sculpted garden, bounded by brick walls to the north
 and west. A stream flows in from the east and curves to flow to the
 south, slowly drifting through the garden.  The brook lazily winds its
 way under the small bridges and between the large rocks and stone paths
 that have been placed here. Small, pretty bushes are scattered here as
 well, each one elegantly trimmed and shaped.  In one corner of the
 garden there is a fountain, shaped like a dragon's head.  From the
 dragon's open mouth flows a steady stream of water, falling into the
 brook.
    The hedge beasts are tending to the garden, raking and digging.

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine brick
 The brick walls are tall and smooth enough to be unclimbable.  They
 surround the garden on the north and west sides, stretching off into
 the haze at the two edges.

 You follow the brook's path out of the garden, and into a field.

 An open field
    This is an open field, with a few boulders and the like scattered
 about.  In the center of the field, someone has constructed a white
 gazebo, its shadow providing perhaps the only real shade in the area.
 A cool stream runs north-south through the field.  A wide white plank
 allows you to cross from one bank to the other.

>examine boulders
 They're your basic large, gray chunks of rock.  There's about six in
 the field, arranged in a rough three-quarter circle around around the
 gazebo.

 A rather nice white gazebo, hexagon-shaped.  Most of the walls are
 covered with lattices to keep the sun out, but one is open to allow
 entrance.  The roof of the gazebo is rather strange.  It is flat, but
 then mounted atop the flat part is an extra structure which appears to
 be a long thin wall cutting straight across the roof.  The wall is
 shaped like a right triangle, with the square corner and one other
 affixed to the gazebo, and the third jutting straight up.  Atop that,
 you can see a weather vane, moving slightly in the slow wind.  You
 could enter the gazebo and look around, if you liked.

>attack gazebo
 What do you want to attack it with?

>apple
 I don't see any apple here.

>attack gazebo
 What do you want to attack it with?

 You walk inside the gazebo.

 Inside the gazebo
    The gazebo has six sides, one of which is open to allow you to
 enter.  The other five are walled off with thick lattices which prevent
 both sunlight and egress in those directions, making it fairly dim in
 here.  A bronze sundial in the center of the room is the most
 impressive thing in sight, but there's also an ordinary table against
 one wall.  Also, set into the ceiling, you can see a multi-faceted
 crystal.
    Sitting on the wooden table you see a large wicker bird cage.

 Taken.

 Which crystal do you mean, the large crystal, or the tiny crystal?

 The large crystal has six visible facets.  It is set into the ceiling,
 directly over the sundial.  It is dark, and seems somehow sad.

 The crystal seems to be tiny and six-sided.  It looks a lot like a
 miniature version of the one mounted directly above it in the ceiling.
 It's fixed quite firmly in place, on the tip of the gnomon of the
 sundial.

>examine sundial
 It's a bronze sundial, on a pedestal.  A rather nice sundial too, by
 the looks of it.  It's a pity there's no real sunlight to make it
 useful.  The inscription "Tempus Non Fugit" has been printed around the
 face of the sundial, and there are also six small metal studs set into
 the bronzework.  In the dim light, you notice the sparkle of a tiny
 crystal on the tip of the gnomon.

>get tiny
 You can't have the tiny crystal.

>examine studs
 They're six small, metal studs.  Nothing too exceptional.  They all
 feel rather loose, but are small enough that it would be difficult to
 remove them by hand.  The studs are spaced fairly evenly around the
 sundial, at six, eight, ten, twelve, two, and four o'clock.

>push stud
 Which stud do you mean, the stud at six o'clock, the stud at eight
 o'clock, the stud at ten o'clock, the stud at twelve o'clock, the stud
 at two o'clock, or the stud at four o'clock?

>six
 Pushing the stud at six o'clock doesn't do anything.

>examine gnomon
 A gnomon, of course, is the thingy on the sundial which casts the
 shadow.  This gnomon appears no different from any other one you've
 seen, except that most gnomons don't have tiny crystals on their tips.
 Whereas this one seems positively festooned with them.  Well, it has
 one of them, anyway.

>look in cage
 Willow twigs have been plaited together to form a simple cage.  The
 cage door (open) has a single slide bolt which can be used to keep it
 shut.

>xyzzy
 I don't know the word "xyzzy".

>push twelve
 Pushing the stud at twelve o'clock doesn't do anything.

 Pulling the stud at twelve o'clock doesn't have any effect.

>turn gnomon
 Turning the bronze gnomon doesn't have any effect.

>examine table
 The table has been painted white to match the rest of the gazebo.

>look under table
 There's nothing under the wooden table.

 cage door (open) has a single slide bolt which can be used to keep it

 You exit the gazebo.

 about.  In the center of the field, someone has constructed a white

 A cool stream runs north-south through the field.  A wide white plank

 You walk until you enter a garden.

    A beautifully-sculpted garden, bounded by brick walls to the north

 south, slowly drifting through the garden.  The brook lazily winds its

 brook.
    The hedge beasts are tending to the garden, raking and digging.

 You walk east until you are in the field again.

    This is a field of lush green grass.  In the center of the field, an
 apple tree grows.  Its branches are hung with ripe red apples.
 Scattered flowers wink at you from the grass, as the sun shines
 brightly overhead.  A babbling brook softly runs westwards.  A small
 foot-bridge allows you to cross from one bank to the other.
    A robin is perched atop the tree, whistling a merry tune.

 The robin sings happily.

 The robin trills a short song, seeming to emphasize the virtues of
 freedom and open spaces.  The tree grumbles.

>whistle
 I don't know the word "whistle".

>examine cage
 Willow twigs have been plaited together to form a simple cage.  The
 cage door (open) has a single slide bolt which can be used to keep it
 shut.  Inside the cage, you can see a red origami crane.

 I don't know the word "tweet".

 I don't know the word "chirp".

>give cage to robin
 It's too far away.

 You walk for a few minutes, when the ground abruptly seems to fall away
 beneath your feet.  You stumble forward, and look up to find yourself
 in a different place.

 A burning desert
    Just looking at the scorched and blasted terrain is enough to make
 you gasp for water.  The sun beats down all around with no hope of
 shade or any other respite, and there are no land-marks in sight in any
 direction.

 You stagger on ahead, baking in the sun.  Finally, you must stop to
 breathe.  Taking a look behind yourself, it is hard to tell that you
 have moved at all.  Already, the hot desert breeze is erasing the signs
 of your passage.

 The sands move, perhaps pushed by the wind.  In their motion, you see
 faces of people long-buried in memory.

 You stagger forwards, the rays of sun lashing your back and neck.  One
 foot kicks something half-buried in the sand, and you pause and look.

 There appear to be extra words after your command.

>get origami

 Wheee!

>show origami to bird
 The robin trumpets a (relatively) loud war-cry, and swoops at the paper
 figure, seeking to defend its territory.  At the last moment, however,
 it veers off, and returns to its perch in the tree.  You must have
 frightened it.
 The robin glances stealthily around to look for female robins.  Must be
 mating season.

 I don't understand that sentence.

>give crane to tree
 Unlikely, I think.

 You walk along the banks of the stream for a time.

 In a garden
    A beautifully-sculpted garden, bounded by brick walls to the north
 and west. A stream flows in from the east and curves to flow to the
 south, slowly drifting through the garden.  The brook lazily winds its
 way under the small bridges and between the large rocks and stone paths

 garden there is a fountain, shaped like a dragon's head.  From the
 dragon's open mouth flows a steady stream of water, falling into the
 brook.
    The hedge beasts are curled up on the ground, practically
 indistinguishable from the normal hedges.

 You follow the brook's path out of the garden, and into a field.

 An open field
    This is an open field, with a few boulders and the like scattered
 about.  In the center of the field, someone has constructed a white
 gazebo, its shadow providing perhaps the only real shade in the area.
 A cool stream runs north-south through the field.  A wide white plank
 allows you to cross from one bank to the other.

 Walking south eventually takes you to a rocky cliff-top.

 Cliff top, by a waterfall
    The area is fairly rocky here, with scattered grasses growing
 between cracks in the rocks.  The stream winds its way between the
 rocks, widening as it goes, only to curve eastwards and finally pour
 off the edge of the cliff in a glorious waterfall.  A cloud of water
 vapor is visible down below, as the stream crashes to the ground and
 starts to move normally again.  A flash of reflected sunlight attracts
 your attention to something in a crack in the rocks.
    Sitting on the river rocks you see a music box and a small fly.

 music box:  Taken.
 small fly:  Taken.

 On closer inspection, you see that the fly is a fake fly, made from
 twisted plastics.  Quite realistic looking too.

 It's a small wooden music box.  A crank protudes from one side, but
 there's no other markings on it.

 You wind up the music box.

 The most noticable crack in the rocks is about a dozen feet from the
 cliff's edge, a large gap between two big boulders.  Sometimes the
 current pushes objects in there instead of off the waterfall.  A glass
 bottle has sunk to the bottom of the crack.
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  A rather nice, but short,
 piece of classical music comes from the box.

 I don't know the word "listen".

 Taken.
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The peaceful sound of
 water running over rocks comes from the box.

 The bottle is made of glass, but seems fairly sturdy.  It has a
 snap-top allowing it to be firmly closed and sealed, as it is now.  The

 The stream winds its way between numerous gaps in the rocks, until it
 finally plunges off the cliff as a waterfall.  It's a much wider stream
 than the part north of here.

 Down at the bottom, the waterfall creates a vapor cloud when it crashes
 to earth.  Sometimes, when the cloud shifts, you can vaguely make out
 something glinting in it, but you can't tell anything through the mist.

>turn crank
 You wind up the music box.

 You walk north, and soon arrive back at the open field.

 An open field
    This is an open field, with a few boulders and the like scattered
 about.  In the center of the field, someone has constructed a white
 gazebo, its shadow providing perhaps the only real shade in the area.
 A cool stream runs north-south through the field.  A wide white plank
 allows you to cross from one bank to the other.
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  A rather nice, but short,
 piece of classical music comes from the box.

 You walk until you enter a garden.

 In a garden
    A beautifully-sculpted garden, bounded by brick walls to the north
 and west. A stream flows in from the east and curves to flow to the
 south, slowly drifting through the garden.  The brook lazily winds its
 way under the small bridges and between the large rocks and stone paths
 that have been placed here. Small, pretty bushes are scattered here as
 well, each one elegantly trimmed and shaped.  In one corner of the
 garden there is a fountain, shaped like a dragon's head.  From the
 dragon's open mouth flows a steady stream of water, falling into the
 brook.
    The hedge beasts are curled up on the ground, practically
 indistinguishable from the normal hedges.
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The peaceful sound of
 water running over rocks comes from the box.

 You walk east until you are in the field again.

 A grassy field, by an apple tree
    This is a field of lush green grass.  In the center of the field, an
 apple tree grows.  Its branches are hung with ripe red apples.
 Scattered flowers wink at you from the grass, as the sun shines
 brightly overhead.  A babbling brook softly runs westwards.  A small
 foot-bridge allows you to cross from one bank to the other.
    A robin is perched atop the tree, whistling a merry tune.
 The robin whistles loudly.
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  Twitters and whistles
 come from the box.  Birdcalls, you assume.  The robin seems to rouse
 itself upon hearing the music.  It gazes alertly around for other
 robins, beginning to sing its own territory-song.  Sighting the red
 paper figure in your possession, the robin swoops down towards you,
 only to veer off and return to the tree at the last second.  It
 chirrups angrily.

 It's out of reach, silly.
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The sound of a crackling
 fire, blazing away, comes from the box.

>put origami in cage
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The sound of wind-chimes
 in a gentle breeze comes from the box.

 crane inside the large wicker bird cage, the robin charges.  It swoops
 down inside the large wicker bird cage and begins to batter the folded
 paper unmercifully.  "And stay away, ya stupid bird!"  cries the apple
 tree, leaves rustling gleefully.

>close cage
 Closed.
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The sound of a crackling

 I don't know the word "for".

>ask tree about apple
 "You can have one or two, I suppose."
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The sound of wind-chimes
 in a gentle breeze comes from the box.  Finally having demolished its
 opponent, the robin whistles a victory song.  It turns to leave the
 large wicker bird cage, only to discover the large wicker bird cage has
 been closed around it.  It batters itself against the wall for a few
 minutes, until it finally gives up and takes a perch inside.  "Oh,
 thank you thank you thank you!"  calls the apple tree.  "You've gotten
 rid of that dratted robin for good!  I can nap again!  No more stupid
 nests, no more stupid chirping in the mornings when I've got my
 head-aches.  If there's anything I can do to repay you, just ask!"

>ask tree about kite
 "I suppose you want it?  I guess I owe you one.  Here."
 The tree's branches start to shake for a bit.  The kite-like thing is
 dislodged, and slides down to the ground.  It looks like it's a
 hang-glider.
 "Tweet-tweet!"  goes the robin.

>thank tree
 I don't know the word "thank".

>inventory
 You have a music box, a glass bottle, a small fly, and a hang-glider.
 The glass bottle seems to contain a small black magnet, a piece of
 paper, and a heavy stone.

>examine stone
 The rock is oval, fairly heavy, and about the size of an apple or maybe
 even slightly bigger.  Useful as a paperweight, I suppose.  You fancy
 it was in the bottle to weigh the bottle down and keep it from drifting
 away.
 The robin glances stealthily around to look for female robins.  Must be
 mating season.

>examine paper
 Which paper do you mean, the piece of paper, or the scraps of paper?

>piece
 In a easy, flowing script, someone has written on the paper.  "Welcome,
 child.  Please, think things over for a bit, and then come and see me.
 Be careful.

 The robin chirps.

>go north

 You walk forwards, and again feel the sensation of the ground
 vanishing.  A blast of sweltering heat welcomes you to the desert one
 more time.

 A burning desert
    Just looking at the scorched and blasted terrain is enough to make
 you gasp for water.  The sun beats down all around with no hope of
 shade or any other respite, and there are no land-marks in sight in any
 direction.
    You see a sun-bleached skull here.

 You think you hear a voice behind you.  "Okay, Mom, I'm coming," you
 reply.  But when you turn, there is no one there.

 You stagger on ahead, baking in the sun.  Finally, you must stop to
 breathe.  Taking a look behind yourself, it is hard to tell that you
 have moved at all.  Already, the hot desert breeze is erasing the signs
 of your passage.

>go west
 You walk along the banks of the stream for a time.

 In a garden
    A beautifully-sculpted garden, bounded by brick walls to the north
 and west. A stream flows in from the east and curves to flow to the
 south, slowly drifting through the garden.  The brook lazily winds its
 way under the small bridges and between the large rocks and stone paths
 that have been placed here. Small, pretty bushes are scattered here as
 well, each one elegantly trimmed and shaped.  In one corner of the
 garden there is a fountain, shaped like a dragon's head.  From the
 dragon's open mouth flows a steady stream of water, falling into the
 brook.
    The hedge beasts are curled up on the ground, practically
 indistinguishable from the normal hedges.

>go south
 You follow the brook's path out of the garden, and into a field.

 An open field
    This is an open field, with a few boulders and the like scattered
 about.  In the center of the field, someone has constructed a white
 gazebo, its shadow providing perhaps the only real shade in the area.
 A cool stream runs north-south through the field.  A wide white plank
 allows you to cross from one bank to the other.

>go south
 Walking south eventually takes you to a rocky cliff-top.

 Cliff top, by a waterfall
    The area is fairly rocky here, with scattered grasses growing
 between cracks in the rocks.  The stream winds its way between the
 rocks, widening as it goes, only to curve eastwards and finally pour
 off the edge of the cliff in a glorious waterfall.  A cloud of water
 vapor is visible down below, as the stream crashes to the ground and
 starts to move normally again.

>wear kite
 You grab hold of the glider bar and adjust your position on it.  You're
 ready to fly!  Okay, you're now wearing the hang-glider.

>SAVE
>cf3

>fly
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>jump
 If you want to get off the cliff, a few steps east will do it.

>go east
 You walk out to the very edge of the cliff, and look down at the steep
 drop-off below.  The wind tugs at you playfully up here, making you
 vaguely nervous.

>go east
 You step off the cliff ...
    And soar into the air.  The transition from land to sky is a bit
 tricky, but you get the hang of it fast.  You're still dropping in
 altitude, though.  (Of course, compared to how fast you'd be dropping
 without a hang-glider, you're doing great.)

 Flying near cliff
    You are riding the winds on the hang-glider.  Below you and to the
 west, the cliff's base is easily apparent, as is the waterfall pouring
 down it.  When it strikes the ground, the water resumes its normal
 course as a river, flowing eastwards.  The ground below you is covered
 with scattered rocks and such, and not many grasses.

>go west
 Uh, there is a cliff in the way, in case you hadn't noticed.  You can't
 maintain this flying in circles forever.  You'd better find a good
 place to land.

>remove kite
 It was Heinlein, I believe, who said that the only crime is stupidity,
 and the punishment is always death.  This would be a good demonstration
 of that.

>land in river
 I don't know the word "land".

>go east
 You steer the glider eastwards.  "Hey, this flying stuff isn't so bad,"
 you think to yourself.  "Just gotta push this way to turn left, this
 way to turn right and --" Your thoughts are interrupted by a large
 object which suddenly looms in your path.  Luckily for you, it is a
 fairly soft one.  You tumble to the ground in a large heap of
 glider-and-person, and look around to see yourself surrounded by giant
 mushrooms ...

 Amidst the mushrooms
    On either bank of the river, stretching high into the sky, are giant
 mushrooms.  Giant technicolored mushrooms.  Red and blue and yellow and
 green and purple, and most are splotched with splashes of other colors.
 The mushrooms tower at least a dozen feet above you, perhaps more, and
 their outstretched caps block out most of the sun.  You can see there
 is a split in the now-sluggish stream here, one branch going south and
 the main branch running east-west.

>examine mushrooms
 Yes, they're giant mushrooms.  Perhaps a dozen feet high, with broad
 caps that block out much of the sunlight.  All different colors, and
 many have spots and splotches of various hues, too.  Still, the dim
 light makes them look shadowy and strange rather than ridiculous.  A
 spiderweb hangs from between two giant red mushrooms.  Sitting on the
 spiderweb, a brown spider watches you with beady eyes.  Below, a small
 (ie, normal-sized) gray mushroom pokes up from the ground into the
 strands of webbing.  The spider scurries around the web, surprisingly
 quickly.  It seems to be changing the strands of the web.  To your
 amazement, words begin to form on the web, carved out in strands of
 gossamer silk.

>read web
 The spiderweb is composed of long, lacy strands, like fine silk or long
 hair.  It seems to shimmer in the snatches of sunlight that filter in.
 A small brown spider squats in the center of the web.  Behind it, you
 can see strange designs.  The designs appear to be letters.  Words,
 even.  You can make out "Altered visions".

>examine gray mushroom
 The mushroom is small and gray, yet somehow enticing.  It's nearly
 impossible to make out more about it, because of the strands of
 spider-silk that have been wrapped around its cap.

>examine red mushroom

 You walk until you reach the base of a waterfall.

 At base of cliff
    You are near the banks of the east-flowing river that starts from
 the nearby waterfall.  The ground is covered with large numbers of
 scattered rocks, all shapes and sizes.  Not much grass grows here.  The
 cliff is impassible to the west (unless you want to climb it), but the
 other directions are all possible.

>examine rocks
 The same basic sorts of rocks and scree and such that you see all over
 this place.  The only difference in this area is that there's lots and
 lots of the rocks, enough to force you to follow the twisted paths in
 between them when they're too big to climb over.

>search rocks
 The scattered rocks aren't important.

>examine cloud

 nearby.  The wind blows water droplets onto your face.

 scattered rocks, all shapes and sizes.  Not much grass grows here.  The
 cliff is impassible to the west (unless you want to climb it), but the
 other directions are all possible.

>examine rocks
 The same basic sorts of rocks and scree and such that you see all over
 this place.  The only difference in this area is that there's lots and
 lots of the rocks, enough to force you to follow the twisted paths in
 between them when they're too big to climb over.

>go north
 You walk for a minute or two, only to feel the ground beginning to slip
 away.  You take a hasty step backwards.

>go south
 You walk forwards, and again feel the sensation of the ground
 vanishing.  A blast of sweltering heat welcomes you to the desert one
 more time.

 A burning desert
    Just looking at the scorched and blasted terrain is enough to make
 you gasp for water.  The sun beats down all around with no hope of
 shade or any other respite, and there are no land-marks in sight in any
 direction.

>go east
 You stagger on ahead, baking in the sun.  Finally, you must stop to
 breathe.  Taking a look behind yourself, it is hard to tell that you
 have moved at all.  Already, the hot desert breeze is erasing the signs
 of your passage.

 Born by the wind, a single whispered word touches your ears:  Phoenix.

 Abruptly, the desert air seems to swirl around you.  You blink your
 eyes, and when they open again, you're back where you came here from:

 You walk for a minute or two, only to feel the ground beginning to slip

 Only a few sparse tufts of yellow-brown grass grow between the rocks.

 A voice speaks from behind a dune.  "This is not the place for you.  Go
 back until you are ready."

>inventory
 You have a music box, a glass bottle, a small fly, a sun-bleached
 skull, an apple, and a hang-glider.  The glass bottle seems to contain
 a small black magnet and a piece of paper.

>examine fly
 On closer inspection, you see that the fly is a fake fly, made from
 twisted plastics.  Quite realistic looking too.

>go east
 You walk eastwards.  The river leads into a grove of technicolor
 mushrooms.

 Amidst the mushrooms
    On either bank of the river, stretching high into the sky, are giant
 mushrooms.  Giant technicolored mushrooms.  Red and blue and yellow and
 green and purple, and most are splotched with splashes of other colors.
 The mushrooms tower at least a dozen feet above you, perhaps more, and
 their outstretched caps block out most of the sun.  You can see there
 is a split in the now-sluggish stream here, one branch going south and
 the main branch running east-west.  Between two dusky red mushrooms, a
 large silver spiderweb has been spun.

>show fly to spider
 The brown spider isn't impressed.

>put fly on we
 I don't know the word "we".

>put fly on web
>give fly to spider
 Don't want to get that close - better throw it.

 I don't know how to give anything to the brown spider.

>thorw spider
 I don't know the word "thorw".

>throw fly
 What do you want to throw it at?

>throw fly at web
 The small fly sticks in the web, caught on a thread.  The spider
 scuttles over to investigate the interesting-looking arrival.

>take mushroom
 Stealthily, not wanting to alert the spider, you reach out and grab the
 mushroom.  Then you see the spider scurrying over on spindly legs,
 going angrily towards your hand.  Things seem to be slowing.  You see
 it leaping towards you, fangs extended, you pull your hand away but it
 is too late, far too late.  The spider's fangs graze your finger for a
 moment before you throw it off into the bushes.  You sigh, examining
 the mushroom and wondering if it was worth it.  Then the scratch mark
 on your hand starts to throb.

 You can't wear the sun-bleached skull.

>go east
 Eventually the mushroom patch ends, and the river widens.

 By a wide stream
    This is a clearing in the middle of a forest.  Tall trees grow all
 around, moss hangs from their branches, and there are scattered
 flowers.  A stream runs through the forest here.  It is wide but
 shallow, allowing you to see the granite ground below it.  Small bits
 of quartz are embedded everywhere in the granite, and they sparkle and
 glimmer as the sunlight shines on the moving water.  But occasionally,
 you see other bright flashes in the water that don't seem to be caused
 by the sunlight.  The stream passes into the forest to the east, and is
 quickly lost amongst the trees.

>examine water
 The river is filled with glitters and sparkles, some from the sunlight
 on the quartz.  But others don't seem to be caused by that, since
 sometimes you notice a faint glow in the shadows.

>examine glow
 The light rippling across the wavelets of the river certainly does look
 a bit unusual.

>get glow
 The glints of light on the water aren't important.

>read glow
 The glints of light on the water aren't important.

>touch granite
 The granite stream-bed isn't important.

>examine shadow
 I don't see any shadow here.

>examine trees
 The trees are tall, and mossy.  If they had any low branches, you could
 climb them, but since they don't, you can't.

>examine sun
 The sun is high in the sky, as usual.  It doesn't seem to be moving,
 though.

>search stream
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine quartz
 The granite stream bed has been almost polished by all the water
 running over it.  Small bits of quartz are exposed in the bare rock,
 and they sparkle as the sunlight touches them.

>take it
 The granite stream-bed isn't important.

 It's already open!

>take magnet
 Taken.

>examine bottle
 The bottle is made of glass, but seems fairly sturdy.  It has a
 snap-top allowing it to be firmly closed and sealed, but it isn't at
 the moment.  The glass bottle is open.  The glass bottle is full of
 water.

>enter river
 You would be quite unhappy if you got all wet.

 I don't know the word "forest".

 The wild flowers grow among the grasses, in a wild assortment of
 colors.

 You follow the river branch to the south.

 End of path
    The river from the mushroom forest ends here.  It drains into a
 small hole in the ground, making a quiet gurgling noise as it does so.
 Meanwhile, the ground around it has become more muddy, and the
 mushrooms have disappeared.  They have been replaced with tangled
 bushes that block the way in all directions except back north.

>get mud
 I don't know the word "mud".

>examine hole
 The water flows into the hole, making a faint splashing sound.  It's
 too dark to see anything inside.

>examine bushes
 The bushes are quite tangly and spiky.  It would be impossible to force
 your way through them without a machete.

>enter hole
 Either the hole's too small or you're too big.  Besides, you don't want
 to get all muddy.

>search bushes
 The tangled bushes aren't important.

 Your apple floats around on the surface.

    Floating in the short stream you see an apple.

 You skillfully fold the sheet of paper into an origami boat.

 In a easy, flowing script, someone has written on the paper.  "Welcome,

 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine web
 The spiderweb is composed of long, lacy strands, like fine silk or long
 hair.  It seems to shimmer in the snatches of sunlight that filter in.
 A small brown spider squats in the center of the web.  Behind it, you
 can see strange designs.  The designs appear to be letters.  Words,
 even.  You can make out only a single word this time:  "Phoenix".

>phoenix
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>say phoenix
 I don't see any phoenix here.

 forest.  The mushroom-caps throw shadows on the river, making it dark

    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  A rather nice, but short,
 piece of classical music comes from the box.

    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The peaceful sound of
 water running over rocks comes from the box.

    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  Twitters and whistles
 come from the box.  Birdcalls, you assume.

    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The sound of a crackling
 fire, blazing away, comes from the box.

>examine mushroom
 The mushroom is small and gray, yet somehow enticing.  It's nearly
 impossible to make out more about it, because of the strands of
 spider-silk that have been wrapped around its cap.
    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The sound of wind-chimes

 moment before you throw it off into the bushes.  You sigh, examining
 the mushroom and wondering if it was worth it.  Then the scratch mark
 on your hand starts to throb.

>go south
 You follow the river branch to the south.

 End of path
    The river from the mushroom forest ends here.  It drains into a
 small hole in the ground, making a quiet gurgling noise as it does so.
 Meanwhile, the ground around it has become more muddy, and the
 mushrooms have disappeared.  They have been replaced with tangled
 bushes that block the way in all directions except back north.
 For a moment, you stumble as a wave of dizziness strikes.

>eat mushroom
    "Well, things can't possibly get any worse, can they?"  you think,
 examining the mushroom.  You tenatively take a small bite.  It doesn't
 really taste like anything special.  Not very good at all, more like
 stale cardboard than anything else.  But you take a second bite, and
 then a third bite.  Everything seems to get very quiet around you.
 Just you, and the bushes.  And the mushroom, and the venom in your
 blood.  Your finger seems to be hurting less, or perhaps hurting more
 and you aren't feeling the pain.  You take another bite, and choke on
 the piece for a minute before it goes down your throat dry.  Your
 forehead is on fire, you're going to burn up.  The bushes are rustling
 and waving their thorns at you.  You cough on the next piece, but
 swallow it.  Is there a bee-hive nearby?  The humming in your ears
 seems to suggest that, or perhaps you're going mad .  .  .
    going mad
        going mad
 You take a bite.  How many is this?  Six bites?  Seven?  Too hard to
 count now, too hard to think.  Just eat.  You feel strangely detached
 from everything, able to realize you have pain and are in serious
 trouble from the spider-bite, but at the same time just watching it all
 happen to your body.  Finally, sweet release.  The mushroom tumbles
 from your hand, and hits the ground almost at the same time you do .  .
 .
 Everything goes away for a little bit, and you drift into blackness.

    You are awakened by a voice calling your name.

 End of path
    The river from the mushroom forest ends here, draining into a small
 hole in the ground.  The way is blocked by tangled bushes that reach
 out at you on all sides except northwards.  The ground is soggy and
 muddy, and makes little slurping and drooling noises as you walk over
 it.
    You, or a long-lost twin at least, are standing here.

    "Listen, I know this is kind of strange," the
 person-who-looks-like-you says.  "But listen to me.  You have got to
 figure out what's going on here.  I can't help you out with it, either.
 I'm just a hallucination."

>examine hole
 The water flows into the hole, making a faint splashing sound.  It's
 too dark to see anything inside.
    "Pay attention!"  your double says, impatiently.  "There's no time.
 They're everywhere, and pretty damn soon we'll be falling off that
 cliff again.  Here's what you have to do:  keep exploring this place,
 and find Daniel.  He'll explain everything once you find him."

>ask double about daniel
 You don't seem to notice your questions.
    "Right now, there'll be some others coming along to help you walk
 your path," says the figure, "Listen to your ghosts.  You're protected
 some here, but it won't last forever.  *They* are everywhere.  Be
 careful, and look for the others."

>enter hole
 Either the hole's too small or you're too big.  Besides, you don't want
 to get all muddy.
    "C'mon, let's go," the you-hallucination says.  "Hurry, hurry.  Try
 and remember everything you see.  It's all got to fit together."

>go north
 You return to the mushroom patch.

 The figment of you walks along beside you, his footsteps making no
 sound.
 Amidst the mushrooms
    Your strange state of mind makes the mushrooms even more peculiar
 than they already are.  Or perhaps now they're normal, because you're
 strange ...  In any case, they seem to loom over you, colors ranging
 from bright to menacing, and sometimes changing even as you look at
 them.  The path of the river splits, one branch meandering south as the
 main river continues to run east-west.  Between two dusky red
 mushrooms, a large silver spiderweb has been spun.
    You, or a long-lost twin at least, are standing here.
    Zippy, your pet dog, is scampering around here.
    Zippy barks excitedly at you.  He runs over and sniffs your feet,
 and then tries to lick your face.  You don't feel anything as he does
 so, and his barks seem faint and shadowy, as if from a long distance
 away.

>pet zippy
 You reach out to pet Zippy.  Sadly, your fingers slip through and you
 can make no contact.  He whimpers sadly.
    Zippy sniffs the air and turns his head this way and that, as if
 looking for something.

>read web
 The spiderweb is composed of long, lacy strands, like fine silk or long
 hair.  It seems to shimmer in the snatches of sunlight that filter in.
 Strange designs are visible in the web.  The designs appear to be
 letters.  Words, even.  You can make out only a single word this time:
 "Phoenix".  Hanging in the web, you see a small fly.
    Zippy whines quietly.  He trots a short distance, then comes back to
 sit at your feet again.

>take fly
 Taken.
    Zippy barks shrilly, and then looks at you.  His eyes are wide and a
 little panicky.  He seems to want you to get moving.

>go east
 Eventually the mushroom patch ends, and the river widens.

 The figment of you walks along beside you, his footsteps making no
 sound.
 Zippy trots along by your side.
 By a wide stream
    This is a clearing in the middle of a forest.  Tall trees grow all
 around, moss hangs from their branches, and there are scattered
 flowers.  A stream runs through the forest here.  It is wide but
 shallow, allowing you to see the granite ground below it.  Small bits
 of quartz are embedded everywhere in the granite, and they sparkle and
 glimmer as the sunlight shines on the moving water.  Strange glowing
 fish are swimming around quite happily in the water.  Many are swimming
 against the current, seemingly without effort.  The stream passes into
 the forest to the east, and is quickly lost amongst the trees.
    You, or a long-lost twin at least, are standing here.
    Zippy, your pet dog, is scampering around here.
    Your great-aunt Polly is here, her eyes twinkling merrily at you.
    Zippy glances at the water, and then begins to bark loudly at the
 lightfish for a few minutes.  He turns and looks at you expectantly.
    "Hello, boy," great-aunt Polly says.  "Never expected to see me
 again, did you?  I see you've turned into a grown man already.  Well,
 well.  I only wish I was alive to see it."  She sighs.

>examine fish
 The lightfish seem to glow as they swim about in the river.  Perhaps
 it's just sunlight on scales, but perhaps not.  Furthermore, it's hard
 to tell what size they are.  Sometimes they seem as long as your arm,
 and sometimes some are only fingerlings.  Maybe it's just the lighting
 in here.  In any case, they swim around and around in complex patterns
 as you watch.  It's almost as if they're trying to tell you something.
    "Still, this isn't so bad.  Daniel brought me back to talk to you.
 I'm glad I got this chance to see you again."  Polly sighs again.
 "It's only a pity it had to be under such circumstances."

>ask polly about daniel
 Your great-aunt Polly doesn't seem to notice your questions.
    "There's a lot going on here, boy, more than you can know.  And your
 life is pretty screwed up, too.  I've seen a little of the things
 you've gotten into.  Not good.  I know it's all part of the great
 story, but it still hurts me to watch you destroy yourself.  I did what
 I could for you when I was alive, but here the rules are different.
 Daniel said it was for you to explore within yourself, without help,
 and I guess he's right.  You'd better go see him next, and then you had
 best be finding your dad.  A good man, your dad.  But he went in the
 same way I did ...  _They_ got him.  I can only pray you'll be
 different."  Aunt Polly falls silent for a minute.

>look in me
 Which me do you mean, you, or yourself?

>look in myself
 You look about the same as always.
    "I'd like to help you out more'n this, but Daniel said I mustn't.
 Once you find your father, lad, everything will get explained.  I'd
 like to come along and walk with you for a bit, though.  I don't got
 many chances to see you nowadays.  Only when the worlds are right."

>go east
 You walk forwards.  Tendrils of sparkling white mist begin to spiral
 upwards from the ground.  As you keep going, the mist gets thicker.
 And more solid.  After five steps, it feels like you're trying to push
 through a pillow.  After ten steps, you can't go any farther.
 Disgruntled, you finally must retreat.

>go west
 You walk until you see the mushrooms ahead.

 The figment of you walks along beside you, his footsteps making no
 sound.
 Zippy trots along by your side.
 Polly walks along on your other side, moving slowly but somehow keeping
 up.
 Amidst the mushrooms
    Your strange state of mind makes the mushrooms even more peculiar
 than they already are.  Or perhaps now they're normal, because you're
 strange ...  In any case, they seem to loom over you, colors ranging
 from bright to menacing, and sometimes changing even as you look at
 them.  The path of the river splits, one branch meandering south as the
 main river continues to run east-west.  Between two dusky red
 mushrooms, a large silver spiderweb has been spun.
    You, or a long-lost twin at least, are standing here.
    Zippy, your pet dog, is scampering around here.
    Your great-aunt Polly is here, her eyes twinkling merrily at you.

>go west
 You walk until you reach the base of a waterfall.

 The figment of you walks along beside you, his footsteps making no
 sound.
 Zippy trots along by your side.
 Polly walks along on your other side, moving slowly but somehow keeping
 up.
 At base of cliff
    In your slightly altered state, the waterfall seems to flow with
 bright diamonds that crash to earth only to twist into a river of
 shining silver.  The rocks now form a maze that you could lose yourself
 in if you aren't extra-careful.  Tufts of green grass, glowing with
 life, sprout in between the stones, and the roar of the water is loud
 in your ears.  The cliff is impassible to the west (unless you want to
 climb it), but the other directions are all possible.
    You, or a long-lost twin at least, are standing here.
    Zippy, your pet dog, is scampering around here.
    Your great-aunt Polly is here, her eyes twinkling merrily at you.

>examine maze
 The twisted paths wind their crazy way between the rocks.

>ask polly about maze
 The twisted paths aren't important.

>go east
 You walk eastwards.  The river leads into a grove of technicolor
 mushrooms.

 The figment of you walks along beside you, his footsteps making no

 Zippy trots along by your side.
 Polly walks along on your other side, moving slowly but somehow keeping

>examine mushrooms
 Yes, they're giant mushrooms.  Perhaps a dozen feet high, with broad
 caps that block out much of the sunlight.  All different colors, and
 many have spots and splotches of various hues, too.  Still, the dim
 light makes them look shadowy and strange rather than ridiculous.  A
 spiderweb hangs from between two giant red mushrooms.

>climb them
 giant mushrooms:  The mushrooms are too slippery, and there are no
 footholds available.

 Eventually the mushroom patch ends, and the river widens.

    Zippy, your pet dog, is scampering around here.
    Your great-aunt Polly is here, her eyes twinkling merrily at you.

>take fish
 You reach out a hand to grab a fish.  The fish begin to swim more
 quickly, going round and round in circles.  As you get closer, their
 motion becomes more frantic.  It's as if some special is about to
 happen.  Suddenly, one fish jumps out of the water, just a little ways.
 Then a second follows.  Then another, and another.  Soon all the fish
 are leaping out of the water and falling.  You stop, amazed.  The
 lightfish keep jumping.  Very quickly, the jumping becomes more
 organized.  The fish are actually forming lines in the water to jump.
 So many fish are jumping, you wonder how the river could possibly
 contain them all.  Each fish leaps, arcs overhead up almost six feet,
 and then splashes into the water again.  So many are jumping that the
 individual forms become indistinguishable.  It's as if there's just a
 single arch of glowing light, rising from the water.  And it is an
 arch, or rather, a doorway.  The air within the arch suddenly goes inky
 black.  The stark contrast to the lighted edge is amazing.  Within the
 blackness, you see a few harsh points of light, stars.  But all the
 rest is pure ebony darkness.  The fish continue their jumping.  The
 arch beckons.

>enter arch
 You take a step towards the archway.  Below you, the water rushes away
 from your feet, leaving a dry path to walk upon.  The arch seems to
 glow even more.  The second step brings you closer, and the third step
 is through the gate.  "Goodbye, boy," Polly calls, her voice thin and
 weak.  Zippy barks once, and then all sound is shut out as you pass
 into the archway.
 The sun winks out immediately, replaced by black.  Harsh stars glow in
 the silent sky.  The wind is cold.  You land on ice.

 On a frozen lake
    A chill wind whips you as you stand on the icy surface here.  In all
 directions, you see only ice, stretching out even to the horizon.  No
 tracks mark the ground ...  perhaps you are the only person ever to
 have come here.  The sky is black, and the only light is starlight from
 the strange constellations above your head.

>SAVE
>cf5
 Saved.

>examine stars
 The harshly bright stars form patterns, but not any constellations you
 have ever seen outside of dreams.

>read stars
 The stars aren't important.  It is eerily quiet here.  The wind makes
 no sound, and the stars above are silent.  Only the small, small
 scraping of your feet on the ice can be heard.  Then, overhead, a star
 gleams.

>examine star
 A single star directly above you seems to glow brighter than the rest.
 The star begins to streak across the sky, leaving a silver trail behind
 it.  In fact, it seems to be getting closer, increasing in size.

>again
 The star is huge, as big as the moon, and just as pale white.  The star
 is so big!  It must surely swallow up the lake and everyone on it!
 Until, in a flash of light, it is gone.  And you are no longer alone.

>look
 On a frozen lake
    A chill wind whips you as you stand on the icy surface here.  In all
 directions, you see only ice, stretching out even to the horizon.  No
 tracks mark the ground ...  perhaps you are the only person ever to
 have come here.  The sky is black, and the only light is starlight from
 the strange constellations above your head.
    A tall figure in shimmering white stands here.  You suddenly realize
 this is Daniel.

>examine daniel
 Daniel is humanoid, perhaps seven feet in height, and cloaked in
 shimmering white robes.  His eyes are deeper than those of any mortal
 you have ever seen, but even they are not deep enough to contain the
 infinite wisdom and infinite sorrow you see inside.  Daniel looks at
 you for a minute, then smiles softly.  He begins to speak.
    "I'm glad you've come.  I suppose you'd like a little explanation
 now?"
    "Well, yes, I would --" you start to say, only to realize that's not
 what you're actually asking.  The small words that somehow tumble out
 of your mouth are "Daniel ...  are you ...  y'know .  .  .  God?"
    He smiles that smile at you again, and shakes his head.  A hand
 reaches out to brush your hair softly.  "No, child, I'm not God.  Only
 .  .  only a fallen angel."  The look of regret in his eyes is almost
 more than you can bear.
    "But let me explain things a little better for you.  You're
 confused, tired, scared.  Let me help."  Daniel's smile this time is
 dazzling, not tired.  "Let me help you."

>roll eyes
 I don't know the word "roll".

>wait
 Time passes...
    "To begin with -- where to begin with?  Let me tell you a story.  In
 the beginning, my son, it is said that when humans were just beginning
 to live on the earth, there were the angels in heaven.  And the angels
 looked down on the humans, and laughed to see their petty squabbling,
 their jealousies, their wars, their many imperfections.  The things
 that made them mortal.  And the angels would look at one another, and
 mock the humans on earth, and talk about how much better *they* could
 do if they were down there.  One day, they were given their chance.
 God took the four most boastful of the angels, and sent them down to
 earth.  "Go and live amongst the humans," God said, "And return to Me
 in a year and a day, to say what you have learned."  So the angels came
 to earth.  And though their descent had stripped their magic from them,
 the angels were still fair of face, strong and noble of body, and
 goodly to look upon.  And the angels walked amongst the people, and saw
 them as mortals see each other."

>wait
 Time passes...
    "The angels tarried with the people for less than a fortnight before
 they had established themselves as braver, nobler, more beautiful,
 stronger, in all ways better than the humans.  Or so they believed.
 Drunk on flattery from their new-found admirers (for among the angels
 in heaven, their attributes were nothing special), the four angels
 married the sons and daughters of the people, and made residence with
 them.  There was much rejoicing in the houses that the former angels
 joined, and much celebration.  Wine was brought out, a thing the
 children of the sky had never tasted before.  There was merrymaking and
 great feasting.
    The angels lived on earth for many months.  In that time, they lost
 all the virtues that they had come with.  One took to brigandry, using
 his strength and cunning to waylay and rob the rich and terrorize and
 abuse the poor and helpless.  One took to gambling -- her near-divine
 intuition was unsurpassed, and when that failed her, her marked cards
 and easy blackmail did not.  The third became a war- lord, and she
 sought to conquer all the world.  The last became a sorcerer,
 performing dark rites and blood sacrifices for power to replace that
 which he had lost in his fall from heaven."

>wait
 Time passes...
    "So the days passed, and so the months passed, and so the year
 passed.  Finally, the entire year ended.  In but two hours, the final
 day would end as well, and the angels' stay on earth would end.  And
 none of the four remembered, none recalled, none cared.  So, when the
 call came and they flew up to the sky, their mortal baggage was brought
 along.  Raphael still held his daggers and looted gold, and the scars
 that he had gained.  Lilith still clasped a palmed die in one hand, and
 a wine-skin in the other.  Jaela held her sword, steeped in the tears
 of the innocent.  And Daniel --" Daniel's voice chokes for a minute,
 then he continues.  "Daniel still held his black book of sorcery, and
 his sacrificial dagger, wet with baby's blood.  God gazed upon the four
 angels, and the angels gazed upon themselves.  And they were ashamed.
 God spoke to them, and to the assembled angels.  "I reject thee, now.
 Because of the pridefulness that is within all, heaven's gates are
 closed to you forevermore.  Go forth, back to the lands from whence you
 came.  You are angels no more."
    The four who had gone to earth took special punishment.  Raphael was
 sent, in his strength, to hold the Earth in its course.  Lilith, in her
 cunning, was sent to tease the rivers into their courses, and the seas
 into their proper basins.  Jaela, with her might, was given the storms
 and skies to oversee, for all eternity.  And Daniel was sent forth to
 the stars, a lonely wanderer, forevermore."

>wait
 Time passes...
    Daniel stares at you for an instant, almost fiercely.  "That is one
 story that is told," he says, "And I have another, perhaps true also.
 A shorter one, this time:  Humans have never been alone in the
 universe.  There have been those who live under other skies, and even
 of those there have been some who sought out for other species like
 themselves.  But space is vast, more vast that can be comprehended, and
 in all time, only one other species has ever found the earth.  It is a
 pity that it was not a noble race.  They have no pronouncable name in
 any of the languages of people, but they care not that no one knows
 their name.  They came across the void of space, seeking slaves and
 treasure.  And they found both on this world.  So they sent down their
 war-ships to capture humans and enslave them, to carry off their riches
 and precious stones.  Humanity was threatened, and would have died.
    But then three angels emerged, out into the light of redemption.
 Striking out at the invaders, they seemed unstoppable.  They had been
 stripped of much power, but still had great resource remaining.
 Raphael cast mountains against the invaders, rended their ships in
 twain with bare hands, struck missiles from their paths, before being
 crushed to earth by a great cannon-blast from the main ship.  Lilith
 sent the rivers out to battle, great tsunamis to knock ships from the
 air and blind their gunners, until she too was laid low by the enemy.
 Jaela Storm-lord, strongest of the three, sent lighting and thunder and
 tornados to rage against them, and finally forced them to flee.  But as
 they left, a treacherous energy bomb struck her, and the third of the
 angels fell."
    Daniel pauses for a minute, and you can't help asking "What of D-
 What of the fourth angel?"
    "He arrived too late.  He was not on Earth, as the others were, and
 so he could not stand with them.  Daniel arrived only in time to hear
 his friends' dying words, and to swear a blood-oath to continue their
 struggle.  Because he had failed to protect them, failed to be there
 when they were, he swore to continue the mission that they had died to
 complete.  He would now protect Earth as they had.  So Daniel took
 people from Earth, and taught them all the secrets that he knew.  He
 gave them his magic, his strength, all his power.  And then he sent
 them back to live among the people until they were needed, until the
 invaders threatened earth a second time.  After that was complete,
 Daniel went away, to a land outside of the reality you live in, to sit
 and think, and reflect on his life.  Never more would the angels walk
 on earth.  But perhaps the sins of three had been accounted for."

>wait
 Time passes...
    "As you may have realized, you are a chosen one, a Phoenix.  Within
 you is the potential for great power, and much magic.  When the need is
 here, you must awaken it.  And the need *is* here.  Earth is
 threatened.  This time, it is from within.  Evil works through man,
 this time, through bribed senators and corporate thugs.  The world
 leadership is almost all either unknowingly or knowingly helping evil,
 preparing the way for the enemy to take over.  Because the invaders are
 here again too.
    They were driven off once by angels, but now they have returned, and
 there are no angels left who can stand against them.  Only mortals.
 Phoenix, you must rise up.  Already, *They* recognize you for what you
 are.  Already, they have struck against you.  I think you know when.
 The last time was on the cliff.  They had hoped to kill you, and
 eliminate the final threat, but you were snatched out of reality for an
 instant.  I hastily pulled together snatches of Reality and wove them
 into a place for you to stay in.  The action took great effort, and I
 am very tired.  But I was tired before.  I brought you here because you
 must awaken.  And perhaps so that you can see Truth a bit more clearly.
    It is true that the invaders have been working against you, yet many
 of the troubles in your life are your own doing, you know.  Before you
 return home, you must confront them, and yourself.  Then you can fly as
 a Phoenix must, because only a Phoenix can save the world now.
    This place--" Daniel gestures with one shapely hand "is not quite
 the same as where you were before.  The spider venom should have killed
 you, as should the huge dose of mushroom that you took.  But instead,
 you came to me, to this dream-land that I live in.  In a minute, I will
 put you back in to the place you left, and give you some time to finish
 thinking about things.  But first, perhaps you have some questions
 about things?"

>ask daniel about tree
    "Ah, yes.  A bit rude, but a heart of gold.  I think."

>ask daniel about gazebo
    "I rather like the gazebo.  It's dreadfully symbolic, and quite
 pleasant to spend time in.  Or on top of.  I never did get around to
 putting a proper stairway to the roof though."

>ask daniel about sun
    "I think you've noticed the sun doesn't move.  Time is different
 here -- it's more under your control.  You'll understand in a bit, I
 expect."

>ask daniel about waterfall
    "The river symbolizes life, in a way.  It springs from nowhere and
 goes to nowhere when it ends.  'Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, as it
 were.'"  Daniel pauses for a minute.  "Before you leave here, you will
 have to stop the river."

>ask daniel about hole
    "I'm sorry," Daniel says, "But I don't understand what you mean."

>ask daniel about robin
    "A bit too symbolic, perhaps."

>ask daniel about magnet
    "I'm sorry," Daniel says, "But I don't understand what you mean."
    Daniel frowns suddenly, glancing upwards at the stars.  "It's time
 for you to go," he says.
    Daniel gestures, and an arch appears.  This one is shining silver,
 like the stars overhead.  He points, and you step through.  The lake,
 the sky, the wind, everything dissolves.  Daniel's parting words drift
 after you, as he too vanishes:  "My regards to your father ..."

 By a wide stream
    This is a clearing in the middle of a forest.  Tall trees grow all
 around, moss hangs from their branches, and there are scattered
 flowers.  A stream runs through the forest here.  It is wide but
 shallow, allowing you to see the granite ground below it.  Small bits
 of quartz are embedded everywhere in the granite, and they sparkle and
 glimmer as the sunlight shines on the moving water.  Strange glowing
 fish are swimming around quite happily in the water.  Many are swimming
 against the current, seemingly without effort.  The stream passes into
 the forest to the east, and is quickly lost amongst the trees.
    Your father stands here.

>examine father
    Yes, it's your father.  The man that left you when you were only six
 years old, leaving nothing but memories behind.  He never, ever even
 bothered to call, even on your birthdays.  Your mother never talked
 about him much, but when you got older, you realized his departure was
 probably responsible for her drinking problem, at the very least.
 Bastard.
    The years seemed to have aged him deeper than they should have, but
 of course it's hard to tell.  His eyes are still the same burning blue
 that you remember from long-ago dreams.
    "Hello, son."  Your eyes open wide as you seen the man.
    "D-D-Dad?  Is that you?"
    Your father nods, slowly.  "Yeah, it's me."  He looks at you.
 "You've grown up."
    Anger returns, almost involuntarily, as he speaks.  "Yes, I have.
 But you wouldn't know, would you?  You never came to see me."  Your
 voice is already trembling.
    He looks pained, and suddenly shivers.  He starts to speak, stops,
 and starts again.  "I, I, I can't say much except ...  'sorry'?"
    You interrupt his next words with a shout.  "Sorry?  Sorry???  You
 bastard, you left me alone, left Mom to drown her sorrows with all her
 fucking six-packs, and all you can say is 'sorry'??"
    Your father seems staggered by the outburst.  Each word strikes him
 like a blow.  "I *am* sorry, so very very sorry.  I just couldn't
 handle it.  Having a child, losing my job ...  I stuck it out as long
 as I could, and then I ran.  Left one night, walked out the door, never
 came back ...  I'm sorry."  He seems close to tears.
    "Dammit, Dad, how could you do this?  Coward."  He shrinks away as
 you talk. You keep going, forcing him back.  "You left me.  You
 abandoned us.  You sent my life into a tailspin.  Me, the last hope for
 this crazy planet, me, the Phoenix, you ruined me.  You realize what
 you've done?"
    Your father stands up straight then, and looks at you for a long
 minute.  When he speaks, his voice is firm again, and clear.  "I'm
 sorry.  It was inexcusable.  I had no right to run.  But you don't
 either."
    "What?  What the hell are you talking about?  You're the problem
 here, not me."
    "Son, listen to me.  *Listen* to me.  When I ran, it was running
 away from myself.  You see ...  the Phoenix is carried by bloodlines.
 When I was young, I was Phoenix too."
    You are too shocked to speak, so he continues.  "Yeah, that's right.
 The Phoenix is genetic.  But it fades as you get older, passes along to
 the young and vigorous.  Your great-aunt had it too, though not as
 strong as I saw it in you.  Don't you see why I ran?  I knew what my
 childhood was like ...  things going wrong for me in school, at home,
 the accident that took both *my* parents away.  I couldn't bear it
 twice, to see it happen to my child as They tried to get him too.  I
 just couldn't.  So I ran away.  Maybe I hoped, even, to draw Them away
 from you.  I was just playing into Their hands, I realize now, but I
 was still pretty young then.  So I ran from you, ran from
 responsibility, ran from the Phoenix.  My gift never awakened.  I never
 flew.  You've got to fly now, son, because I never could."
    A quick pause, and he speaks again.  "I've been able to watch you a
 few times, as you grew up.  I saw you take the same paths I took,
 suffer the same things I did.  And I was never able to warn you.  It
 was agony.  Finally, They did get me after all -- a mistaken drive-by
 shooting, the police said -- and Daniel came to collect me.  *You* have
 got to break the pattern now.  Leave the cycle, and go fly free."  His
 voice stumbles to the end of the speech, and he takes a long shuddering
 breath.  "Break the cycle.  For me."  His hand stretches out to you.
 You slowly raise yours to meet his shadowy touch.  It is like touching
 air, almost, but not quite.
    "I forgive you, Dad."  The words bring sweet release as you say
 them, starting the healing of too many lost years.
    He smiles, the first smile of his you've seen since you were six.
 "Thanks." His hand reaches into his pocket, and he pulls something out.
 It drops onto the ground and rolls to your feet.  A bit of a grin comes
 to your father's face, and he says "Bust things wide open."  He looks
 at you for a long time, and then says one last word.  "Goodbye."
 Already, he is fading, and before the echo of the word has disappeared,
 he is no longer there.  Your father is gone, forever.
    "'Bye, Dad."  You speak to the empty air, then bend down to see what
 he left you.
    It seems to be one of the relics of the army stuff you remember he
 used to collect:  a hand grenade.  A curious gift, but surely he would
 have known what you needed right now.

>examine grenade
 It's a hand grenade.  Vaguely oval-shaped, and roughly the size of an
 apple.  You remember your dad used to collect them before - well,
 before he left.  Seems to be in working condition, too.  Of course,
 there's only one way to find out, and that's pulling the pin .  .  .

 You walk until you see the mushrooms ahead.

 Amidst the mushrooms
    On either bank of the river, stretching high into the sky, are giant
 mushrooms.  Giant technicolored mushrooms.  Red and blue and yellow and
 green and purple, and most are splotched with splashes of other colors.
 The mushrooms tower at least a dozen feet above you, perhaps more, and
 their outstretched caps block out most of the sun.  You can see there
 is a split in the now-sluggish stream here, one branch going south and
 the main branch running east-west.  Between two dusky red mushrooms, a
 large silver spiderweb has been spun.

>go south
 You follow the river branch to the south.

 End of path
    The river from the mushroom forest ends here.  It drains into a
 small hole in the ground, making a quiet gurgling noise as it does so.
 Meanwhile, the ground around it has become more muddy, and the
 mushrooms have disappeared.  They have been replaced with tangled
 bushes that block the way in all directions except back north.

 ground-level, followed by a muffled cracking noise.  Then a sound like
 water rushing, far away.  A few seconds later, a gurgling noise
 attracts your attention, and you look over at the stream.  The water is
 rushing away over the granite, leaving the bare rock exposed.  Within
 moments, the stream has vanished.

 You walk until you reach the base of a waterfall.

 At base of cliff
    The river used to flow from here, when the waterfall was still
 working.  Now it's ceased, and so has the river, leaving only a rocky
 stream bed behind.  The wild grasses still poke out between the rocks,
 though, just like before.  The cliff is impassible to the west (unless
 you want to climb it), but the other directions are all possible.

>climb cliff
 You carefully grip a jutting-out rock, and begin the climb.

 Climbing the cliff
    You are climbing on the rocky cliff face.  The waterfall is no
 longer here, but the rocks are still a bit damp.  Below you are
 scattered rocks and such, and scattered tufts of grass.  Nearby, a
 small cave leads into the cliff and darkness.

>in
 You cautiously enter the cave.

 Small cave
    It's not as dark in here as it looks from the outside.  Some
 sunlight still filters into the cave to illuminate the (stone) floor.
 The exit is east.

 The only way out seems to be to go out through the cave mouth.


>examine cave
 I don't see any cave here.

 The floor is your basic stone cave flooring, not much carpet or
 linoleum or the like.  There is, however, a small knob set into the
 floor here.  There's nothing on the ground.

>examine knob
 It's one of those enticing-looking small knobs you see around.  It's
 just asking to be pulled.

>pull it
 You give the knob a tug.  It sticks for a second, and then slides out a
 short distance.  Almost immediately afterwards, the wall in front of
 you opens, the floor tilts, and you tumble forwards into darkness .  .

 garden there is a fountain, shaped like a dragon's head.  From the
 dragon's open mouth flows a steady stream of water, falling into the
 brook.
    The hedge beasts are curled up on the ground, practically
 indistinguishable from the normal hedges.

>push blue button
 There is a brief hum from one or two machines, and then a light blinks
 on.  You hear a nearby gurgling noise, and then a sound like a thousand
 toilets being flushed.  The nearly omni-present sound of moving water
 abruptly ceases.

>examine dragon
 I don't see any dragon here.

>turn black to 3
 Okay, it's now turned to 3.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  An open field
    This is an open field, with a few boulders and the like scattered
 about.  In the center of the field, someone has constructed a white
 gazebo, its shadow providing perhaps the only real shade in the area.
 A muddy streak slashes through the field north-south, where the water
 used to be.  A wide white plank allows you to cross from one bank to
 the other.  Sticking out of the ground is a stone pillar, a control
 panel and joystick built into its side.

>turn black to 4
 Okay, it's now turned to 4.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  Inside the gazebo
    The gazebo has six sides, one of which is open to allow you to
 enter.  The other five are walled off with thick lattices which prevent
 both sunlight and egress in those directions, making it fairly dim in
 here.  A bronze sundial in the center of the room is the most
 impressive thing in sight, but there's also an ordinary table against
 one wall.  Also, set into the ceiling, you can see a multi-faceted
 crystal.

>turn black to 5
 Okay, it's now turned to 5.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a new place:  Atop the gazebo
    This is the roof of the gazebo.  The floor (well, roof) below is not
 latticed like the walls, so it must be quite dark inside.  A wall,
 about six feet high, has been constructed across the gazebo-top.  It
 has no apparent purpose (since you can walk around it to reach the
 other side of the roof), except to hold a bronze weather vane on top of
 it.  The only good exit from here is to climb down the sides.
 Something hanging on the weather vane glints in the sunlight.
    From up here, you have a view of the open field.  Still, it seems
 that you cannot see quite as far as you should be able to, and the view
 is distorted and shadowy beyond the edges of the grass.
    Hanging from the bronze weather vane is a golden chain with sphere.

>turn black to 6
 Okay, it's now turned to 6.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  Cliff top
    The area is fairly rocky here, with scattered grasses growing
 between cracks in the rocks.  The stream that flowed here once no
 longer does, and the cliff-face looks quite bare without the waterfall.

>turn black to 7
 Okay, it's now turned to 7.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  Climbing the cliff
    You are climbing on the rocky cliff face.  The waterfall is no
 longer here, but the rocks are still a bit damp.  Below you are
 scattered rocks and such, and scattered tufts of grass.  Nearby, a
 small cave leads into the cliff and darkness.

>turn black to 8
 Okay, it's now turned to 8.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  At base of cliff
    The river used to flow from here, when the waterfall was still
 working.  Now it's ceased, and so has the river, leaving only a rocky
 stream bed behind.  The wild grasses still poke out between the rocks,
 though, just like before.  The cliff is impassible to the west (unless
 you want to climb it), but the other directions are all possible.

>turn black to 9
 Okay, it's now turned to 9.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  Amidst the mushrooms
    On either bank of the river, stretching high into the sky, are giant
 mushrooms.  Giant technicolored mushrooms.  Red and blue and yellow and
 green and purple, and most are splotched with splashes of other colors.
 The mushrooms tower at least a dozen feet above you, perhaps more, and
 their outstretched caps block out most of the sun.  You can see only
 muddy puddles where the stream once drifted.  Between two dusky red
 mushrooms, a large silver spiderweb has been spun.

>turn black to 10
 Okay, it's now turned to 10.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  End of path
    Mud, and more mud, surrounds the hole in the ground here.  Tangled
 bushes block the way in all directions except north, and there is no
 sign of the stream.

>turn black to 11
 Okay, it's now turned to 11.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  By an empty stream-bed
    This is a clearing in the middle of a forest.  Tall trees grow all
 around, moss hangs from their branches, and there are scattered
 flowers.  A wide stream-bed runs through the forest, strangely devoid
 of water.  It is granite, with small pieces of quartz embedded, that
 shimmer in the sunlight.

>turn black to 12
 Okay, it's now turned to 12.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  A burning desert
    Just looking at the scorched and blasted terrain is enough to make
 you gasp for water.  The sun beats down all around with no hope of
 shade or any other respite, and there are no land-marks in sight in any
 direction.

 Control Central, in the comfy chair
    Well, if you've ever wondered what was going on, you seem to have
 found the place where whatever it is that is going on happens.  Lots of
 machines are scattered around the room, some making endearing bleeping

 A muddy streak slashes through the field north-south, where the water

 the other.  Sticking out of the ground is a stone pillar, a control
 panel and joystick built into its side.

>examine plank
 You can walk across this plank to reach the opposite part of the field.

>get plank
 The wide white plank isn't important.

>examine panel
 A control panel, set into a pillar which juts from the ground.  The
 panel is very simple:  it contains only a joystick (which can be pulled
 left or pushed right), and a status meter.  The status meter currently
 has 4 blocks filled out of eleven.

>pull joystick
 You pull the joystick to the left.
 One block disappears on the status bar.  Something seems different
 about the area once you look up from the panel.  Rubbing your eyes, you
 suddenly realize what it is.  The shadows have changed.  A look upwards
 confirms it:  The sun has moved.
 The shadow of the gazebo moves slowly across the field, as the sun
 strikes the gazebo from a new angle.

 In a garden
    A beautiful garden, bounded by brick walls to the north and west.
 Alas, the stream that flowed once is no longer here, and the dragon's
 head fountain no longer spouts water.  The bushes and flowers remain,
 but they droop sadly around the muddy ditch where the stream was.
    The hedge beasts are curled up on the ground, practically
 indistinguishable from the normal hedges.  Slowly, the hedge beasts
 start to move again.  Leaves start to twist and vines begin to wrap
 around things as the hedge beasts prepare to begin work.

>examine dragon
 The fountain, as has been mentioned, is made of stone, and shaped like
 the head of a dragon.  The inside of the mouth is damp, but no water
 emerges.

>examine beasts
 Well, I guess they aren't just your ordinary hedges.  Definitely a
 close relative, however, as the hedge beasts still seem to have leaves
 and branches and such.  The hedge beasts are slowly shifting positions
 as they prepare to move.
 Slowly, the hedge beasts begin work again.  One reaches under a bush to
 retrieve the gardening tools, and hands them (or vines them, I suppose)
 out to the others.  Soon they are industriously raking the paths and
 pruning the plants.

>take bucket

 The hedge beasts seem to be getting sleepier.  Their movements grow
 slower and slower.  One carefully wipes off the tools on its leaves,
 and replaces them under a convenient bush.  The hedge beasts' movements
 continue to slow until they stop altogether.  They're practically
 indistinguishable from the other bushes again.

>take tools
 I don't know the word "tools".

>look under bush
 You search under the bushes.  Besides a lot of dead leaves and such,
 you find some of the hedge beasts' gardening tools.  A large wooden
 bucket, a strange leaf-spade, and a thorny rake, to be precise.
 large wooden bucket:  Taken.
 strange leaf-spade:  Your load is too heavy.

>put marble on gnomon
 There's no good surface on the bronze gnomon.

>examine crystal
 Which crystal do you mean, the large crystal, or the tiny crystal?

>large
 The large crystal has six visible facets.  It is set into the ceiling,
 directly over the sundial.  It is dark, and seems somehow sad.

>put marble on tiny crystal
 There's no good surface on the tiny crystal.

>examine sundial
 It's a bronze sundial, on a pedestal.  A rather nice sundial too, by
 the looks of it.  It's a pity there's no real sunlight to make it
 useful.  The inscription "Tempus Non Fugit" has been printed around the
 face of the sundial, and there are also six small metal studs set into
 the bronzework.  In the dim light, you notice the sparkle of a tiny
 crystal on the tip of the gnomon.

>examine gnomon
 A gnomon, of course, is the thingy on the sundial which casts the
 shadow.  This gnomon appears no different from any other one you've
 seen, except that most gnomons don't have tiny crystals on their tips.
 Whereas this one seems positively festooned with them.  Well, it has
 one of them, anyway.

 I don't see much of a purpose to that.

>put magnet on six stud
 With a small *clink* noise, the magnet suddenly adheres itself to the
 stud at six o'clock.

>put marble on twelve
 I don't see much of a purpose to that.

>turn magnet
 Turning the small black magnet (attached to the stud at six o'clock)
 doesn't have any effect.

 I don't know how to put anything on the number 8.

>put magnet on eight
 With a small *clink* noise, the magnet suddenly adheres itself to the
 stud at eight o'clock.

>examine gnomon
 A gnomon, of course, is the thingy on the sundial which casts the
 shadow.  This gnomon appears no different from any other one you've
 seen, except that most gnomons don't have tiny crystals on their tips.
 Whereas this one seems positively festooned with them.  Well, it has
 one of them, anyway.

>take it
 You can't have the bronze gnomon.

>examine sundial
 It's a bronze sundial, on a pedestal.  A rather nice sundial too, by
 the looks of it.  It's a pity there's no real sunlight to make it
 useful.  The inscription "Tempus Non Fugit" has been printed around the
 face of the sundial, and there are also six holes cut into the bronze
 (formerly covered by metal caps).  In the dim light, you notice the
 sparkle of a tiny crystal on the tip of the gnomon.

>take sundial
 You can't have the bronze sundial.

>inventory
 You have a music box, a sun-bleached skull, a piece of paper, a small
 remote, a golden chain with sphere, six ordinary metal studs, and a
 small black magnet.

>examine hole
 Which hole do you mean, the hole at six o'clock, the hole at eight
 o'clock, the hole at ten o'clock, the hole at twelve o'clock, the hole
 at two o'clock, or the hole at four o'clock?

>six
 It's a small hole in the bronzework, perhaps an inch across, located at
 six o'clock.

>put marble in six
 You lower the sphere into the hole, holding onto the chain.  It drops
 about four inches before it touches bottom.  An instant after it makes
 contact, there is a chime from the hole.  The deep vibrating chime is
 accompanied by a shaft of shining light.  The deep violet light shoots
 from the hole, passing through the sphere.  It bends as it goes through
 the sphere, angling so that it flies upwards and strikes the large
 crystal in the ceiling.  Briefly, the large crystal shimmers with the
 color.  At the same time, it echoes the sound -- at a higher pitch.
 Finally, all is silent again.  You cautiously pull the sphere from the
 hole.  The sparks of color inside seem to be whirling faster than
 before.

>put marble in eight
 You lower the sphere into the hole, holding onto the chain.  It drops
 about four inches before it touches bottom.  An instant after it makes
 contact, there is a chime from the hole.  The low sonorous note is
 accompanied by a shaft of shining light.  The stunning blue light
 shoots from the hole, passing through the sphere.  It bends as it goes
 through the sphere, angling so that it flies upwards and strikes the
 large crystal in the ceiling.  Briefly, the large crystal shimmers with
 the color.  At the same time, it echoes the sound -- at a higher pitch.
 Finally, all is silent again.  You cautiously pull the sphere from the

>put marble in ten
 You lower the sphere into the hole, holding onto the chain.  It drops
 about four inches before it touches bottom.  An instant after it makes
 contact, there is a chime from the hole.  The full, clear tone is
 accompanied by a shaft of shining light.  The verdant green light
 shoots from the hole, passing through the sphere.  It bends as it goes
 through the sphere, angling so that it flies upwards and strikes the
 large crystal in the ceiling.  Briefly, the large crystal shimmers with
 the color.  At the same time, it echoes the sound -- at a higher pitch.
 Finally, all is silent again.  You cautiously pull the sphere from the
 hole.  The sparks of color inside seem to be whirling faster than

>put marble in twelve
 You lower the sphere into the hole, holding onto the chain.  It drops
 about four inches before it touches bottom.  An instant after it makes
 contact, there is a chime from the hole.  The lilting high tone is
 accompanied by a shaft of shining light.  The shining yellow light
 shoots from the hole, passing through the sphere.  It bends as it goes
 through the sphere, angling so that it flies upwards and strikes the
 large crystal in the ceiling.  Briefly, the large crystal shimmers with
 the color.  At the same time, it echoes the sound -- at a higher pitch.
 Finally, all is silent again.  You cautiously pull the sphere from the
 hole.  The sparks of color inside seem to be whirling faster than
 before.

>put marble in two
 You lower the sphere into the hole, holding onto the chain.  It drops
 about four inches before it touches bottom.  An instant after it makes
 contact, there is a chime from the hole.  The pure whistling tone is
 accompanied by a shaft of shining light.  The rich orange light shoots
 from the hole, passing through the sphere.  It bends as it goes through
 the sphere, angling so that it flies upwards and strikes the large
 crystal in the ceiling.  Briefly, the large crystal shimmers with the
 color.  At the same time, it echoes the sound -- at a higher pitch.
 Finally, all is silent again.  You cautiously pull the sphere from the
 hole.  The sparks of color inside seem to be whirling faster than
 before.

>put marble in four
 You lower the sphere into the hole, holding onto the chain.  It drops
 about four inches before it touches bottom.  An instant after it makes
 contact, there is a chime from the hole.  The achingly beautiful chime
 is accompanied by a shaft of shining light.  The flaming red light
 shoots from the hole, passing through the sphere.  It bends as it goes
 through the sphere, angling so that it flies upwards and strikes the
 large crystal in the ceiling.  Briefly, the large crystal shimmers with
 the color.  At the same time, it echoes the sound -- at a higher pitch.
    Unlike the other times, the music does not end here.  Rather, the
 tiny crystal on the gnomon vibrates, giving the sound a third time at
 an even higher pitch.  A pure white column of light flashes downwards,
 stretching from the crystal in the ceiling to the crystal on the
 gnomon.  And when the light strikes the tiny crystal, it splits into
 six parts, each one spreading outwards to touch a hole.  From the
 holes, six lines of color reach upwards to the ceiling crystal again,
 and again they form a single pure white column falling downwards.  The
 effect is that of a pillar of shining rainbow, with a heart of glowing
 white.
    Somehow, the sound reflects the visual, and the crystals are fairly
 purring with the growing tone.  The tone grows and grows and soon your
 whole body is humming with it, and the rainbow tower is shining forth
 into the darkness around it, and then there is a blinding/deafening
 explosion of noise and color.
    You blink your eyes and look around, pulling the sphere from the
 hole again. The round crystal has lost the internal sparks, and is a
 dull lusterless gray.  The other two crystals are nowhere to be seen.
    A sudden grating sound from above your head attracts your attention.
 Looking upwards, you can see that the ceiling is retracting -- warm
 sunlight floods into the room.
    The floor of the gazebo suddenly tilts slightly, and then tips back
 the other way.

>look
 Inside the gazebo
    The gazebo has six sides, one of which is open to allow you to
 enter.  The other five are walled off with thick lattices which prevent
 both sunlight and egress in those directions, but the open roof makes
 it quite sunny in here.  A bronze sundial in the center of the room is
 the most impressive thing in sight, but there's also an ordinary table
 against one wall.
    The tilting becomes more severe.  There is an abrupt lurch, and the
 gazebo surges upwards.  Looking outside, you can see the grass falling
 away as the gazebo starts to move up into the air.

>out
 You exit the gazebo (climbing down the rope ladder).

 An open field
    This is an open field, with a few boulders and the like scattered
 about.  In the center of the field, someone has constructed a white
 gazebo (currently floating above the ground), its shadow providing
 perhaps the only real shade in the area.  A muddy streak slashes
 through the field north-south, where the water used to be.  A wide
 white plank allows you to cross from one bank to the other.  Sticking
 out of the ground is a stone pillar, a control panel and joystick built
 into its side.
    You see a small fly, a grenade pin, an apple, and a thorny rake
 here.
    The gazebo continues to soar into the air.  When it finally stops,
 it is hanging about four meters off the ground, still with no apparent
 means of support.  The rope ladder dangles down from the entrance, just
 about brushing the grass.     Meanwhile, of course, the upward motion
 of the gazebo also affects its shadow, which is now such that the
 shadow of the gazebo falls between the second and third rocks.

    The gazebo continues to sway, and then as if it suddenly came to a
 decision, it drifts up into the air, leaving a patch of dirt and dead
 grass behind.  A rope ladder tumbles out from underneath the gazebo,
 attached at one end to the lintel of the entrance.  (There's no
 provision in the laws of physics for flying gazebos, but I suppose
 there has to be a first time for everything.  Still, you'd feel a lot
 more at ease with the whole thing if there were something more than
 empty air between the gazebo and the ground.)

>go up
 The only way up from here would be to use the rope ladder hanging down
 from the gazebo.
 (And so you do.)

    The gazebo rises and rises and you continue to stare through the
 lattices in astonishment.  Finally, when it has reached a height of
 three or four meters, it halts.  There is still nothing holding it up,
 as far as you can tell.  Luckily, someone seems to have attached a rope
 ladder to the bottom of the door-way at some point, and you can get
 down that way.  Much safer than jumping, which seems to be your only
 alternative.      Meanwhile, of course, the upward motion of the gazebo
 also affects its shadow, which is now such that the shadow of the

>examine shadow
 The gazebo's shadow is not especially interesting, nor unique as
 shadows go.  Right now, the position of the sun is such that the shadow
 of the gazebo falls between the second and third rocks.

>examine rocks
 They're your basic large, gray chunks of rock.  There's about six in
 the field, arranged in a rough three-quarter circle around around the
 gazebo.

>examine panel
 A control panel, set into a pillar which juts from the ground.  The
 panel is very simple:  it contains only a joystick (which can be pulled
 left or pushed right), and a status meter.  The status meter currently
 has 3 blocks filled out of eleven.

 You pull the joystick to the left.
 One block disappears on the status bar.  Again, there is the peculiar
 sight of shifting shadows as the sun moves across the sky.

    The boulder seems to tremble for an instant as the shadow falls on
 it.  You are almost ready to dismiss it as your imagination when it
 happens again.  With ponderous slowness, the boulder rolls slightly to
 one side, then to the other.  Then it starts to lift into the air,
 perhaps an inch.  You gape.  It continues to rock back and forth and
 raise up until it is several inches off the ground.  You collect your
 wits and walk over to look closer, only to realize what it is. A head
 pops out of the rock and regards you quizzically.  This must be the
 *biggest* turtle you will ever see in your entire life.
    Possibly annoyed about its missing sunlight, the turtle slowly
 shambles out of the field to the west.  Underneath where it lay is a
 ring of dead grass, and in the center, a large hole leads downwards.

>examine hole
 The hole's sides are smooth, but there are indentations in the side to
 allow you to climb down.  It's neither a terribly dark nor a terribly
 deep hole, but it's fairly wide and roomy.

>SAVE

 Saved.

>inventory
 You have a music box, a sun-bleached skull, a piece of paper, a small
 remote, a golden chain with sphere, six ordinary metal studs, and a
 small black magnet.

>examine turtle
 Which turtle do you mean, the weather vane, or the enormous turtle?

>examine enormous
 The turtle isn't here.  It shambled off to the west, and vanished
 (presumably into the desert).

>go west
 You walk for a minute or two, only to feel the ground beginning to slip
 away.  You take a hasty step backwards.

>go west
 You walk forwards, and again feel the sensation of the ground
 vanishing.  A blast of sweltering heat welcomes you to the desert one
 more time.

 A burning desert
    Just looking at the scorched and blasted terrain is enough to make
 you gasp for water.  The sun beats down all around with no hope of
 shade or any other respite, and there are no land-marks in sight in any
 direction.
    The turtle is snoozing in the warm sun.

>examine turtle
 The large turtle is basking happily in the sun.  With all its limbs
 retracted, it is almost indistinguishable from a boulder.

>go east
 You stagger on ahead, baking in the sun.  Finally, you must stop to
 breathe.  Taking a look behind yourself, it is hard to tell that you
 have moved at all.  Already, the hot desert breeze is erasing the signs
 of your passage.

 There are no more visions left for you.  The desert sun is hot and
 painful.

 Abruptly, the desert air seems to swirl around you.  You blink your
 eyes, and when they open again, you're back where you came here from:
 An open field

 out of the ground is a stone pillar, a control panel and joystick built

    You see a small fly, a grenade pin, an apple, and a thorny rake
 here.

>go down
 You climb down into the hole.

 Inside the hole
    This hole is fairly roomy, and about ten feet deep.  Foot-holes in
 the side allow you to climb up into the sunlight.  The floor is dirty,
 but there seems to be something shining beneath the dust.

>examine dust
 I don't know the word "dust".

>examine floor
 Bending down to examine the floor reveals it to actually be a giant
 mirror, covered in years of dust.  The mirror's surface is obscured by
 grime.

>clean mirror
 You set to work cleaning the thing, wiping dust and grime away as best
 you can with your shirt-tails.  By the time you're sweating from the
 effort, the mirror is fairly clean.

>examine mirror
    People used to use the mirror to foretell the future.  That always
 seemed sort of odd.  What the mirror actually does is reflect the one
 who views it, so isn't it far more truthful to have the mirror reflect
 ...  the past?  At least for this mirror, that seems to be true.
 Images begin to drift across the screen, like smoke rising from a fire,
 like clouds floating across the sky, like leaves riding a gentle
 stream-current.

    The first memories are pleasant.  You see your birthday party from
 age five, surrounded by both your parents and a circle of smiling
 friends .  .  .
 You see yourself, age six, with your dog Zippy, him barking madly and
 running in circles around tiny you as you throw sticks for him to fetch
 .  .  .
 There are other easy memories that come to mind, before the pictures
 turn darker.
 You see yourself cradling Zippy's broken and bloody body, crying into
 the dark night on an empty street .  .  .
 You see yourself, age seven, wailing because it is your birthday and
 your dad hasn't called for a year now .  .  .
 You see your mom staggering around the house, blind drunk, cursing and
 stumbling, and you hiding in the corner terrified .  .  .
 "These aren't *my* fault!"  you think, "The invaders, it's all their
 work.  How could they have ruined my life like this?  What did I do to
 deserve my shitty life?"
 Then that excuse is torn away as the pictures in the mirror shift
 again.
 Now you see yourself in high school, sitting at a desk.  Someone comes
 over to ask you a question and you turn your face away with a scowl.
 He retreats, a hurt expression on his face.
 And another scene, your senior year, someone asks you to the prom.
 Incredulous, you refuse, sure it's just a cruel joke.  Later, of
 course, you found out they had been deeply in love with you, but by
 then it was too late.  Too late .  .  .
 College, this time, and more of the same.  In all your classes, people
 try to reach out and are rebuffed.  You stagger through a year, and
 then another, spurning all attempts at friendship.  You flirt with
 alcohol and drugs for a while, finding solace there through a numbed
 mind, but eventually even those pale.

    You stare at each of the memories as they flow across the face of
 the mirror.  Each one pains you, and it is a dual pain:  pain from
 recalling the emotions, and the pain of realization, the pain as you
 see your mistakes for what they are.  More and more images go past,
 each one a scene from your life.  Finally, you see the thing that drove
 you to the cliff-top, that night in your dorm when you cried out that
 no one loved you, no one in the world.
    Perhaps for the same reasons and perhaps for others too, the scene
 brings you to tears one more time.  You lift your hand to your eye, and
 a single tear-drop tumbles down.  It glitters in a beam of sunlight as
 it falls oh-so-slowly, and splashes onto the mirror.  The mirror's
 surface ripples like water, and the pictures dissolve.  They are
 replaced by a black backdrop of star- spangled night, and Daniel's
 face.
    "Yes," says Daniel softly, "Yes.  You see it now.  Though you
 suffered in life, it was not all of others' doing.  You are ready for
 rebirth now, Phoenix. Fly."  He pauses for a minute and draws a shaky
 breath.  "You may turn the portal on now.  It is time for you to go
 home."  Daniel's image vanishes.

    Home?  It has been too long since the word meant anything to you.
 Still, he is right.  It is time to go home.

>examine mirror
 The mirror now only shows a reflection of the clouds above you,
 drifting slowly across a blue sky.  (Oh, and you can also see yourself,
 upside-down.)

>touch touchpad
 A mechanical voice crackles out of nowhere.  "Portal engaged."

>look
 Inside the hole
    This hole is fairly roomy, and about ten feet deep.  Foot-holes in
 the side allow you to climb up into the sunlight.  Covering the entire
 floor is a newly cleaned mirror, brightly polished.

>touch mirror
 The mirror feels exactly like a mirror, and yields about as much as a
 rock.

>look under it
 There's nothing under the polished mirror.

>take it
 You can't have the polished mirror.

>go up
 You climb up and out of the hole.

>go east
 You walk for a minute or two, only to feel the ground beginning to slip
 away.  You take a hasty step backwards.

>go north
 You walk until you enter a garden.

 In a garden
    A beautiful garden, bounded by brick walls to the north and west.
 Alas, the stream that flowed once is no longer here, and the dragon's
 head fountain no longer spouts water.  The bushes and flowers remain,
 but they droop sadly around the muddy ditch where the stream was.
    The hedge beasts are slowly uncurling their leaves and branches as
 they prepare to stand.

>go east
 You walk east until you are in the field again.

 A grassy field, by an apple tree
    This is a field of lush green grass.  In the center of the field, an
 apple tree grows.  Its branches are hung with ripe red apples.
 Scattered flowers wink at you from the grass, as the sun shines
 brightly overhead.  A muddy ditch lies where the stream used to be.  A
 small foot-bridge allows you to cross from one bank to the other.
    You see a large wicker bird cage and a heavy stone here.  The large
 wicker bird cage seems to contain the robin and some scraps of paper.

>go west
 You walk along the banks, where the stream used to be, for a time.

 In a garden
    A beautiful garden, bounded by brick walls to the north and west.
 Alas, the stream that flowed once is no longer here, and the dragon's
 head fountain no longer spouts water.  The bushes and flowers remain,
 but they droop sadly around the muddy ditch where the stream was.
    The hedge beasts are slowly uncurling their leaves and branches as
 they prepare to stand.
 Slowly, the hedge beasts begin work again.  One reaches under a bush to
 retrieve the gardening tools, only to find some are not there.  The
 hedge beasts rustle confusedly for a bit, and then begin work anyway.
 Soon they are doing their best to tend the garden tool-lessly.

>go south
 You follow the brook's path out of the garden, and into a field.

 An open field
    This is an open field, with a few boulders and the like scattered

 perhaps the only real shade in the area.  A muddy streak slashes
 through the field north-south, where the water used to be.  A wide
 white plank allows you to cross from one bank to the other.  One of the
 boulders has vanished, and a hole gapes where it used to be. Sticking
 out of the ground is a stone pillar, a control panel and joystick built
 into its side.
    You see a small fly, a grenade pin, an apple, and a thorny rake
 here.

>go south
 Walking south eventually takes you to a rocky cliff-top.

 Cliff top
    The area is fairly rocky here, with scattered grasses growing
 between cracks in the rocks.  The stream that flowed here once no
 longer does, and the cliff-face looks quite bare without the waterfall.

>go east
 You walk out to the very edge of the cliff, and look down at the steep
 drop-off below.  The wind tugs at you playfully up here, making you
 vaguely nervous.

>go down
 You climb down the cliff.

 Climbing the cliff
    You are climbing on the rocky cliff face.  The waterfall is no
 longer here, but the rocks are still a bit damp.  Below you are
 scattered rocks and such, and scattered tufts of grass.  Nearby, a
 small cave leads into the cliff and darkness.  Floating in mid-air,
 there is a glowing purple portal.  It crackles with energy.

>examine portal
 The portal crackles with blue-violet energies.  Just being near it
 makes your skin tingle, and all the little hairs on your arms stand up.
 It looks to be about seven feet across.

>enter portal
 You can't safely reach the portal from here, and there's no good
 surface to jump off.

>in
 You cautiously enter the cave.

 Small cave
    It's not as dark in here as it looks from the outside.  Some
 sunlight still filters into the cave to illuminate the (stone) floor.
 The exit is east.

>pull knob
 You give the knob a tug.  It sticks for a second, and then slides out a
 short distance.  Almost immediately afterwards, the wall in front of
 you opens, the floor tilts, and you tumble forwards into darkness .  .
 .

 Control Central
    Well, if you've ever wondered what was going on, you seem to have
 found the place where whatever it is that is going on happens.  Lots of
 machines are scattered around the room, some making endearing bleeping
 noises.  Most of these are safely sealed behind glass.  A small padded
 chair sits in the center of the room, facing a large viewscreen.
    You see a hang-glider here.  Sitting on the comfy chair you see a
 handwritten note.

>take glider
 Taken.

>turn black dial to 6
 Okay, it's now turned to 6.  Dials on the machines spin, and a light
 blinks off, then on again.  The picture changes.
 The viewscreen is quite large, taking up most of one wall.  Currently,
 it's showing a familiar scene:  Cliff top, at the edge
    The area is fairly rocky here, with scattered grasses growing
 between cracks in the rocks.  The stream that flowed here once no
 longer does, and the cliff-face looks quite bare without the waterfall.

>wear glider
 You grab hold of the glider bar and adjust your position on it.  You're
 ready to fly!  Okay, you're now wearing the hang-glider.

>touch viewscreen
 You touch the screen, and are abruptly elsewhere.

 Cliff top, at the edge
    The area is fairly rocky here, with scattered grasses growing
 between cracks in the rocks.  The stream that flowed here once no
 longer does, and the cliff-face looks quite bare without the waterfall.

>go east
 You step off the cliff ...
    And soar into the air.  The transition from land to sky is a bit
 tricky, but you get the hang of it fast.  You're still dropping in
 altitude, though.  (Of course, compared to how fast you'd be dropping
 without a hang-glider, you're doing great.)

 Flying near cliff
    You are flying near the bare clifftop.  It looks quite strange
 without the pounding waters.  Small scraggly mosses and surround a
 small cave entrance, and down below you can see piles of jagged rocks
 on the ground.  Floating in mid-air, there is a glowing purple portal.
 It crackles with energy.

>enter portal
    You angle the glider towards the portal.  It seems to hum and swirl
 at a higher and higher pitch the closer you get to it.  The portal
 starts to pulse, very softly.  You fly closer, suddenly realizing the
 portal isn't nearly big enough to fit the wings of the glider, but also
 realizing it's far too late to turn back now.
    Then you are inside the portal.  You are in a sea of endless violet
 for a little while, surrounded by voices:  your father's, your
 mother's, Daniel's, yours -- you even fancy you can hear a dog yipping
 in the background.  You smile to yourself, feeling peace like you have
 not known in years.  Finally, you emerge out the other side, into the
 hot sun of noon-time in the desert.

    Now you are falling again, off the same cliff that you left .  .  .
 could it have really been just a day before?  But this time you are
 ready.  You spread your wings out and -- in a burst of flames --
 Phoenix soars skywards.

    Your past is behind you, your present surrounds you, and the future
 is wide, wide open.  Congratulations, Phoenix.

    Well, well, you've finished the game.  Good going.  Here are some
 interesting/fun things to check out in the game, if you haven't
 already.  Most of these are unnecessary for completion of the game, but
 are amusing to do:
    * Try and get 100% of the minor goals done.
    * Be in different places on the gazebo as it flies up.
    * Tease the hedge beasts.  They're pretty smart, and hopefully
 they'll notice if you have their tools, or if their tools are on the
 ground.  Speaking of which, have you tried taking the tools from under
 the bushes as the hedge beasts are waking?
    * Figure out what the green dial on the remote does.
    * The spade and rake can't actually be used for digging or raking,
 but there's cute messages for why not.
    * You can pick the flowers in the startroom.  They're useless, but
 look kinda nice :)
    * There's about a half-dozen visions to look at in the desert.
 Also, there's a rather mysterious object there.  (Daniel hints at its
 function, perhaps.)
    * Speaking of whom ...  Daniel doesn't respond to a lot, but he
 knows a few things.  You can show him the note, among other things, and
 ask him about the following:  himself, the apple tree, the hedge
 beasts, the robin, your father, the invaders, yourself, phoenix,
 returning home, God, the angels (or refer by name), the gazebo, Polly,
 Zippy, the desert, the sun, the sundial, the brook, the note, "here",
 and the glass bottle.
    * The apple tree knows somewhat less.  You can ask him to give you
 the glider or the apples, and ask him about:  the apples, himself, the
 glider, the brook, the sun, his problem, the robin, climbing, the hedge
 beasts, and the hedges.  He also has a certain amount of responses when
 you do things involving the robin (try throwing things at the robin,
 for instance).
    Hopefully that's enough to get you interested.  There's lots more to
 see here.  Most of the Cool Stuff (tm) is unnecessary to winning the
 game (the hedge beasts, for example), but it's fun to write.  (Not fun
 to debug though!)  Welcome to my world.  Now that you've got the
 important stuff done, feel free to look at the odds and ends left over.
