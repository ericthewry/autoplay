 Then him pause again. Grunk not know what gnome hoping Grunk ask now,
 so Grunk just wait.

 After gnome and Grunk both wait for little bit, gnome say. "It's a big
 ambition. My first model is only able to perform simple arithmetic.
 But the next one I'm designing should be able to handle logarithms.
