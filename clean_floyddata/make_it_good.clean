 <span class="floydstyle i">MAKE IT GOOD</span> is a detective game. A murder has been committed
 at No 15 Brokentop Boulevard. A man lies dead, and unfortunately, they
 called you. Now either you can get the evidence together to make a
 conviction - or you'll be out for good.

 <span class="floydstyle i">MAKE IT GOOD</span> is dedicated to one of the best Infocom titles
 ever written: Stu Galley's <span class="floydstyle i">Witness</span>. A tightly-focused game it
 was smart enough to use a few characters with interesting lives rather
 than several characters with nothing at all, and told its story in a
 series of gripping set-pieces.

 <span class="floydstyle i">MAKE IT GOOD</span> was begun in order to settle an argument over the
 merits of text gaming over graphical adventures. Intended as quick
 demo project in 2000 it took seven years to reach the THE END text,
 and another year to finish filling the spaces in-between. He hopes you
 will finish it more easily, and find the inevitable lapses of
 consistency in the narrative voice are compensated for by the
 extensive testing the first six moves have received.

 Should you find any bugs - and there will be bugs - please send
 details to the author at jon.ingold@gmail.com.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Broken Top Boulevard, Outside No. 15</span> (in the black chevy)
 The boulevard through the windscreen is lined with ash trees, thick
 trunks casting shadows and gnarled roots mangling up the sidewalk.
 You're sat in your car, parked too high up the kerb; just outside the
 gate to No. 15. Just an ordinary house. With a body inside.

 The glove compartment is closed. Sat on the passenger seat is a
 whiskey bottle.

>open glove


 (unlocking it first - with the car key)
 You pull open the compartment, and it catches after only opening a
 tiny crack. Stupid thing.

>open glove


 The catch is pretty firmly stuck.

>inventory


 In your trenchcoat pockets are your badge and a car key, and in your
 hands you hold some black leather gloves.

 In addition to your trenchcoat, you are wearing your wide-brimmed hat
 and your scuffed black shoes.

>hit glove


 Leaning up in the seat, you give the thing a smack with both feet and
 it clicks shut.

>open glove


 (unlocking it first - with the car key)
 You pull open the compartment, and it catches again.

>examine bottle


 "Uncle Stan's Golden Malt"; yeah, it's bargain bin liquor at 80% proof
 and 80% off. Your body's crying out for it. To slip back, let the
 whole goddamn world ride all the way to the glass at the bottom. Oh
 yeah.

>take bottle


 Your fingers shiver on the glass as you lift it.

>examine gloves


 You've had them all your years in the force; though you're always
 forgetting to use them. For example, this morning you left them on the
 table back home; had to stop off for them just before you took this
 call, right after you bought the booze. Priorities all straight, oh
 yeah.

>drink whiskey


 The bottle's not open. You can suck the cap all you like, it won't do
 you no good.

>wear gloves


 You pull the gloves onto your hands.

>examine badge


 Your police badge - oh yeah, this proves you're an upstanding, honest,
 officer of the goddamn law. It has a small pin on the back.

>out


 (opening the black chevy first)
 You open the car door.
 You clamber out of the driving seat.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Broken Top Boulevard, Outside No. 15</span>
 The boulevard is lined with ash trees, thick trunks casting shadows
 and gnarled roots mangling up the sidewalk. Your car is parked too
 high up the kerb; just outside the gate to No. 15. Just an ordinary
 house. With a body inside.

 There'd better be some faces too: you need the slam. What did the peep
 at the station say? <span class="floydstyle em">Inspector, the only case you cracked open last</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">year was the Michaelmas liquor.</span> He has a point. If you come up
 blank (or facedown in a gutter) you'll be off the payroll. And then
 you'd really have a problem.

 Down the street there's a dog, running about.

>examine dog


 The dog's somewhere else down the road. You can hear its damn yapping.

 You hear a loud barking in the distance.

>go to 15


 (opening the front gate first)
 The gate swings creakily.

 You step into the porch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Porch</span>
 A tasteful little porch; white painted wood strapped onto red-brick
 building. The front door is north, and through a small diamond of
 frosted glass you can make out nothing of the wood-panelled hallway
 inside. Your neck is sweating; sunlight hides behind the trees to the
 south.

 A hanging basket with a couple of petunias in is attached just to the
 left of the door.

>examine basket


 The basket is small and wicker, and hangs on a rough twine from a
 screw in the ceiling, just out of the sunlight from the door. It's
 about as high up as your head. Inside the basket a couple of petunias
 are growing limp in the shade.

>search basket


 The hanging basket has got some petunias in it.

>knock on door


 You knock a smart rap on the door.

 After a short wait the door opens, Angela's face appears, then the
 rest of her. She looks just like she should considering, no time to do
 her face. "Yes, hello? Oh - " and you follow her eyes, which have
 noticed the whiskey bottle in your grubby paws. "I've no time for
 drunks now. Goodbye." The door is slammed.

>drop bottle


 You set the bottle down carefully. Don't want to break it now.

>knock on door


 You knock a smart rap on the door. Perhaps a face appears behind the
 red glass, but there's no answer.

>knock on door


 You knock a smart rap on the door. Perhaps a face appears behind the
 red glass, but there's no answer. Somehow, it seems like you've
 managed to screw up the entire investigation before even starting.
 Impressive.

>kick door


 The door's such a hard-wood that even trying to kick it down comes out
 as nothing but a smart little knock. Perhaps a face appears behind the
 red glass, but there's no answer. Somehow, it seems like you've
 managed to screw up the entire investigation before even starting.
 Impressive.

>show badge to door


 Inanimate. Give up.

>show badge to face
>show badge to face


 -- You referred to something that can't be interacted with at present.



 -- You referred to something that can't be interacted with at present.

>show badge to woman


 -- You referred to something that can't be interacted with at present.

>examine door


 The front door is closed and locked, green, kind of cheery in a
 backwater way. Screwed into the front are two brass numbers. They say
 "15". Set into it is a diamond of red-frosted glass.

>accuse bottle


 That doesn't seem to have impressed it.

>yeah, I think we need to restart.


 You reckon?
 -- I only got as far as wanting to inventory.

>restart


 -- Are you sure you want to restart?

 You knock a smart rap on the door.

 After a short wait the door opens, Angela's face appears, then the
 rest of her. She looks just like she should considering, no time to do
 her face. "Yes? What do you want?" she says uncertainly.

>examine angela


 Thirty-something, maybe forty on a bad day; Angela is housewife
 through and through. From her thick black ball of hair down through
 her one piece long dress, she's sophistication via mail-order. Sure,
 maybe she could be pretty, if you'd lost all your teeth and were three
 notches out in the belt, and she wasn't pinched and blotchy, like she
 is today. Yeah, today is not a day to be sizing her up, that's true
 enough.

 "Can I help you?"

>show badge to angela


 "Oh, Inspector! I'm sorry.. do come in, I'm glad you came so quickly."
 You follow her into the house. It has a smell you recognise, all
 right.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 A wood-panelled hallway, with the front door to the south next to
 which is a dark polished roll-top desk. Stairs in the northeast corner
 of the room lead to the upstairs landing where the bedrooms are, and a
 passage northwest runs through to the kitchen and blue wallpapered
 living room, which you can't quite see from here.

 In the lefthand corner is a hat stand. Hanging off the stand is Jack's
 hat.

 Mrs. Draginam closes the door shut behind you.

 "The man on the phone told me to make sure nothing was touched. They
 told me you were coming, but they said there'd be more of you." She
 fusses a little. "Shall I take your hat?"

>yes


 You remove your hat, and Angela hangs it on the stand.

 "And your coat, Inspector?"

>ask angela about jack


 "In the bedroom," she replies. "That's where it happened. I was
 downstairs and... oh." She raises one hand to her mouth. "Maybe you
 should just see."

>go to bedroom


 -- What do you want to go: the Maid's Bedroom, the Guest Bedroom or
 the Master Bedroom?

>go to master bedroom


 You make your way upstairs around the curve of the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upstairs Hallway, North End</span>
 A neat little corridor, running with the stairwell to the east down
 the length of the house. The carpet is a worn-down brown pattern; the
 wallpaper a lurid yellow colour, like flowers stuck in another guy's
 wedding cake. The closed doorway to the bedroom lies north of here,
 another door is open to the west; by the look of it a guest bedroom.

 "Through there, Inspector," Angela says to you, pointing to the north
 door; hanging back herself though.

>examine north door


 The master bedroom door is closed.

>go to master bedroom


 (opening the master bedroom door first)
 You open the door. And catch a glimpse of the corpse - a crumpled heap
 of dead human, nothing but the knife wounds in its back between him
 and you. Stabbed in the back - oh yeah, stabbed in the back.

 Angela follows you in, and looks uncertainly at the body, her eyes a
 little cold. "I'll be in the living room if you want to ask me any
 questions, Inspector," she say thickly, before stepping out the room
 and closing the door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 The master bedroom is relatively tasteful, and dominated by the bed
 sticking out of the east wall. Opposite is a mirrored dresser shoved
 in the corner at an angle, just by the large windows overlooking the
 garden. These are shut tight like normal. The closed door is in the
 southwest - in fact, lying on the bed you could probably see it in the
 reflection. The carpet's beige-with-dried-bloodstain, and there's more
 rancid wallpapering. Between the window and the bed is a little yucca
 tree in a pot.

 Sprawled in a messy heap, pining for attention, is Jack's corpse.

 On the dresser is a green-shaded table lamp.

 "Then you can meet the others," Angela calls. "There's the maid, and
 William Matheston, outside, in the shed. Good. Well, all right then."
 You hear Angela's footsteps move off, but they don't go downstairs.

>examine mirror


 That's one beat-up gentleman, that is.

 There is a loud thump, of something falling, from somewhere nearby.

>go south


 (opening the master bedroom door first)
 You open the master bedroom door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upstairs Hallway, North End</span>
 Corridor, south; guest bedroom, west; murder, north. Stairs, down.

 You hear a slight click through the door to the west.

>go west


 (opening the guest bedroom door first)
 You open the guest bedroom door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guest Bedroom</span>
 Heh. That you thought this was a guest bedroom says something - from
 the photo on the nightstand by the bed, this is Angela's bedroom. It's
 pretty spartan, no dresser or table, just a wicker chair for
 furniture. The door lies to the east, a little window in the north
 wall has a view into the garden. The carpet's blue; so's the owner.

 There's a flurry of movement as you enter. Angela is sitting on the
 wicker chair. She looks a little flustered.

 On the nightstand is a silver frame framing a photo.

 A tall teak wardrobe leans against one wall.

>open wardrobe


 You open the wardrobe doors, and take a peek inside. Pretty empty,
 just a few shelves and a clothes rail, with not much on them. On the
 rail are a few coathangers. The shelves have got Angela's shoes on
 them.

 "I'll be in the living room, Inspector," she says, her voice a little
 shaky, then goes out the door and downstairs like her tail was on
 fire.

>examine shoes


 -- What do you want to examine: Angela's shoes or your scuffed black
 shoes?

>go to master bedroom



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upstairs Hallway, North End</span>
 Corridor, south; guest bedroom, west; murder, north. Stairs, down.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 Bed, mirrored dresser, window. Door. Yucca. Dead guy.

 On the dresser is a green-shaded table lamp.

>examine corpse


 The corpse looks peaceful, like he just tripped and stayed there.
 Except for his face: two gashes, not deep, but running from temples to
 cheekbones. The stab wounds in his back are deep, as long as the blade
 used, thin. There are about seven of them. He'd been turning for the
 door when he was struck. That's how he lies now, reaching out.

 It's bled messily over the carpet.

 Someone knocks on the front door below.

>search corpse


 You rifle the corpse; find a key in his pocket. A dirty Yale key.

 There are footsteps in the hall; and the maid's voice: "Yes? How can I
 - oh."



 -- What do you want to take: the dirty house key or the car key?



 You already have that.

 From the hallway: "Is the Inspector here?" There is a pause. "I'll go
 and find him, then."

>examine dresser


 The dresser has no drawers, just a surface and a mirror. The
 reflection is not flattering, it looks both like you need the bottle
 and you've been at it for too long. It's like the faces you see in the
 cells in the morning; after the kissers have been through with them.

 From the hallway, you hear the front door close.

 There are footsteps on the stairs, and a policeman appears huffing
 like a steam train. He comes in and shuts the door. Only then does his
 jowly smile drop into a scowl. "Inspector. Sorry you made it. I hoped
 you wouldn't." He comes closer, then reels, waving one hand in front
 of his nose. "You've been drinking. Maybe not recently. But
 generally." A fat fist grabs you by the collar. "I need you to get
 this one <span class="floydstyle em">right</span>. I'm not getting stuck on another one of your
 blow-out cases. Okay?"

>yes


 The policeman sneers a smile.

 "I don't think you can. The Chief doesn't think you can. Don't think
 he doesn't know all about you. This is your last chance, Inspector. If
 you muss this one up you're out on your ear and then you're just
 little people again. You'll find yourself in the drunk block quicker
 than I can take your badge. Understand?"



 "You'd better."

 The policeman lessens his gaze a bit, drags a hand through short,
 slicked back black hair. He's a real grease monkey, one of these
 modern kids. "Okay, Inspector. Get started. Do the body first, then
 when you're finished with the body, tell me and we'll get it away from
 here. Though I'll take it myself around four, when the coroner closes
 up. Otherwise, if you want something analysing at the lab you let me
 know. And if you want to make an arrest, you tell me. Now get on with
 it."

>analyse door


 "Stop wasting your time," he replies. "My time."

>tell policeman about body


 "There's nothing on him back at the station," Joe informs you.
 "Accountant, married. Nothing you couldn't detect just looking around
 at this place. Not much else going on. No obvious reason for someone
 to do that to him, anyhow." Joe wrinkles his nose. "Are you finished
 with him yet, Inspector? Shall I take him away?"



 Nothing. Well, nothing of any worth to you. A handkerchief but you
 don't feel like crying.



 -- "handkerchief" isn't a word I know.

>inventory


 In your trenchcoat pockets are your badge and two keys: the dirty
 house key and the car key, and in your gloved hands you hold nothing.

 In addition to your trenchcoat and gloves, you are wearing your
 scuffed black shoes.

>tell police about body


 (the policeman about that)
 "What's more to say?" Joe wrinkles his nose. "Are you finished with
 him yet, Inspector? Shall I take him away?"

>yes


 "Okay," the policeman says to you, and disappears downstairs. A few
 minutes later the coroner's van pulls up, and you watch
 dispassionately as Joe, and the coroner, and a long flat guy called
 Jack wander out to the taxi. There's no fuss or big deal, just a
 sheet. Angela watches pale-faced from a window or something, who
 knows.

 If we're being honest, no-one seems to miss the guy and he's only two
 hours gone. Joe returns to the room. "I'll stick around if you need
 anything analysed, Inspector. I'll go sit and read a paper in the
 living room or something." You nod and he leaves.

 The dresser has got a green-shaded table lamp on it.

>examine lamp


 A bent brass spine leads up from the thick discus base to the long
 thin green shade. Inside is a short neon bulb which is dark. The glass
 is a little scratched; the brass colouring flecking off the metal in
 places.

>switch on lamp


 You turn on the lamp.

 The light glints off the surface of the dresser, picking out marks in
 the varnish. Letters and words etched in.



 You can't make much out, because the light only picks out certain
 bits; just letters here and there. Certainly not enough to make sense
 of it; apart from the last two letters: "J.D." Familiar?

>examine window


 (the large window)
 Large windows, with painted green frames, the paint on which looks a
 little ragged. They're closed.

 They offer a good vista of the poky little garden, which is damp from
 the recent rain. A thick clump of climbing roses comes up the wall to
 the sill.

 The paint is thick, and dark green, perhaps the third layer the frame
 has seen. Along the hinged seam, the paint has flaked away, revealing
 a white undercoat colour underneath. A few flecks of green paint are
 visible on the carpet just below the window.

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 The master bedroom is relatively tasteful, and dominated by the bed
 sticking out of the east wall. Opposite is a mirrored dresser shoved
 in the corner at an angle, just by the large windows overlooking the
 garden. These are wide open, letting in the bite of cold air. The open
 door is in the southwest - in fact, lying on the bed you could
 probably see it in the reflection. The carpet's
 beige-with-dried-bloodstain, and there's more rancid wallpapering.
 Between the window and the bed is a little yucca tree in a pot.

 On the dresser is a green-shaded table lamp with bulb lit.

>examine pot


 A stubby little tree, leaves green like the beer from that hole on
 12th Street, and sprouting thicker than a ex-con's beard, so much so
 that the rim of the ceramic pot is shrouded from view.



 You spread the leaves back, to reveal a short stake pushed deep into
 the soil of the plant.

>examine stake


 It's about two inches of metal, hidden in the leaves, which seems to
 carry on down into the soil.

>take it


 You draw out the short stake, which becomes the hilt of the carved
 steel letter opener, its blade sticky with blood.

>examine stake


 A short stubby handle and a long carved blade. Soil coats the metal;
 stuck down with some substance you know well. It's blood.

>analyse stake


 After a moment, Joe steps in through the open master bedroom door.

 Joe has seen the blood-soaked steel letter opener. "Is that our
 possible murder weapon?" he asks.

 "Anyway, you called for me." He slicks his hair back. "So, what have
 you got?" You show him the steel letter opener. "It'd be difficult to
 get that much blood out of a bunch of tax-returns," he remarks. "If
 there's fingerprints on this, that'd make this the most careless
 murder ever. But still, it's worth a shot." Wearing gloves he takes
 the letter opener from you and drops it into a bag.

 The policeman leaves through the master bedroom door.



 A beige, wall-to-wall carpet. In the middle of it is a large
 bloodstain; and by one window you observe some flecks of green paint.
 Otherwise it's quite clean, and not very dusty.



 Quite a wide patch of carpet is soaked in blood, maybe two feet in
 diameter. The red on cream effect is quite compelling, like a pavlova.

>analyse paint


 Right now Joe's off analysing the steel letter opener. You'll have to
 wait for him to come back.



 It's just wallpaper. It doesn't do anything; except spin on the
 ceiling every other night of the week.

 Bed, nightstand, wicker chair. Door to the corridor.

 On the nightstand is a silver frame framing a photo.

 A tall teak wardrobe leans against one wall.

>examine photo


 Sickening picture of happier times; Angela and Jack, arm in arm,
 outside a registrar office. But even here not everything's good -
 there's another couple in the background carrying open umbrellas.
 Angela is arm in arm with Jack who is arm in arm with Angela's sister.
 Sweet touch. There's a strange, flat bulge under one corner of the
 photo.

 The photo is in a charming silver frame. Could be worth something.



 The clasp needs to be clipped out but like the straps on the girls
 they pull in from Chinatown. It's far too small for your fat shaky
 fingers.



 Using the pin on the back you flip open the clasp of the frame. The
 cover swings open and the photo slides out and wafts to the floor. A
 flimsy key which was hidden behind it also falls out. You pick it up.



 -- I only got as far as wanting to examine the silver frame.

>examine frame


 The frame is all twirly and flowery, you know, flowers like you get
 near gravestones. It has a little clasp on the side and the silver
 front hangs open on a hinge from the back.

 A tall wardrobe made of teak, with cocky brass handles on the doors.

 (Angela's clothes)
 You rummage around in the clothing, unearthing a novel, a toiletry

 interesting - a highly valuable black and white photograph is
 revealed.



 -- What do you want to examine: the black and white incriminating
 photograph, the passport photo or the wedding photo?

>black and white


 Well. It's quite an image, neatly framed by the green-painted window
 frame. The sun was in just the right place for this shot it seems, it
 doesn't reflect on the glass, you can see straight through to the
 couple getting jitty on the bed. There's an odd number of legs on view
 here; oh yeah. You can see it all - you can see their faces. Jack
 looks like a fat nightmare teddy-bear. Emilia looks like she's eating
 a wasp, but then what tart looks pretty?

 The photo is defaced by a few splatters of blood.

 Joe steps in through the open guest bedroom door.

 Joe nods at the photograph, before picking it up to examine it more
 closely. "My, my," he whistles, "The plot thickens." He hands the
 photograph to you. "I suppose you found this? I wonder who knew?"

 He hands back the letter opener. "On this; no good, Inspector. The
 only fingerprints we got were yours and the deceased - you must have
 handled it without gloves on. However, the blood is the deceased
 alright."

 The policeman leaves through the guest bedroom door.



 -- "black" isn't a recognised verb.

 By the crummy-view window is screwed a small silver hook. Hanging from
 the hook is a silver key.

 On the low chest is a jar of face-cream.

 Thrown in one corner of the sofa is a pile of men's clothing: someone
 changing in a hurry and flinging what they had on away.



 Definitely men's shirts; they might be the maid's boyfriend's, they
 might be Jack's waiting to be ironed. Picking one at random, it has
 the letters ADC stitched into the back of the collar. In the

 "Well?" You direct his attention to the razors. Joe takes one look.
 "You might want to learn how to use one of those," he remarks acidly.

 The policeman leaves through the bathroom door.

 The washbasin is crisp white. Except for a few dried up flecks of
 blood at the bottom of the sink.

 The washbasin is empty.

 Just a few spots in a rough line from plug hole to under the hot tap.

 "Well?" You direct his attention to the specks of blood. "Some blood?
 Well - it could be anybody's, couldn't it? But my money's on it
 belonging to the stiff, okay?" Joe snarls, before producing a swab and
 a bag and soaking up a little of the blood, which he places in a bag.

 The policeman leaves through the bathroom door.

 In your trenchcoat pockets are a medicine tube, closed, with eight
 tablets inside, a pencil, Angela's passport, a trashy novel, a Franc,
 a black and white incriminating photograph, your badge and four keys:
 the silver key, the flimsy key, the dirty house key and the car key,
 and in your gloved hands you hold a scrap of pink paper and a steel
 letter opener.

 In addition to your trenchcoat and gloves, you are wearing your
 scuffed black shoes.

 a French franc, dated seven years ago.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 The master bedroom is relatively tasteful, and dominated by the bed
 sticking out of the east wall. Opposite is a mirrored dresser shoved
 in the corner at an angle, just by the large windows overlooking the
 garden. These are wide open, letting in the bite of cold air. The open
 door is in the southwest - in fact, lying on the bed you could
 probably see it in the reflection. The carpet's
 beige-with-dried-bloodstain, and there's more rancid wallpapering.
 Between the window and the bed is a little yucca tree in a pot.

 On the dresser is a green-shaded table lamp with bulb lit.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 A wood-panelled hallway, with the front door to the south next to
 which is a dark polished roll-top desk. Stairs in the northeast corner
 of the room lead to the upstairs landing where the bedrooms are, and a
 passage northwest runs through to the kitchen and blue wallpapered
 living room, which you can't quite see from here.

 In the lefthand corner is a hat stand. Hanging off the stand are your
 wide-brimmed hat and Jack's hat.

>examine desk


 No doubt an antique or something, that'd explain why it's missing a
 handle on one drawer and the varnish on top is scratched and covered
 in coffee-rings. Probably worth a few bucks; that would fit with the
 household just right. The lid is rollback like a bread-bin.

 Currently the lid is shut.

 You start rubbing at the surface but can't get any detail - the

 rough and uneven. You pick the paper back up to see what it is. You

 This passage runs from the hallway southeast to the kitchen at the far

 into the east wall. With no real natural light here the ambient

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A plush little kitchen, with a kitchenette area full of drawers and
 cookers and a sink, and one long table filling the rest of the room,
 where they eat. A flapping swing door leads north onto the garden, and
 lets in a little air. The passage back to the hallway is opposite,
 above that door is a cheerful round clock. To the east is a pantry.

 There's a young dark-haired girl here. She must be the maid who phoned
 the station.

 On the worktop are a closed biscuit barrel and a ceramic water-jug.

 The girl looks up and notices you, and leaps to her feet, flustered.
 She begins speaking hurriedly. "You are from the police? You are a
 policeman? It is terrible, quite terrible." She has traces of a French
 accent, a stain like day-old mascara. "We were all here, when it
 happened, all of us. Like some kind of joke... I have not said who I
 am. Emilia Jordane. The maid, here." A useless curtsey, then she sits
 back down at the table and waits to get done.

 The maid shrieks! She has seen the knife.

 Emilia's eyes are on the whiskey bottle in your hand. "We do not have
 whiskey in the house, Inspector, not since Anthony started to live
 here. It is not good for him. He - used to drink a lot, Inspector."
 Her face darkens a little. "So did Jack."

>examine maid


 French by blood, you can see that around the soft lines of her face
 and the redness of the lips. She's pretty - sure, she's a real young
 flower, with long black hair tied back, and a look of quiet respect
 that takes little getting used to, you'd reckon. She's wearing
 comfortable casual clothes, so you'd hardly pin her as a maid except
 for the dishcloth and her hands neatly folded in her lap; and that
 subservient look that fills her rich brown eyes.

 The maid tries not to look at the knife.

>ask maid about anthony


 She smiles. "Anthony is my boyfriend. We met last year. He is
 wonderful, Inspector. He has had some problems in the past, Inspector.
 He was an alcoholic when I met him, it was terrible. But he is through
 that now, and I am very proud of him. He is staying here, with me, at
 the moment - you will meet him when he comes back, I suppose,
 Inspector. This will all be a great shock to him when he returns.

 "I suppose we will be leaving now, we will get a place of our own. It
 is not so bad, I suppose."

>ask maid about carpenter


 "He's a wonderful man. He is very kind to me. I do not think Mrs.
 Draginam likes to have him stay, but Mr. Draginam allows it. I think
 they get - got - on well, Anthony and Jack. He has had some problems
 in the past, Inspector. He was an alcoholic when I met him, it was
 terrible. But he is through that now, and I am very proud of him. He
 went out just after lunch, at about half past one. He went swimming.
 He'll probably be back quite soon."



 "Those are Anthony's painkillers, Inspector. He has sprained his
 ankle."

 The maid avoids the letter-opener with her eyes.

>ask maid about jenny


 Emilia has no idea who you're talking about. "Is there someone at the
 library like that?" she asks. You shake your head.

>ask maid about library


 -- "library" isn't a word you can use.

>ask maid about jack


 "I should tell you what happened, yes? Please, sit down." They don't
 often ask, so you go ahead.

 "It was a little before 2pm. I was here clearing up the things from
 lunch. Mrs. Draginam was in the living room with her friend Mr.
 Matheston, I think. Anyway - I was singing to myself and I didn't know
 anything until there was this most awful scream. I thought Mrs.
 Draginam, she must have dropped something, so I went upstairs with my
 dustpan. And the bedroom door, it was open - I could see blood
 already, from the stairs I could see it. Angela was there also, with
 her back to me, by the window. She was closing it. She told me to call
 the police. She didn't turn around - she was shaking. Such a shock.

 "So I called the police. You. That is what happened."

>ask maid about jack


 "He was a good employer, I suppose, Inspector. He paid my wages on
 time. They were good wages. And he kept me on - I know Mrs. Draginam
 did not think I was needed any more. Jack insisted."

 The maid's eyes stay fixed on you.

 "I love the garden, Inspector! It's only small, but I enjoy tending
 it. You should see it in summer, not now, when all the flowers have
 bloomed. Jack - Mr. Draginam - used to watch me pruning the roses from
 the study window. Said I distracted him."

 "Well, we keep gardening tools there," the maid says. "And Mr
 Matheston, he likes the quiet I suppose."

 "Mr Matheston is a good friend of Mrs Draginam. He's from the church.
 They often spend time talking together, many hours. He's a very nice
 man. I'm sure he couldn't be anything to do with... this. I think he
 was in the living room when it happened. Now he's in the shed. For
 whatever reason I do not know, but he likes to sit there sometimes."

 The maid avoids the letter-opener with her eyes.

 The shed smells musty, like long-lost confessions - four rickety pine
 walls filled with gardening tools, and a lawnmower, but still with
 plenty of space for the terminally rich to potter around in. One small
 dirty window has a view over the garden outside and the back of the
 house.

 A chess set has been set up on an upturned wheelbarrow and laid out
 mid-game.

 Angela had mentioned someone called William Matheston who was in the
 shed: this old guy reclining in the deckchair must be him.

 Matheston looks up and makes eye contact.

 William Matheston is unimpressed.

 "There you are again," Matheston says, rising to his feet to shake
 your hand, though if you've ever seen his mush before it didn't stick.

>ask william about william


 "I'm a vicar, at the local church. I've known Angela ever since they
 moved to the area, about three and a half years ago. She was very
 distraught on account of losing the baby. I helped her through that.
 Helped her to reconcile it with God. And we became firm friends - all
 three of us, her, God and myself."

>ask william about angela


 "She's an excellent woman, Inspector. One of the most devoted members
 of my congregation. Strong at heart too, though she wouldn't let you
 see it. We've been firm friends for many years."

 "Well," Matheston adds, mostly to himself. "Maybe Angela is only as
 well as could be expected."

>ask william about angela


 "She's an excellent woman, Inspector. One of the most devoted members
 of my congregation. Strong at heart too, though she wouldn't let you
 see it. We've been firm friends for many years."

 Matheston considers the board carefully. "Do you play chess,
 Inspector?" he asks.

>examine chess


 (the chess board)
 The chess board is kinda thin: white has a few pawns as backup and two
 rooks roaming free. Black has an assortment: a knight, a queen, a
 pawn, and one of those guys that looks like an asparagus hiding off in
 a corner.

>yes


 "I'm glad. Excellent game. Full of subtleties. Things you don't see
 that tie together into something by the end." He shakes his head. "If
 life were a little more like chess, I think people would find it
 easier."

>ask william about chess


 "It's an interesting position," William says. "Black is on the move.
 Two rooks can't attack directly but they do create deadly alignments.
 Traps. As for white, it's spread very thin. The queen is in retreat.
 That bishop there is watching the long diagonal but doesn't look at
 all ready to come into play. I think the problem centres on the knight
 and the pawn. It's white to play, by the way."

 William considers the board in front of him carefully.

>ask william about chess


 "I think it's about pressure, on the knight, to force a sacrifice of
 the pawn. But that does leave open what part the other pieces play."

 "I see you're the kind of man who takes his work very seriously,"
 Matheston observes, quite out of the blue. "I'm the same. It's what I
 recognise in you, I think, that dedication."

>ask william about chess


 "I think it's about pressure, on the knight, to force a sacrifice of

>ask william about dedication


 -- "dedication" isn't a word you can use.

>ask william about murder


 "I suppose you want to hear my version of events? Well - Mrs. Draginam
 and I were sat in the living room, talking. To my knowledge Emilia the
 maid was in the kitchen - we couldn't hear her, though, due to our
 conversation and the television on in the background. However, at some
 point, around 2pm maybe, perhaps earlier, there was a heavy 'thump'
 from upstairs - like a large dictionary falling from a shelf.

 "Angela stood and went to the doorway, to see if she could see
 anything. We expected Jack to shout something, you would - but there
 wasn't anything. So she went upstairs and into the bedroom. A few
 moments later she gave a terrible shriek - I rose to go and see, and
 Emilia streaked past me, up the stairs and into the room. I waited at
 the foot. Then the maid came back and went to call the police. I went
 to comfort Angela - I found her in her bedroom, sat on the bed. That's
 about it, I think."

 The vicar is deep in thought.



 -- I didn't recognise that as a topic of conversation.

>ask william about emilia


 "The maid, Inspector? That sweet young thing, she couldn't be anything
 to do with this, I'm sure."

>ask william about anthony


 "The maid has a young man called Anthony, I think. I'm not sure I've
 ever spoken to him beyond a simple hello. I know Mrs. Draginam
 despairs slightly of the kind of man he is, but she can hardly see her
 way to preventing the maid from having something pleasant around,
 considering."

>ask william about me


 "I'm sorry, Inspector. I don't believe I can help you there."

 William is counting through moves on his fingers.

>ask william about william


 "As I said, I'm the vicar here."

 "It was a terrible, terrible loss. I don't think Angela ever quite got
 over it. And Jack, of course, had no sympathy in him whatsoever."

 "This is my little part of the house," he replies. "It's not much." No
 buts there.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Passage from Hallway</span>
 Southeast to the hallway, north to the kitchen. Closet. Door to the
 living room.

 The cupboard is open.



 (opening the living room door first)
 You open the living room door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living Room</span>
 The living room is bright blue, the wallpaper shines out like the
 flashing siren of an ambulance, and isn't helped by a light green sofa
 and a wide window, south-facing, overlooking the sun-drenched street.
 Opposite the open door in the east wall is a small cabinet, and next
 to that is a television set.

 Joe is sat on the sofa, reading a newspaper.

 Mrs. Draginam looks up as you enter.

 On top of the set is a magazine.

 "That'd better be a gift for the bereaved," he snarls, nodding at the
 whiskey bottle in your hand.

 Angela's eyes are fixed on the photograph, though from there she can't
 see what's on it. But then as soon as she notices that you're looking,
 she looks away.



 She sighs, and turns to stare out of the window as she speaks.

 "I found it, there on the desk. When I came in, the mirror was tilted,
 I saw it in the reflection. I raced over to the window, and snatched
 it, I stepped right over his body... and just then Emilia came rushing
 in. I couldn't... I couldn't... I turned my back, I pretended I was
 just closing the window, you see. And then when she'd gone I left it
 in my room. I was going to hide it, but I didn't get a chance - all
 those policeman - until you arrived, Inspector. There. That's my
 confession."

 Joe looks at her sternly. "So you lied in your statement? That's a
 serious offence."

 "Yes, I know," she replies brusquely. The policeman looks up at you
 and raises a brow. He takes the photo from you for a closer look then
 hands it back, Angela watching him do so with disdain.

 Angela gasps as she sees the steel letter opener. "That's Jacks? From
 his study. Was he.. it.. oh, my, that's awful.." With horror, Angela
 recoils.



 -- Please be specific who you want to talk to.

>topics angela


 -- You could try talking to Angela Draginam about: Jack Draginam,
 herself, William Matheston, the whiskey bottle, the medicine tube or
 the silver key.

>ask angela about the silver key


 "I think those are the tablets Emilia's boyfriend has been taking for
 his sprain."

 Angela notices the bottle in your hand. "One of my husband's, I
 suppose. Nice to see it's not empty."

>ask angela about silver key


 Angela takes the key and peers at it. "Front door," she says finally.
 "Is that the maid's copy? We only have three. Emilia has one, I have
 one," she pats a pocket, "and Jack had one, of course. Emilia lends
 hers to her boyfriend when he stays too, I think."



 "What's there to say Inspector? I'm just another housewife. Jack and I
 were married for twelve years. We never had any children because of
 his work, we live here because of his work. I don't see that any of
 it's interesting to you."



 "You've had a good look around up there? Good. Well," she straightens
 down her skirts with one hand, methodically. "I suppose you want to
 know what happened?"

>yes


 [Please specifiy whom you want to say that to using PERSON, YES.]

>angela, yes


 "Well. I was sat here, in the living room, talking to William - I
 suppose you'll have to talk to William too, won't you? He's outside in
 the garden right now, I think. Anyway, there was this loud thump, from
 upstairs. I expected - well, you know, to hear Jack call downstairs,
 or curse or something. When I didn't hear anything, I thought I ought
 to check. I thought maybe he'd slipped and hit his head. I went
 upstairs to see... and there he was, lying in a pool of blood." She
 raises a hand to her mouth. She is staring down at the floor as she
 speaks. "It was horrible!

 "I must have screamed, I don't remember. Anyway, Emilia came running
 up the stairs to see what the matter was."



 "Jack liked to drink, a little. We used to both, I suppose. These days
 we keep the alcohol hidden. Anthony's little problem."

>ask angela about anthony


 "The maid's boyfriend? I barely know him. When he stays - well, he
 keeps himself to himself as much as he can. He works quite a lot too.
 Used to have a problem with drink but he's much better now. But Emilia
 seems happy enough. He's out - he left right before it happened. Went
 swimming. The only sport he can do with that sprain of his."

 "That's not funny, Inspector. We were having problems, sure, but

>arrest angela


 You keep your voice down so that no-one overhears. "Mrs. Draginam?
 Well, I suppose it's usually the wives in cases like this, and I've no
 doubt that Mr. Draginam did a hundred things wrong every minute and
 maybe some of them was real bad too. But we can't arrest a woman on
 nothing, even if she did close the window in the crime scene. Get a
 motive sorted, and maybe we can give this a shot."

>show photograph to joe


 (the black and white incriminating photograph to the policeman)
 He grins. "Good, isn't it?" is his excited reply, and then like a
 five-star idiot he notices Angela and becomes suddenly very timid. "Do
 you want that analysing?" Joe asks.

>analyse photo


 (the black and white incriminating photograph)
 "Let's see - I'll run an analysis on the blood, but I think we can
 guess. I'll pass it by the fake-spotters, get blow-ups of the faces -
 hell, I'll get copies made for Christmas. Good going, Inspector."

 The policeman leaves through the living room door.

 He's left his newspaper on the sofa.

>examine newspaper


 The main story on the front of the paper is the bank heist down on
 fourth last night. It seems the robbers managed to escape the cops
 with $10,000 - a pretty meagre horde, but they'd been stupid enough to
 strike right after the cash van had come. Oh, and for once the paper
 can't be blamed though for getting facts wrong; they aren't to know
 the robbers only have $9,000 of the loot.

 Other stories are the old lady who won the lottery, the kids from some
 school who got hit by a truck, nothing big. There's a crossword on the
 back page, with some baseball results.

 Angela stares with blank eyes at the blank TV.

>ask angela about novel


 "So you just want to insult my taste in books? Fine. Yes, I read Slick
 Gurner books," she snaps irritably. "Those are page numbers on the

 (talking to Angela Draginam)
 -- You could try talking to Angela Draginam about: Jack Draginam, the
 whiskey bottle, the medicine tube, the silver key, the jar of
 face-cream or the scrap of pink paper.

>ask angela about face cream


 "Her face-cream?" Angela looks surprised. "I've borrowed it once or
 twice, maybe. It's a good brand."

>ask angela about pink paper


 "I don't recognise it."

>ask angela about passport


 -- Be more specific about what you want to ask Angela Draginam about.

>ask angela about suitcase


 She doesn't even flinch. "It's no crime to have a packed suitcase, is
 it? I was about to go on holiday."

>ask angela about holiday


 "Just a holiday. William was taking me upstate to where his parents
 live. Jack didn't mind, of course. Church trip. Not something he would
 have cared for himself."

 The pantry's well-stocked, with cans they bought because they had
 nothing else to spend the money on. A few bags of potatoes fill one
 shelf, below that a fruit basket, some hams and bacon. There's a door
 west when you've finished eyeing up their food.

 Sat on a shelf is a dustpan.

 You can also see a broken plate here.



 It's a piece of technology way beyond you.

 Joe appears from out again. He returns the photograph to your sweaty
 little hands. "Well, the blood belongs to you-know-who. Where did you
 find it? In the room? Anyway. The boys in the lab were happy to give
 it some close study. It's no fake." Of course it's not a fake. You
 can't fake high art like this.

 The policeman heads off out again.

>accuse me


 You're guilty of enough - spending a whole month's advance on tequila,
 beating to death that Indian kid in the cell in January, being a
 crummy cop and not solving a single case for a good long while. You
 don't need accusations, you've got a string of them. You need to sort
 it out.
