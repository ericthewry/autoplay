 <span class="floydstyle i">Stream of Consciousness</span>
 From among the trees, you continue to watch the naked women. The
 younger and shorter of the two wades into the stream, her hair like
 threads spun from Midas' gold. She lowers her basket to the water's
 surface. Fish flop into it, settling into a motionless stack. The
 other woman, bright flowers in her black hair, plucks apples from a
 tree and drops them into the basket hanging from her arm. The fruit
 ripen and swell under her touch.

 You were right. Nymphs. Your search is nearly over.

 The water nymph returns to land. She begins to sing. The forest nymph
 joins in, her pitch deeper than that of the blond. With both of their
 baskets full, the pair follow the bank upstream.

 You venture from the trees to the stream, keeping the nymphs in sight.
 They have joined a group of their sisters to the north of you. You
 call that direction "north" because you're facing it; fatigue has
 rendered your inner compass as trustworthy as Zeus with a farmer's
 daughter.

 You reluctantly pull your attention away from the nymphs. The sirens
 sing to the fishes now, while their feathered bodies thrash in the

 Prometheus' liver.

 A naked blond nymph is sitting on your desk, a clipboard resting on
 her crossed legs. She taps her pouty lips with a pen. It falls from
 her delicate fingers, teeters on her knee, and lands on the floor. She
 frowns then bends over.

 You blink your weary eyes. The woman disappears. A nymph secretary
 doesn't come with the job, but the office that does seems just as
 unreal, with decor the dream of any teenager: big-screen television,
 stereo system, and soundproofed walls. Even the window can be covered
 to block exterior light and sound. Outside the window and anchored to
 the building is a drone launch pad. The most important piece of
 equipment, though, remains the desktop computer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Will the Ship Sink?</span>

 Two years ago, an anonymous game creator released <span class="floydstyle em">S.hip of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Theseus,</span> a game that redefined "interactive." The game took place
 on screen and in the "real world." The within-game conspiracies
 spilled over into reality, and players could find their inboxes full
 of incriminating e-mails, their movements followed by cameras, their
 conversations recorded. Players had reason to be suspicious of that
 stranger hanging around the street or the people they saw at the
 grocery store.

 The game became a huge success and eventually an independent game
 creator, Marc Kamen, was outed as its author. Industry came calling,
 but Marc refused their advances. Unfortunately, and apparently without
 warning to family or friends, Marc committed suicide. FromChaos
 obtained the rights to his creation. With their deeper pockets and
 vast resources, FromChaos turned <span class="floydstyle em">S.hip of Theseus</span> into a
 worldwide blockbuster.

 A sequel was inevitable. Earlier this year, FromChaos released
 <span class="floydstyle em">Gaia's Web,</span> which wasn't that sequel, but rather a purely
 text-based introduction to what was to come. This Friday, FromChaos is
 publishing the heavily-anticipated follow-up to <span class="floydstyle em">S.hip,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Re.constructing the Ship of Theseus.</span> Every day this week we
 will be previewing this new release, which boasts that it is
 "interactive fiction that will change your world. Literally."

 For more information on <span class="floydstyle em">S.hip of Theseus,</span> read my review of
 the game.

 Kathryn has attached the review, even though you can just click on the

>read review

 You touch the <span class="floydstyle em">S.hip of Theseus</span> review. <span class="floydstyle i">S.hip of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">Theseus</span>

 I was so pleased to see VM Straka's <span class="floydstyle em">Ship of Theseus</span> adapted
 as a game; he's a criminally underrated writer. <span class="floydstyle em">S.hip of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Theseus</span> is one of the most interesting experiments I've seen
 since <span class="floydstyle em">the House of Leaves</span> ARG disaster, so naturally I was
 excited to see what the developers did. The manner of adaptation feels
 like an homage to its source material: the game blends traditional IF
 tools with new technology as you piece together the multinational
 conspiracy at its heart. Most notably, the game tracks your progress
 via drone surveillance, which is used to trigger later levels and make
 information assimilation more difficult. (Flooding my department was a
 nice touch of verisimilitude for which I applaud the anonymous
 designer.)

 Where <span class="floydstyle em">S.hip of Theseus</span> shines is the incorporation of
 multiplayer format; in Act 2 you're paired with another player, and so
 the narrative shifts. Clues are possible to destroy, depending on how
 careful a reader you are - or your partner is. (There's been a lot of
 complaining about the procedurally-generated pairing lists, but the
 developers quite rightly pointed out that it's possible to rig a
 simple last-in-first-out stack to ensure two friends or lovers are
 paired together. Though I can't imagine why you'd want to - being
 responsible for a loved one's implication in a major government
 for a good 5-7 years if they can forgive you.)

 Chucky (gray squirrel, <span class="floydstyle em">(Sciurus carolinensis</span>): Like all
 animal operatives, squirrels are equipped with a microphone, which is
 useful for listening to conversations and the environment. Small
 animals like squirrels also have brain implants. Upon activation, the
 squirrel will seek out the target game device and remain in the
 vicinity until de-activation. Squirrels do not typically engage in
 physical contact with the players. However, the actions of animals are
 often unpredictable, as are the reactions of players upon encountering
 them.

 Travis Watson (Ontario Provincial Police (OPP)): Travis, 32 years old,
 has been a versatile field agent for 10 years. He is most often used
 to impersonate police officers, for which he has formal training.
 Field agents are not employed by any police department, nor do they
 operate in any official capacity with the police. In some
 jurisdictions, field agents have been granted permission to
 impersonate police officers or detectives, including the use of
 uniforms and vehicles, under strict regulations.

 Samuel Walker (retired): Samuel, a 65-year-old former accountant, has
 been a freelance field agent for six years. He is willing to assume
 many roles, and his versatility means he is comfortable with
 surveillance, reconnaissance, and physical confrontation. His wife,
 Roberta, is also often available, and the two of them frequently
 collaborate.

 Chucky (gray squirrel, <span class="floydstyle em">(Sciurus carolinensis</span>): Like all
 animal operatives, squirrels are equipped with a microphone, which is
 useful for listening to conversations and the environment. Small
 animals like squirrels also have brain implants. Upon activation, the
 squirrel will seek out the target game device and remain in the
 vicinity until de-activation. Squirrels do not typically engage in
 physical contact with the players. However, the actions of animals are
 often unpredictable, as are the reactions of players upon encountering
 them.

 *** Signal from Eve Martin lost. ***

 You think about what may have happened â Eve could have turned off
 her phone â then your phone rings. You're fired. Just like that. Get
 out. As you transferred your players to other titans, you notice that
 Eve had already been removed from your roster. Maybe you weren't her
 designated titan. Was it a bug? But that kind of error shouldn't be
 the reason for firing you. You decide to take some time off and create
 some games of your own.
