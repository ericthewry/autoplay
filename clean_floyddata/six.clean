 Your name is Harriet Leitner, it's the January summer school holidays
 and today has been a great day.

 You turned six this morning! And so did your twin sister, Demi. While
 Demi is your twin, she is not one of those twins who looks the same as
 you. Mum has explained that that's because you and your sister are
 something called fraternal twins. You have decided that you like
 looking just like yourself, and Demi likes it that way, too.

 Today, mum and dad are hosting a fancy dress birthday party for the
 pair of you and six of your friends: Marion, Ayla, Pia, Sam, Vince and
 Jack. You're dressed as a fairy and your sister is dressed as a witch,
 which is what each of you wanted.

 You all ate heaps of lollies and played games in the morning, and now
 your parents have taken you to the park for lunch.

 While mum and dad are setting up the picnic, you and your friends are
 getting ready to play a game of hide and seek tip. Your sister is
 sitting this game out to drink some lemonade and cool down.

 You agree to be in, and count with your eyes shut against a tree while
 your friends run off and hide in the park.

 "... Forty-eight..." you shout at the top of your lungs. You think
 carefully about the next number. It's not easy counting this high, but
 Demi is good at it and she often helps you practise.

 "... Forty-nine..." you shout at the top of your lungs.

 "... Fifty! Ready or not, here I come!"

 You really want to win this game. It's time to catch your friends.



 The Edge of the Park
 You're at the south edge of the park. It's super hot today and the sun
 is pouring down on the grass and the flowerbeds. The trees here reach
 for the sky. Most of them are green and bright, but a few look unhappy
 and are covered in loose, dry leaves which wobble in the breeze. A good
 wind will blow them free.

 From here, paths lead north, east and west through the park, and to the
 south is the picnic area where mum and dad will set up lunch later.

 (If this is your first time playing Six, type HELP to learn some very
 helpful stuff).

 Hi. If you already know how to play modern Interactive Fiction games,
 all you have to do before you start playing Six is learn about the
 features specific to this game. You can do this by glancing through
 topics 2 to 6 from the main help menu before you return to the game.

 If you haven't played Interactive Fiction before, you probably got this
 game running for the first time by reading the "Instruction manual for
 those new to Interactive Fiction" which came with it. That manual
 contains all the information you can find in this built-in help menu,
 and more. So now you're probably ready to leave this menu and play the
 game, but remember that if you ever want a quick refresher course on
 some of Six's special features, you can come back here to the help menu
 by entering the command HELP.

 When you combine the game of Tip with the game of Hide and Seek, you
 get Hide and Seek Tip! Tip is the chasing game you might also know as
 "Tag", depending on where you live.

 In Hide and Seek Tip, the player who is "in" (that's you) closes their
 eyes and counts to fifty while their friends run away and hide. Once
 you've finished counting, you have to go looking for your friends. When
 you find someone, you can't just say, "I see you", like in hide and
 seek. You have to actually touch the person and say "tip". This is
 called tipping someone.

 Once you've found and tipped all six of your friends, you win the game.

 Coming up are some special commands you will need to use to play Six.
 You may discover new ones during the game, too.

 HANDY --- Type this during the game to receive a handy shortened list
 of all the commands listed below.

 TIP (PERSON) --- When you see one of your friends, try to TIP them.

 CHASE (PERSON) (DIRECTION) --- You can use the CHASE command to try to
 chase one of your friends in a particular direction. So if you type
 CHASE JACK WEST, and Jack doesn't outsmart you, Jack will end up
 running west and you will follow him.

 Note that just typing CHASE (PERSON) without mentioning a direction is
 the same as trying to tip that person.

 Chasing your friends where you want them to go can help you catch them,
 so don't forget to try it.

 FOLLOW (PERSON) --- If someone just left the area you're in, you can
 follow them to wherever they went by typing FOLLOW (PERSON). If you go
 somewhere else first, though, you will lose track of any people you
 could have followed from your last location.

 SCORE --- Find out which friends you haven't tipped yet with this
 command.

 TALK (PERSON) --- To start talking to a person or an animal, or to talk
 to them some more, type TALK TO (PERSON), the shorter TALK (PERSON) or
 the supershort T (PERSON). And if there's only one other character
 around, you can just type TALK or T. Characters will say different
 things at different times and in different situations, so do lots of
 talking. If you like the way a conversation is going, TALK to the
 character again right away to keep it going.

 Note that if you've played other Interactive Fiction games, none of the
 other usual communication commands will work here, and none are needed.
 There's no ASK, TELL, YES, NO, ORDER, etc& just TALK.

 SEARCH (SOMETHING) --- Some of your friends will be hiding behind stuff
 in the park. Type SEARCH (SOMETHING) to check if anyone is hiding
 behind it.

 Be careful! Just typing EXAMINE (SOMETHING) will not reveal a hidden
 person, though you will find out whether the object you examined is
 worth searching.

 Also, you can replace the word "search" with "look" or "check" if you
 prefer, so you can type things like LOOK BEHIND TREE or CHECK UNDER
 TABLE, with one exception - typing plain old LOOK (THING) will not
 perform a search. That is no different than typing EXAMINE (THING).

 LISTEN --- If you're walking around the park and you hear someone make
 a noise, you might want to stop and listen carefully to see if you can
 work out where it came from. All you have to do is type LISTEN.

 MAP --- This command displays Demi's map of the park. A separate copy
 of the map is included with Six so that you can view it or print it
 outside the game.

 * HIT ENTER AT THE PROMPT TO REPEAT YOUR LAST COMMAND * --- As in most
 Interactive Fiction games, typing AGAIN (or G) will repeat your last
 command, but there's an easier way to do this in Six - just press ENTER
 at the prompt without typing any command. Using this method also shows
 you your last command, so you can be sure you're repeating the thing
 you actually wanted to repeat.

 Please note that the UNDO command can't be repeated by any of these
 methods. If you want to UNDO several moves in a row without typing UNDO
 each time, you should tap the up arrow key after each UNDO to pull the
 command out of your command history, then press ENTER again.

 COLOUR --- The status bar at the top of the screen is usually coloured
 green. Type COLOUR if you want to pick a different colour for it. Your
 choice will be retained between games.

 EXITS OFF --- The status bar normally displays a list of obvious exits
 from your location. Directions listed in CAPITAL LETTERS go to
 locations you haven't visited yet. If you want to hide this list for
 any reason, type EXITS OFF.

 EXITS ON --- Shows the list of exits in the status bar again.

 EXITS --- Type EXITS on its own to receive a list of obvious exits.
 You'll also be told where those exits lead to, if you happen to know.

 COMPASS OFF --- There's also a compass rose in the status bar to remind
 you which way is North, which way is South, which way is West and which
 way is East. If you'd like to hide the compass and reduce the size of
 the status bar, type COMPASS OFF.

 COMPASS ON --- Shows the compass again.

 VOLUME --- Use this command to set the volume of the game's sound and
 music to levels between 0 (off) and 5 (full volume, the default.)

 * Tip is a game of action, so timing is important in Six. Whenever you
 move or speak, it takes a turn, and everyone else in the game gets the
 chance to do something as well. Sometimes if you don't act at the right
 moment, your friends will escape from you.

 * Typing in commands which don't make you move or talk - for instance,
 LOOK, EXAMINE or SCORE - will not take a turn. If your command doesn't
 work, that also won't take a turn. Six always shows you whether the
 last thing you typed took a turn via the NO TIME indicator, which
 appears in the status bar under your score. Just glance up to the top
 right corner of the screen, and if you see a line of plus signs there
 (+++++++) your last command did NOT take a turn. If the pluses aren't
 there, your last command took a turn as usual.

 * There will be other times when you might want to wait for something
 to happen. To make a turn pass, type WAIT, or the shortcut Z.

 * Tip is a game for persistent people! You should try to tip your
 friends lots of times, as they will always be running away from you.
 There is often a trick to tipping each friend. Pay attention to what
 your friends do and say and where they go as you chase them around.
 Don't forget to SEARCH interesting things you see in the park, too, in
 case your friends are hiding. TALK to all the people and animals you
 can in different situations, and keep talking to them if what they're
 saying is interesting, helpful or fun.

 * Tip is a game for witty people. Your friends will do some things
 differently every time you start a new game of Six, so keep your wits
 about you.

 * Don't forget that you can type HANDY while playing to see a list of
 all the special and utility commands.

 Six takes place in Australia, so depending on where you live in the
 world, you might not know some of these terms you will see in the game.

 Lollies are sweets and chocolates.

 In Australia, it's a tradition that each child at a birthday party
 receives a lolly bag when they leave. The bag is usually small enough
 to sit comfortably in the palm of the hand, and is filled up with an
 assortment of lollies before the party. You won't find out what's in
 your lolly bag until the party is over.

 Fairy bread is white bread spread with margarine, covered in hundreds
 and thousands and cut into triangles. (If you don't know what hundreds
 and thousands are, they might be called "sprinkles" where you live.)
 Fairy bread is commonly served at children's parties.

 The Edge of the Park
 You're at the south edge of the park. It's super hot today and the sun
 is pouring down on the grass and the flowerbeds.

 From here, paths lead north, east and west through the park, and to the
 south is the picnic area where mum and dad will set up lunch later.

 You see some unhappy trees here.

>examine trees
 Unlike the gum trees you can see all around the park, these ones don't
 look healthy. Their crunchy leaves are out of your reach, but it looks
 like the wind could blow them free at any time.

>examine me
 fairy-ish and pretty - at least you were when you saw yourself in the
 mirror at home this morning.

 You give yourself a quick check over now, and... yes, you still look
 great!

>fly

 You don't find anyone behind any of the unhappy trees. They're not very
 wide, which makes them hard to hide behind.

>examine flowerbeds
 They're so pretty. If you weren't playing tip, you might like to
 collect some.

 --- WHOOSH!

 A huge gust of wind suddenly sweeps across the park. "Whooooa!" you cry
 as your fairy wings start to wobble and pull you along. You grab onto
 them to make sure you don't fly away.

 All the leaves from the dried out trees are raining down on the path
 around you...

 You are now surrounded by hundreds of leaves!

 Then, as quickly as it began, the wind drops away. "Whew," you say.

>look
 You're at the south edge of the park. It's super hot today and the sun
 is pouring down on the grass and the flowerbeds.

 From here, paths lead north, east and west through the park, and to the
 south is the picnic area where mum and dad will set up lunch later.

 You see some unhappy trees here.

 Hundreds of leaves are scattered all over the ground.

>count leaves
 tip.

>go east
 Tree Garden
 This corner of the park is called the "Tree Garden", and... what was
 that? You heard someone giggling!

 Lots and lots of big trees have been planted in a neat line which winds
 around the edge of the lawn here. They look like furry people waiting
 in a queue. Someone has mown the grass and everything is really tidy.

 One path winds north towards a shady area under lots of trees, and
 another one goes west.

>listen

 Oh, there's a black bird up in one of the trees who just started
 chirping like crazy! How can you hear anything with that going on? You
 will have to wait until the birdy decides to be quiet - Ah, there, it
 stopped. Now you can listen some more.

>listen

 Now what?... there's an aeroplane flying through the sky. It's making a
 lot of noise. You'll need to wait for the aeroplane to fly away before
 you can have a good listen.

>listen

 There, you heard the giggle again! You walk over towards where it came
 from. You think it came from behind the short, smooth, curly-branched,
 ugly green tree. This is the tree you will look behind.

>examine tree
 There are tall ones, short ones, smooth and rough ones, pointy ones,
 curly ones, pretty and ugly ones, and they come in four colours -
 black, brown, grey and green. Each tree is separated from the next one
 by a wall of bushes, as if each tree in the Tree Garden has its own
 little room, and this is stopping you from seeing around all the trees
 at once. To find out if your friends are hiding behind any of the trees
 using only your eyes, you would have to look behind each tree, one at a
 time. What a lot of work!

>look behind short, smooth, curly-branched, ugly green tree

 After a bit of thinking, you have picked out the short, smooth,
 curly-branched, ugly green tree.

 You tiptoe over to the base of the tree to investigate the bushy area
 around and behind it...


 You've found your friend Ayla! She's hiding behind this tree, curled up
 in a ball with her knees tucked under her chin and her arms wrapped
 around her head. She is dressed as a princess and her gold crown is
 about to fall off. She's probably trying to stop herself from giggling
 or making any other sound. She looks so funny that you want to laugh,
 but she hasn't heard you coming, so you stay quiet so that you can tip
 her.

>tip ayla
 under her arms to see who's there. "Tip!" you say as you pat her on the
 shoulder.


 "Heehee", Ayla giggles. "You got me." She stands up and brushes some
 twigs off her knees, then straightens her crown on her head. "I love
 hiding."


>score
 tip Pia, Vince, Jack, Marion and Sam.

 Ayla is here.

>examine ayla
 light brown skin and super smiley eyes. Her black hair comes down to
 her shoulders and has plaits in it. Today, she is dressed as a
 princess. Her dress is pink and white, and there's a gold crown on her
 head. You like how Ayla has trouble stopping herself from giggling.

>tickle Ayla
 laugh as well.

 "That was fun," says Ayla. "I'll see you at the picnic area." Then she
 runs away to the west.

>go north
 In the Shade by the Mud
 You're in a part of the park that gets less sun because the trees make
 a web of dark overhead.

 Paths go north and south to less shady places.

 There's a big puddle of mud here. Yuck!

 Leaning against one of the gum trees is a big girl in red overalls. It
 looks like she's playing her own game of hide and seek. She has her
 face pressed into her folded arms so that she can't see, and she's
 counting out loud.

 The big girl says, "Twenty..."

>examine mud

>examine girl
 has dirty blond hair and her clothes are dirty. She looks a bit like a
 boy.

>jump in mud

>search trees

 The big girl counts, "Twenty-one."

>go north
 Below the Wall
 You're in a field which is cool and damp. To the west is a stone wall,
 at the top of which is a higher level of the park. It's too high to
 climb over, plus the wall is covered in sticky green stuff that has
 grown in the shade. Near the wall is a great big yellow rock, much
 bigger than yourself.

 Pathways go north and south from here.

>examine rock
 well into the ground. You wonder if someone could be hiding behind it.

>look behind rock

>examine wall
 and up.

>climb wall
 that green stuff, too.

>examine trees

>go north
 West Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 In this dusty corner of the park is the hugest of all the trees. Dad
 said it's called a Moreton Bay Fig. It has roots like crazy ropes and
 bark like an elephant's skin. You feel you could jump on your own head
 hundreds of times and still not reach the top of the tree.

 You are on the west side of the tree and can go around to its east
 side. Paths also go south and west.

 To the north is the entrance to the gazebo. The gazebo is a small house
 with lots of sides, a pointed roof and no walls. (There's a kind of
 fence where the walls would be.) Sometimes people have picnics on the
 table inside, but no-one is in there today, and you can see why. A big
 spider has built his web right across the entrance, and he's sitting in
 the middle of it. He's almost as large as your hand. How horrible!

 Wandering around under the fig tree is Sam the Knight. He is so
 surprised by your arrival that he wobbles and almost trips over one of
 the giant tree roots.

 "Forsooth!" he says, as he prepares to run away from you.

 But what does "forsooth" mean?

>chase sam north
 in the way.

>examine web
 look at it closely because then you'll think about that icky spider.

>take spider

>chase sam east
 make his way around to the other side of the tree by jumping and
 scrambling over the huge roots. It looks like hard work!

 You start to follow him and& gosh, this IS hard work! Each root is like
 a small wall. Some of them you can leap over, some of them you have to
 stop and climb over. You can hear Sam breathing heavily ahead of you as
 you chase him.

 East Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 It is very dark here in the shade of the towering fig tree.

 Paths lead around the tree to the west.

 Sam is here, trying to catch his breath.

>tip sam
 other side of the fig tree, jumping and climbing over its tangle of
 giant tree roots.

>go west
 can after Sam.

 West Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 In this dusty corner of the park is the hugest of all the trees. Dad
 said it's called a Moreton Bay Fig. It has roots like crazy ropes and
 bark like an elephant's skin. You feel you could jump on your own head
 hundreds of times and still not reach the top of the tree.

 You are on the west side of the tree and can go around to its east
 side. Paths also go south and west. A huge spiderweb blocks the
 entrance to the gazebo to the north.

 Sam is here, puffing and panting. His face is red!

>examine sam
 armour. He also has a grey helmet wobbling on his head.

>undo
 [Your last move has been undone.]

>chase sam east
 leap over the roots as he heads for the other side of the tree. Panting
 a bit yourself now, you climb after him...

 East Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 It is very dark here in the shade of the towering fig tree.

 Paths lead around the tree to the west.

 Sam is here, looking exhausted, gulping for air and holding himself up
 with his hands on his knees.

 "Mercy!" he gasps.

>tip sam
 you have lots.

 "Tip!" you say, patting him on the back.


 Sam says, "I think I'll - gasp - have a rest - puff - here before -
 pant - I go back... to the picnic area... forsooth..." Then he plops
 down onto the ground, cross-legged.

>examine sam
 armour. He also has a grey helmet wobbling on his head.

>look
 It is very dark here in the shade of the towering fig tree.

 Paths lead around the tree to the west.

 Sam is sitting here, recovering his breath.

>examine tree
 This is the biggest tree you've ever seen and it makes the biggest

 West Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 In this dusty corner of the park is the hugest of all the trees. Dad
 said it's called a Moreton Bay Fig. It has roots like crazy ropes and
 bark like an elephant's skin. You feel you could jump on your own head
 hundreds of times and still not reach the top of the tree.

 You are on the west side of the tree and can go around to its east
 side. Paths also go south and west. A huge spiderweb blocks the
 entrance to the gazebo to the north.

 There's a giant garden bed here with all the prettiest flowers in the

 Neat paths go south, east and west.

 orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. The garden bed is so big that you

 By the Roundabout
 You're in a nice grassy clearing with paths leading out of it south and
 east.

 Standing by the roundabout and looking very smart is your friend
 Marion. She's dressed as a pirate, wearing a white shirt, a red vest
 and a black pirate's hat, one of those ones shaped like a triangle.
 She's also carrying a sword, and she's pointing it at you now.

 "Ahoy, landlubber!" she cries. "I'm Red Marion and you're on my ship. I
 challenge you to a duel."

 You love how Marion is so good at pretending to be different people.
 She goes to drama after school, and she says she wants to be in movies.

 "What's a duel?" you ask.

 "A duel is where you and me have a fight. You try to zap me with your
 wand and I'll try to zap you with my sword. If you win, you can tip me,
 but if I win, you have to say I won hide and seek."

 "That's not fair!" you say.

 "That's the only way you'll get to tip me, landlubber."

 What is this "landlubber" thing she keeps saying?

 "If you don't win," she adds, "we'll do it again another day and you
 can win then. That's fair, isn't it? So, are you ready to duel?"

 You have a quick think. Will you duel with Marion now?  (Y/N)

 "I'm ready," you say, gripping your wand.

 Marion grins and raises her sword. "Right! I challenge you to a duel,
 landlubber! Winner takes all!"

 "Stop calling me landlubber," you say.

 "Sorry," says Marion. "Okay, I challenge you to a duel, Harriet."

 "Yeah, let's challenge!" you say.


 ZAP - Type this to try to zap Marion with your wand. If you hit her,
 you win!
 DODGE - Type this to try to run or jump out of the way of one of
 Marion's attacks.
 BLOCK - Type this to try to block one of Marion's attacks with your
 wand.

 If you want to let Marion make the next move, you can try to WAIT.

 If you want to see these special commands again, type SPECIAL.

 You can also use regular commands during this duel if you think they
 will help, though most of the time, they won't!


 "Let's go!" shouts Marion.

 She immediately slices her sword towards you and yells out "Zap!"

 That zap from her sword is about to hit you! You better act fast.

>dodge
 Marion takes a couple of quick steps to her right, then holds her sword
 sideways in front of her to protect herself.

>zap
 has her weapon up to protect herself, so she blocks your shot easily
 with one swoosh of the sword.

 "Zap!" she yells, and with a second swoosh, she sends another shot in
 your direction. You aren't ready at all, and the zap lands right on
 your tummy.

 "Oof!" you say, holding your belly.

 "I zapped you, I zapped you!" says Marion. "It's over, landlubber! I
 won!"

 "Don't call me landlubber," you say.

 Because of the deal you made with Marion before the duel, you've lost
 this game of tip. Plus you'll have to tell everyone that Marion beat
 you. How annoying!

 Marion waves her sword over her shoulder and bounces your shot away.
 Now you can see where she's running to. There's a spot where the ground
 goes up a bit like a little hill, and Marion just jumped behind it. She
 pokes her head over the top of the hill and throws another shot at you,
 shouting "Zap!"

 "Peooo!"

 Marion ducks back behind the hill so you can't see her. Waiting for her
 to appear again, you keep your wand pointed at the top of the hill&

 There she is, she just put her head up!

 "Ohhh!" Marion cries, jumping out from behind the hill and stomping
 around. Then you both laugh. Marion walks over to her hat, picks it up
 and puts it back on her head. She comes over to you.

 "You won, so you can tip me now," she says, holding out her open hand.

 "Tip," you say, clapping her hand lightly. Marion smiles.

 By the Hedge Maze
 What was that sound just then? There must be a bird close by.

 West of here is the entrance to the hedge maze. It's a real life maze
 where all the walls are made out of hedges. You've been in there before
 and it can be lots of fun.

 Paths also lead north, south and east from here.

 Marion is walking along here.

 Ugh... A huge, scary black bird is sitting on the hedge beside the
 entrance to the maze. He has no white patches on him, so he's not a
 magpie. He must be a raven.

 Marion walks south.

 This is a really exciting place in the park. It's like a room on

 Below the Treehouse
 You're in a tangly area in the park. There's lots of tall grass waving
 in the breeze like water, and there are weeds growing around the
 flowerbeds and dangling from trees. A metal ladder attached to one tree
 leads up into a treehouse.

 Paths also go north, south and west from here.

 As you approach the treehouse, you easily spot Jack, dressed as
 Spiderman, creeping along behind a curtain of vines. "I see you, Jack!"
 you yell, making him jump.

 Jack grins and sprints away to the west. Yikes, he is super fast!

 On the Triangle-Shaped Path
 The pathway becomes narrow here and splits in three directions. It
 makes you think of a triangle. The flowerbeds here are yellow and
 really pretty.

 You can go north, south or east.

 You see some unhappy trees here.

 Jack is running around here on all fours. He's crazy!

 Hundreds of leaves are scattered all over the ground.

 "Nyah nyah!" he says, circling around you. You find yourself puffing
 and panting trying to get close to him. It's really frustrating.

 "Fairies and girls are lame," he says. "You'll never tip me!"

 How rude! You feel like throwing something at him to annoy him.

 Jack runs off to the east.

 Tree Garden
 This corner of the park is called the "Tree Garden". Lots and lots of
 big trees have been planted in a neat line which winds around the edge
 of the lawn here. They look like furry people waiting in a queue.
 Someone has mown the grass and everything is really tidy.

 One path winds north towards a shady area under lots of trees, and
 another one goes west.

 Below the Treehouse
 You're in a tangly area in the park. There's lots of tall grass waving

 you didn't think you could jump that far without getting hurt. You feel

 second it feels like you have no breath, but quickly you find that you
 are feeling fine and sitting on your bottom in the tall grass in the
 shade below the wall. You push your wings back into place (they must
 have worked) and climb to your feet.

 That was awesome!

 Someone even more surprised by your jump than you is Pia, who is
 struggling to her feet beside you. You caught up to her!

 bring out the party lunch. You and Ayla run straight to the fairy
 bread, but everyone else goes for the little party pies. Jack stuffs a
 whole pie in his mouth at once, which makes everybody laugh, though it
 also makes mum tell him not to be so silly.

 Your name is Demi Leitner, it's the January summer school holidays and
 today has been a great day.

 You turned six this morning! And so did your twin sister, Harriet. As
 soon as you woke up, you ran to get mum and asked her to measure your
 height on the wall. You were very excited to find that you were taller
 again. When your friends started arriving for the birthday party, you
 put your witch's hat on to make yourself taller than all of them, even
 Pia.

 One of the games you played at home this morning was pass the parcel,
 and you had a bit of an argument with Harriet over who was holding the
 parcel when the music stopped for the last time. You're certain it was
 you, and then dad said you could share it, but then you gave the parcel
 to Harriet anyway because you like to see her happy. You're better at
 most games than her, so sometimes you let her win.

 You ate so many lollies this morning, you were starting to feel funny,
 but by the time everyone got to the park for lunch, you felt good
 again. And now it's time to play hide and seek tip. It's going to be
 great!

 You agree to be in, and count with your eyes shut against a tree while
 your friends run off and hide in the park.

 "... Forty-eight..." you shout at the top of your lungs.

 "... Forty-nine..." you shout at the top of your lungs.

 "... Fifty! Ready or not, the witch is coming for you!"

 You really want to win this game. It's time to catch your friends.



 The Edge of the Park
 This is the south edge of the park. The sky is blue and bright today,
 and the air is warm. Pretty flowers shake in the breeze around the base
 of some super-tall trees. A few of the trees look unwell, and the curly
 leaves on the unwell ones are ready to fall off.

 Paths lead north, east and west, and to the south is the picnic area.

>examine trees
 You don't know what kind of trees these unwell-looking trees are, but
 they're not gum trees. Their dying leaves are all curly and crunchy,
 and will probably come down next time there's a strong wind.

>go east
 Tree Garden
 You've come into the Tree Garden. It's super neat here. The big trees
 go around the edge of the lawn in perfect lines. There's a smell in the
 air like someone just mowed the lawn.

 A path goes north into a mysterious-looking shaded area, and another
 goes back west to the edge of the park.

>listen

>examine trees
 pointy trees and curly trees. Some of them look interesting, while
 others... well, the others look boring. The trees come in four colours:
 black, brown, grey and green. A perfectly square wall of bushes grows
 between every pair of trees. It's like a hotel for trees, with each
 tree in its own room.

 You try to find a place to stand where you can see behind all the trees
 at once, but it's impossible. Hmm... it looks like the only way to find
 out if any of your friends are hiding behind any of these trees will be
 to search each tree.

>go north
 In the Shade by the Mud
 This is a shady and damp area in the park. Far overhead, the tree
 branches knot together like fingers, chopping up the sunlight. It feels
 a bit spooky.

 You can leave this shady place by going north or south.

 There's a big puddle of mud here.

 Leaning against a very tall gum tree with her face buried in her arms
 (because she is counting and not peeking) is a big girl wearing red
 overalls. She looks kind of tough.

 The girl turns away from the tree suddenly and fixes her eye on you,
 her hands on her hips. She looks you up and down.

 "I'm Rose, and I don't like witches sneaking up on me," she says. "You
 better not try anything smart with me. This is my park."

 She keeps watching you suspiciously.

 "Don't you do that to me!" says Rose. "I already told you not to be

 You don't like this bossy boots. You have an idea.

 "I could jinx you with my magic," you say. "Do you know what that
 means? You would have bad luck all week. Every time you try walking
 somewhere, you'll trip over. I mean it!"

 You raise your wand towards Rose. She starts to look afraid. It's
 working!..

 Suddenly she frowns. "Liar," she says, "You can't do that."

 Rats!

>push rose into mud

 You can tell that starting a fight with Rose wouldn't be smart.

>trip rose

 "I told you to stop annoying me!" shouts Rose. "That's it!"

 She rushes over to you and gives you a great big shove - right into the
 mud!

 Below the Wall
 You're in a cool, shaded field. It's nice to be out of the heat for a
 moment. To the west is a high stone wall covered in slippery moss. Near
 the base of the wall is a huge yellow rock. It looks like a small
 mountain.

 There is more shade to the south and another path goes north.

 West Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 You stand before the biggest tree in the park, the Moreton Bay Fig. It
 seems to come from a world of giants. Close to the trunk, the roots
 alone are often taller than you are! They coil around each other like
 giant stone snakes. The tree blocks out the sky, and the top is so far
 away you can't see it.

 This is the west side of the tree. You can make your way east around to
 the other side. There are also paths to the south and west.

 To the north is the pointy-roofed little building called the gazebo,
 but nobody is in there today because the way in is blocked by a big
 spider web. Sitting in the middle of the web is the orb weaver spider
 who made it. Wow, that web is amazing!

 Standing in the shade of the tree is a brave knight... well, maybe not
 a brave one. It's Sam. His grey armour doesn't fit him too well, so he
 looks a bit funny.

 "The witch is here!" you shout, pointing your wand at Sam.

 Sam gives a little scream. Yes, he should be afraid of you!

 way.

 --- WHOOSH!

 A  strong gust of wind suddenly sweeps across the park. Your hat tries
 to jump off your head. You grab on to the brim with one hand and wave
 your wand to cast a spell with the other.

 "Wind, stop! I order you!" you yell. The crazy wind keeps blowing.

 "You're not listening!" you shout, as loose leaves from the trees go
 shooting away.

 Then, as quickly as it began, the wind drops away. "That's better," you
 say.

 huge roots of the tree.

 You move to follow Sam but find that in your witch's robes, it's too
 hard to either climb or jump over the big roots. Giving up on this
 idea, you run away from the tree until you are beyond the reach of the
 roots, then circle around to its other side. Unfortunately, this is a
 much slower way of getting around the tree than Sam's way.

 East Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 Very little sunlight reaches this side of the tree. Amongst its giant,
 twisting roots, you feel like you're in a world of stone.

 The only way to go from here is west, to the other side of the tree.

 Sam the knight is here. He looks tense, and ready to run away from you.

 roots.

 West Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 You stand before the biggest tree in the park, the Moreton Bay Fig. It
 seems to come from a world of giants. Close to the trunk, the roots
 alone are often taller than you are! They coil around each other like
 giant stone snakes. The tree blocks out the sky, and the top is so far
 away you can't see it.

 This is the west side of the tree. You can make your way east around to
 the other side. There are also paths to the south and west. The big
 spiderweb blocks the entrance to the gazebo to the north.

>get spider

>move spider
 spiderweb in place on one side. The web falls sideways and the spider
 runs along one of the remaining threads and disappears under the roof
 of the gazebo. You scrape away what's left of the web on the grass.

 "Sorry Mister Spider," you say, "but you were in my way today."

 Now you can go into the gazebo to the north.

>go north
 In the Gazebo
 You are in the gazebo, a building like a small tower with a white fence
 instead of a balcony around the outside of it. If you painted the fence
 black, it would be a very good place for a witch to live.

 There is only one way out of the gazebo, and that is through a gap in
 the fence to the south.

 There is a picnic table here.

 You see Sam looking around for an escape route, but there isn't one -
 you're standing between him and the only way out of the gazebo. You've

 In the garden bed rainbow, first come the red flowers, then the orange

 finally the purple flowers. The garden bed rises quite high from the
 ground, which makes you think someone could be hiding behind it.

>look behind bed
 You can see a black shape there. What is that?

 Suddenly the shape comes to life and flies out into the open, giving
 you a big fright. "AAAH!" you shriek.

 Now you can see that the shape is Pia, who's dressed as a black cat.
 She springs away to the east on her long legs.

 By the Roundabout
 You're in a big grassy clearing at the northwest corner of the park.

 A path leads south towards the hedge maze, and another one goes east
 towards a colourful garden bed.

 You have found Marion, who's dressed as a pirate. She's standing beside
 the roundabout, looking very proud of herself with one hand on her
 waist, the other holding her sword. When she sees you coming, she
 pushes her pirate hat firmly onto her head and raises her sword towards
 you.

 "Ahoy!" she cries. "Ye be on my ship, landlubber!"

 "I'm no landlubber," you tell her. "You shall call me Witch Demi." You
 stand up to look as tall and scary as you can.

 Marion leans on her sword and looks you up and down. She seems to
 decide you are tough enough. "All right Witch Demi," she says, "I'm Red
 Marion, and I challenge you to a duel."

 A duel! You know all about those from Harry Potter.

 "I'll duel you," you say, "and when I win, I'm gonna tip you."

 "And if I win," says Marion, "you have to give up tipping people and
 tell everyone I won this game."

 What a cheeky pirate... but you're not worried, because you're totally
 going to win.

 "Okay Red Marion," you say. "You made a big mistake deciding to mess
 with me." You lift up your wand and hold it tightly. "I'm gonna zap
 you."

 "Uh uh," she says. "I'm gonna zap you."

 "Let's duel!" you say.

>y

 --------  THE DUEL --------


 ZAP - Type this to try to zap Marion with your wand. If you hit her,
 you win!
 DODGE - Type this to try to run or jump out of the way of one of
 Marion's attacks.
 BLOCK - Type this to try to block one of Marion's attacks with your
 wand.

 If you want to let Marion make the next move, you can try to WAIT.

 If you want to see these special commands again, type SPECIAL.

 You can also use regular commands during this duel if you think they
 will help - and they might!


 "Go!" shouts Marion. She dances a little to one side, then sprints
 across the grass in the other direction. It looks like she's headed for
 the roundabout.

>zap marion
 air and does a little dance to twist out of the way. Wow!

 "Missed me," she shouts. "No funny magic words," she yells over her
 shoulder. "You have to say 'zap' or it doesn't count."

 "Okay," you shout back.

 Marion just made it to the far side of the roundabout. There, she
 kneels down so that the bars of the roundabout are giving her some
 cover. She grabs onto them with one hand, then leans out around the
 side of the roundabout to throw a shot at you with her sword - "Zap!"

>block
 but confidently, you begin to move towards the roundabout yourself.
 Marion pokes her head out from behind the bars to check what you're up
 to.

>spin roundabout

>zap marion

 the way.

 Now's your chance. You run forward as quickly as you can to close the
 distance between yourself and the roundabout.

 You made it! Now that you're right beside the roundabout, Marion isn't
 hidden from you any more. She's still kneeling down and hanging off the
 bar on the opposite side of the roundabout with one hand, and she looks
 surprised to see you're so close. "Zap!" she yells, chucking another
 shot at you over the roundabout, though she didn't aim very well.

>dodge
 roundabout! Marion shoots at you again immediately while you're
 confused - "Zap!"

 Rats, she got you!

 "Ha!" says Marion. "Nobody can defeat Red Marion in a duel! You lose,
 Witch Demi."

 Uh oh. You told Marion she would be the winner of this game of tip if
 she beat you in the duel, and that's just what she's done...

 The roundabout is spinning quickly.

 "Argh!" she cries, "ya got me!" Then she rolls around on the ground
 making loud dying noises.

 You help Marion onto her feet, pat her on the back and say, "Tip".


 "Good work, Witch Demi," says Marion, shaking your hand. "You're no
 landlubber after all." She gives you a salute with her sword.

 "Thanks," you say, taking a little bow.

 The roundabout is spinning.

>go south
 By the Hedge Maze
 You hear a bird cry out as you enter this big, open grassy area. To the
 west is the entrance to the hedge maze. It's a great place to hide, so
 you're sure that at least one of your friends will be in there. You
 will have to explore the maze to find out if you're right.

 Paths also lead north, south and east from here.

 Sitting on the hedge beside the entrance to the maze is a big black
 bird, a raven. He must have called out when he saw you coming.

 "Yes, here I am," you say. You feel sure this bird would be the kind to
 help a witch like yourself.

 Marion arrives from the north.

>go west
 In the Hedge Maze
 You have entered the hedge maze. Tall green walls of square hedge bend
 around each other, forming tricky patterns. It's spooky and mysterious,
 even on a sunny day. But it's exciting, too.

 There are yellow arrows painted on the ground wherever you walk here.
 If you ever get lost, you can follow the arrows to the exit.

 &lt;&lt;  You won't need to make a map of the maze - In fact, it cannot be

 &lt;&lt;  Also, compass directions don't work in here. Use LEFT and RIGHT

 Now, how would you like to control your movements while in the maze?
 Please choose one of the following setups by pressing 1 or 2:

 1 - Type LEFT to go left, RIGHT to go right and L to look.
 2 - Type L to go left, R to go right and LOOK to look.

 &lt;&lt;  You chose set up number 2. Remember that typing L will be short for

 location description again while in the maze.

 You just heard someone giggling! It sounded like it came from the

 The hedges are quite close together here. It's almost like having a

 sneaking around?

 You have run into a grassy clearing in the maze. It is quite sunny

 your left and one to your right.

 There's a pink, parrotty bird with a white crest on its head sitting on
 the hedge here. You recognise it as a galah. The galah made a lot of
 noise as you approached, but at the same time, you heard someone
 giggling nearby in the maze. Did that giggle come from the left or the
 right? You're not sure.

 You start to wonder if you're catching up with that giggling person or
 falling behind them. But then you remember that you are a clever and
 powerful witch. You feel confident about continuing the search. And if
 you do feel tired and would rather come back here later, you could
 always exit the maze and search for friends elsewhere for now.

 You have found a grass field in the maze. There's lots of space here to

 goes left, the other right.

 You've found Ayla! She's here in her princess costume. She must have
 been running away from you while you were following her around the
 maze, but it looks like she's not going to run away now.

 Ayla smiles and says, "Here I am."

>tip ayla


 "I had to find you without using my magic," you say.

 Ayla stretches her arms and smiles at the sunshine. Then she turns to
 you and says, "Hey Demi, can I stay with you and help you look for the
 others?"

 Hm. Secretly you'd hoped you could have a cat for a partner, because
 teaming up with a princess doesn't seem as witchy...

 This corner of the park is shaped like a circle, and has a hedge around
 it. In the centre of the clearing is a huge stone koala. The ground

 here.

 You can leave the circle by going north or east.

 Ayla is here.

 There's a little white and orange dog running around here. It looks
 happy, but where is the dog's owner?

 Ayla gasps and says, "Oh, look at this cute doggy." She kneels down and
 rubs the dog's head and chin while the dog jumps around her. "You're
 the cutest, aren't you?" she says to the dog. "Yes, yes, yes!"

 The little dog runs around her in a circle, then shoots off to the

 "Demi, let's follow the doggy," says Ayla, tugging at your sleeve.
 "Come on."

 "Doggy wants to play," says Ayla. "See?" She points at the little dog,
 who is looking back at the pair of you and dancing up and down. "My mum
 says if you don't walk dogs and play with them, they go crazy. This
 doggy wants to play, so we have to play."

 "But I want to look for people now!" you say.

 This is a wild place in the park. The plants are growing crazily,

 You can see paths leading to the north, south and west. To the east you

 very confused. As you both start to laugh, the dog zips to the east.

>go east
 West Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
 You stand before the biggest tree in the park, the Moreton Bay Fig. It
 seems to come from a world of giants. Close to the trunk, the roots
 alone are often taller than you are! They coil around each other like
 giant stone snakes. The tree blocks out the sky, and the top is so far
 away you can't see it.

 This is the west side of the tree. You can make your way east around to
 the other side. There are also paths to the south and west, and you can
 enter the gazebo to the north.

 Ayla is here.

 The little dog is bouncing back and forth here. It still wants to play.

 The little dog wags its tail at you (it reminds you of a flag) then
 charges to the south.

>go south
 Below the Wall
 You're in a cool, shaded field. It's nice to be out of the heat for a
 moment. To the west is a high stone wall covered in slippery moss. Near
 the base of the wall is a huge yellow rock. It looks like a small
 mountain.

 There is more shade to the south and another path goes north.

 Ayla is here.

 The little dog is here, sniffing at the big rock.

>look behind big rock
 out from around the corner. You quietly move around a little further
 and realise that you've found Vince, who's dressed all in green as an
 army soldier. He doesn't realise you've spotted him.

>tip vince
 shock.


 He comes out from behind the yellow rock with a big grin on his face.
 The little dog walks over to him and starts sniffing and pawing at his
 legs. Ayla giggles.

 "What's this dog doing here?" asks Vince.

 "Doggy helped us find you," says Ayla.

 Vince gives the dog an annoyed look. Then he smiles again. "I'm
 practising to be a spy, and I'm pretty good. I was sneaking from one
 hiding place to another while you were looking for me. You girls
 wouldn't have found me without this dog."

 "Yes we would," says Ayla. "We were going to look here anyway, weren't
 we, Demi?"

 "Yeah," you say.

 Vince looks suspicious.


 You already tipped him.

 "I have spy work to do back at the picnic table," says Vince, standing
 up very straight and looking serious. "Excuse me." Then he walks away
 to the south.

>score
 78 turns. You still need to tip Jack.

>go west
 side of the Moreton Bay Fig) or south (to the place in the shade by the
 mud).

>go south
 In the Shade by the Mud
 This is a shady and damp area in the park. Far overhead, the tree
 branches knot together like fingers, chopping up the sunlight. It feels
 a bit spooky.

 You can leave this shady place by going north or south.

 There's a big puddle of mud here.

 Ayla is here.

 Vince is here.

 Rose is here, watching your every move.

 Vince sneaks away to the south.

>go west
 wall) or south (to the tree garden).

>go south
 Tree Garden
 You've come into the Tree Garden. It's super neat here. The big trees
 go around the edge of the lawn in perfect lines. There's a smell in the
 air like someone just mowed the lawn.

 A path goes north into a mysterious-looking shaded area, and another
 goes back west to the edge of the park.

 Ayla is here.

 Vince is here.

 Vince sneaks away to the west.

>go west
 The Edge of the Park
 This is the south edge of the park. The sky is blue and bright today,
 and the air is warm.

 Paths lead north, east and west, and to the south is the picnic area.

 You see some unwell trees here.

 Ayla is here.

 Vince is here.

 Hundreds of leaves are scattered all over the ground. They must have
 fallen when that big wind blew.

 Vince sneaks away to the south.

>go west
 By the Koala Statue
 This corner of the park is shaped like a circle, and has a hedge around
 it. The ground isn't covered in grass, but with honey-coloured stones.
 You like it here.

 You can leave the circle by going north or east.

 The huge stone koala stands before you.

 Ayla is here.

>go north
 On the Triangle-Shaped Path
 Three paths meet here to form a triangle. Pretty yellow flowers have
 been planted beside the pathways.

 You can leave the triangle by going north, south or east.

 Ayla is here.

>go east
 Below the Treehouse
 This is one place in the park where they haven't mown the grass. It's
 like a green ocean which comes up to your waist! It's fun. There are
 also weeds creeping around and hanging from the trees over some
 flowerbeds. In the branches of one tree is a wooden treehouse, and
 there's a metal ladder you can climb up to reach it.

 Paths leave this area to the north, south and west.

 Ayla is here.

 Jack suddenly pops out from behind the treehouse tree in his red and
 blue Spiderman costume.

 Seeing you, Jack dances on the spot for a moment before sprinting off
 to the north.

>go north
 Above the Wall
 This is a wild place in the park. The plants are growing crazily,
 making you feel like you're in a forest or jungle.

 You can see paths leading to the north, south and west. To the east you
 see a stone wall which comes up to your chest. Over the wall, it's a
 long way down to the grass.

 Ayla is here.

 Jack is scampering around here on all fours like a spider - if spiders
 had four legs, but you know they have eight.

 Jack runs off to the west.

>go west
 By the Hedge Maze
 You're in a big, open grassy area. To the west is the entrance to the
 hedge maze.

 Paths also lead north, south and east from here.

 Ayla is here.

 Jack is here, pretending to tip-toe around you.

>chase jack north
 north, just like you wanted! You chase after him.

 By the Roundabout
 You're in a big grassy clearing at the northwest corner of the park.

 A path leads south towards the hedge maze, and another one goes east
 towards a colourful garden bed.

 You see the roundabout.

 Ayla comes running along behind you.

 Jack skids to a halt.

>chase jack east
 get him to run east. You follow close behind him -

 The Giant Garden Bed
 You're beside a giant garden bed. The flowers have been planted to
 create a rainbow pattern, and it's beautiful.

 Ayla comes running along behind you.

 Jack skids to a halt.

 "Watch yourself," says Rose.

 Rose turns back to the tree to continue her counting.

 Jack sticks his tongue out at Rose while she can't see. Ayla giggles.

 Jack runs to the north.

>wait
 secure on your head.

 Rose counts, "Ninety-eight..."

>wait

 Rose says, "Ninety-nine..."

>wait

 Rose says, "One hundred!"

 Rose suddenly stops counting and spins around to keep her eye on you.

>wait

 where you could scoop some of it up.

>get mud

 Rose sees what you're doing and shouts, "Oh no you don't!"

 She rushes over to you and gives you a great big shove - face first
 right into the mud!


 "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!" you scream...

 You're drenched in mud! You can't believe it!

 Your attacker has already run away...

 Rose turns back to the tree to continue her counting.

 Jack makes a crazy face at Rose while she can't see. Ayla giggles.

 Jack runs to the north.

 Rose says, "One hundred and two..."

 Rose sure is a grouch, but... you're not sure you could throw a mud pie
 at a stranger.

 Rose is here, leaning on a tree and counting aloud.

 Rose says, "One hundred and four."

>throw mud at jack
 When Jack gets close again, you chuck your mud pie right at his
 chest... SPLAT!

 "Arrgh!" Jack cries. He looks totally shocked and stands there, holding
 his arms up and checking out his muddy self. Ayla puts her hands over
 her mouth. Then Jack starts to laugh.

 Rose counts, "One hundred and five -"

>tip jack



 You've won! You, Ayla and Jack hurry back to the picnic area where your
 sister and the rest of your friends are waiting for you. Everyone
 congratulates you. Then Jack says, very loudly, "I'm starving," and mum
 and dad bring out the party lunch.

 As soon as Ayla sees the fairy bread, she says "Yum," and runs over to
 stand next to it. Harriet runs over to be beside her.

 While you're all eating, Marion suggests that anyone wearing a hat
 should swap their hat with someone else. You put on Sam's helmet and
 give him your witch's hat. He looks very silly, and Harriet laughs at
 how you look now. Marion puts on Ayla's little gold crown, and Ayla's
 head disappears beneath Marion's giant pirate hat, which makes
 everybody laugh.

 You don't like being without your hat for too long, though, so you take
 it back off Sam pretty quickly. You feel good when you put it back on.

 Whoops, you just remembered the lost dog! As you're about to tell mum
 and dad all about it, a lady comes into the picnic area from the park.
 She is holding a leash, and on the end of that leash is the little dog,
 who looks happy. "I thought I'd lost you, Stevie," the lady says to the
 dog. "We're going to get you a new leash."

 Ayla has seen the lady too, and runs over to talk to her. You don't
 hear what they say to each other, but Ayla pats the dog again before
 waving goodbye to both of them.


 .
 .
 .

 That night, after all your friends have gone home, you and Harriet are
 allowed to stay up past your bedtime to eat some more birthday cake.

 "I don't think you'll ever get to sleep tonight after all this," says
 mum.

 "Nobody can stop me getting to sleep," you say, waving her off. Harriet
 giggles as mum leaves the room.

 "This was the best birthday ever," says Harriet, munching on her slice
 of cake. You definitely agree. You're about to tell her so when you
 notice that she's concentrating hard on her cake, and whenever she
 concentrates hard on food like that, she makes a little happy sound.
 You find it funny, but Harriet doesn't like it when you say she's
 making sounds, so you decide not to mention it.

 "I agree," you say, and you feel very happy.
