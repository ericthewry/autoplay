 "HERE BE DRAGONS" is what the rutter said, but the small island turned
 out to be free of those animals after all. Instead, you landed near a
 tiny village full of friendly natives.

 Aaah, shore leave! You can't remember when the last time was you could
 relax, take a night off and stroll through town to pick up a girl or
 two. It turned out your friend Aten speaks a dialect not unlike that
 of the villagers, and so he joined your captain, who's with the
 village elder at the moment.

 "Too bad for him," you think, grinning, "guess he won't be getting any
 tonight."

 You, on the other hand, are intent to.

 Village Center
 The center of this small village is a roughly circular clearing in the
 jungle-forest that covers most of this island. A gigantic tree stands
 in the middle, reaching hundreds of feet up into the cool night air.
 The huts of the villagers are strewn around the clearing's border,
 close to the jungle.
 A large stone circle contains charred wood from last night's bonfire,
 and there is a rickety wooden platform under one of the lower branches
 of the tree.

 "Ranil! Remember to be back on the Dagon tomorrow at sunrise! Unless
 you want to lose a month's pay, that is," you hear Quartermaster
 Gerhardsen shout in your direction. You nod, and he waves at you and
 disappears out of sight.

>examine me
 You are Ranil Kuami, 22, black, and sailor aboard the "Dagon". You're
 wearing your best clothes for tonightYou're wearing a pair of
 trousers; your favorite talisman hangs around your neck on a thin
 chain. Your left ear is decorated by a small gold ring, and your
 dreadlocks are tamed by a headband.

>examine talisman
 A strange stone, shaped like a deformed pentagram, hangs on a thin
 chain around your neck.

>examine trouser
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine trousers
 You've decided to wear your best shirt and trousers on this occasion,
 along with your leather boots, the left of which hides your favourite
 knife.

>examine knife
 Your trusty knife that has aided you in many a fight against humans as
 well as certain inhabitants of the oceans.

 You are carrying:
   your clothes (being worn)
   your talisman (being worn)

>examine circle
 Several big round stones have been laid out to form an exact circle.
 Inside are the glowing remains of tonight's bonfire, when the
 villagers prepared a boar for their guests.

>examine huts
 The huts are built of wood and seem to be held together with the vines
 that grow everywhere around here. Still, they look comfortable and
 stable enough.

 Upon closer inspection, you notice a rope slung over the branch the
 platform was built under! Looks like this is a kind of gallows, though
 the state of the structure seems to indicate it hasn't been used for a
 long time.

 You can't see any such thing.

 a special meaning for the villagers.

>go north
 As you start to walk, you sense movement from the corner of your eye.
 You turn around only to see the most amazingly beautiful woman walking
 directly towards you. You seem to recall her name as "Lyca".

 "Hello," you say, somewhat sheepishly. She smiles at you and reaches
 for your hand, gently pulling you towards what seems to be her hut.

>follow
 What do you want to follow?

 You can see Lyca here.

 Lyca begins tugging on your arm, towards her hut. This is one
 determined young lady!

>follow lyca
 You allow Lyca to lead you into her hut...

 Lyca's Hut
 Lyca's hut is small, but comfortable. Apart from a few flower
 arrangements, it is entirely undecorated. Much to your surprise, the
 'bed' is much like the sleeping quarters on the Dagon; a hammock made
 of vines is hung from the ceiling, easily large enough for three
 people.
 Lyca motions at you to take off your clothes and begins to do so
 herself.

>take off pants
 You can't see any such thing.

>take off trousers
 You quickly step out of your clothes and discard them.

 Lyca nods approvingly, then smiles and motions you toward the hammock.

>examine knife
 Your trusty knife that has aided you in many a fight against humans as
 well as certain inhabitants of the oceans.

 Sighing and rolling her eyes, Lyca shoves you towards the hammock.

>slap lyca
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>enter hammock
 Lyca jumps on the hammock, landing directly on you. Her hands close
 tightly around your wrists, her thighs sit on yours, effectively
 pinning you to the mat as she slowly begins making love to you. You
 are completely surprised at her fierceness at first, but that doesn't
 take longer than a few seconds.

 Lyca kisses you passionately, still moving slowly, teasingly.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You close your eyes, shuddering with pleasure, as Lyca runs her tongue
 over your throat, her movements in perfect synchronity with the
 caress, her breathing faster.

 Lie back, relax, enjoy -- you have no choice, anyway.

 Pleasure turns to pain as Lyca starts moving faster and faster,
 scratching your wrists with her fingernails, now positively panting--

 You open your eyes and are frozen in terror for a second. What sits on
 you is no longer a woman, but a large wolf!

 Lyca -- the thing -- howls in ecstasy and you in pain as her claws dig
 deeply into your wrists and ankles. Her muzzle moves toward your
 throat, and you prepare for a quick death. Her muzzle touches your
 talisman, and she suddenly howls again, an inhuman scream, and her
 paws loosen the death grip on you. You both lose your balance and fall
 out of the hammock. While the wolf-thing paws at her muzzle, you
 quickly grasp for your clothes and pull your knife from its hidden
 sheath in your boot.

>attack lyca
 As you gather up the clothes in a ball, the wolf jumps at you, he mass
 of her body knocking you to the floor. The next thing you feel is her
 claws tearing your abdomen open, and then unconsciousness kindly takes
 you.

 You can't go that way.
 The Lyca-thing seems to have recovered and stares at you with
 unconcealed lust for murder in her eyes.

 Unfortunately, the wolf-thing is between you and the door.
 The wolf jumps directly at you, this time not attempting to go for
 your throat. You brandish your knife feebly, but she sinks her teeth
 into your arm while the mass of her body knocks you to the floor. The
 next thing you feel is her claws tearing your abdomen open, and then
 unconsciousness kindly takes you.

 (First taking off the talisman)
 Desperately, you throw the talisman at the wolf. She reacts with
 surprising speed, but not fast enough. You watch in amazement as her
 fur seems to catch fire and she emits a blood-curling howl, throwing
 her mass around, coming for you.

 But the pain slows her down and you manage to bury your knife in one
 of her eyes before she can tear you apart. You quickly jump back and
 out of her reach as she crumples to the floor, lifeless, and manage to
 hit your head on a wooden beam, knocking yourself out...

 [Strike any key to continue...]








 You open your eyes and stare along the shaft of a spear pointed
 directly at your throat. On the other end you make out two upset
 villagers. You are pulled to your feet, an unitelligible stream of
 words coming from the men. One grabs you by the hair and turns your
 head where the dead wolf lies.

 Your eyes widen in shock. There lies Lyca, but not the wolf-thing; it
 is the human Lyca, blood-streamed, the knife still stuck in her eye.

 Looking back at the guards, you know it's senseless to try and explain
 yourself. Pure hatred is in their eyes, and one gestures across his
 throat with a finger. Then, they brutally drag you off to a hut
 standing seperate from the others, throw you inside and block the door
 from the other side.

 As you pick yourself up, you notice you're wearing your talisman
 again. Strange.

 Jail Hut
 This hut is bare except for an uncomfortable-looking wooden frame,
 around which vines have been wound to produce a sort of bed. There are
 no windows, so it's rather dark.

 The sound of the door being opened awakes you with a start. In come
 the village Elder and the intimidating shaman, accompanied by the two
 guards. The Elder says something to one of the guards. He quickly
 moves behind you, restraining your hands with rope, then helps you to
 step into your trousers.

 You are quickly led to the platform in the village center, where the
 gallows have already been prepared. The guards push through the small
 crowd of assembled villagers, up the steps, then fasten the rope
 around your neck.

 Just then, you see Gerhardsen and Aten step out of the woods. Seeing
 what's up, they run towards the Elder, your friend shouting something
 in their language.

 You see the shaman and Elder turn towards the two. "Mr. Gerhardsen!
 Aten!" you shout in relief.

 "Don't worry, Ranil, we'll have you out of there in no time," comes
 Gerhardsen's response. He stands in front of the Elder, taller by
 almost a head, and begins shouting at him, with Aten translating. The
 shaman answers back, and soon they are engaged in heated conversation.

 Suddenly, you notice something about the shaman that makes you flinch:
 He is wearing a wolf fur!

 As you open your mouth to join the argument, the guard next to you
 reacts swiftly, wrapping one arm around your torso and covering your
 mouth and nose with the other hand, smothering you.


 You can't see any such thing.

>bite
 What do you want to bite?

 Your mouth is covered!

 The argument is becoming more heated, with everyone shouting at
 everyone else. You struggle for air, but the guard's hand clamps your
 mouth and nose even tighter.

>bite guard
 Desperately, you try and bite the guard's hand. You manage to get the
 side of his hand between your teeth and sink them in. The guard curses
 loudly, pulling his hand back, and the attention focuses on you.

 Angrily, the injured villager shoves you off the platform. You fall
 two or three feet, suspended in mid-air by the rope around your neck.

 Shoving the Elder aside, Aten runs to you and quickly cuts you loose.
 You try to say something, but only manage a croak before the shaman
 shouts something on the top of his lungs.

 You and Aten watch in horror as as the villagers fall to the ground,
 and rise as wolves!

 As you turn and flee blindly towards the ship, you hear the screams of
 poor Gerhardsen behind you as he is being torn to shreds...

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>run
 Aten leads the way with you close behind. You can hear the panting of
 the wolves, hot in pursuit.

 Running through the Woods
 Trees, some of them several hundred feet tall, line the narrow
 trampled path you are running along. They block most of the sunlight;
 it's hard not to accidentally stumble or fall over some hidden bump in
 this twilight.

 Aten is running next to you, breathing heavily.

>run
 The path is well-trodden here, and you manage to pick up more speed.
 The distance to the ship seemed much smaller yesterday evening...

 Running through the Woods
 Trees, some of them several hundred feet tall, line the narrow

 it's hard not to accidentally stumble or fall over some hidden bump in

 Aten is running next to you, breathing heavily.

>run
 For a second, Aten glances over his shoulder at you, but that is
 already too much. He stumbles over a tree-root and falls. You only
 just manage to jump over him.

 You feel bad, but you do not stop running. You know you can't help
 him, the wolves would get you both. "RUN!" he shouts after you, and
 then his screams fill your ears, a cold rage rising in you.

 Running through the Woods
 The forest is less dense here, and you can see the sun standing high,
 dazzling you, but also illuminating your path. Treacherous vines lie
 across the ground, forcing you to concentrate even more on where you
 step.

>run
 You are very exhausted by now, and the wolves, only temporarily
 distracted by Aten, gain on you again.

 Running through the Woods
 You have reached the edge of the forest, and can see the Dagon
 anchoring in the bay. Only a few yards to go!

>run
 Finally, you reach the shore. The boat lies here, but you don't have
 the time to set it afloat. Instead, you jump directly into the cold
 water, swimming a safe distance from the shore. The wolves break out
 of the woods but they stop at the water, howling and hissing. It seems
 they are afraid of it; and you swim towards the Dagon unhindered.

 Quickly, strong hands pull you out of the water and you are escorted
 into the Captain's cabin.

 You quickly explain what happened; and though the story doesn't even
 sound convincing to yourself, Captain Davids believes you.

 "I have heard of werewolves in these parts, but a whole village? This
 evil must be stopped. I have the suspicion that this shaman you spoke
 of is the cause of this evil... if we manage to destroy him, maybe the
 others will be saved, too."

 You nod; it didn't seem that the villagers had any idea of what was
 going on when they were gathered to lynch you.

 "I have an idea. It is very dangerous, but it might work. In my
 library are certain old books; and one of them describes a salve that
 can transform a man into a wolf for some time."

 You nod grimly. "Let me do it."

 "Ranil! It is very dangerous! If you stay in wolf-form too long, you
 might not be able to ever become human again; and I do not know if
 your strength can match that of the shaman. But I can see in your eyes
 that you are determined to do it, and so I shall prepare everything.

 "I know it is only morning, but you must go and sleep now, for you
 will need all your strength later. I shall wake you around midnight."

 Again, you nod, and leave for your hammock in the ship's hold as
 Davids pulls a black-bound leather tome out of his book case. You lie
 down and quickly fall into a troubled sleep.

 [Strike any key to continue...]

 [Strike any key to continue...]








 Shortly after midnight, Davids gently shakes you awake.

 "I have prepared the salve, Ranil. I have to warn you again - it is
 very dangerous to stay in wolf-form too long. Are you sure you really
 want to do this?

 "Yes."

 Davids tells you to remove your clothes, then proceeds to rub the
 salve into your body. "I'm afraid his is going to hurt. Here," he
 hands you a piece of wood, "bite down on this."

 At first, you feel nothing. Then, a tingle runs over your skin, and
 then the pain hits you. You fall to the floor, your teeth grinding
 into the wood, your vision dimmed. Your breath comes in short gasps,
 and an explosion of pain makes you pass out for a few seconds.

 When you can think clearly again, you open your eyes. Everything is
 dark, except for a large red blotch in the center of your vision. You
 inhale deeply and an impossible number of sensations stream from all
 sides.

 Wood, salve, clothes, skin, flesh, blood.

 [Strike any key to continue...]

 You try to rise, but find you are too weak yet. Davids quickly holds
 your muzzle in both hands and ties some rope around it.

 "Sorry, boy, but I can't have you kill anyone yet."

 You growl at him, but he grabs you by the nape of the neck and leads
 you to one of the boats. It is quickly lowered and Davids rows you
 over to the shore. As you jump on the beach, Davids removes the rope
 and quickly makes for the Dagon again.

 "Kill him. And be back in two hours, or it may be too late."


 Beach
 The many different scents on the beach are overwhelming, but there is
 one that is stronger and more evil than all the others.

>smell
 [Since your vision isn't very good as a wolf, you prefer smelling
 things.]

>follow evil
 You put your muzzle to the ground and follow the strong scent to the
 northeast, until you arrive at a...

 Fork in the Path
 The path forks here. Inexplicably, the shaman's scent follows both
 trails, still strong along the northeast and barely tangible to the
 northwest. Your wolf-sense warns you of danger along the first path.

 trails, still strong along the northeast and barely tangible to the
 northwest. Your wolf-sense warns you of danger along the first path.

>go northwest
 You follow the scent along the northwestern trail, but it is soon lost
 in the undergrowth and you are forced to return to the fork.

>go northeast
 Ignoring the warnings of your wolf-sense, you follow the path to the
 northeast. The scent intensifies, and soon you see the shape of the
 shaman before you.

 Suddenly, the feeling of danger becomes even stronger - this is too
 easy. There must be a trap here, somewhere.

 Clearing
 A circular clearing has been cut in the heart of the forest. The
 ground is even; a large stone altar stands here, covered with...
 stuff; you can't make anything out past the shaman's scent.

 The shaman stands here with his back turned to you.

>kill shaman
 You run to attack the shaman, and suddenly sky and earth swap places
 as you run over a certain spot, springing a hidden trap that catches
 you in a tight net!

 Smiling, the shaman turns around and motions into the woods. Ten men
 emerge, and you are quickly lowered to the ground and tightly wrapped
 up with rope. Helplessly, you growl, snarl and snap at everyone that
 comes too close, but the net prevents you from actually hurting
 someone.

 The shaman begins stroking your fur, talking all the time, and
 irritation soon turns to pleasure. After an hour, you have forgotten
 any ties to your former human existence. The shaman orders the
 villagers to release you and offers you a large, bloody steak; you
 greedily devour it, then lay contentedly at the heel of your new
 master.

 The shaman stands here with his back turned to you.

 You tense your muscles, then hurl your body at the shaman with a
 mighty jump, and land only a feet away from him. He whirls around as
 you touch the ground, clearly not having expected this. As he curses,
 you see about ten villagers emerge from the woods.

>fly to shaman

>kill shaman
 Ignoring the inviting smell of the villagers with a mighty effort, you
 jump at the shaman yet again. He tries in vain to protect himself with
 his staff, and as he begins shouting the word of transformation, you
 tear out his throat, spilling blood all over yourself. Somewhere in
 the back of your mind, a voice from your human existence tells you to
 leave, and now!

 You look around to see the villagers lie there like dead, an inviting
 smell of fresh blood stimulating your hunger...

>run
 The smell of blood is overwhelming. You... can't leave. You don't want

 You let out a triumphant howl, and soon see the small boat rowing
 towards you. At the bow stands Davids, a musket in his hand. The boat
 stops a few feet from the shore, and the Captain aims at you.

 "Sorry, Ranil, but this is necessary for our safety."

 He pulls the trigger, and a glittering cloud engulfs you. Blinding
 pain, and then nothing.

 [Strike any key to continue...]

 You awake looking into the worrying face of Captain Davids.

 "Thank God, I thought I'd lost you. Sorry for the silver treatment; it
 was the only way ro make sure you wouldn't kill us."

 You smile, exhausted. "You could have told me before it hurts that
 much."

 Davids opens his mouth, but you stop him with a gesture. "Don't worry.
 I've survived, haven't I? More important is: have I done it?"

 Davids nods and responds, but his words are lost on you as you fade
 back to sleep.
