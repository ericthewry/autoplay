 Tonight, pudding. Tomorrow, the fabled port of Irem. Good things. This
 is just a game to pass the time until then.

 Nevertheless, even in the engine room's warmth you can't help the
 occasional shiver.

 Here's the short version: you're an engineer on a spooky Victorian
 steampunk...steamer; all your shipmates have gone missing during a
 game of Sardines, so you're exploring the ship trying to find them.
 It's a relatively simple game, as text adventures go (read Emily
 Short's guide if you've never played one before), and you really have
 to work at it to die. The protagonist will give you friendly, slightly
 fourth-wall-bending hints if you type v. Don't eat the blood sausage.

 Further notes available for Failbetter fans, MacGyver fans (he's the
 protagonist, though I've assumed no one playing this has seen the
 show), or people reading my crossover fanfic "Ecstasy in Cosmogone",
 depending on how exactly you encountered this game. But that's
 basically all you need to know if you just want to play it. Have fun!

>examine me

 The Innocent Spy. By turns, you're a troubleshooter, secret agent,
 amateur chemist, social worker, juggler, accidental time
 traveller...yeah, it's just as well you don't have business cards. At
 the moment, you're serving as tireless mechanic aboard the good ship
 <span class="floydstyle em">Clipper</span>.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a knife
   duct tape
   silk overalls (being worn)
   a candlestick

>examine tape

 Your last piece. Better make it count. Good thing Irem's so close;
 you'll be able to whip up another batch as soon as you resupply your
 stock of pink dream-linen.

 When did sentences like that become normal for you, again?

>examine knife

 A Scrimshander carving knife. Tough enough to slice bone, it was your
 Neathmas present from the Anonymous Crewmember. Not as good as a Swiss
 Army Knife, of course, but you work with what you've got.

>examine overalls

 Odd living in a place where silk is cheaper than linen, but there you
 are. They're nice and cool when stoking the boilers, at least.

>examine candlestick

 Burns upwards. You have yet to figure out how this works.

>examine engine

 A Leadbeater and Stainrod Illyrian. Triple-expansion, 1000 horsepower.
 Better than the Iron and Misery steeple-chase, that's for sure...

>examine ironmongery

 The Captain makes them in his spare time. Everyone needs a hobby.

>search cushions

 You find nothing of interest.

>move cushions

 It is fixed in place.

>sit on cushions

 That's not something you can sit down on.

>fix engine

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lazarette</span>
 The ship equivalent of a closet, which previous engineers have filled
 with all manner of useful junk. Your first stop when you're working on
 a gadget.

 The engine room is to the east.

>examine junk

 Scraps of brass, bone fragments. Swarf.

>what is swarf

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Peiriannwr</span>
 Peiriannwr: at least, that's the fanciful name the Captain's given it,
 which is almost longer than the space itself. An alcove barely big
 enough to hold your bunk and your crate. The engine room is west.

>examine bunk

 The inevitable pillow and spider-silk sheets. You don't need blankets
 so close to the boilers.

>examine pillow

 Stuffed with white-raven feathers.

>examine feathers

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine look in pillow

 You can't see any such thing.

>look under pillow

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine sheets

 The circles-and-lines motif is a little unfortunate.

>look under bunk

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine crate

 Your organisation is roughly chronological: the topmost layer consists
 of recent Neathmas presents. Sheet music. A map of Southern
 California's seascape. A pale key, which you absently pocket. "For
 opening things," the Captain had said. What things, he hadn't said.

>examine key

 The colour of ash keys. You suspect a pun.

>examine music

 A gift from the Student: "You will keep whistling that one tune, so I
 expanded it into a concerto for you. Though I think it needs cymbals
 for the full effect. And a piano. Maybe an orchestra?"

>examine map

 You'd spent a happy evening with the Herald once, describing the
 familiar waters around your own home port.

 She'd transcribed your words into a fancifully medieval chart,
 lettered in graceful italics, with the odd dragon peeping around the
 margins. You wouldn't want to steer by it, but it's a thing of beauty.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a key

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pump Room</span>
 just in case the stuffing box should leak (it doesn't, at least not
 unduly). The steam-powered pump in here works like a dream. Better
 than most Neath dreams, come to think of it...

 You can see a dipper here.

>examine pump

 One technology that the Neath's got absolutely right; you've never
 needed to lay a finger on the thing.

>examine box

 Protects the supply line between the screws and the engines. Pretty
 metal.

>examine dipper

 Full of bilge water. A trifle acidic.

 and white lead paint.

 Some incongruous cushions are scattered about. Your workshop is west,
 sleeping quarters east, the pump room to the south. The rest of the
 ship lies northwards.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Well</span>
 The Clipper's core, where the smokestack rises toward the roof. A
 brass ladder allows for easy access to the rest of the ship. The
 engine room is south; the boilers are north.

 You can see a Mog here.

 The Mog half-wakes from its slumbers. "My, my, still at it? I might be
 inclined to help you out, for the right price. You know how cats like
 secrets."

 Okay, clearly you have been at zee way too long. Cats don't talk...

 "Oh, can't we? Forgotten that time in Irem already, hey? Where you and
 I will always have been, chasing the source of the Writhing River?"

 It rolls over on its stomach and begins to soliloquise about
 pluperfect tenses. Maybe you will have just gone mad, or maybe the cat
 has. Either way you'd better find your shipmates. Fast.

>examine mog

 The ship's dedicated ratter, though you've yet to catch it at work.
 Apparently devoted to sleeping; but every now and then, you see its
 tail swish.

>ask mog about student

 There is no reply.

>talk to mog

 You've always talked to yourself a lot. Pete calls it a bad habit, but
 you find it soothing in times of stress.

 Seven is the number. An exorbitant price, I admit, but it's a seller's
 market.

>examine smokestack

 You see nothing special about the smokestack.

>examine ladder

 Firm rungs and brass struts, perfect for sliding down.

>exits

 From here, you can go to the north, the south and the up.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boiler Room</span>
 Coal dust perpetually swirls through the hot and sticky air in here.
 Two Scotch boilers dominate the space; the coal bin is little less
 imposing. The Well is south; the hold is north.

 You can see Clay Stokers here.

>examine clay

 Clay steampunk robots. Not much for conversation, but they're
 wonderful firemen.

>examine boilers

 Scotch is a technical term, not a place of origin; these were probably
 made in the Iron Republic.

>look in boilers

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine bin

 A bin. Someone's scratched a note on it.

>read note

 You can't see any such thing.

>read bin

 Eh. They're basically just machinery with legs, far as you can make
 out.

 You choke on the coal dust.

 Not important right now.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hold</span>
 Where all the good stuff's kept. Right now, that just means the last
 of the fuel. The ice vault is west, the lamp room east; everything
 else is south.

 You can see fuel here.

>examine fuel

 Coal. Literally devilish, but it burns nicely.

>examine stuff

 You can't see any such thing.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ice Vault</span>
 If the ship was carrying a Nomad or some cold cargo like that, this is
 the room where it'd be kept. Not much here besides shelves and the
 musty odour of sublimation. The hold is east.

 You can see a sausage here.

>examine sausage

 Dear god, how long has this desiccated object been down here? Since
 the Fall?

 The colour of long-dried blood. Not even the Neath has a name for this
 shade.

>take sausage

 Taken.

>smell

 Freezer burn. Sublimation and oxidation.

 Not important right now.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lamp Room</span>
 More of a cupboard. This is where lanterns are cleaned, candlestick
 holders scraped, and so forth. The hold is west.

 You can see a lantern (empty) here.

>examine lantern

 Brass and battery-powered, one of your few surviving possessions from
 the Surface.

 Too bad double A batteries won't be invented for another ten years.

>get lamp

 You can't see any such thing.

>take lantern

 Taken.

>turn it on

 It isn't something you can switch.

 "Arson isn't my style. Besides, I have to live here afterwards,
 remember?"

 The Mog doesn't seem interested.

>ask mog about secrets

 There is no reply.

>ask mog about mog

 There is no reply.

>kiss mog

 The Mog might not like that. You might not like it either.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shaft</span>
 Dominated by the smokestack and the brass-handled ladder. The
 provision locker is southwest, the Crewmember's cabin is southeast,
 and the landing is north.

>exits

 From here, you can go to the north, the southeast, the southwest, the
 up and the down.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Provisions Locker</span>
 Empty. Good thing the Ship will be reaching Irem tomorrow. The folding
 hatch above bangs occasionally, when one of the Underzee's rare winds
 blows by.

>examine hatch

 It's a cargo hatch. They're pretty straightfoward.

>go up

 The only way up is by opening the whole cargo hatch, and that's a
 palaver even when the ship's safe in port. Best not.

>close hatch

 It isn't something you can close.

 Not important right now.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shaft</span>
 Dominated by the smokestack and the brass-handled ladder. The

 The Crewmember locks their door religiously. They do have this naive
 idea that a cheap mass-produced Carrow lock will keep out any
 intruders.

>unlock door with key

 You can't see any such thing.

   a lantern
   a sausage

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Landing</span>
 A pipsqueak of a passage. The Herald's cabin is west; the Student's
 cabin is east. The galley is northwest, the wardroom is northeast, and
 the shaft to the rest of the ship is south.

>look east

 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Student's Cabin</span>
 Unlocked: but so full of junk that you have trouble getting inside.
 Lamentable relics are perched precariously on top of unread logs,
 clothing lies scattered everywhere, and you can barely make out his
 bunk and crate under the explosion of notebooks.

 This place is definitely a fire trap.

 But that's not what's caught your breath and made your blood run cold.
 It was...you can't remember. Well. Probably nothing to worry about,
 then.

 You can see boots here.

>examine boots

 You approve of the laces.

 A style much favoured in Vienna, for concealing secret messages; you
 spent several precious days of Surface leave chasing down apophany,
 before finding out they had nothing to do with the Great Game.

 Well. Everyone on board knows that the Student is partial to
 Revolutionary philosophy, but these...he must have put in some patient
 grinding to have risen so high in their favours. Has he been lying
 about his true loyalties all this time? What else do none of you know
 about him?

 <span class="floydstyle em">Your terror has increased.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">You have gained a Secret.</span>
>examine notebooks

 Real rag-paper and stylographic pens. Where his work's concerned, the
 Student rather pampers himself.

>read notebooks

 Real rag-paper and stylographic pens. Where his work's concerned, the
 Student rather pampers himself.

>examine bunk

 How long has it been since he washed his bedding? You'll have to have
 a word with him about that, assuming you can remember.

 Huh. Maybe that's his problem.

 You look around the Landing in bewilderment. What were you doing here
 again?

 Uh-oh. This smacks of irrigo. Memory-wiping radiation, you can't stay
 in a room with that stuff very long and hope to accomplish anything.

 Uh, how many times have you had this thought again?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Landing</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 You've never been in here before. Turns out the Herald doesn't need to
 lock her door; even with your candle and a wide-open door to the
 Landing here, it's pitch black inside.

 Almost pitch black. What's that colour, peligin?

>close eyes

 You can't see any such thing.

 If nothing else, there's always the steady thrum-thrum of the engines
 to listen to.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Galley</span>
 Warm and yet singularly uninviting. Maybe it's all the zee-monster
 bloodstains. A butcher's block holds pride of place; next to it is the
 stove, the tap and a crate of supplies. Cupboards line another wall. A
 window looks out on the hold below.

 You can see a samovar (on which is a teapot) here.

>examine block

 The Herald claims she can foretell omens in its ever-changing
 patterns.

 She's joking, of course, but sphinxstone holds stains like nobody's
 business.

>examine stains

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine blood

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine stove

 Big hooting brass contraption. You suspect it'd look nicer if the
 Crewmember wasn't so diligent with the stove blacking.

>open stove

 How would that help?

>examine tap

 Both hot and cold water. Cutters have their faults, but the plumbing's
 good.

 The tap is currently switched off.

>examine crate

 Nothing left but a few fungal crackers.

>examine crackers

 Mr Murgatroyd's worst. They make Powdermilk Biscuits look like haute
 cuisine

>examine cupboards

 All the usual kitchen paraphernalia. Your mug's in here.

>examine mug

 A silver christening-mug, left by some Surface-born officer. The
 others refuse to drink out of it; they say it's unlucky. Good thing
 you're not superstitious, because it's great for tea.

>take mug

 Taken.

>examine window

 Some enterprising zailor chopped a hole in the wall here, so they
 could pulley coal through it instead of lugging it all the way through
 the Well. You have a good view of the piled-up crates below; from here
 their arrangement looks curiously like a staircase.

>examine crates

 Nothing left but a few fungal crackers.

>samovar

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine samovar

 A coal-fired teamaker. Standard fixture on ships across the Underzee.

 On the samovar is a teapot.

>examine teapot

 A blue-and-white Infernal Wedgwood.

>look in it

 You can't see inside, since the teapot is closed.

>open it

 You've been forbidden from doing anything with it except for pouring
 tea, ever since the jello-making fiasco. So much for sheep foot jelly.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wardroom</span>
 Back in Minnesota, they'd call this hyggelig. So many cushions!
 Cushions on the floor, cushions piled up in to serve as tables and
 chairs, half-stuffed cushions waiting to be finished. In more mundane
 furniture, a curiosity cabinet fills one wall; a mirror reflects it
 from the other.

>examine cushions

 The Captain makes them in his spare time. Everyone needs a hobby.

>examine cabinet

 All manner of thing: but the Student's Searing Enigmas are the prize
 of the collection.

>examine enigmas

 Actually, you're not sure what all the fuss is about. Though they are
 very pretty.

 Oh, no. Immortality or no immortality, you wouldn't give tuppence for
 your life if the Student caught you messing around with them.

>examine mirror

 Blonde hair and a California tan.

 You blink; where did that come from? Your hair's dark; and like most
 inhabitants of the Neath, you haven't seen the sun for a long time.
 But then, the Captain had warned that mirrors would might behave oddly
 this close to Irem...Now it only shows you, and the familiar environs
 of the Wardroom.

>touch mirror

 You feel nothing unexpected.

>enter mirror

 That's not something you can enter.

 Fuchsia controls and yellow panelling. It says just how dark the Neath
 is that this combination looks pleasantly subdued rather than, say,
 lurid. There's a big wheel here (which a Clay Man is steering), and
 navigational instruments. The ship's whistle is on the starboard wall.

 You can see an Underzeee and a hassock here.

>examine zee

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine underzeee

 You see nothing special about the Underzeee.

>examine hassock

 Brown plush. You always feel bad about sitting on this one.

>sit on hassock

 That's not something you can sit down on.

>take hassock

 Taken.

>examine clay

 Even a clay robot is smart enough to serve as an autopilot when the
 ship's moving due North.

>ask clay about captain

 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine whistle

 They used to tell watches on ships by the ring of elegant bells. Then
 London entered the Neath, and cost-effective steam-whistles came into
 fashion.

 Silent at present. An emergency cord dangles from the end.

>examine cord

 Emergency mauve. A shade too close to irrigo for your tastes.

>examine controls

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine instruments

 There's a compass here that won't point north, a ratwork watch for
 precise timekeeping, and a thick sheaf of charts, marked "Current
 Alteration", "Previous Alteration", "Alteration before last" and so
 forth...You wonder how the navigator keeps up with it all.
 Engineering's easy work by comparison.

 You still haven't made up your mind whether they're actually wood.
 Improbably expensive for a ship like this, but they look real.

 Tempting to turn those reconditioned relics into something more
 useful. A toaster, say. One of these days you might even do it.

 Lamentable relics are perched precariously on top of unread logs,
 clothing lies scattered everywhere, and you can barely make out his
 bunk and crate under the explosion of notebooks.

 You can see boots here.

>read logs

 You carefully avert your gaze. You're not quite sure what happens to
 unread logs once someone has actually read them.

>examine relics

 Why are academics so fascinated by skulls? Or in this case, clavicles
 and spines as well.

>examine clothing

 The University has a line on peligin-coloured gowns, guaranteed to
 endure through the toughest scientific expeditions. You're kinda
 jealous.

>examine crate

 Weirdly, the crate is empty. Except for a children's picture book.

 You look around the Landing in bewilderment. What were you doing here
 again?

 Uh-oh. This smacks of irrigo. Memory-wiping radiation, you can't stay
 in a room with that stuff very long and hope to accomplish anything.

 Uh, how many times have you had this thought again?

 No, no. These are for Revolutionaries. You're in the Great Game.
 Totally diferent factions.

 Though honestly, you're not completely clear on the distinctions.

>take book

 Best leave it where he left it.

>read book

 A cup and a tree and a sword and a green hill.

 Definitely for kids, with enrapturing but crude chromatic plates.
 Still, they have a fierce kind of life that holds your eye. The most
 striking illustration of the lot is captioned "The utter east,".
 Nothing but fractal green and gold, spiraling off endlessly...

 In the margin the Student has written a single word.

 "Yes?"

 That's all: but you know very well that a scoffing Surfacer shouldn't
 have ever learned this.

 Beneath is the pile of accumulations from previous voyages - a blue
 coticule you picked up in Italy, a port report on the Cumaean Canal.
 Ah ha! Your old jacket. Weather-beaten, but snug and comfortable: you
 slip it on with no small relief. They don't make "em like this yet.

 Belgian blue. You look forward to trying it out on the Scrimshander
 knife, once that needs a whetting.

>examine jacket

 A Frenchman's idea of an American flight jacket, which you picked up
 in a shop in Vancouver. Very cosmopolitan. It's leather, with an
 especially roomy inside pocket.

 In the flight jacket's pocket is a postcard.

 Peiriannwr: at least, that's the fanciful name the Captain's given it,
 which is almost longer than the space itself. An alcove barely big
 enough to hold your bunk and your crate. The engine room is west.

>examine bunk

 The inevitable pillow and spider-silk sheets. You don't need blankets
 so close to the boilers.

>examine sheets

 The circles-and-lines motif is a little unfortunate.

>examine crate

 Your organisation is roughly chronological: the topmost layer consists
 of recent Neathmas presents. Sheet music. A map of Southern
 California's seascape. A pale key, which you absently pocket. "For
 opening things," the Captain had said. What things, he hadn't said.

>examine crate

 Beneath is the pile of accumulations from previous voyages - a blue
 coticule you picked up in Italy, a port report on the Cumaean Canal.
 Ah ha! Your old jacket. Weather-beaten, but snug and comfortable: you
 slip it on with no small relief. They don't make "em like this yet.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Your terror has decreased.</span>
>examine crate

 Enough nostalgia for now. You have other fish to fry.

>examine sheet music

 A gift from the Student: "You will keep whistling that one tune, so I
 expanded it into a concerto for you. Though I think it needs cymbals
 for the full effect. And a piano. Maybe an orchestra?"

>examine map

 You'd spent a happy evening with the Herald once, describing the
 familiar waters around your own home port.

 She'd transcribed your words into a fancifully medieval chart,
 lettered in graceful italics, with the odd dragon peeping around the
 margins. You wouldn't want to steer by it, but it's a thing of beauty.

>examine coticle

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine coticule

 Belgian blue. You look forward to trying it out on the Scrimshander
 knife, once that needs a whetting.

>examine report

 You copied out the Captain's notes and added a few annotations of your
 own. The Great Game remains the Great Game, whether it's 1895 or
 1995...

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a flight jacket (being worn)
   a key
   a knife
   duct tape
   silk overalls (being worn)
   a candlestick

>examine jacket

 A Frenchman's idea of an American flight jacket, which you picked up
 in a shop in Vancouver. Very cosmopolitan. It's leather, with an
 especially roomy inside pocket.

>examine key

 The colour of ash keys. You suspect a pun.

>examine knife

 A Scrimshander carving knife. Tough enough to slice bone, it was your
 Neathmas present from the Anonymous Crewmember. Not as good as a Swiss
 Army Knife, of course, but you work with what you've got.

>examine tape

 Your last piece. Better make it count. Good thing Irem's so close;
 you'll be able to whip up another batch as soon as you resupply your
 stock of pink dream-linen.

 When did sentences like that become normal for you, again?

>examine overalls

 Odd living in a place where silk is cheaper than linen, but there you
 are. They're nice and cool when stoking the boilers, at least.

 Examine (x for short) is the main one. You can get through most of the
 game on that. Seek is your all-purpose command to look for your
 shipmates (and other things) in each room. Type V if you need a hint,
 I for Inventory, exits if you want to know how to leave a room. You
 move around by typing compass directions, not starboard or port
 (diagonals get messy otherwise). If you want to increase the Spy's
 terror level quickly, type MacGyver. Undo is your friend.

 Cut (something), crawl, drop (something), drink (something), eat
 (something), listen, pick (something), pray to (something), sing,
 sleep, slide, smell, stargaze, swear, take (something), talk to
 (something), tape (something), wear (something), whistle, xyzzy. Oh,
 and don't actually type the parentheticals.

 The Mog half-wakes from its slumbers. "My, my, still at it? I might be

 secrets."

 Okay, clearly you have been at zee way too long. Cats don't talk...

 "Oh, can't we? Forgotten that time in Irem already, hey? Where you and
 I will always have been, chasing the source of the Writhing River?"

 It rolls over on its stomach and begins to soliloquise about
 pluperfect tenses. Maybe you will have just gone mad, or maybe the cat
 has. Either way you'd better find your shipmates. Fast.

 Back in Minnesota, they'd call this hyggelig. So many cushions!
 Cushions on the floor, cushions piled up in to serve as tables and

 So many cushions! Cushions on the floor, cushions piled up in to serve
 as tables and chairs, half-stuffed cushions waiting to be finished. In

 inhabitants of the Neath, you haven't seen the sun for a long time.
 But then, the Captain had warned that mirrors would might behave oddly
 this close to Irem...Now it only shows you, and the familiar environs

 spent several precious days of Surface leave chasing down apophany,
 before finding out they had nothing to do with the Great Game.

 Well. Everyone on board knows that the Student is partial to
 Revolutionary philosophy, but these...he must have put in some patient

 Nothing unfamiliar here, of course, you know every inch of the ship
 inside and out...but the labels are new. Quite clearly marked; the
 ship's engineer gets the proper cabin up here, while regular crew
 squeeze in where they can below. So you've got your rooms swapped, and
 the Crewmember ought to be down in the Peiriannwr instead.

 Not that you even want a cabin so far away from the engines, but is
 there no honour among zailors? And this isn't the first time they've
 lied to you, either.<span class="floydstyle em">Your terror has increased.</span>

 The Innocent Spy gets completely distracted from what he was doing and
 wanders down to his workshop, chatting all the while. "Did you know
 that in 1982, the US Mint reversed the composition of the penny? Went
 from 95% copper, 5% zinc to 97.5% zinc, 2.5% copper, and the funny
 thing about zinc is, it's a lot more reactive. Trying to lose its
 electrons so it can settle down into a nice stable carbonate...the
 upshot of all this is, if I sand down a handful of pennies so that
 both metals are exposed for electrodes, soak "em in salt water for the
 electrolyte, little bit of this and that to hold it all together, we
 have one jury-rigged battery! Should be just right for that old
 lantern of mine."

 It is. He's a much better chemist than he is a spy.

 Your Terror ranges from 0 to 100; you start the game at 20. As per
 "Sunless Sea", odd things begin to happen when it gets too high.

 Wounds are self-explanatory. Get three of them and you die.

 Secrets are a Neath currency. The Mog can elaborate.

 There's undoubtedly a really awesome puzzle game to be made with Mac
 as the protagonist (and I may even write it some day), but this one's
 heavy on setting and light on MacGyving. Sorry. On the plus side, I
 did include duct tape.

 Long story short, our favourite troubleshooter is on long-term
 assignment in a Lovecraftian sunless sea, where his relentlessly
 cheerful attittude regularly perplexes his shipmates; he's also having
 a lot of fun messing around with Victorian steampunk technology.
 Unfortunately he can't remember his name just now (there was an
 accident involving radiation, "Sister Golden Hair" and a bottle of
 yoghurt), but, well. These things happen.

 By the way, the V command stands for voiceover.

 Type v and the Innocent Spy will suggest something to do next. Or just
 chat, if you're done with that location.

 Lamentable relics are perched precariously on top of unread logs,
 clothing lies scattered everywhere, and you can barely make out his
 bunk and crate under the explosion of notebooks.

 You can see boots here.

 You are carrying:
   a knife
   a hassock
   a mug
   a key
   fuel
   a storm lamp (providing light)
   a candlestick
   a teapot
   a sausage
   duct tape
   a flight jacket (being worn)
   silk overalls (being worn)

 You look around the Landing in bewilderment. What were you doing here
 again?

 Uh-oh. This smacks of irrigo. Memory-wiping radiation, you can't stay
 in a room with that stuff very long and hope to accomplish anything.

 Uh, how many times have you had this thought again?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Landing</span>

 Baroque. Salt cement tiles give way to drapery the colour of

 A brass rod running along one wall holds a selection of dresses,
 nearly hiding her crate from view; the bunk lies along the other.

 Tonight, pudding. Tomorrow, the fabled port of Irem. Good things. This

 Nevertheless, even in the engine room's warmth you can't help the

 The Mog half-wakes from its slumbers. "My, my, still at it? I might be
 inclined to help you out, for the right price. You know how cats like
 secrets."

 Okay, clearly you have been at zee way too long. Cats don't talk...

 "Oh, can't we? Forgotten that time in Irem already, hey? Where you and
 I will always have been, chasing the source of the Writhing River?"

 It rolls over on its stomach and begins to soliloquise about
 pluperfect tenses. Maybe you will have just gone mad, or maybe the cat
 has. Either way you'd better find your shipmates. Fast.
