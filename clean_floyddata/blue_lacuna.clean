 Prologue

 *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *



 Waves.

 Dreams move beneath you, blind colossi revolving through unknowable
 patterns, but they do not break the surface, not yet or any more. You
 float in void outside them, cold, memoryless.

 Not true. You are a Wayfarer, and will always remember that.

 But uneasiness rises within you. Lost, for strange moments you can not
 even remember if you are <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> or <span class="floydstyle em">woman</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tutorial: Type emphasized keywords like MAN or WOMAN to advance the</span>
 story. Type KEYWORDS if these words do not appear emphasized in the
 previous paragraph.


 .

>make love

 (to yourself)

>love

 Before anything, you must remember: are you <span class="floydstyle em">male</span> or
 <span class="floydstyle em">female</span>?


>woman

 Relief breaks against you, a deep ocean wave of reassurance. Of
 course. You are a wayfarer, and a woman. The rest can wait till
 waking.

 But already trickles of wake intrude, seeping into you. Warmth and
 softness, and the arms of another, embracing you. Another wave washes
 through, this one of dull desire; but again strange vertigo grips you,
 for you're not even sure if it's a <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> or a <span class="floydstyle em">woman</span>
 your waking self holds in her arms.

>woman

 It seems right the moment you think it, right and real, and you float
 together over dream seas, rays of light stretching down to blue
 infinitudes even as pinpricks of reality dissolve them away. Warm furs
 on bare skin, pine and woodsmoke, stream and fire, and Rume, your
 woman, sleeping against you. Home, for now.

 For now.

 How many worlds have you moved through, wayfarer? Will you ever stop
 moving?

 Rume stirs, the touch of her breast hot against you. You are both
 half-asleep or half-awake, only together forming a whole being with
 the promise of something pleasant and instinctual taking shape in its
 sleepy mind.

 But another desire stirs in you, equally compelling. Dawn and sleep
 are distant now, and a blank canvas waits in your studio below. A
 sudden ache as strong or stronger as your first impulse thrills you
 with desire to paint, create, bring life and form to the images
 coalescing inside you, no matter the consequences.

 Beside you, Rume shifts again, edging closer, blood pulsing faster in
 her veins, and you must choose. Do you make <span class="floydstyle em">art</span>, or make
 <span class="floydstyle em">love</span>?

>war

 Before anything, you must remember: make <span class="floydstyle em">love</span> or make
 <span class="floydstyle em">art</span>?


>love

 The physical presence of the woman beside you, her tangible power,
 dissolves away all other desires. You pull her close.

 Waves. The remnants of dream fuse into this new reality without a
 seam. You roll together, riding peaks and troughs of infinite blue,
 gasps and vague portents and hot insights suffused in the power of the
 moment, in the hot breath in your ear, in the dandelion touches on
 delicate nerves. Worlds you've explored, loves you've known, lives
 beyond or behind this moment are all forgotten in the freedom of this
 now, this dim and burning now...

 Afterwards. Breaths out of sync, pools of cool sweat beneath each
 fingertip. And something gradual begins to intrude on your cooling
 bliss, some delicate itch. And an odd feeling creeps upon you that
 things are about to change, a sense of waves receding, perhaps
 forever, something calling them home.

 Calling...

 And in a heartbeat you know the feeling, recognize it. The Call.

 The Call pulls wayfarers together across time and dimension.
 Unconscious, unexplained, yet crisp, real. And when a wayfarer hears
 it, she knows another wayfarer is somewhere, somehow in trouble.

 But Rume is not a wayfarer. And she cannot go with you.

 You let long moments pass before you open your eyes.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Loft</span> (on the bed)
 Firelight trickles through the open doorway into this long loft, seeps
 deep into huge wooden beams strung with pine <span class="floydstyle em">boughs</span> angling
 above your head. You lie in the warmth of your bed, buffered from the
 air's winter chill by layers of warm <span class="floydstyle em">furs</span>.

 Next to you lies <span class="floydstyle em">Rume</span>, breathing quietly, already asleep
 again. Beside you sits a simple <span class="floydstyle em">nightstand</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Object keywords are </span><span class="floydstyle em">things</span><span class="floydstyle i"> you can</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">examine. Type an object keyword to learn more about that thing</span>.

>furs

 Brown and black, thick with the heavy warmth once needed by creatures
 who slept through long mountain winters.

>rume

 Her features are only just distinct in the dim and flickering
 firelight. A year. You've known her a year now, and she looks the same
 as the day you met, in the dazzling light of a high and snow-scraped
 cirque. A life spent exploring this alpine world has infused winter
 into Rume's face; her nordic cheekbones, bleached hair, and ruddy
 cheeks hint at coldness, but the warmth of her touch, her laugh, her
 soul, dominates. There is fire in her sea-blue eyes, and from the
 moment you met her it burned in yours too.

 Now, three months after this mountain cabin became your shared home,
 you see other things in Rume's face as well. You know what it looks
 like in anger, in pride, in guilt. You can imagine now as you never
 could before how that face will age, the lines along which youth and
 energy will drain until one day only a dry mask remains, faded and
 cold. In your life you have seen death, but not aging. Never aging.

 But now?

 No matter how many final decisions you've made, no matter how many
 times you've put the question behind you for good, it still lingers.
 Could you truly give up your gift, the magic heart of your soul, to
 grow old here with Rume, on this world of kind people but cold and
 bitter winds? Could you really never know the breeze of another world
 again, the tang and rush of new reality? You have always been a
 wayfarer. Who would you be if you let that go?

 You look away, at last, as if from the sun. The questions burn too
 deep.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: If no keywords are visible, type LOOK or press enter to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">get a fresh description</span>.


>boughs

 Arranged gracefully across the slanted ceiling, the pine boughs infuse
 the room with the scent of the forest outside, while somehow making
 this mostly empty space seem whole. Rume's work again: undeniably
 right, but you'd have never thought to do it.

>nightstand

 Made simply from unfinished pine, it has the naked functionality and
 unexpected beauty that marks everything made by Rume's hands. Atop it
 rests a framed <span class="floydstyle em">drawing</span> and a small round <span class="floydstyle em">mirror</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Sometimes by examining things more closely, we learn</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">about other objects we may not have noticed at first</span>.

>drawing

 Set in a wide frame of grey stone, Rume gave you this pencil sketch
 some weeks ago. She had rarely drawn before, which to you makes the
 sketch even more remarkable: two gracefully feminine hands, entwined,
 but the difference between yours and Rume's clear. Though crudely
 drawn it has as much power in it as anything you have painted, and the
 intensity of everything Rume creates.

 In darker moments, you cannot help but see the strength with which
 Rume's hand clutches yours in the drawing. In darker moments, you
 wonder whether your hand is trying to pull away.

>mirror

 The brass stand and edging is adorned with simple repeated patterns
 like everything the craftsfolk of this mountainous country put hand
 to. Inside the dark circle you see only your own <span class="floydstyle em">reflection</span>.

>reflection

 You are the one constant in your life, and even you change. Studying
 your sleepy eyes, you wonder what happened to the terrified girl who
 first painted her way into another world, the brave teenager eager for
 a life of adventure, the bitter young woman first touched by pain.
 Perhaps they still exist, somewhere in those worlds you left behind,
 trapped forever in amber.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: If you don't see any new keywords on screen, you can type</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">LOOK or press enter</span>.

>things

 Nearby are the furs, the refracted firelight, the small round mirror,
 the framed drawing, the pine boughs, and the wooden ceiling beams.

>exits

 Faint red firelight gutters through the open <span class="floydstyle u1">doorway</span>.

>firelight

 The remnants of last night's fire down on the lodge's main floor are
 mostly shadow now, but in the black of night provide just enough light
 to see by.

>beams

 Sturdy wood that has stood for many winters and should stand many
 more.

>topic

 Here are some of the albums that were on constant play during my
 writing of Blue Lacuna, along with, in some cases, which sequence they
 helped shape. These albums can perhaps be thought of as the unofficial
 soundtrack:

 Gyorgi Ligeti, Requiem
  Lisa Gerrard, The Silver Tree -- the Windsigh
 Ryan Miller, Tim Larkin and Jack Wall, soundtracks to the Myst games
 -- exploring
  Michael Stearns, The Lost World -- the eastern forest
  Colleen, The Golden Morning Breaks -- Phoebe and Lethe
  amiina, Animamina and Kurr -- Phoebe and Lethe
  Kenji Kawai, Ghost In The Shell Soundtrack -- The Great Philosopher
 Robert Rich, Gaudi / Below Zero -- The Heart of the Forest
  Jakob Draminsky Højmark, En Landsoldats Dagbog -- Progue's Despair
  Jocelyn Pook, various -- painting
  Jeremy Soule, Game Soundtracks
  Michael Andrews, Donnie Darko Original Score -- Progue's Playfulness
  Aphex Twin, Melodies From Mars -- Progue
  Eluvium, various albums -- the dreams

 And other albums which are not tied to particular moments but which
 nevertheless received heavy play during the writing:

 Geinoh Yamashirogumi, Akira Soundtrack / Ecophony Gaia
  Brian Tyler, Children of Dune
  Matt Uelmen, Diablo II Soundtrack
  Leon Willet, Dreamfall Soundtrack
  Philip Glass, Koyaanisquatsi
  Paul Ruskay, Homeworld Soundtrack
  Juno Reactor, Labyrinth
  Sigur Rós, various albums
  Lemon Demon
  Vangelis, various albums
  Clint Mansell, The Fountain
  and the entire Jonathan Coulton catalog.

>talk to rume

 She has already fallen asleep again, so deep and complete that for the
 moment you can't imagine her awake again, a faint smile still
 lingering on her lips. You'll come back to say goodbye, if... or
 before.

>kiss rume

 Already Rume has drifted back to sleep, but you're more awake than
 you've been in a year. You kiss her cheek, hand lingering on her warm
 shoulder. You'll come back to say goodbye, if... or before.

>take rume

 You wrap your arms around Rume for long moments, feeding off the heat
 of her deep sleep, but now that you've fed one need, the other grows
 deeper and deeper inside you. The Call beckons, itches. You must
 answer.

>dance with rume

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You don't always need to specify what you're doing something with.</span>
 (retrying as if you'd typed "dance .")

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You aren't talking to Rume right now; type HELLO to begin</span>
 conversing.

>dance

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You aren't talking to Rume right now; type HELLO to begin</span>

>scratch itch

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You used either a verb or a keyword I don't recognize, at least not</span>
 in that combination.

>take all

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">For various reasons, use of ALL is not allowed in Blue Lacuna.</span>
 Please deal with objects one at a time instead.

>take boughs

 This is not the time to redecorate.

>take mirror

 You'd rather not carry that around.

>doorway

 (first leaving the bed)

 You pass through the open doorway, old floorboards creaking
 comfortably under your feet, into the light and open space of the rest
 of the lodge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Tumble, On the Balcony</span>
 The <span class="floydstyle em">balcony</span> overlooks the roomy interior of the lodge,
 running the length of one wall covered in <span class="floydstyle em">shelves</span>. Beneath
 your feet, the chattering <span class="floydstyle em">stream</span> that named this place
 emerges from its bed under the loft, tumbling down the exposed rock
 face to the main floor below.

 Stairs parallel the stream's journey <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to the kitchen, and
 an open <span class="floydstyle u1">doorway</span> leads back into the dark interior of the
 loft.

 Only the glow of the fire below is reflected in the black skylights
 slanting above you. It must still be very early.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: You can save your progress in the story by typing SAVE,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">and return to the same point later by typing RESTORE. If you ever want</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">to "take back a move," you can type UNDO</span>.

>balcony

 The balcony runs above and alongside the studio and kitchen, an
 extension of the loft and separated from it by a simple partition. A
 wooden railing guards the drop, topped by lacquered branches, gnarled
 and ancient, and the stairs follow the stream <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to the
 ground floor below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tutorial: By adding a verb before an object keyword, you can</span>
 perform actions. You could try SHELVES, then READ BOOKS, TOUCH
 TRINKETS, or TAKE LAMP.

>take lamp

 You pick up the unlit lamp gently.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Though you can take this lamp, most of the time you won't</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">need to carry objects around with you. In fact, it's possible to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">finish the story without taking or dropping anything</span>.

>shelves

 The shelves are still mostly empty, waiting to creak under the weight
 of years of occupation: a few <span class="floydstyle em">books</span>, some rocks and pine
 cones and other <span class="floydstyle em">trinkets</span> of nature.

>books

 A few leather-bound journals; smudgy reprints of distant travelers'
 tales; fraying tomes with peeling binding on trapper medicine,
 wilderness cooking, alpine survival.

>read books

 You've spent long hours curled by the fire exploring these volumes,
 most of which have haunted this old shelf since long before you came
 here. But now, you're too keyed up to read.

>take books

 You pick up one worn volume, a grey and practical manual on canning
 preserves and salting meat for winter, and trace your fingers across
 its age-stained surface. But your mind is too filled with images to
 focus on words. You return the book to its shelf.

>lick books

 <span class="floydstyle i">Apologies, but that isn't  something the story expected you to try</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">eating</span>.

>examine lamp

 The civilization of this alpine world is simpler than some, but
 graceful elegance permeates the people here, grace you find somehow
 comforting. This simple lamp is a perfect example, in the dignified
 curves of its glass hood, the polished sheen of the brass base, even
 the delicate weave of its wick.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Remember, if you don't see any new keywords on screen,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">you can type LOOK or press enter</span>.

>trinkets

 You toy delicately with the pine cones, smooth or strange stones, and
 shells or fossils that Rume has brought back from her wanderings, till
 your fingers touch one fractured half of a small crude statue,
 thumb-sized, idols of an ancient people that often turn up near
 riverbeds and caves here.

 Fractured. You remember Rume smashing it against the ground, face
 twisted in anger. Your first real argument, and so soon. So soon.
 Maybe you made a mistake in staying. Or she did.

>get out now

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A lot of words like prepositions and adverbs are not necessary in</span>
 interactive fiction.
 (retrying as if you'd typed "get out .")

 I'm not sure which way you mean. Stairs parallel the stream's journey
 <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to the kitchen, and an open <span class="floydstyle u1">doorway</span> leads back
 into the dark interior of the loft.

>send break up text

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You used either a verb or a keyword I don't recognize, at least not</span>

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Tumble, On the Balcony</span>
 The <span class="floydstyle em">balcony</span> overlooks the roomy interior of the lodge,
 running the length of one wall covered in <span class="floydstyle em">shelves</span>. Beneath
 your feet, the chattering <span class="floydstyle em">stream</span> that named this place
 emerges from its bed under the loft, tumbling down the exposed rock

 Stairs parallel the stream's journey <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to the kitchen, and
 an open <span class="floydstyle u1">doorway</span> leads back into the dark interior of the
 loft.

 Only the glow of the fire below is reflected in the black skylights
 slanting above you. It must still be very early.

>stream

 The lodge is built around the stream, its centerpiece and soul, so
 much so that the old trapper who left it to you named the place the
 Tumble. The ice-cold mountain water flows beneath the loft, then
 dances its way down the exposed natural rock face separating the upper
 level from the lower. It pools in a rock pond at the base of the
 stairs, then flows through a sculpted streambed that bisects the great
 boards of the main floor. Near the front door it escapes through a
 drain to continue its journey down the mountain outside your walls.

>go down

 You descend the curved staircase silently, following the stream as it
 tumbles down the slope, touching the polished wood of the banister
 more for comfort than balance.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The spacious main floor of the lodge is divided into two halves by the
 stream running through its center. This side is for practical things:
 flat countertops and spacious pine <span class="floydstyle em">cupboards</span> and a clatter of
 hanging pots, pans, and skewers. Rugged chairs at a small round
 <span class="floydstyle em">table</span> overlook the stream's tiny <span class="floydstyle em">pool</span>.

 A slanted <span class="floydstyle u1">trapdoor</span> leads to the cellar, opposite the path
 <span class="floydstyle u1">across</span> the stream, while the staircase curves <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> to
 the balcony.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Not all verbs require keywords. You might try to SIT,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">SWIM, or LISTEN</span>.

>swim

 The pool is too small and cold for swimming, but on warmer nights it
 feels good to sit on the curved edge where the wooden floorboards meet
 its rocky lip, and soak the day's cares from your feet.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: You can type HELP to see a list of other verbs the story</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">understands. The help menu also offers more detailed instructions and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">information about the story</span>.

>cupboards

 You swing a cupboard open and the redolent smell of wood and
 seasonings spills out. The cupboards are full of the minutiae of life
 on the edge of the alpine wilderness: jars of dried herbs and spice,
 coarse-woven bags of salt, sugar, and flour, decanters of oil, bins of
 venison and fish jerky, huge glass jars of pickled vegetables, piled
 bulbs of garlic.

 You are struck suddenly with bitter futility: the months spent
 gathering together these comforts, the hours wasted sorting and
 arranging them, preparing for a life and a winter you're about to
 abandon forever.

>table

 Just large enough for three: Rume, yourself, and the odd trapper or
 trader who spies the smoke of your fire and feels a need for warmth,
 food, and companionship.

>pool

 At the base of the small cliff, the stream tumbles into a small pool
 before continuing across the floor of the lodge.

>across

 (new <span class="floydstyle u1">landmark</span> discovered)
 You step lightly over the flat stones crossing the stream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Studio</span>
 Your art has claimed this side of the main floor; paint-spattered
 canvas twists crumpled underfoot, palettes and buckets and brushes
 stacked and strewn between them. Abstract <span class="floydstyle em">studies</span> lie in
 piles where you've abandoned them, except a few Rume has saved and
 pinned to the wall. The <span class="floydstyle em">fire</span> burns low, painting the interior
 of the lodge with dull heat and molten glow.

 A wide blank <span class="floydstyle em">canvas</span> stands on an easel in the center of the
 studio, space cleared around it like the eye of a storm.

 The solid front <span class="floydstyle u1">door</span> is shut tight against the frigid night
 air. Opposite the fire, a few flat stones lead <span class="floydstyle u1">across</span> the
 stream to the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Type LANDMARK to see a list of important areas you've</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">discovered</span>.

>landmark

 The landmarks you can go to are:
   your <span class="floydstyle u1">bedroom</span>
   the <span class="floydstyle u1">studio</span> (you are here)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tutorial:  Type one of the listed direction keywords to quickly</span>
 return to that area.

>studies

 Not studies in the sense of a student hoping to learn, but of a master
 surveying his domain in satisfaction and reflection. For you are a
 master. There's no ego or pride involved; it's simply true. You
 couldn't wayfare if you were otherwise.

 The studies are as meaningless as muscles twitching before sleep, and
 you wish Rume wouldn't hang them like this. All they do is remind you
 that she doesn't understand, never will. All they remind you of are
 things you'd rather forget.

>fire

 The fireplace extends on a large, semicircular platform into the
 lodge, the wide curving hearth around it strewn with rugs and pairs of
 drying winter <span class="floydstyle em">boots</span>. The fire has been banked down to a heap
 of glowing embers, heating even this large space through the long
 night, and providing a glow bright enough to see by. A bundle of
 <span class="floydstyle em">matches</span> rests on the mantel.

>take matches

 You strike a match and light the lamp's wick from the tall yellow
 flame. Soon the lamp emits a ghost-pale light.

>boots

 Nearly dry and ready for another day breaking snowbanks.

>wear boots

 (first taking the pairs of winter boots)
 Somewhere inside you prickles a feeling. You won't need them where
 you're going.

>set boots on fire

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">I couldn't understand that, or the noun you used isn't nearby.</span>


>put boots in fire

 You need to be holding the pairs of winter boots before you can put
 them into something else.

>canvas

 The cream-white canvas is pulled taut as a drum, achingly empty.
 There's nothing magical about its fibers, of course, no strange
 alchemical mixture in your paints, no glamor in your simple
 <span class="floydstyle em">brushes</span>. You wayfare because of you: the act of painting
 simply helps your mind, your being to define the world you'll become
 part of. Each of the billion decisions you make as you paint, of
 texture, tone, pressure, position, size, helps winnow the spiraling
 infinitudes down to the single one that becomes your new reality.

 The painting itself, the one you leave behind, is merely a painting.
 But always a masterwork.

 As your fingers near canvas, the <span class="floydstyle em">Call</span> pulls strongly on your
 mind. The image you must paint burbles in your mind, almost clear.

>call

 It is an itch in the mind, a tug on your soul. It means that when next
 you wayfare, what you paint and where you go will not be entirely up
 to you. Some other wayfarer is pulling you closer. Someone in need.

 You've only felt it once before, at least consciously. When you
 answered you found a dark, razed world where a lonely little girl was
 stranded. She had a gift like your own, but didn't understand it, and
 thought she was crazy for believing in it. You stayed with her a
 month, helped her survive and learn to want survival, to gain strength
 to sing to more peaceful worlds.

 Yes, you remember now. Her gift was song, fragile with heartache, but
 the clearest, purest thing you've ever known, or ever will.

 Did she call you to her? Did some hidden part of yourself reach
 through infinities to feel her suffering? Or does some power run
 through all universes, bringing you together in times of need? You
 don't know. But now the Call has come again.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Remember, if you don't see any new keywords on screen,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">you can type LOOK or press enter</span>.

>sing

 You sing quietly, an old song you learned as a child, forgotten for
 years until surfacing now.

>brushes

 You scarcely notice them, other than as extensions of yourself.

>take brushes

 You hesitate long moments, fear and excitement trembling your
 fingertips as they hover just above your brushes. The <span class="floydstyle em">Call</span>
 whispers in your mind, teasing, wondering if you are ready to answer
 it.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Signs of hesitation often indicate you are about to do</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">something that will change or advance the story. Make sure you really</span>

 The solid front <span class="floydstyle u1">door</span> is shut tight against the frigid night

 stream to the kitchen.

>across

 You step lightly over the flat stones crossing the stream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The spacious main floor of the lodge is divided into two halves by the
 stream running through its center. This side is for practical things:
 flat countertops and spacious pine <span class="floydstyle em">cupboards</span> and a clatter of
 hanging pots, pans, and skewers. Rugged chairs at a small round

 <span class="floydstyle u1">across</span> the stream, while the staircase curves <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> to
 the balcony.

>trapdoor

 You swing the groaning old trapdoor open.

 Holding the lamp steady, you descend carefully into the frigid chill
 and dark of the cellar.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tumble Cellar</span>
 The great pillars of the lodge loom large in this cellar, a cold,
 empty space now that you and Rume have finally finished cleaning it
 out. The floor is stained and peppered with browning pine needles and
 ghosts of rotting foodstuffs left by residents long gone.

 Behind the steep stairs back <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> to the Kitchen is a bone-cold
 rock wall, on which hangs your traveling <span class="floydstyle em">clothes</span> and a
 mounted grey moose <span class="floydstyle em">head</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Careful observation and problem-solving unlocks new parts</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">of the story. Congratulations on reaching this area</span>.

>head

 Its mangy fur is not that attractive; its rack not of a size to
 impress. But on cold nights when you come down here to stare into its
 blank dead eyes, you remember what it means to you, hanging on the
 wall of your home.

 Your home.

 And in a sudden shattering you live that night again: staggering
 through the woods while the old trapper died, despite all Rume's care
 could do; confusion and doubt echoing through you at the thought that
 here, perhaps, was your chance, your one chance to give up everything
 you'd shaped your life around, and get back everything you'd given up.
 As you stared at the dying moose, its blood seeping into the snow, you
 thought you'd decided. Decided to stay.

 But the Call has hit you strong, like a current of cold electricity.
 Perhaps you never did decide. Perhaps you only put off the choice
 until another cold and lonely night. And now once again you stare into
 the eyes of the stiff grey creature and wonder.

>clothes

 Years and worlds ago you stitched these clothes, crude but now
 comfortable, broken in, one of the few familiar trappings of your
 schizophrenic life. They come with you, each time you Wayfare, because
 you made them yourself, with your own hands. And only because of that.

>cry

 You feel only the mounting dread of impending loss. The loss itself is
 not yet real.

>take head

 No. It too will remain, once you have gone.

>wear head

 (first taking the grey moose head)
 No. It too will remain, once you have gone.

>take clothes

 With hands steady on the surface but somehow trembling deep within the
 bone, you take down the old battered clothes with something like
 reverence. As you slip into them you can already feel yourself start
 to let this world go, and the Call itches more deeply, turning your
 mind to the next world you must paint, the next place to be.

>inventory

 You are wearing your traveling clothes and a wooden band, and hold an
 oil lamp (providing light) in your hand.

>examine me

 You are the one constant in your life, and even you change. You wonder
 what happened to the terrified girl who first painted her way into
 another world, the brave teenager eager for a life of adventure, the
 bitter young woman first touched by pain. Perhaps they still exist,
 somewhere in those worlds you left behind, trapped forever in amber.

>examine band
>examine band

 The symbol of commitment is always a circle. On some worlds they are
 rings, tiny bands with homes on varying fingers; elsewhere they are
 necklaces or circlets. Here they are a little different, signifying
 more strong fondness than promise, but the exchange still has meaning.
 Your band was made by Rume, carved from ashwood and polished smooth.

 The symbol of commitment is always a circle. On some worlds they are

 Your band was made by Rume, carved from ashwood and polished smooth.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tumble Cellar</span>
 The great pillars of the lodge loom large in this cellar, a cold,
 empty space now that you and Rume have finally finished cleaning it
 out. The floor is stained and peppered with browning pine needles and
 ghosts of rotting foodstuffs left by residents long gone.

 Behind the steep stairs back <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> to the Kitchen is a bone-cold
 rock wall, on which hangs a mounted grey moose <span class="floydstyle em">head</span>.

>go up

 Shivering, you climb the steps back into the kitchen, shutting the
 trapdoor behind you with a heavy groan.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The spacious main floor of the lodge is divided into two halves by the
 stream running through its center. This side is for practical things:
 flat countertops and spacious pine <span class="floydstyle em">cupboards</span> and a clatter of
 hanging pots, pans, and skewers. Rugged chairs at a small round
 <span class="floydstyle em">table</span> overlook the stream's tiny <span class="floydstyle em">pool</span>.

 A slanted <span class="floydstyle u1">trapdoor</span> leads to the cellar, opposite the path
 <span class="floydstyle u1">across</span> the stream, while the staircase curves <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> to
 the balcony.

>sit

 You sit for a moment at the old table, but your mind races. Visions
 and images dance inside you, and you know the moment you touch brush
 to canvas they will crystallize, coalesce into the scene you must
 paint-- the world you are Called to.

 Restlessness drives you to your feet again.

>across

 You step lightly over the flat stones crossing the stream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Studio</span>
 Your art has claimed this side of the main floor; paint-spattered
 canvas twists crumpled underfoot, palettes and buckets and brushes
 stacked and strewn between them. Abstract <span class="floydstyle em">studies</span> lie in
 piles where you've abandoned them, except a few Rume has saved and
 pinned to the wall. The <span class="floydstyle em">fire</span> burns low, painting the interior
 of the lodge with dull heat and molten glow.

 A wide blank <span class="floydstyle em">canvas</span> stands on an easel in the center of the
 studio, space cleared around it like the eye of a storm.

 The solid front <span class="floydstyle u1">door</span> is shut tight against the frigid night
 air. Opposite the fire, a few flat stones lead <span class="floydstyle u1">across</span> the
 stream to the kitchen.

>door

 You swing the heavy oaken door open, pulling swirls of ice-cold air
 with it, and step out for a moment onto the small porch.

 The smell of pines and indistinct snowdrifts peppered with cones and
 needles surround you. Above the piercing clarity of the stars shine in
 a cloudless sky. You stare up at them, lungs shivering in the
 knife-cold air, your companions through this lifelong sojourn of
 worlds. Not specific stars, not the changing constellations from world
 to world, but the stars as a whole, ever-present, fused through your
 life into one metacosmic night sky.

 But you're not dressed for cold. Leaving breath crystals quivering in
 the air, you retreat back into warmth and shut the door.

>poker

 You see nothing special about the brass poker.

>fire

 The fireplace extends on a large, semicircular platform into the
 lodge, the wide curving hearth around it strewn with rugs and pairs of
 drying winter <span class="floydstyle em">boots</span>. The fire has been banked down to a heap
 of glowing embers, heating even this large space through the long
 night, and providing a glow bright enough to see by. A bundle of
 <span class="floydstyle em">matches</span> rests on the mantel.

>rugs

 Soft and warm.

>paint

 Awkwardly, you set the oil lamp on a shelf and struggle to build up
 the fire, finally producing a blaze that floods the room with heat and
 light. That done, you fumble for palette and brushes, knocking your
 shins on the easel. The smell of Rume still lingers in the air, clings
 invisibly to your body, as if your earlier choice of love now thwarts
 your fingers and intentions with delicate jealousy. A hesitancy seems
 to cloud your mind; though the Call seems inevitable, some sage part
 of you knows it is not, that you could abandon it and go back to bed
 and live out a happy life here in the mountains. You pause for a long
 moment before the blank canvas, brush in hand, a droplet of thick
 lemon-yellow quivering at the tips of bristles. Then, with a sigh, you
 press the brush against the cloth.

 There is none of the deliberate experimentation, the careful decisions
 that come with your usual work: this time, the scene already exists in
 your mind's eye, formed by the Call. All you have to do is make it
 real.

 There is no sense of time, but hours must pass.

 By the time you force yourself to step back for a moment, to pull away
 from the <span class="floydstyle em">painting</span>, the intensity of the world you are already
 half a part of, you are almost finished. You can't leave Rume like
 this; there must be explanations, and pain, and goodbyes. But as you
 turn to head up the stairs you see <span class="floydstyle em">Rume</span> already stands on the
 landing above, smoking and watching you silently.

 And you know at a glance she understands. She cannot come with you.

>love rume
 Topics: people, easy, stealing, and wayfarer
 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span> or <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>.


 Wrapped in light cloth despite the lingering chill, Rume regards you
 steadily with no hint of sleepiness. Pale blue smoke rises from her
 sikar, nearly smoked down.

 Rume examines you in return, thoughtful, her expression unreadable.
 "No goodbyes from a <span class="floydstyle u2">wayfarer</span>, then," she says in a quiet
 voice that hangs heavy nonetheless among the wooden rafters, seeping
 only reluctantly to the level of your ears. "No scenes, no protests.
 Yes, I understand. The way of your <span class="floydstyle u2">people</span>, I imagine; a quiet
 departure in dim night, <span class="floydstyle u2">stealing</span> away to new dawns in new
 worlds, fresh and unspoiled."

 She lowers one hand to the railing and grips it calmly, but her
 knuckles are white. "An <span class="floydstyle u2">easy</span> road," she adds, "for the woman
 I thought you were."

 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span> or <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>.

 "Yes," Rume says musingly, taking another savage pull at the sikar,
 "you've told me before. The Call. Such a romantic, fantastic notion. A
 beacon that pulls your <span class="floydstyle u2">people</span> across worlds, across
 universes. In times of need," she adds reflectively, staring into the
 empty space in the empty center of the lodge, lost.

 "But why do you answer it?" she says suddenly, bluntly. "This Call.
 There are those in this world who <span class="floydstyle u2">need</span> you as much. Why? Some
 sense of <span class="floydstyle u2">duty</span>? The promise of <span class="floydstyle u2">adventure</span>? Or are you

>duty

 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span> or <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>.

 Rume studies you for a long moment.

 "Yes," she says finally, taking a deep breath, "in a life like yours,
 the only allegiance a sane woman could have is to herself, and others
 like her." She nods once, slowly. "For those around you are mere
 shadows, destined always to fade away, never to stay, never to be
 woven into the fabric of your life. Only brushed at intervals from the
 threads."

 She considers her next words carefully, forming them in her head the
 way you've seen her do so many times before, before finally speaking.

 "Tell me, wayfarer," she says. "Do you care for me?"

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: Old keywords disappear as the conversation moves on. Keep</span>

>yes
 Topics: wait
 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span> or <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>.

 For a long moment you stare at each other, until Rume breaks the gaze
 to stare searchingly into the sloping skylights, still black with
 night, and you know she is thinking, searching for some way she can
 come with you.

 And you know there is none. Only a Wayfarer wayfares. Only the things
 she has created and touches go with her. And there is no going back.

 You've told her before, and she hasn't forgotten. And at last she
 nods, to herself, and pauses for a moment, as if gathering the right
 words to go on.

>wait


 Time passes.

 Quickly she tosses something down to you. In midair you realize what,
 and a weight seems to fall on you so that when you catch it, you're
 surprised it's so light.

 "You say only what you've made with your own hands and touch goes with
 you when you go," she breathes. "So I give you the <span class="floydstyle em">bracelet</span>
 you made for me. If you would truly leave me forever, then wear it, to
 remember me by."

 She steps forward, gripping the railing tightly. "But there is another
 way. I cannot go, but you do not have to. Stay. Ignore the Call. If
 you keep moving on, running away from roots and foundations, this
 wayfaring will strip all meaning from your life and leave you a cold
 and lonely shadow. And I do not want that for you."

 "Come <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> and return the bracelet to me, if you choose to
 stay," Rume says, "or <span class="floydstyle u1">wear</span> it and paint, if you choose to go.
 Or <span class="floydstyle u1">burn</span> it, I suppose, if you wish for all trace of me to
 vanish. Choose. I will wait."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Studio</span>
 Your art has claimed this side of the main floor; paint-spattered
 canvas twists crumpled underfoot, palettes and buckets and brushes
 stacked and strewn between them. Abstract <span class="floydstyle em">studies</span> lie in

 pinned to the wall. The <span class="floydstyle em">fire</span> rages, flooding the room with
 yellow-orange light, driving away the chill.

 Your <span class="floydstyle em">painting</span> of a strange, withered tree is almost complete,
 almost real.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Rume</span> stands on the balcony above, smoking and watching you
 quietly.

 The solid front <span class="floydstyle u1">door</span> is shut tight against the frigid night
 air. Opposite the fire, a few flat stones lead <span class="floydstyle u1">across</span> the
 stream to the kitchen.

>go up

 You move to the stairs, but Rume pauses, breathing deeply. "Wait," she
 says, "think. Know what you give up for me. Believe it in yourself.
 Tell it to your soul. Then, if that truly is your decision..." She
 trembles, whispering. "Then yes, come <span class="floydstyle u2">up</span> to me, and let us
 start our life together at last."

>go up

 The vastness of the distance up the stairs seems enormous, each step
 requiring herculean effort. But they get easier. Each time you lift
 your foot,  some force within you rips, snaps open, like seed pods
 bursting at the first breath of spring, or signal flares igniting,
 light to show the way through storms.

 You take the last few steps in a single bound and fall upwards into
 Rume's arms, floodgates of something you've never felt bursting forth
 inside you. You hold each other for long minutes, almost too tight to
 breathe, till finally you slip the bracelet back on her wrist.

 She kisses you deeply, then pulls you back into the loft. There are
 still hours to morning, when your life will finally, finally begin.



 *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *

 And time seems to speed up, flowing faster and faster till the leaves
 and foam that once drifted by becomes a blur and blue

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ice Shelf Near Home</span>
 ice, you call to Rume, but she knows that, knows to stay on the blue
 ice, but the mammoth skeleton gleams within the glacier and she's
 almost there and suddenly the shelf gives way beneath her and she's
 falling, skidding down the slope and you trip after her snowshoes
 catching and heart thumping and finally reach her side

>topics


 but Rume doesn't hear you over her laughter, whooping and scraping the
 snow from her face and saying it's okay, it's okay, I'm fine, and you
 feel such an intense rush of gratefulness and love and kiss her
 between her eyes, so beautiful and blue

 blue

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside The Tumble</span>
 eyes, like Rume's, her adopted mother, and you can see how scared she
 is but hungry at last to finally have a home, holding the two of your
 hands tight, little Archana, as the pompous official from town out of
 breath from the bumpy sleigh ride up signs paperwork, and the girl
 trembles nervously

>blue


 and she looks up at you bravely, holding your hand tight, and you look
 up into Rume's eyes and reflected there is your joy and terror and
 trepidation and concern at this new frontier of parenthood, reflected
 in the blue

 blue

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Tumble, Archana's Room</span>
 of the sky fades in the darkling window as night breezes rustle while
 Archana listens with wide eyes to Rume's bedtime story, tucked in bed
 under warm furs, and you watch and listen fondly at the way your love
 weaves the words, her voice dancing and lilting through the old tale

>laugh


 but no, you'll stay, stay and hear the end of the story, and Rume
 tells and the story lives in the spaces between you three and you're
 content, at peace here in your home in the blue

 blue

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Cellar</span>
 in the painting, covered in a faint layer of dust now but still
 potent, powerful, and you wonder why you never destroyed it and you
 wonder why you keep coming down here and pulling back the dusty burlap
 and staring at it, and Rume comes down the stairs behind you while
 Archana recites above and Rume closes the cellar door and puts her
 arms around you, the wooden bracelet hard against your stomach, and
 stares at the painting with you and she asks if you still hear the
 Call

>do


 and there is a long silence before Rume hugs you silently, and you
 feel her tears seep into the back of your shirt, and you wish you
 could destroy the painting but you can't, it would be like burning a
 part of yourself, and Rume asks you to come back upstairs and help
 Archana with her poem and you roll the burlap back over the canvas and
 the last color you see is a shade of blue

 blue

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Bedroom</span>
 eyes flash as she screams at you in fury, each of Rume's words
 hammering into the ache in your head like nails, each argument rising
 to the surface and being sucked under again by momentum, like jetsam
 in a river eddy, again and again, and finally you can't take any more

>leave


 but she yells after you telling you to come back this isn't finished
 but you keep walking down the stairs anyway, the stream barely audible
 over her voice, and you wonder if this is what you stayed for, if you
 gave up your greatest gift for this, for the tears in Rume's blue

 blue

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">At Dinner Around The Fire</span>
 -green leaves from the garden and Rume's buttered red potatoes and
 Archana's fresh meat, and she boasts to the grizzled trapper about the
 kill again and again, reliving the details of the flushing and the
 flintlock and the thrill of victory, her first successful hunt, and
 you take your first bite of the smoked meat

>bitter


 but you keep chewing and smiling because this is Archana's moment and
 you see the trapper's eyes go wide as he chews his first bite through
 his beard but he does the same and across the table you catch Rume's
 glance and the two of you share a secret smile, her eyes absorbing the
 crackling fire but still the same blue

 blue

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Garden</span>
 eyes blaze as she tells your child she's absolutely forbidden, but
 Archana, almost a woman now, kicks over a corn stalk savagely and
 shouts that you don't understand what it's like living up here alone,
 you're a couple of rooted hermits, you've forgot what adventure even
 is, and Rume flushes

>wayfarer


 and you don't know what to say, and Archana turns and angrily stalks
 off into the forest, and you look at Rume, her face more deeply lined
 than it seemed even this morning, but her eyes only deepening with age
 into richer and richer shades of blue

 blue

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Bedroom</span>
 shadows between the pine boughs that Rume still hangs from the rafters
 through twenty winters now, the old loft room now filled with
 treasures and mementos and the scuffs and scratches and sweat of a
 lifetime, and the wind beats against the old timbers of the house
 where the two of you have spent this past quiet year, alone again, and
 you remember the night like this those dim and distant years ago when
 you chose between love and art and chose love

>right


 because losing Rume even then would have scarred you for the rest of
 your life and Rume sleeps beside you and in a flash you remember that
 this is your last night here, your last night before you finally
 answered the Call and left Rume here alone and suddenly her eyes fly
 open and she looks at you desperately and you try to hold on to the
 look in those eyes, those beautiful blue

 *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *



 ...but you shake your head. It was just a dream. You're still here
 today, and Rume is still at the Tumble, and if you don't make this
 shot you're going to be eating more of last year's freezer-burned
 venison again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Vale</span>
 The trees crowd thick here in this vale that has always been good
 hunting grounds, nestled between two rocky slopes.

 The path back <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to home is behind you.

 Before you, in a clearing, a large <span class="floydstyle em">hare</span> grazes unconcernedly
 on tufts of summer grass. You raise the worn flintlock pistol to your
 shoulder carefully.

>hare

 You'd hoped to see deer this morning, but they seem later than usual
 in returning to the vale this year. The hare will only provide one
 good meal, but anything is better than unthawing more greying venison
 from last season.

>shoot hare

 With a deafening explosion, the pistol fires, a good, clean shot. The
 hare starts, then falls, as you knew it would.

 You approach the animal, but it seems your shot is clean. It lies
 dead, blood spilling over the grass in steamy curtains, merging with
 the morning dew.

 Something about the <span class="floydstyle em">blood</span> reminds you of something.

>lick blood

 <span class="floydstyle i">Apologies, but that isn't  something the story expected you to try</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">eating</span>.

>blood

 The sky was blood-red when you left this morning before sunrise,
 vanishing storm clouds drinking in the dawn light. Rume was standing
 at the doorway as you left, staring into the east. She murmured
 something quietly, and you thought she said "Who'd have believed we
 could stay so long in one place."

 You were so bleary-eyed you were not quite sure you hadn't imagined
 her saying it-- sounded more like something you'd say, anyway-- but
 now that the walk through the brisk morning air and the hunt has
 wakened you, you're sure she did say it. Strange. She has been so
 <span class="floydstyle em">strange</span> lately.

>strange

 Winter was lonely and cold this year, your first without Archana, and
 Rume has seemed quieter and more withdrawn than you've seen her in
 years. She spent hours poring over old maps, tracing fingers through
 the lines of distant mountain ridges and rubbing circles through the
 white blank spaces of unexplored territory.

 When spring finally came, she threw herself into spring cleaning,
 scrubbing floors and washing away the grime as if trying to make the
 old Tumble look like new. You helped in kind, of course, but were
 never sure what you both were preparing for, what strange visitor
 would be arriving that you hoped to impress.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Vale</span>
 The trees crowd thick here in this vale that has always been good

 The path back <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to home is behind you.

 The <span class="floydstyle em">hare</span> you shot is here.

>hare

 When cleaned and dressed, it will make a nice supper.

>go down

 You walk down through the strangely quiet vale in the midmorning
 light.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Giant's Table</span>
 Three narrow canyons meet at this huge flat moss-covered rock.
 Memories of dozens of picnics drift through the quiet pines
 surrounding the Table, Archana's ghost laughter mingling with the
 tinkling of the stream that leads you home.

 The stream trickles <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> the valley.

 A strange feeling twists within you, as if something is wrong. But
 everything seems normal. You have walked this valley thousands of
 times, and nothing is out of place. But still the feeling persists.

>go down

 You follow the familiar stream down through steep terraces, following
 the worn path through the greening pines.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Archana's Dam</span>
 The stream pools into a narrow, deep swimming hole here, an old
 project of your daughter's that has held up to the elements far longer
 than her parents ever thought it would. A few wildflowers poke their
 way out of the new spring grass in the adjacent meadow.

 The stream continues <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> towards home.

 The feeling of wrongness grows within you, almost a panic, though you
 still cannot explain why. But then, suddenly, you can. You should see
 the smoke rising from the Tumble from here, a familiar beacon. But you
 don't. There is no smoke. The fire is out.

>go down

 You hurry down the slope, over lichen-encrusted boulders and
 mouldering pine needles.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Tumble</span>
 The wooden beams of home rise above you, aging but scrubbed clean,
 firewood stacked in a neat pile under the eaves and the little bridge
 over the stream neatly swept. But there is no smoke rising from the
 rock chimney, no smell of breakfast or sound of Rume singing, and the
 door is shut tight, rather than open to admit the spring air.

 Part of you dreads to open that door, but there is nowhere to go but
 <span class="floydstyle u1">inside</span>.

>inside

 You push the door open and stop dead in your tracks, heartbeat
 suddenly loud in your ears.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tumble, Main Floor</span>
 It's been a long time since you thought of this room as a studio, but
 suddenly you remember it as it was that night all those years ago. The
 fireplace is neatly banked now, ashes scrubbed away, and Archana's
 pine animals hang from the ceiling instead of the bare rafters. But
 one thing is the same.

 In the center of the room, alone on its easel, your <span class="floydstyle em">painting</span>
 waits,  again.

>painting

 Its immediacy tingles your pores with cold pinpricks. The morning
 light streams through the door and seeps into the colors, expands them
 with vibrant life. But the painting is wrong now. The tree you painted
 twenty years ago has grown, not on your canvas but on the world it
 exists, and you see, almost feel it with sudden shocking clarity:
 branches thickened, new leaves sprouted; the hillside behind has
 become more overgrown; the wisps of clouds in the sky of your canvas
 are from a different season than the one that now breathes through the
 lemon-yellow leaves. You know this all in a sudden shock of gnosis,
 like an unexpected wave smacking and submerging you. And your
 fingertips tingle and long to make the tree right. To make it real
 again.

 Slowly your peripheral vision returns and you take in the rest of the
 scene, and all that is different. Rume's boots and winter clothes are
 gone. The fireplace is banked, ashes neatly swept away. And on the
 table is a folded <span class="floydstyle em">letter</span>, and a <span class="floydstyle em">bracelet</span>.

>bracelt

 (retrying as if you'd typed "bracelet.")

 Carved from a dark, solid wood, the bracelet was your gift to Rume
 long ago, the twin of the wooden <span class="floydstyle em">band</span> she gave to you.

>band

 The symbol of commitment is always a circle. On some worlds they are
 rings, tiny bands with homes on varying fingers; elsewhere they are
 necklaces or circlets. Here they are a little different, signifying
 more strong fondness than promise, but the exchange still has meaning.
 Your band was made by Rume, carved from ashwood and polished smooth.
 She wears the one you made for her.

>letter

 You open it and read, numb.

 "A dozen glaciers creep through our mountains," it begins, "a hundred
 passes lead to alpine paths growing less and less familiar each hour.
 In four days, my love, I will be in unexplored, uncharted territory.
 Once again.

 "I did not have the courage to say goodbye to you. Nor did you have
 the courage to do the same for me, when first you heard the Call and
 started this painting. It is not because we are cowards, I think. It
 is because we know how easy the temptation to follow in contentment
 would be. But we are not followers. We are not owners of each other,
 nor can we change who we are. We are explorers, and we must explore.
 This is hard, and true.

 "But exploring takes us to unexpected places.

 "You have said yourself, my love, that there are no rules for your
 kind. What you know you know by experiment and chance. Perhaps-- no,
 certainly-- you do not know everything. There may be more left to
 explore in yourself.

 "Though you think it impossible, perhaps one day you can find your way
 back to me.

 "Go. Wayfare. Explore. And if you find some way to return-- find me. I
 will be high in mountains, or crossing distant seas, somewhere under
 stars. When we meet again we both will be changed, and ready to
 explore each other anew.

 "Rume."

 Rume's boots and winter clothes are gone. The fireplace is banked,
 ashes neatly swept away. And on the table is a folded <span class="floydstyle em">letter</span>,
 and a <span class="floydstyle em">bracelet</span>.

>paint

 There's no reason to wait. You've nothing to pack, no one to say
 goodbye to, nothing to arrange. You approach the canvas hesitantly.
 For long moments you stand there, arranging and rearranging your
 paints, afraid perhaps to begin. But inevitably, you do.

 The paints are supple and clear as ever. You thicken branches,
 reposition leaves, change the patterns in the sky-- all to make it
 right again, to make it real. When it's almost finished, and you step
 back to say your final goodbyes to this world. Only a touch more
 <span class="floydstyle u1">paint</span> and it will be complete.

>paint

 You trace a final line on your canvas, and you are somewhere else.

 It's smaller than you expected, the tree. But the wrinkled grey-white
 trunk, the sinuous branches with their gaping holes, are just what you
 painted, details between the bristles, between the molecules of paint,
 brought from neural twitchings to physical reality, again.

 Turning your head, you take your first breath in this world.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>
 Smells of damp earth and a profusion of greenery encircle this
 half-clearing amidst light forest. Trees encrusted with moss rise from
 a carpet of grassy, leaf-strewn earth, along with tall stands of
 bamboo and explosions of delicate fronds.

 The clearing is dominated by the <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span> you painted,
 vine-wrapped trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves
 springing from sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined
 <span class="floydstyle em">nook</span> curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting what looks like a
 <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> through the trees with the deeper <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

>tree

 It certainly is a curious tree. Spirals of <span class="floydstyle em">vine</span> sprout from
 the gnarled trunk and wrap tightly around it before spreading out to
 knobby branches beginning just above your head. The branches bifurcate
 until they end in tiny, bare pointed twigs. As the vines spiral around
 them they sprout hundreds of small lemon-yellow <span class="floydstyle em">leaves</span>. Even
 more curious is that dozens of <span class="floydstyle em">holes</span> seem to have organically
 grown through the branches, as if they split and reconnected to
 themselves as the tree was growing; these also continue all the way
 out to the tiny twigs, shrinking in size as they go.

 The tree is nothing like the surrounding vegetation, and seems stunted
 somehow-- though you can't say what creates that impression, with
 nothing to compare it to.

>holes

 They range in size from knobby round gaps nearly as big as your head,
 in crooks and splits near the trunk, to tiny pinholes trailing along
 the ends of the smallest branches, and run all the way through the
 wood, letting you see through to the other side.

>vine

 The vines sprout from orifices about the size of your wrist spread out
 all over the trunk of the tree, and wrap tightly around it in a helix
 spiraling up, splitting and shrinking in diameter, until each one
 leaves the trunk to twine out around a branch, sprouting hundreds of
 small lemon-yellow <span class="floydstyle em">leaves</span>.

>pull vine

 The vines spring from the trunk and are tightly wrapped around it and
 the branches. They seem to be attached to the tree by thousands of
 tiny hook-like hairs.

>leaves

 Each flower or leaf is about the size of your thumbnail, perfectly
 circular, slightly concave, and the color of a deep, almost
 fluorescent lemon yellow. Subtle veins run through the
 semi-translucent skin. They sprout from the vines wrapped around the
 branches, each about a finger width apart.

>climb

 What do you want to climb?

>climb vine

 Finding a spot of bare grayish bark between the spiraling vines, you
 touch the tree. The trunk seems warm to the touch, and your fingers
 feel something else: a miniscule vibration? The faint buzz of an
 electric current? You draw your hand back and rub it curiously.

 The vines and gnarled branches make it an easy climb. The tree is not
 too high, and before long you are standing at a crook in the trunk
 where it finally splits. Yellow flowers surround you. You can see that
 the tree stands on a great forested slope, stretching up to the summit
 of a volcano and down to a white sand crescent beach.

 After enjoying the view for a while, you climb back down to solid
 ground again.

>nook

 It looks like a soft place to curl up in for a nap.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>
 Smells of damp earth and a profusion of greenery encircle this
 half-clearing amidst light forest. Trees encrusted with moss rise from
 a carpet of grassy, leaf-strewn earth, along with tall stands of
 bamboo and explosions of delicate fronds.

 The clearing is dominated by the withered <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, vine-wrapped
 trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves springing from
 sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined <span class="floydstyle em">nook</span>
 curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting what looks like a
 <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> through the trees with the deeper <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

>beach

 You follow the overgrown path down a slight slope towards a bright
 open area, picking your way over fallen trees and slippery earth, and
 finally emerge from the trees on some grassy mounds at the edge of a
 beach.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Stretching out before you is a breathtaking white sand <span class="floydstyle em">lagoon</span>
 framed by a cliff of jet-black lava, the glimmering beach forming a
 languid half-moon curve around a shallow bay of deep, rich blue. The
 smell of the sea breeze on your face makes you pause for a moment;
 it's been a long time since you've seen ocean.

 The beach curves gently around the lagoon, stretching towards the
 distant rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, while disappearing closer at hand into a
 stand of rounded <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. You could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span>
 into the lagoon, or follow a faint path back <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> into dense
 vegetation.

 Off towards the <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>, you can see a <span class="floydstyle em">figure</span>
 dressed in rags standing atop them and facing the ocean, shouting and
 gesticulating wildly.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Tutorial: You can use exit keywords to approach distant people, or</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">the APPROACH verb to move one area closer to them</span>.

>figure

 The figure stands atop one of the rounded boulders and shouts at the
 surf.

 The <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> in the distance is still shouting and gesticulating
 from the top of the boulder.

>approach man

 You amble across the sand into rockier terrain.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Boulders</span>
 Large mottled boulders rise from the sand here at the end of the
 beach, rubbed smooth by eons of tides and wind, green lichens
 clutching their sides. Across the bay, a rocky volcanic rise sticks
 out into the ocean, forming the lagoon's far boundary; this end is
 framed by a rocky point beyond the boulders.

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,
 wetted by the spray of the surf.

 Sandy paths wander towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the beach
 opens up back towards the edge of the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>. The tide
 crashes against a bank of low smooth stones running into the ocean.

 A strange little <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> stands atop the largest of the boulders,
 dressed in a patchwork costume of ragged and threadbare clothes. He
 faces the ocean and vigorously shouts at it.

 "<span class="floydstyle u2">Concordance</span>! Summation! Integration!" he shouts, staring
 furiously at the waves. "Deliverance! Reticence! Abolition!"

>mussels

 A bit longer and wider than a fat thumb, they are a deep forest green
 cut through with striated arcs of lighter shades. Fragments of the
 shells of their ancestors tumble in the surf, diminishing to gritty
 green whorls.

 "<span class="floydstyle u2">Proposition</span>! Elucidation!" he shouts. "Deterrence!" He
 thinks for a moment, seemingly stumped, then his face lights up and he
 shouts "Obsequious!"

 "Torque. Serendipity, ahhhh."

 He glances at you in annoyance. "What, you're <span class="floydstyle u2">ruining</span> it!" he
 hisses, as if trying to prevent something out in the ocean from
 hearing. "Can't <span class="floydstyle u2">concentrate</span> if you're going to pratter on
 like that. Go away!"

 He scrunches his face up, then belts out a string of words as quick as
 he can shout them: "<span class="floydstyle u2">Singularity</span>- Perpetuity- Mendacity-
 Parasitic- Gregarious- Intolerance!" He beams proudly.

 He's up too high for you to reach him.

 Satisfied, he finally turns to you with a smile. "Thank you much for
 waiting," he says, "I so do hate my <span class="floydstyle u2">word</span> Days interrupted."
 And then with a surprising little flip, he leaps off the top of the
 boulder to come crashing down in the sand at your feet. Before you can
 even think to start moving forward to see if he is all right, he is on
 his feet and standing just a pace before you.

 He pokes you on the forehead. "I know your game," he says
 disapprovingly. "Been expecting you for quite a <span class="floydstyle u2">time</span>, really.
 I'm two-thirds mad you see, at least; have been for green eons, and
 it's often I wonder when the other third would show up and so here you
 are."

 He folds his arms skeptically. "So what do we do, then, eh? Flashbacks
 to every dark corner of my past failings? Hauntings, waking
 nightmares? You're my first <span class="floydstyle u2">hallucination</span>, so I'm unclear,
 unsure as to the procedures and protocols." He regards you with wary
 eyes.

 "Ah yes, Word Day!" he says, spreading his arms wide and spinning in a
 dizzy circle. "I try and have one semiannually or demiweekly or
 hemicalendrically, whichever of those it is that usually comes first.
 The point is, you see, to prove to the ocean that I still remember
 everything I used to."

 He puts an arm around your shoulder conspiratorially and throws a
 guarded glance at the waves. "It's a bluff, though," he whispers
 loudly. "The vocabulary's doing fine, but mostly usually everything
 else has slipped away. Don't really remember who I am or where I got
 here or how I came from. But don't tell."

 He cuts you off in annoyance. "I'll do the asking, thank you," he
 says, "you just deal the answering for now."

 "Ratherly strange," he says, walking in a circle around you studying
 you carefully. "I assumed that you'd take the guise of some Figure
 From The Past, some One, if you ring, terrible important in my life,
 meaningful, lesson-worthy, all that." He frowns, tilting his head to
 one side. "Then again, mayhaps you have. Can't remember much about my
 past. Mostly usually nothing at all, to be perfect honest. You could
 be my own daughter for all I know." His eyes narrows. "Are you?"

 He shrugs. "Ah well-oh. Makes this less awkward then I suppose. Would
 have been interesting, though."

 Before you can quite figure out a response, he abruptly steps back and
 gives you an appraising glare, lifting a long and firm finger. "Now
 look now," he says, "I hope you don't expect my schedule, my routines,
 to dive in lakes just cause some shabby-dressed spook has popped by. I
 may be two-thirds mad but I have things, essential things that must
 and must be done around here, and I don't want visions or phantoms or
 strange afterimages from the Blue Flash interfering. This is my

 in agreement then on that then?"

>yes

 "Good good," he grunts, stepping up closer. "And I ratherly hope you

 more one of the cheerful sort. Do you think mayhaps we can make the
 best of this awkwardness and be friendly whilst you're about?"

>yes


 "There, then," he says, nodding happily at you, "mayhaps this won't be
 so unpleasant after all."

 "I'll be about and aroundabout," he says, eyeing you appraisingly, "so
 whistle or shout or something thatwise if you need." He pauses for a
 moment, shaking his head. "Sausages, I'm telling my visions how to
 find me. Mad as a mackdaw." He gives you one last incredulous stare,
 then turns and slips away with surprising speed, weaving between the
 rounded boulders towards the beach.

 Just before getting out of sight, he turns. "Oh!" he shouts back to
 you. "Welcome welcome I suppose and all that. To the island!" He
 turns, disappearing behind the boulders, but his voice carries back:
 "To my Lacuna!"

>towards

 You walk down towards the breakers on dampening sand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Beach</span>
 The tide breaks at your feet, sending warm runners of foam splashing
 around your ankles. The sand is smooth and damp, sprinkled with a
 profusion of shells, small stones, and clumps of seaweed.

 A huge and beautiful <span class="floydstyle em">sculpture</span> of a manta ray, carved from
 some clear crystal, sits on a track running into the waves.

 You can hike back up the beach in one of several directions: towards
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, towards the log <span class="floydstyle u1">cabin</span>, or towards
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> near the path. You could also wade out into the
 ocean <span class="floydstyle u1">waters</span>.

>sculpture

 The sculpture is stunningly beautiful, capturing every curve of the
 graceful manta creature's flattened form. The clear crystal shimmers
 in the sun, and peering closer you can see that the sculpture is
 actually hollow. A <span class="floydstyle em">hatchway</span> on the top provides access to the
 interior.

>hatchway

 A round wheel on top opens the hatchway, which looks airtight.

>open hatchway

 You turn a wooden wheel on the hatchway, pull it open with a wet
 sucking noise, and clamber inside. The interior is just tall enough
 that you can sit up without bumping your head. As you sit, however,
 the hatchway clangs shut behind you, releasing a hidden catch; and the
 manta sculpture glides forward down the track, cuts through the
 breaking waves effortlessly, and descends into a beautiful undersea
 paradise.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Manta, Under the Waves</span>
 Surrounding you on all sides is a fantastic underwater vista. Brightly
 colored <span class="floydstyle em">fish</span> twirl and dart among coral reefs and gently
 waving plants of red and green. Sunlight filters heavily through the
 waves and the transparent crystal of the sculpture; the facets are so
 expertly carved you hardly notice it's there.

 The hatchway above leads <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>, though you probably don't
 want to use it while you're underwater. A large wooden <span class="floydstyle em">wheel</span>
 on the floor seems to interface with the track on the ocean floor,
 which ends beneath you.

 A larger wave surges by above your head, sending whorls of surf
 bubbles spiraling down towards you.

>wheel

 The wheel lies flat against the crystal floor of the manta, through
 which you can dimly see some gears and the track below. It looks like
 by gripping the handle you could make a wide stirring motion to turn
 the wheel.

>turn wheel

 Gripping the handle, you begin turning the wheel. The gears below you
 spin, and you feel the manta slowly pulling back up the track.

 It takes a few minutes, but you slowly emerge from the waves until
 you're resting on the lower beach again, and climb out of the
 sculpture.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Beach</span>

 ocean <span class="floydstyle u1">waters</span>.

>cabin

 (new <span class="floydstyle u1">landmark</span> discovered)
 You hike up the drying beach, enjoying the faint breeze you generate
 as you move through the still midday air, leaving the soft crash of
 the surf far behind.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Log Cabin</span>
 The beach widens here in the middle of its sweeping curve around the
 lagoon, rising in graceful white dunes to the sudden black slope of
 the old lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span>. Up against the flow is built a log
 <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span>, looking long-neglected but still intact. Gleaming
 white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> almost blinds you as it stretches in a great arc
 around the lagoon.

 The beach stretches away towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span> or
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also head back <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to
 where the waves are breaking. The cabin lies <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

>go up

 You clamber up the slipping sand past seaweed and shells at the
 high-water mark, then onto sturdier ground, before finally arriving at
 the building. First peering cautiously through the doorway, you step
 inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 Sand drifts around the open doorway, spilling out in tiny dunes across
 the wooden floorboards, undisturbed. Bare, water-stained walls frame a
 small room, empty and abandoned save for a manta ray <span class="floydstyle em">skeleton</span>
 hanging from one wall; some frayed ropes tied to one beam are the only
 other hint of past furnishings.

 The room's sole other feature is a wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span> discarded in a
 corner.

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to a bright <span class="floydstyle u1">porch</span> or to a
 darker <span class="floydstyle u1">interior</span>. You can also step back <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>skeleton

 The skeleton, mounted on the wall, makes a large diamond, and must
 have once belonged to some flat, manta ray creature with rare
 elegance. Now, bleached and dusty, it only seems to add to the
 loneliness and neglect of the cabin.

>box

 You blow sand and dust off as you kneel to examine it, brushing years
 of neglect from its detailed surface. The box is a perfect cube, each
 side about the length of your forearm, carved from interlocking pieces
 of wood which fit together seamlessly without nails or mismatched
 joins. Intricate <span class="floydstyle em">carvings</span> cover every surface. Salt crusts
 the lower third, where the wood is swollen and discolored.

>lick salt

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">I couldn't understand that, or the noun you used isn't nearby.</span>


>carvings

 The carvings, impossibly tiny, make up one immense, tropical scene.
 Splashing dolphins segue seamlessly into beaches littered with shells,
 tall, graceful palm trees, laughing children, and fanciful animals.
 You could study these carvings for hours without taking in all the
 detail.

 Along the top of the cube, worked into the design, are five oval
 <span class="floydstyle em">indentations</span>.

>indentations

 Four are clustered together in an arc, the fifth farther apart.

>put fingers in indentations

 You slip your fingers into the indentations along the top and push
 with your other hand. The top rotates open easily, revealing a
 delicate <span class="floydstyle em">sketchbook</span>.

>sketchbook

 You examine the sketchbook carefully, a beautiful handmade thing,
 thick paper pressed from some creamy-tan wood, the spiral binding a
 thin coil of copper-colored metal. On the cover is a handwritten
 <span class="floydstyle em">inscription</span>.

 You open the sketchbook and study the first page.

 The first drawing shows a stunning portrait study of two girls, maybe
 ten or eleven. Long black hair frames unsmiling but beautiful faces,
 trapped between the carefree whimsy of childhood and some premature
 pain that strips it away. At first you take them for twins, though
 subtle differences of appearance suggest otherwise, because of their
 nearly identical expressions. Though they look out at you and not each
 other, some bond strong even for sisters connects them, forged perhaps
 in loss and strengthened by necessity of reliance, each upon the
 other.

 It looks like you could see more if you turn the page.

>inscription

 The message is written in strange letters that you don't understand.

              ' .---- ---- ---- ----
     --- -- ----- --- ---  ,--- ----
    ---- ---- ---- -- ----- --- ---'

>turn page

 You turn the page.

 A landscape fills the next page, showing the beach outside and the
 half-constructed cabin against the lava flow. The two girls play in
 the sand, one building a sand castle while a skittering crab watches,
 the other brushing her hair with a comb carved to look like two
 leaping dolphins. Behind them a tall figure chops branches from a
 felled tree trunk. While the beach and the girls are sharp and finely
 detailed, the figure is fuzzy and dark, indistinct, drawn with heavy,
 crude lines. Though just a small part of the scene, his presence
 throws the rest of the sketch into some sadder, unsettling mood.

 It looks like you could see more if you turn the page.

 You turn the page.

 This page shows a rough map of the island. The half-circle of the
 lagoon on the west side, its north end bounded by the rocky lava flow
 that swoops up to the volcano in the south, are easily recognizable.
 The chasm running from the break in the volcano's side to the north
 end of the beach is marked with a danger sign and six tiny colored
 lines. A plateau filled with dense rain forest fills the island's east
 side, interrupted by a ravine that divides it from the looming
 mountain in the northeast.

 A furious scribbled star marks a point deep within the eastern rain
 forest, with a crude drawing of a bee alongside it.

 Angry scribbles nearly obliterate the next sketch, which shows, in
 incredible detail, one of the strange twisted trees, every twist of
 encircling vines and gap in its sinuous branches carefully rendered.
 The dark and crudely drawn figure from the earlier sketch lies curled
 up asleep in its roots, and from his head spring dozens of images
 rising in curves and whorls, a panoply of dreams and ideas hovering
 above him, twisting through the branches of the tree.

 It looks like you could see more if you turn the page.

>again

 The next pages are filled with inscrutably dense schematics, notes,
 and calculations, growing smaller and more obtuse by the page until
 they devolve into meaningless scribbles. One cluster of diagrams
 centers around blueprints of a three-sided pyramid structure,
 connected to some elaborate network of underground machinery.

 It looks like you could see more if you turn the page.

>again

 You turn the page.

 You flip past several blank pages before reaching one last sketch on
 the notebook's final page, which seems to have been done much later
 than the others. It shows a man sitting watching the sun set over the
 ocean, his back turned and face invisible, holding the comb with the
 two leaping dolphins. The sketch is sloppy, almost careless, but still
 exudes a palpable sense of sadness and regret.

 The sketchbook is turned to the last page.

>take sketchbook

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 Sand drifts around the open doorway, spilling out in tiny dunes across
 the wooden floorboards, undisturbed. Bare, water-stained walls frame a
 small room, empty and abandoned save for a manta ray <span class="floydstyle em">skeleton</span>
 hanging from one wall; some frayed ropes tied to one beam are the only
 other hint of past furnishings.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>
 (containing the sketchbook).

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to a bright <span class="floydstyle u1">porch</span> or to a
 darker <span class="floydstyle u1">interior</span>. You can also step back <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>porch

 You duck through the small doorway into a windowed porch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin, The Studio</span>
 High, narrow <span class="floydstyle em">windows</span> admit steep slants of daylight into this
 small porch, the purpose of which seems instinctively clear to you the
 moment you enter: it is an artist's studio. The floor is stained with
 paint and clay, and artisan <span class="floydstyle em">tools</span> litter the surface of a
 wall-to-wall workbench, though everything seems to be under a layer of
 thick dust, as if undisturbed for years.

 On the rough plank walls on your left and right, exactly opposite each
 other, hang two spectacular <span class="floydstyle em">paintings</span>.

 The only exit is <span class="floydstyle u1">back</span> to the front room of the cabin.

 Which do you mean, 1) the storybook village painting, or 2) the space
 painting?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tutorial: If something you type might refer to more than one thing,</span>

 type a new command instead.

>1

 You step up to the painting and study it carefully. Immediately, you
 recognize the work of a Wayfarer. The lines and colors are too exact,
 too perfect, too beautiful to be anything but.

 A gently rolling hilltop of lemon-yellow and milky-white wildflowers,
 fantastically profuse, explodes from the surface of this painting. A
 large gathering of smiling people in simple clothes of brown and
 crimson pick the flowers, laughing and smiling: children, parents,
 aunts, grandmothers, all so richly detailed that you can almost hear
 them laughing and calling out to each other. The smell of dusty dry
 pigment somehow suggests the first day of spring, and fresh mountain
 breezes in a sea-blue sky. Beyond the hilltop a storybook village
 basks in late morning haze, thatched roofs and cobbles ringed by
 balding mountaintops, rounded and emerald green.

 A rough-hewn wood frame surrounds the painting, in harsh contrast with
 its elegant beauty. Roughly carved in the lower right is a single word
 in a language you do not recognize.

>space painting

 This painting is obviously the work of a Wayfarer as well. At first
 you think the same artist crafted this one, but subtle differences in
 style instill in you a growing belief otherwise.

 A huge translucent sphere hovers in the center of this painting, miles
 wide, reflecting in bulbous crescent the golden light of a warm gold
 and lemon yellow sun. Inside the sphere is a profusion of life: huge,
 gnarled trees growing in all directions without gravity to guide them;
 thick, mossy vines wrapped everywhere and stretching like tiny green
 threads of emerald through moist air; and people dressed in flowing
 silver-crimson gowns and wide sea-blue wings, gliding between gilded
 wooden villages high in the branches of the massive trunks. In the
 distance, more spheres can be seen, floating serenely amidst the jet
 black backdrop shining with a million milky stars.

 This painting, too, is roughly inscribed with a single word in a
 language you do not recognize.

>tools

 Your heart skips a beat as you realize these are mostly the tools of a
 painter. Clay pots seem to hold paints of varying shades and
 consistencies (though long since dried, useless now) and hides scraped
 smooth to make canvases are strewn around the workbench, along with
 rotting handmade brushes. It will take some time to put everything in
 order, but it looks like most of the tools you'll need to move on,
 when the time comes for that, are here.

>windows

 The roof of the shack extends out beyond the unpaned windows,
 presumably to keep out rain but let in light. Through the windows you
 see the beach, and the black lava flow angling away into the distance.

>back

 You return to the larger front room of the cabin.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The white glow of the beach through the open door is brilliant; your
 eyes struggle to adjust to the dim interior of the cabin instead.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>
 (containing the sketchbook).

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to the brightly-lit <span class="floydstyle u1">studio</span>
 or to a darker <span class="floydstyle u1">interior</span>. You can also step back
 <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>interior

 You step through the doorway into a smaller room at the rear of the
 cabin.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin, Back Room</span>
 Only a dim light filters into this windowless back room. The back
 <span class="floydstyle em">wall</span> seems unnaturally dark, and as your eyes adjust, you
 realize it is not wood but the smoothed face of the lava flow. A wide
 crack in the smoothed wall is filled in by cobblestones near the
 ceiling, and a thick wooden <span class="floydstyle em">door</span> below.

 Other than the door and a pile of smashed wood <span class="floydstyle em">splinters</span> in a
 corner, the only notable feature is the <span class="floydstyle u1">exit</span> back to the
 front room.

>wall

 Nearly vertical here, the lava flow's sharp edges drop smoothed and
 polished from floor to ceiling, a rippling, deep black surface.

>splinters

 The wood looks like it might once have been a cabinet, smashed in some
 long-past fury. Amidst the wreckage, however, rests an ornate
 <span class="floydstyle em">compass</span> in a brass base, apparently intact.

>compass

 The compass is closed, its thin brass cover concealing the needle.

>take compass

 You retrieve the compass from the wreckage and slip the delicate brass
 chain around your neck. It is closed, a brass cover hiding the needle
 itself.

>open compass

 You undo the tiny clasp and open the brass lid, revealing the needle
 under glass.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tutorial: While the compass is open, exits will be described using</span>
 cardinal directions. You may navigate by typing (for example) GO
 NORTH, NORTH, or just N.

>door

 Only just your height but wider than a normal door, its wooden surface
 has been planed smooth to bring out a complex grain. It is unpainted
 except for six small <span class="floydstyle em">bands</span> of vertical color at about eye
 level.

 At about the height you'd expect to see a doorknob runs a smooth arc
 of twelve small <span class="floydstyle em">buttons</span>, each engraved with a stylized
 symbol.

>bands

 Each band seems to have been painted directly on the wood. From left
 to right, the colors are <span class="floydstyle em">red</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">yellow</span>,
 <span class="floydstyle em">black</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">white</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">blue</span>, and <span class="floydstyle em">green</span>.

>buttons

 Each is a circle about the size of one made with a thumb and finger,
 flush with the door but very slightly convex. Stylized symbols are
 inlaid into each one. From left to right, the symbols are
 <span class="floydstyle em">whale</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">manta</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">turtle</span>,

>outside

 You step back outside into the sunlight, walking down the beach in the
 direction of the surf.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The ocean pounds faintly beneath the western horizon, where it meets a
 vast, unclouded sky, so deep a blue your eyes hurt. Pristine white
 <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> almost blinds you as it curves around the lagoon.

 The beach stretches away to the <span class="floydstyle u1">north</span> and <span class="floydstyle u1">south</span>, or
 you could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">west</span> down to where the waves are

 Some distance away, by the shore, you notice the strange man, fishing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The beach widens here in the middle of its sweeping curve around the
 lagoon, rising in graceful white dunes to the sudden black slope of
 the old lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span>. Up against the flow is built a log
 <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span>, looking long-neglected but still intact. Spotless
 white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> almost blinds you as it stretches in a great arc
 around the lagoon.

 The beach stretches away towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span> or
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to where
 the waves are breaking. The cabin lies back <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

>rise

 You amble along the soft white sand of the beach, working your way
 around the edge of the bay.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Rise</span>
 A huge piece of moss-covered driftwood seems to guard the end of the
 beach, dominated by a rocky rise of hardened black lava that thrusts
 out into the sea. The ocean pounds faintly beneath the western
 horizon, the <span class="floydstyle em">lagoon</span> practically glowing as it warms in the
 sparkling sunlight, framed by the rustling of tropical <span class="floydstyle em">trees</span>,
 their green fronds casting welcome shadows across the sand. Gleaming
 white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> curves around the lagoon.

 Opposite the lagoon, the beach is pinched off by black cliffs, but
 near the high water mark you can see a possible route to the top of
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>. Sand stretches back back towards the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">center</span> of the beach, and you could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to
 where the waves are breaking.

 The sky overhead is beginning to fill up with dark <span class="floydstyle em">clouds</span>.

>go up

 You clamber easily over the ancient lava rock, worn smooth by pounding
 surf, till you stand on top.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Old Lava Flow</span>
 Here is where the lava met the sea, after cutting a long swath across
 the island. From your position atop the flow you can see both sides of
 the island: before you, the land drops off into a marshy swamp that
 stretches to the edge of a jagged <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span>, and behind curves
 the tranquil white crescent of the lagoon, protected by the lava flow
 as it rises to the shattered side of the distant <span class="floydstyle em">volcano</span>. You
 are surprised to see a <span class="floydstyle em">ropeway</span> stretches from a meadow high
 atop the mountain to a small base station near the island's corner.

 From here, you could scramble back down to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> or take
 an easier route down the other side of the flow towards the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">edge</span> of the marsh. You can also hear the sound of a
 <span class="floydstyle u1">waterfall</span> through some heavy fronds opposite the sea.

 In the distance, by the shore, you spot the strange man, fishing.

>ropeway

 The ropes rise from the base station on one corner of the island to
 near the top of the mountain across the marsh.

>volcano

 Rising gracefully over this end of the island, the reddish-brown
 slopes of a volcano shimmer in the distant heat haze. Faint wisps of
 steam rise from its hidden caldera. One whole side of the volcano
 seems to have crumbled in some past eruption, spewing forth the long
 black lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span> that bisects the island and forms the back
 wall of the lagoon.

>flow

 The black rock, frozen in mid-tumble, hosts a few tentative green
 shoots and flowers in its maze of nooks and crannies, but the
 vegetation has only begun to reclaim it.

>mountain

 The mountain is a ways off. It dominates one corner of the island, one
 side a sheer cliff face, the other tumbling treacherously into the
 sea. The rocky sides seem to be composed of weathered volcanic rock.

 Perched near the summit is some sort of man-made <span class="floydstyle em">structure</span>.

 Heavy rain clouds race in, blotting out the sun more and more each
 minute.

>structure

 You can't make out any details from this distance, but it definitely
 seems like a man-made structure. A deep ruby glow beams from its
 edges, and you can hear even from here a deep, rhythmic thrumming
 which seems to come from somewhere inside. A strange metallic torus
 surrounds it.

>edge

 You follow the path down a slight mossy slope, enjoying the
 unobstructed panorama before you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Stumps</span>
 The remains of what once must have been a small copse of trees on this
 bit of grassy land overlook the edge of a flat marsh. Across the marsh
 rises a sheer cliff, rising to the summit of an imposing mountain.

 Jutting from the rock near the short drop-off to the sea is a
 roughly-hewn <span class="floydstyle em">block</span> of grey stone.

 Far across the marsh <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> a soggy slope is the sheer cliff
 face of the mountain. You could also follow the drier stretch back
 <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the rise or over to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">shack</span> at the base of
 the ropeway.

>shack

 (new <span class="floydstyle u1">landmark</span> discovered)
 Keeping the marsh on your right and a bluff overlooking the sea to
 your left, you approach a low mound at the corner of the island,
 topped by the shack.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ropeway Base Station</span>
 On this hump of dry land between the sea on two sides and the marsh on
 another, a small shack, open on the side towards the
 <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span>, shelters the base of some sort of <span class="floydstyle em">ropeway</span>
 system. A complex mechanism of ropes and pulleys connects to twin
 cables which stretch up towards the summit of the mountain.

 The ropeway <span class="floydstyle em">mechanism</span> is motionless, no steam flowing from
 the outlet vent poking through the structure's roof. A large
 open-topped wooden <span class="floydstyle em">crate</span>, long and narrow, hangs from the
 cables above, swaying slightly in the breeze.

 The only promising route leads back towards the <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>.

>ropeway

 The ropes rise from the base station in a double arc, first to a pole
 rising from a tall boulder in the marsh, then in a dizzying climb to
 the summit of the mountain high above.

>mechanism

 The mechanism is complex yet elegant. A strange quartz
 <span class="floydstyle em">cylinder</span> marks the spot where a faded blue bamboo
 <span class="floydstyle em">pipe</span>, stretching half-buried in a line towards the stumps,
 joins the main mechanism, which is topped by an outflow <span class="floydstyle em">tube</span>.
 An exquisitely carved wood piston drives a system of pulleys,
 flywheels, and counterweights that connect to two thick
 <span class="floydstyle em">cables</span> rising up to the mountain's summit. A large wood
 <span class="floydstyle em">lever</span> is the only visible control.

>cylinder

 About the height of your hand, this hollow cylinder connects the
 <span class="floydstyle em">pipe</span> to the ropeway <span class="floydstyle em">mechanism</span>. Meticulously carved
 from a solid piece of quartz, you can see through to the inside, where
 floats a tiny pool of standing water.

 A series of thirty delicate rings are etched into the quartz; a firm
 black line marks the point four rings up from the bottom.

 The water level is currently even with the bottom ring.

>examine pipe

 Once coated in now-flaking paint, the pipe, about as wide as your
 fist, is made from thick pieces of bamboo sealed together with vines
 coated with sticky tar.

 The blue pipe, arriving from the direction of the <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>,
 emerges from the ground running parallel to it, then twists up ninety
 degrees at the shack and connects to the ropeway mechanism via a
 transparent quartz <span class="floydstyle em">gauge</span>.

 The seat is covered with years of accumulated grime, and spiderwebs

 On this hump of dry land between the sea on two sides and the marsh on
 another, a small shack, open on the side towards the
 <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span>, shelters the base of the <span class="floydstyle em">ropeway</span>. A
 complex mechanism of ropes and pulleys connects to twin cables which
 stretch up towards the summit of the mountain.

 The ropeway <span class="floydstyle em">mechanism</span> is motionless, no steam flowing from
 the outlet vent poking through the structure's roof. The
 <span class="floydstyle em">crate</span> hangs from the cables, swaying gently in the breeze.

 The only promising route leads back towards the <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>.

>examine ropeway

 The mechanism is complex yet elegant. A quartz pressure <span class="floydstyle em">gauge</span>
 marks the spot where a faded blue bamboo <span class="floydstyle em">pipe</span>, stretching
 half-buried in a line towards the stumps, joins the main mechanism,
 which is topped by an outflow <span class="floydstyle em">tube</span>. An exquisitely carved
 wood piston drives a system of pulleys, flywheels, and counterweights
 that connect to two thick <span class="floydstyle em">cables</span> rising up to the mountain's
 summit. A large wood <span class="floydstyle em">lever</span> is the only visible control.

>examine lever

 The lever stands straight up. It looks like it can be either pushed
 forward (towards the mountain) or pulled back.

>examine pipe

 Once coated in now-flaking paint, the pipe, about as wide as your
 fist, is made from thick pieces of bamboo sealed together with vines
 coated with sticky tar.

 The blue pipe, arriving from the direction of the <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>,
 emerges from the ground running parallel to it, then twists up ninety
 degrees at the shack and connects to the ropeway mechanism via a
 transparent quartz <span class="floydstyle em">gauge</span>.

>examine gauge

 About the height of your hand, this hollow cylinder connects the
 <span class="floydstyle em">pipe</span> to the ropeway <span class="floydstyle em">mechanism</span>. Meticulously carved
 from a solid piece of quartz, you can see through to the inside, where
 floats a tiny pool of standing water.

 A series of thirty delicate rings are etched into the quartz; a firm
 black line marks the point four rings up from the bottom.

 The water level is currently even with the bottom ring.

>push lever

 You push against the lever, but nothing seems to happen, and when you
 release it, it snaps back up to vertical.

 Two <span class="floydstyle em">snails</span> with pearl-white shells cross the ground near your
 feet, leaving milky trails behind.

>examine snails

 The shell is a rich, luminous white, faintly iridescent, that seems to
 almost glow in the sun.

>paint snails

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You used either a verb or a keyword I don't recognize, at least not</span>
 in that combination.

>get snails

 You pick it up for a moment and study it more closely. The shell is a
 rich, luminous white, faintly iridescent, that seems to almost glow in
 the sun. Curiosity satisfied, you return it to the ground.

 A <span class="floydstyle em">snail</span> with a pearly-white shell inches along the ground.

>stumps

 You walk back along the edge of the marsh toward the stumps, moving
 quickly through the rain.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Stumps</span>
 Rain patters off the stumps, seeping into the crumbling wood and
 staining it a rich, deep red-brown.

 Jutting from the rock near the short drop-off to the sea is a
 roughly-hewn <span class="floydstyle em">block</span> of grey stone.

 Far across the marsh <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> a soggy slope is the sheer cliff
 face of the mountain. You could also follow the drier stretch
 <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the rise or back over to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">shack</span> at the
 base of the ropeway.

>go up

 Climbing back up onto the old lava flow, you once again reach the
 viewpoint from its top.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Old Lava Flow</span>
 Rain pools in tiny puddles and depressions atop the lava flow,
 dribbling off the green fronds above you and pattering loudly on the
 lava rock.

 From here, you could scramble down to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> or take an
 easier route back down the other side of the flow towards the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">edge</span> of the marsh. You can also hear the sound of a
 <span class="floydstyle u1">waterfall</span> through some heavy fronds opposite the sea.

 Off by the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> below you, one tree shakes madly, green
 fronds waving as something moves around inside it. Suddenly the
 strange man sticks out his head from the tree, spots you, and waves
 madly.

 "Spirit!" he shouts faintly, "over here! Quickly!"

 The tree near the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> continues to shake. "Hurry!" the
 strange man calls, "come here!"

 You pick your way carefully down the cluster of slippery boulders,
 using handholds to steady yourself, till your feet touch the smooth
 wet sand again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Rise</span>
 Rain patters noisily on the old piece of driftwood, and runs in
 dribbles and curtains down the jagged side of the lava flow. Spotless
 white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> stretches in a great arc around the lagoon.

 Opposite the lagoon, the beach is pinched off by black cliffs, but
 near the high water mark is the route back to the top of the

 beach, and you could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to where the waves are
 breaking.

 "There you are," the strange man says from his elevated perch, pushing
 aside green fronds to get a glimpse of you. "Just harvesting a few of
 these delicious konokuk fruits. Now, don't move. Stay right there."

 There is a further rustling in the trees, and suddenly a hairy brown
 fruit the size of your head and looking hard as a rock is plummeting
 down towards you. You could probably <span class="floydstyle u2">catch</span> it, but it might
 be wiser to <span class="floydstyle u2">dodge</span>.

 With a noise like a hollow plonk, the konokuk fruit smacks into your

 from your vision.

 "Catch!" the strange man shouts helpfully from above. "No, wait a
 ment, that's wrong as wrong. Shout first, then throw, yes yes, that's

 down at you. "Dear oh dear oh, spirit, are you all right?"

 The strange man shimmies down the tree as you sit up weakly, stars
 still swarming through your vision. He bounds over to your side and
 examines your head critically. "Quite a red hill you've got there," he
 shouts, as if not realizing you're much closer now, "my most gushing
 of apologies. Thought the thing would go right through, being
 noncorporeal and all."

 "Well and look here now!" he says, picking up the fruit in delight;
 it's split in two, revealing delicate pink-white flesh inside. "Why

 The sculpture is stunningly beautiful, capturing every curve of the
 graceful manta creature's flattened form. The clear crystal shimmers
 in the sun, and peering closer you can see that the sculpture is
 actually hollow. A <span class="floydstyle em">hatchway</span> on the top provides access to the
 interior.

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> wades into the surf, dives lithely into a
 rolling wave, and surfaces beyond it, kicking out into the ocean.

>hatchway

 A round wheel on top opens the hatchway, which looks airtight.

>open hatchway

 You turn a wooden wheel on the hatchway, pull it open with a wet
 sucking noise, and clamber inside. The interior is just tall enough
 that you can sit up without bumping your head. As you sit, however,
 the hatchway clangs shut behind you, releasing a hidden catch; and the
 manta sculpture glides forward down the track, cuts through the
 breaking waves effortlessly, and descends into a beautiful undersea
 paradise.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Manta, Under the Waves</span>

 The wheel lies flat against the crystal floor of the manta, through
 which you can dimly see some gears and the track below. It looks like
 by gripping the handle you could make a wide stirring motion to turn
 the wheel.

>stir

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You used either a verb or a keyword I don't recognize, at least not</span>
 in that combination.

>turn wheel

 Gripping the handle, you begin turning the wheel. The gears below you
 spin, and you feel the manta slowly pulling back up the track.

 It takes a few minutes, but you slowly emerge from the waves until
 you're resting on the lower beach again, and climb out of the
 sculpture.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Beach</span>
 The tide breaks at your feet, sending warm runners of foam splashing
 around your ankles. The sand is smooth and damp, sprinkled with a
 profusion of shells, small stones, and clumps of seaweed.

 A huge and beautiful <span class="floydstyle em">sculpture</span> of a manta ray, carved from
 some clear crystal, sits on a track running into the waves.

 You can hike back up the beach in one of several directions: towards
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, towards the log <span class="floydstyle u1">cabin</span>, or towards
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> near the path. You could also wade out into the
 ocean <span class="floydstyle u1">waters</span>.

>waters

 You wade out into the surf. The lagoon is shallow enough that you walk
 quite far before the water climbs past your knees.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ocean Waters</span>
 Warm seawater sparkles brilliantly and surges about your waist as you
 wade through the lagoon, the sand like wet velvet under your feet.
 Thunderheads receding westward are lit up like giant floating barges
 by the sinking sun's rays, which are reflected by the <span class="floydstyle em">water</span>
 and the wet, sparkling <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span>.

 Short of swimming out to the ocean, the only real places to go are
 back to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span>, or scrambling up towards the rounded
 <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>.

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> is a few swells away, bobbing lazily as he
 floats on his back, eyes closed.


>man

 Bobbling like a tan cork on the waves, the strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> floats
 serenely, eyes shut, a faint smile on his face.

 He seems a bit out of sorts around you, and regards you with one
 corner of his mouth lifted.


 The strange man floats serenely on the surface of the water, eyes
 closed.


>boulders

 You slosh your way towards the shore, push past the breakpoint where
 the gentle swells tumble over themselves into knee-high waves, and
 finally step back onto the sand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Boulders</span>
 The rounded boulders rise warm and wet in the sinking sun, smelling of
 sea-kissed stone.

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,
 baking in the sunlight.

 Sandy paths wander towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the beach
 opens up towards the edge of the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>. A bank of slippery
 stones stretches <span class="floydstyle u1">towards</span> the wet sand.

>mussels

 A bit longer and wider than a fat thumb, they are a deep forest green
 cut through with striated arcs of lighter shades. Fragments of the
 shells of their ancestors tumble in the surf, diminishing to gritty
 green whorls.

>shells

>get shells

 The living mussels are gripped tightly to the rocks, but you pick up a
 green shell fragment tumbling in the surf and turn it in your hands
 for a moment, admiring the rich coloration, before tossing it back
 into the foam.

 The sun drops quickly towards the horizon, a red-orange ball of flame.

>inventory

 You are wearing a compass and your traveling clothes.

 A gull picks at its feathers with its beak before letting out a loud
 call.

>examine compass

 The compass is closed, its thin brass cover concealing the needle.

>open compass

 You undo the tiny clasp and open the brass lid, revealing the needle
 under glass.

 Two gulls flap wings and caw fiercely at each other for a moment over
 a piece of rotting fish, before one snatches it and takes to the air.

>l compass

 Beautifully made, the compass has a long thin needle under glass, the
 round enclosure set into a brass base delicately inscribed with
 directions in eight points sweeping around from north to northwest. A
 matching chain allows the compass to be worn around the neck.

>close compass

 You shut the compass carefully, letting the small clasp catch again.

 A <span class="floydstyle em">crab</span> wends its way between the boulders, either lost or
 unusually adventurous.

>crab

 About the size of your hand, this curious creature scuttles sideways
 along the sand quite nimbly, holding pincers above him and darting
 eyes on long stalks every way it can.

>get crab

 You reach out your hand for one of the creatures, but it dashes away
 in a panic before you can grab it, tiny legs pumping furiously.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Boulders</span>
 Large mottled boulders rise from the sand here at the end of the
 beach, rubbed smooth by eons of tides and wind, green lichens
 clutching their sides. Across the bay, a rocky volcanic rise sticks
 out into the ocean, forming the lagoon's far boundary; this end is
 framed by a rocky point beyond the boulders.

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,
 baking in the sunlight.

 Sandy paths wander towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the beach
 opens up towards the edge of the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>. A bank of slippery
 stones stretches <span class="floydstyle u1">towards</span> the wet sand.

 A <span class="floydstyle em">gull</span> flutters in from sea and perches on the exact top of a
 large, rounded boulder looming above you.

>gull

 These seem larger and more streamlined than most you've seen, and
 their long yellow beaks are tipped with a vivid indigo rather than
 red. But their cries sound just as you'd expect.

>point

 You weave through the boulder stand, clambering over a few shorter
 rocks here and there, and eventually break out onto a wet, rocky
 point.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tidepools</span>
 The sinking sun sets over this cluster of little <span class="floydstyle em">pools</span>,
 smooth mirrors of the sun above. From here the whole lagoon stretches
 out before you, from the <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span> in the center of the beach to
 the <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">volcano</span>, looming over either end.

 Dry land snakes back towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. There
 is no safe place to enter the ocean from here.

 The <span class="floydstyle em">sun</span> touches the horizon, sinking slowly into the sea in a
 fiery red spectacle.

>pools

 Clinging precariously to every hollow and bowl in the jumbled rock,
 the pools are placid windows into a world of tiny darting
 <span class="floydstyle em">creatures</span> and surprising shades of color.

>creatures

 Bright orange starfish, tiny pastel minnows, and bulbous fingers of
 purple and maroon sea anemones: each tidepool is like a tiny aquarium.

 The <span class="floydstyle em">sun</span> touches the horizon, sinking slowly into the sea in a
 fiery red spectacle.

>sun

 You stare towards the sun as it sinks into the ocean, a brilliant
 ball, but as it sinks into the waves and vanishes, you see nothing
 further.

 The <span class="floydstyle em">sun</span> touches the horizon, sinking slowly into the sea in a

 The sun has slipped beneath the waves.

 The mountain is hazy blue with distance. It dominates one corner of
 the island, one side a sheer cliff face, the other tumbling
 treacherously into the sea. The rocky sides are black and smooth.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tidepools</span>
 Under the fading light are a handful of small <span class="floydstyle em">pools</span>, smooth

 landscape, head shrouded in clouds, the top of its peak glowing a dull

 Dry land snakes back towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. There

 The fading sky grows dim and indistinct as the sky darkens above.

>boulders

 You step carefully back towards the beach until you find yourself
 among the boulders again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Boulders</span>
 The boulders keep a silent vigil in the eerie twilight, like strange
 monuments.

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,
 nearly invisible in the stars.

 Sandy paths wander back towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the
 beach opens up towards the edge of the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>. A bank of
 slippery stones stretches <span class="floydstyle u1">towards</span> the wet sand.

>forest

 You leave the boulders behind and walk back to the smooth white sand
 of the beach.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 The stillness of the great crescent <span class="floydstyle em">beach</span> is magical in the
 half-light; the whole expanse curving out before you quietly
 breathtaking. The sky and the colors of the lagoon are slowly fading
 in the dimming light.

 The beach curves gently around the lagoon, stretching towards the
 distant rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, while disappearing closer at hand back
 into the stand of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. You could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span>
 to where the waves are breaking, or follow a faint path <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span>
 into dense vegetation.

>go up

 You walk back up the path and return to the deep shadow of the forest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>
 Indistinct, shadowless light paints the foliage shades of
 greenish-grey, softened even further by its gentle swaying in unfelt
 breezes.

 The clearing is dominated by the withered <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, vine-wrapped
 trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves springing from
 sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined <span class="floydstyle em">nook</span>
 curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> with the deeper <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

 A few stars twinkle faintly above, emissaries of night's rapid
 approach.

>nook

 It looks like a soft place to curl up in for a nap.

>nap

 You lie down on the bed of leaves, comfortably anchored between the
 two tree roots, and rest comfortably on your back, looking up into the
 sea of dancing lemon-yellow leaves above you.

 Lulled by the rustling of the leaves above and the quiet sigh of the
 tree, you drift into a deep, bottomless sleep.

 The fire roars, stoked high with fresh-chopped wood, its bass growl
 mingling with the laughing soprano crinkles of the stream. Living
 pines form the great beams of the ceiling, their boughs swaying gently
 in invisible breezes and smelling of home and winter. But your
 canvases are gone, replaced by haphazard stacks of long hollow tubes
 of quartz snaking off into the walls and spare flywheels for the
 ropeway, floor to ceiling.

 The front <span class="floydstyle u1">door</span> of the lodge is shut tight. Vague premonitions
 hint at danger outside, some looming responsibility.

 One <span class="floydstyle em">canvas</span> remains, huge, suspended in the center of the room
 and alive with motion.

>canvas

 It twitches and moves, distorted and curling at the edges, more grain
 than image, a signal warped back on itself, degraded, dancing with
 particles of noise. But inside the chaos are forms, shapes, things,
 people.

 You wonder what paints the artist used to produce the effect. Perhaps
 if you stepped <span class="floydstyle u1">closer</span>...

>door

 The door is stuck fast.

 Something tickles the back of your neck, as if someone stands next to
 you. When you turn to look there is nothing, but the feeling of
 <span class="floydstyle em">presence</span> lingers, strengthens.

>presence

 You concentrate on the sensation, probe it delicately, curiously. And
 feel it probe back.

 A <span class="floydstyle em">mind</span>.

>mind

 You recognize the mind as such only basely, innately through some
 whiff, strange but familiar, of consciousness. Overwhelmingly alien
 currents whirl through it, patterns and structures you have no way of
 matching to your own mind's contours, but after a moment you detect
 hints of emotions, faint yet certainly distinct from your own:
 <span class="floydstyle u2">relief</span>, <span class="floydstyle u2">curiosity</span>, <span class="floydstyle u2">impatience</span>. You sense
 you could probe any of these feelings, like memory, but also sense
 inevitable reciprocity: doing so will reveal more of yourself in
 return.

>curiousity

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">If you're trying to converse, make sure you're typing an emphasized</span>
 keyword. Type HELP, select "Detailed Instructions" then "More on
 Conversation" for more help interacting with people.


>curiosity

 Thoughts trickle into your head as you prod delicately at the emotion,
 like juice from an overripe fruit. The curiosity is intense, as if
 you're the first of your kind the presence has ever encountered.

 But no, that isn't right. You struggle to sieve the alien thoughts,
 distill them into something you can process. Not the first, you
 realize after long moments. No. The... fourth?

>fourth

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">If you're trying to converse, make sure you're typing an emphasized</span>
 keyword.


>look

 Everything but the presence has become faded and grey for the moment.

 In a charge of insight you are at once sure, with the surety that
 comes only in dreams, both that you are dreaming now and that this
 <span class="floydstyle em">presence</span> exists outside your dream. It has the same intrusive
 heaviness of a sound slowly pulling you up to wakefulness, or a light
 in darkness, flashing against closed lids.

>presence

 You wonder now whether the weave of this dream, its set and props, are
 not random noise but somehow shaped by this presence, sculpted, as if
 trying to help you make connections, realizations, come to insights
 unexplainable in waking language.

 You wonder next if that thought was your own.

>relief

 More thoughts, more emotion. The relief, you sense, covers a long
 feeling of frustration, tempered despair, the impotence of a job
 almost done but unable to be finished. Now something has changed for
 the better, sudden, unexpected, trailing long after abandoned hopes.
 And that change, unsettlingly, is you.

>impatience

 You prod further. Impatience, yes; you sense more, much more the
 presence wants to tell you. But each of you have much to learn about
 the other before enough understanding has kindled to say it.

>presence

 Some current of thought stirs, obscured, and slowly, slowly begins to
 clear. Finally you think you have it. Sleeping near the tree you
 painted-- and the others like it-- allow this connection with the
 presence, this alien mind. As if it is a receiver--? But no, you only
 speculate; the complexities running under and through this simple
 message cannot bridge the gap between the differences in your minds.

 All you are sure is that it wants you to find them. Find them all.

 The presence ebbs away, loses itself in the static of your mind, and
 is gone.

 One <span class="floydstyle em">canvas</span> remains, huge, suspended in the center of the room

 Out of the corner of your eye, you spot a gloved hand push a

 a tiny crinkle to the wooden floorboards.

 The fine parchment, a rich and creamy brown with flecks of texture, is
 neatly folded into thirds and closed with a red wax seal, adorned with
 a stylized symbol of a bare foot pulling itself free of entangling
 vines.

 You break the seal on the letter and unfold it, parchment crinkling
 heavily under your fingers. Written immaculately in dark ink on the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">{-(* Forest  Path,  Mid  Morning *)-}</span>
 The familiar forest path seems as fresh and exciting in the morning
 light as the first time you saw it. You are beyond excited to carry
 out the plan: finally getting to explore again in the forbidden parts
 of the island! You've stopped (again) in the clearing by the
 <span class="floydstyle em">windsigh</span> tree because your sister is complaining about
 something (again).

 The path runs down to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> or over to the treehouse in
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

 Your <span class="floydstyle em">sister</span> stops nearby, looking worried.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">{-(* Forest  Path,  The  Crack  Of  Dawn *)-}</span>
 You're not really awake yet, the bright morning light stabbing past
 the leaves of the <span class="floydstyle em">windsigh</span> and making you even more nervous.
 You don't usually get up this early, but Laylay was insistent. You've
 got to convince her this is a bad idea.

 The path runs down to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> or across to the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">meadow</span>, and your treehouse is visible through the trees
 deeper in the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Laylay</span> stands near the path down to the beach, with that
 familiar impatient, bossy look on her face.

>windsigh

 You've never really liked these creepy trees. The noise they make
 seems to always be trying to get inside your head.

 "Hey, are we going to just stand here or <span class="floydstyle u2">talk</span>?" Laylay says.

>talk
 Topics: idea, and Dad
 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span> or <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>.


 "Come on, Phoebe," your sister whines impatiently. "We've got to get

 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span> or <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>.

 "What are you talking about?" Laylay says in an exasperated tone. "I
 told you. <span class="floydstyle u2">Dad</span> won't wake up for hours. We just have to sneak
 past his hammock in the cabin. I already opened the door last night

 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span> or <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>.

 "Dad can take care of himself," Laylay says almost angrily, pulling

 stands a little taller, but her lip quivers. "I think his

 it any more, or something. We're not going anywhere, so we might as
 well get to know this place."

>exploring

 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span> or <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>.

 "We've explored every inch of this side," Laylay reiterates, tossing
 her hair. "The marsh, the lagoon, the forest, everything. But dad's
 never even let us go into the crack and the volcano, or set foot on
 the other side, like <span class="floydstyle u2">something</span> terrible would happen to us if

 we hold on to him real tight when he does it. But we only ever saw him

 last night and you saw how distracted he was. If he's not even going
 to trust us then we have to find it too. Because we're here too, not
 just him, and we deserve to know what's going on." Laylay looks on the
 verge of crying, fists balled, breathing quickly. "So are you coming
 with me?"

 "Good," Laylay says, "then it's decided. We're doing it. Come on." And
 she turns and steps lightly down the path toward the bright

 Blinking and yawning, you rise to your feet and stretch. The strange
 dreams don't seem to fade, but linger hazily in the back of your mind.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>
 Shafts of sunlight kiss the treetops of the tiny clearing amid a
 profusion of greenery.

 The clearing is dominated by the withered <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, vine-wrapped
 trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves springing from
 sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined <span class="floydstyle em">nook</span>
 curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> with the deeper <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

>forest

 Making slow progress, you venture deeper into the forest along the
 nearly-vanished path, ducking under vines and walking through
 knee-deep clusters of fallen leaves and dense ground cover. The ground
 slopes up to your left and down to your right, but you stay relatively
 level.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Big Tree, Beneath the Treehouse</span>
 Before you stands -- curious -- another <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span> like the one you
 painted, larger than the first one and different in another notable
 way: a small strange <span class="floydstyle em">treehouse</span>, all curves and strange
 extrusions, is built in its lower branches, overgrown with moss and
 vegetation, vines running up and down the sagging rope ladder leading
 to its covered interior. The ground drops off behind the tree, but
 opposite the forest slopes gently upwards.

 The rotting rope ladder leads <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> through the open doorway of
 the treehouse. The way back to the <span class="floydstyle u1">path</span> is open, and opposite
 that the forest seems to give way to open <span class="floydstyle u1">terrain</span> the way you
 came.

>go up

 You put your hands on the rope ladder, testing your weight gently on
 rungs woven from vines that look dangerously rotted, but surprisingly
 the ladder holds your weight easily. You climb the rope ladder
 awkwardly and hoist yourself up into the small interior.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Treehouse</span>
 This child-sized house was obviously built with love-- the detailed
 <span class="floydstyle em">etchings</span> of flowers along the length of the doorjamb, if
 nothing else, speak to that-- but the child for whom it was
 constructed must now be long grown. Greenery overruns every surface,
 vines and leaves blurring the lines of cut boards and straight
 railings. The tree has grown, too, tilting the floor and setting the
 shelves and windows subtly askew.

 A small wooden shelf attached to the trunk sits gathering dust, just
 above a <span class="floydstyle em">hammock</span> neatly hung in one corner. Something
 <span class="floydstyle em">round</span> and wooden lies in a dusty corner underneath it,
 forgotten.

 The only exit from the one-room treehouse is <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> the rope
 ladder you came in on.

>etching

 Years of rain have softened the carvings, but even so they remain a
 marvel of craftsmanship. The detail is such that it is hard to tell
 where the real leaves and vines end and the carvings begin.

>hammock

 The carefully twined ropes that make up this hammock must be spaced in
 a way disagreeable to the otherwise ubiquitous vines, as they have not
 progressed too far along it. It's tied between the treehouse railing
 and a thick main branch of the tree, and still seems to be in good
 shape.

>round

 You reach down, pick up the smooth wooden object -- it's surprisingly
 heavy -- and turn it around to discover that it's a richly detailed
 carving of a human head. You place it on a shelf and examine it more
 carefully.

 The head, which bears a passing resemblance to the strange man, is
 expertly carved from some richly-grained wood. Within the eye sockets
 are two wooden <span class="floydstyle em">spheres</span> inscribed with two strange symbols. A
 large wooden <span class="floydstyle em">key</span> on the back looks like it can be wound to
 activate some internal mechanism. Visible joins at the head's right
 <span class="floydstyle em">ear</span> would seem to indicate it can be moved somehow; the left
 ear, however, is missing.

>spheres

 Each eye seems to be an independent sphere within the head; you can
 see inside the mechanism just enough to see a series of dowels and
 tiny wooden gears inside. Within the sockets are the two wooden
 spheres inscribed with two strange symbols.

>key

 It looks like it winds some mechanism inside the head if you turn it.

>wind key

 You wind the large handle several times, then release it. Whirs and
 thunks come from inside the head. The wooden mouth opens and closes
 slightly and lets out a mechanical exhalation that, while crude, is
 clearly distinguishable as a sound: "Lih. Lih. Lih." Then, wound down,
 the mouth stops moving and the sound fizzles out.

>spheres

 Each eye seems to be an independent sphere within the head; you can
 see inside the mechanism just enough to see a series of dowels and
 tiny wooden gears inside. Within the sockets are the two wooden
 spheres inscribed with two strange symbols.

>symbols

 Delicately inscribed, they are in some strange language you've never
 before seen, with graceful curls and arcs.

 The only exit from the one-room treehouse is <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> the rope

>nap

 Stretching out in the comfortable hammock, you soon find yourself
 drifting into a deep, bottomless sleep.

 *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *

 You drowse lazily, half-aware on occasion of your surroundings, but
 also half-aware of something else, faint ticklings of premonition or
 urgent murmurs you can't quite catch, seeping up from some fuller,
 deeper sleep.

 You awaken a few hours later, feeling refreshed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Treehouse</span>
 Birds take flight as you stir, shaking and twirling the vines and
 leaves as they glow in the warm morning light.

 <span class="floydstyle em">head</span>, just above a <span class="floydstyle em">hammock</span> neatly hung in one

 The only exit from the one-room treehouse is <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> the rope
 ladder you came in on.

 Seagulls circle lazily above your head, their cries echoing faintly
 through the forest.

>inventory

 You are wearing your traveling clothes and a compass.

>get head

 It's surprisingly heavy, and would be difficult to take down the
 ladder with you. You may as well leave it here.

>go down

 Stepping outside, you discover that the morning sun has moved higher
 into the sky, chasing off the long dawn shadows.

 You grip the leaf-covered lintel and lower yourself onto the rope
 ladder, quickly descending six or seven rungs to the ground below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Big Tree, Beneath the Treehouse</span>
 Morning sunlight streams through the curved windows of the
 <span class="floydstyle em">treehouse</span>, the lemon-yellow leaves of the withered
 <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span> casting burnt copper shadows on its warped boards.

 The rotting rope ladder leads <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> through the open doorway of
 the treehouse. The way to the <span class="floydstyle u1">path</span> is open, and opposite that
 the forest seems to give way to open <span class="floydstyle u1">terrain</span> the way you
 came.

>treehouse

 The treehouse is tall and all organic curves and lumps, not a straight
 line to be seen. The windows are skinny ovals of differing sizes; the
 roof slopes up here, extrudes outwards there, and is thatched in each
 spot with wildly differing material. Despite the obvious work that
 went into its construction, it now seems overgrown and long abandoned,
 eerie somehow through the negative presence of absent children.

>tree

 Like the other one you saw, the tree seems stunted and out of place.
 Spirals of <span class="floydstyle em">vine</span> sprout from the gnarled trunk and wrap
 tightly around it before spreading out to knobby branches beginning
 just above your head. The branches bifurcate until they end in tiny,
 bare pointed twigs. As the vines spiral around them they sprout
 hundreds of small lemon-yellow <span class="floydstyle em">leaves</span>. Even more curious is
 that dozens of <span class="floydstyle em">holes</span> seem to have organically grown through
 the branches, as if they split and reconnected to themselves as the
 tree was growing; these also continue all the way out to the tiny
 twigs, shrinking in size as they go.

>vine

 The vines sprout from orifices about the size of your wrist spread out
 all over the trunk of the tree, and wrap tightly around it in a helix
 spiraling up, splitting and shrinking in diameter, until each one
 leaves the trunk to twine out around a branch, sprouting hundreds of
 small lemon-yellow <span class="floydstyle em">leaves</span>.

>holes

 They range in size from knobby round gaps nearly as big as your head,
 in crooks and splits near the trunk, to tiny pinholes trailing along
 the ends of the smallest branches, and run all the way through the
 wood, letting you see through to the other side.

>leaves

 Each flower or leaf is about the size of your thumbnail, perfectly
 circular, slightly concave, and the color of a deep, almost
 fluorescent lemon yellow. Subtle veins run through the
 semi-translucent skin. They sprout from the vines wrapped around the
 branches, each about a finger width apart.

 The distant sounds of surf break faintly through the muffling
 vegetation.

>path

 Cutting back along the route you found earlier, you wade through the
 forest undergrowth, under the slanted rays of the sun rising ever
 higher in the tropical sky.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>
 Spears of light penetrate the forest, yellow-gold spotlights on the
 greenery around you, which sways gently in the breeze.

 The clearing is dominated by the withered <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, vine-wrapped
 trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves springing from
 sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined <span class="floydstyle em">nook</span>
 curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> with the deeper <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

>beach
 Topics: island, poke, smile, frown, and rebuke
 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span>, <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>, or change the
 <span class="floydstyle u2">subject</span>.


 You follow the overgrown path down a slight slope towards a bright
 open area, picking your way over fallen trees and slippery earth, and
 finally emerge from the trees on some grassy mounds at the edge of a
 beach.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Spotless white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> curves around the lagoon. The ocean
 pounds faintly beneath the western horizon, where it meets a vast,
 unclouded sky, so deep a blue your eyes hurt.

 The beach curves gently around the lagoon, stretching towards the
 distant rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, while disappearing closer at hand into
 the stand of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. You could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to
 where the waves are breaking, or follow a faint path back <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span>
 into dense vegetation.

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> is here, walking carefully up and down the
 beach and studying the sand critically. His arms are full of bits of
 wood, seaweed, and broken shells.

 "Playing explorer, are we?" the strange man asks, flexing his toes in
 the spotless sand beneath him. "The brave heroine on the tropical
 <span class="floydstyle u2">island</span>?" He giggles and pokes you. "My duckling, the
 explorer."

 He playfully pokes you again, and you wonder whether you should
 <span class="floydstyle u2">poke</span> him back, <span class="floydstyle u2">smile</span> politely, <span class="floydstyle u2">frown</span>,
 angrily <span class="floydstyle u2">rebuke</span> him, or just do <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span>.

 You wait till he moves in for his next strike, then give him a solid
 poke straight in the ribs, with a bit of tickle worked in. He opens
 his eyes wide in surprise, then laughs. "Learn fast for a duckling,"
 he says. "Think I'll ratherly enjoy having you around after all. How
 are you then anyway? Some <span class="floydstyle u2">subject</span> you wanted to talk about?"

 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span>, <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>, or change the

 "But Something Further, you haven't been officially welcomed yet!" he
 says, leaping onto the grassy mounds and spreading his arms wide,
 spinning around dizzily to take in the whole island. "Welcome
 welcome," he says grandly, "to Lacuna!"

 "That's what it's called, if you ring," he adds. "Or 'My Lacuna' if
 I'm feeling territorialish. There's a trickling good story about how
 it acquired that name but," he leaps back down to the sand again, "I'm
 afraid I've entirely forgotten it. Ah well-oh. Lacuna!"

 He holds up three fingers. "There's Three Great Men who used to live
 here," he says, "the <span class="floydstyle u2">Sculptor</span>, the <span class="floydstyle u2">Father</span>, and the
 <span class="floydstyle u2">Madman</span>. All gone as gone now, but each left a secret, oh!
 green eons ago, and now they're sort of tourist attractions. You get a
 prize if you find them all! The secrets. Or so the tourist board says.
 Of course there aren't any tourists here. Real ones I mean, no
 offenses. But tell you this: you find all three <span class="floydstyle u2">secrets</span> and
 I'll give you a little something anyway."

 "Watch out for the Creeper!" He turns his attention back to cleaning
 the beach.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Pristine white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> stretches in a great arc around the
 lagoon. The ocean pounds faintly beneath the western horizon, the
 <span class="floydstyle em">lagoon</span> practically glowing as it warms in the sparkling
 sunlight.

 The beach curves gently around the lagoon, stretching towards the
 distant rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, while disappearing closer at hand into
 the stand of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. You could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> is here, walking carefully up and down the

 wood, seaweed, and broken shells.

>rise

 You follow the sweeping curve of the beach about halfway around its
 edge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 Morning sunlight beams over the top of the lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span>, warming
 the sand and the roof of the <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span> in patches. Spotless white
 <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> stretches in a great arc around the lagoon.

 The beach stretches away back towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>
 or the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to
 where the waves are breaking. The cabin lies <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

>flow

 The black rock, frozen in mid-tumble, hosts a few tentative green
 shoots and flowers in its maze of nooks and crannies, but the
 vegetation has only begun to reclaim it.

>cabin

 The small cabin lies well <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> above the high water mark, but
 stains and crusted salt near its base indicate spring tides have
 reached it in the past, and give the small building the feel of a
 place abandoned. The cabin rests flush against the black lava
 <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span> behind it.

 From halfway up the eastern sky, the sun burns down brightly.

>go up

 You clamber up the slipping sand past seaweed and shells at the
 high-water mark, then onto sturdier ground, before finally arriving at
 the building and stepping inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The white glow of the beach through the open door is brilliant; your
 eyes struggle to adjust to the dim interior of the cabin instead.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>
 (containing the sketchbook).

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to the brightly-lit <span class="floydstyle u1">studio</span>
 or to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">storage</span> room. You can also step back
 <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>box

 The box is a perfect cube, each side about the length of your forearm,
 carved from interlocking pieces of wood which fit together seamlessly
 without nails or mismatched joins. Intricate <span class="floydstyle em">carvings</span> cover
 every surface. Salt crusts the lower third, where the wood is swollen
 and discolored.

 The top of the cube has swung open, revealing a delicate
 <span class="floydstyle em">sketchbook</span>, seemingly undamaged.

>carvings

 The carvings, impossibly tiny, make up one immense, tropical scene.
 Splashing dolphins segue seamlessly into beaches littered with shells,
 tall, graceful palm trees, laughing children, and fanciful animals.
 You could study these carvings for hours without taking in all the
 detail.

 Along the top of the cube, worked into the design, are five oval
 <span class="floydstyle em">indentations</span>.

>sketchbook

 You examine the sketchbook carefully, a beautiful handmade thing,
 thick paper pressed from some creamy-tan wood, the spiral binding a
 thin coil of copper-colored metal. On the cover is a handwritten
 <span class="floydstyle em">inscription</span>.

 You flip past several blank pages before reaching one last sketch on
 the notebook's final page, which seems to have been done much later
 than the others. It shows a man sitting watching the sun set over the
 ocean, his back turned and face invisible, holding the comb with the
 two leaping dolphins. The sketch is sloppy, almost careless, but still
 exudes a palpable sense of sadness and regret.

 The sketchbook is turned to the last page.

>indentations

 Four are clustered together in an arc, the fifth farther apart.

>inscriptions

 The message is written in strange letters that you don't understand.

              ' .---- ---- ---- ----
     --- -- ----- --- ---  ,--- ----
    ---- ---- ---- -- ----- --- ---'

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 Sand drifts around the open doorway, spilling out in tiny dunes across
 the wooden floorboards disturbed only by your footsteps. Bare,
 water-stained walls frame a small room, empty and abandoned save for a
 manta ray <span class="floydstyle em">skeleton</span> hanging from one wall; some frayed ropes
 tied to one beam are the only other hint of past furnishings.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to the brightly-lit <span class="floydstyle u1">studio</span>
 or to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">storage</span> room. You can also step back
 <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>skeleton

 The skeleton, mounted on the wall, makes a large diamond, and must
 have once belonged to some flat, manta ray creature with rare
 elegance. Now, bleached and dusty, it only seems to add to the
 loneliness and neglect of the cabin.

>storage

 You step through the doorway into a smaller room at the rear of the
 cabin.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin, Back Room</span>
 Only a dim light filters into this windowless back room. The smoothed
 face of the lava flow forms the back <span class="floydstyle em">wall</span> of the room. A wide
 crack in the smoothed wall is filled in by cobblestones near the
 ceiling, and a thick wooden <span class="floydstyle em">door</span> below.

 Other than the door and a pile of smashed wood splinters in a corner,
 the only notable feature is the <span class="floydstyle u1">exit</span> back to the front room.

 Nearly vertical here, the lava flow's sharp edges drop smoothed and
 polished from floor to ceiling, a rippling, deep black surface.

 You walk around the edge of the beach towards some rockier terrain, a
 few gusts of warming wind swirling listlessly around you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Gleaming white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> curves around the lagoon. The ocean

 The boulders stand stoically in the sunlight, their rounded tops

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,

 Sandy paths wander towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the beach

 You walk down towards the breakers on dampening sand, the ground
 baking underneath your feet.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Beach</span>
 The tide breaks at your feet, sending warm runners of foam to kiss the
 wet sand by your feet. The sand is smooth and damp, sprinkled with a
 profusion of shells, small stones, and clumps of seaweed.

 A huge and beautiful <span class="floydstyle em">sculpture</span> of a manta ray, carved from
 some clear crystal, sits on a track running into the waves.

 You can hike back up the beach in one of several directions: towards
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, towards the log <span class="floydstyle u1">cabin</span>, or towards
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> near the path. You could also wade out into the
 ocean <span class="floydstyle u1">waters</span>.

>open hatchway

 You turn a wooden wheel on the hatchway, pull it open with a wet
 sucking noise, and clamber inside. The interior is just tall enough
 that you can sit up without bumping your head. As you sit, however,
 the hatchway clangs shut behind you, releasing a hidden catch; and the
 manta sculpture glides forward down the track, cuts through the
 breaking waves effortlessly, and descends into a beautiful undersea
 paradise.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Manta, Under the Waves</span>
 Surrounding you on all sides is a fantastic underwater vista. Brightly
 colored <span class="floydstyle em">fish</span> twirl and dart among coral reefs and gently
 waving plants of red and green. Sunlight filters heavily through the
 waves and the transparent crystal of the sculpture; the facets are so
 expertly carved you hardly notice it's there.

 The hatchway above leads <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>, though you probably don't
 want to use it while you're underwater. A large wooden <span class="floydstyle em">wheel</span>
 on the floor seems to interface with the track on the ocean floor,
 which ends beneath you.

 Above you through the crystal, you can see the strange man, floating
 languidly on the surface of the water.


>fish

 A few skinny silvery fish float by, feeding on tiny specks suspended
 in the water.

 A wave swirls chaotically past the surface above you, tugging at the
 green and red fronds on the floor and causing them to bob and sway
 hypnotically.

>fish

 A energetic swell surges by above your head, pulling all the fish
 along in its momentary disruption of the current.

>fish

 An electric green fish with fins four times longer than its body darts
 up to the surface, about a body's length above you, to snatch some
 morsel floating on the swell.

 A wave swirls chaotically past the surface above you, tugging at the
 green and red fronds on the floor and causing them to bob and sway
 hypnotically.

>fish

 Glowing rayfish glide effortlessly through the black lagoon.

 Tens of dozens of lacy black fish float by, drifting lazily in the
 swells.

>turn wheel

 Gripping the handle, you begin turning the wheel. The gears below you
 spin, and you feel the manta slowly pulling back up the track.

 It takes a few minutes, but you slowly emerge from the waves until
 you're resting on the lower beach again, and climb out of the
 sculpture.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Beach</span>
 The tide breaks at your feet, sending warm runners of foam to kiss the
 wet sand by your feet. The sand is smooth and damp, sprinkled with a

 the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> near the path. You could also wade out into the
 ocean <span class="floydstyle u1">waters</span>.

>sculpture

 The sculpture is stunningly beautiful, capturing every curve of the
 graceful manta creature's flattened form. The clear crystal shimmers
 in the sun, and peering closer you can see that the sculpture is
 actually hollow. A <span class="floydstyle em">hatchway</span> on the top provides access to the
 interior.

>beach

 You hike up the drying beach leaving the soft crash of the surf far
 behind.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Spotless white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> almost blinds you as it stretches in a
 great arc around the lagoon. The ocean pounds faintly beneath the
 western horizon, where it meets a vast, unclouded sky, so deep a blue
 your eyes hurt.

 The beach curves gently around the lagoon, stretching towards the
 distant rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, while disappearing closer at hand into
 the stand of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. You could also head back <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span>
 to where the waves are breaking, or follow a faint path <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span>
 into dense vegetation.

>sand

 Startlingly bright, the beach is smooth and featureless, white curves
 unblemished by imperfections.

>go up

 You walk back up the path and return to the shade of the forest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>
 Spears of light penetrate the forest, yellow-gold spotlights on the
 greenery around you, which sways gently in the breeze.

 The clearing is dominated by the withered <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, vine-wrapped
 trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves springing from
 sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined <span class="floydstyle em">nook</span>
 curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> with the deeper <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

>tree

 It certainly is a curious tree. Spirals of <span class="floydstyle em">vine</span> sprout from
 the gnarled trunk and wrap tightly around it before spreading out to
 knobby branches beginning just above your head. The branches bifurcate
 until they end in tiny, bare pointed twigs. As the vines spiral around
 them they sprout hundreds of small lemon-yellow <span class="floydstyle em">leaves</span>. Even
 more curious is that dozens of <span class="floydstyle em">holes</span> seem to have organically
 grown through the branches, as if they split and reconnected to
 themselves as the tree was growing; these also continue all the way
 out to the tiny twigs, shrinking in size as they go.

 The tree is nothing like the surrounding vegetation, and seems stunted
 somehow-- though you can't say what creates that impression, with
 nothing to compare it to.

>forest

 Making slow progress, you venture deeper into the forest along the
 nearly-vanished path, ducking under vines and walking through
 knee-deep clusters of fallen leaves and dense ground cover. The ground
 slopes up to your left and down to your right, but you stay relatively
 level.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Big Tree, Beneath the Treehouse</span>
 The angled roof of the wavy <span class="floydstyle em">treehouse</span> shades the indistinct
 interior from the beating sun, which sparkles the shimmering leaves of
 the withered <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span> into amber.

 The rotting rope ladder leads <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> through the open doorway of
 the treehouse. The way back to the <span class="floydstyle u1">path</span> is open, and opposite
 that the forest seems to give way to open <span class="floydstyle u1">terrain</span> the way you
 came.

>tree

 Like the other one you saw, the tree seems stunted and out of place.
 Spirals of <span class="floydstyle em">vine</span> sprout from the gnarled trunk and wrap
 tightly around it before spreading out to knobby branches beginning
 just above your head. The branches bifurcate until they end in tiny,
 bare pointed twigs. As the vines spiral around them they sprout

>go up

 You climb the rope ladder awkwardly and hoist yourself up into the
 small interior.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Treehouse</span>
 Things are cool and quiet in the shade of the treehouse; the vines and
 overgrowth spill eagerly through the windows as if trying to escape
 from the heat of the day.

 A small wooden shelf attached to the trunk supports the clockwork
 <span class="floydstyle em">head</span>, just above a <span class="floydstyle em">hammock</span> neatly hung in one
 corner.

 The only exit from the one-room treehouse is <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> the rope
 ladder you came in on.

>head

 The head, which bears a passing resemblance to the strange man, is
 expertly carved from some richly-grained wood. Within the eye sockets
 are two wooden <span class="floydstyle em">spheres</span> inscribed with two strange symbols. A
 large wooden <span class="floydstyle em">key</span> on the back looks like it can be wound to
 activate some internal mechanism. Visible joins at the head's right
 <span class="floydstyle em">ear</span> would seem to indicate it can be moved somehow; the left
 ear, however, is missing.

>ear

 The ear is a remarkable carving, all smooth curves and fine detail.
 Where is it joined to the head is a visible seam, as if the ear can be
 moved somehow.

 The distant sounds of surf break faintly through the muffling
 vegetation.

>turn ear

 The ear rotates as you twist it, and the head's right eye moves with
 it, clunking into place centered on another curious symbol. You
 quickly rotate the ear backwards and forwards and see that there are 9
 unique symbols it can be set to, before returning it to its original
 position (number 3).

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Try typing SET EAR TO 5, for example, to move the ear more</span>
 precisely.

>set ear to 5

 The right ear turns under your hand, catching at each number, until
 the head's right eye shows the proper symbol.

>turn key

 You wind the large handle several times, then release it. Whirs and
 thunks come from inside the head. The wooden mouth opens and closes
 slightly and lets out a mechanical exhalation that, while crude, is
 clearly distinguishable as a sound: "Loo. Loo. Loo." Then, wound down,
 the mouth stops moving and the sound fizzles out.

 Seagulls circle lazily above your head, their cries echoing faintly
 through the forest.

>set ear to 1

 The right ear turns under your hand, catching at each number, until
 the head's right eye shows the proper symbol.

 Birds twitter and small creatures scatter through the underbrush.

 the mouth stops moving and the sound fizzles out.

 One at a time, you move through all the symbols around the right ear.
 Each one, it would seem, is a different vowel sound; the missing left
 ear must be used to change the beginning of the sound to something
 other than "L."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Treehouse</span>
 This child-sized house was obviously built with love-- the detailed
 <span class="floydstyle em">etchings</span> of flowers along the length of the doorjamb, if
 nothing else, speak to that-- but the child for whom it was
 constructed must now be long grown. Greenery overruns every surface,
 vines and leaves blurring the lines of cut boards and straight
 railings. The tree has grown, too, tilting the floor and setting the
 shelves and windows subtly askew.

 A small wooden shelf attached to the trunk supports the clockwork
 <span class="floydstyle em">head</span>, just above a <span class="floydstyle em">hammock</span> neatly hung in one

>go down

 You grip the leaf-covered lintel and lower yourself onto the rope
 ladder, quickly descending six or seven rungs to the ground below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Big Tree, Beneath the Treehouse</span>
 The angled roof of the wavy <span class="floydstyle em">treehouse</span> shades the indistinct
 interior from the beating sun, which sparkles the shimmering leaves of

 The rotting rope ladder leads <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> through the open doorway of

 the forest seems to give way to open <span class="floydstyle u1">terrain</span> the way you
 came.

>terrain

 The ground begins to slope up as you push towards the edge of the
 forest, sweating in the hot sunlight. Finally, you break through the
 edge of the trees into a brighter, more open space.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Volcano Slopes</span>
 The trees fail entirely at this spot, giving way to the smooth brown
 slopes of a tall <span class="floydstyle em">volcano</span>, fortunately quiet at the moment. A
 few clusters of berry <span class="floydstyle em">bushes</span> ease the transition into more
 barren terrain above, but the undergrowth twists into an impassable
 thicket down slope.

 You could take an easy but long hike up to the volcano's <span class="floydstyle u1">rim</span>,
 or return back to the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

>rim

 The slope is steep but lack of obstacles makes it a relatively easy
 climb. Sweltering in the heat of the sun, you rise quickly up the
 slope until at last you stand atop the volcano, on the lip of the
 caldera.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rim of Volcano</span>
 You shield your eyes from the glare, heat waves shimmering in the
 distance before you, and take in the whole of the island, trying to
 get your bearings. From up here on the volcano's rim, it's the most
 striking features that catch your glance. The distant surf glimmers in
 the light of the sun, while the <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span> rises dramatically
 over the landscape, head shrouded in clouds. The east half of the
 island is filled with a dense rain <span class="floydstyle em">forest</span>. Beneath your feet,
 steep slopes curve down to the volcano's sunlit <span class="floydstyle em">caldera</span>,
 where pockets of steam rise amid jumbled rocks and moss. There's no
 getting down that side; <span class="floydstyle u1">back</span> the way you came is your only
 option.

 Surrounding the island on all sides is deep blue ocean flecked with
 dancing whitecaps, broken only by a distant column of <span class="floydstyle em">steam</span>
 rising from the water, bent by the winds into a vertical cloud slowly
 merging into the sky.

 Rising from the muddy dirt on the very lip of the crater is a
 magnificent <span class="floydstyle em">sculpture</span>.

>sculpture

 Perched precariously on the very lip of the crater is a magnificent
 abstract sculpture carved from some blue crystalline material, a few
 heads taller than you. It seems to show a stylized man, twisted into a
 spiral, both arms stretched to the sky as if he is about to take
 flight. But his feet are hopelessly mired in the mud, and a distorted
 expression of pain, frustration, and rage is carved into his long,
 twisted face as he struggles to free himself.

 It's remarkably well-done, the work of a master, even, but a thousand
 minute signs (and, indeed, the subject matter) tell you it wasn't left
 behind by a Wayfarer. It's good, but not enough.

 Carved in the side of the sculpture is an <span class="floydstyle em">inscription</span>.

>inscription

 You recognize some of the letters from the clockwork head in the
 treehouse, but the message is still mostly incomprehensible.

                          ... -e-a--

 You shield your eyes from the glare, first pausing for a moment to
 wipe the sweat from your brow, and take in the island vista again.
 From up here on the volcano's rim, it's the most striking features
 that catch your glance. A large, craggy <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span> looms up
 into the clouds, hazy blue with distance, and the glimmering curve of
 the distant beach reflects the sunlight like a mirror. The east half
 of the island is filled with a dense rain <span class="floydstyle em">forest</span>. Beneath
 your feet, steep slopes curve down to the volcano's sunlit
 <span class="floydstyle em">caldera</span>, where jumbled rocks cause a confusion of lines and

>caldera

 The view across the crater rim and down to the smooth black floor of
 the caldera is fantastic. Wisps of steam rise from points across the
 floor, mostly concentrated at a point beneath you, while across from
 here is a small cinder cone.

 About halfway to the horizon, the column of steam must foretell some
 significant geological event taking place under the waves, perhaps the
 precursor to the dormant volcano's successor.

 The mountain is hazy blue with distance. It dominates one corner of
 the island, one side a sheer cliff face, the other tumbling
 treacherously into the sea. The rocky sides are black and smooth.

>forest

 The deep greens of the forest fill their side of the island, from low
 cliffs running along its eastern boundary to the northern slopes of
 the volcano. At the forest's northern end, a huge ravine separates it
 from the mountain.

 The forest is a mostly level plateau, except for one
 <span class="floydstyle em">depression</span> near its eastern side.

>depresion

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You used either a verb or a keyword I don't recognize, at least not</span>

 The deep, circular depression seems unusual in the otherwise
 relatively level topography of the forest. A faint metallic glint
 pokes through the thick vegetation. From this great distance you can't
 make out any further details, or see what's at the bottom.

>back

 Taking one last look around, you head back down the volcano, taking
 giant steps as you let gravity pull you rapidly down to the edge of
 the forest.

 Close to the ground but with many wide, gently arcing branches, the
 profusion of bushes bears many red <span class="floydstyle em">berries</span>, about as wide as
 your pinky.

>berries

 The berries are plump, the ripest ones a deep crimson, and give
 slightly to your touch. A few are greener and harder, but most seem
 quite ripe.

>eat berries

 You pluck a berry from the closest bush and pop it into your mouth.
 The flavor is remarkable: an almost fizzy quality gives way to a
 sweet, tropical taste, and crimson juice stains your fingers red.

 Spears of light penetrate the forest, yellow-gold spotlights on the

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> with the deeper <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

 You follow the overgrown path down a slight slope towards a bright
 open area, picking your way over fallen trees and slippery earth, and
 finally emerge from the trees on some grassy mounds at the edge of a
 beach.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Gleaming white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> almost blinds you as it stretches in a

 western horizon, where it meets a vast, unclouded sky, so deep a blue
 your eyes hurt.

 The beach curves gently around the lagoon, stretching towards the
 distant rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, while disappearing closer at hand into
 the stand of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. You could also head <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to

 Some distance away, in the lagoon, you notice the strange man,
 swimming.

 You walk down towards the breakers on dampening sand, your shadow
 almost vanished in the noon sun.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Beach</span>
 The tide breaks at your feet, sending warm runners of foam splashing
 around your ankles. The sand is smooth and damp, sprinkled with a
 profusion of shells, small stones, and clumps of seaweed.

 A huge and beautiful <span class="floydstyle em">sculpture</span> of a manta ray, carved from
 some clear crystal, sits on a track running into the waves.

 You can hike back up the beach in one of several directions: towards
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, towards the log <span class="floydstyle u1">cabin</span>, or towards

 You wade out into the surf. The lagoon is shallow enough that you walk
 quite far before the water climbs past your knees.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ocean Waters</span>
 Warm seawater surges about your waist as you wade through the lagoon,
 the sand like wet velvet under your feet. The ocean pounds faintly
 beneath the western horizon, the <span class="floydstyle em">lagoon</span> practically glowing
 as it warms in the sparkling sunlight.

 Short of swimming out to the ocean, the only real places to go are
 back to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span>, or scrambling up towards the rounded
 <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>.

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> is a few swells away, bobbing lazily as he
 floats on his back, eyes closed.


>boulders

 You slosh your way towards the shore, push past the breakpoint where
 the gentle swells tumble over themselves into knee-high waves, and
 finally step back onto the sand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Boulders</span>
 A <span class="floydstyle em">crab</span> wends its way between the boulders, either lost or
 unusually adventurous.

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,
 baking in the sunlight.

 Sandy paths wander towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the beach
 opens up towards the edge of the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>. A bank of slippery
 stones stretches <span class="floydstyle u1">towards</span> the wet sand.

>crab

 About the size of your hand, this curious creature scuttles sideways
 along the sand quite nimbly, holding pincers above him and darting
 eyes on long stalks every way it can.

>towards

 You walk down towards the breakers on dampening sand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Beach</span>
 The tide breaks at your feet, sending warm runners of foam splashing
 around your ankles. The sand is smooth and damp, sprinkled with a
 profusion of shells, small stones, and clumps of seaweed.

 A huge and beautiful <span class="floydstyle em">sculpture</span> of a manta ray, carved from
 some clear crystal, sits on a track running into the waves.

 You can hike back up the beach in one of several directions: towards
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, towards the log <span class="floydstyle u1">cabin</span>, or towards
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> near the path. You could also wade out into the
 ocean <span class="floydstyle u1">waters</span>.

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> mutters something about "little ones" as he
 heads towards the beach near the rise, leaving the area.

>boulders

 If you mean the great round boulders, you're not sure where they ended
 up.

>water

 The waves are a good distance away, but the tide seems to be flowing
 back in.

 The sun hovers just west of the zenith, as if unsure whether it wants
 to start downward.

>lagoon

 The lagoon undeniably captivates the eye, aesthetically perfect in
 some indescribable way. Electric blue water far out to sea fades to a
 creamy neon turquoise as it enters the shallows of the bay, before
 crashing in long foamy runners of <span class="floydstyle em">surf</span> on the white sand
 beach which rims it. At one end of the bay, a rocky rise of black lava
 tumbles across the sand and into the water, forming a sharp boundary
 and a shocking contrast of color, while the other side is bounded by a
 lower point filled with tidepools and rounded boulders.

>bouldersf surf

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You used either a verb or a keyword I don't recognize, at least not</span>
 in that combination.

>surf

 The tide swells around you.

 A school of reddish-silver <span class="floydstyle em">fish</span> dart past your knees.

>fish

 The fish dart so quickly through the water that you can only catch
 glimpses.

>boulders

 You slosh your way towards the shore, push past the breakpoint where
 the gentle swells tumble over themselves into knee-high waves, and
 finally step back onto the sand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Boulders</span>
 The boulders stand stoically in the sunlight, their rounded tops
 faintly reflecting the blue of the sky.

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,
 baking in the sunlight.

 Sandy paths wander towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the beach
 opens up towards the edge of the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>. A bank of slippery
 stones stretches <span class="floydstyle u1">towards</span> the wet sand.

>point

 You weave through the boulder stand, clambering over a few shorter
 rocks here and there, and eventually break out onto a wet, rocky
 point.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tidepools</span>
 A rocky point ends here with a cluster of small <span class="floydstyle em">pools</span>, smooth
 mirrors of the sun above. From here the whole lagoon stretches out
 before you, from the <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span> in the center of the beach to the
 <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">volcano</span>, looming over either end.

 Dry land snakes back towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. There
 is no safe place to enter the ocean from here.

>pools

 Clinging precariously to every hollow and bowl in the jumbled rock,
 the pools are placid windows into a world of tiny darting
 <span class="floydstyle em">creatures</span> and surprising shades of color.

>creatures

 Bright orange starfish, tiny pastel minnows, and bulbous fingers of
 purple and maroon sea anemones: each tidepool is like a tiny aquarium.

>mountain

 The mountain is hazy blue with distance. It dominates one corner of
 the island, one side a sheer cliff face, the other tumbling
 treacherously into the sea. The rocky sides are black and smooth.

 The sky overhead is beginning to fill up with dark <span class="floydstyle em">clouds</span>.

>clouds

 They are flying in rapidly from the east, black and ominous.

>volcano

 Rising gracefully over the far end of the island, the reddish-brown
 slopes of a volcano shimmer in the distant heat haze. Faint wisps of
 steam rise from its hidden caldera. One whole side of the volcano
 seems to have crumbled in some past eruption, spewing forth the long
 black lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span> that bisects the island and forms the back
 wall of the lagoon.

 Dark thunderheads drag cold shadows across the island, gusts of
 sweet-smelling wind trailing behind.

>flow

 Now black and hardened, this lava flow sliced across the island
 decades or centuries ago, descending from the ruined cone of the
 volcano to the ocean near the rise.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tidepools</span>
 A rocky point ends here with a cluster of small <span class="floydstyle em">pools</span>,
 battered and churned by the relentless breaking of waves. From here
 the whole lagoon stretches out before you, from the <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span> in
 the center of the beach to the <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">volcano</span>,

 Dry land snakes back towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. There

>boulders

 You step carefully through the crashing surf back towards the beach,
 stepping around shrinking puddles soaking into the sand, until you
 find yourself among the boulders again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Boulders</span>
 The rounded boulders rise warm and wet in the sinking sun, smelling of
 sea-kissed stone.

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,
 wetted by the spray of the surf.

 Sandy paths wander back towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the
 beach opens up towards the edge of the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>. The tide
 crashes against a bank of low smooth stones running into the ocean.

>forest

 You leave the boulders behind and walk back to the smooth white sand
 of the beach.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Pristine white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> curves around the lagoon. The ocean
 stretches to the western horizon, under a grey sky streaked with fast
 moving <span class="floydstyle em">clouds</span>.

 The beach curves gently around the lagoon, stretching towards the
 distant rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, while disappearing closer at hand back
 into the stand of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. You could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span>
 into the lagoon, or follow a faint path <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> into dense
 vegetation.

>sand

 Startlingly bright, the beach is smooth and featureless, white curves
 unblemished by imperfections.

>rise

 You follow the sweeping curve of the beach about halfway around its
 edge, the dripping of moisture from the soaked vegetation around you
 making a gentle chorus.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The sand burns hot under your feet in the afternoon light, forcing you
 closer to the cool damp sand near the waves, and the black cliff of
 the lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span> silently absorbs the heat. Spotless white
 <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> stretches in a great arc around the lagoon.

 The beach stretches away back towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>
 or the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> into
 the lagoon. The cabin lies <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

>go up

 You clamber up the slipping sand past seaweed and shells at the
 high-water mark, then onto sturdier ground, before finally arriving at
 the building and stepping inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The white glow of the beach through the open door is brilliant; your
 eyes struggle to adjust to the dim interior of the cabin instead.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>
 (containing the sketchbook).

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to the brightly-lit <span class="floydstyle u1">studio</span>
 or to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">storage</span> room. You can also step back
 <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>box

 The box is a perfect cube, each side about the length of your forearm,
 carved from interlocking pieces of wood which fit together seamlessly
 without nails or mismatched joins. Intricate <span class="floydstyle em">carvings</span> cover
 every surface. Salt crusts the lower third, where the wood is swollen
 and discolored.

 The top of the cube has swung open, revealing a delicate
 <span class="floydstyle em">sketchbook</span>, seemingly undamaged.

>sketchbook

 You examine the sketchbook carefully, a beautiful handmade thing,
 thick paper pressed from some creamy-tan wood, the spiral binding a
 thin coil of copper-colored metal. On the cover is a handwritten
 <span class="floydstyle em">inscription</span>.

 You flip past several blank pages before reaching one last sketch on
 the notebook's final page, which seems to have been done much later
 than the others. It shows a man sitting watching the sun set over the
 ocean, his back turned and face invisible, holding the comb with the
 two leaping dolphins. The sketch is sloppy, almost careless, but still
 exudes a palpable sense of sadness and regret.

 The sketchbook is turned to the last page.

>inscription

 You recognize some of the letters from the clockwork head in the
 treehouse, but the message is still mostly incomprehensible.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 Sand drifts around the open doorway, spilling out in tiny dunes across
 the wooden floorboards disturbed only by your footsteps. Bare,
 water-stained walls frame a small room, empty and abandoned save for a
 manta ray <span class="floydstyle em">skeleton</span> hanging from one wall; some frayed ropes
 tied to one beam are the only other hint of past furnishings.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>

 You duck through the small doorway into a windowed porch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin, The Studio</span>
 High, narrow <span class="floydstyle em">windows</span> admit steep slants of daylight into the
 studio. The floor is stained with paint and clay, and artisan
 <span class="floydstyle em">tools</span> litter the surface of a wall-to-wall workbench, though
 everything seems to be under a layer of thick dust, as if undisturbed
 for years.

 On the rough plank walls on your left and right, exactly opposite each
 other, hang two spectacular <span class="floydstyle em">paintings</span>.

 The only exit is <span class="floydstyle u1">back</span> to the front room of the cabin.

>paintings

 Which do you mean, 1) the storybook village painting, or 2) the space
 painting?

>storybook

 You step up and study the incredible artistry again.

 A gently rolling hilltop of lemon-yellow and milky-white wildflowers,
 fantastically profuse, explodes from the surface of this painting. A
 large gathering of smiling people in simple clothes of brown and
 crimson pick the flowers, laughing and smiling: children, parents,
 aunts, grandmothers, all so richly detailed that you can almost hear
 them laughing and calling out to each other. The smell of dusty dry
 pigment somehow suggests the first day of spring, and fresh mountain
 breezes in a sea-blue sky. Beyond the hilltop a storybook village
 basks in late morning haze, thatched roofs and cobbles ringed by
 balding mountaintops, rounded and emerald green.

 Carved into the rough-hewn frame is a word in an unfamiliar language,
 though you recognize the symbols from the clockwork head in the
 treehouse: "e--el".

>space

 You step up and study the incredible artistry again.

 A huge translucent sphere hovers in the center of this painting, miles
 wide, reflecting in bulbous crescent the golden light of a warm gold
 and lemon yellow sun. Inside the sphere is a profusion of life: huge,
 gnarled trees growing in all directions without gravity to guide them;
 thick, mossy vines wrapped everywhere and stretching like tiny green
 threads of emerald through moist air; and people dressed in flowing
 silver-crimson gowns and wide sea-blue wings, gliding between gilded
 wooden villages high in the branches of the massive trunks. In the
 distance, more spheres can be seen, floating serenely amidst the jet
 black backdrop shining with a million milky stars.

 Carved into the rough-hewn frame is a word in an unfamiliar language,
 though you recognize some of the symbols from the clockwork head in

 The roof of the shack extends out beyond the unpaned windows,
 presumably to keep out rain but let in light. Through the windows you
 see the beach, and the black lava flow angling away into the distance.

 As you emerge, you see that a rain storm has blown in, waves of wind
 and water descending on the island in buckets.

 You step back outside into the rain, walking down the beach in the
 direction of the surf.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The ocean stretches to the western horizon, under a grey sky streaked
 with fast moving <span class="floydstyle em">clouds</span> dumping buckets of rain. Gleaming
 white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> curves around the lagoon.

 The beach stretches away towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span> or

 You walk down towards the breakers on dampening sand, water trickling
 down all around you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wading In the Lagoon</span>
 Rain falls, waves surge around your ankles, and thousands of tiny
 raindrop splashes surround you, ensuring a thorough soaking. At least
 it's warm water. The ocean stretches to the western horizon, under a
 grey sky streaked with fast moving <span class="floydstyle em">clouds</span> dumping buckets of
 rain.

 You can wade towards the beach in one of several directions: towards
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, towards the log <span class="floydstyle u1">cabin</span>, or towards
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> near the path. You could also wade farther out into
 the ocean <span class="floydstyle u1">waters</span>.

 You emerge from the shallow water and hike up the drying beach,
 resigned to getting totally soaked in the downpour, leaving the soft
 crash of the surf far behind.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>

>clouds

 Buckets of warm rain pour down from the black thunderheads above.

>path

 The forest has mostly reclaimed it, but you can see where a path was
 once cut through the trees here: moss-covered stumps and repositioned
 boulders mark a gently curving line through the vegetation. The path
 connects the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> with the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

 Lightning flashes and thunder rumbles as the storm continues.

 Stretching out before you is a breathtaking white sand <span class="floydstyle em">lagoon</span>

 languid half-moon curve around a shallow bay of deep, rich blue. The
 smell of the sea breeze on your face makes you smile.

 You walk back up the path and return to the shade of the forest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>
 Water dribbles down the fronds and bamboo stands around you, catching
 in tiny pools of leaves or sinking into the moss and turning it a
 deep, full green. The smell of rain and wet earth is thick in the air.

 The clearing is dominated by the withered <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, vine-wrapped
 trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves springing from
 sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined <span class="floydstyle em">nook</span>
 curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting the

>nap

 You can only take so many naps in one day, you know. Might as well
 make it to sunset.

 Rain buckets down in ceaseless torrents.

>forest

 Making slow progress, you venture deeper into the forest along the
 nearly-vanished path, ducking under vines and walking through
 knee-deep clusters of fallen leaves and dense ground cover. The ground
 slopes up to your left and down to your right, but you stay relatively
 level.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Big Tree, Beneath the Treehouse</span>
 As you step around the treehouse in the rain, studying its strange
 curves and patches, you suddenly stop in your tracks. The rain has
 altered the color and texture of its components, and as it falls and
 curves around the wooden rafters and beams it accentuates certain
 details and hides others. You take a step to the left and suddenly you
 see it.

 The treehouse is an achingly beautiful sculpture of a woman's face,
 drawn and haggard as in the last stages of some long illness which
 nevertheless cannot hide the charm of her appearance or character.
 Rain curves around the bulge in the wall that is her cheekbone, trails
 down the vines of her hair, and glistens in the specks of quartz that
 are the highlights in her eyes. But only when the light is flattened
 by overcast clouds, only when the rain soaks into the wood and turns
 it the hues of her face, and only standing just at the right spot, is
 she here.

 The rotting rope ladder leads <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> through the open doorway of
 the treehouse. The way back to the <span class="floydstyle u1">path</span> is open, and opposite
 that the forest gives way to open <span class="floydstyle u1">terrain</span> the way you came.

>path

 Cutting back along the route you found earlier, you wade through the
 forest undergrowth.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>

 finally emerge from the trees on some grassy mounds at the edge of a
 beach.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Pristine white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> stretches in a great arc around the

 <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span>, looking long-neglected but still intact. Pristine
 white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> curves around the lagoon.

 The beach stretches away towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span> or
 back to the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span>
 into the lagoon. The cabin lies <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span>, perched on a boulder, seems deep in thought.


>inventory

 You are wearing your traveling clothes and a compass.

 The rain peters out and the <span class="floydstyle em">clouds</span> begin to disperse.


>clouds

 The clouds are quickly being carried off westward, revealing a
 reddish-orange evening sky.


>go up

 You clamber up the slipping sand past seaweed and shells at the
 high-water mark, then onto sturdier ground, before finally arriving at
 the building and stepping inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The white glow of the beach through the open door is brilliant; your
 eyes struggle to adjust to the dim interior of the cabin instead.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>
 (containing the sketchbook).

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to the brightly-lit <span class="floydstyle u1">studio</span>
 or to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">storage</span> room. You can also step back
 <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>outside

 You step back outside into the sunlight, walking down the beach in the
 direction of the surf.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The sand burns hot under your feet in the afternoon light, forcing you
 closer to the cool damp sand near the waves, and the black cliff of
 the lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span> silently absorbs the heat. Spotless white
 <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> stretches in a great arc around the lagoon.

 The beach stretches away towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span> or
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> into the
 lagoon. The cabin lies back <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span>, perched on a boulder, seems deep in thought.

 The strange man gets to his feet, stretches, and glances around him,
 bemused.


>flow

 The black rock, frozen in mid-tumble, hosts a few tentative green
 shoots and flowers in its maze of nooks and crannies, but the
 vegetation has only begun to reclaim it.

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> whistles quietly to himself as he heads
 towards the beach near the rise, leaving the vicinity.

>man

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> seems to be on his way somewhere.

 Some distance away, you glimpse the strange man making his way from
 the beach near the rise to the top of the rise.

>beach

 Startlingly bright, the beach is smooth and featureless, white curves
 unblemished by imperfections.

 In the distance by the top of the rise, you notice the strange
 <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> moving out of sight.

>rise

 You amble along the soft white sand of the beach, working your way
 around the edge of the bay.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Rise</span>
 The huge piece of driftwood is dark and dripping with moisture in the
 aftermath of the storm. Pristine white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span> curves around the
 lagoon.

 Opposite the lagoon, the beach is pinched off by black cliffs, but
 near the tide is the route to the top of the <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>. Sand
 stretches back back towards the <span class="floydstyle u1">center</span> of the beach, and you
 could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> into the lagoon.

 Topics: dodge, and problem
 You can also say <span class="floydstyle u2">nothing</span>, <span class="floydstyle u2">goodbye</span>, or change the
 <span class="floydstyle u2">subject</span>.


 You clamber easily over the ancient lava rock, worn smooth by pounding
 surf, till you stand on top.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Old Lava Flow</span>
 Rain pools in tiny puddles and depressions atop the lava flow, slowly
 evaporating in the warm afternoon light.

 From here, you could scramble back down to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> or take
 an easier route down the other side of the flow towards the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">edge</span> of the marsh. You can also hear the sound of a
 <span class="floydstyle u1">waterfall</span> through some heavy fronds opposite the sea.

 Some distance away, you see the strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> heading from the
 edge of the marshlands to the marshlands by the spire.

 Suddenly the strange man barrels towards you, balancing a huge armful
 of konokuk fruits and heading for the path down the rise. "Look out!"
 he shouts, "coming through!" If you don't <span class="floydstyle u2">dodge</span>, he's going
 to have a <span class="floydstyle u2">problem</span>.

>dodge


 You jump to one side, only just keeping your balance on the edge of
 the lava flow, as Progue tumbles down the path, barely but somehow
 managing to keep the fruits balanced. "Close as close!" he shouts
 back, "thanks!" and is gone.

 <span class="floydstyle u1">waterfall</span> through some heavy fronds opposite the sea.

>waterfall

 You push great leafy fronds out of the way, shivering as water drips
 all over you, and after a few moments break into a secluded grove.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hidden Pool</span>
 Tucked away in a natural bowl stained with sea-blue hues, hidden from
 view, this beautiful <span class="floydstyle em">pool</span> is fed by a clear
 <span class="floydstyle em">waterfall</span> cascading down from an overhang above. Steam rises
 from the almost perfectly circular pool, which looks deep enough for
 diving but not so deep that the blue-tinted floor is not visible, and
 leafy green fronds sway gently on all sides, creating a secluded and
 relaxing ambiance.

 A rich vein of crumbling sea-blue <span class="floydstyle em">crystal</span> runs through the
 wall behind the waterfall, staining the rock face and water of the
 pool a brilliant indigo.

 A <span class="floydstyle u1">gap</span> in the trees marks the way back to the open.

>crystal

 Some rich vein of a brilliant sea-blue crystal slices diagonally
 through the rock here, brought up to the surface from unfathomed
 depths by some past volcanic action. The crystal seems inclined to
 break along hexagonal lines, producing the effect of crumbled
 six-sided pillars. The pounding action of the waterfall has softened
 the edges, and in turn stained the whole wall and tinted the pool
 below a brilliant indigo.

 It's the precise shade of Rume's eyes.

>pool

 Tinted with hues of green, the surface of this round pool constantly
 shifts and dances as the waterfall plunges from a mossy overhang. The
 pool looks deep enough for diving under the churning falls, but
 shallows near the far end to a jumble of good sitting rocks a few feet
 below the surface. The water is hot and steaming, simultaneously
 warmed by some scalding source below and cooled by the waterfall.

>waterfall

 Stretching about twice your height above the surface of the pool, the
 waterfall cascades over a natural overhang in the rock, sparkling
 brightly in the sun overhead. Behind and alongside the waterfall,
 lumpy nodes of sea-blue <span class="floydstyle em">crystal</span> poke out of the rocky earth.

 In the distance, by the beach near the boulders, you spot the strange

>edge

 You follow the path down a slight mossy slope slick with rainwater,
 enjoying the unobstructed panorama before you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Stumps</span>
 Insects drift lazily through the sunbeams over the stumps, washed with
 the summery rays of the afternoon sun.

 Jutting from the rock near the short drop-off to the sea is a
 roughly-hewn <span class="floydstyle em">block</span> of grey stone.

 Far across the marsh <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> a soggy slope is the sheer cliff
 face of the mountain. You could also follow the drier stretch back
 <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the rise or over to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">shack</span> at the base of
 the ropeway.

>bloack

 (retrying as if you'd typed "block.")

 The stone seems to be part of a spire that once rose here, of some
 natural material that erodes more slowly than the surrounding rock.
 The part jutting up out of the earth has been roughly hacked into a
 block large enough to stand inside, were it hollow.

 Ragged shadows crawl down the sharp slope of the mountain, a ways off,
 as fast-moving clouds cover and hide the sun.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Stumps</span>
 The remains of what once must have been a small copse of trees on this
 bit of grassy land overlook the edge of the marsh. Across the marsh
 rises the sheer cliff, rising to the summit of the mountain.

 The rain clouds are dissolving in the late afternoon sunlight.

>shack

 Keeping the marsh on your right and a bluff overlooking the sea to
 your left, you approach a low mound at the corner of the island,
 topped by the shack.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ropeway Base Station</span>
 A <span class="floydstyle em">snail</span> with a pearly-white shell inches along the ground.

 The ropeway <span class="floydstyle em">mechanism</span> is motionless, no steam flowing from
 the outlet vent poking through the structure's roof. The
 <span class="floydstyle em">crate</span> hangs from the cables, swaying gently in the breeze.

 The only promising route leads back towards the <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>.

>snail

 The shell is a rich, luminous white, faintly iridescent, that seems to
 almost glow in the sun.

>mechanism

 The mechanism is complex yet elegant. A quartz pressure <span class="floydstyle em">gauge</span>
 marks the spot where a faded blue bamboo <span class="floydstyle em">pipe</span>, stretching
 half-buried in a line towards the stumps, joins the main mechanism,
 which is topped by an outflow <span class="floydstyle em">tube</span>. An exquisitely carved
 wood piston drives a system of pulleys, flywheels, and counterweights
 that connect to two thick <span class="floydstyle em">cables</span> rising up to the mountain's
 summit. A large wood <span class="floydstyle em">lever</span> is the only visible control.

>pipe

 Once coated in now-flaking paint, the pipe, about as wide as your
 fist, is made from thick pieces of bamboo sealed together with vines
 coated with sticky tar.

 The blue pipe, arriving from the direction of the <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>,
 emerges from the ground running parallel to it, then twists up ninety
 degrees at the shack and connects to the ropeway mechanism via a
 transparent quartz <span class="floydstyle em">gauge</span>.

 A <span class="floydstyle em">snail</span> with a pearly-white shell inches along the ground.

 You walk back along the edge of the marsh toward the stumps, the

 the summery rays of the evening sun.

 Far across the marsh <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> a soggy slope is the sheer cliff
 face of the mountain. You could also follow the drier stretch
 <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the rise or back over to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">shack</span> at the
 base of the ropeway.

>go down

 You walk down a slight slope into boggier terrain, entering a long
 flat marsh that eventually merges with the ocean off in the distance.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of the Marsh</span>
 Hot mist hangs like a physical presence over the soaking marshlands,
 as if the tiniest disturbance would cause the evaporating moisture to
 start falling again. A large, craggy <span class="floydstyle em">mountain</span> looms up into
 the clouds, a ways off.

 You could return from here to higher ground, the drier area near the
 tree <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>, or slog through more marsh towards a craggy
 <span class="floydstyle u1">spire</span> or, farther off, the <span class="floydstyle u1">foot</span> of the mountain.

>spire

 (new <span class="floydstyle u1">landmark</span> discovered)
 Hopping from one clump of dry grass to another, you navigate the
 swampy maze to the vicinity of the rocky spire.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marsh, Near the Spire</span>
 A lone <span class="floydstyle em">spire</span> of rock reaches from the muck into the sky,
 about three times your height. Affixed to its top is a wooden pole,
 the sole support of the ropeway <span class="floydstyle em">cable</span> on its long climb up
 the mountain.

 Farther afield, the <span class="floydstyle u1">foot</span> of the mountain rises abruptly from
 the muck, while in the opposite direction the marsh continues towards
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>.

>spire

 A great splinter of rock that must have fallen from the shattered
 mountain long ago rises at a slightly crooked angle from the marsh
 like a giant's bony finger.

 Several faint <span class="floydstyle em">drawings</span> in chalk, faded to near invisibility,
 adorn the base of the spire.

>drawings

 You kneel to study the drawings more closely. The simple subjects
 suggest the work of a small child, but still show some skill: a
 rendering of a bulbous frog captures the creature's awkward grace, and
 another of two dragonflies twirling around each other in flight shows
 remarkable details in the delicate wings. One large sketch shows two
 girls holding hands, backs turned, skipping along a beach.

 Below the drawings is drawn some <span class="floydstyle em">writing</span> in a simple, awkward
 hand.

>writing

 You recognize some of the letters from the clockwork head in the
 treehouse, but the message is still mostly incomprehensible.

 Farther afield, the <span class="floydstyle u1">foot</span> of the mountain rises abruptly from
 the muck, while in the opposite direction the marsh continues towards
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>.

 The sun sinks through the westward sky, slowly burning towards the
 shades of evening.

>foot

 You pick your way carefully through the marsh towards the cliff face.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marsh, Near the Cliff</span>
 Hot mist hangs like a physical presence over the soaking marshlands,
 as if the tiniest disturbance would cause the evaporating moisture to
 start falling again. But the marsh ends abruptly here at a sheer
 <span class="floydstyle em">cliff</span> face, the edge of the imposing mountain.

 The marsh stretches away from the mountain towards the lonely
 <span class="floydstyle u1">spire</span> and the distant <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>.

>cliff

 The cliff rises straight up out of the marsh in a vertiginous climb to
 the summit, as if in some past geologic epoch half the mountain split
 and sunk into the sea. Indeed, a deep <span class="floydstyle em">crack</span> runs nearly
 straight up from here, harbinger perhaps of further destruction.

>crack

 About the width of your outstretched hand, the crack runs nearly
 vertically up the side of the cliff.

>climb climb

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">I couldn't understand that, or the noun you used isn't nearby.</span>


>climb crack

 You feel the edge of the crack experimentally for handholds. It
 wouldn't be easy, but you might be able to climb the crack up, at
 least a little ways.

 Late afternoon gives way to evening as the sun sinks lower in the
 western sky.

>go up

 Flexing your hands, you step anxiously up to the crack, set your first
 handholds, and begin to climb. The ascent is not easy, but you make
 quick progress, and before you know it you have followed the crack all
 the way up to a small ledge, some distance above the marsh below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ledge</span>
 No more than a few paces across, this tiny ledge in the cliff face
 offers a vantage of the marshlands stretching back to the coast, the
 chairlift cables arcing high above them, and the lagoon, just visible
 over the edge of the distant lava flow.

 Strewn about the ledge are a variety of <span class="floydstyle em">nicknacks</span> that, along
 with a simple <span class="floydstyle em">bed</span> of palm fronds, make it immediately obvious
 somebody has made this ledge a sort of home.

 The <span class="floydstyle em">crack</span> goes right through the ledge, bisecting it into two
 neat halves, before continuing both up and down the slope.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Water</span> ripples down both sides from somewhere high above,
 before vanishing into smaller cracks at your feet.

>nicknacks

 Mostly junk: small piles of sea shells, scattered fish bones and
 broken crab legs, bits of rope of various sizes woven from coconut
 husks, and the like. Buried among the remains, however, you do notice
 a small <span class="floydstyle em">pendant</span> on a leather chain.

>pendant

 Just a small stone on a leather chain that can be worn around the
 neck. It seems well-worn, as if it has been rubbed nearly to
 smoothness over years.

>bed

 The fronds could do with replacing: they are rotting and the smell is
 most unpleasant. It certainly doesn't look like a very comfortable
 place to sleep.

>water

 The water, coming down in hot steaming curtains, is enough to wet the
 crack completely and form a base for moss and slime to grow.

>go up

 The <span class="floydstyle em">crack</span> steepens here and <span class="floydstyle em">water</span> ripples down from
 somewhere above. It looks like climbing farther will be more
 difficult.

>go down

 Nervously, you lower your feet back over the edge, gripping your
 handholds tightly. It seems to be a long descent, the marsh spinning
 dizzily far beneath your feet each time you glance down for footholds,
 but slowly it gets closer and closer. When you finally hop the last
 few feet down, the muck of the marsh is good to feel beneath your
 feet.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marsh, Near the Cliff</span>
 Hot mist hangs like a physical presence over the soaking marshlands,
 as if the tiniest disturbance would cause the evaporating moisture to
 start falling again. But the marsh ends abruptly here at a sheer
 <span class="floydstyle em">cliff</span> face, the edge of the imposing mountain.

 The marsh stretches away from the mountain towards the lonely
 <span class="floydstyle u1">spire</span> and the distant <span class="floydstyle u1">stumps</span>.

 You find a path through the wet salty bog to the edge of the marsh.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of the Marsh</span>

 Roughly coffin-shaped, the open crate is scratched and nicked all over
 the inside, where ghosts of sawdust and grime still linger. A

 Climbing back up onto the old lava flow, you once again reach the
 viewpoint from its top.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Old Lava Flow</span>
 Black shadows play over black lava in a visual cacophony as the
 slanting light throws the flow into sharp relief.

 From here, you could scramble down to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> or take an
 easier route back down the other side of the flow towards the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">edge</span> of the marsh. The hidden <span class="floydstyle u1">pool</span> lies through some
 heavy fronds opposite the sea.

 Some distance away, in the lagoon, you glimpse the strange man,
 swimming.

>beach

 You pick your way carefully down the cluster of slippery boulders,
 using handholds to steady yourself, till your feet touch the smooth
 wet sand again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Rise</span>
 Tall, swaying <span class="floydstyle em">trees</span> -- what the strange man called "konokuk"
 trees, you remember --  rise above you. Gleaming white <span class="floydstyle em">sand</span>
 curves around the lagoon.

 Opposite the lagoon, the beach is pinched off by black cliffs, but

 A wave slowly breaks up the shallow lagoon, sending an undulating line

 The knobby brown trunks of the konokuk trees curve gently up to a
 cluster of leafy fronds and hairy brown <span class="floydstyle em">fruits</span> well above
 your head.

 A wave slowly breaks up the shallow lagoon, sending an undulating line

 up. It's hard work. Sweat ripples your face and your hands become
 tender and slippery. But finally you reach the top of the tree, within
 touching distance of the hairy brown <span class="floydstyle em">fruits</span>. You manage to
 knock a few loose, before returning to the ground and picking bits of
 bark from your roughened hands tenderly.

 The <span class="floydstyle em">sun</span> touches the horizon, sinking slowly into the sea in a
 fiery red spectacle.

 You heft one of the head-sized fruits in your hands, but decide you

 carrying it around.

 A gull picks at its feathers with its beak before letting out a loud
 call.

 These seem larger and more streamlined than most you've seen, and
 their long yellow beaks are tipped with a vivid indigo rather than
 red. But their cries sound just as you'd expect.

 You crack one of the fruits open with little effort, revealing a firm
 pink-white pulp and some gooey clear liquid inside.

 The twilit sky loses more and more of its vibrant colors as the sky
 falls slowly into night above.

 You crack one of the fruits open with little effort, revealing a firm

 the colors of the lagoon are slowly fading in the dimming light,
 framed by the rustling of tropical <span class="floydstyle em">trees</span>, their green fronds
 casting welcome shadows across the sand. The stillness of the great
 crescent <span class="floydstyle em">beach</span> is magical in the half-light; the whole
 expanse curving out before you quietly breathtaking.

 Opposite the lagoon, the beach is pinched off by black cliffs, but
 near the tide is the route back to the top of the <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>. Sand
 stretches back towards the <span class="floydstyle u1">center</span> of the beach, and you could
 also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> into the lagoon.

>beach

 Almost glowing in the faint light, the beach is smooth and
 featureless, white curves unblemished by imperfections.

>center

 You follow the gentle curve of the white sand beach back around till
 you near its center, watching the sky darken from moment to moment as
 the daylight drains away.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The sky and the colors of the lagoon are slowly fading in the dimming
 light. The stillness of the great crescent <span class="floydstyle em">beach</span> is magical
 in the half-light; the whole expanse curving out before you quietly
 breathtaking.

 The beach stretches away towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span> or
 back to the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span>
 into the lagoon. The cabin lies <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

>go up

 You clamber up the slipping sand past seaweed and shells at the
 high-water mark, then onto sturdier ground, before finally arriving at
 the building and stepping inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The cabin's front room is gloomy and indistinct in the dim light that
 filters from outside, still as a tomb.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>
 (containing the sketchbook).

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to the dim interior of the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">studio</span> or to the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">storage</span> room. You can also
 step back <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>storage

 You step through the doorway into a smaller room at the rear of the
 cabin.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin, Back Room</span>
 Hardly any light filters into this windowless back room. Shapes are
 jumbled and indistinct.

 A wide crack in the smoothed wall is filled in by cobblestones near
 the ceiling, and a thick wooden <span class="floydstyle em">door</span> below.

 Other than the door and a pile of smashed wood splinters in a corner,
 the only notable feature is the <span class="floydstyle u1">exit</span> back to the front room.

>buttons

 Each is a circle about the size of one made with a thumb and finger,
 flush with the door but very slightly convex. Stylized symbols are
 inlaid into each one. From left to right, the symbols are
 <span class="floydstyle em">whale</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">manta</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">turtle</span>,
 <span class="floydstyle em">crab</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">crystal</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">berry</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">seagull</span>,
 <span class="floydstyle em">bee</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">spider</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">mussel</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">snail</span>.

>push spider

 With a gentle snick, the button depresses into the door, then pops
 back out as you release it.

>push snail

 With a gentle snick, the button depresses into the door, then pops
 back out as you release it.

>push crystal

 With a gentle snick, the button depresses into the door, then pops
 back out as you release it.

>push mussel

 With a gentle snick, the button depresses into the door, then pops
 back out as you release it.

>open door

 You can't see any obvious way to open it: no knob or handle, just the
 row of <span class="floydstyle em">buttons</span> and the bands of <span class="floydstyle em">color</span>.

>color

 It's too dark to make out any details.

>sleep

 You're not going to sleep very well on these old warped boards.

 The leafy nook at the foot of the tree you painted to reach this place
 springs to mind. It might be comfortable enough for sleep.

>out

 You step back into the cabin's larger front room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The cabin is black in the moonless night, only the dimmest traces of
 starlight spilling in through the open doorway.

 The room's sole other feature is the open wooden <span class="floydstyle em">box</span>
 (containing the sketchbook).

 Two smaller interior doorways lead to the dark <span class="floydstyle u1">studio</span> or to
 the tiny <span class="floydstyle u1">storage</span> room. You can also step back
 <span class="floydstyle u1">outside</span>.

>out

 Stepping outside, you discover that the sun has set and the light has
 gone, leaving you in the black of night.

 You step back outside into the night, walking down the beach in the
 direction of the surf.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The log <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span> is barely distinct in the darkness, almost
 swallowed up by the looming lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span> behind it. The
 undulating white sand <span class="floydstyle em">beach</span> is dim and indistinct under the
 stars, the border between ground and sky defined by the sound of the
 runners of foamy surf reaching almost to your feet.

 The beach stretches away towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span> or
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> into the
 lagoon. The cabin lies back <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

 Gazing up at the sky, you pause for a moment in wonder. Spanning the
 horizon is a fantastic sight-- a silver-orange <span class="floydstyle em">galaxy</span>,
 glimmering in the night like some vision. You've seen countless night
 skies in your travels, but this certainly counts as one of the most
 spectacular.

 The last of the light has faded from the sky, leaving only a rich
 black sky studded with millions of stars and a great swirling
 <span class="floydstyle em">galaxy</span>.

 Far out in the lagoon, bobbing and weaving slowly just under the
 surface of the water, are dozens of pale <span class="floydstyle em">lights</span>, glowing
 eerily in the darkness.

>galaxy

 Stretching nearly from horizon to horizon, the galaxy is rich with a
 million tiny dots finer than dust grains, streaked through with every
 shade of orange-tinted silver you can imagine.

>lights

 Spread out all across the lagoon, under the surface of the water, are
 dozens of faint, pale glows, bobbing and weaving slowly across the
 bay. From here on the land, you're too far away to tell what they are.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>
 The beach widens here in the middle of its sweeping curve around the
 lagoon, rising in graceful white dunes to the sudden black slope of
 the old lava <span class="floydstyle em">flow</span>. Up against the flow is built a log
 <span class="floydstyle em">cabin</span>, looking long-neglected but still intact. Foamy
 breakers lap the shore before you, unbroken save for your own
 footsteps.

 The beach stretches away towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span> or
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, or you could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> into the
 lagoon. The cabin lies back <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> the beach.

>go down

 You walk down towards the breakers on dampening sand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wading In the Lagoon</span>
 The warm water of the lagoon laps quietly at your ankles, faint
 twinkles of the stars and galaxy above mingling with hints of foam.
 Caught between rolling black velvet and the arching black sky, you
 feel strange and unreal. Pale <span class="floydstyle em">lights</span> weave and bob through
 the waters of the lagoon.

 You can wade towards the beach in one of several directions: towards
 the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">rise</span>, towards the log <span class="floydstyle u1">cabin</span>, or towards
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> near the path. You could also wade farther out into

 quite far before the water climbs past your knees.

 Short of swimming out to the ocean, the only real places to go are
 back to the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span>, or scrambling up towards the rounded

 The strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> is a few swells away, bobbing lazily as he
 floats on his back, eyes closed.

 "Happy night," he says, looking up and scissoring his arms gently at
 his sides. He frowns, noticing the pendant around your neck.

 "Hey now," he says, "that's mine. Give that back." He reaches out his
 hand to take it; you could <span class="floydstyle u2">prevent</span> him or let him

 the ocean <span class="floydstyle u1">waters</span>.

>beach

 You emerge from the shallow water and hike up the drying beach leaving
 the soft crash of the surf far behind.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Path</span>
 Foamy breakers lap the shore before you, dotted with myriad tiny
 shells and pieces of wood. Pale <span class="floydstyle em">lights</span> weave and bob through
 the waters of the lagoon.

 The beach curves gently around the lagoon, vanishing into
 <span class="floydstyle u1">darkness</span>, while disappearing closer at hand into the stand of
 <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. You could also wade <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> into the lagoon,
 or follow a faint path <span class="floydstyle u1">up</span> into shadowy vegetation.

 In the distance, you spot the strange <span class="floydstyle em">man</span> ambling from the
 lagoon to the shore.

 You follow the sweeping curve of the beach about halfway around its
 edge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach, Near the Abandoned Cabin</span>

 You slosh your way towards the shore, push past the breakpoint where
 the gentle swells tumble over themselves into knee-high waves, and
 finally step back onto the sand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Among the Boulders</span>
 The boulders rise from the sand in a confusion of curved shapes, great
 black eggs blotting out the stars on all sides.

 Small green <span class="floydstyle em">mussels</span> cling to the lower edges of the boulders,
 wetted by the spray of the surf.

 Sandy paths wander towards the rocky <span class="floydstyle u1">point</span>, while the beach
 opens up towards the edge of the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>. The tide crashes
 against a bank of low smooth stones running back into the ocean.

>point

 You weave through the boulder stand, clambering over a few shorter
 rocks here and there, and eventually break out onto a wet, rocky
 point.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tidepools</span>
 A rocky point ends here with a cluster of small <span class="floydstyle em">pools</span>,
 battered and churned by the relentless breaking of waves.

 Dry land snakes back towards the cluster of <span class="floydstyle u1">boulders</span>. There
 is no safe place to enter the ocean from here.

 Clinging precariously to every hollow and bowl in the jumbled rock,
 the pools are rimmed with clumps of drying foam, their surfaces
 disturbed every few minutes by rogue waves.

 You step carefully through the crashing surf back towards the beach,
 only the faint light of the stars above showing your way, until you
 find yourself among the boulders again.

>path

 The forest has mostly reclaimed it, but you can see where a path was
 once cut through the trees here: moss-covered stumps and repositioned
 boulders mark a gently curving line through the vegetation. The path
 connects the <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> with the <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

 Stretching out before you is a breathtaking white sand <span class="floydstyle em">lagoon</span>
 framed by a cliff of jet-black lava, the glimmering beach forming a
 languid half-moon curve around a shallow bay of deep, rich blue. The
 smell of the sea breeze on your face makes you smile.

 You walk back up the path and return to the black interior of the
 forest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Path</span>
 You can smell and hear the foliage around you more than you can see
 it: the smell of cool earth and growing things, and the sounds of leaf
 rubbing against leaf.

 The clearing is dominated by the withered <span class="floydstyle em">tree</span>, vine-wrapped
 trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves springing from
 sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined <span class="floydstyle em">nook</span>
 curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.

 Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a
 path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">beach</span> with the deeper <span class="floydstyle u1">forest</span>.

>sleep

 You lie down on the bed of leaves, comfortably anchored between the
 two tree roots, and rest comfortably on your back, looking up into the
 sea of dancing lemon-yellow leaves above you.

 Lulled by the rustling of the leaves above and the quiet sigh of the
 tree, you drift into a deep, bottomless sleep.

 The fire roars, stoked high with fresh-chopped wood, its bass growl

 The front <span class="floydstyle u1">door</span> of the lodge is shut tight. Vague premonitions

 One <span class="floydstyle em">canvas</span> remains, huge, suspended in the center of the room

 Written immaculately in dark ink on the inside, in a fine, cursive

 You feel a faint surge of sentience from the presences, somewhere

 one that you haven't dreamt under before. Otherwise they cannot learn.
 Each tree helps reveal a different face of your mind... their minds?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">~-~-~inside the volcano~-~-~</span>
 You stand in the center of some huge cavern, miles below the island in
 the fiery roots of the volcano. Waterfalls of lava and explosions of
 steam fill the superheated air with deep red glows and burning chaos.
 Strange shadows dance on the walls, that sometimes remind you of a row
 of glass dolls and sometimes look like stacks of fur hides. From your
 precarious ledge there is no sane way up or down, except perhaps for a
 dark <span class="floydstyle em">hole</span> near your feet spouting breaths of sulfuric steam.

 A river of <span class="floydstyle em">lava</span> churns slowly past you, bubbling and steaming
 like an ancient fire demon, real and alive.

>lava

 The surface of the lava twitches and dances, fragments of black
 dissolving into cracks of red, yellow, and gold, which slowly fade
 again to blackness. But as you watch the process speeds up, faster and
 faster, until it becomes a multihued blur of fire, so complex you
 almost think you can see <span class="floydstyle u1">patterns</span> in the chaos.

 Something tickles the back of your neck, as if someone stands next to
 you. When you turn to look there is nothing, but the feeling of
 <span class="floydstyle em">presence</span> lingers, strengthens.

>presence

 The presence is satisfied. You do wish to listen, to hear and learn
 more. You sense it gather itself, concentration crinkling the ridges
 of thought as it tries with smoldering intensity to communicate.

 Slowly, a concept takes place in your mind, like a long-forgotten word
 on the tip of your tongue, before finally breaking through, and as
 soon as it does you sense its truth.

 There is not one presence, but <span class="floydstyle em">many</span>.

>patterns

 Everything but the presence has become faded and grey for the moment.

 Now that you concentrate it seems obvious: yes, many minds, many small
 whispers, each distinct, but speaking together, all collaborating in
 their attempt to reach you. A handful are nearby, but behind them are
 the shadows of countless more, and some hidden sense suggests that
 distance is very far indeed.

>many

 It is so terribly slow, this communication, but another concept begins
 to come to you, a bubble rising through cold molasses.

 These minds speak to each other in the same way they speak to you. The
 reason it is so difficult to reach you is that...

 No, you can't quite grasp it. It's too hard. As if their minds are so
 different from yours that even the simplest...

 Ah. That's it. That's it exactly. Only in dreams, when your mind is
 open to the slightest hint of suggestion, can they reach you now.
 Slowly your mind and theirs are learning to sense each other, to
 communicate.

>look

 Everything but the presence has become faded and grey for the moment.

 And slowly you become aware of something else. These minds exist only
 as minds, in some abstract civilization of pure thought. The first one
 like you they tried to reach...

 The first?

 But already the minds fade, and moments later, they are gone.

 A river of <span class="floydstyle em">lava</span> churns slowly past you, bubbling and steaming
 like an ancient fire demon, real and alive.

 On a nearby wall of polished black lava, you notice the steam
 coalescing into strange <span class="floydstyle em">shapes</span>.

>shapes

 As you stare at the shapes, you realize the steam is condensing onto
 the black surface in the shape of <span class="floydstyle em">letters</span>, some script
 unknown to you, but strangely you find you can understand it.

>letters

 You step closer and read the message:

 <span class="floydstyle em">What? Yes, we're transmitting. Shh. Hello? Ah. Fantastic. The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Beast still works after all these years, it would seem. Well, there's</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">not much time. We can only hack the signal for so long before... but</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">listen to me, dithering. Greetings. Sincerest of greetings, whoever</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you are.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Let me be brief. These dreams you're having are dangerous. Don't</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">believe everything you hear and see. There may be, well, motives at</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">play, ulterior and otherwise. They may not have your best interests in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">mind.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Don't trust them. They've been using people like you for thousands</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of years. Yes, yes, who are "they" and all that... there's no time to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">get into details, but soon we'll be able</span>

 You watch for a long moment, but no further letters appear.

>hole

 The hole, just wide enough for you to enter, heads steeply
 <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> and immediately vanishes into solid black heat.

>patterns

 Despite the heat, you find yourself drawn closer and closer to the
 lava. The patterns become more and more distinct. You reach out a hand
 and suddenly they pull you in, under the surface, heat stabbing into
 your eyes and straight back into your memory...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">{-(* Big  Tree,  In  The  Branches *)-}</span>
 The hammer in your hand sends jolts up your arm as you pound the next
 board carefully into place. The <span class="floydstyle em">treehouse</span> is slowly taking
 shape around you, and not even an afternoon rain shower will keep you
 from finishing it. A place for the girls to come for a span, when they
 need time alone. Or you do.

 Around you, water drips down from leaves, the remnants of the rain
 shower, and wet breezes rustle the yellow leaves of the
 <span class="floydstyle em">windsigh</span>, harmonic tones singing something strange, and so
 much the pleasant. No, this <span class="floydstyle em">island</span> is not what you trickling
 expected. But mayhaps you and the couplets can find healing here.


 The <span class="floydstyle em">girls</span> are playing some game down on the ground, dimly
 visible through the branches and yellow leaves.

>girls

 Your daughters are on the ground beneath you, playing quietly near the
 writhing roots of the windsigh. You wish you could hear them laugh
 again, like they used to before you came here.

 Phoebe   {(*<span class="floydstyle u1">phoebe</span>*)}   and Lethe   {(*<span class="floydstyle u1">lethe</span>*)}  --
 your beautiful girls. And now when you look all you see is their
 mother.

>treehouse

 You have always thought and membered with your hands. In the past few
 weeks it is as if you've been trying to drown out all other thoughts:
 first the cabin, then the safety door, now this treehouse. And you
 have. Drowned them out. So far.

>phoebe

        {(*Progue*)(*your daughter Phoebe*)}|{(*Phoebe*)(*dad*)}

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">{-(* Underneath  The  Big  Tree *)-}</span>
 You are lost in thought, lying on your back on a carpet of wet leaves,
 watching hundreds of water droplets fall from them towards and around
 you, imagining you are floating through space, some infinite
 lemon-yellow space. You are not thinking about mother, for a change,
 or about your friends and house and school that you'll never see
 again. It's just that lying in this spot, letting your mind wander,
 you find a strange sensation sometimes creeps over you. Like someone
 trying very hard to speak to you, only they don't know how to talk.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Dad</span> is up in the tree working on the stupid treehouse, and
 your <span class="floydstyle em">sister</span> fidgets restlessly near the path <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to
 the beach.

 Lying abandoned on its side near the base of the tree is the old
 teaching <span class="floydstyle em">head</span>.

>head

 Dad keeps telling you to take better care of it. It's one of the few
 things that came with you when you came here, since dad made it, you
 guess. You and Laylay both learned your letters years ago, so it
 doesn't get much use any more.

>lethe

        {(*Phoebe*)(*Laylay*)}|{(*Lethe*)(*your sister Phoebe*)}

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">{-(* Underneath  The  Big  Tree *)-}</span>
 Your sister doesn't want to do anything, and you're getting bored,
 watching the rain spiral down the windsigh as you try to decide what
 to do next. You can't really go exploring without Phoebe, and dad
 won't let you go swimming alone either, and it's too rainy to go
 <span class="floydstyle u1">down</span> to the beach. You hate this place sometimes. You wish
 mom were here.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Dad</span> is up in the branches above, still working on your
 treehouse, and your <span class="floydstyle em">sister</span> is lying on the ground nearby,
 pretending to ignore you.

>dad

 Your daddy  {(*<span class="floydstyle u1">progue</span>*)}  tries so hard to make you and
 Phoebe feel loved, but you know something you will never tell either
 of them. He loved mom more than either of you, and always will.

 It's a good tree for a treehouse.
