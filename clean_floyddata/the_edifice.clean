 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Life is pretty routine. Search for Food. Eat it. Hide from Enemies.
 Ignore the Others. Then one day, you notice a staggeringly tall
 Edifice, right here in the middle of the forest. Has it been here
 before?

 At the Edifice
 Here, in the forest where you have spent your entire life, stands a
 huge Edifice, reaching into the clouds high above you.

 The Others are here, doing typically boring things.

 Though you can't see them, you sense your Enemies lurk nearby.

 You can also see Rock here.

>examine me
 You are well adapted to your environment. Your long arms and legs allow
 you to easily climb and swing in trees; your fur makes it easier to
 withstand the occasional cold night. Your colleagues seem to think your
 opposable thumbs make you look funny, which is why you spend so much
 time alone, but all in all, they've worked out pretty well.

>examine rock
 It's a rock. Unlike the Edifice, easily ignorable.

>take rock
 Taken.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 pick up an inedible object.

>bring sun
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>eat rock
 If you thought you were finding food when you picked this up, you were
 sadly mistaken.

>throw rock at others
 The Others avoid Rock easily, but watch you more warily.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 toss the rock.

>push rock
 Nothing obvious happens.

>examine enemies
 Your Enemies have sharp teeth, and would like nothing better than to
 eat you!
>get rock

 Taken.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 pick up an inedible object.

>wear rock
 You can't wear that!

 Here, in the forest where you have spent your entire life, stands a
 huge Edifice, reaching into the clouds high above you.

 The Others are here, doing typically boring things.

 Though you can't see them, you sense your Enemies lurk nearby.

 The Edifice towers above you, shooting up through the trees of the
 forest. It is completely smooth, apart from some irregularities above a
 tall, shallow rectangular recess, carved into the stone. You don't
 remember seeing it here before today, but, then again, it's not food
 and it doesn't seem dangerous.

 A distant howl sends a chill down your spine.

>examine clouds
 You can't see any such thing.

>climb edifice
 The walls are much too smooth.

>examine recess
 The recess is slightly larger than you, and is flush with the ground at
 the bottom of the Edifice. The stone which fills it is slightly darker
 than the stone walls which surround it.

>throw rock at edifice
 Rock narrowly misses the irregularities above the recess.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 toss the rock.

>take rock
 Taken.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 pick up an inedible object.

>touch recess
 If anything, the stone within the recess is smoother and colder than
 that of the rest of the tower.

>enter recess
 The recess is too shallow to enter.

 The wind shifts, carrying your scent in a new direction.

>pray
>shower then apply deodorant
 Nothing practical results from your prayer.

 You feel sure that your Enemies have found your trail now.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>push recess
 You sense a slight tremor of movement, but nothing more.

 Your sharp ears pick up a crackling in the bracken.

>hit recess
 You sense a slight tremor of movement, but nothing more.

 With a snarl and a leap, something dark and dangerous leaps out of the
 forest at you. The smell of particularly bad breath is the last thing
 you remember.


     *** You have died ***


 You had visited no levels of the Edifice and solved none of them.  You
 had died, but just before that, you were very content at the end of the
 game.

 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move or
 QUIT?
>push recess
 Please give one of the answers above.

 The Others stare at you, confused.

 You find nothing of interest.

 A distant howl sends a chill down your spine.

 The recess is slightly larger than you, and is flush with the ground at
 the bottom of the Edifice. The stone which fills it is slightly darker
 than the stone walls which surround it.

 The wind shifts, carrying your scent in a new direction.

 If anything, the stone within the recess is smoother and colder than

 One of the irregularities reminds you of a snake.

 You feel sure that your Enemies have found your trail now.

 Your sharp ears pick up a crackling in the bracken.

 (first taking the Edifice)
 That's fixed in place.

 With a snarl and a leap, something dark and dangerous leaps out of the
 forest at you. The smell of particularly bad breath is the last thing
 you remember.


     *** You have died ***


 You had visited no levels of the Edifice and solved none of them.  You

 At the Edifice
 Here, in the forest where you have spent your entire life, stands a
 huge Edifice, reaching into the clouds high above you.

 The Others are here, doing typically boring things.

 Though you can't see them, you sense your Enemies lurk nearby.

 You can also see Rock here.

>hide
 Quickly, you scamper up a tree and swing over to a different one.
 Rock-solid, you wait. Not long afterwards, one of your Enemies comes
 wandering out of the Forest, looking for you. It circles the tree you
 climbed a few times, staring up into the branches. You hardly dare
 breathe as it stops and scans the rest of the forest. Finally, with a
 low growl, it moves away. Thankfully, you descend back to the ground.

>pick up edifice
 That's fixed in place.

>get rock
 Taken.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 pick up an inedible object.

>climb tree
 Your Enemies are long gone by now.

>examine edifice
 The Edifice towers above you, shooting up through the trees of the
 forest. It is completely smooth, apart from some irregularities above a
 tall, shallow rectangular recess, carved into the stone. You don't
 remember seeing it here before today, but, then again, it's not food
 and it doesn't seem dangerous.

>jump
 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

>climb edifice
 The walls are much too smooth.

>examine recess
 The recess is slightly larger than you, and is flush with the ground at
 the bottom of the Edifice. The stone which fills it is slightly darker
 than the stone walls which surround it.

>read recess
 The recess is slightly larger than you, and is flush with the ground at
 the bottom of the Edifice. The stone which fills it is slightly darker

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>push recess
 You sense a slight tremor of movement, but nothing more.

>push recess
 You sense a slight tremor of movement, but nothing more.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tell others to push recess
>get rock
 The Others stare at you, confused.

 You already have that.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 pick up an inedible object.

>put rock in recess
>throw rock at recess
 That can't contain things.

 Clang! A brash sound of stone on stone resounds from the recess. It
 begins to fade and drop in pitch when the Edifice itself picks up on
 the resonance. The clang transforms into a harsh throbbing, growing,
 deepening, until the scenery itself seems to shimmer with the wavering.
 Finally, it settles back down. A small cloud of dust is settling where
 the recess--was? The stone there is gone, replaced by a spongy
 blackness.

 Rock lies on the ground in front of you, unblemished.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 toss the rock.

>take rock
 Taken.

 The Others turn to stare at you, dumbfounded that anyone would think to
 pick up an inedible object.

>examine me
 You are well adapted to your environment. Your long arms and legs allow
 you to easily climb and swing in trees; your fur makes it easier to
 withstand the occasional cold night. Your colleagues seem to think your
 opposable thumbs make you look funny, which is why you spend so much
 time alone, but all in all, they've worked out pretty well.

>touch recess
 If anything, the stone within the recess is smoother and colder than
 that of the rest of the tower.

>in
>touch yourself
 Hesitantly, you step inside the Edifice,...

 Level One
 Green sunlight filters in from the west through the open recess,
 illuminating a small, round room, simple but totally foreign to you. A
 staircase (when did you learn that word?) winds up along the curved
 wall to another level above you, and, oddly, another doorway leads
 east, as if it would lead back into the forest.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a grassland with a
 stream running through it, which adorn one panel on the wall next to
 the door.

 The simple door is closed.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine etchings
 Examining the panel near the door, you can see a man, wandering across
 the plains, an animal of some sort, and a tall tree.

>go east

 You feel a tingling sensation and your features seem to alter as you
 pass through the door.

 Near the Arch
 Well, this certainly isn't the Forest you've come to know and love. You
 are standing in the middle of a vast grassland, broken only by the
 incongruous stone arch you passed through on your way here. Through it,
 you can see back into the dimly-lit Edifice to the west, a sharp
 contrast to the bright sunlight all around you.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water away to the
 northeast.

 To the east some kind of animal roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.

>examine me
 You're different. You are about as tall as a two-year-old sapling, and
 your arms come down to about your knees. Walking upright is more
 comfortable now, though you're hunched over. Your thin layer of hair
 does little to block the wind, but this doesn't seem to bother you.
 Your head seems to be bigger than it used to be in the Forest.

 You feel a little thirsty.

>go northeast

 Muddy Spring
 Here you see the beginnings of a small spring.

 The spring bubbles up out of the earth, and has turned the whole area
 here quite muddy.

 To the southeast some kind of animal roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it whispers over the water.

>score
 You have visited one level of the Edifice and solved none of them.  You
 are very content.

>xyzzy
 You mutter a nonsense word, and, surprisingly, the Edifice trembles in
 response! Everything else goes silent, and for a moment, it sounds as
 if the Edifice might collapse! Finally, it stills, and the world
 returns to normal.

 You seem to have created a Word of Power.

>examine water
 The spring bubbles up out of the earth, and has turned the whole area
 here quite muddy.

>drink water
 You take a small drink, but the muddy water isn't all that satisfying.

>examine water
 The spring bubbles up out of the earth, and has turned the whole area

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>se

 By Stump
 The main feature of this area of the grassland is a large, squat,
 blackened Stump, evidently a victim of a past brush fire. The grasses
 wave around Stump, and one or two have taken root in the Stump itself.
 Some day, this will be little more than a rise in the countryside.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the
 north and east.

 To the south some kind of animal roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.

>examine stump
 Stump is slightly soft from years of decay.

>examine grasses
 The long grasses bend in the breeze.

>go east

 Stream Rapids
 The lush grassland to the west begins to peter out here, becoming more
 rocky, dry, and hilly.

 The stream cascades down from a pool to the northwest, rushing away and
 thinning to the east. Wedged under a rock, you see a dead animal of
 some sort, strangely distorted by the rushing water.

 To the southwest some kind of animal roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of baked rock
 as it whispers over the water.

>examine dead animal
 This animal must have died a long time ago. It is completely
 unrecognizable.

>take it
 The animal seems to be stuck in a crack at the bottom of the stream.
 Besides, the water here is probably completely contaminated anyway.

>search dead animal
 The animal is stuck at the bottom of the stream.

>go southwest

 Open Grassland
 You are in the middle of an open grassland, the only visible tree far
 to the north. Despite your history of living in a forest, the wide open
 space feels free and natural, as if you had spent your entire life
 here.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the
 north.

 Nearby, you see Beast, chewing contentedly on some grass.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.

 Beast finishes cropping the grass in his area, and wanders across the
 plain up next to you.

>examine beast
 Beast is about three times your size, with a soft brown coat and nubs
 of horns on his head. He is currently next to you, chewing contentedly
 on some grass.

 Carefully, you approach and touch Beast. His hide is thick and soft,
 and covers a rather plump body.

>moo at beast
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ride beast
 You get a running start and attempt to leap on Beast. Unfortunately,
 Beast steps away at the last minute, and you end up on the ground.

 But Beast is right here!

>look under beast
 You find nothing of interest.

>climb beast
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>examine grass
 The long grasses bend in the breeze.

 You're feeling rather parched.

>beast, follow me
 Beast has better things to do.

>mount beast
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>"mount" beast
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go north

 You wander through the grassland to the north.


 By Stump
 The main feature of this area of the grassland is a large, squat,
 blackened Stump, evidently a victim of a past brush fire. The grasses
 wave around Stump, and one or two have taken root in the Stump itself.
 Some day, this will be little more than a rise in the countryside.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the
 north and east.

 To the south Beast roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.

>go north

 At the Pool
 The land here is divided by a stream, which has collected to form a
 wide, still pool.

 Weeds and long grasses choke the sides of the pool all around, but a
 long, flat rock juts out into the pool, shaded by a tall tree to the
 north.

 To the south Beast roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it whispers over the water.

>drink pool
 You push your way through the grass and rushes to get a drink, but you
 end up stirring up a lot of mud in the process. You take a drink, but
 it's not that satisfying.

>sit on rock
 (Flat Rock)
 You get onto Flat Rock.

>drink pool
 You crouch on the edge of the rock and drink deeply from the wide pool.
 In the process, the rock you are squatting on gets wet, but your thirst
 is now completely satisfied.

>thank rock
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go northeast
 You'll have to get off Flat Rock first.

 Your stomach growls.

>out
 You get off Flat Rock.

 At the Pool
 The land here is divided by a stream, which has collected to form a
 wide, still pool.

 Weeds and long grasses choke the sides of the pool all around, but a
 long, flat rock juts out into the pool, shaded by a tall tree to the
 north.

 To the south Beast roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it whispers over the water.

>go northeast
 You can follow the stream west upstream or southeast downstream, or
 leave the stream north to the tree or south to open grassland.

>go north

 At the Tree
 The lush grassland to the south and southwest begins to get rocky here.
 Just at the border between grassland and rocks, a mighty Tree towers
 above you.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the
 south.

 To the south Beast roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the branches of the tree.

>go northeast
 The land begins to get rocky and treacherous in that direction.

>go east
 The land begins to get rocky and treacherous in that direction.

>go west
 The land begins to get rocky and treacherous in that direction.

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go up

 Up the Tree
 Climbing trees is a lot harder than you remember. You've managed to
 position yourself about three-quarters of the way up the tree, and are
 sitting in a fork in the trunk.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water below you
 to the south.

 To the south, beyond the stream and a stump, Beast roams the
 countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.

 From this vantage point, you can see a large dead Branch, jutting out
 to the east.

>examine tree
 This tree will hold your weight up this far, but not much higher.

>go east
 You would surely fall to your death!

>examine branch
 Branch is large, taking up a good portion of the tree. It must be held
 in place by adjacent branches, because it has almost detached from the
 trunk near your feet.

>get branch
 Branch must be attached more firmly than it looked. You seem unable to
 detach it with your hands.

>hit branch with rock
 CRAAAAACK! After a few moments of persistent hacking, the
 already-weakened Branch breaks apart from the tree and swings to the
 ground, the momentum pulling it from the clutches of the surrounding
 branches.

>go down

 At the Tree
 The lush grassland to the south and southwest begins to get rocky here.
 Just at the border between grassland and rocks, a mighty Tree towers
 above you.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the
 south.

 To the south Beast roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the branches of the tree.

 You can see Dead Branch here.

>take branch
 You strain at the heavy branch for a bit, but are unable to move it
 more than a few inches.

>examine branch
 Branch is quite large.  A long, central shaft, twice as long as you are
 tall and surprisingly straight is covered with twisty branches and dead
 leaves.

>hit branch with rock
 You're not having much luck, what with the smaller branches in the way.

>remove smaller branches
 (first taking the twisty branches)
 The branches are currently attached to the main branch.

>detach branch
 You can't detach Branch with all the smaller branches in the way.

>break smaller branches
 It's a good thing Branch was so dry. It still takes some concerted
 effort, but you manage to break off the side branches from Branch.

>examine branch
 The denuded branch is about as thick around as your thigh on one end,
 and about as thick around as your wrist on the other.

>hit branch
 Just hitting the center of Branch isn't having much effect.

>hit branch with rock
 Just hitting the center of Branch isn't having much effect.

>hit branch end with rock
 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit Dead Branch.

>take branch
 Even devoid of any extraneous branches, Branch is still too long and
 heavy to move. You figure you could probably carry one half of it, but
 not the whole thing.

>jump on branch
>cut branch
 Though that might take out some of your frustrations, it is unlikely to
 accomplish much.

 Cutting that up would achieve little.

>take end of branch
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine branch end
 You can't see any such thing.

>take half of branch
 You can't see any such thing.

>pull branch
 Even devoid of any extraneous branches, Branch is still too long and
 heavy to move. You figure you could probably carry one half of it, but
 not the whole thing.

>pull branch s
 You can lean forwards, backwards, right, or left.

>cut branch with rock
 Dead Branch will not readily hold an edge.

>break branch
 With a heave, you bend the branch over itself, snapping it in two.

>examine branch
 Which do you mean, Stick or Log?

>take stick
 Taken.

>examine stick
 Stick is about as long as you are tall, and surprisingly straight.
 Along its shaft, it tapers from about the width of your bicep to the
 width of your wrist.

>cut stick
 Using Rock, you whittle down the tapered end of Stick to a point.

>cry
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look

 At the Tree
 The lush grassland to the south and southwest begins to get rocky here.
 Just at the border between grassland and rocks, a mighty Tree towers
 above you.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the
 south.

 To the south Beast roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the branches of the tree.

 You can see Log and some twisty branches here.

>take branches
 (the twisty branches)
 Taken.

>examine log
 As thick around as your thigh at its thickest, Log is about as long as
 you are tall.

>examine branches
 Which do you mean, Tree or the twisty branches?

>examine twisty branches
 The many branches are numerous, dry, and twisty. Twigs and leaves stick
 out at all angles.

>attach rock to stick
 You would achieve nothing by this.

>take log
 You cannot even begin to lift Log while you're still carrying other
 items.

>hit log with rock
 Useful Rock does not make a very good weapon.

>screw log with stick
 I only understood you as far as wanting to screw Log.

>go east
 The land begins to get rocky and treacherous in that direction.

>go south

 At the Pool
 The land here is divided by a stream, which has collected to form a
 wide, still pool.

 Weeds and long grasses choke the sides of the pool all around, but a
 long, flat rock juts out into the pool. The sun shines through a gap in
 a tree to the north, bathing the rock in sunlight.

 To the south Beast roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it whispers over the water.

 You're beginning to feel rather hungry.

>go south

 Beast looks at you askance.

>take stick

>throw rock at beast
 Useful Rock falls way short of its mark, but Beast appears to have
 noticed anyway.

 Beast decides he's had just about enough of your attacks, and lopes
 away with surprising speed and agility for one so large. You run to
 catch up, but he quickly outdistances you, becoming a dot on the
 horizon in a matter of seconds, and disappearing entirely in a matter
 of minutes.

 At the Tree
 The lush grassland to the south and southwest begins to get rocky here.
 Just at the border between grassland and rocks, a mighty Tree towers
 above you.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the
 south.

 To the south Beast roams the countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the branches of the tree.

 Up the Tree
 Climbing trees is a lot harder than you remember. You've managed to
 position yourself about three-quarters of the way up the tree, and are
 sitting in a fork in the trunk.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water below you
 to the south.

 To the south, beyond the stream and a stump, Beast roams the
 countryside.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.

 From this vantage point, you can see a large dead Branch, jutting out
 to the east.

>hit branch with rock
 CRAAAAACK! After a few moments of persistent hacking, the
 already-weakened Branch breaks apart from the tree and swings to the
 ground, the momentum pulling it from the clutches of the surrounding
 branches.

 At the Pool
 The land here is divided by a stream, which has collected to form a
 wide, still pool.

 Weeds and long grasses choke the sides of the pool all around, but a
 long, flat rock juts out into the pool. The sun shines through a gap in
 a tree to the north, bathing the rock in sunlight.

 By Stump
 The main feature of this area of the grassland is a large, squat,
 blackened Stump, evidently a victim of a past brush fire. The grasses
 wave around Stump, and one or two have taken root in the Stump itself.
 Some day, this will be little more than a rise in the countryside.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the
 north and east.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of smoke as
 it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.

 Muddy Spring
 Here you see the beginnings of a small spring.

 The spring bubbles up out of the earth, and has turned the whole area
 here quite muddy.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
 it whispers over the water.

 Near the Arch
 Well, this certainly isn't the Forest you've come to know and love. You
 are standing in the middle of a vast grassland, broken only by the
 incongruous stone arch you passed through on your way here. Through it,
 you can see back into the dimly-lit Edifice to the west, a sharp
 contrast to the bright sunlight all around you.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water away to the
 northeast.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of smoke as

>blow fire

 Level One
 Green sunlight filters in from the west through the open recess,
 illuminating a small, round room, simple but totally foreign to you. A
 staircase (when did you learn that word?) winds up along the curved
 wall to another level above you, and, oddly, another doorway leads
 east, as if it would lead back into the forest.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a grassland with a
 stream running through it, which stretch around the entire room, from
 the doorway to the staircase.

 The simple door is open. Oddly, you see grassland on the other side,
 not forest.

>examine etching
 Examining the panel near the door, you can see a man, wandering across
 the plains, an animal of some sort, and a tall tree.

 The next panel shows the man standing on a rock jutting out into the
 stream, drinking deeply.

 In the next panel, you see the man fashioning a spear from a fallen
 tree branch, and using it to attack and kill the animal.

 In the next panel, the man is making a fire on the rock by the stream.

 In the final panel, the man is cooking and eating the animal.

>examine me
 You are about as tall as a two-year-old sapling, and your arms come
 down to about your knees. Walking upright is more comfortable now,
 though you're hunched over. Your thin layer of hair does little to
 block the wind, but this doesn't seem to bother you. Your head seems to
 be bigger than it used to be in the Forest.

 You are no longer either thirsty or hungry.

 Level Two
 This room is akin to the room below. There are staircases going up and
 down, and another door going east.

 The simple door is closed.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a forest with a river,
 and two huts, which adorn one panel on the wall next to the door.

>give it to beast
 You can't see "it" (Fire) at the moment.

>look through door

>examine door

>go east

 You feel a tingling sensation and your features seem to alter as you
 pass through the door.

 Clearing near Hut
 This is a small, cleared area in front of your Hut in the middle of the
 forest. The autumn leaves crunch under your feet, and the smell of
 winter is in the air. A well-worn path runs to the south towards the
 sound of rushing water, and another leads north, deeper into the
 forest.

 Strangely, you seem to have entered this area through a
 rectangular-shaped hole in a tree to the west.

 Near the door is Firepit, where you cook all your meals.

>examine me
 You're different. You seem to be walking almost perfectly upright now,
 and your hands only come down to mid-thigh. Your head is even larger
 than it was in the plains, and your jaw juts forward. You feel you have
 much more fine motor control of the muscles around your mouth. You also
 seem to have some sort of skin wrapped around your waist.

>examine hut
 A hide hangs over the entryway of your Hut, to the east.

>go east
 You push aside the hide and enter the Hut.


 Inside Hut
 You are inside the hut where it seems you have lived all your life. You
 live here with Grandmother (your Mother), Wife, and Son. The normally
 homey smell you associate with this place is currently masked by the
 smell of sickness. Stray light and fresh air come in around a
 hide-covered doorway, back to the west, but they do little to mask the
 sense of dread and concern that hangs over everyone in this room.

 A hushed conversation is coming from the two women of the house, as
 they do what they can for your boy.

 Wife takes the rag from Son's head and replaces it with a dampened one.

 As you enter, Wife runs up to you and throws her arms around you.
 "Thankful! Good! Grandmother says Fever more bad." She indicates Son,
 as Grandmother exchanges a now-dry rag on his forehead for a wet one.
 "Grandmother says you search forest now, find Feverleaf. If you find,
 Son will live, but last chance." You look at Son again as Wife gazes
 imploringly at you, and you turn around quickly, so Wife will not see
 you wipe a tear from your cheek.

>ask grandmother about feverleaf
 Grandmother sighs impatiently. "Told you before. Long stem, with many
 groups of four round leaves. Find in Forest."

>grandmother, well excuuuuuuuuuse me
 You quail at the thought of ordering Grandmother around, especially
 now, when she's in one of her authoritative moods.

 This is a small, cleared area in front of your Hut in the middle of the

 Strangely, you seem to have entered this area through a
 rectangular-shaped hole in a tree to the west.

 Near the door is Firepit, where you cook all your meals.

 Here, a river wider across than you can throw a stone flows past. You

 Forest Path
 This is the forest where you hunt for food and skins, though you don't
 believe you'll be hunting much today. Some birds still chirp in the
 trees, though many have flown away, as they do every winter. The rustle
 of wind through the golden leaves counterpoints your own footsteps, as
 you wend your way through the forest. The path you used to get here
 goes back south, and another path leads northeast, which you've never
 used before today.

 To one side of the path, you see a small berry bush.

 On Berry Bush are Berries.

>take berries
 Taken.

 You can't see any such thing.

 Stranger's Hut
 You've emerged from the northeast path to another Hut, rather like your
 own. This one is larger, though, and has woven leaves as a doorway

 the path you came from the southwest.

 Stranger is here, standing in front of his Hut, standing defensively,
 and looking suspiciously at you.

>examine berries
 Stranger watches you carefully.

 These juicy black berries are in season this time of year, and should
 be good to eat.

>examine stranger
 Stranger watches you carefully.

 Stranger is tall, slender, and quite muscular. He wears the black skin
 of Panther and carries a long knife, making him that much more
 impressive.

 slashes with the knife at some invisible enemy, as if to emphasize his

 You have sketched Feverleaf exactly the way Grandmother described it to

 Stranger coughs a few times, puts his hand on his stomach, lolls his
 head to one side and sticks his tongue out of his mouth. He then
 straightens up. "Akne," he repeats.

 Stranger throws his hands in the air and whoops wildly!

>akne=sickness, selme=good, I think
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>stranger, ne rema ben akne
 Stranger becomes serious, and looks quite concerned. "Krande," he says,
 "Fe rema akne; ben krande."

>stranger, fe rema ben akne
 Stranger looks at his son and feels his forehead. "Y," he says, looking
 relieved, "Tsa y ben akne."

>show bark to stranger
 Stranger says, "A! Rakasha! Fe rema ben akne! Na alanasen!" He runs
 back into his hut, and shortly reappears with a stem from a small
>stranger, ne rema ben akne
 plant, which he hands to you with great reverence. "Fa alsen tsa fe
 rema," he tells you. "Tsa ben selme."

 Stranger becomes serious, and looks quite concerned. "Krande," he says,

 Stranger is here, standing in front of his Hut, standing defensively,

 You can also see Small Boy here.

 Stranger stops you angrily. "Tsa ben ne! Fa hallen, scarmul alsen!" He
 points at your Useful Rock, then back down the southwest path.

>go east
 You push aside the hide and enter the Hut.


 Inside Hut
 You are inside the hut where it seems you have lived all your life. You
 live here with Grandmother (your Mother), Wife, and Son. The normally
 homey smell you associate with this place is currently masked by the
 smell of sickness. Stray light and fresh air come in around a
 hide-covered doorway, back to the west, but they do little to mask the
 sense of dread and concern that hangs over everyone in this room.

 A hushed conversation is coming from the two women of the house, as
 they do what they can for your boy.

 Grandmother looks up as you enter, and you proudly display the Fever
 Leaf. Not much time is spent on congratulations, however, as you are
 quickly given the task to build a fire and boil some water.

 The next several hours are an anxious blur. The fire is built, a tea is
 prepared, and carefully spooned to Son. After that, there's not much
 more you can do, and the three of you take turns through the night
 staying up and changing wet rags on Son's forehead. Finally, the next
 morning, Son stops mumbling and coughing, and falls into a truly
 restful sleep. A few hours later, Grandmother announces that his fever
 has gone down, and you and Wife nearly cry with relief.

 Just then, there is movement near the Hut door, so you grab your weapon
 and see what it is. You throw back the hide doorway and see, to your
 surprise, Stranger standing there, with his son.

 "Selme?" he asks, hesitantly.

 "A selme," you reply, with relief. "Ne rema y akne." You hesitate a
 moment, not knowing the right words, and finally give up, and finish,
 "Thank you."

 Stranger thinks for a second, then hazards, "Well-come?" The two of you
 exchange huge smiles.

 In the end, Son does indeed get better, and he and Stranger's Boy
 become good friends.

 River
 Here, a river wider across than you can throw a stone flows past. You
 sometimes catch fish here, and your son loves to come here and skip
 rocks across the river's surface. Many white-barked trees grow close to
 the river's edge here, of a different variety than you usually see in
 the depths of the forest.

 The two children are here, laughing and playing together next to the
 River.

 Wife is here, watching the two kids.

 Level Two
 This room is akin to the room below. There are staircases going up and
 down, and another door going east.

 The simple door is open. Through it, you see a wooded area, and a small
 Hut.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a forest with a river,
 and two huts, which stretch around the entire room, from the doorway to
 the staircase.

>examine etching
 The panel near the door contains etchings of a man, wandering through a
 forest.

 The next panel shows the man searching the forest for something. The
 detail in one of the huts is a little more clear, and it seems that
 there are three other figures within the hut, one of whom is lying on a
 bed of rags.

 The next panel shows the man collecting various materials from the
 area, and showing them to a second man by the other hut.

 In the next panel, the two men are conversing. It seems the first is
 describing the prone character in the hut, and the second is giving him
 some sort of plant as a result.

 In the final panel, the man has brought back the plant to the first
 hut, where it is being prepared for the figure in the bed. In the final
 scene, all the characters are mingling freely with each other.

>go up

 Level Three
 This room is akin to the room below. There is a staircase going down,
 and another door going east.

 The simple door is closed.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a village near a canyon
 with a herd of horses, which adorn one panel on the wall next to the
 door.

>open door
 You open the simple door.

>go east

 You feel a tingling sensation and your features seem to alter as you
 pass through the door.

 Village
 This is the small Village you seem to lead. It consists of several
 small huts, plus a larger one with no walls the People use as a meeting
 area. The People are there now, in fact, arguing over something. The
 ground slopes down to the north, and a path leads along a ridge to the
 northwest. A small stream collects here, and follows the slope down to
 the north.

 The People are debating loudly amongst themselves in the meeting area.

 Your own hut is just to the west, slightly larger than the others.

 As you enter, someone amongst the People yells, "There's the Chief!"
 Everyone quickly presses around you, all talking at once, and very
 agitated. After a bit you manage to calm them down, and figure out what
 they're concerned about:  Marauders are rumored to be plundering
 villages to the south! Something must be done to give your village an
 edge in the inevitable conflict to come.

>invent minigun
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine me
 You're different. You are walking erect, and seem to be decorated with
 some sort of headdress and body paint. If more paint implies more
 significance, you must be the most significant person in the
 village--everyone else wears much less than you do.

>examine hut
 Looking inside your grass hut you see stone walls, which is really
 rather odd.

>examine people
 The People of the Village are currently discussing a plan wherein a
 bell would be placed on the Marauders, so the People will know when
 they are near. The plan is quickly shot down by someone asking, "But
 who will bell the Marauders?"

>ask people about marauders
 The People give you about ten differing opinions, all of them
 singularly unhelpful.

>take bells
 You can't see any such thing.

>tell people about democracy
 The People listen to you, then half of them claim that what you said
 supports their side, and the other half claim you supported their side.
 The debate rages on, unimpeded.

 You notice one man slip to the edge of the crowd. A few minutes later,
 he seems to be gone.

>follow man
 But People is right here!

>examine stream
 The small stream has begun to show life again, although it disappeared
 in the height of summer. There is still more room among the rocks for
 more water, due later in the year.

 One old man cautions that the Village is not in a particularly

 The People listen to you, then half of them claim that what you said

 The debate rages on, unimpeded.

>go north

 Canyon Path
 This path marks the beginnings of a descent down into the local canyon,
 to the northeast. To the west is a small ragged cliff, small enough
 here to scale, but which becomes a more imposing wall as you continue
 your descent into the canyon. A small stream, beginning to show life
 again after the worst of the summer heat, follows its rocky bed here,
 as it continues down into the canyon.

>climb cliff

 You scramble up the slope and finally make it to the top.

 Ridge Path
 This path meanders northeast along the edge of a small cliff to the
 east, as it wends its way amongst the scrub. Your Village is back to
 the southeast.

>go northeast

 Overlook
 This spot gives you a breathtaking view of the countryside. A box
 canyon drops away to the east, and another, deeper ridge is to your
 north. Far away, you can see the tiny shimmer of the Stream which
 begins at your Village.

>go north
 Despairing of ever finding a way to outclass the Marauders, the Chief
 of the Village throws himself over the edge of the Cliff, dashing
 himself on the Rocks below. Fortunately for the Village in question,
 this is in an alternate time line, so there's still hope.

>examine stream
 You can't make out much more detail from this distance.

>examine canyon
 The cliff is quite steep, although ragged. The top layer, where you
 are, is a dusty red color. At the base of the canyon, you can see a
 herd of horses.

>go northeast

 Canyon
 You are at the base of a box canyon. Ragged walls tower over you on
 three sides, striated red, black, and tan. The small stream running
 along here dries up in the summer, but is now still active. A crack in
 the north wall of the canyon allows it to pass along its path from the
 Village, back up to the southwest.

 A Herd of Horses roam here, grazing on the tough grasses.

>examine horses
 You haven't paid much attention to the Horses before today, although
 you believe you've seen this Herd around before. These large and
 powerful beasts, fortunately, seem to be vegetarian.

>pet horses
 The Horses don't let you get near enough to touch them.

>examine grass
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine crack
 The walls provide some shade from the afternoon sun. That and the
 stream must be why the Horses are here.

>examine stream
 The small stream has begun to show life again, although it disappeared
 in the height of summer. There is still more room among the rocks for
 more water, due later in the year.

>ride horse

 That's a very good idea, but there's no easy way to get onto a Horse's

 Waterfall
 The stream from the south cuts through the wall of the canyon here, and
 runs for several paces before cascading down a steep, gravelly slope.
 The sides of the canyon provide a welcome shade from the hot sun, which
 apparently is also enjoyed by a small grove of Fruit Trees, clustered
 around a wide section of the stream.

>examine tree
 The shade and the stream have apparently combined to give these trees
 an ideal environment in which to thrive. Although not exactly laden
 with fruit, there is a fair amount of Fruit on the trees.

>take fruit

 You choose the ripest Piece of Fruit you can find, and pluck it from a
 low-swung branch.

 Throwing caution to the wind, you leap off the cliff, hurtling down
 towards the path below.

 Horse, busily munching away at the bottom of the hill, never even sees
 you coming. With a WHUMP, you land square on his back! You drop all
 your possessions as Horse rears, whinnies, and begins to run!

 Streaking Across the Countryside (on Horse)
 The view is almost a blur around you, as Horse runs frantically, trying
 to get you off his back. Every so often, you notice some feature of the
 landscape, but, unsurprisingly, most of your attention is on Horse, and
 your bumpy ride.

 Horse turns sharply, and your arms spin wildly, trying to compensate
 and keep your balance.

 The ride is unsettling you, and you feel yourself start to slip.


>grab horse
 Using both hands, you grab hold of the streaming Mane.

 Feeling your grip on his neck, Horse stops twisting and turning, and
 takes off in a new direction, going even faster.

 Streaking Across the Countryside (on Horse)
 The view is almost a blur around you, as Horse runs frantically, trying
 to get you off his back. Every so often, you notice some feature of the
 landscape, but, unsurprisingly, most of your attention is on Horse, and
 your bumpy ride.
 Unable or unwilling to hold on any more, you slide off Horse, narrowly
 avoiding being kicked on the way down.

 You notice one man slip to the edge of the crowd. A few minutes later,
 he seems to be gone.

>RESTORE

>grab mane
 Using both hands, you grab hold of the streaming Mane.

 Feeling your grip on his neck, Horse stops twisting and turning, and
 takes off in a new direction, going even faster.

>pull mane back
 You pull back on Mane. Unfortunately, Horse doesn't seem to slow
 perceptibly.

 Suddenly, Horse leaps over a ridge, and starts down a hill.

 The ride is unsettling you, and you feel yourself start to slip.

 You lean backwards, your arm stretching to keep a hold of Horse's Mane.

 Horse gains speed as he continues down the hill.

 You manage to steady yourself a bit.

 jarring you forward on your seat again, but you manage otherwise to
 keep your balance.

 Ahead of you, you see something large and black.

>pull mane left
 You pull Mane to the left.

 As you get nearer, the object resolves itself into a large boulder.
 Horse is heading straight towards it!

 As the boulder approaches, you think Horse might be heading to the left
 of it, due to your pulling.

 If you're leaning left, how do you expect to pull Mane right?

 You sense that Horse is beginning to tire. This is good, because it
 means you might be able to free up one of your hands to do something.
 Unfortunately, you are also tiring, and you can feel your grip with
 your knees weakening.

 Using your free hand, you cram your headdress on Horse's head, so that
 his eyes are covered. Not being able to see where he's going, Horse
 stops and moves around nervously. Gently, you calm him, and manage to
 urge him back to the Village.

 Your arrival causes a great commotion amongst the People. Everyone is
 overawed at the sight; the only thing detracting from your entrance the
 fact that your headdress is unceremoniously rammed onto Horse's head,
 making both of you look rather undignified. Still, the People are quick
 to realize that riding a Horse would be a wonderful way to discourage
 raiding Marauders, and they pester you with questions about how you
 managed to do it. Soon, the whole Village is out, trying to learn how
 to master the art of Horse Riding.

 Canyon Path
 This path marks the beginnings of a descent down into the local canyon,
 to the northeast. To the west is a small ragged cliff, small enough
 here to scale, but which becomes a more imposing wall as you continue
 your descent into the canyon. A small stream, beginning to show life
 again after the worst of the summer heat, follows its rocky bed here,
 as it continues down into the canyon.

 You can see Spear, Useful Rock, Bone, Purple Paste, White Bark and a

 Level Three
 This room is akin to the room below. There is a staircase going down,
 and another door going east.

 The simple door is open. Through it, you see a small group of huts,
 clustered on an open mesa.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a village near a canyon
 with a herd of horses, which stretch around the entire room, from the
 doorway to the staircase.

 As you go back into the Edifice, you begin to hear a rumbling sound.

>examine etching
 The panel near the door contains etchings of a man dressed up with some
 sort of hat, leading a small village. Off in one corner lurk
 threatening-looking men.

 The next panel shows the man with the hat near a waterfall, picking a
 piece of fruit.

 The next panel shows the man with the hat enticing a horse near a cliff
 with the fruit, then leaping on its back.

 In the next panel, the man with the hat is on the horse's back, dodging
 obstacles, and trying to keep his balance.

 In the final panel, the man no longer has his hat on, and is urging the
 horse back to the village. It seems that the hat is now on top of the
 horse, instead.

 The simple door to the east is closing of its own volition!

 A particularly violent tremble almost knocks you off your feet, but you

>go down

 Level One
 Green sunlight filters in from the west through the open recess,
 illuminating a small, round room, simple but totally foreign to you. A
 staircase (when did you learn that word?) winds up along the curved
 wall to another level above you, and, oddly, another doorway leads
 east, as if it would lead back into the forest.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a grassland with a
 stream running through it, which stretch around the entire room, from
 the doorway to the staircase.

 The simple door is open. Oddly, you see grassland on the other side,
 not forest.

 The east door is just about closed!

>out

 You feel a tingling sensation and your features seem to alter as you

 At the Edifice
 Here, in the forest where you have spent your entire life, stands a
 huge Edifice, reaching into the clouds high above you.

 The Others are here, doing typically boring things.

 In the distance, your Enemies search for easier prey.

 As you pass through the doorway, there is a rumble behind you. You turn
 to see the recess filled with stone again! You bang on it with Rock,
 but nothing seems to happen this time. As you step back, a fleeting
 memory from inside the Edifice tells you that the irregularities above
 the recess spell, "HISTORY", but then the memory disappears, and the
 irregularities just look like odd shapes again. "Oh, well," you think
 as you turn away. "At least it didn't try to eat me."

 Clearing near Hut
 This is a small, cleared area in front of your Hut in the middle of the
 forest. The autumn leaves crunch under your feet, and the smell of
 winter is in the air. A well-worn path runs to the south towards the
 sound of rushing water, and another leads north, deeper into the
 forest.

 Strangely, you seem to have entered this area through a
 rectangular-shaped hole in a tree to the west.

 Near the door is Firepit, where you cook all your meals.

 You step through the door, and hear a peculiar "Whump." behind you.
 Turning back around, you find that the tree which used to contain the
 door is seamless, with no trace of its former portal. You turn back
 around to the sound of laughing children, playing by the River, and
 decide to go join them for a while.

 As you step through your door back to the Village, you hear a peculiar
 "Foosh." behind you. Looking back, you see that the inside of your hut
 looks perfectly normal again; the stone walls of the Edifice gone
 completely. As you stand there contemplating this, a horse gallops by
 with one of the People on its back, yelling for help. Laughing, you run
 after them, shouting advice.

 huge Edifice, reaching into the clouds high above you.

 The Others are here, doing typically boring things.

 In the distance, your Enemies search for easier prey.

 As you pass through the doorway, there is a rumble behind you. You turn
 to see the recess filled with stone again! You bang on it with Rock,
 but nothing seems to happen this time. As you step back, a fleeting
 memory from inside the Edifice tells you that the irregularities above
 the recess spell, "HISTORY", but then the memory disappears, and the
 irregularities just look like odd shapes again. "Oh, well," you think
 as you turn away. "At least it didn't try to eat me."

 Level One
 Green sunlight filters in from the west through the open recess,
 illuminating a small, round room, simple but totally foreign to you. A
 staircase (when did you learn that word?) winds up along the curved
 wall to another level above you, and, oddly, another doorway leads
 east, as if it would lead back into the forest.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a grassland with a
 stream running through it, which stretch around the entire room, from
 the doorway to the staircase.

 The simple door is open. Oddly, you see grassland on the other side,
 not forest.

 The east door is just about closed!

>go east

 You feel a tingling sensation and your features seem to alter as you
 pass through the door.

 Near the Arch
 Well, this certainly isn't the Forest you've come to know and love. You
 are standing in the middle of a vast grassland, broken only by the
 incongruous stone arch you passed through on your way here. Through it,
 you can see back into the dimly-lit Edifice to the west, a sharp
 contrast to the bright sunlight all around you.

 Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water away to the
 northeast.

 A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of smoke as
 it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.

 As you pass through the arch, the door closes behind you. You watch in
 wonderment as it shimmers, then disappears from view. You wander around
 the spot where it was, but absolutely nothing remains--even the grass
 seems to have grown up where the arch's posts once stood. Finally, you
 turn and make your way across the grassland to the place you suddenly
 remember is home,...

>wait
 Time passes.

 The east door closes, and, as it does, the rumbling stops. To the west,
 the recess is blocked, as well.

>look

 Level One
 This room is small and featureless. There is a  staircases going up,
 and a door going east.
 The recess you originally came through is gone!

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a grassland with a
 stream running through it, which stretch around the entire room, from
 the doorway to the staircase.

 The simple door is closed.

>go up
>examine etchings

 Level Two
 This room is akin to the room below. There are staircases going up and
 down, and another door going east.

 The simple door is closed.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a forest with a river,
 and two huts, which stretch around the entire room, from the doorway to
 the staircase.

 The panel near the door contains etchings of a man, wandering through a
 forest.

 The next panel shows the man searching the forest for something. The
 detail in one of the huts is a little more clear, and it seems that
 there are three other figures within the hut, one of whom is lying on a
 bed of rags.

 The next panel shows the man collecting various materials from the
 area, and showing them to a second man by the other hut.

 In the next panel, the two men are conversing. It seems the first is
 describing the prone character in the hut, and the second is giving him
 some sort of plant as a result.

 In the final panel, the man has brought back the plant to the first
 hut, where it is being prepared for the figure in the bed. In the final
 scene, all the characters are mingling freely with each other.

>go up

 Level Three
 This room is akin to the room below. There are staircases going up and
 down, and another door going east.

 The simple door is closed.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a village near a canyon
 with a herd of horses, which stretch around the entire room, from the
 doorway to the staircase.

 Wait a minute. A staircase going up? That wasn't here before. Was it?

>sleep
 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

>examine staircase
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>go up

 Level Four
 This room is akin to the room below. There are staircases going up and
 down, and another door going east.

 You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a tribe, wandering
 through a vast landscape, which adorn one panel on the wall next to the
 door.

 The simple door is closed.

>examine etchings
 The panel near the door contains etchings of a nomadic tribe of people,
 hunting and gathering food to survive.

>SAVE
>cf15
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go up
 Resolutely, you climb even higher in the Edifice.
