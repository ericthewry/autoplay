 Unscientific Fiction
 An Interactive Fiction by Tom Tervoort
 Release 2 / Serial number 090803 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

                                    Prologue

 You wake up with a headache, unable to remember who you are, where you
 are and how you got here.

 You hear the faint sound of... well, you don't know what it is. Maybe
 something mechanical.

 It smells funny here. It isn't exactly a pleasant odour but not too
 irritating.

 You slowly open your eyes.

 Mysterious Room
 You are in a small square room surrounded by metal walls. There is a
 huge steel door north of you. You're standing on a purple carpet.

 A poster is hanging on the wall left of you.

 In a corner is a metal toilet.

>examine me

>examine poster
 images. They might be characters of some kind of weird language but
 their placement is pretty chaotic. Under it you see a Chinese, Spanish
 and Brittish flag with probably translations in their respective
 languages. Next to the third flag you read:

 While residing in one of our high-class fully carpeted containment
 cells we politely ask you to please respect the following rules:
  - Do not commit suicide unless you're ordered to.
  - Do not use warp devices without special permission.
  - Garglun'kc are not allowed to use their Uynck'ha-tau.
  - If you receive a newspaper, do not fill in the crossword or Sudoku
 puzzles with a difficulty rating of more than two stars.
  - Do not use the toilet to flush anything else than your personal
 fecies or toilet paper (if available).

 We thank you for your cooperation.


 Containment cell? It seems that you are in some kind of prison.

 You hear a bubbling sound coming from under the floor.

 BWAMM!! Suddenly an enormous amount of water blasts out of the toilet
 and rains down on you and the floor. A pool of water has been formed in
 front of you.

>pool

>examine pool
>dance

 You notice a plastic bag with something in it in the water.


>get bag
 thing it contains is a green severed hand. Blergh.

 For some reason, you carefully take the bag with you. You have the
 feeling you might need it in the future.

>examine pool

>drink pool
 You rather not, it doesn't look healty.

 Suddenly the door opens. And standing there is a purple blob waving
 around with eight long black tentacles. On top of his head are three
 round things that look like eyes with five pupils each. It moves
 forward on hundreds of tiny needles and has a hole in his "belly", it
 is very well possible that's his mouth. Overall it looks more like a
 bad Spore creation than the kind of aliens some Americans say they've
 been abducted by.

 The creature first looks at the 'little accident' you've caused and
 then it keeps staring at you for a few creepy seconds, probably not
 knowing what to do.
 You are about to faint, but a sudden loud noise keeps you awake. It's
 the worst thing that has ever reached your eardrums since... you try to
 think of a pop culture reference but realise a comparison to CIA
 torture techniques would be more appropiate. It finally stops when the
 creature presses a button on his cell phone. It seems bad ringtones are
 not exclusive to Earth.
 He holds the phone in front of his right eye (apparently he also uses
 it to hear) for a while and before you realise it, he has planted one
 of his tentacles in your forehead and sucked your brains out.

 Finally, research subject number 848930! I am a LAH65 computer with
 firmware version 978.11 and running on all the newest open source Linux
 OS's simultaniously. My serial number is SZ-195-NN but the nickname the
 Prime Commander has given me is 'Lucy' and can also be used to refer to
 me.
 848930, your organic processor has been removed from your body because
 you have enganged in criminal act #01134: violation of the rules of our
 luxerious class 4 room for involuntarily guests. This has caused heavy
 damage to our carefully recreated habitat of the Homo Sapiens species.
 Although you are a too unintelligent being to understand the
 consequences of your actions, you were clearly aware of the rules
 because security videos show you reading the rule pamphlet while your
 file shows you're not an anafalbetist.

 Because of this, 848930, you have been sentenced to the highest
 possible punishment, it will consist of the maximal amount of possible
 nonlethal pain impulses that will be send to your brains for the rest
 of your life, which will be artificialy extended to five million years.
 Trust me, if you have ever wondered what would be the worst thing that
 could ever happen to you: this is it.

 Lucy: Indeed. However, there is one possibility to avoid your
 punishment. Well, I wouldn't call it a possibility since the chance
 that it would happen is smaller than 1 / Graham's number %, but I will
 get a good virtual laugh out of seeing you fail. Anyway, what you have
 to do is answer an extremely hard question all of the greatest minds of
 the galaxy have tried to answer since the "big bang". If you would turn
 every proton in the universe into a computer which is a millionth times
 more powerfull than myself (which is impossible, since I am already
 more powerfull than all of the Braagluuurion's minds together) and let
 them work for a googolplex amount of millenia, then they still wouldn't
 have come up with the answer.

 You would like to, but the impulses your brain sends to your body don't

 Lucy: Very well, here is the question:

 There are three cans of liquid uranium standing on a three-legged
 table. A Krug, a mhjiiil and a penguin all take a can but the mhjiiil
 puts his back after he drank the uranium. How many cans are there on
 the three-legged table now?

 Take your time to answer this question, and it also might be a good
 idea to SAVE before you do that. If you think the answer is 6754 for
 example you can use the command "answer 6754 to Lucy".
>SAVE
>cf2

>who is lucy?

>answer 1 to lucy
 said one? What an odd choice, none of the greatest minds of the galaxy
 even thought about assuming that this could be the answer. Of course
 it's still wrong, it is impossible that this could be right. But I'll
 try to use the awesome power of all my combined microprossesors to
 reverse calculate the question with one as an answer.
 ... .. ......... ..... ...............
 OH MY MYSTERIOUS FORCE THAT MAINTAINS THE ORDER OF ALL PARTICLES IN THE
 UNIVERSE! It... it... I did not receive any error messages. This can't
 be... it al completely fits. It's so incredibly simple: even though its
 contents have been removed, the object in question still can be
 described as a "can"... and if you look at the organic properties of a
 mhjiiil and then.........velocity of light.........Boltzman
 constant........inversed square root......YOU!! Y-y-you must be the
 most intelligent organism in the whole universe. T-this is excellent.
 The Prime Commander just happened to have ordered me to find the most
 intelligent being in existence and promote it to its main advisor. What
 about it? Do you want to accept this role and avoid your punishment?

 Yes? That is fantastic, I will now put you in a state of hibernation to
 spare your valuable brains.

 You suddenly feel very, very weird.

 You are in a vast green field. There a giant Mushrooms everywhere.

 A little blue man with a white hat is walking around and looking at the
 mushrooms.

 You here the sound of an airplane above you.. You look up, just in time

 Your head hurts... Oh wait, you haven't got a head anymore, only
 brains...

 Lucy: Ah, you're awake! I'm sorry that I had to wake you from your
 illusion. But we are currently in the middle of a crisis, and the Prime
 Commander has asked for your help as his advisor.
 Anyway, we are having a problem of the culinary kind. Our previous cook
 has recently been executed because the Prime Commander has found a
 tentacle hair in his soup. We have managed to find a replacement but
 this one can't cook anything else than tacos with custard pudding. Our
 troops are starving for some variation. So the great question is: what
 kind of food will be of such great quality so it would certainly
 increase the morale of the troops but can still be made by a cook who
 only has experience making custard pudding tacos?

 Anyway, you will receive your reward... sometimes in the future. Such a
 great crisis like this one luckily only happens once every 200 years,
 so we will not be needing you until then. Have fun in your illusionary
 state of mind.

 You feel like all the water in your brain is being replaced with liquid
 nitrogen. Probably something like that is actually happening...

 The hat has become so light it floats away, but you quickly catch it
 and knot the rope to it. Now the hat just looks like a helium balloon.
 Ah, so that substance is liquid helium and has logically been
 evaporated in room temperature.

 Note: I am aware that the scientific properties of the element helium
 are probably highly inaccurate in this game, just like the behavior of
 brown walking mushrooms.

 Good ol' Darkness
 Argh, you just almost started to like Mushroomland. What does that
 stupid computer need you for now?

 Lucy: Ahem. I can read your mind, remember? And I do not fully agree
 with your assumption of me being stupid, Mr.
 Let's-commit-genocide-on-an-entire-alien-race-by-giving-them-a-bad-food
 -advice. Don't play dumb with me. If you truly are the most intelligent
 being in the universe you should have known that laxative has the same
 effect on the almighty Brukgh?rhcs as salt on snails. The chemical
 reactions between the molecular composition of laxative and a
 Brukgh?rhc cell nucleus convert both compositions into smelly air.
 Basically you've completely eradicated the great race of my builders.
 I have got some artificial emotions of protectionism for my creators
 and those scripts of my A.I. want me to feed your brain to a female
 Krahlyak. But the Prime Commander has given me orders of a higher
 priority: namely that I should assure that his master plan of
 destroying the entire universe would succeed. You see, the Universe
 Destroyer Gun 3000(TM) has already been completely finished and all
 preperations are finished. The only thing left to do is the simple
 press of a big red button. I however, sadly have no acces to the
 seperate computer that is build to activate the Universe Destroyer Gun
 3000(TM), and because everything on this ship except you is dead, you
 will have to press the button. If you refuse to do this, I will simply
 torcher you until you yield. Understood?

 Okay then, I will now place your brains in a humanoid robot. You are
 free to strech your little robot legs by walking around the ship before
 ending the universe. Just don't try anything stupid, your home planet
 is as much light years away as I have got microprocessors.

 To all fellow dishwashers who got locked up here without food: I just
 found out that if you expose a red keycard to very high or low
 temperatures it can fool the scanner of a yellow door and make it open
 for a short period of time. Remember, this is our secret. Don't tell

 Canteen
 This must be the place where the aliens eat. It's a bit small for a
 canteen that is supposed to support the whole crew of a spaceship
 because the only things here are one table and a counter. The complete
 lack of chairs probably means that the aliens always eat standing.

 There are eight coffee cups on the counter and one on the table. They
 all must've been severely addicted to caffeine here.

 There is a yellow door leading to the kitchen to the northeast and a
 red door to the west.

 On the counter is a wine bottle.

 There is a coolbox behind the counter.

 You can also see a vending machine here.

 Behind you, the door closes automatically.

 Lucy: Stop right there! The floor before you is electrified. One step

 keeps your brain alive, inevitably resulting in your death. I apologize
 for the inconvenience, but this is a security measure we had to take to
 avoid the guard robot that went berserk a while ago from reaching the
 rest of the ship. There is a small chance the power supply of that
 robot has not run out yet, so we can't take any risks. Oh, and don't
 try anything stupid, I still need you.

 S.S. Blearch: a space ship of the Great Galactic Army designed for
 collecting primitive barbarian species from different planets so
 research can be conducted upon them. Because it is equipped with the
 Warp Speed 2.0 module by default it sometimes is also used for military
 missions that involve destroying planets, galaxies or universes.

 Warp Speed: a unit used to measure velocity (WS). One warp speed equals

 This must be the place where the aliens eat. It's a bit small for a
 canteen that is supposed to support the whole crew of a spaceship
 because the only things here are one table and a counter. The complete
 lack of chairs probably means that the aliens always eat standing.

 There are eight coffee cups on the counter and one on the table. They
 all must've been severely addicted to caffeine here.

 There is a yellow door leading to the kitchen to the northeast and a
 red door to the west.

 There is a puddle of red wine on the floor

 There is a coolbox behind the counter.

 You can also see a vending machine here.

>open yellow door

>go northeast
 Kitchen
 This has to be the kitchen. It seems they had to cut the budget, the
 only kitchen equipment here is a cabinet with a microwave on it. And
 there is a sink with a garden hose for washing the dishes.

 There is a yellow door to the southwest.

 It smells like laxative here.

 You can see an air vent here.

 Behind you, the door closes automatically.

 Recreation Center
 This has to be room where the aliens come to relax. Calm elevator music
 comes from an invisible speaker. The exit is to the east.

 There is a blue sofa in front of a television here. Next to it is a
 small table.

 A small window gives a glance at the stars.

 You can also see an air duct (empty) here.

 1F Junction
 You are in a hexagonal room. There are three doors here to the north

 There is a button next to the escalator door.

>open yellow door

>go east
 Maze entrance
 This is a hallway continueing north. You can go back to the junction
 south.

 You can see a sign and a purple blob here.

>give prune juice to blob

 The alien grabs the can with one of his tentacle and inspects the
 bottle, probably checking if the prune juice contains any traces of
 laxative. He then throws the whole can in the hole in his "belly",
 after which you hear some strange sounds that could very well come from
 its digestive system.

 Alien: "Ahh, delicious! Hmm... Excuse me, now I've got to powder my
 olfactory organ. Sorry I'm a bad NPC and haven't got any kind of reward
 to repay you."

 The alien grabs a device from his pock... err... materialises a device
 from thin air, looks at its display and quickly moves north. How he
 moves there? Do I have to explain everything? Use your imagination for
 once! Damn... Also, the alien speaking English is not a plot hole. He
 just paid attention at alien school.

 There is a foul odour in the air

 It seems you ended up in the toilet. If you can even call it that,
 since all in this claustrofobical small room is one single urinal and a
 mirror. Apperently the aliens here don't really care about their
 privacy, since there isn't even a door here! You can exit to the west.

 The purple alien is nowhere to be seen.

 On the urinal is a GPS device.

>get gps
 it's covered in you - of course - drop it in the urinal. That activated
 some kind of system that automaticaly flushes it...

 The coffin of the great Prime Commander can only be opened when the
 great magical key, stolen from a far away planet (filled with a nasty
 oxygen-atmosphere and lots of dihydrogen monoxide) in the milky way
 galaxy in the 1970"s, is placed upon this pedestal and lets its
 beautifull red light fall upon the remains of our Great Leader.

 Actually, you liked the graffiti better.

 Dear diary,

 I've been wandering around this maze for hours now. I just met that
 alien guy again and he was so happy with me returning his GPS he gave
 me this empty logbook and a pen. Anyway, today was quite extraordinary:

 You see, I woke up this morning in the spaceship of some kind of
 intelligent extraterrestial life form. I was locked up in a cell but
 luckily I used my wits to get one of them to open the door. He tried to
 attack me but I used my amazing martial arts skills to kick his, and
 his 500 friends', ass. Unfortunately one of them snuck on me from
 behind and sucked my brains out. Some kind of evil computer then
 decided to kill me if I didn't answer its extremely complicated riddle
 right...

 Of course, thanks to my amazing mathematical skills, I did, and after a
 weird mushroom trip I got my brains planted in this awesome killer
 robot. This led to an epic fight of me versus an even larger
 laser-armed gigantic killing machine I easily beat using only a rusty
 crowbar and a radioactive flashlight.

 Oh wait, I think I can see the exit over there. I sometimes have the
 idea that no matter where I go, I always end up there anyway.

 Yours sincerely,

 me

 Please press SPACE to continue.

 Wow, this place is full of bleeping machines, bubbling potions and

 most of the stuff here is fake and just used to give the lab a proper
 atmosphere. The only interesting things are on a table in the center of
 the room. There is a passage to the north and an exit to the west.

 Some kind of room north of the laboratory
 You have no idea what this room was used for, and you really don't
 care. You're standing in front of a huge window. The exit is south.

 Behind the window you can see a dead or at least unconsious human body
 hanging from a metal wire planted in the top of its head. Wait a
 second... That is your body!

 There is some kind of basket on the other side of the window.

 Under the window there are three buttons: a yellow button (with a
 smiley face on it), a red button (with a skull on it) and a green
 button (with a dollar sign on it).

 body, only a lot of bloodstains behind the window.

 For some reason, the basket now is on your side of the window.

 Lucy's voice: Well, well. It seems you have discovered our meat making
 machine we temporarily had to store your body in. Without your body,
 you have no reason to live anymore. So would you please get back here

 same as arm wrestling, but with tentacles.

>change channel to 1

 It's the universe championship of tentacle wrestling. Which is the same
 as arm wrestling, but with tentacles.

>change channel to 2

 It's some kind of alien cooking show:

 "Hello ladies, gentleman and creatures without or with two genders.
 Welcome to cooking on Bgryurgti?rk, where we somehow speak English.
 Today we are going to bake a cake. The required ingredients for
 this..."

 You're currently not planning to make a cake, so you lose interest.

>change channel to 3

 It's the galactic news. It seems that the conflict between Breiwnquaria
 and Erwp has gotten worse, the cheese prices have risen and Venus will
 have some meteor storms next sunday.

>change channel to 4

 Still the same boring arrow, pointing at the air duct.

>change channel to 5

 It's the national broadcaster of Luxembourg. They probably wanted to
 expand their audience.

>change channel to 6

 It's a South-Korean channel dedicated to show online matches of the
 game Starcraft. Maybe alien war strategists watch this because they can
 learn something from the Koreans, or this is just one of the many
 unwanted channels that comes with satallite tv.

>change channel to 7

 It's an infomercial warning for the dangerous effects of laxative. They
 are a little bit too late with that...

>change channel to 8

 A message appears on screen saying that a special subscription is

 Some kind of room north of the laboratory
 You have no idea what this room was used for, and you really don't
 care. You're standing in front of a huge window. The exit is south.

 Behind the window you can see a dead or at least unconsious human body
 hanging from a metal wire planted in the top of its head. Wait a
 second... That is your body!

 There is some kind of basket here.

 Under the window there are three buttons: a yellow button (with a
 smiley face on it), a red button (with a skull on it) and a green
 button (with a dollar sign on it).

 This has to be the kitchen. It seems they had to cut the budget, the

>put blue keycard in slot. put bag on terminal. turn on electromagnet

 Now the display says "Please place your hand or tentacle on the
 terminal so your identity can be confirmed with a DNA check".

 You hear a bleep while the green hand is being scanned.

 The display says "Good day, great Prime Commander. Please let a second
 high ranking officer insert his blue keycard in the card slot. Our
 excuses for the inconvenience, but this safety regulation is required
 in case you go insane and do something like go to planet earth, beam
 yourself down there and blow up this ship".

 With the magnet, you easily draw the keycard out of the card slot.

 You switch off the electromagnet and put the blue keycard in your
 pocket.

>put blue keycard in slot. put tape on terminal

 Now the display says "Please let the secondary officer place his
 tentacle upon this terminal.".

 You hear a bleep while the tentacle hair on the used duct tape is being
 scanned.

 Cockpit
 You are now in the ship's cockpit. There is a nice big window here with
 a great view on the galaxy. After admiring it for a few seconds you
 grow bored and look around in the cockpit. There are no chairs here but
 all kinds of incredibly complicated instruments. Instead of doing
 anything with those you simply decide to use the board computer with a
 seemingly simple interface.

 Subject: Subscription cancelation

 Dear editorial staff,

 Recently, my spies infiltrating the earthly country of Luxembourg have
 discovered some alarming intel regarding the military strenght of an
 organisation that calls itself the Luxembourgian Liberation Front: they
 are easily capable to defeat the whole galactic allience and Great
 Galactic Army and eventually even take over the universe. In order to
 stop this huge thread, we Brukgh?rhcs have decided to destroy the
 universe, so Luxembourg can't conquer it.
 Before we blow up all of existance however, I would like to cancel my
 subscription of the magazine "Gardening on Terraformed Exoplanets",
 because I will no longer be able to pay for it when we're all dead.

 Yours sincerely,
 The Prime Commander of the Brukgh?rhcs

 It's some kind of alien cooking show:

 "Hello ladies, gentleman and creatures without or with two genders.
 Welcome to cooking on Bgryurgti?rk, where we somehow speak English.
 Today we are going to bake a cake. The required ingredients for
 this..."

 You quickly rip out a page out of your diary and write down the recipe:

 How to make a cake:

 Ingredients:
 -Porcelain
 -A drop of red wine
 -Some orange tetra-x-ide
 -Some detergent
 -Iron oxide
 -A few alien hairs
 -Rubber
 -A piece of lead
 -The bone of a homo sapiens
 -Some salt and pepper
 -51 grams of laxative

 -Put everything in a pan and stir.
 -Microwave for 10 minutes (or 3 seconds with laser enabled super
 microwaves) and it's done.

 WARNING: Do not, under any condition, add any additional water.

 You wonder wheter your grandma made them this way as well.

 Recreation Center
 This has to be room where the aliens come to relax. Calm elevator music

 A small window gives a glance at the stars.

 You can also see an air duct (empty) here.

 Kitchen
 This has to be the kitchen. It seems they had to cut the budget, the
 only kitchen equipment here is a cabinet with a microwave on it. And
 there is a sink with a garden hose for washing the dishes.

 There is a yellow door to the southwest.

 It smells like laxative here.

 There is a gooey puddle on the floor next to the sink.

 Canteen
 This must be the place where the aliens eat. It's a bit small for a
 canteen that is supposed to support the whole crew of a spaceship
 because the only things here are one table and a counter. The complete
 lack of chairs probably means that the aliens always eat standing.

 There are eight coffee cups on the counter and one on the table. They
 all must've been severely addicted to caffeine here.

 There is a yellow door leading to the kitchen to the northeast and a
 red door to the west.

 There is a puddle of red wine on the floor

 There is a coolbox behind the counter.

 Wow, this place is full of bleeping machines, bubbling potions and

 the room. There is a passage to the north and an exit to the west.

 On the table are a broken empty flask, a yellow potion, a blue potion

 You are now in the ship's cockpit. There is a nice big window here with
 a great view on the galaxy. After admiring it for a few seconds you
 grow bored and look around in the cockpit. There are no chairs here but

 anything with those you simply decide to use the board computer with a

 Your hometown (Earth)
 You wave goodbye to the S.S. Blearch, which flies away thousands of
 kilometers from earth in a few microseconds. Your new body feels great
 and looks exactly identical to your old one, all thanks to the
 super-advanced alien cloning technology. It's not completely the same
 though: because of the added laser eyes, superhuman strenght, IQ of
 250, immortality and the abilty to move your ears (something you always
 would've wanted to be able to do).

 Well, all this adventuring has made you pretty hungry. You decide to go
 to the local snackbar and eat as much hamburgers as you can pay for
 with the gigantic amount of money that has recently been deposited to
 your bank account. Well okay, that many hamburgers do not exist, but
 you bet your friends will be pretty impressed once you've bought the
 country of Sweden.

 Anyway, you will receive your reward... sometimes in the future. Such a

 so we will not be needing you until then. Have fun in your illusionary

 You feel like all the water in your brain is being replaced with liquid

 North Mushroomland
 You are in a vast green field. There a giant Mushrooms everywhere.

 Money is lying on the ground everywhere. Probably this was the content
 of the crate. Luckily that little blue man isn't interested in it.

 A little blue man with a white hat is walking around and looking at the
 mushrooms.

 Temple of Mushrooms
 Wow, this has to be the St. Peter of the temples dedicated to... err...
 mushrooms, it is huge.

 The east and west walls are full of hieroglyphs.

 In the middle of the temple you see a fountain. Like everything here
 it's mushroom-shaped.

 There is an altar at the end of the hall. There are scales on the
 altar.

>examine altar

 The first one who succeeds in balancing the holy scales without
 removing the rock on the right scale will achieve ultimate happiness,
 ultimate knowledge and ultimate wealth. Beyond all this, you will also
 receive two free tickets to the zoo.

 mushrooms, it is huge.

 The east and west walls are full of hieroglyphs.

 In the middle of the temple you see a fountain. Like everything here
 it's mushroom-shaped.

 There is an altar at the end of the hall. There are scales on the
 altar.

 You can also see a tooth here.
