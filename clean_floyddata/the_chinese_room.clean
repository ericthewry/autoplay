 The Chinese Room began as an idle thought passing through an idle
 mind. Giles, recently become interested in the world of contemporary
 text adventures, restyled as the far classier "interactive fiction",
 was toying with the idea of his writing his own, and suddenly realised
 that some of the staples of genre IF -- escaping from a locked room,
 artificial intelligences, zombies -- were also the staples of the
 thought experiments of his chosen discipline, philosophy. Suddenly, a
 concept arrived fully-formed in his head: a text adventure in which
 the protagonist explored the rich, bizarre and often pointlessly
 stupid world of philosophy thought experiments.

 And that's what this game is. You, a philosophy student, after a night
 imbibing vast quantities of alcohol, wake up trapped in a malevolent
 fantasy universe. You must escape. (Assuming you want to, of course.
 You could just doodle around complaining about the bad jokes.)
 Essentially, the game is just a vehicle for a lot of jokes, but,
 taking its insipiration from the revolutionary philosopher Ludwig
 Wittgenstein ("a serious and good philosophical work could be written
 entirely of jokes"), it's also designed to serve as a sort of
 none-too-serious introduction to the world of philosophy. You'll
 encounter some of the key problems of philosophy in various odd ways,
 and might even be encouraged to explore them a bit further.

 The game was begun in the summer of 06, and then shelved for a frantic
 academic year in which, amongst other things, Giles discovered he
 didn't like studying philosophy that much after all. Somewhat more
 cynical, he returned to IF and the game with an embittered sense of
 humour. He contacted Jones, an erstwhile beta-tester of the original
 version of The Chinese Room and asked if he'd be interested in
 co-authoring. Happily accepting, Jones proceeded to drive the writing
 forward with surrealistic pace, and after a summer of furious writing,
 redrafting and testing, the game was completed at the end of summer
 07, just in time for the annual Interactive Fiction Competition. Now
 it's on your screen for you to play. Gosh.

 A note about the style of gameplay. This is a very big game, and will
 probably take a long time to complete. It is possible to die in this
 game, sometimes suddenly, but usually with warning, and, similarly,
 while it's possible to trap the game in an unwinnable state, you'll
 probably be warned you're about to do it. In terms of style, it's
 heavily-inspired not just by text adventures but also by the LucasArts
 school of point-and-click adventure games -- irreverent, full of
 arcane object puzzle quests, and driven forward by a large cast of
 inane characters. Drawing on early text adventures, it is
 puzzle-driven rather than plot-driven, so suits being dipped in and
 out of. This is not a subtle game. This is a silly game. We hope you
 like it.

 Hey, folks. How's it going?

 This game has extensive informative menus. Feel free to read them. If
 you want to cut the chase and play the game, here's the essential
 stuff you need to know about what kind of game it is and how it works.

 This is a comic adventure set in the fantasy world of philosophy
 thought experiments. It is designed both as a humorous and enjoyable
 text adventure in a reasonably traditional style and as an
 introduction to some of philosophy's key issues, intended to be
 accessible not only to experienced IF players and experienced
 philosophers looking for a bit of fun, but also people with very
 little grounding in either. It is joke- and puzzle-driven, both of
 which range from the accessible to the tough and in-jokey.

 This is a fairly long game, and so may take several play sessions and
 a number of hours to complete. If for some reason, possibly
 judging-related, you've got to evaluate it after two hours of play
 only -- well, that's the way it goes for us over-amibitous writers,
 sadly. You'll likely not have finished it by then. Sorry about that.
 We hope you enjoy finishing it later on, when you do have time,
 though.

 It is possible to die, though only if you make a mistake, which will
 usually be clued. Death is often for comic effect, and can be easily
 undone. In addition, there is a way to trap the game in an unwinnable
 state, and while you can do this only by being a bit foolhardy, it's
 probably a good idea to save before doing anything that looks
 irreversible.

 Conversation is menu-based, initiated by the TALK TO command. The one
 thoughts on the philosophical topic of your choice. This is designed
 both to give philosophical background to the jokes and puzzles of the
 game, and to be a sort of hint system: while none of the game's
 puzzles require philosophical knowledge, a bit of background might
 help to jog your intuitions towards the correct solution. You should
 expect to use THINK ABOUT often, and a complete list of topics is
 available from the menus.

 In addition, there is both a hint system proper, which you should
 stumble on in your searches in the game (more information in menus),
 and a Tutorial for play, which walks through the game's opening
 puzzle. Finally, a walkthrough is available for the length of the
 IFComp 2007 judging period only: it can be found at
 www.danglercomic.com/chineseroom.html. We're doing it this roundabout
 way because neither of us like walkthroughs for various curmudgeonly
 ideological reasons. If you're using the walkthrough because you're a
 judge and want to see a lot of the game, that's cool, you're the
 reason we provided the walkthrough, you may ignore the sarky comments.
 If you're anybody else, then we hold nothing against you personally,
 but we seriously suggest you reconsider your policy on walkthroughs.
 You smelly people.

 Right, that's it. Get playing. Hope you enjoy it.

 Celebrations seem so obscene when a year's been as bad as this one's
 been. Still, hard drinking was the order of the night, and
 obliterating the last vestiges of exam stress was the function it well
 fulfilled. Ethics, aesthetics, logic and metaphysics -- all vanish as
 sense-data succumb to paralytics.

 A few of your lecturers dropped by the Cellar Bar to toast the year
 with their beleaguered students. Even a couple of the more reclusive
 Arch? metaphysicians took a break from exploring possible worlds to
 explore the possibility of getting truly plastered.

 Staggering home blind drunk is one of the little-recognised pleasures
 of the philosopher. You take only a few tumbles, as sodium
 street-lighting carefully guides you to your flat.

 You fumble with the loose doorknob and slump inside, gingerly pulling
 yourself along the grubby carpet to your room, wary of waking a
 flatmate. Collapsing into bed, you wait for the spinning world to
 dissolve around you as you fall into relieved sleep.

 The Chinese Room
 (Note to all first-time players: inexperienced players may wish to
 spend some time reading the About and Help menus, accessible by
 entering the HELP command. All players should absolutely at the least
 read the ESSENTIALS available from the opening menu.)

 You wake up, body aching and head split in two by a hangover. Blinking
 the sleep from your eyes, you roll over, cracking your bones on the
 concrete.

 Concrete? You realise something is very wrong. Pushing yourself to
 your knees, you look around you.

 You find yourself in a strange room. It's a plain concrete box,
 equipped only with desk and chair. A computer sits on the desk,
 casting an insipid electronic glow over a stack of cards sitting by
 the keyboard. There's a slow drip from a damp patch up on the ceiling.
 Some grubby light seeps through a high window across onto the poster
 that dominates an entire wall. Across the top of the poster huge bold
 letters read "THE CHINESE ROOM". Underneath -- a string of Chinese
 characters.

 You have never seen this room before in your life, and the whole
 scenario is entirely beyond your understanding.

 Whereof you cannot speak, thereof you must remain silent, you suppose.

>think about chinese room
 The Chinese Room argument is a thought experiment originally devised
 by John Searle, designed to answer the question (in the negative):
 "Can a computer ever understand language?"

 Imagine a computer that has so complete a set of rules for providing
 Chinese output to Chinese input that it behaves exactly as a human who
 understands Chinese would. Ask it a question in Chinese, and it will
 give an appropriate response in Chinese. It appears do "understand"
 Chinese. But does it?

 Imagine now a human living in a small room, who is given a book
 consisting of a vast set of rules for providing a response in Chinese
 characters for any information ey receive in Chinese characters. Like
 a computer ey will provide appropriate Chinese output to Chinese
 input. The person is analogous to a computer, but does the person
 understand Chinese? It would seem, intuitively, that ey don't.

 The meat of the argument here is to distinguish between syntax, the
 rules by which language is constructed and manipulated, and semantics,
 what language actually means, and then claim that even incredibly
 in-depth knowledge of syntax is not sufficient for semantics -- only
 human-type minds, and not an artificial intelligence, have the
 capability to understand meaning.

 This leads into the debate about what "meaning" actually means. What
 can it be that only human-type minds have? What makes us special? Some
 philosophers, including, perhaps, the creators of the world you now
 find yourself in, would argue that actually all that the mind's
 ability to respond to input actually comprises is an incredibly
 complex set of learned syntactical rules, and that "meaning" separate
 from this is illusory -- so that if one were to learn all the rules
 for Chinese language-manipulation, one would understand that language.

>think about cartesian duality

>examine drip
 There's a damp patch spreading across the ceiling from the hatch at
 one end.

>examine hatch
 It's too high to reach without standing on something, and it's locked.

>examine desk
 A simple affair, with black steel legs and a woodgrain formica
 surface. A drawer is stuck on underneath as an afterthought, like
 chewing-gum. What is interesting is what is on the desk.

>think about zombies
 Philosophical zombies, or pzombies, are another common thought
 experiment in philosophy of mind. They are creations which look and
 behave in every way like people, but which have no conscious
 experience. They raise a huge number of questions: are they possible?
 What is conscious experience? Could a zombie behave like a human
 without conscious experience? Is conscious experience a physical or
 non-physical phenomenon?

 These questions lead into what is known as "the hard problem of
 consciousness", which is: how do we explain subjective (or
 "phenomenal") conscious experience in terms of its neurological basis?
 Is the mind separate from the brain, like a free-floating soul? Is the
 mind a function of the brain, with mental activity caused by brain
 activity? Is the mind and conscious experience as we understand it an
 illusion, with the brain no more than the physical? If the mind is
 caused by the brain, how is it caused, and what is it about the brain
 that causes it?

 The hard problem of consciousness is one of the most perennial
 problems in philosophy, and in the two decades since it was first
 formulated by Richard Chalmers we have made little progress. This had
 led some philosophers, especially postmodern philosophers or followers
 of Wittgenstein, to wonder whether the problem itself arises only from
 a sort of language-game, a particular linguistic conception of the
 mind that has developed over time, especially in the West. Maybe it is
 not consciousness which is illusory, but rather the existence of the
 problem of consciousness!

>open drawer
 Inside the drawer sits a squat, leather-bound manual. It looks even
 more daunting than The Phenomenology of Spirit.

>read manual
 The manual is a thick, leather-bound tome with THE RULES embossed in
 gold on the cover. Inside, you find hundreds and hundreds of rules,
 written in English, for transforming sets of incomprehensible Chinese
 characters into other sets of incomprehensible Chinese characters. You
 can't imagine why.

>get manual
 Taken.

>look up characters in manual
 You discover nothing of interest in the manual.

>transform characters
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>examine cards
 You flick through the cards. Each of them features a number and a set
 of incomprehensible Chinese characters.

>look on desk
 A stack of strange rectangular cards is on the desk. The uppermost one
 features a number and a string of Chinese characters.

>get cards
 What do you want with a bunch of cards like that? Leave them be,
 unless you want to CONSULT something ABOUT them.

>consult manual about cards
 You pick a card and then slowly, meticulously use the rules in the
 manual to generate a new set of chinese characters from the set on the
 card, typing it into the computer. What it all means you can't begin
 to guess, but it passes the time with some harmless mental exercise,
 like a Sudoku puzzle.

>examine computer
 The computer screen displays the set of Chinese characters you just
 typed in, while each of the keyboard buttons features a Chinese
 character, apart from one big one at the bottom marked SEND.

>examine banner
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle
 creators of this world.

>examine poster
 Underneath the title there is a string of Chinese characters.

>type characters
 You'd better deal with the set you already typed in first.

>push send
 The Chinese characters vanish from the screen, and a message saying
 "CORRECT!" flashes up before abruptly vanishing again.

 Well, this is all pretty pointless, and it's not helping you learn
 Chinese.

>type characters
 You press a few random keys, watching the Chinese appear on the
 screen, and then hit SEND. A message flashes up saying "INCORRECT!"
 before promptly vanishing again. Perhaps you ought to approach this
 more systematically.

>translate poster
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>consult manual about poster
 You discover nothing of interest in the manual.

>consult cards about characters
 Just a load of random Chinese symbols
>consult cards about future
 Just a load of random Chinese symbols

 You wish you had a nice book to settle down with, like a Camus novel
 or something.

>take poster
 It would tear!

>think about camus

 Underneath the title there is a string of Chinese characters.

>examine window
 It's high in the wall and far too small to fit through.

>examine string
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle
 creators of this world.

>think about descartes
 Ren? Descartes (1596 - 1650) has become known as the Father of Modern
 Philosopher. A French thinker, his philosophy was founded on sceptical
 rationalism -- he sought to determine what could be rationally proved,
 using a method of extreme scepticism in order to test his beliefs. He
 as attempting to write "as if no-one had written on these matters
 before", and so his philosophy framed a great deal of what came after
 him, ushering in an era of ahistorical analytic philosophy which
 sought to determine the truth of the world.

 You push the chair underneath the hatch. Cunning.

 You stand on the chair. You can see your house from here! Well, you
 can't really, but you can reach the hatch.

>examine hatch
 You can reach the hatch now, and it's locked.

>say open sesame

 Just TALK TO them.

 The kind of grey plastic chair you find in schoolrooms. It sits under
 the hatch.

>examine cards
 You flick through the cards. Each of them features a number and a set

>push send

 In fact, you reckon if you had a book you could learn it off by heart.

>read manual
 The manual is a thick, leather-bound tome with THE RULES embossed in
 gold on the cover. Inside, you find hundreds and hundreds of rules,
 written in English, for transforming sets of incomprehensible Chinese
 characters into other sets of incomprehensible Chinese characters. You
 can't imagine why.

>memorize manual
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

 You set to work learning the entire manual off by heart. After all,
 what else is there to do? Time passes like treacle -- but before you
 know it you have reached the final page. Syntax piles up on syntax in
 your mind, and action potentials blaze new neuronal trails. You feel a
 seismic change has occurred. Glancing at the cards, you realise you
 understand exactly what they mean!

 The only drawback to your newfound powers is that you begin to hear a
 slow whirring growling sound coming up through the floor. You presume
 it is John Searle turning in his grave. You hit upon the bright idea
 of hooking his body up to a generator to solve the world energy
 crisis, but think better of it and set your mind to escaping.

>examine poster
 You can read the poster now! It says "Look in the drawer". Eh?

>look in the drawer
 There's a key in here!

>take key
 What the -- ? It was in here all along?

>ask computer about life
 You can only do that to something animate.

>climb chair
 You're positively climbing up the walls.

 You're already on it!

>unlock hatch
 What do you want to unlock the hatch with?

>key
 Balancing precariously on the chair, you reach up and unlock the
 hatch. It swings open, and fresh air and clean light flood the room.
 Freedom beckons!

>go up
 You haul yourself up through the hatch and scramble onto the roof of
 the Chinese Room, the hatch thudding shut behind you.  Escape!

 Getting to your feet, you are conscious of your jaw dropping wide
 open. A fantastical landscape spreads out around you in every
 direction. You turn around and around, taking in the astonishing
 sights around you -- to the north, a pretty little rural town clambers
 up the wooded hillside; on the east side wide grassy plains spread off
 into the distance, on the west side the sea does likewise, while to
 the south . . . to the south an enormous granite crag towers on the
 countryside, topped by a castle of medieval extravagance.

 A bright sun and blue sky blaze over everything -- in fact, all of the
 colours in this extraordinary vista have a zealous intensity. It all
 feels too, too unreal for words.

 Slowly, as if it were about to vanish into nothingness beneath you,
 you sit down on the roof and raise your exhausted eyes to the sky. You
 let out a small whimper. For above you, flitting happily among the
 fluffy clouds, a flock of enormous flying beasts streaming spaghetti
 soar.

 Roof
 The roof of the Chinese Room is flat and covered with pitch, hot under
 the sun. On the east side of the building, a ladder leads down to the
 road.

 It's a bit sticky, and not, as it turns out, particularly black.

>get pitch
 Philosophers are not yet supermen.

>examine spaghetti
 Huge, noodly and terrifying, the flock of Flying Spaghetti Monsters
 are playing a game of aerial volleyball with their meatballs.

 Roof
 The Chinese Room, you have discovered, is in the centre of a
 fantastical world, on a road leading north to woods and a hillside
 village and south to a cragtop castle. Wide plains spread out to the
 east, grassy dunes and a strip of sand border an ocean to the west,
 and above you Flying Spaghetti Monsters gambol in the updrafts. The
 roof of the Chinese Room is flat and covered with pitch, hot under the
 sun. On the east side of the building, a ladder leads down to the
 road.

>pray
 God is dead.

>think about nietzsche
 Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 - 1900) was a German critical philosopher.
 Using highly artistic prose and an aphrositic style, he wrote
 critiques of the religion, morality, philosophy and society of the
 time, developing over the years a distinctive set of positions which
 helped pave the way for later post-modern critical philosophies.

>pray to fsm
 I only understood you as far as wanting to pray.

 What is it you want to THINK ABOUT?

>think about thinking

>think about thinking

>think about monstes
 Your philosophical studies don't seem to have taught you anything

>go down
 You shimmy down the ladder onto the road.

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 Well, you can only be thankful that there aren't two legs sticking out
 from under the hut, and that the crowds of tiny people appear to have
 neglected to lay on a welcome party.

 There is, however, a scarecrow.

>think about monsters
 The Invisible Pink Unicorn, like the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is a
 popular satirical religious entity. While their use has now expanded
 to encompass all manner of religious satire, the original purpose was
 to point out a common fallacy regarding religious belief and burden of
 proof.

 It has been argued that atheism is an untenable philosophical
 position, as one cannot give a watertight proof for the non-existence
 of a religious entity: how would it be possible to prove that a god
 does not exist? One can only give incomplete arguments in favour of a
 god's non-existence, and so certain atheism is impossible.

 The question asked by the IPU is then, "Well, does that mean that it's
 perfectly justifiable for me to believe in an invisible pink unicorn
 orbiting Saturn? No-one's ever seen it, but I believe in it, and it's
 impossible for you to definitively disprove its existence." Given the
 intuitive ridiculousness of believing in the IPU without evidence,
 this response serves to shift the ground of the debate away from
 requiring atheists to prove an entity's existence with certainty. One
 implication is that we ought not to be looking for certainty, but
 rather for good arguments for likely beliefs; another stronger
 atheistic response is to use this thought experiment to claim that the
 burden of proof for religious entities lies not with the atheist for
 disproving existence but rather the believer for proving existence.
 The question of who holds the burden of proof has become a thorny
 debate.

 Gawky, stuffed, adorned with a fixed expression and with a broom
 handle rammed up its backside. You'd think it were a member of the
 Royal Family if it weren't for the silly hat and cast-off clothing.
 No, wait, hang on . . .

 In any case, you rather wish all that sacking had been put to better
 use than as a body for this wretched thing.

 You jump back as the scarecrow rustles its arms and says, "Aren't you
 going to say hello then?"

>talk to scarecrow
 "Er . . . hello," you say. "I'm sorry, it's just I, um --"

 "Well I'll just bet you ain't never seen a talking scarecrow before?
 Ain't that right? Well dang me if I ain't right. Now tell me, what can
 I do y'for?"

 [1] Um, where am I?

>1
 "You just come out of that little room there, ain't you?" asks the
 scarecrow, as if that settled everything.

 [1] Er, yes.
 [2] Yes, but where am I?

>2
 "Well you're outta the liddle room, ain'tcha? And now, what do you
 think of this liddle land?" The scarecrow looks at you as if he's
 about to hang on your words like a condemned criminal from the
 gallows.

 [1] I don't know, really.
 [2] Well, I don't know, as you won't tell me where it is and it's
 totally weird and I'm really freaked out, actually.
 [3] It's nice.

>2
 "Now don't you be gettin' all cranky now," says the scarecrow, like an
 ornery old farmer dispensing invaluable wisdom, "cause it ain't
 healthy for a nice young adventurer like you. Now, I'll tell you, I'm
 something like the tour guide, as y'say, round these here parts, and
 if you got any questions for me, you just ask me and I'll answer best
 as this little scarecrow can."

 [1] Where the hell am I?
 [2] What's that castle over there?
 [3] What lies north, yonder?
 [4] What lies east?
 [5] What lies west?
 [6] You're not going to start singing about whiling away the hours,
 conferring with the flowers, are you?
 [7] I think I'll just go, actually.

 "I told you that already! Outside-a the liddle room. Anything else?"

 [1] What's that castle over there?

 [4] What lies west?
 [5] You're not going to start singing about whiling away the hours,

 [6] I think I'll just go, actually.

>1
 The scarecrow's straw-stuffed arms snap out of in front of him, and
 his earthy (and deeply irritating) Kansas vowels are replaced by
 ringing, hollow tones saying "I do not know any thing about the
 castle."

 Then his arms relax again and, seemingly oblivious, he says "I do most
 humbly beg your pardon, there, what was that question agin?"

 [1] What lies north, yonder?
 [2] What lies east?
 [3] What lies west?
 [4] You're not going to start singing about whiling away the hours,

 [5] I think I'll just go, actually.

>1
 (Because you've always wanted a chance to justifiably say "yonder",
 and if this isn't it then by Godot nothing ever will be.)

 "Now that's just a little village," says the scarecrow. "Now, I've
 never been there, but I do hear it's a pretty exciting place, with all
 sorts for a young adventurer like yourself to do. But is there
 anything else you want to know before you go?"


 [1] What lies east?
 [2] What lies west?
 [3] You're not going to start singing about whiling away the hours,
 conferring with the flowers, are you?
 [4] I think I'll just go, actually.

>2
 "Nothing but the wide, wide ocean, so far as I know. But I don't know
 much!" The scarecrow swallows an unctuous guffaw. "Anything else?"

 [1] What lies east?
 [2] You're not going to start singing about whiling away the hours,
 conferring with the flowers, are you?
 [3] I think I'll just go, actually.

>1
 "Now them's the wide, wide plains, where they do say the unicorns
 roam." The scarecrow waves his arms about vaguely, the two
 badly-stuffed sackcloth sticks not really up to the task of describing
 the expanse. "But I'm willing to wager that a nice young adventurer
 like you don't believe in unicorns, so I guess you'll be wanting to
 ask about something else."

 [1] No, what was that about unicorns?
 [2] You're not going to start singing about whiling away the hours,
 conferring with the flowers, are you?
 [3] I think I'll just go, actually.

>1
 "Well I don't know nothing about them, excepting that they's both pink
 and invisible, so I hear, but it's bad luck to talk about them so you
 just ask me something else," says the scarecrow sharply.

 [1] You're not going to start singing about whiling away the hours,
 conferring with the flowers, are you?
 [2] I think I'll just go, actually.

>1
 "Now I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about, though I do
 flatter myself I have a splendid singing voice. You like to hear?"

 Without waiting for a response, the scarecrow bursts into a raucous
 rendition of "I Will Survive". One of you at least certainly won't
 unless you interrupt him quickly.

 [1] Shut up!
 [2] No, I think I'll just go, actually!

>1
 The scarecrow stops singing abruptly, looking quite hurt. "Oh," he
 says. "A question, then?"

 [1] I think I'll just go, actually.

>1
 "Right you are, then! You just come back if you want to know anything
 else." He starts to hum quietly to himself, which is only slightly
 less irritating than his talking.

>ask scarecrow about dorothy
 Just TALK TO them.

>think about scarecrow
 Examining the scarecrow reveals two rather odd things about it: while
 acting with at least the appearance a conscious entity, it appears to
 be operated internally by a horde of homunculi, and operated
 externally by radio signals from China.

 It thus seems to be conflating two thought experiments in philosophy
 of mind: both Homunculi-Man and China-Brain. Homunculi-Man behaves
 like an ordinary person, but his brain consists of a huge operating
 station operated by millions of tiny people replicating the processes
 of a brain. China-Brain is controlled externally by the entire nation
 of China, which has organised its people to replicate the functions of
 the brain: instead of neurones firing, the people of China carry
 messages to each other and manipulate data, relaying the results in
 radio signals to the person whose brain is being operated.

 Both arguments seek to debunk a position known as "functionalism"
 which holds that if two things hold the same function, or function in
 exactly the same way, then they are to all purposes the same thing. In
 philosophy of mind, this means that if something operates like a mind
 -- turns the same inputs into the same outputs, then it really is a
 mind. Homunculi-Man and China-Brain seem to show that something is
 missing from this picture -- this is usually argued to be
 "consciousness".

 "Consciousness" can come to be thought of as what is missing from
 China-Brain. What could that be? What is it that we think of the mind
 as having that we think China-Brain -- or, less wildly, a robot with
 artificial intelligence -- lacks? The ability to feel? The ability to
 actually experience the senses subjectively (having "qualia"), rather
 than simply responding to sensory input? Or is consciousness in this
 sense illusory? Or is it something else that's missing from the
 picture of China-Brain?

 It looks like someone took a bunch of straw with em on an LSD trip and
 then threw the result under an elephant.

>get hat
 That's not the part of the scarecrow you're interested in.

 You're about to wrench the scarecrow's pole from the ground to take
 him with you when it starts humming, and you suddenly think better of
 it.

>get clothing
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle
 creators of this world.

>go south
 "Now hey there, I wouldn't be doing that," says the scarecrow.

>take hat
 That's not the part of the scarecrow you're interested in.

>go south
 Ignoring the scarecrow's warning, you confidently stride southward --
 or make to, because instead of confidently striding southward you fall
 flat on your face, cracking your nose off the tarmac.

 Grimacing with pain and spitting grit from your teeth, you try to
 crawl to your feet but find yourself strangely incapacitated. Rolling
 onto your back, you see why -- a tiny little woman, now sitting on
 your knee, has tied your shoelaces together. Reaching down to undo her
 handiwork, you find that, with near invisible speed, she has jumped
 onto your aching nose and nutted you right between the eyes. You fall
 back with a resigned oof.

 "I did warn you now," says the scarecrow. "I reckon it's safe for you
 to untie those shoes, now, Anjeline."

 As you get gingerly to your feet, you catch a flash of Anjeline's
 underskirts as she scrambles up the scarecrow's pole and into his
 stuffing.

>go south
 You're not going to be able to go south just yet, not while Anjeline's
 eyeing you suspiciously from under the scarecrow's hat.

>go north
 You walk along the road towards the village. It's only a short
 distance, but this direct and precise road makes it seem like quite a
 trek, with the sight of the village always straight ahead of you,
 getting bigger by excruciating degrees.

 Eventually, though, you reach the first few village houses.
 Yellow-thatched and cross-timbered, they cluster around the road like
 groups of schoolchildren on a picnic day. And, indeed, there are
 children playing games outside, -- the girls in pink blouses and the
 boys in blue britches -- laughing and clapping and throwing hoops at
 each other. You try not to listen to the actual words of the games
 which, where children are concerned, you find, tend to be more truly
 horrifying than anything the best gothic authors could dream up.

 Something strange, you realise, has happened to the road. Without you
 noticing, it's switched from that black tarmac to a rutted country
 cartway. Then, looking up at the buildings as you walk further into
 the village, you see no more quaint cross-timbering but rather -- a
 modern pavement caf?? A bar, the word "drink" etched in fashionable
 lower-case letters on the window glass? Looking down, you see the road
 has changed again into a paved street. Looking up -- there's a maid in
 a peasant blouse pulling at a water pump! The bar has become a
 ramshackle country tavern!

 Blink. A medieval market village. Blink. A modern cosmpolitan town.
 Blink. Both at once?

 Your mind can't fix on a single image of the village. It seems to be
 every different thing at once, as and when needed. The maid, now in a
 crisp business suit, carries her wooden water pail into a barber shop,
 whose red and white striped pole sticks straight out of a dry stone
 wall. A man in peasant garb emerges from a building with the words
 "Cartesian Theatre" emblazoned above the door in neon letters. And the
 church's spire oscillates between a stone tower, a verdigris spire,
 and a concrete minaret.

 You shake your head furiously, as if this will make reality fix
 itself. You feel terribly ill.

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>go south

 Black Tarmac Road
 By the road stands a scarecrow.

>talk to Anjeline
 You don't really have anything to say to her.

>get Anjeline
 No, she's not your type.

>examine anjeline
 Anjeline lurks beneath the scarecrow's hat. Actually, looking more
 closely, you see several more pairs of little eyes alongside her. With
 the scarecrow grinning at you, you walk around him, suspicious,
 noticing a tiny pair of eyes in each sackcloth nostril, several in his
 sackcloth mouth, and a horde beneath his straw hat. As you come behind
 him you see that what you originally thought was a piece of straw
 poking out from behind is, in fact, a radio aerial. And there's a
 stamp on the sackcloth: "Made in China".

>get aerial
 You reach round the back of the scarecrow and snap his aerial in two.
 His singing winds down in an electronic slur, and his whole body
 droops on the pole. There's a moment of silence, and then, one by one,
 the homunculi tumble out of his stuffing, gathering into a comatose
 heap on the ground.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>get sacking
 You grab a handful of sackcloth and give it a yank, pulling it free
 from the pole. When you empty it of straw what results is a fairly
 serviceable sack, which you fling nonchalantly over your shoulder.

>dismantle scarecrow
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>examine heap
 A pile of tiny unconscious people, who presumably have been acting as
 the scarecrow's brain on radio instructions from China. Presumably. It
 takes a special kind of mind to presume something like that, but a
 philosophy undergraduate certainly has one.

 The scarecrow, now totally inanimate, and with his sacking torn away,
 droops folornly on his pole, while his comatose homunculi lie in a
 heap beneath him.

 The Chinese Room is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long

>examine pump
 You walk up to the water pump in the middle of the street. As you
 approach, the gaggles of carters and fishwives clustered around it
 look at you and start gossipping furiously.

 The pump itself is made of polished and riveted steel, with a gleaming
 handle. There is a brass plaque on it which reads "Intuition Pump
 3000".

>think about pump
 "Intuition Pump" is a term popularised by the philospher Daniel
 Dennett to describe, somewhat pejoratively, philosophy thought
 experiments. All thought experiments, claims Dennett, are written in
 order to get us to pump out a particular intuition, to get us to think
 a particular thing determined by the set-up of the experiment. They're
 not true experiments, where what's interesting is to find out what
 result we'll get from the set-up, but rather rhetorical devices.
 Sometimes they can provide useful analogies, but it's always
 important, says Dennett, to look at the set-up of the intuition pump
 and make sure it's a good analogy, and that we're not being
 manipulated into pumping out an intuition we would't otherwise agree
 with.

>enter church

 Church
 You step inside the church and are hit by a blast of pure serenity.
 The church appears to have made up its mind about its own interior,
 plumping for a simple majesty in stone and wood. As the door creaks
 gracefully closed behind you, you survey your surroundings: the oak
 pews lining the nave, the beautiful arched stone roof, the carved
 pulpit at the head of the church and, behind it, an enormous tapestry
 depicting -- nothing?

 In one of the pews a woman in full bridal gear sits, weeping to
 herself. The priest, standing by the pulpit, is looking at her very
 awkwardly.

>pray
 God is dead.

>examine tapestry
 A monumental effort. It must have taken weeks of work to weave such a
 weight of white.

> x priest
 He's dressed in severe black lightened only by a peculiar pink collar.
 There's an evangelical zeal in his eyes and a furry caterpillar on his
 top lip. It might be a moustache.

>remove tapestry
 (first taking the tapestry)
 Philosophers are not yet supermen.

>examine woman
 She's like a very damp pile of meringues, and she's getting damper by
 the second. She wipes her nose and eyes with a sodden veil.

 A man steps into the church, removes his cycle clips in awkward
 reverence, and walks up the centre of the aisle. He sinks to his knees
 in front of the tapestry, and brings a clenched hand up to his brow.
 Loosening the fist, he draws his hand forward and up, fully extending
 his arm, as if tracing the outline of something extending from his
 forehead. He brings his hand up and down the length several times,
 getting more and more rapid, before letting out a small cry, dropping
 his arms, standing up, bowing and hurriedly leaving the building, the
 oak doors swinging to behind him.

 as your equestrian saviour?"

 [1] No, I don't think so.
 [2] Ye-es . . .
 [3] Invisible pink unicorn?

>3
 "The Invisible Pink Unicorn (Blessed Be Her Holy Hooves) is the
 supreme deity, mistress of all in heaven and earth, creator of time
 and space, and trotter along the High Plains!" His arms raise up to
 the ceiling and his whole body vibrates with a sing-song zeal.

 [1] Er . . . right . . . And you believe that, do you?
 [2] That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

>1
 "I believe, for only She can protect me from the Purple Oyster (Of
 Doom)," he says, sounding the final word like a foghorn on an iceberg.

 [1] You are truly insane.
 [2] Um, OK. Look, I'm struggling a bit here. What evidence do you base
 your faith on?

>2
 "No, unbeliever, you don't understand! Have you proved that She does
 not exist? No, no, thrice no! The burden of proof, my young friend, is
 on you."

 As he speaks you suddenly feel a heavy weight drag your neck down.
 Grappling at your throat, you loop over your head a lengthy leather
 thong at the end of which hangs a mysterious weight. The priest grins
 broadly at you, and suddenly the candlelit church appears dark and
 threatening. You hear thunder rumble outside, and with a backward
 glance stumble out of the doors.

 You are carrying:

>think about sartre
 Jean Paul Sartre (1905 - 1980) was a pioneering French existentialist,
 socialist, public intellectual and literary writer, and has since
 become an icon of philosophy and black coffee. His thought centred
 around concepts of free will and life-defining choice -- he claimed
 that individuals create the meaning of their own lives.

>think about kant
 Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804) was one of the most influential thinkers
 writing towards the end of the Enlightenment. Writing on metaphysics,
 ethics, aesthetics and politics, he ushered in a new critical way of
 approaching philosophy, founded not only on rigorous rationalism, but
 also, most importantly, on the division of the discursively-produced
 "world of appearances" (as it appears to consciousness) and the "world
 in itself (as it is independent of consciosuness). His philosophy
 defined the terms of the debate which has followed ever since. It's
 also famed for being some of the densest and most impenetrably-written
 of philosophy -- which probably only serves to enhance its reputation
 due to the small number of people who actually understand it.

>think about socrates
 Socrates  (c. 470 BC - c. 399 BC) was an early Greek philosopher, the
 teacher of Aristotle, who founded many of the subjects and methods of
 Western philosophy. The Socratic method of constant and persistent
 questioning of assumptions remains a driving force of philosophy. He
 wrote down none of his own philosophy, and so his works and (highly
 dramatic) life are known to us only through his pupils, especially
 Plato, his contemporaries, and historians.

>think about hegel
 Georg Hegel (1770 - 1831) was one of the most important of the German
 idealists. Writing on culture and politics, he developed a particular
 dialectical philosophy, a philosophy of progress, with influential
 thoughts on freedom, art, history and morality.

 Renaissance rediscovery of Plato.

 Pavement Caf?
 The caf? spills out into the street. Steel chairs are scattered around
 the serving kiosk, apparently chaotically, though you suspect there's
 a cynical art to it. Most of the customers are buried in books,
 thimble-sized cups of black coffee steaming by them and handmade
 cigarettes rolling around the corners of their mouths. Some of them,
 though, are intense young couples clasping hands across their plates,
 boring into each other's eyes as if looking for some flaw, breaking
 the gaze only to toss hair or adjust a beret. Sitting in the corner,
 Jean-Paul Sartre surveys the caf? around him and smiles in a satisfied
 yet enigmatic way.

 A willowy young server stands behind the kiosk, smiling in a way that
 makes you want to know her better.

>talk to server
 You smile at the server and say, "Hello".

 "Hello," she replies.

 Well, that's that off to a good start.

 Lighting a cigarette, she mutters at you bitterly, "Fresh summer

>think about burden
 The Invisible Pink Unicorn, like the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is a
 popular satirical religious entity. While their use has now expanded
 to encompass all manner of religious satire, the original purpose was
 to point out a common fallacy regarding religious belief and burden of
 proof.

 It has been argued that atheism is an untenable philosophical
 position, as one cannot give a watertight proof for the non-existence
 of a religious entity: how would it be possible to prove that a god
 does not exist? One can only give incomplete arguments in favour of a
 god's non-existence, and so certain atheism is impossible.

 The question asked by the IPU is then, "Well, does that mean that it's
 perfectly justifiable for me to believe in an invisible pink unicorn
 orbiting Saturn? No-one's ever seen it, but I believe in it, and it's
 impossible for you to definitively disprove its existence." Given the
 intuitive ridiculousness of believing in the IPU without evidence,
 this response serves to shift the ground of the debate away from
 requiring atheists to prove an entity's existence with certainty. One
 implication is that we ought not to be looking for certainty, but
 rather for good arguments for likely beliefs; another stronger
 atheistic response is to use this thought experiment to claim that the
 burden of proof for religious entities lies not with the atheist for
 disproving existence but rather the believer for proving existence.
 The question of who holds the burden of proof has become a thorny
 debate.

 Pavement Caf?
 The caf? spills out into the street. Steel chairs are scattered around
 the serving kiosk, apparently chaotically, though you suspect there's
 a cynical art to it. Most of the customers are buried in books,
 thimble-sized cups of black coffee steaming by them and handmade
 cigarettes rolling around the corners of their mouths. Some of them,
 though, are intense young couples clasping hands across their plates,
 boring into each other's eyes as if looking for some flaw, breaking
 the gaze only to toss hair or adjust a beret. Sitting in the corner,
 Jean-Paul Sartre surveys the caf? around him and smiles in a satisfied
 yet enigmatic way.

 The server is clattering away in the kitchen behind the kiosk, making
 loud sweary noises.

 It's built from the same simple-yet-elegant brushed steel as the
 chairs, and it stands outside a building which presumably houses the

>think about heidegger
 Martin Heidegger (1889 - 1976) was one of the founders of
 phenomenology, the critical philosophy which, roughly speaking,
 explores the holistically-located meaning and being of things, rather
 than the analytically-defined nature of things. Whatever that means.
 He helped usher in the academic divide between "Continental" and
 "Anglo-American" philosophy which, based on that difference, still
 exists today.

>think about phenomenology
 Your philosophical studies don't seem to have taught you anything

>think about david hume
 David Hume (1711 - 1776) was the foremost philosopher of the Scottish
 Enlightenment. Following fellow British philosophers Locke and
 Berkeley, he popularised philosophical empiricism (as opposed to the
 rationalism of Descartes and Spinoza), and was also influential in
 thought on free will and ethics. He was an important influence on the
 thought of Immanuel Kant, whom he "woke from his dogmatic slumber" --
 Kant's work can be seen as overturning the divide between the
 rationalists and empiricists.

>wake
 If only it were that simple.

>xyzzy
 A hollow voice says, "There are no obligatory Adventure references in
 this game."

 There is a long pause.

 "Oh, bugger."

>think about categorical imperative
 The Categorical Imperative is to "Act only according to that maxim
 whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a
 universal law." It is the key principle of Kant's deontological
 ethics, which can't really be summed up, but if they can be, they can
 be summed up as follows:

 In order for acts to be judged on ethical grounds, they must be freely
 chosen. In order for an act to be freely chosen, it must be rationally
 chosen, as only rationality liberates us from the brute chains of
 natural causality. But in order for a choice to be rational, it must
 be universalisable -- we must be able to imagine that choice being
 made by everyone in the same situation, without undermining its own
 foundations. Thus, for example, to put it roughly, we must never
 steal, because is everyone stole no-one would be able to steal, so the
 act cannot be rationally undertaken -- it always undermines itself.

 That may not be entirely clear. Like much of Kant's philosophy,
 deontological ethics are hard to understand, and you're not sure
 you've remembered your studies properly. One thing sticks in your
 mind, though: according to Kant, there are no moral dilemmas in
 deontological ethics as, without having to make any calculations, the
 proper application of the Categorical Imperative will always determine
 definitively what is ethical and what is not.

>think about descartes
 Ren? Descartes (1596 - 1650) has become known as the Father of Modern
 Philosopher. A French thinker, his philosophy was founded on sceptical
 rationalism -- he sought to determine what could be rationally proved,
 using a method of extreme scepticism in order to test his beliefs. He
 as attempting to write "as if no-one had written on these matters
 before", and so his philosophy framed a great deal of what came after
 him, ushering in an era of ahistorical analytic philosophy which
 sought to determine the truth of the world.

>think about cave
 The analogy of the cave is one of the earliest and most elegant of
 philosophical analogies. In it, Plato compares humans to prisoners
 trapped in a cave, behind whom is an enormous fire, between them and
 which is a walkway on which pass various people, animals and other
 things of the world. All the prisoners ever see is the shadow of those
 things passing along the walkway. The prisoners come to name these
 shadows, and judge each other by the quality of their naming.

 What Plato is trying to imply is that everything we as humans perceive
 is a representation -- and that all our reasoning is reasoning about
 these representations. Plato imagines that beyond the world of
 representations is the world of forms -- ideals of objects. Thus, for
 example, every philosopher is a pale reflection of the ideal
 philosopher in the world of forms. Thi idea of the relationship
 between ideal and representation extends into every discipline of
 philosophy for Plato -- in aesthetics, for example, we can see the pot
 a potter makes as a representation of the pot he imagined, which is
 itself a representation of the ideal pot, and which itself might be
 represented by a painting of a pot -- each step, for Plato, is a step
 away from the ideal, and for Plato philosophy became, in a sense, a
 question for the ideal forms of ideas.

 The analogy of the cave continues, however. Imagine a prisoner who is
 freed and who sees the light of the fire, the sun. He would be blinded
 by it, completely overcome by his enlightenment. Imagine then that he
 were forcibly chained down with the rest of the prisoners again. How
 would he fare in the naming game? Plato suggests that he'd no longer
 be able to play -- his enlightenment was such that the darkness of the
 cave would now blind him as well; enlightened, he could no longer
 dully represent the representation by naming the shadow.

 Platonic idealism reverberates throughout Western philosophy -- but
 this touch on ideas of enlightenment exists also in Eastern
 philosophy. How are the enlightened to reveal their knowledge to us?
 How can the enlightened represent the truth? This, perhaps, is the
 deepest question of philosophy.

>enter tavern

 Tavern
 You duck as you enter the smoky tavern (evidently smoking bans do not
 exist in thought experiments), and are greeted by an astonishing
 sight:

 A raucous rabble of eminent philosophers line the tables and bar,
 discussing matters squifflily with slurred syllables and questionable
 eloquence. You overhear Plato and Socrates quietly discussing
 anarchists in Victorian literature. The only one not joining in seems
 to be Aristotle, who is sitting glumly in the corner. You also suspect
 that that was John Stuart Mill you glimpsed running east through the
 back door, clutching his stomach.

 Somewhat incongruously, you spot an electronic games machine sitting
 against the wall next to a rather glum looking booth, being rather
 neglected by the roistering philosophers.

>examine machine
 It's a brightly covered cabinet with "Karl Popper's FALSIFICATION

 could possibly be for.

>play adventure
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>hit start
 You consider taking all your frustration out on the innocent, but your
 anger soon subsides.

>press start
 The game machine springs into life. You are controlling a
 falsification gun, moving left and right across the bottom of the
 screen, protecting the collective conscious from a marauding band of
 theories. The theories -- rendered as implausible pixelated blobs --
 are advancing slowly down the screen in.

 Yanking the joystick to and fro, you fire off a volley of pixelated
 falsifiers. A pixelated bullet representing the measurement of
 Mercury's orbit hits the pixelated blob representing Newtonian
 Physics, and it explodes in a shower of pixelated sparks! Reflexes
 burning, you quickly dispatch the pixelated blob representing gender
 essentialism with pixelated bullet representing a well-aimed copy of
 Foucault's History of Sexuality, while a pixelated bullet representing
 Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does for the pixelated blob
 representing General Relativity. Suddenly the machine emits a warbling
 siren, and a pixelated missile representing dialectical materialism
 appears at the top of the screen! You fire volley after volley of
 pixelated bullets at it, but it simply absorbs your attacks as part of
 its pixelated interpretive schema. At the last moment you take cover
 behind a pixelated wall of healthy scepticism, which is sorely
 damaged, but destroys the pixelated missile! As you breathe a sigh of
 relief, taking your eyes off the screen for a moment, a second
 pixelated missile representing Freudian psychodynamic theory
 penetrates through your pixelated defences and obliterates you
 entirely.

 You didn't even make the high score table.

 of women sitting in it, staring melancholically into their drinks. One
 of them, whom you suddenly recognise to be Elizabeth Anscombe, is
 wearing a comic headband with two antennae on springs attached. Next
 to her sits Emma Goldman, glaring fiercely across the table at an
 equally glaring Ayn Rand, while the quartet is completed by Judith
 Butler, who surveys the roistering men, making small tutting noises.

>talk to aristotle
 You saunter over to the corner of the room where Aristotle sits, and
 he glances up at you, a hopeful look passing over his bearded
 features. When he speaks you expect it to be all Greek to you, but in
 fact he sounds more like a lower-upper-middle-class English gentleman.
 "Good day to you," he says impeccably. "Perhaps you might be able to
 help me with some small trouble?"

 [1] Actually, no. I'm fed up with running errands for strange men.
 [2] It would be my pleasure.
 [3] Hmm, what do I get out of it?

>3
 "Well, I suppose I could see my way to parting with a rather fine
 first edition of the complete works of my mentor, Plato," he offers,
 with a tone of slight regret. "After all, if material gain is on your
 mind, then it is best to accompany it with the higher pleasures of the
 intellect."

 [1] Sounds lovely. I'll help you out
 [2] Actually, I think I'll pass.

>1
 "Good show, old thing," he says, smiling broadly. "Now listen
 carefully: to put it quite frankly, I'm buggered for a bottle."

 [1] Did I understand you right . . .
 [2] Surely, they serve bottles here?
 [3] I'm having no more of this sort of thing.

>1
 "What I mean is that I'm after a good quality wine. More precisely, my
 tastes are such that I really can't stand anything other than a bottle
 of pre-phylloxera claret."

 [1] Won't a normal claret do?
 [2] That's impossible. I'm going to leave you to your vain quest.

>1
 "No!" he states emphatically, "I won't have any of the paltry excuse
 for claret they serve here. It's pre-phylloxera claret or nothing."

 [1] Then it's going to have to be nothing . . .
 [2] Alright, then. I'll go find a bottle, shall I? There's nothing I
 like more than going on obscure object quests, after all.

>2
 "Capital!" he exclaims enthusiastically. "Well then, what I'm after is
 a bottle of the finest pre-phylloxera claret. Only the best for the
 old tastebuds, eh?"

 You stare at the old philosopher, wondering several things, most
 prominently of which is what phylloxera are, and whether they involve
 sex in any way. But Aristotle merely smiles beningly at you. "Chop
 chop!" he says, and you take your leave.

>think about aristotle
 Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, taught
 by Plato. He wrote on a huge range of philosophical subjects,
 including disciplines like physics and biology which later grew into
 their own sciences. Preserved for centuries, mainly by Muslim
 scholars, his work later exercised so much influence over the
 Medieveal Christian philosophers who helped found the European
 tradition of thought that he simply became known as the Philosopher.

>think about infocom

>think about godel
 Kurt G?del (1906 - 1978) was an Austrian-American mathematician whose
 work on self-reference the limits of knowledge broke new ground in
 philosophy. G?del developed sound and sophisticated mathematical
 proofs that for any sufficiently complicated epistemological system,
 there would always be certain undecidable propositions --
 demonstrating effectively that knowledge is inherently self-limiting.
 His conclusions have huge repurcussions we are still struggling with
 today.

>think about neurath
 The Ship of Neurath is the term used by W.V.O. Quine in his decription
 of an analogy by Otto Neurath for his view of the holistic nature of
 language and scientific verification. Quine wrote, "We are like
 sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never
 able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new
 one must at once be put therre, and for this the rest of the ship is
 used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the
 ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction."

 The point being made is that we are never able to start a new system
 of knowledge (and thus a system of language) from the beginning --
 what we instead do is replace old known principles which we no longer
 agree with with new principles, insofar as those new principles can be
 supported by the rest of the system of knowledge. Perhaps those new
 principles will weaken another part of the system, which must then
 itself be removed and replaced. This is Quine's view of how knowledge
 progresses and language changes -- gradually, by replacing parts of
 the holistic system, rather than in huge revolutions. One of the most
 important aspects of this view is its characterisation of knowledge as
 a holistic system, rather than as a set of disconnected principles.

 It may or may not be complete coincidence that a strikingly similar
 analogy, known as the Ship of Theseus, is used for a completely
 different philosophical problem: that of identity. That's definitely
 worth thinking about.

 "You've probably got the formulae by now," says Quine. "So I got three
 cups this time. One on the left, one in the middle and one on the

 blue. And we got us some rules again:

 "Rule one: no red bead can be to the left of a blue bead.

 "Rule two: no blue bead can be in a cup next to a cup with another
 blue bead.

 "Rule three: there is at least one blue bead and one red bead.

 "So, what colour beads are in what cup?

 It's a dark and lonely corner of the tavern -- and you realise that,
 while you'd previously thought it was empty, there's actually a group
 of women sitting in it, staring melancholically into their drinks. One
 of them, whom you suddenly recognise to be Elizabeth Anscombe, is
 wearing a comic headband with two antennae on springs attached. Next
 to her sits Emma Goldman, glaring fiercely across the table at an
 equally glaring Ayn Rand, while the quartet is completed by Judith
 Butler, who surveys the roistering men, making small tutting noises.

>talk to anscombe
 The women look at you. "Hello," says Anscombe. "We were having a

 such implacable mourning.

 [1] Were? What happened?
 [2] Well, you lot are glum. Why aren't you joining the fun?
 [3] Mind if I join you ladies for a drink?

 Rand perks up at this point, eyes flaring. "Emma here," she says,
 snering, "couldn't keep her big mouth shut."

 "Don't you go curtailing my freedom of speech again, Ayn," spits
 Goldman in reply.

 "They have entrenched themselves within a political binary through
 which they define themselves by opposition to the Other," chips in

 [3] So why didn't you just leave them to it and join the rest of the
 party here?

 "She started spouting off about the dynamism of the revolution --"
 starts Rand.

 "-- It is easier to condemn than to think," Goldman butts in.

 "Shut up and finish your drinks before I clunk your heads together,"
 concludes Anscombe.

 [1] Why didn't you just leave them to it and join the rest of the
 party here?
 [2] Oh dear. I think I'll just leave now.

 "They wouldn't let us join in," says Anscombe.

 [3] Right. So why are you still here?
 [4] OK . . . I think that's my cue to leave.

 "If I can't dance . . ." begins Goldman, in a rather loud voice,
 before being rapidly gagged by the other three women until she stops
 struggling.

 [2] Phew. So why are you still here?
 [3] Oh dear. I think I'll just leave now.

 cigarettes rolling around the corners of their mouths. Some of them,

 boring into each other's eyes as if looking for some flaw, breaking

 moustachios, and beams. "Have a seat!" he cries, "Have a seat! I shall
 be with you in two snips of a flea's whiskers!"

 You sit down on a wooden bench, somewhat overcome, and look around
 you. A small stand by the bench has complimentary phials of dye. The
 walls are covered with pictures of extraordinarily-coiffured models of
 all ages and genders, while the floor in places is ankledeep in hair.
 The room itself is spacious, and the barber is snipping away happily
 at his client -- who, you suddenly realise, is stunningly, shiningly
 bald.

 [3] Oh, really. Well, you won't mind if I just sod off then.

 "Jus' some gossip down the village water pump," he explains. "Which is

 The barber looks at you slyly. "That's-a for me not to know and you to
 find out," he says, winking. "But it's-a probably been caused by the
 hyperreal causality of narrative metaphor propelling you through a
 tear in the fabric of the space-time continuum, caused either by a

 There's a moment of potent silence as the king looks pointedly at the
 scissors, and the barber resumes his snipping, muttering under his
 breath. You can barely make it out, but it sounds like a dire warning,

 Fairytale Woods
 Heading out on a track west from the village street, you soon come
 across the picturesque fairytale woods that had seemed so pleasant
 from a distance. Up close the uniformity of colour and the crude blobs
 of green on brown are somewhat unsettling.

 In the midst of the woods stand a Buddhist monk and a lumberjack
 engaged in a heated discussion as to whether a tree falling down in a
 forest makes a sound if nobody is around to hear it. Their debate is
 punctuated by the occasional felling of a tree at the blade of the
 lumberjack's axe.

 The woods become more sinister looking to the west and the village
 street is back to the east.

>think about koan
 Your philosophical studies don't seem to have taught you anything
 about that.

>talk to monk
 ". . . now listen here, don't be a dosh-garned fool," the lumberjack
 is saying as you approach, "-- of course the tree makes a sound when
 it falls down. Why, the sound permatriculates no matter who is
 listening."

 "I am afraid," says the Buddhist monk, evidently not at all afraid,
 "that you haven't thought this over enough. After all, how do you know
 it makes a sound if no one is there to hear it?"

 [1] Can my philosophical know-how help you resolve this tricky issue?
 [2] Do you mind if I borrow that axe, Ms Lumberjack, sir?
 [3] I'm not going to get involved in further silliness. . .

>1
 "I do not believe so," the monk says bowing his head slightly, "the
 logical net you seek to cast across the world, neither of us care for
 it -- though for different reasons I do assure you."

 [1] What reasons are these?
 [2] Look, I know the answer -- I can resolve this straight away.
 [3] Oh, never mind. . .

>1
 "I'll tell you one good reason," the lumberjack offers, "no kind of
 philosophistrical trap-clap will convince me that a falling tree don't
 make no sound. Now let me tell you one thing," she says, preceding to
 tell you two things, "I've seen more trees fall down than you've had
 hot dinners and they all make a 'creak . . . creak . . . creaaaakkk! .
 . . whumph!! . . . thud!!!' sound as they go."

 The Buddhist looks unconvinced.

 [1] I agree with you, Ms Lumberjack -- the tree does make a sound.
 [2] Nonsense. The tree makes no such sound if no one's there.
 [3] I don't think it's something we can really know.

>3
 You explain that it is perpetually undetermined -- it is only decided
 one way or the other when there is an observer. You can only tell if
 the tree is making a sound if you are present, and you being present
 decides the fact that it makes a sound. Before you are there the sound
 exists only in potential.

 "That's what I've been trying to explain to my wood-cutting associate
 here," says the Buddhist, "but she simply will not listen."

 The lumberjack shakes her head in dismay, saying, "That's the biggest
 load of nonsensication that I ever did hear."

 [1] Is there not some way I might convince you of this?
 [2] I'll just leave you two too it, shall I?

>1
 The Buddhist monk seems to think on the matter for a few moments.
 Finally, he begins: "My tree-felling friend's chief argument seems to
 rest upon the supposed fact that a sound is always made whenever a
 tree is felled. If this premise were undermined then perhaps we would
 come to some resolution."

 Before you  ask him how this might be achieved he continues: "Perhaps
 you could create a situation in which a tree is felled and she does
 not hear a sound.

 You decide to leave the pair to their discussion until you can find a

 Spooky Part of the Woods
 You head further to the west until you reach a dead-end of brambles,
 bracken and blackened lightning-struck trees. You hear a raven caw
 malevolently in the middle distance and a damp shiver sneaks down your
 spine.

 Turning east you can just about make out happier looking trees. All
 that you can see in this part of the woods is a mess of brambles.

 You swear you just heard one of the trees stifle a cough.

>talk to tree
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle

 "Oi! Over here!" shouts someone behind you. You look around -- but
 there's nothing but trees.

 You nearly jump out of your skin as a tree behind you makes spooky

>examine brambles
 The brambles spiral in a spiky and heavily-stylised manner around the
 base of the lightning-struck trees, surrounded by cloying bracken.
 Peering closely, you can just about make out a rocky formation beyond
 the brambles.

 Was that a tree you just heard mumble under its breath? It seemed
 terribly rude.

 THE SHIP OF NEURATH

 Take a cruise upon the fabulous Ship of Neurath. Let your sense-data
 be amazed as the ship is reconstructed before your very eyes. In the
 words of V.W.O. Quine:

 "Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and
 for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by
 using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely
 anew, but only by gradual reconstruction."

 The ship sails annually across the dark ocean without shores or
 lighthouses, strewn with many a philosophic wreck.

 You nearly jump out of your skin as a tree behind you makes spooky
 ghost noises.

 Getting ripped to shreds by malicious-looking herbage isn't your idea

 Although they are mere lumps of carbon they seem ill-meaning and
 twisted. Indeed, their knots and gnarls, from particular angles, seem
 to form faces, complete with eyes, noses and mouths. You swear one of
 them just winked at you.

 You nearly jump out of your skin as a tree behind you makes spooky
 ghost noises.

>talk to trees
 You look at the trees with suspicion.

 [1] Hello?
 [2] (leave the tree alone)

>1
 "You know, talking to trees is probably a sign of madness," say the
 trees, conversationally.

 [1] I don't think that applies when the tree talks back.
 [2] Talking trees? What's next? Lichen that whistle show tunes?

>1
 "You know, trees don't actually talk," the trees reply. The voice is
 rather high-pitched.

 [1] I think that the evidence shows that they do.
 [2] You're probably right.

>1
 "A bloody empiricist are you now?" the trees say, with a little cawing
 sound.

 [1] Hey! What have you got against empiricists?
 [2] That's rich coming from a group of trees.
 [3] Well it's true -- apparently some trees can talk.
 [4] Unless my senses deceive me . . .

 "No," the trees say with what sounds like a ruffle of feathers.

 [1] Trees don't caw or ruffle feathers. You're no tree at all, are

 [2] Are you some sort of bird hiding amidst the trees?
 [3] Your smooth-talking ways don't fool me, Sen?r Tree!

>3
 "Oh alright," says a voice from amidst the trees, "you've got me, I'm
 not a tree, or several trees for that matter."

 From behind the trees hops a curious looking raven. The raven is
 strange in two ways. Firstly, it has a rainbow plumage. Secondly, it
 can talk.

 [1] So, do you come here often?
 [2] Like the plumage -- very colourful.
 [3] Do ravens often talk?
 [4] Do you know anyway past all this bramble?

>2
 "Do you?" the raven implores, "I hate it. Hate it. Hate it. Hate it.
 None of the other ravens will go near me. I wish I could be rid of it
 once and for all."

 [1] So, do you come here often?

 "Lately, I've been coming here a little more often than I used to,"

 The raven cocks its head to one side, "Maybe . . ."

 [1] Maybe? Maybe you could tell me then?

 The raven cocks its head to the other side, "Maybe . . ."

 [1] Maybe if I go on some inane quest for you?

 "Maybe if you find me some way of turning my plumage black like the
 other ravens?"

 [1] Super! That's exactly what I wanted to do with my day.
 [2] Oh alright. It's probably inevitable anyway.
 [3] No way, Jos?. Why don't you help me first?

 Fairytale Woods
 In the midst of the woods stand a Buddhist monk and a lumberjack
 engaged in a heated discussion as to whether a tree falling down in a
 forest makes a sound if nobody is around to hear it. Their debate is
 punctuated by the occasional felling of a tree at the blade of the
 lumberjack's axe.

 The woods become more sinister looking to the west and the village
 street is back to the east.

>ask lumberjack for axe
 Your command falls on deaf ears. Perhaps you should TALK TO them about
 it?

>go east

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>give burden to unicorn

>go east

 Hill
 You make your way along the cobbled path leading east of the village
 to the hills beyond. The path begins winding up the hill steeply, but
 just as you find yourself out of breath from the climb, you find the
 path levelling out. Then, just as you start finding the leisurely walk
 a little dull, the path steepens again into a challenging climb.
 Finally, just as you wish you could reach wherever it is you're headed
 next in this disconcerting fantasy world, you crest the hill. In the
 way that happens too often here, you are met by a complete
 non-sequiteur of a situation.

 There's a great pyre here very slowly catching alight. Tied to a stake
 in the centre of the fire is a handsome woman looking deeply
 determined, though you suppose she'd look less composed if the fire
 wasn't so pitifully poor. At the base of the pyre, an imposing,
 bushy-bearded man in an ornate uniform is interrogating her intensely,
 in a way that appears to be making her all the more resolute.

 From here, you could head west, back to the village, or further into
 the hills to the north.

>talk to man
 "Who the devil are you, and what are you doing to that poor woman?"
 you greet the man forcefully.

 He turns to you and declaims, with the light of madness in his eyes,
 "I be the Zombiefinder General!"

 [1] Right. And what are you doing to that poor woman?
 [2] Right. And what exactly is a Zombiefinder General?

>1
 "What, her?" he asks, gesticulating furiously at the bored-looking
 woman. "She be no woman! She be a zombie -- and she will not confess!

 [1] Perhaps she bain't, sorry, isn't a zombie.
 [2] Fair cop.

>1
 He cuts you off saying, "That be exactly what a zombie would say!"

 [1] Surely, if she confesses to being a zombie you will kill her.
 [2] You're probably right. I'll just leave you to it then...

>1
 "Of course!" he says with relish. "But I'd do it humanely -- Splash
 her with some holy sauce, no problem."

 [1] Would that harm a non-zombie?
 [2] Not holy sauce! You fiend!
 [3] Sounds reasonable. I'll be sidling off now.

>1
 "It might be harming their best dinner jacket," he muses. "And perhaps
 their wallet when they get the dry cleaning bill. Other than that,
 no."

 [1] Then why don't you just do that to her anyway?
 [2] I can understand now why it would be a cruel and unusual to
 subject someone to that.

>1
 "That be defeating the whole point of a fair interrogation!" he says
 with exasperation. "I can't just go about applying punishment all over
 the place without proof, no matter the benefit. The whole institution
 of justice would break down -- and such an institution be generally
 maximisin' well-bein' more than the well-bein' caused by breakin' the
 rules in particular instances."

 [1] I don't think breaking the rule this time will erode the
 principles of justice.
 [2] Ah, you are of course absolutely correct.

>1
 He looks at you scornfully, "It starts off with a few people sayin'
 'Oh, Justice won't suddenly break down if you pour some Arrabbiata
 sauce on some girl that may otherwise burn to death' -- but it's a
 slippery slope! Soon you'll be wantin' to routinely sauce people up
 before they get on flights, or shake a little holy parmesan at them
 when they go to the library. I may be a Zombiefinder General, but even
 I wouldn't want an erosion of civil liberties to come about through
 the war against zombies."

 [1] (give up)
 [2] You've convinced me! I'll be off now.
 [3] Surely burning at the stake is an erosion of civil liberties?

>3
 He seems to have already thought long and hard about this issue, and
 replies instantly, "Burning at the stake is already an erosion of
 civil liberties and I be going to try as hard as I can to prevent
 future erosions. Now, please be on your way." He shoos you along,
 having tired of the conversation.

 [1] (leave)

>1
 The Zombiehunter glares at you from beneath his orange eyebrows.

 [1] Incidentally, what exactly is a Zombiehunter General?

>1
 "It means," he growls, "That I find zombies. Have you seen any
 zombies, perchance?"

 [1] No, I don't think so.
 [2] Why do you ask?

>2
 "That village down there is crawling with the buggers," he replies
 gruffly. "Zombieing all over the place, them and their qualia-free
 brains."

 [1] What do you want me to do about it?
 [2] Let me guess -- you want me to find the zombies?

>1
 "I would like you to retire the zombies," he says. "You know, remove
 them from action."

 [1] How would I go about doing that?
 [2] Sounds like a plan. I'll get right to it.

>1
 "Give it a good hacking over the head with a sharp implement," he
 explains, gesturing violently in a way that makes you take a step
 back. "That should do the trick. I'd recommend holy sauce, but it be a
 tad expensive and goes off quickly."

 [1] I'll get right on it.

>1
 "Do not tarry!" he shouts, "Go retire some zombies!"

>talk to woman
 You stare up at the woman tied to the stake. She is dressed in white,
 below her torso is wreathed in smoke like some melodramatic rendition
 of a vengeful god.

 [1] Are you alright, love?
 [2] You know, smoking is an awful habit.
 [3] Is this some sort of new-age skin treatment?

>3
 "No," she replies, shaking her head, "it's actually quite a
 traditional method of treatment. It's good both for the skin and also
 for confessions. It was once quite popular with Catholics in Spain and
 has celebrity endorsement from Joan of Arc."

 [1] You're taking this all remarkably well.
 [2] So, why exactly are you burning away here?
 [3] Now that you've tried it, would you recommend it to a friend?

>3
 She seems to give the issue some thought. "It certainly has its
 benefits, but I'm not sure I would have opted for this particular
 treatment were it offered as optional."

 [1] I suppose your skin is good already. It's one of your many
 qualities...
 [2] So, how did this situation come about?

>1
 Her face takes on a look that can be found on thumb-twiddlers,
 hair-fiddlers and feet-shufflers everywhere. "Um . . ." she begins, "I
 don't so much possess qualities, as act in a wholly consistent
 manner."

 [1] That's nice. So, how did you get here?
 [2] On a slightly different note -- why are you burning on this stake?

>1
 "That's a good question. It all started three weeks ago when . . ."
 Two long hours pass. ". . . and then he tied me up here and now he's
 trying to make me confess to being a zombie."

 [1] Are you a zombie?
 [2] What happens if you confess?
 [3] And it wouldn't be consistent to lie and confess to something you
 hadn't done?

>1
 She looks about herself and says, "Not last time I checked."

 [1] So what would happen if you confessed?
 [2] Oh. I was excited there for a moment...

>2
 "I'm sorry to disappoint you . . ." she starts, but you've heard the
 condolence speech too many times to pay attention to the rest. All you
 pick up on is the word "consistent" peppered liberally throughout.

 [1] So . . . what would happen if you wanted to leave?
 [2] Is this all about consistency?

>2
 "As a point of consistency, I'd rather die than lie. If I'm honest,
 which I always am, I'm a bit of a martyr for truth. I shall not admit
 to being a zombie, as I am not a zombie."

 [1] That's a tad extreme. Looks like you need proving right.
 [2] How very odd you are.

>2
 "It'll be difficult to prove that I'm not a zombie," she says with
 finality, "but hopefully history will vindicate me if you do not." You
 think it a good time to leave, given that she will soon be burning
 alive.

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>examine pitch
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle

>go east

 On the Edge of the Plains
 The plains are a grassy expanse extending to the east as far as the
 eye can see, and probably further. Here, just a short distance east of
 the road, a small crowd has gathered, silently gazing out onto the
 wilderness.

>go east
 Ignoring the disapproving glares of the unicornists, you strike out
 onto the plains purposefully. Then you trip over a rabbit hole, fall
 flat on your face, pick yourself up, woefully brush the resulting
 grass strains, and then strike out again, equally purposefully, if now
 a little humbly.

 Wide Plains
 You make your way out into the wide plains. They're an extraordinary
 expanse of grass so green it hurts your eyes. No matter how far you
 walk into them -- so far that the crowd at the roadside becomes a mere
 speck, like a squashed fly on a motorway windscreen -- they remain as
 boundless as ever, stretching out in seemingly every direction.

 There is a peculiar juddering noise in the distance.

>listen
 You listen closely to the sound, and discern the direction of
 approach. You wait, tense, as the sound approaches, and then -- just
 as you fear you're about to be crushed beneath invisible hooves -- you
 launch yourself into the air and land, with a dramatic thud, on the
 heavy, pulsing, pink and invisible mound of the unicorn's back.

 The unicorn tries to buck you, but you lurch forward and grab wildly
 -- successfully hooking an arm round the invisible pink horn on Her
 invisible pink head.

>put burden on horn
 Putting things on the horn would achieve nothing.

 As the unicorn gallops onwards She whinnies madly and continues to
 buck her body furiously in an effort to throw you.

>put burden on unicorn
 Putting things on the unicorn would achieve nothing.

 Unless you do something to stop the unicorn soon, you'll be thrown to
 the ground and crushed beneath her mighty invisible pink hooves -- and
 no doubt cast down to the Pastures of Short Grass and High Manure.

>getr burden
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>get burden
 You already have that.

 Your body's weight is clearly causing the unicorn great distress --
 but it's not enough to totally incapacitate her. You're losing your
 grip on her horn.

>hang burden on unicorn
 You grip Her flanks tightly with your thighs, feeling the enormous
 pink muscles pulse beneath her invisible skin, and lurch forward,
 strecthing out your arms to loops the burden's thong over the end of
 Her horn. There's a trembling equine scream and she stumbles; you feel
 Her front legs buckle beneath her as you're thrown into a somersault
 over Her head.

 Picking yourself up from the ground, you turn around and feel your
 breath snatched out from your lungs by the vision before you like a
 baby fox from its set by a hunter's hound. The unicorn is weeping and
 singing, Her broken legs flailing in the air -- in her last moments
 she has appeared. Her skin shimmers with a mega-pinkness truly beyond
 your understanding; her mighty silver horn is bent in two by the
 enormous burden of proof.

 The earth cracks around Her and She seems to shrink from your sight
 while simultaneously expanding to encompass the entire breadth of the
 plain. There's a might boom and sucking of air and she vanishes,
 triumphantly, in a puff of logic, leaving behind her a whiff of greasy
 pink smoke.

 The plains seem terribly small now, and the crowd terribly close. They
 are whimpering at your approach. Before you reach them, there's a
 collective roar, and the sprint as one down the road, ripping their
 Unicornist badges from their clothes and casting them aside.

 On the Edge of the Plains
 The plains seem folornly empty now that the unicorn's non-existence
 has been firmly proven. There is nothing here for you.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>get homunculi
 Philosophers are not yet supermen.

>go south
 Striking out south towards the castle, you soon realise what it is
 that lurks so strangely at the base of the crag. As the rock looms
 over you like ten tonne weight over a hapless clown, the road becomes
 a pebbly path leading into what is clearly an enormous maze.

 Outside the Maze
 You're standing at the entrance to a vast maze built of hedges that
 tower six feet above you. The path seems extravagantly narrow, as if
 the designer wanted to prepare the unwary adventurer from the outside.
 Above the entrance is a painted wooden sign. It looks important.

>examine sign
 Attention, Adventurer! This MAZE is not for the FAINTHEARTED, nor for
 the CORRUPT. This is the MORAL MAZE, where only the truly ETHICAL
 shall pass. Should you find yourself LOST forever -- what can you do

>climb pole
 You're positively climbing up the walls.

>go north
 As you approach the village, you see that the crowd of unicornist has
 gathered outside the church, baying for blood. They charge the doors,
 which burst open, and they flood into the building. There's a moment
 of confused stillness, and then they come thundering out of the
 church, carrying the priest along bodily like a rock star at a
 open-air festival, only much more threateningly. You dive for cover as
 the crowd streams past you and mob off down the road, the priest's
 plaintiff cries drowned beneath their righteous anger.

 As they vanish into the distance they leave nothing behind them but a
 cloud of dust and a single dazed unicornist. Hairy and bedraggled, he
 looks at you in utter confusion, says "Nice day for it", and wanders
 off.

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what

 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on

 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west

 The theatre's director is here, jumping around declaiming his joy to
 a skull held tenderly in his hand.

>talk to director
 When the director spots you, he runs up to meet you, scuffing the hems
 of his trousers. "You, mate," he says, "Are a bloody marvel. I heard
 all about it! You and the unicorn, proving She doesn't exist!
 S'changed everyfing round here, I tell you. Look, I really owe you
 one. I've got this fing my grandfather passed on to me. Haven't a clue
 what it does, but he called it a qualiascope and sed it was the most
 valuable fing he owned. Looks bloody beautiful, anyway."

 "Listen, I've gotta get on. Got a show to produce! Catch you later,
 comrade."

 He shambles off back into the theatre, slamming the door behind him.
 You're left holding the arcane device in your hands.

 It's covered in a hundred nozzles, dials and buttons; you daren't
 press a single one of them. There's a bit that looks like it's
 definitely meant to be an eyepiece, though.

>look through eyepiece
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine etepiece
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle
 creators of this world.

>look in qualiascope
>examine eyepiece
 Look through it at what?

 You hold the eyepiece to your eye and look through it. The scenery is
 rendered in black and white, but here and there are extraordinary
 flashes of color, and smells and tastes and sounds and feelings and
 emotions and . . . You put down the qualiascope, feeling queasy. You
 realise that what it allows you to do is see directly into other
 people's consciousness. Whatever they sense, you sense. Whatever they
 feel, you feel. It's more than you could possibly imagine. Or, indeed,
 would want to.

>go east

 Hill
 There's a great pyre here very slowly catching alight. Tied to a stake
 in the centre of the fire is a handsome woman looking deeply
 determined, though you suppose she'd look less composed if the fire
 wasn't so pitifully poor. At the base of the pyre, an imposing,
 bushy-bearded man in an ornate uniform is interrogating her intensely,
 in a way that appears to be making her all the more resolute.

 From here, you could head west, back to the village, or further into
 the hills to the north.

>go east
 The hill's too steep to descend in that direction.

>give qualiascope to man
 The Zombiefinder General doesn't seem interested.

>look at general
 A brutish-looking man, with green eyes and orange eyebrows. He's
 wearing a uniform covered in silver brocade, with three purple
 chevrons on each shoulder. It's as if he's trying to assert the
 vibrancy of his colourful personality through the medium of military
 vestments.

 He's determinedly interrogating the equally determined woman on the
 pyre.

 The interrogator gesticulates manically at the woman, crying
 "Confess!" But she merely juts out her jaw determinedly.

>look through qualiascope at woman
 You suddenly become awash with the person's unique and irreducible
 subjective sensations.

>use scope on woman
 I only understood you as far as wanting to use the qualiascope.

>look through qualiascope at man
 You are surprised to see the Zombiefinder General appear in black and
 white. According to the qualiascope he is not conscious -- he is a
 zombie!

>talk to zombiefinder
 "Yes?" he says, abruptly.

 [1] Ah... nothing.

 "Do not tarry!" he shouts, "Go retire some zombies!"

>retire zombiefinder

 Now that you know he's truly a zombie, dispatching him as quickly as
 possible seems like a plan, but you'll need something sharp . . .

>ask zombiefinder for sauce
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle
 creators of this world.

>go west

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>go north

 Square
 You alight upon a square, around which runs someone who looks like a
 madman, grasping a lantern lit bright in the morning hours, and crying
 incessantly.This appears to be the academic quarter of the village,
 and so may in fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You
 know it's the academic quarter, because the grass is covered with
 sprawling young people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks,
 and organic deodorant, around whom the madman runs, crying, while they
 yell and laugh at him. Architecturally and geographically speaking,
 the buildings look like they were placed there by a commitee of
 village planners whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a
 compass. Three sides of the square are complemented by a museum,
 research institute and a library, to the west, north and east
 respectively.

>examine madman
 He has a bushy moustache and looks like the sort of guy who likes to
 hike.

>talk to madman
 You approach the madman, who is crying, "I seek God! I seek God!"

 there.

 "How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What
 was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled

 "What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of
 atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the

 [1] Festival of atonement? Is that some sort of Gregorian chant gig?
 [2] If we're going to be inventing games, I suggest a dynamic cross
 between spelunking and curling.
 [3] On the greatness scale, I think it falls somewhere between
 juggling with chainsaws and licking one's own elbow.

 "There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after

 [2] A higher history? That doesn't sound too bad.
 [3] (listen patiently)
 [4] (leave)

>3
 Here the madman falls silent and looks again at you, his listener; and
 you, too, are silent and stare at him in astonishment. At last he
 throw his lantern on the ground, where it breaks into pieces and goes
 out. "I have come too early," he says; "my time is not yet. This
 tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet
 reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light
 of the stars requires time; deeds, though done, still require time to
 be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than most
 distant stars---and yet they have done it themselves."

 With these final words the madman leaves the square. You see him
 heading in the direction of the church, and from that direction you
 soon hear the words, "What after all are these churches now if they
 are not the tombs and sepulchers of God?". You feel like you've
 overslept and woken up in a 1970"s Kaufmann translation of The Gay
 Science. I mean, who uses the word "sepulchers", anyway?

 The Odditorium is filled with a crazy array of philosophical exhibits.
 You wander past a brain suspended in a vat of colourless liquid and
 wired to some complicated electronics, and then pause to examine an
 old-fashioned tachyon telephone. You could spend hours in here, but
 your attention is alerted by a furious argument taking place at the
 far end of the room, beneath the hulking hull of a ship that protrudes
 from the wall in a most unexpected manner. There, a man in extremely
 piratical clothing is giving a woman in a steward's uniform a piece of
 his mind.

>look at pirate through quiddithingimajig
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look at the pirate.

>examine pirate
 Bandana, frock-coat, dreadlocks, eyeliner -- the lot. He's either a
 pirate or a glam rock refugee.

 "Arr!" says the pirate, with a sense of obligation. "Theseus be the
 name o' my ship! This be just a shoddy replica!"

 "No, I think you'll find that this is the original Theseus, and your
 ship is but a pale remake," replies the steward camly.

>examine ship
 (the Ship of Theseus)
 The business end of a great ship is poking through the wall of the
 museum, with a surprised-looking mermaid stuck on the pointy bit. It
 might be a figurehead. The name on the prow is "Theseus".

>examine woman
 "Honestly, this is constructed entirely from the original abandoned
 timbers," says the steward.

 "Shiver your timbers!" replies the pirate, in the manner of a grave
 insult.

 She sports a uniform and a badge that declares her to be called
 "HallomynameisTracyhowmayIhelpyou".

 "You be takin' my livelihood away!" cries the pirate, his mascara
 running. The steward simply crosses her arms and tuts at this display.

>talk to pirate
 "What seems to be the trouble here?" you ask, approaching the arguing
 pair.

 "She be stealin' my ship!" exclaims the pirate.

 "He be -- sorry, is -- kicking up a fuss in my museum over a silly
 little name."

 [1] So what exactly happened?
 [2] How does one steal a ship, exactly?
 [3] And what name seems to be causing the trouble?

>1
 "It's quite simple," says the steward. "Mr Starling --"

 "Cap'n Starling," corrects the pirate.

 " -- Captain Starling here owned a rather famous ship, the Theseus.
 Over the years he's had to replace its timbers one by one, casting the
 old ones aside as he goes. We at Reichenbach's Believe-It-or-Not Ltd
 simply gathered the timbers together and rebuilt the original ship for
 display here."

 "Scurvy dogs that you arrr! And now the Shippin' Board be on my back
 about name licensin', not lettin' me an' my mates sail the seas agin
 'til we can either prove Theseus be our ship an' not this
 barnacle-bottomed bucket or come up with another name!"

 "Well, splice my mainbrace," you say.

 [1] Why don't you just rename your ship, then?
 [2] Why don't you just keelhaul her?
 [3] Couldn't you take up macrame instead?
 [4] Couldn't the museum set up some sort of licensing agreement?

 "And give up a lifetime's piratin'? Never! Besides, I can never do

 [1] Why don't you just rename your ship, then?
 [2] Why don't you just keelhaul her?
 [3] Couldn't the museum set up some sort of licensing agreement?

 "A fine suggestion!" replies the pirate, before looking askance at
 steward, who has placed her hands on her hips in a very pointed
 fashion. "Only, er, me poor ole back is achin' somewhat today, what
 with the Westerly breeze an' all."

 [1] Why don't you just rename your ship, then?
 [2] Couldn't the museum set up some sort of licensing agreement?

>2
 "Certainly not," says the steward. "The ship -- and it's name --
 belong solely to us, and we're not going to waste money, on, er,
 scurvy sea-dogs like this gentleman here."

 The pirate seems to take this rather ineffectual insult as a
 compliment, and swaggers a little.

 [1] Why don't you just rename your ship, then?

>1
 "Theseus be the finest name ever to grace a ship on the high seas,"
 growls the pirate. "Lessen you can find a better unused name, I'm not

 THE SHIP OF NEURATH

 Take a cruise upon the fabulous Ship of Neurath. Let your sense-data
 be amazed as the ship is reconstructed before your very eyes. In the
 words of V.W.O. Quine:

 "Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and
 for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by
 using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely
 anew, but only by gradual reconstruction."

 The ship sails annually across the dark ocean without shores or
 lighthouses, strewn with many a philosophic wreck.

 "Listen," you say to the pirate, "I've just heard about this cruise.
 It's no longer running, so the name of the boat's free -- it's
 "Neurath". I thought that that was pretty good. And it's being
 constantly remade as well, just like yours, What do you say?"

 "Arr," says the pirate. "You be sure this be a proper ship an' not
 just an allegory for the method of practising pseduo-falsification to
 preserve the coherency of any given epistemological system?"

 "Oh, certainly," you reply.

 "That'll do nicely then," he says, swaggering off in a haze of
 alcohol, fleas, and overwrought guitar riffs. You and the steward
 watch him go, and then she takes you by the arm. "Listen," she says,
 "I ought to thank you for that. We've been getting rid of some old
 exhibits in order to make room for the Theseus, and I've some old
 moral principles nobody seems interested in any more. I could let you
 have one, if you like.

 She shows you the display case, in which sits a tiny golden measuring
 rule, a little silver calculator, and an odd lead cube.

 Bat Lab
 The laboratory is a  brightly-lit white chamber, covered wall-to-wall
 in cabinets, posters, and counters covered with disturbing-looking
 instruments. A gigantic model of a bat hangs from the ceiling,
 spinning around gently. A white-haired man is moving fitfully around
 the room, grabbing instruments and examining diagrams, as he proceeds
 to dissect a series of what look worryingly like tiny brains. He's
 muttering something over and over again under his breath: "What is it

 As you enter the colour lab, the scientist inside jumps in surprise,
 dropping what looks like some rather sensitive equipment on the floor
 with an expensive-sounding crash.

 "Bugger!" she says in a pleasant English accent. "There goes another
 prism assembly." She bends down to pick up the pieces, mumbling
 distractedly to herself. She seems to have entirely forgotten your
 presence.

 The lab itself is filled with all manner of scientific equipment.
 Monitors, levers, dials and big red buttons cover the walls, while the
 room's desk -- pushed against the computer stacks on the back wall --
 has a complicated-looking laptop-printer set-up perched somewhere in

 [1] I was just interested in what it is you're doing in this lab.
 [2] Oh! -- what are those peculiar goggles you're wearing?
 [3] As you seem to be at least moderately sane, perhaps you could tell
 me what's going on, and why I've woken up in a weird fantasy world.

>2
 "The what?" she says, puzzled. "Oh! The goggles! D'you know, I forgot
 I had them on. I don't really think about them, you see."

 [1] They seem a bit big and unwieldy just to forget they're there.
 [2] Don't you want to take them off?
 [3] So what do they do?

>3
 "As I understand it," she says, "they filter out the experience of
 colour, meaning that I see everything in black and white. Of course, I
 wouldn't know, having never taken them off."

 [1] (something doesn't add up here)
 [2] Wait . . . you study colour intimately, but you've never taken off
 those goggles?
 [3] Wait . . . you've never experienced colour?
 [4] Wait . . . you said you were an expert on colour?

>4
 "Absolutely. Anything you want to know about colour, I can tell you."

 [1] (something doesn't add up here)
 [2] And you study colour intimately, but you've never taken off those
 goggles?
 [3] And you've never experienced colour?

>2
 "Never saw a reason too," she says simply.

 [1] (something doesn't add up here)
 [2] And you've never experienced colour?

>2
 "As far as that goes, yes."

 [1] (something doesn't add up here)

>1
 "Hang on," you say, and Mary grips the desk obligingly. "I mean,
 you're a colour expert--"

 "I know everything there is to know about colours, yes."

 "--but you've never experienced colours?"

 "That's right!" says Mary brightly.

 [1] But doesn't that mean that one thing you don't know is what it's
 like to experience colours?
 [2] But, for example, you wouldn't know that a red apple was red,
 would you?
 [3] But if you took off the goggles and experienced colours, wouldn't
 you learn something new?
 [4] I don't understand any of this. I think I'll go.

>3
 "Hmm," says Mary. "D'you know, I don't think so? I already know
 exactly how my brain and body'll react to colours, you see, as I know
 everything about them. Is there anything more to it than that? I
 suppose it'll be nice to get some experimental confirmation, though."

 [1] Er . . . but you still don't know is what it's like to experience
 colours, do you?
 [2] Er . . . but, for example, you wouldn't know that a red apple was
 red, would you?
 [3] OK . . . but what if the first thing you saw was something
 unexpected? Like something that wasn't coloured the way it should be?
 Wouldn't that trick you, as you hadn't experienced it before?
 [4] I don't understand any of this. I think I'll go.

>1
 Mary thinks for a while about this, as if she'd never considered it
 before. "I said I know everything there is to know," she says. "And
 I'm not sure 'what it's like' is something to know, is it? I mean, I
 know everything about how your brain reacts to colours, and so on. The
 'what it's like' isn't really knowledge, is it?

 [1] Er . . . but, for example, you wouldn't know that a red apple was
 red, would you?
 [2] I don't understand any of this. I think I'll go.

>1
 "Oh no, dear!" she says. "I absolutely know when an apple's red. I
 know everything about colours, you see -- including what they behave
 like when filtered through my goggles here. So I can tell when an
 apple is red."

 [1] I don't understand any of this. I think I'll go.

 "Oh, bye, dear," says Mary, turning back to her work. "Do come back if
 you think of something else, or have something interesting to show
 me."

 Square
 The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.

 This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
 fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
 library, to the west, north and east respectively.

>go east

 Philosophy Library
 Inside, the library is distressingly ordinary. If there were a
 building in this crazed thought experiment of a world you would like
 to have seen exploit the full potential of the absurd, it would be the
 library. A winding maze of bookshelves, perhaps, in which the unwary
 adventurer could get lost for hours, on the run from herds of rogue
 thesauruses; a vast glass dome adorned with mysterious and disturbing
 stained glass images; bolts of narrative energy crackling between the
 books, frazzling the flocks of pamphlets roosting in the upper stacks.

 But no. This is simply a square, book-lined room equipped with a
 borrowing counter, behind which stands a bored-looking librarian, and
 a few old desks. At one of these an imposing bearded man sits, writing
 furiously.

>examine images
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle

 A large bearded man sits at a desk in the library, writing furiously.
 He's surrounded by bundles of paper, some typed, some written in a

 There's a ledger and inkwell sitting on it.

 You tap the man on his shoulder and, muttering under his breath, he
 turns away from his writing to you, asking "Yes?"

 [1] I just wondered what you were doing there?
 [2] What's that you're writing?
 [3] Oh, sorry, are you busy?
 [4] Ah. I'll leave you to it, shall I?

>1
 "Writing," says the man is a heavy Germanic accent. "Busy," he adds.

 [1] Oh. And what is it you're writing?
 [2] Oh, sorry. Urgent, is it?
 [3] Ah. I'll leave you to it, shall I?

>1
 "My Manifesto!" he says, his voice raising and his eyes glowing. "The
 theory of the abolition of private property! The history of all
 hitherto society -- the history of class struggle! The exposure of the
 bourgeois prejudices of law, morality and religion! The revolution of
 the workers of the world!

 [1] Oh . . . ! You're Karl Marx, aren't you?
 [2] OK. This is me edging away slowly now.

>1
 He stops mid-rant. "The very same. You have heard of my work?"

 [1] Well, to be honest, I didn't really get past page 7 of Das
 Kapital.
 [2] Ah, and that's the Manifesto itself, is it? Why are you copying it
 by hand?
 [3] Yup. Pleasure to meet you and all, but I have to go.

>2
 You think you detect a blush rising beneath his beard. "My typewriter
 broke," he says, before sitting down and burying his head in his
 hands.

 [1] Good job I'm not really interested in reading it, then.
 [2] Never fear, Karl! I shall procure you a typewriter and return
 forthwith!
 [3] Look, if that's a hint to get me to go on an obscure object quest,
 forget it. Not unless you've got the readies.

>3
 Marx looks affronted. "Has the bourgeosie so pitilessly torn asunder
 the motley of ties that bound us and left remaining no other nexus
 between us than callous cash payment?" he demands, before leaving you,
 chagrined, for his writing.

 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>go south

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

 The Chinese Room, you have discovered, is in the centre of a

 and above you Flying Spaghetti Monsters gambol in the updrafts. The

 It's a plain concrete box, equipped only with desk and chair. A

 stack of cards sitting by the keyboard. There's a slow drip from a
 damp patch up on the ceiling. Some grubby light seeps through a high
 window across onto the poster that dominates an entire wall. Across
 the top of the poster huge bold letters read "THE CHINESE ROOM".
 Underneath -- a string of Chinese characters.

 The Chinese Room, you have discovered, is in the centre of a

>go south
 Striking out south towards the castle, you soon realise what it is
 that lurks so strangely at the base of the crag. As the rock looms
 over you like ten tonne weight over a hapless clown, the road becomes
 a pebbly path leading into what is clearly an enormous maze.

 Outside the Maze
 You're standing at the entrance to a vast maze built of hedges that
 tower six feet above you. The path seems extravagantly narrow, as if
 the designer wanted to prepare the unwary adventurer from the outside.
 Above the entrance is a painted wooden sign. It looks important.

 Attention, Adventurer! This MAZE is not for the FAINTHEARTED, nor for
 the CORRUPT. This is the MORAL MAZE, where only the truly ETHICAL
 shall pass. Should you find yourself LOST forever -- what can you do
 but PRAY?

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>go north

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the

 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>go west
 Leaving the road, you find yourself walking through squat dunes
 scrubby with beachgrass. Your feet leave a trail behind you in the
 otherwise undisturbed sand. Soon, the ocean emerges again from behind
 the dunes, more blue and sparkling than a busking saxophonist on an
 empty Christmas morning.

 You find yourself on a beach -- a strip of silvery sand bordering an
 ocean that seems truly boundless. You try and focus on the horizon,
 but find your attention wavering whenever you get close to pinning it
 down, as if there were a blind spot in your consciousness. The sea
 shimmers and shifts under your gaze. You shake your head, blinking,
 and make your way along the beach, feet sliding in the fine-grained
 sand, towards a few small figures further along.

 As you approach them, the figures -- two men dressed in white togas --
 turn to look at you. "By Zeus, Achilles!" says one to the other, "It
 looks like an adventurer has arrived."

 Before you can get a word in, the man -- an elderly, squat little
 Greek -- greets you effusively:

 "Welcome, adventurer! Well come indeed, oh yes. Very, very fortuitous
 indeed . . . " He tails off, and the other man glances at you,
 embarrassed.

 "Hallo," he says, shuffling on his feet. "I'm Achilles."

 [1] Hello, Achilles.
 [2] What's going on here?

>1
 There's an awkward moment while Achilles searches for something to say
 and the other man continues to mutter to himself. You hear bursts of
 numbers shooting off in all directions from him. "Oh!" says Achilles,
 inspiration striking. "This is Zeno. From Elea. He's very clever."

 [1] What's so clever about him?
 [2] Where's Elea? Is that the name of this place?
 [3] Hang on -- Zeno, Achilles . . . isn't there supposed to be a
 tortoise around here?
 [4] What's going on here?

>2
 "Oh no, Elea is that place halfway between point A and point B. You'll
 never get there."

 [1] What's going on here, then?
 [2] Hang on -- Zeno, Achilles . . . isn't there supposed to be a
 tortoise around here?

>2
 Zeno stops muttering immediately, and looks at you, aghast. Achilles
 turns away. You sense you've said something you shouldn't've.

 Eventually, Zeno speaks, sighing. "Well, that's our problem, don't you
 see? She's gone."

 "Gone," echoes Achilles.

 "Left," says Zeno.

 "Kaput, concludes Achilles, mournfully.

 [1] Why?
 [2] So what is going on here, then?

>1
 "She's on tour with her Aunt Hillary in France," explains Achilles.
 "Said she was sick of being exploited by our patriarchal obsession
 with paradoxes and chauvanistic exploitation of her abilities, and
 wanted to be somewhere where she could truly be herself."

 "Hence," says Zeno, "our problem."

 [1] So what is going on here, then?

>1
 "We're holding a race!" cries Zeno. "A great and magnificent race, of
 profound importance. But we've only got one racer."

 "Me," says Achilles.

 "And you can't hold a proper paradox with only one racer! It would be
 like holding a symposium with only one philosopher. Very boring. Not
 enough contradictions."

 [1] And that's where I come in, is it?
 [2] Hang on, I think I see where this is going . . .

>1
 "Indeed! You look like you would make a fine racer."

 [1] Not a chance.
 [2] What's in it for me?
 [3] Gosh, thanks! I suppose when you put it like that . . .

>2
 "Well there is this rather fine trophy to be presented to the winner,"
 says Zeno, brandishing a large glass cup with a laurel leaf carving.

 [1] Wow, a glass trophy, really? Cor. Guess not, then.
 [2] Oh, alright then.

>2
 "Splendid! Bravo! Well, then, you two had better get ready!"

>look
 You're standing at the start line, stripped to your underwear. You
 made that much of a compromise with the two Greeks. Achilles,
 limbering up next to you, was not so modest. You feel like your
 eyeballs are being dragged on strings, downwards and sideways . . .
 You look away, blushing furiously, and crouch down, set, the aching
 vision of school P.E. lessons mugging you in memory alley.

 When Zeno shouts the go, there's a moment of blurred confusion as you
 both launch off. Your mind can't manage any complicated tasks, like
 managing sensory apparatus, when it's pumping your arms and legs this
 hard. When the mess of sensations starts to coalesce, you realise that
 Achilles has streaked (in every sense of the word) off in front of
 you, and is already nearly at the finish line. Oh, well. At least you
 tried.

 Achilles loops around the flagpole and jogs back to you. Soon he's
 bouncing up and down at your side, jiggling in a disconcerting way.
 "Come on!" he says. "You're halfway there!"

 At this stage, you don't think your brain can possibly cope with
 issuing any instructions other than GIVE UP or KEEP RUNNING.

>keep running
 You plummet onwards down the track, Achilles keeping pace beside you.

 "Only 1/4 a millos to go! Keep it up!"

>kick achilles in the heel
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>keep running
 You plummet onwards down the track, Achilles keeping pace beside you.

 "Only 1/8 a millos to go! Keep it up!"

>keep running

 "Only 1/16 a millos to go! That's nearly there!"

>keep running

 "Only 1/32 a millos to go! You can do it!"

>again
 You plummet onwards down the track, Achilles keeping pace beside you.

 "Only 1/64 a millos to go! You won't give up now, will you?"

>again
 You plummet onwards down the track, Achilles keeping pace beside you.

 "Only 1/128 a millos to go! Surely you can keep going?"

>again

 "Only 1/256 a millos to go! Keep it up!"

>again

 "Only 1/4096 a millos to go! That's nearly there!"

>again
 You plummet onwards down the track, Achilles keeping pace beside you.

 "Only 1/8192 a millos to go! Don't want to give up, do you?"

 You tumble into a heap on the ground, utterly exhausted. Achilles lets
 out a sympathetic groan and picks you up bodily, throwing you over his
 shoulder, before jogging leisurely back to Zeno at the start line.

>go east
 When you come to from your exhausted stupor, you see the two Greeks
 bending over you, concerned. Achilles (mercifully back in his toga)
 puts an amphora of wine to your lips, which you splutter away at,
 sitting up sharply.

 "A brave attempt, young adventurer!" says Zeno. "And, philosophically
 speaking, very interesting, yes, very interesting indeed . . ." He
 tails off again, and as you pick yourself up, Achilles looks at you
 regretfully.

>go west

 Fairytale Woods
 In the midst of the woods stand a Buddhist monk and a lumberjack
 engaged in a heated discussion as to whether a tree falling down in a
 forest makes a sound if nobody is around to hear it. Their debate is
 punctuated by the occasional felling of a tree at the blade of the
 lumberjack's axe.

 The woods become more sinister looking to the west and the village
 street is back to the east.

>go west

 Spooky Part of the Woods
  The fairytale woods seem to have shifted imperceptibly into the
 spooky woods you see before you. All around you are brambles, bracken
 and blackened lightning struck trees.

 Turning east you can just about make out happier looking trees. All
 that you can see in this part of the woods is a mess of brambles.

 You can see a non-black raven here.

 The ravenly laughs maniacly. "Black paint?" it cries, "Black paint?

 The non-black raven snatches the paint from your hands and hides it
 about its person. "Caw," it says, "I'll keep it anyhow."

 she did that.

 Pavement Caf?
 The caf? spills out into the street. Steel chairs are scattered around
 the serving kiosk, apparently chaotically, though you suspect there's
 a cynical art to it. Most of the customers are buried in books,
 thimble-sized cups of black coffee steaming by them and handmade
 cigarettes rolling around the corners of their mouths. Some of them,
 though, are intense young couples clasping hands across their plates,
 boring into each other's eyes as if looking for some flaw, breaking
 the gaze only to toss hair or adjust a beret. Sitting in the corner,
 Jean-Paul Sartre surveys the caf? around him and smiles in a satisfied
 yet enigmatic way.

 The server is clattering away in the kitchen behind the kiosk, making
 loud sweary noises.

>read menu
 In minimalist letters it lists the available fare:
  - Fresh summer sorbet of pre-phyllorexa claret

 fennel garnish

 Square
 The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.

 This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
 fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
 library, to the west, north and east respectively.

>go north

 Research Institute
 Inside, the Institute is as a marvel of the limits of both modernist
 architecture and the persuasiveness of funding applications. The floor
 of the entrance corridor is covered in sticky linoleum and the walls,
 painted an unpleasant shade of grue, with damp health and safety
 posters. Three doors lead off the corridor, to the north, east and
 west, each with a hand-written notice.

 There's a bloody furious cat in there -- an equally furious physicist
 is trying to force it into a box and close the lid, but is getting
 only bites and scratches for his troubles. You decide to leave them to
 it.

>go east

 Colour Lab
 The lab is filled with all manner of scientific equipment. Monitors,
 levers, dials and big red buttons cover the walls, while the room's
 desk -- pushed against the computer stacks on the back wall -- has a
 complicated-looking laptop-printer set-up perched somewhere in the
 middle, surrounded by arcane assemblies of metal and glass, which Mary
 is operating with feverish skill.

 You can see a manual here.

 the room, grabbing instruments and examining diagrams, as he proceeds
 to dissect a series of what look worryingly like tiny brains. He's
 muttering something over and over again under his breath: "What is it

 Hill
 There's a great pyre here very slowly catching alight. Tied to a stake
 in the centre of the fire is a handsome woman looking deeply
 determined, though you suppose she'd look less composed if the fire
 wasn't so pitifully poor. At the base of the pyre, an imposing,
 bushy-bearded man in an ornate uniform is interrogating her intensely,
 in a way that appears to be making her all the more resolute.

 From here, you could head west, back to the village, or further into
 the hills to the north.

>go north

 Outside the Mill
 You trek down the side of the first hill, sniffing the daffodils
 resentfully as you go, and then begin your climb up the next. That
 feeling of the path shifting helpfully beneath your feet continues, no
 matter how much you try and kick the hillside into submission. The sun
 smiles. You breathe a deep, almost contented sigh.

 And then throw yourself to the ground as an enormous screaming mare
 gallops madly down the side of the hill, dragging a shattered cart
 behind her. You pick yourself up as she thunders off into the
 distance, now properly content that this world continues to be
 completely insane, and climb on upwards.

 Passing a sign for "John Stuart's Livery and Corn-Processors", you
 reach the crest of the hill and realise just what made the horse
 gallop. The windmill here is aflame and billowing smoke, its sails
 spinning madly.You cover your face from the unbearable heat of the
 burning mill -- and then you hear the screams from inside.

 The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.

 This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
 fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a

 Outside the Mill
 You cover your face from the unbearable heat of the burning mill --
 and then you hear the screams from inside.

>enter mill
 Inside the Mill
 Sheilding your face from the fire and smoke, and momentarily
 questioning your sanity as you do so, you push your way through the
 door into the windmill. Wooden beams are crashing down around you in
 arcs of flame as you search for the source of the screams. Then you
 see them, trapped behind some arcane grinding machinery -- a huge man
 dressed in robes and an archbishop's mitre, and a small woman in a
 French maid's uniform.

 You pick your way through the burning wreckage in an effort to reach
 them, and then you pull back in horror. Just as you realise that the
 man is the Archbishop of Cambray, instantly recognisable from his
 regular appearances in the pages of The Guardian, so too do you
 realise that the woman is -- your mother.

 Her screaming and his bellowing snap you back to the urgency of the
 situation. The mill is crashing round about you and you have just time
 to enact a daring rescue. But with mounting horror you realise that
 you can't possibly carry both of them at once -- indeed, you may only
 be able to rescue one of them. But who?

>think about mill
 John Stuart Mill (1806 - 1873) was a British ethical and political
 philosopher, and a public intellectual. He was the foremost proponent
 of utlitarianism, and also an early and formative theoriser of the
 liberal social state.

>SAVE

>rescue mother
 Grabbing her left leg, you drag your mother heroically from the
 burning mill. As soon as she is clear of the building it explodes in a
 melodramatic and highly implausible inferno, from which rolls, rather
 pitifully, the Archbishop's mitre. You watch it spin to a halt as your
 mother swoons on the grass.

 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as

 Pavement Caf?
 The caf? spills out into the street. Steel chairs are scattered around
 the serving kiosk, apparently chaotically, though you suspect there's
 a cynical art to it. Most of the customers are buried in books,
 thimble-sized cups of black coffee steaming by them and handmade
 cigarettes rolling around the corners of their mouths. Some of them,
 though, are intense young couples clasping hands across their plates,
 boring into each other's eyes as if looking for some flaw, breaking
 the gaze only to toss hair or adjust a beret. Sitting in the corner,
 Jean-Paul Sartre surveys the caf? around him and smiles in a satisfied
 yet enigmatic way.

 The server is clattering away in the kitchen behind the kiosk, making
 loud sweary noises.

 You head nervously into the kitchen, where you find the server
 struggling with a frying pan. Hearing you enter, she spins around,
 brandishing the pan. "You can bloody well forget about those
 sausages!" she screams at you.

 "That's OK," you say. "I've got a wonderful surprise for you!

 Putting down the pan, she lights a cigarette on the stove, puffs
 sulkily on it, and says, "Oh yeah? What?"

 You brandish your plovers" eggs at her with a "ta-da!" and suddenly
 all her winsomeness returns. "Darling!" she says, hugging you. "Just
 what I always wanted!" She rummages in a cupboard and brings out a
 bottle. She thrusts it at you and says, "Now sod off and leave me

 Tavern
 A raucous rabble of eminent philosophers line the tables and bar,
 discussing matters squifflily with slurred syllables and questionable
 eloquence. You overhear Plato and Socrates nonsensically picking apart
 Monkey Island. The only one not joining in seems to be Aristotle, who
 is sitting glumly in the corner. In the eastern wall is the back door
 through which Mill threw himself earlier.

 Somewhat incongruously, you spot an electronic games machine sitting
 against the wall next to a rather glum looking booth, being rather
 neglected by the roistering philosophers.

 "Splendid! Aristotle cries. "You actually managed it! For a moment

 He pulls out a book from the recesses of his raiments and hands it to
 you. "A token of my appreciation -- I do hope you enjoy it. Just keep
 it away from this lot or they'll scribble footnotes all over it," he
 says, waving at the drunken philosophers, before turning his attention
 to the bottle with a satisfied gleam in his eyes.

 You're standing at the start line, stripped to your underwear. You
 made that much of a compromise with the two Greeks. Achilles,

 eyeballs are being dragged on strings, downwards and sideways . . .
 You look away, blushing furiously, and crouch down, set, the aching
 vision of school P.E. lessons mugging you in memory alley.

 When Zeno shouts the go, there's a moment of blurred confusion as you
 both launch off. Your mind can't manage any complicated tasks, like
 managing sensory apparatus, when it's pumping your arms and legs this
 hard. When the mess of sensations starts to coalesce, you realise that
 Achilles has streaked (in every sense of the word) off in front of
 you, and is already nearly at the finish line. Oh, well. At least you
 tried.

 Achilles loops around the flagpole and jogs back to you. Soon he's
 bouncing up and down at your side, jiggling in a disconcerting way.
 "Come on!" he says. "You're halfway there!"

 At this stage, you don't think your brain can possibly cope with
 issuing any instructions other than GIVE UP or KEEP RUNNING.

 At this stage, you don't think your brain can possibly cope with

>give up
 You tumble into a heap on the ground, utterly exhausted. Achilles lets
 out a sympathetic groan and picks you up bodily, throwing you over his
 shoulder, before jogging leisurely back to Zeno at the start line.

>throw banana
 When you come to from your exhausted stupor, you see the two Greeks
 bending over you, concerned. Achilles (mercifully back in his toga)
 puts an amphora of wine to your lips, which you splutter away at,
 sitting up sharply.

 "A brave attempt, young adventurer!" says Zeno. "And, philosophically
 speaking, very interesting, yes, very interesting indeed . . ." He
 tails off again, and as you pick yourself up, Achilles looks at you
 regretfully.

>drop banana
 Dropped.

>talk to achilles
 Achilles blushes when you address him directly, and drags his foot in
 the sand. "You should talk to Mister Zeno," he says.

 [1] Ah, Zeno? Hello?

>1
 "What? Oh! Oh, it's you. Fancy another race then, do you?"

 [1] Nah, thanks, I'd only get thrashed again.
 [2] I haven't a chance unless you give me a head start!
 [3] Yeah, I think I could give it another shot.

>2
 "Oh no, I'm afraid that would foul all the calculations. We'd only
 need one of those to compensate for some flaw or other in the race
 track -- and just look at it! Aren't those lanes perfect? Can you
 manage without?"

 [1] Hmm . . . nah, I'll pass this time.
 [2] Well, alright, I'll still give it another go.

>2
 "Splendid! Bravo! Well, then, you two had better get ready!"

>run
 You're standing at the start line, stripped to your underwear. You
 made that much of a compromise with the two Greeks. Achilles,
 limbering up next to you, was not so modest. You feel like your
 eyeballs are being dragged on strings, downwards and sideways . . .
 You look away, blushing furiously, and crouch down, set, the aching
 vision of school P.E. lessons mugging you in memory alley.

 When Zeno shouts the go, there's a moment of blurred confusion as you
 both launch off. Your mind can't manage any complicated tasks, like
 managing sensory apparatus, when it's pumping your arms and legs this
 hard. When the mess of sensations starts to coalesce, you realise that
 Achilles has streaked (in every sense of the word) off in front of

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>go north

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>go barbershop

 Barbershop
 The barber is still here, snipping away happily at his bald client.
 You sit on the bench next to the stand of dye, waiting.

>talk to barber
 He studiously ignores you, humming louder whenever you open your mouth
 to speak.

>look under bench
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine bench
 Solidly wooden, and relatively unvandalised. Somebody wants to inform
 you that Friedrich hearts Lou, though.

>look behind bench
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine hair
 Ah hair. Hair hair hair. Long, beautiful hair, shining, gleaming,
 streaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen . . .

>dye banana red
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>put red dye on banana
 You need to be holding the phial of red dye before you can put it on
 top of something else.

>take red dye
 The barber winks at you, "One per customer. If you change your mind
 put one back on the stand and take another.

>dye banana
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>put banana in red dye
 This sort of dye involves powder and ammonia and would be a big hassle
 to use on a banana. Surely there's a simpler way.

>go north

 Square
 The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.

 This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
 fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
 library, to the west, north and east respectively.

>go east

 Philosophy Library
 This is simply a square, book-lined room equipped with a borrowing
 counter, behind which stands a bored-looking librarian, and a few old
 desks. At one of these Karl Marx sits, writing furiously.

>talk to librarian
 The librarian spots you and says, "What do you want this time?"

 [1] Still got no Plato I can read?
 [2] Er, I was wondering if, maybe, you could see your way to getting

 You're still waiting for that book.

 Bent and blue, like a police officer.

 The librarian returns and hands the tome to you wordlessly, before
 returning to h/er spot behind the counter.

 There's a bloody furious cat in there -- an equally furious physicist
 is trying to force it into a box and close the lid, but is getting

 Colour Lab
 The lab is filled with all manner of scientific equipment. Monitors,
 levers, dials and big red buttons cover the walls, while the room's
 desk -- pushed against the computer stacks on the back wall -- has a
 complicated-looking laptop-printer set-up perched somewhere in the
 middle, surrounded by arcane assemblies of metal and glass, which Mary
 is operating with feverish skill.

>give banana to mary
 You flourish the blue banana in Mary's direction. She squints at it,
 seeming a little confused. "There's something very odd about that
 banana," she says. "I think it's blue. You'd better not eat it," she
 counsels, motherly.

 "No," you say. "It's a perfectly ordinary yellow banana. Why don't you
 take those goggles off and check?"

 "Well, if you're sure, dear, then I suppose I'd better," says Mary,
 fiddling with the strap. "I must have made a mistake in my
 calculations somewhere."

 Struggling with them a little, she pulls the goggles from her head.
 Blinking, her jaw drops wide open, and she looks about herself in
 wonderment. "Colours!" she whispers weakly, her knees buckling. "After
 all this time . . . I never knew . . ." She lets out a small,
 satisfied sound -- and faints on the spot.

 "Oh, bye, dear," says Mary, turning back to her work. "Do come back if
 you think of something else, or have something interesting to show

 You really don't think you can muck about with the goggles -- Mary

 the room, grabbing instruments and examining diagrams, as he proceeds
 to dissect a series of what look worryingly like tiny brains. He's

 You can't tell from here, but it looks like the road turns into a
 small path that in turn vanishes into some peculariarly cut hedges.
 Curiouser and curiouser.

>go south
 Striking out south towards the castle, you soon realise what it is
 that lurks so strangely at the base of the crag. As the rock looms
 over you like ten tonne weight over a hapless clown, the road becomes
 a pebbly path leading into what is clearly an enormous maze.

 Outside the Maze
 You're standing at the entrance to a vast maze built of hedges that
 tower six feet above you. The path seems extravagantly narrow, as if
 the designer wanted to prepare the unwary adventurer from the outside.
 Above the entrance is a painted wooden sign. It looks important.

>go south
 You step tentatively into the maze, looking askance at the lump of
 lead. Approaching a moral dilemma, it starts whirring wildly, and
 glowing cracks in the cube appear. It begins to unfold into an
 astonishingly complex device -- an array of dishes and balances, with
 an arrow mounted on top. With little else to do you follow the arrow
 past the dilemma. And then past the next -- and the next. Moral
 dilemmas seem not to be dilemmas at all before its power, and soon you
 emerge from the maze, breathless, at the foot of the crag that looms
 over this land.

 A winding path leads up the side of the crag, and you follow it,
 huffing and puffing, until you reach the top. Here, looming
 dangerously atop the already looming crag, sits a gigantic loom. No, a
 gigantic castle -- you were confused for a minute there. Behind you,
 this crazy world stretches out below. You take a deep breath. You
 feel, somehow, that you are near your goal -- whatever that may be..

 At the Foot of an Ivory Tower
 You are in a paved courtyard before the castle. Here, true to form, an
 ivory tower towers above you, the result of a billion poaching
 expeditions or more. Similarly true, a guard guards the broad stairs
 leading up to the tower.

 Below you is the vertiginous path down the side of the crag -- and
 below that stretches the world. The strangest thing of all, however,
 is the faint and ominous organ music on the periphery of your hearing.

 You step up to the steps, whistling. The guard, clanking in her
 armour, steps resolutely in front of you.

 "No!" she says, pre-empting the merry greeting you had planned. "I
 shan't let you past. For I know that I am a guard and that guards
 guard, and thus I will guard this tower from you.

>talk to guard
 You step up to the steps, whistling. The guard, clanking in her
 armour, steps resolutely in front of you.

 "Go away," says the guard. "If I'm assured anything, it's that I'm
 assured of things and one thing I'm assured of is that I don't want
 you to pass. This I'm sure of."

>give manifesto to guard
 The guard doesn't seem interested.

>give handkerchief to guard
 (first taking the handkerchief)
 (putting the Communist Manifesto into the sack to make room)
 The guard doesn't seem interested.

>examine guard
 The guard is decked out from head to foot in an oversized suit of
 armour, and is carrying an nasty-looking sword. The only part of the
 guard you can see are a pair of sparkling blue eyes glowing with
 righteous clarity.

>go north
 You channel your will to power to summon a path in that direction.
 Sadly, nothing happens: you can't go that way.

>go down
 You pick your way back down the crag, leaving that penultimate-looking
 tower behind you. You're now able to make your way through the maze
 with ease, and you're soon back on the other side.

 Outside the Maze
 You're standing at the entrance to a vast maze built of hedges that
 tower six feet above you. The path seems extravagantly narrow, as if
 the designer wanted to prepare the unwary adventurer from the outside.
 Above the entrance is a painted wooden sign. It looks important.

>examine hedges
 Dark and daunting.

>go north

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>go east

 On the Edge of the Plains
 The plains seem folornly empty now that the unicorn's non-existence
 has been firmly proven. There is nothing here for you.

>go east
 The plains are too vast and empty for that to be a pleasurable walk.

>go north

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>go north

 Square
 The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.

 This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
 fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
 library, to the west, north and east respectively.

>go church

 Church
 The church appears to have made up its mind about its own interior,
 plumping for a simple majesty in stone and wood. As the door creaks
 gracefully closed behind you, you survey your surroundings: the oak
 pews lining the nave, the beautiful arched stone roof, the carved
 pulpit at the head of the church and, behind it, an enormous tapestry
 depicting -- nothing?

 In one of the pews a woman in full bridal gear sits, weeping to
 herself.

>examine pews
 Once imposing rows of oak seating, the effect has been somewhat
 diminished by the hardy endeavours of bored worshippers equipped with
 pocket-knives. The pews now provide an education of biblical
 proportions for any inquisitve youngster in the arts of caricature,
 aphorism and sex miseducation.

>talk to bride
 You tap her lightly on the shoulder, and she dissolves into sobs at
 your touch like a centuries-old skeleton into dust.

 [1] Er . . . are you OK?
 [2] Um. Right. Sorry. I'll just . . . stand over here.

>1
 She blows her nose very loudly on her veil and glares at you with
 red-rimmed eyes. "What do you think?" she says.

 [1] Ah. Guess not. Sorry. I'll just . . . stand over here.

>1
 She wails even louder at your departure.

>examine roof
 Great stone arches support the vault, adorned with gargoyles depicting
 various breeds of anthropomorphised shellfish.

>examine shellfish

>give handkerchief to bride
 The bride looks at your proferred hanky, at takes it gratefully.
 Casting the soaked veil aside, she blows her nose with a foghorn
 bellow and looks folornly at the altar.

>take veil
 You pick up the veil and wring it out. On examining it, you realise
 that the fine lacework spells out a word: Ignorance. Curiouser and
 curiouser. Um. More curious.

>examine altar
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle
 creators of this world.

>talk to bride
 After she's fully evacuated her nose into your hanky she hands it back
 to you. You look at it, aghast at the vast quantities of snot therein.

 [1] That's OK. You can keep it.
 [2] Best hold on to that. Better now?

>examine ignorance
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle
 creators of this world.

>2
 "A little," she says, in a very small voice, and proceeds to snort out
 an even more prolific stream.

 [1] Well, that's good to hear. Do you think it would help to talk
 about what's bothering you?
 [2] Sweet. Glad to help. If you ever need a shoulder to cry on . . .
 [3] Why the long face, anyway?

>2
 Immediately the bride grasps your shoulder and sobs into it, the
 tearful torrent turning your clothes into a wet mush.

 [1] There, there.
 [2] Right. Sure. Well, this shoulder's a bit wet now, so I think I'll
 leave you with the hanky, OK?

>1
 You pat her awkwardly on the shoulder, and wait for the tears to dry
 up. It takes a while. Then she sits up, takes a deep breath, and
 begins:

 "We'd been engaged for months, and deeply in love for years before.
 We'd prepared for today for weeks and weeks, and it was all meant to
 be so -- so perfect. But I knew something was wrong. There's been
 something wrong with him for a few days now. Ever since he picked up a
 logic textbook.

 "He started to get this awkward look in his eyes when we talked about
 the wedding. He'd dodge the subject. But he never said he'd do this!
 Leave me standing at the altar like an unwanted pudding!

 "I waited for an hour. The guests all started to leave. His family
 scarpered and mine chased after them. Then it was just me, when his
 best man came and told me what had happened.

 "He'd realised he couldn't marry me. The book had told him. Decades of
 the world's most pre-eminent philosophers have said it. He was a
 bachelor. And all bachelors are unmarried men."

 The bride sighs, hiccups, and then, just as you think she's about to
 recover, dissolves into another bout of sobbing. You decide that now
 is probably the most tactful time to leave, and vow to be more
 original in your logic examples in future.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

 In one of the pews a woman in full bridal gear sits, weeping to

>examine woman
 She's like a very damp pile of meringues, and she's getting damper by
 the second.

>talk to her
 You don't think there's much you can do for her at the moment.

 An huge oak platform with an overarching sound-board; you imagine a
 preacher could boom out from here.

 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle

>examine door
 The heavy wooden portal at the southwest end of the church leads back
 to the village street. It's covered with some very peculiar carvings.

>get in pulpit
 That's not something you can enter.

>examine carvings
 These relief carvings appear to show a sequence of scenes from some
 strange mythology. In the first, a nubile young woman is examining a
 peculiar package laid under a tall tree. In the second, she is wearing
 a short tartan skirt, a snappy blaze and pigtails, and a strapping
 young lad is advancing on her rapidly. In the third, twelve men are
 gathered, six holding hoes and six holding spears, while in the fourth
 one of the spearmen is brutally attacking one of the hoemen. The
 following scenes include floods, burning rains, lots of sex and
 inumerable platypuses. Platypi. The usual myth-fodder.

 Fairytale Woods
 In the midst of the woods stand a Buddhist monk and a lumberjack
 engaged in a heated discussion as to whether a tree falling down in a
 forest makes a sound if nobody is around to hear it. Their debate is
 punctuated by the occasional felling of a tree at the blade of the
 lumberjack's axe.

 The woods become more sinister looking to the west and the village
 street is back to the east.

>give veil to lumberjack
 The lumberjack doesn't seem interested.

>put veil on lumberjack

 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
 library, to the west, north and east respectively.

>go north

 Research Institute
 Inside, the Institute is as a marvel of the limits of both modernist
 architecture and the persuasiveness of funding applications. The floor
 of the entrance corridor is covered in sticky linoleum and the walls,
 painted an unpleasant shade of grue, with damp health and safety
 posters. Three doors lead off the corridor, to the north, east and
 west, each with a hand-written notice.

>go west

 Bat Lab
 The laboratory is a  brightly-lit white chamber, covered wall-to-wall
 in cabinets, posters, and counters covered with disturbing-looking
 instruments. A gigantic model of a bat hangs from the ceiling,
 spinning around gently. A white-haired man is moving fitfully around
 the room, grabbing instruments and examining diagrams, as he proceeds
 to dissect a series of what look worryingly like tiny brains. He's
 muttering something over and over again under his breath: "What is it
 like?" it seems to be. "What is it like? What is it like?"

>examine model
 It's mouth gaping open and its glass eyes staring, this enormous model
 of a bat frightens the life out of you. The fact that it's gently
 turning round and round serves only to add a touch of psychopathic
 absurdity.

>examine track
 Little more than a few lines in the sand. There's one just by Achilles
 and Zeno and the other terribly, terribly far (it seems) in the
 distance. You can only tell where it is by the flag fluttering away
 there. In between the two, long lines follow the steep curve of the
 beach to mark out two lanes, outside and inside. As the beach takes a
 steep curve for the length of the race track, the inside lane is
 probably a little bit shorter than the outer.

 "Splendid! Bravo! Well, then, you two had better get ready!"

>swap lane
 You're standing at the start line, stripped to your underwear. You
 made that much of a compromise with the two Greeks. Achilles,
 limbering up next to you, was not so modest. You feel like your
 eyeballs are being dragged on strings, downwards and sideways . . .
 You look away, blushing furiously, and crouch down, set, the aching
 vision of school P.E. lessons mugging you in memory alley.

 When Zeno shouts the go, there's a moment of blurred confusion as you
 both launch off. Your mind can't manage any complicated tasks, like
 managing sensory apparatus, when it's pumping your arms and legs this
 hard. When the mess of sensations starts to coalesce, you realise that
 Achilles has streaked (in every sense of the word) off in front of
 you, and is already nearly at the finish line. Oh, well. At least you
 tried.

 Achilles loops around the flagpole and jogs back to you. Soon he's
 bouncing up and down at your side, jiggling in a disconcerting way.
 "Come on!" he says. "You're halfway there!"

 At this stage, you don't think your brain can possibly cope with

 out a sympathetic groan and picks you up bodily, throwing you over his
 shoulder, before jogging leisurely back to Zeno at the start line.

>talk to zeno
 When you come to from your exhausted stupor, you see the two Greeks
 bending over you, concerned. Achilles (mercifully back in his toga)
 puts an amphora of wine to your lips, which you splutter away at,
 sitting up sharply.

 "A brave attempt, young adventurer!" says Zeno. "And, philosophically
 speaking, very interesting, yes, very interesting indeed . . ." He
 tails off again, and as you pick yourself up, Achilles looks at you
 regretfully.

 out a sympathetic groan and picks you up bodily, throwing you over his
 shoulder, before jogging leisurely back to Zeno at the start line.

>examine inside track
 When you come to from your exhausted stupor, you see the two Greeks
 bending over you, concerned. Achilles (mercifully back in his toga)
 puts an amphora of wine to your lips, which you splutter away at,
 sitting up sharply.

 "A brave attempt, young adventurer!" says Zeno. "And, philosophically
 speaking, very interesting, yes, very interesting indeed . . ." He
 tails off again, and as you pick yourself up, Achilles looks at you
 regretfully.

>examine inside track
 Little more than a few lines in the sand. There's one just by Achilles
 and Zeno and the other terribly, terribly far (it seems) in the
 distance. You can only tell where it is by the flag fluttering away
 there. In between the two, long lines follow the steep curve of the
 beach to mark out two lanes, outside and inside. As the beach takes a
 steep curve for the length of the race track, the inside lane is
 probably a little bit shorter than the outer.

>talk to achilles
 Achilles blushes when you address him directly, and drags his foot in
 the sand. "You should talk to Mister Zeno," he says.

 [1] Ah, Zeno? Hello?

>1
 "What? Oh! Oh, it's you. Fancy another race then, do you?"

 [1] Nah, thanks, I'd only get thrashed again.
 [2] I haven't a chance unless you give me a head start!
 [3] Yeah, I think I could give it another shot.

>2
 "Oh no, I'm afraid that would foul all the calculations. We'd only
 need one of those to compensate for some flaw or other in the race
 track -- and just look at it! Aren't those lanes perfect? Can you
 manage without?"

 [1] Hmm . . . nah, I'll pass this time.
 [2] Well, alright, I'll still give it another go.

>2
 "Splendid! Bravo! Well, then, you two had better get ready!"

>go inside lane
 You're standing at the start line, stripped to your underwear. You
 made that much of a compromise with the two Greeks. Achilles,
 limbering up next to you, was not so modest. You feel like your
 eyeballs are being dragged on strings, downwards and sideways . . .
 You look away, blushing furiously, and crouch down, set, the aching
 vision of school P.E. lessons mugging you in memory alley.

 When Zeno shouts the go, there's a moment of blurred confusion as you
 both launch off. Your mind can't manage any complicated tasks, like
 managing sensory apparatus, when it's pumping your arms and legs this
 hard. When the mess of sensations starts to coalesce, you realise that
 Achilles has streaked (in every sense of the word) off in front of
 you, and is already nearly at the finish line. Oh, well. At least you
 tried.

 Achilles loops around the flagpole and jogs back to you. Soon he's
 bouncing up and down at your side, jiggling in a disconcerting way.
 "Come on!" he says. "You're halfway there!"

 At this stage, you don't think your brain can possibly cope with
 issuing any instructions other than GIVE UP or KEEP RUNNING.

>go east

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>go north

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>go north

 Square
 The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.

 This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
 fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
 library, to the west, north and east respectively.

>go west

 The Odditorium is filled with a crazy array of philosophical exhibits.

 Bat Lab
 The laboratory is a  brightly-lit white chamber, covered wall-to-wall
 in cabinets, posters, and counters covered with disturbing-looking
 instruments. A gigantic model of a bat hangs from the ceiling,
 spinning around gently. A white-haired man is moving fitfully around
 the room, grabbing instruments and examining diagrams, as he proceeds
 to dissect a series of what look worryingly like tiny brains. He's
 muttering something over and over again under his breath: "What is it
 like?" it seems to be. "What is it like? What is it like?"

 Tavern
 A raucous rabble of eminent philosophers line the tables and bar,
 discussing matters squifflily with slurred syllables and questionable
 eloquence. You overhear Plato and Socrates brazenly investigating what
 the correct pronunciation of the word scone is. The only one not
 joining in seems to be Aristotle, who is sitting at a table in the
 corner, drinking fine claret in a very satisfied manner. In the
 eastern wall is the back door through which Mill threw himself
 earlier.

 Somewhat incongruously, you spot an electronic games machine sitting
 against the wall next to a rather glum looking booth, being rather
 neglected by the roistering philosophers.

 Logicians' Alleyway
 You wander through the back door into an alleyway and there amidst a
 pile of broken truth tables and discarded copies of the Principia

 Wearing a battered trilby and a stained trench-coat, the logician
 looks about himself shiftily as he monitors the racket of logic games.

 It's a brightly covered cabinet with "Karl Popper's FALSIFICATION

 of them, whom you suddenly recognise to be Elizabeth Anscombe, is
 wearing a comic headband with two antennae on springs attached. Next
 to her sits Emma Goldman, glaring fiercely across the table at an
 equally glaring Ayn Rand, while the quartet is completed by Judith

 Pavement Caf?
 The caf? spills out into the street. Steel chairs are scattered around
 the serving kiosk, apparently chaotically, though you suspect there's
 a cynical art to it. Most of the customers are buried in books,
 thimble-sized cups of black coffee steaming by them and handmade
 cigarettes rolling around the corners of their mouths. Some of them,
 though, are intense young couples clasping hands across their plates,
 boring into each other's eyes as if looking for some flaw, breaking
 the gaze only to toss hair or adjust a beret. Sitting in the corner,
 Jean-Paul Sartre surveys the caf? around him and smiles in a satisfied
 yet enigmatic way.

 The server stands behind the kiosk, chainsmoking and glaring
 menacingly.

 Fairytale Woods
 In the midst of the woods stand a Buddhist monk and a lumberjack
 engaged in a heated discussion as to whether a tree falling down in a
 forest makes a sound if nobody is around to hear it. Their debate is
 punctuated by the occasional felling of a tree at the blade of the
 lumberjack's axe.

 The woods become more sinister looking to the west and the village
 street is back to the east.

>go west

 Spooky Part of the Woods
  The fairytale woods seem to have shifted imperceptibly into the
 spooky woods you see before you. All around you are brambles, bracken
 and blackened lightning struck trees.

 Turning east you can just about make out happier looking trees. All
 that you can see in this part of the woods is a mess of brambles.

 Spooky Part of the Woods
  The fairytale woods seem to have shifted imperceptibly into the
 spooky woods you see before you. All around you are brambles, bracken
 and blackened lightning struck trees.

 Turning east you can just about make out happier looking trees. All
 that you can see in this part of the woods is a mess of brambles.

>examine lighter
 It a bit old and creaky, but it gives a serviceable spark.

>go west
 You push your way through the brambles and gingerly descend into the
 dark cave beyond.

 Darkness
 The darkness envelops everything. It is the darkness of ignorance. Or
 possibly just an ordinary sort of darkness, but in any case, you won't
 be able to do anything until you bring some sort of light source here.

>go east

 Fairytale Woods
 In the midst of the woods stand a Buddhist monk and a lumberjack
 engaged in a heated discussion as to whether a tree falling down in a
 forest makes a sound if nobody is around to hear it. Their debate is
 punctuated by the occasional felling of a tree at the blade of the
 lumberjack's axe.

 The woods become more sinister looking to the west and the village
 street is back to the east.

>go east

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>go south

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>go south
 Striking out south towards the castle, you soon realise what it is
 that lurks so strangely at the base of the crag. As the rock looms
 over you like ten tonne weight over a hapless clown, the road becomes
 a pebbly path leading into what is clearly an enormous maze.

 Outside the Maze
 You're standing at the entrance to a vast maze built of hedges that
 tower six feet above you. The path seems extravagantly narrow, as if
 the designer wanted to prepare the unwary adventurer from the outside.
 Above the entrance is a painted wooden sign. It looks important.

>go down
 You channel your will to power to summon a path in that direction.
 Sadly, nothing happens: you can't go that way.

>get sign
 You can't reach it, and besides, there's no use for it anyway.

>read it
 Attention, Adventurer! This MAZE is not for the FAINTHEARTED, nor for
 the CORRUPT. This is the MORAL MAZE, where only the truly ETHICAL
 shall pass. Should you find yourself LOST forever -- what can you do
 but PRAY?

>go south
 Remembering the route from last time, you make your way quickly
 through the maze, up the crag, and to the foot of the castle.

 At the Foot of an Ivory Tower
 You are in a paved courtyard before the castle. Here, true to form, an
 ivory tower towers above you, the result of a billion poaching
 expeditions or more. Similarly true, a guard guards the broad stairs
 leading up to the tower.

 Below you is the vertiginous path down the side of the crag -- and
 below that stretches the world.

>pray
 God is dead.

>go down
 You pick your way back down the crag, leaving that penultimate-looking
 tower behind you. You're now able to make your way through the maze
 with ease, and you're soon back on the other side.

>bribe guard
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>give veil to guard
 I don't think she'd just accept the veil. It's more something that
 you'll need to throw at her.

>throw veil at guard
 You look shiftily from side to side, and when you assure yourself that
 nobody is watching, you cast the veil over the guard's helmet. For
 several long moments you wait. Hesitantly, you put a foot past the
 guard. She doesn't move.

 "Hello?" you whisper.

 "Excuse me, I seem to be completely ignorant to who I am and why I am
 here," she replies. "Can you help me?"

 [1] A living statue, your job is to keep still and quiet all day.
 [2] You're a guard -- you're guarding these stairs from me passsing

 "That sounds nice, but if it's all the same to you," she says, "I'm

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>go up
 You clamber up the stairs and through into the tower. The ivory wall,
 eased by its last descent, crashes down behind you before you can do
 anything. This is it, then.

 First Chamber
 Perfectly round and with walls of glistening ivory, this is definitely
 more of a chamber than a room. A huge sheet of ivory blocks the exit
 archway, while opposite it sits an ivory-panelled door, with a
 definite sense of being heavily locked about it. Through this door
 come the strains of atmospheric organ music you heard earlier, a
 little clearer, and a little more foreboding.

 None of this is the most striking thing about the chamber, however.
 The most striking thing is the fact that in the centre of the room
 buzz thousands of bees, all hovering stationary in a curiously-shaped
 cloud.

>examine bees
 On closer examination the bees are hovering in the exact shape of a
 vending machine. You can even see the slot where the money goes, and
 the little tray where the goods drop down. It would be a refreshingly
 normal sight in this mad world, if it weren't for the fact that it
 were made out of thousands of writhing insects it would be rather a
 relief.

 and organic-sounding thuds. Finally, a key drops into the little tray
 at the bottom of the machine.

 You unlock the door and open it, trembling with trepidation. Through
 the door lies another ivory staircase -- a spiral staircase which
 winds upwards towards another chamber.

 Second Chamber
 You are only a little surprised to find that this chamber is almost
 entirely identical to the first, with the same stairs leading down and
 the same huge door,  but for two minor details: firstly, the
 atmospheric organ music is ever so slightly louder; secondly, the
 machine in the centre of the room is both not made of bees and clearly
 a time machine. The clue is in the words "Time Machine" engraved on
 its casing.

>examine time machine
 A feat of elaborate steelwork has wrought this magnificent device.
 There's what looks like a control booth perched in a torturous
 assembly of elaborate mechanics, as beautiful as they are strange.
 There's a red fake leather seat inside the booth, which rather spoils
 the image, as does the mouldy newspaper sitting on it. The chrome
 dials inside the booth are pretty nice, though.

>examine casing
 That's either not here, or carelessly undescribed by the fickle

>examine newspaper
 It's a rather damp and extremely boring edition of The Times from
 1957. The only interesting item in it is a piece about an ongoing
 unsolved crime -- the theft of a priceless paracentric key from the
 key exhibition at the International House of Keys, loaned to the
 museum by the H.G Wells Reenactment Society.

 The one witness to the theft, a recently-engaged young security guard,
 said "I don't know how the bugger snuck past me -- all I know is,
 there was a flash of light from the exhibition room, the alarm goes
 off, I rushes in, and he clunks me one. Don't know what with, but it
 laid me out for hours -- I was lucky he didn't have a proper weapon
 with him."

 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings

 There's a great pyre here very slowly catching alight. Tied to a stake

 bushy-bearded man in an ornate uniform is interrogating her intensely,
 in a way that appears to be making her all the more resolute.

 From here, you could head west, back to the village, or further into

 "No," you say. "It's a perfectly ordinary yellow banana. Why don't you
 take those goggles off and check?"

 "Well, if you're sure, dear, then I suppose I'd better," says Mary,
 fiddling with the strap. "I must have made a mistake in my
 calculations somewhere."

 Struggling with them a little, she pulls the goggles from her head.
 Blinking, her jaw drops wide open, and she looks about herself in
 wonderment. "Colours!" she whispers weakly, her knees buckling. "After

 satisfied sound -- and faints on the spot.

 architecture and the persuasiveness of funding applications. The floor
 of the entrance corridor is covered in sticky linoleum and the walls,
 painted an unpleasant shade of grue, with damp health and safety
 posters. Three doors lead off the corridor, to the north, east and
 west, each with a hand-written notice.

 Square
 The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.

 This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
 fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
 library, to the west, north and east respectively.

>go east

 Philosophy Library
 This is simply a square, book-lined room equipped with a borrowing
 counter, behind which stands a bored-looking librarian, and a few old
 desks. At one of these Karl Marx sits, writing furiously.

>give laptop to marx
 You place the laptop on Marx's desk with a triumphant thunk. The old
 man looks up at you. "Liebling!" he cries, breathless. "Not just a
 typewriter, but a word processor capable of printing multiple copies!
 This will not be forgotten after the revolution! In the meantime,
 please take this precious copy Manifesto," he says, pressing the typed
 manuscript into your hands, "and may it guide you to your unchaining!"
 With these words he turns back to his work and begins typing
 furiously.

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their
 various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what
 seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by
 duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on
 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

 Hill
 There's a great pyre here very slowly catching alight. Tied to a stake
 in the centre of the fire is a handsome woman looking deeply
 determined, though you suppose she'd look less composed if the fire
 wasn't so pitifully poor. At the base of the pyre, an imposing,
 bushy-bearded man in an ornate uniform is interrogating her intensely,
 in a way that appears to be making her all the more resolute.

 From here, you could head west, back to the village, or further into
 the hills to the north.

 In the midst of the woods stand a Buddhist monk and a lumberjack

 Church
 The church appears to have made up its mind about its own interior,
 plumping for a simple majesty in stone and wood. As the door creaks
 gracefully closed behind you, you survey your surroundings: the oak
 pews lining the nave, the beautiful arched stone roof, the carved
 pulpit at the head of the church and, behind it, an enormous tapestry
 depicting -- nothing?

 In one of the pews a woman in full bridal gear sits, weeping to
 herself.

>give handkerchief to woman
 (first taking the handkerchief)
 (putting the broken lantern into the sack to make room)
 The bride looks at your proferred hanky, at takes it gratefully.
 Casting the soaked veil aside, she blows her nose with a foghorn
 bellow and looks folornly at the altar.

>talk to her
 After she's fully evacuated her nose into your hanky she hands it back
 to you. You look at it, aghast at the vast quantities of snot therein.

 [1] That's OK. You can keep it.
 [2] Best hold on to that. Better now?

>1
 "Thanks," she says tearfully, and proceeds to snort out an even more
 prolific stream.

 [1] You're more than welcome. Do you think it would help to talk about
 what's bothering you?
 [2] Not a problem. Glad to help. If you ever need a shoulder to cry on
 . . .
 [3] Yeah, well. Why the long face, anyway?

>take veil
 [I need some kind of reaction from you to continue the scene.  Enter a
 number, or say REPEAT to reacquaint yourself with your options.]

 "No," sniffs the bride. "But I'll tell you anyway, if you're that
 interested."

 [1] Er . . . Sure!
 [2] Oh, well. I'll just leave you to it then.

>1
 She wipes her cheeks, smearing mascara and blusher, takes a deep
 breath, and begins:

 "We'd been engaged for months, and deeply in love for years before.
 We'd prepared for today for weeks and weeks, and it was all meant to
 be so -- so perfect. But I knew something was wrong. There's been
 something wrong with him for a few days now. Ever since he picked up a
 logic textbook.

 "He started to get this awkward look in his eyes when we talked about
 the wedding. He'd dodge the subject. But he never said he'd do this!
 Leave me standing at the altar like an unwanted pudding!

 "I waited for an hour. The guests all started to leave. His family
 scarpered and mine chased after them. Then it was just me, when his
 best man came and told me what had happened.

 "He'd realised he couldn't marry me. The book had told him. Decades of
 the world's most pre-eminent philosophers have said it. He was a
 bachelor. And all bachelors are unmarried men."

 The bride sighs, hiccups, and then, just as you think she's about to
 recover, dissolves into another bout of sobbing. You decide that now
 is probably the most tactful time to leave, and vow to be more
 original in your logic examples in future.

 You pick up the veil and wring it out. On examining it, you realise

>examine door
 The heavy wooden portal at the southwest end of the church leads back
 to the village street. It's covered with some very peculiar carvings.

>examine carvings
 These relief carvings appear to show a sequence of scenes from some
 strange mythology. In the first, a nubile young woman is examining a
 peculiar package laid under a tall tree. In the second, she is wearing
 a short tartan skirt, a snappy blaze and pigtails, and a strapping
 young lad is advancing on her rapidly. In the third, twelve men are
 gathered, six holding hoes and six holding spears, while in the fourth
 one of the spearmen is brutally attacking one of the hoemen. The
 following scenes include floods, burning rains, lots of sex and
 inumerable platypuses. Platypi. The usual myth-fodder.

 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west

>pump about achilles
 You pull the pump's handle, concentrating furiously. You intuit that
 the only way to beat Achilles would be to get a headstart, and the
 only way to do that would be to demonstrate that something about the
 race is unfair. Better have a good look at that racetrack.

>go south

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>go west

 Beach
 You're on the beach, where Zeno has set up a race track between the
 dunes and the sea. Achilles is also here -- sans Tortoise.

 The road lies back to the east, while the dune where you found the
 nest is northeast of here.

>accuse achilles
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>tell achilles about lanes
 Just TALK TO them.

>examine lanes
 Little more than a few lines in the sand. There's one just by Achilles
 and Zeno and the other terribly, terribly far (it seems) in the
 distance. You can only tell where it is by the flag fluttering away
 there. In between the two, long lines follow the steep curve of the
 beach to mark out two lanes, outside and inside. As the beach takes a
 steep curve for the length of the race track, the inside lane is
 probably a little bit shorter than the outer.

>tell zeno about track

>talk to zeno
 "What? Oh! Oh, it's you. Fancy another race then, do you?"

 [1] Nah, thanks, I'd only get thrashed again.
 [2] Yeah, I think I could give it another shot.
 [3] It's exhausting! Just how long is that track?

>3
 "Oh, only a millos or so."

 [1] Hmm . . . nah, I'll pass this time.
 [2] Phew! Well, I'll still give it another go.
 [3] And had you realised that one lane is just a little bit shorter
 than the other?

>3
 Zeno's eyes widen, and he glances round at the steeply curving track.
 "Curses!" he says "Quite true! That throws all my my calculations out,
 and renders, I'm terribly sorry, all races completely invalid."

 [1] You could just give me -- I mean, the person on the outside lane
 -- a bit of a head start.
 [2] Well, I'm not racing again, I'm afraid.

>1
 "Why, you're absolutely right! Magnificent! Well, what are you waiting
 for? Line up, you two!"

>run run run
 At this stage, you don't think your brain can possibly cope with
 issuing any instructions other than GIVE UP or KEEP RUNNING.

 With a gleam in your eye, you quickly take your position on the
 outside lane, just 50 podes ahead of Achilles. When Zeno shouts the
 go, you pump your legs away without bothering to look behind you.

 When you've reached about halfway down the track, you hear a curse to
 Zeus close behind you. Achilles has made a good deal of headway, but
 something seems to be holding him back. Every time he reaches where
 you've just been, you've managed to make a little further hard
 progress down towards the flag. For each bound he takes, you manage
 another bound -- a smaller, humbler bound -- a little further forward.
 And while you're flagging more than him, and he manages to catch up a
 little further on each bound, he never quite makes it to you.

 Now it's just a matter of endurance. You set your head towards the
 flag and keep forging on. It gets closer and closer, with Achilles
 coming up just behind you, a gnat's crotchet away -- and you reach the
 flag! Throwing yourself over the finish line, you grab onto the pole
 and sink to the ground, exhausted. Achilles throws himself down beside
 you, and you both gaze up at the fluttering red flag, with that
 peculiar hole in the centre, waiting for something like breath to
 return to your lungs.
>run

 When you finally make it back to Zeno, he is applauding wildly.
 "Magnificent! Magnificent!" Even the deject Achilles is overwhelmed as
 Zeno thrusts the glass trophy into your arms and grabs him by the
 hand. "Now see here, Achilles," he says, drawing complicated equations
 in the sand as Achilles looks on, rapt.

 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings

 Plato's Cave
 The lantern's dim glow casts shadows across the walls of the cavern,
 which, oddly, seems not so much collossal as contrived. Raising the
 lantern, you read an etching over the eastern entrance to the cave:
 "Property of Plato." Casting it around, you notice a gap in the walls
 of the cavern that leads down further into the cave system.

 Bizarrely, chained down in the centre of the cave are a group of
 wasted-looking humans. They make no reaction to your stumbling
 entrance, save to stare intently at the shadows you are casting on the
 wall. Feeling a little sheepish, you make a bunny shadow-picture for
 them, it being the only one you can remember. They fail to smile.

>talk to people
 You saunter up to one of the denizens and tap one of them on the
 shoulder.

 [1] Hello?
 [2] (leave)

>1
 "What?" says the denizen, "you'll have to speak up!"

 [1] Hello?
 [2] I said, "HELLO!"
 [3] Oh, never mind. . .

>2
 "Hello," replies the denizen. You resolve to speak a little louder
 from now on.

 [1] Love the earmuffs. They really complement the shackles.
 [2] Nice cave -- I like what you've done with the place.
 [3] What's the shadow play you're watching?

>1
 Two of the denizens give a look that would usually accompany a cursory
 glance around in less cervical-rotational-inhibited examiners. One
 says, "What earmuffs?"

 [1] The ones your wearing.
 [2] Ah, my mistake: I must be mistaking a mass case of advanced
 ear-hair growth with earmuffs.

>1
 "I don't know what you're talking about," three of them say in unison.
 Given the differing inflection, they may not all have been replying to
 the same remark.

 [1] So . . . quite the cave system you've got here.
 [2] Cute manacles. Are they one-cuff-chains-all, or do they come in
 different sizes?
 [3] Are those shadows playing the Importance of Being Earnest on the
 wall over there, or is it Deformed Rabbit?

>2
 "I see no such thing!" replies one of the cave dwellers. "Nothing
 chains us here," rejoinders another.

 [1] How do explain the fact that you can't move?
 [2] Clearly the entire back catalogue of a bondage shop has been
 wasted on you if you don't even realise it's there.

>1
 "Oh, alright," admits one of them, "maybe we're a little chained up.
 It's not as if there's anything more inteesting to see behind us."

 [1] Other than the world of real forms as opposed to the shadow world
 you see before you?
 [2] What about colours and three dimensional objects?
 [3] There are many wondrous things out there -- like talking
 scarecrows, burning windmills and friendly barbers.

>1
 The denizens of the cave don't seem to heed your word, dismissing such
 things as metaphysical illusions.

 [1] How do feel about sitting in a dank little cave?
 [2] Do you spend all your time watching shadows, or is it only when
 adventurers come by with sources of light?

>2
 "What shadows?" asks a denizen to your left, her eyes affixed on the
 shadow play on the wall.

 [1] The ones you're watching -- shapes caused by objects partially
 blocking a source of light.
 [2] What else do you call the display you're watching?

>1
 "What we're watching," explains one of the denezins, "is the world go
 by. This is reality."

 [1] This isn't reality, it's the semblance of reality.
 [2] You're glued to an illusion.

>1
 The denizens don't seem to listen, preferring simply to continue to
 stare at the shadows on the wall.

 [1] So. . . nice cave system you've got here.

>1
 "What cave?" three of them chant from somewhere around the back row.
 The one you were addressing continues to stare ahead.

 [1] This cave. You know, the one you're sitting in.
 [2] My mistake, your cold damp dark cavernous environ isn't a cave.
 It's a foreshortened underground tunnel.

>1
 The denizen that you were originally addressing expresses his
 disbelief in mutters.

>talk to people
 There's nothing else worthwhile to say to the denizens. They're still
 chained to the cave floor, watching the shadow play.

 Plato's Cave
 The lantern's dim glow casts shadows across the walls of the cavern,
 which, oddly, seems not so much collossal as contrived. Raising the
 lantern, you read an etching over the eastern entrance to the cave:
 "Property of Plato." Casting it around, you notice a gap in the walls
 of the cavern that leads down further into the cave system. Chained
 down in the centre of the room, eyes affixed on your shadow playing on
 the wall, are the denizens of this cave. You make a bunny
 shadow-picture for them.

>find a telephone booth
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>go down

 Dank Catacomb
 You crawl resolutely down into a dank catacomb, pausing only to scrape
 wumpus dung from your feet. Here in the catacombs a horde of
 chattering bats fly amidst the staligmites and staligtites.

 One bat, looking particularly melancholy, hovers for a moment in front
 of your face. "I hate my life," it says, before fluttering sadly off.

>follow bat
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>listen
 The bats chitter and chatter, and would chutter as well, if it didn't
 sound so silly.

 You hear a bat circling above you humming a brutal-sounding song to
 itself.

>talk to bat
 "My, my, don't you look tasty," chatter the bats chitteringly.

 [1] Why, thank you.
 [2] I never foresaw the day when I'd be chat-up by bats.

>2
 A bat flies out from the group and droops dejectedly off a staligmite
 near you. "I'd savour it and leave before they savour you."

 [1] Savour me? I'm not going to be eaten am I?
 [2] You seem a tad melancholy.

>2
 "You would be too," the bat cries, "if the bloody secrets of your
 tortured soul were ignored by all the reputable philosophy journals."

 [1] Reputable philosophical journals? Pardon?
 [2] That's a very strange thing to be upset about.
 [3] Do explain.

>3
 The bat blinks sadly at you, brushing its fringe away from its eyes
 with a sweep of its tattered wing. "It's like this," it begins, in a
 voice resonant with murky emotion. "All the journals care about is
 zombies, zombies, zombies. None of them care to investigate the
 deepest, darkest revelations of the deep, dark mind of the vampire
 bat. No-one understands us! Nobody cares!

 [1] Well, I'm a philosopher -- perhaps I could spread the word?
 [2] Yes, I can certainly see how that would be pertinent to
 philosophy.
 [3] Gosh, that is tragic. Please do unclasp the bosom of your secret
 soul to me.

>1
 The bat hops towards you a little hopefully. "Really?" it says.
 "Really?" It looks down at its claws. "I've written a book, you know,"
 it whispers. "An autobiography. It has poems in it. Not that
 publishers do anything other than reject it. But perhaps . . . perhaps
 . . . ?" It looks towards you expectantly.

 [1] Oh, go on, give it here.
 [2] A vampire bat's verse autobiography? I'm positively quivering with
 excitement.

>1
 The bat pulls a tiny book from behind its wings and drops it to the
 ground in front of you with a little whimper. "Thank you," it says
 breathily, its fringe drooping lower and lower. "I'm going to go and
 feed on some virgins now to assuage my insatiable homicidal appetite
 for human blood. Thanks for listening." It takes off in an excited
 flurry and chitters away.

 Spooky Part of the Woods
  The fairytale woods seem to have shifted imperceptibly into the

 and blackened lightning struck trees.

 Turning east you can just about make out happier looking trees. All
 that you can see in this part of the woods is a mess of brambles.

>go east

 Fairytale Woods
 In the midst of the woods stand a Buddhist monk and a lumberjack
 engaged in a heated discussion as to whether a tree falling down in a
 forest makes a sound if nobody is around to hear it. Their debate is

 lumberjack's axe.

 The woods become more sinister looking to the west and the village
 street is back to the east.

>go east

 Village Street
 A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their

 to a square to the north. No-one, you notice, takes the road south --
 or heads along the routes east towards the storybook hills or west
 into the fairytale woods.

>go north

 Square
 The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.

 This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
 fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
 academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
 people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
 deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
 look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
 whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
 of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
 library, to the west, north and east respectively.

 Bat Lab
 The laboratory is a  brightly-lit white chamber, covered wall-to-wall
 in cabinets, posters, and counters covered with disturbing-looking
 instruments. A gigantic model of a bat hangs from the ceiling,
 spinning around gently. A white-haired man is moving fitfully around
 the room, grabbing instruments and examining diagrams, as he proceeds
 to dissect a series of what look worryingly like tiny brains. He's
 muttering something over and over again under his breath: "What is it
 like?" it seems to be. "What is it like? What is it like?"

>give book
 (the bat's autobiography to Nagel)
 You grab Nagel as he passes you, heading for the cabinets. "Here," you
 say. "I thought you might like this."

 He looks down at the book, wide-eyed. "Never . . . " he says. "Never
 in all my days . . . How did you get this?"

 "Just chatted to them, really," you reply.

 "Interesting," he says, already frantically flipping through the
 pages, waving a hand around the laboratory. "And I thought that all we
 could do was study them like this. But now . . . oh now . . . please,
 would you leave me with this? And would you look after these keys for
 me? They were given to me to look after by some old man in a toga when
 he saw how much time I spent in the caves gathering specimens. But I
 shan't need  . . . to go there . . . any more . . . "

 He drifts off into his own world, absorbed entirely by the book. You
 grab the bunch of keys from his outstretched hand, wondering what they
 could possibly open.

 waking up in time for the end:

 "Workers of the world unite!" a denizen exclaims, getting into the
 spirit of things, "You have nothing to lose but your chains!"

 "You know, I think she's right," pipes up another at the back.

 "I agree!" shouts another.

 "Wait a second," one says, "we're not workers. We've never done a
 day's work in our lives!"

 "Yes, Ted, but the oppression of the owners of the means of production
 clarifies and sharpens the class divide," explains the reader, "so as
 members of the collective oppressed classes we're made de facto
 working class."

 The voice known as Ted considers this for a moment, and then shouts,
 "Those thieving capitalist bastards! Let's go knock some heads!" With
 frantic calls for revolution and a classless society the denizens cast
 off their chains, and earmuffs, and storm outside in an angry mob.

 "I didn't hear that fall in the slightest!"

 "Aha!" exclaims the Buddhist, "so your premise that a tree always
 makes a sound when it falls is undermined!"

 Hill
 There's a great pyre here very slowly catching alight. Tied to a stake
 in the centre of the fire is a handsome woman looking deeply
 determined, though you suppose she'd look less composed if the fire
 wasn't so pitifully poor. At the base of the pyre, an imposing,
 bushy-bearded man in an ornate uniform is interrogating her intensely,
 in a way that appears to be making her all the more resolute.

 "Either way," she says, untying herself with a few wrenches at her
 ropes, "My thanks for proving me right. And, I suppose, as you've done
 something for me, I suppose the only consistent behaviour is for me to
 give you something in return."

 Climbing down from the now redundant pyre, she hands you a small box
 that had been concealed about her person.

 "Now inside this hermetically-sealed box," she says, "is the thing.
 The only thing that's truly consistent. If you ever need to dispel a
 dangerous illusion or establish a firm and coherent grounding, open
 this box. But it'll only work once. As soon as anyone senses the
 thing, it'll just become shrouded in appearance like everything else.
 So I suggest you only open this box when you really, really need it."

 With these words she disappears towards the village, leaving you alone
 with the final product of what can only be described as a viciously
 convoluted object-puzzle quest. You only hope it's worth it.

 Black Tarmac Road
 You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
 Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
 road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
 perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
 some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
 before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
 dunes, doing likewise to the west.

 The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

>go south
 Striking out south towards the castle, you soon realise what it is
 that lurks so strangely at the base of the crag. As the rock looms
 over you like ten tonne weight over a hapless clown, the road becomes
 a pebbly path leading into what is clearly an enormous maze.

 Outside the Maze
 You're standing at the entrance to a vast maze built of hedges that
 tower six feet above you. The path seems extravagantly narrow, as if
 the designer wanted to prepare the unwary adventurer from the outside.
 Above the entrance is a painted wooden sign. It looks important.

>SAVE
>cf11
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go south
 You step tentatively into the maze, looking askance at the lump of
 lead. Approaching a moral dilemma, it starts whirring wildly, and
 glowing cracks in the cube appear. It begins to unfold into an
 astonishingly complex device -- an array of dishes and balances, with
 an arrow mounted on top. With little else to do you follow the arrow
 past the dilemma. And then past the next -- and the next. Moral
 dilemmas seem not to be dilemmas at all before its power, and soon you
 emerge from the maze, breathless, at the foot of the crag that looms
 over this land.

 A winding path leads up the side of the crag, and you follow it,
 huffing and puffing, until you reach the top. Here, looming
 dangerously atop the already looming crag, sits a gigantic loom. No, a
 gigantic castle -- you were confused for a minute there. Behind you,
 this crazy world stretches out below. You take a deep breath. You
 feel, somehow, that you are near your goal -- whatever that may be..

 At the Foot of an Ivory Tower
 You are in a paved courtyard before the castle. Here, true to form, an
 ivory tower towers above you, the result of a billion poaching
 expeditions or more. Similarly true, a guard guards the broad stairs
 leading up to the tower.

 Below you is the vertiginous path down the side of the crag -- and
 below that stretches the world. The strangest thing of all, however,
 is the faint and ominous organ music on the periphery of your hearing.

 "No!" she says, pre-empting the merry greeting you had planned. "I

 guard, and thus I will guard this tower from you.

 You pick the veil up again. How tedious.

 You look shiftily from side to side, and when you assure yourself that
 nobody is watching, you cast the veil over the guard's helmet. For
 several long moments you wait. Hesitantly, you put a foot past the
 guard. She doesn't move.

 "Hello?" you whisper.

 "Excuse me, I seem to be completely ignorant to who I am and why I am
 here," she replies. "Can you help me?"

 You clamber up the stairs and through into the tower. The ivory wall,
 eased by its last descent, crashes down behind you before you can do
 anything. This is it, then.

 First Chamber
 Perfectly round and with walls of glistening ivory, this is definitely
 more of a chamber than a room. A huge sheet of ivory blocks the exit
 archway, while opposite it sits an ivory-panelled door, with a
 definite sense of being heavily locked about it. Through this door
 come the strains of atmospheric organ music you heard earlier, a
 little clearer, and a little more foreboding.

 None of this is the most striking thing about the chamber, however.
 The most striking thing is the fact that in the centre of the room
 buzz thousands of bees, all hovering stationary in a curiously-shaped
 cloud.

>insert fifty
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>put fifty in slot
 You insert the fifty pence piece into the slot, and instead of the
 usual clunks and whirrings of machinery, you hear a series of buzzes
 and organic-sounding thuds. Finally, a key drops into the little tray
 at the bottom of the machine.

>get key
 Which do you mean, the first key or the Chinese key?

>first
 Taking care not to disturb the bees, you pick up the key.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>unlock door
 What do you want to unlock the firstdoor with?

>first
 You unlock the door and open it, trembling with trepidation. Through
 the door lies another ivory staircase -- a spiral staircase which
 winds upwards towards another chamber.

 Second Chamber
 You are only a little surprised to find that this chamber is almost
 entirely identical to the first, with the same stairs leading down and
 the same huge door,  but for two minor details: firstly, the
 atmospheric organ music is ever so slightly louder; secondly, the
 machine in the centre of the room is both not made of bees and clearly
 a time machine. The clue is in the words "Time Machine" engraved on
 its casing.

 It's a smooth and very plain wooden box, with the mysterious words
 "Ding an Sich" inscribed on the lid. The martyr for truth told you to
 open it when you really needed to dispel an illusion. Is that time now
 . . . ?

>examine machine
 A feat of elaborate steelwork has wrought this magnificent device.
 There's what looks like a control booth perched in a torturous

 There's a red fake leather seat inside the booth, which rather spoils
 the image, as does the mouldy newspaper sitting on it. The chrome
 dials inside the booth are pretty nice, though.

 Are you sure you want to open it now?
>yes
 You eagerly open the box and look inside it. There is what appears to
 be . . . what can only be described as a thing. You have no idea what
 to do with it. It just sits there, in the box, thing-like. At least,
 that's how it seems to you. There is the vague sense about the thing
 that there's something more to it, something you can't get at -- but

 The one witness to the theft, a recently-engaged young security guard,
 said "I don't know how the bugger snuck past me -- all I know is,
 there was a flash of light from the exhibition room, the alarm goes
 off, I rushes in, and he clunks me one. Don't know what with, but it

 Outside the Maze
 You're standing at the entrance to a vast maze built of hedges that
 tower six feet above you. The path seems extravagantly narrow, as if
 the designer wanted to prepare the unwary adventurer from the outside.
 Above the entrance is a painted wooden sign. It looks important.

>go south
 You step tentatively into the maze, looking askance at the lump of
 lead. Approaching a moral dilemma, it starts whirring wildly, and
 glowing cracks in the cube appear. It begins to unfold into an
 astonishingly complex device -- an array of dishes and balances, with
 an arrow mounted on top. With little else to do you follow the arrow
 past the dilemma. And then past the next -- and the next. Moral
 dilemmas seem not to be dilemmas at all before its power, and soon you
 emerge from the maze, breathless, at the foot of the crag that looms
 over this land.

 A winding path leads up the side of the crag, and you follow it,
 huffing and puffing, until you reach the top. Here, looming
 dangerously atop the already looming crag, sits a gigantic loom. No, a
 gigantic castle -- you were confused for a minute there. Behind you,
 this crazy world stretches out below. You take a deep breath. You
 feel, somehow, that you are near your goal -- whatever that may be..

 At the Foot of an Ivory Tower
 You are in a paved courtyard before the castle. Here, true to form, an
 ivory tower towers above you, the result of a billion poaching
 expeditions or more. Similarly true, a guard guards the broad stairs
 leading up to the tower.

 Below you is the vertiginous path down the side of the crag -- and
 below that stretches the world. The strangest thing of all, however,
 is the faint and ominous organ music on the periphery of your hearing.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>go up
 You step up to the steps, whistling. The guard, clanking in her
 armour, steps resolutely in front of you.

 "No!" she says, pre-empting the merry greeting you had planned. "I
 shan't let you past. For I know that I am a guard and that guards
 guard, and thus I will guard this tower from you.

 You pick the veil up again. How tedious.

 You look shiftily from side to side, and when you assure yourself that
 nobody is watching, you cast the veil over the guard's helmet. For
 several long moments you wait. Hesitantly, you put a foot past the
 guard. She doesn't move.

 "Hello?" you whisper.

 "Excuse me, I seem to be completely ignorant to who I am and why I am
 here," she replies. "Can you help me?"

>turn right dial
 You turn the rightmost dial clockwise and release it -- with a ticking
 noise it begins to turn itself back the other way. When it reaches its
 starting point there is a sharp ringing noise and --

 You sit back as the time machine hums and whistles into life. The
 brass railing starts to shiver and shake and somewhere in the depths
 of the engine something goes "meow" in a fuzzy sort of way and a
 bright light washes over the booth. The day turns to night and then to
 day and back at ever-increasing speeds. After about eighteen thousand,
 two hundred and fifty flashes you arrive in the past.

 Around you appears to be a night-darkened museum exhibition. A clock
 on the wall, its hands simulacra of keys, indicates the time (or
 perhaps the simulacrum of time) to be  9:58. Given that the time
 machine doesn't seem to move spatially, the Ivory Tower must have been
 the International House of Keys some fifty years previously, or so the
 banner on the wall suggests.

 In the centre of the exhibition is a case displaying a key loaned by
 the H.G. Wells Reenactment Society. It has the number "2" engraved on
 it. With your axe to hand, you smash the case and grab the key.

 Immediately a heinous wailing fills the room, and lights flash in
 burning red -- the alarms have been set off! A security guard rushes
 in and rugby-tackles you. In defense you lash out with the axe, and to
 your horror the guard's head separates from his shoulders in a
 graceful arc of blood. The severed head, carried forward by its own
 momentum, smacks you in the chops -- and your horror is compounded by
 the fact that you immediately recognise -- though younger than you
 knew him -- your own grandfather.

 You barely have time to contemplate the fact that you have
 successfully broken the entire universe before you wink out of
 existence, along with the rest of all creation.

 Second Chamber
 [Previous turn undone.]

>open box
 You make to open the box, and then remember the martyr's instructions:

 "If you ever need to dispel a dangerous illusion or establish a firm
 and coherent grounding, open this box. But it'll only work once. As
 soon as anyone senses the thing, it'll just become shrouded in
 appearance like everything else. So I suggest you only open this box
 when you really, really need it."

 Are you sure you want to open it now?
>no
 You decide to leave the box closed for now.

>drop axe
 (first taking the axe from the sack)
 (putting the newspaper into the sack to make room)
 Dropped.

>turn right dial
 You turn the rightmost dial clockwise and release it -- with a ticking
 noise it begins to turn itself back the other way. When it reaches its
 starting point there is a sharp ringing noise and --

 You sit back as the time machine hums and whistles into life. The
 brass railing starts to shiver and shake and somewhere in the depths
 of the engine something goes "meow" in a fuzzy sort of way and a
 bright light washes over the booth. The day turns to night and then to
 day and back at ever-increasing speeds. After about eighteen thousand,
 two hundred and fifty flashes you arrive in the past.

 Around you appears to be a night-darkened museum exhibition. A clock
 on the wall, its hands simulacra of keys, indicates the time (or
 perhaps the simulacrum of time) to be  9:58. Given that the time
 machine doesn't seem to move spatially, the Ivory Tower must have been
 the International House of Keys some fifty years previously, or so the
 banner on the wall suggests.

 In the centre of the exhibition is a case displaying a key loaned by
 the H.G. Wells Reenactment Society. It has the number "2" engraved on
 it. You grab the nearest thing to hand -- a huge replica padlock --
 and with it smash the display the case, grabbing the key.

 Immediately a heinous wailing fills the room, and lights flash in
 burning red -- the alarms have been set off! A security guard rushes
 in and rugby-tackles you. Quickly you lash out with the novelty
 padlock, knocking the guard unconscious. Casting the padlock from you,
 you hop into the booth and set the dials to the present day.

 Safely back in the second chamber, you clamber out of the Time Machine
 and give it a quick kick.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>get axe
 (putting the second key into the sack to make room)
 Taken.

>out
 You get out of the Time Machine.

 Second Chamber
 This chamber is exactly like the one below it but for two minor
 details: firstly, the atmospheric organ music is ever so slightly
 louder; secondly, the machine in the centre of the room is both not
 made of bees and clearly a time machine. The clue is in the words
 "Time Machine" engraved on its casing.

>unlock door
 What do you want to unlock the seconddoor with?

>second
 (first taking the second key)
 (putting the axe into the sack to make room)
 You unlock the door and open it, trembling with trepidation. Through
 the door lies another ivory staircase -- a spiral staircase which
 winds upwards towards another chamber.

 Third Chamber
 A third ivory-walled room identical to the first to -- a doorway
 behind leading down to another chamber, and a door leading to what you
 can only assume to be another spiral staircase, and a bizarre machine
 in the centre of the room.

 Here, though, the organ music has grown even more ominous. Thunderous
 chords and trembling pipes reverberate throughout the room through the
 door. If ever music issued a warning of impending climax, this music
 does more.

>score
 You have scored 80 out of a possible 100 in 881 turns. Jolly well
 done.

>examine machine
 As with the Time Machine, this device has its name engraved on the
 casing in a large copperplate font -- "Turing Machine", it says. Again
 similarly, there's some kind of booth in the machine, complete with
 fake red leather seat. This booth lacks the steampunk wizardry of the
 Time Machine -- there's simply a glowing screen with a keyboard in
 front of it.

>think about turing
 Alan Turing (1912 - 1954) was an English mathematician and logician
 (and also, importantly, a cryptographer whose work on the Enigma
 machine in WWII proved essential) whose lasting legacy is in computer
 science and artificial intelligence. Turing's ideas on the
 functionality of computers are still central today, while his theories
 and tests for artificial intelligence are widely influential.

>examine screen
 You can't get a proper look at it without getting in the booth.

>listen
 It occurs to you for the first time that somebody must actually be
 playing this organ music -- a thought even more ominous than the music
 itself.

>get in booth
 You get into the machine and sit on the seat. The computer screen in
 front of you is displaying the word "Hello!" in garish green type,
 inviting a response.

>examine screen
 The computer screen is displaying a message in bright green letters.

>examine keyboard
 You can't get a proper look at it without getting in the booth.

>type hello
 The screen goes blank for a moment, and then another message appears:
 "That's what you think passes for a human-sounding response, is it?
 Hmm. What's your name, anyway?"

 The screen goes blank again and, sure enough, another message flashes
 up: "Oh, really? Well, if you say so. And what are you doing here? You
 know, what's your quest, sort of thing?"

 it is, so I shan't. Right. Last question: What's the fiftieth digit
 after the decimal place of pi?"

>3
 Your desire has passed beyond meaning.

>type 3
 There's a very long wait before the screen responds. Eventually, it
 displays a final message: "Oh, alright. That's a fairly human
 response, I suppose. You pass. Have a key." As you finish reading
 this, there's a swish electronic noise, a hitherto-unseen panel opens
 up, and a key falls onto the floor. You pick it up, as the panel
 closes into invisibility again, and the screen winks out.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>unlock door
 What do you want to unlock the thirddoor with?

>third
 (the third key)
 You unlock the door and open it, trembling with trepidation. Through
 the door lies another ivory staircase -- a spiral staircase which
 winds upwards towards another chamber.

 Fourth Chamber
 The organ playing is deafening here. It's echoing around the curved
 ivory walls, its descending scales and dark figures amplified and
 multiplying, a dense wall of foreboding music. The doorway and stairs
 behind you seem terribly inviting -- if you had any excuse to leave
 her, any unfinished business, you would scamper downstairs now.
 Otherwise -- another door lies on the other side of the chamber.

 But there is another machine between you and that door. And looking in
 that machine, you almost flee straight away: sitting on the red fake
 leather seat, wearing a peculiar helmet, is a grinning skeleton.

>examine helmet
 A large metal helmet, with a vizor and ear-plugs, attached to the
 casing of the machine by a long rubber cord.

>examine skeleton
 The yellowed and wasted skeleton is grinning broadly -- or perhaps
 that's just the effect of your skin dissolving into dust and your
 clothes into rotted rags about you. It's slumped in the machine,
 wearing a large metal helmet which covers most of its skull -- a vizor
 over its eye sockets, plugs in its ear holes, even a cord leading into
 its mouth -- leaving exposed only that awful, leering smile.

 The skeleton also seems to be clutching a peculiar hat in its bony
 hand.

>get hat
 Better leave it -- it's all there is to identify the poor adventurer
 by.

>examine hat
 It looks like the kind of cap worn by the nomads of Afghanisan to you.
 Presumably the skeleton -- when it was still an adventurer -- removed
 it to put on the helmet.

 awkward, put the little wired tab in your mouth. You wait expectantly
 for a moment, and then your ears are filled with the most beautiful
 voice you have ever heard. "Welcome," it says, in tones so perfect you
 could almost weep.

 And then, suddenly, your every sense and emotion is awash with

 You eagerly open the box and look inside it. There is what appears to
 be . . . what can only be described as a thing. You have no idea what
 to do with it. It just sits there, in the box, thing-like. At least,
 that's how it seems to you. There is the vague sense about the thing
 that there's something more to it, something you can't get at -- but
 all you seem to have is what appears to be -- a thing.

 First Chamber
 Perfectly round and with walls of glistening ivory, this is definitely
 more of a chamber than a room. A huge sheet of ivory blocks the exit
 archway, while opposite it sits an ivory-panelled door, with a
 definite sense of being heavily locked about it. Through this door
 come the strains of atmospheric organ music you heard earlier, a
 little clearer, and a little more foreboding.

 None of this is the most striking thing about the chamber, however.
 The most striking thing is the fact that in the centre of the room
 buzz thousands of bees, all hovering stationary in a curiously-shaped
 cloud.

>wear thing

>think about thing
 Your philosophical studies don't seem to have taught you anything

>think about ding an sich
 "Ding an sich" is Kant's German term meaning "the thing in itself". A
 thing in itself is something independent of awareness -- it is core to
 Kant's philosophy that we live in a world of appearances, the
 appearances created by a discursive mind which shapes them according
 to its own innate mental categories, but that "beneath" this world of
 appearances lies the world in itself, about which we can know nothing
 but that it exists.

 This distinction, also known as that between "phenomena" and
 "noumena", has been enormously influential. In epistemology, it
 overturned the rationalist/empiricist debate, by implying that we can
 only know the empirical world (and not the ideal truths of
 rationalism), but also by adding that we must know that empirical
 world rationally. The idea that there is a world of subjective
 awareness fed into later debates in philosophy of mind, while the idea
 that the world of appearances is discursively created led the way for
 the postmodern and post-structuralist revolution in philosophy, which
 dismantled philosophical dogmas and preconceptions as being culturally
 and linguistically specific, and which implied that all knowledge is
 to some extent chosen, discursively determined by interpreting minds.

 That revolution, as well as more analytic attacks on Kant's
 philosophy, has served to help undermine the phenomenal/noumenal
 distinction in the first place. Is there really a world of appearances
 present in consciousness? Is there really a world in itself
 independent of experience? These questions are the foundation of
 metaphysics to this day.

 It's a rather damp and extremely boring edition of The Times from
 1957. The only interesting item in it is a piece about an ongoing
 unsolved crime -- the theft of a priceless paracentric key from the
 key exhibition at the International House of Keys, loaned to the
 museum by the H.G Wells Reenactment Society.

 The one witness to the theft, a recently-engaged young security guard,
 said "I don't know how the bugger snuck past me -- all I know is,
 there was a flash of light from the exhibition room, the alarm goes
 off, I rushes in, and he clunks me one. Don't know what with, but it
 laid me out for hours -- I was lucky he didn't have a proper weapon
 with him."

 Fourth Chamber (in the Experience Machine)
 The organ playing is deafening here. It's echoing around the curved
 ivory walls, its descending scales and dark figures amplified and
 multiplying, a dense wall of foreboding music. The doorway and stairs
 behind you seem terribly inviting -- if you had any excuse to leave
 her, any unfinished business, you would scamper downstairs now.
 Otherwise -- another door lies on the other side of the chamber.

 You're in the Experience Machine. It's an uncomfortable booth,
 containing only a strange metal helmet, with a sorry looking pile of
 bones beside it.

>open door
 You push suspiciously against the ivory door. Sure enough, it eases
 open -- it wasn't locked! You take a regretful look at the pile of
 bones on the floor and make your way up the spiral stairs as the organ
 music fills your ears.

 As you step into the next chamber, a huge wall of ivory crashes down
 behind you, blocking the doorway. You, however, are too transfixed by
 the sight before you to even turn round.

 A vast organ fills much of this chamber, its huge bank of ornate pipes
 reaching higher than you can see. But even this, the biggest organ you
 have ever seen, is made to seem like a child's electronic keyboard by
 the figure that sits at it, back to you, playing the keys with vast,
 gnarled hands. It is a hulking brute of a figure, wearing a thick
 black cloak that ripples and flows as the figure plays and plays.

 Hearing the crash of the ivory wall, the figure pauses in its playing.
 Notes ring around the chamber as it pulls itself to its feet, casting
 the cloak to the ground and turning round.

 It is a hideous fiend. Two twisted horns sprout from its forehead; its
 skin is a burning red; its huge body taut with bulging muscle and its
 black-bearded face a picture of evil. It speaks, in a voice dark and
 deep:
 "Welcome."

 [1] Er . . . Hello.
 [2] Wait a minute: top of a tower, climactic organ music, evil villain
 . . . This is a d?noument, isn't it?
 [3] Horns, check. Red skin, check. Point beard, check. Bulging muscles

 The demon roars with laughter. "Correct, my fine young adventurer!" he
 bellows. "I am the Evil Demon, and this is my realm. How do you find
 it?"

 [1] It's . . . very nice.
 [2] Awful. I've been nearly gored by a unicorn, trodden in philosopher
 vomit, watched my mother almost get incinerated, and been emoted to by
 vampire bats. And that's your fault, I find now, is it?
 [3] I didn't find it, it found me. What's all this about?

 "Slow down, my hasty young friend," chides the demon mockingly.
 "First, I must know: I have carefully crafted this world to be
 confounding to your every sense, bedazzling to your mind and
 befuddling to your wits. Now tell me: was it not good?"

 [1] Yes, good, very good. Can I go now?
 [2] If by "good" you mean "mind-numbingly sadistic", then yes, it was
 good.
 [3] No, it was utterly horrible! Are you telling me you created this
 whole place?

>2
 "Indeed I do," replies the demon. "My thanks for your compliment. Now:
 to the fun!

 [1] Fun? Fun? What fun?
 [2] Wait, wait! Why me?
 [3] Sure, fun: but first I have to know: Where is this place? What am
 I doing here?

>3
 The demon smiles. "This is not a where," he says enigmatically. "Where
 you are, I do not know. This world -- this world is but an illusion of
 your mind. My powers of creation are but these: to control your every
 sensation, to sustain the representation of life in your
 consciousness. I am your world.

 And now I will be your death. We must duel!

 [1] This is a duel for my life, right?
 [2] (fight him)

>1
 "No," says the demon. "This is a duel to your death. Fight!"

 [1] (fight him)

>1
 The demon snaps his fingers -- his cloak and the organ behind him
 vanish with a sulphurous crack. He stands, all-powerful, staring you
 down.

 Not knowing what else to do, you lower your head and charge at him,
 screaming. Your eyes closed, you fail to see where you're going and,
 as he dodges easily out of the way, you smack straight into the ivory
 wall. As you reel back in a daze, staggering, the demon soars above
 you, fire flaring from his fingertips and smoke pouring from his
 nostrils. The chamber fills with his laughter.

 The demon extends his hand, and an enormous fireball careers towards
 you. You roll to the side just in time as the fireball crashes into
 the ivory floor, scorching the tiles.

>throw thing at demon
 You throw it at the demon, but he just catches it in his fist and
 crumbles it into dust.

 The demon crashes to the ground, the shockwaves throwing you against

 into the air.

 Philosophers are not yet supermen.

 The demon swoops down at you and smacks you with a huge clawed fist.
 You crash against the wall once more with the force of the blow.

 If only it were that simple.

 The demon conjures up an ethereal wind which launches you into the
 air, before dispelling it again and dropping you onto the ground with
 a sickening thud.

>go west
 You channel your will to power to summon a path in that direction.
 Sadly, nothing happens: you can't go that way.

 The demon lands in front of you and stares you in the eyes. There is a
 dreadful pause as you fall into the glowing hollows of his pupils, and
 then he punches you square in the stomach. As you collapse you think
 you hear the sound of ribs breaking.

>think about demon
 The Evil Demon rules over Western philosophy. He is one of the first
 thought experiments in its Modern period, devised by Descartes, the
 Father of Modern Philosophy.

 Descartes set out to determine what he could know using only the
 powers of his own rationality. He reasoned thus: there could be an
 Evil Demon controlling every aspect of my experience. Everything I
 think I know could be a false impression created by an Evil Demon to
 fool me. So what can I know by the use of reason alone? Descartes's
 first thought was that he knew with utter certainty that we was
 thinking -- for even if he only thought he was thinking, even if the
 Evil Demon was fooling him into thinking, that was still a thought. He
 could not doubt he was thinking, because doubt was a thought. So he
 was thinking. Cogito, ergo sum -- popularly translated as "I think,
 therefore I am".

 Descartes continued to think a lot more than that, but perhaps you'd
 better just think about this for a moment. First thought: this
 devision of what we reason and what we experience has ruled over much
 of Western philosophy. But why is reason more certain than experience?
 Couldn't the Evil Demon fool us into thinking that we were certain of
 our rationality as well? Couldn't we just as well think that direct
 experience, sitting safe in memory, is more reliable than waffly
 rationality? Second thought: how does Descartes get from the neat
 proof that he is thinking to the idea that he definitely exists? What
 about thought proves existence? Isn't just the humbler "Cogito" by
 itself better? Third thought: What do we mean by thoughts?

 There are huge questions even at the very root of the founding ideas
 of our philosophy.

 Fourth Chamber
 The organ playing is deafening here. It's echoing around the curved
 ivory walls, its descending scales and dark figures amplified and
 multiplying, a dense wall of foreboding music. The doorway and stairs
 behind you seem terribly inviting -- if you had any excuse to leave
 her, any unfinished business, you would scamper downstairs now.
 Otherwise -- another door lies on the other side of the chamber.

 But there is another machine between you and that door. And looking in
 that machine, you almost flee straight away: sitting on the red fake
 leather seat, wearing a peculiar helmet, is a grinning skeleton.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a third key

>get skeleton
 As you touch the skeleton, it slumps awkwardly out of the Machine and
 collapses, amid a cloud of choking dust, into a pile of bones on the
 floor of the chamber, clattering hollowly on the ivory. The headset
 swings down and bounces folornly on the end of its cord. There's an
 awkward silence.

 "Sorry about that," you say.

>get box

 You've got your hands a bit full. You're going to have to find a sack

>go up
 You push suspiciously against the ivory door. Sure enough, it eases
 open -- it wasn't locked! You take a regretful look at the pile of
 bones on the floor and make your way up the spiral stairs as the organ
 music fills your ears.

 As you step into the next chamber, a huge wall of ivory crashes down
 behind you, blocking the doorway. You, however, are too transfixed by
 the sight before you to even turn round.

 A vast organ fills much of this chamber, its huge bank of ornate pipes
 reaching higher than you can see. But even this, the biggest organ you
 have ever seen, is made to seem like a child's electronic keyboard by
 the figure that sits at it, back to you, playing the keys with vast,
 gnarled hands. It is a hulking brute of a figure, wearing a thick
 black cloak that ripples and flows as the figure plays and plays.

 Hearing the crash of the ivory wall, the figure pauses in its playing.
 Notes ring around the chamber as it pulls itself to its feet, casting
 the cloak to the ground and turning round.

 It is a hideous fiend. Two twisted horns sprout from its forehead; its
 skin is a burning red; its huge body taut with bulging muscle and its
 black-bearded face a picture of evil. It speaks, in a voice dark and
 deep:
 "Welcome."

 [1] Er . . . Hello.
 [2] Wait a minute: top of a tower, climactic organ music, evil villain
 . . . This is a d?noument, isn't it?
 [3] Horns, check. Red skin, check. Point beard, check. Bulging muscles
 ready to crush pun humans, check. You're an evil demon, aren't you?

 "Hah!" laughs the demon. "By and by, no doubt. But first: How do you
 find my realm?"

 [1] It's . . . very nice.
 [2] Awful. I've been nearly gored by a unicorn, trodden in philosopher
 vomit, watched my mother almost get incinerated, and been emoted to by
 vampire bats. And that's your fault, I find now, is it?
 [3] I didn't find it, it found me. What's all this about?

>1
 The demon chuckles once more at your response. "I somehow doubt you've
 found it so, as you've got this far. Tell me, did you not find it all
 at all strange?"

 Before you can respond he continues: "Of course you did. I designed it
 to be so. I have carefully crafted this world to be confounding to
 your every sense, bedazzling to your mind and befuddling to your wits.
 Now do tell me: was it not good?

 [1] Yes, good, very good. Can I go now?
 [2] If by "good" you mean "mind-numbingly sadistic", then yes, it was
 good.
 [3] No, it was utterly horrible! Are you telling me you created this
 whole place?

 "In a manner of speaking," answers the demon, his wrath mounting. "But
 enough talk -- to the fun!

 [1] Fun? Fun? What fun?
 [2] Wait, wait! Why me?
>1
 [3] Sure, fun: but first I have to know: Where is this place? What am
 I doing here?

 "Why, the d?noument," answers the demon. "The final duel!"

 [1] Wait, wait! First I have to know: Where is this place? What am I
 doing here?
 [2] This is a duel for my life, right?
 [3] (fight him)

 The demon smiles. "This is not a where," he says enigmatically. "Where

 The demon snaps his fingers -- his cloak and the organ behind him
 vanish with a sulphurous crack. He stands, all-powerful, staring you

 Not knowing what else to do, you lower your head and charge at him,

 as he dodges easily out of the way, you smack straight into the ivory

 The demon extends his hand, and an enormous fireball careers towards
 you. You roll to the side just in time as the fireball crashes into
 the ivory floor, scorching the tiles.

>open box
 You remember what the martyr said -- that the power of the Ding an
 Sich will dispel all illusion -- and wrench the box open.

 Immediately the room is filled with an extraordinarily bright light
 pouring forth from the box, which is quaking in your grasp. You cast
 it to the ground, and it skids along the ivory towards the Demon,
 showering sparks in all directions.

 You look up at the Demon's stricken face -- he is gasping, his eyes
 bulging -- he is clawing himself away from the burning light. You
 shield your eyes from the sight, but you can still hear his hellish
 bellows -- they echo round the chamber, growing louder and louder, and
 all you can hear is the noise and the light is burning through your
 eyelids . . .
>look

 Suddenly all is quiet and still. You open your eyes. The demon has
 vanished -- and so has the box. There is a dull, whistling sound. The
 walls of the ivory chamber, you realise, look wrong -- thin, weakened
 somehow. They are growing strangely transparent, but instead of the
 blue skies beyond there's a strange darkness. You look down, and
 realise that the same is happening to the floor beneath your feet.

 Soon the ivory tower has vanished entirely. You're falling, and
 beneath you you see the lights of the village wink out one by one. The
 now-dark ocean is rolling up the beach, and the plains seem to be
 melting away. You feel the air rushing by as the rocky ground comes
 rapidly up to meet you, ready to crush your helpless body. The end is
 coming.








 . . .








 . . . ugh . . .








 . . . bleurgh . . .








 You didn't expect the afterlife to smell vaguely of vomit, which was
 the first clue. When you opened your eyes and realised that the dull
 pressure on your noise was due to the way it was squashed into the
 scratchy carpet, that was the second clue. The third was when you
 rolled over and saw your own bedroom ceiling.

 Your own blessed room. Your own blessed hangover. Your own blessed
 dried pool of sick lying beside you.

 You pull yourself gingerly to your feet. You're still wearing your
 watch -- and it's telling the time and date you'd expect it to. For a
 moment you worry you're going to be late for the morning's lecture,
 and the wild dreams of the night are already fading from memory. Then
 you remember: term's over. You've nothing to do but lie around all day
 long, recovering from the previous festivities. And then, tonight,
 with your classmates, you fully intend to start a fantastic bonfire,
 and burn every single one of your lecture notes.

 You realise you're still gripping something in your hand. You open it
 -- and there it is, lying in your palm. A tiny key, with a little
 Chinese symbol engraved on it.

 You look at it for a while, and then go to fetch a mop and bucket.
