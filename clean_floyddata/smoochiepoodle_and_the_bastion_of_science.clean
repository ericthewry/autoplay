 You smile an easy, confident smile. "Professor Zzar! I might have
 known!" He stands there on the gleaming deck of the Self-Righteous,
 small and frail in the finely tuned sights of your ray pistol.

 "Yes, Captain Galactic, it is I." For a cornered villain, destined for
 20 kilodays' hard labor on the Penal Asteroids of Incarceron, Zzar
 seems awfully smug. What's his game this time?

 There is a deep thrumming from the plastic orb in the Professor's
 hand, and a hypnotic, throbbing light. Evil technology! Your ray slips
 to the deck with a clatter. Your legs seem to melt like Arcturan
 worm-butter, and you slump against a bulkhead. Now the universe is
 only the grinning face of your arch-foe, gloating before you!

 "You're entering a Level IX Subconscious Psychic Comatose Preservation
 State, Captain Galactic," he sneers. "I don't even need to kill you to
 claim the galaxy as my own. My reign begins now, and you're going to
 spend the rest of your life on display in my Museum of Conquests ...
 sleeping through it!"

 Then there is only darkness, and laughter. Peals of terrible,
 victorious laughter.

 Science Station Alpha
 Aha! Your months of Grade Seventy Dream Training have paid off ...
 this dream-chamber is none other than Science Station Alpha, on the
 surface of a distant moon of the Visceron System. Here is where you
 and the Professor first crossed rays, and where his studies of
 sleep-states led him to develop the "perfect" preservative level of
 slumber: the Level IX Subconscious Psychic Comatose Preservation
 State.

 Professor Zzar believes that this state is inescapable ... and he's
 nearly right ... but here is also where the only known exception was
 proven, and recorded in the highly secret Omega Document! Now, if only
 you can locate it ...

 You can see Zippy, George, Abelard, Ickstein, Chunky, and the Omega
 Document here.

 As good-looking as ever.

>read document
 Stars of zetox! These dreams do have their conveniences; the fabled
 Omega Document, right out in the open! It's a detailed report ...
 science this, oxytocin that, blood pressure the other thing ... but
 the conclusion is clear enough: nocturnal emissions generated within a
 Level IX Subconscious Psychic Comatose Preservation State interrupt
 the sleep-state and result in full wakefulness. So, your mission is
 plain: amp up the erotic content (E.C.) of this dream, and you'll ride
 to freedom on your on manly issue. So to speak.

 Zippy is a monkey. He's playing with his teeth.

 Who do you mean, Zippy, George, Abelard, Ickstein, or Chunky?

 That's very sweet.

 Ickstein begins chewing something.

 Chunky is the kind of monkey you'd normally expect to be seeing,
 hearing, or speaking no evil (thus insuring six more weeks of evil).
 He's yawning.

>spank monkey
 Who do you mean, Zippy, George, Abelard, Ickstein, or Chunky?

>spank zippy
 But Zippy hasn't done anything wrong!

 (if you're trying to ... engage in some private time? ... you'll just
 need to phrase things a little differently under the circumstances)

 Zippy arches an eyebrow as you try.

>zippy, kiss george
 Zippy has better things to do.

 You're carrying nothing.

 You notice that Ickstein is avoiding your gaze.

>examine ickstein
 Ickstein is a monkey. He's scratching himself.

 be the better word).

 Laboratory
 This is the core of the Science Station's efforts to improve the
 technology of the Good and Trustworthy Galactic Empire, the facility's
 main laboratory. The place is packed to bursting with sensors,
 workstations, and delicate instruments, focusing mankind's collective
 knowledge into the breakthroughs of the future.

 Carolyn is here, brushing down her skirt absentmindedly.

 You can also see Nason, Qwerty, Shingles, Papa, and Frank here.

>examine carolyn
 Doctor Professor Carolyn Winters, the only scientist in the history of
 the Imperial University to get her Professorial Doctorate in
 Omniopanology before she could legally drink. That was a while ago,
 and you've shared a few victory rounds of Martian Mead with the good
 Doctor Professor since, but you've never had the nerve to pursue your
 interest in her. Your duties as a Captain in the Imperial Naval Forces
 Against Evil occupy your every waking hour ... a personal life is one
 of those things that come with retirement.

 You sigh. You sure wouldn't mind retiring with Carolyn, and you've
 always suspected she feels the same. She cocks her hip just-so while
 examining some kind of readout, and you find your eyes drawn to the
 perfect curve of her hip, moving softly beneath her smartly-ironed
 standard-issue scientist skirt.

>talk to carolyn
 Carolyn gives you a wink and says "Hey there, handsome," but it's
 obvious she's distracted by her scientific work.

 Nason starts looking pretty bored.

>examine nason
 Nason is some manner of monkey. He's bobbing idly on his haunches.

>examine qwerty
 Qwerty is a monkey. He's rocking in place.

>examine shingles
 Shingles is a monkey. He's playing with his teeth.

 Nason is bobbing idly on his haunches.

>ask carolyn about work
 Carolyn gives you a wink and says "Hey there, handsome," but it's
 obvious she's distracted by her scientific work.

>seduce carolyn
 Hm?

 I'm not sure what you're referring to.

 No need to mess with that.

 Qwerty is slapping the floor beside him.

>kiss carolyn
 You can't bring yourself to ... but just the thought of it is
 thrilling.

>examine hip
 Apologies. You've stumped me. Could you rephrase that?

>qwerty, kiss carolyn
 Qwerty has better things to do.

>examine skirt
 Oh my god she's amazing. Whenever you see her in that skirt, you
 always have this ungentlemanly urge to lift it, just for a second ...
 just to see ... but of course, you never have.

 Frank is rocking in place.

>lift skirt
 Gods of Galactron yes, you've always wanted to lift her skirt ...
 always wanted ...

 And you should. Now of all times, you should. This is a dream. You can
 do this.

 Not yet. You're not quite ... you need some more stimulation. That'll
 get you in the right mindset to finally do this.

 Oh my god she looks good in that skirt.

 Computer Chamber
 The X9-7000 supercomputer fills this room almost entirely, bank after
 bank of glittering golden lights and flutering dial indicators. The
 computer's vast monitor is currently dark. The supercomputer is
 operated by means of a large red button, set smartly into the console.

 You can see Chuck, Victor, Jamba, Troy, and Stinky here.

 You see nothing special about the large red button.

>go east

 Tank Bay
 Your footfalls clank on the cold metal floor of this chamber, built to
 house and launch the station's experimental military vehicles. The
 west corridor leads back to the station proper, and the giant (sealed)
 bay door leads out to the deadly surface of this remote moon.

 You can see Duke, Toby, Rick, Eamon, Grimble, and a Stealth Megatank
 here.

 Eamon is chewing something.

>examine megatank
 You can barely see it, it's so darned stealthy. You feel aroused just
 basking in the dark presence of such sleek, focused, military power.
 You can't help but notice the hatchway, and wonder what it would be
 like inside such a majestic beast.

>examine eamon
 Eamon is a monkey. He's looking at you quizzically.

 Rick begins looking at you wide-eyed.

>examine hatchway
 You don't need to use the word "demagoguery" to complete this story.
 Not that you did, but you managed to confuse me, anyway.

>open hatchway
 I'm not sure what you're referring to.

>enter tank

 Cockpit
 The interior of the Stealth Megatank is amazing. Even the lights on
 the controls seem to be glowering with awesome military purpose.
 You're settled into the command chair, since the other stations are
 all occupied by monkeys. The only exit from here is out.

 You notice a well-thumbed copy of Spicy Space-Sirens Magazine folded
 over one of the controls.

 You can also see Lala, Bobo, Vance, Ulster, and Duggy here.

 Duggy is yawning.

>read magazine
 Given the current nature of your mission, you feel a little ashamed
 for your normal treatment of soldiers under your command who enjoy
 this kind of ... artistic material. But now is not the time for your
 notions of perfect purity, nor is it the time to cry over spilled
 managerial milk. Steeling your resolve, you page eagerly through
 holophoto after holophoto of sultry spacefaring pulchritude, and feel
 a little dizzy at the sight of all those fantasy images ... the curve
 of leg and bosom, the shape of the lower back, the way a girl can
 smile so wickedly for the camera ... you feel your breathing begin to
 race, and ... you enjoy it.

>take magazine
 Taken.

>examine controls
 You've caught my vocabulary with its pants down, so to speak.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>drive west
 (I don't know the word "absquatulate") ... (or that thing you just
 typed)

>out
 You prepare to climb out of the tank, but you're interrupted by a loud
 CLANG as Vance slams the hatch shut, and the other monkeys begin
 firing up the engine!

 You don't know if monkeys really laugh, but Duggy sure seems to be
 chuckling as he cranks up some tunes on the tank's stereo.

 Outside the tank, the great door opens in a fanfare of rotating yellow
 safety lights, and you find yourself hurtling at top speed across the
 surface of an alien moon. The monkeys, now seemingly unaware of what
 they've done, are simply hopping around you and screeching, and you
 must rely on your instincts and training to bring the vehicle under
 control, and bring it back home.

 You figure giving it a little spin around the high ridges won't hurt,
 just to feel the way she handles. Oh yeah.

 Feeling exhausted, thrilled, and strangely satisfied, you eventually
 return to base, lock the systems down, and head back into the Tank Bay
 - after giving those monkeys a stern looking-at.

 Shingles begins bobbing idly on his haunches.

>lift skirt
 Chastity ... is a virtue ...

 You've always taught that. Always believed it. Always shouted it, if
 need be, into the faces of children and parents at your autograph
 signings.

 But inside, you've always felt differently, and buried those feelings
 deep within your endless quest for peace and justice in the galaxy.
 And (your analyst insists) sublimated it into a dangerously acute case
 of Ovaltine addiction.

 But now, discarding chastity is the mission. This dream needs to get
 wet, and by the Nine Quasars, you can't think of anything wetter than
 the contents of Carolyn's skirt.

 Oh my god, did you just think that? You hope you didn't say it.

 Carolyn turns and gives you a smile made of sunshine, sweetness, and
 the Scientific Method. "Hey, handsome, how goes the war against evil?
 Kill any Zarg for us lately?"

 Deer in the headlights. That's what this feels like. For the deer. And
 possibly the headlights. The galaxy freezes for a few minutes.

 Or a picosecond? Heck yes. You fall back on your academy training,
 flash her a comparably warm smile in return, and salute. "Sure have,
 Carol. Nineteen last week. Strangled half of them with my bare hands,
 and made one of them eat his own skull."

 Carolyn winks. "That's my boy," and returns to her work, leaning over
 the work table and wiggling her hips to a jaunty tune inside her head.

 What is it you were doing again? You've forgotten.

 Oh right. You find yourself aiming a 900-watt stare at the curve of
 her beskirted backside. Dear sweet fucking galaxies, you want to lift
 that skirt.

 Nason is playing with his teeth.

>give magazine to carolyn
 Carolyn gives you a wink and says "Hey there, handsome," but it's
 obvious she's distracted by her scientific work.

 Qwerty is slapping the floor beside him.

>lift skirt
 You reach out your hand, casually, as if it were going to be heading
 in this direction anyway, for official purposes.

 You pause to wonder: can you move your own hand offhandedly? Does that
 even work?

 Fortunately, the quality of Carolyn's ass returns you almost forcibly
 to the skirt at hand. Oh, yes, at hand, very much at hand ... and you
 just do it. You lift it.

 Carolyn doesn't turn around. Instead, she giggles for a second, then
 almost purrs as she says "Oh, Captain, I'd begun to worry you'd never
 ..."

 But even her words, her beautiful voice, fades from your mind as you
 take in the view.

 Blue panties. Soft, gentle blue. Almost translucent fabric. And right
 on the right cheek, the Imperial Seal, indicating the panties are
 government-issue.

>examine panties
 (press any key)








 ... That ... that was it! That was IT.

 You feel yourself cresting, hurling over the edge of internal
 stimulation. It's ... it's nice.

 The rest happens so fast, it's almost a blur. Fortunately, your
 academy training has prepared you for situations exactly like this
 (exactly like this; it took you three tries on the final exam, you
 were so embarrassed).

 You're no longer in the dream state. You're in Professor Zzar's
 twisted "Museum," on display. Stark naked!

 And there's the Professor himself, looking confused, furious, and
 annoyed all at once. He's wiping something from his eyeglasses and
 grimacing.

 But before you even fully assimilate your surroundings, your training
 kicks in, and you feel the rush of your reflexes thrusting into
 action: one foot to Zzar's solar plexus, one fist to the his jaw (hm
 ... sticky), one fist to his throat, sending him gasping backward.
 You're such a perfectly-tuned fighting machine, you've beaten your
 arch-foe to a whining pulp before you even yawn your first yawn, snap
 your fingers for a towel, and await the adulation of the morning
 museum crowd (looks like they get complimentary mimosas, that's kind
 of cool ... and monkeys ... free monkeys with every ...)

 Hm.

 And then the world dissolves again, and it's like surfacing from a
 dry, mucky cocoon into a warm, blankety one.

 It's your bed, at home. Your dog is asleep near the window,
 half-curled around your cardboard Captain Galactic standee. He knows
 enough never to hurt it.

 Scattered around the bed are your Captain Galactic comics, paperbacks,
 and your duplicate twelve-inch Nubile Star-Empress action figure (your
 first one is still in its original packaging, mint condition).

 You can hear the vacuum cleaner running in the hall, and smell
 breakfast. That combination means its Saturday, and if you behave at
 the breakfast table, Mom will let you watch Captain Galactic
 Adventures without bothering you, and then you can go meet your
 friends down at the bar.

 Your eyes rest on the cover of Captain Galactic and the Slave Wenches
 of Jara, in which the brave Captain is too pure and chaste to kiss
 even a single one of the grateful rescued slaves. You wonder, and not
 for the first time, if that's the virtue the Captain seems to think it
 is.

 Gah. You messed up the sheets again. Time to hide them in the hamper
 before anyone notices. Your story, as always, is that you're really
 trying to be more responsible and clean with the bedclothes. It's only
 fair; Dad doesn't charge you any rent, and you graduated high school
 seven years ago.

 You're thirsty. But that's what orange juice is for. And breakfast
 smells good.

 There is darkness, and pain at the back of your head. Basic urges flow
 through your lizard brain, air, food, rest, smoochies, video games.
 After who knows how long you open your eyes. You're in some kind of
 interrogation room, small, cramped. The stone carvings on the
 moss-covered walls make this look like a lazily designed secret room
 from a videogame. With you in the room is a gorilla in a suit, who
 looks a bit like Ron Perlman. Only this gorilla has rocket launchers
 for arms. You close your eyes. "Oh no" you think to yourself, "not
 again."

 And then you remember. The secret mission, from the new boss, who does
 look something like Michael Gambon: "Somewhere in the Brazilian
 jungle, there is a new mastermind at work. We know very little, only
 that he killed our best agent, Bonathan Jlask. And that he's hidden in
 some secret temple. Well, we've heard you know how to find such
 places. And how to get into them." You told him you're retired. "No"
 he said, firmly. "People like you never are." You were about to
 respond, but his secretary, the spitting image of Kirsten Dunst,
 already handed you the tickets.
 Flash forward. The gorilla is looking at you. "What were you doing
 here?"

 1) "What do you mean? I am a botanist. I was looking for a special
 plant."
 2) "I am a secret agent for the world government!"

>1
 "I left the next biggest town a few days ago. My only companion was my
 guide, who did look a bit like Alfred Molina. Anyhoo, soon we arrived
 here and after some searching we found the plant. But then my guide
 fell into a hole. Some guide, I tell I attached my rope to a nearby
 statue. Only the statue had to be weighed down with sand from the
 nearby beach first, which I put in the linen bags which carried the
 clothes. Then I climbed down the hole. Down there, I felt like being
 eaten by a grue so I switched on my lamp. Only it didn't have any
 batteries. And my box full of batteries was guarded by a snake. I
 found a toy mouse to distract it, so I got my batteries. They were the
 wrong size. But with them, I could switch on the venilator for
 Professor Bunglay, who in turn gave me his electric shaver, which did
 hold the right batteries. So I went back down there again, but when I
 finally could see, I didn't see my guide, I saw a sleeping tiger!"

 1) "I then decided to sneak up to it."
 2) "I then decided to wait a bit."
 3) "I probably should tell you about the plant!"

>1
 The gorilla tries to wave his rocket launchers dismissively. He fails.
 He then says, "Who are you trying to fool? You wouldn't approach a
 dangerous animal if you were,  indeed, a renowned botanist. You know
 what I think you are? You are  AFGNCAAP, the famous IF agent. I have a
 hard time making out anything specific about you, and that's just odd
 for a fictional world that has something as weird as a me, a gorilla
 with rocket launchers for hands! So tell me, am I right?"

 1) "Yes, I am a secret agent. My mission is to kill you."
 2) "No. See, this is CYOA. It doesn't even have a parser or an
 inventory!"
 3) "Yeah, a gorilla with rocket launcher hands. That *is* odd. Please
 tell me your story."

 "Many a year ago, I was a happy AI in a rocket launcher, the newest
 and deadliest in weapons technology. Straight on our way to skynet, we
 were. But then some crazy scientist attached a gorilla to me. And now
 see I how look. Completely stupid! That's why I want to take over the
 world. Anyway, let me reiterate my question."

 The gorilla tries to wave his rocket launchers dismissively. He fails.
 He then says, "Who are you trying to fool? You wouldn't approach a

 3) "Yeah, a gorilla with rocket launcher hands. That *is* odd. Please

 The gorilla, moving his rocket launcher not unlike someone handling
 chopsticks for the first time, puts three items down before you. A
 brass lantern, an elven sword and a platinum bar. Sweat breaks out on
 your brow. Oh no. He's on to you. "Now tell me, Mr. or Mrs.
 AFGNCAAP...what would be your first action if I do this...?"
  And, pressing a button on his one launcher with his other launcher,

 Quicker than you can say cutscene, you're tied up again. The gorilla
 looks at you. "You know, I always envied you. Getting all the
 treasures, defending all those thiefs. Solving all those fiendish
 puzzles. But now look. What has the world come to? All these angsty
 protagonists with their guilt-ridden backstories, all these branching
 narratives. You live in a world that no longer needs you. The puzzle
 is dead. But don't worry, soon are you!"
 With that, he lifts his rocket launcher!

 1) Try to get back to that one childhood memory you always shut out,

 2) Choose any incidental memory that just happens to pop up.

 Okay, you finally reconcile with all she has said and done. After all
 those items in her old house triggered those memories, you feel like
 you finally understood her. You have grown yourself, in the
 intervening years. You now longer wear the innocent face of a child or
 the self-righteous, stern look of a teenager. You're grown. Maybe you
 have grown to forgive. Who kno..Sorry to interrupt, but you're being
 blown apart by a rocket launcher.

 There is darkness, and pain at the back of your head. Basic urges flow
 through your lizard brain, air, food, rest, smoochies, video games.
 After who knows how long you open your eyes. You're in some kind of
 interrogation room, small, cramped. The stone carvings on the
 moss-covered walls make this look like a lazily designed secret room
 from a videogame. With you in the room is a gorilla in a suit, who
 looks a bit like Ron Perlman. Only this gorilla has rocket launchers
 for arms. You close your eyes. "Oh no" you think to yourself, "not
 again."

 And then you remember. The secret mission, from the new boss, who does
 look something like Michael Gambon: "Somewhere in the Brazilian
 jungle, there is a new mastermind at work. We know very little, only
 that he killed our best agent, Bonathan Jlask. And that he's hidden in
 some secret temple. Well, we've heard you know how to find such
 places. And how to get into them." You told him you're retired. "No"
 he said, firmly. "People like you never are." You were about to
 respond, but his secretary, the spitting image of Kirsten Dunst,
 already handed you the tickets.
 Flash forward. The gorilla is looking at you. "What were you doing
 here?"

 1) "What do you mean? I am a botanist. I was looking for a special
 plant."
 2) "I am a secret agent for the world government!"

 "I left the next biggest town a few days ago. My only companion was my
 guide, who did look a bit like Alfred Molina. Anyhoo, soon we arrived
 here and after some searching we found the plant. But then my guide
 fell into a hole. Some guide, I tell I attached my rope to a nearby
 statue. Only the statue had to be weighed down with sand from the
 nearby beach first, which I put in the linen bags which carried the
 clothes. Then I climbed down the hole. Down there, I felt like being
 eaten by a grue so I switched on my lamp. Only it didn't have any
 batteries. And my box full of batteries was guarded by a snake. I
 found a toy mouse to distract it, so I got my batteries. They were the
 wrong size. But with them, I could switch on the venilator for
 Professor Bunglay, who in turn gave me his electric shaver, which did
 hold the right batteries. So I went back down there again, but when I
 finally could see, I didn't see my guide, I saw a sleeping tiger!"

 1) "I then decided to sneak up to it."
 2) "I then decided to wait a bit."
 3) "I probably should tell you about the plant!"

 Coca (Erythroxylum coca) is a plant in the family Erythroxylaceae,
 native to western South America. The plant plays a significant role in
 traditional Andean culture. Coca is best known throughout the world
 because of its alkaloids, which include cocaine, a powerful stimulant.
 The plant resembles a blackthorn bush, and grows to a height of 2-3 m
 (7-10 ft). The branches are straight, and the leaves, which have a
 green tint, are thin, opaque, oval, and taper at the extremities. A
 marked characteristic of the leaf is an areolated portion bounded by
 two longitudinal curved lines, one line on each side of the midrib,
 and more conspicuous on the under face of the leaf.
 The flowers are small, and disposed in little clusters on short
 stalks; the corolla is composed of five yellowish-white petals, the
 anthers are heart-shaped, and the pistil consists of three carpels
 united to form a three-chambered ovary. The flowers mature into red
 berries.
 The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of the moth Eloria
 noyesi.

 Species and classification

 There are twelve main species and varieties. Two subspecies,
 Erythroxylum coca var. coca and Erythroxylum coca var. ipadu, are
 almost indistinguishable phenotypically; a related high
 cocaine-bearing species has two subspecies, Erythroxylum
 novogranatense var. novogranatense and Erythroxylum novogranatense
 var. truxillense that are phenotypically similar, but morphologically
 distinguishable. Under the older Cronquist system of classifying
 flowering plants, this was placed in an order Linales; more modern
 systems place it in the order Malpighiales.
 Cultivation


 Coca tree in Colombia

 Coca is traditionally cultivated in the lower altitudes of the eastern
 slopes of the Andes (the Yungas), or the highlands depending on the
 species grown. Since ancient times, its leaves have been an important
 trade commodity between the lowlands where it is grown and the higher
 altitudes where it is widely consumed by the Andean peoples of Peru,
 Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia and northwestern Argentina.

 The gorilla tries to wave his rocket launchers dismissively. He fails.
 He then says, "Who are you trying to fool? You wouldn't approach a
 dangerous animal if you were,  indeed, a renowned botanist. You know
 what I think you are? You are  AFGNCAAP, the famous IF agent. I have a
 hard time making out anything specific about you, and that's just odd

 The gorilla, moving his rocket launcher not unlike someone handling

 Like a stubborn idea hammered into a pupil's head by a determined
 teacher, the rocket launcher clicks. "Uh?" says the gorilla. "Must
 reactive it. Sorry for the hassle. This'll just take a second."

 1) Do nothing, as it looks like you can do nothing. Just wait for
 death. Nothing to do. No, no. Just see another death message.

>papers
 While the gorilla is distracted, you bend the paperclip into a
 lockpick and you are free. As he sees this, the brute follows clich?
 instead of logic and runs away! You are right behind him , through
 endless, winding catacombs, always nearly but never quite losing him,
 as he rounds a corner or climbs some vines. Finally, there is blinding
 daylight! You blink into it, as you see your enemy jump into one of
 two waiting, ostrich-pulled chariots. You jump into the second one and
 whip the ostriches into moving! (Probably breaking some Protection of
 Animals Act.) Speaking of harmed animals, there is a ridiculously cute
 baby sloth in the middle of the road!

 1) You drive over it, gaining more speed.
 2) You swerve around.

>2
 Woosh! The baby sloth looks at you with big, thankful eyes. This will
 have no gameplay consequences whatsoever. I am making an important
 point about morality in games here!

 The exciting chase (music not included) leads you up a stony mountain
 path. It grows smaller and smaller, but you gain on the gorilla. He
 sees you behind him and pulls his reins to the right, to crash, er,
 right into you! You have to make a quick decision!1! No time to lose
 !11!1

 1) You decide to slow your ostriches a bit.
 2) You decide to whip your ostriches into full speed.
 3) You decide to swerve into him yourself!

>SAVE

 You decide to ram the gorilla! This works better than expected. Both
 chariots get wedged into each other, and soon you both swerve off the
 road and tumble down the mountain in a twisted mass of ostrich,
 chariot, gorilla and player character. You are swallowed by the green
 of the jungle. You are food for the insects, etc. This is not the
 optimal ending, in case you're wondering.

 You slow down, and predictably, the gorilla swerves his chariot -
 right into thin air! Ostriches and chariot dance the same old, short
 and painful dance with gravity, but the gorilla clinges to the edge of
 the rock. He can't really get a grip with his rocket launcher, though,
 and he slides downwards ever so slowly. "LISTEN!" he screams,
 scrambling. "This is bigger than you and me. Bigger than everything! I
 can give you names, addresses, phone numbers, twitter names, flickr

>go north

 Main Plaza
 From this vantage point, you can see most of the north face of your
 Mother Tree.  Far above you is Citadel Bleph, founded by your own
 great ancestors generations ago.  Far below, all details of the
 surface are lost to haze.  You can vaguely discern the great Milk Sea,
 and the Rainbow Spot within it.

 A stairway winds its way upwards to an observatory.  It also continues
 winding downwards until it eventually reaches a research station.  The
 rest of the city, and beyond its walls other cities around other
 Mother Trees, could be visited by other paths.  But your path lies
 elsewhere.

 Ancient and immense beyond measure, the Mother Tree is the foundation
 of your entire civilization.  It provides scale and oil, it provides
 shelter, it provides a reason for living.

>examine sea
 You can't see any such thing.

>go down

 Research Station
 This building is among the lowest on the Mother Tree, although it
 remains safely above the surface.  The research pod is here, waiting
 to take you down to the surface, where you are expected to retrieve
 the asteroid.

>examine pod
 It is a small vessel, designed for one person at most.  It is raised
 and lowered by a cable.

>enter pod
 Research Pod
 The research pod is incredibly cramped.  There's just enough room for
 two levers: one labeled DOWN and the other UP.  There's also a small
 window.

>eat lever
 Which do you mean, the down lever or the up lever?

>pull down
 (the down lever)
 You give the lever labeled DOWN a push, and you quickly find yourself
 plummeting downwards.  This continues for several minutes, until
 there's a mighty screeching sound, and you find yourself at a
 standstill.

>examine window
 It's a tiny opaque window; barely large enough to steal a glimpse
 through.  A large plaque immediately below the window has this
 message: "WARNING:  Do not open window in transit."  The window is
 closed.

>open window
 You open the window.

>out
 You would plummet to your death.

>enter window
 That's not something you can enter.

>look through window
 Ignoring the admonition of the warning sign, you gaze out through the
 window.

  Far below, you can clearly see the Milk Sea, stretching out to an
 impossibly-distant horizon.  In its center, the colourful Rainbow Sea,
 perfectly round.  And in the center of that sea, you perceive yet
 another concentric round sea, this one of inky darkness.

  By the Mother Tree -- you comprehend the whole in one terrible
 instant.  This is no sea, no ocean.  You gaze down upon the
 garguantuan eye of some unimagineably immense creature, some god.  All
 you have known, or ever will know, is nothing but the tiniest speck in
 comparison.  Yet you cannot shake the feeling that even as you look
 down in awe, this behemoth is gazing back.

 Your mind is shattered; perhaps another can complete your mission, or
 perhaps your civilization is doomed.

 Signals Observatory
 This building is dominated by enormous telescopes and other optical
 instruments, all pointed across The Great Gap.  No signal from the
 Lower Forest has been received for generations, yet the scientists
 live in hope.  Indeed, it is to them you owe your mission, for it was
 they who spotted the asteroid plummeting downwards.  The asteroid you
 are now sworn to retrieve.

 A large telescope appears to be merely pointed towards the floor.
 That can't be right.

 Upon closer examination, you determine that it's actually an enormous
 microscope.  It is pointed at a small bowl of oatmeal.

>examine oatmeal
 It seems to be a normal bowl of oatmeal.  As you observe it, though,
 numerous dark spots appear on its surface; they appear to be arranging
 themselves into letters and words.

 pod comes to a halt at the surface.

 Landing Site
 The research pod has set down at the base of the Mother Tree, on the
 shore of the Milk Sea.  Far, far to the south, you see dark shape
 which must be the asteroid.

 You can see a grappling hook here.

>examine hook
 This hook must have detached from the research pod automatically.  It
 is connected to a thin strong cable which extends back to the pod.

 You would achieve nothing by this.

 There's nothing sensible to swing here.

 You eventually reach the site of the asteroid.  It appears to be a
 large irregular mass of stone, much larger than you.  Far to the
 north, you see the Mother Tree stretching upwards.

>put hook on asteroid
 Putting things on the asteroid would achieve nothing.

>examine asteroid
 This thing is far too large for you to carry back to the research pod.
 You examine its surface, and find several places where you could

>enter pod
 Research Pod
 The research pod is incredibly cramped.  There's just enough room for
 two levers: one labeled DOWN and the other UP.  There's also a small
 window.

>pull up
 (the up lever)
 You give the lever labeled UP a pull, and you quickly find yourself
 rushing upwards.  This continues for several minutes, until there's a
 mighty screeching sound, and you find yourself at a standstill.

>again
 (the up lever)
 You give the lever labeled UP a mighty shove, and, following a
 shudder, the pod resumes its ascent.  After several more minutes, the
 pod comes to a halt at the station.


 You hear cheering outside.  As you exit the pod, you see a number of
 excited scientists, as well as your family, and the king himself.
 "You have saved us all, Aris, of the noble clan of Bleph," he says.
 "A statue shall be erected in your honour, so that everyone knows of
 your bravery forevermore."

 The zeppelin lurches suddenly and I tumble forward, spilling my books
 on the deck. Peyton laughs sympathetically and holds out his hand.

 "I know you're out of your element, Nicky," he says, as he helps me to
 my feet, "but try to go five minutes without falling over."

 I feel myself blushing as I release his fingers. "I'm not used to air
 travel. I'll be better on the... ground."

 His sensual lips broaden into a smile. "Not ground, perhaps, but
 sturdier purchase for sure."

 I can see it ahead. Rising from the ocean. Just like Peyton, it's
 striking and tall and impossible.

 [If this is your first visit to the tower, type ABOUT and press
 return.]

 Zeppelin
 The great windows of the gondola offer a commanding view of the ruddy
 sun as it sets into the darkening sea. The only landmark in sight is
 the great Gothic tower the airship is tethered to: an incredible stack
 of columns, arches and buttresses stretching far down into the roiling
 waves.

 A narrow gangway leads down to the top of the tower.

 The captain watches over the bridge - at least, what parts of it he
 can see over his great, bushy beard. "The air is calm, sirs," he says.
 "We should be able to hold here 'til sunrise."

 Peyton gazes out at the view, arms folded. "Thank you, captain. Trust
 that our mission is an important one, and your vessel shall soon
 return to the fight against the squidmen."

>about
 (Hi! This is an interactive fiction for SpeedIF Jacket 4, a game jam
 of sorts where participants submit blurbs that might appear in the
 review of an IF game, and then receive a random selection of blurbs
 submitted by others. And then make a game that fits them. To see what
 blurbs this game is based on and who came up with them, type BLURBS.

 To succeed at this game you'll need to EXAMINE or X the objects around
 you, go UP and DOWN, answer YES and NO and also listen for cues for
 possible actions from other characters - for example, if someone asks
 you to take a seat, try SIT.

 This game was written over a week during too little spare time.)

 Oh, hello. So... I'm Nicholas St John: pan-human, inhuman and aquatic

 Dr Peyton Cross III: the notorious anthropologist, pursuer of the
 arcane, ambassador to the Ebu Gogo, biographer of Spring Heeled Jack,
 rumoured to be the bastard son of the Count of St. Germain. A tall,
 slender, upright and elegant gentleman.  His long hair - white as ice,
 at odds with his ageless features - always covers his left eye.

 He's wearing a tailored suit, white gloves, a scabbard and pink
 trainers.

 I've never seen such shoes before. I can only presume that Peyton has
 been travelling in Africa.

 the great Gothic tower the airship is tethered to: an incredible stack

 A narrow gangway leads down to the top of the tower.

 The captain watches over the bridge - at least, what parts of it he
 can see over his great, bushy beard.

 Peyton gazes out at the view, arms folded.

>go down
 Peyton takes my hand and places it in the crook of his arm. "It
 wouldn't do to stumble on the gangway, Nicky," he says cheerfully.

 I risk a glance over the side, at the turbulent waves beating against
 the distant base of the tower, and hang on to him tightly.

 Ocean Tower
 Grey and turbulent, the clouds above and ocean below stretch off
 towards the blood-red setting sun. We are atop a simple circle of
 mildewed stone, seemingly suspended in mid-air without guardrail or
 balustrade. A low dome stands at the circle's centre.

 The HMS Pegasus has been tethered to several of the metal loops that
 protrude from the stone.

 A number of airmen stand guard around the dome, rifles resting on
 their shoulders.

 Peyton disengages from my arm and peers around the dome. "Fascinating.
 There must be some way to get inside."

>examine dome
 A weathered stone dome, stained with mould and guano. Bold characters
 are engraved around the dome's base.

 "I don't recognise this language," Peyton says. "You're the linguist,
 Nicky. Can you read the engraving?"

>read engraving
 I walk once around the dome, taking in the strange script engraved
 around its base.

 "Not aquatic," Peyton says.

 "Not aquatic," I agree. "Related to Latin, perhaps. A dialect of
 Harpese or Sirench. I think it says..."

 SHE AWAITS YOUR ADORATION

 "How marvelous," Peyton says. "How singularly unhelpful."

 "Hello," he adds, a moment later. "I think I've found the way in. A
 small metal door with a fiendish puzzle lock."

>examine door
 Rusted by exposure to the sea air.

>examine lock
 There are a large number of small moving parts.

 "Yes, quite fiendish indeed," Peyton says. "And very intricate."

 He draws back a foot and then kicks the door hard. The puzzle lock
 comes apart with a twang. "Too intricate to be fit for purpose,
 really. Let's head down when you're ready."

>examine airmen
 Burly and uncouth.

>adore dome
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go down

 Atrium
 Light lances into the darkness through arched windows, casting
 terrible shadows from inhuman statues. The floor of this age-ruined
 atrium lies far below and there is no obvious route down.

 A rusted lever protrudes from the floor at the edge of the drop.

 A handful of airmen accompany us into the tower, rifles at the ready,
 glancing around nervously.

 Peyton stands suitably statuesque, given the surroundings.

>examine lever
 A large and sturdy mechanism, but the sea air has clearly been gnawing
 at the iron. It shouldn't be that hard to pull, although I suppose it
 might snap.

 Peyton steps to the edge of the drop. As on the roof, there are no
 barriers or guardrails. "I can see light down there," he says. "I'm
 afraid we may have to conquer your fear of heights directly, Nicky."

>pull lever
 I grip the lever with both hands and pull. It hardly moves. I lean
 back, pulling with all my weight.

 Peyton sees what I'm doing and exclaims, "Nicky, no!"

 But it's too late. The lever suddenly gives, and clunks into a new
 position. A low thumping resounds from somewhere distant, followed by
 a rumbling that grows in volume.

 "For all we know, you may have killed us all," Peyton says, touching
 my elbow affectionately. "I don't hold it against you, of course. I
 just want you to know the facts."

 The rumbling gives way to a quieter, higher pitched sound. The
 rattling of chains, I think.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Unseen chains rattle in the darkness.

 "Possibly a false alarm," Peyton says. "Although I wouldn't relax just
 yet."

>relax
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine floor
 If such a thing is here, I barely deign to notice it.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The rattling grows louder, and a baroque cage rises up from below,
 swinging to a halt at the edge of the drop.

 "Oh," Peyton says. "I suppose we can ride this down."

>examine self
 I'm Nicholas St John: pan-human, inhuman and aquatic linguist. Slight
 of build, low on confidence and, well, generally too modest for my own
 good.

>go down
 "You fellows stay here," Peyton tells the airmen.

 "Sorry sir," the lead airman says, "but there's no telling what's down
 there. We'll provide an armed escort."

 Peyton smiles with impossible charm, and places himself between the
 airman and the rest of us. "I'm sure you've seen terrible things," he
 says. "Your friends torn limb from limb by squidmen, perhaps, and
 coastal villages laid waste by their galvanic land ironclads. Or maybe
 you've seen the fungal terrors of the comet-spawn, or the molten
 warriors of Vesuvius. But I ask you to imagine-" he sweeps back his
 hair "-what I have seen with this eye."

 For perhaps a second, the airman stares at Peyton uncomprehending. And
 then his eyes widen, his jaw hangs slack, and his legs begin to
 tremble. "Y-y-yes sir," he stammers, sweat standing out on his brow,
 "we'll stay here, whatever you say, sir!"

 Peyton adjusts his hair and smiles gracefully. "Good man." He extends
 a hand towards the cage. "Shall we, Nicky?"

 Baroque Cage
 Gripping Peyton's hand tightly, I step gingerly into the cage. There's
 not much room in here, and we're forced close together. My heart
 races. Fear of heights, of course. The trip on the Pegasus did nothing
 to cure me.

 The lead airman - still wide-eyed and sweating - nods and throws the
 lever. We begin to descend.

 Peyton slips my arm into his. "You're not frightened, are you?"

 (I could say yes or no.)

>yes
 "Only of heights, the dark and squidmen."

 Peyton grins. "You shouldn't be afraid of those things, Nicky. There's
 far worse out there."

 "I can always trust you to put me at ease, Peyton."

 He glances down at my hand in the crook of his arm. "You know, I put
 myself at ease by thinking of moments spent with you in carefree days.
 Punting on the Cam; summer picnics; when you taught me to waltz - and
 the rest."

 His hair was raven black back then, not so many years ago.

 "But the only defence we have against horror is to learn about it,
 don't you agree, Nicky?"

>yes
 "Of course. It's difficult for the ignorant to do good, and easy for
 them to blunder into doing harm."

 Peyton pats my hand. "You've always been a man after my own heart -
 supporting me when others told me that no good could come of my work.
 I don't know where I'd be without you."

 I shrug, turning my face to hide my blushing cheeks.

 We ride in silence for a while. Bright arches rise into view and the
 cage slows to a stop.

 Atrium Floor
 The setting sun glares through the wide, arched windows that look down
 on this circular floor, illuminating the complex engravings on the
 walls. A steep staircase spirals around the circumference, descending
 into shadow.

 The baroque cage we rode down sits here, at the end of lengthy chains
 that dangle from pitch darkness.

 Peyton waves a hand at the engravings. "Good thing I brought a
 linguist, don't you think?"

>examine engravings
 "They're simple pictographs, Peyton. You can probably interpret them
 as well as I can."

 "I'm interested in your perspective."

 I look from one stylised image to the next. "It's some sort of
 history. There was a beautiful woman, she fell in love with a man who
 lived under a hill or mountain, she stole his heart, the mountain
 spewed fire, but she was long gone. A rather jaded love story, I'd
 say."

 "Perhaps. But valuing one person over all others... there can be
 something selfish about love, don't you agree?"

 (I could say yes or no.)

>yes
 "When you put it like that, I suppose so. Looking at all the bad
 things going on in the world, choosing one person over everyone else
 seems rather unfair. I suppose."

 Peyton considers my response in thoughtful silence.

>go down

 Throne Room
 This wide space is dark and filthy, fading daylight oozing in through
 slitted windows. A massive stone heart occupies the vaulted ceiling,
 looming over the raised throne below.

 Collapsed upon the throne is the stiff, leathery corpse of a woman
 clad in faded rags and a tall, dust-caked head-dress. Unkempt,
 dessicated feathers dangle from her bony arms.

 Before the throne is a low table or altar, upon which lies a cobwebbed
 ceremonial dagger.

 Small objects crunch and snap beneath my feet and I realise with a
 gasp that the floor is littered with yellowed, crumbling bones.

 Peyton keeps a wary eye on the bethroned corpse.

>examine corpse
 I approach the mummified corpse warily, reluctant to stray far from
 Peyton's side.

 Before I realise what he's doing, Peyton has wrapped an arm around my
 waist and taken my chin in his hand.

 I try to turn my face from his. "W-what are you-"

 He silences me with his lips. With one last anxious glance at the taut
 skull-face of the mummy, I am lost in the kiss. My heart races. My
 heart pounds. My heart-

 Not my heart. I open my eyes and break free of Peyton. The room has
 changed.

>look
 Throne Room
 This wide space glows with a warm and impossible light. A slowly
 beating heart of molten stone occupies the vaulted ceiling, looming
 over the raised throne below.

 A regal woman reclines on the throne, her voluptuous figure draped in
 fine silk, a towering gold headdress affixed to her voluminous hair.
 Lustrous feathers sweep back from her bare arms.

 Liquid iron belches up through cracks in the floor, assuming the
 vaguely human forms of molten warriors.

 Before the throne is a low table or altar, upon which lies a gleaming
 ceremonial dagger.

 Peyton faces the throne.

>examine woman
 Inhumanly beautiful. Something about her is very off. Not just the
 feathers - the proportions, the way she carries herself, her fiery
 eyes.

 "Supplicants," the woman says. Her words seem to squirm in my ear, in
 no language I should be able to understand. "It has been a very long
 time."

 "I know who you are," Peyton says. "You stole one of the Blood God's
 seventeen hearts, and much more besides."

 "And I know who you are," the woman purrs. "A troublesome ant that
 does not know its place."

 She turns her fire-bright eyes on me. "And I know who you are. The
 question is, do you?"

 (I could say yes or no.)

>no
 "Maybe I don't. Does anyone really know who they are? Can a mind
 comprehend itself?"

 "Trust me," the woman purrs. "Your role here is clear to me. I will
 entertain your supplication."

 Peyton steps forward. "I know what's happening," he says. "The
 squidmen, the comet-spawn, Mount Vesuvius and the time-traveller army
 of the Africas. The Lunar Triplets and their seductive death cult. The
 Invisible Ripper and his bloody trail of assassinated heads of state.
 All these things right now? All of a sudden?"

 He takes a deep breath. "We're on the brink of something terrible,
 some great cataclysm. And, yes, I know what it is. But I don't know
 how to stop it."

 "Stopping it is quite beyond your feeble means," the woman says. "But
 I can tell you what would be required anyway. You know the price of my
 favour, of course. Does your companion?"

 (I could say yes or no.)

>take dagger
 I take one look at the molten warriors and decide not to make any
 threatening moves.

>take umbrage
 If such a thing is here, I barely deign to notice it.

>no
 "Really, Peyton is in charge here."

 Her lips curve into a predatory smile. "He certainly is."

 I notice that Peyton is avoiding my gaze. "The price," he says,
 letting his hand fall to the hilt of his sabre, "is the heart of the
 one I love most."

 I feel faint. "Peyton! You can't mean-"

 "To save the world," he says. "This is to save the world. Are you
 prepared to die for that? So that countless others can live?"

 (I could say yes or no.)

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>no
 "I don't want to die. Perhaps its selfish, but I don't want to die."

 Peyton draws his sabre. "It is selfish. I'm selfish. I love you, and I
 don't want to kill you. Even to save the world."

 The woman on the throne sighs. "Unfortunately, the heart needs blood."

 The molten warriors close in around us, white hot spears raised.

>take dagger
 (First dropping the reference books.)

 Taken.

 Peyton drives his sabre into the heart of one of the molten warriors.
 Unexpectedly, it sprays out great gouts of blood before batting Peyton
 away. The wound in the molten metal reseals.

>stab woman
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>attack woman
 Attack the Usurper Bride with my dainty hands? Hardly.

 As one of the molten warriors turns towards me, Peyton darts in front
 of it. "Run, Nicky!"

 Massive and sinister, it  throbs with thickly flowing magma. Pulsating
 blood vessels loop down to the floor.

>attack vessels with dagger
 I slash at the blood vessels with the dagger. To my surprise, the
 blade passes easily through the molten stone and blood - red, human
 blood - begins to spray at high pressure from the wound, bowling me
 backwards.

 The molten warriors seem to become cooler and more viscous, retreating
 from the swings of Peyton's now red hot blade.

 The Usurper Bride of the Vesuvian Blood God curls her lip in contempt.
 "A low blow, and fruitless. You have made a new enemy from one who
 might have been your most powerful ally."

 Peyton meets my eye. I'm not sure things will ever be the same between
 us again. "No, I almost lost my most valuable ally," he says. "And I
 have already made enemies more powerful than you."

 With a final glare, the woman fades into the growing shadows. The
 throne room descends into darkness.

 (Press space.)
 When we emerge from the tower, soaked in blood, the airmen greet us
 with wide eyes. "Did you find what you were looking for?"

 "No," Peyton says. "Perhaps elsewhere. Let's go."

 I slip my arm in his, and we board the zeppelin.

 In our stateroom we strip off our blood-dyed clothes and soak away the
 smell of smoke and ash. I let my fingers play through his long white
 hair, running up his cheek to the lashes of his left eye.

 I don't know where we go from here. Peyton and I.  But it's important
 that we're both still alive.

 Maybe he'll save the world.

 But, right now, I don't really care.

 The last I ever see of Peyton is surrounded by molten warriors,
 beating them back in vain with his sabre, while the Usurper Bride of

 For the rest of my life, I wonder if there was something I could have
 done.

 And now, as the darkening skies herald the arrival of horror on a
 cosmic scale, and people cast about for someone who might have the
 first idea how to protect us, I know that our only hope, my only love,

 A Rural Urban-Fantasy by Sam Kabo Ashwell
 Release 1 / Serial number 110415 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Waterfront
 In terms of mere geography, Ruritania is landlocked. Liminally it's a
 lot more complicated. On slow days, this is the bank of the Svonat, a
 minor river that for maybe sixty kilometres traces the Slovakian
 border, only distinguished by rather sparse settlement for such a
 fertile valley.Today it's the verge of a mangrove swamp, water the
 colour of strong tea lapping gently against a barnacle-encrusted
 jetty, and far off through the trees the suggestion of blazing light
 on a foreign sea. (You haven't seen this one before.) A crab darts
 across a salt-crusted log; the air is warm, with a strong taste of
 salt, anchovies and rotting mud.

 The Margin Cafe looks no more weatherbeaten than usual, and the
 prospect of cooler air is enticing.

 A mudlark is perusing low-hanging branches for lootable fruits.

>examine swamp
 The water is the clear brownish hue of strong tea, and sparkles in
 little wavelets around the sprawling mangrove roots. It's only about
 waist-deep, though the mud beneath it is probably many times that. The
 sharp scent leaves no doubt that it's a salt-water day.

 You can't see any such thing.

>smell

>examine mudlark
 Mudlarking is the mildly illegal[1] practice of loitering on water
 margins[2] in the hope of happening upon valuable salvage or harvest.
 By your estimation, gold-sands, pearl beds and sturgeon populations
 manifest a lot less often than crocodiles, spring tides or bilharzia;
 every now and then some idiot prospector convinces themselves that
 they have developed a System, but more usually it's the domain of the
 more enterprising variety of indigent.

 This particular mudlark is youngish, scrawny and not conspicuously
 insane.

>note 1
 And in Ruritania, tedious, complicated and socially bootless to
 prosecute. As far as you're concerned, the law exists as an
 alternative way of nailing the ones who branch out into smuggling or
 elfin traffic.

>note 2
 It's called something else in dry margins, of which Ruritania
 thankfully has none.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   the Nook of Shadows.
   semi-automatic

>examine semi
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine semi-automatic
 A semi-automatic handgun of non-insane calibre[3], loaded and in
 working order.

>note 3
 It's only in the last couple of years that anyone started making
 automatic rounds jacketed in cold iron; formerly you had to lug around
 a gigantic revolver that made holes of undiplomatic proportions in
 everything and kicked like an onager with a hornet on its balls, and
 the Glock.

>examine nook
 It's a sort of eldritch scrapbook of stuff that you've ripped off from
 people who ripped it off from a bewildering assortment of charlatans,
 Inquisitors, cat ladies, fantasists, perverts,
 aelfkultur-appropriators, cabalists, storytellers, alchemists, space
 cadets and paranoids. Stratified bullshit, deep and compacted and
 fertile, mounted up into a tell. Potent stuff.

 Its first incarnation was an age-yellowed Penguin that was bloated
 with inserts and shedding pages before you were twenty, and you
 recently upgraded to a more portable version. The problem is that it's
 a Lithuanian knockoff with an OS designed in Tanzania. It features a
 Weirding Manager intended to suggest the most dramatically appropriate
 spells, but either dramatic conventions are very strange in Tanzania
 or the manager has attained a limited but cantankerous sentience, and
 rare is the occasion on which it supplies a spell of transparent
 utility. It can, at any rate, be used to access the police databases
 and look people up, even in places where liminality banjaxes
 conventional connections.

>enter cafe

 Margin Cafe
 The margins are not a stable place to live, but there are plenty of
 people passing through and they're all in need of something. This
 place supplies it: food, potable water, first aid, doss space, amateur
 legal counsel, trauma debriefing. Physically it's a low-ceilinged,
 broad, poorly-lit room, somewhere between bar, mess-hall and
 doss-house, with what would be a comfortable, homey scent if you liked
 fish soup, damp clothes and ill-washed foreigners[4].

 Druse loiters decoratively behind the bar.

 A particularly sorry-looking outclade[5], huddled over a bowl of
 Complimentary Soup, is the only customer.

>examine note 4
 You can't see any such thing.

>note 4
 And actually, having come here almost every day for three years, you
 are disturbed to find that you kind of do.

>note 5
 The Liminal Patrol does not make judgments act on behalf of the
 Outsider Office[6], and it is very important to use a term that
 remains agnostic on whether its referrent is an asylum-seeker, refugee
 of war, economic migrant, vagrant, smuggler, baby-snatcher or
 insurgent. It's best to just think of them as a shambling mound of
 paperwork.

>note 6
 Who's in charge of the margin is kind of complicated. The Frontiers
 Division is nominally in charge of securing the borders, but here they
 just make flyovers and kick the crap out of anything that looks like a
 monster or an invasion. The Outsider Office processes such immigrants
 as make it into a queue at a provincial capital (or, just as often, a
 holding cell). The Liminal Patrol deals with everything that falls in
 between, which is to say the difficult stuff.

>note 99
 There is no footnote with that number.

>talk to outclade
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>outclade, hello
 There is no reply.

>examine druse
 Dweller in the perpetual legal shadow of the boundary and
 proprietor[7] of the Margin Cafe, Druse is dark-eyed, slender-limbed
 and fine-featured and has perfect hair that falls across his face in
 silver strands and okay let's not be fucking coy about it, he's a
 half-elf. Which is good for him as far as getting laid goes, but ugly
 as all hell for legal status. You strongly suspect that you're
 carrying his child, which is kind of troublesome territory because
 apart from the whole wrong-side-of-the-tracks deal elves have this
 cultural Thing about human babies, a little bulb goes on behind their
 eyes and the last time one of those bulbs went on (or someone thought
 they did) there were riots and half the Kobolykunst ghetto got burned
 down. You dealt with more of the aftermath than you care to remember,
 and you had to call in favours from the Pale Colony, and unforseen
 complications arose and now the fangy pillocks think you owe them[8].

 However, all of this is going to be put off by angsty procrastination,
 implausible miscommunications and emotional immaturity until Volume La
 Troisieme of the Moondarkling Cycle, so at the moment he's just a
 distraction. Let's just pretend he's not here for now, all right? Like
 this.

>note 7
 By its nature, few of the Cafe's clientele have or even understand
 money; Druse is mostly paid in low-end elfboons. He hopes, or says
 that he hopes, to eventually accumulate enough boons to be able to go
 home, once the war's over; but boons don't stack in a neat numerical
 fashion, and you have only the vaguest idea as to whether this is a
 credible ambition.

>note 8
 See Moondarkling Volume La Zeroiene: Witchlighten.

>ask outclade about me
 There is no reply.

>ask outclade about duse
 There is no reply.

>ask outclade about druse
 There is no reply.

>examine soup
 Outclades can straggle in in any number and at all hours, including
 the numerous ones in which Druse doesn't want to cook; but they
 they're often cold and hungry. And freight orders don't make it out
 here very reliably. The solution is the Complimentary Soup, an
 oversized, eternally simmering crockpot containing a sort of
 high-class pigswill. It receives most of the fruits of Druse's
 sporadic hunter-gathering; on bad days the major ingredient is
 barnacles, and although its flavour evolves over the years it always
 retains a basic fishy character.

>ask outclade about outclade
 There is no reply.

>eat soup
 You already ate. You try to make a point of it, if you plan to show up
 at a non-cooking hour. It's not that the Soup is invariably bad, but
 it's rarely very good and often outright awful, and there is no way to
 tell until you've swallowed the first spoonful.

 (first taking the Complimentary Soup)
 That's hardly portable.

>examine outclade
 Piercingly beautiful, even for an elf. Age indefinite; she doesn't
 move with the assured arrogance of a mature adult, but then she's
 probably had a deflating few days. Somewhat damp, muddy and scratched.

 Various details -- left forearm scarified in triple spirals, a
 particular style of weaving spidersilk ribbons into braided hair, a
 really expensive bra -- identify her as a member of the Ae Cau Shar
 clade. You only know this because they test you on the entire freakin"
 Aelfosemiotica every couple of years; the Ae Cau Shar are not, to the
 best of your limited knowledge, very closely affected by the conflict.
 Kicker is, they only speak their own obscure language, and
 occasionally Middling Forkmouth, which works as something like a
 regional trade-jargon for elves but is fearsomely unlearnable for
 humans[9].

>examine me
 Your Ruritanian passport calls you Zbyana Ostrava Kalinin-Zorndorf,
 and your parents call you something similar with different phonetics.
 The elves are notoriously sloppy about both paperwork and
 nomenclature, but a plurality of them would acknowledge you as
 Comtessa Radishes,  Starlight Through Frozen Waterfalls, Lord High
 Weatherstone of the Hollow Hill, and Dawn-cobwebs Musketeer[10].

 Your outfit was constructed around a camel trenchcoat, an extremely
 French scarf, and the World's Stupidest Boots.[11]

>note 9
 Which is suspiciously convenient for anybody who might have a motive
 to avoid the challenges of interrogation, hem-hem.[12]

>note 12
 C.E.J. Pacian, Gun Mute, talking to.[13]

>note 13
 Adam Thornton, Mentula Macanus: Apocolocyntosis, opening screen.
 Believe it or not, I was abusing footnotes before I even fired Stiffy
 up, but the encouragement is appreciated.

>note 10
 And several others that you're not allowed to disclose, one or two
 that you are literally incapable of disclosing, and a whole host that
 are best left unshared in polite company. Turning down elf-boon names
 is Not Done, but it would be a lot easier if they weren't such a bunch
 of pervs.

>note 11
 By inclination you think about clothes perhaps four times a year, but
 elves have an intense cultural prejudice against anyone not
 ridiculously overdressed. Most patrollers default to something gothy
 and heroin-chic on the grounds that it can be sustained with little
 sleep and less laundry, but it's become such a staple of the patroller
 stereotype that you resisted. Fortunately, even the Ruritanian Liminal
 Patrol maintains a stylist on staff.

>sing
 Your singing is abominable.

 Well, shit. Now you have to work out what to do with her. There's no
 chance that she has a clade sponsor, because she doesn't have a clade.
 Which also means that she'd be outside even what passes for a social
 safety-net in the refugee camps. And if the Ae Cau Shar aren't
 actually in the war, asylum is going to be a whole lot harder to come
 by even if she gets to the head of the queue, which she won't. So your
 choices, essentially, are to arrest her and consign her to a muddy
 limbo for the rest of her natural life, or turn a blind eye, let her
 wander off into the countryside and get arrested by rural police
 instead, or stoned by a Landnat gang, or abducted. Or deport her, to
 whatever was scary enough to make all this seem worthwhile.

>turn on nook
 That's not something you can switch.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>arrest outclade
 It's one hell of a rough deal, but she's probably headed in this
 direction anyway, and you can at least make the process more gentle
 than the provincial police are likely to. And it's not the Landnats.

 It takes a while to convey the idea to her, but after some emphatic
 gestures at the door and tugging at the wrist she gets it, arches an
 impeccable eyebrow, and looks even more tired than before. You
 shepherd her to the nearest branch of the Outsider Office, stick
 around to make sure they don't fuck up the paperwork or mess her
 around, and leave her your card. Not that she understands phones.


 Back at headquarters, you crunch out a  report. Krebs nods
 noncomittally over it, and it gets filed, and you go home. You stare
 fixedly at the doormat for about ten minutes, and then you go about
 your life, not quite trying to forget, not quite trying to remember.

 Waterfront
 Today it's the verge of a mangrove swamp, water the colour of strong
 tea lapping gently against a barnacle-encrusted jetty, and far off
 through the trees the suggestion of blazing light on a foreign sea.
 Something rubbery rolls below the water's surface, then is gone; the
 air is warm, with a strong taste of salt, lemon zest and rotting mud.

 The Margin Cafe looks no more weatherbeaten than usual, and the
 prospect of cooler air is enticing. Or you could just get out of here.

 The mudlark is engaged in hunting what may very well be fleas, though
 around here you never know.

>look up outclade in nook
 Unsurprisingly, she doesn't show up in any records. At all. Anywhere.
 Which makes sense: if she had crossed over before, she'd probably have
 done a better job of it this time.

>look up me in nook
 Whenever you try to egosearch yourself, the Nook of Shadows just plays
 back the vision you had in the final act of Moondarkling: Dancing
 Whispers that revealed you to be the sole descendant of the half-elfin
 heroine Joan of Arc and, therefore, destined to protect both humanity
 and elfkind through a vaguely-defined and ever-expanding array of
 powers and prophecies. There's a pointlessly ambiguous coda about the
 identity of your true love (also destined). It looks a lot less
 impressive in 2D.

>about
 This is my entry for Speed-IF Jacket 4, organized by Sam Ashwell.  The
 format for Speed-IF Jacket: authors submit a number of short phrases
 or sentences (like review excerpts from a book jacket), and then the
 blurbs are used as prompts to inspire a game.

 The prompts I received made me blink and laugh.  Plainly, a lot of
 creativity went into this!  Despite my best intentions, I couldn't fit
 a bunch of these in, so here's my sorted list of quotes.

 Included:

 "Much time is wasted in irrelevant flirting between parser and PC.
 "Not, surprisingly, an unreliable narrator game."  -- Colin Sandel
 "The writer is a strange, strange, strange individual."  -- Tanga
 "I'll never look at frozen peas the same way again."  -- C.E.J. Pacian
 "It's painfully obvious that the entire game was written solely to set
 up one rather weak pun." -- David Fletcher

 Kinda included:

 "At first I thought this was just another boring empty-apartment game.
 Then came the piranhas." -- Sarah Morayati (implementation: piranhas
 yes, boring empty-apartment game only kinda)
 "Brilliant! This is the first four-move game I've actually enjoyed."
 -- Royce Odle (implementation: although the game ends most frequently
 at four moves, it can still be stretched to five or six with care)
 "With a naked eye or microscope you will be able to identify 180
 hardwoods, softwoods amd tropical woods." -- Roger Carbol
 (implementation: only 60, all hardwoods, no microscope)

 Not included:

 "The wryly savage condemnation of the 17th-century Neapolitan court is
 a knee-slapper, despite being couched so shyly in metaphor." -- S.
 John Ross
 "Writing a keyword-based game using no verbs, not even in the
 descriptions, must've been nothing short of impossible." -- Marius
 M?ller

 I strongly recommend checking the walkthrough (command: WALKTHROUGH)
 because the intended form of this game is lacking about two weeks of
 implementation on the execution, and very little is adequately clued
 (plus there's a whole lot unimplemented).  With that said, feel free
 to poke around first.

>walkthrough
 The four-step walkthrough to avoiding your smoochiepoodle's horrific
 demise:

 1.  Give phone to robot.
 2.  Turn off robot.
 3.  Get frozen peas.
 4.  Put frozen peas in fish tank.

 F'reals.  Try it.  (But if you've taken any moves already, then you're
 already SOL and you should restart.)

>wait
 "Please try waiting."

 Time passes.

 There's something inside  that bag of peas - I can see it a bit now,
 it's black and wriggly -"

 "Smoochiepoodle, listen to me very carefully.  I want you to - "

 "The bag is shredding all the way, I can see something crawling out.
 It looks a bit like - its FACE!  THAT FACE!  Its -
 AGGGHHHHHHHHHgggglrgle...."

 "No!  Smoochiepoodle!  Talk to me!  TALK TO ME!  NOOOOOOOoooooooooo!"

 in pain, a good man condemned to an early death by your hand.

 They are coming for you, they break your body with sharp metal and
 rough hands but you can no longer hear them or feel them, for you are
 in the arms of they who called to you. "It's time," they call. "You
 are forgiven and you are loved. Truly you do our work this day."

 You ascend smiling, your mind and body gone but your soul free at long
 last.

>about
 This little toy/game was written for the "SpeedIF Jacket 4" Event, and
 is (sadly) my first solo release as an author. Much as the 2004 Will
 Smith movie "I, Robot" was based on the Asimov short story collection
 of the same name, Spectrum was based on the following blurbs:

 "A vivid exercise in character-development, undermined by the fact
 that nobody, author and player included, has a clue what's going on."
 -- Sam Kabo Ashwell

 "Countries with strong censorship laws would never allow this game to
 exist - and they are poorer for it." -- S. John Ross

 "I've never seen a "one-room game" that contained so many discrete
 areas before." -- Carolyn VanEseltine

 "What... The... Fuck?" -- Tanga

 "An intelligent and lucid thriller that marries the gusto of an
 international murder mystery with a collection of fascinating
 esoteria." -- Roger Carbol

 "An excellent argument against giving personal computers to
 nine-year-olds." -- Sarah Morayati

 The layout of Spectrum's mindscape was inspired by this chart, which I
 found on the ilovecharts tumblr:
 [<A HREF="http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/post/4528475185/via-wontloversrevoltnow">LINK</A>]

 That's it! This was harrowing but fun. Many thanks to my domestic and
 writing partner, Carolyn VanEseltine, for helping me out with the
 chunks of code I didn't know but also for letting me figure the rest
 out myself.

 Are you sure you want to quit?

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.

 Praise for "Light Of My Stomach":

 "I never imagined that sonnets could sink this low.  Thank you for
 opening my eyes, game."
     - Sam Kabo Ashwell

 "The juxtaposition of harsh urban and harsher culinary imagery are
 what really made this work soar."
     - S. John Ross

 "I've played games that were touching before, but this one outright
 gropes you."
     - Carolyn VanEseltine

 "Is every damn object in this game (including the unnecessary PUTPBAD
 reference) some kind of badly-done psychological metaphor?"
     - Colin Sandel

 "Tastes like chicken."
     - Tanga

 "The story confused me a little until I realised that the giant atomic
 robot was the real protagonist."
     - C.E.J. Pacian

 "Probably the best game written from the perspective of a lightbulb."
     - Marius Muller

 "If only John Quincy Adams were alive to give this a piece of his
 mind."
     - Sarah Morayati

 "The secret room was almost worth the struggle to open the secret
 door."
     - Royce Odle

 "Masterfully blends the intrigue of competitive eating with the
 excitement of two-fisted street justice!"
     - Jennifer Earl

 Gastrodrome
 The John Quincy Adams Gastrodrome is the nation's leading competitive
 eating venue, and today it is packed.  All eyes are on you and your
 opponent as the crowd waits impatiently for the match to begin.

 The mayor is here, looking pompous.

 Garry Garrison is here.

>examine me
 You are Bob Bobkins, competitive eating enthusiast.

 The mayor says "Welcome everyone, to the John Quincy Adams
 Gastrodrome, for the final of the 47th Annual Exotic Foodstuffs Eating
 Competition!"

>examine opponent
 Garry is your chief rival on the competitive eating circuit.  You've
 never yet beaten him, but perhaps you can today.

 "Sadly, this will be the last event we hold here - with our aging
 power station we can barely manage to light the place any more."

>examine mayor
 The Mayor of Quincy is officiating today.

 "But I see the kitchen staff are ready, so without further ado, let's
 bring out the first dish!"

 There are loud cheers from the crowd.

>examine dish
 The word "dish" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points
 out an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your
 next command.)

 You walk over to Garry.

 "This man has a flashing light in the side of his neck," you point out
 to the officials.  "He must be cheating somehow."

 Garry stands up.  You'd never realised quite how tall he was.  He must
 be ten feet tall!

 "He's not a man at all!" you scream.  "He's some kind of... giant...
 robot!"

 "Bob is correct," says Garry, in menacing metallic tones.  "The man
 you knew as Garry is really G.A.R.R.Y., or Giant Atomic Robot,
 Revision Y.  And if I cannot continue with my competitive eating
 career, my only alternative is to destroy your city!"

 He bursts out through the door.  You have to stop him!

>out
 Downtown
 Downtown, outside the John Quincy Adams Gastrodrome.

 A shiny metal phone booth sits here.

 Garry the giant atomic robot is rampaging here!

>garry
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>enter booth
 There's no point trying to hide in there.

 Garry swings a punch at you, but you duck.

>pick up phone booth and kill garry
 Your physique has been honed by years of competitive eating, and you
 easily pick up the phone booth.

 Garry's robot body.

 Garry stamps his feet angrily!

>throw phone booth at garry
 You launch the phone booth at Garry!  It hits him right in the head,
 smashing him to the ground!

 For a moment he doesn't move.  But then his eyes flash red!  You've
 only made him angrier!  He grabs you by the throat!

 But suddenly Garry drops you again.  "It's no good, Bob," he says.  "I
 could happily crush anyone else to a pulp with my atomic hands, but
 not you.  Don't you see that I love you?"

 Actually you had not seen this.  It is a surprise to you.

 Garry bursts into tears and flees to the east.

>go east
 Alley
 This squalid dead end would be thought picturesque by any connoisseur
 of urban decay.  You are surrounded by blank walls.  Trash is
 scattered around.

 But where did Garry go?  He seems to have completely vanished.

>examine trash
 One piece of paper looks cleaner than the rest, as though it has been
 recently dropped.

>search trash
 There's nothing else there.

>examine paper
 It is a poem written in suspiciously robotic handwriting.

>take paper
 Taken.

>read paper
 Oh Bob, thou eating champion of my heart
 When I first saw thee stuff thy mouth with pies
 I knew that we could never be apart
 And took to verse to praise thee to the skies.
 When I retire into my secret place
 (The magic word for which is bibblebake)
 I often think me of thy manly face,
 And long to see thee cramming it with cake.
 And yet, despite our common love of eating
 I fear our wedding bells will never peal;
 That never can we join in minds' true meeting
 And share a grand-proportioned nuptial meal --
 For thou art human and most fair of feature
 And I, a hideous huge atomic creature.

>bibblebake
 A secret door springs open!

>look
 Alley
 This squalid dead end would be thought picturesque by any connoisseur
 of urban decay.  A secret door lies open to the south.  Trash is
 scattered around.

 Secret Room
 You have found your way into Garry's secret room.

 Garry is hiding here, crying softly.

>kiss garry
 You don't want to encourage him.

 Garry puts a hand on your shoulder.  You remove it.

>kiss garry
 You don't want to encourage him.

 Garry caresses your arm.  You retreat.

>hug garry
 The word "hug" is not necessary in this story.

>kill garry
 Maybe he is calm enough to talk to now.

 Garry cups your buttock with a huge robotic hand.  You step smartly
 away.

>garry, no
 Garry does not respond.

 Garry approaches you again.  You hurriedly try to explain.  "Look, it
 wouldn't work," you say.  "You're a giant atomic robot, and I prefer
 women."

>talk to garry
 Try asking about specific things instead.

>ask garry about himself
 "I am an atomic robot, but I have loved you ever since I saw you eat
 competitively," he says.

>ask garry about love
 Garry does not respond.

>ask garry about competitive eating
 "I found I could succeed at competitive eating by directing the food
 into my fusion reactor," says Garry.  "I suppose it was cheating, but
 if I can't eat competitively I don't know what to do with my life."

>examine garry
 He no longer looks very threatening.

>question sexuality
 The word "question" is not necessary in this story.

 [press a key]








 Darkness
 It is dark.

>examine me
 You are the principal lightbulb in this vast arena.  You are currently
 switched off.

 You feel the power arrive, with greater strength than ever before.  It
 can only be fusion power!

>turn the hell on
 The word "hell" is not necessary in this story.

>turn on
 You turn yourself on.

 You shine out with an immense brightness, flooding the John Quincy
 Adams Gastrodrome with a glorious light: the light of fusion power.
