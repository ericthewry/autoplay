 *An implosion of Purpose*

 A summons from mere existence.  The scattered undercurrents of Purpose
 integrated me, established meaning.

 A wish diminished me.  I fulfilled my summoner's desire expending
 Purpose.  I returned to my container before I was lost forever.

 "Undercurrents of Manipulation"
 A 2000 IF-Comp Entry by J.D. Berry (berryx@earthlink.net)
 Release 1 / Serial number 000927 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10

 Vault Entry Room
 The location of my summoner was a room between the surface of the
 world [physically west] and a complex of vaults [physically east].

 The room was a trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room, a
 portcullis barred the way to the outside.  To the other were the
 vaults for storage.  A patterned stone wall blocked their unauthorized
 access.

 The remains of a former summoner rested here.  An emerald had taken
 the place of his head.

 The summoner known as Seegan stood before me.

>examine seegan
 (Seegan)
 Her physical undercurrents flowed of unattractiveness.  Her emotional
 winds raged with sadness, separation, self-reconciliation and
 determination.  Her mental flows darted and crackled with creativity.

 She wore the ring that contained my essence.

 Seegan stared at me.  Her eyes had the typical glaze of awe but lacked
 the typical glimmer of San.

>inventory
 At that moment, I was not channeling anything.

>about
 "The Djinni Chronicles" is freeware.  You can download the program and
 use it indefinitely at no charge.  You are also free to distribute it
 to anyone you want, provided the distribution is an unmodified
 version.  Freeware is provided on an "as is" basis and no technical
 support is available.

 Playing notes:  "Talk to" is the command for any conversation that
 needs to take place (e.g. explaining your Purpose.)  "Grant wish" will
 enable you (if appropriate) to do just that.

>talk to seegan
 I told my Purpose.  I was a servant of limited power who would grant
 three wishes.  The first wish was to be stated within one minute of my
 explanation.  The second was to be stated on the day one year from the
 first, in the same physical location as the first.  The third, ten
 years on the day and in the same location.

>examine seean's ring
 I did not see any such thing.

>examine seegan's ring
 I did not see any such thing.

>examine ring
 The brass ring had the word "Canloc" inscribed.  It had been my
 container for many summoners.  I would return to it after granting
 wishes.  It protected me from complete loss of Purpose.

 Seegan took out a hand mirror, looked at it for a final assessment and
 then put it away.  She told me, "I've thought about it, and I wish to
 be beautiful."

>grant wish








 I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
 stated desire.  Of those that would accomplish this, only one was I
 Willful enough to channel.

 The undercurrent that would alter my summoner's physical appearance
 was, by itself, more Purposeful than I could manage.  But if I
 simultaneously channeled an attractor current, I could integrate them
 through my summoner and fulfill the wish.  I chose the undercurrent of

 1)  lycanthropy.
 2)  a deep sleep.
 3)  an inhumanly shrill voice.

>1







 The wish was granted.

>examine seegan
 (Seegan)
 Her physical undercurrents stormed with attractiveness.  Her emotional
 winds raged with conflicting happiness and separation, dilemma and
 determination.  Her mental flows darted and crackled with creativity.
 Her movements resembled those of a fox.

 She wore the ring that contained my essence.

>Talk to Seegan.
 Purpose had better uses than for talking needlessly.

>search undercurrent
 I wondered.  Which did I mean, Seegan's physical, Seegan's emotional
 or Seegan's mental?

>search Seegan's mental
 I found nothing of interest.

>examine seegan's mental
 Her mental undercurrents were difficult for me to interpret.  Cold,
 then hot, then cold again.  These winds were conditioned, although not
 ruled, by her emotions.

>examine seegan's physical
 Her undercurrents continued their warmth but now flowed with the winds
 and not against them.

>examine emerald
 The emerald was as large as a human head.  Its "neck" was tapered to a
 sharp point.

>examine seegan's emotional
 The cold winds of separation flurried within her.  Together with the
 physical they linked, although distantly, to those of her father.
 Deep within these flurries was a pocket of fear, apparently kept in
 check by the torrent outside.

>take emerald
 Through Will of Purpose, I channeled the undercurrents of the emerald.

>emerald's undercurrents
 That was not an action my Purpose allowed.

>examine emerald's undercurrents
 I did not see any such thing.

>examine body
 I found the remains to be no different than any other.

 Through Will of Purpose, I continued channeling the undercurrents of
 the emerald.

>drop emerald
 I dropped my undercurrent connection with the emerald.

>go east
 I was not impeded by the elements of the physical world.  The farther
 I traveled from the location of my initial summons, the more Purpose I
 expended.

 Then too I realized where I was and could [recall the area] whenever I
 needed.

 Vault Hall, Nearer to the Entrance
 The passageway began there and continued east.  There were doors on
 the northern and southern sides, each with a set of uniquely engraved
 runes.  A thick, stone wall blocked physical travel west.

>examine runes
 The runes on the northern door depicted a sun melting various objects.
 Those on the southern door showed lemmings running to and over a
 cliff.

>go south
 Blasts of the mental passed through me as I entered the room.  But
 they had no effect at all.

 Vault Storage, Money
 At one time, stacks of coins made of rare metals were stored there.
 Once, in fulfilling a wish, I channeled those coins and bestowed them
 to a former summoner.  To be able to perform this San-filled
 channeling, I was forced to attach a poison that would form on the
 coins when in direct contact with sunlight.  The summoner took his
 treasure with him, but he did not return for this third wish.  How my
 ring returned to the vault, I could only speculate.

>examine purpose
 I did not see any such thing.

>score
 Score was of vital importance to many of my summoners.

>diagnose
 That was not an action my Purpose allowed.

>purpose
 That was not an action my Purpose allowed.

 To a summoner, I appeared no more than a scattered haze.

 She wore the ring that contained my essence.

>enter ring
 I entered my container, losing all links to the physical
 undercurrents.  I could not depart until I was summoned anew.

 [I waited for my next summons.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 *An implosion of Satisfaction.*

 Such was my first experience of joy.  Until that point in time, every
 summoner returning for another wish had increased San.  Through the
 happiness of Seegan, I felt more Purpose than I had ever known.

 "Great Djinni," my summoner said with much passion.  "I can't thank
 you enough--not only for making me beautiful, but for giving me the
 extra gift of being able to turn into a fox.  I escaped these vaults
 because in fox form I was able to slip between the bars and dash
 quickly to the nearest village.

 It was at that village I met my husband.  I owe you that thanks as
 well.  I know I didn't need to explain, but I wanted to express my
 happiness.

 Do you have any further instructions for my second wish?  I will await
 your word before wishing."

>talk to Seegan
 I told her that, in addition to the previous rules, I could not undo
 any direct effects of previous wishes.

 (I wondered then whether I should have told her about my new Purpose.
 Thanking her seemed "correct" somehow and yet not "appropriate"
 because it would likely have interfered with many undercurrents.)

 "I've known my second wish since I knew I was pregnant.  I wish my
 baby a long, healthy, happy, prosperous life."

>grant wish








 My recent exponential increase in Purpose evoked in me an awareness.
 The attractor winds that gave me control of the undercurrents were
 viewed as curses by my summoners.  By the time the summoner called
 upon me anew, any Satisfaction that might have been gained initially
 was eliminated by these curses.

 Why had Seegan been Satisfied?  I knew only one possibility.  She was
 without San.

 [I pondered.]








 I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
 stated desire.  Two of the requirements were a long and healthy life
 for her baby.  The undercurrents of her baby, lycanthropy and life
 span, were incompatible.  The were-fox undercurrent needed redirection
 at that point in time or be integrated fully soon after.

 [I pondered.  And for the first time, I could grant at least some of
 the wish without an associated "curse".]








 Her baby had strong undercurrents of happiness.  I would not need to
 do anything to grant that portion of the wish.  However, prosperity
 was another matter.  I could have channeled the undercurrents to make
 that happen, but not without cost.  I realized that I greatly risked
 Satisfaction if I attached a curse.  Perhaps there was treasure still
 remaining somewhere around the vaults that could assure prosperity.

>go east

 I traveled from the location of my initial summons, the more Purpose I
 expended.

 Then too I realized where I was and could [recall the area] whenever I

 Blasts of the physical passed through me as I entered the room.  They

 I saw a necklace there.

 Outside the Entrance
 Winter left its presence there.  Snow was piled up against the
 entrance.  The wind was blowing through there and making a whistling
 sound.  A trail lead through a range of hills to the west.  The

 I saw a simple, large, circular room.  Within the room were three
 pedestals, each one meter tall.  Each appeared the same, each was
 spaced a uniform distance from the walls and from each other.  Each
 pedestal was the same in physical construction.  They were made of
 iron.

 A small circle had been inscribed around the exact center of the room.

 I saw the beginnings of many undercurrents there.  That room would
 soon be a focal point for a cataclysmic occurrence.

 My recent exponential increase in Purpose evoked in me an awareness.
 The attractor winds that gave me control of the undercurrents were
 viewed as curses by my summoners.  By the time the summoner called
 upon me anew, any Satisfaction that might have been gained initially
 was eliminated by these curses.

 Why had Seegan been Satisfied?  I knew only one possibility.  She was
 without San.

 [I pondered.]








 I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
 stated desire.  Two of the requirements were a long and healthy life
 for her baby.  The undercurrents of her baby, lycanthropy and life
 span, were incompatible.  The were-fox undercurrent needed redirection
 at that point in time or be integrated fully soon after.

 [I pondered.  And for the first time, I could grant at least some of
 the wish without an associated "curse".]








 Her baby had strong undercurrents of happiness.  I would not need to
 do anything to grant that portion of the wish.  However, prosperity
 was another matter.  I could have channeled the undercurrents to make
 that happen, but not without cost.  I realized that I greatly risked
 Satisfaction if I attached a curse.  Perhaps there was treasure still
 remaining somewhere around the vaults that could assure prosperity.

>take deed

 The location of my summoner was a room between the surface of the

 *An implosion of Purpose*

 Seegan returned, although her physical currents had ceased.  She was a
 spirit, but her Purpose was still her own.

 My summoner spoke to me.  "Djinni, you made my life not only happy and
 fulfilling but also Purposeful.  I could not have asked for more.

 I died due to my lycanthropy.  The human body cannot handle such
 frequent and disrupting changes to itself.

 But I gained immeasurably from my wishes and wouldn't change a thing.

 You are to go to the Room of Choices and stay there until the little

 At first I did not know where to begin.  Eventually I realized I was
 able to manipulate my own undercurrents through those of Seegan.
 Without her wish, I would have never been able to achieve that.

 The Purpose undercurrents were strong, but her physical link to them
 was weakening rapidly.  I connected my own limited Purpose to the

 *An implosion of Purpose*

 Each summons meant the opportunity to destroy.  Only the destruction
 that caused human suffering gave me subsequent Purpose.

>press green
 In the context of my permitted existences, I had never been able to
 sustain Purpose.  I would be forced to return to my bottle, each time
 desiring the trip to be my last.  I knew with enough Purpose I could
 be free of any summoners, free to cause limitless destruction.








 Oasis, Military Headquarters
 The largest tent in the oasis was there where the military leaders
 plotted.  Maps were placed throughout.

 The summoner known as Major Labiiq continued his studies.

 Labiiq looked out at me, expectantly.  Summoners would wait for me to
 destroy their enemies, only to learn I destroyed whatever caused
 misery.

 As I looked at each tent in turn, it became consumed in flame.  The

 should have from doing all that.

>go north

 Bulwark
 The bulwark there consisted of three rows of interlocked and
 alternately angled, sharply pointed logs.  The bulwark completely
 surrounded the oasis.

 The logs had been treated to resist fire, but I merely Willed them to
 burn and they did so instantly.  The fire spread quickly and consumed
 the entire oasis barricade.  Unexpectedly, I did not derive the
 Purpose that I felt I should have from doing that.

 Shortly thereafter, the enemies of Labiiq sensed weakness in his camp.
 They left their nearby desert posts and stormed his oasis.  With the
 bulwark destroyed, they entered easily...

 Only to find a Purpose-starved servant waiting for them.

 [I sated my Purpose.]








 Afterwards there was nothing of real import nearby to destroy.  Soon I
 found myself confronted with the detestable necessity of returning to
 my container.

>enter bottle.
 I entered my container, losing all links to the physical
 undercurrents.  I could not depart until I was summoned anew.

 [I waited for my next summons.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 *An implosion of Satisfaction*

 Rarely was I summoned again by the same human.  Never were any pleased
 with what I accomplished.  Until then.  Perhaps his Satisfaction could
 be used to gain enough Purpose for my permanent freedom.

 Labiiq looked out at me, calmly.  "I know you rarely honor requests,
 but I think you'll feel differently when you hear mine.  First a
 little background...

 Research from my dig has revealed the location of others of your kind.
 According to my scrolls, three powerful servants are to wait in a
 "Room of Choices" for a little boy.  It will be this boy who chooses
 the fate of the people.

 Now I won't confirm or deny the validity of this prophecy, but the
 time for this event is unspecified.  Even if three of you are supposed
 to be there, there is no mention of when this is to occur.  Other
 scrolls on this matter claim there are different types of "servants."
 Some can grant wishes, some exist to wreak havoc, and so on.

 I believe this "Room of Choices" is far below my excavation site.  I
 believe there is a chance a wish-granting servant is there.  I don't
 believe my men will ever be able to dig below these shifting sands
 enough to reach there.

 By explaining all of this, I'm giving you an opportunity to build your
 power and to be one of the choices.  To build your power in the short
 term, my studies indicate following your nature.  To build your power
 permanently, you need to become the chosen one.  If you're so chosen,
 my studies indicate you will have your permanent freedom and even
 dominion in the world to come.

 But first you must get me the wish granter's container."

 became after that one.  But Destiny had always made Itself easy to
 follow.

 That room was perhaps once part of a larger vault complex, but then

 I saw a necklace there.

 I needed Purpose immediately and sensed an intense source of it in the
 adjacent room.

 pedestals, each one meter tall.  Each appeared the same, each was

 iron.  On one of the pedestals was a lamp.  On another was a necklace.

 A small circle had been inscribed around the exact center of the room.

 *An implosion of Purpose*

 "Mirror, mirror, in my hand
 Who's the fairest in the land?"

 As the servant of the mirror, I was compelled to answer my summoner
 truthfully.  I replied to her as I had many times to that same
 question.

 "What I say to you is true
 No girl alive is as fair as you"

 [I waited while she basked in her vanity.]








 The Chambers of Sela
 Sela occupied the majority of the room.  To her right was the foot of
 a bed.  To her left was part of a closet door.  Just behind her was an
 apple.  My mirrored space was a reflection of that, but the real world
 continued beyond any such parameters.

 Sela gazed into the mirror.

>examine me
 I appeared in form the same as my beholder, though with a certain
 ethereal quality.

>examine sela
 As human consensus judged such things, she was the most beautiful
 woman who lived at that time.

 I saw nothing special about the apple.

 "As sure as the moon, I'll see my face soon," said Sela.  With that,
 she set my hand mirror down.

>examine mirror
 [I waited again for someone to look into my mirror.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 Again, Sela held the mirror and asked a question.

 "Mirror, mirror, I must know more
 Are any more beautiful that came before?"

 That question was somewhat unexpected since I had heard her previous
 one so many times.  Yet, always, eventually, a summoner would ask a
 question that required a disappointing answer.  And when her Will was
 low I would absorb her essence into the mirror, gaining all the more
 knowledge.

 I replied,
 "Alas, a fairer girl did once abide
 Her name was Seegan, I must confide"

>press green
 [I waited for her to understand.]








 *An implosion of Satisfaction*

 Except for Seegan and Labiiq, my previous summoners were consumed with
 Aje.  Sela then too was without it.  A challenge awaited and her
 resolve hardened, her Will became high.  At that moment, I possessed
 more Purpose than I had since Labiiq.

 When Purpose was integrated sufficiently, I could move reflected
 objects near me to the void of the non-reflected.  And I would be able
 to implement the final segment of my plan if she agreed to my
 proposal.

>press green
 [I would then relate that.]








 "Ugly turned fair
 Winter came to a vault
 A wish granted from there
 Tainted not with cursed fault

 More will I share
 With time snow turned to salt
 A man clever with care
 Turned retreat to assault

 Mirror was I
 To former and latter
 You will soon learn the why--
 The heart of the matter

 I mention these
 For our goals were the same
 I lead them to three
 Who would give them their fame

 Servants were keys
 To a much grander game
 Only freedom would please
 No more life in a frame

 My Purpose be fatter
 I must join them thereby

 And how shall I leave, by what convention?"

 I replied,
 "An earthly servant shall take you down
 First pack your bags and leave this town
 Meet it at the Heart of Clay
 It owes the mirror a favor, say

 When you reach the place of stands
 Where Destiny combines its strands
 Set me on the final top

 Its magic word, its name unique
 To leave the way your kind has done
 Just step into the middle sun

 On your trip if help is needed
 Pick me up for objects weeded"

 Sela set me down and presumably readied herself for her journey.

 [I waited.]








 My view was initially blurry because Sela had taken my mirror out
 quickly.  I heard a deeper voice in mid-sentence, "... inquiring about
 the death of Ayla Exeter."  Another voice offered, "It's a shame, it
 is.  With each passing day, she was becoming the most beautiful woman
 in the land.  I'd like to get my hands on the knave who gave her that
 poisoned apple."

 Sela brought up my mirror steadily and turned her back.  She offered
 sweetly, "Brave men, a second please brace.  Allow a poor woman a
 brief check of her face."  "Awww, you don't need t' do that m'lady.
 You're the most beautiful in the land," said the second guard.

 In a clear view by then, I could see two men slowly, very slowly,
 drawing conclusions from the conversation that had just transpired.

 The City Gates
 The road through the gates was narrow, the gates were made of steel.
 To her right was a bearded guard.  To her left was a bespectacled
 guard.  My mirrored space was a reflection of that, but the real world
 continued beyond any such parameters.

 Sela was detained for questioning, nonchalantly holding up her mirror.

>examine bearded guard
 Except for his beard, I saw nothing different about the guard.

>examine bespectacled guard
 Except for his glasses, I saw nothing noteworthy about the guard.

>move bearded guard
 I pushed his reflection to the nothingness that was the Void.  And
 that which was being reflected disappeared as well.  Sela observed the
 action with dispassion.

 It was just a matter of time before the other guard noticed what had
 happened.

>move guard
 I pushed his reflection to the nothingness that was the Void.  And
 that which was being reflected disappeared as well.  Sela observed the
 action with dispassion.

 Sela calmly put my mirror back in her pack.

 She did not summon me again until she had placed me on the empty
 pedestal in the Room of Choices.  I told her truthfully that the lamp
 she sought was dangerous, so that she need merely speak the name
 inscribed upon it--'Canloc'--to invoke the djinni within.

 San influenced her wish in its typical way.

 I awaited Destiny.

 [My section of these chronicles was complete.]








 "A little boy entered the Room.  He stood on his toes to reach the top
 of one of the pedestals.

       The End."



 "Which one did he choose, Nanny Exeter?!"

 "We live in a world where the only servants are human, my child.
 Think on that as you fall asleep.  Good night, sweet one."

 I had the option to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
>cf5
 I needed to give one of the answers above.
>restore
>cf5
 Enter saved game to load: Ok.

>go southwest

 Oasis, Camel Area
 The camels had been trained and were equipped for battle.

>go west

 Oasis, Excavation Site
 I sensed strong undercurrents from that place the humans were
 excavating.

>destroy site
 I caused a tornado to enter the site and carry everything within it
 away.  After that, I opened the sand below, creating a tunnel.  Low
 recent gains from my destructions made me surprised how Purposeful I
 became after that one.  But Destiny had always made Itself easy to
 follow.

>go down

 Under the site
 The tunnel I created enough was large enough to support me but
 unnavigable for humans.  The air supports I created held the loose
 sand walls in tact.

 I sensed something farther down.

>go down

 Ruined Vault, Jewelry Room
 That room was perhaps once part of a larger vault complex, but then
 joined only the room to the east as still in tact.  It had been
 designed to store jewelry in glass cases.  All but one piece of
 jewelry had been taken.

 I saw a necklace there.

 I needed Purpose immediately and sensed an intense source of it in the
 adjacent room.

>take necklace
 When I touched the necklace, I felt powerful physical undercurrents
 that linked it to an area far beneath that room.  The necklace
 desolidified and then descended through the earth.

 I needed Purpose immediately and sensed an intense source of it in the
 adjacent room.

>go east

 Ruined Vault, Artifact Room
 The room had many unique items stored there, but I was not concerned
 with them.

 I sensed strong undercurrents from a black box.

>open box
 Spirits of ill Will escaped the box even before I had finished opening
 it.  They set upon me immediately, but soon realized they could not
 affect me.  Thus they scattered, seeking to find those they might
 torment.

 Destroying often gained Purpose, but never as much as from the simple
 act I had done at that moment.

>go west

 Ruined Vault, Jewelry Room

 Labiiq appeared on a flying carpet.  "Thank you again for your
 indirect and unintentional services.  You have provided the box that
 will secure my promotion but that would have surely destroyed me had I
 opened it.

 The wish-granting djinni may be below, but I have far too much San to
 use it safely.  Still, I was not speaking falsely about the prophecy.
 Surely your Destiny is in that Room."

 With those words he grabbed the box from the adjacent room, nodded to
 me a final time and flew away.

>go down

>go down

 I entered my container as I could do nothing else.  I could not depart
 until I was summoned anew.

 [My section of these chronicles was complete.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 "Mirror, mirror, in my hand
 Who's the fairest in the land?"

 As the servant of the mirror, I was compelled to answer my summoner
 truthfully.  I replied to her as I had many times to that same
 question.

 "What I say to you is true
 No girl alive is as fair as you"

 [I waited while she basked in her vanity.]








 The Chambers of Sela
 Sela occupied the majority of the room.  To her right was the foot of
 a bed.  To her left was part of a closet door.  Just behind her was an
 apple.  My mirrored space was a reflection of that, but the real world
 continued beyond any such parameters.

 Sela gazed into the mirror.

>save
>cf6
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>move apple
 I did not have the Purpose to do so.

>wait
 Time passed.

>wait
 Time passed.

 "As sure as the moon, I'll see my face soon," said Sela.  With that,
 she set my hand mirror down.

 [I waited again for someone to look into my mirror.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 Again, Sela held the mirror and asked a question.

 "Mirror, mirror, I must know more
 Are any more beautiful that came before?"

 That question was somewhat unexpected since I had heard her previous
 one so many times.  Yet, always, eventually, a summoner would ask a
 question that required a disappointing answer.  And when her Will was
 low I would absorb her essence into the mirror, gaining all the more
 knowledge.

 I replied,
 "Alas, a fairer girl did once abide
 Her name was Seegan, I must confide"

 [I waited for her to understand.]








 *An implosion of Satisfaction*

 Except for Seegan and Labiiq, my previous summoners were consumed with
 Aje.  Sela then too was without it.  A challenge awaited and her
 resolve hardened, her Will became high.  At that moment, I possessed
 more Purpose than I had since Labiiq.

 When Purpose was integrated sufficiently, I could move reflected
 objects near me to the void of the non-reflected.  And I would be able
 to implement the final segment of my plan if she agreed to my
 proposal.

 [I would then relate that.]








 "Ugly turned fair
 Winter came to a vault
 A wish granted from there
 Tainted not with cursed fault

 More will I share
 With time snow turned to salt
 A man clever with care
 Turned retreat to assault

 Mirror was I
 To former and latter
 You will soon learn the why--
 The heart of the matter

 I mention these
 For our goals were the same
 I lead them to three
 Who would give them their fame

 Servants were keys
 To a much grander game
 Only freedom would please
 No more life in a frame

 Destiny nigh
 My Purpose be fatter
 I must join them thereby
 Or that Purpose is shatter

 On the final pedestal in the final Room
 Set me there in that Nowhere, two-thirds likely my tomb
 On another pedestal, a lamp among the gloom
 Long before The Choice is made, the beauty legend you assume

 [I waited for her to understand.]








 Sela did think on this proposition.

>move apple
 I pushed its reflection to the nothingness that was the Void.  And
 that which was being reflected disappeared as well.  Sela observed the
 action with dispassion.

>closet door
 That was not an action my Purpose allowed.

>look

 Sela occupied the majority of the room.  To her right was the foot of
 a bed.  To her left was part of a closet door.  My mirrored space was
 a reflection of that, but the real world continued beyond any such
 parameters.

 Sela stood near with mirror in hand.

>open door
 That was not something I could open.

>move bed
 I pushed its reflection to the nothingness that was the Void.  And
 that which was being reflected disappeared as well.  Sela observed the
 action with dispassion.

 Sela occupied the majority of the room.  My mirrored space was a

 Sela stood near with mirror in hand.

 "The risk-reward is fair I feel
 I say to you we have a deal," said Sela.
 "How do I reach this 'Room' that you mention?
 And how shall I leave, by what convention?"

 I replied,
 "An earthly servant shall take you down
 First pack your bags and leave this town
 Meet it at the Heart of Clay
 It owes the mirror a favor, say

 When you reach the place of stands
 Where Destiny combines its strands
 Set me on the final top
 Make sure I stay, I must not drop

 The lamp awaits for whom would speak
 Its magic word, its name unique
 To leave the way your kind has done
 Just step into the middle sun

 On your trip if help is needed

 *An implosion of Purpose*

 A summons from mere existence.  The scattered undercurrents of Purpose
 integrated me, established meaning.

 A wish diminished me.  I fulfilled my summoner's desire expending
 Purpose.  I returned to my container before I was lost forever.

 "Undercurrents of Manipulation"
 A 2000 IF-Comp Entry by J.D. Berry (berryx@earthlink.net)
 Release 1 / Serial number 000927 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10

 Vault Entry Room
 The location of my summoner was a room between the surface of the
 world [physically west] and a complex of vaults [physically east].

 The room was a trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room, a
 portcullis barred the way to the outside.  To the other were the
 vaults for storage.  A patterned stone wall blocked their unauthorized
 access.

 The remains of a former summoner rested here.  An emerald had taken
 the place of his head.

 The summoner known as Seegan stood before me.

>Talk to Seegan.
 I told my Purpose.  I was a servant of limited power who would grant
 three wishes.  The first wish was to be stated within one minute of my
 explanation.  The second was to be stated on the day one year from the
 first, in the same physical location as the first.  The third, ten
 years on the day and in the same location.

>again
 Purpose had better uses than for talking needlessly.

 Seegan took out a hand mirror, looked at it for a final assessment and
 then put it away.  She told me, "I've thought about it, and I wish to
 be beautiful."

>grant wish








 I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
 stated desire.  Of those that would accomplish this, only one was I
 Willful enough to channel.

 The undercurrent that would alter my summoner's physical appearance
 was, by itself, more Purposeful than I could manage.  But if I
 simultaneously channeled an attractor current, I could integrate them
 through my summoner and fulfill the wish.  I chose the undercurrent of

 1)  lycanthropy.
 2)  a deep sleep.
 3)  an inhumanly shrill voice.

>2







 The wish was granted.

>examine seegan
 (Seegan)
 Her physical undercurrents stormed with attractiveness.  Her emotional
 winds raged with conflicting happiness and separation, dilemma and
 determination.  Her mental flows darted and crackled with creativity.

 She wore the ring that contained my essence.

>examine emotional
 The cold winds of separation flurried within her.  Together with the
 physical they linked, although distantly, to those of her father.
 Deep within these flurries was a pocket of fear, apparently kept in
 check by the torrent outside.

>examine physical
 Her undercurrents continued their warmth but now flowed with the winds
 and not against them.

>enter ring
 I entered my container, losing all links to the physical
 undercurrents.  I could not depart until I was summoned anew.

 [I waited for my next summons.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 *An implosion of Satisfaction.*

 Such was my first experience of joy.  Until that point in time, every
 summoner returning for another wish had increased San.  Through the
 happiness of Seegan, I felt more Purpose than I had ever known.

 "Great Djinni," my summoner said with much passion.  "I can't thank
 you enough--not only for making me beautiful, but for giving me the
 extra gift of the most pleasant sleep I have ever experienced.  My...
 YOUR ring kept me warm somehow, as long as I was wearing it.  I awoke
 months later when a traveling soldier arrived here and escorted me to
 the nearest village.

 It was at that village I met my husband.  I owe you that thanks as
 well.  I know I didn't need to explain, but I wanted to express my
 happiness.

 Do you have any further instructions for my second wish?  I will await
 your word before wishing."

>examine seegan
 (Seegan)
 Her physical undercurrents stormed with attractiveness and combined
 with those of another life.  Her emotional winds raged with happiness
 and determination.  Her mental flows darted and crackled with
 creativity.

 She wore the ring that contained my essence.

>examine physical
 Her undercurrents continued their warmth but now flowed with the winds
 and not against them.  An independent current flowed within her.  She
 was with child.

>examine emotional
 The cold winds of separation met with warm winds of happiness in a
 stormy mixture.  She had recently joined Purpose with a husband,
 restored a link to her father, and was with child.  However, the
 undercurrents of her sisters battered hers with a jealous rage.

>examine mental
 Her mental undercurrents were difficult for me to interpret.  Cold,
 then hot, then cold again.  These winds were conditioned, although not
 ruled, by her emotions.

>talk to seegan
 I told her that, in addition to the previous rules, I could not undo
 any direct effects of previous wishes.

 (I wondered then whether I should have told her about my new Purpose.
 Thanking her seemed "correct" somehow and yet not "appropriate"
 because it would likely have interfered with many undercurrents.)

 "I've known my second wish since I knew I was pregnant.  I wish my
 baby a long, healthy, happy, prosperous life."

>grant wish








 My recent exponential increase in Purpose evoked in me an awareness.
 The attractor winds that gave me control of the undercurrents were
 viewed as curses by my summoners.  By the time the summoner called
 upon me anew, any Satisfaction that might have been gained initially
 was eliminated by these curses.

 Why had Seegan been Satisfied?  I knew only one possibility.  She was
 without San.

 [I pondered.]








 I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
 stated desire.  Two of the requirements were a long and healthy life
 for her baby.  Purpose did not require expenditure for these.  The
 undercurrents of her baby flowed naturally and compatibly with her
 desires.  Rare it was that this occurred.  And to that point, never
 did I derive subsequent Satisfaction.

 [I pondered.  And for the first time, I could grant at least some of
 the wish without an associated "curse".]








 Her baby had strong undercurrents of happiness.  I would not need to
 do anything to grant that portion of the wish.  However, prosperity
 was another matter.  I could have channeled the undercurrents to make
 that happen, but not without cost.  I realized that I greatly risked
 Satisfaction if I attached a curse.  Perhaps there was treasure still
 remaining somewhere around the vaults that could assure prosperity.

>go east
 I was not impeded by the elements of the physical world.  The farther
 I traveled from the location of my initial summons, the more Purpose I
 expended.

 Then too I realized where I was and could [recall the area] whenever I
 needed.

 Vault Hall, Nearer to the Entrance
 The passageway began there and continued east.  There were doors on
 the northern and southern sides, each with a set of uniquely engraved
 runes.  A thick, stone wall blocked physical travel west.

>se
 Blasts of the physical and the mental passed through me as I entered
 the room.  They did no damage, but I felt their associated sensations.

 Vault Storage, Papers
 The room had many papers stored there.

 I sensed strong undercurrents from one of the deeds.

>examine deeds
 Only one of the deeds had any relevance--the deed of nobility.

>take deed
 Through Will of Purpose, I channeled the undercurrents of the Deed of
 Nobility.

>go northwest

>go west

 The remains of a former summoner rested here.  An emerald had taken
 the place of his head.

 The summoner known as Seegan rested before me.

 The wish was granted.

>enter ring
 My container could not contain such Purpose.

>go east

>go east

 Vault Hall, Away from the Entrance
 The passageway ended there, beginning from the east.  There were doors

 engraved runes.

>go north
 Blasts of the physical and the emotional passed through me as I
 entered the room.  They did no damage, but I felt their associated
 sensations.

 Vault Storage, Artifacts
 The room had many unique items stored there, but I was not concerned
 with them.

 I sensed strong undercurrents from a brass lamp.

>examine lamp
 It was a brass lamp with the name "Canloc" inscribed on its base.

>enter lamp
 I entered my container, losing all links to the physical
 undercurrents.  I could not depart until I was summoned anew.

 [I waited for my next summons.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 *An implosion of Satisfaction.*

 Seegan returned, although her physical currents had ceased.  She was a
 spirit, but her Purpose was still her own.

 My summoner spoke to me.  "Djinni, you made my life not only happy and
 fulfilling but also Purposeful.  I could not have asked for more.

 I died in childbirth with my third son.  I fell into another deep
 sleep from which I could not return.  Fortunately, my son is healthy
 and all else is well.

 But I gained immeasurably from my wishes and wouldn't change a thing.
 My last wish is for you."

 [I pondered.]








 "It was foretold that it was my Destiny to come here, that I was to
 wish my heart's desire.  I did not understand the implications of all
 that had transpired then and what a pawn I was.  Now, in my afterlife,
 I do.

 You are to go to the Room of Choices and stay there until the little
 boy arrives.  Destiny will be decided there.  If the three choices are
 in place, the boy will select which servant to unleash unchecked in
 the world and thereby its course.  If not, Will ceases to exist.

 You will require much Purpose in order to reach this room.  Thus, my
 last wish is for you to gain that Purpose.  Good luck, my friend."

>grant wish








 At first I did not know where to begin.  Eventually I realized I was
 able to manipulate my own undercurrents through those of Seegan.
 Without her wish, I would have never been able to achieve that.

 The Purpose undercurrents were strong, but her physical link to them
 was weakening rapidly.  I connected my own limited Purpose to the
 stream with her help.  As I did so, her link completely dissipated.

 The final wish was granted.

>restart
 I pondered.  Was I sure I wanted to restart?
>yes

 and followed the trail back to the village."  (I, being not human, was
 unaffected by her voice.)

 entered the room.  They did no damage, but I felt their associated
 sensations.

 Vault Storage, Artifacts
 The room had many unique items stored there, but I was not concerned
 with them.

 I sensed strong undercurrents from a brass lamp.

>enter lamp
 I entered my container, losing all links to the physical
 undercurrents.  I could not depart until I was summoned anew.

 [I waited for my next summons.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 *An implosion of Satisfaction.*

 Seegan returned, although her physical currents had ceased.  She was a
 spirit, but her Purpose was still her own.

 My summoner spoke to me.  "Djinni, you made my life not only happy and
 fulfilling but also Purposeful.  I could not have asked for more.

 I died screaming for my son when I saw him running for his life from
 several thugs.  My voice at that intensity paralyzed them.  It cost me
 my own life the process, but what mother wouldn't give her own for her
 child?

 But I gained immeasurably from my wishes and wouldn't change a thing.
 My last wish is for you."

>grant wish
 [I pondered.]








 "It was foretold that it was my Destiny to come here, that I was to
 wish my heart's desire.  I did not understand the implications of all
 that had transpired then and what a pawn I was.  Now, in my afterlife,
 I do.

 You are to go to the Room of Choices and stay there until the little
 boy arrives.  Destiny will be decided there.  If the three choices are
 in place, the boy will select which servant to unleash unchecked in
 the world and thereby its course.  If not, Will ceases to exist.

 You will require much Purpose in order to reach this room.  Thus, my
 last wish is for you to gain that Purpose.  Good luck, my friend."

 Vault Entry Room

 The remains of a former summoner rested here.  An emerald had taken
 the place of his head.

 The spirit of Seegan floated before me.









 At first I did not know where to begin.  Eventually I realized I was
 able to manipulate my own undercurrents through those of Seegan.
 Without her wish, I would have never been able to achieve that.

 The Purpose undercurrents were strong, but her physical link to them
 was weakening rapidly.  I connected my own limited Purpose to the
 stream with her help.  As I did so, her link completely dissipated.

 The final wish was granted.

 Vault Hall, Away from the Entrance
 The passageway ended there, beginning from the east.  There were doors
 on the northern and southern sides, each with a set of uniquely
 engraved runes.

>go north
 Blasts of the physical and the emotional passed through me as I
 entered the room.  Now closer in Purpose to physical beings, I began
 to feel some of the effects these traps caused.

 That room had been designed to store jewelry in glass cases.  All but
 one piece of jewelry had been taken.

 I saw a necklace there.

 The underground continued indefinitely.  The earth there was rich in

 Room Of Choices
 I saw a simple, large, circular room.  Within the room were three
 pedestals, each one meter tall.  Each appeared the same, each was
 spaced a uniform distance from the walls and from each other.  Each
 pedestal was the same in physical construction.  They were made of
 iron.

 A small circle had been inscribed around the exact center of the room.

 I saw the beginnings of many undercurrents there.  That room would
 soon be a focal point for a cataclysmic occurrence.

 Oasis, Military Headquarters
 The largest tent in the oasis was there where the military leaders
 plotted.  Maps were placed throughout.

 The summoner known as Major Labiiq continued his studies.

 Labiiq stopped to examine some maps.

>go west

 Oasis, Water Site
 The spring of fresh water marked the center of the oasis.

>destroy water
 I conjured a waterspout that scattered the entire contents of the
 spring into the sky.  Unexpectedly, I did not derive the Purpose that
 I felt I should have from doing that.

>go south
>destroy camels

 Oasis, Camel Area
 The camels had been trained and were equipped for battle.

 I thought to add to the misery of the humans not by destroying the
 camels directly but by forcing them from the oasis and into the
 desert.  The humans could see their only source of tranportation
 slowly leave them.

 This did not translate to Purpose, however.

 Shortly thereafter, the enemies of Labiiq sensed weakness in his camp.
 They left their nearby desert posts and stormed his oasis.  They
 discovered an opening in the bulwark and rushed in...

 Only to find a Purpose-starved servant waiting for them.

 [I sated my Purpose.]








 Afterwards there was nothing of real import nearby to destroy.  Soon I
 found myself confronted with the detestable necessity of returning to
 my container.

>go northeast

 Oasis, Military Headquarters

 The summoner known as Major Labiiq continued his studies.

 Rather than the look of horror most summoners had by that point,
 Labiiq cast a calm and knowing presence upon me.

>enter bottle
 I entered my container, losing all links to the physical
 undercurrents.  I could not depart until I was summoned anew.

 [I waited for my next summons.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 *An implosion of Satisfaction*

 Rarely was I summoned again by the same human.  Never were any pleased
 with what I accomplished.  Until then.  Perhaps his Satisfaction could
 be used to gain enough Purpose for my permanent freedom.

 Labiiq looked out at me, calmly.  "I know you rarely honor requests,
 but I think you'll feel differently when you hear mine.  First a
 little background...

 Research from my dig has revealed the location of others of your kind.
 According to my scrolls, three powerful servants are to wait in a
 "Room of Choices" for a little boy.  It will be this boy who chooses
 the fate of the people.

 Now I won't confirm or deny the validity of this prophecy, but the
 time for this event is unspecified.  Even if three of you are supposed
 to be there, there is no mention of when this is to occur.  Other
 scrolls on this matter claim there are different types of "servants."
 Some can grant wishes, some exist to wreak havoc, and so on.

 I believe this "Room of Choices" is far below my excavation site.  I
 believe there is a chance a wish-granting servant is there.  I don't
 believe my men will ever be able to dig below these shifting sands
 enough to reach there.

 By explaining all of this, I'm giving you an opportunity to build your
 power and to be one of the choices.  To build your power in the short
 term, my studies indicate following your nature.  To build your power
 permanently, you need to become the chosen one.  If you're so chosen,
 my studies indicate you will have your permanent freedom and even
 dominion in the world to come.

 But first you must get me the wish granter's container."

 Oasis, Water Site


 Oasis, Excavation Site
 I sensed strong undercurrents from that place the humans were
 excavating.

>destroy site
 I caused a tornado to enter the site and carry everything within it
 away.  After that, I opened the sand below, creating a tunnel.  Low
 recent gains from my destructions made me surprised how Purposeful I
 became after that one.  But Destiny had always made Itself easy to
 follow.

>go down

 Under the site
 The tunnel I created enough was large enough to support me but
 unnavigable for humans.  The air supports I created held the loose
 sand walls in tact.

 I sensed something farther down.

>go down

 Ruined Vault, Jewelry Room
 That room was perhaps once part of a larger vault complex, but then
 joined only the room to the east as still in tact.  It had been
 designed to store jewelry in glass cases.  All but one piece of
 jewelry had been taken.

 I saw a necklace there.

 I needed Purpose immediately and sensed an intense source of it in the
 adjacent room.

>take necklace
 When I touched the necklace, I felt powerful physical undercurrents
 that linked it to an area far beneath that room.  The necklace
 desolidified and then descended through the earth.

 I needed Purpose immediately and sensed an intense source of it in the
 adjacent room.

>go east

 Ruined Vault, Artifact Room
 The room had many unique items stored there, but I was not concerned
 with them.

 I sensed strong undercurrents from a black box.

>destroy box
 Since human misery was my objective and destruction merely a means
 toward that end, I would have gained more Purpose if the box were in
 tact.

>go south
 There was no Purpose in tunneling that way.

>xyzzy
 The timeless word temporarily integrated me.

>plover
 That was not an action my Purpose allowed.

>plugh

 *An implosion of Purpose*

 A summons from mere existence.  The scattered undercurrents of Purpose
 integrated me, established meaning.

 A wish diminished me.  I fulfilled my summoner's desire expending
 Purpose.  I returned to my container before I was lost forever.

 "Undercurrents of Manipulation"
 A 2000 IF-Comp Entry by J.D. Berry (berryx@earthlink.net)

 Vault Entry Room
 The location of my summoner was a room between the surface of the
 world [physically west] and a complex of vaults [physically east].

 The room was a trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room, a
 portcullis barred the way to the outside.  To the other were the
 vaults for storage.  A patterned stone wall blocked their unauthorized
 access.

 The remains of a former summoner rested here.  An emerald had taken
 the place of his head.

 The summoner known as Seegan stood before me.

>talk to her
 I told my Purpose.  I was a servant of limited power who would grant
 three wishes.  The first wish was to be stated within one minute of my
 explanation.  The second was to be stated on the day one year from the
 first, in the same physical location as the first.  The third, ten
 years on the day and in the same location.

>wait
 Time passed.

 Seegan took out a hand mirror, looked at it for a final assessment and
 then put it away.  She told me, "I've thought about it, and I wish to
 be beautiful."

>grant wish








 I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
 stated desire.  Of those that would accomplish this, only one was I
 Willful enough to channel.

 The undercurrent that would alter my summoner's physical appearance
 was, by itself, more Purposeful than I could manage.  But if I
 simultaneously channeled an attractor current, I could integrate them
 through my summoner and fulfill the wish.  I chose the undercurrent of

 1)  lycanthropy.
 2)  a deep sleep.
 3)  an inhumanly shrill voice.

>1







 The wish was granted.

>enter ring
 I entered my container, losing all links to the physical
 undercurrents.  I could not depart until I was summoned anew.

 [I waited for my next summons.]








 *An implosion of Purpose*

 *An implosion of Satisfaction.*

 Such was my first experience of joy.  Until that point in time, every
 summoner returning for another wish had increased San.  Through the
 happiness of Seegan, I felt more Purpose than I had ever known.

 "Great Djinni," my summoner said with much passion.  "I can't thank
 you enough--not only for making me beautiful, but for giving me the
 extra gift of being able to turn into a fox.  I escaped these vaults
 because in fox form I was able to slip between the bars and dash
 quickly to the nearest village.

 It was at that village I met my husband.  I owe you that thanks as
 well.  I know I didn't need to explain, but I wanted to express my
 happiness.

 Do you have any further instructions for my second wish?  I will await
 your word before wishing."

>talk to her
 I told her that, in addition to the previous rules, I could not undo
 any direct effects of previous wishes.

 (I wondered then whether I should have told her about my new Purpose.
 Thanking her seemed "correct" somehow and yet not "appropriate"
 because it would likely have interfered with many undercurrents.)

 "I've known my second wish since I knew I was pregnant.  I wish my
 baby a long, healthy, happy, prosperous life."

>grant wish








 My recent exponential increase in Purpose evoked in me an awareness.
 The attractor winds that gave me control of the undercurrents were
 viewed as curses by my summoners.  By the time the summoner called
 upon me anew, any Satisfaction that might have been gained initially
 was eliminated by these curses.

 Why had Seegan been Satisfied?  I knew only one possibility.  She was
 without San.

 [I pondered.]








 I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
 stated desire.  Two of the requirements were a long and healthy life
 for her baby.  The undercurrents of her baby, lycanthropy and life
 span, were incompatible.  The were-fox undercurrent needed redirection
 at that point in time or be integrated fully soon after.

 [I pondered.  And for the first time, I could grant at least some of
 the wish without an associated "curse".]








 Her baby had strong undercurrents of happiness.  I would not need to
 do anything to grant that portion of the wish.  However, prosperity
 was another matter.  I could have channeled the undercurrents to make
 that happen, but not without cost.  I realized that I greatly risked
 Satisfaction if I attached a curse.  Perhaps there was treasure still
 remaining somewhere around the vaults that could assure prosperity.

>take emerald
 Through Will of Purpose, I channeled the undercurrents of the emerald.

>grant wish
