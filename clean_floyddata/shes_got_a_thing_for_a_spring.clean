 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.









           There is nothing on this planet more pleasant
           than an outdoor bath in a 104 degree pool.
           Steam surrounds you in an ethereal massage.
           Tufa deposits line the steep walls behind you
           and brilliant green algae decorate the rock where
           the spring trickles in.
           A few bubbles and a small current
           rise from the depths...

 "She's Got a Thing for a Spring" is a short story, and you are the
 protagonist. It begins with a short section of text, followed by a
 prompt where you are invited to type your instructions to the main
 character in plain English. The game understands about 140 common
 verbs, and has a vocabulary of more than 1200 words. See the next
 topic for Instructions for Playing. The game will try to understand
 what you have typed, and the story progresses as the game reacts to
 your input.

 The goal is simple. Have fun. Experiment. The author has made an
 effort to anticipate the reasonable inputs of the player, and some
 that are not so reasonable. The game should react with an appropriate
 response or action to whatever you type, or will ask you for
 clarification.

 This game was written in a language called Inform, which was created
 by Graham Nelson. It was compiled into a format which can be run on
 any of a dozen different computer platforms using an interpreter
 specific to the machine. The various interpreters and Graham's
 excellent compiler and library can be found on the Interactive Fiction
 Archive, at <A HREF="http://ifarchive.org">http://ifarchive.org</A> or ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org . There
 are many other games similar to this one available at the same
 locations. Anyone interested in discussing game design and theory
 should check out the newsgroup rec.arts.int-fiction (RAIF). Those
 interested in discussing games and hints should find
 rec.games.int-fiction (RGIF) more to their liking.

 This game was created as a birthday gift for Lorelle, the author's
 wife, and her love of hot springs was the inspiration for the story.
 The creatures that inhabit the game are those that Brent and Lorelle
 have had the pleasure of watching, and many of the situations in the
 game come from real experiences. Even the main character, Bob, is
 based to some extent on real people from the real world, although the
 specific details are pure fiction.

 "She's Got a Thing for a Spring" won 4th place in the 1997 Interactive
 Fiction Competition. It was nominated for four XYZZY awards in 1997:
 Best Writing, Best Setting, Best NPCs, and Best Individual NPC. It won
 the award for Best Individual NPC, Bob.

 Enjoy this game. It is completely free, and may be distributed
 unchanged in any format. No profit may be derived from the
 distribution except for a nominal fee for the duplication of the

 The author has made an attempt to simplify conversing with NPCs (non
 player characters). Specifically, the game remembers who is the
 current target of your conversations, and also what the last type of
 command to that npc was. Then, for future conversations, that
 information does not have to be typed again. This should simplify and
 streamline the tedium of typing and allow the player to concentrate on
 what is being asked or said. For example:

 You can see Bob here.

 "I love my cabin," Bob says to you, adjusting the photograph. "I've
 lived here for a couple of years."

 "This old picture?" he smiles. "That's my mother and her sisters."

 You are carrying:
   an invitation to a party
   a fake fur hat

 "I wouldn't miss that if I were you," he says with a wink.

 "You might put that on, my dear," he says with concern. "The wind's
 blowing, and you should keep warm."

 Suddenly, Bob turns toward the cabin. "Would you like something to
 eat?" he asks you.

 "Great! Follow me inside, we'll have lunch," he says as he disappears
 into the cabin.

 As in the last command, any statement that is not recognized by the
 game as a valid verb is interpreted to be a statement to the npc, if
 he's present. Some verbs (like yes) also work this way. So the player
 can simply type "yes" instead of "say yes to Bob", although that will
 also work. There is a meta command "npc" which will tell you, the
 player, what the game remembers as the current npc and the current
 verb type. At the end of the previous command, if you type:

 The current npc is Bob.
 The current verb type is 'show'.


 This was an experiment in an attempt to simplify NPC conversations.
 The author would appreciate any comments. Did this work?  Was it
 confusing?  How could it be improved?  Please email Brent VanFossen

 Release 2, 3, and 4:

 Release 2 was only available on the CU Amiga Covermount CDrom
 published in 1998. Release 3 quite possibly never escaped the author's
 computer.

 This is a list of the changes that have been made to the program since
 its first appearance in the 1997 IF Competition. I'm sure there are
 other differences that I've forgotten. Thanks again to all who
 commented or sent bug reports. I believe I have fixed all the known
 bugs and implemented almost all of the suggestions. The list serves as
 a rough chronology of the revision process.

 Since it's impossible to list changes to a work without revealing some
 of the details of that work,

 "This is it!" he says as he dodges the last pothole and brings the
 truck to a stop. After twenty miles of the worst washboard road the
 country has to offer, you're just happy to have arrived.

 You place your sandaled feet on solid ground and take a deep breath.
 The smells of autumn are at once sweet and earthy and full of the
 aroma of moisture and living things. A cool breeze blows in your face,
 soft and gentle. What a nice change, what a welcome relief from the
 tension and hustle of all you've left behind this weekend. It's just
 you and your husband, as he promised over a month ago.

 You look around. What passes for the road you just traveled ends
 abruptly here. Over the last hour, bad asphalt gave way to gravel,
 which gave way, in turn, to the rutted two-track you see beside you.
 Ahead, the ruts continue, but it'll be on foot if you're to go any
 further. The old beater truck stands here, engine off but still
 ticking from the trip. Your husband closes the driver's door and comes
 around the rear to join you.

 "How's my pretty lady?" he asks as he wraps his arms around you and
 places a kiss on your cheek from behind. "Tired, huh? Come on. Let's
 get the stuff. We'll be able to relax better once the tent's up."

 He takes the two packs from the back of the truck and helps you into
 yours, then leads the way through the brush to the north. You roll up
 on the balls of your feet and give your pack a nudge, then pull the
 waist strap tight. Without looking back, you follow.

 That was last night, and you hiked a short trail to a campsite off in
 the woods. Together you set up the tent, fixed a quick dinner, and
 fell asleep in each other's arms...

>q







 You wake with a start, something's missing, and you notice the
 sleeping bag is empty beside you. On his pillow is a handwritten note,
 which you collect. He must have crawled out early, as the sky is only
 now beginning to lighten.

 You dress quickly, slip out of the tent, and follow the trail to the
 east.

 Aspen Grove
 You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all
 directions. Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin
 fingers, stroking the clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of
 gold rattle as the winds shift, and here and there one floats to the
 ground to join others that crackle underfoot when you move. A narrow
 path disappears east into the trees, and a camping area is visible
 through a small opening to the west. North is a wide meadow.

 You take the note from your pocket and read it again:

 My Love:

 For five years now we have shared so many times together and made so
 many memories. All the places we've gone, the things we've seen, the
 friends we've met along the way.

 This is a favorite place of mine, I hope it will be for you. And I
 have a small birthday surprise in store. Meet me this evening in the
 hot spring. I'll find you there.

 B


 Your birthday. The real reason for this outing. And a real hot spring!
 Outdoors! Now, that's your idea of a good time.

 You have so far scored 0 out of a possible 20, in 2 turns, earning you
 the rank of Sula nebouxii (Blue-footed Booby).

 Up and over your head it goes.

 You are now wearing only a pair of flipflops.
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine me
 "You," he always tells you, "are my pretty lady." You smile at the
 thought. He's always quick to tell you how he likes that smile, your
 easy laugh, your blue-green eyes that "sparkle" so. It's probably all
 just a little silly, but you like it nonetheless.

 You are wearing only a pair of flipflops.

>examine guidebook
 A well-worn copy of "A Field Guide to the Natural History of the
 Mountainous Regions". On the cover are drawings of birds, mammals,
 plants, and trees. Many pages are marked with notes and scribbles, and
 the text describes the creatures and natural features of the area.

>look up booby in guidebook
 Latin name: Sula nebouxii

 The blue-footed booby is a sea bird found in North America along the
 Gulf of California and off the coast of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico.
 Adults have bright blue feet, a bluish-gray bill, white breast, and
 brown wings. They fish in clear, shallow waters close to shore, and
 work in small flocks.

 Aspen Grove
 You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all
 directions. Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin
 fingers, stroking the clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of
 gold rattle as the winds shift, and here and there one floats to the
 ground to join others that crackle underfoot when you move. A narrow
 path disappears east into the trees, and a camping area is visible
 through a small opening to the west. North is a wide meadow.

>go west
 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Campsite
 Ah, yes. The campsite. Last night, when the two of you were pitching
 the tent, it was already dark and the wind had a bite to it that cut
 to the skin. It made crawling into the sleeping bag that much more
 pleasant. But now it's weekend! Just you and your husband as he
 promised over a month ago.

 The tent is right where you left it, of course, on a bed of leaves
 between a pair of the biggest trees. In the light of day, you can see
 a meadow to the north. A path leads east.

 A large bull elk and his harem sit in the shade in front of the tent.

 From the north, an eerie bugle rises above the wind and the rattling
 of the leaves in the surrounding trees. The large bull in front of you
 lifts his head, as if to listen, but does not move.

>examine leaves
 Aspen leaves litter the ground, scattered in patterns of yellow,
 orange, and green that blend together like an Escher drawing. Small
 piles of them have collected against the trunks of the nearby trees.

 You hear it again, a wild bugling to the north.

>count them
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>bugle wildly
 You can't see any such thing.

>count leaves

 reconsider.

 You hear it again, a wild bugling to the north.

>bugle me
 Off in the distance, you hear a wilder bugle in response.

 You hear it again, a wild bugling to the north.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 The bull elk turns to look directly at you. He's not sure whether to
 take that as a challenge or as an offer.

>ride elk

 As you move toward the elk, he looks directly at you, and you
 reconsider.

 You hear it again, a wild bugling to the north.

>go north

 West Edge of Meadow
 You are at the west edge of a large grassy meadow. Leaves from the
 surrounding trees litter the ground, piled against the tall white and
 black boles of the aspens that used to be their owners. To the south
 is your campsite.

 You hear it again, a wild bugling to the east.

>examine holes
 You can't see any such thing.

>look up elk in guide
 Latin name: Cervus elaphus

 The elk is a large member of the deer family, and is common in the
 mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Also known as the
 wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly
 larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is
 similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is
 the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the
 preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the
 public's favor.

 Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up
 to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head
 and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter
 brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in
 color.

 The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest
 and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger
 groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the
 males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in
 the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating.
 This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and
 dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an
 opponent.

 The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also
 applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow
 large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February
 or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds.
 Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing
 the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another.

 You hear it again, a wild bugling to the east.

>look up grue in guide
 You discover nothing of interest in the guidebook.

>go east
 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Meadow
 You are in the middle of a large grassy meadow, bordered by aspens and
 a few white spruce in all directions. Pockets of morning fog squat in
 the damp and cold, hovering just above the ground and hiding from the
 sun that melts the hazy edge where they touch.

 A young bull elk occupies the middle of the meadow. In a ritual
 performed for millennia, the beast lifts his head, antlers pointed
 back and neck stretched tight. A haunting bugle fills the air, first
 rising in pitch, then dropping quickly. A short series of grunts ends
 the sequence. As you approach, he pauses long enough to move off to
 the north.

>go north
 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 North Edge of Meadow
 You are at the north edge of the large and grassy meadow, bordered by
 aspen. Fireweed grows at the base of the trees, pink blooms withered
 and gone to seed.

 The elk, sensing your presence, moves off to the southeast.

>remove flops
 You step out of your flipflops and pick them up.

 You are now wearing some shorts and a shirt.

 You can hear an elk bugling to the southeast.

>se

 East Edge of Meadow
 The east end of the meadow is rocky, and you make your way carefully
 when you move. Further east, a granite cliff blocks your way. The
 remnants of an old mountain trail lead northeast.

 Continuing his bugling, the young elk walks west.

>bulge
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>bugle
 Off in the distance, you hear a wilder bugle in response.

>go northeast

 Mountain Trail
 You are on an old mountain trail, hewn from the rocks and trees
 probably 100 years ago. Highbush cranberry grows amongst the aspens,
 and where the trees part enough to let the sky show, fireweed fills
 the openings with profusion. The path turns from southwest to north.

>get cranberry
 The highbush cranberries are not important.

>go up
 The cliff is too steep to climb.

>go north

 Homestead
 The years have not been kind to this remnant of the past, although the
 obviously recent repairs hide the worst of the scars. An old-fashioned
 log cabin occupies an opening in the woods, door swung open onto the
 wide front porch. The single window looks out onto the clearing, alert
 and watchful, with a country plaid curtain that flutters in the
 breeze. A trail leaves to the south and continues around the cabin to
 the north.

 On the porch is an oak rocking chair and a galvanized steel bucket.

 An old man stands on the front porch of the cabin, leaning on a broom
 and watching as you approach. He gives you a curious look, but says
 nothing.

>examine fireweed
 You can't see any such thing.

 Off in the distance, you hear a wilder bugle in response.

 The man looks at you expectantly as he resumes his sweeping. His
 attitude isn't unfriendly, but rather curious as to who might be
 coming to visit in such an out-of-the-way place.

>greet man
 "Good to meet you," he says. "My name's Bob."

>remove shorts
 "Don't do that here, young lady. There's a chill in the air and you'll
 catch cold."

 Bob goes back to his sweeping, intent on finishing the job.

>get bucket
 "Go ahead and borrow that old bucket, if you think you need it," Bob
 says to you. "Folks gotta help each other, you know."

>kick bucket
 Bob may be a doctor, but his name isn't Kevorkian.

 Bob pauses to examine a crack in the flooring of the porch. "I'll have
 to fix that," he says.

>look up highbush cranberry in book
 Latin name: Viburnum edule

 A member of the honeysuckle family, the highbush cranberry grows in
 the montane and lower subalpine habitats and prefers open areas in
 damp woods. The bush grows to a height of 3 to 4 feet, and in the
 fall, the leaves turn a brilliant red. It blooms in clusters of white
 star-shaped flowers, and the fruits are small red berries with a
 single flat seed in each.

>go south

 Mountain Trail
 You are on an old mountain trail, hewn from the rocks and trees
 probably 100 years ago. Highbush cranberry grows amongst the aspens,
 and where the trees part enough to let the sky show, fireweed fills
 the openings with profusion. The path turns from southwest to north.

>look up bob in guidebook
 You discover nothing of interest in the guidebook.

 On the porch is an oak rocking chair.

 Bob looks up from his sweeping and nods as you approach, giving you a
 surprised look. "You ought to get dressed, my dear," he says to you in
 a kindly way. "There's a chill in the air, and you'll likely catch
 cold."

 Bob stops to grab a leaf that is stuck in a crack. He throws it aside
 and continues sweeping.

>wear bucket
 You can't wear that!

 Bob bends to pick a rock out from between two of the planks. "Always
 tracking in rocks," he says.

>ask bob about bob
 "I was a country doctor, an obstetrician," he says to you. "Sally and
 I couldn't have children, but I made my living from helping other
 people have theirs. Didn't make much. So many of the people couldn't
 pay. But those little babies, I think of every one of them as my own.
 Some of them would come back and I'd deliver their child. Kind of like
 watching your own grow up. Did that for 32 years. Now I just work my
 garden. Try not to think too much about the past."

>wear shorts
 You put on the shorts.

 Bob moves the broom to sweep the left side of the porch.

>ask bob about sally
 "Sally. Now there was a woman. We were highschool sweethearts, married
 for 43 years. Then, we found out she was sick, and three months later,
 she was gone. Breast cancer. Died of breast cancer four years ago. I'm
 a doctor and I should have known." He looks at you and shakes a sad
 head. "I saw all the signs, and I didn't even recognize them. Guess I
 just couldn't believe it could happen to us. Of all people, I should
 have known."

>ask bob about husband
 "Can't say I know a thing about that."

>ask bob for mammogram
 Bob just looks at you and shrugs. "If you see that around, just help
 yourself," he mutters.

 "That hot spring's back in one of the canyons, not far from here. Make
 sure you don't miss it. It's quite a treat."

>read note
 You take the note from your pocket and read it again:

 My Love:

 For five years now we have shared so many times together and made so
 many memories. All the places we've gone, the things we've seen, the
 friends we've met along the way.

 This is a favorite place of mine, I hope it will be for you. And I
 have a small birthday surprise in store. Meet me this evening in the
 hot spring. I'll find you there.

 B

 Bob swats at a mosquito. "Darned bugs," he mutters. "No way to get
 away from them.".

 You can't see any such thing.

>ask bob about canyon
 "The canyon is just down the way, made of granite and steep as can
 be."

 Dark Hallway
 This is a long east-west hallway, dark and featureless. Smooth black
 walls line the way, disappearing into the inky stillness to the west.
 East, a small rectangle of light hovers in the distance. A hollow
 voice beckons to you from that direction.

>go west
 You move west, into the inky blackness, the darkness so thick, you can
 almost feel it. The air prickles with the energy of the past. When the
 feeling subsides, you find yourself back where you began...

 Homestead
 The years have not been kind to this remnant of the past, although the
 obviously recent repairs hide the worst of the scars. An old-fashioned
 log cabin occupies an opening in the woods, door swung open onto the
 wide front porch. The single window looks out onto the clearing, alert
 and watchful, with a country plaid curtain that flutters in the
 breeze. A trail leaves to the south and continues around the cabin to
 the north.

 On the porch is an oak rocking chair.

 You can see Bob here, sweeping his porch.

 He sweeps a bit more, all the while looking at you. "I wonder why they
 don't seem to bother you. I've got my own private cloud of bugs, and
 you just sit there pretty as can be." He shrugs his shoulders, and
 swats at another one.

 Auditorium
 Newly dug, this immense auditorium is almost pristine. Hundreds of
 rows of plush velvet seats surround the main stage in a graceful 'U'.
 Wide aisles allow easy passage, and converge into a shallow orchestra
 pit. There is a brightly-lit doorway to the west, over which hangs the
 helpful sign, "Exit."

 On the stage you can see a podium.

 You seem to have arrived just in time. Eileen Mullin straightens her
 little black dress and walks over to the podium. Pausing, she clears
 her throat to get everyone's attention.

>examine eileen
 "Shhhhhh!" someone says from a seat nearby. "These are the XYZZY
 awards!"

 "Welcome to the second annual XYZZY awards," she says. The crowd
 cheers. Baby cries! Slowly, the noise abates. After the usual
 preliminaries, she continues. "I will present the first award, the
 winner of the Best Use of Medium."

>sit
 "Shhhhhh!" someone says from a seat nearby. "These are the XYZZY
 awards!"

 Eileen opens the envelope, and exclaims, "The Tempest ... Graham
 Nelson!!!!" The crowd goes wild. Someone calls for his acceptance
 speech in iambic pentameter.

>wait

 Soon, Eileen speaks again. "Here to present the award for best
 individual PC is the Adventurer! Take it away!" With a few quick steps
 to the stage, Nameless Adventurer takes the podium. Away.

>wait

 Returning from backstage, he/she clears his/her throat. Ripping open
 the envelope, he/she exclaims, "Tracy Valencia from Interstate Zero!"

>wait

 The crowd erupts in applause and shouts. Clearly, the audience is
 pleased. Someone snickers about nudity.

>inventory
 "Shhhhhh!" someone says from a seat nearby. "These are the XYZZY
 awards!"

 Eileen exclaims, "Here to present the award for Best Individual NPC is
 last year's winner: the devil from Small World!" The devil, only a
 little taller than you, pops out of a volcano and walks to the stage.
 He's got a wand in one hand and a scrap of parchment in the other.
 "Thank you all. No, don't boo, really," he says.

>wait

 Waving his wand, there is a flash of light and a few red words appear
 midair. They erupt in a shower of sparks, only to fade a moment later.
 Before they go, you are able to read "She's Got a Thing for a Spring
 nature photo dude!"

>wait

 Bob walks quickly to the stage, his stride long and sure. A hammer
 hangs from his belt. A short discussion with the devil ensues,
 something about signing a contract. Then, with more strength than you
 would have imagined, Bob wrests the trophy away and returns to his
 seat. "She's got a thing for a squid!" comes from the right side of
 the auditorium.

>wait

 Nameless Adventurer returns to the stage. "Here to introduce the award
 for Best Individual Puzzle is a puzzle you all know and love... Here
 it is! The west pillar from So Far!"

>wait

 The west pillar leans and creaks as it makes its way to the stage.
 Rocking back and forth in excitement, it opens an envelope and pulls
 out a tax form. Recovering quickly, it opens a different envelope.
 "The winner is... Da da da da! The language puzzle in The Edifice!" A
 chant of "LPLPLPLPLPLPLPLPLP" rises from the crowd.

>examine pillar
 "Shhhhhh!" someone says from a seat nearby. "These are the XYZZY
 awards!"

 Eileen exclaims, "And now, presenting the award for Best NPCs, we have
 last year's winner... Evan, from Kissing the Buddha's Feet!!" Evan
 makes his way to the stage.

>wait

 Evan begins by giving an impromptu talk on how to beat the various
 Comp97 games. His speech lasts exactly one minute, then he says, "And
 the winner is...The Frenetic Five vs. Sturm und Drang by Neil
 deMause!" From off to your left comes "Yay for the famous five!" Then,
 someone claps twice and Neil begins to beep.

>wait

 Nameless Adventurer says, "To present the award for Best Puzzles,
 someone else you all know and love, from the award-winning So Far,
 here he is, ragged boy!"

>wait

 Ragged boy smiles pleasantly at everyone, opens an envelope, and pulls
 out a brush to draw a small picture of an edifice. Thumbs attack
 Lucian from every direction, all of them up.

>wait

 Eileen exclaims, "Here to present the award for Best Setting is least,
 oops, last year's winner... the devil from Small World!" Once again,
 the devil makes his evil way to the stage.

>wait

 The devil takes the nominees list and tries to get everyone to sign
 it. "And the winner is, A Bear's Night Out by David Dyte!" "Let's hear
 it for the bear!" comes from behind you. Someone screams.

>xyzzy
 "Shhhhhh!" someone says from a seat nearby. "These are the XYZZY
 awards!"

 Eileen exclaims, "And now to present the award for Best Story, I give
 you once more... the Nameless Adventurer!!!"

>wait

 Nameless Adventurer walks to the stage and thanks Eileen. "And the
 winner is... Babel, by Ian Finley!" "Babool! Babelfish! Babel! Babel!
 Babel!" come the cries. Someone in front of you emotes. "Ian Finley, a
 man whose initials spell IF!"

>wait

 Eileen exclaims, "And now, presenting the award for Best Writing, we
 have a rep from last year's winning game... Tato from So Far!!!"
 Someone yells, "Mr. Tato Head!"

>wait

 Tato bows grandly. "Attend you all! For on this paper scroll, is the
 winner, Sunset Over Savannah, by Ivan Cockrum!" "I-VAN COCK-RUM! (CLAP
 CLAP CLAPCLAPCLAP)," the crowd intones in unison.

>wait

 Eileen says, "And now, presenting today's final award, we have a rep
 from last year's winning game... Aessa from So Far!!!"

>wait

 There is a long pause. Liza clears her throat. Loudly. The crowd is
 anxious. Nothing happens. Finally, Zarf, looking characteristically
 smug, says "Look. I'll do it. She can apologize to me later."

>wait

 Zarf takes the stage. "The winner, for Best Game of 1997, is..."

>wait

 Zarf waits until the tension is almost unbearable.

>wait

 "Innnnterstate Zeeeeero, by Adam Cadre!!!!!!" Baby cries! Zarf dances
 around the stage, albeit for someone else's game. The din increases,
 "ADAMADAMADMADMADMADMADMADMA!" The noise is deafening.

>wait

 The crowd, rowdy beyond belief, rushes out of the auditorium to the
 west, carrying the winners as they go. When the clamor dies, you
 realize you stand alone.

>remove pants
 The ceremony is over. Nothing else seems to matter here.

>go west
 Shuffling past the now empty seats, you make your way to the exit.

 He sweeps a bit more, all the while looking at you. "I wonder why they

 swats at another one.

>#personals Are they?
 "Sounds familiar. Hmmm. Sorry."

>sit in chair
 You get onto the oak rocking chair.

 Overhead, you can see the early-morning sun as it rises a bit higher.

 Finished with his sweeping, Bob takes his broom and disappears into
 the cabin. "Be right back," he calls through the door.

 Bob comes out of the cabin and sits down beside the oak rocker. In his
 hand is a sheet of sandpaper.

>ask bob about canyon
 "The canyon is just down the way, made of granite and steep as can
 be."

 Bob sands on the left leg of the chair. Being a rocker, it moves a bit
 as he moves, and he wedges his foot under the runner to hold it still.
 He looks up at you with a smile. "Would you go out to the shed and get
 me one of the old bricks so I can keep this chair from rocking?" he
 asks. "I sure would appreciate it."

 Homestead (on the oak rocking chair)
 The years have not been kind to this remnant of the past, although the
 obviously recent repairs hide the worst of the scars. An old-fashioned
 log cabin occupies an opening in the woods, door swung open onto the
 wide front porch. The single window looks out onto the clearing, alert
 and watchful, with a country plaid curtain that flutters in the
 breeze. A trail leaves to the south and continues around the cabin to
 the north.

 On the porch is an oak rocking chair.

 You can see Bob here, sanding a handmade rocking chair.

 Bob gives the worn chair a thorough look, as if deciding where to
 start. "Yep, I love this old chair," he says to you. "Built by my
 grandpa just before I was born. Gave it to my mother, he did, and she
 rocked me to sleep many many times."

>go north
 You'll have to get off the oak rocking chair first.

 Bob slowly starts with the sandpaper on one of the arms, working
 carefully to remove the finish.

>stand
 You get off the oak rocking chair.

 Bob finds an area that seems particularly stubborn, and sands a little
 harder in that spot.

>go north

 Behind the Cabin
 The north side of the cabin is plain and unpretentious; not even a
 window provides a view in. A stone chimney forms most of the wall of
 the cabin. In the clearing here is a traditional antique outhouse,
 complete with a crescent moon. A wooden shed sits off to the side and
 a garden lies west. To the north through the trees, you can see the
 double tracks of an overgrown roadway.

>open shed
 That's not something you can open.

>examine shed
 The same hands that built the log cabin also made the shed, from the
 looks of it, but the timbers are of even more uneven cut. Leftovers
 from the bigger project, probably. The door, if there ever was one, is
 missing. A large paper wasp nest fills the upper left corner of the
 door to the shed, active and buzzing with insects.

>enter it
 You take a step towards the door of the shed, but the angry buzzing of
 the wasps inside and around the nest brings back memories of painful
 stings.

>examine shirt
 It says, "If you don't like my attitude, stop talkin' to me."

>search shed
 Through the guarded door of the shed, you can see shelves and other
 objects, but it's too dark inside to see more details.

 In The Cabin
 The inside of Bob's cabin is spartan but comfortable. A stone
 fireplace forms the north wall of the single room, and to the side
 stands a tall cabinet. One corner serves as a kitchen. South, a
 four-pane window looks out into the forest, the doorway open beside
 it.

 Bob comes in from outside and goes to the cabinet. "Need another piece
 of sandpaper," he says as he takes one from the shelf.

>get ashes
 You scoop the ashes out of the fireplace and onto the ground, soiling
 your fingers. In the ashes, you discover a sooty matchbook, which you
 take.

 Bob turns to you as he prepares to leave, and gives you an odd look.
 "It's nicer outside, my dear."

 Bob goes to work on the support for the rocker's arm. Sanding all four
 sides, he moves from top to bottom.

 This old gravel road hasn't been used in years. Weeds and small trees

>examine herbs
 Bunches of herbs grow all along the roadway. Among the many varieties,
 you note the low matted leaves of yellow mountain avens, with their
 bushy white seedheads on long stems.

>look up avens in guidebook
 Latin name: Dryas drummondii

 Also called yellow dryas, the yellow mountain aven is a small,
 prostrate plant that often grows in large mats or patches on rocky
 ground from middle elevations to above timberline. The flowers are
 yellow, about 1" wide, with eight to ten short yellow petals and stand
 2 to 10 inches high. The leaves are green above and gray or brown
 below. As the flowers go to seed, they gradually straighten up, with
 long (2") white plumes untwisting into a dandelion-like seed head,
 soft and feathery like down.

 Boulder Pile
 You are at the edge of a large field of pink granite boulders. Lichens
 in various colors pattern the rocks. A narrow gravel road, overgrown
 with weeds, leads off into the distance to the north. You could also
 scramble down into the canyon where a fast-moving stream rumbles and
 flows.

 From off in the distance, you hear a sharp "neep!"

>neep
 The pika shifts his gaze to look at you, but fears to approach.

 A pika appears on one of the boulders in front of you, pauses, and
 disappears.

>look up pika
 (in the guidebook)
 Latin name: Ochotona princeps

 The pika is a small mammal related to the rabbits and hares, and is
 about the size of a hamster, with round ears and no tail. It lives in
 rock piles at elevations above 4000 feet, and does not hibernate. As
 winters can be long in the mountains, the summer and fall months are
 spent gathering vegetation, which is set out to dry in "haystacks".
 The dried forage is then stored away as food for the winter months.

 More often heard than seen, they will announce their presence with a
 high-pitched nasal "neep!" from a vantage on one of the larger rocks
 in their territory. As their coloration blends with their habitat,
 varying from brown to gray, they are often difficult to spot. A
 patient observer, however, can watch them on their many trips to the
 nearby vegetation along one of their several paths. After a few
 moment's time, they return to the rock pile, flowers and herbs
 crosswise in their mouth, and deposit their gatherings on the top of
 the haystack to dry.

>bugle
 Off in the distance, you hear a wilder bugle in response.

 An enormous bull moose breaks through the bushes and stands on the
 road, twenty paces away.

>neep
 The moose looks at you and sniffs. He's not sure whether to take that
 as a challenge or as an offer.

 The moose looks directly at you and drools. You realize he's about ten
 times as big as you are.

>look up moose
 (in the guidebook)
 Latin name: Alces alces

 The moose is the largest member of the deer family, and is common in
 subalpine meadows and marshes of the northern United States and
 Canada. So ugly it is almost cute, it has a large muzzle and long legs
 that aid it in reaching the tender vegetation which grows at the
 bottom of lakes and ponds or higher on trees than other animals can
 browse. One of its favorite foods is the branches and twigs of the
 willow.

 Its pelage is dark brown, slightly lighter underneath. When wet, it
 usually appears black. Males stand six feet high at the shoulder, and
 weigh up to 1600 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. The large
 palmate antlers grow only on the males and are shed in the early
 months of each year. They begin growing again immediately, and each
 year grow larger, so that their size indicates approximate age and
 maturity. An unusual feature of the male is the bell, a flap of furred
 skin that hangs from the neck. Its purpose is unknown.

 The moose breaks into a trot, head lowered directly at you, and
 rapidly closes the distance.

>look up elk
 (in the guidebook)
 Latin name: Cervus elaphus

 The elk is a large member of the deer family, and is common in the
 mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Also known as the
 wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly
 larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is
 similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is
 the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the
 preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the
 public's favor.

 Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up
 to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head
 and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter
 brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in
 color.

 The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest
 and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger
 groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the
 males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in
 the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating.
 This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and
 dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an
 opponent.

 The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also
 applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow
 large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February
 or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds.
 Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing
 the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another.

 The bull moose, sensing your indecision, moves quickly, lifts you with
 an antler, and tosses you easily onto the sharpest boulder in sight.

 Granite Canyon
 You're on a shelf overlooking a small canyon, apparently carved by the
 nearby stream and 20 or 30 feet deep. A rocky path enters from the
 west beside a tangle of blackberries, and dead ends at a ledge
 overlooking the stream below. Above you, granite walls continue to
 rise, the pink stones a beautiful contrast to the clear blue sky. An
 animal trail leads up, too steep to walk, but you might be able to
 make it in a scramble.

 Beside you stands a small tower supporting one end of a steel cable.

 The end of a spruce branch is just barely visible deep inside the
 blackberries.

 There is no reply.

>climb tower
 There would be no point in climbing the tower.

>examine tower
 An 8 foot tower made of steel angles. An identical tower stands at the

 them. A crank with a handle is attached to the base.

 A wire cage hangs from the cable at the far tower.

>examine blackberries
 (the ripe blackberry)
 Large and ripe, this blackberry just begs to be eaten.

>get branch
 The stick is so far inside the tangle, you'd cut yourself to pieces

>take blackberry
 (the ripe blackberry)
 You're an old hand at blackberries, having grown up in the Northwest
 where the bushes grow like weeds. You taught him how to find the good
 ones before he was even your husband, avoiding the clinging spider
 webs that would invariably be there if you didn't look. The two of you
 would walk along the backroads and fill a cup and stain your hands
 purple. But it always seemed worth the effort, the berries were so
 sweet. Today, alone, you carefully avoid the thorns and pick the
 largest berry from the bush.

>turn cable
 You are unable to.

>turn handle

 You grab the crank by the handle, its squeaks startlingly loud and
 annoying. Foot by foot, the trolley makes its way across the river

>enter trolley
 You climb into the trolley which swings and bounces unnervingly.

 It's a tight little cable car, only 18 inches wide and 4 feet front to

 This beautiful spot is a staging area for many ventures into the
 mountains, as evidenced by the national forest sign before you. A
 dense thicket of willow surrounds the landing. A wooded trail heads
 southeast.

 Behind you, a trolley sits suspended from a steel cable.

 You can see a national forest trail sign here.

 The sign is brown with cream lettering, and reads:

 "Mirror Lake 16 miles"

 The trail leaves to the southeast. Below it is another sign with
 smaller print advising visitors of back-country etiquette, use of
 campfires in designated locations, warnings about the hazards of
 feeding wild animals, and the like.

 Overhead, you can see the mid-morning sun peek from behind the clouds,
 trying to cut the crisp chill from the autumn air.

 A medium-sized gray bird, of quite ordinary appearance. And quite

>look up bird
 (in the guidebook)
 Latin name: Tyrannus tyrannus

 The eastern kingbird is a flycatcher, hunting insects on the wing. It
 has a large head, whiskers, and a broad-based flat bill. Its head is
 black, with a gray back and white underparts. They are common in
 woodland clearings and are often seen near water. They range
 throughout most of North America north of Mexico.

>get bird
 The American Dipper is not important.

>look up dipper
 (in the guidebook)
 Latin name: Cinclus mexicanus

 The American dipper, occasionally called the water ouzel, is common
 along fast-moving mountain streams. It is a round, gray bird with a
 short tail and large yellow legs. Its voice is a trill in flight, and
 sings at rest with cheeps, buzzes, whistles, and warbles.

 A distinguishing behavior, making it a most interesting bird to watch,
 is its ability to walk on the bottom of the fastest-moving stream,
 apparently unaffected by the current. Then, it will jump out of the
 water onto a moss-covered boulder, and bob and curtsey in place, with
 aquatic larvae, snails, or tiny fish in its mouth.

 It has enormous oil glands for waterproofing feathers, flaps to seal
 its nostrils, and heavy nictitating membranes (transparent extra
 eyelids) which aid in its regular dives. The dipper breeds in the
 early spring, building a domed nest of ferns and fine mosses, which it
 hides in a rock crevice in a streamside cliff. Often, nests will be
 placed completely out of harm's way under an overhang behind a
 waterfall. They lay usually 4 to 5 eggs, which hatch in 16 days.
 Lifespan is 2 to 5 years.

 The dipper jumps into the water with hardly a splash and walks along
 the bottom.

 Mossy Grotto
 Ferns and mosses of luscious green hang from the walls of this cozy
 grotto into which a misty waterfall plunges some 60 feet. Spray fills
 the air to mix with the wall of rising steam from the west, almost
 hiding the thermal waters of the hot spring. A narrow fissure leads
 through a crack in the rocks to the southeast.

 The dipper flies low to a nearby rock, and curtsies. Then, so fast you
 almost don't notice, he ducks behind the waterfall and disappears.

 Latin name: Cervus elaphus

 The elk is a large member of the deer family, and is common in the
 mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Also known as the
 wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly
 larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is
 similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is
 the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the
 preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the
 public's favor.

 Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up
 to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head
 and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter
 brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in
 color.

 The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest
 and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger
 groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the
 males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in
 the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating.
 This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and
 dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an
 opponent.

 The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also
 applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow
 large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February
 or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds.
 Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing
 the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another.

 You can hear an elk bugling in the distance to the north.

 As you enter the campsite, you watch in surprise at the scene
 unfolding before you. The young bull elk approaches the older, larger
 male. With head lowered, he goads the other to his feet. They meet,
 antlers locking in a duel of strength. The rattling, clashing sound
 mixes with guttural grunts and snorts, each twisting the other.
 Somehow, the younger of the two persists, the older pushing him
 backward a short distance away from the tent, but unable to rid
 himself of the challenger. They seem oblivious to your presence.

>enter tent

 In The Tent
 As you crawl inside, your mind drifts back to a camping trip the two
 of you took together a few years ago. It was in the woods above a
 beach, with the Pacific thundering at the base of the cliff just below
 you. The wind was cool, not unlike today, and swept in from the water
 with the smell of salt. This same tent was new then, and you laughed
 together as you tried to remember how the poles were supposed to fit.

 The tent is only slightly roomier inside than it would appear. Two can
 sleep comfortably here, side-by-side or like spoons, with only enough
 space at the foot for essential camping gear. It has a somewhat musty,
 much-loved scent, a smell it has earned with its years of frequent
 use.

 A blue rubber bag sits at the foot of the tent.

 rise, the pink stones a beautiful contrast to the clear blue sky. An
 animal trail leads up, too steep to walk, but you might be able to
 make it in a scramble.

 Beside you, a trolley sits suspended from a steel cable.

 By The Stream
 You are at the north edge of an enticing mountain stream. The sound of
 the water flowing over rounded stones is enough to bring relaxation to
 even the weariest of travelers. Good thing, too, as your sore muscles
 scream from bouncing over too many rough roads. The only obvious trail
 leaves north.

 You can see Bob here, his stride long and sure, moving faster than
 most men half his age.

 Bob walks to the edge of the stream and places his leather portfolio
 carefully out of reach of the water. "This is such a beautiful
 stream," he says, his eyes alive. "I come here often and never get
 tired of the view."

 Bob opens his portfolio and removes an easel, which he sets up beside

 Bob puts a small sheet of watercolor paper with an unfinished painting
 on the easel.

>painting
 "I love to paint the water," he answers. "And this time of year, the
 reflections are the best. Rich with color."

>examine water
 (the stream)
 The stream babbles and beckons to you, and flows over a small
 waterfall from the east to disappear west. It's a pleasant sight after
 the last few weeks, and your eye lingers lazily to take it all in. The
 arrhythmic gurgles and splashes put you quickly at ease.

 Bob looks up suddenly, as if an idea has just struck him. "Do you like
 to read?" he asks you.

>yes
 "I thought so!" he says with an excitement he hasn't shown since you
 arrived. He goes to his portfolio and removes a well-worn paperback.
 "This is a collection of short stories I found, and it's an absolute
 delight to read. You might take it with you when you visit the hot
 spring. I love to pass the time there with a good book," he says as he
 hands it to you.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>read it
 You open the collection of short stories, flipping quickly past the
 contents and the editor's notes. The first story begins:

 The Meteor, the Stone and a Long Glass of Sherbet
 by Angela M. Horns

 Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of
 the breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia.
 As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their
 breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession
 and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life
 being an Ambassador.

 The story continues, but you close the book until later. A good story
 is so much better when you can read it straight through. Maybe at the
 hot spring...

 Taking the paints from the portfolio, Bob puts them on the shelf below
 the painting.

>thank bob
 "No problem. Don't mention it," he says graciously.

 "Look who's coming!" shouts Bob, pointing toward the sky. A black
 shape soars overhead, and as you watch, tucks its wings into a pair of
 somersaulting rolls. Then, as if that were nothing, it lands in the
 branches of a cottonwood just upstream. "Rawk!" croaks the raven, its
 voice coarse and commanding.

 "I love ravens," Bob exclaims. "There's a lot of lore and legends
 about them. The Tlingit Indians believed the raven created the world
 and was the bringer of light, and they wove them into their stories
 and totem poles and ceremonies. A lot of people think they're ugly,
 all black and bad luck, but there's a bird that knows how to have fun.
 I love to watch them fly. And the noises they make."

>raven
 "Those birds sure know how to have fun," he smiles. "There are
 prettier ones, but none with the same personality."

>examine raven
 A large black bird, the raven watches every move you make, every
 stroke of Bob's brush. Occasionally he emits a deep croak or gurgle.

 "The coloration is so subtle," he tells you, "I could spend forever
 working on a painting like this."

>raven, hi
 The raven is not important.

 Bob takes a look upstream, at the fast-flowing water and the
 moss-covered rocks. Then, he dips his brush and makes a few short dabs
 on the canvas.

>caw
 "That's a funny thing to ask an old man about."

 A dark gray bird flies to a moss-covered rock, pauses, and disappears
 under the surface of the water.

 "There's a dipper!" Bob points. "He'll be back in just a second. Those
 birds walk through rapids and don't even get wet. At least, they don't
 seem to notice."

>read note
 You take the note from your pocket and read it again:

 My Love:

 For five years now we have shared so many times together and made so
 many memories. All the places we've gone, the things we've seen, the
 friends we've met along the way.

 This is a favorite place of mine, I hope it will be for you. And I
 have a small birthday surprise in store. Meet me this evening in the
 hot spring. I'll find you there.

 leaves north.

 Perched in the branches of a nearby cottonwood is a large black raven.

 You can see Bob here, painting a watercolor of a fast-moving stream.

 The bird flies quickly downstream, dodging rocks and roots, and
 disappears.

 Bob looks up at the stream, then back at his canvas.

 Rocky Path
 A narrow winding path moves through the trees, gently climbing from
 west to east. Branches of blackberries encroach on the trail, their
 fruit nestled amongst the thorns. A small stream is visible through
 the trees to the south, and through the bushes, you can barely make
 out the shape of a small tower to the east.

>go west
 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Aspen Grove
 You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all
 directions. Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin
 fingers, stroking the clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of
 gold rattle as the winds shift, and here and there one floats to the
 ground to join others that crackle underfoot when you move. A narrow
 path disappears east into the trees, and a camping area is visible
 through a small opening to the west. North is a wide meadow.

 Meadow
 You are in the middle of a large grassy meadow, bordered by aspens and
 a few white spruce in all directions. The afternoon sun shines bright
 and cheery, illuminating the gold leaves of the aspen that glow with a
 false warmth.

 You can hear the sound of clashing antlers in the distance to the
 west.

 West Edge of Meadow
 You are at the west edge of a large grassy meadow. Leaves from the
 surrounding trees litter the ground, piled against the tall white and

 is your campsite.

 North Edge of Meadow
 You are at the north edge of the large and grassy meadow, bordered by
 aspen. Fireweed grows at the base of the trees, pink blooms withered
 and gone to seed.

 You can hear the sound of clashing antlers in the distance to the
 southwest.

 You wander a bit into the forest, but directions are confusing, and

 remnants of an old mountain trail lead northeast.

 Mountain Trail
 You are on an old mountain trail, hewn from the rocks and trees
 probably 100 years ago. Highbush cranberry grows amongst the aspens,
 and where the trees part enough to let the sky show, fireweed fills
 the openings with profusion. The path turns from southwest to north.

>go north
 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Homestead
 The years have not been kind to this remnant of the past, although the
 obviously recent repairs hide the worst of the scars. An old-fashioned
 log cabin occupies an opening in the woods, door swung open onto the
 wide front porch. The single window looks out onto the clearing, alert
 and watchful, with a country plaid curtain that flutters in the
 breeze. A trail leaves to the south and continues around the cabin to
 the north.

 On the porch is an oak rocking chair.

 A Northern Flicker is perched high in the branches of a nearby spruce.

>examine flicker
 It's a Northern Flicker, "the red-shafted variety," Bob told you. It's

 Behind the Cabin
 The north side of the cabin is plain and unpretentious; not even a
 window provides a view in. A stone chimney forms most of the wall of
 the cabin. In the clearing here is a traditional antique outhouse,
 complete with a crescent moon. A wooden shed sits off to the side and
 a garden lies west. To the north through the trees, you can see the
 double tracks of an overgrown roadway.

>go north
 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Overgrown Roadway
 An abandoned dirt road ends here, as the trees abruptly close in and
 block further passage west. The road heads up the mountain to the
 east, and through the trees to the south, you can see a log cabin.

 Gravel Road
 This old gravel road hasn't been used in years. Weeds and small trees

>examine moose
 Antlers are the first thing you notice, large and wide and made of
 more points than you can count. The long snout angles down, giving you
 a clear view of the beady brown eyes and the bristling hackles on the
 back of his neck. He takes a few quick steps in your direction, moving
 the huge rack side to side.

 The moose breaks into a trot, head lowered directly at you, and
 rapidly closes the distance.

>go down
 The moose follows you to the edge of the canyon and watches as you
 scramble down. The trail is steep, and you slide to the bottom. Those
 silly flipflops don't help, and you nearly come out of them.

 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Granite Canyon
 You're on a shelf overlooking a small canyon, apparently carved by the
 nearby stream and 20 or 30 feet deep. A rocky path enters from the
 west beside a tangle of blackberries, and dead ends at a ledge
 overlooking the stream below. Above you, granite walls continue to
 rise, the pink stones a beautiful contrast to the clear blue sky. An
 animal trail leads up, too steep to walk, but you might be able to
 make it in a scramble.

 Beside you, a trolley sits suspended from a steel cable.

>look up moose in guide
 Latin name: Alces alces

 The moose is the largest member of the deer family, and is common in
 subalpine meadows and marshes of the northern United States and
 Canada. So ugly it is almost cute, it has a large muzzle and long legs
 that aid it in reaching the tender vegetation which grows at the
 bottom of lakes and ponds or higher on trees than other animals can
 browse. One of its favorite foods is the branches and twigs of the
 willow.

 Its pelage is dark brown, slightly lighter underneath. When wet, it
 usually appears black. Males stand six feet high at the shoulder, and
 weigh up to 1600 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. The large
 palmate antlers grow only on the males and are shed in the early
 months of each year. They begin growing again immediately, and each
 year grow larger, so that their size indicates approximate age and
 maturity. An unusual feature of the male is the bell, a flap of furred
 skin that hangs from the neck. Its purpose is unknown.

>enter trolley
 You climb into the trolley which swings and bounces unnervingly.

 You pull on the cable and the car slowly moves away from the tower and
 over the edge of the gulch. As the ground drops away, your stomach
 nearly goes with it, the bouncing and swaying of the trolley
 exaggerating the feeling of height. Hand over hand you pull, and
 eventually find yourself at the other side.

 You get out of the trolley.

 Trailhead
 This beautiful spot is a staging area for many ventures into the

 (genus Salix)

 Willow is a generic name given to an entire family of shrubs that grow
 in dense clumps near water. They produce catkins, or pussy-willows, in
 the spring, and cottony seeds later in the year. They have elongated
 blue-green leaves, many species have hairy twigs. They are a favorite
 food for the browsing moose.

 political goals, a haunting story of a man who relives painful moments
 from his past, a sci-fi thriller about a virtual reality simulation
 gone bad, a miniature world in need of a good turn, and 23 others. It
 should make excellent reading.

>read it
 You open the collection of short stories, flipping quickly past the
 contents and the editor's notes. The first story begins:

 The Meteor, the Stone and a Long Glass of Sherbet
 by Angela M. Horns

 Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of
 the breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia.
 As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their
 breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession
 and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life
 being an Ambassador.

 The story continues, but you close the book until later. A good story
 is so much better when you can read it straight through. Maybe at the
 hot spring...

 Behind the Cabin
 The north side of the cabin is plain and unpretentious; not even a

 Homestead
 The years have not been kind to this remnant of the past, although the
 obviously recent repairs hide the worst of the scars. An old-fashioned
 log cabin occupies an opening in the woods, door swung open onto the
 wide front porch. The single window looks out onto the clearing, alert
 and watchful, with a country plaid curtain that flutters in the
 breeze. A trail leaves to the south and continues around the cabin to
 the north.

 On the porch is an oak rocking chair.

 A Northern Flicker is perched high in the branches of a nearby spruce.

 Mountain Trail
 You are on an old mountain trail, hewn from the rocks and trees
 probably 100 years ago. Highbush cranberry grows amongst the aspens,
 and where the trees part enough to let the sky show, fireweed fills
 the openings with profusion. The path turns from southwest to north.

 You are in the middle of a large grassy meadow, bordered by aspens and

 Aspen Grove
 You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all
 directions. Slender trunks reach for the sky, silhouetted in the
 moonlight against the scattered clouds that blow in the evening
 breeze. Leaves rattle as the winds shift, and here and there one
 floats to the ground to join others that crackle underfoot when you
 move. A narrow path disappears east into the trees, and a camping area
 is visible through a small opening to the west. North is a wide
 meadow.

 You are at the north edge of the large and grassy meadow, bordered by

 Hundreds of fireflies fill the air, each a momentary pinpoint of light

 sending signals to others of their kind, a cold green glow that lights
 up the corners of the meadow. To the east, the full moon sits above
 the trees.

 The inside of Bob's cabin is spartan but comfortable, lit by a single

 You can see Bob here, engrossed in a hardback book.

 You can also see a pile of ashes here.

 He gives the lid a twist with such force that you're sure the jar will

 Gravel Road
 This old gravel road hasn't been used in years. Weeds and small trees
 grow up through the right of way, and it would be difficult but not
 impossible to move further west. The way south is relatively clear.

 Small bunches of herbs grow along the side of the roadway.

>s.d
 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Boulder Pile
 You are at the edge of a large field of pink granite boulders. Lichens
 in various colors pattern the rocks. A narrow gravel road, overgrown
 with weeds, leads off into the distance to the north. You could also
 scramble down into the canyon where a fast-moving stream rumbles and
 flows.

 The moose breaks into a trot, head lowered directly at you, and
 rapidly closes the distance.
 The moose follows you to the edge of the canyon and watches as you
 scramble down. The trail is steep, and you slide to the bottom. Those
 silly flipflops don't help, and you nearly come out of them.

 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Granite Canyon
 You're on a shelf overlooking a small canyon, apparently carved by the
 nearby stream and 20 or 30 feet deep. A rocky path enters from the
 west beside a tangle of blackberries, and dead ends at a ledge
 overlooking the stream below. Above you, granite walls continue to
 rise, the pink stones a beautiful contrast to the clear blue sky. An
 animal trail leads up, too steep to walk, but you might be able to
 make it in a scramble.

 Beside you, a trolley sits suspended from a steel cable.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>go east
 That would be a long drop down into the canyon.

>enter trolley
 You climb into the trolley which swings and bounces unnervingly.

 You pull on the cable and the car slowly moves away from the tower and
 over the edge of the gulch. As the ground drops away, your stomach
 nearly goes with it, the bouncing and swaying of the trolley
 exaggerating the feeling of height. Hand over hand you pull, and
 eventually find yourself at the other side.

 You get out of the trolley.

 Trailhead
 This beautiful spot is a staging area for many ventures into the
 mountains, as evidenced by the national forest sign before you. A
 dense thicket of willow surrounds the landing. A wooded trail heads
 southeast.

 Behind you, a trolley sits suspended from a steel cable.

 You can see a national forest trail sign here.

>go north
 Someone wanted to hide this trail, you think as you push the willows
 out of the way. You would never have seen it from the trailhead if you
 hadn't expected it to be here.

 Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

 Canyon Rim
 Rugged and narrow, the ledge you walk follows the rim of the canyon
 north and south. Below, you see and hear the roaring stream as it
 makes its way south and turns a corner. As you move north, the canyon
 narrows to a fissure, its walls rising to funnel you in.

 You can see a faded wooden sign here, half hidden among the willows.

>go north
 Splish splash. Splish splash. Splish splash.

 Fissure
 The canyon rim trail descends, clinging tightly to the stone wall,
 then disappears entirely as the rocks converge. You have no choice but
 to wade, the current swift and powerful. Overhead, a small slice of
 the sky is visible between the two cliff faces, covered with ferns
 that thrive in the dark moist environment here. The crevice runs
 northwest to south.

 As you step into the icy water, your flipflops come loose and
 disappear downstream.

 The American Dipper emerges from below the surface of the stream and
 stands, bobbing in place, at its edge.

 Mossy Grotto
 Ferns and mosses of luscious green hang from the walls of this cozy
 grotto into which a misty waterfall plunges some 60 feet. Spray fills
 the air to mix with the wall of rising steam from the west, almost
 hiding the thermal waters of the hot spring. A narrow fissure leads
 through a crack in the rocks to the southeast.

 The dipper jumps into the fastest part of the stream, and returns a
 moment later with a small insect in its bill.

 Bracing yourself against the sting and the cold, you step through the
 falls. The cold water fills the bucket. It also soaks you from head to
 toe.

 Behind The Waterfall
 Behind the waterfall is a narrow space protected from the splashing by
 a rock shelf overhead. You've barely enough room to stand, half
 hunched and awkward. Blocking your view southwest is the waterfall,
 whose icy needles sting when they strike. To the northwest is a watery
 tunnel leading into the mountain itself.

 At waist-level is a bird's nest on the cliff face among the mosses and
 ferns, hidden from all eyes but yours. From what you remember, this
 looks like a dipper's nest.

 Watery Tunnel
 Your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness to reveal a tunnel filled with
 icy water. The walls are cold and wet, and close in as you move
 deeper, blocking the little light that bounces in from the opening
 southeast. A cold breeze blows in your face from the west, but you can
 see nothing in that direction.

 As you move into the darkness, an eerie green glow emanates from your
 glass canning jar. The fireflies inside blink their cold light, each
 at its own timing, and the flickering casts shadows on the wall of the
 tunnel you travel.

 Cavern
 Strange shapes surround you, shadows moving quickly along the walls.
 The effect is amplified by the uneven and blinking green light from
 the fireflies in your glass canning jar. Stalactites hang and
 stalagmites climb, occasionally making thin columns that join the
 floor to the ceiling. A small pool of dark water collects drops from
 above, echoing in the eerie quiet. Your eyes survey the room, but the
 only way out is east.

 A banquet of your favorite hors d'oeuvres has been set out in a large

 The Meteor, the Stone and a Long Glass of Sherbet
 by Angela M. Horns

 Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of
 the breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia.
 As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their
 breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession
 and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life
 being an Ambassador.

 The story continues, but you close the book until later. A good story

 The American Dipper emerges from below the surface of the stream and
 stands, bobbing in place, at its edge.

>se
 You gather your clothes as you leave the grotto, and are now wearing
 some shorts and a shirt.

 Splish splash. Splish splash. Splish splash.

 Fissure
 The way is narrow here, walls of rising stone to either side, and
 water pours in behind you. You have no choice but to wade, the current
 swift and powerful. Overhead, a small slice of the sky is visible
 between the two cliff faces, covered with ferns that thrive in the
 dark moist environment here. The crevice runs northwest to south.

>go south

 Canyon Rim
 Rugged and narrow, the ledge you walk follows the rim of the canyon
 north and south. Below, you see and hear the roaring stream as it
 makes its way south and turns a corner. As you move south, the willows
 become more and more dense, the path harder to follow.

 You can see a faded wooden sign here, half hidden among the willows.

>go south

 Trailhead
 This beautiful spot is a staging area for many ventures into the
 mountains, as evidenced by the national forest sign before you. A
 dense thicket of willow surrounds the landing. A wooded trail heads
 southeast.

 Beside you, a trolley sits suspended from a steel cable.

>enter trolley
 You climb into the trolley which swings and bounces unnervingly.

 (First putting on the leather work gloves)
 You pull on the cable and the car slowly moves away from the tower and
 over the edge of the gulch. As the ground drops away, your stomach
 nearly goes with it, the bouncing and swaying of the trolley
 exaggerating the feeling of height. Hand over hand you pull, and
 eventually find yourself at the other side.

 You get out of the trolley.

 Granite Canyon
 You're on a shelf overlooking a small canyon, apparently carved by the
 nearby stream and 20 or 30 feet deep. A rocky path enters from the
 west beside a tangle of blackberries, and dead ends at a ledge
 overlooking the stream below. Above you, granite walls continue to
 rise, the pink stones a beautiful contrast to the clear blue sky. An
 animal trail leads up, too steep to walk, but you might be able to
 make it in a scramble.

 Behind you, a trolley sits suspended from a steel cable.

 You are at the edge of a large field of pink granite boulders. Lichens

 The bull moose, sensing your indecision, moves quickly, lifts you with

>look up owl
 (in the guidebook)
 Latin name: Strix nebulosa

 The great gray owl is the largest North American owl with a length of
 27 inches. It has heavily ringed facial discs and yellow eyes. The
 great gray lacks the ear tufts that some other owls, including the
 great horned, have. It inhabits dense coniferous forests, wooded bogs,
 boreal forests, and meadows of northern and western Canada, with a
 narrow extension of its range down into California and Montana. It is
 chiefly nocturnal, but will hunt by day during the summer in the
 northern part of its range.

 The pika runs down the right path and disappears into the vegetation.

>look up kingbird
 (in the guidebook)
 Latin name: Tyrannus tyrannus

 The eastern kingbird is a flycatcher, hunting insects on the wing. It
 has a large head, whiskers, and a broad-based flat bill. Its head is
 black, with a gray back and white underparts. They are common in
 woodland clearings and are often seen near water. They range
 throughout most of North America north of Mexico.

>look up pika
 (in the guidebook)
 Latin name: Ochotona princeps

 The pika is a small mammal related to the rabbits and hares, and is
 about the size of a hamster, with round ears and no tail. It lives in
 rock piles at elevations above 4000 feet, and does not hibernate. As
 winters can be long in the mountains, the summer and fall months are
 spent gathering vegetation, which is set out to dry in "haystacks".
 The dried forage is then stored away as food for the winter months.

 More often heard than seen, they will announce their presence with a
 high-pitched nasal "neep!" from a vantage on one of the larger rocks
 in their territory. As their coloration blends with their habitat,
 varying from brown to gray, they are often difficult to spot. A
 patient observer, however, can watch them on their many trips to the
 nearby vegetation along one of their several paths. After a few
 moment's time, they return to the rock pile, flowers and herbs
 crosswise in their mouth, and deposit their gatherings on the top of
 the haystack to dry.

>center
 Only a few inches wide, tiny feet have worn this pathway that winds

 it reappears again farther on.

 The pika dashes to the top of a nearby pink boulder, pauses, and lets
 out a loud "neep!"

>follow pika
 You can see the pika right here.

>examine pink boulder
 You need to be holding the picked avens before you can put them on top

 The pika runs down the center path and disappears into the vegetation.

 The boulders are half as large as you and made of a pink granite that
 is covered with lichens of various colors. Meager handholds and small
 crevices barely large enough for fingers mar the surfaces of the
 larger rocks. Nearly hidden amongst the stones are several tiny
 pathways.

 Hot Spring
 There is nothing on this planet more pleasant than an outdoor bath in
 a 104 degree pool. Steam surrounds you in an ethereal massage. Tufa
 deposits line the steep walls behind you and brilliant green algae
 decorate the rock where the spring trickles in. A few bubbles and a
 small current rise from the depths, massaging your tired body in all
 the right places.

 You soak for a few minutes, and wish for the soothing fragrance of
 eucalyptus, your favorite scent.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>put leaves in pool
 The leaves wilt and disappear, leaving the aroma of eucalyptus to
 hover in the air. It's relaxing and wonderful.

 You lean back to relax and close your eyes. The water is just perfect.
 The smell is heavenly and eucalyptus always was your favorite. The
 bubbles play over your body, and the food! What a banquet.

 You open your eyes with a start. Through the steam you see motion, a
 shape coming closer. The vapor still obscures his features, but the
 movements are as familiar to you as your own.

 You have so far scored 19 out of a possible 20, in 745 turns, earning

 You open the collection of short stories, flipping quickly past the
 contents and the editor's notes. The first story begins:

 The Meteor, the Stone and a Long Glass of Sherbet
 by Angela M. Horns

 Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of
 the breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia.
 As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their
 breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession
 and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life
 being an Ambassador.

 The story continues, and you turn the page. There's nothing like a
 good book at a hot spring.

 "Hey, hon. Glad to see you found it. Sorry I couldn't be here sooner,"
 he says, as he steps near the pool. "You're more beautiful every time
 I look at you. I always seem to forget." His smile widens.

 And then, so slowly at first that you aren't even sure when you
 notice, you become aware of the sounds around you. The bubbling of the
 hot spring. The relentlessly happy sounds of a robin in the distance.
 The soothing murmur of the stream as it flows over the worn stones
 that line its bed. "I love the noises here, the music of the
 wilderness," he comments, as if reading your thoughts. "And this
 little spring is completely private, I've taken care of that." With a
 wink, he steps toward you.

 In anticipation, you wait, the memories coming back in a flood. The
 trips together, weekend after weekend. The good friends and all the
 happy times. Slowly, deliberately, he starts to undress. And as many
 times as you've seen this, you can't help but watch. Each garment
 comes off to drop at his side, his clothes on yours. The last one
 removed, he smiles and steps into the pool.

 Your mind swirls like the water around you. He snuggles up close and
 takes your hand. All the tension goes, all the stress and frustrations
 leave. Gently, slowly, he takes you completely in his arms and pulls
 you near, your head to his chest, your body against his.

 In anticipation, you wait, the memories coming back in a flood. The
 trips together, weekend after weekend. The good friends and all the
 happy times. Slowly, deliberately, he starts to undress. And as many
 times as you've seen this, you can't help but watch. Each garment
 comes off to drop at his side, his clothes on yours. The last one
 removed, he smiles and steps into the pool.

 Your mind swirls like the water around you. He snuggles up close and
 takes your hand. All the tension goes, all the stress and frustrations
 leave. Gently, slowly, he takes you completely in his arms and pulls
 you near, your head to his chest, your body against his.


     *** You have won ***


 In that game you scored 19 out of a possible 20, in 746 turns, earning
 you the rank of Tyrannus tyrannus (Eastern Kingbird).

 Hot Spring
 There is nothing on this planet more pleasant than an outdoor bath in
 a 104 degree pool. Steam surrounds you in an ethereal massage. Tufa
 deposits line the steep walls behind you and brilliant green algae
 decorate the rock where the spring trickles in. A few bubbles and a
 small current rise from the depths, massaging your tired body in all
 the right places.

 The aroma of eucalyptus hovers in the air.

 You can see your husband here.

 "Hey, hon. Glad to see you found it. Sorry I couldn't be here sooner,"
 he says, as he steps near the pool. "You're more beautiful every time
 I look at you. I always seem to forget." His smile widens.

 And then, so slowly at first that you aren't even sure when you
 notice, you become aware of the sounds around you. The bubbling of the
 hot spring. The relentlessly happy sounds of a robin in the distance.
 The soothing murmur of the stream as it flows over the worn stones
 that line its bed. "I love the noises here, the music of the
 wilderness," he comments, as if reading your thoughts. "And this
 little spring is completely private, I've taken care of that." With a
 wink, he steps toward you.

 There is nothing on this planet more pleasant than an outdoor bath in

 deposits line the steep walls behind you and brilliant green algae
 decorate the rock where the spring trickles in. A few bubbles and a

 the right places.

 The bird flies quickly downstream, dodging rocks and roots, and
 disappears.

 You soak for a few minutes, and wish for the soothing fragrance of
 eucalyptus, your favorite scent.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>put leaves in pool
 The leaves wilt and disappear, leaving the aroma of eucalyptus to
 hover in the air. It's relaxing and wonderful.

 You lean back to relax and close your eyes. The water is just perfect.
 The smell is heavenly and eucalyptus always was your favorite. The
 bubbles play over your body, and the food! What a banquet.

 You open your eyes with a start. Through the steam you see motion, a
 shape coming closer. The vapor still obscures his features, but the
 movements are as familiar to you as your own.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>eat food
 What a pleasure! Hors d'oeuvres and wine in a real hot spring! And
 there's so much left.

>read book
 You open the collection of short stories, flipping quickly past the
 contents and the editor's notes. The first story begins:

 The Meteor, the Stone and a Long Glass of Sherbet
 by Angela M. Horns

 Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of
 the breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia.
 As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their
 breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession
 and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life
 being an Ambassador.

 The story continues, and you turn the page. There's nothing like a
 good book at a hot spring.

 Dark Hallway
 This is a long east-west hallway, dark and featureless. Smooth black
 walls line the way, disappearing into the inky stillness to the west.
 East, a small rectangle of light hovers in the distance.

 Here in the darkness, an eerie green glow emanates from your glass
 canning jar. The fireflies inside blink their cold light, each at its
 own timing, and strangely, there are no shadows at all.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a banquet
   a paperback
   a glass canning jar (which is closed)
   a rubber bag (which is open but empty)

 You are completely naked.

 You move west, into the inky blackness, the darkness so thick, you can
 almost feel it. The air prickles with the energy of the past. When the
 feeling subsides, you find yourself back where you began...

 Release 2, 3, and 4:

 Release 2 was only available on the CU Amiga Covermount CDrom
 published in 1998. Release 3 quite possibly never escaped the author's
 computer.

 This is a list of the changes that have been made to the program since
 its first appearance in the 1997 IF Competition. I'm sure there are
 other differences that I've forgotten. Thanks again to all who
 commented or sent bug reports. I believe I have fixed all the known
 bugs and implemented almost all of the suggestions. The list serves as
 a rough chronology of the revision process.

 Since it's impossible to list changes to a work without revealing some
 of the details of that work,

 "SHE'S GOT A THING FOR A SPRING" is a relatively large game, and I've
 included here the data from the compiler for your reference. In
 addition to this, let me just say that the source has nearly 17000
 lines of code. Of this, approximately 5000 lines deal with the main
 NPC, Bob, and the objects that he directly manipulates. He can make
 more than 400 independent moves during the course of a game. There are
 more than 100 topics that he will respond to, and each topic has 3 or
 4 synonyms. His responses often vary depending on the current
 situation, and sometimes with the time of day.

 Bob received a XYZZY award for Best Individual NPC in 1997. "She's Got
 a Thing for a Spring" was also nominated for three other XYZZYs: Best
 Writing, Best Setting, and Best NPCs.
