 GlkTADS - A text-only TADS 2.5.3 Interpreter.
 TADS copyright (c) 1993, 2000 by Michael J. Roberts.

    You are the tsar's son, Prince Ivan:  young and handsome, but with
 the dark, brooding nature of a Russian.  You're the most eligible
 bachelor in the realm, but also the most reticent around the opposite
 sex.  To escape the endless procession of beautiful women vying for
 your attention, you retreat alone to the forest to hunt and to brood.
    Although it is the middle of the afternoon, little light penetrates
 the thick canopy of leaves above you.  You have stopped on a
 north-south path to contemplate this thought:  "The soul of another is
 a dark forest."
    You carry a bow and a quiver slung over one shoulder.  There is a
 huge chip on the other shoulder.

 PREREQUISITES

 None.  No special knowledge of Russian folklore is necessary to play
 the game or solve its not too difficult puzzles.  If you're familiar
 with some version of the Firebird legend, that may or may not help you
 along.  Scholars from Vladimir Propp to Joseph Campbell have observed
 that the basic plot of the hero's story is unvarying; the storyteller
 merely chooses from available motifs to fill in the framework.  Some of
 the motifs I've selected are traditionally Russian, others are anything
 but, making this story what I hope to be a fresh retelling.

 FREEWARE OR CHARITYWARE

 This game is free.  I encourage you to share it with others, but you
 may not charge any money for it beyond the cost of the media it is
 stored on.

 If you enjoy "Firebird," please consider a monetary donation to a
 charitable organization to show your appreciation.  Here are some
 suggestions:

    1.  An organization in your area that helps resettle Russian
 immigrants.

    2.  A local arts organization that has recently or will soon program
 Stravinsky's "Firebird Suite."

    3.  A donation to make the 36-inch Lick Telescope Dome accessible
 for classes, concerts, and visitor programs.  Make checks payable to UC
 Santa Cruz Foundation, 74 River Street, 1st Floor, Santa Cruz, CA, USA
 95060-4593.

 See "PERSONAL NOTES" below to read why I suggest these causes.

 If you do make a donation, I would love to learn what cause my work
 benefited.  Please send me an e-mail at firebird@pobox.com.  Of course,
 no matter what, I am happy to hear your comments and field your
 questions on "Firebird."

 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

 First and foremost, thanks to my collaborator, friend, and husband,
 Chris Nebel.  He ably provided programming tutelage, debugging
 assistance, and advice on game design.  On those more than a few
 occasions when my imagination outstripped my programming abilities,
 Chris rolled up his sleeves and came up with the code that would make
 the story come alive as I intended.

 Thanks also to Dave Baggett, who has always greeted news of the game's
 progress with encouraging words.  Above and beyond the call of duty, he
 risked eyestrain one night playtesting the first beta as we traveled
 I-5 in California to a destination south of Tracy, north of Valencia.

 My betatesters taught me so much in seeing the game through the
 player's eyes.  You really can't say you've written interactive fiction
 until your work has gone through playtesting.  Big thanks go to:

 Kevin Bolduan
 John Francis
 Wendy-Ann Francis
 Liz Cyr Jones
 Jane Kerr
 Michael Kinyon
 Greg Thomas
 Christine Simoes Tilden

 Version 1.01 fixes a number of bugs reported by and adds features
 requested by Sam Barlow, Jason Dyer, Stephen Granade, and Paul O'Brian.
 Many thanks to them for taking the time to write to me.

 The peasants' "amusing national anecdotes" are reprinted with
 permission from Russian Fairy Tales (Guterman, Norbert, trans.).  New
 York:  Pantheon Books, 1945.

 Type "credits" for a list of code modules by other IF authors that were
 used in tbe preparation of "Firebird."  I most gratefully thank them
 for making their work available.

 PERSONAL NOTES

 I began this game in the summer of 1994 after editing some program
 notes for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra's performance of
 Stravinsky's "Firebird Suite."  To help in my research, Chris loaned me
 a book of Russian folk tales that had been a present from his
 grandparents.
    As time passed, we learned more about how Russian folk tales had
 been a part of Chris's family history.  His maternal grandfather was an
 astronomer who immigrated from Russia.  During the 1930s, he was
 working atop Mount Hamilton overlooking California's Santa Clara Valley
 (now also known as Silicon Valley). He took an interest in the teacher
 who schooled the children living up there.  They spent many an evening
 telling and retelling these old Russian tales, and before long they
 were married.  Russian folk tales thus played a part both in their
 courtship and in ours.  What's more, circumstances have brought Chris
 and I from Maryland to Silicon Valley to live within sight of Mount
 Hamilton and the historic Lick Observatory.

>examine me
 You look like no one other than yourself.

>examine chip
 It's just a figure of speech!  Must you examine everything?

>yes
 I don't know the word "yes".

>examine tree
 Which tree do you mean, the large tree, or the forest?

>large
 Some animal is making its presence known in the branches of this tree.
 Is it your prey?  You might be able to climb up the tree to get a
 better look.

>brood
 You lose yourself momentarily in moody and morbid meditation.

>xyzzy
 In a hollow voice, you mispronounce the only word in Czech you can
 remember.

>climb tree
 There really is nothing to grab onto.  The bark breaks off in your
 hands and you tumble to the ground.  It was not, however, an entirely
 fruitless effort:  you have disturbed the animal in the tree.  A bird
 flutters down and lights in a more visible spot.

>examine bird
 Voila!  Your prey du jour.  The flicker is identifiable by its red head
 and black and white body.  This species is common to North America but
 unknown to Russia, except, oddly, in this isolated forest.  It would
 fit in the palm of your hand.  Shooting it with an arrow is challenging
 sport, but don't expect it to make much of a meal.  Good thing the
 caterers are waiting with dinner at the edge of the forest.

>inventory
 You have a bow and a quiver.  The quiver seems to contain an arrow.

 The flicker suddenly takes wing and disappears into the forest.  Quick,
 follow it!

>follow flicker
 The Path's East Branch
    The forest primeval.  The north-south path branches off to the east.
    A flicker is here.

>take arrow
 You return the arrow to its quiver.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 The Path's East Branch
    The forest primeval.  The north-south path branches off to the east.
    A flicker is here.

>load bow
 I don't know the word "load".

>put arrow in bow
 Done.

>shoot flicker
 What do you want to shoot it with?

>arrow
 You really ought to aim at something first.

 The flicker suddenly takes wing and disappears into the forest.  Quick,
 follow it!

>follow flicker
 Off the Beaten Path
    The warm light of a gently burning fire beckons to you from the
 east.  You pick out the outlines of a hut just beyond it.  Return to
 the forest path by walking west.
    A flicker is here.

>aim arrow at flicker
 You carefully take aim at the flicker.

>shoot arrow at flicker
 The hapless bird collapses with a surprised "Awk!", and falls dead to
 the ground, impaled on your arrow.

 *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***

>take arrow
 You return the arrow to its quiver.

>take bird
 Taken.

>examine bird
 Poor, defenseless, dead flicker.  You never wanted to kill it.  You
 were just responding to societal pressures.

>examine fire
 It's a gently flickering pinpoint of light.  Probably a campfire, but
 who knows?

>examine hut
 You can see a small thatched roof, but that's all the evidence you have
 that you are seeing a hut ahead.

>go east
 An Old Woman by the Fire
    You have stepped into a clearing from a path to the west.  A fire
 burns steadily outside of a small thatched hut.
    An old woman is sitting by the fire.  Her back is turned, and you do
 not think she has noticed that you are here.  You stand silently behind
 her, watching in fascination as she places a crumb into an empty bag
 that she holds in her lap.  A moment later, she pulls a loaf of bread
 from the bag!  She repeats the process a second time and then a third.
 She must be a witch, known to you from your Russian upbringing as a
 baba yaga.

>talk to woman
 What do you want to ask her about?

>bird
 "That is not within my scope of practice," the baba yaga pronounces
 gravely.

>greet yaga
 I don't know the word "greet".

>show bird to woman
 The baba yaga isn't impressed.

>ask yaga about bag
 "Put what you will in the bag.  If it will be useful to you in another
 form, it will be given to you."

>ask woman about woman
 "What you see is what I am.  A crone with a bag."

>ask woman about hut
>ask woman about flicker
 "That is not within my scope of practice," the baba yaga pronounces
 gravely.

 "That is not within my scope of practice," the baba yaga pronounces
 gravely.

>put bird in bag
 The baba yaga warns you off that course of action.  "The bag does not
 have the power to bring back the dead."

>ask woman about russia
 The peasants aren't much use to you.

>ask woman about marriage
 I don't know the word "marriage".

>ask woman about love
 I don't know the word "love".

>get feather
 I don't see any feather here.

>put arrow in bag
 "Certainly this weapon is powerful enough for your purposes," says the
 baba yaga, pulling the bag away from you.

>inventory
 You have a bow, a quiver, and a dead flicker.  The quiver seems to
 contain an arrow.

>put quiver in bag
 The baba yaga yawns.  "I think you would find that a rather boring and
 unproductive transformation."

>put bow in bag
 "Certainly this weapon is powerful enough for your purposes," says the
 baba yaga, pulling the bag away from you.

>enter bag
 I don't know how to enter the magical bag.

>put fire in bag
 Stop fooling around trying to put the fire.

>put wang in bag
 I don't know the word "wang".

>pluck flicker
 I don't know the word "pluck".

>burn flicker
 Burning the dead flicker would serve no purpose.

>cook flicker
 I don't know the word "cook".

>inventory
 You have a bow, a quiver, and a dead flicker.  The quiver seems to
 contain an arrow.

>yeah, maybe we need to look around
 I don't know the word "yeah".

>out
 You can't go that way.  You can leave by going west.

>go west
 Off the Beaten Path

>verbose
 Okay, now in VERBOSE mode.
 Off the Beaten Path
    The warm light of a gently burning fire beckons to you from the
 east.  You pick out the outlines of a hut just beyond it.  Return to
 the forest path by walking west.

>go west
 A Light Beckons Through the Darkness
    The forest primeval.  The path continues north and south.  To the
 east you spy a light shining through the trees.

>go north
 The Path's East Branch
    The forest primeval.  The north-south path branches off to the east.

>go east
 Darker and Deeper
    The forest primeval.  A mulched path leads northeast.  Return to the
 north-south path by walking west.
    A wizened old man is here, his long beard flowing onto the ground.
 He is sitting on a stone counting the leaves covering the forest floor.
 He looks up at you and says, "Greetings, young man.  Are you here to
 shirk a task or to find one?"
    Shirking a task sounds more like your preferred activity, but you
 are loath to admit it to this stranger.  "Neither really," you answer,
 "I'm just here."
    "There's very little I have to say to a young man who is 'just
 here.'"  He casts you a dubious glance and shoos you off.  "Perhaps
 there are some other dark recesses of the forest you have not explored
 fully, hmmm?"

>examine man
 He looks as old as God and probably about as wise.

>examine leaves
 I don't know the word "leaves".

>examine stone
 I don't see any stone here.

>go northeast
 The old man knows best.  You're not ready to go this way yet.  Run off
 and explore the rest of the forest first.

>ask man about himself
 I don't know the word "himself".

>ask man about man
 The old man shakes his head, saying, "When I see that you are ready, I
 will tell you everything I know."

>ask man about flicker
 The old man shakes his head, saying, "When I see that you are ready, I
 will tell you everything I know."

>go north
 You can't go that way.  The old man redirects you.  "Go west," he says.

>go west
>go west
 The Path's East Branch
    The forest primeval.  The north-south path branches off to the east.

 You can't go that way.  Travel by walking north, south, or east.

>examine path
 I don't know the word "path".

>go north
 At the Path's Southwest Branch
    The forest primeval.  Branching off from the main north-south path
 is a small trail to the southwest.

>go southwest
 Deeper and Darker
    Scores of ancient trees with massive trunks and numberless gnarled
 branches prevent any light from reaching the forest floor.  A chill
 runs through you as you imagine every creature hidden in the shadows,
 one more threatening than the next.  You feel your way on a mulched
 path leading west.  You can return to the main path by walking
 northeast.
    The path is lined with a neatly trimmed boxwood shrubbery.  You
 think, "What threat could come from someone who cares so much about
 landscaping?"  Your mind quickly serves up the memory of an unstable
 gardener in your father's employ during your childhood who considered
 children and moles equal nuisances in the garden.  You remember a near
 escape when the gardener attempted to whack you with a sledgehammer.
 Suddenly the path and boxwood shrubbery seem hardly any comfort at all.

>examine shrubbery
 It's a low shrubbery, about a foot off the ground.  Dense, small, waxy
 leaves cover the surface.  The shrubbery has been trimmed square.  How
 you identified it as boxwood I'll never know.  You're pretty unschooled
 in horticulture.

>search it
 Stop fooling around trying to search the boxwood shrubbery.

>go west
 You are lost in the memory of that hammer-wielding maniac.  All you can
 think of is running from him in terror screaming, "Stop it, stop it!"

>climb shrubbery
 Stop fooling around trying to climb the boxwood shrubbery.

>hide
 I don't know the word "hide".

>examine shadows
 I don't know the word "shadows".

>scream
 I don't know the word "scream".

>yell
 Your throat is a bit sore now.

>run
 I don't know the word "run".

>think
 I don't know the word "think".

>dance
 I don't know the word "dance".

>go west
 You start to take a step, repeating to yourself over and over, "I must
 not brood, I must not brood."  Seems to be helping, but who knows?  It
 is statistically possible for there to be another murderous maniac
 waiting for you along the path.

>brood
 You lose yourself momentarily in moody and morbid meditation.

>don't brood
 I don't know the word "don't".

>go west
 "I must not brood" has become your mantra.  You repeat it over and
 over.  Your legs make giant strides over the path, mulch scattering in
 all directions under your footsteps.  The adrenaline courses through
 every cell of your body as with some relief you enter a clearing and
 encounter...

 An Immense Stone Wall
    The east-west path terminates at a large stone wall, which curves
 away to the northwest and southwest.
    You see a bronze plaque here.

>conquer fear
 I don't know the word "conquer".

>read plaque
 Hard to read, very stylized, but you make out "So wide, you can't get
 around it.  So high, you can't get over it.  So ..."  The rest is
 illegible.

>go under wall
 I don't understand that sentence.

>go through wall
 I don't know how to go through the large stone wall.

>examine wall
 It is a gleaming white monstrosity.  The walls are stuccoed and quite
 sheer.  You look up and can barely see the top.

>say "wall"
 Okay, "wall".

>go northwest
 Trudging around the wall, which reveals itself to be a large but
 unbroken circle, you arrive at the only interesting locale to be found
 in this vicinity.

 A Future Flower Bed
    Someone seems to have been preparing a flower bed here, flush
 against the wall.  The planting has yet to be done.  It must have been
 a Herculean effort to dig:  all around you the ground is hard and quite
 rocky.  The wall curves around to the northeast and northwest.

>dig under wall
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>ooh. We'll need a seed or acorn or sprig of ivy.
 I don't know the word "ooh".

>examine window
 I don't see any window here.

>examine tower
 I don't know the word "tower".

>bury flicker
 I don't know the word "bury".

>go northwest
 You almost completely circumnavigate the circular stone wall to find
 yourself at...

 An Immense Stone Wall
    The east-west path terminates at a large stone wall, which curves
 away to the northwest and southwest.
    You see a bronze plaque here.

>move plaque
 You can't move the bronze plaque.

>pull plaque
 Pulling the bronze plaque doesn't have any effect.

>push plaque
 Pushing the bronze plaque doesn't do anything.

>climb wall
 It is so high you can't get over it.  In fact, you can't get ON it much
 at all either.  There is nothing to grab onto, sending you tumbling to
 the ground for the second time today.

>go east
 Deeper and Darker
    Scores of ancient trees with massive trunks and numberless gnarled
 branches prevent any light from reaching the forest floor.  A chill
 runs through you as you imagine every creature hidden in the shadows,
 one more threatening than the next.  You feel your way on a mulched
 path leading west.  You can return to the main path by walking
 northeast.

>go northeast
 At the Path's Southwest Branch
    The forest primeval.  Branching off from the main north-south path
 is a small trail to the southwest.

>go north
 Deep in a Russian Forest, Under a Large Tree
    You are standing under a large tree.

>go north
 You trudge out of the forest.  Whether it is a long time or a short
 time, it matters not.  Speedily a tale is spun, with much less speed a
 deed is done.

 Back to Civilization
    You've reached the edge of this grand, untamed forest.  A short walk
 to the north are a collection of fawning underlings, waiting to make
 their daily petitions to you for your continued patronage.  In a glade
 an even shorter walk to the north, however, lurks a far more horrible
 threat:  a dozen young noble women, each eager to plant a kiss on your
 cheek.  You notice that they are all wearing lipstick.  Ack!  You know
 you'll break out in hives if that waxy mess touches your regal skin.
 The path leads south back into the forest.

>shoot underlings
 I don't know the word "underlings".

>go south
 Deep in a Russian Forest, Under a Large Tree
    You are standing under a large tree.

>go west
 You can't go that way.  You can go north out of the forest, south
 deeper into the forest, or up the tree.

>climb tree
 The bark breaks off in your hands and you tumble to the ground.  This
 time it truly was a fruitless effort.  You pick yourself up and brush
 off the dirt from your clothes.

>examine tree
 Which tree do you mean, the large tree, or the forest?

>examine large
 Which large do you mean, the chip, or the large tree?

>examine large tree
 There's nothing else of interest in the tree.

>examine large chip
 It's just a figure of speech!  Must you examine everything?

>drop it
 You can't drop the chip.

>examine bark
 I don't see any bark here.

>go south
 At the Path's Southwest Branch
    The forest primeval.  Branching off from the main north-south path
 is a small trail to the southwest.

>go south
 The Path's East Branch
    The forest primeval.  The north-south path branches off to the east.

>go south
 A Light Beckons Through the Darkness
    The forest primeval.  The path continues north and south.  To the
 east you spy a light shining through the trees.

>go south
 A Catering Camp
    Sigh!  Everyday existence is so tiresome.  The regal catering
 service has readied a sumptuous feast for you here at the edge of the
 forest.  Dozens of gleaming silver chafing dishes await your
 inspection, but the smell of hot food sickens you.  A massive copper
 samovar holds freshly brewed coffee.  Golden serving pieces have been
 splendidly arrayed before you, but you know you could never be allowed
 to pick them up and serve yourself.  If only your station in life
 allowed you to pack a lunch.  A roast beef sandwich and a cup of coffee
 eaten alone in the woods would be ideal.  Ugh, those peasant serving
 girls.  So crass.  Always cracking their gum and calling you "Hon."
 You can turn north back into the forest.
    The head caterer approaches you, bows low, and says, "Master, how
 good to see you.  I trust you had a successful outing in the forest?
 What do you have to give me?"
    You ignore the caterer's obsequious greeting and attempt to push
 past him.  Gently but firmly, he grabs you by the shoulders and looks
 sternly into your eyes.  "Master, as you remember, your father's
 instructions were not to serve you dinner until you brought back your
 kill."  You silently recall the circumstances under which these
 instructions were given.  Your father has found you insufficiently
 motivated to improve your hunting skills and would prefer your
 starvation if you do not start landing some game.

>give flicker to caterer
    The caterer claps his hands in delight and happily accepts the
 bloody mass of feathers.
    "Congratulations on your successful hunt, sir," he cries.  "Your
 father will be pleased.  He wanted me to tell you that he has left an
 urgent message for you just north of the forest.  But first, by all
 means, eat something.  I will prepare this flicker for you
 immediately."
    You tell the caterer not to bother.  "Just get me a roast beef
 sandwich and coffee quickly.  And don't assign Flo as my server."  The
 caterer obliges and ushers you to...

 Your Next Meal
    It's you, the food-service peasants, and a long wooden table.
    Sitting on the long wooden table is a mask.
    A strangely familiar busboy is here, busily cleaning the table.
    A strangely unfamiliar serving wench is here, awaiting your
 inspection.

 *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***

>examine wench
 Who is she?  Why haven't you noticed her before?  This young woman is
 beautiful!  Her loveliness is unmarred by any make-up.  Her hair falls
 in natural waves around her shoulders.  She approaches quietly and
 respectfully, lays out a place setting, and sets a sandwich and coffee
 before you.  She withdraws from your presence before you can even speak
 or look into her eyes.

>examine busboy
 No wonder he looks familiar.  It's your older brother, Vasilii.  Your
 father sent him in search of the Firebird after your brother Dimitri
 had failed.  The Firebird eluded him as well.  You thought your father
 had banished Vasilii to a distant tsardom, but you imagine that being
 reduced to the status of busboy is a very real exile for your
 ambitious, princely brother.

>get mask
 Taken.

>examine it
 The mask caricatures your eldest brother Dimitri.  Your father sent him
 three years ago to retrieve the magical Firebird from a nearby forest.
 Said Firebird had been stealing apples from one of your dad's rare 24K
 gold apple trees.  Since this was causing a considerable financial
 setback, your father said that if Dimitri brought back the Firebird,
 the tsardom would be his.  Dimitri came back empty-handed, lost his
 chance at the big promotion, and hasn't been able to get a date since.

>examine table
 On the long wooden table you see a cup of coffee, a plate, a spoon, a
 fork, a knife, a napkin, and an ambiguous utensil.

>utensil
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine utensil
 Fork?  Spoon?  Melon baller?  Difficult to say really.  Its markings
 only reveal that it is made of silver.  You figure that it must be good
 for something.

>get all from table
 cup of coffee:  Taken.
 plate:  Taken.
 spoon:  Taken.
 fork:  Taken.
 knife:  Taken.
 napkin:  Taken.
 ambiguous utensil:  Taken.

>ask vasilii about mask
 You won't glean much information asking Vasilii about the mask.

>ask vasilii about father
 You won't glean much information asking Vasilii about your father.

>ask vasilii about dmitrii
 I don't know the word "dmitrii".

>ask vasilii about wench
 You won't glean much information asking Vasilii about Elena.

>ask vasilii about dimitri
 "Such a shame about Dimitri.  The whole tsardom is laughing at him.  At
 least I live in anonymity.  If he enters the monastery, as I expect he
 shall, he will at last have some peace."

>examine plate
 A china plate decorated with little bunnies and chipmunks.  A childhood
 relic.  On the plate you see a roast beef sandwich.

>examine sandwich
 It's a roast beef sandwich, prepared, of course, just as you prefer:
 seeded rye bread, horseradish, and raw onions.  That should help keep
 the babes at bay.

>eat sandwich
 That was delicious!

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 You can turn north back into the forest.
    The head caterer is directing his staff through another
 pass-the-plate drill.

>go north

    The forest primeval.  The path continues north and south.  To the
 east you spy a light shining through the trees.

    The warm light of a gently burning fire beckons to you from the

>go east
 An Old Woman by the Fire
    You have stepped into a clearing from a path to the west.  A fire
 burns steadily outside of a small thatched hut.
    A baba yaga is sitting by the fire, a magical bag in her lap.

>put sandwich in bag
 The baba yaga yawns.  "I think you would find that a rather boring and
 unproductive transformation."

>put napkin in bag
 You drop the napkin into the bag and pull out a comfy blanket!

>put utensil in bag
 "What IS that thing?"  the baba yaga exclaims as you bring out the
 unknown utensil.  Since you can give her no definite answer, the baba
 yaga convinces you that it is best not to put it into the bag.  The bag
 cannot transform something it does not recognize.

>examine blanket
 It's very comfy, very large, and very warm.  There's nothing in the
 comfy blanket.

>put fork in bag
 You drop the fork into the bag and pull out what seems to be the same
 fork.  The witch, noticing the look of confusion on your face explains,
 "It may look unchanged, but do not believe appearances.  Perhaps you
 will discover its special use some day."

>examine fork
 It looks like an ordinary mysteriously transformed fork to me.

>inventory
 You have a bow, a quiver, a mask, a cup of coffee, a plate, a spoon, a
 knife, a comfy blanket, an ambiguous utensil, and a mysteriously
 transformed fork.  The quiver seems to contain an arrow.  Sitting on
 the plate is a roast beef sandwich.

>put spoon in bag
 You drop the spoon into the bag and pull out a shovel!

>get sandwich
 Taken.

>put plate in bag
 The plate with the bunnies and the chipmunks?  Life won't be the same
 without it, but you bravely drop the plate into the bag.  You are
 surprised to pull out a shield!

>put cup in bag
 The baba yaga moves the bag away from you.  "That cup still has some

 It's very comfy, very large, and very warm.  There's nothing in the

 deed is done.

 Back to Civilization
    You've reached the edge of this grand, untamed forest.  A short walk
 to the north are a collection of fawning underlings, waiting to make
 their daily petitions to you for your continued patronage.  In a glade
 an even shorter walk to the north, however, lurks a far more horrible
 threat:  a dozen young noble women, each eager to plant a kiss on your
 cheek.  You notice that they are all wearing lipstick.  Ack!  You know
 you'll break out in hives if that waxy mess touches your regal skin.
 The path leads south back into the forest.

>wear mask
 Okay, you're now wearing the mask.  Boy, do you look like a loser.

>go north
 The Opposite Sex
    This small glade is a favorite gathering place for your current set
 of groupies.  Although they are all attractive and of good families,
 you would rather impale yourself on a pike than marry one of them.
 They're swarming everywhere, their constant chattering an irritating
 drone to your ears.

 The women, mistaking you for your brother Dimitri, stop short, groan
 loudly, and immediately beat a path back to town.  Taking off the mask,
 you marvel at the blissful privacy your brother must enjoy.

 *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***

 To the north you can see an encampment of underlings; to the south, the
 primeval forest beckons.

>go north
 An Encampment of Underlings
    Some days more than a dozen men wait on you to offer their greetings
 and make their requests.  Thankfully, today there are only a few:
    You expect to see your masseur here, but instead there is an awfully
 goofy-looking fellow fooling with a floppy hat and fiddling with a fake
 mustache.
    Your allergist is here, wanting to give you another in a series of
 treatments to decrease your sensitivity to beeswax.
    One of your father's pages is here.  He bows low, hands you a
 message, and announces that a groom is waiting with one of your fastest
 horses at an inn just north of here.  You brush him aside and turn your
 attention to the message, which reads:

 "My dear son Ivan,
    I have spent many a sleepless night contemplating the fate of this
 tsardom.  Who will inherit my reign?  Not Dimitri.  I sent him in
 search of the Firebird, and he returned to me without ever having laid
 eyes on the creature.  His current shame is richly justified in view of
 the minuscule effort he put into the task.
    Your brother Vasilii's failure to capture the Firebird was perhaps
 even more disgraceful.  After having seen the Firebird, he did not
 persevere in his pursuit.
    That leaves you as my final hope, the last son able to lay claim to
 the reign of this land.  I have feared that you would not be able to
 leave the well-tended gardens of your own thoughts long enough to
 accomplish any task I set before you.  If you are reading this message,
 then you have survived the two tests I arranged for you.  First, you
 have killed something, anything.  Second, you have had to outwit
 someone, anyone.  I am not at all convinced that you will succeed, but
 at least I feel confident now that you will not make me look like a
 complete fool to other tsars.
    Son, if you bring the magical Firebird back to me, you will inherit
 my tsardom and have your choice of a bride.  If you fail and return to
 me alive, you will marry a noblewoman of MY choice.  I think you have
 some idea of the group from which I will pick.  Happy hunting!

 Love, Dad"

>examine fellow
 Just as you suspected.  Your brother Dimitri is incognito, posing as
 your masseur.  He's wearing a fake mustache and a floppy hat.  If you
 thought his caricature looked peculiar, he looks like a complete
 goofball now.

>allergist
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine allergist
 You have been plagued by allergies all your life.  As a child your list
 of sensitivities was quite long, including feathers, fur, and eggs.
 Because this man has patiently administered to you an endless series of
 treatments, you can handle all of these things and live relatively
 normally.  You are still extremely sensitive to beeswax and to bee
 venom, facts you were perhaps reacquainted with recently.  [1] Your
 allergist is assuring you that you will soon notice a decrease in your
 symptoms.

>ask allergist about treatments
 I don't know the word "treatments".

>ask allergist about treatment
 "The 'sting of the bee' is a treatment of my own devise," the allergist
 patiently explains.  "You've received this treatment nine times three
 times already.  I'm surprised you need it explained again."

>note 1
 [1]: Beeswax is a compound commonly used in the manufacture of lipstick
 available in this area.  This kept you at quite a distance from your
 mother, who, being rather vain, insisted on wearing lipstick even after
 she was told that you were violently allergic to it.

>ask dimitri about dimitri
 "I don't know much about that."

>ask dimitri about firebird
 "I don't know much about that."

>ask dimitri about father
 "I don't know much about that."

>ask dimitri about mask
 "I don't know much about that."

>show mask to dimitri
 "Very funny!"  Dimitri looks a little embarrassed to see the mask.

>show letter to dimitri
 I don't know the word "letter".

>show message to dimitri
 You can't seem to attract Dimitri's attention by showing him the
 message from your father.

>ask dimitri about elena
 "I don't know much about that."

>ask dimitri about moustache
 I don't know the word "moustache".

>ask allergist for treatment
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>ask allergist about sting of bee
 There are words after your command that I couldn't use.

>ask allergist about sting
 "The 'sting of the bee' is a treatment of my own devise," the allergist
 patiently explains.  "You've received this treatment nine times three
 times already.  I'm surprised you need it explained again."

>ask allergist for treatment
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>ask allergist for sting
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>allergist, give treatment
 What do you want the allergist to give it to?

>me
 Your allergist prepares your arm and deftly pricks the needle in the
 proper place.  You think about how well he has cared for you over the
 years but do not bother to thank him once the procedure is over.

>thank allergist
 I don't know the word "thank".

>allergist, thank you
 I don't know the word "thank".

>high-five allergist
 I don't know the word "high-five".

>dimitri, give hat to me
 Dimitri doesn't seem able to process that last remark of yours.

>examine hat
 It looks like an ordinary floppy hat to me.

>I think we should visit the old man next?
 I don't know the word "think".

>go south
 The Opposite Sex
    This small glade is a favorite gathering place for your current set
 of groupies.  Although they are all attractive and of good families,
 you would rather impale yourself on a pike than marry one of them.
 Fortunately, none of them seem to be around at the moment.  The sight
 of "Dimitri" must have scared them away from this spot for a while.  To
 the north you can see an encampment of underlings; to the south, the
 primeval forest beckons.

>go south
 Fleeing Civilization
    You've reached the edge of this grand, untamed forest.  A short walk
 to the north are a collection of fawning underlings, waiting to make
 their daily petitions to you for your continued patronage.  The path
 leads south back into the forest.

>go south
 Deep in a Russian Forest, Under a Large Tree
    You are standing under a large tree.

>go south
 At the Path's Southwest Branch
    The forest primeval.  Branching off from the main north-south path
 is a small trail to the southwest.

>go southwest
 Deeper and Darker
    Scores of ancient trees with massive trunks and numberless gnarled
 branches prevent any light from reaching the forest floor.  A chill
 runs through you as you imagine every creature hidden in the shadows,
 one more threatening than the next.  You feel your way on a mulched
 path leading west.  You can return to the main path by walking
 northeast.

>go west
 An Immense Stone Wall
    The east-west path terminates at a large stone wall, which curves
 away to the northwest and southwest.
    You see a bronze plaque here.

>go northwest
 Trudging around the wall, which reveals itself to be a large but
 unbroken circle, you arrive at the only interesting locale to be found
 in this vicinity.

 A Future Flower Bed
    Someone seems to have been preparing a flower bed here, flush
 against the wall.  The planting has yet to be done.  It must have been
 a Herculean effort to dig:  all around you the ground is hard and quite
 rocky.  The wall curves around to the northeast and northwest.

>dig
 (the newly dug bed)
 (with the shovel)
 With amazing ease, you burrow through the loose earth and create a
 tunnel to the other side of the wall!  You find yourself in...

 A Lovely Garden
    You've made it under the immense stone wall.  Its walls surround you
 on all sides.  You can explore the garden by walking to the north or
 east.  Go down the tunnel to leave.

>go north
 A Burbling Fountain
    Once upon a time there was a fountain.  Its bubbling flow splashed
 onto the surface of the water below, creating little ripples that
 sparkled gaily in the sunlight.  Floating beneath the fountain were
 some lily pads...
    And sitting on a lily pad you find a frog.  You can't be sure, but
 you think you see something written on the frog's chest.

>read frog
 It says KISS ME.

>kiss frog
 Blech!  You've got to be kidding!

>get frog
 The frog's chest says KISS ME.  Maybe you should try a little
 tenderness first.

>examine pad
 Much flatter than a frog, but just as green.

>examine fountain
 The sound of the burbling water is most intriguing.

>drink water
 Better not.  Do you think a frog would drink out of your bath water?

 The frog mutely acknowledges your presence.

>kiss me
 You plant a big wet one on yourself.  Smack!

>pet frog
 I don't know the word "pet".

>ask frog about me
 The frog looks at you blankly.  Doctor Dolittle you're not.

>hug frog
 I don't know the word "hug".

>close eyes
 I don't know the word "eyes".

>wear mask
 Okay, you're now wearing the mask.  Boy, do you look like a loser.

>kiss frog
 Ugh!  You won't kiss a girl, but you'll kiss this frog?

>kiss frog
 Fine, fine, kiss the frog.

    You grasp the frog in your hands and bring it to your lips.  Gak!
 You even use your tongue!  You are shocked to discover that your kiss
 has transformed the frog into a heavily breathing man with a dangerous
 glint in his eye.

 Run!  It's a sledgehammer-wielding maniac!

 You feel the sweet, hot breath of your attacker on the back of your
 neck.

>go south

    You've made it under the immense stone wall.  Its walls surround you

 Keep moving!  Your head is within inches of a sledgehammer's blow!

>go east
 Within a Budding Grove
    Finally, trees that are easy to climb!  The bark is sturdy, the
 limbs low, the angle of ascent easy.  The blossoming trees are just
 past full bloom and the fruit is starting to emerge from the bud.

 Keep moving!  Your head is within inches of a sledgehammer's blow!

>climb tree
 First one branch, then another.  You're doing great.  Oops, lost your
 footing!  You tumble to the ground with a regal thud for the fourth
 time today.

 You feel the sweet, hot breath of your attacker on the back of your
 neck.

>go north
 You can't go that way.  Either walk west or climb up the tree.

 The sledgehammer comes down on your head.  Your last wish is that you
 would have had time to contemplate the irony of your fate.

 As you squirm down into the dark tunnel, you remember the stories your
 nurse told you when you were little:  vast empires hidden underground,
 always accessible by a tunnel such as this one, usually protected by a
 grate.  However, this is not the fantasy world of your youth, and in
 fact you emerge on the other side of the wall.

 If you're not so cocky, you might make it up this tree.

>climb tree

 careful movements, you find yourself...

 Sitting on a Lower Branch
    Ah, the sweet fragrance of a flowering fruit tree!  The perfume
 revives you as you rest on this branch.  You can now get a better look
 at those blossoms, but be careful.  Bees are buzzing all around them.
 You nervously remember how allergic you are to bee venom.  Perhaps you
 can escape the bees by climbing to a higher branch.

>examine blossoms
 The blossoms are yielding to a golden fruit.

>fruit
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine fruit
 Wow, you've never seen fruit give off such a warm glow.  You touch some
 of the nuggets and discover that the skin is hard and unyielding.  Even
 you, the horticulture imbecile, realize that unripe fruit is hard, but
 this stuff is really hard.  It's an actual 24K gold nugget!  You wonder
 if these trees might not also be gold apple variety and surmise that
 someone might have planted this orchard from the apples stolen from
 your father's trees.

>get fruit
 Taken.

>inventory
 You have a bow, a quiver, a mask (being worn), a comfy blanket, an
 ambiguous utensil, a mysteriously transformed fork, a shovel, a shield,
 a bucket, a sword, a message from your father, a sledgehammer, and a
 gold nugget.  The quiver seems to contain an arrow.

>go up
 Confident of the effects of your latest treatment, you evade the bees
 quietly and make your way up the tree.

 On a Higher Branch
    You have almost reached the top of the tree, certainly as high as
 you can climb.  Within your reach, there is a huge pile of twigs and
 leaves piled together precariously in the fork between two branches.
    Sitting on the large nest is a magazine.

>examine magazine
 It's the latest issue of "Pulchritudinous Pullet, The Magazine for
 Avian Elegance."

>read magazine
 It's nestled too far down in the twigs for you to see more than the
 cover.

    You find yourself lost in thought.  A soft rustle of leaves causes
 you to alert to your surroundings.  Looking up, you find that a large
 feathered creature has perched in the nest.

>get magazine
 You'll have to get into the nest in order to reach it.

>enter nest
 The Firebird gently warns you not to try to get into the nest.  It
 wasn't meant to support your weight.

>examine firebird
 It can only be the Firebird.  She doesn't look as if she would put up
 much of a struggle.  You imagine carrying her back to your father and
 making a hearty meal of her.  A plucked feather in each room of the
 palace would brightly light the space.  No more need of candles or
 torches.  Oh, and your father's tsardom to boot.  So many possibilities
 suggest themselves in thoughts of capturing the Firebird.

    "You are about to embark on a journey to the east," the Firebird
 explains, "but you do not have all the equipment you might need.  Would
 you like me to give you a list?"

>yes

    The Firebird quickly inventories your belongings and dictates to you
 a list of necessities.  You scribble them down and stow the list on
 your person.
    "Before you embark on your adventure, you will need to take along
 provisions," the Firebird counsels.  "Lead the way to the caterers,
 please!"

 The Firebird is whistling the greatest hits of Stravinsky.

    THINGS TO TAKE:

 ( ) a matchbook
 ( ) a coin

 Glancing over the list, you see you still need to pick up 2 things.

 The Firebird preens her feathers.

>go west
 Off the Beaten Path
    The warm light of a gently burning fire beckons to you from the
 east.  You pick out the outlines of a hut just beyond it.  Return to
 the forest path by walking west.

 The Firebird follows you.

>go south
 You can't go that way.  You can leave by going east or west.

 The Firebird buffs her polished talons with the tip of her wing

>go west
 A Light Beckons Through the Darkness
    The forest primeval.  The path continues north and south.  To the
 east you spy a light shining through the trees.

 The Firebird follows you.

>go south
 The Firebird stops and whispers to you, "Ivan, I cannot follow you into
 the clearing.  Vasilii is there.  If he sees me, he may kill you in
 order to claim my capture for himself.  Just have some sandwiches made;
 get anything you like. And have them send along some rice pudding.
 It's my favorite, and I haven't had it in so long."
    As you make your way south, the Firebird calls out after you, "Ivan,
 if you find anything on your list there, be sure to bring it back.  You
 might not want to go back again."

 A Catering Camp
    Sigh!  Everyday existence is so tiresome.  The regal catering
 service has readied a sumptuous feast for you here at the edge of the
 forest.  Dozens of gleaming silver chafing dishes await your
 inspection, but the smell of hot food sickens you.  A massive copper
 samovar holds freshly brewed coffee.  Golden serving pieces have been
 splendidly arrayed before you, but you know you could never be allowed
 to pick them up and serve yourself.  If only your station in life
 allowed you to pack a lunch.  A roast beef sandwich and a cup of coffee
 eaten alone in the woods would be ideal.  Ugh, those peasant serving
 girls.  So crass.  Always cracking their gum and calling you "Hon."
 You can turn north back into the forest.
    The caterer responds promptly to your request for provisions.  Too
 promptly really, because he whisks you to the table before you can say,
 "And don't assign me Flo..."

 Your Next Meal
    It's you, the food-service peasants, and a long wooden table.
    Your older brother Vasilii is here, busily cleaning the table.
 An older serving woman appears at your right elbow.  "I hear you
 actually bagged some game today.  What did you do, read it your own
 poetry until it coughed up its innards?"
    This is the caterer's most senior serving wench, Flo.  She's known
 you as long as the caterer has, and she never lets you forget it.  She
 has an opinion about everything you ever have or haven't done in your
 whole life.  You've wanted to send her away many a time for the beating
 you think she deserves as the impudent peasant she is, but your father
 has always forbidden it.  He thinks some honest criticism is good for
 you, and he's never been in disagreement with Flo's opinions.  Oh, it
 would be good to be tsar and take a switch to her.
    You keep your cool for now.  "Wench, I am embarking on a long
 journey.  I require these provisions:  two sandwiches, one roast beef
 on rye, one sprout and avocado on whole grain.  (You assume the
 Firebird is a vegetarian.)  Also, bring me some rice pudding."
    Flo raises an eyebrow.  "Rice pudding?  I have never known you to
 ask for rice pudding!"  she screeches.
    Vasilii pricks up his ears as he labors nearby.  "He's ALLERGIC to
 rice pudding," he thinks, eyeing you suspiciously.
    As insulting as Flo can be, she would never disobey you.  In a few
 minutes, Flo places some provisions into your hands.  As she leaves,
 she wishes you godspeed on your journey.

 The Opposite Sex
    This small glade is a favorite gathering place for your current set

 you would rather impale yourself on a pike than marry one of them.
 Fortunately, none of them seem to be around at the moment.  The sight
 of "Dimitri" must have scared them away from this spot for a while.  To
 the north you can see an encampment of underlings; to the south, the
 primeval forest beckons.

 The Firebird follows you.

>go north
 An Encampment of Underlings
    Some days more than a dozen men wait on you to offer their greetings
 and make their requests.  Thankfully, today there are only a few:
    You expect to see your masseur here, but instead there is an awfully
 goofy-looking fellow fooling with a floppy hat and fiddling with a fake
 mustache.
    Your allergist is here, reading the latest issue of "Pollen Parade."
    The page is lying in the grass, illiterate and blissful as he
 contemplates the sky.

 The page and the allergist stand and gawk at the sight of your
 companion, the Firebird.  Dimitri glances up briefly, but that is all
 the attention he seems willing or able to focus on the event.

 The Firebird is whistling the greatest hits of Stravinsky.

>examine it
 It's a small denomination copper coin.  Your dad's chin juts forward
 proudly in profile.  He looked just like that the other day when he was
 signing execution orders for a few dozen thieves.  Your dad really
 approaches his job with gusto, you must give him that!

 The Firebird preens her feathers.

 I don't know how to flip the coin.

 The Firebird buffs her polished talons with the tip of her wing

 Outside of an Inn
    You have arrived at a local hostelry and tavern known as the Cheese
 and Pig. How it ever got the name no one really knows, because they
 serve no cheese products and no pork products.  It's just vodka and
 manly conversation.  To the south is the way back to the encampment.
    You see a refuse pile here.
    A groom is here tending one of your horses.

 The Firebird follows you.

 Peasants parade in and out of the tavern.

 There's currently nothing on the refuse pile but rotting vegetables,
 empty bottles, and things too vile for close inspection.

 The Firebird notes with disgust that she has a chip in her talon

>search pile
 There's nothing on the refuse pile.

 The Firebird is whistling the greatest hits of Stravinsky.

 Peasants parade in and out of the tavern.  A pair of rustic fellows
 tumble out, each gnawing on a turnip.  One says to the other, "Have you
 heard this one?  Once a turnip said:  'I taste very good with honey.'
 'Go along, you boaster,' replied the honey, 'I taste good without
 you.'"  His friend claps him on the back and chuckles, "Ah, our amusing
 national anecdotes!"  They toss the turnip greens onto the refuse pile
 and disappear behind the inn.

>examine groom
 A rather rough young man, good with horses but not much of a
 conversationalist.

 The Firebird preens her feathers.

>examine flask
 Scrawled on a dirty label pasted to the flask are the words "l'eau de
 vie."  You know it from your French master's tutelage to be the word
 for "brandy."  This phrase translates literally as "the water of life."
 You doubt, however, that it is brandy.  In small print is the warning,
 which translated reads "for external use only."

 It looks like an ordinary bunch of turnip greens to me.

 Inspecting the inside of the inn is not worth getting a beating from
 that burly bunch.  Let the peasants have their fun in privacy.

 It's a sleek stallion, fast and powerful.  You notice something odd

 you."  You wonder what that must mean.

    THINGS TO TAKE:

 Glancing over the list, you see you still need to pick up 1 thing.

 The Firebird preens her feathers.

 Peasants parade in and out of the tavern.  A farmer tells his comrade a
 story.  "Two old beggars, husband and wife, were walking along a road
 and approached a village.  The old man said:  'I will ask for some
 milk.'  His wife answered:  'And I will crumb some bread into the
 milk.'  The man seized her and began to beat her, saying:  'Don't crumb
 bread into the milk, it will get sour; don't crumb bread into the milk,
 it will get sour.'  But when they came to the village no one gave them
 milk."
    The two farmers have a hearty laugh at the exploits of the beggars.
 [2] Their chortles are heard long after they disappear from sight
 behind the tavern.

 pleasant orange glow.
    "Hardly.  But it is luminescent.  Never poo-poo the practicality of
 a light source."

 "Ah, I imagine you now think you are ready to embark on a journey.  You
 are going in the right direction, but all the same you will never reach
 your destination."
    "Why not?"  you ask.
    "Because," the old man answers, "you must first pass three rivers.
 At each river is a ferry, and the price each ferryman asks is a great
 one; the first will strike off your right hand, the second your left
 foot, and the third your head."
    You gravely consider his words.  "A man can only die once," you
 decide; you thank him and prepare to begin your journey to the
 northeast.
    The old man stops you.  "You are brave and courteous and perhaps you
 will cross the three rivers.  If you do, go on straight to the east
 until you reach a high mountain, on which you will find the four
 palaces of Katschei the wizard.  If you are looking for something
 precious, it is very likely that he has stolen it."

 The Firebird is whistling the greatest hits of Stravinsky.

 Peasants parade in and out of the tavern.  Another two peasants
 approach the tavern, the one regaling the other with an anecdote:  "A
 peasant bought a quart of wine, drank it, and felt no effects.  He
 bought a pint, and still he was not drunk.  He drank a half-pint and
 became drunk.  Then he began to feel sorry for himself:  'Why did I buy
 the quart and the pint?  I should have bought the half-pint to begin
 with.  That would have done the job!'"  The other nearly chokes on a
 swig from his flask as he tries to control his amusement.  He deposits
 the flask onto the refuse pile and joins his brother in the tavern.

 bunch of turnip greens, and a white flask.  The quiver seems to contain
 an arrow.

 are written the words "l'eau de mort," which you translate as "the
 water of death." Like its sister flask, it warns you that it is for
 external use only.

 On the Way to the Inn
    You're on a path that links the encampment of underlings to the
 south with an inn to the north.

 The Firebird follows you.

>go south
 An Encampment of Underlings
    Some days more than a dozen men wait on you to offer their greetings
 and make their requests.  Thankfully, today there are only a few:
    You expect to see your masseur here, but instead there is an awfully
 goofy-looking fellow fooling with a floppy hat and fiddling with a fake
 mustache.
    Your allergist is here, reading the latest issue of "Pollen Parade."
    The page is lying in the grass, illiterate and blissful as he
 contemplates the sky.

 The page and the allergist stand and gawk at the sight of your
 companion, the Firebird.  Dimitri glances up briefly, but that is all
 the attention he seems willing or able to focus on the event.

>go south
 The Opposite Sex
    This small glade is a favorite gathering place for your current set
 of groupies.  Although they are all attractive and of good families,
 you would rather impale yourself on a pike than marry one of them.
 Fortunately, none of them seem to be around at the moment.  The sight
 of "Dimitri" must have scared them away from this spot for a while.  To
 the north you can see an encampment of underlings; to the south, the
 primeval forest beckons.

 The Firebird follows you.

>go south
 Fleeing Civilization
    You've reached the edge of this grand, untamed forest.  A short walk
 to the north are a collection of fawning underlings, waiting to make
 their daily petitions to you for your continued patronage.  The path
 leads south back into the forest.

 The Firebird follows you.

>go south

    You are standing under a large tree.

 is a small trail to the southwest.

    "This is where we part company for now, young man."
    You're astonished.  "But I thought you were going to show me who was
 stealing my father's golden apples!"
    "You'll figure that out.  You don't need me tagging along.  You'll
 just need your own good sense," she plucks out a long tail feather,
 "and one of my feathers."
    "Is it magical?"  you ask as you examine it.  It gives off a
 pleasant orange glow.
    "Hardly.  But it is luminescent.  Never poo-poo the practicality of
 a light source."
    You skeptically look first at the feather, then at the Firebird.  "I
 have no idea what I'm going off to find, you know," you protest.
    "I know."  The Firebird smiles at you with great confidence.  "We'll
 meet up again later.  Until then, have faith in yourself and in those
 who offer help along the way."  She gives you a peck on the cheek and
 takes flight out of sight.

 For better or worse, you plunge into the deep, dark forest alone.

 Darker and Deeper
    The forest primeval.  A mulched path leads northeast.  Return to the
 north-south path by walking west.
    Your feather illumines the face of the wizened old man sitting here.
 "Ah, I imagine you now think you are ready to embark on a journey.  You
 are going in the right direction, but all the same you will never reach
 your destination."
    "Why not?"  you ask.
    "Because," the old man answers, "you must first pass three rivers.
 At each river is a ferry, and the price each ferryman asks is a great
 one; the first will strike off your right hand, the second your left
 foot, and the third your head."
    You gravely consider his words.  "A man can only die once," you
 decide; you thank him and prepare to begin your journey to the
 northeast.
    The old man stops you.  "You are brave and courteous and perhaps you
 will cross the three rivers.  If you do, go on straight to the east
 until you reach a high mountain, on which you will find the four
 palaces of Katschei the wizard.  If you are looking for something
 precious, it is very likely that he has stolen it."

>go east
 You can't go that way.  The old man redirects you.  "Go west or
 northeast," he says.

 Before you go any further, you consider saying a prayer to preserve
 your salvation against the perils ahead.

 On the West Bank of the First River
    You've reached the first of three rivers.  A small ferry is tied to
 a rickety dock.  The path back to the familiar and known is to the
 west.
    A ferryman waits here for his next passenger.
    "I'm not his next passenger," you think, "more likely, his next
 victim."
    The man is menacingly huge:  he carries a sword at his side and is
 clad all in copper armor.  He glares at you with one big eye in the
 center of his forehead.

>examine man
 He's a big, menacing cyclops.

>ask man about boat
 "You want to ride, you pay the fare.  That's all we need to talk
 about," says the ferryman through a grimace.

>ask man about fare
 "You want to ride, you pay the fare.  That's all we need to talk
 about," says the ferryman through a grimace.

>pay fare
 By the ferryman's code of conduct, he should have to ferry you across
 the river before demanding any payment.

>enter boat
    You demand that the ferryman take you across the river.
    "Will you pay me my price?"  asks the huge ferryman.
    "Time enough to talk of price when you have done me your service,"
 you reply.

 The ferryman pushes off from shore with his giant stick.  He gives you
 a disgusted look as he makes powerful movements that set the ferry
 gliding across the river.

>swim
 What do you want to swim?

>in water
 Which water do you mean, the water of life, or the water of death?

>swim river
 The ferryman blocks you before you can dive into the river.  "Oh, no
 you don't, bub," he growls.  "Union rules say you have to use the
 ferry.  And if you think I'M unpleasant, you should see my union boss!"

 You ignore the ferryman's menacing glance as you gaze out at the river
 and plan a strategy for when you land.  You notice that the ferryman
 keeps glancing at the coin you're carrying.  He seems to be fascinated
 by it.

>examine coin
 It's a small denomination copper coin.  Your dad's chin juts forward
 proudly in profile.  He looked just like that the other day when he was
 signing execution orders for a few dozen thieves.  Your dad really
 approaches his job with gusto, you must give him that!

 The ferryman brings the boat up to a dock on the other side of the
 river.  You both disembark from the craft, and he demands payment.
 Your Plan A (escape) seems to have been foiled:  the ferryman's
 vigilant eye monitors your every move.
    You ask nonchalantly, "What is there to pay?"
    "Stretch forth your right hand," growls the ferryman as he draws his
 sword.

 On the East Bank of the First River
    You're on the east side of the first river.  To the east is further
 adventure.

>show coin to man
 You show the coin to the ferryman, who salivates at the sight of it.
 "You wouldn't be willing to part with that, would you?"  he asks.

>hold coin
 I don't know the word "hold".

>put coin in hand
 Which hand do you mean, your right hand, or your left hand?

>right
 You can't put anything into your right hand.

>go north
 You can't go that way.  A path leads east; the river lies to the west.

>go east
 The ferryman spies you with his one eye.  You're not going anywhere
 until you pay your fare.

>hold out right hand
 I don't know the word "hold".

>stretch out right hand
 I don't know the word "stretch".

>stretch forth right hand
 I don't know the word "stretch".

 The ferryman raises his sword and very happily brings it down upon your
 right hand.  He picks up the hand and eats it with relish.

 close inspection.  He's hypnotized by the copper in the thing and
 appears to be distracted for now.

>attack man with sword
 You whip out your own blade and smote the ferryman with a blow that
 cleaves through the copper plates of his armor.  He topples to the
 ground at your feet.

 He's a dead man, taking up gigantic amounts of horizontal rather than
 vertical space.  He may still be carrying some of your stuff.

 On the West Bank of the Second River
    You've reached the second of three rivers.  A large ferry is tied to
 a rickety dock.  The path back to the first river is to the west.
    Here is a second ferryman, lying in wait for his next fare.  Even
 more gigantic than the first man, he is armed with an even larger
 sword.  His silver armor protects him as he stares you down with two
 big eyes.

>go east
 Ferrymen's Union rules dictate that you use the ferry to take you
 across the river.

>ask man about ferry
 "You want to ride, you pay the fare.  That's all we need to talk
 about," says the ferryman through a grimace.

>go north
 You can't go that way.  Travel either by walking west or getting on the
 ferry.

>enter ferry
    You demand that the ferryman take you across the river.
    "Will you pay me my price?"  asks the huge ferryman.
    "Time enough to talk of price when you have done me your service,"
 you reply.

 The ferryman pushes off from shore with his giant stick.  He gives you
 a disgusted look as he makes powerful movements that set the ferry
 gliding across the river.

 adventure.

>give left foot to man
 The ferryman raises his sword and very happily brings it down upon your

 Get it?  ONE FOOT!"  Just what YOU need right now, a punster.

 instead.  "Now that is something worth looking at!"

 You show the ambiguous utensil to the ferryman, who salivates at the
 sight of it.  "You wouldn't be willing to part with that, would you?"
 he asks.

 The ferryman easily deflects your blow, just missing your left foot in
 the process.  If only you could distract that one roving eye...

 I don't know the word "eye".

 white flask, a black flask, a matchbook, a feather (providing light),
 and a coin.  The quiver seems to contain an arrow.

>examine eye
 I don't know the word "eye".

>give coin to man
 Taking advantage of the ferryman's distraction, you pass the coin to
 him, whispering soothingly, "This has silver on it too."  Mesmerized,
 the ferryman seizes the coin and searches for signs of silver anywhere
 on the thing.  You seem to have succeeded in distracting another of the
 ferryman's eyes.

>attack man

 On the West Bank of the Third River
    You've reached the third of three rivers.  A huge ferry is tied to a
 rickety dock.  The path back to the second river is to the west.
    A third ferryman is here, a wild man, as tall as a giant and as
 thick as a haystack, with a shield, helmet, and breastplate all of
 gold, and with an oak club in his hand.  Behind the wisps of thinning
 hair on his forehead, you glimpse a third eye, which is most certainly
 focused right on you.

>ask man about ferry
 "You want to ride, you pay the fare.  That's all we need to talk
 about," says the ferryman through a grimace.

 He's an immense, club-wielding triclops!

>show nugget to man
 You really should let him ferry you across the river before you give
 him anything.

 The ferryman brings the boat up to a dock on the other side of the
 river.  You both disembark from the craft, and he demands payment.
 Your Plan A (escape) seems to have been foiled:  the ferryman's
 vigilant eyes monitor your every move.
    You ask nonchalantly, "What is there to pay?"
    "Stretch forth your neck," growls the ferryman as he brandishes his
 oak club.

 On the East Bank of the Third River
    You're on the east side of the third river.  To the east is further

>show nugget to man
 You show the gold nugget to the ferryman, who salivates at the sight of
 it.  "You wouldn't be willing to part with that, would you?"  he asks.

>give nugget to man
 You offer the gold nugget to the ferryman, who greedily takes it for
 his own close inspection.  He's hypnotized by the gold in the thing and
 appears to be distracted for now.

>give utensil to man
 Taking advantage of the ferryman's distraction, you pass the ambiguous
 utensil to him, whispering soothingly, "This has gold on it too."

    You are beyond the three rivers.  To the east is further adventure;
 to the west is the bank of the third river.

>go east
 On the Road Across the Open Steppe
    You've left the forest and rivers behind you to the west.  The
 wilderness of the Russian steppe spreads out in all directions ahead of
 you.  White winter wheat waves gracefully as the wind sweeps over the
 open land.  A dirt road wends its way from east to west.  At the east
 end of the road you see a mountain.
    Your eyes discern a faint animal trail to the north.

    You feel a sharp prick in your back and turn to find your brother
 Vasilii armed to the teeth with kitchen knives and ready to attack.
 You unsuccessfully try to hide the Firebird's feather.  "That's it!  I
 just knew that the Firebird was with you.  Where is she?  Where is she
 hiding?"  The tip of a knife blade grazes one of your ribs.  "No
 matter.  I'll have time to look for her after I've finished with you.
 The tsardom is going to be mine, Ivan -- over your dead body!"  He
 laughs wildly.  "Get ready to taste cold kitchen cutlery, brother
 mine!"

 I don't know the word "taste".

>go north
 In the Wilderness
    You are wandering in the wilderness, having only faint animal trails

 You attempt to escape from your murderous brother.  He stays right on

>note 3
 [3]: Getting lost?  I don't see why.  You read trails quite well.

>read trail
 You study the trail for a moment.  It says, "Always take the trails in
 a northerly direction to find the ocean, a southerly direction to find
 the steppe.  If you find yourself in a place where the air smells salty
 and the only exit is southeast, go se, s, e, n, and nw to find the
 ocean.  If you're in a salty-smelling place and the only exit is
 southwest, go sw, s, w, n, nw to find the ocean."  Yes, you read trails
 VERY well.

>hit brother with sledgehammer
 "Boy, this sledgehammer is unwieldy," you think.  "You would have to be
 a maniac not to notice how heavy and clumsy it is."  You lay it aside
 before Vasilii can see how unsuccessfully you use this weapon.  Vasilii
 raises a butcher knife.  You raise your shield and deflect the blow.
 The butcher's knife is loosed from his hand and disappears.Vasilii
 takes an experimental jab at you with a large kitchen knife.

 by your lack of response, Vasilii lunges at you with his knife, and
 skewers you through the heart.

 Dead, Dead, Dead

 *** Having died, you have lost your place in the royal succession.  ***

 Vasilii doesn't dance for long.  He soon sets to searching through your
 belongings, taking every weapon and every scrap of food you have.  He
 takes your mysteriously transformed fork and puts it in the road
 leading to the mountain.  The fork sizzles and sparks, then explodes
 into a shimmering doorway.  Vasilii passes through the doorway and
 emerges through an identical door that has appeared just outside of the
 forest.  Using the Firebird's feather to light his way, he plunges into
 the forest to hunt her down.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 Vasilii dashes through the forest, headed for the great stone wall
 where he last saw the Firebird.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 Vasilii finds the hole you dug under the wall and scrambles through it
 to the other side.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 Vasilii stops for a moment by the pond and makes a picnic lunch out of
 the food he stole from you.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 Vasilii explores the orchard.  He speedily climbs a tree, snatches as
 many fruit nuggets as he can find, and clambers up into the Firebird's
 nest.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 The Firebird's nest does not support Vasilii's weight.  He crashes to
 the ground, bringing the nest down with him.  He is lucky to sustain
 only a sprained ankle.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 Vasilii limps back out of the orchard and through the tunnel.  He is
 headed out of the forest to the north.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 Vasilii arrives at the encampment.  The allergist tends to Vasilii's
 injuries as best as he can.  Vasilii cannot capture Dimitri's attention
 long enough to tell him that you are dead.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 Vasilii is back in the forest again, moving a bit slower, but still
 alert to signs of the Firebird.

>wait

 Good move.  In fact, your only move, since you're dead.

 Vasilii spies the Firebird in a tree.  He flushes her out and
 slaughters her.

 Vasilii drags the Firebird back to your father, demanding the tsardom
 as his own.  When your father learns that Vasilii killed you and used
 what you had accomplished to claim the Firebird for himself, he refuses
 to grant Vasilii his tsardom and sends your brother back into servitude
 with the caterer.  Disgruntled and bitter, your brother trains an army
 of food-service workers as soldiers and uses them as cannon fodder in a
 successful overthrow of the tsardom.


                    -- THE END --

 In a total of 385 turns, you have achieved a score of 27 points out of
 a possible 72.

    Unless you really liked the ending of "Hamlet," this is not a
 satisfactory finale:  You're dead, the Firebird's dead, your father's
 dead, your brother reigns after a violent overthrow of the tsardom.
 Here's a hint:  don't give your brother a reason to kill you.  Don't
 give him anything, don't be the first one to strike a blow, and keep
 moving until he calms down.
    Alternatively, you could just kill Vasilii.  What bright future do
 you expect for him anyway?

 You study the trail for a moment.  It says, "Always take the trails in
 a northerly direction to find the ocean, a southerly direction to find
 the steppe.  If you find yourself in a place where the air smells salty
 and the only exit is southeast, go se, s, e, n, and nw to find the

    You see a pike here.

 Your brother Vasilii follows you.

>examine pike
 You often say that you'd rather impale yourself on a pike than be
 forced to do any of a number of disagreeable things.  What you have
 here is not that kind of pike.  Instead, it's a rather dull, squishy
 fish, not a sharp, pointed stick.  Its little gills and mouth are
 vainly struggling to extract some oxygen from the air.

>get pike
 Taken.

>put pike in ocean
 You throw the pike back into the water.  The wealth of oceanic soluble
 oxygen revives the poor thing.  It leaps out of the water in a display
 of piscine gratitude and swims off into deeper waters.

 On the Road Across the Open Steppe
    You've left the forest and rivers behind you to the west.  The
 wilderness of the Russian steppe spreads out in all directions ahead of
 you.  White winter wheat waves gracefully as the wind sweeps over the

 Slowly and carefully you claw your way up the mountain.  You clamber at

 feet above the slot.

>examine device
 A blue glass dome a few inches in diameter.  It seems to be mounted to
 the door by a casing that surrounds it and is screwed into a socket in
 the door.

>unscrew dome
 You give a slight turn to the casing.  At once a blinding blue light
 floods your body.  You feel every last piece of you begin to vibrate
 and shake loose from the adjacent piece.  You quickly lose
 consciousness.  When you come to yourself again, you find you are back
 at the road to the Cheese and Pig Inn.  It seems as if you were
 disassembled down to your elemental constituents and reassembled here.
 Something seems to have gone wrong with the process, however, because
 you are now missing your right hand.

 a black flask, a matchbook, a feather (providing light), a gold nugget,
 an ambiguous utensil, a coin, and four iron claws.  The quiver seems to
 contain an arrow.

 loose from its adjacent piece.  You quickly lose consciousness.  When
 you come to yourself again, you find you have been transported into...

 Inside the Copper Palace
    You are in the great hall, a high-ceilinged space that some might
 use for feasting and celebrating; however, the wizard Katschei has
 chosen instead to use it for hoarding a store of treasure.  Copper
 cooking vessels and bags of copper coins are heaped everywhere.  Some
 of the pots have been polished clean; the rest are a tarnished green.
    You notice movement among the piles of copper vessels.  As you
 prepare to draw a weapon and confront Katschei, you are surprised to
 find that it is instead a bird in camouflage.  But not entirely a bird.
 Instead of wings, the creature has the arms of a woman.  She is hard at
 work using her human arms and hands to polish the tarnished copper.
 Why don't you try to catch her attention by saying "bird, hello"?

 *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***

>examine bird
 A large creature just short of your height.  It is birdlike, with
 coppery feathers, but it has graceful female arms where wings would be.

>bird, hello
 The bird appears intrigued by the mask's face and studies Dimitri
 sympathetically (a unique reaction in your experience).  You see that
 she is timid, however, and will not answer you as long as she cannot
 tell who you really are.  You take off the mask.
    "Hello, sir," she replies demurely, "you are not my master the
 wizard."  You introduce yourself politely and tell her that you are
 looking for her master.  "He is not here today," she whispers and goes
 back to her work.  You sense that she would like to tell you more, but
 her shyness keeps her silent.  There are so many things you want to ask
 her about:  her imprisonment, her work, the Firebird, the wizard
 Katschei [4], but you will have to draw her out in conversation to
 learn more.

>note 4
 [4]: Engage her in further conversation by asking her questions in the
 form "ask bird about ..."

>ask bird about firebird
 "The Firebird brings me more copper to polish."  She hands you a small
 copper pot.  "She said that, if you ever came to visit me, I should
 give you this."

>examine pot
 A censer, also known as a thurible, is a squat domed vessel used for
 burning incense.  You remember the priest swinging a censer towards the
 altar during the liturgy, using the smoke as a visual metaphor for
 prayer:  both rise heavenward to God.  Its copper clad exterior is
 newly polished.  There are decorative holes cut in the metal to let the
 smoke escape.  The inside of the pot is sooty and fragrant from
 previous burnings.
    Usually there is a chain attached to a censer, but this one has
 none.

 The coppery bird overcomes her shyness momentarily to tell you,
 unprompted, of her history:  "I am a tsar's daughter.  On the day I was
 to be wed, a terrible black cloud descended down from this mountain.
 Katschei stepped out of the cloud and demanded that my father give me
 to him.  When my father refused, Katschei slew him, all my kinsmen, and
 the groom.  No attack seemed to hurt him at all.  Katschei swept me
 away in the cloud and brought me to a palace made entirely of pearl.  I
 stayed there a week, and he was there all the while."  She trembled as
 she remembered it.  "At the end of the week, he said that I was not
 worthy to stay with him in the pearl palace.  He brought me to this
 place, imprisoned me in this horrible form, and put me to work as his
 servant.  He comes to visit me one day every year and punishes me if I
 haven't polished enough pieces."

    Your continued presence is making the coppery bird nervous.  "I
 appreciate your company," she says, "but I should not be distracted
 from my work.  The Firebird says you may be able to free me from this
 captivity.  Please go on your way, sir, and do your best."  She starts
 to push you back outside through the mail slot.  Before you can protest
 that you are much too large to fit, your regal butt is tumbling to the
 ground on the other side of the door.

>look

 black tarnish.

>put utensil in slot
 The ambiguous utensil drops into the slot.  A flickering blue glow
 issues from the glass dome.  The glow soon strengthens to a blinding
 azure beam that floods your body.  You feel every bit of your being
 vibrate and shake loose from its adjacent piece.  You quickly lose
 consciousness.  When you come to yourself again, you find you have been
 transported into...

 Inside the Silver Palace
    You have been transported to the counting house of the palace.  Bags
 of coins and boxes of silver eating utensils are stacked neatly over
 all the available floor space.
    Sitting atop a high stool is a bird with silver feathers.  At first
 you think that the bird is sitting on a woman, but upon closer
 inspection you see that the woman's bare legs and feet belong to the
 bird.  With one foot, the bird is picking up loose coins and utensils
 with her toes and placing them in boxes or bags.  The other foot is
 keeping count of the treasure on a large abacus.
    "State your business!"  the bird demands, never once taking her eyes
 off her work.
    "I am Ivan, the son of a tsar.  I have come to find Katschei the
 wizard, because he has wronged my father."
    "Join the club, hon!"  she snorts.  "Katschei wronged my father's
 whole tsardom into oblivion on the day he captured me."  She continues
 her counting.  You are hypnotized by her nimble feet, and the two of
 you fall silent.  You muse to yourself about her manner:  "She's gruff
 all right, but I don't sense any malice from her.  An efficient woman
 of good will.  Even that 'hon' sounds all right coming from her."
    She looks up at you expectantly.  Better pick up the conversational
 thread with a few questions.  [5]

 *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***

>note 5
 [5]: Try the conversational openers that were effective in the copper
 palace.

>ask bird about Katschei
 "Don't fool around with Katschei if you can avoid it.  The soldiers of
 my father's tsardom tried every weapon against him, and he came away
 from the battle completely unscathed.  Wish I could say the same for my
 father's people."

>ask bird about firebird
 "The Firebird supplies me with more inventory each week.  Keep your
 hands off it, okay?  Oh, she did say you could have this."  She tosses
 you a length of silver chain.

>ask bird about work
 "What you see is what I do!  I count this stuff and keep the books!"

 The silvery bird is a little impatient for you to ask more about her,
 so she launches into her life story before you can even ask her:
 "Katschei came down off this mountain one day and brought me back with
 him to a palace made of pearl.  After staying with him a month there,
 he grew tired of me and locked me up in this place.  He turned me into
 a bird, all except for my legs, and gave me this stupid job.  Do I look
 like an accountant to you?  And these feet were not meant for work like
 this.  What a humiliation!  Even worse, he visits once a month to check
 up on the books.  He gives me grief if the ledgers aren't neat.  How
 does he expect me to keep books writing with my feet?"  She makes an
 illegible mark in her records with a quill pen.

    "Okay, enough already," the silver bird says as she alights from her
 stool.  "I gave you what the Firebird asked.  Get going, hero.  If you
 can get me out of here, great!"  She gives you a peck on the cheek and
 kicks you back out of the slot in the door and into the dirt outside
 the palace.  How did she do that?

>examine chain
 A length of silver chain about as long as your armspan.

>put chain on pot
 You hook the chain to either side of the censer to make a little swing.

 The gold nugget drops into the slot.  A flickering blue glow issues
 from the glass dome.  The glow soon strengthens to a blinding azure
 beam that floods your body.  You feel every bit of your being vibrate
 and shake loose from its adjacent piece.  You quickly lose
 consciousness.  When you come to yourself again, you find you have been
 transported into...

 Inside the Golden Palace
    You are in the library of the palace.  Books with pages edged with
 gold leaf are standing spine-in on the shelves, creating a blaze of
 gold, row by row.  The furniture, the candlelabras, the walls
 themselves, all of gold.
    The Firebird suddenly swoops down into the room from a skylight high
 above you in this vaulted chamber.  "Well, my boy," she says as she
 settles down on a perch, "you traveled swiftly and arrived here ahead
 of me.  I trust you have met the two captive birds in the other
 palaces.  I'm sure you have many questions for me:  about my capture,
 about me, about Katschei...ask away."

 *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***

>ask firebird about capture
 "I was nursing you one day when you were only a few weeks old...  "
    Your eyes widen in surprise at this unexpected preface to her tale.
    "A storm had blown up quickly, and a bolt of lightning struck the
 castle just outside the window to my bedchamber.  I covered myself and
 you to protect you from the loud crash of thunder, and when I looked
 up, a dark gigantic figure was perched on the windowsill.  It was
 Katschei.  He had ridden that thunderbolt into my chamber.  He seized
 me, and was about to jump out the window with both of us.  I had only a
 moment to act, and in that moment I threw you out of his grasp and onto
 a pile of blankets on the bed.  In an instant, he swept me away in a
 cloud.  The last thing I heard were your cries and screams."
    "Were you my wet nurse?"  you ask.
    "No, I was...I am...your mother."
    "But I was not a motherless child," you protest in confusion.
    "To keep peace in the tsardom, your father brought in another woman
 to take my place in secret.  But I am your mother.  Truly."  A tear
 forms in the corner of her eye.  "After Katschei had transformed me
 into a firebird, he made me his thief:  I was sent to steal for him all
 the copper and silver and gold and pearl that nine times nine tsardoms
 possessed.  I have been very busy all these years.  As much as I could,
 I visited your father's garden, in hope that he would start sending you
 boys out to capture me.  Dimitri was soon old enough to be given the
 task.  But I wouldn't be found so easily by him, or by Vasilii.
 Although I love them, I wanted you to be the one to rescue me.  Because
 so much has been taken from you, I wanted much to be given to you in
 return for your years of suffering."

>brood
 You lose yourself momentarily in moody and morbid meditation.

>ask firebird about katschei
 "There is no way to kill him by conventional means.  His soul is not in
 his body.  Where his soul is hidden is his closely held secret.  I have
 never been able to find it out.  He lives in the pearl palace, a place
 I am not allowed to visit anymore.  If he has imprisoned a woman there,
 perhaps she has been able to find out his secret.
    "It is imperative that you gain entry to the pearl palace.  You must
 find a way to put the creature that guards the palace to sleep."  She
 surveys your inventory.  She says, "Hmm.  You seem to have everything
 you need to carry out the task, except for this most important
 component."
    "Use these properly, and the serpent will soon be fast asleep.  Make
 a mistake, and yours will be the sleep of the dead."  The Firebird
 hands you three bunches of fragrant medicinal herbs.

>ask firebird about herbs
 You won't glean much information asking the Firebird about the loose
 medicinal herbs.

 The Firebird starts to usher you slowly out of the room.  "Those are
 all the answers I have for now, dear."  She pushes you toward the slot
 in the door.  "Time for action, not reflection."  You slide through the
 narrow slot and find yourself outside the golden palace.

    The woods open out into a wide meadow.  The breeze barely ruffles
 the tips of the long grass.  You are bathed in the luminous glow of the
 structure that sits at the center of the meadow:  could the entire
 palace be built of pearl?  Encircling the palace's foundation is the
 creature of which the Firebird spoke.

 In a Pearly Ante Chamber
    The walls, the ceiling, and nearly all the objects in the room are
 covered in row upon row of perfectly round, white pearls.  It is a
 monochromatic, pixellated visual nightmare.  The only architectural
 features that relieve the monotony are at the far end of the room:  a
 door frame and doorknob covered in black pearls.
    The room's single occupant takes you out of the nightmare and into a
 dream.  A young woman is here, as beautiful to you as Venus emerging
 out of the ocean from an oyster.  Out of the hundreds of thousands of
 pearls in this room, she is indeed the only one of great price.  Her
 loveliness has made you speechless. She is also silent at first,
 studying you intently.  "I do not know who you are, sir, but you must
 be very clever and very brave to have made your way to my chamber.
 What is your name?"  she asks.
    "Ivan," you almost whisper, still taking her in.
    "I am Pearl," she laughs.  "That is the name Katschei gave me.  I
 don't know what my parents called me."
    "Then Katschei brought you here when you were very young?"
    "As an infant, I imagine.  I do not know a time when I was not
 here."
    "Then how do you know he is not your father?"
    "Because he has always boasted that he took me from a tsar and a
 tsarina.  The only child they ever had, he says.  He claims that he was
 a suitor to my mother, but she rejected him, so many years later he
 stole me to be raised as his bride."
    "Did he raise you himself?"
    "Oh, no.  There were many nurses and governesses and tutors here
 when I was a child.  But as the days grow closer to our wedding, he has
 been guarding me very closely, and no one is here except him and his
 knights."  She motions toward the door leading further into the palace.
 You both hear the gruff laughter of battle-toughened men.  "He raised
 me to be his ideal bride, but I think he did a very poor job.  I cannot
 abide him."
    Seeing her gentleness you have no trouble believing this.  You press
 on to a more curious subject.  "Is Katschei a bird?  Does he want a
 bird bride?"  You have only recently noticed her wings and lower body
 are that of a bird.
    "This is a recent transfiguration.  He placed me in this form to
 make me undesirable to any man who might try to steal me from him."
    "Once again, he did a poor job."  She turns her eyes away modestly
 from you and your amorous words.
    "If you do wish to spoil his wedding plans, I will tell you another
 of Katschei's failings."
    "Please do tell me."
    "He chose to confide in me the secret of his immortality and
 strength."
    "Is this the secret of where his soul is kept?"
    "Yes.  How do you know so much already?"
    You tell her about the Firebird and the other two captive birds and
 what they have revealed to you.
    "It is all true.  His body is imperishable.  His soul is in an egg,
 a quite well-hidden egg.  The egg is in a duck, and the duck is in a
 hare, and the hare nests in a great hollow log that floats in a pond in
 a forest of the island Bouyan.  I wish I could tell you where to find
 the island, but I do not know that."
    "Very curiously hidden.  And say I retrieved the egg.  Would simply
 breaking it destroy Katschei?"
    "Yes, but it must be broken in his sight.  You must find the egg and
 return. Katschei is very likely to be here feasting with his knights.
 You may have to fight the knights to reach him, so be sure to come
 ready for battle."
    "I will do as you say, as swiftly as I can."
    "Please do be swift.  The wedding is approaching very quickly."  She
 shows you her wedding gown, which she is decorating very delicately
 with pearls.  You wonder aloud how she can do it at all with those
 wings.  "With much difficulty," she answers with a smile.
    You resolve aloud to return with the egg as soon as you can.  In
 your own thoughts you swear very solemnly not to let Katschei touch
 this unspoiled beauty.

 "So, what happened up there?"  Vasilii asks.  For a moment, you can
 think only of the wonderful Pearl, and your eyes glaze a bit.  Then you
 notice your brother getting impatient, and you relate the news about
 Katschei, the egg, and the horde of knights with whom you will have to
 do battle.
    "Battle, eh?  Horde of knights, eh?"  Vasilii looks thoughtful.
 "Sounds like you'll need help.  Except I won't be much use right now --
 I ditched all my kitchen knives...  I know!  There are some guys I
 worked with who'll be perfect!  You'll see!  I'll have them here by the
 time you get back with that egg!"
    With that, he sprints off and is gone before you can say another
 word.  You wonder who he could possibly have in mind -- Vasilii never
 worked with any of your father's knights, and while Flo's sarcasm can
 be withering, you doubt she'd be much good in a fight.

 On the Road Across the Open Steppe
    You've left the forest and rivers behind you to the west.  The
 wilderness of the Russian steppe spreads out in all directions ahead of
 you.  White winter wheat waves gracefully as the wind sweeps over the

 him to get at the vines.  As you work, you notice that the bird has
 calmed.  As the last vine is removed, the hawk bursts out of the
 thicket into flight.  His thankful call is the last evidence of the
 hawk as he disappears into the skies.

 A Pond in the Clearing
    You have come upon a pond nestled in a forest clearing.  The air is
 still.  The water makes no sound.  The trees lining the pond are
 particularly large, their massive roots plunging into the pond at the
 water's edge.  You can walk around the pond by going northeast or
 northwest.
    The pond seems to contain a log.


>put otter in pond
 You toss the otter into the pond.  The poor otter jumps a foot out of
 the pond, lets out a shriek, and lands back in your arms.  You test the
 water with your finger and find that the water is highly acidic.  Just
 acidic, no, that's an understatement.  It BURNS!  Sorry, otter friend.

 That couldn't possibly be of use to the otter.


>pour water of life in the pond

 The duck is about to fly just out of your sight over the ocean, when
 you see your hawk friend dart after it into the sky and seize it.  The
 duck lays an egg, which falls into the ocean.  You run to the edge of
 the cove to search the ocean.


>search ocean

 You scan the ocean for any sign of the egg.  You wade out into the
 surf, but find nothing.

 Suddenly you feel a tug on your pant leg.  You look down and find that
 the pike you saved so long ago has now returned to help you.  He holds
 the egg in his mouth.  You gently take it from him, and he dives back
 into the sea.

>go east

 True to his word, Vasilii has returned with help:  a dozen strong,
 stalwart...  teppanyaki chefs???  You've met them before; your father
 hired them recently in a cooking exchange program with Japan.  While
 their skill at juggling knives, pepper mills, and other cooking
 implements is certainly dazzling to behold, you have serious doubts
 about their ability to do any damage to anything that isn't sitting
 motionless on a grill.
    The chefs all stand at attention as you approach, and Vasilii beams
 with pride.  "See?  What did I tell you?  With these guys on your side,
 you can't lose!"
    You suppress a sudden urge to rant.  "Vasilii?  A word with you,
 please?"
    "What?  I know, the sushi knives are a bit much, but they wouldn't
 leave without them."  He notices your look.  "All right, all right!  I
 know what you're thinking, but I'm serious!  You haven't seen them
 train!  There's nothing like it!"
    "Vasilii," you explain patiently, "they're CHEFS.  They prepare
 FOOD.  I mean, what are they going to do--grind pepper into the
 knights' eyes to blind them, then carve them into neat little filets
 and serve them with a spicy ginger sauce?"
    You hadn't realized the chefs were listening, but there is a sudden
 flurry of conversation among them.  One steps forward.  "An excellent
 strategy, koutaishi-sama," he proclaims in a thick Japanese accent.
 "With you leading us, we must be victory!"
    You try not to roll your eyes as you put on your best
 glorious-leader expression.  You still have your doubts, but
 maybe--just maybe--these teppanyaki chefs will be up to the job.  "All
 right, everyone," you announce loudly, "we've got a wizard to kill.
 Let's go!"
    With a cheer from Vasilii and a loud "BANZAI!"  from the chefs, they
 all ready their climbing gear and in moments are ready to depart.

 At the Base of the Mountain
    The east-west road ends at the base of the mountain.  It is so high
 that its top is propped against the sky.  You can scarcely lift your
 eyes to its summit. You can travel around the base by walking to the

 climb over him.

    The walls, the ceiling, and nearly all the objects in the room are
 covered in row upon row of perfectly round, white pearls.  It is a
 monochromatic, pixellated visual nightmare.  The only architectural
 features that relieve the monotony are at the far end of the room:  a
 door frame and doorknob covered in black pearls.

 proudly to face the knights and Katschei with your formidable army.
 The chefs surround you, faces set with fiercesome expressions and their
 cutlery held in ceremonial battle stances.  The knights are somewhat
 confused at the purpose of this arriving force.
    "Are you bringing the next course?"  Katschei sputters.
    At once a chef screams out in Japanese:  "Pepper shower attack!"
 (Vasilii is at your elbow to translate.)  The chefs pull out their
 pepper mills, leap onto the table, and, with aggressive grinding
 action, fill their opponents' eyes with a shower of ground pepper.
    The knights leap up, lurching about, trying to find their footing
 and their weaponry through the stinging pain in their peppery eyes.
    Another chef cries:  "Teppanyaki Technique--Perfected!"  Another:
 "Ginger Final Attack!"  (again, according to Vasilii's translation).
 Most of the chefs go to work with their cutlery:  the first wave with
 giant cleavers, hacking off limbs.  The second wave moves in with the
 carving knives, flaying off large slices of knight flesh.  A third
 group takes on the fine slicing.
    Meanwhile, the "special forces" are preparing the final attack.
 They have set up some pots on makeshift fires and pull from their bags
 long ginger roots, bottles of rice vinegar, and other condiments.  The
 finished flesh is tossed from one set of chefs to the cooking team, who
 are giving the meat a quick marinade in the sauce.
    When all of the knights have been disabled, the chefs start
 chanting, "kuroi tamago, kuroi tamago!"  Vasilii leans over to you, "I
 think they mean it's time to break the egg, Ivan."

 *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***

>note 6
 [6]: This means, bizarrely enough, that there are twenty-nine knights,
 not twenty-seven as you might expect.  In the old Russian tales, people
 would always travel "across three times nine lands to the thirtieth
 tsardom."  Evidently, the old Russians were not big on math.

>break egg
 You're determined to make this into as much of a performance for the
 chefs as the show they've put on for you.  Katschei rages and prepares
 to rush you.  You take the egg and squeeze it in your hand, ever so
 slightly.  The fierce light begins to dim in the wizard's eyes.  The
 chefs murmur as one, "Ooooo!"
    You toss the egg from the right hand to the left, hurling Katschei
 violently from one corner of the room to the other.  An "Aaahhh!"
 arises from the chef's throats.
    You slam the egg to the ground with tremendous force.  As it
 shatters, Katschei recoils in horror, his eyes turning back in his
 head.  Your surroundings begin to shimmer and melt away.  You are too
 confused to know where you are or what is happening to you.  A strong
 wind begins to blow you around like a piece of paper.  You are lost in
 this kaleidoscope maelstrom for a timeless interval.  Suddenly, all is
 quiet and dark.  A moment later, you hear the chatter of happy voices
 around you.  You open your eyes and discover that you are now in ...

 The Cathedral of Our Lady
    You are in a magnificent yet completely familiar place.  You have
 known the Cathedral of Our Lady since you were very small.  You have
 marveled at the grandness of the architecture and taken comfort in the
 small gestures of the priest in preparing the host for communion.
 Today the nave is even more beautiful to behold.  Swags of greens hang
 between the columns, and flowers have been banked up around the altar
 in abundance.  You don't think this is a major feast day.  When you
 look around at who else is there, however, you start to get an idea of
 what celebration is intended.

 Vasilii is at your side, gawking in amazement at the woman standing
 next to your father.

 "It's Mom!"  Vasilii exclaims.  You had left out that one piece of
 information in relating to Vasilii what had happened inside the
 palaces.  She is no longer the Firebird, no longer a bird at all; now
 she will only be your little mother. She approaches and embraces you
 both.  "Thank you, my boys," she whispers through tears.

 Your father comes up to greet you.  "Ivan," he exclaims, wrapping you
 in his embrace, "you've done it.  Destroyed Katschei and returned your
 mother to us."
    "And Vasilii!  Did you aid your brother in battle?"  Vasilii tells
 your dad all about the great teppanyaki battle.  "Um... yes, my boy.
 Very clever thinking.  I must admit that this time you got it right."

 Your parents are gesturing for you to look behind you.  Pearl!  She too
 is freed of her bird form, but couldn't be any lovelier than the
 creature you beheld at first sight.  She is wearing the wedding gown
 you saw her working on in the ante chamber.  "I finished it finally,"
 she says.

 Alongside her is a young woman whose arms you already know, but whose
 face is new.  She was the captive of the copper palace, now freed of
 her avian shackles.  You greet her and attempt to introduce her to
 Pearl.  "But I don't know your name," you confess.  "I am Copper," she
 replies.

 A girl in a silvery gown is standing on the other side of Pearl.  You
 cannot see her feet under her gown, but you imagine she was the bird
 captive in the silver palace.  She gives you a wink.  Yes, that's her.
 "And would you be Silver?"  you ask her.  "Yes, indeed, sugar!"

 Your brother Dimitri is here, no longer incognito.  You can't tell yet
 whether he's noticed your mother.  Your allergist is at Dimitri's side,
 trying to help him focus on the most important details of the scene.
 Dimitri is more than a little bit unfocused.

 The head caterer has just come in from outside, where he is supervising
 his staff in the preparation of a feast.

 The caterer's young serving wench is right behind him.  She runs past
 the caterer and straight up to Pearl.  She bows low.  "My lady, I look
 like a serving girl, but I am in fact your younger sister, Elena."
    "How can that be?  My parents had but one child!"
    "They were successful then in keeping my birth a secret from
 Katschei."
    "How did you come to this tsardom and to this low position?"
    "When I was old enough, I asked our parents' permission to go off
 and search for you.  They would not allow a girl to adventure, even for
 as noble a task.  So I disguised myself as a peasant and escaped one
 night."
    "But you were not able to find me?"
    "I had found Katschei's mountain and a route through the wilderness
 from the forest by the time I heard that Ivan was being sent on the
 task.  When Vasilii told me he was going to find Ivan, I told him my
 route to the steppe."
    You overhear their conversation.  "So that's how Vasilii was able to
 sneak up on me!"  you think to yourself.
    There is no doubting that Pearl and Elena are sisters, so strong is
 the resemblance.  Pearl introduces you.  "Ivan, without Elena I would
 have never been able to find my parents again."

 Flo is here, dressed in her peasant best, beaming at you with
 uncharacteristic pride.

 The teppanyaki chefs are here, gathered around a big pile of rags.

 It's no pile of rags:  it's the baba yaga from the forest!  She is
 using her magical bag as a gift-wrapping service.  You can hear her
 schtick all the way from the front of the church:  "You may put
 whatever you dare in the bag.  Choose carefully, my friends, for what
 you put in the bag will never again be what it was."  This is not
 scaring the teppanyaki chefs much; they really only understand
 Japanese, and the results are not very frightening; only gaily wrapped
 presents are emerging from the bag.

 Finally, the archbishop of your father's tsardom is standing at the
 altar.  A tall elder with a long white beard, he is dressed today in
 his best ceremonial robes.

 *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***

 Your father takes you by the arm and mounts the few steps to the altar.
 He calls for attention and instantly commands it.  "Subjects, this is a
 joyous day for me and for the tsardom.  My son, Ivan, has destroyed the
 wizard Katschei and freed his captives.  One of the women held captive
 was his mother, my wife. The others were all daughters stolen from the
 rulers of nearby tsardoms, who will also rejoice when they hear this
 news.  To celebrate this occasion, I announce the betrothal of Ivan to
 Katschei's bride-to-be, Pearl.  Ivan, you and Pearl will be tsar and
 tsarina over this tsardom in three years' time.  As the first privilege
 I will grant you as future tsar, you may choose a wife for each of your
 brothers."  [7]

 Nuptial Bliss, Beneficient Reign
    Pearl becomes your bride.  The feasting is long and boisterous.  On
 the second day of feasting, the teppanyaki chefs outdo themselves in
 giving the guests the show and the meal of their lives.  There were few
 casualties, and, luckily, none were among the guests.
    Soon after your marriage you are able to travel to Pearl's home
 tsardom.  Her parents receive you, Pearl, and Elena with great joy.
 They are happy to see that both of their daughters are settled in your
 tsardom.
    In three years' time, you indeed become tsar and Pearl your tsarina.
 Your father retires with your mother to make up for their many long
 years' separation.  Your reign is a happy one with Pearl at your side.
 As there is no male heir in Pearl's line, after several years, her
 parents also retire and join their tsardom to yours.
    Vasilii becomes your trusted advisor and friend, Dimitri does no
 great additional damage, and together you three do justice to your
 family's name as beneficient and kind men.

 In a total of 627 turns, you have achieved a score of 72 points out of
 a possible 72.

    You have reached the end of the game, but luckily, in an adventure
 game life, you can live it over again.  Don't care for Japanese food?
 You can defeat Katschei's knights without Vasilii and his chefs.  Kill
 Vasilii and see if you can enlist a more compact and efficient fighting
 force.
    You can even avoid marriage altogether if you get in touch with your
 dark side.  Choose the AMUSING option to get some hints on how to play
