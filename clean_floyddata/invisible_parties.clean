 An old resolution: <span class="floydstyle em">no dealings with the Three Rebeccas.</span> But
 clade-mates must be civil, and civility made you careless. More
 importantly, Jave was going to be there: Jave, who you haven't managed
 to see in close on a year, as though the ways were twisting against
 you. And they don't have any <span class="floydstyle em">good</span> reasons to want to fuck you
 over, so you should really give them the benefit of the doubt, right?

 But as you cross the threshold of the tangle, every sense screams
 <span class="floydstyle em">trap</span>. Of fucking course.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">None Know The Hour</span>
 Feels like the apartments of a well-off academic couple who entertain
 a lot. Lots of one-of-a-kind furniture in nice old wood, very full
 bookcases, art conspicuously esoteric and ethnic. Would feel kind of
 crowded if it wasn't so unnaturally tidy. More, similar rooms
 sprawling out through odd-angled spaces.

 It was themed as a maybe-the-apocalypse party - a small joke on the
 difficulty of scheduling social events in a multiverse. There's a
 mushroom-cloud cake (already partially eaten), a planet-shaped
 piñata,
 and a glittery banner declaring HAPPY END OF DAYS. A few of the guests
 are costumed.

 Becky Baumgartner is seated - enthroned, really, like a heavy-handed
 neoclassical allegory - with a snow leopard draped at her feet. She
 cocks her chin up at your approach.

 Orient yourself. Picture the woven ways as ground underfoot, and
 they'll become walkable. The tangle extends to the north, south, east
 and west. <span class="floydstyle em">[You can turn off exit notifications with EXITS OFF, or</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Invisible Parties was made for ShuffleComp in April/May 2014, an</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">event that randomly assigned songs to authors to inspire games. It was</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">originally published under the pseudonym Psychopup. The work was very</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">loosely inspired by </span>Symphony 10: Could This Really Be The End<span class="floydstyle em"></span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">by Emily Wells, from the album </span>The Symphonies: Dreams Memories &
 Parties<span class="floydstyle em">; the song was suggested by Jennifer Earl. (Actually, this</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">was sort of a cop-out, because I was already familiar with the song,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">owned the album, and had seen the artist play live.)</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Thanks are due to Matt Weiner and Doug Orleans for first-round</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">testing, to Neil Butters, Jacqueline Lott, Emily Short and Caleb</span>

>inventory

 As for your resources... well, physical things don't always translate
 reliably world-to-world, and walkers tend to be wary of them. Most
 learned skills rely too heavily on specific circumstances that rarely
 obtain in other worlds. The range and life expectancy of a wayfarer
 are circumscribed by <span class="floydstyle em">gifts</span>, talents in the bone, uncannily
 irrespective of culture, climate or metaphysics. Gifts are inborn, or
 hard-bargained from subdivine powers.

 You are a Warrior, a Forager, a Textual Critic and a Troublemaker.
 <span class="floydstyle em">[To use a gift, USE GIFT or just GIFT. You can EXAMINE gifts for</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">more information.]</span>

>dance

 Not the place, not the mood.

>xyzzy

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>examine gifts

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine warrior

 With the warrior gift, you win fights. People often describe it as
 innate skill, and that's partly it, but it's something more than that;
 it also, somehow, shields you from the kinds of bad luck that get even
 the strong and experienced killed. It is not something to be relied
 upon, given that it makes you neither bulletproof nor inexhaustible,
 but it's one hell of an edge.

 For some, the talent manifests in sublime grace, a whirl of dancer's
 rhythms and brush-stroke arcs. It does not work that way for you.
 You're more about short stabbing motions, nasty little twists and
 locks, low defensive stances, staying in cover, controlled fire. Looks
 like a dog's breakfast.

>examine me

 Worlds change wayfarers to a certain extent, and you're used to that.
 But a tangle is a messy superposition of many worlds, so it's liable
 to be more abrupt. Watch yourself.

 A politely-deployed tangle will often have a sort of foyer, a
 not-too-outlandish area in which guests can orient themselves. With a
 discreetly-positioned mirror. Yeah, you look pretty close to your
 default: soft butch woman, five-three-ish, strong but totally
 non-graceful, spiky hair dyed crimson.

>examine hair

 Now is not the time to be worrying about it.

>examine forager

 One of the most common gifts, if only because those without it tend to
 die off fast. A forager can find food and water if there's any to be
 found. You know, somehow, which berries are best left uneaten, which
 meat is full of hookworm, which water is a cholera vector.

 The forager gift is often given as the reason why so many of the Walk
 are ravening foodies. You're doubtful of the correlation, yourself:
 travel's reason enough. But a professional-quality meal <span class="floydstyle em">does</span>
 seem more enticing when you've been living on grass seeds for a month.

>examine troublemaker

 It's called <span class="floydstyle em">trickster</span> by some, and the stories that feature
 it usually depict someone with a pathological need to start shit, who
 glories in shit-starting for its own sake, even at vast personal cost.
 Yeah, there are people like that all over, and the ones who have the
 gift are fucking <span class="floydstyle em">awful</span>. But you're not, by inclination,
 someone who <span class="floydstyle em">lives</span> to make trouble. Not since you were younger
 and more confused, anyway. Nor do you create trouble by accident, at
 least not any more than the average person. What the gift
 <span class="floydstyle em">does</span> is to make the trouble you start <span class="floydstyle em">highly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">effective</span>; if any potential exists for a riot or a fist-fight or
 a shouting-match, you can pretty much ensure it'll be an <span class="floydstyle em">epic</span>
 one. Which may have something to do with this whole business, come to
 think of it.

>examine critic

 Some gifts are of, well, fairly marginal utility. You met a guy once
 whose only talent, other than wayfinding itself, was juggling. He
 could juggle pretty much anything he could lift one-handed, mind you,
 and had thought of several unexpected applications, but it didn't go
 all that far.

 Textual criticism is a good bit more useful, because - like most gifts
 - it's truly cross-cultural, which means that you can read, say, a
 pamplet of pornographic 18th-century French political satire, or an
 oral history of land rights among indigenous Tasmanians, or a zine
 circulated among otaku in 1980s NorCal high schools, and you will
 actually <span class="floydstyle em">grasp</span> all the layers of meaning.

 Apart from making grad school embarrassingly easy, it's very useful
 for grappling with the otherwise-incomprehensible peoples that
 populate odd corners of the ways and worlds - as long as they're
 literate, or willing to tell you stories.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">None Know The Hour</span>
 Feels like the apartments of a well-off academic couple who entertain
 a lot. Lots of one-of-a-kind furniture in nice old wood, very full
 bookcases, art conspicuously esoteric and ethnic. Would feel kind of
 crowded if it wasn't so unnaturally tidy. More, similar rooms
 sprawling out through odd-angled spaces.

 Becky Baumgartner is seated - enthroned, really, like a heavy-handed
 neoclassical allegory - with a snow leopard draped at her feet.

 The tangle extends to the north, south, east and west.

>examine becky

 Tall and solid, with acres of jawline, Becky Baumgartner has always
 put you in mind of a matron of the Roman Republic: soft-armed, but
 with bones you could anchor ships to, and a sense of unaffected
 superiority that could anchor small planets. She says little and
 emotes less, but when she does she damn well means it.

>examine leopard

 Holy fuck but these things are huge up close. It looks... lean, alert,
 not a zoo animal. But of course it's completely relaxed.

>pet kitty

 You can't see any such thing.

>pet leopard

 It tenses up ever so slightly at your approach, and you think better
 of it.

>examine cake

 It represents quite an impressive feat of construction, though you
 suspect the central column of hiding supports. The icing is the most
 striking feature, a beautifully-brushed grey that somehow suggests
 fiery destruction glowering from within the choking dust; the effect
 is spoiled somewhat by the parts that have been cut away, revealing a
 nondescript white sponge.

>fight leopard

 Wanton violence wears one out, and makes one feel like an ass.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Purposeful</span> violence is another matter.

>eat cake

 It's just a dry old sponge with fancy icing. Not worth the hassle of
 working out which part to hack off.

>lick cake

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>examine piata

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine earth

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine planet

 A crude papier-mache globe, with green blobby continents looking
 rather crowded for space.

>smash planet

 You're not generally squeamish about symbolism, but for some reason
 the thought of it makes your skin crawl a little.

>examine banner

 HAPPY END OF DAYS, in a cheerful font with little rainbow-reflective
 sparklies all over it. Mass-produced, evidently, which raises a
 question or two.

>examine guests

 They're mostly between twenty and forty, predominantly white or East
 or South Asian, about three-quarters female, above-average queer
 quotient. Slightly-tweedy business-casual. It's very tempting to
 assume that this represents the Three Rebeccas' clique, if they even
 have such a thing. (Or what they'd like their clique to look like. Or
 some version thereof skewed towards you.)

 A handful of them are in fancy dress: two of the Horsemen of the
 Apocalypse are necking in the kitchen, and you count two Jesuses and
 one Antichrist, all women. Best concept is definitely Loki, a
 cheekbony young man with a plush wolf on one shoulder and a plastic
 snake on the other.

 snake on the other.

>examine wolf

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine furniture

 The furniture is evidently the result of long, dedicated and tasteful
 (but not over-planned) questing in antique shops and odd corners of
 the world; congruent styles and colours (lots of weathered-brick red
 and teak brown), but just mismatched enough to let you know.

>examine art

 A trio of Central African masks. An outsider-art-ish scene in coloured
 pencils, with hundreds of naively drawn figures with horribly
 distorted heads. The head of a steel drum, intricately cut out into
 birds and tree-branches. A frame drum the size of a truck wheel, with
 a raven and an eagle in solid panels of red and black. A fetish of
 dark wood, vaguely human but almost completely obscured by the narrow
 iron wedges pincushioning its body. A set of clay cylinder seals,
 framed behind glass.

>examine bookcases

 There are a lot of coffee-table books in here, largely in the field of
 Photogenic Anthropology. A lot of hardcore-scholarly Upside treatises
 on magic and liminology, of the kind that walkers largely ignore. The
 complete Book of Eight Houses, including apocrypha. A bunch of things
 with hand-tooled leather covers. If there are any paperbacks in the
 house, they're not where visitors can see 'em.

>read book

 house, they're not where visitors can see 'em.

>talk to becky

 There are a number of questions that occur to you, but "What the
 everliving fuck is going on?" seems to cover most of it. Poor
 diplomacy, possibly, but playing nice seems moot at this point.

 "Forgo her."

 "That's not a - wait, <span class="floydstyle em">what?</span>"

 "Jave. We object to the match. Forgo her."

>becky, what the fuck

 It takes a little work to bring your temper down. One of the
 consistent points of the Sheaf clade, and of clades in general, is
 that nobody gives orders. Oh, there's an unspoken hierarchy, and
 leaders of various kinds, but... outside a life-and-death situation,
 even the <span class="floydstyle em">appearance</span> of a command is a room-clearing insult.
 There's a lot of "If you could" and "Would you mind please", which
 drives you insane at times, but apparently you care about the
 underlying premise a great deal. Hunh.

 "What's the idea here? If I say no, you... what does this place
 <span class="floydstyle em">do</span>, anyway?"

 "A monkey trap. You are only held here by holding on. Let go, get
 out."

 "Hold on, and... what? Wait until the trapper shows up?"

 A languid blink.

>blink

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>talk to becky

 "Jesus shit, look: one, this counts as an attack on a clademate and
 I'll fucking <span class="floydstyle em">wreck</span> you for it, two, what the fuck makes it
 even slightly okay for you to decide who I see, and three... what's
 going on here? If it's let go you want, why is there no way out?"

 With an expression that says <span class="floydstyle em">enough</span>, she stands, walks, and
 fades away into nothingness.

 Shit. Okay. Take stock. The Rebeccas, taken together, are not just
 walkers but weavers: they can not only traverse the ways and worlds,
 they can... take bits out of them, temporarily rearrange them into new
 ways and worlds. It's a rare gift. One of the things that can be
 crafted in this way is a <span class="floydstyle em">tangle</span>, a bounded array of tightly
 finite worlds that complement one another, packed very closely. This
 is not a stable arrangement, and they're usually set up as spectacles,
 exhibitions of craft and talent. Extremely elaborate party tricks.

 But they're unstable. Imperfect. Whatever they've done, you can get
 around it.

>becky, fuck this shit

 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">None Know The Hour</span>
 Feels like the apartments of a well-off academic couple who entertain

>go north

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun-sleeps-in-the-rock</span>
 Slickrock hillside, orange-red, a hot sun low in a cloudless sky, a
 hard dry heat. Far downhill, the rock gives way to thornveldt, the
 plain punctuated by distant outcrops.

 Beneath a lone, broad-spreading shade-tree, people kick back on
 boulders and blankets and camp-chairs. There are meaty things sizzling
 over a fire, a couple of coolers.

 And outwards, across the sun-baked rock, you can sense the Barren Way
 beckoning.

 The tangle extends to the north, south to None Know The Hour, east,
 west and Outside.

>examine tree

 You don't quite recognise the species, but you've seen its kind. Hard,
 slow-growing wood, waxy leaves, branches spreading wide and airy. A
 tree to survive drought.

>examine people

 A conspicuously mixed-race group; maybe a third each of unambiguous
 white and black. Dressed for a hot climate that's rough on clothes.
 There's some low-key chatter and occasional trips to the cooler or the
 fire, but your general impression is of a pride of very well-fed lions
 taking naps.

>examine cooler

 Big, beaten-up-looking coldboxes, stacked densely with beer and large
 water-jugs.

>talk to people

 They're not really here; they're drawn from the worlds, somehow,
 though whether they're facsimiles, composites or projections of real
 people isn't clear. You could make light conversation with them,
 manipulate, harm; but you'll never be able to learn anything important
 from them, or understand them as individuals. Frankly, it gives you
 the creeps.

>examine leaves

 You can't see any such thing.

>drink beer

 You crack open a can of cold beer. It's recognisably beer, and fairly
 cold. In this heat, that makes it ambrosia. It's really rather good:
 the Rebeccas can't be accused of scrimping on their parties.
>examine creeps


 You can't see any such thing.

>take water-jug

 Real, solid, but still just a shadow-trick.

>drink beer

 You crack open a can of cold beer. It's recognisably beer, and fairly
 cold. In this heat, that makes it ambrosia. May as well take advantage
 of it while it's available.

>drink beer

 You crack open a can of cold beer. It's recognisably beer, and fairly
 cold. In this heat, that makes it ambrosia. You're maintaining a nice
 even buzz.

>drink beer

 You crack open a can of cold beer. It's recognisably beer, and fairly
 cold. In this heat, that makes it ambrosia. You don't appear to be
 getting any drunker.

>drink beer

 You crack open a can of cold beer. It's recognisably beer, and fairly
 cold. In this heat, that makes it ambrosia. You don't appear to be
 getting any drunker.

>examine boulders

 Great rocks, from about the size of a house down to that of a desk,
 are strewn about the slope seemingly at random: stacked on one
 another, jumbled in heaps, or standing like lone monoliths. They're of
 the same red, grainy stone as the hillside.

>talk to tree

 You can't see any such thing.

>climb tree

 Given less pressing circumstances, of finding a comfortable perch and
 retiring there with a six-pack and a book would be magnificent. The
 thought occurs, not for the first time, that the Rebeccas are wasting
 their talents on petty revenge.

>examine sun

 The sun's a deep, peachy colour, beginning to shade towards red. Some
 optical illusion - dust in the atmosphere? - makes it seem gibbous on
 the lower side. There are not enough clouds for a truly spectacular
 sunset, but the warm red glow still paints a third of the sky.

>examine thornveldt

 A rambling, broken landscape, dry and rocky. "Rocky" undersells it,
 really: the landscape is rocks, into the cracks of which some soil and
 thorn-trees are jammed. From your high vantage, you can see a very
 long way.

>take sun

 Real, solid, but still just a shadow-trick.

>examine blankets

 Old, worn-out looking blankets with a vague institutional flavour, or
 else brightly-coloured patterned cloths.

>examine meaty

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine things

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine the thing

 You can't see any such thing.

>outside

 You try and walk outwards, and - oh, <span class="floydstyle em">unpleasant</span>. There's a
 way out there, no question, the ways are the loom-strings that hold
 the weave in place - but the whole thing's wound so tightly that
 they're constricted.

 A really strong wayfarer, on a familiar way, might be able to squeeze
 out. But the Rebeccas, for all their other gifts, are in your
 estimation rather unexceptional walkers. So, there needs to be a trick
 to loosing them, or another exit.

>let go

 That's too abstract. You need a more concrete course of action.

>get out

 You try and walk outwards, and - oh, <span class="floydstyle em">unpleasant</span>. There's a
 way out there, no question, the ways are the loom-strings that hold
 the weave in place - but the whole thing's wound so tightly that
 they're constricted.

>tickle out

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>tickle me

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>go north

 You're unable to pass. But this is a completely different feeling to
 reaching the <span class="floydstyle em">edge</span> of a space. The tangle extends further in
 that direction, and its makers certainly traversed here.

>sing

 You don't have much of a voice, and this doesn't seem like the place
 for it.

>cry

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Pleasant Month of May</span>
 You're on a village green: in England, or something very close to it.
 It's a flawless day in late spring, a blue sky dappled with lazy white
 clouds, air clean, crisp and just on the pleasant side of cool. Fresh
 green all over the trees, including the big dancing-lime spreading its
 shade over the green's heart. And evidently someone decided that the
 only thing that could possibly improve this was an accordion. You're
 amidst a rustic and jubilant crowd, dancing with more enthusiasm than
 choreography.

 And there, at the edges of the green, the mouth of a hollow way. A way
 out.

 The tangle extends to the north, south, east, west to
 Sun-sleeps-in-the-rock and Outside.

>dance

 The dance is a simple one, and allows for a wide range of
 permutations: geriatric shuffles, elaborate moves from young
 show-offs, artless enthusiasm from very small children and the
 embarrassingly middle-aged. The overall effect is chaos, and you take
 a few bumps before deciding to stick to a vaguely rhythmic head bob.

>out

 You try and walk outwards, and - oh, <span class="floydstyle em">unpleasant</span>. There's a
 way out there, no question, the ways are the loom-strings that hold
 the weave in place - but the whole thing's wound so tightly that
 they're constricted.

>bob

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>examine lime

 Not the citrus lime, but the linden or basswood, a beautiful,
 densely-foliated tree that, later in the summer, will be clouded by a
 sweet clean fragrance and much-frequented by bees. This one has been
 trained so that the lowest boughs clear the dancers' heads, while
 still allowing climbing. A number of the musicians have been hoisted
 into the lower branches and are playing overhead.

>cut strings

 You can't see any such thing.

>climb tree

 Which do you mean, the dancing lime or the greenery?

>lime

 If you were here to enjoy the party, that's exactly what you would be
 doing. But this place isn't designed for your enjoyment; they would
 probably send wasps.

>climb greenery

 Real, solid, but still just a shadow-trick.

>examine accordion

 A group covering a wide range of ages, musical proficiency and stages
 of drunkenness. The music is of a kind that mostly accomodates this
 and staggers onwards, though. They're dressed in a motley of red and
 black.

>smell

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>listen

 Folk music of the livelier variety. The band are more enthusiastic
 than talented, but it all comes together well enough. It's mostly
 accordion and drums, and there're some pipes in there too.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">No Place To Rest Your Head</span>
 A rough-plastered room that you suspect of being in the back of a pub
 somewhere. Deep in the night. A patchy assortment of people are
 sitting silent, a respectful distance away from the open coffin laid
 out on a table.

 There's a single sprig of frangipani in the corpse's buttonhole.

 The tangle extends to the north, south and east to
 Sun-sleeps-in-the-rock.

>examine coffin

 For a moment you have the crawly suspicion that it'll be you in the
 casket, but as it turns out, no. He's not old, not young. White,
 shortish, wearing a dress suit grown a little ratty. His face won't
 stick in your memory, and you suspect that he's not the point of this
 exercise.

>examine frangipani

 Five waxy petals, white blushed with gold, and an impossibly
 voluptuous, nocturnal perfume.

 The plant seems like a dinosaur, too lumpen and exotic to live, yet it
 grew everywhere in Masdita. On one of the long evenings lazily
 searching for a safe route out, hoping not to find one, she tried to
 arrange as many as possible of them in your hair. Your hair was far
 too short, and frangipani blooms have no real stem to speak of, so
 every time you moved your head half the flowers would escape, but the
 fragrance clung until the next day.

>take flower

 You can't see any such thing.

>take frangipani

 You run a wistful finger over the frangipani. Keepsakes are not
 something that anybody gets to keep for long in the Ways - for that
 matter, practical equipment doesn't have much of a lifespan. That's
 never more true than in the constant transition of a tangle; little
 point in hanging on to it.

>smell it

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>examine buttonhole

 You can't see any such thing.

>enter coffin

 That's not something you can enter.

>close coffin

 It isn't something you can close.

>people

 That's far-off, and not all ways are alike. You'll have to go step by
 step.

>pray

 A good portion of the mourners are doing so. It feels disrespectful to
 fake it.

 There's a single sprig of frangipani in the corpse's buttonhole.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Under My Roof</span>
 Middle-class living-room, with couches. The teenagers variously
 slouched around the couches and the floor are clearly the occupant's
 spawn and comrades thereof. Big blocky stereo from back when CDs were
 new and exciting. The air's full of the reek of cheap weed, half-empty
 drinks are scattered over every surface and niche, and over at one end
 of the couch there's a couple pointedly making out.

 Jave is sitting in a big armchair, blonde-dreadlocked, entirely
 comfortable but a little apart from the group.

>talk to jave

 You start, and... it's not that you can't make sounds, or articulate
 your mouth. It's not even that you can't form thoughts into words. But
 the process that connects the two parts doesn't work - what comes out
 is a garble, uninflected even by emotion. Jave attends closely, but
 without comprehension.

>examine teenagers

 You estimate the age range to be between fourteen and twenty, with the
 mode about sixteen; this is unreliable, though, because everybody's
 trying very hard to look older than they are, principally through the
 medium of dirt.

 From an era when everybody felt the need to own gigantic hi-fi tower
 speakers, then play recopied tapes on them.

>examine drinks

 An ill-conceived assortment of pre-mixed, syrupy
 cocktails-in-a-bottle, cheap beer, and - oh, god, tequila shots. You
 didn't know tequila could come in plastic.

>make out with teenagers

 They're not really here; they're drawn from the worlds, somehow,
 though whether they're facsimiles, composites or projections of real
 people isn't clear. You could make light conversation with them,
 manipulate, harm; but you'll never be able to learn anything important
 from them, or understand them as individuals. Frankly, it gives you
 the creeps.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">None Know The Hour</span>
 Feels like the apartments of a well-off academic couple who entertain

 bookcases, art conspicuously esoteric and ethnic. Would feel kind of

 sprawling out through odd-angled spaces.

>use critic

 So many books here, grabbing one at random wouldn't reveal all that
 much. Consider them as a corpus. First, presentation: these are a set
 of books selected for their effect on an audience. Fiction forms a
 minority, is entirely hardback literature, often collector's editions.
 A great many gorgeously expensive coffee-table books, mostly with
 anthropological overtones: portraits of modern African scarification,
 street food scenes across the worlds, confiscated prison weapons in
 the West 1800-1960. The liminology section is dense, technical, and
 tightly organised, suggesting expertise; the magic stuff, on the other
 hand, leans hard towards the esoteric and apocryphal, scholarly works
 jumbled up with mystic ravings - so, either one person with very
 different approaches to neighbouring subjects, or, more likely, at
 least two contributors.

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wedding on the Water</span>
 A still and starry night. You're amongst a chaotic flotilla of
 smallish pleasure-boats, their masts and rails all hung with lights.
 Beyond the clustered vessels, inky-dark water reflects the more
 distant lights of a city, on three sides: a lake or a bay. The boats
 are full of people in suits and gowns, chattering fit to burst.

 Outside the shelter of land, the sea at the bay mouth is dark and
 inviting.

 A comfortably cluttered room: warm but clear lighting, lots of

 probably a dining table, and on the dining table is spread out a

 The board takes up about half the table's real estate, and is clearly

 Paneled ceilings, carpet tile, decor that's dead inside. A table of

 Party decorations from a party store. You've never had a job in a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Granite and Glass</span>
 This is a home, you think, but a home out of a spy movie or a
 photoshoot, not intended to be lived in by humans. Ceiling and floor
 are vast oceans of polished black granite; the walls on two sides are
 sheer glass, so the overall effect is of being between two crushing
 plates. There is no clutter at all, each item of furniture spaced out
 from the others like a piece in a gallery. The guests are beautiful in
 a marble-and-porcelain, expensive-tailor manner; they aren't so much
 mingling as posing in groups.

 There'll be a garage somewhere, and a ridiculous prestige car, and the
 road out.

 Beside the mantelpiece of a wholly decorative fireplace, someone -
 evidently as bored with this place as you are - has scratched a series
 of graffiti into the slate walls.

 The tangle extends to the north to Under My Roof, east to Function and

>examine graffiti

 A little South African flag, the word "shit" in various fonts, several
 rather inexpert faces, a recognisable Blackhawk helicopter, and some
 stick-figures fucking.

>examine guests

 Tall, graceful men and women, all slightly androgynous in an elfin,
 decorative manner. Crisply and expensively dressed. Everyone in
 carefully-chosen greys and blues, and you in scarlet. You can tell

 together, they feel like a school of predatory fish.

 Jeez, they're just kids. Drunken roughhousing seems socially

 You hate to mess with them. They're just kids, they're raw and stupid
 in so many different overlapping ways, and... somehow they're
 comfortable. You don't grow up by being comfortable, is the thing.
 This group's never going to change or grow without a major disruptive
 influence.

 The fact that this justification seems completely reasonable to you is
 probably a sign that this place is making you raw and stupid yourself,
 but when in Rome, what the fuck, right?

 Your overture is sequentially snogging both halves of a couple in the
 upstairs hall, letting yourself get caught the second time. You
 extract some stoned secrets from one guy and deliver them to the worst
 possible recipient, with certain shifts of emphasis. You identify the
 guy with bottled-up fury and subtly needle him until he has a
 spittle-spraying outburst at someone less subtle. You allow the drama
 to overlap and interweave.

 You don't feel <span class="floydstyle em">good</span> about it. But at the end of the evening,

 There's a muffled explosion. It takes you a second to realise that

 Then there are red-and-blues flashing harsh through the windows, and
 everyone's scrambling in one direction or another. There's muffled
 shouting through a megaphone, but the words are broken up by further
 crashes and yells of fear or pain. <span class="floydstyle em">Thump</span>, a window breaks and
 the room's filling with smoke, and some of the shadows moving through

 Beneath a lone, broad-spreading shade-tree, people kick back on

 Your waysense is still lurching around, making you a little nauseous.
 The tangle's temporary structure isn't robust enough to cope with
 this - it was probably designed to fail, like luring someone inside a
 condemned building and encouraging them to lean against a joist. Your
 very passage may be disrupting it.

 There might be an up side, though. When the walls are coming down,
 it's hard to keep doors locked.

 mountain, tundra, steppe, high desert: dry harsh land, where missing a

 <span class="floydstyle em">yours</span>, and a walker cannot help but love their way.

 Reba is looking out over the rock, wearing the least hijab-ish hijab

 The tangle extends to the inside to Sun-sleeps-in-the-rock.

 A memory:

 Two-thirds of the way along Mirror Branch, the only time that an easy
 job got a little twitchy. Along the river there was, unexpectedly, a
 stockade, set up by a Romani band, out of Upside via Kosovo. They were
 well-armed, and had one or two single-gifted among them; it was not
 clear whether they were set up as bandits, or toll-collectors, or were
 simply protecting their settlement. They bristled; accustomed to
 persecution, they assumed trade along this river would be followed by
 Mission, and if they were wrong it was only through happy accident.
 You still don't really have any idea about how their humour
 <span class="floydstyle em">worked</span> - you had the vague sense that dark humour was part of
 everything, something in the vein of Soviet political jokes, and that
 there was a subtle distinction between the kinds of joke told by women
 and men, but really all that you <span class="floydstyle em">knew</span> was that there was a
 vast, vast amount of vital meaning that was shooting back and forth
 over your head.

 And Jave just sort of waded into all this - look, the first time you
 really remember her, remember her as a distinct person rather than a
 template Mission-vet, is when she burst out in full-bellied laughs at
 an aside from the headman.

 They didn't suddenly become her bosom friends. The scene did not end
 with a guitar sing-along over potent drinks, worse luck. They knew
 that something was going on with her, and you're not completely sure
 it changed the outcome. But they had started thinking of her (and only
 her) as a person rather than a problem. She waved when you left, and
 some of them waved back.

>examine reba

 Little aquiline nose, teeth a little too large for a mouth always
 smiling, really good at choosing scarves. Reba is the least obnoxious
 of the three, the one who you actually get along with when distinct
 from her cohorts. Which is ultimately why they've got a problem with
 you: while the motives and interests of the Rebeccas are a matter of
 carefully-tended ambiguity, the one thing they do not forgive is any
 attempt to divide the Rebeccas.

 True, the possibility of schtupping Reba wasn't <span class="floydstyle em">entirely</span>
 absent from your mind, and at least <span class="floydstyle em">part</span> of the appeal of
 that prospect was that it would fluster the others. But it's not as
 though that formed an <span class="floydstyle em">objective</span> so much as a routine
 possibility, a basic consequence of her being kind of cute and not
 conspicuously a jerk.

>talk to reba

 "What the shit are your cronies up to, al-Nasri?"

 She actually looks hurt. "Nice to see you too, T. How have you been?"

 "Oh, same old - grouchy, lovelorn, intolerant of horsecrap. Seriously,
 what's the idea here?"

 Reba straightens herself a little. "It is... not easy to express our
 motives succinctly. We act as one, but we cast many shadows. Any
 single explanation would fall short. This one may serve you: we are
 offering you an opportunity for closure."

>talk to reba

 "Closure is nonsense, Reba. Spin me another story."

 She bobs her head at an angle, beaming. "If you must. In you and Jave
 we perceive the potential, perhaps, for a counterpart to we Three.
 Your gifts align in worrisome ways. You both tend to form attachments
 fiercely, firmly and to strong walkers. Harmless now, maybe, but
 introduce Nusku to the dynamic, or Dlamini, or the Shadow Minister,
 or, no offence meant, Thalud -"

 "Wow. Just... you have some <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> incomplete information."

 "Care to enlighten us? No? Then admit that the principle has some
 merit."

>talk to reba

 "Jesus, Reba, Jave isn't... my conspiracy to come up with some
 crazy-ass dynastic threesome or whatever. Hard as it is to imagine,
 not everybody aspires to be you."

 "I'm sure you intend nothing of the sort; the potential is what
 matters. This is a long-term aspect. A shorter one: the match would
 bring Jave into the Sheaf, and she is ex-Mission."

 Ah. Yeah, that one has some clout. Among a certain mindset, ex-Mission
 is about as cuddly as ex-KGB.

>talk to reba

 "Look, Reba, she's not Mission. Completely severed. Doesn't draw
 pension, she doesn't even <span class="floydstyle em">like</span> hanging out with vets, and
 she'd never rat if it might possibly hurt me."

 "Love is the falsest witness. Mission is Mission. Also, we understand
 she's <span class="floydstyle em">not interested in food.</span>" She twinkles at that, but it's
 actually a pretty serious indictment for a potential clademate. Food's
 at least half of what holds the Sheaf together.

>think about mission

 maybe I can, you know, negotiate, figure something out that works for
 everyone."

 She draws closer, raises her brows.
 "Maybe I'm just jealous." It's a joke, yes, but only half one, and
 you both know it.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Shit.</span> You refrain from slipping your hands over the crest of

 All the response you get is the impassive regard of her aviator

 Rivka has the air of a self-satisfied cat: she's petite, broad-hipped,
 with a constant slight smirk. You don't think you've ever seen her
 eyes: she's always veiled, or masked. Today it's oversized aviator
 sunglasses. Fearsome reputation, absolutely none of it confirmable. If
 Becky grounds the three, it's Rivka who makes them what they are. If
 she decides you're her enemy, she will crush you and not give the

 looser than most people's.

 It takes you a minute to realise that she's naked except for

 shaved clean. She's gazing out at the horizon, all her weight on one

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hollow Way</span>
 A deep-sunken lane, not wide enough for two to comfortably walk
 abreast: stumpy trees of thorn and ash, hazel and oak turn it into a
 sea-green tunnel. There are fields on either side, a bright spring
 sun, but the path slopes upwards, steeply, promising a hilltop wood.

 You've trodden this many times before. A generous way, if not an easy
 one. You could walk it in your sleep.

 Reba al-Nasri sits atop a stile, balancing an improbably-sized crock
 on one knee.

 The tangle extends to the inside to The Pleasant Month of May.

>talk to reba

 You're sure she could come up with a hundred more reasons, but it's
 clear there's no negotiation possible, and it's only going to make
 your heart ache.

>examine crock

 Little aquiline nose, teeth a little too large for a mouth always
 smiling, really good at choosing scarves.

 She has a straw hat, a vaguely French-looking floral-print dress, an
 extremely French-looking scarf and the beginnings of a tan. The huge
 earthenware crock she's lugging seems heavy enough to pull her arms
 from their sockets.

 That seems to belong to Reba al-Nasri.

 may have to contact Jave in a very long time, and that could always

 either - <span class="floydstyle em">probably</span> she can, if you can get out then likely so

 You're on a village green: in England, or something very close to it.
 It's a flawless day in late spring, a blue sky dappled with lazy white
 clouds, air clean, crisp and just on the pleasant side of cool. Fresh
 green all over the trees, including the big dancing-lime spreading its
 shade over the green's heart. And evidently someone decided that the
 only thing that could possibly improve this was an accordion. You're

 A long wooden building with a complex structure of knotwork-carved

 roasted meat, fuggy and far too warm. A line of tables and benches
 runs down the length of the hall, and on the benches sit a gnarly and
 gruff crew.

 The tangle extends to the north, south and west to The Pleasant Month

>use forage

 There's nothing you really need to deal with here. You need to find
 Jave.

>examine crew

 Mostly men, almost exclusively white. Mostly big burly guys, or guys
 whose burliness has sagged into fat. The sort of wolf-pack
 conviviality common to groups brought together by gang violence. The
 ones scurrying about serving are probably slaves. Not a scene in which
 to let anyone sense you're an outsider.

>dance

 Alas, you already are.

>examine galleries

 Evidently this is where you go when dancing doesn't appeal, to watch
 the dancers and flirt and mingle. Still doesn't really look like your
 scene, but it's about 1000% more appealing than prancing about in a

>examine nymphs

 Gaudy, ostentatious, tits-out affluence. The colour scheme starts at
 gold and works out from there.

 Immaculately-dressed. Women like tropical flowers, men in monochrome.
 Every one of them more capable of self-expression through movement
 than you are. And none of them are wearing masks.

 The sharp, scraping-bone feel of an edge sends crawly feelings up your

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parallel Crunch</span>
 A convention kind of space, a room that feels low-ceilinged because

 occupied by nerds of varying degrees of hipness, some furiously typing
 at laptops and others circulating busily within small groups.

 An emergency exit leads outwards to a familiar stair.

 They're sun-starved, mostly young, trendy in an aggressively

 Blocky, unremarkable.

 Paneled ceilings, carpet tile, decor that's dead inside. A table of

 There's a paper plate abandoned on the edge of the buffet table.

 The tangle extends to the east to Solitaire With Friends and west to
 Granite and Glass.

>examine plate

 The plate's been picked over, with a pile of rejected items - some
 limp celery sticks, an ill-favoured species of cracker - over on one
 side. She loves food, but she has a habit of throwing everything on
 her plate and sorting out what she actually wants to eat later. You've
 been curious about that, and haven't found the moment to ask: is it a
 military mess-hall habit, or is there something going on from further
 back? There's a lot of undramatic, ordinary mystery left to go over.
 Or, to put it another way: you don't really know one another all that
 well.

>take plate

 You run a wistful finger over the paper plate. Keepsakes are not
 something that anybody gets to keep for long in the Ways - for that
 matter, practical equipment doesn't have much of a lifespan. That's
 never more true than in the constant transition of a tangle; little
 point in hanging on to it.

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Granite and Glass</span>
 This is a home, you think, but a home out of a spy movie or a
 photoshoot, not intended to be lived in by humans. Ceiling and floor
 are vast oceans of polished black granite; the walls on two sides are
 sheer glass, so the overall effect is of being between two crushing
 plates. There is no clutter at all, each item of furniture spaced out
 from the others like a piece in a gallery. The guests are beautiful in
 a marble-and-porcelain, expensive-tailor manner; they aren't so much
 mingling as posing in groups.

 There'll be a garage somewhere, and a ridiculous prestige car, and the
 road out.

 Jave is standing by the arm of a chaise longue, flanked by a pair of
 perfect, bored-looking drones. Is the idea here to make you jealous?
 Someone didn't do their research.

 The tangle extends to the east to Function and Outside.

>go north

 You flinch away, a plummeting sensation in your gut. You can feel how
 the substance of the tangle is torn there: if you pushed harder at it,
 you'd shred yourself to pieces.

>talk to jave

 "Jave! Fuck, I'm glad you're here - wasn't sure you really were. Look,
 this place is a tangle, a place woven from bits of the ways and
 worlds. Super unstable, but I've seen some exits -"

 She hasn't reacted at all. You're in her line of sight, she'd have to
 be deaf and blind to miss you. Something's up.

 Then she jumps up, beaming, and runs with arms outstretched in a
 direction about forty-five degrees away from you. She fades as she
 moves, until she's quite gone. Shit.

 So why didn't that work, when before... okay, right. The tangle is
 strong in some places, fragile in others. It's strongest at the
 anchor-points, the exits and entrances, where the ways feed into it.
 In between, the weave is looser, more negotiable. Still too strong to
 tear through alone, perhaps, but with two...

 You're wearing an ill-advised confection that crawled out of a Disney

 lace and ribbon and poofy bits, and while it technically fits, it does
 so with a tone of thinly-veiled annoyance regarding the configuration
 of your tits and waist. The train keeps slipping into the water, and
 is thoroughly soggy.

 a gondola or punt, and in possession of a long, single-bladed oar.

 plain punctuated by distant outcrops.

 Beneath a lone, broad-spreading shade-tree, people kick back on

 You're on a village green: in England, or something very close to it.
 It's a flawless day in late spring, a blue sky dappled with lazy white
 clouds, air clean, crisp and just on the pleasant side of cool. Fresh
 green all over the trees, including the big dancing-lime spreading its
 shade over the green's heart. And evidently someone decided that the
 only thing that could possibly improve this was an accordion. You're
 amidst a rustic and jubilant crowd, dancing with more enthusiasm than
 choreography.

 And there, at the edges of the green, the mouth of a hollow way. A way

 A deep-sunken lane, not wide enough for two to comfortably walk
 abreast: stumpy trees of thorn and ash, hazel and oak turn it into a
 sea-green tunnel. There are fields on either side, a bright spring
 sun, but the path slopes upwards, steeply, promising a hilltop wood.

 You've trodden this many times before. A generous way, if not an easy
 one. You could walk it in your sleep.

 Reba al-Nasri sits atop a stile, balancing an improbably-sized crock
 on one knee.

 A sky perfectly clear, moonless, cream-thick with stars. Air agreeably

 that you catch starlit glimpses of its floor. And the horizon, gods, a
 horizon densely studded with islands and islets, a horizon that will
 go as far as you need it to. The little wedding-punt will serve.

 This is not a way you have any feel for at all - walking is in your

 A landing, quite ordinary, dim and unhealthy-looking in the manner of
 something institutional from in the post-war decades. A staircase goes
 down, double-doors lead this way and that, two others lead up in
 different directions.

 And each will lead to another staircase, and another, a door, a
 landing. The labyrinth at Minos was just a big building, seen through
 the eyes of uncultured Greeks for whom a three-room house was a
 palace: the Stairways and Doorways are that sense of mazed awe, the
 feeling that the corridors might go on forever, the wildwood in the
 dorm block.

 Very casually, as if there is nothing strange about the situation at

 quite under their own volition, they're following the dead man out of

 You hurry to the window; in the pale morning light, the graveyard soil

 Most obviously it's concerned with escapism, exile, and with the Wood.
 The wood touches every part of Ombrosa, yet it is not Ombrosa. Cosimo
 is a sort of fairy, an inhabitant of a land adjacent but fundamentally
 separate; thus able to retain a certain attitude of youth. The bargain
 he makes is an end in itself, not a temporary sojourn in the
 wilderness; unlike Mowgli or Crusoe, he is not destined, nor is he
 willing, to return to an ordained place in civilised society - about
 which Calvino, unlike Defoe or Kipling, is generally pessimistic, yet
 Cosimo's exile is in some limited senses a triumph, not a reduction.
 It's a book tied to the age of profound disappointment that follows an
 age of idealism, particularly intellectual idealism.

 You could expand at length upon this to unpack the significance to
 post-WW2 Italy, to mid-C20th socialism, to the relationship between
 sainted hermit and ivory-tower intellectual, to clade
 non-interventionism, and to your own special turmoils; but you have
 more pressing objectives.

 It's sort of a mixture between a hotel lobby and a singles bar, just
 in terms of how it's laid out; there's a lot of wine-red velvet drapes
 and abstract erotic photography, just in case anybody was confused
 about it being a sex club, but really it's not as tacky as that
 sounds. The light's soft and distributed, and somehow the infographic
 posters not-so-discreetly positioned all over the place produce a kind
 of Toulouse-Lautrec feel rather than the sense that you're here to do
 something akin to buying a house or undergoing major surgery. There's
 a balcony section above, around which are distributed windowed booths.

>examine posters

 You see nothing special about the infographic posters.

 A memory:

 In Masdita you almost never saw a woman outside without a man or
 several other women. Every girl above the age of five or so wore long
 skirts, and hats above about twelve. But nobody took exception to the
 two of you wandering around in shorts and going all goopy-eyed over
 one another. You vaguely ascribed it to genial tolerance of the
 strangeness of outsiders (which was, in other respects, true: they had
 a strong hospitality code and a deep appreciation of the ridiculous),
 but once you started paying attention it became clear that they were
 decidedly unhumourous on the subject.

>use critic

 There's obviously some subtext to the bracelets everyone's wearing. A
 code, there. If you had the time and the inclination to try and pick
 up here, it'd be highly useful.

>examine bracelets

 Can't be decoration; they're too varied. A code.

>examine balcony

 It's really just a walkway to connect to the second-floor booths, but
 since it's also a good point for visibility, a good number of people
 are loitering around up there.

>examine booths

 Each booth is a small room - a little larger than a double bed -
 separated by from the main room by a door, a window, and a curtain. In
 about two-thirds of the occupied booths, the curtains are closed; the
 remaining third might arouse more of your interest given less
 stressful circumstances.

>examine people

 A variable and polite bunch, mostly mid-twenties to mid-forties. Too
 ethnically diverse for almost anywhere on Earth; you suspect this is
 mostly drawn from Upside. The disconnect between those dressed in high
 fetish gear and those who look as if they're just on a low-key night
 out is a lot odder than the minority who are just naked.

 Nobody is <span class="floydstyle em">quite</span> naked, though; everyone's right arm contains
 a variety of coloured metal bracelets.

>examine me

 You're in a voluminous, ankle-length dressing-gown of padded silk, the
 sort of thing a leading man might wear at breakfast in a 30s comedy.

 They may think it's light entertainment to threaten your life and
 treat your private relationships as the field for a stupid game, but
 the Rebeccas have at least the basic decency to not drop you naked

 You're on a village green: in England, or something very close to it.
 It's a flawless day in late spring, a blue sky dappled with lazy white
 clouds, air clean, crisp and just on the pleasant side of cool. Fresh
 green all over the trees, including the big dancing-lime spreading its
 shade over the green's heart. And evidently someone decided that the

 amidst a rustic and jubilant crowd, dancing with more enthusiasm than

 It's sort of a mixture between a hotel lobby and a singles bar, just

 and abstract erotic photography, just in case anybody was confused
 about it being a sex club, but really it's not as tacky as that
 sounds. The light's soft and distributed, and somehow the infographic
 posters not-so-discreetly positioned all over the place produce a kind
 of Toulouse-Lautrec feel rather than the sense that you're here to do
 something akin to buying a house or undergoing major surgery. There's

>examine window

 (the Masdita window)
 Her room in the boarding-house in Masdita was a shoebox - a comfy,
 clean shoebox, sure, but the one grand thing was this window, old
 carved wood with little geometric insets around the edges. It was high
 enough that from the bed all you could see was the sky, broken up by
 the highest branches of a pepper-tree. On the last week, which neither
 of you knew was the last week, the week after you abandoned the
 separate room, you'd lie in bed and watch the morning sun angle across
 the room. (The mornings were always gloriously sunny in Masdita.
 Weather like clockwork.) The pepper-tree was popular with songbirds,
 too early and too loud. You can't remember what any of them sounded
 like.

 What does she like? So much of your time together was spent in places
 where food was just fuel. Coffee, absolutely. Citrus: in Masdita she
 ate grapefruit and oranges at every chance she could. Otherwise,
 usually not sweet things. Awful beer, let's not go down that road
 <span class="floydstyle em">just</span> this moment. Something cold. As you're thinking, you're
 popping open every bottle in sequence, pouring just a few drops:
 sniff, sip, rinse and spit. (If anyone objects to your indecorous use
 of a spare bus tray as a spitoon, they can go fuck themselves.) The
 first three taste of... nothing you've had before, definitely acquired
 tastes. The fourth is a sickly fake-hazelnut thing. You wrinkle your
 nose and spit with gusto.

 Before you've moved more than three feet down the rows, your tastebuds
 are no longer to be trusted, but an idea's formed: a couple of fingers
 of the crisp, faintly-fruity clear stuff, one of the golden thing that
 <span class="floydstyle em">might</span> be pear brandy, a lemon's worth of juice, a muddle of
 those aromatic herbs, stir in ice, strain. Not going to win any awards
 for originality, but hopefully not something you'd send back. You
 place it lightly before her.

 Her eyes go hooded for a moment after the first sip, then go to you,
 smiling. "Yeah, that should do it."

 Her hand's lying, palm-up, on the bar. You move to touch it.

 The nausea has been at a low background level for a while; you
 expected it to come back, but this is like being in a car-crash.
 Holding up fine one moment, then <span class="floydstyle em">snap</span>, knocked reeling.
 You're throwing up before you realise it's coming, almost breathe it
 in, undergo some truly revolting coughing and spluttering for a few
 moments. By the time you've spat out the last of it, though, the
 adrenalin has kicked in and you feel vastly better. Bile mouth,
 watering eyes, still kind of dizzy, but solid and alive.

>examine rivka

 The dark hides it at first, but she's naked except for a mane of hair
 that sweeps down, like a cloak or a waterfall, to below her gripping
 feet. The limbs that emerge from it are death-white, model-thin, with
 fingers and toes too long to be human. Her lips tweak in a dreamy
 smile, but you sense fangs beneath.

 A memory:

 You'd come off a particularly lousy patrol, and the depot was just on
 the other side of the river; but the river was swollen with unseasonal
 rain, and had turned from a clear sheet of water a stone's throw broad
 to a turbid chocolate torrent, full of broken-off trees. It was still
 raining. A couple of grunts had taken noncritical wounds in a
 skirmish, but more to the point, the antifungals supplied by command
 were about as effective as talcum powder, so you were all itching
 furiously in inconvenient places. You had fuel and ration bars and
 tents, so there was nothing to do but wait; and everyone knew that as
 soon as command spotted you setting up camp, they'd be starting the
 clock on your four days off. Nothing to do but sit and itch and stink
 until the water went down, cheek-by-jowl with a bunch of exhausted,
 grouchy grunts.

 Jave was just about the only reason why the group didn't disintegrate
 by the second day. She sat quietly, did stretches, and made tea. She
 didn't lose her temper when a brawl broke out among the grunts, and
 she didn't run herself ragged trying to figure out a fording method
 that was, plainly, never going to work. And somehow her calm
 transferred to the rest of you, and made it all <span class="floydstyle em">endurably</span>
 shitty.

 underfoot, soft and damp. There are no paths here, not so much as a
 rabbit-trail: but a wanderer among the trees will always find
 <span class="floydstyle em">something</span>, sooner or later.

 Nobody is entirely comfortable with it, but every walker has to deal

 You'd describe her outfit here as Elven Druid Princess. There's a
 muted palette of pale greens and browns (her eyes have shifted emerald
 to match), a lot of leaf-themed cut-outs and vaguely-Celtic jewelry,
 and a skirt that's part fairytale-wedding and part ghillie-suit.
 Setting aside that it'd last three seconds of actual woodland travel
 before being snagged and muddied and torn, those boots are essentially
 a blister factory. She would look very spirit-of-the-forest in a

 Well, fine, fuck it. You can't dance, and you're not going to be able
 to figure out how this one works in a hurry, but this is all basically
 just footwork, right? Footwork you can do.

 As you're handed off from one partner to another, you put your hands
 behind your back, hook one foot behind his, step into him, and shift
 your bodyweight just so. No hands required: not expecting anything of
 the kind, he goes down smartly onto his rear. You translate the motion
 into a broad turn, scanning the room. <span class="floydstyle em">There she is.</span> You turn
 through the dance. It throws another partner at you - you evade her,
 sweeping around to the far side of another couple. You're getting some
 really good glares now, but without a partner you can position
 yourself far more easily.

 Interception. You judge the next arc of movement correctly, get a grip
 on her partner's upper hand. Then it's just the right twist to  peel
 him off her and away and down to his knees, and a step to rejoin her,
 hand to her waist, and <span class="floydstyle em">there.</span>

 She's trying not to crack up. "You'll spoil the party."

 "I think it's made to ruin itself. Look, if we get separated, meet up
 at the -"

 "Wait, who's leading?" You've slowed to a sort of skippy shuffle.
 Well, if you don't know how to do this, why did you think that she
 would?
 would?
 The music's quality has shifted somehow, grown... more full-spectrum,
 is the only way you can describe it, like maybe a complete orchestra
 snuck up and progressively infiltrated a string quartet. Faster, too,
 rising towards an ever-delayed crescendo. The dancers are speeding up:
 a woman trips on her skirts, goes down, you're whirled away and don't
 see what happens to her. You can't tell if those are masks or the
 actual faces of the dancers any more. There's no ceiling, no walls,
 just a floor surrounded by darkness, and you know that as soon as the
 dance ends -

 You're aware of Jave at your elbow. A hand brushes lightly up your
 forearm, and it takes you a minute to recognise your old signal:
 <span class="floydstyle em">this is your bailiwick, take lead.</span> Not strictly part of the
 code, but implicit: <span class="floydstyle em">I trust you</span>.

>dance

 No time. You should really be getting the hell out of here.

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wedding on the Water</span>
 A still and starry night. You're amongst a chaotic flotilla of
 smallish pleasure-boats, their masts and rails all hung with lights.
 Beyond the clustered vessels, inky-dark water reflects the more
 distant lights of a city, on three sides: a lake or a bay. The boats
 are full of people in suits and gowns, chattering fit to burst.

 Outside the shelter of land, the sea at the bay mouth is dark and
 inviting.

 Rivka Strossi appears to be a priest, moving among the guests with
 smiles and nods.

 The tangle extends to the north to The Pleasant Month of May, south to
 Solitaire With Friends and Outside to the Wine-Dark Sea.

 Bubbles burst on the still lake surface - first marble-sized, then
 larger and larger, bringing with them the stench of anaerobic mud. The
 guests make disgusted noises, and one boat turns for shore. And then
 one of the boats cracks in half and abruptly goes under, too fast to
 have swamped. The water's full of splashing people, and everyone on
 the boats is shouting, and then you spot the first tentacle.

 It's black as the black water, and covered in barnacles, and the
 portion you can see is about the size of a small commuter train.

 Jave has made it through after you.

>go south

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Solitaire With Friends</span>
 A comfortably cluttered room: warm but clear lighting, lots of
 shelves. You're seated with a half-dozen others around what is
 probably a dining table, and on the dining table is spread out a
 board-game with approximately a billion pieces. Beer-bottles have
 competed ineffectively for real estate, and are relegated to
 precarious edges.

 Rivka Strossi is seated opposite you. She has a great many more cards
 in hand than anyone else.

 The tangle extends to the east to Parallel Crunch and west to
 Function.

 The player opposite you cracks his knuckles. "Endgame."

 The rules change. Armies crawl of their own volition across the map,
 meet and consume one another. A cluster of fire-blossoms burst across
 one stretch of the map; in another, an inland sea bursts a channel
 into the ocean. A vast serpent drags itself from the sea, scattering
 pieces before it.

 The room has been replaced by darkness. The other players are lit only
 by the light of the world spreading below: jackal-head, skull, empty
 hood, lion.

 There are fewer and fewer pieces. You don't want to find out what
 happens when one of them wins.

 Jave's still with you.

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wedding on the Water</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>out

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wine-Dark Sea</span>
 A sky perfectly clear, moonless, cream-thick with stars. Air agreeably
 cool, suggesting a warm day to come. Below, water so clear and shallow
 that you catch starlit glimpses of its floor. And the horizon, gods, a
 horizon densely studded with islands and islets, a horizon that will
 go as far as you need it to. The little wedding-punt will serve.

 This is not a way you have any feel for at all - walking is in your
 blood, rivers you can handle, but trackless open water loses you. But
 unlike the Great Open Sea, you love this place as a strangeway, a road
 that's always fresh because you'll never understand it.

 Reba al-Nasri sits quietly in the prow, turned half-away, fingertips
 trailing in the water.

 Jave is seated at the middle of the craft, facing sternwards.

>talk to jave

 "Are you OK?"

 "Yeh. Little shocky. I'll be fine."

 "We're still in range of the tangle, I think - keep moving?"

 "Sure."

>out

 The water laps softly at your prow, and the sky teems with unfamiliar
 constellations. Jave slips one hand into yours, which makes the going
 a little slower, but who fucking cares.

 You might walk together for a month, or a few days, or years. But
 that's not something you have to worry about just yet. You know that
 you can talk, now, and that matters a lot more than what gets said.



     *** On and up. ***
