>go up


 You nimbly scamper up the tree. As you climb, you hear their howls of
 delight from the base of the tree, for they know they have you now.
 Nevertheless, you keep climbing. You pass the occasional bird perched
 on the limbs of the tree, and the birds get more and more numerous as
 you ascend. You feel the tree shake as, far below, they begin
 attacking it with an axe. Higher and higher you climb, and the birds
 become more and more numerous. The birds start to fly over to you,
 perching on your shoulders, your head, your legs. You pick up speed as
 the birds add their swiftness to yours. You hear a loud
 <span class="floydstyle em">CRACK!</span> as the tree starts to fall, but you have reached the
 top, and you are covered in birds. You leap. You do not fall. You
 soar.

 You take the form of wind and flee to the north, home of the fiercest
 winds. You hope to blend in and not be found. But they know these
 ways. Their winds pursue you, swirling around and around you. You
 become disoriented, unsure of the direction. And they keep on you,
 never letting you rest.

 make your stand, and you turn to face them. You rip off your shirt and
 give your best warrior cry. As they come at you in hordes, you deliver
 devastating throat-punches, furious fists-of-fire, and rapid
 roundhouse-rights. The bodies pile up, but they keep coming. The end

 You flee to the large city to the east, hoping to lose yourself among

 you won't be hassled. You find shelter in the city, and eventually a
 job, even pleasure. Life settles into a comfortable routine. Then you
 make a mistake and return to your old habits. Never having given up
 searching for you, they sense it. After all this time, they are on to

 going through your deep-breathing exercises, but nothing can prepare
 your the magical heat of this chili. As it travels down your throat,
 you are consumed by fire. You become fire. And not a moment too soon.
 They have tracked you, and they are burning the forest down to find
 you. You will show them what fire is. You feed on the surrounding
 grove, and then the larger forest. You consume their bodies, all of
 them, but by then it's too late. You cannot help reaching out farther,
 consuming more and more. It is endless. It is fire. It is over.

 You're relaxing at home, adjusting your deer stalker when you hear
 knocking on what sounds like a wooden wall coming from the row of five
 houses opposite your own. You can't quite recall which of your
 neighbours has woodworking as a hobby. Fortunately you remember that
 each house has a unique colour and the owners have a unique name, have
 a unique nationality, play a different preferred IF game and have a
 different hobby. You also remember these facts pertaining to your
 neighbours:


   1.  Shepherd is Galician.
 2.  The person who is Italian is directly to the left of the person
 who is Norwegian.
   3.  The person who is Italian has a Teal House.
 4.  The person who likes juggling lives next to the person who plays
 Violet.
   5.  River lives in the first house.
   6.  Fessel plays The Chinese Room.
   7.  The person who plays Curses has a Navy House.
   8.  The person who is Bulgarian plays Violet.
 9.  The person who plays Colossal Cave Adventure has a neighbour who
 has a White House.
 10.  Moriarty has a Black House.
 11.  The person living in the centre house has a Fuchsia House.
 12.  River lives next to the person who is Turkish.
 13.  Smith likes dancing.
 14.  The person who plays Colossal Cave Adventure lives next to the
 person who likes boating.
 15.  The person who plays Aotearoa likes camping.

 So, who is knocking on the wall?

>Fessel


 You head confidently over to the row of houses and see someone working
 on a wooden wall and making knocking sounds in the process. It is of
 course Fessel, as you so rightly predicted! Once you have ruled out
 the impossible, whatever woodworker that remains, however improbable,
 must be the one.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside The Garden Mart</span>
 I'm outside the garden mart, in between that old cadillac and the
 window where I work. Just walking along, east to west, nothing to see
 here. I'm real glad I'm all alone, all by myself.

>examine me


 I'm, well, I'm me, right? Nothing special. I've taken off my ugly red
 uniform and I'm wearing the same jeans from three Christmases ago and
 that jumper that Granny gave me.

>inventory


 I am carrying:
   a lighter
   a pair of jeans (being worn)
   a hideous sweater (being worn)
   some flat shoes (being worn)
   some lots of cash

>steal cadillac


 Now's the moment! I smash the window, climb in and fiddle with the
 wires below the wheel like Cousin Vinnie showed me. It roars into life
 and I'm free, out on the open road.

 The footsteps behind you seem to be getting louder, closer, as you
 run.  You're reaching the end of your breath, legs burning with the
 effort.  You don't know if you should keep running or stop, wait here
 or even turn around and fight.

 <span class="floydstyle i">You get the feeling your next move is the defining point of your</span>

 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroad</span>
 The road rolls on in front of you.  To the north the road continues,
 to the east, a set of stairs descends and there is a doorway to the
 west.  Make your move wisely, you only get one.

 You're carrying nothing but your ideas of linear storytelling, which
 you drop immediately.  Also this blue thing.  What's it doing here?

>open blue


 That's not something you can open.

>throw blue


 The blue thing is already here.

>go north


 You keep running, it feel like you've hit some sort of wall, and the
 footsteps behind you are getting closer.  But then you see it, the
 finish line, a bright blue banner just ahead.  You put on a burst of
 speed, ignoring the screaming of your legs, the pain in your lungs and
 make it.  A split second later, the owner of the footsteps that dogged
 yours for the last half mile crosses the line behind you.   Although
 second place is not so shabby, she looks glum and you feel embarassed
 and a little guilty.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Each step takes you in a completely new direction.  Here's another</span>
 go at a fresh world.



>go west


 You try the doorknob on the roughly painted door and find it locked.
 In panic, you shove it hard and the lock releases, the door squealing
 open to reveal a darkened hallway.  You slam the door shut again and
 listen, pressing your ear to the wood as the pounding footsteps go by.
 You breathe a sigh of relief and look in the bag you've been
 clutching, all the way from the jewelry store.  In the dim light of an
 emergency exit electric bulb, it's hard to see what's in there, but it
 doesn't look, or feel right.  You pull out a strand of what you
 thought were pearls but to your fingers, they're clearly made of
 plastic.  What were supposed to be gold chains are suspiciously light.
 And something in the bag is blinking a tiny blue light.  You realize
 it's some sort of tracker when you hear the footsteps return.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Each step takes you in a completely new direction.  Here's another</span>
 go at a fresh world.



>go east


 You cascade down the stairs, praying not to slip on the steps, wet
 from last night's rain, hoping there's someone staffing the subway
 entrance.  A quick look over your shoulder shows that the man who's
 been chasing you since you left work is still behind you, but the look
 costs you seconds as you have to grab for the handrail to keep from
 falling.  He calls out to you:  "Miss?  Miss!  You dropped your bag!"

 You stand there panting, wairly looking at the stranger as he holds a
 bag out to you.  Indeed, it looks like your purse and, now standing
 still for the moment, you notice you're not carrying yours anymore.
 Gratefully, you reach out for it.

 "Thank you," you say and take it. The man nods and jogs back up the
 stairs out of sight.  The bag is strangely heavy.  You reach inside
 and find a gun, which gleams bluely in the harsh fluorescents of the
 subway station.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Each step takes you in a completely new direction.  Here's another</span>
 go at a fresh world.



>go south


 Saying "enough is enough" to yourself, you turn and face the crowd of
 people, including your maid of honor and the man you had promised to
 marry, trailing behind you as you fled the church in your shiny silver
 heels and long white dress.

 "I'm sorry," you say to them all, "I can't go through with it."  Tears
 are flowing down your cheeks as you give back the ring to your
 intended groom, and take off the earrings belonging to your
 no-longer-to-be-mother-in-law, handing them to the maid of honor, who
 stands gaping.

 "Here's the something borrowed, you can see they get back to her."

 You take off your garter, practically groping your own leg in the
 process of worrying it off down your knee and past your shoe and throw
 it at her.  "I'm sure you'll be very happy," you scream, as the blue
 ribbon of cloth hits her hair and bounces to the ground.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Each step takes you in a completely new direction.  Here's another</span>

>go northeast


 You take off through the fields, zigzagging to avoid the occasional
 arrow what's left of the army manages to get off in your general
 direction.  Maybe you shouldn't have insulted thier leader, wasn't
 that like one of the first things they taught you in time travel
 school?

 <span class="floydstyle em">No, that was "get to the damn transfer point before the portal</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">closes."</span>

 You see the glimmer of the portal in front of you and dive toward it,
 feeling a sharp pain in your side as you fall through.  Landing hard
 on the retrieval platform increases the pain a hundredfold and you
 look down to see your blood pouring out over the shaft of a slim blue
 arrow.

 You think you're finally going fast enough.  You spread your wings and
 *WHOOSH*, the sound is nearly deafening, but you can feel your feet
 leaving the ground, dangling beneath you, before you remember to tuck
 them like you'd practiced and flap, flap, flap.

 You look down, and the crowd below has stopped running and all are
 staring up at you, waving the pitchforks and torches they were
 carrying to run you and your experiments out of town.  They are
 starting to look as small and insigificant as they are.  Ahead of you
 is only blue sky.

 There is no score in this story.

>sing


 You burst out into song, belting out "I'm your only friend, I'm not
 your only friend, but I'm a little glowing friend, but really I'm not
 actually your friend."

 When you get to the chorus, the group of people behind you join in at
 the harmony.

 songs of They Might be Giants.  Better?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Each step takes you in a completely new direction.  Here's another</span>
 go at a fresh world.



>go southwest


 The complicated shadows of the taller buildings in this part of town
 give you hope and an idea.  You double back, using a broken lamppost
 as an anchor to quickly change direction and loop around the building,
 sneaking around the side and emerging from behind the crowd as they
 pass, running as if to keep up with the stragglers in the crowd of
 cops and city folk that were chasing you after your latest exploits
 had come to light.  In the dark nobody notices, not even the people
 you're running head to head with, you're dressed alike in the the same
 kind of raggedy clothing.  As the crowd begins to disperse, making
 noises of frustration, you duck down a side street and head for one of
 your safehouses, to live to taunt the regime yet again.  In the gutter
 you see a blue kazoo, which gives you an excellent idea.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Each step takes you in a completely new direction.  Here's another</span>
 go at a fresh world.



>wait


 You hit pause and the game stops; you realize you've been playing for
 hours, so absorbed your heart really is pounding like you're being
 chased and your mouth is cottony-dry.  You stumble off to the kitchen
 and grab some gatorade, your least favorite flavor -- blue.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Each step takes you in a completely new direction.  Here's another</span>
 go at a fresh world.

 You pray.  Blue bolts from heaven strike down your enemies.  Wow!
 Should have tried that earlier.

>dance


 At the cue, synchronized watches quietly beeping, you and the rest of

 scarves around your heads as you stomp and whirl to the
 Bollywood-style music blaring from synchronized iPhones.  You can't

 You look down, and the crowd below has stopped running and all are
 staring up at you, waving the pitchforks and torches they were
 carrying to run you and your experiments out of town.  They are
 starting to look as small and insigificant as they are.  Ahead of you
 is only blue sky.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Each step takes you in a completely new direction.  Here's another</span>
 go at a fresh world.



>blue


 I don't understand you.  Perhaps you'd like to play "fingertips:  I
 don't understand you" instead.

>sing blues


 I only understood you as far as wanting to sing.

>sleep


 You wake up with a start, covered in sweat.

 Damn you hate these being-chased-in-the-dark can't-move-in-molasses
 don't-know-why-you're-running dreams.  Also, you need to pee, bad.
 Maybe next time you'll skip the jalapeno, garlic and feta toppings on
 your pizza.  You're thankful for your blue canary night light to keep
 you company at times like these.

>push blue thing


 It is fixed in place.

>smell blue


 Mostly you smell your own sweat, you've been running so long.

>listen


 You hear the noise of the crowd as they jeer at you, calling you names
 like "Smurf" and "little blue riding hood" and "meanie".  It's not
 fair!  It's not your fault you fell in the vat of dye just before your
 coming out party.  You're so embarrassed, you're never coming back to
 town again.

 What's that blue thing doing here?

>attack blue thing


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>se


 The complicated shadows of the taller buildings in this part of town
 give you hope and an idea.  You double back, using a broken lamppost
 as an anchor to quickly change direction and loop around the building,
 sneaking around the side and emerging from behind the crowd as they
 pass, running as if to keep up with the stragglers in the crowd of
 cops and city folk that were chasing you after your latest exploits
 had come to light.  In the dark nobody notices, not even the people
 you're running head to head with, you're dressed alike in the the same
 kind of raggedy clothing.  As the crowd begins to disperse, making
 noises of frustration, you duck down a side street and head for one of
 your safehouses, to live to taunt the regime yet again.  In the gutter
 you see a blue kazoo, which gives you an excellent idea.

>bother


 Quite.

>touch blue


 You feel nothing unexpected.

>buy blue thing


 Nothing is on sale.

>throw blue


 The blue thing is already here.

>think


 As you run, you're doing as complex of math calculations in your head
 as you can, it's the only way you can keep the telepaths behind you
 from knowing which direction you're planning to run.
