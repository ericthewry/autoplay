 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.




 All around the city now, parties are taking place. It's been a hell of
 a year, emphasis on hell.

 But tonight, there are other things you have to do. The end of the year
 is a threshold. And like all thresholds...

 Safehouse Aleph
 All the units in this old building have been divided and subdivided
 until they're dangerously cramped.  The apartment is much as you found
 it; a year is not so long, and you'll be gone soon.

 You can see an engraved wastebasket (empty), a cardboard box (empty), a
 desk (on which are a handkerchief, a tallow candle, the keener
 fragment, a goathorn piece, a shred of fabric, a broken propeller, a
 pint glass, and a trapped butterfly), and a chair here.

>score

 There is no score in this story.

>examine box

 Just a cardboard box you salvaged from the bodega down the street.
 Using paint made from wormwood and lead, you've marked it with a sigil
 meant to keep its contents safe in transit.

 <span class="floydstyle em">For packing in the things you want to keep.</span>

>examine desk

 A cheap writing desk out of a flatpack. There's not even drawers.

 On the desk are a handkerchief, a tallow candle, the keener fragment,
 a goathorn piece, a shred of fabric, a broken propeller, a pint glass,
 and a trapped butterfly.

>examine wormwood

 <span class="floydstyle em">(That thing is either not here, or you don't need to refer it over</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the course of the story.)</span>

>look under desk

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine chair

 You salvaged this one out of a bistro that was about to close.

>inventory

 You are carrying nothing.

>get chair

 That's fixed in place.

>sit

 What do you want to sit on?

>chair

 You get onto the chair.

>examine handkerchief

 An ordinary grey pocket square. You keep it on hand; it's useful for
 handling things you'd rather not touch with bare skin.

>examine candle

 Made from tallow, with the dried optical nerve of a cow serving as the
 wick. It burns unevently with a purple-white flame; it does not smell
 great. The candle connects sight to memory and allows things to carry
 echoes of their history.

>examine fragment

 It has no discernible physical shape. It's just a sullen, faded lump
 of hatred, held together by its own surface tension, still radiating
 horror.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You can TOUCH most things to learn more about them.)</span>

>examine piece

 A memento from twenty-odd years ago. <span class="floydstyle em">Gods, it's been that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">long.</span> Its divine power is certainly faded, but you still hold on
 to it for good luck. And, in all honesty, because gods have a bad
 habit of being reborn from their pieces.

>touch candle

 You don't want to disturb it while it's burning. For all you know,
 touching it might bring on a vision of the cow being slaughtered.

>examine fabric

 A torn shred of thick synthetic material that someone carefully scored
 into a pattern that resembles feathers, or maybe scales.

>examine propeller

 The broken half of a small propeller made out of some carbon
 composite; taken from the remains of a destroyed police drone.

>touch fabric

 (first taking the shred of fabric)
 (first taking the handkerchief)
 You gingerly take the shred of fabric with the handkerchief.

 You grab hold of the shred of fabric with your bare hand, and your
 vision swims for a lingering instant...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vision: Rooftop, Sweltering</span>
 Just after sunset, several stories up, still radiating the heat of the
 day. A streak of blood runs across the edge of the building.

>examine blood

 A curved, triangular splatter. Not a gunshot; a fist. But produced
 with abnormal force.

>examine building

 <span class="floydstyle em">(That thing is either not here, or you don't need to refer it over</span>

 You are carrying:
   a shred of fabric (held with your bare hand)
   a handkerchief

 <span class="floydstyle em">(Once you are done here, you can LET GO to return.)</span>

>go down

 You are in a phantom of the past, a congealed instant; you can only
 sense the world around you, or let go of a shred of fabric to escape.

>smell

 Garbage baking in the sun all the way down in street-level; the ozone
 promise of rain in the air.

>listen

 You hear nothing unexpected.

>examine glass

 Which do you mean, the pint glass or the trapped butterfly?

>pint

 A pint glass, the conical kind with a flared bulge towards the top.
 Faded lettering on the side spells out "Herrig's."

>examine butterfly

 A viceroy butterfly, perpetually flying laps inside a glass torus.
 Breaking it out of its little time loop would have vast and
 far-reaching consequences, just like doing literally anything else.
 But figuring out what those consequences are for a given time and
 place is a daunting task of divination.

 You gingerly take the trapped butterfly with the handkerchief.

 You grab hold of the trapped butterfly with your bare hand, and your
 vision swims for a lingering instant...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vision: Shop, Cramped</span>
 The back door is still swinging where the shopkeeper went in to fetch
 something; the front door is caught closing as a customer walks away.
 The item in your hand remembers, particularly, this tiny instant of
 quiet between two doors slamming after an unwelcome visit, before
 everything went to hell.

 All around you, the shelves are filled with a panoply of bizarre
 artifacts.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vision: Warehouse, Exploding</span>
 A mess of fire and debris, stopped mid-detonation.

>smell

 Not like black powder, not like cordite. Acrid and sharp like some
 kind of high explosive.

>listen

 You hear nothing unexpected.

>examine fire

 High-speed chunks of aluminum and composite polymers, turned into
 expensive shrapnel; the remains of police drones, and maybe a fragment

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vision: Bar, Silent</span>
 Rain on the windows turns the world outside into a yellowy haze;
 upturned chairs rest on wooden tables.

 And over the counter, a note changes hands between a bartender and a
 patron.

>examine note

 A napkin with an address scrawled on. It corresponds to a peculiar
 shop downtown.

>examine bartender

 Rough, tall, bulky; like everything in his bar he looks like he's made
 out of hardwood and old magic.

>examine patron

 Average in build but oddly sharp-eyed; you notice her undercut, though
 most of her is fuzzy. Whatever magic she's been tampering with has
 given her so much of an aura that she seems to vibrate in the air,
 there-and-not-there. And you know she isn't done, yet.

 A god of living goats and dead fish, caught in this place trying to

 You put the pint glass into the box. It has sentimental value. Plus,
 it's hard to get another one given that Herrig kind of despises you.

>get butterfly

 You gingerly take the trapped butterfly with the handkerchief.

>put butterfly in box

 You put the trapped butterfly into the box. Sure, in retrospect this
 is hardly the most useful thing to grab and run out of a fire in a
 magic shop, but hindsight is 20/20.

 There; it's done. You've picked what to keep and what to discard from
 the past. A cleaner entry into another year of struggle.

 Nobody has fun on new year's eve anyway; the pressure is too much. So
 you might as well spend it choosing what to take and what to leave
 behind. A year in this city has shown you enough things that you'd
 rather not have seen.

 You light a cigarette while you wait out the last few moments. You
 don't hear the <span class="floydstyle em">snap</span> of the wastebasket vanishing into thin
 air at midnight; it's drowned out by the crackle of fireworks outside.
 But you smell ozone in the air, and feel the telltale vibration of
 something ceasing to exist.

 it; a year is not so long, and you'll be gone soon.

 You can see an engraved wastebasket (in which are a broken propeller,
 a shred of fabric, and the keener fragment), a cardboard box (in which
 are a pint glass and a goathorn piece), a desk (on which is a tallow
 candle), and a chair here.

>blow candle

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>turn off candle

 You don't want to disturb it while it's burning. For all you know,
 touching it might bring on a vision of the cow being slaughtered.

>enter wastebasket

 That's not something you can enter.

>get basket

 You would really, <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> rather not be holding it when it
 goes off.

 This dangerous act would achieve little.

>get box

 You'll carry it out soon enough.

>enter box

 You don't need to concern yourself with the cardboard box; it's
 actually perfectly ordinary.

>listen

 You hear nothing unexpected.
>put handkerchief in basket


 You don't need to concern yourself with the handkerchief; it's
 actually perfectly ordinary.

>smell

 Normally you keep the place pretty clean and thus neutral-scented, but
 the candle is burning in here right now.

>put candle in basket

 You'll dispose of the candle properly once it's done burning.

>put basket in box

 You don't need to concern yourself with the engraved wastebasket; it's
 actually perfectly ordinary.

 You don't need to concern yourself with yourself; it's actually
 perfectly ordinary.

 It's an ordinary wastebasket, a cylinder of black aluminum. But
 wrapped around it is a complex pattern in silver thread that makes
 your eyes defocus if you try to follow it.

 All the units in this old building have been divided and subdivided
 until they're dangerously cramped.  The apartment is much as you found
 it; a year is not so long, and you'll be gone soon.

 You can see an engraved wastebasket (empty), a cardboard box (in which
 are a pint glass and a goathorn piece), a desk (on which are a shred
 of fabric, a broken propeller, a trapped butterfly, and a tallow
 candle), and a chair here.

>put propeller in box. put fragment in box. put fabric in box.

 (first taking the broken propeller)
 (first putting the keener fragment back on the desk)
 You gingerly take the broken propeller with the handkerchief.

 You put the broken propeller into the box. Might as well keep it; it's
 not like you're not basically made out of incriminating evidence.

 (first taking the keener fragment)
 You gingerly take the keener fragment with the handkerchief.

 You put the keener fragment into the box. You're loathe to keep it,
 but it might still lead you back to where the original keener was
 made... or to the person who used it.

 (first taking the shred of fabric)
 You gingerly take the shred of fabric with the handkerchief.

 You put the shred of fabric into the box. Shreds of clothing are
 usually not that useful as sympathetic tokens, but this one has
 special significance. Maybe you should keep it as insurance. Just in
 case your friend gets out of line.

>put butterfly in box

 (first taking the trapped butterfly)
 You gingerly take the trapped butterfly with the handkerchief.

 You put the trapped butterfly into the box. Sure, in retrospect this
 is hardly the most useful thing to grab and run out of a fire in a
 magic shop, but hindsight is 20/20.

 In the end, you're too much of a pack rat to really leave anything
 behind. Particularly in such a definitive way. But it's the exercise
 of choosing that counts; if you're going to carry all those memories
 along with you, let it be because you think they matter.

 Nobody has fun on new year's eve anyway; the pressure is too much. So
 you might as well spend it choosing what to take and what to leave
 behind. A year in this city has shown you enough things that you'd
 rather not have seen.

 You light a cigarette while you wait out the last few moments. You
 don't hear the <span class="floydstyle em">snap</span> of the wastebasket vanishing into thin
 air at midnight; it's drowned out by the crackle of fireworks outside.
 But you smell ozone in the air, and feel the telltale vibration of
 something ceasing to exist.

>examine box

 Just a cardboard box you salvaged from the bodega down the street.
 Using paint made from wormwood and lead, you've marked it with a sigil
 meant to keep its contents safe in transit.

 In the cardboard box are a shred of fabric, the keener fragment, a
 broken propeller, a pint glass, and a goathorn piece.

 You gingerly take the shred of fabric with the handkerchief.

 You put the shred of fabric into the wastebasket. That case is closed,

 (first taking the keener fragment)
 You gingerly take the keener fragment with the handkerchief.

 You put the keener fragment into the wastebasket. You'll be really
 glad to be rid of this thing; even in pieces, those have a mind of
 their own. You could never track down who made the original device,
 anyway, from just this small piece.

 (first taking the broken propeller)
 You gingerly take the broken propeller with the handkerchief.

 You put the broken propeller into the wastebasket. I mean, it's really
 just mundane trash, but you kept it for a while as a reminder that
 they're not invincible.

 You gingerly take the pint glass with the handkerchief.

 You put the pint glass into the wastebasket. To be quite honest,
 you're not sure if these are even enchanted. You nicked one hoping it
 had some kind of self-cleaning charm on it, but no such luck.

>put goathorn in wastebasket

 (first taking the goathorn piece)
 You gingerly take the goathorn piece with the handkerchief.

 You put the goathorn piece into the wastebasket. You've told that
 story a couple of times now, but maybe it's time to bury that body;
 the old fish-goat still shows up ever so often in your nightmares,
 crying about the concept of cheese.

>put butterfly in wastebasket

 You gingerly take the trapped butterfly with the handkerchief.

 You put the trapped butterfly into the wastebasket. It's kind of sad
 destroying this, since it's one of a kind, but it's also useless and
 bizarrely cruel.

 It's been, in the ways that count, and awful year. Nobody will blame
 you for throwing out what little good there is, along with all the
 bad. You try not to let your mind form the words "fresh start"; there
 has never been one, and never will be.

 A Cape side story by Bruno Dias
 Release 2 / Serial number 151224 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Closing Time (behind the bar)</span>
 It's five to three on the last Saturday before Christmas; the green
 glass light fixtures hanging over the bar have been dimmed, dirty
 frost speckles the windows, and the hazy scent of alcoholic vomit
 emanating from the toilets has subdued to a minor note in the far
 background of the olfactory panoply that fills Herrig's.

 The last few regulars left in the place have coalesced into a single
 group, huddled around the corner table.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You can complete this story with only the verbs EXAMINE, WAIT,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and INTERJECT when prompted; type NOTES at any time to read the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">author's note.)</span>

>examine regulars


 There's Skóa, of course, with the hat; and Jamessin smoking sullenly
 in the corner. Chow reads quietly in her wide chair, silently enjoying
 the presence of her friends Ramos (with the centipede familiar) and
 Grin (with the oversized scarf).

 The floorboards crack and pop underfoot.

>examine centipede


 A tube of flesh hidden beneath an armature of mottled red and black,
 studded with numerous sharp yellow legs, clinging to Ramos' shoulder
 and neck like the worst/greatest feather boa. Sometimes it taps his
 collarbone with one of its scraping limbs, as though to remind him of
 something.

 A cat perches outside one of the windows, then disappears again.

>examine hat


 You force your eyes to focus on the hat for a moment: It's shaped like
 an abstract paper chrysanthemum, perched on her head at an improbable
 angle. It moves, not with the drafty air inside the bar but of its own
 volition, like a breathing flower.

 The floorboards crack and pop underfoot.

>examine scarf


 It's pretty much ever color at one point or another; it looks very
 much like someone finished a scarf, then just started the next one by
 continuing that same scarf, several times over, until they had a beast
 that resembled six or seven different scarves joined end to end into a
 cozy chimera.

 A cat perches outside one of the windows, then disappears again.

 The door swings open to let someone in from the outside; given the
 hour, and the events of the last few days, you can't help but set your
 fingers behind the bar into an unpleasant pattern, readying some curse
 or another. But then you see the man's face and your apprehension is
 replaced by mild annoyance.

 "We're closed," you say.

 "Didn't come here to drink," he replies, giving you the look that
 tells you he's about to rope you into something.

>examine me


 Much like the bar: A little rough around the edges, a little worse for
 wear.

 The table of regulars laughs together; except, of course, for Grin.

 You fail to contain a sigh. "Why are you even here?"

 "Oh, just having a look at the old place. Didn't know that I would
 still find it." He talks with an odd lilt that you've been told is
 Welsh.

 "What's that supposed to mean?"

>examine grin


 So named because he doesn't. Grin likes to hang around, listen, figure
 out where the wind is blowing. He has a tendency to disappear for
 weeks at a time. Other than that, all you know about him is that he's
 from someplace warmer than Yeats; right now, in the middle of winter,
 his head barely pokes out of the enormous scarf wrapped several times
 around his neck and face.

 Skóa takes a drink out of her glass.

 "Didn't half the wizards in this city get killed or worse last year?"

 You shrug. "They weren't my customers."

 "Still. Must have been some trouble."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You could INTERJECT here)</span>

>examine man


 (Ainsley)
 Ainsley is one of those people who always looks like he's lost weight,
 skin hanging slightly too loose off his bones like there used to be
 more of him; but you've never seem him any thicker. Maybe he puffs up
 when he's back across the ocean where he's from. Wears a
 professorial-looking argyle sweater vest and a calculated two-day
 nonbeard. Though you've never seen him do actual magic, of all the
 joints in all the cities in the world he likes to roll into yours,
 once every few months, when he's in town.

 Ramos nods silently in response to some unseen signal or message from
 his familiar.

 "Come on, Ainsley," you say, getting plainly frustrated now. "Just
 tell me what this is about."

 He cocks his head and stares you down curiously, for a moment. And
 then he pulls out a slightly oversized phone. He flips through
 pictures of what looks like a blur smeared against the night sky;
 after a few of them, though, it resolves itself in your mind as a
 vaguely human figure, leaping across rooftops; or maybe flying. You
 can't quite tell.

 "You wouldn't happen to know anything about this, would you?"

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You could INTERJECT here)</span>

>interject


 "Yeah, okay. There's some rumors going around. A lot of them. The
 incident with the keener left a bit of a power vacuum. What was left
 of the cabal is now wrestling to see who comes out on top. Let's just
 say I don't cross the bridges no more."

 "I can imagine."

 "So there's this person going around Blaise sending people to the
 hospital. Some people think it's just a weird mundane in a costume,
 some people think it's a player. Fucked if I know how to get in touch,
 though."

 He purses his lips; the smell of Jamessin's cigarette must be giving
 him cravings.

 "Better than nothing, at least. Thanks."

 The table of regulars laughs together; except, of course, for Grin.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a rag
   a crow cameo

 Ramos takes a drink out of his glass.

 "What's your real angle here?"

 "Trouble back home. I'm putting a team together. Figured whoever's
 been beating up drug dealers is the kind of person who can help."

 Your eyes leap into the back of your skull faster than you can stop
 yourself.

 "You flew all the way to Yeats to recruit a latex fetishist to go fix
 one of your fuck-ups."

 "It's serious. Scary shit I hoped I'd never see again."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You could INTERJECT here)</span>

>interject


 You shake your head, more at yourself than at him. "Fine. If it gets
 you off my back. You see the one in the corner with the oversized
 scarf? That's Grin. He might know what's up."

 "Don't suppose you might serve me a drink, now?"

 "Don't push your luck. And I hope you don't plan on staying in town
 for more than a couple days."

 "Wouldn't dream of it."

>examine crow


 A layer of onyx finely glued onto a layer of iridescent labradorite,
 then carved so that the onyx resembles a crow's head emerging from the
 eerie glow of the white-cyan stone underneath. "For protection," she
 said, on the last night you saw her in this bar. It still hums a tiny
 bit with her aura, pointing faintly towards some distant path.

 Chow gives Ainsley a curious look from the corner table
 You give him one last shrug. "Maybe try someone else's bar for once."

 He doesn't respond; there's no other bar and he knows that. He just
 walks out dejectedly. You give the countertop one last wipe down,
 sighing. "We're closing," you announce to the people at the corner
 table.

 It's three minutes to three on the last Saturday before Christmas; the
 green glass light fixtures hanging over the bar have been dimmed,
 dirty frost speckles the windows, and the hazy scent of alcoholic
 vomit emanating from the toilets has subdued to a minor note in the
 far background of the olfactory panoply that fills Herrig's.

 The last few regulars left in the place have coalesced into a single
 group, huddled around the corner table.

 You can also see a crow cameo here.

>clean bar with rag


 I only understood you as far as wanting to clean the bar.

>clean bar


 You rub the bar.

>examine rag


 You don't strictly need it, but it helps people read you as the
 bartender.

 Your eyes drift inexorably to the group of regulars huddled around the
 table, taking stock of them.

 There's Skóa, of course, with the hat; and Jamessin smoking sullenly
 in the corner. Chow reads quietly in her wide chair, silently enjoying
 the presence of her friends Ramos (with the centipede familiar) and
 Grin (with the oversized scarf).

>examine chow


 Chow is Skóa's physical opposite: Short, brown-skinned, slightly round
 about the cheeks and quite round about the body. But the two have the
 same cold, frighteningly perceptive eyes in common. Chow seems to
 enjoy mostly the vague warmth of others' company; she fills space by
 reading a book. You didn't quite glimpse its cover.

 Ramos nods silently in response to some unseen signal or message from
 his familiar.

>examine book


 You force your eyes to focus on the cover of the book: It's not old as
 in really old, just weatherbeaten and outdated. It's some pulpy thing
 with a screaming woman on the cover and a suitably absurd title:
 <span class="floydstyle em">The Return of the Worm</span>.

 The floorboards crack and pop underfoot.

>examine floorboards


 <span class="floydstyle em">(That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">story.)</span>

>examine skoa


 She is built much like the human version of an ancient birch tree:
 pale, tall, and slightly ominous-looking. This isn't helped by her
 propensity for a sort of post-post businesspunk wardrobe, though
 tonight she chose to break her somber figure by wearing a curious
 fascinator that you can't quite resolve with your eyes.

 Someone's phone squawks with a notification; nobody looks.

>examine fascinator


 You force your eyes to focus on the hat for a moment: It's shaped like
 an abstract paper chrysanthemum, perched on her head at an improbable
 angle. It moves, not with the drafty air inside the bar but of its own
 volition, like a breathing flower.

 The table of regulars laughs together; except, of course, for Grin.

 The door swings open to let someone in from the outside; given the

 replaced by mild annoyance.

 "We're closed," you say.

 "Didn't come here to drink," he replies, giving you the look that
 tells you he's about to rope you into something.

>examine jamessin


 Jamessin is the youngest one in this crowd, though she's eager to make
 it clear at all times that she's nobody's apprentice. Tonight,
 something has her nervous; she's on her third cigarette now, still
 fiddling with the flame she produces from a slightly singed fingertip.
 Plenty going around to make someone rattled, of course.

 Someone looks at their phone and laughs at a private joke.

 You fail to contain a sigh. "Why are you even here?"

 "Oh, just having a look at the old place. Didn't know that I would
 still find it." He talks with an odd lilt that you've been told is
 Welsh.

 "What's that supposed to mean?"

>examine ramos


 Gruff-looking and punkish, but ultimately good natured. Of course,
 then there's the chihuahua-sized centipede clinging to his neck and
 shoulder like a suckling infant. You still remember a time before
 familiars turned into a sort of shock fashion competition, though
 Ramos seems to have put an end to that; nobody cared to try harder
 than the giant centipede.

 The floorboards crack and pop underfoot.

 "Didn't half the wizards in this city get killed or worse last year?"

 You shrug. "They weren't my customers."

 "Still. Must have been some trouble."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You could INTERJECT here)</span>

>interject


 You look askance for a moment, but decide to spill anyway: "So maybe
 there was an attack. So maybe a bunch of rich assholes are in the
 ground or in hospice care now. Maybe some of the people responsible
 were my customers. They're not any more."

 "You're only telling me this because you know I know."

 You give him a practiced glare.

 Chow takes a drink out of her glass.

 The corner table is round, with a plush bench that wraps around it,
 fixed next to a window.

 Someone's phone squawks with a notification; nobody looks.

 "Come on, Ainsley," you say, getting plainly frustrated now. "Just
 tell me what this is about."

 He cocks his head and stares you down curiously, for a moment. And
 then he pulls out a slightly oversized phone. He flips through

 "Is that the weirdo in a costume that all the papers are up in arms
