   PUNSTER (UPI) - Citizens of the little town of Punster have recently
 been victimized by a series of strange happenings which have ground
 local businesses to a halt and played havoc with everyday life.
   The wide-spread plague seems to be focused on the area of language
 itself. In some cases, what were once simple actions to perform now
 require the use of old, time-worn phrases.
   In other cases, objects and even citizens have been transformed
 overnight into strange mutations of their previous selves.
   A man-on-the-street interview conducted by this reporter proved
 fruitless. Two local farmers asked for their opinions of the situation
 said they couldn't make head or tail of it, and made no further
 statement.
   The mayor of Punster, whose administration has been widely viewed as
 being paralyzed and corrupted by the plague, could not be reached for
 comment.
   Meanwhile, a Citizens' Action Committee was recently formed to probe
 for ways to restore the town of Punster to its happily mundane
 condition.

 who untied me so I could type out this story.]

 Beginning

 We, the members of the Citizens' Action Committee, welcome you to our
 mixed-up Town of Punster. You have no doubt already heard about the
 nature of our troubles. Very giving of yourself indeed it is, for you
 to help cleanse the land of every wrongful, wordful deed. In this time
 when phraseology is practiced with mischief as the sole black art, when
 the currency is debased with the ceaseless random coinage of words,
 when verbicide is statistically the common household tragedy -- now is
 the time when such a doer of good words is most welcome.

 We can see you are anxious to go now. So be off, but pick your words
 carefully; weigh them upon the most delicate of scales. Watch out not
 only for your P's and Q's, but your K's and M's as well. And while
 you're at it, watch your R's.

 You can do one of the following: Go to the Shopping Bizarre, Play
 Jacks, Buy the Farm, Eat your Words, Act the Part, Visit the Manor of
 Speaking, Shake a Tower, or Meet the Mayor.

 If at any time in your travels you wish to tackle another situation,
 indicate BEGINNING, and you shall return here empty-handed.

>examine me
 There's no time to dawdle. You must do one of the following:


>shake tower
 In the dark forest outside the town boundries of Punster, chaos has
 been the order of the day. On a recent afternoon the daughter of a
 leading citizen of our town, out for a stroll among the tall pines,
 disappeared without apparent trace. Rumor has it that one strange,
 stand-alone door is the only means of escape from the forest. But no
 volunteer has yet been found to face the oddball nature of the place.
 That is, until now.

 Clearing

 You're in a clearing of a deep, dark forest.

 The odd sight of a lead house stands here under the trees.

 There is one door here that is not connected to any building and which
 is closed. Yet there is something radiant imbedded in it: A gritty
 pearl appears to shine on the door.

>examine house
 It's somewhat small as houses go, but it's one heavy property since
 it's made entirely of thick lead, and has neither doors nor windows.

>turn pearl
 Turning the gritty pearl has no desirable effect.

>pretty girl
 Tiny grains of sand fall from the pearl as it begins to pulse slowly
 with radiant red light, whose brightness soon becomes blinding. When
 you're finally able to move your arms away from your face, you can see
 a beautiful girl before you.

 The girl is radiantly pretty, but as she continues to "shine on the
 door," she kicks her feet angrily in the air.

>dine on the shore

 On the Shore

 This is the shore of a river, between two tributaries of the Rhine. A
 pile of rocks jutting from the beach into the river blocks your path
 along the shore.

 A pretty girl is sitting on the beach, holding what appears to be a pan
 of keys.

>can of peas
 The keys jingle together in the pan, as if simmering, and one key pops
 out of the pan onto the ground. Then in a sudden "poof" the pan is
 transformed into a can.
 The girl takes a whiff of the can of peas and scowls at it. "Yukko. Gag
 me with a spoonerism."

 From the looks of her very trim figure, the pretty girl is certainly in
 need of a square meal. But, being deprived of any kind of dining
 experience on the shore, she instead, by leaps and bounds, sprints
 toward the Rhine and dives headlong into the river.

>get key
 Taken.

>feed girl
 You can't see any girl here!

>exits

 On the Shore

 pile of rocks jutting from the beach into the river blocks your path
 along the shore.

 You can see a can of peas here.

>get can
 Taken.

>bound leap

>examine pile
 Each face of the rocks has the same hungry, crazed expression that says
 "Feed me!"

>mead fee
 [I don't know the word "mead."]

>race fox
 [I don't know the word "race."]

>give peas to rocks
 You scatter the green peas among the hungry rocks, who crack heads with
 each other in their eagerness to gobble them up. When the peas are
 gone, they devour even the tin can, which is loudly crushed as it
 disappears between several of the fed rocks.

>red fox
 With frightful expressions on the faces of the rocks, a loud rumbling
 avalanche sends them tumbling and splashing into the Rhine. Through the
 thick rock dust, you can make out a red fox trotting out of sight.

 With a new section of the shore open to view, you now observe the
 following sight:

 A queer old dean here seems to be the subject of a rare hazing
 experience. A tall leopard, standing up on its hind legs, is shoving
 him up and down the shoreline, creating quite a scene and kicking up
 sand all along the way. The dean, with his long grey locks flaming out
 like Einstein's, is hopelessly mismatched by the leopard and
 continuously gives up sandy ground to him.

>dear old queen
 In the distance you hear the first few bars of the British National
 Anthem as, before your very eyes, the dean is transformed into a
 reigning monarch in full regalia.
 Our shoving leopard stops to make a brief curtsy before the queen, then
 continues pushing her up and down the shoreline.

>rock fox
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>loving shepherd
 The leopard changes its appearance from beast into man and changes its
 spots into a black suit with a white, wraparound collar. He takes out a
 black book and intones solemnly in a guttural Germanic language for a
 few moments.
 Closing his book with a hollow thud, the shepherd uses a stick to
 scrawl a two-line message on the shore. And then, looking with grand
 vision toward the tributaries of the Rhine River, our loving shepherd
 turns tail, walks away from the shore, and disappears in the distance
 as he leads between the Rhines.

>read message
 Since the two lines scrawled on the shore are written in the obscure
 language of sand-script, you're not able to comprehend their meaning.

 The queen marches away down the beach.

>read between the lines
 You gather the gist of the sand-script message to be: Follow your
 Shepherd.

>follow shepherd
 You follow in the precise direction of the shepherd. It's trecherous
 going, since you're travelling over dill and hail -- that is, pickles
 strewn along the paths, and ice chunks hurling from the sky. You
 eventually come upon an out-of-the-way spot along the now quite
 polluted river. It's a prime location for such a flagrant violator of
 anti-pollution laws as the old factory, between whose grimy gates you
 suspiciously enter.

 Old Factory

 This is an old factory. A passage leads into a back room.

 The shepherd has placed his black book on the floor of the factory.

 In a seedy corner of the factory, you can observe a scuffle going on.
 As far as you can see, our loving shepherd is engaged in a tug-of-war
 with a large, man-sized rodent which appears to be a rat. The shepherd
 is struggling, with religious zeal, to pull some black-and-white cloth
 from the huge over-grown rat.

 Someone has left a bonfire going, as a large pile of foam is burning in
 the middle of the factory floor. Above the foam burning, an icicle is
 hanging down from the ceiling.

 The shepherd keeps struggling against all odds, with religious zeal,
 attempting to extract the habit from the large rat, which is fiercely
 clenching it in his snout.

>gutterman geric
 [I don't know the word "gutterman."]

>examine rat
 At the thick-haired shoulder, the rat stands tall as you. In it's buck
 teeth, which are the size of cheese wedges, hangs a habit.

 The shepherd keeps struggling against all odds, with religious zeal,
 attempting to extract the habit from the large rat, which is fiercely
 clenching it in his snout.

>pull rabbit out of hat
 The big rat twitches its bewhiskered snout, and yawns a gap-toothed
 yawn, then incredibly shrinks down to the size, and now the shape, of a
 hat.

 You can see the black-and-white cloth folding in upon itself and
 twisting and wringing itself in a laundry-like fashion. With a final
 turning inside-out and the emergence of floppy ears from the cloth, it
 blooms gradually into the fluffy body of a rabbit.

 Abracadabra, Alacazam! With nothing up your sleeve (with the exception
 of your knobby elbow) you yank the scruffy rabbit, which is pedaling
 its lucky feet in the air, out of the hat.

 The shepherd turns into a leopard and, licking his chops, scampers away
 with the rabbit tucked under one claw.

 Jean Stock

 You're standing toward the rear of the factory, back in the jean stock.
 Jeans of every conceivable size, color, shape, and texture are stacked
 up along the walls, arranged into dozens of rows, piled high onto
 heaps. There is a dizzying effect, as if your point of view were from
 inside a large-capacity clothes dryer.

 A jean client, an intense-looking man wearing thick glasses, is
 impatiently rummaging through the haberdashery.

 You can see, looming in the distance, the dwarfish figure of a man who
 appears to have been sold into slavery to weave fabric at this factory,
 even in its dilapidated condition.

 As you approach, the sold elf awkwardly attempts to make a tall smock.

>fire up bicycle
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>go back
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>go to stock room
 You've already arrived.

>clean giant
 Much to his horror, the jean client begins to undergo a Hulkian
 transformation -- with popping buttons, ripping seams, and bug-eyed
 self-examination.

 Seemingly shamed by the revealing ordeal, the client, while he's still
 of a human size, demonstrates his dexterity and strength by clambering
 up the towering pile of jeans until he can no longer be seen.

>old self
 The elf sprouts up and goes through the whole Dorian Grey thing,
 looking gradually more and more like you but a lot grayer.

>gory dre
 [I don't know the word "gory."]

>jack and the bean stalk
 The mile-high stack of jeans slowly leans heavily into your direction
 and as it passes the point of no return in a chaos of color, fabric and
 rivets, all the jeans come tumbling down upon your head, burying you
 completely in blackness.

 When you come to, it's in a new environment...

 Bean Stalk

 A page from the imagination of your childhood, an illustration of a
 country scene, an open field amid rolling hills under blue sky
 punctuated by cottony soft clouds, next to a simple story punctuated by
 exclamation points.

 An overgrown bean stalk grows thick and tall up into the clouds.
 Nowadays, sadly, it seems the stalk would have to be rationalized,
 explained away somehow by experts, as an ominous instance of
 radioactive mutation, or as a patented, genetically manufactured hybrid
 -- rather than attributed to, as in the old days, simply, magic. Such a
 realization stirs a nostalgic longing for the days of yore when
 imagination reigned in all its grandeur and innocence.

 In the distance you can hear the strange and unmistakable sound of a
 female horse attempting to imitate the sound of a pig.

 Walking around in circles here with its feathers ruffled is a crow,
 which is typically black except for its blushing red face. The crow
 seems embarrassed by the kind of strange behavior animals are capable
 of exhibiting in the vicinity.

>crushing blow
 The crow squawks loudly, scratches at the dirt, and bounds into flight,
 soaring higher and higher into the sky. Then, tucking in its wings, the
 weird bird takes a sudden nose dive that ends smashingly in a cloud of
 dirt on the field. Dust settles around the crushing blow.

>square meal
 The squealing of the mare becomes so increasingly strained and
 high-pitched that you are forced to cover your ears, lowering your head
 in squint-eyed pain. The instant the terrible noise shuts off, your
 eyes pop open and notice a rather angular meal at your feet.

>get meal

 You can see a crushing blow here.

>blushing crow
 A crack appears upon the surface of the blow, and extends jaggedly down
 with a loud cracking noise. Out hops the crow, shedding its membrane
 with bristling feathers.

 On Cloud 673

 You're on cloud 673. It's not exactly cloud nine but it's rather cushy,
 and certainly roomy enough to be the home of a giant, which it just so
 happens to be.

 Before you stands a giant of exceptional cleanliness, hands on his
 hips, wearing an immaculately tailored and dazzlingly white tee shirt.
 So statuesque is the figure of the giant that the floor of the cloud on
 which he stands sags noticeably under his weight.

 Off to one side of the cloud, a great many beets are piled up inside a
 shed, evidently having been harvested from the green acres below in
 order to satisfy the cravings of one gigantic appetite.

 Laughing maliciously, the giant leans over and spills a large bucketful
 of thick, creamy butter on the bean stalk.

 around and enveloping the shed. As the cloud recedes back to form, a
 pile of sheets is revealed lying in place of the beets.
 "Deny me my daily bread, will you, scoundrel!" decries Mr. Clean in a
 stern voice.

 Glaring at you from high above are the giant's pair of sparkling eyes
 which are deep-set into his shiny bald head.

>give hat to giant
 You'll have to remove the hat first.

 The roar of a passing supersonic flight of fancy can be heard, and the
 wake of its exhaust ruffles the cloud for a few moments.

>halbred

 You remove the hat.

>give hat to giant

 chest. You get a close-up, front-row view of the horrified expression
 across his huge face as it passes down in front of you and through the
 cloud.

>make rope from sheets

>tie sheet to sheet
 One by one, you tie together the bed sheets, testing each knot with a
 firm tug accompanied by a tight-lipped grunt. Now off the edge of the
 cloud gets thrown the line of sheets, which is strung out and down,
 looking like a long kite tail swaying gently in the breeze.

 The last sheet you tie firmly to the cloud itself.

>go down
 You grip the line of sheets and begin your hand-over-hand descent from
 the sky, feeling the sharp winds against your back. As your biceps
 begin tightening to the point of pain, you are again close to the land.
 And none too soon, for a few feet above the ground the tension of the
 life line is broken, and you tumble down to earth, buried under a
 waterfall of sheets that comes streaming down upon your head.
 Restlessly you dig yourself out...

 Bean Stalk

 The jean client, having been smashed back into his currently thin
 man-sized shape, stands here looking disheveled and shaken.

 You can see bed sheets, a shiny key, a book of riddles, a square meal
 and a crushing blow here.

 Impulsively, the client dashes nearer, whips a needle out of his
 pocket, and begins to maliciously sew you to a sheet.

>stutter balk
 [I don't know the word "stutter."]

 Bumped by the train of your thoughts, the client pokes himself sharply
 with his needle. To the accompaniment of ripping stitches and popping
 buttons, the client's ire, along with his stature, is raised to the
 great height of a giant. Between thumb and forefinger, he smashes the
 intervening chair into splinters, which drift away above the rural
 landscape. Almost in slow-motion the giant starts after you.

 The giant's nearly upon you.

>show me to a seat

>get crushing blow

 The giant's nearly upon you.

>hit giant with crushing blow
 KABOOM! The ground quakes with the staggering of the giant. Appearing
 like a punch drunk fighter, he weaves round and round, all the while
 shrinking in size, finally to the lowly hunched figure of the client.
 Humiliated at his defeat, the man makes a Chaplinesque exit, kicking
 dust as he walks crookedly away.

 An overgrown bean stalk grows thick and tall up into the clouds.
 Nowadays, sadly, it seems the stalk would have to be rationalized,

 "Click." As you unlock the door the key is swallowed by the lock. A
 tunnel of darkness opens up to you, and you cautiously walk inside. You
 almost vanish into the darkness, it is so black.

 But just now you can discern a fuzzy light beginning to shine from the
 pearl. It brightens to illuminate your upper body, creating a halo of
 pure white light around you. So astounding is the effect of the
 brightened pearl, that it spills from your hand and rolls vanishingly
 away from you, echoing grittily along the tunnel.

 Congratulations are in order. Having braved mutable strangeness and
 having made the heroic gesture of a rescue, you make possible the
 reuniting in joy of a grateful Punster family. This feat earns you the
 rank of Kinkering Cong.

 It would be prudent to commit to memory this and all ranks you have
 achieved.

>save

 Enter saved game to store: Save, completed.

>buy the farm
 The farm crisis never seemed so desperate as it has this planting
 season in Punster. One such family farm on the edge of town, the
 McCleary's, has been especially blighted. The family, though well
 accustomed to hard work, suddenly lost the ability to perform even the
 simplist of chores necessary to scratch a living from the soil. They
 have since been driven from the land, and join with their fellow
 Punster neighbors in urging you to somehow save the family farm.

 Road

 The telltail smell of grain and dung drifts by. You're on a dusty road
 in front of abandoned farm -- a nice-sized spread of land that
 stretches far out to meet the horizon.

 A wooden cart sits in the dusty road here.

 An old dog sits in the dust at the side of the road, feeling all of the
 spirit of gravity, looking dog-eared and worn out by a lifetime on the
 farm.

 The old dog perks up one of its dog-eared ears, then the other. Its
 tail emerges from the surrounding dust and begins oscillating back and
 forth with such intensity that you'd think it was a case of the tail
 wagging the dog.

 In turn the old boy goes through a series of back flips, chases its
 tail, walks around on his hind legs, and howls at the moon. The dog,
 bursting with energy through its shiny new coat, is no longer dry as
 the dust that surrounds it.

 Suddenly by leaps and bounds, the old dog bolts away, and comes back
 with one stone in its slobbery mouth.

 Barn

 You're surrounded by the deep shade of a nearly abandoned barn, with
 very little activity but for an occasional hoot of an owl. Yet toward
 the rear of the barn, under the loft, a cascading spillage of grain is
 creating an ever-widening pile.

 A wooden ladder leads, presumably, up to the loft.

 Over near the wide entrance to the barn, there stands a canister of
 milk.

 The old dog enthusiastically bounds into the barn after you, and
 heedless of where it's going crashes into the canister of milk,
 spilling it in a wide puddle on the floor of the barn.

 The dog looks sheepish, and exits the barn with its tail between its
 legs.

 and disappear somewhere in the barn.

 It's humid up here in the loft, muggy with the heavy smell of barley

 you come upon a man playing music on a flute. You pull the cart to a
 rumbling halt, and the horse gives a snort.

 Seeing you, the piper plays a short flat note, draws the pipe from his
 mouth, and takes quick inventory of the wares he is peddling: a cart
 full of apples, a rumpled canvas bag, and some strong-smelling peppers.

>upset the apple cart

 Visibly perturbed, the stacked apples begin to tremble and quake, until
 one apple heaves up out of the pile and into the air. Your horsey
 companion eyeballs the apple, bares his teeth, tilts back his long
 mane, and catches it. He loudly chomps it into a pulp, and swallows.

 Field

 You are standing at the edge of a barren field that is reminiscent of
 the dust bowl days. A steady wind, having secreted away the topsoil, is
 now drifting sandy dirt across the plain. A scant sign of life here is
 a freshly burrowed molehill on the ground.

 Marking the corner of the property is a large stack of hay, whose musty
 odor sticks in your nostrils.

>search haystack
 What on earth do you expect to find in a haystack?

>needle
 It's hard, of course, because all those stalks of hay look like needles
 themselves. The needle is found twinkling brightly silver among the
 yellow stalks of hay grass. You grab it.

>make a mountain out of a molehill
 There is a tremendous rumbling in the distance, getting louder and
 louder, until it is deafening. The ground shakes with violence from the
 mammoth pressures of the earth's crust. The dirt around the molehill
 crumbles away as mighty, jagged granite peaks begin to emerge from deep
 underneath it, and you are knocked back as the mountain continues to
 rise majestically.

 The surrounding landscape, once bleak, now undergoes transformation
 into a fertile valley before your very eyes. Crops sprout and grow tall
 with the crisp snapping sound of fresh corn being husked.

 Yet with the abundance comes new dangers, as two birds can be seen
 circling above, surveying the lush crops.

 It's so easy, you could do this blindfolded. Smarting from the

 Congratulations for the completion of these 19 chores. You have
 transformed their abandoned husk of a farm into a horn of plenty. The
 McCleary's, under your tutelage, have learned much about how to manage
 their farm, coping with the tough realities of modern farming. After
 this long period of want, the townspeople of Punster will feast
 heartily upon the fruits of your labor. You shall be honored by them
 with the rank of Sodbuster.

>shopping bizarre
 On a recent Friday night at the Supermarket, the usual shopping frenzy
 suddenly turned into shopping panic. Crazed bargain-hunters, recklessly
 pushing shopping carts before them, were observed to stream from the
 aisles and out the market, many of whom not even stopping to pause in
 the parking lot. Whatever it was that caused the panic, one thing's for
 sure -- business has never been the same. By restoring some semblance
 of order to this bizarre situation, and perhaps purchasing some item or
 another, you can begin to rebuild customer confidence.

 powerfully roars to life as you hang on the wildly chugging jackhammer
 like a rodeo cowboy.

 You can't see any hole here!

>examine jack
 You can see right away it's versatile.

 It's sort of squarish, but sort of longish too. Its surface is made of
 thick cloth, except for one edge which is a long piece of metal that
 looks as if it can be pulled out.

 On three different sides of the strange contraption you can see a hand
 crank, a water faucet, and an electrical switch. As if all that wasn't
 enough, there is also a pair of sleeves sticking out of the thing.

>jack hole
 [You'll have to be more specific.]

>wear sleeves
 As you slip on the jacket, you find that it fits you quite well. It
 feels a lot more comfortable than it looks.

>out
 Jackville

>jack off
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>verbose
 Maximum verbosity.

 Jackville

 You have come upon a region far to the north of Punster, but still
 within the realm of possibilities. A simple wood-plank house stands
 near.

 You can't see any switch here!

>pull cloth
 You can't see any cloth here!

>inventory
 You have a jacket (being worn).

 You slip off what feels to be a jacket. All features return to the Jack
 of all Traits.

 "Rata-tat-tat! Rata-rata-rata-rata Tat-tat-tat!" The Jack of all Traits
 powerfully roars to life as you hang on the wildly chugging jackhammer
 like a rodeo cowboy.

 One hand slips off the handle and hits the switch. The jackhammer
 coughs, wheezes and shudders to a halt. All the features of the Jack of
 all Traits return.

>chug jack
 [I don't know the word "chug."]

>pumpkin
 [I don't know the word "pumpkin."]

>town
 [There seems to be a noun missing in that sentence.]

>exits
 [I don't know the word "exits."]

>out
 You walk along the trail a long way. With each uncertain step you take,
 it grows darker. Clouds gather. With large puffy white cheeks, they
 blow noisy cold across the sky, as will happen in this changeable
 realm.

 Whiteness

 It looks like a picture of a wedding gown in a snow storm.

 The cold wind is breezing right through you.

 Your fingers are so stiff with cold, it's impossible.

>wear jacket
 As you slip on the jacket, you find that it fits you quite well. It
 feels a lot more comfortable than it looks. It offers much shelter from
 the cold, which is now nipping at your nose.

>turn on faucet
 You can't see any faucet here!

>go west
 [Refer to the top of the screen to find out where you can go.]

 Despite the shelter of the jacket, you're still in the midst of a cold
 snap. You begin to smell the vague illusory odor of "chestnuts roasting
 on an open fire."

>look at jack
 Suddenly, all of the thick, nasty weather surrounding you begins to
 swirl, then lift, slowly at first, and then more rapidly up above your
 head, then up further to expose the large and many trunks of dense
 evergreen forest, and then up and past the high tops of the trees
 themselves and into the heavens.

 Near pond

 The mountain air is still and cold. You are next to a frozen-over pond,
 ringed by dense forest.

 There is an old wooden sign leaning slightly over.

 An old man is next to the pond, standing bent like one of the age old
 trees of the forest, with the frost of storms past still clinging in
 its whiteness upon his dark overcoat. He holds in his hands a gnarled
 stick.

 The man refuses to communicate with you, but stands still and silent as
 the mountain air.

>stick in the mud
 [I don't know the word "mud."]

>remove jacket
 You slip off what feels to be a jacket. All features return to the Jack
 of all Traits.

>bite old man
 Biting Jack Frost doesn't do anything.

>turn on faucet
 There is a deep gurgling sound, then scalding hot water begins gushing
 out of the faucet, and you are surrounded by a thick cloud of steam. As
 the steam begins to thin out, you find yourself leaning back in a hot
 tub with Jacuzzi, and you can't remember when being in hot water ever
 felt so good.

>examine old man
 He wears a permafrost frown upon his face, a face that betrays a
 lifetime of never any joy, never any surprise, never any sunshine.

>use jackhammer on old man
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>pull plug
 The water, slowly at first, begins to swirl toward the plug, creating a
 whirl of water so loud that it's nightmarish. You close your eyes and
 cover your ears and when you hear the last loud slurp you find yourself
 standing again.

>turn crank
 The Jack of all Traits begins to play a simple plunkety tune, and as
 the music becomes louder and louder the strange contraption starts
 looking a lot more like a box and a lot less like anything else, and
 the music gets louder and louder until...

 "Pop!"

 The lid springs open and a jester rears its jolly head.

 "Boing... Boing"

 The jester winks at the frozen old man, and you can almost hear the
 rushing torrent of flood waters coming from deep within the heart of
 Jack Frost. Some human color suddenly rushes into his cheeks in a
 flush, reddening his face and thawing the frown into much dripping and
 wetness, which can scarcely be distinguished from tears of happiness.

 Under a sunny disposition, a more quick and nimble Jack frolics down
 the path, making instant puddles out of his domain wherever he treads.

>give jack to old man
 You can't see any old man here!

>put jester in box
 That's easy for you to say since you don't even have the
 jack-in-the-box.

>put jack in box
 That's easy for you to say since you don't even have the
 jack-in-the-box.

>get box
 Taken.

>put jack in box
 You can almost swear that the jester winks at you as his head is
 lowered into the box and the lid is shut with a "Click." All the other
 features of the Jack of all Traits come back.

>look
 Near pond

 The mountain air is still and cold. You are next to a frozen-over pond,
 ringed by dense forest.

 There is an old wooden sign leaning slightly over.

>read sign
 It reads:

 NO DANGER! THICK ICE

>enter ice
 You walk out onto the middle of the frozen pond.

 On Frozen Pond

 You're on a frozen pond covered by a thin layer of frost.

>push switch
 "Rata-tat-tat! Rata-rata-rata-rata Tat-tat-tat!" Shiny shards of ice go
 flying out of the plume of exhaust created by the jackhammer as you
 ride the roaring machine in a tight circle. Then the hammer itself is
 pulverized back into the Jack of all Traits.

 The engine exhaust lifts, revealing the sight of a blue-tinted mermaid
 lying exhausted next to a hole in the ice.

 The mermaid wearily slaps her tail fin against the damp ice.

>examine mermaid
 The mermaid is tall, curvaceous and attractive, even with her long
 blond hair dripping wet. There is a large tangle of fishing line
 wrapped around her sizable tail fin. She's wearing a shark-tooth
 necklace.

>pull metal
 The long piece of metal, in reality the glistening, razor-sharp blade
 of a jackknife, pivots out of its handle and with a "snap!" all the
 other features of the Jack of all Traits vanish.

>cut line
 [What do you want to cut the line with?]

>jackknife
 Taking care not to fillet the fishy end of the mermaid, you slice away
 the tangle of fishing line, which blows away like a tumbleweed over the
 surface of the frozen pond.

>metal
 There's nothing noteworthy about the jackknife.

>score

>close knife
 Being careful that you don't lop off any fingers, you pivot the blade
 back and it closes with a "snap!" All the other dimensions of the Jack
 of all Traits return.

>hello mermaid
 [The proper way to talk to characters in the story is PERSON, HELLO.]

>mermaid, hello
 The mermaid gives you a slow smile and tilts her head slightly to one
 side.

>kiss mermaid
 You drift near enough to feel the warmth of her breath, which carries
 barely a hint of brine but is not unpleasant. She turns gracefully
 away.

>examine necklace
 There's nothing eye-catching about the shark-tooth necklace.

>turn on faucet
 There is a deep gurgling sound, then scalding hot water begins gushing
 out of the faucet, and you are surrounded by a thick cloud of steam. As
 the steam begins to thin out, you find yourself leaning back in a hot
 tub with Jacuzzi, and you can't remember when being in hot water ever
 felt so good.

 The mermaid is also in the hot tub, smiling with her eyes closed as she
 swims luxuriously through the water.

>ask mermaid about necklace
 The mermaid gives you a slow smile while effortlessly and relaxingly
 treading water.

>swim
 This is no time for swimming.

>look
 On Frozen Pond, in the tub

 You're on a frozen pond covered by a thin layer of frost. There is a
 hole in the ice.

>pull plug
 The water, slowly at first, begins to swirl toward the plug, creating a
 whirl of water so loud that it's nightmarish. You close your eyes and
 cover your ears and when you hear the last loud slurp you find yourself
 standing again.

 The mermaid, having been warmed by the dip in the hot tub, and freed of
 the entanglement of the fishing line, appears ready to brave the frigid
 waters for a long swim to warmer regions. She hyperventilates for a few
 moments and braces herself with a frenetic self-hug, stopping to give
 you a smile with her thin lips.

 She bids farewell, and slips back into the frigid water, causing a
 little plop of water as her tail fin disappears beneath the surface.

 Congratulations. You have been nimble and you have been quick. Punster
 will from here on out enjoy better relations with its northern
 neighbor, Jackville. The Citizen's Action Committee does hereby confer
 upon you the title of Jackster.

 Beginning

 You now have the opportunity to do one of the following:



>SAVE
>cf4
 Enter saved game to store: Save, completed.

>Act the part
 The foremost star of stage and scream in Punster, Brad Watkins, has
 left behind our small-town difficulties in search of fame and fortune
 beyond the purple horizon. We of course wish him the very worst of
 luck. It has been very dashing of you to take the stage in his absence.
 With the proper make-up applied, you're a side-splitting image.

 Your Living Room

 Glaring bright lights bake down upon the stage.

 The living room of your apartment is furnished in the drab period style
 of the 1950's situation comedy. Luckily, there's not much furniture on
 the set for you to bump into. However, one brass lamp with a rather
 ostentatious lamp shade stands here. A flimsy, union-constructed front
 door leads out of the apartment, another door leads to the bathroom.
 Both are closed. Your kitchen is at the other side of the stage.

 Your favorite chair sits here facing the television.

 You hear a man's voice from the other side of your front door. "Knock
 knock."

>who's there
 "Bob."

>who's there
 Good question.

>bob who
 "Ba ba ba, ba ba ba-ran...."

 The door swings open and in walks your irrepressible, long-lost ("but
 not long enough") brother-in-law Bob. "Howdy, Sammy! Just flew in from
 Pittsburgh. Boy are my arms tired," he says, flapping and smiling
 goonily. Bob extends his hand to you in greeting...

>shake hand

 Bob enthusiastically grabs your hand in greeting.

 "Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz!"

 It feels like you are shaking hands with a Hoover Dam generator, as the
 mega-voltages of power surging into the palm of your hand cause your
 entire body to writhe.

 Bob doubles himself over with knee-slapping, gasping laughter. "I guess
 I got you that time, eh?" he says, flashing you the joy buzzer in his
 palm, and then skates into the kitchen.

>burn with rage
 [You won't find the word "rage" anywhere in the script.]

>trip on chair
 [You won't find the word "trip" anywhere in the script.]

>kitchen
 You walk across the stage.

 Kitchen

 The kitchen suffers from the neglect so often decried by the 1950's
 sitcom husband in the presence of his 1950's sitcom wife.

 There's a bottle in front of you. Your mind echos the phrase, "a bottle
 in front of me," which gives you ideas...

 You can see a scalpel-like knife, a blue sponge and yellow rubber
 gloves here.

 Your brother-in-law Bob swings open the refrigerator door, loads
 himself down, shuts the fridge door with his knee, and with his movable
 feast shuffles back into the living room.

>kitchen
 You've already arrived.

 Taken.

>get pie
 You can't see any pie here!

 hot-water bottle: The hot-water bottle, which is devoid of water but
 puffed up with air, is squeezed and emits a rude Bronx cheer.
 scalpel-like knife: Taken.
 yellow rubber gloves: Taken.

>put bottle on chair
 You can't see any chair here!

>ask bob to sit
 You can't see Bob here!

>living room
 You walk across the stage.

 Well, it seems that Bob has already taken the liberty of moving the
 lamp away from his TV viewing area and over near the kitchen entrance,
 where you now have the misfortune of tripping over the cord from the
 lamp.

 You take a pratfall, landing heavily on the floor to the beat of a bass
 drum, and then a rim shot. The crowd loves it.

 Meanwhile, the live wire, ripped from the lamp but still plugged into
 the wall, snakes around the floor, spitting sparks out of the end that
 was torn from the lamp.

 Bob, who is kicking back on your favorite chair, is too engrossed with
 the TV to notice any of this.

 Your Living Room

 Glaring bright lights bake down upon the stage.

 The living room of your apartment is furnished in the drab period style
 of the 1950's situation comedy. Luckily, there's not much furniture on
 the set for you to bump into. However, one brass lamp with a rather
 ostentatious lamp shade stands here. A flimsy, union-constructed front
 door leads out of the apartment, another door leads to the bathroom.
 Both are closed. Your kitchen is at the other side of the stage.

 An electrical cord is plugged into the wall, the other end having been
 torn from the lamp.

 [You won't find the word "fix" anywhere in the script.]

 electrical cord: The audience sucks in its collective breath at your
 bare-handedness, which gives you pause.
 lamp: You've gotta be kidding.
 lamp shade: Taken.

 In your nervous hand, the lamp shade's gold tassels shake, perceptible
 only to yourself, slightly back and forth.

>wear shade
 You lower the gaudy lamp shade over your deadpan face, pretending to be
 part of the furniture, which is how your brother-in-law Bob has treated
 you. As the laughs die down, you remove the shade.

 You're now wearing the yellow rubber gloves.

 The audience sucks in its collective breath, and you gingerly pick up
 the live wire, with its end resting in the palm of the glove.

 Never in a thousand years.

 [You won't find the word "connect" anywhere in the script.]

 Touching the lamp doesn't do anything.

>blow in bottle
 You huff and puff until the hot-water bottle is full of hot air. Some
 members of the studio audience let out some anticipatory giggles.

 Bob says, "Hey Sammy, what is this fly doing in my soup?"

>pact the art
 [You won't find the word "pact" anywhere in the script.]

>backstroke
 The crowd eats it up.

>the backstroke
 Bob gets up and marches toward the kitchen, evidently to stock up on
 more goodies.

 It looks like every other your shoulder you've ever seen.

 Talking to yourself is a sign of impending mental collapse.

>put bottle in chair
 It would be visible there.

 You can't see Bob here!

>take cushion
 Nice try.

 You slip the whoopee cushion into position. The audience begins
 tittering.

 In walks the unsuspecting Bob, who is loaded down with goodies. He
 plops onto YOUR comfy chair.

 "Bbbthpppffffthppp!" The crowd howls as poor Bob nearly loses his lunch
 in shock.

>put bottle under cushion
 You're not holding the hot-water bottle.

>touch cord to bob
 Bob reflexively extends his hand...

 "Za za za za za za Zap!" Electrified by the experience, with his hair
 sticking straight out and a frightful expression stamped on his face,
 your brother-in-law Bob is powered willy-nilly into the air, with an
 involuntarily tight grip on the cord. You're holding the other end with
 your yellow rubber gloves, smiling calmly, as if you had a fly on the
 end of a string. The crowd loves it.

 With a yank on the cord, Bob lands in a heap back onto your chair, a
 little shaken but no worse for the scare.

>inventory
 You have an electrical cord, yellow rubber gloves (being worn), a lamp
 shade, a scalpel-like knife, a blue sponge and a coat (being worn).
 It seems that the coat contains a match stick.

 You hear someone behind the flimsy door whisper, "Another move like
 that and his career's in the toilet too," which stops you in your
 tracks.

>compare bob to sponge
 [You won't find the word "compare" anywhere in the script.]

>light match
 You scratch the match behind your left ear and it flares up.

 The match continues burning down.

>put match under foot
 Somebody yelling "Fire" in the crowded theater is enough to stop you.

 The match continues burning down.

>put match in hole
 As you slide the match neatly into the shoe hole, waves of knowing
 snickers ripple through the audience. With his eyes still glued to the
 television, your brother-in-law Bob tilts his head to one side, and
 sniffs the air twice. "I smell something burning, Sammy. You better go
 into the kitchen and check it Ow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wowwy!"

 In a blur, the hot-footed Bob leaps from the chair and performs a
 Hiawathan rain dance to the insistent, rhythmic beat of Indian drums.

 The crowd loves it.

 There is the final sound effect of a thunder clap in the distance, and
 Bob hunkers paranoically back down in your chair, staring again at the
 TV.

 You hear a woman's voice from the other side of your front door. "Knock
 knock."

>who's there
 "Gorilla."

>gorilla who
 "Girl of your dreams!"

 A lady enters the living room and, narrowing her eyes, begins sizing up
 the situation.

>examine lady
 That's no lady, that is your wife.

 She walks over to Bob and consoles him as he describes what a meanee
 you have been.

>gorilla my dreams
 [You won't find the word "dreams" anywhere in the script.]

>inventory
 You have an electrical cord, yellow rubber gloves (being worn), a lamp

 Bob continues telling your wife how rotten you were to him.

>examine sponge
 [Which sponge do you mean, your brother-in-law Bob or the blue sponge?]

>examine blue sponge
 There's nothing unusual about the blue sponge.

 She throws a tantrum and storms out, to her mother's (that's next
 week's episode). Bob is falling apart emotionally as well, and goes and
 locks himself in the bathroom.

 Bob stays in there several very tense minutes, without making a sound.
 Just when you think it's about time to call a professional, Bob's
 silence is suddenly broken by the words, "Knock knock."

>sponge off bob
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>who's there
 "Dwayne."

>dwayne who
 "Dwayne the bathtub, I'm dwownin'!"

 You hear a suppressed cackle from behind the bathroom door, which
 slowly opens to reveal the figure of your Bob, looking sheepish but
 with his hurt feelings mended. He shuts the door and slides back into
 your chair.

>who's there
 Good question.

>examine sponge
 [Which sponge do you mean, your brother-in-law Bob or the blue sponge?]

>bob
 The crowd erupts with laughter as you seem to equate your
 brother-in-law Bob with a sponge.

>cut throat

 To put it bluntly, neither the scalpel-like knife nor you are very
 sharp.

>put coat on bob
 You'll have to remove the coat first.

>lobotomize bob
 [You won't find the word "lobotomize" anywhere in the script.]

>take coat
 You're already wearing the coat.

>put it on bob
 You'll have to remove the coat first.

>remove coat
 You remove the coat.

>put it on bob
 But it's not your brother-in-law Bob's size.

>frontal lobotomy
 You can't see any frontal lobotomy here.

>poke bob with knife
 That'd be worse than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.

 You hear someone behind the flimsy door whisper, "Another move like
 that and his career's in the toilet too," which stops you in your
 tracks.

 You walk across the stage.

 An electrical cord is plugged into the wall, the other end having been

 Your brother-in-law Bob is kicking back on your favorite chair, feeding
 his face and staring at the television. With his feet jutting out into
 the air, you notice a small hole at the tip of one of his
 much-travelled shoes.

 You can see a hot-water bottle here.

>examine bottle
 The hot-water bottle is empty and deflated.

>give bottle to bob
 That's easy for you to say since you don't even have the hot-water

 "Cut! Cut!" booms an off-stage, directoral voice. "It's a wrap."
 Drenched in the sweat of your comedic toil, you bask in the adoration

>visit manor
 The sad truth here is that the Manor of Speaking once enjoyed the
 reputation as one of THE finest guest houses in the entire region
 around Punster. But queer indeed is the fate it has suffered. The
 various rooms of the house are actually possessed by the warped
 personalities of by-gone visitors. The experience of a present-day
 guest to each of the rooms is colored very strongly by the thoughts and
 indeed voice of each ghostly presence. Needless to say, vacancy rates
 have gone through the roof. Which leads us to the crucial problem with
 the Manor. Its attic, as you will notice, is radically out of joint,
 situated BELOW the level of the first floor. It has been theorized that
 if this misplacement could be dramatically rectified, the spirits
 who've worn out their welcome might flee in horror. This is our hope,
 may it be your quest.

 Before the Manor

 You're standing in front of a large but oddly shaped manor house. From
 the outside, it looks as if its individual rooms have been haphazardly
 constructed and are out of proportion with each other. This has a
 slight disorienting effect.

 The carpet! The carpet! Don't drag your feet on the carpet! It's a
 priceless hand-loomed Persian!

 Whew! Okay, you're now standing on the bone-white Louis-XV-inspired
 tile.

 Interior Decorated

 This room, with its modern sensibility yet also palpable feeling for
 the ancien regime, is unique in its elegant reflection of a confident,
 personal sense of style. The lines are lean and classic, the color is
 rich and distinctive.

 The Louis XIV chair is plump, tufted, aristocratic -- it's styled with
 equal splashes of rococo and baroque. The piece definitely has
 charisma. Sitting on the chair: a multihued textured pillow.

 Against the far wall is an heroically proportioned,
 Mediterranean-crafted, intricately inlaid, Pre-Raphaelite limestone
 mantelpiece, circa 1838.

 Adorning the mantel is a resplendently virgin-ivory hand-embroidered,
 filet-patterned lace tablecloth, circle 924 on your Reader Service
 Card.

 A marble staircase of grand proportions leads down.

 Doldrums

 Go ahead, come on in and bore me.

 Walking into here is like driving across Nebraska. The place is neither
 bright nor dim, neither cool nor warm, neither this way nor that way.
 Even the air is unmoved by the experience of you entering the doldrums.

 In the center of the room is a vast wasteland, which gradually blends
 into a wide patch of long pale-green grass that spills over into
 yawning chasms. Above the cliff hangs a shapeless cloud through which a
 line of sheep are jumping, one after the next, in slow motion.

 All of the objects here have the aspect of salt-water taffy left out in
 the sun too long. Cobwebs enshroud a clock that has long since clocked
 out.

 One wall appears to have been recently painted pea green. The weak
 smell of paint lingers in the air.

 Doldrums

 Go ahead, come on in and bore me.

 Walking into here is like driving across Nebraska. The place is neither
 bright nor dim, neither cool nor warm, neither this way nor that way.
 Even the air is unmoved by the experience of you entering the doldrums.

 In the center of the room is a vast wasteland, which gradually blends
 into a wide patch of long pale-green grass that spills over into
 yawning chasms. Above the cliff hangs a shapeless cloud through which a
 line of sheep are jumping, one after the next, in slow motion.

 All of the objects here have the aspect of salt-water taffy left out in
 the sun too long. Cobwebs enshroud a clock that has long since clocked
 out.

 One wall appears to have been recently painted pea green. The weak
 smell of paint lingers in the air.

 The grass here continues to grow.

 [I don't know the word "sing."]

 [I don't know the word "cobwebs."]

 rather ominous.

 "Tick... tick." I hear bomb ticking! Counter-Revolutionary spy! Hold on

 This room is painted entirely in bold, revolutionary red -- walls,
 floor, and ceiling -- surrounding you symbolically with the
 inescapability of the coming of the revolution.

 Presiding over the room, hanging from a high red wall, the portrait of
 the Grandfather of the Revolution, Karl Marx, looks down with furrowed
 brow upon your capitalist hide.

 Aaah... Choo! Oh, of course, in you come tracking your germs.

 You're standing upon a rubberized non-slip bathroom mat. Handrails,

 pills, lozenges and elixirs -- hey, you can't be too careful, with

 afflictions that, yes, haven't even afflicted anyone yet. But it's
 better to be safe than sorry.

>visit manor
 The sad truth here is that the Manor of Speaking once enjoyed the
 reputation as one of THE finest guest houses in the entire region
 around Punster. But queer indeed is the fate it has suffered. The
 various rooms of the house are actually possessed by the warped
 personalities of by-gone visitors. The experience of a present-day
 guest to each of the rooms is colored very strongly by the thoughts and
 indeed voice of each ghostly presence. Needless to say, vacancy rates
 have gone through the roof. Which leads us to the crucial problem with
 the Manor. Its attic, as you will notice, is radically out of joint,
 situated BELOW the level of the first floor. It has been theorized that
 if this misplacement could be dramatically rectified, the spirits
 who've worn out their welcome might flee in horror. This is our hope,
 may it be your quest.

 "Tick... tick." I hear bomb ticking! Counter-Revolutionary spy! Hold on
 to our sable hats. My sturdy walls tremble with xenophobia of Western
 hegemony into Mother Country. Poor Marx is jolted and falls indignantly
 to the floor, revealing some kind of safe on the red wall where he had
 hung.

 This room is painted entirely in bold, revolutionary red -- walls,
 floor, and ceiling -- surrounding you symbolically with the
 inescapability of the coming of the revolution.

 There's a safe built into the wall where the picture once hung.

 In keeping with the spirit of international brotherhood and with the

 Interior Decorated

 This room, with its modern sensibility yet also palpable feeling for
 the ancien regime, is unique in its elegant reflection of a confident,
 personal sense of style. The lines are lean and classic, the color is
 rich and distinctive.

 The Louis XIV chair is plump, tufted, aristocratic -- it's styled with
 equal splashes of rococo and baroque. The piece definitely has
 charisma.

 Against the far wall is an heroically proportioned,
 Mediterranean-crafted, intricately inlaid, Pre-Raphaelite limestone
 mantelpiece, circa 1838.

 but with steadiness, you regain your feet. Wait! You can hear the
 screeching voices of disembodied spirits converge in a fright and then
 around the entrance to the manor, and then grow faint in the distance.

 Congratulations. Having rid the manor of its unwanted, if spirited,

>eat words
 Indeed, eat your words. So widespread has this language virus become in
 the Town of Punster, that the simple act of going out for a bite to eat
 turns into a whole new adventure of its own. Enjoy.

 First, you arrive in front of a large, two-story Teapot with wisps of
 smoke drifting out of its spout. As you walk inside you're nearly
 broadsided by a waitress who's all in a rush, which seems odd since you
 see no one else in the restaurant. Nevertheless, the waitress does not
 smile and say hello, does not introduce herself as Jenny, does not even
 acknowledge your existence with a tip of her headband.

 First floor

 You are on the first floor of The Teapot Cafe, standing next to your
 table under the shadowy umbrage of the second floor balcony, which can
 be reached by a stairway that is marked with a blue neon sign.

 Your table is only partially covered by a skimpy little tablecloth.

 A red velvet curtain appears to mark the entrance to the kitchen.

 A waitress here is trying to look busy.

>order burger
 [I don't know the word "burger."]

>examine waitress
 She is a hatchet-faced young woman, with a spiked purple mohawk and a
 pink woolen headband worn low on her forehead. A stray wood chip,
 apparently having been picked up from the kitchen, sits upon her
 shoulder, which is otherwise sprinkled amply with dandruff, or dander.

 She eyes you suspiciously for a moment, as if you've done wrong.

>take chip on shoulder
 There's another turn down the drain.

>take chip off shoulder
 Why bother?

>knock chip off her shoulder
 "Come on, knock it off!" the waitress says defiantly, and the chip goes
 flying off into the air. She ducks out for a few seconds and returns to
 hurriedly set your table with something strange and crude for an eating
 instrument, a hatchet.

>knock chip off shoulder
 You can't see any chip here!

>raise dander
 The waitress shrugs her shoulders in contempt of your pestering, and
 sure enough her dander is raised. Becoming agitated at your behavior,
 she disappears for a few moments, and comes back to serve you some pie
 by setting it on the table.

 The waitress continues on, calculating her tips for the day.

>bury the hatchet
 You're not holding the hatchet.

>examine pie
 There's nothing eye-catching about humble pie.

>eat humble pie
 As gingerly as possible, nibbling around the edges and taking smallish
 guilty bites out of the pie, and chewing slowly and thoughtfully with
 wide eyes to prolong the expression of your humility, you gradually
 consume the pie until it is all gone.

 You can't see any crow here!

 As you head toward the kitchen, the waitress heads you off at the pass.
 You don't have nearly enough gall to storm into the kitchen, but you're

>bury hatchet in waitress
 The waitress firmly grips your forearm in defense of her mohawk. "Come
 on now, enough of this hair-splitting, I'll get to you, just as soon as
 I can."

>examine waitress
 She is a hatchet-faced young woman, with a spiked purple mohawk and a
 pink woolen headband worn low on her forehead. You've knocked the chip
 off her shoulder. You've done your darndest to raise her dander.

 She eyes you suspiciously for a moment, as if you've done wrong.

>examine headband
 There's nothing special about the wool.

>pull wool over her eyes
 The headband slips lower upon the waitress's forehead, narrowing her
 vision to table-level and below.
 The waitress steps away from you, performing a quick set of high-impact
 aerobics.

>examine mohawk

>examine tablecloth
 From the looks of it, you've been given the short shrift, this shrunken
 little tablecloth that's hardly big enough to cover a table.

>get sign
 Having pulled the wool over the waitress's eyes, you snatch the neon
 sign, which glows warm in your hands.

>give her comeuppance
 [to the waitress]
 The fuzzily glowing neon goes well with her dime-store face. Her eyes
 pick up the glow, and she storms away. She charges back into the
 kitchen, and brings to your table some strange meat that she briefly
 describes as being "collective of lions." Strange indeed.

>examine meat
 There's nothing special about the collective of lions' meat.

>give pride to waitress
 That's easy for you to say since you don't even have the collective of
 lions' meat.

 Briskly, the waitress refuses your offer.

 It's hard to swallow, but with determination and several long, Adam's

 This is the second floor of The Teapot Cafe. You're standing below a
 low-slung ceiling, upon a carpet, next to an official-looking sign on

 open-air hearth which is filled with smoldering coals.

 Some food has been left here, no doubt by some impatient patrons of the
 cafe.

 Leaning against the stone wall is a rake.

 A decorative olive tree stands in the shadowy corner.

 The waitress stalks after you.

 At first, the waitress perks up, no doubt expecting a large tip. But
 when she gets the meanness of your offering, her face sours. She
 leaves, comes back and closes your hand gently around a fortune cookie
 along with a salt shaker.

 The waitress stomps away in a huff and begins taking a standing coffee
 break.

>take fortune with a grain of salt
 You can't see any fortune here!

>shake shaker
 Just one grain of salt spills out of the shaker onto the floor.

>take cookie with a grain of salt
 Taking the fortune cookie lightly is par for the course, but it doesn't
 seem to affect the grain of salt one iota.

>open cookie
 Crumbs from the cookie drift away upon a pungent smelling wind from the
 kitchen. That's the way the cookie crumbles. However, you are left with
 a piece of advice.

>take advice with a grain of salt
 You read the advice in a loud voice with much sarcasm, taking it so
 lightly that the slip of paper almosts drifts up into the air. The
 waitress seems snubbed that you don't seem to be taking the advice to
 heart. She flies the coop for a minute and comes back with a charred,
 dark-feathered bird which she puts in your arms.

 She makes a brief exit, and a briefer entrance to drop a white cloth
 napkin into your arms.

>wave white flag
 With your shoulders scrunched together so as not to presume to take up
 much room in the Teapot Cafe, and with a sheepish look on your face,
 you wave the little white napkin, looking side to side to see if it's
 having any effect at all.

 "How sweet," thinks the waitress. "I haven't been read to since I was a
 child, before going to sleep." But when she suddenly realizes it's
 bedtime for Bonzo, her face reddens. She exits, then comes back and
 slips a rump roast to you.

 The waitress continues on, munching on some pilfered salad makings.

 Bristling at your presumption of authority, the waitress stops in front
 of you for one brief moment. Then before you can open your mouth, she
 turns and leaves. She pretends not to be bothered, but you observe that
 she's reaching her boiling point, being driven into a tizzy as she
 walks in circles. Her dander is jumping up from her shoulders as she
 storms away, and the distant sound of a teapot whistling can be heard.

 First floor

 You are on the first floor of The Teapot Cafe, standing next to your
 table under the shadowy umbrage of the second floor balcony, which can
 be reached by a stairway.

 Your table is only partially covered by a skimpy little tablecloth.

 A red velvet curtain appears to mark the entrance to the kitchen.

 The waitress stalks after you.

>enter kitchen
 You're drawn toward the kitchen amid the fast-paced, dramatic sounds of
 a big-band era orchestra -- matador music. As you make your entrance,
 the red velvet curtain, now appearing like a cape, comes off into your
 hands.

 Kitchen

 The dominating feature of the kitchen is the cook, who is dwarfish in
 dimension but gigantic in size.

 You can immediately see there's a lot of bad blood between you and him.

 But he's getting all worked up over the meal he's preparing and doesn't
 take notice of you. He is utterly beside himself, which takes up most
 of the floor space of the kitchen. The ruffled fur is flying, plumes of
 sifted flour are exploding, the briny sweat is raining through the
 steamy air, as the cook wreaks havoc while whipping something together.

 The kitchen is equipped with, among other crude devices, a grindstone.

>put nose to grindstone
 Okay. Fine. You resolve to work harder.

>about
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>entitle him to the sweat of his brow
 [I don't know the word "entitle."]

>give him the sweat of his brow
 [I don't know the word "sweat."]

>examine devices
 There's nothing unusual about his own devices.

>grind axe
 After all you've been through, you believe you have a legitimate axe to
 grind, and you do so, with relish. The blade of the axe twinkles with
 razor sharpness.

>leave chef to his own devices
 [I don't know the word "chef."]

>leave cook to his own devices
 Good idea, but he isn't too involved with his own devices at the
 moment.

>examine blood
 It looks like every other bad blood you've ever seen.

>wipe up bad blood
 Down on your hands and knees, you remove the bad blood by using the
 cape, which turns a deeper shade of red.

 You shuffle toward him for a closer view, and for a moment you're
 standing toe to toe, but you don't see eye to eye. His nose is out of
 joint, which explains why he's cutting it off to spite his face. (He
 flings it into his concoction.) You can hear the volcanic roar of
 bitter bile in his throat, which is making him hot under the collar,
 and causing smoke to pour out of his ears.

 The cook glares for moment at his recipe card, and apparently you're
 not on it, because he turns back in front of a large bowl and resumes
 madly throwing ingredients together.

>let the fur fly
 [I don't know the word "fly."]

>examine bowl
 The slimy admixture of entrails, small winged insects and the
 occasional fleshy ear, churns thickly within the pot...

 Just now, two of the cook's pet peeves wander up to him, and add to the
 confusion by begging loudly for scraps -- the goat bleating, and the
 goose honking.

 The cook comes across a labeled can, picks it up, and continues
 scouring the kitchen for the right ingredients.

>examine card
 Though the card is splattered with food, you can see the name of the
 concoction is "Brew-hah-hah."

>get his goat
 The cook's goat, its hooves clanking awkwardly on the kitchen floor, is
 nevertheless gotten. The cook, being steamed up, breaks your grip on
 the goat, which bleats a hasty retreat.

>cook his goose
 A burst of grease and flames spit up from the stunned bird, and the
 cook himself emotionally melts as his goose is cooked. (So it's safer
 to cook the goose than to goose the cook.)

>goose cook
 No. Just flatly no.

 You give her the evil eye, which is not as painful as you might have

 the waitress, she seems ruffled, but continues about her business.
 The waitress steps away from you, fingering her neck nervously.

>vent spleen on waitress
 On a gut feeling, you let it all hang out, which brings you a general
 feeling of well-being. It seems to have struck a nerve in the waitress

 embarrassing.

 You muster a grimace of your own, and you both follow the table around

 Back to the story...

>go up
 [Refer to the top of the screen to find out where you can go.]

>out
 First floor

 You are on the first floor of The Teapot Cafe, standing next to your
 table under the shadowy umbrage of the second floor balcony, which can
 be reached by a stairway.

 A waitress here is trying to look busy.

>go up
 Second floor

 This is the second floor of The Teapot Cafe. You're standing below a
 low-slung ceiling, upon a carpet, next to an official-looking sign on
 the wall. Across from you, built into a stone wall, lies a large
 open-air hearth which is filled with smoldering coals.

 A decorative olive tree stands in the shadowy corner.

 The waitress stalks after you.

>hit ceiling
 The full brunt of your impact is taken by your head and shoulders, and
 the entire teapot rattles loudly as you raise the roof.
 The waitress resumes her duties, which seem to include munching on some
 pilfered salad makings.

>toss salad
 [I don't know the word "salad."]

>go down
 First floor

 You are on the first floor of The Teapot Cafe, standing next to your
 table under the shadowy umbrage of the second floor balcony, which can
 be reached by a stairway.

 The waitress trails after you.

>kitchen
 Kitchen

 The dominating feature of the kitchen is the cook, who is dwarfish in
 dimension but gigantic in size.

 But he's getting all worked up over the meal he's preparing and doesn't
 take notice of you. He is utterly beside himself, which takes up most
 of the floor space of the kitchen. The ruffled fur is flying, plumes of
 sifted flour are exploding, the briny sweat is raining through the
 steamy air, as the cook wreaks havoc while whipping something together.

 The kitchen is equipped with, among other crude devices, a grindstone.

>examine can
 The label reads "Laughing stock."

>canned laughter
 [I don't know the word "canned."]

>make laughing stock
 You can't just make a laughing stock out of thin air.

>make laughing stock out of cook
 You get a lot of canned laughter coming from rows of cans, and the cook
 seems to take offense.

 Now you've really gotten him steamed up. He snatches you around the
 waist, laughs heartily into your face with marinated breath, and plops
 you down into the center of a large, family-size frying pan.

 The cook begins gathering his own devices, as flames lick up around the
 rim of the frying pan.

>get out of frying pan and into fire
 [There seems to be a noun missing in that sentence.]

>jump out of frying pan and into fire
 [There seems to be a noun missing in that sentence.]

>enter
 Look around you.

 Your feet are beginning to feel the heat.

>enter fire
 You avoid the fate of being merely a flash in the pan by leaping from
 the skillet, heedless of the heat outside it. As harmlessly as one's
 hand passing quickly over a lighted candle, your entire body falls
 through the large licking blue flame. Landing on the jet, you put out
 the fire, and fall to the floor. The cook angrily flings the pan into
 oblivion.

 The cook backs you up into a corner, and begins sharpening his own
 devices, bent on destroying you.

>leave cook to own devices
 A wise move, it would seem, since the cook is not adept in the
 application of technology to the preparation of food. Truth will tell,
 he's already done away with a cousin in a Cuisinart, lost a friend in a
 blender, and microwaved a surfer.

 He appears to hurt himself by his own devices, and you get out of the
 corner only to run into a big ox that happens to be wandering through
 the kitchen!

>call ox moron
 [I don't know the word "moron."]

>take ox by the horns
 [I don't know the word "horns."]

>examine ox
 There's nothing noteworthy about the ox.

>whose ox is gored
 [I don't know the word "whose."]

>gore ox
 You don't have a weapon.

>be stubborn as an ox
 [I don't know the word "be."]

>stubborn as ox
 [I don't know the word "stubborn."]

>wave cape
 You're not holding the red velvet curtain.

>inventory
 You're cross-eyed with anger, which means a jaundiced eye points this
 way, and an evil eye points that way. But you feel some justification
 in having vented your spleen. You're empty-handed.

>look
 Kitchen

 The dominating feature of the kitchen is the cook, who is dwarfish in
 dimension but gigantic in size.

 But he's getting all worked up over the meal he's preparing and doesn't
 take notice of you. He is utterly beside himself, which takes up most
 of the floor space of the kitchen. The ruffled fur is flying, plumes of
 sifted flour are exploding, the briny sweat is raining through the
 steamy air, as the cook wreaks havoc while whipping something together.

 The kitchen is equipped with, among other crude devices, a grindstone.

 You can see an ox, a hatchet, a rake, a salt shaker, advice,
 nitty-gritty crow, a white cloth napkin, a grain of salt, a rump roast
 and a red velvet curtain here.

>get hatchet
 Taken.

>bury hatchet in ox
 Okay, you bury the hatchet in the animal and his ox is gored, leaving
 quite a mess, but also a bone of contention. Immediately, both you and
 the cook see an end to it, and each of you take a slimy end of the bone
 of contention. With your eyes closed, you make a wish, as does the
 burly cook.

 "Snap!" The bone breaks jaggedly, and the cook is left with the short
 end of the stick.

 He drops to the floor, mopping up the entrails of the ox and
 apologizing profusely and promising never again to wield another
 kitchen utensil as long as he lives.

 Congratulations are in order. You're ranked as...
 Satisfied Customer.

 honorable Jimmy "Fat Baby" Kazooli, act in the best interest of his
 citizenry. You are sent...

 Public Square

 You're in the public square. Facing one edge of the square stands an
 impressive looking neo-colonial town house, which is decoratively
 fronted by a row of laurel bushes.

 In the middle of the public square stands a thick, ten feet tall stump
 of a tree. Attached to the stump is a sheet of paper and next to the
 paper hangs the horn of the town crier.

>examine paper
 There is a list of "Ten Laws of the Land." But the bottom of the sheet
 is torn off, leaving only nine laws, which are:

   No Running
   No Panting Loons
   No Skipping
   Reptilian Volleyball is O-u-t
   Honor Thy Fodder
   No Chewing Gum
   Defend your Landmother
   No Pepper
   Rip What You Sew

>possession is nine tenths of the law
 The horn begins to trumpet out a stuttering protest, but the logic of
 law is so compelling that it quits, and you take possession of the
 horn.

>wear pantaloons
 [I don't know the word "pantaloons."]

>examine horn
 The old brass horn is dinged up and tarnished from seemingly centuries
 of use by the town crier.

>blow my own horn
 You give the horn a big, brassy toot; but no one is around to hear it.

>rest on laurels
 This is no time for such vain self-congratulation.

>get laurels
 Taken.

>get paper
 That would be against the law.

>examine letter of the law
 [I don't know the word "letter."]

>enter house
 Lobby

 This is the lobby of the town hall, looking stately and deeply
 lacquered. A boldly impressive staircase leads up and you can see steam
 drifting out of a room at the top of it. The main focus of attention in
 the lobby is an imposing, ornately framed document hanging on the wall.

 A six-pack of beer -- the loyal constituency of cigar-chomping,
 back-room politicians -- sits on the floor beneath the document.

>examine document
 On brittle, yellowing paper you read the following:

   P R E T E N S E S

 The World, verily, is proved to be flat!

 The Rule of the Great Kazooli shall spread to the corners of the World!

 And beloved shall be Our Mayor in the eyes of the World!

 Forsooth, His Rule shall endure a thousand years!

>rule under false pretenses
 [I don't know the word "rule."]

>false pretenses
 On brittle, yellowing paper you read the following:

   P R E T E N S E S

 The World, verily, is proved to be flat!

 The Rule of the Great Kazooli shall spread to the corners of the World!

 And beloved shall be Our Mayor in the eyes of the World!

 Forsooth, His Rule shall endure a thousand years!

>examine six pack
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>operate under false pretenses
 [I don't know the word "operate."]

>get beer
 It's no simple matter taking something that's not yours, and you're
 unable to do it that way.

>examine beer
 The cans of beer are tall and thick, each labeled with the brand name
 "Deep Six" and each depicting the same bluish misty ocean scene.

>take beer under false pretenses
 Yes, there's more than one way to steal a pack, but under false
 Pretenses is surely not the worst way. You cradle the six-pack in your
 arms like the mother's milk of local politics, which it is.

>milk beer
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>look
 Lobby

 This is the lobby of the town hall, looking stately and deeply
 lacquered. A boldly impressive staircase leads up and you can see steam
 drifting out of a room at the top of it. The main focus of attention in
 the lobby is an imposing, ornately framed document hanging on the wall.

>go up
 Bathroom

 The bathroom, thoroughly steamed up, is ample in space but untidy in
 appearance. A pile of dirty linen marks the entrance to the staircase.

 A comb lies in a puddle of water by the bathtub.

 Against the far wall you can see a bathtub. Inside is a duck, which is
 looking confused and swimming around in circles and figure-8's.

 Standing against one wall is the strange sight of a jar that stands
 nearly as high as the ceiling.

>examine jar
 It looks like every other "a jar" you've ever seen.

>door is a jar
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>make door ajar
 [You'll have to be more specific.]

>examine door
 From inside the big jar there comes a flash of light which intensifies
 in several quick, increasingly brighter pulses. Prismatically, the
 large surface  of the jar glows with the colors of the rainbow. Then in
 a blink of your eyes, the light show is over and in the place of the
 jar you observe a quite ordinary closet door, which is now open.

>door ajar
 [You'll have to be more specific.]

>wash dirty linen
 Doing it in private won't help.

>wash dirty linen in public
 You're not in public.

>air dirty linen
 Doing it in private won't help.

>get linen
 Keeping your nose at a distance from the soiled clothes, with an
 outstretched arm and with the tips of your thumb and finger, you
 daintily lift a garment off the top of the pile and then drop it. Some
 kind of disguise slides off the pile.

 Reluctantly, you pick up the clothes.

>examine disguise
 This a grotesque, clownish, Punchinello mask, apparently worn by the
 mayor when he travels incognito.

>get disguise
 Taken.

>make a clown of myself
 [Use the word "out." For example, MAKE A VIRTUE OUT OF NECESSITY.]

>make a clown out of myself
 The Jack of all Traits begins to play a simple plunkety tune, and as
 the music becomes louder and louder the strange contraption starts
 looking a lot more like a box and a lot less like anything else, and
 the music gets louder and louder until...

 "Pop!"

 The lid springs open and a jester rears its jolly head.

 "Boing... Boing"

>look
 Bathroom

 The bathroom, thoroughly steamed up, is ample in space but untidy in
 appearance. A staircase leads down.

 A comb lies in a puddle of water by the bathtub.

 Against the far wall you can see a bathtub. Inside is a duck, which is
 looking confused and swimming around in circles and figure-8's.

 The door to the closet is open.

>examine jester
 You can't see any jester here!

>get comb
 Taken.

>examine comb
 The comb is distinguished by having a series of exceptionally fine
 teeth.

>search tub with fine toothed comb
 [I don't know the word "toothed."]

>search tub with finetoothed comb
 [I don't know the word "finetoothed."]

>examine duck
 Your first assumption, considering the circular swimming pattern, is
 that this is one duck which doesn't have both oars in the water. On
 closer examination, however, you determine that one of the duck's feet
 has been injured, no doubt in some boating accident.

>lame duck
 Slapping its white wings against the surface of the water and quacking
 up a storm, the angry duck creates nothing less than a raging cyclone
 in the bathtub. When the bad weather passes, you can see the rotund
 figure of the mayor, Jimmy "Fat Baby" Kazooli reclining in the tub.

 It seems that the comb is no help in searching the bathtub.

>deep six the evidence
 [I don't know the word "evidence."]

>deep six the beer
 But the six-pack of beer doesn't need to be gotten rid of.

 The mayor is sitting in the bathtub.

>go down
 Lobby

 This is the lobby of the town hall, looking stately and deeply
 lacquered. A boldly impressive staircase leads up and you can see steam
 drifting out of a room at the top of it. The main focus of attention in
 the lobby is an imposing, ornately framed document hanging on the wall.

 Public Square

 You're in the public square. Facing one edge of the square stands an
 impressive looking neo-colonial town house, which is decoratively
 fronted by a row of laurel bushes.

 In the middle of the public square stands a thick, ten feet tall stump
 of a tree. Attached to the stump is a sheet of paper.

>air laundry
 You manage to launder the mayor's dirty linen, working it over with the
 sinewy resoluteness of a peasant. Though not entirely a wholesome
 experience, you can feel from the stiff westerly breeze that it's
 serving to clear the air and bring about a cleansing effect on the
 mayor's reputation. The linen is finally caught up by one especially
 strong gust -- each piece is filled with air like a sail and drifts far
 away across the blue sky.

>why a duck?
 [I don't know the word "why."]

 The door to the closet is open.

 There's nothing special about the closet.

>l in closet
 Darkness seems to radiate out of the closet.

 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>shine light on darkness
 [I don't know the word "darkness."]

>shine light on closet
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>search closet with fine tooth comb
 Using the crack resources of the well-appointed sleuth, you
 painstakingly search the closet high and search the closet low. Sounds
 of chattering teeth and then of bones knocking together come out of the
 closet as you seem to have stirred something up. There is again quiet
 for a moment, and then a full skeleton is seen to feint out of the
 darkness, rattling to the floor in a heap.

>deep six the skeleton
 You can't "give the skeleton the deep six" without holding the
 skeleton.

>get skeleton
 Taken.

>deep six the skeleton
 As you give the skeleton the deep-six, the bones sink beneath the filmy
 surface of the water, slowly twisting and sinking much deeper than the
 tub would seem to be, until finally it disappears into the murky depths
 of Davey Jones' Locker. The mayor breathes a large foul-breathed sigh
 of relief.

>inventory
 You have a comb, a disguise, a six-pack of beer, laurels, your own horn
 and a decree.

>blow your own horn
 You give the horn a big, brassy toot. It seems to be music to the
 mayor's ears, since he for the first time really takes notice of you,
 and smiles upon your vainglorious trumpeting.

>examine decree
 The decree would outlaw all language play in town. There is a line at
 the bottom for the mayor's signature.

>rest on laurels
 This is no time for such vain self-congratulation.

>give decree to mayor
 The mayor seems to want to finish his bath before endeavoring in any
 official duties.

>give laurels to mayor
 Briskly, the mayor refuses your offer.

>examine disguise
 This a grotesque, clownish, Punchinello mask, apparently worn by the
 mayor when he travels incognito.

>throw baby out with bathwater
 From the consequential uproar, there seems to be a ring of truth in
 this phrase. In strong jets shooting at varying trajectories, the
 bathwater in the tub begins first to spout off. Suddenly, this messy
 but harmless spectacle of the spouts is over, and angry riptides ruffle
 the water's surface. Now with the tidal force of lunar determination,
 the bathwater polarizes itself around the edges of the tub and even
 higher, engulfing the mayor and leaving a wide funnel of air in the
 middle of the tub.

 As the gathering water reaches a critical peak, it pauses for one brief
 moment, and now with an awful suddenness collapses into itself to form
 a fearful wave of tubular shape and seismic strength. It gushes in
 front of your face and toward the stairs in a torrent, through which
 you can see the strange slow-motion figure of the mayor swimming half
 in air and half in water. Following the mayor inside the wave and down
 the stairway is the tub itself, which, out of your sight, makes the
 terrible crashing noise of porcelain going to smithereens.

 The mayor, wearing a white terry cloth robe with his initials stitched

 concerned with the Big Problems of Our Time.

>examine robe
 [I don't know the word "robe."]

>give laurel to mayor
 Briskly, the mayor refuses your offer.

>give disguise to mayor
 Briskly, the mayor refuses your offer.

>wear disguise
 You're now wearing the disguise.

>examine me
 You're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

>disguise intentions
 [I don't know the word "intentions."]

>give decree to mayor
 The mayor, pacing the floor and appearing cursed by the disasterous
 plague of nonsense that has beset his town, ignores the decree.
>out

 Public Square

 You're in the public square. Facing one edge of the square stands an
 impressive looking neo-colonial town house, which is decoratively
 fronted by a row of laurel bushes.

 In the middle of the public square stands a thick, ten feet tall stump
 of a tree. Attached to the stump is a sheet of paper.

>give beer to mayor
 You can't see any such thing here.

>examine house
 There's nothing noteworthy about the town house.

>examine stump
 On the tree stump you see laws of the land.

>give a stump speech
 [I don't know the word "speech."]

>stand on stump
 There's no utility in doing that.

>search bushes
 Beating around the bush, you come upon a ticket stub enmeshed in the
 dense lower branches of the laurel. You pick it up and dust it off.

>examine ticket
 The ticket is issued by the First Church of the Heavenly Ferris Wheel,
 the foremost religious institution in town. It decrees one blessing to
 be given by the bearer of the ticket to any individual.

>in
 As you approach the column-lined town house through the path dividing
 the  well-manicured lawn, you are overcome with fear and trembling and
 are forced to turn back toward the square. It seems the idea of
 entering such a reviled house of corruption with a blessing is
 spiritually and realistically impossible.

>remove diguise
 [I don't know the word "diguise."]

>remove disguise
 You remove the disguise.

>put blessing in disguise
 Sure enough, now you've got a blessing in disguise.

>give blessing in disguise
 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>in
 Furtively, you pass through the yard into the town house.

 The mayor, wearing a white terry cloth robe with his initials stitched
 on it, is here pacing the floor and looking very philosophically
 concerned with the Big Problems of Our Time.

>give blessing in disguise to mayor
 [There were too many nouns in that sentence.]

>bless mayor
 The air surrounding the mayor gradually turns pure and bright. An
 expansive campaign-smile spreads across his face as he bathes in the
 saintliness of the blessing bestowed. As the halo effect fades, it
 seems to have lifted away the dread weight of the mayor's burdens.

>give decree to mayor
 The mayor, finally convinced of the worthiness of the decree, breaks
 into a broad smile and slaps you endearingly on the back, nearly
 causing whiplash. He grabs the scrap of paper and signs it
 perfunctorily. He leaves, happily.

>examine decree
 The decree would outlaw all language play in town. There is a line at
 the bottom for the mayor's signature.

>rest on laurel
 With dreamy slowness you begin to fall back upon your laurels for the
 long, soulful respite you have so well deserved. In the enclave of your
 dreams the clarion voice of a herald is given forum:

 "We, the members of the Citizens' Action Committee of Punster, do
 hereby honor your exploits in delivering our town of the nefarious
 crime of wordplay. Punster has once again returned to a life of
 trusting normalcy.

 For the McCleary Farm, the cows have truly come home. Audiences once
 again revel in the gift of laughter. A pretty girl is rescued from the
 brink of tragedy. You have made our town safe for shopping. The Teapot
 Cafe is a homey hearth and nourishment to our supping folk. A house for
 guests has gained back its repute. A neighboring town must no longer
 live down its name.

 In gratitude to your selfless dedication to our humble town, we present
 you with the Key to the City. May it unlock all the doors for you along
 life's path."

 You fall still further into deep and luxurious sleep.
