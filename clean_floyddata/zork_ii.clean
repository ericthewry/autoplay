 Narrow Ledge
 You are on a narrow ledge within an old dormant volcano. This ledge is
 about halfway between the floor below and the rim above. There is an
 exit to the south.
 On the floor is a priceless gold zorkmid (a valuable collector's

 A strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He
 is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He
 has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard.
 The Wizard draws forth his wand and waves it in your direction. It
 begins to glow with a faint blue glow.
 The Wizard, almost inaudibly, whispers a word beginning with "F," and
 then disappears, chuckling nastily.

 Library
 This must have been a large library, probably for the royal family.
 All of the shelves have been gnawed to pieces by unfriendly gnomes. To

 A handsome book, bound in green leather, sits in the center of the

 Right beside the purple book sits a white one.
 Worn and battered in one corner of the room is a blue book.
 Lying in the dust, and covered with mold, is a purple book.

 It is written in an unfamiliar tongue and details the use of various

 devices work by pointing them at the object to be ensorcelled, and
 then chanting the appropriate magic words. (It's truly amazing how
 credulous these ancients were, isn't it?)

 The room trembles and 5000 tons of rock fall on you, turning you into
 a pancake.

 Now, let's take a look here... Well, you probably deserve another
 chance. I can't quite fix you up completely, but you can't have
 everything.

 Room of Red Mist
 You are inside a huge crystalline sphere filled with thin red mist.
 The mist becomes blue to the west.
 You strain to look out through the mist...
 You see a small room with a sign on the wall, but it is too blurry to

 Wide Ledge
 You are on a wide ledge high in the volcano. The rim of the volcano is
 about 200 feet above and there is a precipitous drop to the bottom.
 There is a small door to the south.
 There is a large and extremely heavy wicker basket here. An enormous
 cloth bag attached to the basket is inflated. A metal receptacle is
 fastened to the center of the basket. In it is a burning newspaper. A
 piece of wire tied to a hook holds the balloon in place.
 There is an explosion nearby.

 Dusty Room
 You are in a dusty old room which is featureless, except for an exit
 on the north side.
 On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
 The room is cluttered with debris from an explosion. The walls seem
 ready to collapse.
 The excessively gaudy crown of Lord Dimwit Flathead is here.

 You may recall that recent explosion. Probably as a result of it, you
 hear an ominous rumbling, as if a nearby room had collapsed.
 The lamp is definitely dimmer now.
 The Wizard appears, floating nonchalantly in the air beside you. He
 grins sideways at you.
 The Wizard draws forth his wand and waves it in your direction. It
 begins to glow with a faint blue glow.
 The Wizard, in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word "Fall!" He
 cackles gleefully.

 Topiary
 This is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls and mosses provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped hedges
 and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not
 recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of
 the bushes: There is a dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge
 misshapen dog, and several human figures. On the west side of the
 garden the path leads through a rose arbor into a tunnel.

 Formal Garden
 This is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls and a dim illumination comes from mosses far above. The path is
 of small crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and flower beds
 from south to north. To the north a small structure can be seen. To
 the south are peculiarly shaped bushes. There is a small gap in the
 hedges to the west.

>go north

 North End of Garden
 This is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day
 outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the
 roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the
 north. A carefully manicured path leads south. In the center of a
 rosebed is a small open structure, painted white. It appears to be a
 gazebo.

 North End of Garden
 This is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day
 outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the
 roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the
 north. A carefully manicured path leads south. In the center of a
 rosebed is a small open structure, painted white. It appears to be a
 gazebo.

 Topiary
 This is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern

 Menhir Room
 This is a large room which was evidently used once as a quarry. Many
 large limestone chunks lie helter-skelter around the room. Some are
 rough-hewn and unworked, others smooth and well-finished. One side of
 the room appears to have been used to quarry building blocks, the
 other to produce menhirs (standing stones). Obvious passages lead
 north and south.
 One particularly large menhir, at least twenty feet tall and eight
 feet thick, is leaning against the wall blocking a dark opening
 leading southwest. On this side of the menhir is carved an ornate
 letter "F".

 This is a small and rather dreary room, eerily illuminated by a red
 glow emanating from a crack in one wall. The light falls upon a dusty
 wooden table in the center of the room. On the south side of the room
 is a massive wooden door, which has a small window barred with iron. A
 formidable bolt lock is set within the door frame. A keyhole lies
 within the lock. A rusty iron key is in place within the keyhole.
 The vision fades, revealing only an ordinary crystal sphere.

 This is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls and mosses provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped hedges
 and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not
 recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of
 the bushes: There is a dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge
 misshapen dog, and several human figures. On the west side of the
 garden the path leads through a rose arbor into a tunnel.

 You are in a large circular room whose high ceiling is lost in gloom.
 Eight identical passages leave the room.
 A loud whirring sound comes from all around, and you feel sort of

 Oh, no! A lurking grue slithered into the room and devoured you!

    ****  You have died  ****

 Now, let's take a look here... Well, you probably deserve another
 chance. I can't quite fix you up completely, but you can't have
 everything.

 Room of Red Mist
 You are inside a huge crystalline sphere filled with thin red mist.
 The mist becomes blue to the west.
 You strain to look out through the mist...
 You see a small room with a sign on the wall, but it is too blurry to
 read.

 Dragon Room
 The room is a large cavern full of broken stone. The walls are
 scorched and there are deep scratches on the floor. A sooty dry smell
 is very strong here. A paved path winds from a large passage to the
 west, through the room, and across a huge stone bridge to the south.
 To the east a small crack is visible. A dark and smokey tunnel leads
 north.
 A huge red dragon is lying here, blocking the entrance to a tunnel
 leading north. Smoke curls from his nostrils and out between his
 teeth.
 The dragon continues to watch you carefully.

 Ice Room
 This is a large hall of ancient lava, since worn smooth by the
 movement of a glacier. A large passage exits to the east and an upward
 lava tube is at the top of a jumble of fallen rocks.
 A mass of ice fills the western half of the room.

 As the dragon enters, he sees his reflection on the icy surface of the
 glacier at its western end. He becomes enraged: There is another
 dragon here, behind that glass, he thinks! Dragons are smart, but
 sometimes naive, and this one has never seen ice before. He rears up
 to his full height to challenge this intruder into his territory. He
 roars a challenge! The intruder responds! The dragon takes a deep
 breath, and out of his mouth pours a massive gout of flame. It washes
 over the ice, which melts rapidly, sending out torrents of water and a
 huge cloud of steam! You manage to clamber up to a small shelf, but
 the dragon is terrified! A huge splash goes down his throat! There is
 a muffled explosion and the dragon, a puzzled expression on his face,
 dies. He is carried away by the water.

 When the flood recedes you climb gingerly down. While no trace of the
 dragon can be found, the melting of the ice has revealed a passage
 leading west.
 Your sword is no longer glowing.

 Carousel Room
 You are in a large circular room whose high ceiling is lost in gloom.
 Eight identical passages leave the room.
 A loud whirring sound comes from all around, and you feel sort of
 disoriented in here.

>go northwest

 You're not sure which direction is which. This room is very
 disorienting.

 Menhir Room
 This is a large room which was evidently used once as a quarry. Many
 large limestone chunks lie helter-skelter around the room. Some are
 rough-hewn and unworked, others smooth and well-finished. One side of
 the room appears to have been used to quarry building blocks, the
 other to produce menhirs (standing stones). Obvious passages lead
 north and south.
 One particularly large menhir, at least twenty feet tall and eight
 feet thick, is leaning against the wall blocking a dark opening
 leading southwest. On this side of the menhir is carved an ornate
 letter "F".

 Cool Room
 The room is cool and damp. The air is misty. A twisty path from the
 southeast splits here toward a wide northerly stone bridge, and a
 narrow westerly tunnel. It is from the latter that the mist and chill
 seem to originate.

 North End of Garden
 This is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day
 outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the
 roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the
 north. A carefully manicured path leads south. In the center of a
 rosebed is a small open structure, painted white. It appears to be a
 gazebo.

 Gazebo
 This is a gazebo in the midst of a formal garden. It is cool and

 Formal Garden
 This is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls and a dim illumination comes from mosses far above. The path is
 of small crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and flower beds
 from south to north. To the north a small structure can be seen. To
 the south are peculiarly shaped bushes. There is a small gap in the
 hedges to the west.
 The unicorn bounds lightly away.
 Your sword is no longer glowing.

 Topiary
 This is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls and mosses provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped hedges
 and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not
 recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of
 the bushes: There is a dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge
 misshapen dog, and several human figures. On the west side of the
 garden the path leads through a rose arbor into a tunnel.
 A strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He
 is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He
 has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard.
 He mutters something (muffled by his beard) and disappears as suddenly

 This is a room which is bare on all sides. There is an exit down in
 the northwest corner of the room. To the east is a great open door
 made of stone. Above the stone, the following words are written: "No
 man shall pass this door without solving this riddle:

 Tea Room
 This is a small room containing a large oblong table, no doubt set for
 afternoon tea. It is clear from the objects on the table that the
 users were indeed mad. In the eastern corner of the room is a small
 hole (no more than four inches high). There are passageways leading
 away to the west and the northwest.
 There is a large oblong table here.

 Posts Room
 This is an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden posts
 delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to be a
 wooden roof. In fact, all objects in this room appear to be abnormally
 large. To the east is a passageway. There are large gaping chasms to
 the west and northwest.
 There is a bank brochure here.
 There is a coil of black, braided string here.
 There is a square brick here which feels like clay.

>go east

 You have moved into a dark place.
 It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

 Pool Room
 This is a large room, one half of which is depressed. Salty water
 flows from a large leak in the ceiling. The only exit is to the west.
 A stoppered glass flask with a skull-and-crossbones marking is here.
 The flask is filled with some clear liquid.
 The leak has submerged the depressed area in a pool of tears. There is
 a hazy something at the deepest part of the pool.

>drop red in pool

 Most of the pool evaporates, revealing a (slightly damp but still
 valuable) package of rare candies. The red cake must be pretty strong
 stuff, since it remains intact!

 Guarded Room
 This room is cobwebby and musty, but tracks in the dust show that it
 has seen visitors recently. At the south end of the room is a stained
 and battered (but very strong-looking) door. To the north, a corridor
 exits.
 Imbedded in the door is a nasty-looking lizard head, with sharp teeth
 and beady eyes. The lizard is sniffing at you.

>give candies to lizard

 The guardian greedily wolfs down the candy, including the package. (It
 seemed to enjoy the grasshoppers particularly.) It then becomes quiet
 and its eyes close. (Lizards are known to sleep a long time while
 digesting their meals.)
 I hope you have more light than from the lamp.

 has seen visitors recently. At the south end of the room is a stained
 and battered (but very strong-looking) door. To the north, a corridor
 exits.
 The door is open.
 A sleepy-looking lizard head is mounted on the door.

 Wizard's Workroom
 This room is the Wizard's workroom. A hall continues east and west,
 and a larger room lies to the south. There are many shelves and racks
 on the walls, but the Wizard's workbench dominates the room. It is
 made of dark, heavy wood bound with iron. The workbench is stained
 from many years of use, and is deeply gouged as though some huge
 clawed animal was imprisoned on it. There are burn marks and even
 notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane items are scattered about
 the bench; alembics, mortar and pestle, small knives of various sizes,
 odd scraps of vellum, wax candles, and much more. In the center of a
 relatively clear area of the bench are affixed three stands - ruby,
 sapphire, and diamond - which form a triangle.

 Trophy Room
 This is the Wizard's trophy room, filled with memorabilia of various
 sorts. On one wall is the Wizard's D. T. (Doctor of Thaumaturgy)
 degree from GUE Tech. Several old magic wands are mounted on a wand
 rack. A collection of dull and nicked swords testify to the fate of
 many foolhardy adventurers. Small bottles contain discarded homunculi
 (a few preserved in alcohol). There is a stuffed owl on a perch.
 Imbedded in the wall is an ornate trophy cabinet.
 A hand-lettered label is affixed to the wall.

>take wands

 As your fingers near it, you get a nasty shock (but fortunately not a
 fatal one).

>open trophy

 The case is protected by a fearful spell. You cannot touch it in any

 A strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He
 is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He
 has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard.
 The Wizard draws forth his wand and waves it in your direction. It
 begins to glow with a faint blue glow.
 The Wizard, in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word "Ferment!"
 He cackles gleefully.

 Topiary
 This is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
 walls and mosses provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped hedges
 and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not
 recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of
 the bushes: There is a dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge
 misshapen dog, and several human figures. On the west side of the

 from many years of use, and is deeply gouged as though some huge
 clawed animal was imprisoned on it. There are burn marks and even
 notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane items are scattered about
 the bench; alembics, mortar and pestle, small knives of various sizes,
 odd scraps of vellum, wax candles, and much more. In the center of a
 relatively clear area of the bench are affixed three stands - ruby,

 The sword shatters the glass wall of the aquarium, spilling out an

 extremely annoyed sea serpent who bites angrily at the sword, and then
 at you. He is having difficulty breathing, and he seems to hold you
 responsible for his current problem. He manages to rend you limb from

>go down

 Ledge in Ravine
 You are on a narrow ledge near the bottom of a deep ravine. The ledge
 continues to the west. A precarious climb up to another tiny ledge is
 possible. A short scramble down the rock face leads to a stream.

>drop brochure

 Dropped.

>go down

 Deep Ford
 You are fording the stream at a deep but not impossible spot. The
 water is very cold. The walls of the ravine rise to east and west.
 There is a small ledge along the north wall of the ravine. To the
 south is the entrance to a well-constructed but somewhat ruined hall.
 A huge dead dragon is lying half blocking the stream.

>go south

 Marble Hall
 This is an arched hall of fine marble. The hall stops abruptly to the
 north at a ford across a stream, where the marble is cracked and
 broken. Perhaps a flood or collapse of the cave was responsible. To
 the south the hall opens into a large room. There is rather annoying
 whirring sound coming from that room.

>go southwest

 Guarded Room
 This room is cobwebby and musty, but tracks in the dust show that it

 exits.
 The door is open.

 Wizard's Workshop
 You are standing in the entry hall of the Wizard's Workshop. Dark
 corridors lead west and south from here. The corridor to the west
 smells slightly of incense or candle smoke. The workshop door is open.

>go west

 Wizard's Workroom
 This room is the Wizard's workroom. A hall continues east and west,
 and a larger room lies to the south. There are many shelves and racks
 on the walls, but the Wizard's workbench dominates the room. It is
 made of dark, heavy wood bound with iron. The workbench is stained
 from many years of use, and is deeply gouged as though some huge
 clawed animal was imprisoned on it. There are burn marks and even
 notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane items are scattered about
 the bench; alembics, mortar and pestle, small knives of various sizes,
 odd scraps of vellum, wax candles, and much more. In the center of a
 relatively clear area of the bench are affixed three stands - ruby,
 sapphire, and diamond - which form a triangle.
   Sitting on the ruby stand is:
     A red crystal sphere
     Sitting on the diamond stand is:
       A clear crystal sphere

>put crystal on sapphire stand

 Done.
 As you place the blue crystal sphere in the sapphire stand, a low
 humming noise begins, and you can feel the hairs on the back of your
 neck begin to stand up. The three spheres begin to vibrate, faster and
 faster, as the noise becomes higher and higher pitched. Three puffs of
 smoke, one red, one blue, one white, rise up from empty stands. The
 spheres are gone! But in the center of the triangle formed by the
 stands is now a black stand of obsidian in which rests a strange black
 sphere.

>put sphere in circle

 A cold wind blows outward from the sphere. The candles flicker, and a
 low moan, almost inaudible, is heard. It rises in volume and pitch
 until it becomes a high-pitched keening. A dim shape becomes visible
 in the air above the sphere. The shape resolves into a large and
 somewhat formidable looking demon. He looks around, tests the walls of
 the pentagram experimentally, then sees you! "Hmm, a new master..." he
 says under his breath. "Greetings, oh master! Wouldst desire a
 service, as our contract stateth? For some pittance of wealth, some
 trifle, I will gratify thy desires to the utmost limit of my powers,
 and they are not inconsiderable." He makes a pass with his massive
 arms and the walls begin to shake a little. Another pass and the
 shaking stops. "A nice effect... I find it makes for a better
 relationship to give such a demonstration early on." He grins vilely.

 The demon pauses for a moment, perhaps thinking that you should
 re-read the manual.

 Suddenly the Wizard materializes in the room. He is astonished by what

 draws forth his wand, waves it frantically, and incants "Frobizz!
 Frobozzle! Frobnoid!" The demon laughs heartily. "You no longer
 control the Black Crystal, hedge-wizard! Your wand is powerless! Your
 doom is sealed!" The demon turns to you, expectantly.

 Ledge in Ravine
 You are on a narrow ledge near the bottom of a deep ravine. The ledge
 continues to the west. A precarious climb up to another tiny ledge is
 possible. A short scramble down the rock face leads to a stream.
 There is a bank brochure here.

>go down

 Deep Ford
 You are fording the stream at a deep but not impossible spot. The
 water is very cold. The walls of the ravine rise to east and west.
 There is a small ledge along the north wall of the ravine. To the
 south is the entrance to a well-constructed but somewhat ruined hall.
 A huge dead dragon is lying half blocking the stream.

>go south

 Marble Hall
 This is an arched hall of fine marble. The hall stops abruptly to the
 north at a ford across a stream, where the marble is cracked and
 broken. Perhaps a flood or collapse of the cave was responsible. To
 the south the hall opens into a large room. There is rather annoying
 whirring sound coming from that room.

>go south

 Carousel Room
 You are in a large circular room whose high ceiling is lost in gloom.
 Eight identical passages leave the room.
 There is a dented steel box here.

>go south

 Menhir Room
 This is a large room which was evidently used once as a quarry. Many
 large limestone chunks lie helter-skelter around the room. Some are
 rough-hewn and unworked, others smooth and well-finished. One side of
 the room appears to have been used to quarry building blocks, the
 other to produce menhirs (standing stones). Obvious passages lead
 north and south.
 One particularly large menhir, at least twenty feet tall and eight
 feet thick, is leaning against the wall blocking a dark opening
 leading southwest. On this side of the menhir is carved an ornate
 letter "F".

 Cobwebby Corridor
 A winding corridor is filled with cobwebs. Some are broken and the
 dust on the floor is disturbed. The trend of the twists and turns is
 northeast to southwest. On the north side of one twist, high up, is a
 narrow crack.

>go southwest

 Guarded Room
 This room is cobwebby and musty, but tracks in the dust show that it

 The door is open.
 A sleepy-looking lizard head is mounted on the door.

 You are standing in the entry hall of the Wizard's Workshop. Dark
 corridors lead west and south from here. The corridor to the west
 smells slightly of incense or candle smoke. The workshop door is open.

>go west

 Wizard's Workroom
 This room is the Wizard's workroom. A hall continues east and west,
 and a larger room lies to the south. There are many shelves and racks
 on the walls, but the Wizard's workbench dominates the room. It is
 made of dark, heavy wood bound with iron. The workbench is stained
 from many years of use, and is deeply gouged as though some huge
 clawed animal was imprisoned on it. There are burn marks and even
 notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane items are scattered about
 the bench; alembics, mortar and pestle, small knives of various sizes,
 odd scraps of vellum, wax candles, and much more. In the center of a
 relatively clear area of the bench are affixed three stands - ruby,
 sapphire, and diamond - which form a triangle.
 Sitting on the Wizard's workbench is:
   A black obsidian stand

 This is the Wizard's trophy room, filled with memorabilia of various
 sorts. On one wall is the Wizard's D. T. (Doctor of Thaumaturgy)
 degree from GUE Tech. Several old magic wands are mounted on a wand
 rack. A collection of dull and nicked swords testify to the fate of
 many foolhardy adventurers. Small bottles contain discarded homunculi
 (a few preserved in alcohol). There is a stuffed owl on a perch.
 Imbedded in the wall is an ornate trophy cabinet.

 history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads," in the chapter on
 J. Pierpont Flathead. A more detailed history (albeit less objective)
 may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography "I'm Rich and You
 Aren't - So There!". Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing

 Wizard's Workroom
 This room is the Wizard's workroom. A hall continues east and west,
 and a larger room lies to the south. There are many shelves and racks
 on the walls, but the Wizard's workbench dominates the room. It is
 made of dark, heavy wood bound with iron. The workbench is stained
 from many years of use, and is deeply gouged as though some huge
 clawed animal was imprisoned on it. There are burn marks and even
 notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane items are scattered about
 the bench; alembics, mortar and pestle, small knives of various sizes,
 odd scraps of vellum, wax candles, and much more. In the center of a
 relatively clear area of the bench are affixed three stands - ruby,
 sapphire, and diamond - which form a triangle.

 "I hear and obey!" says the demon. He stretches out an enormous hand
 towards the wand. The Wizard is unsure what to do, pointing it
 threateningly at the demon, then at you. "Fudge!" he cries, but aside
 from a strong odor of chocolate in the air, there is no effect. The
 demon plucks the wand out of his hand (it's about toothpick-size to
 him) and gingerly lays it before you. He fades into the smoke, which
 disperses. The wizard runs from the room in terror.

 This is the Wizard's trophy room, filled with memorabilia of various
 sorts. On one wall is the Wizard's D. T. (Doctor of Thaumaturgy)
 degree from GUE Tech. Several old magic wands are mounted on a wand
 rack. A collection of dull and nicked swords testify to the fate of
 many foolhardy adventurers. Small bottles contain discarded homunculi
 (a few preserved in alcohol). There is a stuffed owl on a perch.

 large limestone chunks lie helter-skelter around the room. Some are

 the room appears to have been used to quarry building blocks, the
 other to produce menhirs (standing stones). Obvious passages lead
 north and south.
 One particularly large menhir, at least twenty feet tall and eight
 feet thick, is leaning against the wall blocking a dark opening
