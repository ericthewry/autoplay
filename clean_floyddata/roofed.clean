 Rooftop, halfway up the chimney
 You're clinging to the side of the chimney. From here you can go down
 to the rooftop or attempt to climb further up the top of the chimney.

 And below you, looking up -- instead of standing by the access door to
 make sure it doesn't close, like you told him to about six times -- is
 your older brother Anton.

 Anton notices your frozen posture halfway up the chimney. "What's the
 holdup?" he says. "Silk's not gonna collect itself, you know."

>examine me
 You're wearing a striped sleeveless top, identical to your brother's
 except for the bush of chest hair he has coming out the top of his.
 Your chin has also refused to sprout anything that isn't embarrassing.

 You are carrying nothing.

 Anton yells some climbing tips from below, which you ignore.

>examine chimney
 The brick chimney looks to be the oldest part of the building. On the
 upper part of the chimney there's a faded graffiti tag -- a circle
 with a cross within it.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>examine anton
 Your brother Anton is a broad shouldered, bearded fellow with long
 tangled brown hair and eyes with a tendency to wander. His features
 are relaxed and calm.  Like you, he's wearing the typical clothes of a
 silk collector, including the identical striped sleeveless top. He has
 the Claw and the containment unit.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>go up
 You try to climb further up, but you can't find any more suitable
 finger and toe holds.

 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

>anton, climb the chimney
 You're not really close enough to Anton to do that. Might want to call
 him over first, or follow him.

 Anton yells some climbing tips from below, which you ignore.

>call Anton
 Anton sees where you are and points to the ground, indicating that
 he'll be staying right where he is, thanks.

 Anton slaps a drumbeat on the chimney that you find distracting.

>examine tag
 You stare at it and realize it's the symbol the Bad Seeds use in their
 revolutionary communiques.

 Apparently this rooftop is their territory. One more reason to get the
 hell out of here.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>examine access door
 The access door is across the rooftop. You can't tell for sure that
 it's closed from here, but that click sound does not make you hopeful.

 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

 You're not really close enough to Anton to do that. Might want to call
 him over first, or follow him.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>go down
 You climb down, dropping the last couple of feet to...

 Rooftop, at the base of the chimney
 A brick chimney looms above you. You're at the southeast corner of the
 square rooftop -- the door you came out of is to the west, an
 overgrown garden patch is to the northwest. You can also go north,
 though there's nothing that interesting there.

 Your brother Anton is here, plucking at his red-and-white striped
 sleeveless top.

>anton, give me the claw
 Anton gives the Claw to you.

 Anton mumbles something about exploring and sets off towards the
 garden.

>examine claw
 An ingeniously crafted brass pole with pincers on one end, for those
 hard-to-get caches of spider silk, or as Anton insists on calling it,
 spizz. Adds another three feet to your reach.

 Over a bit, Anton pretends to shovel some dirt in his attempt at
 anti-farmer satire.

>examine containment unit
 A reinforced silk containment unit made by Harry's pal Rudi. It
 matches the Claw, which is a nice touch. It also has straps so you can
 wear it on your .

 Across the rooftop, Anton is kicking the foliage, making a mess.

>wear containment unit
 Not from here, you can't.

 Anton comes over, looking bored. "Remember, if you need any big
 brother advice on anything you can always ask Anton about silk or
 whatever."

>ask anton about silk
 Anton nods. "Oh yeah, we should totally get some silk before we get
 out of here, otherwise we're gonna be awful hungry tonight." He points
 at the chimney. "And I bet you there's some in there. I can smell the
 sweet sweet spizz a mile off."

>ask anton about access door
 Anton rolls his eyes. "Don't worry, Toph, I used the bag to prop the
 door open." He doesn't look over at the obviously closed door.

>slap anton
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>anton, give me the containment unit
 Anton gives the containment unit to you.

 Anton is leaning against the chimney, trying to look cool.

>wear it
 You put on the containment unit.

 Anton is making a sad attempt to climb the chimney, but stops when he
 sees you watching.

>look down
 (downward)
 There's nothing remarkable about the black surface of the rooftop. You
 just hope you don't end up having to sleep on it tonight.

 Anton is hiding behind the smokestack. Why, or from whom, you couldn't
 say.

>look
 Rooftop, at the base of the chimney
 A brick chimney looms above you. You're at the southeast corner of the
 square rooftop -- the door you came out of is to the west, an
 overgrown garden patch is to the northwest. You can also go north,
 though there's nothing that interesting there.

 Big brother Anton is here, his beefy arms crossed as he gazes at the
 city.

 Anton mumbles something about exploring and sets off towards the
 northeast corner.

>go up
 Near the base, the cracked brick provides enough finger and toe holds
 to climb to...

 Rooftop, halfway up the chimney
 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

>take silk
 You can't see any such thing.

>look up
 (upward)
 A darkish sky, a few clouds here and there.

 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

>examine chimney
 The brick chimney looks to be the oldest part of the building. On the
 upper part of the chimney there's a faded graffiti tag -- a circle
 with a cross within it.

>go up
 You try to climb further up, but you can't find any more suitable
 finger and toe holds.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>use claw
 You will have to be more specific about what you want to use the Claw
 with.

 Anton yells some climbing tips from below, which you ignore.

>push tag
 Nothing obvious happens.

 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

>erase tag
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>use claw on chimney
 Your attempt to take the chimney with the Claw makes you look as silly
 as Anton.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>go down
 You climb down, dropping the last couple of feet to...

 Rooftop, at the base of the chimney
 You can see Anton here, hitching up his pants.

 Anton is hiding behind the smokestack. Why, or from whom, you couldn't
 say.

>go northeast
 The visible exits are north, northwest, west and up (to rooftop,
 halfway up the chimney).

 Anton is leaning against the chimney, trying to look cool.

>go northwest

 Rooftop, garden patch
 Like a lot of buildings renovated in the 1990s, it's got a small
 garden patch. Fifty years later, it's still doing its best to hide the
 grey concrete and metal beneath. But it comes off as a bit of a green
 toupee in comparison to the entirely organic, silk-lined wooden
 skyscrapers they're building today in Mumbai and Shanghai.

 Judging by the rows of unruly plants, it's been a while since this
 garden was actively farmed. The access door is to the south, the
 chimney is to the southeast and there's an empty corner to the east.

 Off in the distance, Anton is making a sad attempt to climb the
 chimney, but stops when he sees you watching.

>examine garden
 You move some the dense foliage out of the way, revealing two rows of
 short, bulbous vegetables separated by a plank.

 Over a bit, Anton is leaning against the chimney, trying to look cool.

>examine vegetables
 There's a lot of the squat shiny cucumbers.

 Across the rooftop, Anton is hiding behind the smokestack. Why, or
 from whom, you couldn't say.

>examine plank
>take cucumbers
 Half-submerged in the ground, the plank is about a dozen feet long.

 Off in the distance, Anton is making a sad attempt to climb the
 chimney, but stops when he sees you watching.

 You take one of the vegetables. It's heavier than you would have
 expected, and sits comfortably in the palm of your hand like it was
 designed to do so.

 Over a bit, Anton is leaning against the chimney, trying to look cool.

>take plank
 You try, but the plank is stuck too solidly in the ground for your
 skinny arms to move.

 Across the rooftop, Anton is making a sad attempt to climb the
 chimney, but stops when he sees you watching.

>call anton
 Anton hears you and trots over. "What? Did you find some silk?"

>anton, take plank
 Anton leans over and pulls at the edge of the plank. It moves a bit,
 but then he gives up with a shrug. It's irritating, because you know
 he's strong enough. When he's angry he's liable to break everything in
 sight -- you saw him uproot a tree once.

 Anton looks at you like you're joking, but when you're not smiling he
 gets flustered.

>again
 Anton leans over and pulls at the edge of the plank. It moves a bit,
 but then he gives up with a shrug. It's irritating, because you know
 he's strong enough. When he's angry he's liable to break everything in
 sight -- you saw him uproot a tree once.

 Anton looks at you like you're joking, but when you're not smiling he
 gets flustered.

>examine cucumber
 (the vegetable)
 It looks like a hand-sized football-shaped cucumber. The skin is a bit
 shiny, and as you tilt it in the light you see it's got a hologo of
 some sort -- a circle with a cross design --  you recognize it as
 being the same one from the chimney.

 Anton's mouth is moving and his eyes are glassy. Suddenly he throws
 his arms into the air and runs in a victory circle.

>go east

 Rooftop, northeast corner
 There's a great view of the city from here -- from this distance, if
 you squint, you can't really tell most of the buildings have been
 stripped and abandoned. You know that's why Anton's always trying to
 get you guys to collect up on the rooftops, even though they've mostly
 been picked clean years ago -- so he can stare at his precious Tower.

 At the northernmost edge of the building you can see the street below,
 which you recognize as the place where you entered the building. The
 garden patch is to the west, the chimney is to the south and the exit
 door is southwest.

 Off in the distance, Anton thinks he sees a bug in the dirt, but it's
 just a pebble.

>eat cucumber
 You're about to, but at the last minute something stops you from
 biting into the taut green skin. There's something... weird about it.

 Across the rooftop, Anton pretends to shovel some dirt in his attempt
 at anti-farmer satire.

>examine tower
 The city looks prettier at twilight, when you can't see the busted
 windows and the fireblackened walls. The Tower, aside from the
 structural damage, is pretty well off, since the windows at the top
 are intact -- high enough to ward off the most determined looters. So
 far.

 For some reason, the arachnoids tended to nest in high areas, and
 there's nowhere higher than the Tower. Even twenty years after the
 giant mutant spiders died out silk collectors like your brother are
 still hell-bent on getting the legendary deposits they left on top of
 the pod.

>examine pod
 You can't see any such thing.

>go southwest

 Rooftop, by the exit
 To the west you can see a nearby building, about the same height as
 the one you're on.

 The garden patch is north, the chimney is east and the empty corner is
 northeast.

 The concrete stairwell exit is a rectangle protruding at least fifteen
 feet from the rooftop, its only feature a closed metal door.

 For (probably ill-advised) reasons of his own, Anton heads to the
 garden.

>examine door
 It's a rectangular cube sticking up out of the tarmac like a big white
 robot tooth. It's featureless except for the outline of a door, and
 the door is handleless.

 Anton comes by, patting his belly. He notices you looking at the door.

 "Don't worry, Toph," he says. "I put the bag --"

 His face falls when he looks at the door.

 "I..." He stares at the handleless door. "Toph, you gotta believe me,
 I wedged the bag in there real good. I don't..."

>open door
 There's no handle on this side.

 Anton pounds the locked door and yells for help, even though the two
 of you had walked up the six flights of stairs without seeing another
 soul.

>examine building
 It's similar to the one you're on, except that the exit door is
 hanging off its hinges. Instead of a garden there's a faded billboard
 for a long forgotten movie. Given its alphanumeric website address
 it's a few decades old at least.

 There's probably a ten foot gap between the buildings.

 "I bet I could jump that," Anton says, doing some leg stretches.

 "You bet your life?" you say, pointing to the ground below.

 Anton stops doing leg stretches.

 Anton's slumped down on the ground. "OK. We need a plan." He looks at
 you hopefully.

>Anton take plank
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>Anton, take plank
 Anton nods, but clearly he wasn't listening.

 Anton's still nervous, his eyes wide and his nostrils occasionally
 flaring.

>Anton, follow
 (the access door)
 Anton seems less freaked out.

>Anton, follow me
 Anton punches the door and then immediately regrets it.

>go north

 Rooftop, garden patch
 There's a plank between the rows of plants.

 You can also see a row of vegetables here.

 For (probably ill-advised) reasons of his own, Anton heads to the exit
 door.

>Anton, take plank
 You're not really close enough to Anton to do that. Might want to call
 him over first, or follow him.

 Over a bit, Anton is sitting on the ground. He's discovered that the
 tarmac is slightly soft and is pressing his hand into it to make a
 print.

>call Anton
 Anton hears you and trots over. "What? Did you think of a plan?"

>anton, get the plank
 Anton leans over and pulls at the edge of the plank. It moves a bit,
 but then he gives up with a shrug. It's irritating, because you know
 he's strong enough. When he's angry he's liable to break everything in
 sight -- you saw him uproot a tree once.

 Anton looks at you like you're joking, but when you're not smiling he
 gets flustered.

>tell anton about plank
 "You thinking what I'm thinking?" Anton says. "We can chop it up and
 sell it on the chopstick market!"

>dig
 What do you want to dig?

>dig garden
 What do you want to dig the plants with?

>dig plants with claw
 That's a precision instrument -- you shudder to think what Harry would
 say if you got it all clogged up with dirt.
 Your attempt to dig the garden with the Claw makes Anton snicker.

 Anton is kicking the foliage, making a mess.

>examine foliage
 It makes you think about that girl at the market who's always
 encouraging you to come down to help out on their farm. But no, Anton
 would never go for that.

 Anton's mouth is moving and his eyes are glassy. Suddenly he throws
 his arms into the air and runs in a victory circle.

>ask anton aout victory
 I only understood you as far as wanting to ask Anton.

>inventory
 You're wearing a striped sleeveless top, identical to your brother's
 except for the bush of chest hair he has coming out the top of his.
 Your chin has also refused to sprout anything that isn't embarrassing.

 You are carrying a vegetable, the containment unit (being worn and
 empty) and the Claw.

 Anton thinks he sees a bug in the dirt, but it's just a pebble.

>hit Anton
 Knocking some sense into your brother is tempting, but you know from
 experience that it's a waste of time.

 Anton pretends to shovel some dirt in his attempt at anti-farmer
 satire.

>throw cucumber at anton
 (the vegetable at Anton)
 Convincing yourself that an old fashioned food fight will let off some
 steam, you throw the veggie at Anton. It smashes into his chest, and
 -- disturbingly -- grey-green vines burst forth from the mess at a
 shocking speed to encircle your brother.

 There's a moment where he's tied up as effectively as if with rope,
 and then his stunned expression starts to darken.

 Anton's arms strain. "No... trap... from a stupid FARMER," bursting
 through the tendrils, "...can hold a Karrento!"

 The vines fall off of him into a pile at his feet and begin to rot.

 Anton's still mad, kicking at the tarmac.

>anton, get the plank
 He funnels his rage into pulling the plank free of the dirt in a cloud
 of dust!

 Anton picks up the plank.

 Anton seems to have cooled down.

>take cucumber
 You grab another of the cucumbery vegetables.

 Anton's mouth is moving and his eyes are glassy. Suddenly he throws
 his arms into the air and runs in a victory circle.

>se

 Rooftop, at the base of the chimney
 Off in the distance, Anton is kicking the foliage, making a mess.

>throw cucumber at chimney
 Leaving your hand like a green oblong snowball, it smacks into the
 chimney and sends out its viney tendrils around and around the
 structure until the tough vines cover the surface.

 Anton strolls by and lets out a low whistle. "Those farmers are
 getting trickier every year."

>go up
 Near the base, the cracked brick provides enough finger and toe holds
 to climb to...

 Rooftop, halfway up the chimney
 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

>go up
 The latticework of vines helps you scale the surface...

 Rooftop, top of the chimney
 You're on the lip of the chimney, the inside of which has been mostly
 bricked up.

 You can see the whole rooftop from here.

 Inside an alcove you spot a small amount of spider silk.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>examine silk
 It's white, with just a tiny bit of a shimmer in certain lights. Weird
 to think it'll end up in some organic skyscraper in Asia somewhere,
 reinforcing a wooden beam or strut.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>take it
 Silk's reactive with organic substances, which is why it's so valuable
 for reinforcing building materials. If you're wondering how reactive,
 you only have to look at Harry's friend Two-Fingers Nancy.

 "Toph, you see any of the white stuff up there? We gotta get us some
 spizz..." Anton calls from below.

>take silk with claw
 Carefully you pinch the silk with the Claw and gently wind the strands
 around. Harry gives you a slightly better price for it when it's in
 one piece and free of debris.

 You put it into the containment unit and engage the lock. Success!

 "Toph, you see any of the white stuff up there? We gotta get us some
 spizz..." Anton calls from below.

>go down
 You take a moment to appreciate the view before you climb down, to
 appreciate the lack of Anton's inane chatter that fills every moment
 of every day.

 Something about the top of the access door cube across the rooftop
 catches your eye. It seems to have a bulge.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>examine bulge
 You have to squint to see it across the rooftop -- it's easy to miss,
 being white-on-white, but you realize that the top of the access door
 cube has a lump of spider silk.

 You've never seen a deposit that big. It's like, good-ol-days big.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>go down

 Rooftop, halfway up the chimney
 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

>go northwest
 The visible exits are up (to rooftop, top of the chimney) and down (to
 rooftop, at the base of the chimney).

 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

>go down
 You climb down, dropping the last couple of feet to...

 Rooftop, at the base of the chimney
 Anton is here.

 Anton is hiding behind the smokestack. Why, or from whom, you couldn't
 say.

>go northwest

 Rooftop, garden patch
 You can see a rotting mess and a row of vegetables here.

 For (probably ill-advised) reasons of his own, Anton heads to the exit
 door.

>take cucumber
 As you grab another veggie Anton gives you a poke in the bum and you
 drop it into the patch.

 It explodes, and the vegetable it hit explodes, and so on around the
 patch until all the vegetables are gone.

 Anton shakes his head and wanders off. "Smooth as silk, Toph. Smooth.
 As. Silk."

>tell anton about bulge
 You're not really close enough to Anton to do that. Might want to call
 him over first, or follow him.

 Over a bit, Anton is examining the exit door minutely.

>call anton. Tell anton about bulge
 Anton hears you and trots over. "What? Did you think of a plan?"

 Anton squeezes you on the shoulder. "Nice grab!" You go on to tell him
 about the much larger cache you've spotted. His eyes grow bigger and
 bigger until you think they might pop out of his head.

>inventory
 You're wearing a striped sleeveless top, identical to your brother's
 except for the bush of chest hair he has coming out the top of his.
 Your chin has also refused to sprout anything that isn't embarrassing.

 You are carrying the Claw and the containment unit (being worn),
 inside which is a small amount of spider silk.

 Anton points off to another point of the rooftop. "Gonna see what I
 can see," he says as he walks away. "Just give a call when you need
 me."

>examine anton
 Your brother Anton is a broad shouldered, bearded fellow with long
 tangled brown hair and eyes with a tendency to wander. His features
 are relaxed and calm.  Like you, he's wearing the typical clothes of a
 silk collector, including the identical striped sleeveless top. He has
 a plank.

 Across the rooftop, Anton appears to be negotiating with the door, but
 it doesn't seem to be going well.

>examine plank
 It's about a dozen feet long.

 Off in the distance, Anton appears to be negotiating with the door,
 but it doesn't seem to be going well.

>go south

 Rooftop, by the exit
 Anton is here.

 The concrete stairwell exit is a rectangle protruding at least fifteen
 feet from the rooftop, its only feature a closed metal door.

 Anton is examining the exit door minutely.

>go up
 It's too high to jump to, and the cube's surface has no climbable
 nooks and crannies.

 Anton punches the door and then immediately regrets it.

>ask anton for plank
 Anton gives the plank to you.

 Anton is sitting on the ground. He's discovered that the tarmac is
 slightly soft and is pressing his hand into it to make a print.

>lean plank on cube
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>climb plank
 You like climbing for climbing's sake, but even so you don't see the
 point of that.

 Anton farts, pretends you did it, and then heads off, shooting back
 disgusted looks from the garden.

>put plank on cube
 You do your best, leaning the plank against the wall of the fifteen
 foot cube. Then Anton wanders by and notices what you're up to. "You
 could just climb me, Toph, I'm way more useful than that stupid
 farmer's plank."

>climb anton
 To free your hands for climbing a bit, you drop the plank.
 With ease that you've had since childhood, you scramble up your
 brother's body and end up standing on his shoulders. The body memory
 makes you recall, with a twinge, how proud your parents were of this
 ability when you were a toddler.

 The top of the exit cube is now only a few inches from your
 fingertips.

>take silk with claw
 You'd rather leave it in the containment unit, unless you have some
 specific idea of what you'd like to do with it.

>take bulge with claw
 You can't see any such thing.

>get on cube
 That's not something you can enter.

 Anton shifts and looks up with a pained look, and since you're not
 doing anything you decide to climb down off his shoulders.

>climb anton
 You climb Anton, amazed at his pungent smell given that you'd bathed
 just yesterday. One of his many mysteries.

 The top of the exit cube is now only a few inches from your
 fingertips.

>jump
 You bend your knees and with a jump you get your fingers hooked around
 the ridge of the roof. Anton goes sprawling, but a few seconds later
 you've pulled yourself up to...

 Rooftop, on top of the exit cube
 The top of the access door structure is a bit weathered but solid,
 holding you easily. You can go down from here.

 You half-think the silk is a trick of the light, but no. Here it is. A
 big sticky lump of spider silk.

 Down below you, Anton shades his eyes and watches you.

>take silk with claw
 (the large amount of spider silk with the Claw)
 You use the Claw to stuff the container full of silk. You've never
 filled the container before. You can't wait to see the look on Harry's
 face -- you'll be able to eat for weeks on this. You close the
 container.

 Anton looks up, arms folded and nodding approvingly like he's your
 supervisor or something.

>go down

 Rooftop, by the exit
 Anton is here.

 The concrete stairwell exit is a rectangle protruding at least fifteen
 feet from the rooftop, its only feature a closed metal door.

 You can also see a plank here.

 Anton appears to be negotiating with the door, but it doesn't seem to
 be going well.

>take plank
 Taken.

 Anton is examining the exit door minutely.

>examine building
 It's similar to the one you're on, except that the exit door is
 hanging off its hinges. Instead of a garden there's a faded billboard
 for a long forgotten movie. Given its alphanumeric website address
 it's a few decades old at least.

 There's probably a ten foot gap between the buildings.

 Anton wanders off to the northeast corner.

>put plank on gap
 The plank now provides a very narrow escape route to the west.

 Off in the distance, Anton is staring at the sky, a goofy grin on his
 face.

>anton, go west
 Anton arrives at Rooftop, garden patch from the east.

>go west
 Channelling your tightrope-walking ancestors, you place one foot in
 front of the other, trying not to think about--

 CRACK

 --you've never backstepped this fast but it might not be fast enough
 but then Anton grabs you in a big bear hug and pulls you to safety.

 Rooftop, by the exit (in Anton's bear hug)
 To the west you can see a nearby building, about the same height as
 the one you're on.

 The garden patch is north, the chimney is east and the empty corner is
 northeast.

 On the nearby building is a plank.

 The concrete stairwell exit is a rectangle protruding at least fifteen
 feet from the rooftop, its only feature a closed metal door.

 "TOPH!" At first you think you're shaking, but then you realize it's
 Anton.

>examine plank
 It's about a dozen feet long with a crack in the middle.

 Anton's eyes are darting around fearfully, he's muttering "Careful,
 careful careful..."

>examine billboard
 What hasn't been bleached by the sun has been soaked through by the
 rain. But you can just make out the URL: www.ghostswithshitjobs.com.

 You give your brother a squeeze and a pat on the back and the
 catatonic look leaves his face. He looks at you happily and then
 shakes you, pushes you away.

 The plank is still in one piece, barely. You lean over to pull it in
 but seeing the pavement below gives you a sick fantasy of having your
 brains spread over them. You take a few stumbling steps back from the
 edge and sit on the tarmac.

>pull plank with claw
 I only understood you as far as wanting to pull the plank.

>get plank with claw
 It's too lightweight a tool for that.

 Anton sees what you're trying to do and pulls in the plank himself.

 "That was a close one, Toph. Geez. The closest."

>anton, w
 Anton nods. "I could make that jump easy, Toph. But then where would
 that leave you?"

 Anton looks at you like you're joking, but when you're not smiling he
 gets flustered.

 The plank sticks up where it's cracked and Anton stomps it flat.

 "You shoulda tied off. Collectors die every day from being stupid."

 "Tied off?" you say, "With the rope in the bag YOU LOST?!" The
 familiar rage you feel at your brother burns away the last of nausea
 in your belly.

 "No," he says with a sullen kick at the tarmac.

>open containment unit
 Don't fiddle about with the SCU. It's for spider silk-related things
 only.

 Anton's still nervous, his eyes wide and his nostrils occasionally
 flaring.

>put silk on plate
 Which do you mean, the large amount of spider silk or the small amount
 of spider silk?

>put small amount of silk on plank
 You lay it over the length of the wood, making sure to cover the
 crack. It hisses and smokes dramatically, the wood blackening wherever
 the white fibre makes contact.

 Blinking the smoke from your eyes, you panic that it's the wrong kind
 of wood -- but the hissing has stopped.

 Anton looks at the board and at you with a baffled look on his face.

 Anton seems less freaked out.

>examine anton
 Your brother Anton is a broad shouldered, bearded fellow with long
 tangled brown hair and eyes with a tendency to wander. His features
 are relaxed and calm.

 Anton punches the door and then immediately regrets it.

>examine plank
 It's about a dozen feet long with a crack in the middle and shiny
 black veins where the silk has reacted with it.

 Anton wanders off to the exit door.

>go west
 There's a ten foot gap. You could always climb pretty much anything,
 but long jump was never your strong suit.

 Anton is sitting on the ground. He's discovered that the tarmac is
 slightly soft and is pressing his hand into it to make a print.

>put plank on gap
 You need to be holding the plank before you can put it on top of
 something else.

 Anton appears to be negotiating with the door, but it doesn't seem to
 be going well.

>take plank
 Taken.

 Anton is sitting on the ground. He's discovered that the tarmac is
 slightly soft and is pressing his hand into it to make a print.

>put plank on gap
 The plank now provides a very narrow escape route to the west.

 Anton is examining the exit door minutely.

>go west
 You look back at your brother. "OK, Anton. I'll go across first to
 make sure it's safe. Then you."

 Anton looks anxious. "I don't think so, Toph. I mean, you almost got
 turned into sidewalk jam the last time. Can't you just go down and
 open the the door from the inside?"

 It's a bad idea to leave your brother alone. The last time you left
 Anton by himself he got his pinky finger stuck in a pipe so bad he
 ended up sleeping with it for a week. But it's obvious he's not going
 to go across in this nervous state. You need to get his mind off the
 danger.

 Anton punches the door and then immediately regrets it.

>again
 You've gotta show Anton something that'll take his mind off the very
 real chance of death first.

 Anton farts, pretends you did it, and then heads off, shooting back
 disgusted looks from the northeast corner.

>show silk to anton
 Which do you mean, the large amount of spider silk or the small amount
 of spider silk?

>large amount
 Anton flips open the container and his eyes bug out of his head when
 he sees how much silk there is. "Wha--"

 Anton is blazing with excitement, all anxieties forgotten.

>go west
 Before you step out onto the plank, you look back at your brother.
 "Now we gotta be extremely careful with--"

 Anton makes a contemptuous sound. "Careful!?! If we were careful we
 never would have gotten trapped on a roof and made the score of the
 century," Anton raves, his face beaming. "Let's go! I can't wait to
 see Harry's face!"

 He pushes you to the side and strides out onto the plank.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Half way across, right on the crack, he turns around and looks at you
 with his big, puppy-dog eyes.

 He raises his arms in the air. "Take that, Pachenkos! You can't trap
 the Karrento Brothers!"

 Not wanting to draw attention to the incredible danger he's in, you
 just raise your arms and try to smile.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Anton throws his head back and guffaws, then walks safely to the other
 end of the plank.

 "C'mon Toph, let's go blow Harry's mind!"

>go west
 You cross the plank -- still totally stable, the spizz really works --
 and join your brother.

 Arm in arm, you head down the stairs, chanting "KAR-REN-TO!"

 Heading to Harry's to cash in your silk, you pass the alley between
 the buildings where you could have fallen to your death. You look
 away, not willing to face what could have happened, and instead
 clamber up on your brother's shoulders. You grab his thick mane of
 hair as he starts to gallop like a horse, just like when you were
 kids.

 Conciousness is slowly returning...

 Something inside is telling you to wake up. Part of your mind says
 "Sunrise approaches."

 Underneath your dream you feel a deep shiver... It is a chime, the
 bell of a clock-tower. Another follows, and another. You count them,
 fully awake suddenly, counting them down. Six. Five. Four. Three.

 Your eyes close, and your stomach tightens in anticipation. The sheets
 around you feel very safe.

 Two. One.

 The first ray of sunlight lances through the slats in the
 window-blind. It strikes your eyes, and you feel yourself go.

 Standing on tip-toes.


 Scaffold in the City Square
 Your head is pulled back, held by the rope pressing on your throat.
 Your toes pivot on a rickety stool, which shakes as your legs shake.
 The crowd filling the square are chattering like monkeys, but they are
 just flits of colour in the corners of your eyes. You cannot look
 round - instead you gaze straight across the Square, to the great dial
 of the Clock.

    Coming over the crest of the thickly wooded hill, you see the
 decrepit shack that has always been your home.  Your long walks
 through the Appalachian hills usually help clear your mind.  You had
 hoped that the throbbing, insistent pain behind your eyes would go
 away with this one.  You still don't want to admit it, but this pain
 is exactly how it felt the last two times.  You better get your
 camera.  After all, this is why you bought it.


 Hill Top
    You are on the top of the hill just south of your house, standing
 ankle deep in autumn leaves.  The path you are walking on leads to the
 south.  Your trusty thinking stump is right beside the path here.

>examine stump
 You have many fond memories of sitting on this stump in the dappled
 shade and contemplating life.

>sit on stump
 You sit, but all of your thoughts focus on the pain in your head and
 how much worse that pain will get if you don't get out to the clearing
 soon.

 I don't know the word "valium".

>count leaves
 I don't know the word "count".

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>go north
 You're not going anywhere until you get off of the stump.

 Back Door
    The peeling paint reveals the low quality lumber used to build this
 house.  You've noticed that the house groans and protests more every
 winter.  In many ways, you're amazed it has survived this long.  The
 screen door leans against the house, having pulled free of the rotting
 door frame several months ago.  There is a huge patch of weeds to the
 northwest that used to be a garden.  The back door is to the north,

>go north
 Back Door
    The peeling paint reveals the low quality lumber used to build this
 house.  You've noticed that the house groans and protests more every
 winter.  In many ways, you're amazed it has survived this long.  The
 screen door leans against the house, having pulled free of the rotting
 door frame several months ago.  There is a huge patch of weeds to the
 northwest that used to be a garden.  The back door is to the north,
 and the path back over the hill leads south.

>go northwest
 You dread going past what's left of your garden in order to get to
 your well.  The weeds stand tall in the cool fall air, mocking you.

 The pain in your head gets much worse, whether from getting a closer
 look at you garden or from the impending 'visit', you aren't sure.  It
 goes away when you return to the back door.

>Pull weeds
 It's too far away.

>examine weeds
 You and Maybel planted the garden together in the spring, before your
 headaches started.  After the headaches and the visits started, you
 picked what you could and let the rest go to seed.

>mock weeds
 I don't know the word "mock".

>se
 Your house is to the north, and the path is to the south.  There's no
 sense in plundering through the woods until it's absolutely necessary.

>go north
 As you grab the doorknob, the pain in your head gets worse.  You rub
 the bridge of your nose, hoping that will help.  It doesn't.  You
 don't have much time now, so you press into the house.

 "Is your headache gone?"  Maybel turns from the sink to look at you.
 Soapy water drips from the ends of her fingers as she looks at you
 carefully, taking in your shaking hands, the wild look in your eyes.
 Her fingers clench.  "When you asked me to move in with you, we made
 some ground rules.  I don't talk about your dad, and you don't act
 like him.  No you-ef-ohs and no skits-o-frenia, right?  I've been
 holdin' up my end.  Where the hell is yours?" She swears and turns
 back to the sink.

 Kitchen
    Your tiny kitchen barely has room for you and Maybel, let alone
 your small appliances.  The living room is to the north, and the back
 door is south.
    Maybel is washing dishes.

>go north
 Living Room
    This is really the only room in your house that seems somewhat
 homey.  The plywood floor is mostly covered by a large throw rug.  The
 wood-burning stove casts a cheery glow on the sagging couch and the
 coffee table overflowing with books.  The front door leads north, your
 bedroom is to the west, and the kitchen is to the south.

>go west
 Bedroom
    This is the only bedroom in the house.  Once you shared it with
 your parents.  Then you had it to yourself when your mom moved out and
 your dad went to the asylum.  Now you share it with Maybel.  Clothes
 and the old mattress that you use as a bed mostly cover the dirty
 plywood floor.  There is one meticulously clean spot near the bed,
 reserved for the camera and the pictures. The living room is back
 east.
    You see a Polaroid camera, a photo, and a set of grainy pictures
 here.

>camera GET!!!!!
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>get camera
 Taken.

>examine photo
 This is the one photo that you managed to take the last time this
 happened.  You couldn't take pictures when "it" was overhead because
 of all of the wild, incomprehensible thoughts they sent screaming
 through your brain.  They let go of your mind only when you were
 almost unconscious.  The ship started moving off over the tree-tops.
 You managed to get the polaroid up to snap a picture of the receding
 light through the branches of the trees.  It's not enough to convince
 anyone else, but it might be enough for you.  Something to help you
 believe that you're not as crazy as your father-- if your father
 really is crazy.

>examine pictures
 Every time you look at these pictures you think of your father giving
 the film to you.  He was home just to pick up some clothes before the
 sheriff drove him out to the asylum.  He pulled the undeveloped roll
 out from under the mattress and pressed it into your hand, saying,
 "Believe.  You're my son.  They'll come for you too."  That was ten
 years ago.  The developed pictures are blurred and grainy, but
 unmistakably the same thing that has already visited you twice.
 Judging from the pain in your head, a third visit is on the way.

 Kitchen
    Your tiny kitchen barely has room for you and Maybel, let alone

    Maybel is washing dishes.

>give camera to maybel
 "Oh, go take yer pictures in the woods," Mabel spits the words at you,
 "Maybe you can sell 'em to the Nah-shun-el En-choir-er!"  She snorts.
 "Wouldn't that be funny.  You makin' money off this.  Ha!"

>examine me
 Assuming you haven't lost your grip on reality, you are Isaiah Knott,
 a twenty-seven year old man from the Appalachian mountains.  You are
 wearing your comfortable jeans, a thick flannel shirt, and hiking
 boots.

 You have a hellishly bad headache that's threatening to get worse.

>examine camera
 This is your treasured camera, the thing that will (hopefully) prove
 your sanity-- at least to yourself.  You had to save up for a month
 before you could buy it.

>go north
 Living Room
    This is really the only room in your house that seems somewhat
 homey.  The plywood floor is mostly covered by a large throw rug.  The
 wood-burning stove casts a cheery glow on the sagging couch and the
 coffee table overflowing with books.  The front door leads north, your
 bedroom is to the west, and the kitchen is to the south.

>examine books
 Looking at the books reminds you of meeting Maybel at the library.
 When you first started dating her you were both reading every trashy
 thriller and spy novel you could get your hands on, often over the
 other's shoulder.  Recently, though, you've started getting more and
 more books about UFO's and mental health.  Your reading material has
 slowly diverged until now you have two completely separate piles of
 books, encamped on opposite ends of the coffee table.

>read books
 You pick up one of the mental health books and open it.  The letters
 are blurred, and trying to push your eyes into focus aggravates the
 pain behind your nose.  The best thing for your mental health right
 now is to get you camera and get out to the clearing.

>take books
 You pick up one of the mental health books and open it.  The letters
 are blurred, and trying to push your eyes into focus aggravates the
 pain behind your nose.  The best thing for your mental health right
 now is to get you camera and get out to the clearing.

 I don't know the word "yup".

 house.  You've noticed that the house groans and protests more every
 winter.  In many ways, you're amazed it has survived this long.  The
 screen door leans against the house, having pulled free of the rotting
 door frame several months ago.  There is a huge patch of weeds to the
 northwest that used to be a garden.  The back door is to the north,
 and the path back over the hill leads south.

>go south
 Hill Top
    You are on the top of the hill just south of your house, standing
 ankle deep in autumn leaves.  The path you are walking on leads to the
 south.  Your trusty thinking stump is right beside the path here.

>go south
 Path
    This is the path that most of your walks follow.  In general, your
 walks are more pleasant than this one is turning out to be.  The path
 curves off to the southwest, but you know that if you don't head for
 the clearing to the southeast, the pain will start making you throw
 up.

>se

    You plunge off of the beaten path through the underbrush.  The pain
 in your head pushes you through a blur of brambles and branches.  Your
 body presses on even after your will has given up, as if it were
 possible to outrun this spike of pain.  Droplets of water spattering
 your face bring you around long enough to realize that you've just
 splashed through a wide, shallow stream.  There isn't one within miles
 of your house.

    It's only when your legs give out completely and you end up
 sprawled on a grassy clearing that you realize the pain has stopped:
 you've arrived.  The "ship" is already here, hovering about 30 feet up
 and quietly humming.  Amazingly, they aren't clouding your thoughts
 like they did the last two times. You roll onto your back, bring the
 polaroid up, and start photographing the ship between labored breaths.
 The mechanical whine of your Polaroid drowns out the gentle hum of the
 ship.  Picture after picture comes spewing out of the camera's mouth.

    The fatigue from running catches up with you, forcing your head
 back into the thick grass.  Once your head is relaxed, there isn't
 much keeping your eyelids open.  You find yourself relaxing into
 darkness.  As your conciousness recedes, you start to feel things
 crawling into your hair, crawling in and you need to lift your head,
 lift your head up right now and push out of the darkness, get away
 from the things crawling in your hair, lift your head and

 wake up.

    You blink your eyes, and see that you're in a hospital ward.  Even
 after getting up, it takes you several moments to realize that this
 can't possibly be a hospital.  There's no bed, no instruments-- no
 doors, for that matter.  There is only blinding whiteness and
 sterility all around you.

 White Room
    The room is of uniform whiteness, and far too bright.  The air
 tastes odd; perhaps it is the lack of any detectable odors that makes
 it strange.

 A deep breath brings in a faint hint of nervous sweat-- your own.  At
 least you can smell something.

>smell me
 There is just the faintest hint of nervous sweat about you.

>exits
 I don't know the word "exits".

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>stand
 You're already standing!

 A section of one wall turns to a thick white mist.  An alien steps
 through the mist, which becomes seamless wall again.  The alien raises
 its slender hand, palm toward you.

>raise hand
 I don't know the word "raise".

>hit alien
 You strike at the alien, but your blows are stopped by an invisible
 force.  The alien shakes its head and steps through the wall.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 White Room
    The room is of uniform whiteness, and far too bright.  The air
 tastes odd; perhaps it is the lack of any detectable odors that makes
 it strange.

    An alien is here.

>wave
 I don't know the word "wave".

>scream in rage
 I don't know the word "scream".

>say live long and prosper
 I don't know the word "live".

>alien, hello
 The alien stands and blinks its large eyes for a few seconds.  Finally
 you see its mouth curl into a tiny smile and its head bobs politely.

 The alien gestures to its right, and a yellow square slides out of the
 wall and hovers by its hand.

>examine square
 If ever there were a perfectly two dimensional object, this would be
 it.  It looks like someone has found a way to apply yellow paint
 directly onto a square swatch of thin air.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 yellow square, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>eat square
 The yellow square doesn't appear appetizing.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 yellow square, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>feed alien with square
 I don't know the word "feed".

>say "Hello" to square
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>alien, square
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>lick square
 I don't know the word "lick".

>say square
 You should say what you want to say in double quotes, for example, SAY
 "HELLO".

 The alien moves toward you and gently pushes your jaw up and down
 before retreating again and pointing at the square.  It seems the
 alien wants you to say something.  Something about the square,
 probably.

>talk to square
 I suppose you can talk to it, but it can't hear you.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 yellow square, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>say "yellow"
 As soon as the word 'yellow' leaves your mouth, you can feel the flesh
 on your scalp tingle and crawl in lazy waves down to the nape of your
 neck.  The alien gently turns the yellow square around an invisible
 vertical axis.  The other side is red.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 red square, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>say "SQUARE"
 The alien cocks its head as though listening.  It shakes its head.
 Apparently, you didn't say what it wanted to hear.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 red square, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>say "red"
 The same tingling sensation washes over your head.  The alien turns
 the square again, but now the other side is blue.  Odd.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 blue square, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>say "blue"
 It feels like an army of millipedes is wending through your hair.  The
 colored square slips silently back into the wall, and a gray sphere
 slides out in its place.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 gray sphere, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>say "sphere"
 You can't decide whether the tingling on your scalp is relaxing or
 annoying.  It certainly makes you think that there's something on your
 head besides your hair.  The alien pushes down on the sphere, which
 sprouts points and becomes a pyramid.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 gray pyramid, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>say "pyramid"
 The prickles spread out on your head.  The alien pushes on the
 pyramid, causing its top point to flattens and spread, turning it into
 a cube.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 gray cube, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>say "your mother"
 The alien cocks its head as though listening.  It shakes its head.
 Apparently, you didn't say what it wanted to hear.

 The alien is repeatedly opening and closing its tiny mouth and
 patiently gesturing with its delicate arms.  First it points to the
 gray cube, then it points to its own mouth, and repeats.

>say "cube"
 As the final mass of tingles complete their journey across your scalp,
 the alien politely bows toward you.  The gray shape vanishes the same
 way that it came.

 Three colored shapes rise up out of the floor and hover in front of
 you.  A large green button blossoms at your feet.  The alien holds up
 its hand, as if to say 'Patience'.  It presses the green button, and
 looks at the three multi-colored spots that briefly spin around its
 head.  Then the alien gets lost in a bizarre sequence of pushing and
 turning the shapes, making them change shape and color.  Every now and
 then it presses the green button again and looks thoughtfully at the
 spots that momentarily appear.

 It turns one last shape with a decisive flair, and pushes the green
 button.  The three spots that appear are all green, and a part of the
 wall dissolves into mist.  The alien makes a final bow towards you and
 walks through the misty doorway, which solidifies behind it.

 The three shapes buck and spin, resetting themselves.

>sapes
 I don't know the word "sapes".

>examine shapes
 Which shapes do you mean, the red cube on the left, the yellow sphere
 in the middle, or the blue pyramid on the right?

>examine cube
 A soft red light effuses from the floating cube.

>look
 White Room
    The room is of uniform whiteness, and far too bright.  The air
 tastes odd; perhaps it is the lack of any detectable odors that makes
 it strange.

 There are three floating shapes and a large green button in the floor.
    You see a red cube on the left, a yellow sphere in the middle, and
 a blue pyramid on the right here.

>examine button
 It is a sturdy green button set in the floor.

>press button
 A green spot, a yellow spot and a black spot twirl into existence.
 They dance about your head for a moment, and then spin out of sight.

>feel square
 I don't see any square here.

>feel cube
 You tug on the cube, trying to pull it out of its appointed spot.  It
 refuses to budge, although it seems like you could turn it or push it.

>poke cube
 Poking the red cube on the left doesn't seem to have any effect.

>push cube
 As you push down on the cube, its sides bulge and its corners vanish.
 When you let up it settles back into place as a sphere.

>turn sphere
 Which sphere do you mean, the red sphere on the left, or the yellow
 sphere in the middle?

>red
 You grab the floating sphere and turn it.  It seems to click into
 place, changing the color from red to yellow.

 I don't know the word "mid".

>turn middle
 You grab the floating sphere and turn it.  It seems to click into

>push left
 As you push down on the sphere, four points start growing out of its
 smooth surface.  When you let up it settles back into place as a
 pyramid.

>push button
 Two green spots and a red spot twirl into existence.  They dance about
 your head for a moment, and then spin out of sight.

>push right
 As you push down on the pyramid, its edges begin to flow and multiply.
 When you let up it settles back into place as a cube.

>push button
 Three green spots twirl into existence.  They dance about your head
 for a moment, and then spin out of sight.  The tingles are
 particularly intense and cover your entire skull before fading.  A
 part of the wall dissolves into mist, forming a doorway out.

>say "O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
 Okay, "O frabjous day!  Callooh!  Callay!".

>exit
 You step through the door, which promptly disappears.  It takes you a
 few seconds to adjust to the scene around you.  Eventually, the
 message gets through to your brain that something is terribly,
 terribly wrong.

 Hill Top
    You are on the top of the hill just south of your house, surrounded
 by trees and spring-time air.  The familiar path beneath your feet
 leads south, just like it always has.  A thick fog in the distance
 obscures a normally beautiful view of the surrounding hilltops.
 There's something subtly wrong with the whole situation, but you can't
 quite put your finger on it-- something about the trees.

>examine trees
 You stare at the trees for a long time before you realize what's
 wrong.  Even though the surface of the trees looks rough, their edges
 are perfectly smooth.  It's as though someone took a smooth cylinder
 and pasted a picture of rough bark on top of it.

 As you get caught up in this discovery, you almost fail to notice the
 initials carved into one of the prominent trees near the path.  A tree
 that you don't remember at all.

>examine initials
 This tree stands precisely on the spot where your thinking stump
 should be.  As you look at the tree, and the initials carved in it,
 you can almost feel a glimmer of recognition in the back of your mind,
 but you're still too befuddled by the loss of your stump.  Worse yet,
 there's no good place to sit and think about this.

>lean on tree
 I don't know the word "lean".

>read initials
 The initials are the classic lovers pair, wrapped in a heart:

 Peter Knott and Esther Minnow.  Mom and Dad.  The ten year old memory
 pushes its way to the front of your mind:  Mom tearfully packing her
 few things, Dad alternately yelling at her and pleading with her.  It
 wasn't until Aunt Betty picked her up and they drove out of sight that
 it really hit Dad.  He took an axe out the back door and attacked the
 tree that had witnessed his proposal to her.  It was a thick tree.
 Curses and saliva kept flying out of his mouth in an almost constant
 stream as he kept chopping.  You couldn't bear to watch him and took a
 long walk through the woods, but it didn't help.  The relentless
 chopping echoed off of the hilltop like rifle fire.  It was a couple
 hours later that you heard the tree fall.

 After he went to the asylum, you sawed off all of the splinters and
 turned the stump into a seat.  Now, amazingly, it's a tree once
 again-- initials and all.

>remember dad
 I don't know the word "remember".

>weep tearfully
 I don't know the word "weep".

>listen
 You stand still and carefully listen to the woods.  No birds are
 singing, no leaves are rustling.  The trees are still and silent.

>go north
 Back Porch
    The building to the north looks far too good to be your house.  It
 sports new aluminum siding and shingles; the screen door is in place
 and freshly painted.  Off to the northwest, the garden is an explosion
 of color.  The path through the woods leads back south.

>go northwest
 Garden
    The garden that you let go to weed is flourishing here.  Tulips add
 color to the first greens of the vegetables pushing up through the
 ground.  The well is here, surrounded by flowers.  The front of the
 house is to the northeast and the back is to the southeast.
    You see a broken hoe here.

>pick flowers
 I don't understand that sentence.

>examine hoe
 It is painfully obvious that the hoe is broken beyond repair.  The
 break in the middle of the handle is completely smooth; it looks sawed
 through, not broken.

 Your eyes try to take stock of the familiar-yet-not living room, but
 they are instead immediately drawn to the figure on the couch, who
 rises and walks toward you, hand extended.  "Isaiah!  You're here!
 Let me have a look at you!"

 Your brain reels.  It's your father, looking exactly like he did
 before he went insane ten years ago.

 "You've really grown up, huh?  Having to take care of your mom these
 past couple months?  Well, now that they've got you too, maybe this
 testing will go faster.  They'll take us home soon.  Have a seat."  He
 resumes his place on the couch.

 With all the other changes, it really shouldn't bother you that the

    You see a big, blue Pontiac here.

>drive

    You begin to follow the gravel road towards town simply because
 that seems like the best place to go.  It doesn't take long for you to
 realize that you don't have a choice.  The view of the road in front
 of you is unobstructed, but about fifty feet off the road on either
 side is a thick, opaque fog.  You turn off on one of the side streets,
 thinking, "It's only fog."  When the car pushes into the fog, you
 literally cannot see anything beyond the car itself.  You nudge the
 car forward at about five miles per hour, and eventually see a trace
 of road in front of you.  With your eyes fixed on the line down the
 middle of the road, you slowly accelerate until the fog starts to
 lift.  Looking up, you see that you're back on the road heading into
 town.

    Resignedly, you follow the road into town.  If you were expecting
 to be comforted by the sight of other people, you remain unconsoled.
 No one else is driving on the streets, no one is out walking.  The few
 houses brave enough to stick out of the fog are all dark and silent.
 The marked path of road comes to a stop right in front of Pop's
 market.  You park in the prime two-hour spot right in front of the
 store.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of competition for it.

>look
 Outside Pop's, in the big, blue Pontiac
    Now that you're at the end of the road, the fog has spread out just
 enough to give you a taste of town.  What you can see is exactly like
 you remember it, perhaps a little cleaner, a bit newer.  Pop's store
 stands before you to the south, and the library sits regally to the
 north, the two real landmarks of Springfield.

>enter store
 The Pop's isn't important.

>enter library
 It's too far away.

>go north
 You head towards the library, not quite sure what you're looking for,
 but hopeful that you'll find something useful.  You stride up the
 steps, pull the door open, and come up against a wall of fog, just
 beyond the doorway.  Holding your arms out in front of you, you press
 into the fog, but you still end up coming back out of the library.
 You retreat to Pop's stoop.

>go south
 Inside Pop's
    The comforting familiarity of Pop's storefront vanishes when you
 enter.  All of the aisles are barren and empty.  The candy display
 visible from outside is conspicuously absent.  The only reason you
 have to think that this is actually Pop's store is a young-looking Pop
 standing behind the counter.

 Pop looks at you and grins.  "Howdy, Isaiah!  Looks like you got on
 board okay."  He takes in your slack-jawed expression for a moment.
 "I 'spose you're wonderin' how old Pop got himself on board this ship
 when you probably saw him just a couple of days ago in town, lookin' a
 lot older.  The answer is that I ain't Pop, just a robot that looks
 and acts a lot like him.
    "I'm tellin' you this up front so you won't think I'm trying to
 hide stuff from you.  We tried not telling your dad right away, but
 when he figured it out, boy was he sore!  He still won't come into
 town.
    "Anyhow, I'm here to help you out.  I'll tell you everything I
 know, but I warn you now that I don't know everything.  If anything
 breaks, bring it to me and I'll try to fix it.  'Kay?"
    Pop is standing behind the counter.

>give hoe to po
 I don't know the word "po".

 Pop takes the pieces of the broken hoe and looks them over.  "Broke
 again, eh?  That's only the fourth time this month.  I think our hosts
 are finally startin' to realize that they just can't make good tools
 with their fields.  Lucky for you, they picked up an actual hoe when
 they got you.  Only costs a crystal duck."

>ask pop about world

>ask pop about dad
 "To tell you the truth, our hosts are gettin' a bit worried about him.
 When he first looked like he was down in the dumps, they figured it
 was just the stress of the asylum and what-not.  They figured out how
 to make him forget all about that, but he still doesn't seem up to his
 old self, you know?  That's one of the big reasons they started
 talkin' to you.  Maybe you can snap him out of it."

 You carefully watch Pop to make sure.  Yep, he clicks when he blinks.

    This is the major hub of this path.  It splits to the south and

 menacing contraption.

>examine contraption
 The large metal contraption is fairly straightforward in design.  It
 has a platform that comes up to your chest, supporting a hollow,
 transparent cylinder.  It also has an axe, connected to a large,
 tightly wound spring arm, ready to sweep horizontally across the top
 of the cylinder.  Presumably, the purpose of the axe is to discourage
 the theft of the beautiful crystalline duck, resting serenely in the
 cylinder.

 You reach into the cylinder, wondering how good of an idea this is.
 You lift the duck, and you simultaneously hear a mechanical chuff and

 the duck.  The bruise is already becoming visible.

 There's a sharp prick in your neck, and you slap at the pain and spin
 around to see what it was.  You are dismayed to find that the world

    The building to the north looks far too good to be your house.  It

 Bedroom
    The bedroom has also learned of the wonders of carpeting, and your
 shoddy mattress has been replaced with a beautiful brass bed.  In the
 south-west corner of the room is a giant metal cylinder with rounded
 ends.  It stands well over eight feet tall, and comes close to
 brushing the ceiling.  The only break in the seamless metal is a pad
 protruding out of its side.

>examine cylinder. x pad
 In many of the abduction stories that you read, there were cylinders
 like this one that contained other abductees.  This one is certainly
 large enough.

 A keypad protrudes from the cylinder's side and has nine keys, each
 with a different alien symbol on it.

 Since you stand little chance of deciphering the nine different alien
 symbols, you decide to treat the three by three grid of buttons as a
 touch-tone phone and mentally number it that way.

 "You noticed that too, huh?  When I first got here, I was real
 suspicious about that thing, so I hung around the bedroom a lot.  An
 alien came in and punched in a code, and a window opened up in it.
 The code was 5222."  He types on an imaginary keypad in front of him.
 "I guess my watching made them suspicious.  That night, when I tried
 to look through the window, they snuck up and hit me with one o' those
 hypos-- took me right out.  I woke up in my bed the next morning.  I
 went back and looked through the window again, but it was empty."  He
 stops and thinks for a minute.  "I think that was when they took the
 wires out of my head, too."  He reaches over and gives one of the
 wires on your head a playful tweak.

 Click.

>examine wires
 I don't see any wires here.

>examine head
 You run your fingers back over your head, and are shocked to discover
 four wires (tubes?  It's hard to tell from touching them) coming out
 of the top of your head and re-entering your skull at the base of your
 neck.  What have they done to you?

>type 5222
 (on the keypad)
 You start pressing buttons.  When you finish with the sequence, a
 large section of the metal cylinder slowly becomes transparent.  The
 keypad chimes when the process completes.

>examine cylinder
 In many of the abduction stories that you read, there were cylinders
 like this one that contained other abductees.  This one is certainly
 large enough.

 Now you have a chance to see what is inside the enigmatic cylinder.  A
 large rectangle of the cylinder has become a dark window to the
 interior.

 A keypad protrudes from the cylinder's side and has nine keys, each
 with a different alien symbol on it.

>look inside cylinder
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>look in cylinder
 There's nothing in the metal cylinder.

>examine window
 Without any light coming from within the cylinder, you are forced to
 press your face up against the window and cup your hands around your
 eyes.  At first you can see nothing but a small ball of faintly
 glowing blue light.  As your eyes adjust to the darkness within, you
 can tell that the faint glow is like a turbulent lightning storm;
 there are localized pockets of activity which occasionally leap across
 the length of the ball, lighting up new regions in a chaotic pattern.

 You continue to watch, fascinated, until you realize that the blue
 glow is faintly illuminating what's beneath it:  your face.  Somehow,
 you are looking at your own body inside of the cylinder, except that
 your head is open and there is a glowing ball where your brain should
 be.

 Tingles slide down your scalp, and the faintly glowing brain within
 the cylinder explodes with arcs of color and flashes of light.  As the
 shock passes, the tingles on your scalp recede, and the glowing brain
 dims to its previous state.

 Your heart crawls into your throat as you wait for what you think
 might happen. Finally, you see your alternate self blink, and hear a
 faint 'tik' through the skin of the cylinder.

>smile
 I don't know the word "smile".

>examine clone
 I don't know the word "clone".

>examine me
 Assuming you haven't lost your grip on reality, you are Isaiah Knott,
 a twenty-seven year old man from the Appalachian mountains.  You are
 wearing your comfortable jeans, a thick flannel shirt, and hiking
 boots.

 There are four wires protruding out of your head.

>examine body
 I don't know the word "body".

>examine window
 You press against the window again, grotesquely fascinated with your
 doppleganger inside.  The chaotic lightshow emanating from its open
 skull is fascinating and disconcerting.  The faint, regular ticks
 float out to you as your other self blinks.

>examine doppleganger
 I don't know the word "doppleganger".

 You firmly pull on one of the wires.  It's like pulling on a large

 the duck.  The bruise is already becoming visible.

 You start heading back up the path toward your house.  As the trail
 curves around a large tree, you are startled to find an alien standing
 in the middle of the path, shaking its head.

 There's a sharp prick in your neck, and you slap at the pain and spin
 around to see what it was.  You are dismayed to find that the world
 continues spinning past you even though you are sure your body has

    Now that you're at the end of the road, the fog has spread out just
 enough to give you a taste of town.  What you can see is exactly like
 you remember it, perhaps a little cleaner, a bit newer.  Pop's store
 stands before you to the south, and the library sits regally to the
 north, the two real landmarks of Springfield.
    You see a big, blue Pontiac here.

>enter car
 Okay, you're now in the big, blue Pontiac.

 Garden
    The garden that you let go to weed is flourishing here.  Tulips add

 Although the garden itself doesn't need hoeing, you would like to hack
 out that unsightly clod of dirt.  With a couple of well placed swings,
 you sever the roots clinging to the clod.

 In many of the abduction stories that you read, there were cylinders
 like this one that contained other abductees.  This one is certainly
 large enough.

 Now you have a chance to see what is inside the enigmatic cylinder.  A
 large rectangle of the cylinder has become a dark window to the
 interior.

 A keypad protrudes from the cylinder's side and has nine keys, each
 with a different alien symbol on it.

>examine window
 You press against the window again, grotesquely fascinated with your
 doppleganger inside.  The chaotic lightshow emanating from its open
 skull is fascinating and disconcerting.  The faint, regular ticks
 float out to you as your other self blinks.

 Hill Top
    You are on the top of the hill just south of your house, surrounded
 by trees and spring-time air.  The familiar path beneath your feet
 leads south, just like it always has.  A thick fog in the distance
 obscures a normally beautiful view of the surrounding hilltops.  You
 are surrounded by artificial trees.  One of them has initials carved
 into it.

 Attacking the initialed tree doesn't appear productive.

 This tree stands precisely on the spot where your thinking stump
 should be.  As you look at the tree, and the initials carved in it,

 but you're still too befuddled by the loss of your stump.  Worse yet,
 there's no good place to sit and think about this.

    The living room is tastefully decorated.  Plush wall-to-wall

 Every detail about Pop's store is perfect:  the green canopy awning

 speckled formica on top.  You feel a tric kle of sensation down your

 somewhat:  the desk is now only partially obscured.

 You continue to look at the desk, and start thinking about little
 details:  the thunk of the mechanical card puncher, printing the date
 on your library cards.  The line of tickling down your head starts up
 again, and the fog starts blowing away from the desk.  Soon you find
 yourself remembering the aisles of gold carpet that led to the shelves
 behind the front desk, and the small windows up by the vaulted
 ceiling.  As the details begin pouring into your head, the trickle on
 your scalp becomes a torrent of tingling, and the fog seems to retreat
 at the speed of thought.  Soon you are standing in the library you
 remember.

 about all of the abductees, and saw their stories had to be true.  I

 You must have read each of these articles hundreds of times, perhaps
 trying to glean some deeper meaning out of them, maybe just to make
 yourself numb to the implications.  Every detail of these articles has
 been pressed into your being. You know every word before you read it.
 The first is from ten years ago:

 Springfield --  A man police have identified as
    Peter Knott walked into a restaurant with an
    illegal handgun  and opened fire  yesterday,
    killing  one  and  critically   injuring two
    others  before employees  managed to wrestle
    him to the ground.

        According to witnesses, he was screaming
    "Wife-stealers!"   repeatedly.  We talked to
    his  neighbors,  and learned that  Knott  is
    convinced  that aliens  have  been abducting
    him  for the  past  several months,  and the
    stress of his claims caused his wife to move
    out.

        At  the  urgings  of his  lawyer,  Knott
    pleaded  no contest at  his hearing  and has
    been  committed  to an institution  for  the
    criminally insane.


 The other is from just two weeks ago:

 Springfield --  Although ten years  have passed
    since  Peter Knott  went  on  his  murderous
    rampage,  the people of Springfield have not
    forgotten.

       Upon hearing that the home considered him
    rehabilitated and was considering  releasing
    him early, a large crowd gathered around the
    Mayor's office and staged a  loud protest on
    his lawn.

       The mayor promised to do his best to stop
    Knott's release, but unless the county comes
    up with more  money for  the facility,  they
    will have to release twenty patients and lay
    off several staff members in order to remain
    operational.

       A spokesman for the complex said: "We are
    only thinking of releasing those individuals
    that  have  responded  completely  to  their
    therapy and that  we believe  pose no threat
    to themselves or to others."

 anybody.  Unless these aliens are body snatchers, and it was my evil

 are surrounded by artificial trees.  One of them has initials carved

    Your dad is here.

 Your dad keeps running his hand over the tree with the initials carved
 in it, and muttering.

>give axe to dad
 Your father looks at you for a long moment before it registers what
 you are offering.  He accepts the axe grimly.  Your dad looks at the
 axe solemnly for a moment, and a tear streams down his cheek.  "Too

 the axe at the tree with all of his might.

 damage on the tree, but your father continues chopping with demented
 ferocity.

 Just as you are about to give up hope that the tree can be damaged,
 you see sparks of electricity shooting off of it, and smoke starting

 existence, revealing a tall, seamless metal tower inside the spot the
 tree had been.  Your father, unfazed at this transformation from wood
 to metal, starts striking up sparks and horribly denting the side of
 the tower with his axe.

 An alien hurries down the path.  Its gaze is locked on your father,

 As you rush the alien, you can feel that you are stepping over some

 and experience what feels like an eternal moment of fear and rage.
 Your hand comes over your head in slow motion, yet with all of your
 strength behind it.  You can hear your father's axe bite into the
 tower just as the hoe reaches the alien's face.  You hear the metal of
 the tower yielding:  a slow, tortured squeal of anguish.

 The world around you begins to melt away-- the alien, your father, the
 hoe-- they all fade into nothing.  It is only the screaming:  the
 shrill, metallic squealing that accompanies you all the way into
 unconsciousness.

 Your eyes come into focus on a slate-gray sky.  Your arms are firmly

    You've only been to Juniper Hill once before, when you had to go
 sign the paperwork as your father's legal guardian-- your mom couldn't
 be found.  It looks the same as it did then:  serene, quiet, dead.
 Through the closed outer gates you can see the plush, well-tended lawn
 where the less violent inmates are allowed to go.
    You see your bruise here.
    The guards are gripping your arms.

 Through the pain and confusion, your mind relives that instant of
 striking the alien over and over.  Was there really an alien there to
 hit?  If you were hallucinating, isn't it possible that what you saw
 as an alien was just an ordinary person?  The possibilities of what
 you may have done start to sink in. When your dad went on his shooting
 spree in the restaurant ten years ago, was he seeing people, or alien
 faces conjured up by his own fevered imagination?

 Maybe Juniper Hill is where you belong-- you and your father.

 You close the last twenty feet to the gate.  The guard on your right

 clamps down painfully on your left arm.  The scene around you seems to

 all-too-familiar tingling sensation along your scalp, and the world
 comes into focus again.

 The guard continues conferring with the gate-keeper for a moment.

 You can't go that way.

 The gate-keeper pushes a button, and the heavy, wrought-iron fence is
 hydraulically pushed open.  The guard returns to your side and grabs
 your arm again.  They escort you across the plush lawn into the
 freshly whitewashed building.  They force you into a small room where
 they wrestle you into a straight-jacket, and then they take you to a
 classic padded cell, and put you inside.  Any doubts you may have had
 about the reality of your situation are quickly dispelled as you rub
 your face against the rough canvas padding on your walls.  The cell is
 real.

 Real enough, anyway.

 clamps down painfully on your left arm.  The scene around you seems to
 blur; is it just your eyes tearing up from the pain?  You feel an
 all-too-familiar tingling sensation along your scalp, and the world
 comes into focus again.

>pull wire
 You sense that this is probably your only chance to do anything, and
 so you seize on the one possibility that offers you hope.  You reach
 up with your free hand and pull on one of the wires with all of your
 strength.  The pain is incredible.  The guard realizes something is
 wrong when your knees give out from under you.  You can hear them
 frantically shouting something, but the words are lost behind a fine
 red mist of pain.  As the pain pushes you to the limits of your very
 being, you feel a moist ripping and the wire starts to pull free.
 Then, you thankfully lose consciousness.




 You awaken on the ground in the clearing where you saw the ship.  The
 morning is growing bright in the east.  Stiff joints protest your
 weight as you stand up amongst the litter of pictures on the ground.

>get pictures
 Gathering the pictures up off of the ground, you try not to look at
 them, being terrified of what they may show, yet insanely curious as
 to what's on them.  Once you have them piled in your hands, you take a
 deep breath and try to still your nervous heart.

 Clammy fingertips far too distant and removed to be yours reach out
 and start flipping through the pictures.  All of them seem to be
 identical.  All of them capture bare tree branches carefully
 silhouetted against the full moon and the clear, starry sky.  Numb
 fingers slowly flip identical pictures past unseeing eyes.

 Your mind focuses on one part of that scene, and the more you think
 about it, the more clearly you see it-- the gentle face of the moon,
 not only looking down at you, but winking at you conspiratorially, as
 if it knows something that you don't.
