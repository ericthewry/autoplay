           The Meteor, The Stone And A Long Glass Of Sherbet


                    [Please press SPACE to begin.]








 Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of
 the breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia.
 As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their
 breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession
 and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life
 being an Ambassador.

 Watling Street (in the cushioned basket)
 The ancient paved road stretches for miles to the south, turning very
 slowly to the northeast along a mossy stone wall. From up here on your
 elephant's wickerwork basket, you're just level with the branches of
 the old Imperial hunting woods inside the wall.

 Having been stuck in this cushioned basket with the Lady Amilia every
 day for a fortnight, you're just desperate to get away.

 The procession of elephants shuffles on, their enormous soles slapping
 onto the flagstones with a dull, regular boom.

>examine amelia
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a fedora hat (being worn)
   a hand telescope

 "I'm sure I've told you the scandal with the new Lord Chamberlain?..."

>examine amilia
 The terrifying thing about the Lady Amilia, a young woman who would
 grace any court ball, is that even after an entire day like this she
 shows no sign whatever of being bored. Even now she is reading the
 guide book with apparent concentration, though you can't ever remember
 her turning a page.

 "...such a disappointment for all concerned, quite honestly..."

>examine hat
 (Amilia's hat)
 Amilia is wearing a simply fatuous hat, a light summer shade which
 would look quite presentable if it weren't for the waxwork grapes,
 apples, plums, damsons and so on around the brim.

>my hat
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine my hat
 (Amilia's hat)
 Amilia is wearing a simply fatuous hat, a light summer shade which
 would look quite presentable if it weren't for the waxwork grapes,
 apples, plums, damsons and so on around the brim.

 "...which only means one thing..."

>examine fedora
 A broad-brimmed light summer hat, ideal for shading your face from the
 setting sun.

 A silken boy runs up from the rear of the procession, hands you each a
 glass of sherbet and then allows himself to be caught up again before
 boarding the last carriage at the rear of the elephant-train.

>show fedora to amilia
 Lady Amilia is unimpressed.
 Amilia fans herself with the guide book.

>ask amilia about guide book
 What Amilia doesn't know would fill a whole game in itself.

>get book
 Those seem to belong to Lady Amilia.

>throw glass at amilia
 Oh, if only you could. A pity that the resulting incident could plunge
 an entire continent into war, with the mighty Empire crushing your
 tiny Duchy.

>examine boy
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine branches
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine woods
 The walls do seem very secure. Surely a minor local law would have
 been enough to keep the local peasants away?

 But then, by now you're quite sure it isn't just an ordinary hunting
 estate. A pity this will probably be the closest you'll ever be
 allowed to get...

>examine branch
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine elephant
 The magnificent grey beast is wrinkled and has a wise look (but then,
 after an entire day of Amilia's conversation, your average potato
 would have a wise look). His two great ears flap a little up at the
 front sides of the basket, his trunk curls and pokes at the air.

 "Have I told you the rumour about the Empire's best racing donkey?..."

>examine basket
 The basket has the usual complement of cushions, but if there were
 anything among them you'd have bumped into it hours ago.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a glass of sherbet
   a fedora hat (being worn)
   a hand telescope

 "...such a terribly exciting moment for everybody..."

>search cushion
 The basket has the usual complement of cushions, but if there were
 anything among them you'd have bumped into it hours ago.

>look through telescope
 You must say what to look at through the telescope.

 "...just as my Mother always warned me..."

>search amilia
 You find nothing of interest.

 Amilia fans herself with the guide book.

 At a whistle from the soldiers up ahead, the procession comes to an
 ungainly halt.

 Customs Post (in the cushioned basket)
 As the road passes around the corner of the woods and turns east, it
 also passes a customs post. You're ten feet up, and the tasseled
 pennant flag flutters down from the pole to curl around the basket in
 the light breeze.

 The whole procession of elephants and carts is halted, and there is
 much commotion.

>look at amilia through telescope
 Lady Amilia is too close to you to make that worthwhile.

>look at flag through telescope
 The pennant flag is too close to you to make that worthwhile.

 "Have I told you how I couldn't get a single pair of shoes to fit,
 last week?..."

>look at forest through telescope
 You raise the brass telescope expertly to your eye, a dashing gesture
 which never fails to make Amilia clap her hands with pleasure.
 Somehow, though, Amilia also manages to nudge your arm so that you
 can't get a clear look at the woods.

 "Don't fret," says Amilia, "we're only stopping a moment, it's just a
 silly old routine I suppose, I mean they can see we aren't smugglers
 or anything..."

>ask amilia about smugglers
 What Amilia doesn't know would fill a whole game in itself.

>xyzzy
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 The terrifying thing about the Lady Amilia, a young woman who would
 grace any court ball, is that even after an entire day like this she
 shows no sign whatever of being bored. Even now she is reading the
 guide book with apparent concentration, though you can't ever remember
 her turning a page.

 The procession sluggishly resumes, taking some time to accelerate
 again. You dread to imagine what a hill start would be like.

 Watling Street (in the cushioned basket)
 The ancient highway stretches east as far as the eye can see, running
 parallel with the mossy stone wall enclosing the hunting woods to the
 south. The wall appears unbroken. To the north, vast meadowlands sweep
 into a lush, cultivated valley.

 The procession of elephants shuffles on, their enormous soles slapping
 onto the flagstones with a dull, regular boom.

 "...such a dreadful shame, all things considered..."

 (the mossy wall)
 The walls do seem very secure. Surely a minor local law would have
 been enough to keep the local peasants away?

 But then, by now you're quite sure it isn't just an ordinary hunting
 estate. A pity this will probably be the closest you'll ever be
 allowed to get...

>look at wall through telescope
 (the mossy wall through the hand telescope)
 The mossy wall is too close to you to make that worthwhile.

 The procession runs over a small culvert bridge, which presents no
 problem to the elephants. You glance down, and can't help thinking
 something's wrong somewhere.

 "...I expect somebody was sorry, really..."

>look at estate through telescope
 You can't see any such thing.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>ask amilia about wall
 What Amilia doesn't know would fill a whole game in itself.

 Amilia fans herself with the guide book.

 Just for a moment, you catch a flickering glimpse of a bird up in the
 higher branches of the woods.

> x bird
 It's too far away to make out at all clearly, and it keeps moving.

> look at bird through telescope
 You raise the brass telescope expertly to your eye, a dashing gesture
 which never fails to make Amilia clap her hands with pleasure.
 Although you only get one clear glimpse of the bird, its distinctive
 speckled green and blue feathers must make it one of the legendary
 Birds of Paradise.

 "I'm sure I've told you my mother's recipe for rhubarb pudding?..."

>tell amilia about bird
 "Is that so? Heavens!"

 "...such a charming face, that's what I say..."

>ask amilia about bird
 What Amilia doesn't know would fill a whole game in itself.

 You sip at the fine sherbet, careful not to drink it all at once. It
 has been chilled in a wooden cask of ice, and is the best news all
 day.

 Giggling nervously, for she has been waiting for you to take a sip,
 Amilia downs her sherbet with a quick snort (unfortunately literally,
 and she sneezes).

>say eww
 [To address somebody, please type "name, what you want to say". For
 example: "amilia, hello".]

>amilia, eww
 Amilia is baffled, but then she so often is.

>snog amilia
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kiss amilia
 Thank heavens, an Ambassador's duties only go so far.

 "...I expect somebody was sorry, really..."

>nod
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

>yawn
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>sleep
 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

 Amilia fans herself with the guide book.


 Watling Street (in the cushioned basket)
 The ancient highway stretches east as far as the eye can see, running
 parallel with the mossy stone wall enclosing the hunting woods to the
 south. The wall appears unbroken. To the north, vast meadowlands sweep
 into a lush, cultivated valley.

 A bird seems to be darting about in the tree-tops, vaguely following
 the procession.

 The procession of elephants shuffles on, their enormous soles slapping
 onto the flagstones with a dull, regular boom.

>ask amilia about guidebook
 What Amilia doesn't know would fill a whole game in itself.

>ask amilia about guide book
 What Amilia doesn't know would fill a whole game in itself.

 "Surely I can't be the first to tell you about those scandalous
 goings-on at the Royal Farm?..."

>give telescope to amilia
 "Super!"

 She squints into the telescope, but picks the wrong end, and then
 hands it back with a half-puzzled look. "Marvellous invention, what?"

>ask amilia for guide book
 "It's a jolly super guide book!" says Amilia gratuitously, as she
 kindly passes it over. Fortified by years of training in the
 diplomatic service, you thank her.

 "...such a horrid way to spend a Wednesday in the season..."

 It wouldn't be safe to dismount while the procession is under way.

 "...a nod's as good as a wink, after all..."

>amilia, look at bird through telescope
 Amilia thinks she disapproves of that.

>examine guide book
>take guide book
 Enormously detailed with the useless and irrelevant, the Empress gave
 it to you hoping you'd waste time studying it in detail. You have
 vowed never to do so, but it's still handy for passing the odd dull
 moment by looking up some specific local feature.

 You already have that.

>look up bird in book
 The Northland Empire supports a rich and varied avian life.

>look up bird of paradise in book
 The Guide Book has a lovingly detailed section on birds of paradise,
 which there is no time to read now. Apart from the plumage, it seems
 these birds are distinguished by their mating call, a chirrup followed
 by a coo. They live to be twenty years old, always return to their
 first nest in midsummer and steal each others' eggs, but nobody knows
 why.

>chirrup
 Amilia hangs her head half on one side and flutters her eyelids,
 puzzled.

>coo
 Amilia really is bewildered now. But your mating call does seem to
 have done the trick! The bird of paradise flutters down over the wall
 to dance eagerly around your basket.

 Although clearly peeved by the lack of a significant other here, the
 beautifully-plumed bird does (to your immense satisfaction) begin
 pecking away at the wax fruit on the Lady Amilia's hat.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine bird
 You see nothing special about the Bird of Paradise.

>look through telescope at forest
 You raise the brass telescope expertly to your eye. Somehow, though,
 Amilia also manages to nudge your arm so that you can't get a clear
 look at the woods.

 Amilia hisses at the bird, without effect.

>look

 Watling Street (in the cushioned basket)
 The ancient highway stretches east as far as the eye can see, running
 parallel with the mossy stone wall enclosing the hunting woods to the
 south. The wall appears unbroken. To the north, vast meadowlands sweep
 into a lush, cultivated valley.

 The Bird of Paradise is still worrying away at Amilia's hat, so for
 once your tour guide has her eyes off you.

 The procession of elephants shuffles on, their enormous soles slapping
 onto the flagstones with a dull, regular boom.

>get feather
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   The Guide For Travellers To The Lower Northlands and Surrounding
 Provinces
   a glass of sherbet
   a fedora hat (being worn)
   a hand telescope

 Amilia hisses at the bird, without effect.

>examine elephant
 The magnificent grey beast is wrinkled and has a wise look (but then,
 after an entire day of Amilia's conversation, your average potato
 would have a wise look). His two great ears flap a little up at the
 front sides of the basket, his trunk curls and pokes at the air.

>go down
 It wouldn't be safe to dismount while the procession is under way.

 No matter what Amilia tries, the bird continues to hover.

>examine ears
 Which do you mean, the right ear or the left ear?

 You can't see any such thing.

 You can only do that to something animate.

>pull right ear
 Amilia is too preoccupied to notice you doing this, giving the
 elephant's ear a good tug. But he must be half-asleep on his feet,
 after this long trudging day, and he shows no signs yet of waking up
 for you.

>pour sherbet on elephant
 As the icy liquid cascades over the elephant's great head, he bucks
 and jumps, shaking his ears, thoroughly waking up. You have his
 attention now all right.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>pull right ear
 The elephant gives a huge trumpet and begins to charge right, straight
 into the stone wall!  The basket careers along with him, suddenly
 lurches onto his side and is rapidly crushed between an elephant and a
 hard place.

 Hopefully, you and Amilia will be sent to different departments of the
 afterlife.


     *** You have died ***


 In that game you scored 2 out of a possible 30, in 56 turns, the kind
 of score one would expect of an Embassy Clerk.

 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
>undo
 Watling Street
 [Previous turn undone.]

>pull left ear
 The elephant gives a huge trumpet and begins to charge left down into
 the meadowland! The basket is tossed around at high speed as you and
 Amilia are taken for a nerve-wracking ride.

 By the time the bearers have got him under control again, the whole
 procession has slewn out of line and is all over the valley. Casks are
 overturned, cartwheels have rolled loose, axles have broken, the
 animals are restive, and darkness is coming on. The expedition will
 have to stop here for the night.

 Customs House Bedroom
 The finest quarters they could find for a visiting Ambassador, at such
 short notice: and much better than you'd have expected from a
 provincial customs post. Presumably some very rich collector of
 antiquities once slept here... The only exit is to east.

 The room is almost filled with a four-poster bed, caparisoned gaudily
 as a warhorse.

 On the four-poster bed is The Guide For Travellers To The Lower
 Northlands and Surrounding Provinces.

 A jade figurine nestles in an alcove, beneath a painting of
 unparalleled beauty.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>SAVE

 powerful men from the Old Time...

 Upstairs Landing
 Stairs descend to the ground floor, and one doorway leads west, into
 your bedroom.

 The rich brocade curtains of the window here are drawn.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine curtains
 Perhaps you should open the curtains and then see what you can see.

>open curtains
 You open the curtains, and look out on a deserted Watling Street, the

 centre of the woods, is an unearthly green glow.

>examine glow

 Kitchen
 You are in the kitchen of the white-painted Customs House. The table
 here looks as if it hasn't been used for the preparation of food in
 years. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen
 leading upward. There is a fine, modern charcoal-stove and to the
 east, the front door is closed.

 On the kitchen table is a small wickerwork hamper (which is closed).

 A joint of cured ham hangs from a hook in the ceiling.

>get ham
 You just, right up on tiptoe, succeed in dislodging the ham from its
 hook.

>get hamper
 Taken.

>examine stove
 This immaculate black iron stove, just the size of the fireplace, has
 been very well cleaned and has that elusive "never used" look. It is a
 modern, de luxe charcoal stove, embellished with iron hoops and
 designs around the edge. The stove is currently closed.

>open stove
 You open the stove. There is no charcoal inside.

>search stove
 The black-iron stove is empty.

>examine designs
 You can't see any such thing.

 Thoughtfully, someone has provided you with breakfast.

 In the small wickerwork hamper are some provisions - an apple, a hunk

>go west

 Living Room
 You are in a stately and well-aged living room. There is a doorway to
 the east, leading back into the kitchen, a trophy case, and a large
 oriental rug in the center of the room.

 A brass lantern rests on top of the trophy case.

 You are very relieved to see that your Ambassador's trunk is still
 here, just where you left it last night.

 You put the joint of cured ham into the small wickerwork hamper.

>get lantern
 Taken.

>examine trunk
 This little trunk (one foot by one foot by six inches) is an
 immaculate example of Duchy craftsmanship at its finest. The latch
 mechanism is so intricate that only its owner can open it. Turning out
 fine products like this is the very lifeblood of your native land.

 So why do you keep suspecting that somebody has opened and searched
 it? Surely only a wizard could have done so, and the days of the
 wizards are long gone, back even before the foundation of the Old
 Underground Empire! Unless... the rumours are true. Has magic been
 rediscovered here?

 You'd better find out, because in a world of magic no-one's going to
 want mechanisms like this any more.

>get it
 Taken.

>open trunk
 Expertly sliding your fingers along the sequence of hidden catches,
 you trigger the mechanism and the trunk-lid gracefully raises.

 In the Ambassador's trunk are a hand telescope, your formal
 credentials and a coil of light rope.

>examine rope
 You see nothing special about the coil of light rope.

>examine credentials
 "To whom it may concern... granted plenipotentiary powers
 notwithstanding... most excellent and serene Highness..." and so on.
 The froth which covers any diplomat's life.

 Living Room
 You are in a stately and well-aged living room. There is a doorway to
 the east, leading back into the kitchen, a trophy case, and a large
 oriental rug in the center of the room.

>examine trophy case
 According to a plaque, it's a genuine early Empire trophy case, a real
 antique. At that time, it was fashionable to collect precious items
 and display them in one's own home, in just such a case.

>open it
 As you open the old trophy case, which is so stiff it can't have been
 opened in years, something shiny falls out into your hand.

 Kitchen
 You are in the kitchen of the white-painted Customs House. The table
 here looks as if it hasn't been used for the preparation of food in
 years. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen
 leading upward. There is a fine, modern charcoal-stove and to the
 east, the front door is closed.

 There's a hook in the ceiling.

 You can also see your Ambassador's trunk (which is closed) here.

>throw rope at hook
 You throw the rope up. Its two ends are now hanging from the hook.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>tie rope to oven
 You make a secure little knot. It now runs from the black-iron stove
 up and over the hook, from which the loose end dangles.

>pull rope
 Pulling hard on the rope, you have enough leverage to slightly lift
 the stove, and it comes aside towards the centre of the kitchen.

 Behind the stove, it seems, was a much older chimney, an original
 feature of the Customs House.

>enter chimney
 As dazzling as you may be in the conference chamber, down a chimney

>tie rope to me
 You tie the rope around you. One end is tied around you, and the other
 to the black-iron stove.

>enter chimney
 You pull hard on the rope, and the stove budges fractionally, but the
 enormous friction of its flat base on the floor stops you from getting
 anywhere.

>go down
 You abseil down the chimney, securely held by the rope, though you
 have to untie yourself to drop down the last foot or so.

 Cellars
 At the foot of the chimney are low and grimy cellars, built of
 decaying brickwork and seemingly unused for years. There are no
 bottles, or crates, unless they're stored through the passage to the

 Low Junction
 This is a low junction among cavities in the foundation stones of the
 ancient Watling Street, which must run just overhead.

 A north-south passage narrows considerably and descends to the south
 under a long lintel-stone; a side passage, northwest, is much more
 earthy.

 Still not quite yourself, you trip over slightly, banging your head on
 the lintel. Involuntarily you curse out the word "jilnix", a word
 you're almost certain you've never heard before!

 There is a horrid surge of power as you feel your mind creating a
 surge of motion. A dark cloud of bat-like insects clashes with the
 clear air around you, purposeless and malevolent. Only by great effort
 of will can you abolish them.

 One thing seems clear. The Old Magic has returned.

 Passage Under the Wall
 A narrow passage, running north to south under solid sandstone blocks
 which must make up the base of the wall. Further south, the passage

 opening up from below.

 The Old Underground Empire awaits!

 A watchful oil-snake coils and uncoils itself restlessly, occupying
 its territory but making no move towards you as yet.

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

 Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 What divides this cave is a solid, floor-to-ceiling stone wall running
 north to south, masoned with mortar and seemingly recent. You feel
 quite certain that the cave continues.

 A shard of pottery glints slightly in the mud floor.

 Low Crawl
 It looks as if this low passage from the northeast peters out into a

 Shambles
 An earthy rockfall, soaked through with water into wet clay, makes
 this passage lose all coherence. A kind of chimney-like crack leads
 upward, and the crawl eases slightly to the east.

 Roughly underneath the chimney-crack is a mound of garbage, dropped in
 from above. Potato-peel, broken tools and so on seem to make up the
 bulk of it.

>go west

 The moment you reach out to touch the mound, it comes alive with
 woodlice and ants, making you pull your finger back as if stung.
 Whatever the mound's secrets, they're well guarded.

 A moment later, it's as if nothing had happened.

>jilnix heap
 As your brows frown, the air around you gathers with vile winged
 insects, which surge forward to plague the garbage heap. They set
 about the garbage heap with relish, doing battle royal with the native
 woodlice and ants. Only when finally triumphant do they dissipate.

>search heap
 Rummaging through the garbage, you turn up all manner of things: odd
 socks with holes in, iron bedstead-parts, rotting turnips and so on.

 And then you come across a bound volume of parchment (wrapped loosely

 Graceful, almost effeminate handwriting on the note declares that as

 Since magic-imbued paper will not burn, the instructions go on to
 insist that the book must be securely buried.

 Presumably, whoever received this note thought that dropping the book
 into the rubbish dump at one corner of the Imperial hunting woods was
 quite secure enough.

 You edge along the northern wall of the cave, descending the rocky

 Dark Doorway
 Just where the shelf flattens at the foot of rocky steps (climbing

 your feeling of vertigo hardly abates.

 The inverted cedar hangs impossibly from the roof some way to the

 Treehouse
 Inside the wooden lean-to is a surprising illusion of space and
 comfort, which you'd never guess is perched in an upside-down cedar.
 There are no windows, but finely built wooden chairs suggest some kind
 of meeting-place.

 A golden fir-cone rolls about on one of the chairs.

 You can also see two arrows here.

>examine destruction order
 Graceful, almost effeminate handwriting on the note declares that as
 the parchment book is defective (having failed the target of binding
 up to 50 spells), it is to be disposed of.

 Since magic-imbued paper will not burn, the instructions go on to
 insist that the book must be securely buried.

 Presumably, whoever received this note thought that dropping the book
 into the rubbish dump at one corner of the Imperial hunting woods was
 quite secure enough.

 (There is something troublingly familiar about the handwriting,
 perhaps from your briefings last month. But you can't put your finger
 on it.)

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 50 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung

 Dark Doorway
 Just where the shelf flattens at the foot of rocky steps (climbing

 ledge, which begins to curve southeast, is at its broadest here, yet
 your feeling of vertigo hardly abates.

 The inverted cedar hangs impossibly from the roof some way to the

 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 What divides this cave is a solid, floor-to-ceiling stone wall running
 north to south, masoned with mortar and seemingly recent. You feel
 quite certain that the cave continues.

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an

 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 50 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 A black scroll, like a roll of remembrance, is curled around the top
 few feet of scree.

>get scroll
 Just as you're about to pull out the scroll, a tiny but significant
 shift of stones give you pause. The scree fall is on the very edge of
 an avalanche! You'd need to be a lot more than arm's length away to

 You loose off an arrow at the black, memorial scroll, but miss.

 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

>throw boomerang
 You throw the boomerang out into the vast air of the cave, where it
 quickly spins out of sight.

>go north
 That would be straight into the pool. Try walking around it.

>go northeast
 You cross the stream and walk around the pool.

 North Edge of Pool
 The stream's pool washes up almost to your feet, close to the
 forbiddingly craggy and overhung northern wall of the cave, but the
 water does leave room for a broad path around the periphery; and this
 is its northern limb.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously down, its tip suspended some
 20 feet to the south, across the stream.

 A single, graceful green water-lily plumes at the calm surface of the
 pool.

>wait

>wait

>go southwest

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and

 Enclosed Stream
 The cave floor closes off into an enclosed stream-bed here, forcing
 you into a stoop.

 The stream runs much faster here, as the bony hand of the cave-wall
 clenches around it.

>examine hand
 One thing about your home, the Duchy: you may not be a very powerful
 realm, but you certainly are fine inventors and craftsmen. Take this
 ten-inch brass "telescope", for example. Distant objects that you look
 at through the telescope actually seem closer to you!

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 50 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 A black scroll, like a roll of remembrance, is curled around the top
 few feet of scree.

 The cave wall is impenetrable in that direction.

 Furrow and Workings
 The furrow has been burrowed and extended by primitive mine workings,
 hewn chiefly by hand or at best stone tools. But the seam has been
 exhausted, and the striations in the rock scraped clean of ore.

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 50 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 A black scroll, like a roll of remembrance, is curled around the top
 few feet of scree.

>go north

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

>put ladder on cedar
 You hang the ladder so that it runs from the cave floor up to the tip
 of the tree.

>go up

 Branches Near the Cave Floor
 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which
 the trunk will bear your weight.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, hangs down the rest of the way.

>get ladder
 Taken.

>go up

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

>put ladder on ledge
 You hang the ladder so that it runs across the abyss from the cedar's
 broadest branches to the ledge.

>go up

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss down to the cedar branches.

>go east
 You edge along the northern wall of the cave, descending the rocky
 stairs.

 Dark Doorway
 Just where the shelf flattens at the foot of rocky steps (climbing
 westward), a square-cut doorway has been hewn into the north wall. The
 ledge, which begins to curve southeast, is at its broadest here, yet
 your feeling of vertigo hardly abates.

 The inverted cedar hangs impossibly from the roof some way to the
 southwest, 30 feet away.

 A watchful oil-snake coils and uncoils itself restlessly, occupying
 its territory but making no move towards you as yet.

>go east
 You edge southeast along the ledge.

 Long Curved Ledge
 This long parapet thins to nothing further on, appearing to lead
 nowhere after all: the nearest other ledge being 50 feet vertically
 below.

 Approximately 70 feet due west of here are the roof-braced roots of
 the inverted cedar, giving you a magnificent view of this botanic
 marvel.

 There's an iron ring fixed to the wall, the kind used to tie up
 horses, though how anyone could possibly get a horse up here you can't
 imagine.

 Your length of rope is here.

>se
 You can't go that way.

>get rope
 Taken.

>go west
 The ledge runs northwest (if anything, more north than west).

>go northwest

>put ladder on floor
 (the cave floor)
 You hang the ladder so that it runs from the cave floor up to the tip
 of the tree.

>go down

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

>go south

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 50 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 A black scroll, like a roll of remembrance, is curled around the top
 few feet of scree.

>tie rope to scroll
 You make a secure little knot. It is now tied to the black, memorial
 scroll.

>tie rope to me
 You tie the rope around you. One end is tied around you, and the other
 to the black, memorial scroll.

>get scroll
 Just as you're about to pull out the scroll, a tiny but significant
 shift of stones give you pause. The scree fall is on the very edge of
 an avalanche! You'd need to be a lot more than arm's length away to
 survive that.

>go south
 The scree fall would be a desperate scramble down in any direction but
 north.

>go north

 The rope plucks out the scroll as you run north... but you are
 overtaken by a thundering avalanche with the same idea! Your burial is
 almost instant.


     *** You have died ***


 In that game you scored 16 out of a possible 30, in 630 turns, the
 kind of score one would expect of a Diplomat.

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 50 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 A black scroll, like a roll of remembrance, is curled around the top
 few feet of scree.

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

>get ladder
 Taken.

>go south

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 50 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 A black scroll, like a roll of remembrance, is curled around the top
 few feet of scree.

 Your length of rope is here.

>pull rope
 You pull the rope.

>get rope

>tie rope to scroll
 You make a secure little knot. It is now tied to the black, memorial

>pull rope
 Just as you're about to pull out the scroll, a tiny but significant
 shift of stones give you pause. The scree fall is on the very edge of
 an avalanche! You'd need to be a lot more than arm's length away to
 survive that.

>tie rope to me
 You tie the rope around you. One end is tied around you, and the other

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and

 You skitter nervously down the very steep western side of the scree.

 The rope plucks out the scroll... and your sideways leap is only just
 in time to clear the thundering avalanche of masonry which results!

 Furrow and Workings
 The furrow has been burrowed and extended by primitive mine workings,
 hewn chiefly by hand or at best stone tools. But the seam has been
 exhausted, and the striations in the rock scraped clean of ore.

 You can see a black, memorial scroll here.

>take scroll

>memorize azzev
 It seems to be not enough to be able to read a copy of the spell. No,
 the writing has to be part of the fabric of a spell book you have in
 your hands, so that the magic can flow from the binding into your own
 spine.

>put azzev in book
 Which do you mean, Experimental Spell Book #5 or The Guide For
 Travellers To The Lower Northlands and Surrounding Provinces?

>untie rope
 You loose the rope from your waist.

>put azzev in spell book
 Your spell book begins to glow softly. Almost imperceptibly, the
 binding swells and closes over the edge of the black, memorial scroll,
 which straightens and becomes the new azzev spell page. The book's
 brightness fades as the corners settle to perfect right angles.

>take rope
 You already have that.

>memorize azzev
 You commit the azzev spell to memory.

>azzev
 A cloud of green smoke gathers and swirls in the air like cream poured
 into soup, and a vision briefly appears...

 You see the painfully slow carving-out of the seam, by miners
 centuries gone; and the anguish on their faces as the ore runs out,
 never to be found again.

>go south
 The furrow is a dead-end, opening out only to northeast.

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 40 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 The avalanche has cleared away part of the scree, leaving open behind
 it a crudely arched doorway into the southern cave wall. Above the
 doorway, a skull and crossbones has been carved.

>memorize azzev

 A cloud of green smoke gathers and swirls in the air like cream poured

 The scree slope being built, by teams of slaves, under an overseer
 terrified that the doorway would ever be revealed again, but in a
 desperate hurry... constantly glancing over his shoulder at the
 corridor behind him... and the slope being completed, and his final
 act laying the black scroll at its apex, to stand warning down all
 time.

 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

>go north
 That would be straight into the pool. Try walking around it.

>go northeast
 You cross the stream and walk around the pool.

 North Edge of Pool
 The stream's pool washes up almost to your feet, close to the
 forbiddingly craggy and overhung northern wall of the cave, but the
 water does leave room for a broad path around the periphery; and this
 is its northern limb.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously down, its tip suspended some
 20 feet to the south, across the stream.

 A single, graceful green water-lily plumes at the calm surface of the
 pool.

>azzev lily
 The spell backfires, and you somehow feel it wrong to apply it to
 individual objects.

>put ladder on cedar
 You hang the ladder so that it runs from the cave floor up to the tip
 of the tree.

>go up

 Branches Near the Cave Floor
 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which
 the trunk will bear your weight.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, hangs down the rest of the way.

>go up

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

>in

 Treehouse
 Inside the wooden lean-to is a surprising illusion of space and
 comfort, which you'd never guess is perched in an upside-down cedar.
 There are no windows, but finely built wooden chairs suggest some kind
 of meeting-place.

>go up
 The ladder's no longer in place.

>put ladder on ledge
 You hang the ladder so that it runs across the abyss from the cedar's
 broadest branches to the ledge.

>go up

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss down to the cedar branches.

>go west
 The only obvious ways to proceed from here are north or along the
 ledge, either down to the east or into the tight squeeze to the
 southwest.

>go southwest

 Low Crawl
 It looks as if this low passage from the northeast peters out into a
 dead end not far west, but a muddy slide-passage descends to the
 south.

>go south

 Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 What divides this cave is a solid, floor-to-ceiling stone wall running
 north to south, masoned with mortar and seemingly recent. You feel
 quite certain that the cave continues.

>azzev
 A cloud of green smoke gathers and swirls in the air like cream poured
 into soup, and a vision briefly appears...

 The wall being masoned, but quite recently, by Northlands soldiers
 working on the other side.

>go south
 Thanks to the wall, the slide passage is the only way out.

 Shambles
 An earthy rockfall, soaked through with water into wet clay, makes
 this passage lose all coherence. A kind of chimney-like crack leads
 upward, and the crawl eases slightly to the east.

 Roughly underneath the chimney-crack is a mound of garbage, dropped in
 from above. Potato-peel, broken tools and so on seem to make up the
 bulk of it.

>azzev
 A cloud of green smoke gathers and swirls in the air like cream poured

 Seas of garbage rain down through the crack onto the mound, rapidly
 decomposing or washing away so that the process fights itself to a
 standstill.

 You edge along the northern wall of the cave, descending the rocky

 Dark Doorway
 Just where the shelf flattens at the foot of rocky steps (climbing
 westward), a square-cut doorway has been hewn into the north wall. The
 ledge, which begins to curve southeast, is at its broadest here, yet
 your feeling of vertigo hardly abates.

 The inverted cedar hangs impossibly from the roof some way to the
 southwest, 30 feet away.

 A watchful oil-snake coils and uncoils itself restlessly, occupying
 its territory but making no move towards you as yet.

>azzev
 A cloud of green smoke gathers and swirls in the air like cream poured

 Long Curved Ledge
 This long parapet thins to nothing further on, appearing to lead
 nowhere after all: the nearest other ledge being 50 feet vertically

 Approximately 70 feet due west of here are the roof-braced roots of

 marvel.

 There's an iron ring fixed to the wall, the kind used to tie up
 horses, though how anyone could possibly get a horse up here you can't
 imagine.

 The ghostly Adventurer guards the pile of treasure zealously.

>look

 Pale Corridor
 This is a pale corridor filled with a cold, pearly light, ranging from
 near-darkness at the southern end to a bright glow from the east.

 You are in the almost ghostly presence of a gaunt, long-haired man, an
 Adventurer who looks as if he has just stepped out of a weaving of a
 scene from the old Empire.

 You can also see four ancient treasures (a golden fir-cone, a jade
 figurine, a jewelled scarab and a platinum egg) here.

 He has no answers for the modern day.

 You have so far scored 20 out of a possible 30, in 791 turns, the kind

>go south

 Dark Doorway
 Just where the shelf flattens at the foot of rocky steps (climbing
 westward), a square-cut doorway has been hewn into the north wall. The
 ledge, which begins to curve southeast, is at its broadest here, yet
 your feeling of vertigo hardly abates.

 The inverted cedar hangs impossibly from the roof some way to the
 southwest, 30 feet away.

 You can see no way down from here.

>go west

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss down to the cedar branches.

>go down

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss up to the ledge.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which
 the trunk will bear your weight.

 You hang the ladder so that it runs from the cave floor up to the tip
 of the tree.

>go down

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

>go east

 Enclosed Stream
 The cave floor closes off into an enclosed stream-bed here, forcing
 you into a stoop.

 The stream runs much faster here, as the bony hand of the cave-wall
 clenches around it.

>search stream
 You find nothing of interest.

>go northeast
 You cross the stream and walk around the pool.

 North Edge of Pool
 The stream's pool washes up almost to your feet, close to the
 forbiddingly craggy and overhung northern wall of the cave, but the
 water does leave room for a broad path around the periphery; and this
 is its northern limb.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously down, its tip suspended some
 20 feet to the south, across the stream.

 A single, graceful green water-lily plumes at the calm surface of the
 pool.

>go south

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 40 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 The avalanche has cleared away part of the scree, leaving open behind
 it a crudely arched doorway into the southern cave wall. Above the
 doorway, a skull and crossbones has been carved.

>examine doorway
 A closer look at the doorway reveals that its internal faces are
 coated with a runny, nasty-looking paste which drips out of tiny
 pores.

>jilnix doorway
 As your brows frown, the air around you gathers with vile winged
 insects, which surge forward to plague the crudely arched doorway. But
 nothing results from this, and they dissipate again.

 Bubbling Pool
 This is a red-brown earthy bole, a cavity in hardened soil with but a
 single crawl leading out to the southeast. The ground is covered with
 autumn leaves, russet and variegated.

 In the centre is a bubbling pool of spring water, glinting with shades
 and flickers of green phosphoresence.

 Low Junction
 This is a low junction among cavities in the foundation stones of the
 ancient Watling Street, which must run just overhead.

 A north-south passage narrows considerably and descends to the south
 under a long lintel-stone; a side passage, northwest, is much more
 earthy.

>go south
 You duck your head under the lintel-stone.

 Passage Under the Wall
 A narrow passage, running north to south under solid sandstone blocks
 which must make up the base of the wall. Further south, the passage
 runs onto what seems to be a ledge, and you have a sense of space
 opening up from below.

 The Old Underground Empire awaits!

>go south

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss down to the cedar branches.

>go down

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss up to the ledge.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

>get ladder
 Taken.

>go down

 Branches Near the Cave Floor
 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which
 the trunk will bear your weight.

>spells
>put ladder on floor
 The jilnix spell is indelibly etched on your memory. Other than that,
 you have the azzev spell and piroo spell memorised.

 (the cave floor)
 You hang the ladder so that it runs from the cave floor up to the tip
 of the tree.

>go down

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

>go north
 That would be straight into the pool. Try walking around it.

>go northeast
 You cross the stream and walk around the pool.

 North Edge of Pool
 The stream's pool washes up almost to your feet, close to the
 forbiddingly craggy and overhung northern wall of the cave, but the
 water does leave room for a broad path around the periphery; and this
 is its northern limb.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously down, its tip suspended some
 20 feet to the south, across the stream.

 A single, graceful green water-lily plumes at the calm surface of the
 pool.

>throw banana at lily
 The water-lily gulps upward and swallows the banana with a vicious
 snap!

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

 Enclosed Stream
 The cave floor closes off into an enclosed stream-bed here, forcing
 you into a stoop.

 The stream runs much faster here, as the bony hand of the cave-wall
 clenches around it.

 Bubbling Pool
 This is a red-brown earthy bole, a cavity in hardened soil with but a
 single crawl leading out to the southeast. The ground is covered with
 autumn leaves, russet and variegated.

 In the centre is a bubbling pool of spring water, glinting with shades
 and flickers of green phosphoresence.

>se

 Low Junction
 This is a low junction among cavities in the foundation stones of the
 ancient Watling Street, which must run just overhead.

 A north-south passage narrows considerably and descends to the south
 under a long lintel-stone; a side passage, northwest, is much more
 earthy.

>go south
 You duck your head under the lintel-stone.

 Passage Under the Wall
 A narrow passage, running north to south under solid sandstone blocks
 which must make up the base of the wall. Further south, the passage
 runs onto what seems to be a ledge, and you have a sense of space
 opening up from below.

 The Old Underground Empire awaits!

>go south

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss down to the cedar branches.

>go down

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss up to the ledge.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

>get ladder
 Taken.

>go down

 Branches Near the Cave Floor
 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which
 the trunk will bear your weight.

>go down
 The ladder's no longer in place.

>put ladder on floor
 (the cave floor)
 You hang the ladder so that it runs from the cave floor up to the tip
 of the tree.

>go down

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

>go northeast
 You cross the stream and walk around the pool.

 North Edge of Pool
 The stream's pool washes up almost to your feet, close to the
 forbiddingly craggy and overhung northern wall of the cave, but the
 water does leave room for a broad path around the periphery; and this
 is its northern limb.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously down, its tip suspended some
 20 feet to the south, across the stream.

 A single, graceful green water-lily plumes at the calm surface of the
 pool.

>swim
 The water is bone-chillingly cold, and even undressing near it would
 give you goose-pimples.

>go down
 The sheer black rock blocks your way.

>tie rope to ham
 You can't see any such thing.

   a tiny lump of tin ore (providing light)

>go east
 You edge along the northern wall of the cave, descending the rocky
 stairs.

 Dark Doorway
 Just where the shelf flattens at the foot of rocky steps (climbing
 westward), a square-cut doorway has been hewn into the north wall. The
 ledge, which begins to curve southeast, is at its broadest here, yet
 your feeling of vertigo hardly abates.

 The inverted cedar hangs impossibly from the roof some way to the
 southwest, 30 feet away.

>go east
 You edge southeast along the ledge.

 Long Curved Ledge
 This long parapet thins to nothing further on, appearing to lead
 nowhere after all: the nearest other ledge being 50 feet vertically
 below.

 Approximately 70 feet due west of here are the roof-braced roots of
 the inverted cedar, giving you a magnificent view of this botanic
 marvel.

 There's an iron ring fixed to the wall, the kind used to tie up
 horses, though how anyone could possibly get a horse up here you can't
 imagine.

 Your length of rope is here.

 You raise the brass telescope expertly to your eye. The ledge looks

 opening below the southeastern end of the ledge, concealed from above
 by the overhang. But it's a very long way from here, and you can't see

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>tie rope to me
 You tie the rope around you.

>tie rope to ring
 You make a secure little knot. One end is tied around you, and the
 other to the iron ring.

>jump
 You make a wild jump out into the cave, swinging down until the rope
 comes full stretch and catches you with an almost bone-breaking lurch.
 So you're feeling quite dizzy as you swing back under the ledge and,
 by ridiculous good fortune, into a cave mouth halfway up the wall
 (which had been invisible from above).

 Tiny Recess
 An almost inaccessible side-chamber, which leads only a little way
 northeast, giving you the feeling of being suspended in midair halfway
 up the cedar cavern. It would make a splendid eyrie, but thankfully
 there is no sign of eagles.

 Dead End
 Cruelly, the tight cave comes to what every adventurer dreads: a dead
 end, leaving nothing for it but to go back southwest.

 An ingot of silver was, presumably, quite safely stored here up to
 now.

>get silver
 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine it
 The ingot is marked in ancient runes with the word: "TOGNI". No,
 actually: you were looking at it back to front.

>go southwest

 Tiny Recess
 An almost inaccessible side-chamber, which leads only a little way
 northeast, giving you the feeling of being suspended in midair halfway
 up the cedar cavern. It would make a splendid eyrie, but thankfully
 there is no sign of eagles.

 The rope is too far out.

>jump
 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

>fly
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>throw boomerang at rope
 You throw the boomerang out into the vast air of the cave, where it
 quickly spins out of sight.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Suddenly and without warning, the boomerang spins back in from the
 cave and gives you a nasty bruise on the head.

 In the process, it recoils off the rope hanging in mid-air and swings
 that (rather more slowly) toward you. Forgetting about rubbing your
 temple, you grab at the rope and tie it back around your waist for
 safety.

>get boomerang
 Taken.

>jump
 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

>go up
 You jump back out and haul yourself painfully up the rope again.

>go north

 Pale Corridor
 This is a pale corridor filled with a cold, pearly light, ranging from
 near-darkness at the southern end to a bright glow from the east.

 You are in the almost ghostly presence of a gaunt, long-haired man, an
 Adventurer who looks as if he has just stepped out of a weaving of a
 scene from the old Empire.

 You can also see four ancient treasures (a golden fir-cone, a jade
 figurine, a jewelled scarab and a platinum egg) here.

>give silver to ghost
 The Adventurer, having now acquired the whole nearby wealth of
 treasure, spreads his arms around the pile of loot. As he does so, he
 and they vanish like the dawn into the past where, perhaps, they
 belong.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>go east

 Antechamber
 The corridor funnels out into a chamber, turning once again to the
 south. Though smoother, the walls become hung with cobwebs and you
 have a sense of disturbing centuries of quiet.

 An ancient coffer, a chest of precious or personal papers, rests to
 one side.

>score
 You have so far scored 23 out of a possible 30, in 969 turns, the kind
 of score one would expect of an Ambassador Plenipotentiary.

>examine coffer
 You can't see inside, since the coffer is closed.

>open it
 You open the coffer, revealing an old document and a colour chart.

>azzev
 A cloud of green smoke gathers and swirls in the air like cream poured
 into soup, and a vision briefly appears...

 A wily gentleman sighs and makes another disconsolate mark on a
 curious colour-chart.

>examine chart
 This chart, very ancient though it is, gives the impression of being
 work in progress rather than a finished diagram, in that different
 patches seem to have been drawn in at different times. It consists of
 colours and symbols rather than words:







>examine document
 Scratchy handwriting adorns this text, and the writing's in a dialect
 almost unrecognisable today. But, like any diplomat worth his salt,
 you've a way with languages: it writes of a way to tap the
 Philosopher's Stone, a source of Riches by Transmutation, but which is
 only workable fairly near the Stone itself... A sketch diagram
 suggests that the author was familiar with the route back up to the
 Customs House, and may even have lived there.

 You see nothing special about the tiny lump of tin ore.

 Chamber of the Philosopher's Stone
 The serene white illumination comes as a shock to your eyes after
 following dim lamplight for so long, but this chamber is patient while
 you blink; a circular room with smooth walls and concentric steps down
 to a shallow well.

 The Stone itself is resting in the well: an obelisk whose irregular
 facets contrast so sharply with the perfect roundness of the walls
 that it almost seems alive.

 On the Philosopher's Stone is a spotless scroll.

>examine scroll
 The scroll reads "ruther spell (transmute pure chemical elements)".

>get ruther
 Taken.

>put it in spell book
 Your spell book begins to glow softly. Almost imperceptibly, the
 binding swells and closes over the edge of the spotless scroll, which
 straightens and becomes the new ruther spell page. The book's
 brightness fades as the corners settle to perfect right angles.

>azzev
 You haven't got that spell committed to memory. [Type "spells" to see
 what you do remember.]

>memorize azzev. azzev. memorize azzev
 You commit the azzev spell to memory.
 A cloud of green smoke gathers and swirls in the air like cream poured

 A wily gentleman casts a dazzling spell onto an ingot of silver, and
 it becomes gold! He is enriched, but unsurprised.
 You commit the azzev spell to memory.

>examine telescope
 One thing about your home, the Duchy: you may not be a very powerful
 realm, but you certainly are fine inventors and craftsmen. Take this
 ten-inch brass "telescope", for example. Distant objects that you look
 at through the telescope actually seem closer to you!

>ruther diamond
 The magic has no effect, perhaps because the diamond's crystalline
 structure is too strong.

>ruther lantern
 You haven't got that spell committed to memory. [Type "spells" to see
 what you do remember.]

>memorize ruther. ruther lantern
 You commit the ruther spell to memory.
 The spell misfires, perhaps because the brass lantern is not pure but
 a mixture or an alloy.

>get stone
 That's fixed in place.

>look

 Chamber of the Philosopher's Stone
 The serene white illumination comes as a shock to your eyes after
 following dim lamplight for so long, but this chamber is patient while
 you blink; a circular room with smooth walls and concentric steps down
 to a shallow well.

 The Stone itself is resting in the well: an obelisk whose irregular
 facets contrast so sharply with the perfect roundness of the walls
 that it almost seems alive.

>go down
 The Adventurer was guarding the only entrance.

>go north

 Antechamber
 The corridor funnels out into a chamber, turning once again to the
 south. Though smoother, the walls become hung with cobwebs and you
 have a sense of disturbing centuries of quiet.

>go west

 Pale Corridor
 This is a pale corridor filled with a cold, pearly light, ranging from
 near-darkness at the southern end to a bright glow from the east.

>go south

 Dark Doorway
 Just where the shelf flattens at the foot of rocky steps (climbing
 westward), a square-cut doorway has been hewn into the north wall. The
 ledge, which begins to curve southeast, is at its broadest here, yet
 your feeling of vertigo hardly abates.

 The inverted cedar hangs impossibly from the roof some way to the
 southwest, 30 feet away.

>go west

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss down to the cedar branches.

>go down

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss up to the ledge.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

>get ladder
 Taken.

>go down

 Branches Near the Cave Floor
 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which
 the trunk will bear your weight.

>put ladder on floor
 (the cave floor)
 You hang the ladder so that it runs from the cave floor up to the tip
 of the tree.

>go down

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

>go south

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 40 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 The avalanche has cleared away part of the scree, leaving open behind
 it a crudely arched doorway into the southern cave wall. Above the
 doorway, a skull and crossbones has been carved.

>ruther arsenic
 You haven't got that spell committed to memory. [Type "spells" to see

>memorize ruther. ruther arsenic
 You commit the ruther spell to memory.
 Blue magical light crackles over the doorway, abating to leave it...
 greenly glowing.

 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular
 burrow wriggled out of soft earth. Strange tracks have been dragged,
 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

 Egg Chamber
 Hollowed out like a wasp's nest in a rotten apple, this almost-sealed
 den can only be one thing.

 All around you is the desiccated body of the once-magnificent
 creature, curled up, half-hornet, half-prawn. It looks as if it would
 fall to dust if you so much as looked at it.

 A glistening, pulsing egg, rocks back and forth erratically. It seems
 close to hatching! A dull, humid heat radiates out from it, and you
 sense effort and anger.

>examine egg
 You see nothing special about the glistening egg.

>examine corpse

>azzev
 A cloud of green smoke gathers and swirls in the air like cream poured

 A magnificent hornet-creature, in its death-throes, laying one final
 egg.

>consult guide book about hornet
 There are puzzling legends of giant hornet creatures striking fear
 into the population. Modern historians feel that this is merely a
 symbol of deep insecurity.

 As your brows frown, the air around you gathers with vile winged
 insects, which surge forward to plague the glistening egg. They are
 unable to make any inroad into the eggshell.

 Nothing happens, perhaps because the glistening egg was already
 unfastened.

 Jacqueline pushes the egg into a rolling motion, down the long burrow, that is
 really a hatching-tube: it gathers a little speed and rocks ominously
 side-to-side.

 Upward Burrow
 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular
 burrow wriggled out of soft earth. Strange tracks have been dragged,
 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

>push egg n
 As you give the egg a further push down the slope, everything happens
 at once. The egg cracks, a vile viscous glue-like liquid coats it at
 once and your hands are stuck fast!

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

 You're rolling with the egg now, into the waterlily pool. Bruised but
 somehow coping, you splutter in the sudden chill water: the glue is
 washing away, and your possessions are safe enough: not even your hair
 is wet.

 But just as the egg splits entirely, the giant pod of a deep lily
 strikes upward to swallow the flotsam whole, to compress it and digest
 it, safe in the depths in the pool.

 Lily Pod
 Smothered in a suffocating red haze, half-conscious at best, your
 position seems hopeless. The lily's membrane is tough as
 crocodile-skin and beyond it is perhaps a thousand feet of water? The
 pressure seals you in as well as any rockfall could. Indeed, only the
 pressure makes it possible at all for one Ambassador and one giant
 hatched lizard to share a space barely six feet in diameter.

 The creature wriggles, dripping a saliva that burns to the touch, but
 seems lapsed back into embryonic sleep.

 Abruptly the lily-pod bursts. A detached observer would think its
 graceful explosion reminiscent of seeds released onto a spring wind.
 But with the pressure of the water smashing into you like a hammer,
 you are soon detached from all observation, all reminiscence.

 Egg Chamber
 Hollowed out like a wasp's nest in a rotten apple, this almost-sealed
 den can only be one thing.

 A glistening, pulsing egg, rocks back and forth erratically. It seems
 close to hatching! A dull, humid heat radiates out from it, and you
 sense effort and anger.

 Upward Burrow
 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular
 burrow wriggled out of soft earth. Strange tracks have been dragged,
 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go north

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 40 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 The avalanche has cleared away part of the scree, leaving open behind
 it a crudely arched doorway into the southern cave wall. Above the
 doorway, a skull and crossbones has been carved.

>go north

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

>go up

 Branches Near the Cave Floor
 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which
 the trunk will bear your weight.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, hangs down the rest of the way.

>get ladder
 Taken.

>go up

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

>put ladder on ledge
 You hang the ladder so that it runs across the abyss from the cedar's
 broadest branches to the ledge.

>go up

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, spans the abyss down to the cedar branches.

>go west
 The only obvious ways to proceed from here are north or along the
 ledge, either down to the east or into the tight squeeze to the
 southwest.

>go southwest

 Low Crawl
 It looks as if this low passage from the northeast peters out into a
 dead end not far west, but a muddy slide-passage descends to the
 south.

>go south

 Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 What divides this cave is a solid, floor-to-ceiling stone wall running
 north to south, masoned with mortar and seemingly recent. You feel
 quite certain that the cave continues.

 Scratchy handwriting adorns this text, and the writing's in a dialect
 almost unrecognisable today. But, like any diplomat worth his salt,
 you've a way with languages: it writes of a way to tap the
 Philosopher's Stone, a source of Riches by Transmutation, but which is
 only workable fairly near the Stone itself... A sketch diagram
 suggests that the author was familiar with the route back up to the
 Customs House, and may even have lived there.

 somehow coping, you splutter in the sudden chill water: the glue is
 washing away, and your possessions are safe enough: not even your hair
 is wet.

 But just as the egg splits entirely, the giant pod of a deep lily
 strikes upward to swallow the flotsam whole, to compress it and digest
 it, safe in the depths in the pool.

 Lily Pod
 Smothered in a suffocating red haze, half-conscious at best, your
 position seems hopeless. The lily's membrane is tough as
 crocodile-skin and beyond it is perhaps a thousand feet of water? The
 pressure seals you in as well as any rockfall could. Indeed, only the
 pressure makes it possible at all for one Ambassador and one giant
 hatched lizard to share a space barely six feet in diameter.

 The creature wriggles, dripping a saliva that burns to the touch, but
 seems lapsed back into embryonic sleep.

>eat banana
 Delicious! Just as you reach the last morsel, there is another
 blinding flash of light.

 The hornet wriggles in sleep, stirring.

>undo
 Lily Pod
 [Previous turn undone.]

>drop banana
 Dropped.

>piroo lily
 Abruptly the lily-pod bursts. A detached observer would think its
 graceful explosion reminiscent of seeds released onto a spring wind.
 But with the pressure of the water smashing into you like a hammer,
 you are soon detached from all observation, all reminiscence.

>wake hornet
 The hornet sleeps soundly (thank heavens).

 The hatchling wriggles in sleep, talons rustling.

>kick hornet
 Does it not occur to you that you and the hornet are in the same boat,
 or in this case the same submarine?

 The compression tightens.

>examine hornet
 A sleek, beautiful marvel, half-insect, half-reptile. Its gauzy wings
 are only undeveloped stubs and a little amniotic fluid still coats
 them; but its sting, painted like a brimstone butterfly, looks deadly
 already.

 The creature wriggles in sleep, perhaps dreaming.

>examine sting
 The tip slightly exudes some kind of poison.

 The membrane walls exude some kind of digestive fluid.

>inject lily with sting
 That's not a verb I recognise.

   some provisions - a joint of cured ham, a hunk of cheese and a clove
 of garlic

 The pressure is now almost unbearable!

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put ham on stinger
 Putting things on the stinger would achieve nothing.

 With a sudden convulsion of fibres, the lily pod crunches you up
 entirely, with merciful speed.

 Upward Burrow
 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular
 burrow wriggled out of soft earth. Strange tracks have been dragged,
 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

>go up

 Egg Chamber
 Hollowed out like a wasp's nest in a rotten apple, this almost-sealed
 den can only be one thing.

 A glistening, pulsing egg, rocks back and forth erratically. It seems
 close to hatching! A dull, humid heat radiates out from it, and you
 sense effort and anger.

>push egg north
 Jacqueline pushes the egg into a rolling motion, down the long burrow, that is
 really a hatching-tube: it gathers a little speed and rocks ominously
 side-to-side.

 Upward Burrow
 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular
 burrow wriggled out of soft earth. Strange tracks have been dragged,
 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

>push egg north
 As you give the egg a further push down the slope, everything happens
 at once. The egg cracks, a vile viscous glue-like liquid coats it at
 once and your hands are stuck fast!

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

 You're rolling with the egg now, into the waterlily pool. Bruised but
 somehow coping, you splutter in the sudden chill water: the glue is
 washing away, and your possessions are safe enough: not even your hair
 is wet.

 But just as the egg splits entirely, the giant pod of a deep lily
 strikes upward to swallow the flotsam whole, to compress it and digest
 it, safe in the depths in the pool.

 Lily Pod
 Smothered in a suffocating red haze, half-conscious at best, your
 position seems hopeless. The lily's membrane is tough as
 crocodile-skin and beyond it is perhaps a thousand feet of water? The
 pressure seals you in as well as any rockfall could. Indeed, only the
 pressure makes it possible at all for one Ambassador and one giant
 hatched lizard to share a space barely six feet in diameter.

 The creature wriggles, dripping a saliva that burns to the touch, but
 seems lapsed back into embryonic sleep.

>squeeze stinger
 With extreme care you squeeze the hornet's stinger, and poison drips
 out to form a tiny pool in the base of the lily pod. In this
 compressed space you're just able to keep your feet out of it, for the
 time it takes to soak into the membrane walls of the pod.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wait
 Time passes.

 There is a hissing sound from the base of the pod.

 The hatchling wriggles in sleep, stirring.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The pod's stalk seems to have been burnt through by the hornet's
 poison! The whole pod rocks a little in the underwater currents,
 fraying away from the stalk.

>smoke cigarrette
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Suddenly the pod pulls free, and although you can see nothing of the
 waters outside, your best guess is that it's drifting westward and
 rising slightly.

 You begin to feel a certain concern for, of all things, your
 belongings. When the pod collapses, what will the water do to them?

>piroo
 Abruptly the lily-pod bursts. A detached observer would think its
 graceful explosion reminiscent of seeds released onto a spring wind.
 But with the pressure of the water smashing into you like a hammer,
 you are soon detached from all observation, all reminiscence.

 Stony Shallows
 From the natural light, dim and far above, you'd guess this cave was
 distinctly higher up than the cedar-cavern floor. A natural limestone
 cavity, beautiful and thankfully unused, it's a chance to rest and
 think. A single winding path leads vaguely north.

 A burnished lantern lies discarded in the sand.

 Other Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the western half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the stony passage back
 south if you hadn't already known about it). Boxes, bottles and crates
 are stored here, and to judge from scrape-marks are used by whoever
 lives through the broad passage northwest.

 What divides this cave is a solid, floor-to-ceiling stone wall running
 north to south, masoned with mortar and seemingly recent. You feel
 quite certain that the cave continues.

 The stub of a stock-keeper's note lies forgotten beside the stores.

>examine stub

>get note

>examine boxes
 The stores piled up here are heavy and there's quite a supply,
 covering half the wall: enough for a dozen men to last out for weeks.

>memorize piroo
 It seems to be not enough to be able to read a copy of the spell. No,
 the writing has to be part of the fabric of a spell book you have in
 your hands, so that the magic can flow from the binding into your own
 spine.

>search boxes
 You manage to uncover what seems to be a secret doorway in the masoned
 wall. An emergency escape-route, prudently added by whoever is using
 the stores?

 You open the secret door.

 Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 A secret door in the masoned wall allows access to the other half of

 through a right-angle: straight upward through the chimney, to a level

 Clotspinner's Workshop
 The presence everywhere of tools and instruments makes this place
 rather homely to a Duchy-born man like yourself: it's like a smithy,

 An old man you recognise as the great Clotspinner lies on a crude

 narrative painting: you feel a curious urge to disturb nothing.

>examine clotspinner
 One of the few wise men to be widely known across the continent, he is
 Clotspinner, renowned for his optical experiments. They've
 revolutionised the practice of lense-making in the Duchy, but the
 Empress was far less impressed with such footling activities. Nothing
 has been known of him since his "resignation" from the Imperial
 Academy -- until now, that is.

   seven unwritten vellum scrolls (which is unwritten)

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 40 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 The avalanche has cleared away part of the scree, leaving open behind
 it a crudely arched doorway into the southern cave wall. Above the

 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular

 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

>go south

 Egg Chamber
 Hollowed out like a wasp's nest in a rotten apple, this almost-sealed
 den can only be one thing.

 A glistening, pulsing egg, rocks back and forth erratically. It seems
 close to hatching! A dull, humid heat radiates out from it, and you
 sense effort and anger.

>push egg north
 Jacqueline pushes the egg into a rolling motion, down the long burrow, that is
 really a hatching-tube: it gathers a little speed and rocks ominously
 side-to-side.

 Upward Burrow
 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular
 burrow wriggled out of soft earth. Strange tracks have been dragged,
 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

>push egg north
 As you give the egg a further push down the slope, everything happens
 at once. The egg cracks, a vile viscous glue-like liquid coats it at
 once and your hands are stuck fast!

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

 Your length of rope is here.

 You can also see some provisions - a clove of garlic, a hunk of

 handwritten note, a bow, four arrows, a small wickerwork hamper (which
 is empty), a shard of pottery (providing light), your formal
 credentials, a boomerang (providing light), a colour chart, an old
 document and a coffer (which is empty) here.

 You're rolling with the egg now, into the waterlily pool. Bruised but
 somehow coping, you splutter in the sudden chill water: the glue is
 washing away, and your possessions are safe enough: not even your hair
 is wet.

 But just as the egg splits entirely, the giant pod of a deep lily
 strikes upward to swallow the flotsam whole, to compress it and digest
 it, safe in the depths in the pool.

 Lily Pod
 Smothered in a suffocating red haze, half-conscious at best, your
 position seems hopeless. The lily's membrane is tough as
 crocodile-skin and beyond it is perhaps a thousand feet of water? The
 pressure seals you in as well as any rockfall could. Indeed, only the
 pressure makes it possible at all for one Ambassador and one giant
 hatched lizard to share a space barely six feet in diameter.

 The creature wriggles, dripping a saliva that burns to the touch, but
 seems lapsed back into embryonic sleep.

>squeeze stinger
 With extreme care you squeeze the hornet's stinger, and poison drips
 out to form a tiny pool in the base of the lily pod. In this
 compressed space you're just able to keep your feet out of it, for the
 time it takes to soak into the membrane walls of the pod.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wait
 Time passes.

 There is a hissing sound from the base of the pod.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The pod's stalk seems to have been burnt through by the hornet's
 poison! The whole pod rocks a little in the underwater currents,
 fraying away from the stalk.

 The creature wriggles in sleep, talons rustling.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Suddenly the pod pulls free, and although you can see nothing of the
 waters outside, your best guess is that it's drifting westward and
 rising slightly.

 You begin to feel a certain concern for, of all things, your
 belongings. When the pod collapses, what will the water do to them?

 The hatchling wriggles in sleep, stirring.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The pod bumps against an obstacle, checking its westward motion. Now
 it is only rising, rising.

 The hornet wriggles in sleep, perhaps dreaming.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Finally the pod breaks surface and bursts into disparate leaves, no
 longer bound up by the pressure. In confusion you strike out, treading
 water, but after a couple of minutes' panic realise that the water is
 only waist deep here. You wade toward a slight light.

 Stony Shallows
 From the natural light, dim and far above, you'd guess this cave was
 distinctly higher up than the cedar-cavern floor. A natural limestone
 cavity, beautiful and thankfully unused, it's a chance to rest and
 think. A single winding path leads vaguely north.

 A burnished lantern lies discarded in the sand.

 Dead leaves float out on the water, but of the hornet there is no
 trace.

 One broad leaf, though, has washed up beside you.

>get leaf and lantern
 broad green leaf: Taken.
 burnished lantern: Taken.

 Darkness
 It is pitch black. You are in danger of falling into a pit if you move

 Other Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the western half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the stony passage back
 south if you hadn't already known about it). Boxes, bottles and crates
 are stored here, and to judge from scrape-marks are used by whoever
 lives through the broad passage northwest.

 What divides this cave is a solid, floor-to-ceiling stone wall running
 north to south, masoned with mortar and seemingly recent. You feel
 quite certain that the cave continues.

 The stub of a stock-keeper's note lies forgotten beside the stores.

>get note

>examine wall

 Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 A secret door in the masoned wall allows access to the other half of
 the cave, after all.

>go up

 Low Crawl
 It looks as if this low passage from the northeast peters out into a
 dead end not far west, but a muddy slide-passage descends to the
 south.

>go north
 The increasingly earthy rock blocks your way. The only viable routes
 are west, south and northeast.

>go northeast

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

>jump at cedar
 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>jump
 (to the tree, presumably, rather than plunging into the abyss and
 certain death)
 You take a short run-up and leap across, just managing to catch the
 nearest branch! Painfully slowly, you haul yourself in.

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

>go down

 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which

 Clotspinner's Workshop
 The presence everywhere of tools and instruments makes this place
 rather homely to a Duchy-born man like yourself: it's like a smithy,
 but of the colours of light, not the alloys of metal.

 At the workshop's centre is the Anvil, a hard stone mounting and,
 perhaps, the fulcrum of the new Northlands Empire that is to come.

 A swivel mounting runs around the whole western hemicircle of the
 workshop, and can be turned anywhere on the calibrated dial from 1 to
 180 degrees. It now stands at 37.12.

 An old man you recognise as the great Clotspinner lies on a crude
 wooden cot, apparently in a deep sleep or coma.

 Clotspinner's Workshop
 The presence everywhere of tools and instruments makes this place
 rather homely to a Duchy-born man like yourself: it's like a smithy,
 but of the colours of light, not the alloys of metal.

 At the workshop's centre is the Anvil, a hard stone mounting and,
 perhaps, the fulcrum of the new Northlands Empire that is to come.

 A swivel mounting runs around the whole western hemicircle of the
 workshop, and can be turned anywhere on the calibrated dial from 1 to
 180 degrees. It now stands at 37.12.

 An old man you recognise as the great Clotspinner lies on a crude
 wooden cot, apparently in a deep sleep or coma.

 On the floor beneath Clotspinner's outstretched hand are the fragments
 of a broken glass prism, smashed by the fall. It's a tableau like a
 narrative painting: you feel a curious urge to disturb nothing.

 Wheel Cave (West)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. The arc hoops around northeast and southeast.

 Through a curious arched entranceway east is the workshop at the hub
 of the great wheel.

 A clear funnel chimney rises vertically up, like a glass-blower's vent
 or something from a furnace, lined with smooth-curving brick.

 Beneath the chimney is the chalk formation which the meteor has
 become, and into which the beam of magical light dissipates
 harmlessly.

>memorize ruther

 Upward Burrow
 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular
 burrow wriggled out of soft earth. Strange tracks have been dragged,
 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

>go down

 Shattered Temple Rampart
 Heaped up against the southern cave wall like a sloping rampart, and
 rising 40 feet above the stream, the scree fall is made up not of
 fallen stones but of masonry, broken terracotta tiles, wrecked
 alabaster murals and those marbly bits you can't ever remember the
 name of: as if the veil of a temple has been rent in twain. But what
 the catastrophe can have been, and where the building stood, you
 cannot say.

 The avalanche has cleared away part of the scree, leaving open behind
 it a crudely arched doorway into the southern cave wall. Above the

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an

 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

 Egg Chamber
 Hollowed out like a wasp's nest in a rotten apple, this almost-sealed
 den can only be one thing.

 A glistening, pulsing egg, rocks back and forth erratically. It seems
 close to hatching! A dull, humid heat radiates out from it, and you
 sense effort and anger.

>push egg n
 Jacqueline pushes the egg into a rolling motion, down the long burrow, that is
 really a hatching-tube: it gathers a little speed and rocks ominously
 side-to-side.

 Upward Burrow
 An upward slope from the arched doorway to north, this is an irregular
 burrow wriggled out of soft earth. Strange tracks have been dragged,
 making wavy lines which meet at the distant top, where the burrow
 opens out.

>push egg n
 As you give the egg a further push down the slope, everything happens
 at once. The egg cracks, a vile viscous glue-like liquid coats it at
 once and your hands are stuck fast!

 Cave Floor
 An expanse of shingle and boulders sloping haphazardly across an
 irregularly-shaped floor a hundred feet across, only smoothed out at
 its centre by a stream which pools just to the north. A furrow in the
 rocky walls leads southwest, alongside a scree-fall which lies roughly
 south; while the cave narrows into a canyon to the east.

 The cone of the cedar hangs vertiginously over you, its tip perhaps 9
 feet off the floor.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and
 creepers, rests against the tip of the cedar, leading up into its
 branches.

 Your length of rope is here.

 You can also see some provisions - a clove of garlic, a hunk of cheese
 and a joint of cured ham, The Guide For Travellers To The Lower
 Northlands and Surrounding Provinces, your Ambassador's trunk (in
 which is a hand telescope), Experimental Spell Book #5, the
 handwritten note, a bow, four arrows, a drum (which is empty), a small
 wickerwork hamper (which is empty), a shard of pottery (providing
 light), your formal credentials, a gleaming uncut diamond, a boomerang
 (providing light), a colour chart, an old document and a coffer (which
 is empty) here.

 You're rolling with the egg now, into the waterlily pool. Bruised but
 somehow coping, you splutter in the sudden chill water: the glue is
 washing away, and your possessions are safe enough: not even your hair
 is wet.

 But just as the egg splits entirely, the giant pod of a deep lily
 strikes upward to swallow the flotsam whole, to compress it and digest
 it, safe in the depths in the pool.

 Lily Pod
 Smothered in a suffocating red haze, half-conscious at best, your
 position seems hopeless. The lily's membrane is tough as
 crocodile-skin and beyond it is perhaps a thousand feet of water? The
 pressure seals you in as well as any rockfall could. Indeed, only the
 pressure makes it possible at all for one Ambassador and one giant
 hatched lizard to share a space barely six feet in diameter.

 The creature wriggles, dripping a saliva that burns to the touch, but
 seems lapsed back into embryonic sleep.

>squeeze stinger
 With extreme care you squeeze the hornet's stinger, and poison drips
 out to form a tiny pool in the base of the lily pod. In this
 compressed space you're just able to keep your feet out of it, for the
 time it takes to soak into the membrane walls of the pod.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wait
 Time passes.

 There is a hissing sound from the base of the pod.

 The hatchling wriggles in sleep, perhaps dreaming.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The pod's stalk seems to have been burnt through by the hornet's
 poison! The whole pod rocks a little in the underwater currents,
 fraying away from the stalk.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Suddenly the pod pulls free, and although you can see nothing of the
 waters outside, your best guess is that it's drifting westward and
 rising slightly.

 You begin to feel a certain concern for, of all things, your
 belongings. When the pod collapses, what will the water do to them?

>shrug
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>lantern is waterproof
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The pod bumps against an obstacle, checking its westward motion. Now
 it is only rising, rising.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a brass lantern (providing light)

 Finally the pod breaks surface and bursts into disparate leaves, no
 longer bound up by the pressure. In confusion you strike out, treading
 water, but after a couple of minutes' panic realise that the water is
 only waist deep here. You wade toward a slight light.

 Stony Shallows
 From the natural light, dim and far above, you'd guess this cave was
 distinctly higher up than the cedar-cavern floor. A natural limestone
 cavity, beautiful and thankfully unused, it's a chance to rest and
 think. A single winding path leads vaguely north.

 A burnished lantern lies discarded in the sand.

 Dead leaves float out on the water, but of the hornet there is no
 trace.

 One broad leaf, though, has washed up beside you.

>take all
 burnished lantern: Taken.
 dead leaves: You can't get to the pod's detritus from here.
 broad green leaf: Taken.

>turn on lantern
 You light the lantern.

>shake a middle finger at the game

 Other Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the western half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the stony passage back
 south if you hadn't already known about it). Boxes, bottles and crates
 are stored here, and to judge from scrape-marks are used by whoever
 lives through the broad passage northwest.

 What divides this cave is a solid, floor-to-ceiling stone wall running
 north to south, masoned with mortar and seemingly recent. You feel
 quite certain that the cave continues.

 The stub of a stock-keeper's note lies forgotten beside the stores.

 Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 A secret door in the masoned wall allows access to the other half of
 the cave, after all.

>go up

 Low Crawl
 It looks as if this low passage from the northeast peters out into a
 dead end not far west, but a muddy slide-passage descends to the
 south.

>go northeast

 Topmost Ledge
 This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a
 dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge
 broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a
 tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into
 the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here,
 back north under the lintel.

 Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing,
 inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung
 branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here.

>jump
 (to the tree, presumably, rather than plunging into the abyss and
 certain death)
 You take a short run-up and leap across, just managing to catch the
 nearest branch! Painfully slowly, you haul yourself in.

 Top Branches
 You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the
 cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on
 a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you
 can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across.

 A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a
 wooden lean-to on a log platform.

>go down

 The cedar's foliage thins out and this is the lowest point at which
 the trunk will bear your weight.

 An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and

 A brief babble in your ears clarifies and settles to a calm voice, a

 therefore of the whole Diplomatic Service!

 Somehow, without words, a perfect concord is achieved between you. He
 has received your report and is arranging for your escape: agents will
 be waiting at Watling Street to whisk you away. But your detailed
 impressions of what is going on will not be enough. No, you must
 somehow foil this new magic, if possible forever.

 (Only now do you realise how the poor watchmakers and craftsmen of the
 Duchy must feel. This "ploor" spell will make travelling diplomats
 entirely redundant.)

 through a right-angle: straight upward through the chimney, to a level
 path east through the archway.

 Clotspinner's Workshop
 The presence everywhere of tools and instruments makes this place
 rather homely to a Duchy-born man like yourself: it's like a smithy,
 but of the colours of light, not the alloys of metal.

 At the workshop's centre is the Anvil, a hard stone mounting and,
 perhaps, the fulcrum of the new Northlands Empire that is to come. The
 beam of light courses in through the eastern archway to strike the top
 of the Anvil dead-centre.

 A swivel mounting runs around the whole western hemicircle of the
 workshop, and can be turned anywhere on the calibrated dial from 1 to
 180 degrees. It now stands at 37.12.

 An old man you recognise as the great Clotspinner lies on a crude
 wooden cot, apparently in a deep sleep or coma.

 On the floor beneath Clotspinner's outstretched hand are the fragments
 of a broken glass prism, smashed by the fall. It's a tableau like a
 narrative painting: you feel a curious urge to disturb nothing.

 Wheel Cave (West)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. The arc hoops around northeast and southeast.

 Through a curious arched entranceway east is the workshop at the hub
 of the great wheel.

 A clear funnel chimney rises vertically up, like a glass-blower's vent
 or something from a furnace, lined with smooth-curving brick.

 Beneath the chimney is a huge, irregular, metallic lodestone,
 presumably a meteor fallen to earth.

 A thick, viscous green beam of magical light reflects from the meteor
 through a right-angle: straight upward through the chimney, to a level
 path east through the archway.

 The spell misfires: it's far too dangerous to direct at any specific

 The air around the meteor glows as it is transformed, slowly under the

 "My dear Ambassador," purrs a familiar voice. "You are welcome
 indeed."

 Forest Glade
 A break in the dense foliage, caused mainly by the shadow of the
 rockface to the west, bathed by the unnatural light which fires over
 the hillock. Trees are clustered in on all sides and there's no sign
 of the boundary wall.

 Amilia is flanked by impassive guards, and is herself wearing a corset
 or jerkin of finely worked chain-mail, the kind favoured by assassins
 and very expensive courtesans.

 In her hand is an elegant spell book, bound in white kid leather
 (until this evening you had presumed it a diary): her long fingers
 gracefully point at you as she whispers something...

 And you are transmuted into a wolfhound. Your vision goes black and
 white, your hearing is suddenly acute. Of course, you can carry
 nothing. (It's an Ambassador's life, being a dog.)

 Weighing your options, you cock a leg over the nearest tree. Amilia
 giggles. "Can you guess what I do to dogs, you vermin?"

>spells
 As a wolfhound, you have no such ability.

 Amilia disposes of her other business, and scoops you up into her
 arms. It will save a good deal of unpleasantness to skip straight to
 the outcome:


     *** You have died ***


 In that game you scored 27 out of a possible 30, in 1131 turns, the

 Clotspinner's Workshop
 The presence everywhere of tools and instruments makes this place
 rather homely to a Duchy-born man like yourself: it's like a smithy,
 but of the colours of light, not the alloys of metal.

 At the workshop's centre is the Anvil, a hard stone mounting and,
 perhaps, the fulcrum of the new Northlands Empire that is to come.

 A swivel mounting runs around the whole western hemicircle of the
 workshop, and can be turned anywhere on the calibrated dial from 1 to
 180 degrees. It now stands at 75.78.

 An old man you recognise as the great Clotspinner lies on a crude
 wooden cot, apparently in a deep sleep or coma.

 On the floor beneath Clotspinner's outstretched hand are the fragments
 of a broken glass prism, smashed by the fall. It's a tableau like a
 narrative painting: you feel a curious urge to disturb nothing.

 One of the few wise men to be widely known across the continent, he is
 Clotspinner, renowned for his optical experiments. They've
 revolutionised the practice of lense-making in the Duchy, but the
 Empress was far less impressed with such footling activities. Nothing
 has been known of him since his "resignation" from the Imperial
 Academy -- until now, that is.

 Of course, your sense of smell is by far your most acute, and with it
 you feel a whole landscape. To northeast a brook runs to the wall.

>go northeast

 Under the Culvert (as wolfhound)
 The brook runs confidently uphill, gushing up under the culvert, under
 the wall to Watling Street. The pursuit seems to have been thrown off
 for the moment.

>go north

 Watling Street, Again (as wolfhound)
 The meeting-point: where Watling Street crosses the culvert, through
 which the brook still flows.

 Agents of the Duchy, cloaked as all spies should be, huddle beside
 black horses.

>go south

 Under the Culvert (as wolfhound)
 The brook runs confidently uphill, gushing up under the culvert, under
 the wall to Watling Street. The pursuit seems to have been thrown off
 for the moment.

>drink brook
 The water is cold and magical, effervescent. You feel yourself
 changing again, just as you did at the russet pool. Your limbs stretch
 into arms and legs, your ears tuck back within human hair: yes, a man,
 but just a man. No magic left. It seems a fair bargain, almost.

>go up
 The culvert runs north-south under the wall.

>go north

 Watling Street, Again
 The meeting-point: where Watling Street crosses the culvert, through
 which the brook still flows.

 Agents of the Duchy, cloaked as all spies should be, huddle beside
 black horses.

 "Well met, Captain," you call out casually, giving no hint of your
 recent canine persona. They saddle up to smuggle you away from the
 Empire forever: for you'll never be persona grata here again.

 Perhaps the Duchy will flourish, now that the meteor is denied to
 Amilia's Empire. Still, it can only be a matter of time before
 Clotspinner succeeds in mastering the "ruther" spell, and then where
 are you? But then, that's diplomacy: so many missions end in a
 fifty-fifty impasse.

 Clotspinner's Workshop
 The presence everywhere of tools and instruments makes this place
 rather homely to a Duchy-born man like yourself: it's like a smithy,
 but of the colours of light, not the alloys of metal.

 At the workshop's centre is the Anvil, a hard stone mounting and,
 perhaps, the fulcrum of the new Northlands Empire that is to come.

 A swivel mounting runs around the whole western hemicircle of the
 workshop, and can be turned anywhere on the calibrated dial from 1 to
 180 degrees. It now stands at 75.78.

 An old man you recognise as the great Clotspinner lies on a crude
 wooden cot, apparently in a deep sleep or coma.

 On the floor beneath Clotspinner's outstretched hand are the fragments
 of a broken glass prism, smashed by the fall. It's a tableau like a
 narrative painting: you feel a curious urge to disturb nothing.

 of a broken glass prism, smashed by the fall. It's a tableau like a

>go west

 Wheel Cave (West)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. The arc hoops around northeast and southeast.

 Through a curious arched entranceway east is the workshop at the hub
 of the great wheel.

 A clear funnel chimney rises vertically up, like a glass-blower's vent
 or something from a furnace, lined with smooth-curving brick.

 Beneath the chimney is the chalk formation which the meteor has
 become, and into which the beam of magical light dissipates
 harmlessly.

 A smooth, recent tunnel rises up to natural light.

>go northeast

 Wheel Cave (North)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. The arc hoops around southwest and southeast.

 On the northern wall is a wooden rack, of the kind used by bakers to
 cool cakes, or painters to dry watercolours.

>se

 Wheel Cave (East)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. The arc hoops around northwest and southwest.

>go southwest

 Wheel Cave (South)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. Yet no mason of the Duchy could cut so smooth a wall! The
 arc hoops around northeast and northwest, while a broad passage runs
 southeast back to the stores.

>go south
 It may be possible to go that way from further around the wheel.

>examine wall
 Which do you mean, the north wall, the south wall, the east wall, the
 west wall, the northeast wall, the northwest wall, the southeast wall
 or the southwest wall?

>se
 You see nothing special about the southeast wall.

>se

 Other Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the western half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the stony passage back
 south if you hadn't already known about it). Boxes, bottles and crates
 are stored here, and to judge from scrape-marks are used by whoever
 lives through the broad passage northwest.

 A secret door in the masoned wall allows access to the other half of
 the cave, after all.

>examine window
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine quartz
 You can't see any such thing.

 Dropped.

 Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 A secret door in the masoned wall allows access to the other half of
 the cave, after all.

 Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the eastern half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the slide passage back
 north if you hadn't already known about it); chief among them a
 distinctive triangular cavity, 1 foot or so high, and blocked by a
 rough quartz window.

 A secret door in the masoned wall allows access to the other half of
 the cave, after all.

>chiaro arrow
 There is an almost blinding flash as the enchanted arrow takes on a
 glow! Not for a long moment is the light level tolerable.

>go west

 Other Half Cave
 This is only half a cave; the western half, to be exact. It's a dark
 place full of crevices (you would have missed the stony passage back
 south if you hadn't already known about it). Boxes, bottles and crates
 are stored here, and to judge from scrape-marks are used by whoever
 lives through the broad passage northwest.

 A secret door in the masoned wall allows access to the other half of

 Tantalisingly, you can only see darkness within.

>go east
 The quartz window in the east wall is only 1 foot high, in addition to
 being apparently unbreakable.

>shoot cavity
 You loose off the arrow across the cave and, satisfyingly, its arc
 takes it straight into the triangular cavity.
 The interior of the cavity is now lit up! You're still too far away
 here to make out anything, though.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>look in cavity with telescope
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look in the triangular
 cavity.

>look in cavity
 The cavity contains a kind of prehistoric shrine, lined with cave
 paintings. Preeminent among them is an intriguing sequence showing a
 man being roused from a coma, or perhaps even death, with an elixir:
 we see a shaman preparing this healing paste by tearing a broad leaf
 and then grinding it up with an arrow.

>go northwest

 Wheel Cave (South)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. Yet no mason of the Duchy could cut so smooth a wall! The
 arc hoops around northeast and northwest, while a broad passage runs
 southeast back to the stores.

>go northwest

 Wheel Cave (West)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably

 Through a curious arched entranceway east is the workshop at the hub
 of the great wheel.

 A clear funnel chimney rises vertically up, like a glass-blower's vent
 or something from a furnace, lined with smooth-curving brick.

 Beneath the chimney is the chalk formation which the meteor has
 become, and into which the beam of magical light dissipates
 harmlessly.

 A smooth, recent tunnel rises up to natural light.

>go east

 Clotspinner's Workshop
 The presence everywhere of tools and instruments makes this place
 rather homely to a Duchy-born man like yourself: it's like a smithy,
 but of the colours of light, not the alloys of metal.

 At the workshop's centre is the Anvil, a hard stone mounting and,
 perhaps, the fulcrum of the new Northlands Empire that is to come.

 A swivel mounting runs around the whole western hemicircle of the
 workshop, and can be turned anywhere on the calibrated dial from 1 to
 180 degrees. It now stands at 75.78.

 An old man you recognise as the great Clotspinner lies on a crude
 wooden cot, apparently in a deep sleep or coma.

 On the floor beneath Clotspinner's outstretched hand are the fragments
 of a broken glass prism, smashed by the fall. It's a tableau like a
 narrative painting: you feel a curious urge to disturb nothing.

>grind leaf with arrow
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>grind leaf
 (with the Anvil)
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>grind leaf with arrow
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>examine leaf
 You see nothing special about the broad green leaf.

>tear leaf
 You tear the leaf into a pile of smallish fragments.

>grind fragments with arrow
 (the fragments of prism with the arrow)
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>grind leaf with arrow
 Using the arrow-head, you grind the leaf fragments down even further,
 so that their natural moisture is driven out until you are left with a
 dull green paste.

>put paste on clotspinner
 Putting things on Clotspinner would achieve nothing.

>give paste to clotspinner
 The water-lily elixir has an immediate effect on Clotspinner! For a
 moment you think it will burn him out, and that he's too weak to
 withstand it: but then he rises from the cot, coughing and
 spluttering.

 "Well who are you?" he asks. "You needn't think I'm grateful. Can't
 even do myself in, it seems."

 Caught off-balance, you introduce yourself with a stammer, and make a
 passable Court bow. "I suppose you can prove that, young man?"

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>show documents to clotspinner
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a burnished lantern (providing light)
   four unwritten vellum scrolls
   a coffer (which is open but empty)
   an old document
   a colour chart
   a length of light rope
   a boomerang (providing light)
   your formal credentials
   a shard of pottery (providing light)
   a small wickerwork hamper (which is open but empty)
   three arrows
   a drum (which is empty)
   a bow
   the "destruction order"
   Experimental Spell Book #5
   your Ambassador's trunk (which is open)
     a hand telescope
   The Guide For Travellers To The Lower Northlands and Surrounding
 Provinces
   some provisions - a joint of cured ham, a hunk of cheese and a clove
 of garlic
   a stub of a stock-keeper's note

>open case
 You can't see any such thing.

>show credentials to clotspinner
 "Thought so," he mutters. "Damnable headache. Pardon my suspicion and
 all that. Ever since I invented the "morglop spell: pry into darkest
 motives" I've been a little cynical, you know. Shan't be working for
 Amilia any more, that's for certain!"

 He staggers around the workshop, focusing his eyes again and generally
 rejoining the real world.

>show credentials to clotspinner
 "Never mind that! What about my asylum?"

 (You are beginning to think he belongs in one.)

 "I shall want asylum, of course. Political asylum, from the Duchy,
 eh?"

>memorize ploor
 You commit the ploor spell to memory.

 "Of course I'll also need an official appointment."

>ploor
 Nothing happens, perhaps because you have already reported home to the
 Duchy.

 "And a little wooden house by the sea."

>ask clotspinner about morglop
 He is not yet cooperative enough to be willing to answer any
 questions.

 "And I'll need the best laboratories and assistants."

>memorise ploor
 You commit the ploor spell to memory.

 "With profiteroles every teatime, promptly at four."

>ploor
 Nothing happens, perhaps because you have already reported home to the
 Duchy.

 "And I trust there'll be dancing-girls, ten or twelve should suffice
 at a pinch."

>agree
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

 "Oh yes, my needs are simple," Clotspinner presses on.

>clotspinner, yes
 He looks pensive as you shake hands on the deal, wondering no doubt if
 he should have held out for more.

 "Well, first thing to do's to get me out of here. I believe we'll
 require a spell at, umm," (and he scribbles a quick calculation),
 "mental arithmetic always was overrated, always said so, let's see,
 172.88 degrees. Shall you do the honours?

 "But... the light has gone... ah, I see. Weeks I've spent, trying to
 dispose of that meteor, keep Amilia from using it! But just for the
 moment I'd like it back, if it's not too much trouble."

>turn dial to 172.88
 You rotate the mounting to 172.88.

>put scroll on dial
 You put the unwritten vellum scroll on the calibrated swivel mounting.

>go west

 Wheel Cave (West)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. The arc hoops around northeast and southeast.

 Through a curious arched entranceway east is the workshop at the hub
 of the great wheel.

 A clear funnel chimney rises vertically up, like a glass-blower's vent
 or something from a furnace, lined with smooth-curving brick.

 Beneath the chimney is the chalk formation which the meteor has
 become, and into which the beam of magical light dissipates
 harmlessly.

 A smooth, recent tunnel rises up to natural light.

>memorize ruther. ruther chalk
 You commit the ruther spell to memory.
 The air around the chalk glows as it is transformed, slowly under the
 play of the green light, back into the meteor, whose burnished surface
 throws the beam back east through the archway!

>go east

 Clotspinner's Workshop
 The presence everywhere of tools and instruments makes this place
 rather homely to a Duchy-born man like yourself: it's like a smithy,
 but of the colours of light, not the alloys of metal.

 At the workshop's centre is the Anvil, a hard stone mounting and,
 perhaps, the fulcrum of the new Northlands Empire that is to come. The
 beam of light courses in through the eastern archway to strike the top
 of the Anvil dead-centre, where it is refracted by the diamond, right
 across the calibrations on the far wall.

 A swivel mounting runs around the whole western hemicircle of the
 workshop, and can be turned anywhere on the calibrated dial from 1 to
 180 degrees. It now stands at 172.88 and holds a sheet of vellum
 paper.

 On the calibrated swivel mounting is a newly-written scroll.

 Clotspinner wanders the workshop pensively, looking over the
 equipment.

>get scroll
 (the newly-written scroll)
 Taken.

>examine it
 The scroll reads "thrale spell (assist even old or wizened savant)".

>put it in spell book
 Your spell book begins to glow softly. Almost imperceptibly, the
 binding swells and closes over the edge of the newly-written scroll,
 which straightens and becomes the new thrale spell page. The book's
 brightness fades as the corners settle to perfect right angles.

>memorize thrale
 You commit the thrale spell to memory.

>thrale clotspinner
 "Thank you very much," says Clotspinner as he begins to disappear. "I
 shall now be teleported direct to the Duchy. You, I'm afraid, will
 have to make other arran..."

 He's gone.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>score
 You have so far scored 30 out of a possible 30, in 1213 turns, the
 perfect score one would expect of the Head of the Diplomatic Service.

>go west

 Wheel Cave (West)
 A circular corridor-cave, like a cartwheel's rim and unmistakably
 artificial. The arc hoops around northeast and southeast.

 Through a curious arched entranceway east is the workshop at the hub
 of the great wheel.

 A clear funnel chimney rises vertically up, like a glass-blower's vent
 or something from a furnace, lined with smooth-curving brick.

 Beneath the chimney is a huge, irregular, metallic lodestone,
 presumably a meteor fallen to earth.

 A thick, viscous green beam of magical light reflects from the meteor
 through a right-angle: straight upward through the chimney, to a level
 path east through the archway.

 A smooth, recent tunnel rises up to natural light.

>memorize ruther
 You commit the ruther spell to memory.

>ruther meteor
 The air around the meteor glows as it is transformed, slowly under the
 play of the green light, into... a chalk formation, white and
 irregular. The beam now loses itself in the any-angled facets of the
 chalk.

>go up

 Woodland Cave
 A half-cave, half-overhang among the mossy damp rocks of the central
 hillock in the hunting woods. It's a clear night, and a fresh cold
 breeze blows across your face.

 The tunnel runs downward, back into the wheel complex. But escape with
 your life is what matters now!

>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>go north

 "My dear Ambassador," purrs a familiar voice. "You are welcome
 indeed."

 Forest Glade
 A break in the dense foliage, caused mainly by the shadow of the
 rockface to the west, bathed by the unnatural light which fires over
 the hillock. Trees are clustered in on all sides and there's no sign
 of the boundary wall.

 Amilia is flanked by impassive guards, and is herself wearing a corset
 or jerkin of finely worked chain-mail, the kind favoured by assassins
 and very expensive courtesans.

 In her hand is an elegant spell book, bound in white kid leather
 (until this evening you had presumed it a diary): her long fingers
 gracefully point at you as she whispers something...

 And you are transmuted into a wolfhound. Your vision goes black and
 white, your hearing is suddenly acute. Of course, you can carry
 nothing. (It's an Ambassador's life, being a dog.)

 Weighing your options, you cock a leg over the nearest tree. Amilia
 giggles. "Can you guess what I do to dogs, you vermin?"

>go north

 Into the Woods (as wolfhound)
 Running, running through the trackless woods, in search of the wall
 and escape. Everywhere looks like everywhere else.

>smell
 Of course, your sense of smell is by far your most acute, and with it
 you feel a whole landscape. To northeast a brook runs to the wall.

>go northeast

 Under the Culvert (as wolfhound)
 The brook runs confidently uphill, gushing up under the culvert, under
 the wall to Watling Street. The pursuit seems to have been thrown off
 for the moment.

>examine water
 Glossy coat, wet nose: you're a much better-looking dog than you ever
 were a human, really. Perhaps a trifle vainer.

>drink water
>drink water
 The water is cold and magical, effervescent. You feel yourself
 changing again, just as you did at the russet pool. Your limbs stretch
 into arms and legs, your ears tuck back within human hair: yes, a man,
 but just a man. No magic left. It seems a fair bargain, almost.

 It tastes only of rue.

>go up
 The culvert runs north-south under the wall.

>go north

 Watling Street, Again
 The meeting-point: where Watling Street crosses the culvert, through
 which the brook still flows.

 Agents of the Duchy, cloaked as all spies should be, huddle beside
 black horses.

 "Well met, Captain," you call out casually, giving no hint of your
 recent canine persona. They saddle up to smuggle you away from the
 Empire forever: for you'll never be persona grata here again.

 But the Duchy will rise now. Tottering on the foundations laid by the
 Old Underground Empire, the bankrupt remains which are the Northland
 Empire of today will crumble at last. Unchecked, the Enlightenment
 will spread across the continent, and nothing will be as it was.

 Looking back from your horse, you only know that you will miss
 Borealis, its tradition and undoubted glory: ever the Ambassador's
 curse is to love the land he must one day betray and abandon. Still
 and all:


     *** You have won ***
