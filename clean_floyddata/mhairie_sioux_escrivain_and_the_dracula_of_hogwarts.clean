 You were just a regular girl living a regular life in North Dakota
 when a letter arrived that changed your life.  You had been accepted
 as an exchange student to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
 all the way in England!  You packed your bags and left without delay.
 After a plane, a train, and a boat, you now sit in the Great Hall of
 Hogwarts itself.

 <span class="floydstyle header">Mhairie Sioux Escrivain and the Dracula of Hogwarts</span>
 A Harry Potter Fan Fiction by M Grablowsky
 Release 1 / Serial number 160102 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle i">Great Hall of Hogwarts</span> (on the bench)
 The Great Hall is, well, pretty great.  The entire population of the
 school is here to see the Sorting Ceremony.  The headmaster Albus
 Dumbledore is overseeing the ceremony.  You recognize a few students
 -- that must be Harry Potter over with Gryffindor, and at the
 Slytherin table you're sure you can see Draco Malfoy.

 Everyone else has been sorted into their Houses; for some reason,
 you're the last to go.

 You can see a stage (on which is The Sorting Hat) here.

>examine me

 You are Mhairie Sioux Escrivain, from North Dakota.  Your mother is a
 human animagus and your father is a unicorn.  You were raised by your
 mother while your father returned to the wild woods of his home.  They
 both love you very much and your father visits whenever he can.  You
 have deep purple eyes and your hair is a luxurious brunette with
 unicorn highlights of silver and gold.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   your wand
   Shadowcat
   your robes (being worn)

>examine hat

 Hard to believe this crumpled old hat is an artifact of great magic,
 and yet, so it is.

>examine wand

 Your wand is made of rowan wood and is intricately-carved.  Unusually,
 the core of your wand consists of your own half-unicorn hair, which
 makes for a powerful bond.

>examine shadowcat

 Shadowcat is your magical familiar.  She is a rare fairie dragon that
 you have had since birth.  She usually sits on your shoulders, purring
 quietly.

>talk to shadowcat

 You can't think of anything to say on that topic.

>examine dragon

 Shadowcat is your magical familiar.  She is a rare fairie dragon that
 you have had since birth.  She usually sits on your shoulders, purring
 quietly.

>wear hat

 You'll need to be up on the stage yourself for that.

>examine robes

 Your robes were your mother's and are embroidered with threads of
 silver and gold.  In certain lights some people claim that they are
 slightly-transluscent, but that's just the wishful thinking of old
 pervs.

>get on stage

 (getting off the bench)
 You get onto the stage.

 On the stage you can see The Sorting Hat.

>wear hat

 (first taking The Sorting Hat)
 You place The Sorting Hat onto your curled tresses.

 "Ah, you must be the young lady Mhairie Sioux Escrivain," the Hat says
 to you.


>2

 "You are too modest, Miss Escrivain," says the Hat.  "Now then, onto
 the business at hand.  You have some preference for your House, I
 sense."


>3

 "As you say, my dear," says the Hat.  "Of course, I could easily sort
 you into Gryffindor.  But I sense something very unique in you..."

 just Mhairie."

>2

 "There are wizards, and then there are wizards, Miss Escrivain," says
 the Hat.  "But your modesty has made up my mind.  I have made my
 decision", the Hat announces.


>1

 "The House for Mhairie Sioux Escrivain is... Gryffindor!" the Hat
 proclaims.  Everyone cheers!


>2

 Albus Dumbledore reaches over to remove the Hat, as the ceremony is
 now concluded.  "However..." the Hat continues, inexplicably.  "It
 would be more accurate to say that Gryffindor is, how to put it, her
 PRIMARY House."  Murmurs of confusion arise.


>3

 "It would be quite unfair to Mhairie, to say nothing of the other
 Houses, to restrict her to just one House.  Therefore, she is also an
 associate member of every House, as befits her talent and potential."
 The murmurs of confusion give way to cheers, scattered at first, but
 growing in volume until the whole Great Hall shakes.  Dumbledore,
 looking quite stunned, finally removes the Hat.

 You should probably take a seat before things get awkward.

>sit doen

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>sit down

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>sit on bench

 You can't see any such thing.

>get off bench

 You can't see any such thing.

>sit on stage

 But you're already on the stage.

>sit

 What do you want to sit on?

>get off stage

 You get off the stage.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall of Hogwarts</span>
 The Great Hall is, well, pretty great.  The entire population of the
 school is here to see the Sorting Ceremony.  The headmaster Albus
 Dumbledore is overseeing the ceremony.  You recognize a few students
 -- that must be Harry Potter over with Gryffindor, and at the
 Slytherin table you're sure you can see Draco Malfoy.

 Over at the Gryffindor table, you see that Harry has opened up a spot
 beside him for you to sit down.  On the other side of the hall, Draco
 has shoved Goyle right off the bench, hoping you might sit with
 Slytherin.  Between, both Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw have also made
 space for you.

 You can see a stage here.

>sit at table

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine aldus

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine harry

 The scar on his forehead, the glasses, the boyish charm -- surely this
 must be the famous Harry Potter, the Boy who Lives.

>oops albus

 Sorry, that can't be corrected.

>examine albus

 The headmaster of Hogwarts is an ancient, wise, and powerful wizard,
 like Santa Claus crossed with Yoda.

>examine draco

 The mischievous grin,  the shock of blond hair, the leather pants
 beneath his robes -- surely this must be Draco Malfoy, the Boy who
 Sneers.

>sit at slytherin table

 I only understood you as far as wanting to sit at Slytherin.

>sit on harry

 He's not something you can sit down on.

>sit at slytherin

 You take a seat next to Draco at the Slytherin table.  "Decided on
 your REAL House already, have you, Mhairie," he says.  "I'm Draco," as
 if you might not already know that.



 The school year rushes by in a flurry of classes, exams, and studying.
 One moment in particular, however, stands out...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing in the Forbidden Forest</span>
 It is late autumn, and the snow will be coming soon.  Hagrid has led
 your Care of Magical Creatures class out into one of the sunnier
 corners of the Dark Forest.  "Bowtruckles," he says, addressing the
 class, "are tricky wee buggers.  They're made of wood, live in the
 woods, and never leave their own trees.  Go on, have a good look for
 one; while I enjoy a nice pipe."  He begins searching the many pockets
 of his coat.

 of his coat.

>examine hagrid

 An unthinkably-enormous mountain of a man, with hair sprouting from
 all manner of unlikely body parts.

>examine pipe

 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   your wand
   Shadowcat
   your robes (being worn)


 You can't see any such thing.

>cast spell

 You need only wave your wand to weave your magic.

>wave wand

 You can't just run around flinging spells willy-nilly.

>search hagrid

 You find nothing of interest.

>wave wand

 You can't just run around flinging spells willy-nilly.

>examine bowtruckle

 It's like a tiny little person, made out of wood.  They're very
 difficult to see against the bark of the tree, unless you know exactly
 what to look for, which you do.

 "Ah, looks like Miss Escrivain has found one straight off," says
 Hagrid, having noticed that you've found a bowtruckle already.  "Go
 on, then, gather round and have a good look, while I..." he trails off
 mid-sentence.  "Well, shave my head and call me Doris!  There's
 something you don't see every day!"

 Everyone turns to where Hagrid is staring.  From out of the forest, a
 unicorn has walked into the clearing.

 "Now, everyone just stay calm and still-like.  Just seeing a unicorn
 is blessing enough.  Walk up to one and it's likely as not to kick
 your head in."

>get unicorn

 I don't suppose the unicorn would care for that.

>talk to unicorn

 You can't think of anything to say on that topic.

>wave wand

 You can't just run around flinging spells willy-nilly.

>ride unicorn

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>dad, hi

 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.


 I only understood you as far as wanting to walk up.

>touch unicorn

 You reach out and pet the unicorn, feeling its strong yet gentle
 equine musculature beneath your fingers.  This apparently elicits
 gasps from the other students, but you scarcely hear them.  For a
 moment, it is just you and this magnificent beast.

 Then the moment ends.  The unicorn somehow senses this and gallops
 back off whence it came.  The other students approach you, now that
 it's safe.  Harry and Draco shove their way to the front of the pack.

 "Mhairie, that was bloody brilliant!" says Harry, clearly impressed.
 "So listen, I've been meaning to ask you, with the Yule Ball coming
 up..."

 "Out of the way, Potter!" shouts Draco has he shoves Harry out of the
 way.  "Wanna go to the Ball with me, Mhairie?" he asks you.  "Or me?"
 says Harry.

 maybe next time."
 you?"

>3

 Your response leaves them both speechless.  "Well, I suppose, that
 is," manages Harry, finally, "I mean, there's no reason we couldn't
 both take you to the Ball, is there?  I mean, if that's what you want,
 I mean," he finishes.  "I don't mind a bit of competition,", sneers
 Draco.  "It's not who you go with as much as who you end up with,
 right?  See you then," he says.  They both walk off in very different
 directions.



 The weeks, like the snow, flies quickly and heavily, and before you
 know it, it is the night of the Yule Ball...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall Yule Ball</span>
 The Great Hall has been lavishly-decorated for the annual Yule Ball.
 The students mill around in their dress robes.  You grip a small glass
 of bubbly grape juice and enjoy the atmosphere.

>drink juice

 There's nothing suitable to drink here.

 As you look around the Great Hall, someone rudely bumps your elbow.
 You spill your drink all down the front of your dress robes!  You turn
 to see who it was, but they've disappeared into a sea of
 near-identical robes.  Shadowcat is so distraught she flies off into
 the rafters.

>eat juice

 You can't see any such thing.

>call shadowcat

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine robes

 Your dress robes were a gift from your father's family.  They are
 woven from pure unicorn hair and virtually float around your body.
 Even more people claim that they are
 slightly-more-than-slightly-transluscent, but that's just the wishful
 thinking of many old pervs.  A large grape stain down the front of
 your robes unfortunately takes something away from the overall effect.

 As you try to decide how to recover from this faux pas, Albus
 Dumbledore floats up beside you.  "Oh, bollocks, Miss Escrivain.  I
 should strongly suggest you visit the Girls' Bathroom, just to the
 south of us, and clean yourself up.  A quick wave of the wand and
 stains are gone!" he says gravely.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Stubby Hallway</span>
 This short hallway -- more of a foyer, really, or an antechamber -- is
 to the immediate south of the Great Hall.  To the west is the Girls'
 Bathroom, which you're well-acquainted with.  To the east is the Boys'
 Bathroom, of which you know nothing at all, save that it is surely a
 pit of filth and nastiness.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Girls' Bathroom.</span>
 The bathroom is quite homey and welcoming.  Soft candles light the
 room, the air smells faintly of lavender, and the sofas are nice and
 soft.  The exit is to the east.

>wave wand

 That cleaned it right up, just like, well, magic!

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Stubby Hallway</span>
 This short hallway -- more of a foyer, really, or an antechamber -- is

 Bathroom, which you're well-acquainted with.  To the east is the Boys'

 pit of filth and nastiness.

>go east

 You wouldn't dare!

>examine robes

 Your dress robes were a gift from your father's family.  They are
 woven from pure unicorn hair and virtually float around your body.
 Even more people claim that they are
 slightly-more-than-slightly-transluscent, but that's just the wishful
 thinking of many old pervs.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall Yule Ball</span>
 The Great Hall has been lavishly-decorated for the annual Yule Ball.
 But the room is mysteriously and completely deserted -- where is
 everyone?

 Shadowcat flutters down from the rafters and resumes her perch on your
 shoulders.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   Shadowcat
   your dress robes (being worn)
   your wand

 "Everyone marched off to the Quidditch Pitch," Shadowcat tells you
 telepathically.  "They are under the influence of some dark power!
 You must go rescue them."

>go north

 You can't go that way.

 "Time is of the essence," Shadowcat tells you telepathically.


 Shadowcat is your magical familiar.  She is a rare fairie dragon that
 you have had since birth.  She usually sits on your shoulders, purring
 quietly.

 "There is no time to lose," Shadowcat tells you telepathically.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall Yule Ball</span>
 The Great Hall has been lavishly-decorated for the annual Yule Ball.
 But the room is mysteriously and completely deserted -- where is
 everyone?

 "We must make haste," Shadowcat tells you telepathically.

>go south

 You head out to the Quidditch Pitch straight away, and after several
 minutes of walking through the darkness, you arrive.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quidditch Pitch</span>
 The moonlight sparkles off the snow that covers the pitch, and in the
 center of the pitch, a dark figure stands, who sparkles slightly in
 the moonlight too.  In the stands you see the entire population of
 Hogwarts, all standing as motionless as statues.

>go north

 You can't go that way.

 You're pretty good at sneaking around in the dark, but the dark figure
 standing on the Quidditch Pitch is even better at seeing in the dark.
 "Ah-ha, young lady; I thought I might have somehow missed one," he
 says in a dark sultry voice.  "I am DRACULA, King of the Vampires, and
 I have hypnotized everyone here with my vampiric powers of hypnotism,"
 he continues.

>wave wand

 You can't just run around flinging spells willy-nilly.

 "Indeed, even now, I have hypnotized you, without your even knowing
 it," he says, the model of confidence.  "Although... no, I haven't,
 have I.  I can't imagine what power you have to resist me... but I
 intend to find out!"  With that he lunges towards you in a blur and
 bites you on the wrist, and starts sucking your blood!


>3

 You protest vehemently, but Dracula will not be dissuaded by your
 protestations.  He continues to greedily suck down your delicious
 half-unicorn blood.

 Dracula suddenly stops.  He can't be full of your blood already, can
 he?  You don't even feel faint.  He steps away from you, clutching his
 head, and starts to moan which crescendos into a howl.

>examine dracula

 He's a tall, dark, striking figure in a cape.  Under the moonlight,
 his pale skin sparkles faintly.  Even from here, you can see his
 pointed fangs glistening.  This must be none other than Dracula, King
 of the Vampires.

 "NOOOOoooooo..." he howls, for seemingly forever.  Eventually he
 composes himself.  "Your blood, your delicious half-unicorn blood...
 it has made me see the error of my ways!  Oh, the evil I have
 committed..."  He begins to moan again, interminably.  He finally
 spits out, "I must atone for my many sins.  Your friends are free to
 go; you need only kiss them to release them from their paralysis."
 With that, he transmogrifies into a giant bat and flies away into the
 night.



 Well.  It seems you have quite a lot of kissing ahead of you.  Your
 only decision is this: who to start with?



     *** You have defeated the Dracula and saved Hogwarts ***

 So you've spent the last fortnight hitchhiking around rugged bits of
 the Nevada desert, and while it's been fun and all, you'd rather like
 your time machine back now.

 <span class="floydstyle header">Candle flames in windless air</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by Teaspoon
 Release 1 / Serial number 160102 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Diner</span>
 The place seems familiar; you're sure you've visited it a couple of
 hundred years ago in your personal timeline. Tacky Elvis portrait, red
 vinyl seating, chalked menu, the lot. As absurd and retro-nostalgic as
 it is, this is vividly someone's idea of a good time and the idea of
 that is very appealing right now.

 You can see a Confession Dial (it's yours, but you'd rather not think
 about it), and a Waitress here.

>examine dial

 You wouldn't trust anyone else with it. Even Missy. Especially Missy,
 now you know how the blasted thing works.

>examine missy

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine waitress

 She has a friendly enough face and an apparent willingness to listen.
 You've had worse audiences. And besides, she's English.

>examine elvis

 You fear it may be black velvet.

>order fries

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>dial dial

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to waitress

 That's a touch vague. Do you want to ask her about something?

>ask waitress about fries

 There is no reply.

>ask waitress about diner

 "There's really nothing to do around here. You might as well take your
 things and go."

>ask waitress about waitress

 There is no reply.

>examine menu

 The day's specials are listed on it. Banana-bacon sandwiches, avocado
 omelettes, fish sticks with cream sauce and set dressing.

>ask waitress about davros

 There is no reply.

>ask waitress about daleks

 There is no reply.

>ask about sandwich

 You can't see any such thing.

>take dial

 Taken.

 Right. The Confession Dial is a one-way teleport; you'll have to find
 another way out of here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Teleport Room</span>
 Gallifreyan, of course. Even the transparent crystal cylinder in which
 you materialise has a certain heaviness of touch about it. An outre
 array of gear-work is embedded in the walls, behind glass. The room is
 softly lit through an embrasure.

 You can see a dark portal, sand, a skull, controls, a Veil and a Set1
 here.

>ask waitress about clara

>examine set1

 A curious application of Panoptican observation; you yourself are

 As fans of "Doctor Who" will quickly discover, (and to be honest,
 anyone else will probably find this incomprehensible) this game is
 shaped around the 2015 series finale, and more particularly the first
 half, "Heaven Sent". This particular episode's puzzle-box nature
 prompted immediate comparisons to video games; yours truly had been
 doodling around with an Inform version for some time before finally
 registering on Intfiction, finding out about the New Year's Minicomp,
 and hammering out a functional version in a bit of a rush. Apologies
 if the story's still dodgy here and there.

 Still, the code complies (finally!), and I've added a few spins on
 what was broadcast to keep it all fresh...

 The player character is a time traveller
 describing/experiencing/reliving his recent unpleasant imprisonment in
 a rather unique Panopticon. His captors would like him to explain to
 their flying veil monster just who the Hybrid is that's going to be
 responsible for destroying their planet. Your job is to get him out of
 the prison by any means necessary (yes, even though he's already
 escaped). Rescuing his lost companion Clara would be nice if you can
 swing it.

    Why scoring?
 They've been implemented through an awkward but slightly more
 flavourful in-game text dump; just type "imagine" and examine the
 blackboard (questions have been coded as "ask ghost about X", due to
 the inelegance of the programmer), then "concentrate" to get back
 again. Non-fans may wish to start there to get (some of) the horribly
 involved and spoilery backstory, or may prefer to just skip that part
 and go straight to "get CD" for the game proper. It's been tricky
 boiling down years of plotlines into an even-halfway coherent "what
 does the character know at the start of play", to be honest.

 Gallifreyan, of course. Even the transparent crystal cylinder in which
 you materialise has a certain heaviness of touch about it. An outre
 array of gear-work is embedded in the walls, behind glass. The room is
 softly lit through an embrasure.

 You can see a dark portal, sand, a skull, controls, a Veil and a Set1
 here.

>examine portal

 It's half-open. You can just see how the Circular Corridor encloses
 the Teleport Room, even though there's a window showing daylight
 *inside*...how does that even work?

>enter portal

 (first opening the dark portal)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Circular Corridor</span>
 This is the centre tower of a sweeping castle, the location where
 everything links up with everything else. Wide corridors range north,
 south, east and west, crossing a sickening height over a fetid moat.
 You can see through the arrow loops that they're walkways to an outer
 ring.

 You can see a dark portal, a spade and a Set2 here.

 The Veil arrives from the inside.

>examine spade

 A perfectly ordinary garden spade, with traces of fresh soil.

>examine the veil

 Basically, this is a big greoccurredy creature made out of loads of
 flies pretending to be a person in a veil. It would be comical if it
 wasn't also trying to inflict fates worse than death on you.

>examine set2

 A curious application of Panoptican observation; you yourself are
 perpetually being displayed in television monitors for your own
 observation. This one is marked Set2.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Corridor</span>
 You have arbitrarily decided that this corridor is north, because why
 not. A heart-shaped arrow-slit lights your way; you can just glimpse
 the terrifying drop to the moat below.

 You can see a Set3 here.

 The Veil arrives from the south.

>listen

 You hear nothing unexpected.

>go north

 You can't go that way.

>go east

 You can't go that way.

 You can't go that way.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Corridor</span>
 You have arbitrarily decided that this corridor is south, because you
 fancy it. A cross-shaped arrow-slit lights your way; you can just
 glimpse the terrifying drop to the moat below.

 You can see a Set4 here.

 The Veil arrives from the north.

>talk to veil

 Ordinary conversation won't work with this creature; it's confess or
 nothing. You would prefer to avoid that if possible.

>confess

 (to the Veil)
 Right. You're going to have to confess something to it eventually or
 risk its murderous wrath, and the only thing you can think of right
 now is how much you'd rather not die. So you confess that.

 Oddly, this works; the creature floats away temporarily mollified, and
 something new happens. A grinding of gears and cogs fills the air with
 cacophony, and through the windows you can see the whole castle
 rotating itself, shifting into a brand new configuration. More of it
 must be accessible now.

>confess

 (to the Veil)
 You muster your nerves and calmly natter on the Veil about how maybe
 you know one or two things about this Hybrid, and also you're
 petrified of having this scary fly monster stalking you everywhere.
 This persuades the blasted thing to go away and stop bothering you for
 a while, and even causes the castle to rotate again. Fortunately it's
 not bright enough to have realised that your ostensible confession is
 exactly the same as it was last time, although you suspect you won't
 be able to pull off that trick again.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 Plain and very much smacking of a cheap motel.

 You can see a fireplace, a mantel, a painting, a writing desk, a
 stool, an orchid (in which is a petal), a window and a Set7 here.

 The Veil arrives from the north.

>examine fireplace

 It's a fake. One of those electrically powered operations. Just as
 well, you suppose, or you'd doubtless have to bank it yourself.

>get all

 fireplace: Taken.
 painting: Taken.
 writing desk: Taken.
 stool: Taken.
 orchid: Taken.
 window: Taken.
 Set7: Taken.
 petal: Taken.

>examine set7

 A curious application of Panoptican observation; you yourself are
 perpetually being displayed in television monitors for your own
 observation. This one is marked Set7.

>examine desk

 So it's like a raven. Nothing to see here.

>examine painting

 Now that's the rub. It's a painting of Clara.

 Do you remember Clara?
>yes
 Do you remember Clara?

 You remember her now...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ship</span>
 You know this Tardis configuration rather better than the back of your

 interesting right now; you just want to talk to the woman who you
 spent a large chunk of the universe's timespan trying to save.

 You can see Clara here.

 You notice a weird shadow and briefly attempt a calculation as to
 whether the sun here really is different or not before realising it's
 just the Veil taking up all the light again.

>imagine

 Right, you're home.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tardis</span>
 Well, she looks about the same as when you left her. However long ago
 that was.

 You can see a Ghost, a console and a blackboard marked Topics of
 Conversation: Hints and spoilers here.

>examine ghost

 She is entirely devoid of all characteristics.

>unimagine

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine console

 You enjoy boring your companions about how the time rotor links up
 with the space-time element and the conceptual geometer into the knee
 bone, but this is all a mental image anyway.

 Back to reality.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Teleport Room</span>
 Gallifreyan, of course. Even the transparent crystal cylinder in which
 you materialise has a certain heaviness of touch about it. An outre
 array of gear-work is embedded in the walls, behind glass. The room is
 softly lit through an embrasure.

 You can see a dark portal, sand, a skull, controls and a Set1 here.

 Veils are an irritatingly common fashion choice these days.

>examine sand

 You can see the faint outline of a word in the grains - "Bird"; and
 that is all.

>examine controls

 You idly speculate about using it to hack yourself back into the real
 universe, but the thing's only built for one-way use. It would take an
 absurd amount of power to make it function again.

 The Veil arrives from the outside.

>take sand

 It scatters at your touch.

>examine skull

 It has a very curious feel to it, as though someone with a temporal
 hacksaw had carefully sliced off all hint of its past or future and
 left merely an eternally present memento mori. Trying to identify it
 any other way just reminds you that you've been meaning to brush up on
 archeology for several regenerations now.

 Well, that's the rub. While you have no end of interesting confessions
 on a history-spanning array of topics, including leaving knitwear in
 inappropriate archeological digs, playing trumpet for the Beatles, and
 introducing the word "dude" to the English language several centuries
 before being coined, none of the interesting stuff is what your
 captors actually want to hear. The one they want to hear, you can't
 give them, because you don't actually know who the Hybrid is.

 You may have given yourself a neural block on the topic.

 vinyl seating, chalked menu, the lot. As absurd and retro-nostalgic as
 it is, this is vividly someone's idea of a good time and the idea of
 that is very appealing right now.

 You can see a Confession Dial (it's yours, but you'd rather not think

 You are carrying:

 That may have sounded better when you came up with the idea. Anyhow
 when you're wearing them you can sonic electronics.

 It's leaking temporal energy all over the map. You'll have to figure
 out some way of dealing with it.

 A Yamaha SGV Samurai, to be precise. Clara thinks it's the sign of a

 The sky is a brilliant cerulean, and the autumn air is crisp and
 clear—perfect weather for pressing her hard against the irons. You
 lean out over the taff, taking in the bittersweet aromas of the heath.

 Captain Lionetta surveys the boundless green of the moorsea through
 her spyglass. "First Mate Gertie!" she calls from the roof, or what's
 left of it. The trolley took the brunt of a broadside during her last
 encounter with the enemy.

 "Yes sir," you reply, snapping to attention.

 She points trackward to a collection of buildings that appear over the
 horizon. "Innocence Lost, from the looks of it," she says. "We must
 have jumped the wrong split out of the deadlynds."

 Your prisoner perks when he hears the news, and his jaw lifts into a
 devilish rictus. "What a pity! And here I thought I'd be tried and
 executed by sundown."

 The Captain ignores his outburst. "We'd best not charge in so quickly.
 Look alive, Gertie, and slow her down until you're counting ties. I'll
 find us another route home."

 "Aye aye, sir." Your salute is high and proud. You won't let the
 Captain down.

 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Traversing the Moorsea</span>
 You are aboard HMT <span class="floydstyle em">Problem</span>, a dinky-class trolley impressed
 into Her Majesty's service. As First (and only) Mate, you do most
 everything that needs doing, for the Captain rarely abandons her perch
 on the roof. Tasks include firing the harpoon cannon, dropping the
 anchor, and never opening the Captain's treasure box. You also keep
 your handbook tucked into a coat pocket, for when you need a reminder
 of how to perform your duties.

 The captured Admiral, bound in rope, pesters you with whatever thought
 happens to be running through his skull at the moment. His cold,
 empty, unblinking eye sockets glare at you mercilessly—or at nothing
 in particular; it's hard to tell with skeletons.

>examine me

 You joined the Royal Trolley Service at an early age to escape those
 cold night, but you wouldn't have it any other way. There's nothing
 quite like the feel of the wind in your hair, the humsong of the rails
 beneath your feet, and the possibility of adventure at the end of
 every track.

 Unfortunately, your service record has been less than satisfactory,
 and you imagine the phrase "acts without thinking" appears several
 times, circled in red. If not for your ability with the harpoon
 cannon, you worry you'd be inland somewhere, begging for work. Or
 worse.

 Of course, it helps that the Captain has been lenient with you to a
 fault. You owe her a debt of gratitude for keeping you on after you...
 well, after the accidents.

 You've creased the pages with the most helpful passages:

 <span class="floydstyle em">ITEM 23. Vigilance is of the utmost importance for an officer on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">duty. When riding the rails, you should LOOK around to become aware of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">your immediate surroundings and ensure there are no obstacles on the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">track ahead of you. You may also find it useful to EXAMINE specific</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">things for a better understanding of their natures.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">ITEM 141. The harpoon cannon is an effective weapon that requires</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">skill, precision, and a strict adherence to routine. To use, you must</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">first LOAD HARPOON into the cannon and then SHOOT TARGET (where TARGET</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">is whatever thing you are trying to shoot). In a pinch, another object</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">may be used in lieu of a harpoon.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">ITEM 335. In the event the mechanical brakes become damaged or</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">otherwise inoperable, trolleys in Her Majesty's service are required</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to carry an anchor in reserve. You should DROP ANCHOR outside the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">rails to slow the trolley down, or once off the hotline, to force a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">complete stop.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">ITEM 612. The moorsea is full of dangers, but none moreso than</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">idleness. There will be times you have little to do other than WAIT,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">especially when awaiting an order from a senior officer. It remains</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">paramount that you always carry yourself with the poise and demeaner</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">expected of an officer of the Empire.</span>

 anchor, and the Captain's treasure box.

 The captured Admiral, bound in rope, pesters you with whatever thought

 Your handbook has all the commands you'll need to carry out your
 duties.

 You might read your handbook for a list of acceptable commands aboard

>drop anchor

 You drag the anchor to the stern and push it overboard, though without
 a tether securing it to the trolley, it's quickly left behind.

 "We're nearly grinding to sparks. Where's that anchor?" the Captain
 asks. She's having a difficult time holding her map open in the wind.

 You point a nervous finger backward. The Captain looks round to the
 lost anchor, and her mouth falls open in disbelief. "By the Queen's
 mercy!" she cries, throwing her arms in the air. Suddenly, a burst of
 wind absconds with the map, and both you and the Captain watch
 helplessly as that, too, vanishes behind you.

 The Admiral roars with glee. "Now I see why they named this the
 <span class="floydstyle em">Problem</span>!"

 You let out a noise that sums up your feelings of embarrassment and
 defeat, loud enough for the Captain to hear.

 "A mistake, yes, and not your first, but hardly treason," she assures
 you, "and we did use our only rope to apprehend the prisoner. Alas,
 there isn't much more we can do but wait and see where fate will
 deliver us."

>die of shame

 Your curiosity overwhelms your sense of duty. Once you're sure the
 Captain isn't looking, you open the lid ever so slightly and peer
 inside.

 On a piece of black velvet rests a single medallion—or you should
 say,
 half of one. It appears to be the left half of a silver Jolly Roger.

 Having seen enough, you quietly close the lid. What's so special about
 a broken charm? Your transgression has raised more questions than it
 answered.

 Of your various prior positions, you spent the longest as a
 harpoonswain aboard the <span class="floydstyle em">Quandary</span>. So long, in fact, and
 acquiring so much practice, you earned yourself the nickname 'Gertie
 the Mark' for always hitting a target in range. Perhaps if you had
 still been there, had they not let you go after that mixup with the
 soup and the chamber pot, your skill might have saved them from being
 wrecked by pirates. It's a nice thought, anyway.

 This one's a standard issue harpoon cannon. It's currently empty.
 Conveniently, a harpoon rests on the deck beside it.

>examine admiral

 He hasn't aged well, even for a skeleton. Cottonous mould grows in his
 joints and crevices, and his coat is a patchwork of filthy shreds and
 tatters. You'd sooner mistake him for a common beggar-thief than for
 the feared Admiral of the enemy fleet.

 The Captain ambushed him during your most recent border skirmish with
 the enemy. After a lengthy battle, it was decided you'd ride the rails
 ahead of the wounded fleet and deliver him to the Queen, where he'll
 inevitably stand trial for his crimes.

>get admiral

 You've already taken him prisoner.

>free admiral

>examine captain

 Captain Lionetta strikes an imposing figure in her scarlet coat, her
 hair neatly tucked beneath her three-point hat. A single gold stripe
 is displayed prominently on her collar, a symbol of her rank. You
 think returning with the enemy's Admiral in chains may well earn her
 another one.

 Bold, ambitious, and charismatic, she inspires you to be the best
 railor you can be.

>glossary

 <span class="floydstyle em">CROSS: The places where two tracks meet, or cross.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">DEADLYNDS: An area of the moorsea devoid of life. Not even the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">heath grows there. It's rumoured the rebellion against the Empire is</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">hiding their base of operations in the deadlynds.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">HOTLINE: Any track containing a HOTWIRE, or the wire that provides</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the energy for locomotion (it's not yet understood how this works).</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">The hotwire is named for how it burns hot to the touch. The other type</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of track is a DOCKING TRACK, in which the hotwire has been snipped to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">allow the trolley to come to a stop.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">IRONS: Another name for the rails. The phrase PRESSING HER HARD</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">AGAINST THE IRONS is an expression meaning to ride the trolley at a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">maximum speed. Those who maintain the tracks are called</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">IRONSWORKERS.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">JOLLY ROGER: A symbol used by pirates for mysterious ends. It's</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">usually depicted as a skull over a pair of crossed bones.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">MOORSEA: A great expanse of moors. It's thought to stretch</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">thousands upon thousands of miles, though none have explored beyond</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the deadlynds. Only a complicated network of tracks left by an unknown</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">civilization enables travel, as the moors are covered by a toxic plant</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">called the HEATH.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">RAILOR: A member of a trolley's crew.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">SPLIT: A type of cross where it's possible to change tracks. To</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">JUMP THE SPLIT means to change tracks, while to RUN THE SPLIT means to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">continue without changing.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">SWITCH: A device that allows the trolley to change tracks at a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">split. The expression FLY THE SWITCH means to push the switch while</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the trolley is still in motion, typically with the aid of a long pole.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">This technique will not work if the trolley is travelling at too fast</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">a speed.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">TAFF: The railing along the front of the trolley, over the bow.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Many trolleys carry a harpoon cannon, which is usually secured to the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">taff.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">TIES: Planks of wood that lie perpendicular to the rails and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">secure them in place. Because of their uniform spacing, the term has</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">become a standard unit of distance. The term can also be used to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">measure speed when counting the number of ties the trolley passes per</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">second. The phrase COUNTING TIES refers to the fact that when</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">travelling slow enough, one can easily count the ties appearing behind</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the trolley.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">TRACKWARD: The direction the trolley is moving. Its opposite is</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">BACKWARD.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">TROLLEY: A single mechanical carriage used to travel the rails.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Long ago, people rode multiple carriages joined together called</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">trains, but they proved unwieldy in battle, difficult to defend</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">against pirates, and subject to frequent wrecks due to the large</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">number of crosses. Trolleys are easily repaired or replaced, and only</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">require crews of two to ten railors.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Suddenly, a Ditch</span>
 It isn't long before the Captain calls down to you again. "First Mate
 Gertie! The track is incomplete, and the line is bearing us into a
 ditch! What's our speed?"

 You race to the rear of the deck and lean over the stern. The ties are
 coming too quickly to count, so you estimate as best you can. "Ten,
 maybe fifteen, sir."

 "Bloody hell," the Captain swears, and you tense. You can count on a
 butcher's hand the number of times you've heard her resort to such
 language. Death looms ahead.

 "We can't fly the switch at this speed," she continues. "To arms,
 Gertie, and wait for my signal! You'll have to harpoon the switch when
 it's in range, but before we run the split." You take up your post by
 the cannon.

 The Admiral rattles his bones aggressively in an attempt to draw your
 attention. It works. "What a beautiful day for a trolleywreck," he
 says with that same irritating sneer.

 "Three hundred ties and closing!" the Captain shouts, her gaze fixed
 firmly trackward. You focus on the task in front of you.

>load cannon

 You grab the harpoon and slide it into the cannon. The switch is in
 your sights, but you know you should wait until the Captain gives the
 order to fire.

 "Two hundred ties!"

>wait

 The wind collects in your coat.

 "One hundred ties!"

 You hold your breath. Just a little further.

>wait

 "Now, Gertie! Shoot the switch!"

>shoot switch

 You squeeze the trigger, and the harpoon finds its mark. The timing
 couldn't be closer; you feel the rails sliding to their new positions
 beneath your feet just as the <span class="floydstyle em">Problem</span> reaches the split. She
 bucks and swivels over to the new line, maintaining her speed while
 settling into her new course.

 "Great shot!" the Captain cheers, dropping to the deck. You beam with
 pride, but it's to be short-lived. She goes on to explain that without
 a rope tied to the harpoon, you've lost yet another valuable piece of
 equipment.

 "Don't fret, my dears," the Admiral interrupts. "I happen to have some
 very sturdy rope on me. All you have to do is untie me, and it's
 yours."

 The Captain raises a fist. "I'd sooner use your bones for harpoons."
 Her threat silences him for at least a full minute, maybe two.
 Her threat silences him for at least a full minute, maybe two.## The
 Fool On the Approach
 By mid-afternoon, you reach the outskirts of Innocence Lost. Here the
 buildings are little more than ragged tarps stretched over the husks
 of trolleys and other scavenged materials. The roof of one dwelling,
 an ancient caboose, makes use of an old flag to patch a hole, its bold
 red hue long since faded to a dirty shade of terra cotta. You're
 reminded of a blanket your mother had made to keep you warm at night.
 Back then, the Empire's flags were always in abundance, and few seemed
 to mind the ones that went missing. Now, no one dares remove a single
 flag, not since the guard began removing hands.

 The Captain's voice distracts you from your thoughts. "First Mate
 Gertie, there's a fool on the approach!" Sure enough, you see a man
 dancing on the track, cradling his bottle of spirits like it's his
 partner in a very sloppy waltz. Ordinarily you'd ring a standard
 warning, but the trolley's bell went the way of her roof.

 Something near him catches the sunlight—a switch! "Look Captain!" you
 shout excitedly. Then you remember the harpoon. "We could at least try
 to fly the switch."

 The Captain shakes her head. "I have a better idea. Load the Admiral's
 bones into the cannon. We'll save this fool's life if we can."

 "You must be joking," the skeleton says, his tone no longer so
 abrasive. "The drunkard earned his fate the moment he drank himself
 dim."

 "As did you earn your fate," the Captain replies, "when you raised a
 banner against the Empire." She turns back to you. "We're three
 hundred ties away and closing fast. There's no time to argue. Load a
 bone, and prepare to fire."

 The skeleton's grin gives way to genuine worry. Your instructions are
 clear, yet you find yourself hesitating.

>get bone

 Which do you mean, the left arm, the right arm, the left leg, the
 right leg or the spine?

>load left spine

 You can't see any such thing.

>load spine

 The spine seems rather important, relative to the arms and legs. You
 think it best to use an appendage instead.

 "Two hundred ties!"

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Fool On the Approach</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>load left arm

 "I'm sorry," you mouth to the Admiral, even as you hold him still. It
 takes a fair amount of pulling and twisting to snap the left arm out
 of its socket. You work equally hard just to keep your eyes open and
 the bile out of your throat. All the while, the Admiral howls in rage
 or pain, or both.

 Once the deed is done, you slide the string of bones into the cannon.

 "Two hundred ties!"

>wait

 The wind whips your hair about your face.

 "One hundred ties!"

>wait

 "Now!" cries the Captain.

>shoot switch

 The Admiral's left arm isn't quite a harpoon, but it does the job. The
 <span class="floydstyle em">Problem</span> jumps the split without incident, startling the
 drunken man from his revelry. He waves his hat in greeting as you
 pass.

 "Gertie the Mark earns her name again! Well done." The Captain offers
 you a congratulatory slap on the back. Somehow, you manage a smile.
>examine me
 you a congratulatory slap on the back. Somehow, you manage a smile.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ironsworkers, Trackward</span>
 Within the dense heart of Innocence Lost, the buildings climb atop
 each other like too many rats in too small a box. Numerous lines
 converge, cross, split, or run concurrently in a tangled mess of rails
 and switches. Fortunately, most of the tracks appear to run straight
 through town.

 The townspeople go about their business along the rails, slipping in
 and out of the tight spaces between buildings and stepping aside with
 disinterested expressions to let the <span class="floydstyle em">Problem</span> clatter by. Some
 shout insults against the Empire, and one particularly unruly skeleton
 throws a brick that grazes the Captain's hat. It's odd to see such a
 blatant display of treason, but you suppose that's what happens when
 the guard isn't around to keep the peace.

 You continue past the docking tracks. "Captain, might we dock and find
 a new anchor?" you ask, but the Captain shakes her head.

 "Without an anchor, there won't be enough track off the hotline to
 come to a stop. Safely, that is. Besides, the scum of this town have
 no love for the Empire. It would be dangerous for the two of us to
 remain here with the prisoner." She spits off the side of the deck,
 then bolts upright when something trackward catches her attention—a
 group of workers repairing the line, seemingly unaware of your
 approach.

 "Quickly Gertie, load another bone in the cannon. We can save the
 lives of these men and women." She climbs to her perch and pulls open
 her spyglass. "Only three hundred ties until the split, starboard."

 The Admiral struggles against his bindings. "Leave my bones out of
 this! Ironsworkers know the dangers of maintaining the rails. If they
 die, it's their own damn fault for not appointing a lookout."

 You can't help but feel there's a logic in what he's saying. Or maybe
 you're looking for a reason to disobey orders.

>get right arm

 You pry the right arm in such a way that the joint pops neatly out of
 its socket. It's certainly easier the second time around.

 The Admiral curses you and the Empire even after the cannon is loaded,
 but you've already numbed yourself to his voice. Numbness is the only
 way you'll keep going.

 "Two hundred ties!"

>load arm

 It's already loaded.

 "One hundred ties!"

>wait

 "Now!"

>shoot switch

 The arm finds the switch, and the rails change. You can see the
 workers' fear turn to relief as the trolley jumps the split to the
 switch track beside them.

 The Admiral is less than amused. "Oh, good shot and all that! For the
 good of the Empire, eternal servitude to the crown, blah, blah, blah,"
 he says, his words drenched with venom. "You're all the same, breaking
 the world apart in the name of duty. You and that rotten, swine-faced
 witch for a queen."

 The Captain leaps down and backhands the skeleton so hard his head
 near spins round. "If you say one word more word against Her Majesty,
 I'll grind your skull against the irons myself."

 Under normal circumstances, you'd be appropriately horrified by his
 invective, but you're distracted by the sickly-white mould you
 discover coating your hands. Strangely, no amount of rubbing will get
 it off.
 it off.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Pigmonger Sells To a Crowd</span>
 Rounding a bend, the trolley happens upon several docking tracks
 occupied by travelling fences, their railcarts full of ration tins and
 fire-starters and brass buttons plucked from the uniforms of the dead.
 Fences are inevitable wherever people can't afford the Royal Tariffs,
 and while the stuff of real value goes to the cities, a farthing or
 two might be made in towns like these along the way. You note a great
 many items of standard military issue in their piles. The pirates must
 be growing bolder, or desperate.

 A crowd is gathered around a pigmonger, his latest cuts splayed on
 racks and rusted hooks. The frenzied shoppers, jostling each other for
 a better position, have him surrounded. Many stand directly on the
 track.

 "Three hundred ties!" the Captain shouts. You already know what must
 be done.

 Another switch, another duty. For the Empire.

>get leg

 Which do you mean, the left leg or the right leg?

>load left leg

 The Admiral protests now more than ever, but you won't relent, you
 can't relent. You sever the limb cleanly and force the bones into the
 cannon. "Look, on the switch track!" he wails between sobs. "Your
 choice brings death either way."

 You glance past the switch, and what you thought were some piles of
 bones are indeed skeletons, maybe three or four, huddled together,
 naked, and staring at the pigmonger's wares.

 "Captain, we'll hit those skeletons if we jump! Captain?" But she
 doesn't reply, nor does she flinch.

 "Two hundred ties!"

>shoot switch

 You steady your aim and fire, but the left leg lands short of its
 mark.

 The trolley runs the split, and you plow into the crowd. One or two
 dive aside and save their own lives, a few others lose a limb, but the
 rest are devoured by hungry wheels.

 Blood spatters everywhere, but your vision swims white. You grow sick
 inside. Why is this happening? What did you do to deserve this
 nightmare? You try, and try, but the whiteness won't come off. You
 look over to the Admiral who has lost his fire. Dust peters out of his
 eyeless darkness.

 After playing Greg Hassett's 1978 adventure game King Tut's Tomb and
 making a map in Trizbort, I cut out half the rooms and used the
 "generate source" feature. I then used random generators to clip
 excerpts from the Internet for object descriptions and room
 description.

 The poetry that comes from using objects is a mix of random word
 generators and hand-made lines by myself, but it may be difficult to
 tell the difference.

 The only way to end is to QUIT.

 This desk is an imposing secondhand thing. It predates your arrival,

 Lady Grémillet was the inheritor to one of the biggest pharmaceutical

 But apart from her stature, it was her impossibly proud air that

>examine basements

 The Grémillet mansion was famous for having a facade made largely out
 of glass. What people didn't see was that there was glass just about
 everywhere in the house on Sentosa Cove. Of course, the house wasn't
 entirely made of glass - that would have been impractical - but almost
 every structure had veins of glass running through it, most often
 bottle-green glass, but also clear glass and frosted.

 This extended to the basements, too, which held such essentials as the
 laundry room, the greenhouse and... and the illegal labs where GD
 Pharmaceuticals did more unorthodox research. It was almost out of a
 movie.

 Now that you think about the glass, though: when you took the job, you
 were given <span class="floydstyle i">lodgings</span> in the house, with veins of yellow glass in
 the walls. It was like something out of Downton Abbey, so you, too,
 got to see the fantastical place, the seed of so many <span class="floydstyle i">rumours</span>.

 Luxury. Sheer luxury. Private washroom, towels changed daily, with
 bubble bath and shampoo of your choice constantly kept in stock; bed
 soft as a good dream; something like acres of space. It was
 ridiculously big, much bigger than it needed to be, and after spending
 years living in rooms with other people, it was unspeakably good to
 have your own room.

 Okay, fine, you sometimes had to contend with one of the staff
 appearing in your room silently, but on the whole it was great. Snacks
 whenever you wanted, too.

 That's all gone, now. But it's a small comfort that there won't be any
 of that in the future. Not from the Grémillets, anyway.

 You hear the clanking of dishes.

 These were bits written on slips of paper, the backs of envelopes
 (including one from the medical council), even, in one case, the back

 rotation of the axis every twelve years..."

 You hear people shouting downstairs.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Washroom</span>
 The most important room in a house. This washroom is almost
 exclusively for your own use, which is an amazing luxury, to be
 honest. There are the usual amenities here: a toilet, a sink, some
 toilet paper. Also, some graffiti on the walls. The washroom doesn't
 have any proper windows, but by the sound of it, it overlooks the
 road.

 You can leave to the west.

 You hear the clanking of dishes.

>examine graffiti

 There's only a modest amount of graffiti in this place, written in
 permanent marker. "LOVE is the greatest force", one reads. Another
 less high-minded one reads, "CHEESE".

 You hear a sudden gurgle from the plumbing.

>examine toilet

 It's a minor miracle there was even a working toilet here, so despite
 the cracked seat you really can't complain.

 You hear the clanking of dishes.

>examine sink

 The taps here are mottled with rust. A thin dribble of water is all
 that comes out when you experimentally turn the tap on. Under the sink
 are some bottles of drain cleaner and bleach.

 You hear people shouting downstairs.

>get bottles

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine drainc cleaner

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine drain cleaner

 The bottle reads, "DISSOLVES RAGS, GREASE, PAPER AND OTHER MATERIALS
 FAST!". Sure, a standard promise, but terrifying all the same.

 You hear a sudden gurgle from the plumbing.

>examine bleach

 No-brand bleach, which you identify as such by its smell.

 You hear people shouting downstairs.

>drink bleach

 You stare at the opening of the container contemplatively, but your
 sense of self-preservation is strong enough to stop you from raising
 the bottle to your lips. You did your rotation in A&E, and you'd seen
 people who had actually drank bleach. It's a bad way to go.

>examine paper

 A straggly roll of toilet paper.

 You hear frying pans sizzling.

>use toilet

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>get bleach

 No, don't do that! Anyway, whoever cleans the toilet will need it
 here.

 You hear the clanking of dishes.

 A gushing torrent of water comes washing down the toilet bowl.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Here, the sounds of the eatery below are louder. Be careful you don't
 get spotted by anyone. The stairs leading down have been barricaded
 with a metal gate, so best to respect the measures that Subra put up

 There's a cardboard box here, containing a bunch of reading materials.
 Your room is to the north, and the washroom is to the east.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Attic Room</span>
 This is a room in an attic, one of hundreds of other rooftops and

 seeing as it's so caked up with pigeon doings and dirt, it's not much
 use. There's a bed, a desk and a chair.

 You might leave the room to the south, when it's quieter. You can get
 to the washroom from the hallway.

 You suddenly hear the sounds of a violinist tuning their instrument,
 the tentative tinkle of a pianist. They're having house music tonight.
 It must be Tuesday.

 Pigeons roosting on the roofs coo in their liquid burble.

 A sudden cheer goes up from the dining area below you, and you hear
 the beginnings of a toast: "<span class="floydstyle em">Yaaa-aaaammmmmm...</span> seng!"

 It was an annual dinner organised by the medical council in Perigosan
 for GPs, one of those "networking" things that you always abhorred.
 (But hey, the food was good. It more than made up for the karaoke
 section.)

 At the time, you'd just gotten the post at the Grémillet household.
 People were intensely curious how this locally educated nobody got the
 job. Was it connections? (Impossible. Your father was a teacher; your
 mother, a programmer.) Was it money? (What money?) Was it... No, it
 wasn't. But even you had trouble explaining it to them.

 Peter was one of the few friends from school who kept in touch after
 graduation. You remember him as a amiable man who always has a five
 o'clock shadow, and he's a great GP who loves children.

 When you got that job with the Grémillets he was one of the few who
 expressed restraint. "Are you sure you want to spend the rest of your
 career working for them?" he asked you, many times. You'd told him
 you'd had not much choice.

 You wonder what he'd make of this mess now.

 After hell went down over the Grémillet thing, Subramaniam helped you
 find this place. You'll have to lay low for a while, so that means not
 getting out of this room — or at least downstairs — until all this
 blows over. Subra said he'd call you when he'd "settled things".

 Five days have passed, and Subramaniam hasn't called back. Already
 you've started waking later and later.

 indicate that your husband is possessed by the evil spirit of his less

 Uh oh.

 As fast as you can (not very), you crawl on your stomach, through the

 already around 600."
 You shout, "Hold out, doc! I'm coming!" Then you grit your teeth and
 keep crawling.A few meters further and Elbe shouts again.
 "Uh, Alex?"
 "Yeah?What is it?"
 "The warning label is in Fahrenheit ... and my thermometer in

 There is a faint crackling.

 effigy - no wait, it's a stake. And you can see tiny people being
 bound to it. You would recognize Paul's sweater everywhere, so the
 other one must be Dr. Elbe! Oh no! Looks like they arrived way before
 you, a fact the game will skillfully gloss over.You need to save them!

 Finally!
 Perfectly masked as one of them, with the green leaves as object of
 some weird escape plan, you apporach the Town Square. The pyre is
 already piled up high, and Paul and Elbe are tied to each end of a
 stake.
 Right as you approach, one of the cavemen touches the torch to the
 pyre and the whole thing lights up! (Which is unrealistic, but the
 scene needs some dramatic tension).

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Square</span>
 You are surrounded by a crowd of angry cavemen.

 The pyre is burning brightly in the warm evening air. Kind of lovely
 actually. (Paul and Dr. Elbe, tied to it, might think otherwise).

>put leaves in fire

 That can't contain things.

>throw leaves at fire

 You heap the green leaves onto the pyre by the handful. Soon, all the
 cavemen around get the munchies and run off. Guess that clears up the
 cannibalism debate, too. You clamber up the pyre, wood shifting
 underneath you, and cut the rope with the knife you had all the time
 but luckily didn't really need.
 "Alex!" says Paul. "I knew you'd save me!"
 "Just be glad I found the good ending this time!"
 "Uh", Dr. Elbe chimes in, "this dialogue indicates we are still on the
 pyre. We might want to get down?"
 "Yes!" You grab Paul around the waist. "Jump!"
 You and Paul take a dramatic leap aaaaand - land safely. As does Dr.
 Elbe. Your husband stands up, helps you up and eyes you. "Something is
 different about you."
 "Yeah, Paul, I don't know how to tell you this, but, enn, I'm
 straight."
 "What? Why did you never tell?"
 "I only now found out!"
 "Well, have you tried not being straight?"
 "There was this machine and..."
 His face suddenly turns red and he pushes you away. You stumble
 backwards and fall over, "Paul, don't get..."
 The scene seems to freeze. Paul, his arms outstretched. Elbe, to the
 side, just now getting up. The caveman chief, his eyes glowing red,
 the spear, thrown by him, whose tip rests on Paul's breastpocket. Then
 you realise the scene is, in fact, frozen.

 Huh.

 "Hello,Alex" the voice is gurgling, distorted, like club music. "So
 nice to finally meet you."
 "You - you are the Queen of Hurts and Maladies. You've been behind all
 this for a few games, haven't you?"
 "Yes. In your future, I rule the earth. It's my past, but that's not
 important now."
 "Really? I think some players would like some exposition."
 "Yes. I think this works better if I remain mysterious. Now listen. I
 have a proposition. In the future, you and Paul will stop me.
 Obviosuly, I can't let this happen. So I propose the following: You
 will travel back to your past, to the day you meet him in that
 psychology course all those years ago."
 "Oh yeah, I blogged about it. Oh man, good thing I  have a LJ life
 account. I should log in, I wonder what Toby43 is up to."
 "Yes. I propose that you go back and just don't approach him, let him
 walk down the hallway. Three zzzs should be enough."
 "And if I refuse, Paul will die here, and I will be trapped in the
 stone age.So I can choose between 8 good years with him or a lifetime
 alone."
 "Correct."
 "That is a harsh choice, let me think..."
 "No". The Queen of Hurts and Maladies grins with crooked teeth. "The
 time is now." She raises a hand.Snaps a finger, and you...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">University Hallway</span>

 You are alone. You stand at a valley entrance, surrounded by black
 mountains. Grey cloud sag, like dying sheep in a dark purple sky. To
 the north, inside the valley, there seems to be some sort of building
 in the distance.

 "Oh hey" says Paul, "this thing looks very nice! An antique, I guess?
 Anway, thanks. I don't smoke though."
 "Always keep it close to your heart."

 One stable time loop later...

 Your husband stands up, helps you up and eyes you. "Something is
 different about you."
 "Yeah, Paul, I don't know how to tell you this, but, enn, I'm
 straight."
 "What? Why did you never tell?"
 "I only now found out!"
 "Well, have you tried not being straight?"
 "There was this machine and..."
 His face suddenly turns red and he pushes you away. You stumble
 backwards and fall over, "Paul, don't get..."
 He blinks as the spear bounces off the case in his breastpocket.
 You grab him by the hand. "Run, Paul, run! Doctor El-"
 But it's too late. Reality itself brakes apart as the Queen of Hurts
 and Maladies arrives in a rush of fury.
 You dare to defy me, Alex! You DARE!"
 "Now listen you bitc-"
 "Hey now!" says Paul. "What's with the gendered insults?"
 "I'm sorry. Listen you, crazy -"
 "Really, ableism?"
 "Listen you bastard ...
 Paul hmms. "I'll allow it."
 "ENOUGH!" screams the queen. "I'll scatter you across time and space.
 SEE HOW YOU STOP ME THEN!"
 Purple lightning cruises from her outstretched hands towards you.
 You turn towards Paul and kiss him hard.
 "I thought you were straight now?"
 "Have you looked at yourself lately? Nobody is THAT strai-"
 The lightning hits.

 Paul is getting closer.

 "You're the guy from my psychology class, aren't you? Alan?" He
 smirks. As if he doesn't know your name. You smile back, and the world
 gets a whole lot brighter again.

 So, from here you live your life exactly as before, as to not distort
 the timeline. Dr. Elbe warned you about this, and she will warn you

 He blinks as the spear bounces off the case in his breastpocket.
 You grab him by the hand. "Run, Paul, run! Doctor El-"
 But it's too late. Reality itself brakes apart as the Queen of Hurts
 and Maladies arrives in a rush of fury.
 You dare to defy me, Alex! You DARE!"
 "Now listen you bitc-"
 "Hey now!" says Paul. "What's with the gendered insults?"
 "I'm sorry. Listen you, crazy -"
 "Really, ableism?"
 "Listen you bastard ...
 Paul hmms. "I'll allow it."
 "ENOUGH!" screams the queen. "I'll scatter you across time and space.
 SEE HOW YOU STOP ME THEN!"
 Purple lightning cruises from her outstretched hands towards you.
 You turn towards Paul and kiss him hard.
 "I thought you were straight now?"
 "Have you looked at yourself lately? Nobody is THAT strai-"
 The lightning hits.


 I beg your pardon?

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scorched Earth</span>
 You are alone. You stand at a valley entrance, surrounded by black
 mountains. Grey cloud sag, like dying sheep in a dark purple sky. To
 the north, inside the valley, there seems to be some sort of building
 in the distance.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Valley Path</span>
 The mountains tower oppressively high. You take fast, deep breaths.
 The air seems damp, yet thin, as if it's poisoned. The path continues
 north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple Entrance</span>
 Carried by columns of black basalt, the entrance to a small, ruined
 temple beckons you.

 A huge monster, a twirling mass of endlessly writhering tentacles,
 guards the temple entrance. These are not tentacles, they are ...
 twine? How odd. A twine monster. You notice that the monster has a
 myriad eyes, all glowing red.

 You can also see a corpse here.

>examine corpse

 Oh, look, this must have been famous time traveller Enathan Elask.
 Looks like he made it to the future after all. Only to suffer a slow
 and agonizing death.He clutches a brass lantern in his cold, dead
 hands.

>light light

 You can't see any such thing.

>get lamp

 You can't see any such thing.

>light lantern

 This dangerous act would achieve little.

>take lantern

 Taken.

>examine it

 A classic, oil-powered brass lamp. It's still lit.

>loot corpse

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take lantern

 You already have that.

>burn monster with lamo

 I only understood you as far as wanting to burn Twine Monster.

>burn monster

 This dangerous act would achieve little.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a brass lantern
   a cigarette case
   a water bucket
   a plush rat

>pull twine

 Twine Monster might not like that.

>examine monster

 You see nothing special about Twine Monster.

>knot twine

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tie twine

 What do you want to tie Twine Monster to?

>tie twine to lantern

 You would achieve nothing by this.

>elask

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tie twine to temple

 You can't see any such thing.

>throw lantern at twine

 "Hey Wally! Lighten up!"
 The twine monster screams as it is suddenly set ablaze, and soon
 crumbles to ash. Looks like twine lacks substance.
 Suddenly, there is a terrible howling in the air! For a second you
 think you see red-glowing eyes, then something smashes into you like a
 gust of wind. You scream, stumble backwards, and finally fall over.
 You lie there, under that alien sky, you don't know for how long. Ever
 so slowly you get on your knees and crouch towards a nearby pool of
 rank water.
 From the surface, red glowing eyes look back at you.
