 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Trembling, you fire the heavy arquebus. You hear its loud report over
 the roaring wind, yet the dark figure still approaches. The gun falls
 from your nerveless hands.
    "You won't kill me," he says, stepping over the weapon. "Not when I
 am the only protection you have from Jean Lafond."
    Chestnut hair, tousled by the wind, frames the tanned oval of his
 face. Lips curving, his eyes rake over your inadequately dressed body,
 the damp chemise clinging to your legs and heaving bosom, your gleaming
 hair. You are intensely aware of the strength of his hard seaworn body,
 of the deep sea blue of his eyes. And then his mouth is on yours, lips
 parted, demanding, and you arch into his kiss...
    He presses you against him, head bent. "But who, my dear," he
 whispers into your hair, "will protect you from me?"

 LATE ONE SPRING NIGHT IN THE WEST INDIES...

    A crash overhead! Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first
 mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.
    "Good, you brought the girl," Davis smirks. "She'll keep the pirates
 busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that
 cof--" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. "Let's go." The
 captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.
    His laugh echoes. "Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be
 there for the rest of your life."

 Cabin, on the bed
    You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through
 a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the
 room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.

>examine me
 You are wearing a cotton frock, very pretty, if a tad outmoded for
 today's fashions.

>get up
 You get out of the bed.
    "Aaieeee!" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.

>search bed
 You find nothing.

 room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.
    "Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!" cries a rough voice.

>heave chest
 [I don't know the word "heave."]

 It appears to be locked.
    Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A
 coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.

>examine porthole
 Through the porthole you see the bow of the pirate ship bucking in the
 high seas, lit by the fires burning on deck. It is called the "Helena
 Louise." Odd, that was your mother's name.

 This isn't the opening kind of porthole.

>inv
 [I don't know the word "inv."]

>inventory
 You have your reticule (hanging from your wrist). It seems that your
 reticule contains smelling salts and a banknote. You are wearing your
 kid slippers, a linen chemise and a cotton frock.

    Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking
 man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. "Me name's Andy
 Crulley, and ladies learn to love me," sniggers the pirate.
    "The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!" yells someone.

 You are wearing a cotton frock, very pretty, if a tad outmoded for
 today's fashions.
    "Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty," sniggers the pirate. His breath
 is heavy with rum.
    You recognize a voice from far away, "Don't take that! Look in the
 cabin at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!" It sounds like
 Davis.

>read note
 You can't read a banknote!
    "They calls me Andy, but I'm really randy," sniggers the pirate,
 advancing toward you.
    Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then
 suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned,
 Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.
    A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from
 striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of
 his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the
 stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you
 realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots.
 Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the
 sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue eyes.

>plead for mercy
 [I don't know the word "plead."]

>falcon, ravage me
 [I don't know the word "ravage."]

>examine eyes
 They look just like your eyes.
    To your surprise, the stranger bows. "Well met, my lady." His accent
 is cultured, his smile vibrant. "I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known
 in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me." He chuckles
 at your glare of distrust. "Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't
 believe me untried -- I carry this." He hands you a missive.
    With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.

>take missive
 You already have the missive.
    The pirate captain glances around the empty room, then notices the
 coffer. "Davis's safety box -- my men were hoping I'd find it." He
 takes it and nudges the unconscious man on the floor, "I wonder how
 Crulley knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he
 wakes."
    The pirate bows. "My lady, may I offer my protection and my ship
 until your father is free?"

>read missive
 The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:

 "Dearest child,
    You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a
 saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of
 his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!
    I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman,
 whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding
 him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.
    You will be safe -- but there is another for whom I fear! My horse
 is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you.
 Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with
 love, your father."

    "We haven't time to waste. Will you come willingly or not?" says
 Captain Jamison.

>aye
 [I don't know the word "aye."]

>yes
 You nod tentatively.
    He chuckles. "Brave lady, to trust a stranger -- and a pirate. Who
 knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we
 go to my ship -- few sailors respect a lady's dignity." He helps you
 through the door.

 Deck
    The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires,
 silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.
    Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the
 back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and
 bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to
 face you.

 Although your voice is quite piercing, no one notices you.
    Davis leaps across the deck to your side, "Free me or she dies!" he
 yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain
 Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a
 bloody heap.
    Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of
 being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and
 laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the
 Falcon has left you in peace.
    You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the
 door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old man and eaten in silence.
 Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.

 [Press RETURN or ENTER to continue.]

>take knife







 TWO DAYS LATER...

    You blear awake from a bored nap, focusing on something shiny. You
 discern it to be a new ring, on a strong hand in the act of tying a
 ribbon onto a rapier.
    The man with the rapier and the ring turns, "Sorry, I tried not to
 wake you." You sit up as if the bed had caught fire, for this is the
 Falcon, changed from his rags to a finery all red velvet and white lace
 -- and in your presence!

 Captain's Quarters, on the bed
    You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you
 have been trapped these past days since your "rescue" from the Lafond
 Deux. The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy
 table, and a rumpled bed (upon which you lie). A curtain masks the
 forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window
 looking aft.

    Captain Jamison is adjusting his clothes.

>emasculate air
 [I don't know the word "emasculate."]

 You can't reach the curtain from the bed.
    "We have anchored off St. Sinistra," says Captain Jamison, "and I
 must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free
 your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond." He half
 draws his rapier from its scabbard.

 You'll have to stand up first.
    "I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my
 lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with
 few principles." He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand.
 You feel your color rising. "If anything goes wrong, turn to Cookie. He
 is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through."

 You get out of the bed.
    His look darkens. "You should know why I hate Lafond: Some years
 ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia,
 pirates struck. Their ship was boarded, looted and burned, the women
 taken, never to be seen again. A sailor, the one survivor, watched as a
 man of Lafond's description shot my brother in the back as he tried to
 save the women. Lafond has now bought respectability, but he shall
 never buy peace." Jamison straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.

>xyzzy
 [I don't know the word "xyzzy."]

>tell man to fuck himself
 You can't see any man here.

 Captain's Quarters
    The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy
 table, and a rumpled bed. A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded
 woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.

>l in window
 The moon beckons across the lagoon to St. Sinistra. Moored to the stern
 is a skiff.

>jump out window
 Suicide is not the answer.

 [I don't know the word "woodwork."]

 Did you have any particular direction in mind?
    You hear the large cupboard scrape, and turn to see Captain Jamison.
 "Hello! I came down to give you this -- my allotment from the coffer."
 He nods at the box in his arms.
    Jamison starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your clothes, but, "Devil
 take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired." He folds the
 pretty thing into your hand. "And I meant to reassure you that if the
 men suddenly abandon ship, they are off to help me. Rodney will stay
 behind with you." He drops the coffer on the floor, smiling in
 farewell, and walks swiftly away.

>open coffer
 Opening the coffer reveals an invitation.

 coffer: Taken.

>inventory
 You have a coffer, a jewelled brooch, a missive and your reticule
 (hanging from your wrist). It seems that the coffer contains an
 invitation. It seems that your reticule contains smelling salts and a
 banknote. You are wearing your kid slippers, a linen chemise and a
 cotton frock.

 It is a small heavy chest, with a smashed lock. It is open.

 The invitation is addressed to "Davis":

        In Honor of Jean Lafond,
          recently proclaimed
        Governor of St. Sinistra
         A Dance at his Mansion
       Ananas Road, St. Sinistra
 Formal Dress and Invitation Required.

    A ball! You haven't been to a ball in months!
    Men clomp about overhead and a rope ladder unfurls itself past the
 window. Jamison climbs down it, entering the skiff that awaits him
 below. He rows to the island as the men above your head disperse,
 calling farewells to their captain.

    "Good, you brought the girl," Davis smirks. "She'll keep the pirates

    You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through

 It appears to be locked.

 Time passes...
    Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A
 coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.

>open coffer
 It's quite locked.
    You recognize a voice from far away, "Don't take that! Look in the
 cabin at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!" It sounds like
 Davis.

>take coffer
 Taken.
    With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.

>inventory
 You have a coffer and your reticule (hanging from your wrist). It seems
 that your reticule contains smelling salts and a banknote. You are
 wearing your kid slippers, a linen chemise and a cotton frock.
    "Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!" cries a rough voice.

>examine chemise
 It's covered by other clothes.
    Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking
 man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. "Me name's Andy
 Crulley, and ladies learn to love me," sniggers the pirate, advancing
 toward you.

>kick andy
 Your slippered toes could not hurt Crulley.
    "Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty," sniggers the pirate. His breath
 is heavy with rum.
    "Aaieeee!" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.

>kiss andy
 "Wi' a wannion! I likes me ladies forward!"
    "They calls me Andy, but I'm really randy," sniggers the pirate,
 advancing toward you.
    Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then
 suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned,
 Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.
    A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from
 striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of
 his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the
 stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you
 realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots.
 Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the
 sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue eyes.
    With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.

>examine falcon
 Jamison carries an aura of power unusual in men so slim and tall, the
 strength of a willow in his hard seaworn body, straight shouldered and
 resilient. Chestnut hair, tousled by the wind, frames the tanned oval
 of his face. A jagged scar etches one cheek, harsh against the warmth
 of his limpid blue eyes.
    To your surprise, the stranger bows. "Well met, my lady." His accent
 is cultured, his smile vibrant. "I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known
 in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me." He chuckles
 at your glare of distrust. "Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't

 until your father is free?"

 You nod tentatively.
    He chuckles. "Brave lady, to trust a stranger -- and a pirate. Who
 knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we
 go to my ship -- few sailors respect a lady's dignity." He helps you
 through the door.

    The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires,
 silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.
    Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the
 back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and
 bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to
 face you.

    You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you
 have been trapped these past days since your "rescue" from the Lafond

 looking aft.

    "We have anchored off St. Sinistra," says Captain Jamison, "and I
 must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free
 your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond." He half
 draws his rapier from its scabbard.

>examine rapier
 Jamison's rapier is a dangerous looking sword with a narrow pointed
 blade. It is decorated with a big floppy ribbon.
    "I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my
 lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with
 few principles." He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand.

 I don't see what you're referring to.

        Governor of St. Sinistra
         A Dance at his Mansion
       Ananas Road, St. Sinistra
 Formal Dress and Invitation Required.

    A ball! You haven't been to a ball in months!

 Time passes...
    The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.

>search bed
 You find nothing.
    The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.

>l under bed
 There's nothing under the bed.

>sing
 [I don't know the word "sing."]

>remove dress
 You take off the cotton frock.
    The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.

>examine chemise
 The linen chemise, kneelength and sleeveless, clings damply to your
 legs and torso.

>examine frock
 It is your favorite old frock, looking rather bedraggled without its
 hoops, which you hadn't time to put on during the pirate attack. The
 worn fabric of the skirt often catches on things, tearing.

>repair frock
 But the cotton frock isn't broken!

 Captain's Quarters
    The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy
 table, and a rumpled bed. A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded
 woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.

>examine ladder
 Completely common looking rope ladder.
    The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.

>inventory
 You have an invitation, a coffer, a jewelled brooch, a missive, your
 reticule (hanging from your wrist) and a cotton frock. It seems that
 your reticule contains smelling salts and a banknote. You are wearing
 your kid slippers and a linen chemise.

>wait
 Time passes...
    The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.

>examine reticule
 You and Mama made the little drawstring bag a few months before she
 passed on. It's amazing how much it can hold.

>examine brooch
 All diamonds winking fire, tears of sapphire and crushed rubies in an
 oval setting, it is a pity that the clasp of the jewelled brooch has
 broken. The gold pin at the back swings about uselessly.
    The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.

>throw coffer at porthole
 You hurl the coffer through the window, sending it and a shower of
 glass into the sea. The ledge now looks deep enough to sit upon.

>enter ledge
 You climb onto the ledge. The ladder drifts within reach.

 Captain's Quarters, on the ledge
    The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy
 table, and a rumpled bed. A curtain masks the forward exit and air
 breezes in over the ledge aft.

>climb ladder
 You put everything in your reticule and reach out for the ladder and
 over-balance, tumbling from your perch. Your hand closes on a slimy
 hemp rung as you fly out over the waves, clinging tenuously, feet free,
 to the ladder.

 On the Ladder
    You are clinging to a slimy ladder, tied to a rail of the poop deck
 above you. Not far from your feet, waves kiss the stern of the ship.

>go up
 You climb up the ladder.
    All air is driven out of you as the ladder slams into the stern.

>go up
 You climb up the ladder, passing the halfway point.
    Rebounding, the ladder twists you around to face the Helena Louise.

>go up
 You climb up the ladder.
    The ladder swings back towards the Helena Louise.

 [I don't know the word "helenda."]

 You may use prepositions to indicate precisely what you want to do:
 LOOK AT the object, LOOK INSIDE it, LOOK UNDER it, etc. In this case
 I'll take you to mean LOOK AT the object.

>go up
 You heave yourself over the stern rail and sink breathless to the deck
 of the Helena Louise.

 Poop
    From this platform deck you can see the whole of the two-masted
 ship, shadowy forms moving about here and there. A railing protects you
 from stepping off the deck in any direction but to the fore. A rope
 ladder is tied to the railing at the stern of the ship.
    The ship is floating midway between the island and a line of reefs.

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Aye-aye.

>take ladder
 If you wish to climb down the ladder, say so.
    Your eyes are drawn to a flicker of light off the sea. Squinting,
 you see a man swimming to shore, moonlight flashing off his hook. A
 wisp of breeze brings an odor of onions and rum, and the occasional
 gargling chuckle, "...mischief, har...reefs."

 You can't see any man here.

 the fairer sex, and they are a bit rough, despite Rodney Quick's
 exhortations.

 St. Sinistra is blessed with lush tropical beauty, jungle besieging the

 They are dainty yet practical kidskin shoes.

 (hanging from your wrist). It seems that your reticule contains a
 missive, an invitation, smelling salts and a banknote. You are wearing
 your kid slippers and a linen chemise.

 The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:

 "Dearest child,
    You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a
 saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of
 his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!
    I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman,
 whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding
 him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.
    You will be safe -- but there is another for whom I fear! My horse
 is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you.
 Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with
 love, your father."


 [I don't know the word "poop."]

 [I don't know the word "rail."]

 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

 There's nothing extraordinary about the railing.

 If you wish to climb down the ladder, say so.

>swing ladder
 You're not holding the ladder.

>sniff smelling salts
 You jerk the smelling salts away from your nose after one brief
 ammoniac whiff. Your burning nostrils make you feel more alert.

>stand on railing
 Don't bother.

 The rope is tied in too complex a knot.

>go up
 You can't go that way.

 You climb down to opposite the ledge.

 On the Ladder

 You dash up the ladder.

 Poop

 [You used the word "help" in a way that I don't understand.]

>go down
 You climb down to opposite the ledge.

 On the Ladder
    You are misted in the spray of waves hitting the reefs. The island
 is far away.

>enter ledge
 You pull yourself over the ledge, tumbling head over heels into
 Jamison's quarters.

 Aft Hold
    This is a gloomy, damp area at the bottom of the Helena Louise. To
 the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up
 some steep stairs.
    Suddenly you appreciate what it is to be a ball in an exploding
 cannon. The intense heat, the push of fire, and the sense of release
 when spit from the cannon's mouth -- these you feel when the lighted
 fuse finally burns up to the largest keg of gunpowder in the hold.

>examine cupboard
 It is closed.

>open cupboard
 Opened. It is a dark messy bed, set entirely within and filling the
 large cupboard. A cabin boy must sleep here when Jamison isn't using
 it. Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.

>take clothes
 You can't reach the pile of clothes.

>enter cupboard
 Sleeping Cupboard
    The bed is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A
 soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of Jamison. The
 cupboard opens to the fore.
    Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.

 To get a better look, you pick up the pile of clothes. It separates
 into a pair of breeches and a shirt.

 [Which clothes dost thou mean, the breeches, the shirt, the cotton
 frock, or the linen chemise?]

 You tuck the linen chemise into the pants. You look a little fat, but
 now you can move freely.

 It fits loosely, masking your figure.

    Steep stairs lead up in the dimness to a canvas hatch above. Rats'
 scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the
 bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the deck overhead. You may
 move fore or aft.
    Behind a high fence, decorated by a sign, are stacked the food and
 ammunition supplies; casks of rum, water, flour and salt meat
 interspersed with kegs of gunpowder and shot. A closed gate is the only
 way in.
    You gradually notice a familiar, worrying smell, sniff, and identify
 it as smoke. A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor --
 inside the cage full of ammunition.

    This area must also serve as sickroom. Strewn about the floor are
 various powders and spills of malodorous potions. In one corner, a
 large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a
 leech, dropped off a bloodletting.
    A small bottle has been dropped nearby.

    Your face convulses in a prodigious yawn.

 Time passes...
    You stare into space for a long, thoughtless moment. It seems very
 hard to think, you think, but you aren't sure.

 Time passes...
    Your eyes are extraordinarily dry. You blink to moisten them, and
 snort awake a minute later, drool dripping down your chin.

 Lying on their sides, the casks are stacked in a rather shaky pyramid:
 perhaps that's why someone has tied the rope about them. A cask on one

 good view of the island; the "crow's nest," swinging above in the
 heights of the foremast, would command a better. A tangled mass of
 rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven
 together.
    Imbedded in the deck is a grated air hole to the crew's quarters
 below. You can go aft, or forward through a break in the ubiquitous

    Odors of old grease and char waft from a little shack perched behind

    The reefs are definitely getting larger.
    You can see a mooring winch here.

>examine winch
 Made of an old barrel turning on a pole, the mooring winch is used to
 coil in the anchor chain. A pair of metal teeth bite the links to
 prevent it from dragging out; a lever is connected to the teeth.
 Something is written on the lever.

>read lever
 On the lever is written "Open Up, Close Down." You notice the lever is
 pointed down.

>pull lever
 You'll have to specify which way you want to move it.
    Bswish! Waves smash against the reefs nearby.

>pull lever up
 The metal teeth open as you raise up the lever. The anchor, released,
 splashes down into the sea, dragging its clanking chain. After a
 moment, you feel the ship pull slightly against the current. You lower
 the lever to prevent any more chain from spooling out.

>examine shack
 It's a tiny charred wooden shack.

    With a heave and creak of timbers, the Helena Louise drifts a little

    This tiny kitchen smells of old stew and yeast. A low door to
 starboard shows the way out.
    A dagger is driven into the wooden floorboards.
    An entirely bald man sits here, carving into his peg leg.
    The man looks you over sharply, then winks an eye. "Hullo, boy --
 Sam, I'll call you. Nervous about Cap'n? He'll come to no harm. And if
 there is trouble, he only has to signal from that seaward winder of the
 house -- ye can see it from the crow's nest -- and we'll be there in a

    Buried in the subtropical undergrowth, you lose all sense of being
 on someone's private estate; jungle seems to extend for miles on all
 sides of you. A footworn path curves from east to north here, and the
 vegetation lessens to the northeast.

>go northeast
 Clearing
    You are in a small clearing under the western side of the house.
 Heavy vines creep up the wall past a second floor window, open to the
 night air. Southwest is an opening in the bushes.

>climb vines

 In these clothes? You jest.

>remove dress
 You take off the cotton frock.

>climb vines
 You take a firm grasp on a particularly thick tendril, jerk once to
 secure it, and scamper up the wall like some huge tropical spider. It
 is easy to climb through the window.

 Bedroom
    Lit only with moonlight through the open window, tonight this room
 is serving as a ladies' dressing room. An exit lies to the north.
    Draped across the bed is a lovely cream colored watered silk gown.
 It looks about your size.

 [Which dress dost thou mean, the beautiful ball gown or the cotton
 frock?]

 Of cream silk, heavily embroidered on the stiffened skirt and
 stomacher, the beautiful ball gown is a work of art.

 You slide the garter up around your thigh.

 [Which dress dost thou mean, the beautiful ball gown or the cotton

 The beautiful ball gown fits perfectly, the creamy silk bringing a glow
 to your cheeks. You comb your hair with your fingers and bite your lips
 to make them red.

    You are on a wide balcony overlooking the ballroom. A hallway lies

    Down on the dance floor you see myriad colors as the guests weave
 the intricate steps of their dances.
    A chandelier is held above the dance floor by a rope and pulley
 system, so that the servants can lower it to light and snuff its
 candles. Several feet of rope hang down from the pulley, the excess
 tied around the railing.

 Untied. The chandelier swings slightly, dribs of hot wax spilling to
 the floor.

 Ballroom
    Lafond's party is well attended: you can hardly move for the crush.
 However, the room is oddly silent, no talk interrupting the musical
 efforts of the musicians to the west. Despite the heat, no one ventures
 south to the veranda, nor through the opening east. The foyer is north
 of you.
    Captain Jamison moves up to you, saying, "May I have this dance?" He
 doesn't await an answer, sweeping you out onto the dance floor.

>dance
 You pace out the steps.
    "What the devil are you doing here! Lafond is a dangerous man to
 play with!" Jamison smiles suddenly. "Why should I complain? You are
 quite safe, since no one expects you here. And you are looking lovely."
    The steps of the dance separate you a moment, as you twirl around
 and curtsey to another dancer. You glide back into the captain's arms.

 You've never been missish enough to faint on demand.
    "I haven't found your father. We've long suspected a passage under
 the library, but I cannot find an entrance," says Jamison.
    Your hands linked tightly with his and held high over your heads, a
 line of dancers files between you and Jamison.

 "I abhor the fiend." He clenches a fist.
    "If there is any trouble, and I am unable to help -- a signal from
 an upstairs seaward window will bring my men. They can be here in
 moments," the Captain says.
    Together you whirl around the ballroom, his arm snug around your
 waist, leading you gracefully, masterfully.
     Nicholas's grip tenses as he nods to a bewigged man staring at you.
 You turn, and the man moves on.

>shorty george
 [I don't know the word "shorty."]

 Jamison is finely dressed, in red velvet coat and full breeches, with a
 long gold embroidered vest and waterfalls of white lace at his neck,
 wrists and boottops. His rapier is bedecked with a fringed gold ribbon.
 He wears no wig, his unpowdered hair tied neatly at the back of his
 neck.
    "I wish you would call me 'Nicholas' -- I feel I know you much
 better than our brief acquaintance would allow." He presses your hand.
    The music ends with a flourish and you pirouette once more before
 curtseying to Jamison. As you move to the side of the dance floor, Nick
 adds, "We should separate -- I'm sure I am being watched. You would be
 safer aboard the Helena Louise. If you slip out the veranda doors, no
 one will notice you leaving." He touches your hand and dissolves into
 the crowd.

 the south.
    An expensive hat is hanging on a knob.

 However, the room is oddly silent, no talk interrupting the musical
 efforts of the musicians to the west. Despite the heat, no one ventures
 south to the veranda, nor through the opening east. The foyer is north
 of you.
    A fashionably bewigged man stalks up to you and bows deeply. "Will
 you dance?" he asks, with a light French accent. "Not that you have
 much choice. If you turn me down, your father dies."

 Lafond grabs your hair and pulls your head sharply back, clinching your
 arms to your sides. The ballroom is a whirling blur through your tears
 as he leads you around the floor. "Ma petite, a ball is not the right
 place to kill me. What would my guests think?!"
    The man's smile hardens. "You have your father's eyes. I am Lafond
 --  I have recently become intimate with that gentleman." He slightly
 stresses the word "intimate."
    "Now, tell me 'yes.' And remember, I am a man of my word."

>no
 "No," you say, chin trembling.
    "A mistake, ma petite." Lafond gestures to a shadowy figure, who
 disappears into the east wing. "Say adieu to your dear Papa."

 "No," you say, chin trembling.

 You summon a gracious smile, "Why yes, I'd love to."
 He laughs triumphantly and pulls you into the dance.

>step on lafond's toes

>wait
 Time passes...
    "So you know I am not your father's friend," Lafond says, offering a
 hand for the promenade. "Unfortunately, you are in my power, he is in
 my dungeon and I am still King of these waters." A gold ring flashes on
 his hand. It seems vaguely familiar.

>examine ring
 It's an ancient gold band, with a curious design of gargoyles, curled
 tongues extended, on its flat face, with "Sal Sapit Omnia" engraved at
 the bottom.
    Lafond's eyes rake your body. "When I am ready, the butler will
 summon you to sup with me in my room; it may be some time. We will find
 much in common before dawn, I am sure. Then I may free your father."
 Lafond bows as the dance ends, and kisses your hand. He cocks his head,
 curious, "You have far less spirit than your father credited you. He
 swore you would have him freed in no time at all. A pity, I prefer
 doyennes with mettle." He moves to speak with the butler, then drifts
 into the crowd.

    As you enter, a tall bony man moves out of the darkness. "Papa," you
 cry, rushing into his arms.
    "Why, hullo, my dear." He hugs you tightly. "Nick certainly took his
 time about fetching you."

 "My dear," he says rather impatiently, "There are people waiting for
 our help -- I haven't time to answer your questions just now."
    You briefly explain the current situation to your father.
    "I knew Falcon would do his best to rescue me, once you were safe,"
 he responds. "Now to rescue Lucy -- Nicholas will have told you about
 her. You get him while I get Lucy, and the four of us will meet down at

 muttering, "Never seen you sleep like this before." It stirs to life as
 your father walks over to you by the north entrance. The reptile,

    Flickering torchlight lights the bottom of a spiral staircase. A
 draft blows from the east; a passage leads south.
    Papa follows you.

 Stairwell
    Cool salt air, blowing past a torch on a spiral staircase below you,
 ruffles your hair and circles south into the library.
    Papa enters just a few steps behind you.

 You can't go that way.

 You move beyond the portrait into the library.

 Library
    Everything in this private office is larger than life. A huge
 portrait, slightly awry from the wall, decorates the north side, and
 black drapes mask the east wall. Bookshelves tower over a cherry desk,
 and a massive wooden globe squats in a corner. Music wafts distantly
 from the ballroom across the hall to the south.
    An expensive hat is hanging on a knob.
    Papa mutters something to himself. You hear an occasional "Zounds!"
    "A window!" your father exclaims. "I shall creep out to the kitchen.
 Get the Falcon." He climbs out the window.

 East Hallway
    The carpeted hallway turns from west to north here, extending into
 the east wing. A long table blocks the way south.
    There is a commotion from the west. A woman screams and a man yells,
 "Stop, Pirate!" You run to the foyer in time to see two dragoons
 dragging out the battered frame of Captain Jamison.
    An officer quiets the guests, "This is the buccaneer who has been
 pirating our ships. He had the audacity to come here tonight intending
 to assassinate our dear governor. Do not worry, ladies, he was arrogant
 enough to come alone." The officer marches after his men. The dancers
 return to their banal conversations.

 Foyer
    A grandiose staircase splits and twists up to the next floor here,
 framing the entrance south to the ballroom. Long hallways lead east and
 west; cool night air drifts in through the front door, north of you.
    The butler stands near the entrance to the ballroom.

 Ballroom
    Lafond's party is well attended: you can hardly move for the crush.
 However, the room is oddly silent, no talk interrupting the musical
 efforts of the musicians to the west. Despite the heat, no one ventures
 south to the veranda, nor through the opening east. The foyer is north
 of you.

 "Welcome, ma petite." Lafond bows you in.

 Lafond's Bedroom
    Lafond's bedroom shows all the outpourings of his megalomania. Royal
 hues of purple and gold weigh down the hangings on the bed and the
 eastward window, as if trying to smother the moonbeam shining in.
    Lafond is leering, lip curled.
    A lace-covered table crouches beside a wing-backed chair in one
 corner. Sitting on the table is a green goblet, a blue goblet and a
 flagon.
    "Have some wine." Lafond pours wine into two glasses, giving a blue
 one to you. "Drink this down. We have a long night ahead of us." He
 drains his own.

>SAVE
>cf8
 Enter saved game to store: Aye-aye.

>put laudanum in green goblet
 Lafond bounds to your side, grabbing the leather bottle out of your
 hand before you can use it. "What have we here? Trying to poison
 yourself? Or me?" He throws it out the shutters.
    Lafond waits impatiently for you to drink.

>/undo

>drink wine
 You empty the blue goblet of wine.
    "Good girl," he says, "Let's see more cooperation of this sort."
    Suddenly, the door slams open. It is Jamison, coatless, sword bared,
 his shirt ripped. "Thank God I am not too late. Leave, darling, before
 I skewer this dog to his bedposts," he cries. The scar on his cheek
 gleams coldly.
    With a yell, Crulley and the butler jump out of the darkness behind
 him. Nicholas struggles, but soon lies unconscious on the floor.
    "Take him to the dungeon," Lafond says, setting down his glass.
 "You, butler, stay nearby. I do not wish to be disturbed again.
    "Now that we are rid of that intrusion, cherie, I will change into
 something more comfortable. Pour me more wine." He crosses to the
 wardrobe removing his coat and vest, turned slightly away from you.

>pour wine in green goblet
 You fill the green goblet with wine.
    "In private, call me Jean, or whatever endearment you choose, once I
 have approved it." Lafond is looking into the wardrobe.

>put laudanum in green goblet
 You squeeze three colorless drops into the green goblet. You sense
 Lafond hesitate, then continue primping.
    The butler enters, laying a silver tray of cold chicken on the
 table. "The kitchen wench has gone, your grace. I took the liberty of
 fetching these myself." He bows and leaves the room.
    "Sprinkle some spices on the fowl, ma petite," Lafond says, donning
 a long brocade robe, his back to you. "They are hot, but delicious."

>spice chicken
 [There was no verb in that sentence!]

>put spice on chicken
 You're not holding the spices.
    "Tsk. The cook has gone too far. She shall be 'leaving us'
 tomorrow." Lafond adjusts the lace at his neck.

>take spice
 You take a pinch of spices between your thumb and forefinger.
    Lafond strolls to the table smiling slyly. "But you haven't finished
 pouring the wine." He tops off both glasses. "Which glass was mine? I
 seem to have forgotten." He points at the green goblet and smiles in a
 way that does not grant you confidence. "Is this it?"

>put spice on chicken
 You sprinkle some spices on a wing and nibble at it. The peppery heat
 hits you like a wave, leaving you gasping, eyes watering.
    "Ah yes, of course." Lafond obligingly takes the green goblet,
 shrugging off your lack of cooperation.
    He inhales deeply of the bouquet of his wine, then turns to you.
 "You must think me very naive to fall for such a trick. I saw you pour
 something into one of these glasses -- although I cannot smell it." He
 switches goblets, setting the green goblet into your nerveless grasp
 and taking up the other, smiling evilly. "Now you will drink from the
 cup intended for me."

>throw green goblet at lafond
 The delicate glass of the green goblet shatters into pieces.
    Lafond smacks you hard across the face with the back of his hand,
 "Fool." He casts aside all formalities.

 in my employ."
    He lifts his glass to drink, but stops. "Your father, for all his
 idiotic meddling in other people's business, is not a fool. I doubt you
 are, either." He calls in the butler, ordering him to empty the blue
 goblet. The man reports no odd taste and returns to his post.

 You're not holding the spices.
    Lafond draws near, whispering indecencies. He caresses your lily
 white neck, his fingers ice-cold despite the tropic heat.

>eat chicken
 You sprinkle some spices on a wing and nibble at it. The peppery heat
 hits you like a wave, leaving you gasping, eyes watering.
    Lafond slides his hand up your neck and into your hair, letting it
 fall down your back in thick waves and tresses. He lays everything you
 carry on the floor.

 You have your reticule (hanging from your wrist). It seems that your
 reticule contains a bit of mirror, a missive, a jewelled brooch,
 smelling salts and a banknote. You are wearing a beautiful ball gown, a
 garter, your kid slippers and a linen chemise.
    One by one Lafond undoes your buttons. He pulls open your bodice.
 Your clothes float to the floor.
    You hear a "thump-phoosh," like someone slumping against a wall.

>lafond, I'm trying to eat here
 [I don't know the word "i'm."]

>stab lafond with pin
 To put it bluntly, neither the jewelled brooch nor you are very sharp.
    Lafond runs his fingers down your naked spine, and compliments your
 body. He removes his dressing gown.

>wear chemise
 [taking the linen chemise first]
 Lafond stops you.
    Lafond kisses your shoulder, your neck, your ear. "Close your eyes,
 if you will," he taunts, "and pretend I am your dearest Captain
 Jamison. But I am greater than he will ever be." He kisses you, his
 lips thin and cold.

>go south
 Lafond whirls you around. "My pretty, you came here freely, but you may
 not leave freely."
    Lafond leads you over to the bed.

>kick lafond
 Lafond grabs your hair and pulls your head sharply back, clinching your
 arms to your sides. Twisting your wrist, pain stabbing down your arm,
 he forces his mouth on yours, hard, thrusting, cutting your lips. He
 releases you. "Let that be a warning to you, my love."
    Lafond pulls the sheets up to cover you both, pressing his long
 flaccid body against yours. Waves crash against the base of the cliff.

 He sneezes, his eyes watering from the heat of the peppers. Reaching
 blindly for some wine, he instead upsets the table, shattering a glass.
 Lafond stumbles cursing out of the room, in search of relief.

 You run out -- into the butler's barrel chest and leering grin. You
 return to the bedroom, the butler following. "The governor said you

    An eerie battle cry arises on the wind, from all sides of the house.
 It is drowned out a few minutes later by screams of terror from the
 dancers in the ballroom.

 Foyer
    A grandiose staircase splits and twists up to the next floor here,
 framing the entrance south to the ballroom. Long hallways lead east and
 west; cool night air drifts in through the front door, north of you.
    Cookie rushes up to you, looking worried. "Miss, we must find the
 Cap'n. Have ye any idea where to look?"

 East Hallway
    The carpeted hallway turns from west to north here, extending into
 the east wing. A long table blocks the way south.
    Cookie pegs after you.
    Cookie grins broadly, "I knew we could depend on you, lass. Lead
 on!"

 You scuttle underneath the long table.

 Supper Room
    One long table set across the north entrance indicates that supper
 was served here earlier. West of you is the ballroom.
    Cookie pegs after you.

 You scuttle underneath the long table.

 East Hallway
    The carpeted hallway turns from west to north here, extending into
 the east wing. A long table blocks the way south.
    Cookie pegs after you.

 Library
    Everything in this private office is larger than life. A huge
 portrait decorates the north side, and black drapes mask the east wall.
 Bookshelves tower over a cherry desk, and a massive wooden globe squats
 in a corner.
    An expensive hat is hanging on a knob.
    Cookie pegs after you.

 The portrait is closed.

 [I don't know the word "button."]

 You press the painted island, and it sinks into the wooden sea.

 As you lift the hat from its knob on the wall, a low vibration tingles
 up your legs from the floor.

 Pardon?

 You press the painted island, and it sinks into the wooden sea.

 You prop the hat back on the knob.

 As you lift the hat from its knob on the wall, a low vibration tingles
 up your legs from the floor.

 You half tip the book out of the shelf when it snaps surprisingly back
 into place. There is a mysterious scraping sound from inside the wall.

 You press the painted island, and it sinks into the wooden sea. You
 hear a whirr and a click and the portrait pops open. A draft of
 sea-scented air flows in from behind it. Cookie harrumphs, surprised.

 For safety's sake, you leave the hat on its knob. Best not to show that
 you've been wandering.
    You move beyond the portrait into the flickering torchlight.

 Stairwell
    Cool salt air, blowing past a torch on a spiral staircase below you,
 ruffles your hair and circles south into the library.
    Cookie pegs after you.

 Bottom of Stairwell
    Flickering torchlight lights the bottom of a spiral staircase. A
 draft blows from the east; a passage leads south.
    Cookie pegs after you.

 Anteroom
    Two exits lead from this cavernous room, north and south. The walls
 drip with wet, forming a huge pool on the floor.
    The crocodile lies half in the pool, gazing at you, with baleful
 eyes, jaws wide open. Dagger-sharp teeth glint in the torchlight.
    Cookie pegs after you.
    Cookie rushes at the crocodile, crying, "I'll take care of this
 monster, sweetheart. You run by and do what you must do." He dives
 headlong into the pool.

 A whip cracks the air. "Flogs me, will ye, Cap'n? Taste it yourself,
 har." Jamison groans, half conscious. You rush in.

 Dungeon
    You sense, rather than see, the rusty skeletons of old cages and
 torture devices that line the walls of this cavernous room. One flaming
 torch, high on a wall, casts mad licks of light into the darkness.
 Passages lead north and west. Set deep in the rocky floor is an open
 trapdoor.
    Nicholas is spread-eagled against the wall, shackled in the pair of
 manacles.
    A rapier lies in the half-dark of a corner.
    Crulley steps leering out of the shadows and cracks the whip near
 you, hopping you towards the open trapdoor. "What, afrighted of a lick
 o' the whip?"

 Taken. Crulley snorts, "Be careful, you might hurt yer dearie."
    Crulley cracks the whip near you, hopping you towards the open
 trapdoor. "Would yer like a taste o' water?"

 Crulley seems more amazed than frightened of your attack, guessing
 correctly that you hardly know the tip from the hilt of the rapier. He
 steps sideways in surprise, so he stands at the edge of the trapdoor.
    Crulley cracks the whip near you, hopping you towards the open
 trapdoor. "Ye're a tasty doxy to let slip, but no 'elp fer it."

 You flick the rapier across his chest, barely scratching him. He cries,
 "Avast me! Pricked by a woman!" and trips into the trapdoor.
    You peer down the hole to find Crulley hanging in midair, his hook
 caught in the rocks a few yards down. He curses and starts to climb up
 the sheer slimy walls of the well.

 You twist the pin of the jewelled brooch in the locks, quickly freeing
 Nicholas. He falls in a faint at your feet.
    Sounds of scraping hook against stone and curses echo out of the
 well.

 Shut.

 You wave the smelling salts under Nicholas's nose. He stirs, sneezes
 and looks at you blearily. "How --?" he says, bewildered. "Lafond, did
 he --?" He straightens. "Darling, you are an angel, to have gone
 through all this and then rescue me. Your ravisher will not go
 unpunished." He squares his shoulders. "For my brother, his wife, and
 your honor, I will kill Jean Lafond."
    Nick kisses you briefly, a butterfly touching your lips, then seizes
 his rapier and runs off to the north. Cookie calls a breathless "Hullo,
 Cap'n" to him as he races past.
    Sounds of scraping hook against stone and curses echo out of the
 well, muffled by the trapdoor.

 Cookie follows you.

    Cookie chews anxiously at a cheroot.

 You move beyond the portrait into the library.

 Library
    Everything in this private office is larger than life. A huge
 portrait, slightly awry from the wall, decorates the north side, and
 black drapes mask the east wall. Bookshelves tower over a cherry desk,
 and a massive wooden globe squats in a corner.
    An expensive hat is hanging on a knob.
    Cookie pegs after you.
    Cookie cocks his head. "What is that noise? Is Cap'n duelling
 Lafond? There's no chance he could win as beaten as he is!" Cookie
 races out towards the ballroom.
    Swords engage and disengage.

 East Hallway
    The carpeted hallway turns from west to north here, extending into
 the east wing. A long table blocks the way south.
    You hear a duellist leap forward, and swords clash, parrying.

 Foyer
    A grandiose staircase splits and twists up to the next floor here,
 framing the entrance south to the ballroom. Long hallways lead east and
 west; cool night air drifts in through the front door, north of you.
    You hear a piece of furniture being knocked over.

 Stair Landing
    The east-west hallway opens here to curve into a grand staircase
 sweeping down to the foyer.
    You hear metal scrape metal. A woman gasps.

 Upstairs Hall
    You stand in a carpeted hallway, leading west to a stair landing. To
 the north is an ornately carved door. From the south comes the
 impression of light and air.
    "You must ... pay ... for your actions!" Nicholas gasps.

 Gallery
    You are on a wide balcony overlooking the ballroom. A hallway lies
 to the north.
    Down on the dance floor the dancers are pressed in a wide circle
 around Nicholas and Lafond. Cookie stands anxiously in the door to the
 veranda, near your father and Lucy.
    A chandelier is held above the dance floor by a rope and pulley
 system, so that the servants can lower it to light and snuff its
 candles. Several feet of rope hang down from the pulley, the end
 resting on the railing.
    Nicholas and Lafond circle each other intently, the one breathing
 hard, the other casual, sword tips almost touching. Jamison has lost
 copious amounts of blood and is no match for Lafond, cool and
 competent.
 Lafond's voice is cold, lazy, "You will die, you know, Jamison."

 That seems a useless idea.
    Someone calls out, "We've got the Dimsford girl, Governor" -- lying,
 of course, since you're obviously free. But Nick glances towards the
 voice, missteps, and slips in his own blood, falling backwards to the
 floor, his rapier skittering aside.


>swing on rope
 "Aaieeee!" The cry comes uncalled to your lips as you swoop down from
 the balcony, petticoats flying, on the end of the rope.
    Your timing is perfect: you slam into Lafond just as he steps into
 his lunge. His rapier stabs wildly, piercing Nicholas's shoulder,
 missing his heart. You and Lafond roll into a snowball of petticoats
 and brocade, dropping everything between you.








    Nicholas shouts, from far away, "Let me go! Let me deliver Lafond to
 a 'better' world."
    "A gentleman can't kill an unconscious man!" That is Papa's voice.
 "And you're in no shape to continue, Nicholas. Rodney -- help my
 daughter. I'll take Nick."
    Cookie leans over you. "We must get back to the ship, Miss. Dragoons
 surround the house." Nicholas, injured but still arguing, is already on
 the veranda, half-forced, half-supported by your father, shadowed by
 Lucy. Cookie helps you to your feet and rushes after them, expecting
 you to follow. Lafond lies nearby, apparently unconscious.

 Ballroom
    The dancers stare amazed at Lafond's limp body, some disbelieving,
 some hopeful, all stock still. The pirates have fled to the darkness of
 the lawn.
    Lafond, his wig awry, sprawls across the parquet floor.
    You can see breeches, a shirt, a cotton frock, a powder horn, a
 large key and a silver tray here.

>get wig
 [I don't know the word "wig."]

>get all
 breeches: Taken.
 shirt: Taken.
 cotton frock: Taken.
 powder horn: Taken.
 large key: Taken.
 silver tray: Taken.

 Veranda
    Steps lead south from this white marble veranda to a clipped lawn.
 To the north the wreckage left by the duel is visible in the ballroom.

 Lawn
    Jungle looms around this clipped lawn, a path meandering westward
 into the dense undergrowth. To the east is a folly entangled in
 blooming jasmine. The way to the beach is obscure, but visible to the
 southeast. Behind the folly a thorny hedge blocks the cliff view of the
 sea.

 Beach
    This is a tiny beach, at the base of vine-covered cliffs. To the
 east, the Helena Louise floats serenely on the lagoon. Halfway out to
 the ship is a skiff crowded with men; another skiff sits on the sand.
    Immediately north of you, a rocky staircase is hewn into the cliff.
    Cookie, Lucy and your father are moving towards the skiff.
    Nicholas stands alone at one edge of the beach. He has a rapier.
    You splash into the rising surf and pain needles up your leg. Blood
 swirls out from your shoe in the shallow water, flowing over a small
 pointed stone.

>SAVE
>cf11
 Enter saved game to store: Aye-aye.

 Time passes...
    A shot rings out over the roar of the surf. Turning, you see that
 Lafond stands at the top of the cliff, a pistol in each hand. "Trying
 to sneak out the back, cowards? You will die like your brother, Falcon.
 Snivelling for mercy." He hands one gun to Crulley, standing nearby,
 and levels the other at Jamison.

>kill crulley
 Your dainty fists could not hurt Crulley.
    As the gun fires, Cookie throws himself before his captain. He cries
 out, blood blossoming on his shoulder, and falls face first into the
 sand. Lucy runs to him.
    Jamison yells up the cliff, brandishing his sword. "Fight like a
 man, Lafond. You have drawn my blood once tonight -- let me draw
 yours."
    Lafond sneers. "On one condition. If I win, your lady comes to me.
 You will have no need of her when you are dead."
    Nicholas stiffens, glances at the dragoons on the cliff above, and
 turns slowly to you. He says nothing, his face hard, but his eyes tell
 you what you want to know. "Answer, my darling. Yes or no?"

>yes
 You have no breath to speak. You nod once, never taking your eyes off
 Nicholas Jamison.
    Nicholas looks determined. "I accept. So long as my people go free
 if I win. Order your dragoons to obey us, then." In answer, Lafond
 jumps off the cliff like a huge brocaded bat to land in front of
 Captain Jamison. "Die then, fool!"
    The pistol, spinning from Lafond's grip, drops to the sand nearby.

>get pistol
 Taken.
    Lafond immediately takes the advantage, forcing Nicholas in a
 retreat towards the foaming surf. But Nicholas fights hard, jaw set,
 ignoring his wounds. Lafond finally loses his smile.
    Behind the duellists, far away atop the cliff, you notice Crulley
 madly reloading the pistol.

>put powder in pistol
 You pour a lumpy stream of gunpowder mixture into the barrel of the
 pistol tamping it as best you can.
    Suddenly the force of the duel turns, Nicholas advancing against
 Lafond's retreat. Their blades silently flash in the moonlight. Lafond
 is pressed back into the shadow of the cliff, sweat beading on his
 forehead. Abruptly, Jamison leaps forward, metal scrapes, and his
 rapier licks neatly into Lafond's ribs, like a snake slipping into its
 burrow. The body of the governor of St. Sinistra convulses, as in
 amazement, then sags dead on the sword.
    Nicholas removes a gold ring from the dead man's finger, throwing
 his own cheap copy into the surf.
    Far above him, Crulley moves down the stairs.

>inventory
 You have a powder horn, a pistol, a silver tray, a large key, a cotton
 frock, a shirt, breeches and your reticule (hanging from your wrist).
 It seems that your reticule contains a bit of mirror, a missive, a
 jewelled brooch, smelling salts and a banknote. You are wearing a
 beautiful ball gown, a garter, your kid slippers and a linen chemise.
    Crulley is levelling the pistol, feet apart, braced by the cliff
 wall.

>get ring
 Captain Jamison curls his fist around it. "This is the family ring lost
 with my brother."
    Crulley carefully aims the pistol, a triumphal grin benighting his
 face. Nicholas turns and walks smiling towards you, oblivious to his
 danger.

>shoot crulley
 Trembling, you fire the heavy pistol. You hear its loud report over
 roaring surf. Crulley staggers, hit, and falls from the cliff. The gun
 falls from your nerveless hands.
    Time stops as you and Nicholas gaze at one another, adoring and
 amazed. Slowly he bows and offers his hand.
    Chestnut hair, tousled by the wind, frames the tanned oval of his
 face. His eyes, twin seas of blue, devour you with a love deep and
 true-hearted, and you are pulled into his embrace, your mouth on his,
 lips parted, thirsting, arching into his kiss...








 Forecastle
    As dawn breaks over the eastern seas, you stand with Nicholas on his
 ship, looking north. "I have nothing left in England," he says. "There
 I am but a destitute gentleman, wanted for piracy. Here -- this isle
 holds too many memories; your father may have it. Mayhap my brother's
 wife yet lives. I must try to find her, either way." He takes you into
 his arms. "Come with me, my love? To America -- they tell of endless
 fertile fields and strange beasts in that wild land. It won't be easy,
 but we will have each other. Together, shall we carve a kingdom blessed
 with fair children and freedom?"
    You wrap your arms about his waist and lean into him, and smile at
 the rising sun.

    In 437 turns, you have achieved a score of 25 out of 25 points.

 Snivelling for mercy." He hands one gun to Crulley, standing nearby,
 and levels the other at Jamison.

 The skiff is out of reach. Wade into the shallows.
    As the gun fires, Cookie throws himself before his captain. He cries
 out, blood blossoming on his shoulder, and falls face first into the
 sand. Lucy runs to him.
    Jamison yells up the cliff, brandishing his sword. "Fight like a
 man, Lafond. You have drawn my blood once tonight -- let me draw
 yours."
    Lafond sneers. "On one condition. If I win, your lady comes to me.
 You will have no need of her when you are dead."
    Nicholas stiffens, glances at the dragoons on the cliff above, and
 turns slowly to you. He says nothing, his face hard, but his eyes tell
 you what you want to know. "Answer, my darling. Yes or no?"


 [That sentence isn't one I recognize.]

>enter lagoon
 Shallows
    You are holding your skirts high over the warm, lapping waves of the
 shallows. A white sand beach is west of you.
    As the gun fires, Cookie throws himself before his captain. He cries
 out, blood blossoming on his shoulder, and falls face first into the
 sand. Lucy runs to him.
    Jamison yells up the cliff, brandishing his sword. "Fight like a
 man, Lafond. You have drawn my blood once tonight -- let me draw

    Lafond sneers. "On one condition. If I win, your lady comes to me.

 turns slowly to you. He says nothing, his face hard, but his eyes tell
 you what you want to know. "Answer, my darling. Yes or no?"

 You are now in the skiff.
    Lafond calls down to you, "My pretty doxy, do make up your mind. Yes
 or no?"

 You dip the oars and pull them towards you. The skiff plows through the
 lagoon.
    You hear distant shots and screams, and gaze back across the
 restless waves to the massacre on the beach. The sight blurs with your
 tears of shame, tears for the father and the lover you left behind.








    The tale you tell Jamison's crew, of rapine and blood, of your
 heroic attempt to save their captain, and of your own escape after his
 death in your arms, is not so far from the truth that you cannot appear
 sincere. Cannily, you take advantage of their temporary grief, select a
 private guard, and teach the rest the discipline of the whip. You have
 started on the ruthless road to revenge. You intend to meet Lafond
 again, and that time, you intend to win.

    In 433 turns, you have achieved a score of 25 out of 25 points.
    Thus you have finished the story of PLUNDERED HEARTS, earning the

 lodges in the sand.








 Trembling, you fire the heavy arquebus. You hear its loud report over
 the roaring wind, yet the dark figure still approaches. The gun falls
 from your nerveless hands.
    "You won't kill me," he says, stepping over the weapon. "Not when I
 am the only protection you have from Jean Lafond."
    Chestnut hair, tousled by the wind, frames the tanned oval of his
 face. Lips curving, his eyes rake over your inadequately dressed body,
 the damp chemise clinging to your legs and heaving bosom, your gleaming
 hair. You are intensely aware of the strength of his hard seaworn body,
 of the deep sea blue of his eyes. And then his mouth is on yours, lips
 parted, demanding, and you arch into his kiss...
    He presses you against him, head bent. "But who, my dear," he
 whispers into your hair, "will protect you from me?"

 LATE ONE SPRING NIGHT IN THE WEST INDIES...

    A crash overhead! Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first
 mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.
    "Good, you brought the girl," Davis smirks. "She'll keep the pirates
 busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that
 cof--" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. "Let's go." The
 captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.
    His laugh echoes. "Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be
 there for the rest of your life."

 Cabin, on the bed
    You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through
 a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the
 room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.

    Nicholas stiffens, glances at the dragoons on the cliff above, and
 turns slowly to you. He says nothing, his face hard, but his eyes tell
 you what you want to know. "Answer, my darling. Yes or no?"

>no
 You shake your head firmly, "No."
    Lafond cries, "No deal then. Take them, men!" The dragoons pour down
 the cliff.

>/undo

>yes
 You have no breath to speak. You nod once, never taking your eyes off
 Nicholas Jamison.
    Nicholas looks determined. "I accept. So long as my people go free
 if I win. Order your dragoons to obey us, then." In answer, Lafond
 jumps off the cliff like a huge brocaded bat to land in front of
 Captain Jamison. "Die then, fool!"
    The pistol, spinning from Lafond's grip, drops to the sand nearby.

>get pistol
 Taken.
    Lafond immediately takes the advantage, forcing Nicholas in a
 retreat towards the foaming surf. But Nicholas fights hard, jaw set,
 ignoring his wounds. Lafond finally loses his smile.
    Behind the duellists, far away atop the cliff, you notice Crulley
 madly reloading the pistol.

>load pistol with powder
 You pour a lumpy stream of gunpowder mixture into the barrel of the
 pistol tamping it as best you can.
    Suddenly the force of the duel turns, Nicholas advancing against
 Lafond's retreat. Their blades silently flash in the moonlight. Lafond
 is pressed back into the shadow of the cliff, sweat beading on his
 forehead. Abruptly, Jamison leaps forward, metal scrapes, and his
 rapier licks neatly into Lafond's ribs, like a snake slipping into its
 burrow. The body of the governor of St. Sinistra convulses, as in
 amazement, then sags dead on the sword.
    Nicholas removes a gold ring from the dead man's finger, throwing
 his own cheap copy into the surf.
    Far above him, Crulley moves down the stairs.

>fire pistol in air
 You fire the pistol into the air. Startled by the loud report, Crulley
 jerks his pistol and fires, aiming not at Nicholas, but at you. You
 hear a distant scream, your own, and watch, as through from afar, your
 father wrestle Crulley to the ground. You feel only numbness as loving
 arms take you up, and Nicholas kisses you into death, his tears damp on
 your cheek.

       ***   You have died   ***


    In 435 turns, you have achieved a score of 25 out of 25 points.
    Thus you have finished the story of PLUNDERED HEARTS, earning the
 title, "Love Transcending Death." There are other, perhaps more
 satisfying, conclusions.
