 Amazing! After all these years some girl finally got Jack to propose.
 All you need to do is hop on a commuter plane, get the big lug to the
 church on time, and zip back. Piece of cake...

 Well, almost.  Blasted El Ni?o has air traffic in an uproar. This
 daily commuter flight out of San Francisco was delayed three times,
 which will make life fun when you finally make it down to San Diego...

 Airplane (on Seat 4B)
 The airlines claim that planes are getting bigger, but you don't
 believe a word of it. This cramped cabin feels about as roomy as a
 culvert, and has approximately the same decor.

 There is a door south and a small kitchenette north.

 Rob Menke (author) -- Rob has been interested in adventure games ever
 since he played "Zork I" on an old Apple ][ back in the early '80s. He
 is often tempted to add "Finished 'Stationfall' in a four-day marathon
 session" to his resume. "The Best Man" is his first interactive
 fiction game for use by the general public. Please direct all bug
 reports to his interim mailing address robmenke@mac.com (Rob is in the
 process of changing ISPs so response may be delayed.)

 Christopher Livingston (playability, details) -- That you can use
 "lube" as a verb and propose to the conductor are both thanks to
 Chris. All IF authors should be as lucky to have a tester as disturbed
 as he is. You are encouraged to visit his web site:

 Mark Rosenfelder (continuity, structure) -- The closing sequence was
 completely rewritten at the request of Mark, who felt its silly tone
 conflicted with the rather graphic endgame. The task-oriented nature
 of the hints are his brainchild; they assume less and provide more.

 Airplane (on Seat 4B)

 There is a door south and a small kitchenette north.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a sport coat (being worn)
     a small velvet box (which is closed)

>open box
 You open the small velvet box, revealing a diamond ring.

 The plane shudders slightly.

>eat ring
 (first taking the diamond ring)
 That's plainly inedible.

>examine ring
 What a rock!  How did Jack ever afford such a thing?

 *** PING ***

 "Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing some minor turbulence.
 Please return to your seat and fasten your seat belts."

>scream
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

 Feel better now? Good.

 The passenger next to you awakes with a start.

 You put on the diamond ring.

 "I hate flying," your seat-mate bemoans.

>talk to mate
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask mate about flying
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine passenger
 He's wide awake, gripping the armrests with white-knuckled fear. You
 find his fixed-forward stare somewhat disturbing.

 The plane lurches hard to the left. Your stomach churns.

 "I always wonder if I'll ever see my daughter again."

>kill me
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 "What would my wife do if I were to die?"

>ask passenger about flying
 He's too busy babbling to pay any attention to you.

 A bright blue flash illuminates the entire west side of the airplane,
 followed by the noise of a tremendous explosion. The wing is on fire!

 For a brief moment, everything is silent as the situation slowly sinks
 into the minds of the passengers. Then pandemonium breaks out in the
 cabin as the plane goes into a near-vertical dive.

 "It's all your fault, you know."

 Your traveling companion turns to face you, and you recoil in horror.
 The left side of his face is horribly mutilated, the skin torn and
 burnt. The empty eye socket stares at you accusingly.

 "Why did you have to survive? I had a family, a child... they depended
 on me! You had nothing! You were nothing, and you still are nothing!"

 He leans forward, and you can smell the horrid odor of burnt flesh.

 "Nothing..."

 Crash positions be damned! You struggle at your seat belt, but the
 mechanism is jammed.

 He's moving closer... reaching out... reaching toward you... the
 stumps of his fingers... twitching... touching you... shaking you...

 ...and you find yourself wrestling the station attendant.

 "Sorry about that! Didn't mean to startle you, but by the sound of it
 you were having a dilly of a nightmare!

 "Anyway, you best be going. I've written a note explaining the
 situation to the conductor; it's on the back of your ticket. Better
 hurry."

 You take the ticket and a copy of the schedule and make your way out
 to the platform.

 Sole survivor syndrome.

 That's what they call it. Psychological trauma after surviving an
 accident that killed so many others.

 You still can't look at a plane without hearing the screaming or
 smelling the blood. The last time you tried to visit an airport-- just
 to pick up someone-- you left in an ambulance, catatonic.

 Things were looking bad when the old rust bucket died this morning.
 The mechanic said that the earliest he could get to it was first thing
 Monday morning, and the rental agency just laughed when you asked if
 you could get a car on short notice for the weekend. Flight was out of
 the question for obvious reasons, but rail had existed far earlier
 than planes. So you found yourself pleading your case to a sympathetic
 station manager, who managed to squeeze you onto a special charter
 train direct to San Diego.

 Two years ago, the wedding was postponed indefinitely by your
 accident. You are determined that that will not happen again. The sun
 is shining, the tracks are clear, and in a few hours you'll be the
 star of the show. Come Hell or high water, nothing is going to stop
 you from being...

 THE BEST MAN
 An Interactive Action-Adventure
 by Rob Menke
 Release 1 / Serial number 000930 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10

 Car 3 (on seat 4B)
 Trains haven't changed much in the last 40 years. You could just
 imagine a furtive Cary Grant slipping from car to car or a diabolic
 Robert Walker plotting fiendishly in some corner.

 You can see the conductor here.

>hit conductor
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 "Ticket, please."

 The conductor is on duty and cannot fraternize with the passengers.

>refuse to give ticket
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a sport coat (being worn)
     a small velvet box (which is closed)
     a train schedule
     a ticket

>read ticket
 It's a hastily scrawled message:

 John,

 The kid needs a ride down to San Diego. There should be a seat open on
 the Special. Just keep quiet about it and no one will be the wiser.

 The conductor is getting impatient.

 (the conductor)
 He's a handsome man, about 50, with an immaculate uniform. He stands
 straight and proud, driven by the conviction that he has an important
 job and that he does it very well.

 A small twitch near the side of his mouth hints at impatience.

>propose to conductor
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>show ring to him
 You can't see any such thing.

>open box
 You open the small velvet box, revealing a diamond ring.

 The conductor is getting very impatient.

>give ring to conductor
 (first taking the diamond ring)
 The conductor politely refuses your offer of marriage. Besides, it's
 not your ring to give.

 "Very well, you leave me no choice."

 He blows his whistle three times. Suddenly you are surrounded by burly
 security guards, who escort you unceremoniously off the train.

 All for the best, it turns out. Only a few hours later, all of
 southern California is irradiated in a nuclear accident.

 The conductor reads the back of the ticket quickly. "Ah, that explains

 CLUNK. The conductor punches the ticket and returns it you.

 He walks north to the next car.

 It's a hastily-printed train schedule, a photocopy smudged to near
 illegibility by your sweaty hands.

 "Whoops!"

 One of the reporters was walking down the aisle with a large cup of
 coffee when the train jerked. Guess who was unlucky enough to be in
 front of him when that happened?

 You better do something about this stain. While your jacket isn't
 especially stylish, it would look bad to show up dressed like a bum.

>examine jacket
 Threadbare, but serviceable.  Better clothes await you in San Diego,
 which is good as these have a nasty stain. Inside the pocket you see a
 small velvet box (in which is a diamond ring) and a train schedule.

 You get off seat 4B.

 Car 3

 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>go north

 Car 3, Aft
 This tiny space near the junction to the next car is unremarkable,
 save the cramped stairway to the upper level and the door to the tiny
 lavatory west.

 The closed door says "Unoccupied."

>give ring to child
 You can only do that to something animate.

>go west
 You can't, since the lavatory door is in the way.

>open door then w
 You open the lavatory door.

 Lavatory
 This compartment leaves very little room for movement, but you're not
 here to do the macarena. A stainless-steel lavatory sits next to a
 tiny sink. A window west provides some light, which is nice as the
 fluorescent fixture above the mirror is not on.

 The exit is east.

>do the macarena
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>cut window with ring
 (first taking the diamond ring)
 Cutting that up would achieve little.

>wash suit
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine sink
 A small stainless-steel sink.

 You turn on the faucet, allowing water to flow into the sink.

 You can't see any such thing.

>wash jacket
 You need more light to do a proper cleanup.

>turn on light
 A cursory glance around the room fails to reveal a visible switch.

>examine door
 It's a lavatory door, with a sliding bolt that changes the indicator
 on the outside from "Unoccupied" to "Occupied." High-tech stuff.

>lock door
 You click the door lock, and watch the little window change from
 "Unoccupied" to "Occupied" momentarily. Some spring mechanism in the
 door prevents you from keeping it locked while the door is open,
 however.

>drink me to death
 You can't see any such thing.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to drink yourself.

>ligh
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>light
 What do you want to light?

>examine light
 The light fixture is dark.

 The flow from the faucet stops suddenly. (It must have one of those
 spring valves to prevent waste.)

>close door
 You close the lavatory door.

 Suddenly, a group of armed terrorists takes over the train. In the
 resulting confusion, you are "accidentally" shot, adding a rather
 nasty bloodstain to the coffee stain already on your old jacket.


     *** You have died ***


 In that game you scored 5 out of a possible 100, in 28 turns.

 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move,

>go north
 "Whoops!"

 Oh dear, it seems that you bumped into a young man carrying an open
 container of coffee, most of which is now decorating the front of your
 jacket.

 Car 3, Aft
 This tiny space near the junction to the next car is unremarkable,
 save the cramped stairway to the upper level and the door to the tiny
 lavatory west.

 The closed door says "Unoccupied."

>open door then w
 You open the lavatory door.

 Lavatory
 This compartment leaves very little room for movement, but you're not
 here to do the macarena. A stainless-steel lavatory sits next to a
 tiny sink. A window west provides some light, which is nice as the
 fluorescent fixture above the mirror is not on.

 The exit is east.

 Outside the lavatory
 It's quite breathtaking out here, and you'd probably enjoy the scenery
 if it weren't for the annoying fact that you're clinging to a flimsy
 metal ladder while being buffeted by sixty mile-per-hour winds. Safety
 lies inside, east.

>close window
 Better not, you might not be able to get it open again.

 Unfortunately, there are more than a few missing rungs in this ladder,
 making the roof of the car inaccessible.

 It isn't that hopeless yet.

>lock door
 You click the door lock, and watch the little window change from
 "Unoccupied" to "Occupied" momentarily. Some spring mechanism in the
 door prevents you from keeping it locked while the door is open,
 however.

>close door
 You close the lavatory door.

 The light above the sink flickers, then glows.

 There seems to be a commotion outside.

 Your Russian may be rusty, but a voice definitely said, "Sergei, check

 The screams have died down, so the gunmen have decided to start the
 usual diatribe. "We now control this train... if you cooperate, you
 will be spared... attempt tricks and you will die..."

>go down

 "Is everyone here?"

 "Everyone was here or in the press car," the conductor replies,
 strangely calm. "As you can see, everyone in this car is also on this

 Junction Between Car 4 and 5
 Between each pair of cars is an area which has always frightened you.
 Maybe it's the fact that the area is open save for a flimsy metal
 railing across the gaps; maybe it's the constant shifting of the floor
 beneath your feet. Safer areas lie south and north.

 Even though every ounce of sanity left in your body tells you not to,

 Handholds in the top of the car allow one to move carefully across the
 surface, but make no mistake about it: one slip means a short but
 unpleasant trip over the side. The handholds travel south or north
 along the length of the train, provided one does not get snagged on
 the numerous air vents and lights protruding from the surface.

 Junction Between Car 4 and 5
 Between each pair of cars is an area which has always frightened you.
 Maybe it's the fact that the area is open save for a flimsy metal

 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

 You pull off the front of the wooden crate. Horror grips your stomach
 as you survey the infernal contraption inside. It could be only one

>examine bomb
 The rose-colored glass hampers your ability to make out details...

 A curious glass tube sticks out of a mass of electronics glued to the
 back of the box. Inside the tube you see a swirling gas. A thin gold
 wire spirals its way around the outside of the tube.

 A glass dish sits under a thick metal coil, which dangles from another
 breadboard packed with electronics.

 In the center of the bomb is a Plexiglas box.

 Sitting on a nest of electronics within the glass box is an ominous
 black sphere.

 Above the glass box is an antique pair of brass scales, curiously out
 of place when compared to the high-tech components around them. The
 metal dishes normally associated with such scales have been replaced
 by two labeled Pyrex beakers.

 Amazing! After all these years some girl finally got Jack to propose.
 All you need to do is hop on a commuter plane, get the big lug to the
 church on time, and zip back. Piece of cake...

 Well, almost.  Blasted El Ni?o has air traffic in an uproar. This
 daily commuter flight out of San Francisco was delayed three times,
 which will make life fun when you finally make it down to San Diego...

 Airplane (on Seat 4B)
 The airlines claim that planes are getting bigger, but you don't
 believe a word of it. This cramped cabin feels about as roomy as a
 culvert, and has approximately the same decor.

 There is a door south and a small kitchenette north.

 (First time players should type INFO for game-playing details.)

>wake up
 This nightmare is all too familiar...

 A bright blue flash illuminates the entire west side of the airplane,
 followed by the noise of a tremendous explosion. The wing is on fire!

 For a brief moment, everything is silent as the situation slowly sinks
 into the minds of the passengers. Then pandemonium breaks out in the
 cabin as the plane goes into a near-vertical dive.

 "It's all your fault, you know."

 Your traveling companion turns to face you, and you recoil in horror.
 The left side of his face is horribly mutilated, the skin torn and
 burnt. The empty eye socket stares at you accusingly.

 "Why did you have to survive? I had a family, a child... they depended
 on me! You had nothing! You were nothing, and you still are nothing!"

 He leans forward, and you can smell the horrid odor of burnt flesh.

 "Nothing..."

 Crash positions be damned! You struggle at your seat belt, but the
 mechanism is jammed.

 He's moving closer... reaching out... reaching toward you... the
 stumps of his fingers... twitching... touching you... shaking you...

>look under seat
>fly plane
                    [Please press SPACE to continue]








 ...and you find yourself wrestling the station attendant.

 "Sorry about that! Didn't mean to startle you, but by the sound of it
 you were having a dilly of a nightmare!

 "Anyway, you best be going. I've written a note explaining the
 situation to the conductor; it's on the back of your ticket. Better
 hurry."

 You take the ticket and a copy of the schedule and make your way out
 to the platform.

                    [Please press SPACE to continue]








 Sole survivor syndrome.

 That's what they call it. Psychological trauma after surviving an
 accident that killed so many others.

 You still can't look at a plane without hearing the screaming or
 smelling the blood. The last time you tried to visit an airport-- just
 to pick up someone-- you left in an ambulance, catatonic.

 Things were looking bad when the old rust bucket died this morning.
 The mechanic said that the earliest he could get to it was first thing
 Monday morning, and the rental agency just laughed when you asked if
 you could get a car on short notice for the weekend. Flight was out of
 the question for obvious reasons, but rail had existed far earlier
 than planes. So you found yourself pleading your case to a sympathetic
 station manager, who managed to squeeze you onto a special charter
 train direct to San Diego.

 Two years ago, the wedding was postponed indefinitely by your
 accident. You are determined that that will not happen again. The sun
 is shining, the tracks are clear, and in a few hours you'll be the
 star of the show. Come Hell or high water, nothing is going to stop
 you from being...

 Car 3 (on seat 4B)

 Amazing! After all these years some girl finally got Jack to propose.
 All you need to do is hop on a commuter plane, get the big lug to the
 church on time, and zip back. Piece of cake...

 Well, almost.  Blasted El Ni?o has air traffic in an uproar. This
 daily commuter flight out of San Francisco was delayed three times,
 which will make life fun when you finally make it down to San Diego...

 Airplane (on Seat 4B)
 The airlines claim that planes are getting bigger, but you don't
 believe a word of it. This cramped cabin feels about as roomy as a
 culvert, and has approximately the same decor.

 There is a door south and a small kitchenette north.

 (First time players should type INFO for game-playing details.)

>wait

>wait

>wait

>get up
 You'll need to undo your belt first.

 The plane shudders slightly.

>undo belt
 You open the seat belt.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a sport coat (being worn)
     a small velvet box (which is closed)

 *** PING ***

 "Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing some minor turbulence.
 Please return to your seat and fasten your seat belts."

>open box
 You open the small velvet box, revealing a diamond ring.

 A breathless flight attendant rushes up and clips your belt closed for
 you, then disappears.

 The passenger next to you awakes with a start.

>wear ring
 (first taking the diamond ring)
 You put on the diamond ring.

 "I hate flying," your seat-mate bemoans.

>run
 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

 The plane lurches hard to the left. Your stomach churns.

 "I always wonder if I'll ever see my daughter again."

>run north
 You'll have to get off Seat 4B first.

 "What would my wife do if I were to die?"

>get up again
 I only understood you as far as wanting to get the ceiling.

>stand up
 You'll need to undo your belt first.

 A bright blue flash illuminates the entire west side of the airplane,
 followed by the noise of a tremendous explosion. The wing is on fire!

 For a brief moment, everything is silent as the situation slowly sinks
 into the minds of the passengers. Then pandemonium breaks out in the
 cabin as the plane goes into a near-vertical dive.

 "It's all your fault, you know."

 Your traveling companion turns to face you, and you recoil in horror.
 The left side of his face is horribly mutilated, the skin torn and
 burnt. The empty eye socket stares at you accusingly.

 "Why did you have to survive? I had a family, a child... they depended
 on me! You had nothing! You were nothing, and you still are nothing!"

 He leans forward, and you can smell the horrid odor of burnt flesh.

 "Nothing..."

 Crash positions be damned! You struggle at your seat belt, but the
 mechanism is jammed.

 He's moving closer... reaching out... reaching toward you... the
 stumps of his fingers... twitching... touching you... shaking you...

>wait
                    [Please press SPACE to continue]








 ...and you find yourself wrestling the station attendant.

 "Sorry about that! Didn't mean to startle you, but by the sound of it
 you were having a dilly of a nightmare!

 "Anyway, you best be going. I've written a note explaining the
 situation to the conductor; it's on the back of your ticket. Better
 hurry."

 You take the ticket and a copy of the schedule and make your way out
 to the platform.

                    [Please press SPACE to continue]








 Sole survivor syndrome.

 That's what they call it. Psychological trauma after surviving an
 accident that killed so many others.

 You still can't look at a plane without hearing the screaming or
 smelling the blood. The last time you tried to visit an airport-- just
 to pick up someone-- you left in an ambulance, catatonic.

 Things were looking bad when the old rust bucket died this morning.
 The mechanic said that the earliest he could get to it was first thing
 Monday morning, and the rental agency just laughed when you asked if
 you could get a car on short notice for the weekend. Flight was out of
 the question for obvious reasons, but rail had existed far earlier
 than planes. So you found yourself pleading your case to a sympathetic
 station manager, who managed to squeeze you onto a special charter
 train direct to San Diego.

 Two years ago, the wedding was postponed indefinitely by your
 accident. You are determined that that will not happen again. The sun
 is shining, the tracks are clear, and in a few hours you'll be the
 star of the show. Come Hell or high water, nothing is going to stop
 you from being...

 Car 3 (on seat 4B)
 Trains haven't changed much in the last 40 years. You could just
 imagine a furtive Cary Grant slipping from car to car or a diabolic
 Robert Walker plotting fiendishly in some corner.

 You can see the conductor here.

>read note
 (in the conductor)
 You discover nothing of interest in the conductor.

 "Ticket, please."

>give ticket
 (to the conductor)
 (first taking the ticket)
 The conductor reads the back of the ticket quickly. "Ah, that explains
 why you're not on my list."

 CLUNK. The conductor punches the ticket and returns it you.

 He walks north to the next car.

 Car 3

>go north
 "Whoops!"

 Oh dear, it seems that you bumped into a young man carrying an open
 container of coffee, most of which is now decorating the front of your
 jacket.

 Car 3, Aft
 This tiny space near the junction to the next car is unremarkable,
 save the cramped stairway to the upper level and the door to the tiny
 lavatory west.

 The closed door says "Unoccupied."

>go west
 You can't, since the lavatory door is in the way.

>open door
 You open the lavatory door.

>go west

 Lavatory
 This compartment leaves very little room for movement, but you're not
 here to do the macarena. A stainless-steel lavatory sits next to a
 tiny sink. A window west provides some light, which is nice as the
 fluorescent fixture above the mirror is not on.

 The exit is east.

>close door
 You close the lavatory door.

>lock door
 The light above the sink flickers, then glows.

 There seems to be a commotion outside.

>open window
 You open the lavatory window.

 Wait... was that gunfire...?

 The fluorescent light goes off.

 Your Russian may be rusty, but a voice definitely said, "Sergei, check
 the toilets."

 It's quite breathtaking out here, and you'd probably enjoy the scenery

 A voice outside the door says, "Empty."

 "Is everyone here?"

 "Everyone was here or in the press car," the conductor replies,
 strangely calm. "As you can see, everyone in this car is also on this

 Junction Between Car 3 and 4
 Between each pair of cars is an area which has always frightened you.
 Maybe it's the fact that the area is open save for a flimsy metal
 railing across the gaps; maybe it's the constant shifting of the floor
 beneath your feet. Safer areas lie south and north.

 The door to car 3 slides shut.

>examine floor
 Something felt wobbly when you stepped into this area, and a quick
 investigation reveals the answer. It's a metal access panel embedded
 in the floor of the train, with a sawtooth-edge that makes it almost
 invisible against the pattern of the floor.

 The train just zoomed by the Salinas station.

 Junction Between Car 4 and 5
 Between each pair of cars is an area which has always frightened you.
 Maybe it's the fact that the area is open save for a flimsy metal
 railing across the gaps; maybe it's the constant shifting of the floor
 beneath your feet. Safer areas lie south and north.

 You see a concealed maintenance access hatch in the floor here.

 You can also see an external ladder, a sport coat (in which are a
 bottle of hydroxide (which is empty), a strange red bulb, a small
 plastic tube (which is closed) (in which is some litmus powder), a
 punched ticket, a small velvet box (which is closed) and a train

 and other mechanisms you take for granted whenever you travel by rail.
 You can crawl south or north along the length of the car.

>go north
 Some of the acid sloshes out of the bottle of acid.

 Slowly you crawl northwards along the length of the train...

 Underneath the junction between cars 5 and 6
 You're in a small gap between the cars. Small maintenance tunnels lead
 south and north, although they are rather small and probably not safe
 when the train is in motion. A maintenance hatch above you offers more
 traditional passage on the train.

 A prominent lever is attached to the car junction. The lever has been
 pushed into the "closed" position.

 Junction Between Car 5 and 6
 Between each pair of cars is an area which has always frightened you.
 Maybe it's the fact that the area is open save for a flimsy metal
 railing across the gaps; maybe it's the constant shifting of the floor

 (The maintenance access hatch slams shut when you release it to move.)
 You open the door to car 5.

 Car 5
 This car may have been a kitchen car, or perhaps it was temporarily
 converted into one for the purposes of this trip. In either case, the
 recent occupation by the terrorists has left it in shambles. Exits
 lead south and north.

 The lifeless bodies of the terrorists lie scattered around the car.

 The refrigerator must have been broken, as a heavy-duty ice chest sits
 in the corner.

 separate.

 unceremoniously onto the tracks. Not pleasant.

 A glass dish sits under a thick metal coil, which dangles from another
 breadboard packed with electronics.

 In the center of the bomb is a Plexiglas box.

 Sitting on a nest of electronics within the glass box is an ominous

 Mail Car
 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest
 of the train:  it's a mail transport car. Bags of letters and parcels
 fill the shelves around you, almost completely obscuring the one light
 fixture in the car. The sliding metal door east offers a possible
 exit.

 In front of you stands a large metal box, closed on all sides save the
 front, which is protected by a pane of glass. The rose-tinting of the
 glass hints at rather than exposes the complicated machinery held

 Junction Between Car 5 and 6
 Between each pair of cars is an area which has always frightened you.
 Maybe it's the fact that the area is open save for a flimsy metal

 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest

 In front of you stands a large metal box, closed on all sides save the

 Mail Car
 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest

 In front of you stands a large metal box, closed on all sides save the
 front, which is protected by a pane of glass. The rose-tinting of the

 This car may have been a kitchen car, or perhaps it was temporarily

 recent occupation by the terrorists has left it in shambles. Exits

 Car 4, Fore
 So this is the press car. Big deal. It's just a modified sleeper, with

 Darkroom
 This lavatory has been converted into a makeshift darkroom. (I guess
 some photographers haven't joined the "digital revolution.") All the

 Mail Car
 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest
 of the train:  it's a mail transport car. Bags of letters and parcels
 fill the shelves around you, almost completely obscuring the one light
 fixture in the car. The sliding metal door east offers a possible
 exit.

 An open metal hatch reveals the sun and sky above.

 The beam of sunlight from the open metal hatch draws your eyes to a
 large wooden crate sitting at the north end of the car.

 You can also see a can of lubricant here.

 You pull off the front of the wooden crate. Horror grips your stomach

 thing: a bomb.

>examine bomb
 The rose-colored glass hampers your ability to make out details...

 A curious glass tube sticks out of a mass of electronics glued to the
 back of the box. Inside the tube you see a swirling gas. A thin gold
 wire spirals its way around the outside of the tube.

 A glass dish sits under a thick metal coil, which dangles from another
 breadboard packed with electronics.

 In the center of the bomb is a Plexiglas box.

 Sitting on a nest of electronics within the glass box is an ominous
 black sphere.

 Above the glass box is an antique pair of brass scales, curiously out
 of place when compared to the high-tech components around them. The
 metal dishes normally associated with such scales have been replaced
 by two labeled Pyrex beakers.

>examine beakers

 Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?

 A glass Pyrex beaker, maximum capacity 500ml, with something scrawled

 Handholds in the top of the car allow one to move carefully across the
 surface, but make no mistake about it: one slip means a short but

 Junction Between Car 4 and 5
 Between each pair of cars is an area which has always frightened you.

 After you've gathered your wits together, you notice that the "spider"
 is actually a piece of black paper folded into the shape of a spider.

 Mail Car
 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest
 of the train:  it's a mail transport car. Bags of letters and parcels
 fill the shelves around you, almost completely obscuring the one light
 fixture in the car. The sliding metal door east offers a possible
 exit.

 An open metal hatch reveals the sun and sky above.

 The beam of sunlight from the open metal hatch draws your eyes to a
 large wooden crate sitting at the north end of the car.

 You can also see a can of lubricant here.

 You pull off the front of the wooden crate. Horror grips your stomach
 as you survey the infernal contraption inside. It could be only one
 thing: a bomb.

>examine bomb
 The rose-colored glass hampers your ability to make out details...

 A curious glass tube sticks out of a mass of electronics glued to the
 back of the box. Inside the tube you see a swirling gas. A thin gold
 wire spirals its way around the outside of the tube.

 A glass dish sits under a thick metal coil, which dangles from another
 breadboard packed with electronics.

 In the center of the bomb is a Plexiglas box.

 Sitting on a nest of electronics within the glass box is an ominous
 black sphere.

 Above the glass box is an antique pair of brass scales, curiously out
 of place when compared to the high-tech components around them. The
 metal dishes normally associated with such scales have been replaced
 by two labeled Pyrex beakers.

>examine beakers
 Which do you mean, the left beaker or the right beaker?

>left
 A glass Pyrex beaker, maximum capacity 500ml, with something scrawled

 As you cut the glass, you hear a gentle hiss, as if gas is escaping.

 Whumpf! The white powder suddenly bursts into flame!

 Amazing! After all these years some girl finally got Jack to propose.
 All you need to do is hop on a commuter plane, get the big lug to the

 Well, almost.  Blasted El Ni?o has air traffic in an uproar. This
 daily commuter flight out of San Francisco was delayed three times,
 which will make life fun when you finally make it down to San Diego...

 Airplane (on Seat 4B)
 The airlines claim that planes are getting bigger, but you don't

 Lavatory
 This compartment leaves very little room for movement, but you're not

 tiny sink. A window west provides some light, which is nice as the
 fluorescent fixture above the mirror is not on.

 The exit is east.

>wash coat
 Alas, all you do is spread the stain slightly. This job requires
 water.

>turn on sink
 You turn on the faucet, allowing water to flow into the sink.

>wash coat
 You need more light to do a proper cleanup.

 You click the door lock, and watch the little window change from
 "Unoccupied" to "Occupied" momentarily. Some spring mechanism in the
 door prevents you from keeping it locked while the door is open,
 however.

 You're in a small gap between the cars. Small maintenance tunnels lead

 Junction Between Car 5 and 6
 Between each pair of cars is an area which has always frightened you.
 Maybe it's the fact that the area is open save for a flimsy metal
 railing across the gaps; maybe it's the constant shifting of the floor
 beneath your feet. Safer areas lie south and north.

 You see a concealed maintenance access hatch in the floor here.

 The door to car 6 slides shut.

 Mail Car
 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest
 of the train:  it's a mail transport car. Bags of letters and parcels
 fill the shelves around you, almost completely obscuring the one light
 fixture in the car. The sliding metal door east offers a possible
 exit.

 An open metal hatch reveals the sun and sky above.

 The beam of sunlight from the open metal hatch draws your eyes to a
 large wooden crate sitting at the north end of the car.

 You can also see a can of lubricant here.

 The rose-colored glass hampers your ability to make out details...

 A curious glass tube sticks out of a mass of electronics glued to the
 back of the box. Inside the tube you see a swirling gas. A thin gold
 wire spirals its way around the outside of the tube.

 A glass dish sits under a thick metal coil, which dangles from another
 breadboard packed with electronics.

 In the center of the bomb is a Plexiglas box.

 Sitting on a nest of electronics within the glass box is an ominous
 black sphere.

 Above the glass box is an antique pair of brass scales, curiously out
 of place when compared to the high-tech components around them. The
 metal dishes normally associated with such scales have been replaced
 by two labeled Pyrex beakers.

 Amazing! After all these years some girl finally got Jack to propose.
 All you need to do is hop on a commuter plane, get the big lug to the
 church on time, and zip back. Piece of cake...

 Well, almost.  Blasted El Ni?o has air traffic in an uproar. This
 daily commuter flight out of San Francisco was delayed three times,
 which will make life fun when you finally make it down to San Diego...

 Airplane (on Seat 4B)
 The airlines claim that planes are getting bigger, but you don't
 believe a word of it. This cramped cabin feels about as roomy as a
 culvert, and has approximately the same decor.

 There is a door south and a small kitchenette north.

 Mail Car
 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest
 of the train:  it's a mail transport car. Bags of letters and parcels
 fill the shelves around you, almost completely obscuring the one light
 fixture in the car. The sliding metal door east offers a possible
 exit.

 In front of you stands a large metal box, closed on all sides save the
 front, which is protected by a pane of glass. The rose-tinting of the
 glass hints at rather than exposes the complicated machinery held
 within.

 An open metal hatch reveals the sun and sky above.

 You can also see a can of lubricant here.

>look at bomb
 Even with the glass removed, it's still difficult to comprehend the
 box's contents all at once...

 A curious glass tube sticks out of a mass of electronics glued to the
 back of the box. Inside the tube you see a swirling gas. A thin gold
 wire spirals its way around the outside of the tube.

 A glass dish sits under a thick metal coil, which dangles from another
 breadboard packed with electronics.

 In the center of the bomb is a Plexiglas box.

 Sitting on a nest of electronics within the glass box is an ominous
 black sphere.

 Above the glass box is an antique pair of brass scales, curiously out
 of place when compared to the high-tech components around them. The
 metal dishes normally associated with such scales have been replaced
 by two labeled Pyrex beakers.

 The oil on the white powder evaporates away.

 Whumpf! The white powder suddenly bursts into flame!

>look at box
 (the metal box)
 Even with the glass removed, it's still difficult to comprehend the
 box's contents all at once...

 A curious glass tube sticks out of a mass of electronics glued to the
 back of the box. Inside the tube you see a swirling gas. A thin gold
 wire spirals its way around the outside of the tube.

 A glass dish sits under a thick metal coil, which dangles from another
 breadboard packed with electronics.

 In the center of the bomb is a Plexiglas box.

 Sitting on a nest of electronics within the glass box is an ominous
 black sphere.

 Above the glass box is an antique pair of brass scales, curiously out
 of place when compared to the high-tech components around them. The
 metal dishes normally associated with such scales have been replaced
 by two labeled Pyrex beakers.

 A curious glass tube sticks out of a mass of electronics glued to the

 wire spirals its way around the outside of the tube.

 In the center of the bomb is a Plexiglas box.

 Sitting on a nest of electronics within the glass box is an ominous
 black sphere.

 Above the glass box is an antique pair of brass scales, curiously out

 Mail Car
 Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest
 of the train:  it's a mail transport car. Bags of letters and parcels
 fill the shelves around you, almost completely obscuring the one light
 fixture in the car. The sliding metal door east offers a possible
 exit.

 The glass box has been opened, allowing access to the complicated
 machinery held within.

 A hatch in the roof of the car has been shut.

 You can also see a rose-colored glass pane here.

 The resulting fire must have set off some sensor in the bomb. The
 subsequent explosion vaporizes you, the train, and a large portion of
 California instantaneously.
