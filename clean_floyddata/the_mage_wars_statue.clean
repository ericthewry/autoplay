 "Daddy!"

 "Daddy!"

 You are accosted by two gleeful children as you walk into their dimly
 illuminated bedroom. They bound up in unison and leap on you from their
 respective beds. You first catch Kylina -- your six-year-old daughter
 -- then immediately pick your four-year-old son -- Mathen -- out of the
 air. Both children hug you tightly making you smile, comforted by this
 familiar nightly ritual. You squeeze both of them together in your
 arms, enjoying the sensation of your two children. You've always loved
 this moment -- the embrace before you put them to bed.

 Children's Bedroom
 A small bedroom with two beds, one for each of your children. The
 illumination spell, a common casting available these days in every home
 in Darisia, is set very low so as to facilitate their falling asleep.

>examine kylina
 Kylina, your six-year-old daughter, has your eyes and Cylest's long
 dark hair.

>examine me
 Starting to grey, but still in excellent health. If not for your fame,
 no one could possibly guess your real age.

>examine mathen
 Mathen, your four-year-old son, has short blonde hair. His smile is
 missing his two front teeth.

 Kylina kisses you on the cheek then smiles a contrived farce of a smile
 at her brother.

>hug kylina
 You pull your daughter close and give her a hug then kiss her on the
 forehead. She smiles and gives you a kiss on the nose.

 Mathen gives you a hug, squeezing tightly around your neck, and crosses
 his eyes at his sister.

>put children in bed.
 Kylina : You put Kylina on the bed.
 Mathen : You put Mathen on the bed.

 "Would you tell us a bedtime story, Daddy?" Kylina asks.

 "Yes! Tell us a story, Daddy! Please?" says Mathen, thinking this a
 good idea. By his enthusiasm, one would think that you hadn't told them
 a bedtime story last night, or the night before, or each and every
 night for the last several years.

 "Please, Daddy?" Kylina has no reservations about begging for bedtime
 stories.

 "Pleeeeeease?" they plead in unison.

 You laugh. "Okay, okay."

 "Yay!" They cheer, and the two children begin to jump on their beds in
 excitement, each bobbing up and down in alternating intervals.

 knowing the answer.

 together.

 You smile, and take in a long breath. "Let me see, where do I begin? Oh
 yes...

 "It had been three weeks since my spirit had died, three weeks since
 all the color had drained from the world, three weeks since..."

 "No. Don't start there!" Mathen interrupts. "Start before that, when
 Mommy was a little girl!"

 "That's not before, you dummy!" scorns his sister. "Mommy was after,
 while Daddy was sleeping!"

 "Nuh-uuuh!"

 "Yes she was!" Kylina glares at Mathen. Mathen retorts by sticking his
 tongue out at her.

 "It's okay," you say smoothly. "We can start with Mommy. Maybe the
 story goes better that way."

 Mathen smiles smugly at his sister, who decides to ignore him.

 You think for a moment about where to begin. "Okay," you start. "Mommy
 -- that is, 'Cylest' -- had wandered away from the others..."

                             (circa 9223)

 Cylest had wandered away from the others. The museum was amazing and
 she wanted to see all of it, but the statue -- THE statue, was too
 captivating. She had listened to the stories all of her life. It was
 the statue made by the ancients, the only remnant of a civilization
 before recorded history. None knew how the statue had been made or how
 the ancients had managed such realism. No one could even guess about
 what it was made from. The mages claimed that it was immune to most of
 their magiks and what little they could find out about it raised more
 questions than answers.

 Cylest had always been enraptured by the mystery surrounding the
 statue. Although most thought it to be simply a statue of amazing
 detail, many believed that it was once a real man. It was a commonly
 told children's story that the statue was truly a dark mage who slept
 until his chosen time to rise again and enslave the world. It was said
 he was a mage of powerful evil -- more evil even than Noric the Dark
 who had been exiled with great difficulty into the Thanatos desert for
 leading an insurrection against her father. But Cylest secretly
 believed the statue was an ancient hero, captured by an evil mage of
 great power and made to suffer for all eternity. The statue was the
 single interest that she could always remember having, so she had
 jumped at the chance to visit the museum where it was housed. After the
 museum guide had led her party by it, she had taken the first
 opportunity to sneak away and return.

 Now, as she stood knee-high before the statue of the ancients and
 stared up into its heart-wrenching expression, she was ensnared by the
 romance of it all. The tall, mysterious, ancient man -- unloved,
 rejected, and distraught by loneliness -- stood waiting only for
 someone to love him. Yes, she thought as she peered into his sad,
 distant eyes. I do love him. And she always had, for the entire seven
 years of her life. He needed her love and she could not deny him of it.
 The grownups would not understand, but it didn't matter. She would
 prove her love...

 Museum, Statue Exhibit (in the glass case)

 From within the case, sharing space with the statue, Cylest felt like
 an artifact herself, looking out into the empty museum.

>examine statue
 The statue was of a tall, handsome man, brimming with mystery and
 otherworldliness. The man held a strange box in his left hand, his
 thumb pressed against it purposefully. An ancient coat covered the
 man's torso and extended down to his knees. A small aperture in the
 coat, just within Cylest's reach, was visible.

>inventory
 Cylest was carrying:
   a promise pin (providing light)

>talk to statue
 [You can only do that to something animate.]

>examine aperture
 She looked closely at the small aperture in the statue, a gap in its
 strange ancient garb. It was a pocket. A perfect place to put the
 symbol of her love!

>examine pin
 Cylest opened her fist and looked down at her promise pin. The pin,
 adorned with a glowing crystal, was symbolic of eons of Darisian
 tradition and her father would be livid when he found that she had
 taken it. It was to be given to her betrothed when she was old enough
 to make the decision. Well, she was old enough. She was seven years old
 -- almost eight -- and certainly old enough to love. After all, she
 loved this statue and the mysterious man that it represented. And the
 statue -- she was sure -- returned her love.

>look in pocket
 Cylest jumped several times, bobbing up and down just enough to see
 into the pocket. It was dark, but appeared to be empty. Not for long,
 Cylest told herself.

>enter pocket
 The pocket was not something Cylest could enter.

>put pin in pocket
 Cylest reached up above her head and dropped the pin into the open
 pocket. There was a metallic tinkle as the pin slipped down the gap in
 the stone. She was certain that the statue would awaken for her now. It
 would come to life since she had proven her love for it. The ancient
 man would embrace her and sweep her away from her terrible life. Any
 moment he would open his lips and speak...

 "Cylest!" cried a stern voice from behind, making her jump. "What are
 you doing in there?" She turned to see her father's aide staring at her
 from outside the glass casing. "Those display cases are meant to keep
 people from touching the artifacts! Get out of there, now!" he
 commanded. "That is no way for a princess to behave!"

 Princess Cylest nodded at his reprimand, and silently followed him as
 he led her back to the group, relieved that he had not seen what she
 had done with her pin.

                             (circa 1997)

 It had been three weeks since my spirit had died, three weeks since all
 the color had drained from the world, three weeks since the horror had
 visited and marred me forever. I had knelt amidst the wreckage of glass
 and metal. I had held Karen's limp form upon my lap. I had closed her
 unseeing eyes. It had been three weeks since my reason to live had left
 this world and I had kissed my wife's cold, bloodied lips goodbye.

 The loss was unbearable, the pain beyond measure. I had emerged
 dreadfully intact from the wreckage that had once been my automobile. I
 was unforgivably unscathed. To those around me, I seemed healthy and
 vibrant. Yet I was but a shell; dead in all ways that mattered.

 From my reflection, only an obscenity glared back. The perversity of it
 all taunted me. Not a scratch upon the killer who drove his love to her
 death. Not a bruise for the driver whose very reason to live was
 crushed in his passenger seat.

 And so it was that three weeks -- or minutes, or decades -- after the
 accident, I included myself in the secret. As I stared at my reflection
 in the coffee pot, I let myself in on the plan. As I did, I knew at
 once that I had made the decision weeks ago -- in the midst of the
 wreckage -- and kept it secret even from myself.

 Teresa had said that it was too soon for me to return to work, but I
 had dismissed her concerns. I needed to immerse myself, I had said. But
 it was a lie, and Malcolm had known. He watched me closely,
 scrutinizing my actions. He was as suspicious as any partner and friend
 of twenty years would be. But today was the meeting, and he could not
 be in two places at once.

 Today would be the day that I would realize my plan and put an end to
 this lifelessness...

 Coffee Nook
 The coffee nook was nothing more than a recessed counter top with a
 sink, providing easy access from the Northern boardroom. The office
 coffeemaker rested on the counter.

 In the empty coffeepot, which I still held, my refracted reflection
 returned my gaze, reminding me of the perversity of my existence.

>inventory
 I was carrying:
   a white lab coat (being worn)
   a coffeepot
   a coffee mug
     some coffee

>drink coffee
 I downed the coffee. It was not entirely pleasant having the
 after-taste that coffee has after it has sat too long after brewing.
 Still, it was remarkably warm and fresh for a cup of coffee that was
 possibly ten-thousand years old.

 The meeting was progressing in the boardroom to the North. Malcolm was
 showing the two investors one of the petra-eikons.

>what is petra-eikons
 [That's not a verb I recognize.]

>fill mug

>put pot on coffeemaker
 I returned the coffeepot to its place in the coffeemaker.

>drink coffee
 I did not see anything like that.

>inventory
 I was carrying:
   a white lab coat (being worn)
   a coffee mug

 "As soon as Dr. Philbrook rejoins us," Malcolm was saying, "I can give
 you a demonstration of the device. I think you will be quite
 impressed."

>examine coat
 White and long, the coat came down to my knees. It had a single pocket
 at the bottom which I seldom used.

>look

 Coffee Nook
 The coffee nook was nothing more than a recessed counter top with a
 sink, providing easy access from the Northern boardroom. The office
 coffeemaker rested on the counter, cradling the coffeepot.

 From the boardroom I could hear one of the two investors ask a
 question. Malcolm murmured a vague reply, and cleared his throat in a
 private, unspoken inquiry as to my well-being.

>put mug on counter
 I put the coffee mug on the counter.

 "The Petrian device is really something of a..." I could hear Malcolm
 beginning one of his sales pitches. They weren't too bad, but they
 weren't what investors wanted to hear. It was apparent that he was
 stalling until I came back before delving into the details.

>go north

 Boardroom
 The boardroom was elegant and lavish. The East wall was comprised of
 windows framing a scenic view of the cityscape. Light shined through,
 distilled by tinting, and illuminated the room's centerpiece, a large
 marble table. A windowed wall and door exhibited the hall to the West.
 To the South was a small coffee bar.

 Two investors sat at one end of the table, their backs to the windowed
 door and hall.

 On the marble table was a cage (which was closed).

 Malcolm, dressed in the sleek office attire he wore on such occasions,
 sat at the head of the table; a deep concern for me shown on his face.

 "It is real?" asked one of the two men. He was holding the life-sized
 statuette of a turtle in his hands. The other man looked at it over his
 shoulder. Both seemed to be scrutinizing it for some flaw.

 "Yes," responded Malcolm with a chuckle. "It is as real as this one."
 Malcolm pulled the cloth from the cage, revealing the kitten within. It
 had been sleeping, but awoke at the light. The kitten began to mew as
 Malcolm opened the cage and reached for it.

>examine kitten
 The fluffy white kitten mewed happily.

 Both men's eyes widened as Malcolm attached the Petrian device's
 electrode to the purring kitten's paw. It began to lick his right hand
 and he stroked the kitten playfully. In his left hand, he held the
 Petrian device.

 "Will it hurt?" the first man asked with a mixed expression of horror
 and fascination.

 "Not at all," replied Malcolm smiling. "The effect is instantaneous.
 The kitten will experience no sensation and will be unaware even of the
 passage of time."

 "How much time?" asked the second man.

 "Whatever we choose," replied Malcolm. "For this example, I've set the
 device for thirty days. I could just as easily have set it for thirty
 millennia."

>examine device
 It was partially obscured as Malcolm held it, but I had seen it many
 times. I did, after all, help invent it. There was one more, partially
 damaged but still functioning in the testing lab. I had plans for that
 one. It was small, about the size and shape of a portable stereo.

 Malcolm moved his hand from the kitten to the Petrian device. The
 kitten jumped playfully and tried to pursue his hand.

 Then Malcolm pushed the button and the kitten froze, turning instantly
 to a colorless grey stone material. It fell off the table, having been
 frozen in mid leap, and made a loud noise as it hit the floor. The two
 men gasped at the fallen kitten, paying no attention to the electrode
 which automatically retracted to the device.

 Malcolm reached down and picked the newly created statuette up from the
 floor and set it on the table. "If you have any questions," said
 Malcolm with a smug smile. "Dr. Philbrook and I will try to answer them
 as best we can."

 For a moment, both men were speechless. They looked at the stoned
 kitten -- a newly created eikon -- with obvious wonder. It was always
 the same with these investors. This was the calm before the storm of
 questions.

>examine kitten
 The kitten, neither fluffy nor white any longer appeared to be a small
 statue chiseled out of stone, a petra-eikon.

 "Can you bring the kitten out of this stoned state early?" one of the
 investors asked Malcolm.

 He shook his head. "Once the Petrian energy imbues the subject, it
 dissipates at a constant rate. We've had no success at either speeding
 up or prolonging its effect."

 As he spoke these words I realized that they weren't entirely true, but
 he didn't know yet. I had meant to tell him when I first made the
 breakthrough... but that had been just three weeks ago. All meaning in
 my life had been taken from me the very next day.

>examine investors
 Wearing almost identical black suits, the men were as two peas in a
 pod. I had participated in dozens of meetings exactly like this, and
 the investors were always the same. Karen and I used to joke that there
 was a cloning laboratory somewhere from which all investors came. I
 smiled at the fond memory of us joking, then winced at the pain of the
 realization that there would be no more of that happiness.

 "And prolonging? What about trying to stone a statue that's already
 stoned?" The man looked at Malcolm, a curious expression on his face.

 "No," He answered. "In the Petrian state, the subject no longer
 exhibits any of the qualities of organic matter and the process only
 affects the living."

>ask inventors about petrian state
 (Asking investors)
 "I don't know anything about that," The investors said.

 One of the men looked at me with a quizzical expression. "It only
 affects living matter?"

 Suddenly the ache in my heart was too extreme. I could not endure this
 meaningless drivel which was once so important to me. An urgent desire
 to leave came over me.

 "If you will excuse me," I announced to the room. "I have something
 that I must attend to." Malcolm looked at me, understanding the excuse;
 pity showed plainly upon his face. I felt a passing twinge of guilt for
 abandoning him in a meeting of this importance, but apathy overwhelmed
 it.

 For a dizzy moment my vision blurred and I saw Karen's lifeless face
 staring into nothingness. I scrunched my eyes closed, prepared to wait
 until the vision passed, but it never did and I was forced to open them
 again and wipe the tears from my cheeks. "Excuse me," I repeated, not
 knowing what else to say. The two investors looked at me strangely;
 Malcolm smiled sympathetically and nodded, telling me without words
 that he could handle the investors. He turned his attention back to
 them.

 "Yes," Malcolm replied. "And a very small amount of inorganic matter in
 close proximity to the subject."

 The man thought about this silently, obviously not convinced.

 "What happens if you break the statue?" one of the men asked.

 "We know of nothing that can damage an eikon," Malcolm said. "The
 Petrias energy affects the subject on an atomic level, filling the
 space between the atoms themselves. Our testing indicates that these
 stoned statues, or petra-eikons, could easily survive unscathed upon
 the surface of the sun."

 distant eyes. I do love him. And she always had, for the entire seven
 years of her life. He needed her love and she could not deny him of it.
 The grownups would not understand, but it didn't matter. She would
 prove her love...

 Museum, Statue Exhibit (in the glass case)

 From within the case, sharing space with the statue, Cylest felt like
 an artifact herself, looking out into the empty museum.

>examine statue
 The statue was of a tall, handsome man, brimming with mystery and
 otherworldliness. The man held a strange box in his left hand, his
 thumb pressed against it purposefully. An ancient coat covered the
 man's torso and extended down to his knees. A small aperture in the
 coat, just within Cylest's reach, was visible.

>inventory
 Cylest was carrying:
   a promise pin (providing light)

>put pin in pocket
 Cylest reached up above her head and dropped the pin into the open
 pocket. There was a metallic tinkle as the pin slipped down the gap in
 the stone. She was certain that the statue would awaken for her now. It
 would come to life since she had proven her love for it. The ancient
 man would embrace her and sweep her away from her terrible life. Any
 moment he would open his lips and speak...

 "Cylest!" cried a stern voice from behind, making her jump. "What are
 you doing in there?" She turned to see her father's aide staring at her
 from outside the glass casing. "Those display cases are meant to keep
 people from touching the artifacts! Get out of there, now!" he
 commanded. "That is no way for a princess to behave!"

 Princess Cylest nodded at his reprimand, and silently followed him as
 he led her back to the group, relieved that he had not seen what she
 had done with her pin.

                           C H A P T E R . I
                             (circa 1997)

 It had been three weeks since my spirit had died, three weeks since all
 the color had drained from the world, three weeks since the horror had
 visited and marred me forever. I had knelt amidst the wreckage of glass
 and metal. I had held Karen's limp form upon my lap. I had closed her
 unseeing eyes. It had been three weeks since my reason to live had left
 this world and I had kissed my wife's cold, bloodied lips goodbye.

 The loss was unbearable, the pain beyond measure. I had emerged
 dreadfully intact from the wreckage that had once been my automobile. I
 was unforgivably unscathed. To those around me, I seemed healthy and
 vibrant. Yet I was but a shell; dead in all ways that mattered.

 From my reflection, only an obscenity glared back. The perversity of it
 all taunted me. Not a scratch upon the killer who drove his love to her
 death. Not a bruise for the driver whose very reason to live was
 crushed in his passenger seat.

 And so it was that three weeks -- or minutes, or decades -- after the
 accident, I included myself in the secret. As I stared at my reflection
 in the coffee pot, I let myself in on the plan. As I did, I knew at
 once that I had made the decision weeks ago -- in the midst of the
 wreckage -- and kept it secret even from myself.

 Teresa had said that it was too soon for me to return to work, but I
 had dismissed her concerns. I needed to immerse myself, I had said. But
 it was a lie, and Malcolm had known. He watched me closely,
 scrutinizing my actions. He was as suspicious as any partner and friend
 of twenty years would be. But today was the meeting, and he could not
 be in two places at once.

 Today would be the day that I would realize my plan and put an end to
 this lifelessness...

 Coffee Nook
 The coffee nook was nothing more than a recessed counter top with a
 sink, providing easy access from the Northern boardroom. The office
 coffeemaker rested on the counter.

 In the empty coffeepot, which I still held, my refracted reflection
 returned my gaze, reminding me of the perversity of my existence.

>drink coffee
 I downed the coffee. It was not entirely pleasant having the
 after-taste that coffee has after it has sat too long after brewing.
 Still, it was remarkably warm and fresh for a cup of coffee that was
 possibly ten-thousand years old.

>put pot on maker
 I returned the coffeepot to its place in the coffeemaker.

>go north

 Boardroom
 The boardroom was elegant and lavish. The East wall was comprised of
 windows framing a scenic view of the cityscape. Light shined through,
 distilled by tinting, and illuminated the room's centerpiece, a large
 marble table. A windowed wall and door exhibited the hall to the West.
 To the South was a small coffee bar.

 Two investors sat at one end of the table, their backs to the windowed
 door and hall.

 On the marble table was a cage (which was closed).

 Malcolm, dressed in the sleek office attire he wore on such occasions,
 sat at the head of the table; a deep concern for me shown on his face.

 "It is real?" asked one of the two men. He was holding the life-sized
 statuette of a turtle in his hands. The other man looked at it over his
 shoulder. Both seemed to be scrutinizing it for some flaw.

 "Yes," responded Malcolm with a chuckle. "It is as real as this one."
 Malcolm pulled the cloth from the cage, revealing the kitten within. It
 had been sleeping, but awoke at the light. The kitten began to mew as
 Malcolm opened the cage and reached for it.

 Enter saved game to store: [Ok.]

>examine kitten
 The fluffy white kitten mewed happily.

 Both men's eyes widened as Malcolm attached the Petrian device's
 electrode to the purring kitten's paw. It began to lick his right hand
 and he stroked the kitten playfully. In his left hand, he held the
 Petrian device.

 "Will it hurt?" the first man asked with a mixed expression of horror
 and fascination.

 "Not at all," replied Malcolm smiling. "The effect is instantaneous.
 The kitten will experience no sensation and will be unaware even of the
 passage of time."

 "How much time?" asked the second man.

 "Whatever we choose," replied Malcolm. "For this example, I've set the
 device for thirty days. I could just as easily have set it for thirty
 millennia."

>examine device
 It was partially obscured as Malcolm held it, but I had seen it many
 times. I did, after all, help invent it. There was one more, partially
 damaged but still functioning in the testing lab. I had plans for that
 one. It was small, about the size and shape of a portable stereo.

 Malcolm moved his hand from the kitten to the Petrian device. The
 kitten jumped playfully and tried to pursue his hand.

 Then Malcolm pushed the button and the kitten froze, turning instantly
 to a colorless grey stone material. It fell off the table, having been
 frozen in mid leap, and made a loud noise as it hit the floor. The two
 men gasped at the fallen kitten, paying no attention to the electrode
 which automatically retracted to the device.

 Malcolm reached down and picked the newly created statuette up from the
 floor and set it on the table. "If you have any questions," said
 Malcolm with a smug smile. "Dr. Philbrook and I will try to answer them
 as best we can."

 For a moment, both men were speechless. They looked at the stoned
 kitten -- a newly created eikon -- with obvious wonder. It was always
 the same with these investors. This was the calm before the storm of
 questions.

>tell investors about kitten
 That did not seem to be an appropriate topic for the given context.

 "Can you bring the kitten out of this stoned state early?" one of the
 investors asked Malcolm.

 He shook his head. "Once the Petrian energy imbues the subject, it
 dissipates at a constant rate. We've had no success at either speeding
 up or prolonging its effect."

 As he spoke these words I realized that they weren't entirely true, but
 he didn't know yet. I had meant to tell him when I first made the
 breakthrough... but that had been just three weeks ago. All meaning in
 my life had been taken from me the very next day.

>tell investors about device
 That did not seem to be an appropriate topic for the given context.

 "And prolonging? What about trying to stone a statue that's already
 stoned?" The man looked at me, a curious expression on his face.

>answer the investors
 (to Malcolm)
 There was no reply.

 "No," Malcolm answered. "In the Petrian state, the subject no longer
 exhibits any of the qualities of organic matter and the process only
 affects the living."

 One of the men looked at Malcolm with a quizzical expression. "It only
 affects living matter?"

 "Yes," he replied. "And a very small amount of inorganic matter in
 close proximity to the subject."

 The man thought about this silently, obviously not convinced.

 Suddenly the ache in my heart was too extreme. I could not endure this
 meaningless drivel which was once so important to me. An urgent desire
 to leave came over me.

>leave
 [You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.]

 "What happens if you break the statue?" one of the men asked.

       I believe I have discovered a way to revive... [Malcolm]
                We know of no way to damage an eikon...

 "If you will excuse me," I announced to the room. "I have something
 that I must attend to." Malcolm looked at me, understanding the excuse;
 pity showed plainly upon his face. I felt a passing twinge of guilt for
 abandoning him in a meeting of this importance, but apathy overwhelmed
 it.

 For a dizzy moment my vision blurred and I saw Karen's lifeless face
 staring into nothingness. I scrunched my eyes closed, prepared to wait
 until the vision passed, but it never did and I was forced to open them
 again and wipe the tears from my cheeks. "Excuse me," I repeated, not
 knowing what else to say. The two investors looked at me strangely;
 Malcolm smiled sympathetically and nodded, telling me without words
 that he could handle the investors. He turned his attention back to
 them.

 "We know of nothing that can damage an eikon," Malcolm said. "The
 Petrias energy affects the subject on an atomic level, filling the
 space between the atoms themselves. Our testing indicates that these
 stoned statues, or petra-eikons, could easily survive unscathed upon
 the surface of the sun."

 "It could survive the surface of a star?" asked the other investor.
 "You could leverage this technology to build spacecraft out of cheap,
 flexible material such as plastic, then?"

 Malcolm shook his head. "The Petrias energy only affects living
 matter."

 "Oh yes," the man said. "You said that."

>go west
 (first opening the hall door)

 Hall
 It was a short hallway connecting three doors to the open Southern
 lobby. To the East was a glass wall and door dividing the hall from the
 boardroom. The mahogany door of Malcolm's office lay closed to the
 West. The door to the North led to the development lab where we
 performed all research on the Petrian device. On the wall, mounted next
 to the door was a security scanner.

>show badge to scanner
 I could not see any such thing.

 Malcolm's office
 Malcolm's office was clean and well organized, much as the man himself.
 His desk, a polished cherry wood, commanded all attention.

 On the cherry desk was a mailing package (which was empty).

 Malcolm's office
 Malcolm's office was clean and well organized, much as the man himself.
 His desk, a polished cherry wood, commanded all attention.

 On the cherry desk was a mailing package (which was empty).

 The door to Malcolm's office, like the door to my office, was made of
 solid, rose stained mahogany. Intricate designs were etched into the
 wood in various places adding a touch of elegance. Karen had picked out
 the two doors when we had first opened the office.

>examine designs
 They were small elaborate designs etched into the door, of no real
 significance.

 I closed Malcolm's office door.

 [The Mage Wars: Statue is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives
 long descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).]

>open lab door
 There was no handle on this side of the door so it could not be opened
 in the conventional manner. Having been through it a thousand times, I
 knew that the door would open automatically when I slid my ID badge
 through the mounted security scanner.

>examine badge
 I did not see anything like that.

 Just a single pocket, sewn into the lab coat.

 Lobby
 The lobby was a clean, almost sterile room that greeted people when
 they stepped off of the elevator. It hosted a large, wooden desk behind
 which sat our receptionist Teresa, who greeted everyone with a pleasant
 smile. There was a small slot which opened to the mail chute located
 conspicuously against the South wall. My office door lay to the West,
 the rest of the office resided down the short hallway to the North.

 Teresa ruffled through the papers on her desk, performing her duties in
 a neat and efficient manner.

 "Hello, Doctor Philbrook," greeted Teresa. She smiled brightly, but it
 was an artificial smile. I could see the concern reflected in her eyes,
 a concern reflected in the eyes of everyone I worked with.

 I knew I should be appreciative for their concern and that it was
 rooted in caring, but I despised it. I grew weary of their sympathy for
 a pain that would never heal, and tired of people tiptoeing around me.

 It will soon be over, I thought.

 The only exits lay north and west.
 "Is everything going all right with the meeting?" she asked.

 I nodded, putting on a good face as I forced myself through this
 excruciating exchange of small talk.

 "I've left something in my office which I need to get. Malcolm can
 handle the investors for awhile." It was a lie, but sounded better
 than: "I'm going to my office to cry and stare out the window in
 misery. Malcolm can handle the investors for awhile."

 "Yes sir," Teresa said, seeming satisfied, at lEast for the time being,
 with some personal assessment of my well-being. She turned her
 attention to the papers on her desk.

 (first opening my office door)

 My Office
 Karen had been gifted at interior decorating and she had put a great
 deal of effort into my office. The room was exquisite; the view of the
 city from my window was breathtaking. Everything in the room had been
 hand-picked for its elegance, from the gorgeous mahogany desk to the
 cherry wood Venetian blinds. What had once filled me with pride was now
 an excruciating reminder of my lost love. Everything in this room we
 had picked together, Karen and I.

 There, in my home away from home, I sank deeper into the depths of
 despair.

 On the mahogany desk were a stone rabbit statuette and a picture frame.

>cry
 [That's not a verb I recognize.]

>examine statuette
 It was one of my most prized, yet gruesome, statuettes. The rabbit had
 been the prey of some small predator. It had been partially mauled and
 its side slashed open by the attacking animal's talons. I had stumbled
 upon the scene at the last possible moment and the attacker had fled,
 too late to save the rabbit. Fear showing in its eyes, its entrails
 exposed, the rabbit had been eikonized the instant before death.

 Tears filled my eyes as I looked at the frightened rabbit that stared
 forever into Death's face. I cried for my rabbit that had been mauled
 and taken from me in my passenger seat.

 Karen! Open your eyes! Karen! Please wake up! Stay with me, sweetheart!
 Karen...

 For a time, I was overcome with remorse.

>examine frame
 It was a picture of me and Karen during our vacation to Cancun the
 previous summer.

 We had solicited a stranger to take our picture for us and had been
 unable to contain our laughter long enough for the solemn poses we had
 tried for. Karen, joy blazing from her beautiful face, clasped her arms
 tightly around my waist. A snapshot of my loss which now twisted my
 innards and wrenched from me any pretense of healing.

 Almost, I could hear her laughter. Tears flowed freely down my cheeks.

>examine desk
 It was an elegant desk of polished mahogany which I had made efforts to
 keep clutter free. It framed a single drawer.

 On the mahogany desk I could see a stone rabbit statuette and a picture
 frame.

>open drawer
 I opened the drawer, revealing my ID badge.

>open drawer

 they stepped off of the elevator. It hosted a large, wooden desk behind
 which sat our receptionist Teresa, who greeted everyone with a pleasant
 smile. There was a small slot which opened to the mail chute located
 conspicuously against the South wall. My office door lay to the West,
 the rest of the office resided down the short hallway to the North.

 Teresa ruffled through the papers on her desk, performing her duties in
 a neat and efficient manner.

>go north
 I stepped into the hall, facing the lab door. Out of the corner of my
 eye, through the window, I could see into the conference room. Malcolm
 was trying futilely to put the design principles behind the Petrian
 Device into layman's terms for the investors. He took notice of me with
 a quizzical expression on his face, but seemed to have his hands full
 answering questions. In a few moments, when he realized my intent, he
 would do anything to stop me.

 Hall
 It was a short hallway connecting three doors to the open Southern
 lobby. To the East was a glass wall and door dividing the hall from the
 boardroom. The mahogany door of Malcolm's office lay closed to the
 West. The door to the North led to the development lab where we
 performed all research on the Petrian device. On the wall, mounted next
 to the door was a security scanner.

>show badge to scanner

>go north
 (first opening the monitoring lab door)
 There was no handle on this side of the door so it could not be opened

 knew that the door would open automatically when I slid my ID badge
 through the mounted security scanner.

>slide badge through scanner
 I slid the card over the scanner.

 "Authorization granted," chimed a melodic female voice. There was a
 brief beep and the monitoring lab door opened.

 Malcolm visibly started as he heard my badge run through the scanner.
 He stopped talking in mid-sentence and turned to face me through the
 window. Both men turned too, to see what he was looking at. I had to
 act, I knew. There would be no second chance now.

 Monitoring Lab
 The monitoring lab consisted of an instrument console and a large
 window into the testing lab. It was from there that all tests of the
 Petrian device were observed. The door to the testing lab lay North.
 Next to it, mounted on the wall was a security scanner, exactly like
 the one in the hall. The lab exit, leading to the hall, lay to the
 South.

 The hall door swung closed with a click.

>slide badge through scanner
 I slid the card over the scanner.

 "Authorization granted," chimed a melodic female voice. There was a
 brief beep and the testing lab door opened.

>look through window
 The glass exposed rooms in two directions: The testing lab to the
 North, and the hall to the South.

 The testing lab door swung closed with a click.

>undo
 Monitoring Lab
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go north

 Testing Lab
 White and clean, the testing lab was where all real testing was done on
 the Petrian device. Calibration, adjustments, repairs -- it was all
 done in this lab where every detail could be observed through the
 window from the monitoring lab to the South. Even the exit -- also on
 the Southern wall -- had a glass window. A workbench was centered
 neatly in the room.

 On the workbench was a Petrian device.

 Through the window, I could see into the monitoring lab. Beyond that,
 visible through the door window, was Malcolm in the hall. He pressed up
 against the glass and peered in, obviously panicked. Our eyes met and
 he yelled something to me. I couldn't hear him through the lab's sound
 proofing, but I didn't need to. We knew each other too well. He knew
 what I was up to, I knew how he felt about it.

 The monitoring lab door swung closed with a click.

>examine device
 One of only two prototypes, this Petrian device was damaged. The other,
 which Malcolm had been demonstrating to the potential investors, was
 the only one that worked completely. This one would do everything that
 I needed it to, though. It was small, hand-sized, and if not
 scrutinized, it could easily have been mistaken for a portable stereo.
 What looked like a single headphone was actually an electrode which
 retracted automatically into the device when not being used. There was
 a dial, broken and spinning freely. There was also a small, red button
 used to initiate the process.

 Past the monitoring lab and into the hall, I could see Malcolm swipe
 his badge. The hall door opened giving him access to the monitoring
 lab. I needed to act. Malcolm would already have stopped me save for
 the single glass door that stood between us.

>push button
 I tried to push the button to no avail. Because of the curvature of its
 casing, the Petrian device kept tilting preventing me from making an
 adequate press. I would need to be holding the device to push the
 button.

 Malcolm rushed into the neighboring monitoring lab, followed by Teresa.
 The look of worry, showing plainly on their faces.

>get it
 The red button was hardly portable.

 Malcolm knew what I had in mind. He shook his head vigorously at me,
 and screamed silently for me to stop.

 Teresa reached the console and turned on the audio system. "Marc! Don't
 do this!" she pleaded. "I know this has been horrible for you, but what
 you are trying do... this is not the way!"

 I gazed without reaction at the red button on the Petrian device. It
 was as red as my beautiful wife's blood upon my shirt as she died in my
 arms that wretched night.

>get device
 Taken.

 Malcolm was fumbling with his badge and the scanner on the outside of
 the test lab. I had only a moment to act before it was too late.

>push button
 I pushed the button, testing the devices usability. It made a short
 low-pitched buzzing sound. Nothing else happened of course. The
 electrode would need to be attached to a suitable subject for the
 device to actually function. We had designed it that way.

>attach electrode to me
 I attached the electrode to myself, making sure that it was affixed
 tightly.

 There was a brief click from the door as Malcolm passed his badge
 across the scanning device. The security lock released and the door
 opened. "Authorization granted," spoke the door.

>push button
 I positioned my thumb against the blinking red button and looked at
 Malcolm. We faced each other, separated by the panes of glass. He had
 been my business partner and friend for two decades and he knew me
 better than anyone left alive.

 I smiled at him and let the unspoken words say everything I couldn't. I
 would miss him, but there was nothing left in this world for me. I told
 him so with a shrug. Malcolm nodded in response, a look of sad
 resignation on his face as he realized he was too late to stop me.

 And with that last farewell, I pressed the button.








 I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting to happen, but for some
 reason the lights going out took me by surprise. At first I thought it
 to be a quirk, a misalignment in the Petrian device that affected the
 building's electrical systems. Then came the frightened -- almost
 shrieking -- voice.

 I knew at once that it was not Malcolm.

 "Ezechrial!" The voice seemed to originate from just inches before my
 face. I blinked for a moment, letting my eyes adjust to the darkness
 before I could make out the teenaged boy, standing too close to me.

 "Morchulius nor! Morchulius nor!" A look of panic in his eyes, the boy
 leapt back, away from me. There was a crash then, followed by falling
 shards of glass, as the glass case -- apparently in which I had been
 standing -- rained down upon me. I covered my eyes, dimly aware of the
 electrode automatically rewinding itself.








 The gruesome package had been a heavy burden as Puck lugged it down the
 long, steep staircase. He paused at the bottom to catch his breath and
 admired the vast, mirrored hallway which stretched before him. At the
 other end of the hall, he could just see the silver door, made small
 from this distance. On the other side of that door the master waited
 for him, waited for the grisly delivery that Puck carried over his
 hunched shoulders and balanced on his twisted spine.

 Puck was jittery with anticipation. He had served the lord faithfully
 for decades. He had given himself over entirely to the labor despite
 his malformations and the additional deformities he incurred. Almost
 since the beginning -- since the exile from Darisia -- Puck had served
 him. Now it would pay off. The master had noticed him.

 Puck had been summoned specifically for this task. His reward awaited
 just down the hall.

 Mirrored Hall, Bottom of Stairs
 Puck stood at the foot of the tall staircase which spiraled up to the
 palace proper. This was the South end of a long, mirrored hall. To the
 North lay the door to the master's inner sanctum, reflected without
 end.

 Puck admired the single file line of clones which stretched to infinity
 in the opposing mirrored walls. Each malformed doppelganger, hunched
 over, bore a weighted bag upon his shoulders.

>examine clones
 The opposing mirrors were clean and glassy, but tinted so as to reflect
 a gloomy reality.  Puck's endless line of reflections faded to darkness
 as they stretched into infinity.

>examine bag
 Gray and well-used, the rough bag was marred with grisly stains; its
 seams pulled tightly around its ghastly contents.

>go north

 Mirrored Hall
 It was the North end of the mirrored hall. Far to the South, a
 strangely unbalanced distance away, loomed a line of countless towering
 spiral staircase. Immediately to the North was the imposing silver door
 to the master's inner chamber.

>examine door
 Large and imposing, the door was brushed silver, textured in a manner
 which repressed reflection.

>knock on door
 The door was opened by a large guard. Puck recognized him from the
 common grounds. Siedmeur was his name. He looked down at Puck and
 opened the door wider, motioning for him to enter.

>go north
 The guard closed the door and Puck's eyes adjusted to the darkness of
 the inner chamber. On the far side of the room, covered in robes, sat
 the master! Although he knelt upon a dark pallet and faced away, Puck
 immediately diverted his eyes. Puck was not worthy to look even upon
 the master's back.

 Then came the soft, gentle words: "Good evening, Puck." Puck's heart
 leapt. The master knew him by name! He could not believe his ears.
 "Please be so kind as to remove Mage Limech from the bag he currently
 rests in and place him upon the altar." For a moment Puck almost forgot
 what he had been carrying.

 Altar Room
 It was a dark room covered in dark drapes. The pungent stench of decay
 was overwhelming. It wafted throughout the room with an almost tangible
 presence, like a wraith of Death. Distant murmuring drifted in from
 beyond the drapes, a rhythmic whisper of anguish. Centered in the
 chamber was a large stone altar set only a few feet off the floor. A
 dull silver door lay to the South.

 Siedmeur, part of the master's elite guard, stood at attention next to
 the Southern door, watching silently.

 The dark master was there, only partly discernable from the shadows.

>open bag
 Puck opened the bag revealing the dead traitor, the mole. Limech had
 been one of the mages that had served the master. At lEast he had
 pretended to. But the master had known him for what he was. Limech had
 been a spy for Darisia, a spy for the jealous mages that had exiled the
 master. So Limech had earned his own death. And those that received his
 reports had finally received his severed heart as a reminder of who
 they dealt with.

 But that had been weeks ago, and Limech's corpse was badly decomposing.
 Why did the master again desire the dead mage? Why was Puck to deliver
 the heartless carcass of a dead spy to the master? Puck did not know.
 Perhaps it had something to do with the rumors of the supreme one's new
 work. Perhaps the master would find it in his heart to show him, Puck,
 what the entire kingdom wondered about.

>put corpse on alter
 Puck could not see any such thing.

>o altar
 [Think nothing of it.]

>put corpse on altar
 He needed to be holding the mage's corpse before he could put it on top
 of something else.

>take corpse
 Puck struggled for a moment, pulling the rotting carcass from the bag.
 Limech's head flopped limply to the side, his mouth open. Puck held him
 in both arms, letting the bag fall to the floor. The pungency of death
 was about.

 The master spoke again, annoyance resonating in his voice. "If it is
 not too much of an inconvenience for you, please put the body on the
 altar." His gentle words were a mockery, spoken in the most menacing of
 tones.

>put body on altar
 Puck laid the long dead mage upon the altar. Limech's joints popped and
 cracked gruesomely with the action. His chest, visible now, had been
 ripped open, his heart cut out; a chilling reminder of his gory demise.

 It was only for a moment that Puck was lost in the horror of it. For
 just an instant he stared at the macabre delivery, then he again heard
 the master's voice: "Levios!" Puck was startled by the proximity. The
 master had moved quietly to the altar and stood next to him. Puck tried
 to step back and give the master space to do his work, but found that
 his feet no longer touched the floor. He was floating! Panicked, Puck
 flailed his arms around him. "Strictum," the master said, and Puck's
 arms snapped to his sides.

>ms
 [There are no conversation topics currently in the menu system.]

>look
 Puck was paralyzed and floating in mid-air. He was unable to do
 anything.


 From his black robes, the master pulled out a long silver blade. It was
 a sacrificial dagger. "It seems," he spoke in a ghastly tranquil tone,
 "that I have misjudged the importance of the heart. I have need of a
 replacement."

 "But my Lord," the ensnared Puck murmured. "I have sacrificed
 everything for you."

 The dark mage nodded grimly. "And so you have earned release from your
 suffering existence."

 And with that, the master casually thrust the blade into Puck's chest.
 A gurgling cry escaped Puck's lips as he died.








 Siedmeur tried to stare at nothing and let his eyes lapse out of focus,
 but it didn't help. His peripheral vision was too keen and his eyes too
 well adapted to the darkness. He had no choice but to observe with
 complete awareness as the master cut the heart from the deformed little
 man's floating cadaver. The guard swore that he would never get used to
 this no matter how many times he had to witness it.

>SAVE
>cf4
 Enter saved game to store: [Ok.]

>examine master
 No, he would not dare to gaze directly upon the master. It was best to
 keep his eyes averted.

 Although he avoided direct eye contact with the master, Siedmeur was
 nevertheless aware of what Noric was doing. He was aware of the organic
 sucking sound as Noric pulled the heart from the little man's chest. He
 was aware of the master turning his knife on the aged cadaver on the
 altar. He was aware of the constant dripping as a pool of blood formed
 under Puck's floating corpse.

 Siedmeur wanted to vomit.

>vomit
 [That's not a verb I recognize.]

>examine corpse
 (Puck's corpse)
 Siedmeur glanced at the little man's disfigured corpse and tried to
 hide his revulsion. Puck's chest had been cleaved open. The warm blood
 was beginning to congeal around the empty, gaping lesion.


 After an endless span of time, Noric lifted his hooded head from his
 work and looked at Siedmeur. The guard shuddered. Who knew when the
 master might need another heart?

 With a flick of the master's wrist, the little man fell to the floor.
 "Put him in the bag and take him away," Noric ordered, then he resumed
 his work on the dead mage.

>take puck
 The dead, little man was a light burden in Siedmeur's strong arms, but
 a heavy burden to Siedmeur's fragile spirit.

>put puck in bag
 Siedmeur dumped the carcass into the blood stained bag, drawing it up
 by the sides so that the body settled in the bottom.

 "Be quick about it," Noric commanded. "My patience thins."

>take bag
 Siedmeur had that already.

>go south
 (first opening the mirrored hall door)
 Siedmeur managed to close the door behind him before he vomited. A
 chill ran down his spine and he broke out in a cold sweat as he dropped
 the little servant's remains. The guard knelt in the corner and closed
 his eyes tightly, unable to escape his own reflection. It was several
 minutes before his retching subsided.

 Siedmeur had witnessed scenes such as this more than a dozen times in
 his years of service, but this one affected him more substantially than
 the others. He couldn't say why for certain. Perhaps it was because he
 had known of the little man. Their paths had crossed on a number of
 occasions. But they never would again.

 The guard shivered and stood. He took deep, controlled breaths, trying
 to calm his nerves. The master's projects had grown darker and more
 frightening. Though he would never dare speak such blasphemy, in his
 mind Siedmeur questioned Noric's sanity. What could he do? The guard
 shook his head. There is but one thing to do, he thought to himself as
 he bent to pick the servant's carcass from the floor. Obey.








 Nortoche stood, shrouded in darkness, on the front steps and faced the
 closed museum. It was locked by this time of night, many hours past
 closing. Of course, he wouldn't have been there if it were open. Those
 that worked the museum by day would frown upon what he intended to do.
 Not that his intentions were bad.

 When Cylest, his beloved, was a child, she had taken her pin -- her
 PROMISE pin -- and hidden it in the statue! He had laughed at her when
 she first told him the story. It was just one of those crazy things
 that little girls did, he supposed.

 Cylest's father could certainly have managed its retrieval through the
 proper channels but she was set against this, claiming that it would
 bring her dishonor. Nortoche didn't really understand what she was
 talking about, but as their relationship became more serious, he began
 to have a vested interest in recovering the pin.

 So there he was, in yet another compromising situation, this time in
 the name of love, preparing to break into a museum and take back a
 promise pin, which no one knew was there, from an ancient statue which
 had possessed it for almost a dozen years.

 He shook his head at the craziness of it all and toyed with the globe
 which Cylest had procured for him despite its extreme rarity. The
 princess was not without her resources, he thought to himself. Nort
 tossed the orb playfully into the air meaning to catch it, but missed.
 The orb landed at his feet with a metal clink.

 Museum Steps
 It was the front steps of the Ancient Artifacts Museum, which was
 pretty ancient itself. The imposing front door stood locked and closed
 to the North. Although it was dark, small garden trails could still be
 seen winding through the bushes, one to the NorthWest, the other to the
 NorthEast.

 Nortoche could see a golden orb there.

>SAVE

>take orb

 Upon contact with the golden orb, Nortoche felt a surge of energy
 resonate through his body.








>examine orb
 Perfectly round, about the size of a large walnut. The small globe was
 smooth and Nort could see his distorted expression in it. This was
 anti-magik, he knew, and it could be used just once. When he threw it,
 all magik in a small diameter would disappear, the globe included.

>examine me
 Nort checked himself over, running his fingers through his frizzy hair
 and pressing out the wrinkles from his expensive new robes. Cylest had
 given the robes to him, and after he retrieved her promise pin she
 would be his forever, despite what any other Darisian thought. As she
 always told him, he was more stylish than most Dars could recognize. It
 had to be true, how else could he have captured the heart of the
 princess?

>examine door
 The museum entrance was oversized and quite imposing. It seemed to be
 carved from a single block of hardwood.

>examine bushes
 Well tended, the plant life was thriving.

>go northwest

 West of Museum
 This was a small walkway, winding through the shrubbery around the
 museum. The imposing wall, fashioned from cobbled brick was an arm's
 reach away to the East. The thick bushes made straying from the trail
 from the trail impractical. The trail itself encircled the museum,
 disappearing around the corners to the NorthEast and SouthEast.

>examine bricks
 Simple and unadorned, the wall was made of plain, earthen bricks.

 The brick wall were not significant. (It is not necessary to refer to
 them in the course of this game.)

>go northeast

 North of Museum
 Behind the museum amidst trees and bushes. It was quite dark and the
 crescent moon above provided only minimal light. The trail continued
 its encircling path around the museum, leading SouthEast and SouthWest.
 Due South was the museum's garden and beyond would be a wall of
 windows, provided so that visitors within the museum could admire the
 aesthetics without.

>go south

 Museum Garden
 A pungent scent swept across Nort's nostrils in a tingling rush. This
 garden hosted an army of extravagant flowering plants. The museum
 windows formed a glass wall to the South through which visitors could
 admire the floral display.  The garden was renowned for its beauty and
 many came simply to view the flowers and had little interest in the
 museum's archeological treasures.

 Nort considered the bottom window, trying to see the inner latch
 inside. Cylest had assured him that she had pulled some strings and
 that the bottom window would be unlocked, but he hesitated. If she was
 wrong and the window was still locked, then the museum's security
 spells would trigger when he tried to open it. That would summon the
 mages and he definitely didn't want to face them.

 Museum, Peace Exhibit
 This was a peaceful, organic section of the museum. Potted plants
 rested in every corner and climbing ivy worked its way over various
 crevices and ledges giving a warm, natural feeling. The Northern wall
 was made up of sections of glass, providing a scenic view of the
 gardens outside. The loWest section was actually a window with a handle
 that could be opened. A glass display case containing an open book was
 featured in this area. An engraved silver plaque on the case glistened
 in the dim luminosity.

 A glowing blue field of light surrounded the glass case.

 "The Book of Rehsif"

 "Little is known of the person named Rehsif-Mij other than the fact
 that he was an ancient historian. This so-called book of Rehsif, found
 long ago, is the last remnant of his work and is believed to be between
 three and four millennia old. Only a few paragraphs in the book, on a
 single page, are still legible and are believed to have been written in
 Rehsif's native language called "Anglosh." All knowledge of "Anglosh"
 and the ability to translate it has been lost to modern scholars for
 hundreds of years. The only remaining vestibule of knowledge concerning
 the language is the translation of the few readable snips of text from
 this ancient book into a once common Darisian dialect. The translation
 itself, which appears below, is close to a thousand years old and bears
 only a vague resemblance to modern Darisian:

 "...a fresh weapon unlike the collective had sight of in the previous.
 The weapon potentialed caustic, and when the caustic was unconstrained,
 there ushered not alone the departing of the Great Battle, but
 desolation in the escort..."

 "...freshly made was the All..."

 "...potential saturated the All in the infinitesimal and unioned
 within. Yoked the All to the whim of the minor count who arrayed the
 saturated by will; a fresh aristocracy approached..."

 "...aged magiks of sionce were mislaid and overcome by the approaching
 of the fresh magiks arrived by the saturated All. Sionce reduced, to
 depart yet. The All conformed to the decree of the wyzurds..."

>examine book
 The book, which lay open within the case, was obviously very old. Parts
 of the hand-written text appeared to be legible and could possibly be
 read, although the book itself was in such poor condition that touching
 it directly would probably render it dust. Everyone knew that this was
 the state that the book had been found in almost two thousand years
 before. Owing to the miracles of modern magik, the book had not aged a
 day since.

 Museum, War Exhibit
 Ancient weapons adorned the walls. The metallic gleam in the dim
 lighting furthered an ambiance of war and desolation. The single glass
 case, centered in this section, contained a large, box-like device the
 purpose of which was mysteriously non-obvious.

 A glowing blue field of light surrounded the glass case.

>examine device
 The artifact was large and square with symbols printed on the side. It
 had an opening, a gap in the metallic skin, which revealed its inner
 workings. Atop the artifact was a vertical stem, hosting a plug, that
 was obviously designed to interface with another object. There was also
 a panel on the side of the artifact (which was closed) and a solitary
 square button on the front.
 The artifact was currently switched off.

>examine symbols
 The ancient symbols were beyond comprehension; their meaning lost in
 time along with all the knowledge of the ancients.

>examine gap
 The opening in the side of the machine was simply a missing cover, torn
 off and lost at some point in history. It revealed the inner guts of
 the machine, complex electronics and moving parts that made the machine
 function. The most prominent of the inner parts were three gear pegs
 arranged in a precise pattern: two upper pegs, one lower peg.

 painter of exquisite skill. In the corner, seemingly out of place yet
 encased in glass, was an assortment of rubbish arranged in a bizarre

 Museum, Statue Exhibit
 This was a prominent section of the museum, near the front entrance. It
 was home to the museum's -- no, the world's -- most prized
 archeological artifact, known by no other name than the "ancient
 statue." Like all large artifacts in the museum, a glass case had been
 erected to house it. Within, standing upright, the statue stared
 unseeingly at Nortoche.

 A glowing blue field of light surrounded the glass case.

>examine statue
 Grey and cold, the ancient statue stood in the same stance that it
 always had. It was a sight familiar to everyone in the world and
 Nortoche had seen it dozens of times in the past. As he looked at it,
 however, Nort realized that the glass case blurred the statue somewhat.
 To truly appreciate the amazing detail of the statue, he would have to
 look at it from within the case itself.

>go east
 No, there was no time to wander around further. Nort had to get
 Cylest's pin from the statue's pocket and get out.

>go north

 Although the exits led in all directions, Nort had already located what
 he came for and had no further need to wander around. The only exit
 Nort had already traveled lay west.

 an alarm when intersected. The mages were very thorough.

 Nortoche looked at the statue in wonder. The smooth jaw bone, the
 tapered nose... he could see the detail for which this statue was
 famous. The realism was phenomenal. Nortoche looked into the unfocused
 eyes... even the ring around the iris was distinctive and clearly
 visible after all these thousands of years. It was amazing that any
 sculptor could...

 Nortoche frowned. For an instant, he could have sworn that the statue
 had blinked. Silly, he thought. Alone in this dark, closed museum, his
 mind was playing...

 No. There it was again... It WAS moving! Panic instantly welled up
 inside of Nortoche as the statue exhaled. The myths were true! This
 dark mage from ancient times had awakened! He would devour the children
 and enslave the world killing all who displeased him! He would destroy
 all in his path, and Nortoche was just inches from his face!

 Fear griped Nortoche and he cried out in a fanatical scream, "Mercy!"
 But at this the dark mage only took notice of him, his eyes focusing
 for the first time in millennia. "Don't kill me!" he cried. "Don't kill
 me!" Nortoche leaped away from the mage in a frenzy and smashed into
 the casing which surrounded him. He fell to the floor as the glass
 shards rained down.

 His life was over, Nortoche knew. He would never again see Cylest. He
 would never again walk through the bazaar with his peers. He had only
 seconds before his life came to an end, moments before the dark mage's
 wrath came upon him.

 And it came with a blinding flash.








 There was a flash of light. I didn't see it directly since my eyes were
 squeezed shut, but the light was so bright that it penetrated my
 eyelids and I felt the pulse on my skin. When I opened my eyes the boy
 was gone. "Hello?" I called. There was no response.

 I ran my fingers through my hair, trying my best to brush out the tiny
 shards of glass, then I looked around me, taking in my surroundings.

 I could see glass cases in every direction. This was obviously a closed

 be a historical text, though I couldn't be certain. It could just as
 well have been a work of fiction:

 "...a new weapon unlike any nation had seen before. It held vast,
 destructive power, and when the destruction was unleashed, it brought
 about not only the end of the Great War, but desolation..."

 "...changed forever was the world..."

 "...power permeated all matter on the atomic level and bonded with it.
 Matter became subject to the whim of those few that could bend the
 power according to their will; a new aristocracy came about..."

 "...old magic of science was forgotten, replaced by the coming of the
 new magic brought about by the permeation. Science dwindled, all but
 lost. The world rearranged itself at the commandments of the
 wyzurds..."

 The junk art scene was hardly portable.

>examine junk
 It was junk art -- a little scene fashioned by welding together
 discarded pieces of machinery. This scene seemed to depict a man (or
 was it a frog?) sitting at the base of a strange, metallic river
 holding an umbrella over his head.

 I pulled gently on the umbrella. It came free with a soft metallic

 The little man was not significant. (It is not necessary to refer to it

>examine river
 The river was contrived from a series of hundreds of washers, several
 rows across, arranged in such a way as to suggest movement. I wondered
 at the effort the artist had put into the alignment of these washers.
 Surely they could not all be so firmly affixed.

>take washer

 There was a whole river of washers to choose from.

 I ran my hand along the rows of washers and heard a metallic clinking

 kept it in place had weakened over time.

>examine umbrella
 It was a small satellite dish, about the size of a large bowl. What it
 was originally designed for I could only guess at, but there was a
 small socket on the bottom where a plug of some kind could be inserted.

>examine device
 It was small, hand-sized, and if not scrutinized, it could easily have
 been mistaken for a portable stereo. What looked like a single
 headphone was actually an electrode which retracted automatically into
 the device when not being used. There was a dial, broken and spinning
 freely. There was also a small, red button used to initiate the
 process.

>open device
 The Petrian device was not something I could open.

>examine dial
 If working, the dial would have adjusted how much energy was channeled
 into the subject. This translated exactly into how much time it would
 be eikonized in statue form. In this broken modal, the charge was not
 being regulated appropriately. The result was that the subject might be
 frozen as a statue for an hour or ten-thousand years. There was no way
 of knowing. It didn't matter. A hundred years, a thousand years --
 there would be no difference. I sought only to leave this world and its
 constant reminders of my lost life, my lost love.

 When I pushed the button, lights all over the machine lit up. The gears
 inside spun continuously, first in one direction, then in the other.
 The dish atop the machine spun around too, driven by the gears and
 seeming in search of some signal. Then the dish stopped, having
 apparently found what it was looking for.

 There was a chime then a woman's voice from the machine:
 "Initialization of the Spatial Point-to-Point Unity System successful.
 Positioning system found no working positional nodes. Defaulting
 destination point to project headquarters at coordinates
 000-000-000..." There was a pause then, "Warning! Diagnostic systems
 indicate markedly low power levels. Unity space will exist only
 momentarily."

 Then the noise levels produced by the machine increased. There was a
 rhythmic throbbing sound, felt through vibration more than heard. I
 could feel a tingling sensation in the air; pins and needles. It was
 obvious that the machine was powering up for some task, and for a
 moment I thought that the aged device might explode. Then, a burst of
 sparkling blue light appeared and expanded. In a moment the blue light
 formed a doorway which floated in mid-air attached to nothing.

 The computer's voice came again. "Unity space achieved," it said.
 "Doorway will remain open for two seconds before power is exhausted."

>enter doorway

 The hair on my arms and legs stood on end as I stepped through the
 fluid, plasmatic doorway and emerged into darkness.








 The green mage surveyed the museum from the lobby. It was active, and
 bright. Mages from nearly every order wandered around performing
 incantations and collecting various pieces of information. Dunamei saw
 immediately that the ersatz mages had been included in the
 investigation.

 Anger flared within the green mage and showed plainly upon his face. It
 was an affront to bring the pseudo mages -- the "siontysts" -- into an
 investigation as delicate as this. They were not mages in any sense of
 the word. The All did not bend to their will. They were commoners
 seeking to be equal to mages, nothing more. Why the Overseer chose to
 back the King's decision and recognize them as a true order was beyond
 him. Their newly created order of silver was blasphemy. For a fleeting
 instant Dunamei considered turning all of the charlatans into slugs to
 make a point. Instead, he made a show of smoothing out wrinkles in his
 emerald robes while he took several deep, slow breaths to calm himself.

 To the matter at hand then: the statue. The boy, Nortoche, had tripped
 a security spell after breaking into the museum. During questioning he
 had told a bizarre story of the ancient statue coming to life. It was a
 story that he continued to tell even after being subjected to truth
 spells. Highly improbable, but mages had been dispatched only to find
 that the ancient statue was indeed gone. None of the pieces to this
 puzzle fit together and there was disagreement between the
 investigating mages as to the true events.

 Well Dunamei would put an end to the doubt. He held his position as
 Principal Mage for good reason and he would uncover the fate of the
 statue. Perhaps the walls had something to say about it...

 Museum Lobby
 The museum lobby was large and spacious. There were delayed echoes of
 footsteps resounding from the lofty walls and vaulted ceiling which
 drew a direct contrast to the quiet calm of the rest of the museum. The
 building's large, decorative entrance lay open to the South.

 Numerous other mages were here, busily performing various castings in
 their uncoordinated investigations.

 A pseudo mage made eye contact with Dunamei as he left. Dunamei grit

 Museum, Statue Exhibit
 This was a prominent section of the museum, near the front entrance. It
 was home to the museum's -- no, the world's -- most prized
 archeological artifact, known by no other name than the "ancient
 statue." Like all large artifacts in the museum, a glass case had been
 erected to house it. All that remained of the case was a collection of
 glass shards that littered the floor.

 Several paths had been blocked off by beams of yellow light.  It was a
 minor spell, probably cast to preserve the crime scene by the museum's
 security mage once the break-in had been detected. The only exit not
 barred by light lay west.

 Numerous other mages were here, busily performing various castings in

>put on robe, wizard hat

>examine case
 Dunamei did not see anything like that.

>spells
 He had the following spells at his disposal:
      thespia (Communicate with the inanimate world about recent events)
      dysparsen (Dispell magik)
      frerquoe (Cast fireball)

>thespia walls
 [Thespia can only be cast. No object for this spell need be specified.]

>thespia
 The lighting dimmed and a foggy mist formed. Shapes coalesced in the
 vapor and appeared to solidify. The real world, in turn, became
 translucent and strangely dim...

 The vision that formed was sharp and clear, as Dunamei expected it
 would be. Interesting things had happened here of late, things even the
 inanimate would find interesting.

 The missing glass case formed. It contained the famous statue, frozen
 and lifeless as it had been for all of recorded history. After a few
 moments someone entered the room. It was Nortoche, whom had just been
 interviewed. Dunamei was extremely interested in what would happen
 next, the boy's story had been fantastic and implausible, yet spells
 had ensured that it was the truth as far as Nortoche believed. The mage
 fully expected to find some sign of trickery, perhaps an involvement of
 magik which the boy would not have recognized.

 Nortoche pulled out a golden orb. Dunamei recognized it as a magikal
 artifact. They allowed even commoners to cast spells, but were
 extremely difficult to come by. Princess Cylest could perhaps come by
 one, as Nortoche had said, but for political reasons her involvement in
 this would simply disappear as the orb did when Nortoche threw it,
 dispelling the ward.

 The mage watched closely, now, as the boy opened the glass case and
 entered it, wanting to miss nothing. But Dunamei saw no sign of magik
 as the boy looked into the statue's face. The spell responsible for
 turning the statue from a grey stone color to a pink fleshy color was
 not obvious. The mage rubbed his eyes as the boy smashed through the
 glass. What had happened?
 Dunamei couldn't believe it. The ancient statue -- alive and mobile!

 What sort of spell could have done that?

 It didn't surprise Dunamei in the lEast that the statue lived after
 being transformed into flesh, he had long suspected there was more to
 it than just the unclassified rock it was made from. What few spells
 could provide information about the statue suggested the presence of
 stone organs within the stone statue. What did surprise Dunamei was
 that someone had been successful at transforming it into flesh.
 Hundreds of mages from all the guilds had tried in vain to affect the
 statue in any way. It had stood, impervious to magik, since it had been
 found, millennia ago.

 Then came the security spell, triggered by the smashing of the glass
 case. It was a flash of light which transported all living creatures
 from the museum and secured a perimeter around the crime scene until
 the mages could investigate. When the flash faded, the boy was gone,
 transported to a holding cell, but the statue -- the man -- remained.
 Even in life, the statue remained impervious to magik. Dunamei was
 shaken by this revelation.

 As he watched the statue walk -- without even a cramp after being
 frozen for thousands upon thousands of years -- Dunamei could only
 think of Noric the exiled. Was he behind this? What evil purpose could
 he accomplish with this? A minion that was resistant to the mages...
 Dunamei shivered.

 The lighting brightened and the shapes faded as the mist vanished.

 The exhibits in this room were all of an artistic nature. Ancient
 sculptures stood proudly erect upon elegant marble pedestals. Colorful
 oil paintings adorned the walls. Sprawling across the ceiling was a
 vast and expansive mural, a lasting memorial to a long dead master
 painter of exquisite skill. In the corner, seemingly out of place yet
 encased in glass, was an assortment of rubbish arranged in a bizarre
 fashion.

 Several paths had been blocked off by beams of yellow light. The only

 The glass case was open and the awakened statue worked on the artifact,
 completely unaffected by the glowing blue ward.

 What lost magik did this ancient mage wield? Could he be in league with
 Noric? Did he play some part in Noric's plans? Perhaps. No intelligence
 had been gathered about Noric's latest works, and many spies had lost
 their lives while attempting to find out. All indications were that it
 was a perversion of the arts, something unspeakable, something to be
 feared, and something that had never been done before. Awakening the
 ancient statue had certainly never been done before, but hardly seemed
 perverse. Perhaps it was only part of Noric's larger plan.

 Something had happened in the scene, what was it? Dunamei had almost
 missed it, lost in his own thoughts. The statue mage had put items in
 and retrieved items from the ancient artifact. Dunamei shook his head
 in wonder. These visions of the past did nothing to clear up what had
 happened.

 The statue made flesh walked into the room, unaware of Dunamei and the
 present world, which had faded visibly. He walked purposely over to the
 case, surrounded by the glowing blue aura, the protection ward. He
 opened the glass case, passing through the ward effortlessly, then
 reached in and opened the panel on the contained artifact, something
 the siontysts claimed endowed the ancient's with great power. They
 called it a "kompeutre," a type of "ma-sheen." Dunamei always
 considered the talk rubbish, an attempt to elevate commoners to
 equality with true mages. He ground his teeth at the their impudence.

 There was disruption in the vision, like the blowing of vapor. It
 reformed, but differently. The man had split into three or four
 duplicates of himself, but Dunamei recognized it as a nuance of the
 Thespia spell (the inanimate had little understanding of linear time,
 and often replayed separate, closely related events simultaneously).
 Each of the statue doppelgangers seemed to be attaching items to the
 artifact in the display glass, sometimes overlapping each other like
 spirits. Dunamei had difficulty following what was happening. Then the
 duplicates united again and for just a moment, the man stood there
 clear as day working in some un-guessable fashion on the artifact.

 Then the doorway appeared and Dunamei jumped. A collective gasp came
 from the mages and the pseudo-mages alike. The man had spoken no
 incantations. He had cast no spells. He had simply worked the
 "kompeutre" and the spell had been cast. Dunamei frowned. This was a
 disappointment. It could only serve to feed the growing insurrection of
 the siontysts. It could only reinforce their demands for equality. They
 were an enigma, these commoners who presumed themselves equal to the
 mages.

 Museum, Peace Exhibit
 This was a peaceful, organic section of the museum. Potted plants
 rested in every corner and climbing ivy worked its way over various
 crevices and ledges giving a warm, natural feeling. The Northern wall
 was made up of sections of glass, providing a scenic view of the
 gardens outside. The loWest section was actually a window with a handle
 that could be opened. A glass display case containing an open book was
 featured in this area. An engraved silver plaque on the case glistened
 in the dim luminosity.

 Several paths had been blocked off by beams of yellow light. The only
 exit not barred by light lay east.

 Numerous other mages were here, busily performing various castings in
 their uncoordinated investigations.

 A glowing blue field of light surrounded the glass case.

 The air crackled with energy and a sharp and sudden breeze swept the
 room. A single silvery door appeared. It shimmered and wavered in the
 air for an instant then solidified. The Principal Mage recognized the
 Thurais spell and frowned. This could not be good. Thurais was a
 complex casting that opened a doorway between two locations. The burden
 upon the caster increased exponentially as a function of distance so
 the cost usually outweighed the benefit. It was used only in the direst
 of circumstances.

 A messenger mage, clad in a scarlet robe, stepped from the door making
 the required, continuous gestures to keep the door open. He looked to
 Dunamei at once. "My lord," he began. "The council has urgent need of
 you. There has been an occurrence." The red mage paused, lost for a
 moment in concentration on his gestures, and then continued in a soft,
 secretive manner. "It concerns Limech," he whispered.

 A prickle went up Dunamei's neck. Limech had been a friend, if mages
 could have friends, and a fellow member of the green order. He had been
 Darisia's last mole in Noric's faction, the one remaining spy. News had
 come of something building. Noric the Dark had apparently made a
 breakthrough in his forbidden works, something big. The hope of the
 council had been upon Limech's intelligence as to the nature of Noric's
 new, evil casting. Instead, they had received Limech's heart, cut from
 his body. Dunamei had delivered the news of Limech's demise to his
 widow. Her pathetic, sobbing cries continued to haunt him weeks later.

>thespia
 The lighting dimmed and a foggy mist formed. Shapes coalesced in the
 vapor and appeared to solidify. The real world, in turn, became

 Through the window crawled a dark figure. As the figure stood and
 stepped into the light, Dunamei recognized the boy, Nortoche. Events
 had certainly seemed to play out as he had described them, the
 protection ward had been missing from the window. Dunamei suspected
 that Princess Cylest truly was involved, as the boy had claimed. Of
 course there would be no mention of that when this was made public.
 Nortoche had a history of trouble and would be held solely responsible
 for this break-in. It was always so when royalty's indiscretions came
 to light.

 The lighting brightened and the shapes faded as the mist vanished.

>ms

>enter silvery door
 Dunamei could not see any such thing.

>examine door
 The frameless doorway floated in mid-air, a shimmering silver glow.
 Dunamei recognized it as the Thurais spell. It was an impressive
 casting, beyond all but the most advanced of mages. Dunamei knew
 intimately of its intricacies and the toll it took upon the caster's
 power. It was used only in the most urgent of circumstances.

 As he pondered it, Dunamei's mind was drawn to the Thespia images. The
 awakened statue had cast a similar spell, seemingly based upon
 principles of the ersatz mages, the "siontysts." Dunamei grit his teeth
 in disgust.

 Sweat dripped from the Messenger Mage's forehead.

>enter doorway
 Dunamei could not see any such thing.

>enter door
 Dunamei closed his eyes tightly and braced himself for the predictable
 tingling as he stepped into the silver spell. As he passed through it,
 the Thurais casting overwhelmed his tactile senses with prickling
 sensations over his entire body. The pins and needles subsided as he
 stepped out on the other side of the door. It was substantially warmer
 in this new location than in the museum and the floral scent in his
 nose told the mage immediately that he was outside. Dunamei opened his
 eyes and looked around to get his bearings. He was in the outskirts of
 Darisia which bordered the Eastern wastelands.

 Behind him he could feel the Thurais spell intensify as the messenger
 mage followed him through. The doorway vanished then, taking with it
 most of the light to see by. "The rest of the council awaits you this
 way, my lord." The envoy's voice quivered slightly as he wandered off
 to the East.

 Outskirts of Darisia
 This was a dark copse of trees near the edge of Darisia. Little was
 visible, but a small trail led Eastward. Line of sight was obscured by
 trees, but a commotion of voices indicated a sizable gathering in that
 direction.

>go east
 Dunamei stepped into a small clearing next to the iron fence. It was
 illuminated by some minor casting. The entire council was there
 already, obscuring what they crowded around. Nearest to Dunamei was
 Caulor the brown, his face pale and disturbed. He gnawed reflexively at
 his fingernails and sweat beaded across his pudgy brow. Caulor's empty,
 horrified eyes met the Principal Mage's. Several seconds passed before
 recognition was reflected in his expression. There was no smile, no nod
 from his friend. Caulor simply stepped back giving Dunamei room. The
 other mages, faces drained and vacant, did the same revealing a scene
 which both repulsed and horrified the green mage.

 It was Limech, rotting and decomposed yet standing before them, a
 mocking affront to Death. He seemed not to take notice of the
 trembling, imperial guard who held him at sword point.

 "My lord," croaked the undead mage, seeing him. Limech took a hobbling
 step forward. The mages, all save Dunamei, recoiled. Taudorn retreated
 to the tree line and doubled over, vomiting. The other mages also
 withdrew then, most retching, leaving the lone commoner guard. Even
 Bremech the grey, Dunamei noted to himself with delight, bore a pale,
 sickly hue. The stench of decay waft across Dunamei's nostrils, turning
 his stomach, but the Principal Mage stood his ground staunchly before
 his dead friend.

 Fringe of Darisia, behind gates
 It was the line between hell and paradise. On this side, aided by mage
 works, the land gave forth grass and trees, life in abundance. But just
 to the East, on the other side of the ancient iron fence, was a barren
 wasteland. The Thanatos desert stretched as far as the eye could see.
 Those banished by the council were sent out into the desert to die by
 the elements. No creature could survive there, no life whatsoever, or
 so it was once thought, before Noric.

 Limech the undead mage stood there, decay-ridden and held at sword
 point by an imperial guard.

 "My lord," hissed the rotting mage. "It is I, Limech." There was a note
 of anguish in his voice, as if every moment of his lifeless existence
 was agony. "I bear news from the dark one." Upon his chest, Dunamei saw
 the clumsy suture of twine and remembered the heart the courier bird
 had delivered to the council weeks ago. Attached had been a note
 scrawled in blood indicating the heart had belonged to Limech. Dunamei
 had little doubt that it had indeed.

 "You are NOT Lord Limech!" shouted the wide-eyed soldier, hysteria
 cracking his voice. "You are a vile imposter! A profanity!" The long
 sword quivered in the guard's grip but it remained erect, pointed at
 the dead mage's torso. "Say the word, Lord Dunamei and I will slay this
 wicked devil!" Dunamei appraised the soldier for a moment, impressed.
 He was rightfully terrified, yet this commoner had remained when even
 mages fled. He thought for a moment, trying to recall the guard's
 name... Cedreght. Yes, that was it, Cedreght. Dunamei had a new
 appreciation for this imperial soldier.

 "And what news of Norioure do you bring, mage Limech?" The animated
 corpse smiled toothlessly at Dunamei's reference to his mage status and
 his lip split up to his nostril. Dunamei suppressed a shudder. He could
 not blot out the memory of the last time he had seen Limech. The mage
 had been promising. Young and strong, teeming with pink life and
 energy... it was a striking contrast to the green pallor of his rotting
 skin now.

 "The dark master..." a chill went up Dunamei's spine at the hoarse
 words. There was no doubt that Noric was indeed Limech's master now.
 "He is raising..." Limech hunched over here, seized by a fit of
 coughing. It was a deep, wheezing cough and when it subsided green
 mucus oozed from Limech's nose and crusted, broken lips. It dripped off
 of his chin. "He raises an army."

 Raises indeed, Dunamei thought to himself.

 raises them all," rasped the dead man. Dunamei froze in place, unable
 to look away as the vibrating eye was pushed aside by a large,
 oversized maggot. "All who have died in the wars past are his, now."

 Limech continued in a hoarse whisper, taking no notice as the worm fell
 from his eye and disappeared into the foliage.

>ask limech about kingdom
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about heart
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about death
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>SAVE
>cf11
 Enter saved game to store: [Ok.]

>ask limech about statue
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about statue
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about plans
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about magik
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>examine limech
 Dunamei looked into the rotting face of his old friend. Black fluid
 dripped out of the corners of his crusted maw. His chest exposed a
 crude surgical gash, sewn back together with thick rope or twine. The
 stench of death was strong.

>ask limech about past
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>examine cedreght
 Dressed in imperial armor, Cedreght was the finest example of a royal
 soldier.

>cedreght, cut gash
 There was no reply.

>cedreght, kill limech
 The lifeless spy was in agony. Limech had been a good mage and deserved
 better. It was an atrocity and needed to be corrected. Dunamei looked
 meaningfully at soldier and nodded. "Kill him," he ordered.

 The guard hesitated, assessing the dead mage who ignored him entirely.
 Then he thrust his broadsword into Limech's side. The zombie didn't
 even flinch. Cedreght pulled his sword free and stepped back, shaken by
 how little Limech had been affected by his attack. The broadsword was
 covered to the hilt in black ooze.

 Cedreght cast a disturbed glace at Dunamei, awaiting further
 instructions.

>cedreght, remove heart

 Cedreght has better things to do.

>ask limech about heart
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>cedreght, cut heart

 Cedreght has better things to do.

>cedrecht, cut twine
 [You seem to want         vv to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.]

>spells
 Dunamei had the following spells at his disposal:
      thespia (Communicate with the inanimate world about recent events)
      dysparsen (Dispell magik)
      frerquoe (Cast fireball)

>dysparsen
 [The dysparsen spell needed to be cast upon another spell.]

>ask limech about spell
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>dysparsen limech
 Dunamei mouthed the incantation and cast the dysparsen spell upon
 Limech. For a moment there was a visible reaction to the casting, as
 though the two spells were competing for dominance. Then the spell's
 potency left, leaving Limech the undead still undead.

>ask limech about wife
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about loyalties
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about spying
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about undead
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>search limech
 Dunamei found nothing of interest.

>ask limech about war
 "I don't know anything about that," Limech said.

>ask limech about news
 "And what news of Norioure do you bring, mage Limech?" The animated
 corpse smiled toothlessly at Dunamei's reference to his mage status and
 his lip split up to his nostril. Dunamei suppressed a shudder. He could
 not blot out the memory of the last time he had seen Limech. The mage
 had been promising. Young and strong, teeming with pink life and
 energy... it was a striking contrast to the green pallor of his rotting
 skin now.

 "The dark master..." a chill went up Dunamei's spine at the hoarse
 words. There was no doubt that Noric was indeed Limech's master now.
 "He is raising..." Limech hunched over here, seized by a fit of
 coughing. It was a deep, wheezing cough and when it subsided green
 mucus oozed from Limech's nose and crusted, broken lips. It dripped off
 of his chin. "He raises an army."

 Raises indeed, Dunamei thought to himself.

>frerquoe limech
 Accompanied by a single gesture, the word sizzled into existence as a
 blazing fireball which leapt from his finger to Limech.

 Limech deserves better than this atrocious waking death, Dunamei said
 to himself as the fireball spell enveloped the dead mage. The heat
 burned brightly for a moment cooking the rotten flesh, then subsided.
 Limech's blackened carcass fell crumbling to the ground.

 Dunamei turned to face the Thanatos wasteland. "Message received,
 Noric." He murmured softly. Then, "Inform the Overseer," Dunamei
 commanded loudly to all hiding mages. "I am certain he will convene the
 council." He turned then, without waiting for a response, and stalked
 down the path to Darisia.








 Conrad the Dark was standing on the terrace watching Noric work far
 below in the volcanic basin.

 He was simultaneously horrified and elated. It was appalling to think
 that Noric had accomplished it, a casting so unimaginably ghastly that
 it was beyond all the forbidden arts. Yet to watch him actually raise
 the dead as fast as the servants could bring them... It was
 exhilarating.

 The courier arrived then, flapping its wings and hovering just out of
 reach. In its beak it held a folded piece of yellow parchment, news
 from the spies within the empire!

 Stone Terrace
 Like most of Norioure, the city of the exiled mages, the terrace was
 carved directly from the stone of the mountain. This was Conrad's
 personal balcony and it provided a splendid view of Noric's dark
 castings far below at the chasm bottom. Drapes covered the doorway into
 Conrad's quarters to the South.

 A messenger bird, gripping a yellow parchment in its beak, hovered off
 the terrace edge, just out of arm's reach. Its wings were beating as
 rapidly as a bumblebee's.

>spells
 Conrad had the following spell at his disposal:
      maesmur (Mesmerize a creature)

>maesmur bird
 Conrad spoke the word of power and make the appropriate gestures. The
 messenger bird's eyes glazed over as the casting came upon it.

 Conrad had been interested in the actions of the newly undead and had
 watched them for many days. Many retained memories of life. Some even
 understood that they were no longer numbered among the living. All were
 in despair. They cried out, those that yet retained their voices.

>bird, give parchment to me
 The bird stretched out its neck, trying to obey the command in its most
 literal form, but could not.  Hu   mrv      c

>bird, come
 The messenger bird came to rest upon the ground.

>take parchement
 Conrad could not see any such thing.

>take parchment
 The parchment was held firmly in the beak of the messenger bird. The
 couriers were bred with beefy muscles to keep possession of their
 messages and would not allow them too simply be taken from them. It was
 instinct.

 Cries of agony echoed up from the basin.

>bird, drop parchment

 Dropped.

>take parchment
 Taken.

 For a moment, Conrad took notice of an animated corpse far below. It
 croaked indistinguishable cries of anguish. At first, it seemed to the
 mage that the undead man might be weeping but no, he was not. Decay had
 washed over his face some time ago, so how could he have been crying
 with no eyes?

>read it
 The mage opened the parchment and looked at the three words it
 contained:








 It took a moment for him to wrap his mind around the statement. It was
 uncanny. Conrad had been quick to dismiss the initial jumble of reports
 that the ancient statue had awakened, but now he had received
 confirmation. It was unbelievable. He furrowed his brow, trying to
 calculate any affect upon the plan. His eyes wandered to the
 proceedings below.

 Conrad watched Noric's pale face fixed in a scowl of determination. He
 had worked tirelessly for weeks, breaking not even for sleep from his
 necromancy. There was little doubt that Noric had lost his mind; the
 madness shown unmistakably in his eyes. Each casting seemed to take a
 toll upon Noric's lucidity, as though each new zombie required a
 sacrifice of sanity; but what Noric had achieved!

 Conrad admired the moving mass of the risen decaying, the mementos of
 countless wars with Darisia brought forth to do Noric's bidding. It was
 a massive army that stretched as far as he could see. The power of this
 military force was immeasurable, the risen soldiers were innumerable.
 No, he decided at once. It didn't matter that the ancient statue had
 awoken. Nothing could protect Darisia from this army of rot. Soon the
 empire would fall and Darisia would see the triumphant return of the
 exiled mages!








 Congratulations! You've just completed the first six chapters of "The
 Mage Wars: Statue." Look for the completed game sometime before March
 2004!
