 <span class="floydstyle subheader">grass</span>

 A broad rust-brown field stretches from creek to woods. A black dead
 oak towers over the grass. The fiery clouds blow over the dark crater,
 the watchtower rising on the ridge.

 The lights of houses shine through the woods along the creek, up the
 road that climbs to the dark crater rim.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">willow house</span>

 Leaves hang into the dark silent creek behind the small white house.

 A bronze antique lantern flickers by the door, above the light of a
 purple-orange streaked pumpkin.  Candles glow along the porch rail,
 rust-brown, orange, and midnight blue.

 A rusted pulley wheel is suspended from a tree, transformed into a
 postapocalyptic dreamcatcher. The center is oddly empty.

 A voice drifts through the trees.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">evergreen house</span>

 The tall hemlocks hide the wooden house in dusk, the creek flowing
 under mossy boulders and shadowy branches.  A large carved turnip sits
 dark on the walk.

 blue-violet candles unlit.  A green camping lantern hangs empty by the
 boarded-up door.

 A guard bat circles overhead, silhouetted on the evening sky.

 The shutters open a bit, and you pause as Aidan climbs out onto the
 porch, carrying his fire axe.

 "Happy Halloween," he says, frowning at the candles. "Ah, not again…
 I
 swear there's a poltergeist here."

 Aidan frowns at the unlit green camping lantern.

 A red beacon flashes across the sky.

>light lantern



 You touch the flame of your ivory candle to a yellow candle. It
 flickers to life.

 Aidan quickly lights the green camping lantern as you revive the rest
 of the candles, filling the evergreen porch with bright flames.

 "Thanks a lot. Here, this will have to do for a treat…" Aidan grins
 and hands you an amber bead, glowing in the candlelight.

 Aidan smiles, scanning the trees intently.

   bone-white candle
   an amber bead
   nightstick

 A rustle comes from the woods.

 "They don't have much to eat here. No treats."


 A siren sounds, far off.

>go south



 You descend the dirt road in the flame of the bone-white candle,
 toward the crater valley.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">evergreen house</span>

 The tall hemlocks hide the wooden house in dusk, the creek flowing
 under mossy boulders and shadowy branches.  A large carved turnip
 glows on the walk.

 The long covered porch shines with candles, golden-brown, yellow, and
 blue-violet.  A green camping lantern flickers by the boarded-up door.

 Aidan glances up, scanning the trees intently.


>go south



 You go down the dirt road in the light of the bone-white candle,
 toward the field at the bottom.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">willow house</span>

 Leaves hang into the dark silent creek behind the small white house.

 A bronze antique lantern glows by the door, above the light of a
 purple-orange streaked pumpkin.  Candles shine along the porch rail,
 rust-brown, orange, and midnight blue.

 A rusted pulley wheel is suspended from a tree, transformed into a
 postapocalyptic dreamcatcher. The center is oddly empty.

 Elia looks thoughtfully at the orange.


>give bone-white



 (to Elia)


 Elia takes the bead with a look of delight, and threads it into the
 center of her odd dreamcatcher.

 "Perfect… This is for you." Elia smiles absently and hands you a
 small
 ear of rainbow-colored dried corn. "Blessings…"


 Elia smiles dreamily.


>examine corn



 The light twinkles on the rainbow corn.

 "What else? It's missing something…"

>examine wheel



 A web of glittering wire with bright bottle caps, shining bits of
 broken glass and bullet shells, random feathers twirling on beaded
 cords.

 Elia looks thoughtfully at the yourself.


>examine rainbow



 The light shines on the rainbow corn.

 Elia pokes at the ground with her crowbar.


>go north



 You walk up the dirt road in the flame of the bone-white candle,
 toward the sky.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">evergreen house</span>

 The tall hemlocks hide the wooden house in dusk, the creek flowing
 under mossy boulders and shadowy branches.  A large carved turnip
 flickers on the walk.

 Aidan smiles, staring into the sky.


 A red beacon flashes across the sky.

>b



 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go north



 You climb the dirt road in the light of the bone-white candle, toward
 the crater rim.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">pine hill house</span>

 The grey house clings to the hillside among rocks and pines, the
 waterfall splashing behind it.

 A brass hurricane lantern glows on the bottom of the long stair,
 beside the flame of a pale green pumpkin.

 Up on the high deck a plate of candle ends shines, ivory, red, and
 dark green.

 A rustle comes from the woods.

 "They're hungry, little ones…"

>give corn



 (to Naima)


 Naima takes the rainbow corn happlly. "The little ones will love it."
 She smiles and runs up to set the corn on the deck.








 The siren from the watchtower sounds, a beacon of red light piercing
 the darkening clouds.
 Naima calls from the deck. "Here, take these! I'll be there in a
 minute. Good luck." She tosses something shining down to you.

 The rainbow corn has attracted a very large bird, eating happily.
 Naima watches the creature in delight.

>inventory



 You are carrying:
   some keys
   bone-white candle
   nightstick

 The rainbow corn has attracted a intelligent-looking squirrel,
 nibbling happily.  Naima watches the creature in delight.

 Grey smoke rises over the crater.

>examine bird



 Nothing like that is close to you.

>go north



 You walk up the dirt road in the flicker of the bone-white candle,
 toward the sky.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">crater rim</span>

 Barbed fence along the edge of black earth and jagged rocks. The fiery
 clouds arch over the dark crater, the watchtower rising on the ridge.

 A rusted metal door is set in the roots of scorched trees.  The earth
 drops away beyond.

 A golden meteor streaks across the fiery clouds.

>unlock door with keys



 You must supply a noun.

>open door with keys



 That's unlocked at the moment.

>examine door



 A rusted metal door is set in the ground.

 A guard bat circles overhead, silhouetted on the evening sky.

>in



 You decide not to wander into the forest.

>enter door



 That's not something you can enter.

 The light is fading, reddening.

>open door



 You open the rusted metal door, revealing a silver bow and arrows.

 A guard bat circles overhead, silhouetted on the evening sky.

>take bow








 You pick up the bow and sling the quiver over your shoulder. The
 sounds the crater rim are growing.
 sounds the crater rim are growing.

 The others follow, coming up the crater road.

 Aidan waves cheerfully, shouldering a sniper rifle. Naima scurries
 over to a lookout perch, dragging a large clutch of grenades in a
 bucket. Elia settles into a rock crevice with her shotgun.


 The sky darkens with smoke and red light and fire, the sirens of
 settlements far off joining the chaos.

 The fence shakes, but holds.

 A triple explosion below, pieces flying above the crater rim, sets off
 a chorus of victory shouts.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Happy Halloween… </span>

 Here you have spent many a busy or an idle hour, composing your music,
 reading, or playing music. You fear this will be the last time you see
 it for a long time, perhaps forever. No, do not give up hope! There is
 yet a chance for you.

 Bookshelves line the walls of the room. It has taken you years, your
 entire life to build up this library, but now you must abandon it.
 Your grand piano stands heavily in a corner of the room, notes for
 your newest composition lined up along the music stand. The high

 the door to the west.

 You release the brakes on the piano's wheels and push it towards the
 door. It rolls easily - too easily - in fact it escapes you and
 crashes into the door with a nightmarish jangle. Yes, there are
 scratches on the poor thing now. "Sorry, old friend," you mutter as
 you lock the wheels in place once more. No zombie will be coming
 through the door now, though. You sit down on the now-lonely piano
 stool to catch your breath.

 You are Maurice Ravel, noted composer. Many do not yet recognise your
 genius, but they will - they will - assuming you survive this night.
 You are slightly built and small of stature, but stronger than you
 appear, and your intelligence and determination should enable you to
 escape this deadly trap.

>examine window


 The window reaches almost from the ceiling to the floor. How often you
 have stared dreamy-eyed through it as you worked on your latest
 composition, watching the carriages rattle by on the street outside!
 This room is on the ground floor, but due to the unevenness of the
 land the house was built on, there is quite a drop to the pavement
 outside the window. The window is closed, barring access to the
 street.

 escape a zombie. A perhaps-fatal lack of foresight!

 It took you many years to amass this magnificent library. And yet in
 all your vast collection, there is not one book which tells you how to
 escape a zombie. A perhaps-fatal lack of foresight!

>about


 This game has a target audience of no one. I fear that anyone who
 knows enough about Maurice Ravel to be amused by the title also knows
 enough to realise I researched this game entirely on Wikipedia.
 Apologies to Ravel and his family for any unintentional
 misrepresentations of his character, music, and personal
 relationships.

 I, Emily Boegheim, wrote this unfortunate work of fiction, but it's
 Ryan Veeder's fault for egging me on. No beta-testers were harmed in
 the making of this game, unless it keeps Ryan awake tonight.

>xyzzy


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>dance


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine me


 You are Maurice Ravel, noted composer. Many do not yet recognise your
 genius, but they will - they will - assuming you survive this night.
 You are slightly built and small of stature, but stronger than you
 appear, and your intelligence and determination should enable you to
 escape this deadly trap.

>push piano out window


 I only understood you as far as wanting to push the grand piano
 outside.

>push piano outside


 The grand piano cannot be pushed from place to place.

>jump out winow

 <span class="floydstyle i">Study</span> (on the piano stool)
 Bookshelves line the walls of the room. It has taken you years, your
 entire life to build up this library, but now you must abandon it.
 Your grand piano stands heavily guarding the door into the room. The
 high window along the south wall is your only hope of escape, as your
 poor friend - now your zombified ex-friend - Claude Debussy lurks
 outside the door to the west.

>go west


 Such an action would be certain death!

>go east


 (first getting off the piano stool)
 You can't go that way.

>stand on stool


 You get onto the piano stool.

>look out window


 I only understood you as far as wanting to look outside.

>look outside


 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>go south


 There is too great a drop from the window to the ground; you fear you
 would injure yourself. If only there were something you could climb
 down onto!

>examine latch

 (your notes)
 There would be little point in putting your notes there.

>take book

>drop notes out window

>drop stool out window


 You lean through the window and carefully drop the piano stool onto
 the paving stones below. Fortunately it remains upright.

 You can't go that way.

 You can't go that way.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Street</span>
 Most days the street teems with life: carriages passing, hawkers
 shouting about their wares, people going about their business. Today
 it is strangely deserted.

 The piano stool stands helpfully beneath the window.

 The piano stool sits sadly under the window, divorced from the piano.

>go down


 You can't go that way.

>off


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go north


 You climb through the window and down onto the piano stool. It wobbles
 treacherously on the uneven paving stones, but you are able to keep
 your balance and scramble down to safety. The street is deserted -
 zombie Claude Debussy is still safely in the house, beating hopelessly
 on your study door. You have escaped!

 Motion disturbs the water.  Something falls from above, sinking down a
 long path down from sunlight to deepness.  A second something falls,
 overtaking the first, landing in the weeds with a force that stirs the
 sand.

 With no greater predator about, you rule these depths, and you are
 curious.  And hungry.

 An Interactive Fiction by Carolyn VanEseltine
 Release 1 / Serial number 131030 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Depths</span>
 Only sporadic shafts of sunlight penetrate to these lonesome depths.
 Long weeds rise from the sand to drift and tangle in the current.

 A dead human has come to rest among the weeds.

 A massive box lies on the sandy floor.  Several layers of rope wind
 about the box, binding it closed.

>examine human


 Dead humans are interesting.  You've eaten them before.  Humans change
 the world, and the world changes them in return, and the result is a
 fascinating, satisfying meal.

 Muffled vibrations come from within the massive box.

>eat dead human


 You sink your teeth into the human's meaty limb, severing hunk after
 tasty hunk with joyous abandon.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">In his final moments, there was nothing but rage, red and angry.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">He drew back his fist, snarling a threat that even he barely heard.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">The commander went pale beneath her rouge.  He was certain that he</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">would never strike her, but wondered (beneath that certainty) whether</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">he really might this time - he could not remember being so angry</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">before, so desperately, burningly angry.  The lips skinned back from</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">his teeth in a snarl and</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">SMASH! across the back of his head.  He never even saw where the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">blow came from.  There wasn't even pain, not really - just impact, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the ending of a life.</span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the
 currents.

 Muffled vibrations come from within the massive box.

>open box


 You nose at the box, but the rope holds it closed.  A few quick bites
 would solve that problem.

 Muffled vibrations come from within the massive box.

>bite rope


 Your powerful teeth slice neatly through the layers of rope, and the
 remanents fall easily away.

 A sharp vibration comes from the massive box, followed by a roiling
 mass of bubbles.  The bubbles send you spinning away, but you are
 nonetheless aware that a second human has emerged from the box.

 The new human is still alive.  Thrashing awkwardly, it propels itself
 up toward the sunlight.

>eat new human


 You can't see any such thing.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Depths</span>
 Only sporadic shafts of sunlight penetrate to these lonesome depths.
 Long weeds rise from the sand to drift and tangle in the current.

 A partially eaten human has come to rest among the weeds.

 A massive box lies on the sandy floor.  Its lid gapes open to reveal
 the empty interior.

 A dead human floats down and flops into the sand.  After a brief
 inspection, you confirm that this is the same human you discovered in
 the box.

>go up


 You're not done here yet.

>examine dead human


 Which do you mean, the short human from inside the box or the tall
 human from outside the box?

>eat dead human


 Which do you mean, the short human from inside the box or the tall

>eat tall human


 You push past the human's weak coverings to make a first foray on the
 soft, tasty innards.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">He thought, if he could trust anyone, he could trust Roselle -</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">until he looked to the bottom of his glass and saw the residue, the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">rust-red powder inflaming the wine.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">When he stood, the deck reeled under him, and he couldn't tell any</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">more whether it was inside or outside his head.  His skin felt</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">flushed, his head ached, the room spun.  What had she dosed him with?</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">What would it do to him?</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">And yet he struggled for control.  She had forfeited her share of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the profit, that was for certain, and her right to move freely about</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the cabin.  But perhaps things could be remedied, somehow - if he</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">could </span>think<span class="floydstyle em"> through the gathering haze - </span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the
 currents.

>eat short human


 You sink your teeth into the human's meaty limb, severing hunk after
 tasty hunk with joyous abandon.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">In her final moments, there was hope that she might live - a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">blazing, shining hope, filled with the struggle to climb through the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">water and the struggle to hold her breath.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">But she lost the second, and then she lost the first, and the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">water burned into her lungs.  It was a useless hope after all, a flash</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">in the pan like so many others - the aching capstone to a defeated</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">life.</span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the
 currents.

>eat tall human


 You burrow deeper, wriggling with delight as you gulp down mouthful
 after mouthful.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Over?" he echoed.  "What do you mean?"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"I mean what I said - " Gene looked sweaty, round, uncomfortable,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">not at all like a man who had just played him for the better part of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">twenty-three million.  "I need someone on board who listens.  Someone</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">who's got his shit together.  Someone who won't touch the cookie</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">jar."</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">And by their contract, under these circumstances - the contract he</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">had pushed for himself - Gene could take the company with him, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Jerry was screwed, screwed, screwed.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"What are you going to do, Jerry?"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"I'm going to kick your ass.  I'm going to wreck your car.  I'm</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">going to take a fucking cruise..." All the fight suddenly went out of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">him.  "I'm going to go home," he said, and he did.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Oddly, on the drive home, he thought: A cruise might not be a bad</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">idea.</span>

>eat tall human


 You turn your attention higher up the body, to the flappy cheeks and
 lips and nose and eyes.  You bite and tear and chew, savoring each
 delectable mouthful.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">"I could kill for a fix," he said, and then he didn't say it but</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">he thought it, and days and weeks and months later he stopped thinking</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">it.  One day he realized he didn't know when he last thought it, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">that was the day Gene said, "You know, you really got your shit</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">together in there.  I need someone like that, someone focused,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">organized, under control.  But someone who understands me, too.  I got</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">this idea,"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">and he listened, and his heart said no, no, no until his mouth</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">said yes.</span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the

>eat tall human


 Exerting your powerful jaws, you crack the human's skull and nuzzle
 away at the cavity within.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Somewhere beneath it all, he was always fourteen.  He was always</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">at the top of the stairs in his skeleton costume for Halloween, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the teachers were always walking past below, with the conversation</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">always drifting up the stairs like an evil spirit.  He was always</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">listening, even though he didn't want to hear.  He was always just</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">learning that they couldn't tell him apart from anyone else in the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">same costume.  That he was just another kid, here one year and gone</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the next.  That he was not special.  He was always just realizing that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">he would never be special.</span>

 Having consumed all the flesh off one human, you turn your attention
 to the other.

 You push past the human's weak coverings to make a first foray on the
 soft, tasty innards.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">Betrayal was barely a word she knew.  She was shocked when she</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">walked into the cabin and Jerry rounded on her, screaming, "What have</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you done to me!" She didn't lift a hand to stop the blow, though it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">drove her glasses into her face and knocked her sprawling into the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">dresser.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">His hands were so strong, lifting her up like a child, dropping</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">her down on a rough wooden surface.  The darkness was almost</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">comforting, before awareness registered - and by then he had slammed</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the lid down, and she heard something scraping on the outside of the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">box, over and over.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"You can stay there until La Ceiba," he snarled, ignoring her</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">protests.  And then he was gone, and the lid would not open, no matter</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">how she tried.</span>

 You burrow deeper, wriggling with delight as you gulp down mouthful

 <span class="floydstyle em">They had the same cabin, and they slept in the same bed, but</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">chastely, rarely keeping even the same hours.  And Jerry accepted it,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and his simple acceptance made her smile.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">He was in love with something else, of course - something darker</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and fiercer than she could ever be - and she felt sad for that, though</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">relieved that it kept his attentions at bay.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">She thought about that as he laughed above his wineglass, all</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">white teeth and sparkling eyes, and thought about it as she smiled</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">back.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">She didn't want his love.  She wouldn't have minded if she could</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">have it, if she could be capable of stealing it, but she didn't want</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">it.  But could she break his other love?  That might make his life</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">even better.  She didn't have the synthesis equipment with her, but</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">she could at least analyze her options.  Methadone, naltrexone,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">diamorphine - every treatment plan started somewhere.</span>

 You turn your attention higher up the body, to the flappy cheeks and

 delectable mouthful.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">The fire started after she cut the phone lines, and the house</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">burned to the ground.  Her sister's voice was higher-pitched than she</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">had ever heard it - "My god, Roselle, what were you thinking?</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Whatever were you thinking?"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">She'd been thinking, it would be so easy to make sure your awful</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">boss never calls you again on a weekend.  She'd been thinking, all it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">takes is scissors.  She'd been thinking, I have scissors.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">The cargo pants had giant pockets, and the scissors were still in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">her pocket.  If she slipped, they would go straight into her thigh.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">She didn't slip, or even move.  She stood quietly, instead, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">listened to her sister, and watched the scorched rubble smoke</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">softly.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Somewhere beneath it all, she was always twenty-seven, and she</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">never had her glasses because of the stupid bunny mask.  She was</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">always standing at the end of a stranger's driveway while the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">costumeless partied inside, always watching the cars drive past,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">squinting through the miserable blur in hope of seeing the van that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">would rescue her.  She was always standing by the grinning pumpkin</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">until the partygoers started leaving.  She was always twenty-seven,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and the van never came.</span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the

 You nose your way across the bones one last time, but there's nothing
 left to eat.
