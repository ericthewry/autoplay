 You open your eyes, feeling alive again, after being... dead?

 Who are you? You need time to remember.

 It's dark, but you can see.

 You are in a sinister place, you should be frightened. Or not?

 You are unbearably thirsty, but not for water.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Crypt</span> (in the coffin)
 Hidden in the bowels of the mountain, this chamber has hosted your
 immortal body for centuries, while your enemies spent their miserable
 days hunting you down at your castle. The coffin is on a stone
 pedestal at the centre of the room. On the ceiling is a fresco of the
 red sun of Valmar. To the east a narrow tunnel leads to the other
 rooms of your hideout.

 You're lying in the coffin, very weak. You struggle to keep your eyes
 open, while your necrotic flesh is recovering its former appearance.
 You feel a stab of pain, when you remember the stake drove through
 your heart. You should be dead, but you aren't. Something happened.

 My name is Marco Vallarino, I was born in 1977 in Imperia, where I
 live. I work as a journalist at the newspaper "Il Secolo XIX". I've
 written novels and short stories and I've published many books, but my
 real passion has always been interactive fiction. Since I was a kid,
 I've played tons of text adventures, in Italian and in English, and
 I've also tried writing some games, using first Qbasic and later on
 Inform 6.

 My personal website is at www.marcovallarino.it and I also have a page
 at IF Wiki: ifwiki.org/index.php/Marco_Vallarino.

 "Darkiss 1" is my second attempt at translating a game from Italian to
 English, with the help of the editors and playtesters Emilio
 Audissino, Jacob Gunness, Marco Innocenti (who also designed the
 cover), Paolo Lucchesi, Ottavia Pesenti, who I truly thank for their
 fantastic support.

 My other game available in English is the comedy "Save the Cheshire
 Cat!", which you can find at
 [<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=j6purjagso6i5b0.">LINK</A>]

 I'll be glad if you let me know what you think about the style and the
 design of the game, writing to marco.vallarino@gmail.com.

 For now, thanks for all the time you spend playing "Darkiss 1". Have
 fun!

>examine me


 You're the nightmare from which people can't wake.

 Dead twice. One by the hand of your maker, the second by the fiend who
 drove a stake through your heart while you were sleeping defenceless
 in your coffin.

 Alive thrice, it seems, although this last one shouldn't be possible.
 Something happened.

>inventory


 You are wearing:
 your suit
 your boots

>examine suit


 You are wearing a suit black like the darkness.

 There's a key in a pocket of the suit.

>examine key


 You can use it to unlock a locked door or something similar, if you
 find the right keyhole.

>examine boots


 Your boots are black and ready to step on everyone who dares to cross
 your way.

>examine coffin


 The coffin in which you are lying is cold and dark enough to satisfy a
 prince of darkness like you. It's almost a pity to leave it, but you
 have to get out to recover your energy and exact your revenge.

 The coffin is open.

>go up


 You get out of the coffin.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crypt</span>
 Hidden in the bowels of the mountain, this chamber has hosted your
 immortal body for centuries, while your enemies spent their miserable
 days hunting you down at your castle. The coffin is on a stone
 pedestal at the centre of the room. On the ceiling is a fresco of the
 red sun of Valmar. To the east a narrow tunnel leads to the other
 rooms of your hideout.

>examine fresco


 Painted on the ceiling shines the red sun of Valmar that lights up the
 dark nights of the vampires with its eight evil rays.

>examine sun

>examine pedestal


 The coffin lies on a massive block of black stone on which your name
 has been engraved: "Martin Voigt". There is also the ancient motto:
 "Nemo me impune lacessit". An expression that you reread with
 particular pleasure, waiting to transform it into a lethal reality.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tunnel</span>
 You're walking through the east-west tunnel which connects the crypt
 with the other rooms of the hideout. It is a narrow passage of
 irregular stone that nobody had dared to walk through before the
 arrival of the fools who (temporarily) put an end to your life.

 How much time has passed since then? Who cares! What are days, weeks,
 months, even years against the recovered eternity that will allow you
 to destroy your puny enemies and drink to their death in the next
 millennium?

>examine stone


 You're walking through the east-west tunnel which connects the crypt
 with the other rooms of the hideout. It is a narrow passage of
 irregular stone that nobody had dared to walk through before the
 arrival of the fools who (temporarily) put an end to your life.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bats room</span>
 You've reached the wide, octagonal chamber that is at the centre of
 the hideout. The walls and the ceiling are covered with menacing black
 bats, painted on the background of a gloomy cave, with stalactites and
 stalagmites scattered everywhere.

 While you look around trying to remember something more about
 yourself, hundreds of little yellow eyes seem to stare malevolently at
 you, without recognising you as the ancient master of this creepy
 dungeon. But when you regain your strength, a billion sinister wing
 beats will clap for the return of the prince of darkness.

 To the west you may return to the crypt; to the north, east and south
 three dark passages lead to the other rooms of the hideout.

 At the centre of the chamber, on a low pedestal of grey stone, you can
 see a white wooden coffin, decorated with the images of red roses and
 the letters S. C.

 The coffin is closed.

>examine bats


 Probably the bats were drawn by yourself. You have always had a
 passion for painting that over the centuries you have been able to
 cultivate with great effort, achieving - as in this case - remarkable
 results. At the moment you don't remember for which reason you decided
 to cover the walls with bats, however there are a lot, although you
 can't say exactly how many. By the way, you can try to count them, if
 you want.

>count bats


 Led by a sudden curiosity, you start to count the bats drawn on the
 walls to know exactly how many they are. However, after a while, you
 lose count and have to start over again. Your excellent sight in the
 dark is still too weak and you can't focus  for more than a few
 seconds. At the end, there seem to be 103 bats.

>examine coffin


 A deeper examination of the coffin reveals that it is the place in
 which your latest lover rested. A graceful girl named Sabrina, with
 whom you spent exquisitely pleasant moments, slowly sucking her veins
 dry while she waited for the dark gift that would make her eternally
 young and beautiful.

 But you enjoyed drinking her sweet blood too much to decide to turn
 her into a vampire. Every day you ordered your minions to take care of
 her, making her recover the energy lost during the past night with
 banquets and transfusions, so that you could drink again at the
 delicious spring of her jugular, when the sun set. In order to make
 her available at all times, you had even brought her to your hideout,
 hosting her in this wooden coffin that you decorated yourself so
 beautifully.

 Who knows if she managed to escape the fury of your persecutors.
 However, the fact that the coffin lid, usually open, has been closed
 and firmly nailed down doesn't bode well.

>open coffin.


 The coffin lid is nailed down, it's unlikely that you can take it off
 with your bare hands.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spiders room</span>
 The unpleasant sensation of not being alone is the first thing you
 felt when you entered this room. Painted on the walls, the floor and
 the ceiling, the giant spiders that surround you make for a rather
 disquieting company, even for you. Although perfectly still and little
 more than stylised drawings, they appear to be extraordinarily alive
 with shiny yellow eyes and wide open mandibles, ready to tangle you up
 in the huge web that envelops the room to devour you like a bug.

 To the south you may return to the bats room, to the east and to the
 west you can explore other rooms of the hideout, to the north you see
 a solid iron door.

>open door


 What combination do you want to try to open the door?

>examine door


 The solid iron door at the centre of the northern wall seems to be the
 panel of a giant safe. Without keyhole, in its centre it has four
 small wheels with numbers from 0 to 9 that, knowing the right
 combination, should serve to open the door by turning the handle set
 at their side. Unfortunately you have no idea what the combination
 could be. You only know that you never succeeded in memorizing it, so
 it's possible that you've left a hint somewhere to remember it.

 The door is closed.

 As the bats, also these spiders have been drawn by you. You have
 always had a passion for painting that over the centuries you have
 been able to cultivate with great effort, achieving - as in this case
 - remarkable results. At the moment you don't remember for which
 reason you decided to cover the walls with spiders, however there are

 lose count and have to start over again. Your excellent sight in the
 dark is still too weak and you cannot focus for more than a few
 seconds. At the end, there seem to be 69 spiders.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library room</span>
 There are so many books on the shelves of your library that, for a
 moment, it seems really incredible that you have read, or even just
 browsed through, all of them. Then you remember you have always been a
 voracious reader: over the centuries these books have been your best
 friends, helping you with their engaging stories to cope with the
 loneliness in which every vampire is forced to spend most of his life.

 At the centre of the room is a desk still covered with papers; behind
 it you can see a priceless human-skin armchair. To the east you return
 to the spiders room.

>count books


 Aren't you tired to freak out?

>examine books


 Actually the amount of books that you see here is only a small part of
 that, certainly bigger, collection that you amassed over the centuries
 in the library room of your castle. However, between the most recent
 volumes, there are all the most famous vampire tales written by Bram
 Stoker, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, John William Polidori, Charles
 Nodier, Marcel Schwob, Stanislaus Eric Stenbock, Julian Osgood Field,
 Anne Rice, Richard R. McCammon and Fred Saberhagen.

 There are also the frightful stories of Edgar Allan Poe, Ambrose
 Bierce, Howard Phillips Lovecraft, Stephen King, Clive Barker and the
 delirious works of Franz Kafka, Tommaso Landolfi and Dino Buzzati.

 However there is no trace of the Necronomicon, the black magic book
 that you used to celebrate profane rites and bloody tributes to Valmar
 and the other mighty gods of the night. You seem to recall that you
 left it in the library room of your castle. Then you realise with
 horror that it might have been stolen by your killers. Eventually, you
 convince yourself that you must have hidden it somewhere else,
 although you don't remember where.

>examine armchair


 The human skin armchair is a piece of furniture of inestimable value.
 Actually you don't even remember whom you skinned to make it, but
 surely it had to be one of your arch-enemies, so every time you sit in
 it you feel a great pleasure.

>sit on it


 You have too many thing to do to flop out on the armchair.

>smell armchair


 You can only smell the smell of death which has been surrounding you
 for a thousand years now.

>examine papers


 Many of the papers scattered on the desk are the purchase agreements
 of the houses that you bought all over the world, to have a secure
 shelter everywhere. However, between the agreements, you find a paper
 with a mysterious word written on it: "SBYS". Surely a note you took
 to remind yourself of an important thing.

>examine desk


 Under the surface of the desk (still covered with papers) you see a
 drawer.

>open drawer


 You open the drawer, revealing a medallion.

>examine medallion


 The medallion has your name carved on: "Martin Voigt". It is attached
 to a small chain that allows to wear it.

 Suddenly it comes to your mind that there should be a secret passage
 in the library room, behind a shelf.

>wear medallion


 (first taking the medallion)
 You put on the medallion.

>examine shelf


 Placed on the walls, the shelves of your library are full of the books
 that you read over the centuries, to fight the loneliness that grips
 every vampire.

 There are some scratches on the floor, near the western shelf.

>move western shelf


 You are still too weak to move one of the shelves.

>examine scratches


 The scratches on the floor are near the western shelf.

 Suddenly it comes to your mind that "SBYS" may mean Snakes by Spiders.

>search papers

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spiders room</span>

 that surround you make for a rather disquieting company, even for you.
 Although perfectly still and little more than stylised drawings, they
 appear to be extraordinarily alive with shiny yellow eyes and wide
 open mandibles.

 To the south you may return to the bats room, to the east and to the
 west you can explore other rooms of the hideout, to the north you see
 a solid iron door.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple</span>
 You are in a small painted black room that appears to be a temple. You
 can see a kneeling stool in front of a large painting with a golden
 frame, hung on the back wall. The subject of the picture is a very
 beautiful lady, with a pale face and long dark hair, who stares at you
 with a sensual expression. After a moment, you remember she is Lilith,
 the gorgeous and cruel vampire who, more than a thousand years ago,
 threw you in this bloody abyss of darkness, letting you drink her
 blood after having pierced your jugular with her long, sharp canines
 so many times.

 Much time has passed since then, but you never forgot the encounter
 that changed your life (and your death) forever. Hence you created
 this place of prayer to keep in contact with her, certain that one day
 Lilith will answer to your invocations and return to you. To the west
 a passage leads to the spiders room.

>summon Lilith


 You join your hands and start to pray for the return of Lilith, but
 nothing happens.

>pray


 You join your hands and start to pray for the return of Lilith,
 without anything happening.

>examine lilith


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine painting


 Probably it was you who painted this picture, to keep a memory of the
 image of the woman who turned you into an immortal creature with great
 powers. Lilith was really wonderful and you fell in love at first
 sight. You were 26 years old when she appeared, and you had already
 had much experience with women. As the young descendant of one of the
 richest family in the region, you were the object of desire of all the
 girls of the territory, who did all that they could to get your
 attention. To you, one was equal to the other, you continuously
 changed lovers to gather new experience, thinking only of having as
 much fun as possible. When Lilith arrived, everything changed.

 The first time you saw her was at a party thrown by your family to let
 you meet new people, in the hope that you would eventually meet the
 woman of your life. She came to the house in the evening, with a
 cousin whose name you didn't even remember. She was very beautiful and
 her unusual vivacity fascinated you immediately. The freshness of her
 appearance made her look very young, but she talked as if she were
 already highly experienced. When you finally managed to be alone with
 her, you took her hand for a walk in the woods, where nobody would
 disturb you.

 You thought that such an exuberant girl wouldn't have any objections
 about there in the woods, away from prying eyes. Instead it was her
 who took you. When you saw her eyes change their colour to red like
 two rubies and her cuspids become monstrously long fangs, it was too
 late to go back. However you are grateful to Lilith for not allowing
 you to run away. You could have never imagined the pleasure you felt
 when she pierced your neck with her teeth and sucked your blood almost
 to the last drop.

 Lilith disappeared right after, but she came back to meet you many
 other nights, in your house garden or directly in your room, when you
 would open the window and invite her to come in and drink your blood
 again. Even she grew fond of you: after drinking your blood for weeks,
 to prevent your death she decided to give you the dark gift that would
 turn you into an immortal night wanderer. Then she vanished forever,
 leaving you to your destiny with the memory of her fiery eyes and
 eager lips.

 leaving you to your destiny with the memory of her fiery eyes and

>examine stool


 On this kneeling stool you spent entire nights praying for the return
 of Lilith. On the shelf you also carved the phrase "Gutta cavat
 lapidem" to spur you to persist and not lose hope of finding your
 lover.

>look behind painting


 You can't see any such thing.

>move painting


 It's better to leave that at its stead.

>examine shelf


 You can't see any such thing.

>search painting


 You find nothing of interest.

 that surround you make for a rather disquieting company, even for you.
 Although perfectly still and little more than stylised drawings, they
 appear to be extraordinarily alive with shiny yellow eyes and wide
 open mandibles.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bats room</span>
 You've reached the wide, octagonal chamber that is at the centre of
 the hideout. The walls and the ceiling are covered with menacing black
 bats, painted on the background of a gloomy cave, with stalactites and
 stalagmites scattered everywhere. To the west you may return to the
 crypt; to the north, east and south three dark passages lead to the
 other rooms of the hideout.

 At the centre of the chamber, on a low pedestal of grey stone, you can
 see the white wooden coffin, in which Sabrina, your latest lover,
 rested. It is decorated with the images of red roses and the letters
 S. C.

 The coffin is closed.

>go east


 You try to go to east, but you have to halt when you see the big white
 cross painted on the floor. An obstacle that is insurmountable for
 you, placed by someone who wants to prevent you from leaving your
 hideout.

>examine cross


 Simply frightening.

>erase cross


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>summon Sabrina


 First you should open the coffin.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Snakes room</span>
 If you weren't more than accustomed to horrific views of death and
 destruction, what is under your feet would make you jump back. Painted
 on the floor, snakes of every colour and size crawl and coil on each
 other, creating an apparently entangled mess. Some of them also climb
 onto the walls, brushing against the ceiling and making seemingly
 meaningless drawings.

 While you look at the forked tongues projecting out of their mouths,
 you seem to hear them hissing: they curse those who reduced you to
 such a miserable form and ask for your return onto the throne of
 darkness. To the north there is the passage that goes to the bats
 room, to the south a solid wooden door (without a keyhole), to the
 east and to the west the entrances to two other rooms.

>count snakes


 Led by a sudden curiosity, you start to count the snakes drawn on the
 floor to know exactly how many they are. However, after a while, you
 lose count and have to start over again. Your excellent sight in the
 dark is still too weak and you can't focus for more than a few
 seconds. At the end, there seem to be 104 snakes.

>examine snakes


 As the bats and the spiders, also these snakes were drawn by yourself.
 You have always had a passion for painting that over the centuries you
 have been able to cultivate with great effort, achieving - as in this
 case - remarkable results. At the moment you don't remember for which
 reason you decided to cover the walls with snakes, however there are a
 lot, although you can't say exactly how many.

>examine door


 The solid wooden door on the southern wall of the snakes room is
 curiously without any keyhole. However, at its side is a lever that
 may allow you to open (and close) it.

 The door is closed.

>pull lever


 It seems to be stuck.

>push lever


 Try to pull it.

>examine lever


 The lever is in the high position, you can try to pull it and set it
 in the low position.

 At its side is a slot.

>examine slot


 The slot is a little vertical opening near the door.

 It's possible to insert something into it, if you have an object small
 enough.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Torture chamber</span>
 Although many years have passed since the last time you used these
 amazing devices of pain and death, the torture chamber still smells of
 the fear and blood of the poor wretches that ended up here. If you
 concentrate, you can hear their screams, which still gives you a fit
 of pleasure.

 A threatening iron maiden is at the centre of the room. Between the
 chains hanging from the ceiling, you see a breaking wheel and a
 pillory. There is also a rusty cage, in which you enjoyed to lock -
 this you remember well - the mates of the people you were torturing.
 So they could see what they would soon endure. To the east you may
 return to the snakes room.

 You can see a bottle of liquor and a black leather mask here.

>concentrate


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine mask


 This is the leather mask that you liked to wear while you tortured
 your prisoners. Painted on it there is a horrible skull, which makes
 it even more frightful.

>examine liquor


 With this bottle of liquor you liked to disinfect the wounds of your
 prisoners, after scattering salt on them. On the label there is a
 skull that is a quite significant indicator of its alcohol by volume.

>listen


 Around you, there is an absolute and distressing silence.

>take mask and bottle


 black leather mask: Taken.
 bottle of liquor: Taken.

>examine cage


 In this cage you used to lock up your prisoners to show them the
 horrible tortures that you inflicted on their mates.

 The cage is closed.

 In the cage is a skeleton.

>examine skeleton


 Looking at those fetid bones, you suddenly remember the reverend
 Maximilian Bauer. Another fool who ignited your anger by attempting to
 destroy you with an exorcism. You sentenced him to be eaten alive by
 rats. Probably, when you caught him and locked in the cage, he thought
 he would be "only" tortured and killed by starvation, as many others
 before him. But you felt so inspired that night that you decided to
 use your telepathic powers to set up a memorable execution. It is
 impossible to forget his face when he saw the horde of rats entering
 the torture chamber and then filling up the cage, feasting upon him...

>examine maiden


 Considered one of the most amazing torture devices in human history,
 the iron maiden is an iron cabinet with a hinged front and
 spike-covered interior, tall enough to accommodate a human being. The
 spikes can pierce the victim's body without damaging the vital organs,
 thus causing the victim to slowly and dreadfully bleed to death.
 Actually, your prisoners had already bled dry enough at the time when
 you locked them up in the iron maiden. However it was wonderful to
 listen to their cries while the spikes tore them apart.

 The iron maiden is closed.

>open it


 You open the iron maiden. It's empty, but the view of the spikes is
 delicious.

>examine spikes


 The spikes are rusty, blood encrusted, very long and sharp... It's
 really a pity you have no prisoner to close into the iron maiden.

 There is some blonde hair caught on the spikes.

>examine hair


 The long blonde hair you are looking at probably belonged to Sandra
 Koch. She was a vampire hunter who wanted to revenge the death of her
 sister Samantha, killed by you in Vienna. Captured by your servants
 while she was looking for your hideout, she indeed found you but this
 wasn't good news for her.

 Struck by her beauty and her rebel attitude, you spent a lot of nights
 drinking her blood and torturing her endlessly, pulling out of her
 every kind of shriek. Eventually she asked for death as a relief and
 you decided to give her a really impressive execution, locking her up
 in the iron maiden.

 Probably, when you got her out of it, some hair got caught on the
 spikes. You cut her body to pieces and gave it to the wolves that
 infested the mountain slope, then you smiled and shouted in the night:
 "Next!"

>take hair


 Taken.

>examine wheel


 The breaking wheel looks painful.

>examine pillory


 The pillory is secured to the floor with a sturdy iron base.

 The pillory is closed.

>open it


 You open the pillory, regretting that you have nobody to lock up in
 it, then you close it with the certainty that soon you'll use it
 again.

>examine cage


 In this cage you used to lock up your prisoners to show them the
 horrible tortures that you inflicted on their mates.

 The cage is closed.

 In the cage is a skeleton.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Depository</span>
 You are in a room lacking decorations that seems to be a sort a
 storage room, where you kept your clothes and the tools that you could
 need when you were in action. A big wardrobe is on the back wall,
 while on the floor you see a heavy chest. To the west you may return
 to the snakes room.

>examine wardrobe


 It's closed.

>open it


 You open the wardrobe, revealing a black cloak.

>examine cloak


 With this black cloak on, you carried out your bloodiest actions,
 spreading terror all over the world and destroying anyone who dared to
 oppose your dark supremacy. The view of it alone gives you strength
 and you are sure that wearing it again could help you regain all your
 energy.

>take cloak


 Taken.

>wear it


 You wear the cloak and you feel stronger.

>wear mask


 Wearing the mask you can still feel the smell of the blood and the
 fear of the prisoners whom you tortured.

>enter wardrobe


 You have nothing to do inside the wardrobe.

>open chest


 You open the chest, revealing an axe.

>examine axe


 Your eyes shine while you look at the axe you used to cut to pieces

 You've reached the wide, octagonal chamber that is at the centre of

 other rooms of the hideout.

 At the centre of the chamber, on a low pedestal of grey stone, you can

 The solid iron door at the centre of the northern wall seems to be the
 panel of a giant safe. Without keyhole, in its centre it has four
 small wheels with numbers from 0 to 9 that, knowing the right
 combination, should serve to open the door by turning the handle set
 at their side. Unfortunately you have no idea what the combination
 could be. You only know that you never succeeded in memorizing it, so
 it's possible that you've left a hint somewhere to remember it.

 The door is closed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Treasure room</span>
 Your hideout wouldn't be complete without a place for storing your
 treasures. Your minions have always been too curious and bold for your
 liking, so you had this big and impregnable safe made that, as you
 predicted, perfectly resisted the attack of your killers. The room is
 indeed full of treasures. Maybe, if you had also protected the access
 to your crypt with such a security door, you wouldn't have ended up so
 bad.

 Actually, you're almost glad to have been murdered so horribly
 because, now that you are alive again, you can plan a terrible
 revenge. To the south you may return to the spiders room.

 The treasures stored in this room form a shiny heap of golden and

 all over the world, that you will soon haunt again.

>recite formula


 Stretching out your arms to receive the occult forces that you are
 going to summon, you recite the magic formula found among the graffiti
 in the cell. A mysterious sorcery that you didn't know before today.
 However, it seems to work well: when you finish to utter the words of
 the formula, Sabrina's ghost appears in front of you, exiting from the
 mouth of her corpse.

 "Oh, Martin!" exclaims the sepulchral apparition. "Have you seen what
 those bastards did to me? It was professor Anderson and his gang,
 those who already came to look for you at my village. They eventually
 found our hideout. They arrived to the camp in the morning. They were
 a lot and well-armed, your minions were taken by surprise and they
 were overpowered and slain in few hours."

 "I was spared only to suffer a worse fate" continues the spectre.
 "They knew who I was and said that I would have a special treatment.
 They ripped my clothes off and shaved my hair off, before whipping me
 and beating me up to allow me to 'expiate my sins'. Then they branded
 me with the vampire symbol. When they brought me here, I had gone
 through so much pain I couldn't stay on foot. Before burying me alive
 in the coffin, they forced me to attend your execution and that was
 the most horrible moment."

 "I tried to advise you of their coming" says Sabrina after a pause
 caused by the tension that those terrible memories still cause in her.
 "I shouted and shouted with all my breath, while we walked through the
 tunnel leading to your crypt. But you were sleeping, you couldn't wake
 up, so they killed you merciless. Now, seeing you alive again is a
 great joy for me because I'm sure that my death will be revenged
 together with yours and who did us wrong will die in horrible pain.
 Maybe, one day, you'll find the way to get me out of this damned
 place, where there's no escape from suffering and everything burns,
 burns, buuurns!"

 Suddenly Sabrina's corpse and the coffin catch fire in front of you,
 as if they have been reached by the same hell flames that tortured the
 girl's soul. While you look at the fire burning up, you seem to see
 Sabrina's spirit leave this reality to return to the netherworld.

 A threatening iron maiden is at the centre of the room. Between the

 So they could see what they would soon endure. To the east you may

 Written in blood and bound with human skin, the Necronomicon is a

 visit the frightful places of the netherworld, were killed by the same
 forces they had tried to dominate. But you, who don't fear the death
 because you're already dead, have always known how to take advantage
 of the power of Necronomicon. A quick look at the book index is enough
 to find what you need: the spell to summon Praseidimio, a powerful
 demon who already helped you in the past. To have him at your service
 again, you just have to call his name.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple</span>
 You are in a small painted black room that appears to be a temple. You
 can see a kneeling stool in front of a large painting with a golden
 frame, hung on the back wall. The subject of the picture is Lilith,
 the gorgeous and cruel vampire who, more than a thousand years ago,
 threw you in this bloody abyss of darkness, letting you drink her
 blood after having pierced your jugular with her long, sharp canines
 so many times.

 Much time has passed since then, but you never forgot the encounter
 that changed your life (and your death) forever. Hence you created
 this place of prayer to keep in contact with her, certain that one day
 Lilith will answer to your invocations and return to you. To the west
 a passage leads to the spiders room.

>pray


 You join your hands and start to pray for the return of Lilith,
 without anything happening.

>recite formula


 You recite the magic formula but nothing happens.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spiders room</span>
 Painted on the walls, the floor and the ceiling, the giant spiders
 that surround you make for a rather disquieting company, even for you.
 Although perfectly still and little more than stylised drawings, they
 appear to be extraordinarily alive with shiny yellow eyes and wide
 open mandibles.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library room</span>
 The books that fill the shelves of your library have been your best
 friends over the centuries. With their engaging stories they helped
 you to cope with the loneliness in which every vampire is forced to
 spend most of his life. At the centre of the room is a desk still
 covered with papers; behind it you can see a priceless human-skin
 armchair. To the east you return to the spiders room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bats room</span>
 You've reached the wide, octagonal chamber that is at the centre of
 the hideout. The walls and the ceiling are covered with menacing black

 other rooms of the hideout.

 east.

>go east


 The white cross drawn on the floor prevents you from going to east.

 Do you want to ask Praseidimio to help you overcome the cross? (y/n)

>y


 Praseidimio refuses to fulfil your wish, saying that you can overcome
 the cross on your own.

>examine fire


 It's a terrible sight that makes you understand how lucky you are to
 be an immortal evil vampire, who'll never goes to burn to hell.

 Praseidimio fluctuates around you, eager to give his contribution to

 Although many years have passed since the last time you used these
 amazing devices of pain and death, the torture chamber still smells of
 the fear and blood of the poor wretches that ended up here. If you
 concentrate, you can hear their screams, which still gives you a fit
 of pleasure.

 A threatening iron maiden is at the centre of the room. Between the
 chains hanging from the ceiling, you see a breaking wheel and a
 pillory. There is also a rusty cage, in which you enjoyed to lock -
 this you remember well - the mates of the people you were torturing.
 So they could see what they would soon endure. To the east you may
 return to the snakes room.

 You tie the stripes to the bone and roll them around one of its

 you have to find some fuel and, obviously, a fire.

 your minions on the mountain slope, while they tried to achieve their

 the deepest darkness for days and nights, without food and water,
 until you felt inspired enough to take care of them. The walls, the
 ceiling, the floor and also the door have been covered with graffiti -
 some of which written in blood - that report curses and prayers of
 every kind, all unheard, seemingly. The exit that leads to the snakes
 room is to the north.

 The small chain of your medallion hangs from the slot at the side of

 Nothing obvious happens.

 "Think well to what wish to make" says Praseidimio. "As you know, we

 You sing a song to the devil, without achieving any (apparent) help.

 Praseidimio follows you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bats room</span>
 You've reached the wide, octagonal chamber that is at the centre of
 the hideout. The walls and the ceiling are covered with menacing black
 bats, painted on the background of a gloomy cave, with stalactites and
 stalagmites scattered everywhere. To the west you may return to the
 crypt; to the north, east and south three dark passages lead to the
 other rooms of the hideout.

 Praseidimio is at your side, ready to give his contribution to the

 At the centre of the room is a coffin on fire, in which the corpse of

 A big white cross painted on the floor blocks the passage that goes to
 east.

 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library room</span>
 The books that fill the shelves of your library have been your best
 friends over the centuries. With their engaging stories they helped
 you to cope with the loneliness in which every vampire is forced to
 spend most of his life. At the centre of the room is a desk still
 covered with papers; behind it you can see a priceless human-skin
 armchair. To the east you return to the spiders room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Secret room</span>
 This hiding place was designed to protect a very important item: your
 copy of Necronomicon, the very rare black magic book that allows to
 summon demons and reach the most frightful dimensions of the universe.
 The volume is where you left it, on a lectern at the centre of the
 room. It seems to invite you to use its occult powers again. To the
 east you may return to the library room.

 Actually the amount of books that you see here is only a small part of
 that, certainly bigger, collection that you amassed over the centuries
 in the library room of your castle. However, between the most recent
 volumes, there are all the most famous vampire tales written by Bram
 Stoker, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, John William Polidori, Charles
 Nodier, Marcel Schwob, Stanislaus Eric Stenbock, Julian Osgood Field,
 Anne Rice, Richard R. McCammon and Fred Saberhagen.

 There are also the frightful stories of Edgar Allan Poe, Ambrose
 Bierce, Howard Phillips Lovecraft, Stephen King, Clive Barker and the
 delirious works of Franz Kafka, Tommaso Landolfi and Dino Buzzati.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Treasure room</span>
 Your hideout wouldn't be complete without a place for storing your
 treasures. Your minions have always been too curious and bold for your
 liking, so you had this big and impregnable safe made that, as you
 predicted, perfectly resisted the attack of your killers. The room is
 indeed full of treasures. To the south you may return to the spiders
 room.

 Praseidimio is at your side, ready to give his contribution to the

 The treasures stored in this room form a shiny heap of golden and
 silver coins, jewels, precious stones, that overflows the chests and

 items of inestimable value. It is a wealth conquered in over one
 thousand years of life, that also includes a lot of houses scattered
 all over the world, that you will soon haunt again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple</span>
 You are in a small painted black room that appears to be a temple. You
 can see a kneeling stool in front of a large painting with a golden
 frame, hung on the back wall. The subject of the picture is Lilith,
 the gorgeous and cruel vampire who, more than a thousand years ago,
 threw you in this bloody abyss of darkness, letting you drink her
 blood after having pierced your jugular with her long, sharp canines
 so many times.

 Much time has passed since then, but you never forgot the encounter
 that changed your life (and your death) forever. Hence you created
 this place of prayer to keep in contact with her, certain that one day
 Lilith will answer to your invocations and return to you. To the west
 a passage leads to the spiders room.

 You are in a room lacking decorations that seems to be a sort a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cell</span>
 Many of the wretches that wanted to put an end to your atrocities
 spent their last hours of life here, waiting to see what fate they
 would face, after daring to oppose to your wicked supremacy. Caught by
 your minions on the mountain slope, while they tried to achieve their
 silly goals, they had been locked up in this narrow cell and left in
 the deepest darkness for days and nights, without food and water,
 until you felt inspired enough to take care of them. The walls, the
 ceiling, the floor and also the door have been covered with graffiti -
 some of which written in blood - that report curses and prayers of
 every kind, all unheard, seemingly. The exit that leads to the snakes
 room is to the north.

 Although many years have passed since the last time you used these
 amazing devices of pain and death, the torture chamber still smells of
 the fear and blood of the poor wretches that ended up here. If you
 concentrate, you can hear their screams, which still gives you a fit
 of pleasure.

 A threatening iron maiden is at the centre of the room. Between the
 chains hanging from the ceiling, you see a breaking wheel and a
 pillory. There is also a rusty cage, in which you enjoyed to lock -
 this you remember well - the mates of the people you were torturing.
 So they could see what they would soon endure. To the east you may
 return to the snakes room.

 You aren't convinced that the bats are exactly 103, so you decide to

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple</span>
 You are in a small painted black room that appears to be a temple. You
 can see a kneeling stool in front of a large painting with a golden
 frame, hung on the back wall. The subject of the picture is Lilith,
 the gorgeous and cruel vampire who, more than a thousand years ago,
 threw you in this bloody abyss of darkness, letting you drink her
 blood after having pierced your jugular with her long, sharp canines
 so many times.

 Much time has passed since then, but you never forgot the encounter
 that changed your life (and your death) forever. Hence you created
 this place of prayer to keep in contact with her, certain that one day
 Lilith will answer to your invocations and return to you. To the west
 a passage leads to the spiders room.

>kneel


 You kneel on the stool, in front of the painting of Lilith.

>pray


 Kneeling in front of her picture, you pray for the return of Lilith.
 You need her more than ever, at this moment of great difficulty. At
 the beginning you can't find the words, then you remember the
 invocations repeated for centuries, waiting for the return of the only
 woman that is really important for you. Often, many hours would pass
 before you got up, without anything happening.

 Rather unusually, this time, as you've just started to repeat your
 supplications the picture of the vampire comes to life and starts
 speaking, emanating a diabolical halo of red light: "Martin Voigt, how
 much time has passed since the last time we met? Your death grieved me
 and I'm glad to have you in my sight again."

 You smile, but Lilith frowns at you and says: "I know you're happy to
 see me again, but this is no time for love. If you think I'm the one
 who performed the magic that brought you to life, you're right. If you
 think I did it to allow you to accomplish your goal of revenge, you're
 wrong. I've a more ambitious and lethal project for you."

 "Unfortunately you still seem to be very weak" she continues. "I doubt
 you can go further in such a feeble state. Maybe I have to give you
 another bit of help to let you recover your energy and leave your
 hideout. But, first, I have to verify that you still know the basis of
 our history. If you give the correct answer to my question, I shall
 instill in you the power to overcome one of the obstacles set in your
 way... How many rays has the red sun of Valmar that lights up the dark
 nights of us vampires?"

>8


 "You're right, my dear!" says Lilith. "I congratulate you on your
 memory, it seems that your powers haven't weakened that much in these
 years of oblivion. However, to help you overcome the obstacles that
 bar your way to freedom, I'll offer you my curse."

 The charming vampire points her finger at you and instills in you a
 new, wicked energy.

 "Now you may fearlessly face the symbols and the spells that your
 enemies set in your way" she explains. "When you come out, forget your
 foolish plan of revenge and come to me at the Yoshiwara Club. I'm
 gathering the largest army of vampires in history, to prepare for the
 battle that will lead us to subdue humankind. Soon we'll turn the most
 frightening fantasies into reality and take what should have long been
 ours: the world!"

 "Don't worry now about the road to the Yoshiwara Club, at the right
 moment the Love will drive you there" ends Lilith, before vanishing in
 a final blinding flash of red light.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 You'll have to get off the kneeling stool first.

 stalagmites scattered everywhere. To the west you may return to the
 crypt; to the north, east and south three dark passages lead to the
 other rooms of the hideout.

 Praseidimio is at your side, ready to give his contribution to the
 triumph of evil over good.

 At the centre of the room is a coffin on fire, in which the corpse of
 your lover Sabrina is burning.

 A big white cross has been painted on the floor of the passage that
 goes to east.

>go east


 Protected by the curse received from Lilith, you easily overcome the
 white cross painted on the floor and proceed to east, followed by
 Praseidimio.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 Beyond the cross drawn on the floor to impede your passage, there is a
 narrow corridor that goes from west to east. It connects the bats room
 with the stone steps that should lead out of your hideout, towards the
 dark maze of caves that hides its entry. On the floor, the ceiling and
 the walls, you can see many other magic symbols. They have been drawn
 to avoid your escape, but their effect on you is nullified by Lilith's
 curse.

 Praseidimio is at your side, ready to give his contribution to the
 triumph of evil over good.

 The impossibility of seeing your image reflected in a mirror is one of
 the things that you hate most about your vampire condition. So the
 gigantic mirror that is in your way towards your freedom, to the east,
 is a horrible view to you. Your persecutors thought of everything to
 keep you imprisoned in your own hideout. The mirror is too large to be
 covered, bypassed or climbed upon, so you have to find a way to
 destroy it, if you want to leave the hideout.

>break mirror


 The axe hits the mirror without scratching it. Clearly it's
 unbreakable.

 Praseidimio fluctuates around you, eager to give his contribution to
 the triumph of evil over good.

>enter mirror


 That's not something you can enter.

>burn mirror


 I doubt it's useful to set fire to the mirror.

 Praseidimio fluctuates around you, eager to give his contribution to
 the triumph of evil over good.

>examine mirror


 The mirror is too frightening for you to examine it carefully.
 However, it's too large to be covered, bypassed or climbed upon, so
 you have to find a way to destroy it, if you want to leave the
 hideout.

 "Think well to what wish to make" says Praseidimio. "As you know, we
 demons are very powerful and we don't like to be disturbed for
 trifles."

>go east


 The mirror blocks your way.

 Do you want to ask Praseidimio to help you to break the mirror? (y/n)

>y


 Praseidimio stares at the mirror uncertain. Being near him you see
 that his image too isn't reflected but he doesn't seem to care about
 it. Probably a small gesture would be enough for him to break the
 mirror, as it was for you when you were at the top of your strength.

 At last, acknowledging that it's a problem too difficult to solve for
 a vampire in such a bad condition, the demon agrees to grant your
 wish. He points one of his shapeless excrescences to the mirror and
 breaks it, scattering its small fragments on the floor.

 "You've been satisfied" says Praseidimio, before disappearing in a
 cloud of red smoke. "Now go on with your revenge. And may the red sun
 of Valmar shine on your dark nights of vampire!"

 [Your score has just gone up by seven points.]

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave</span>
 Through a twisty maze of tunnels, you've reached the cave that leads
 out of mountain bowels, to the east. Just another effort and you'll be
 free to go to Lilith at the Yoshiwara Club and accomplish your
 revenge. However, to the west you can return to the dark gallery that
 takes to your hideout.

 A big black wolf stands between you and the exit.

>examine wolf


 Having come in to have a shelter for the night, the animal must be
 very hungry. Its fangs are longer and pointier than yours: leaving the
 cave without being eaten won't be easy. The wolf seems to have "smelt"
 your supernatural origin and this could have enraged it even more.
 Trying to bypass it seems to be impossible, and you're still too weak
 to attack it. Maybe, if you find the way to appease it, you can pass.

 The wolf growls at you.

>bite wolf


 You aren't strong enough to face the wolf.

 The wolf growls at you.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
 a torch
 a violin bow
 a violin
 a bottle of liquor

 You are wearing:
 a medallion
 a black cloak
 a black leather mask
 your suit
   an iron key
 your boots

 You also have:
 a curse
 a magic formula

 The wolf howls and looks at you with hateful eyes.

>burn wolf


 The wolf is too fast for you to burn it with the torch. Besides, he
 doesn't seem to be scared by the fire.

 The wolf howls and looks at you with hateful eyes.

>play violin


 You play some very sweet music that calms the wolf and makes it fall
 asleep.

 [Your score has just gone up by eight points.]

>bite wolf


 It would be a coward's deed to attack a sleeping wolf.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mountain slope</span>
 Outside the cave, every sense of yours is assaulted by the garlic
 flowers planted all around the entrance. A new attempt to block your
 escape from the mountain bowels, to keep you from making the world
 your kingdom of terror again.

 Luckily the mask you are wearing has such a strong smell of blood that
 it attenuates the stench of garlic, allowing you to stay outside the
 cave, near the flowers. However, to continue your escape you must find
 the way to destroy the field which surrounds you.

 The smell of the garlic field is terrible.

>set garlic on fire


 I only understood you as far as wanting to set the garlic field.

>light fire


 You can't see any such thing.

>light garlic


 With your rudimentary torch, you set fire to the garlic field. The
 sight of the flowers burning is wonderful and soon the stink that
 prevented you from leaving the cave fades away, covered by the acrid
 smell of the fire and by the scent of your victory which gets closer.

 Delimited by the scree slope of the mountain, the fire quickly dies
 after destroying the field. The road to the freedom seems to be clear,
 but in such a bad condition you can't go far. You're still too weak to
 turn into a bat and fly away. Moreover, outside your hideout you won't
 have any protection, because you no longer know anyone that could help
 you.

 While you think how to recover your energy, you see a girl arriving
 from the botton of the slope. She has blonde hair, wears a violet
 dress and she seems to come towards you, probably drawn by the smoke
 of the fire. She quickly reaches the charred field, then she notices
 your presence and stops, uncertain.

 [Your score has just gone up by nine points.]

>play violin


 You play a very sweet music that the girl seems to like.

>examine girl


 The girl is rather pretty: she has big blue eyes, long blonde hair and
 a gorgeous little body that inspires a sense of protection... or
 defeat that you are going to satisfy.

 The girl seems to be scared by your horrible appearance.

>bite girl


 The girl is too far for you to bite her before she runs away.

>remove mask



 The girl smiles when you remove the mask and show her your face. Maybe
 she was waiting for that to cross the charred field and reach you near
 the cave entrance. "Sir, it's so strange meeting you here in the dead
 of night" she exclaims, visibly excited. "I'd like to ask you what you
 are doing here, all alone, and if it was you who set the field on
 fire, but maybe first all of all you should tell me your name."

 Do you want to reveal your identity to the girl? (y/n)

>SAVE
>cf5




>y


 You show your medallion to the girl, who opens her eyes wide and
 represses an exclamation of surprise. "You are Martin Voigt" then she
 says, full of thrill. "The ancient lord and master of all these lands
 and the people who live on them. I've heard a lot of times talking
 about you, but I thought you had died many years ago. Instead, you are
 alive. It's a honour for me to make your acquaintance, all my clan has
 always been faithful to you, serving you until your disappearance.
 Surely there will be a big party at the camp, when they know that you
 are back. Meanwhile I'll be at your service to satisfy every your
 need" the girl says, getting closer.

>smell girl


 The smell of burnt emanated from the field is delicious.

>kiss girl


 I'm sure you would like to give another type of kiss.

>bite girl


 The girl is doomed. Maybe, if she had known who you really are, an
 evil vampire who only wants to drink blood and destroy everything, she
 wouldn't have offered you her help with so much generosity. But now
 it's too late to change her mind. The girl is so helpful that she lets
 you hug her without moving. Maybe she thinks that you want to thank
 her. Only when she feels your lips touching her neck, she sees what
 your real intention is. She tries to wiggle out from your hug, but
 your grip is too strong and there's nobody that can hear her screams
 of terror.

 Biting her is a great pleasure. When her blood finally flows down into
 your throat, you feel on top of the world. You drink with savage
 greed. When you stop, the girl is exhausted and collapses on the
 ground. Instead, you've recovered all your energy: after laughing to
 the moon, you finally can turn into a bat and fly towards the
 Yoshiwara Club, where Lilith is waiting for you to bring humankind to
 its apocalypse.

 You'll live many other adventures, Martin Voigt, on this land and on
 others that you'll visit soon. Meanwhile, you have accomplished your
 first mission, leaving your hideout, despite the obstacles set on your
 way, and recovering the energy you need to take your bloody revenge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Snakes room</span>
 Painted on the floor, snakes of every colour and size crawl and coil
 on each other, creating an apparently entangled mess. Some of them
 also climb onto the walls, brushing against the ceiling and making
 seemingly meaningless drawings. To the north there is the passage that
 goes to the bats room, to the south a solid wooden door (without a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cell</span>
 Many of the wretches that wanted to put an end to your atrocities
 spent their last hours of life here, waiting to see what fate they
 would face, after daring to oppose to your wicked supremacy. Caught by
 your minions on the mountain slope, while they tried to achieve their
 silly goals, they had been locked up in this narrow cell and left in
 the deepest darkness for days and nights, without food and water,
 until you felt inspired enough to take care of them. The walls, the
 ceiling, the floor and also the door have been covered with graffiti -
 some of which written in blood - that report curses and prayers of
 every kind, all unheard, seemingly. The exit that leads to the snakes
 room is to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Torture chamber</span>
 Although many years have passed since the last time you used these
 amazing devices of pain and death, the torture chamber still smells of
 the fear and blood of the poor wretches that ended up here. If you
 concentrate, you can hear their screams, which still gives you a fit
 of pleasure.

 A threatening iron maiden is at the centre of the room. Between the
 chains hanging from the ceiling, you see a breaking wheel and a
 pillory. There is also a rusty cage, in which you enjoyed to lock -
 this you remember well - the mates of the people you were torturing.
 So they could see what they would soon endure. To the east you may
 return to the snakes room.

 that surround you make for a rather disquieting company, even for you.
 Although perfectly still and little more than stylised drawings, they
 appear to be extraordinarily alive with shiny yellow eyes and wide

 To the south you may return to the bats room, to the east and to the

 a solid iron door.

>go east


 Praseidimio watches you going to east and says: "I'm sorry, but I'm
 not willing to follow you there. I'll stay here and wait for your
 return."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple</span>
 You are in a small painted black room that appears to be a temple. You
 can see a kneeling stool in front of a large painting with a golden
 frame, hung on the back wall. The subject of the picture is Lilith,
 the gorgeous and cruel vampire who, more than a thousand years ago,
 threw you in this bloody abyss of darkness, letting you drink her
 blood after having pierced your jugular with her long, sharp canines
 so many times.

 Much time has passed since then, but you never forgot the encounter
 that changed your life (and your death) forever. Hence you created
 this place of prayer to keep in contact with her, certain that one day
 Lilith will answer to your invocations and return to you. To the west
 a passage leads to the spiders room.

>kneel


 You kneel on the stool, in front of the painting of Lilith.

>pray


 Kneeling in front of her picture, you pray for the return of Lilith.
 You need her more than ever, at this moment of great difficulty. At
 the beginning you can't find the words, then you remember the
 invocations repeated for centuries, waiting for the return of the only
 woman that is really important for you. Often, many hours would pass
 before you got up, without anything happening.

 Rather unusually, this time, as you've just started to repeat your
 supplications the picture of the vampire comes to life and starts
 speaking, emanating a diabolical halo of red light: "Martin Voigt, how
 much time has passed since the last time we met? Your death grieved me
 and I'm glad to have you in my sight again."

 You smile, but Lilith frowns at you and says: "I know you're happy to
 see me again, but this is no time for love. If you think I'm the one
 who performed the magic that brought you to life, you're right. If you
 think I did it to allow you to accomplish your goal of revenge, you're
 wrong. I've a more ambitious and lethal project for you."

 "Unfortunately you still seem to be very weak" she continues. "I doubt
 you can go further in such a feeble state. Maybe I have to give you
 another bit of help to let you recover your energy and leave your
 hideout. But, first, I have to verify that you still know the basis of
 our history. If you give the correct answer to my question, I shall
 instill in you the power to overcome one of the obstacles set in your
 way... How many rays has the red sun of Valmar that lights up the dark
 nights of us vampires?"

>8


 "You're right, my dear!" says Lilith. "I congratulate you on your
 memory, it seems that your powers haven't weakened that much in these
 years of oblivion. However, to help you overcome the obstacles that
 bar your way to freedom, I'll offer you my curse."

 The charming vampire points her finger at you and instills in you a
 new, wicked energy.

 "Now you may fearlessly face the symbols and the spells that your
 enemies set in your way" she explains. "When you come out, forget your
 foolish plan of revenge and come to me at the Yoshiwara Club. I'm
 gathering the largest army of vampires in history, to prepare for the
 battle that will lead us to subdue humankind. Soon we'll turn the most
 frightening fantasies into reality and take what should have long been
 ours: the world!"

 "Don't worry now about the road to the Yoshiwara Club, at the right
 moment the Love will drive you there" ends Lilith, before vanishing in
 a final blinding flash of red light.

 The impossibility of seeing your image reflected in a mirror is one of
 the things that you hate most about your vampire condition. So the
 gigantic mirror that is in your way towards your freedom, to the east,
 is a horrible view to you. Your persecutors thought of everything to
 keep you imprisoned in your own hideout. The mirror is too large to be
 covered, bypassed or climbed upon, so you have to find a way to
 destroy it, if you want to leave the hideout.

>go east


 The mirror blocks your way.

 Do you want to ask Praseidimio to help you to break the mirror? (y/n)

>y


 Praseidimio stares at the mirror uncertain. Being near him you see
 that his image too isn't reflected but he doesn't seem to care about
 it. Probably a small gesture would be enough for him to break the
 mirror, as it was for you when you were at the top of your strength.

 At last, acknowledging that it's a problem too difficult to solve for
 a vampire in such a bad condition, the demon agrees to grant your
 wish. He points one of his shapeless excrescences to the mirror and
 breaks it, scattering its small fragments on the floor.

 "You've been satisfied" says Praseidimio, before disappearing in a
 cloud of red smoke. "Now go on with your revenge. And may the red sun
 of Valmar shine on your dark nights of vampire!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave</span>
 Through a twisty maze of tunnels, you've reached the cave that leads
 out of mountain bowels, to the east. Just another effort and you'll be
 free to go to Lilith at the Yoshiwara Club and accomplish your
 revenge. However, to the west you can return to the dark gallery that
 takes to your hideout.

 A big black wolf stands between you and the exit.

 The wolf howls and looks at you with hateful eyes.

>talk to wolf


 someone about something.

>ask wolf about wolf


 Who do you think you are, Saint Francis of Assisi?

>play violin


 You play some very sweet music that calms the wolf and makes it fall
 asleep.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mountain slope</span>
 Outside the cave, every sense of yours is assaulted by the garlic
 flowers planted all around the entrance. A new attempt to block your
 escape from the mountain bowels, to keep you from making the world
 your kingdom of terror again.

 Luckily the mask you are wearing has such a strong smell of blood that
 it attenuates the stench of garlic, allowing you to stay outside the
 cave, near the flowers. However, to continue your escape you must find
 the way to destroy the field which surrounds you.

 The smell of the garlic field is terrible.

>burn garlic


 With your rudimentary torch, you set fire to the garlic field. The
 sight of the flowers burning is wonderful and soon the stink that
 prevented you from leaving the cave fades away, covered by the acrid
 smell of the fire and by the scent of your victory which gets closer.

 Delimited by the scree slope of the mountain, the fire quickly dies
 after destroying the field. The road to the freedom seems to be clear,
 but in such a bad condition you can't go far. You're still too weak to
 turn into a bat and fly away. Moreover, outside your hideout you won't
 have any protection, because you no longer know anyone that could help
 you.

 While you think how to recover your energy, you see a girl arriving
 from the botton of the slope. She has blonde hair, wears a violet
 dress and she seems to come towards you, probably drawn by the smoke
 of the fire. She quickly reaches the charred field, then she notices
 your presence and stops, uncertain.

 [Your score has just gone up by nine points.]

>remove mask



 The girl smiles when you remove the mask and show her your face. Maybe
 she was waiting for that to cross the charred field and reach you near
 the cave entrance. "Sir, it's so strange meeting you here in the dead
 of night" she exclaims, visibly excited. "I'd like to ask you what you
 are doing here, all alone, and if it was you who set the field on
 fire, but maybe first all of all you should tell me your name."

 Do you want to reveal your identity to the girl? (y/n)

>go north


 The girl looks away, embarrassed, and says: "I'm sorry, sir. I didn't
 want to be indiscreet. I've heard that one time here there was the
 hideout of Martin Voigt, the legendary lord and master of all these
 lands and the people who live on them. For a moment, I thought it
 might be you. Before returning to my camp, I'll still stay here a
 while: I'd be glad if you changed your mind and showed me a proof of
 your identity.
