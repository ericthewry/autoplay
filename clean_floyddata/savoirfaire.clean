 The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
 overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
 carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
 manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
 you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
 scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
 you against their type.

 You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
 him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
 month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
 been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
 has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
 the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."

 But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
 your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
 fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
 You will just have to find what you can.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">About This Game:</span>

 This is version 7 of Savoir-Faire, which was first released in April
 of 2002. It received four XYZZY Awards (Best Player Character, Best
 Story, Best Puzzles, and Best Game) for that year.

 The game was designed to be an old-fashioned puzzle game -- that is to
 say, lots of emphasis on difficult problems, light on story-line and
 character interaction. Some of the puzzles are fairly challenging, and
 it is possible to get the game into a state from which it cannot be
 won. Save often.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Historicity:</span>

 Savoir-Faire is set in an alternate, somewhat mangled version of the
 early 1780s. Vagueness about setting, and a tendency towards
 anachronism, were traits I associate with old-style games, and they
 are present to some degree here. All the same, I've received the
 occasional complaint about historical inaccuracy, to which I can only
 reply that SF was never intended to be terribly accurate, and if
 you're reading it that way, you're missing the point (and would be
 better off playing Peter Nepstad's meticulously researched "1893").

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Background Materials:</span>

 As of the release of this version, it is still possible to get copies
 of the "feelies" I created to go with it. These include a booklet of
 background material about the alternate history of this world, and
 some more information about the fate of the characters in it. If
 interested, you may check out [<a href="http://www.feelies.org/">LINK</A>] to determine
 whether they are still available.

 These general instructions are adapted from: "A Beginner's Guide to
 Playing Interactive Fiction". The full text can be found at
 [<a href="http://IFGuide.ramsberg.net">LINK</A>]

 <span class="floydstyle i">The game starts</span>
 When you start a game, you will first see an introduction, usually
 consisting of one or a few screenfuls of text, giving you some
 background on who you are, where you are, and perhaps even what your
 objectives in the game are. Whenever the game has printed a screenful
 of text, it will wait until you press ENTER or some other key, so that
 you get a chance to read everything before it scrolls off the top of
 the screen.

 <span class="floydstyle i">How to interact</span>
 it may be a little different from game to game. The prompt means that
 the game is now waiting for you to tell it what you want to do. You do
 this by typing in imperative commands, as if you were commanding
 someone. Let's say the introduction told you that you are in a
 kitchen, and that you can see a closed glass jar standing on the
 kitchen counter. Commands you could try at this point include TAKE THE
 JAR, or OPEN THE JAR, or perhaps EXAMINE THE JAR (Throughout this
 document, things that are written in capital letters are complete
 commands that can be typed into an IF game. They don't have to be
 typed in capital letters when entered into a game). If you want to,
 you can skip the articles: TAKE JAR will work just at well as TAKE THE
 JAR. If there are several different jars you could mean, the game may
 ask you which one you mean. Just type one or more words that uniquely
 identifies one of the items. For instance, if the game says "Which jar
 do you mean, the blue glass jar or the green glass jar?", you might
 reply BLUE to take the blue one. You can also choose to ignore the
 question altogether, just typing a new command.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Two special commands:</span>

 There are two verbs you should be aware of in addition to the usual
 ones: REMEMBER and LINK. REMEMBER gives you access to memories about
 objects, when you are prompted that such memories exist.

 In addition, your character can LINK objects of similar properties.
 (e.g.: LINK SNUFFBOX TO SMALL YELLOW BOX.)  Once this link has been
 created, things done to one object will automatically affect the other
 as well... subject to certain rules.

 Otherwise, this game is fairly cruel -- it is possible to render the
 game unwinnable, and you should save often, especially when you
 realize that you are about to destroy an object you may not be able to
 get back. We make no apologies for this, since it is part of the
 Old-School charm. Or, er, so we are told.

 Almost every large IF project is the product of many people besides
 the author. This one benefited particularly from a very hard-working
 set of beta-testers, and, once it was released the first time, from
 bug reports, comments on the puzzles from rec.games.int-fiction, and
 reviews in SPAG, the IF Ratings site ([<a href="http://www.ifratings.com/">LINK</A>]), and
 IF Review. On those grounds I was persuaded not only to fix numerous
 horrible bugs but also to change the phrasing of some descriptions,
 file away a few of the game's most extreme anachronisms, and introduce
 a few alternate puzzle solutions. The ending, the subject of some
 debate, remains as it was in the original.

 Any errors that remain are of course my own fault.

 A tangle of climbing roses covers almost completely the wall and door
 of a shed to the southeast.

>examine pipe


 The pipe leads through the wall into the house.

>examine well


 A dark circle of stone, the depths of which you cannot see. The water
 comes up within reach.

 A bar of iron crosses the well, to support a bucket on a rope (which,
 however, is itself lacking).

 In the well is a body of water.

>examine sundial


 A sturdy old sundial, its bronze weathered green. Unlike various
 tawdry sundials you have encountered in your life, it has a
 firmly-attached gnomon that is unlikely to come off in times of
 trouble.

>pick a rose


 The roses are equipped with really ferocious thorns.

>examine me


 Tall, thin, and fashionably dressed; greying prematurely at the
 temples, but not-- (the ladies all insist)-- not old; perhaps a little
 tired around the eyes, and a little jaded. Very little of your peasant
 heritage reveals itself in you.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   three food items:
     a sprig of mint
     a sprig of parsley
     a bay leaf
   a dashing hat (being worn)
   a swordstick
     a sword
   a snuffbox (which is closed)

>examine hat


 Made of black felt, and quite ordinary, except for the breadth and
 sweep of the brim, and the majesty of the pure white feather.

>examine sword


 A slender and flexible blade, and more decorative than useful, though
 there have been a few occasions when it became helpful against
 brigands in the street. The design at the hilt is a bit ornate, but
 not unpleasantly so.

>take sword


 You draw the sword from its sheath.

>cut rose with sword


 The sword is not sharp enough to slash effectively through the roses.

>examine snuffbox


 A little pastel-colored metal box in which you keep your supply of
 snuff.

 Something about the snuffbox tickles your recollection.

>remember snuffbox



 ...

 "<span class="floydstyle em">Don't</span> play magic pranks on the guests," said the Count,
 confiscating the little box you had been using to control the Marquis'
 snuffbox (so it would refuse to open when he tried the little
 one-handed flick he was so fond of, and then pop open of its own when
 he set it down...).

 "Why NOT?" you demanded, twisting under the painful grip he had on
 your shoulder. "You don't mind if I play with the servants."

 "First," said the Count, clearing the links from the box with a brush
 of his fingers, "I hope you do not play anything malicious on the
 servants; it is only all right as long as it is games and they do not
 mind."  He set the box down. "And second, the Marquis is nobility."

 "I do not understand."

 The Count sighed. "I thought you might not. Pierre, you are an--
 unusual case, being exempt from this rule, but you know that for the
 most part, only the nobility are able to perform the lavori d'Aracne;
 and of them, only the most noble families, who have access to the
 Honors of the Court. To play magic tricks on the Marquis, therefore,
 is to remind him that his lineage is not as good as ours. He will be
 insulted and grow angry, and I cannot afford to allow that to happen."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables are a loaf of stale bread and a delicate
 contraption (which is closed).

 A string of andouillettes hangs from a beam of the ceiling.

>examine beam


 The heavy beams (five in all) were each cut a very long time ago from
 a very large tree.

>examine tables


 Higher than a table you might eat at, and designed for people to use
 when standing up.

>examine andouillettes


 Veal cased in tripe. Tasty food.  The servants used to eat them with
 fried onions -- a good, hearty smell that leaked out of the kitchen
 while you played outside, until you went inside, and sometimes they
 would let you eat at the kitchen table rather than with the Family.

>take tripe


 You can't reach the andouillettes from here.

>examine bread


 A roughly rectangular loaf of bread, reddish brown, and shriveled to
 rock-like hardness by being left to sit around for so long. The fact
 that it went uneaten is explained by the fact that one face is burnt
 black -- someone left it in the oven too long, evidently.

>take bread


 Taken.

 On the kitchen tables is a delicate contraption (which is closed).

 A string of andouillettes hangs from a beam of the ceiling.

>examine contraption


 The body of the contraption is mostly just a large box, into which
 things can be put, and an assembly of clockwork parts in a separate
 case, not to be interfered with. There is also a dial which may be set
 to various positions, and a spindle, on which is a cylinder with a
 pattern of strange bumps on it, labeled "Andouillettes Recipe".

 The delicate contraption is currently switched off.

 pattern of strange bumps on it, labeled "Andouillettes Recipe".

 The delicate contraption is currently switched off.

>turn on contraption


 The machine's gears spin into action; a series of fine flanges, like
 the keys of a music box, move into position against the surface of the
 cylinder, which rotates steadily. From inside the box comes a
 plaintive mechanical voice which declares, "Monsieur le Chef!! You
 need more! andouillettes!!!"

 The mechanism whirrs a moment longer before its functioning gives out.

>examine dial


 A dial which can be rotated to show one word at a time, labeled
 'SHAPE'. Currently the word showing is NONE.

>turn dial


 You turn the dial gently with one finger, and it clicks around to
 display the setting LEAF.

>drop bread


 Dropped.

>take garlic


 Taken.

>turn on contraption


 There is a regretful clicking noise from the vicinity of the
 lid-catch. Just as you think you are going to have to close it
 yourself, a gloved mechanical hand reaches up and slams the
 contraption shut from the inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables are a loaf of stale bread and a delicate

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen Garden</span>
 West is the wall of the kitchen. Most of the space along the wall is
 planted with herbs -- bay, parsley, stalks of mint -- left of the open
 doorway. To its right is only a drainage ditch, catching the outflow
 of a pipe that comes through the wall.

 In one corner of the plot is the well, drilled many deep feet; in
 another is the antique sundial.

 A tangle of climbing roses covers almost completely the wall and door
 of a shed to the southeast.

 Anton's wife Leonie stood by the fireplace. "The new maid -- I think
 she is a snoop."

 Anton shrugged his broad shoulders. "She chops potatoes," he said.

 "Nonetheless I don't trust her. Give me the money."  And she took the

 concealed them behind a brick in the fireplace.

>examine plate


 One of a set of special dishes that the Count made. The idea was that
 all of the china plates in the house were linked to this one plate,
 which could then be washed and dried, minimizing the expenditure of
 time and water. Similar arrangements were made for other parts of the
 standard place setting; the Count spent innumerable hours refining the
 links.

 The reason that the plate is metal rather than china is that, when the
 link-system was first instituted, a clumsy maid ravaged the Countess'
 entire crystal collection by accidentally chipping a glass.

 In order to make the linkages possible, however, it has been painted a
 glossy white, and the crest of the family executed on one side in
 intricate detail.

 "So the man linked himself to a suit of armor. And then he left the
 suit of armor at home, and went off to war to fight in his bare skin,
 thinking that whatever happened to him, the links would protect him.
 But at home his wife was horrified to see the armor slashed in pieces
 before her eyes..."

 "Anabelle," interrupted the Count, standing at the doorway with a hand
 on his vest. "Do you really think this story is appropriate for the
 children?"

 The Countess shrugged, half-smiling as she always had when the Count
 overrode her authority. "I hardly think it is any more disturbing than
 the other things Marie reads," she said lightly. "The dining room is
 more frightening than this story."

 "I don't mean that, of course." The Count smiled over you and Marie --
 you on the floor, Marie with her skirts spread around her on the
 chaise. "But <span class="floydstyle em">our</span> children should not be told silly
 superstitions about linking."  He came into the room then, touching
 the Countess' shoulder with an affectionate gesture. "Marie," he said,
 "What is wrong with your mother's story?"

 "The man has confused reverse-links and ordinary ones," Marie replied.
 "And he would have to be very stupid to do that, because reverse-links
 are harder to make and you can always tell when you have done it."

 The Count nodded at her. "Very good."  He kissed the Countess and went
 out again...

 Hmm. Something to eat would be good.

>examine clock


 Hand-carved by a German carver from dark wood; it was a present to the
 Count by a political ally. The Countess considered the clock a bit
 gauche, but was persuaded that it would be impolite not to display it.

 It consists of the face, a pendulum and pair of weights, and a little
 door above the face that opens when the hour is struck. It is not
 ticking at the moment.  The clock shows the time to be 10:13.

 Metal, and shaped like a disc at the end of a rod. As so often.

 You give the pendulum an encouraging shove, but the friction of the
 system seems to be against it, and it soon falls still again, the main

 It was a long journey down here, and you're wishing you had had

 mechanical bird flies forward. It sings a brief warbling tune, then
 withdraws into its little door.

>examine handkerchief


 A square of good linen; rather nice, really. It is currently colored
 white.

 The surface of the model Saturn catches the sunlight.

>read clock


 A detailed discourse on how to take care of and repair an assortment
 of common and mechanical clocks. It begins with comprehensible
 matters, such as pulling up the weights to begin the operation of the
 pendulum when the clock has stopped, and other bits of routine
 maintenance; it finishes with diagrams of a clock's inner workings
 that are almost embarrassingly intimate and far too complex for you to
 follow.

 The model universe clicks.

>examine model


 Fitted out with tiny planets on arms, and the major moons of the
 planets, revolving around a center. There is no sun, however; there is
 only a sort of holder designed to contain something spherical.

 Most of the planets are ordinary balls of solid metal, except for
 Jupiter.  They are in motion.

 Oddly, the contraption also seems to be linked, and quite unsubtly, to
 something in the foyer, to the south. You can feel the pull of it.

 The planets turn slowly around the empty sun-holder.

 Something about the model universe tickles your recollection.

 ...

 The Count was standing in the library, tinkering with the model; Marie
 was bent over it as well, instructing him about what to connect where.

 "I will never understand," he remarked to you, "how it is that she has
 such a mechanical mind. Not the least interest in diplomacy..."

 "It is my cold heart, Papa," she replied, tossing aside her
 clockmaking tools.

 "It is done?" he asked her.

 "Put the light in," she said, "and then make it go."

 You turned away. "Stay and see how it works!" Marie called after you.

 "Sorry, infant, the road to Paris is long..."

 ...

 The model universe clicks.

>examine jupiter


 Jupiter is a large sphere of copperish metal, though it is pierced
 through and has a sort of lens inserted in the center.

 The little pearl moon revolves around its earth.

 The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
 overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
 carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
 manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
 you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
 scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
 you against their type.

 You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
 him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
 month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
 been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
 has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
 the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."

 But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
 your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
 fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
 You will just have to find what you can.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen Garden</span>
 West is the wall of the kitchen. Most of the space along the wall is
 planted with herbs -- bay, parsley, stalks of mint -- left of the open
 doorway. To its right is only a drainage ditch, catching the outflow
 of a pipe that comes through the wall.

 In one corner of the plot is the well, drilled many deep feet; in
 another is the antique sundial.

 A tangle of climbing roses covers almost completely the wall and door
 of a shed to the southeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Staircase, First Floor</span>

 rooms. (You and Marie used to sit up here when the Count had guests,
 watching them arrive downstairs in their magnificent clothing, until
 you got old enough to be introduced yourselves.)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long Salon</span>
 In days gone by you ran up and down these halls with Marie, and were
 barely able to stop at the end, skidding in your stockings the last
 few feet before the stairs began. She's gone now, both the little girl
 with dusk-blonde curls and the somewhat older one with dangerous
 slanting eyes and cleverly backwards magics; the dust falls long and
 slowly, the walls echo with absence.

 West is the top of the staircase, and rooms open to the north and
 east.

 The door east is closed.

 A small portrait hangs on the wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countess' Sitting Room</span>
 This was the countess' favorite room, and it is more richly decorated
 than any other in the house, betraying her taste for the
 brightly-colored and the jewel-like. The count brought her some things
 from his travels, and made others for her. Most of the contents seem
 to be gone -- the chairs and sofas, and the wall hangings -- but some
 bits remain.

 A thick-pile Persian rug lies on the floor, patterned in lapis and
 emerald.

 Against one wall is a glass case full of rare and valuable clockwork
 figures.

>examine case


 The case is specially made of glass and wood. Inscribed into the
 surface of the glass with a fine cutting tool are the words: "CAREFUL!
 DO NOT BREAK!"

 Inside are mechanical dancers and a clockwork bee.

 Something about the glass case tickles your recollection.

>remember case



 ...

 Many years ago, the Countess stood at this case, looking at the
 contents. "Sometimes I feel like one of these," she said, softly.
 "Trapped..."

 She met your eye. "You don't understand what I am saying, do you?"

 You shook your head.

 "They are made of gears and magic links," she said. "They have no
 choices."

 ...

>examine bee


 A life-sized golden bee, its wings made of planed gems. It is,
 unfortunately, equipped with an ingenious equivalent of a sting -- a
 tail endowed with blades that will cut into any sensitive thing it
 settles on. And these have been tipped with a vicious poison.

>examine dancers


 The dancers are antique, and peculiar. Their costume replicates an
 English mode of the sixteenth century: the lady wears a skirt of
 beaten copper, pierced in designs, and around the gentleman's neck is
 a ruff of folded silver, though with long neglect it has begun to
 darken. As for their skin, it is all carved ivory.

 They both of them stand on a floor made up of cogs, to permit them to
 spin and dance around.

>take dancers


 The glass case isn't open.

 It comes into your mind, yet again, that you'd hoped to find some
 sustenance here.

>open case


 That's not something you can open.

>examine rug


 So thick and luxurious that it seemed the strangest possession in a
 house of wonders, when you first came here. Marie used to lie on it,
 eschewing chairs and sofas, and read in a triangle of sunlight, the
 halo of her hair and the bleeding color of the carpet so bright it
 burned to look at. And then she'd fall asleep--

 It's a deep, thick carpet, so comfortable that your mother would have
 been happy to have it for a bed. The pattern is intricate and
 peculiar.

 A chilly northern exposure, perhaps, but really quite lovely. This
 room used to be where Marie would practice her music, and the Countess
 play her compositions; Marie's own room lies to the west.

 On the high shelf is a celestial bauble.

 The pianoforte stands in the center of the room.

>examine bauble


 A delicate ornament made of glass, containing inside it a little sun
 and star that whirl infinitely in the hollow space. It was a plaything
 of Marie's, which (due to careful reverse linking to a perfectly round
 rock) she could hurl at walls and never break, drop down staircases
 and find intact at the bottom. But it is very doubtful that the link
 has lasted out the years.

>get bauble


 It is too high for you to reach.

>examine pianoforte


 Legs and case are fashioned out of a dark, heavy wood, with the keys
 of the usual colors. The music stand is empty, which is an odd sight.
 The Countess used to bring composers to the house, to talk to and
 sometimes to sponsor in small ways; her own compositions she was too
 reserved to share with the musical groups, but she would labor over
 them in the afternoons, filling the upstairs with the sounds of trills
 and runs, always soaring and bird-like.

 A deep, satin-lustrous cherry, with gilt-metal decorations. The years
 have not been kind, and it has cracked and split in several places;
 the finish is damaged, and where there is inlaid mother of pearl, it
 is beginning to come up from its bed. But it is still a sound piece,

 in the kitchen downstairs: Marie's project, apparently. There are
 lists of foods, and sketches, which you cannot entirely follow, of

 Taken.

>examine portrait


 Oil on wood, of a small, pinch-faced girl; the writing on the back
 says it is the Baroness D'Envers at a young age, which would make her
 some distant cousin of the Count, several generations back, and also
 related to the man currently holding all your notes.

 It is not especially well-executed, and probably worth fairly little
 on the market.

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long Salon</span>
 A long empty room with shined wooden floors, perfect for sliding in
 stocking-feet. West is the top of the staircase, and rooms open to the
 north and east.

 The door east is closed.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countess' Sitting Room</span>
 This was the countess' favorite room, and it is more richly decorated
 than any other in the house, betraying her taste for the
 brightly-colored and the jewel-like. The count brought her some things
 from his travels, and made others for her. Most of the contents seem
 to be gone -- the chairs and sofas, and the wall hangings -- but some
 bits remain.

 A thick-pile Persian rug lies on the floor, patterned in lapis and
 emerald.

 Against one wall is a glass case full of rare and valuable clockwork
 figures.

 It's a deep, thick carpet, so comfortable that your mother would have
 been happy to have it for a bed. The pattern is intricate and
 peculiar.

 With your bare hands? That could be uncomfortable.

>throw stone at glass


 (first taking the stone block)
 (putting <span class="floydstyle em">The Lavori d'Aracne</span> into the sack to make room)
 The stone block races through the air before striking the glass case.
 The glass case breaks.  It leaves behind the clockwork bee and the
 mechanical human dancers and the stone block comes to rest on the
 ground.

 The clockwork bee buzzes faintly, spreading its jeweled wings.

>smash glass with stone


 (first taking the stone block)
 The stone block strikes the glass shards, which smash dramatically.

 The clockwork bee, detecting your presence, stirs angrily to life. You
 make a few noble efforts to bat it away, but all to no avail. With
 deadly accuracy it finds your skin; there is a sharp sting, then a
 gradual dulling...

 The main staircase ascends to the corridor on the second floor, and a
 smaller version leads down into the dim basement. Doors also open
 north and northeast.

 On the wall is one of those mechanical clocks that pop open on the

 The cuckoo clock ticks sullenly.

 A grand room, for dining in style. The plastered ceiling is several

 Woodworked columns frame the exits west and southwest.

 Heavy double doors open east to the kitchen.

 "So the man linked himself to a suit of armor. And then he left the
 suit of armor at home, and went off to war to fight in his bare skin,
 thinking that whatever happened to him, the links would protect him.
 But at home his wife was horrified to see the armor slashed in pieces
 before her eyes..."

 "Anabelle," interrupted the Count, standing at the doorway with a hand
 on his vest. "Do you really think this story is appropriate for the
 children?"

 The Countess shrugged, half-smiling as she always had when the Count
 overrode her authority. "I hardly think it is any more disturbing than
 the other things Marie reads," she said lightly. "The dining room is
 more frightening than this story."

 "I don't mean that, of course." The Count smiled over you and Marie --
 you on the floor, Marie with her skirts spread around her on the
 chaise. "But <span class="floydstyle em">our</span> children should not be told silly
 superstitions about linking."  He came into the room then, touching
 the Countess' shoulder with an affectionate gesture. "Marie," he said,
 "What is wrong with your mother's story?"

 "The man has confused reverse-links and ordinary ones," Marie replied.
 "And he would have to be very stupid to do that, because reverse-links
 are harder to make and you can always tell when you have done it."

 The Count nodded at her. "Very good."  He kissed the Countess and went
 out again...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen Corridor</span>

 In one corner of the plot is the well, drilled many deep feet; in

 The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
 overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
 carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
 manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
 you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
 scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
 you against their type.

 You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
 him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
 month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
 been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
 has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
 the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."

 But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
 your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
 fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
 You will just have to find what you can.

 grooves, seeming carefully wrought and utterly intentional. The core
 of the cylinder is hollow, but over one end is a piece of paper which
 bears a label, in careful lettering, which reads, "Tea Recipe."

>open tea


 That would be impossible even if the Tea Recipe weren't
 reverse-linked.

 In your hunger, you hallucinate curls of toasted bread.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scullery</span>
 A small, workmanlike room with a floor of white stones. The principal
 features of the room are a counter, with a large inset washbasin also
 made of stone, and a tall wooden cupboard.

 You can see a puddle of mead and some glass shards here.

>go south


 (treading gingerly around the glass bits)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables are a loaf of stale bread and a delicate
 contraption (in which are some andouillettes).

>take recipe from contraption


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine contraption


 The body of the contraption is mostly just a large box, into which
 things can be put, and an assembly of clockwork parts in a separate
 case, not to be interfered with. There is also a dial which may be set
 to various positions, and a spindle, on which is a cylinder with a
 pattern of strange bumps on it, labeled "Andouillettes Recipe".

 The delicate contraption is currently switched off.

 In the delicate contraption are some andouillettes.

>take andouillettes recipe


 (putting the jeweled pin into the sack to make room)
 It takes a bit of wiggling to get the cylinder to come free, but you
 extricate it without too much difficulty.

>put tea recipe on spindle


 The cylinder slips into place with a satisfying click, as though some
 mechanism has engaged.

>turn on contraption


 There is a regretful clicking noise from the vicinity of the
 lid-catch. Just as you think you are going to have to close it
 yourself, a gloved mechanical hand reaches up and slams the
 contraption shut from the inside.

 The machine's gears spin into action; a series of fine flanges, like
 the keys of a music box, move into position against the surface of the
 cylinder, which rotates steadily. An irritable mechanical voice shouts
 from within, "I shall be requiring the cup in which to put this item!"

>take tripe


 You already have that.

 The mechanism whirrs a moment longer before its functioning gives out.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 Originally a salon for the receiving of guests; but in recent years
 the Count has become increasingly interested in his own projects, and
 has taken over the entire room for the storage of books. Bookshelves
 line the walls, reaching above your head, leaving exits only east and
 south.

 The clockwork model universe has stopped; a beam of light from the
 "sun" at the center, focused through Jupiter, shines in the direction
 of the shelves, highlighting a spot where <span class="floydstyle em">The World Is Hollow</span>
 used to be.

 On one wall is an enormous portrait of the Count's father, from the
 hand of Hyacinthe Rigaud.

>examine portrait


 (the framed portrait)
 The old man appears to stand in a vague, ruddy landscape; all the
 artist's attention was spared for his clothing, which is rendered in
 shimmering detail, lustrous silks and fur, and for the giant
 bi-partite mound of wig on his head, whose curls fall over each
 shoulder.

 Something about the framed portrait tickles your recollection.

 "He can <span class="floydstyle em">make links</span>," the Countess hissed. Neither of them saw

 "Anabelle--"

 "And don't tell me that your father strayed into some peasant's bed in
 his dotage, because I have seen Pierre's mother and she is
 <span class="floydstyle em">not</span> old enough to--"

 "Anabelle, calm yourself."  He put a hand on her shoulder, spoke in
 his voice of diplomacy.

 "Now you will tell me that he is some by-blow of someone passing
 through the village, I suppose? Some guest of ours, perhaps?" she
 asked bitterly. "I wondered why you were so ready to accept him--"

 "I swear to you, Pierre is no son of mine. Nor, I think, is he any
 relative of ours for many generations. It is possible that these
 things appear sportively even among the lesser classes, you know..."

 She shrugged his hand away. "There's something you aren't telling me,"
 she said. "I always know it, you say so yourself."

 He sighed. "I will tell you, Ana, but it is not what you think..."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables are a loaf of stale bread and a delicate

 West is the wall of the kitchen. Most of the space along the wall is

 In one corner of the plot is the well, drilled many deep feet; in
 another is the antique sundial.

 A tangle of climbing roses covers almost completely the wall and door
 of a shed to the southeast.

>link chocolate to roses

 You valiantly try to link the two objects, but they are just a little
 too different. Maybe if they looked more alike.

>put snuff on roses


 (the roses)
 (first taking the snuff)
 You put a pinch -- really just the tiniest bit -- on the back of one
 hand and lift it to your nose. Refreshing, invigorating, and
 mercifully not spoilt with an excess of perfume such as everyone seems
 to prefer these days.

>touch snuff

 This area is devoted to wines for second-class guests, which the Count
 reserved for the servants, visits from the curate, or hinting away a
 houseguest who had overstayed his welcome. "It seems that we are down
 to the Sangue de Toro," he would say, smoothing his vest with one
 delicate hand and looking regretful as he decanted a ruddy stream into
 the goblet of some unfortunate.

 On particularly bad occasions he would order the steward to shake the
 bottle in advance.

 The ransackers of the cellar seem not to have reached this room,
 however: many of the bottles sit intact on their shelves (if anyone
 cared to sample them).

 A closed white door leads south; it looks oddly streaked.

 An open russet door leads west.

>examine barrel


 A large barrel rolled into the corner.

>examine it


 A sort of bundle or package of cloth wrapped around something.

>open south


 (the white door leading south)
 You open the white door leading south. It swings more lightly than
 most of the doors hereabouts.

>open bundle


 You open up the cloth bundle, which turns out in fact to be a fine
 cloak, wrapped tightly around some documents. (A shame to risk such a
 good cloak, you reflect; the barrel is probably proof against damp,
 but there's always the chance of something getting inside. But perhaps
 whoever wrapped it up expected to be back soon.)

 In your hunger, you hallucinate little grey-pink mushrooms.

>examine documents


 A sheaf of documents, written over in the Count's handwriting, and
 bound together with a wrapping of thick oilskin.

>read them


 The documents appear to be records of some of the Count's work:
 letters from highly-ranked members of the king's council; charts of
 family lines, with the relationships of blood marked in black and the
 human links marked in red, indicating members of rival families and
 dynasties held hostage to each other by magic.

 Several names leap out of the charts at you. D'Envers, the Count's
 several-times-distant cousin (and the source of your current
 distress). D'Envers' mother, recently deceased, formerly
 hostage-linked to the Countess... several other hostages, recently
 dead (but, you thought, for natural causes).

 But you know too little of the Count's business to guess what this
 would mean, except perhaps that the careful arrangements have begun to
 come unstuck lately. Even a local outbreak of plague could do that, if
 it killed too many of the wrong people at the same time.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

 (first unlinking the sword)
 You succeed in unlinking the sword from the butcher knife.
 Bending your will, you form the link between the sword and the bottle

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wine Cellar Antechamber</span>
 The air is cool here, protected by deep walls of stone. Heavy beams
 overhead support the weight of the upper floors. A thick dust overlays
 everything.

 The vault door stands invitingly open.

 The wine-cellar door -- sturdy wood in yellowish brass panels --
 stands open to the west.

 A closed russet door leads northeast.

 An open red door leads east.

 An open grey-blue door leads south.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bottom of Servants' Staircase</span>
 An awkward wedge of space between the foundations of the main house
 and the walls of the new-built wine cellar, east. The staircase does
 not leave much room to stand in; it is straight and carefully planed
 lest anyone trip with a priceless bottle of wine.

 The wine-cellar door -- sturdy wood in yellowish brass panels --
 stands open to the east.

 An ordinary wooden door opens west into the root cellar.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen Corridor</span>
 A narrow corridor between the kitchen and the main house, which has a
 thick separate wall. The two buildings are only barely attached, to
 discourage fires. A small staircase leads down.

 Double doors give west onto the main house.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables are a loaf of stale bread and a delicate
 contraption (which is empty).

>open contraption


 That's already open.

>put tripe in contraption


 (first taking the andouillettes)
 Taken.

 You put the andouillettes into the delicate contraption.

>examine onion


 The pale yellow skin is still tight and glossy.

>take skin


 Taken.

>put onion in contraption


 You frown dubiously at the onion with its skin still on. It might not
 be good to put it in unpeeled.

>peel onion


 You peel the onion of its skin.

>eat onion


 Oh, no, no. You don't just cram yourself with whatever pathetic
 foodstuff lies at hand -- no one with any self-respect lives that way.
 What you want is a meal, prepared with some sensitivity and
 forethought.

>put onion in contraption


 You put the peeled onion into the delicate contraption.

>put salt in contraption


 You put some sea-salt in the delicate contraption, exhausting the
 supply in the red glass jar.  There is still some room remaining in
 the delicate contraption.

>open green


 Opening a container of olive oil while it is in the sack seems like an
 invitation to disaster.

>take green

 Taken.

>open green


 You open the green glass jar.

>open it


 That's already open.

>put oil in contraption


 You put some olive oil in the delicate contraption, exhausting the
 supply in the green glass jar.  There is still some room remaining in
 the delicate contraption.  The olive oil mixes with what was already
 there.

>examine recipe


 Which do you mean, the Chocolate Recipe or the Andouillettes Recipe?

>take recipe from spindle


 (putting the silver-plated corkscrew into the sack to make room)
 It takes a bit of wiggling to get the cylinder to come free, but you
 extricate it without too much difficulty.

 In your hunger, you hallucinate onion soup, with its crust of baked
 cheese. Or perhaps purple-black Hellene olives.

>link blanc to sword


 Bending your will, you form the link between the bottle of Sauvignon
 Blanc and the sword.

>pull sword


 (putting the fork into the sack to make room)
 You draw the sword from its sheath.

>put andouillettes recipe on spindle
 The bottle of Sauvignon Blanc gives up its cork at this point.



 (first taking the Andouillettes Recipe)
 (putting the spoon into the sack to make room)
 Taken.

 The cylinder slips into place with a satisfying click, as though some
 mechanism has engaged.

>put sword in swordstick


 You put the sword into the swordstick.

>draw sword


 You draw the sword from its sheath.

>put blanc in contraption


 (first taking the delicate contraption)
 It is both too large and too delicate to remove.

 (taking the bottle of Sauvignon Blanc)
 (putting the table knife into the sack to make room)
 Taken.

 You put some Sauvignon Blanc in the delicate contraption, exhausting
 the supply in the blue bottle.  There is still some room remaining in
 the delicate contraption.  The Sauvignon Blanc mixes with what was
 already there.

>close contraptio


 You close the delicate contraption.

>turn it on


 The machine's gears spin into action; a series of fine flanges, like
 the keys of a music box, move into position against the surface of the
 cylinder, which rotates steadily. An irritable mechanical voice shouts
 from within, "I shall be requiring the plate on which to put this
 item!"

>open contraption


 You open the contraption, revealing a mixture of Sauvignon Blanc,
 olive oil, and sea-salt and two food items (a peeled onion and some
 andouillettes).

>put plate in contraption


 (first taking the plate)
 (putting the onion skin into the sack to make room)
 Taken.

 You put the plate into the delicate contraption.

>close contraption


 You close the delicate contraption.

>turn it on


 The machine's gears spin into action; a series of fine flanges, like
 the keys of a music box, move into position against the surface of the
 cylinder, which rotates steadily. From inside the contraption comes a
 sound of chopping, and then a hot sizzle. The unmistakeable smell of
 frying onions rises to greet you from inside the contraption's box.

 A moment later, there is some additional sloshing, and slowly the
 smell becomes more complex, redolent of wine and meat. There is a puff
 of steam around the edges of the lid, and then the mechanism's parts
 come discreetly to rest.

>open contraption


 You open the contraption, revealing a plate, on top of which are two
 food items (some cooked andouillettes and a chocolate leaf).

>examine andouillettes


 Which do you mean, the cooked andouillettes or the Andouillettes
 Recipe?

>cooked


 Marvellous: the sausage is sliced and cooked perfectly in wine and
 olive oil, seasoned with salt, and accompanied by savory fried onions.
 The pieces of sausage are arranged loosely into a leaf shape, which is
 perhaps as much as one should expect.

>eat them


 (first taking the cooked andouillettes)
 You really ought to eat these in the appropriate surroundings.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scullery</span>
 A small, workmanlike room with a floor of white stones. The principal
 features of the room are a counter, with a large inset washbasin also
 made of stone, and a tall wooden cupboard.

 In your hunger, you dream of poached turbot on a platter. Or perhaps
 creme caramel.

>link cork to tea


 Bending your will, you form the link between the cork and the Tea
 Recipe.

>examine tea


 A cylinder of silver metal as long as the middle joint of your thumb.
 On the surface are a series of strange bumps, depressions, and
 grooves, seeming carefully wrought and utterly intentional. The core
 of the cylinder is hollow, but over one end is a piece of paper which
 bears a label, in careful lettering, which reads, "Tea Recipe."

>take it


 You can't reach far enough.

>unlink cork


 You succeed in unlinking the cork from the Tea Recipe.

>reverse link cork to tea


 Bending your will and all your attention, you manage to make a
 reverse-link between the cork and the Tea Recipe, feeling their
 properties begin to merge together.

 The Tea Recipe bobs to the surface of the water.

 The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
 overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
 carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
 manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
 you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
 scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
 you against their type.

 You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
 him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
 month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
 been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
 has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
 the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."

 But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
 your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
 fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
 You will just have to find what you can.

 (putting the dark wooden box into the sack to make room)
 It takes a bit of wiggling to get the cylinder to come free, but you

 The cylinder slips into place with a satisfying click, as though some
 mechanism has engaged.

>examine dial


 A dial which can be rotated to show one word at a time, labeled
 'SHAPE'. Currently the word showing is LEAF.

 In your hunger, you imagine in great clarity creme caramel, elegantly
 centered in its pool of sweet liquid and garnished with three-- no,
 make it four-- fresh raspberries. Or perhaps thinly-sliced venison,
 cold from the roast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables are a loaf of stale bread and a delicate

 You put the plate into the delicate contraption.

>turn on contraption


 There is a regretful clicking noise from the vicinity of the
 lid-catch. Just as you think you are going to have to close it
 yourself, a gloved mechanical hand reaches up and slams the
 contraption shut from the inside.

 The machine's gears spin into action; a series of fine flanges, like
 the keys of a music box, move into position against the surface of the
 cylinder, which rotates steadily. There is a faint grumbling from
 inside the machine, and the sounds of rearrangement...

 Ivory and powder-blue, with a tracery of blush roses.

 In your hunger, you hallucinate dark squares of prepared chocolate.

>enter shed



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shed</span>
 Disused for quite a long time, evidently. There is dirt in the
 corners, and some evidence of inhabitation by rodents or perhaps even
 a larger animal, now and then. Some rust stains on the walls indicate
 where tools used to hang, but no longer do.

 A rope ladder lies in a heap on the floor.

>take ladder


 Taken.

>examine it


 Made of hefty rope and still apparently sound, with rungs made of
 wood. At the top on each side is a hook, allowing it to be put on
 something (rather than tied).

>examine rust


 Streaks on the wall, nothing more. The phantom shapes suggest the
 former presence of a shovel, hoe, etc. Why they've been removed is
 anyone's guess, but it's quite clear that much of the landscape around
 the house has been let go, the kitchen garden remaining tended longer
 than everything else.

 You put the onion skin into the delicate contraption.

 You close the delicate contraption.

 Exactly on the hour, the cuckoo clock opens up its door and a
 mechanical bird flies forward. It sings 12 times, then withdraws into
 its little door.

 It consists of the face, a pendulum and pair of weights, and a little
 door above the face that opens when the hour is struck. It is
 currently on and ticking.  The clock shows the time to be 12:00.

 In the mechanical clock is a cuckoo.

 Against one wall is a glass case full of rare and valuable clockwork
 figures.

 The case is specially made of glass and wood. Inscribed into the
 surface of the glass with a fine cutting tool are the words: "CAREFUL!

 Inside are mechanical dancers and a clockwork bee.

>examine bee


 A life-sized golden bee, its wings made of planed gems. It is,
 unfortunately, equipped with an ingenious equivalent of a sting -- a
 tail endowed with blades that will cut into any sensitive thing it
 settles on. And these have been tipped with a vicious poison.

 The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
 overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
 carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
 manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
 you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
 scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
 you against their type.

 You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
 him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
 month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
 been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
 has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
 the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."

 But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
 your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
 fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
 You will just have to find what you can.

 Originally a salon for the receiving of guests; but in recent years
 the Count has become increasingly interested in his own projects, and
 has taken over the entire room for the storage of books. Bookshelves
 line the walls, reaching above your head, leaving exits only east and
 south.

 The clockwork model universe has stopped; a beam of light from the
 "sun" at the center, focused through Jupiter, shines in the direction
 of the shelves, highlighting a spot where <span class="floydstyle em">The World Is Hollow</span>

 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables are a loaf of stale bread and a delicate
 contraption (which is empty).

>examine bread


 A roughly rectangular loaf of bread, reddish brown, and shriveled to
 rock-like hardness by being left to sit around for so long. The fact
 that it went uneaten is explained by the fact that one face is burnt
 black -- someone left it in the oven too long, evidently.

 You open the bag on a string, revealing some silver coins.

 In your hunger, you hallucinate onion soup, with its crust of baked
 cheese. Or perhaps a heavy Christmas-time cake with candied fruit and
 smothered in brandy, such as Englishmen sometimes bring with them to
 Paris. And you have always considered them an abomination heretofore.

>examine dancers


 The dancers are antique, and peculiar. Their costume replicates an
 English mode of the sixteenth century: the lady wears a skirt of
 beaten copper, pierced in designs, and around the gentleman's neck is
 a ruff of folded silver, though with long neglect it has begun to
 darken. As for their skin, it is all carved ivory.

 They both of them stand on a floor made up of cogs, to permit them to
 spin and dance around.

 there have been a few occasions when it became helpful against
 brigands in the street. The design at the hilt is a bit ornate, but

 Linking yourself is generally considered a very bad idea.

>examine brie


 Oozing and ripe, somehow. You would expect it to be thoroughly ruined
 by now -- this is not a cheese that should age -- but the Count's
 powers were diverse, and extended to careful protections of his
 possessions.

 chicken.

 You sit down at the piano and begin to play, as you have not in years:
 a minuette.

 The dancers, as though touched by the music, come to life. They meet,
 and bow, and then begin to dance, now taking hands, now letting go,
 now apart, now together, up and down their cogged dance floor.

 While the dancers dance, the characters on the Count's letter begin to
 shuffle themselves: each sixth letter steps out of line, bows, and
 slides across the paper into a new position. The punctuation, the
 capitalization, fade away in the brisk music, and new forms appear.

 <span class="floydstyle em">there are some matters you must know of. First-- I have laid aside</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">some provisions, a small store only, against disaster: money, letters</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of introduction to certain persons, but most of all the means to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">defend yourself, if need comes. They are hidden, and the ways to find</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">them woven up long ago where only the proper light will show it.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">You're a clever girl, Marie. I know you will not resort to them</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">heedlessly.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Look after the servants: they have been loyal and good all your</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">life. If you find you wish to sell any of the odder things I brought</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">your mother, don't give them away cheap. They'll fetch a large price</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"And last -- my dear girl, this will come as a shock to you, and I</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">am sorry. But when you were stuck in the well as a child, and so close</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to death, I became desperate, and took the very dangerous step of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">linking you to Pierre, so that you would not die as long as he lived.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">So you see, it was not only gratitude that made us raise him almost as</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">your brother, but concern for your very life, since your mother and I</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">knew that as long as he was healthy and well, so would you be.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Therefore, child, keep an eye on him, and if ever he is in want, look</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">after him carefully. I know that you are fond of him in any case, but</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">think on this in addition: his very life is yours."</span>

 It is signed, <span class="floydstyle em">"Your loving father."</span>

 You can't see any such thing.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Staircase, First Floor</span>
 The top of a broad curving stair: east is the long salon that goes the
 length of the house, downstairs are the foyer and the grand receiving
 rooms.

 North is the old conservatory.

 Extremely spacious. It is its best with a half-dozen servants in

 An old gothic door framed in stone leads west. The wooden door is

 The cuckoo clock ticks sullenly.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 Originally a salon for the receiving of guests; but in recent years
 the Count has become increasingly interested in his own projects, and
 has taken over the entire room for the storage of books. Bookshelves
 line the walls, reaching above your head, leaving exits only east and
 south.

 The clockwork model universe has stopped; a beam of light from the
 "sun" at the center, focused through Jupiter, shines in the direction
 of the shelves, highlighting a spot where <span class="floydstyle em">The World Is Hollow</span>
 used to be.

 On one wall is an enormous portrait of the Count's father, from the
 hand of Hyacinthe Rigaud.

>take bauble

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Root Cellar</span>
 Stone walls, ribbed ceiling, but only a packed-earth floor in spots.
 The room is lined on both sides with boxes and barrels, which take on
 odd shapes in the semi-darkness and seem vaguely menacing. You feared
 this room as a child, and it still seems cold and unnerving.

 The twisting stairs ascend to the ground floor.

 Through the open door to the east you can make out the foot of the
 servants' staircase.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bottom of Servants' Staircase</span>
 An awkward wedge of space between the foundations of the main house
 and the walls of the new-built wine cellar, east. The staircase does
 not leave much room to stand in; it is straight and carefully planed
 lest anyone trip with a priceless bottle of wine.

 The wine-cellar door -- sturdy wood in yellowish brass panels --
 stands open to the east.

 An ordinary wooden door opens west into the root cellar.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen Corridor</span>
 A narrow corridor between the kitchen and the main house, which has a
 thick separate wall. The two buildings are only barely attached, to
 discourage fires. A small staircase leads down.

 Double doors give west onto the main house.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables is a delicate contraption (which is empty).

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen Garden</span>
 West is the wall of the kitchen. Most of the space along the wall is
 planted with herbs -- bay, parsley, stalks of mint -- left of the open
 doorway. To its right is only a drainage ditch, catching the outflow
 of a pipe that comes through the wall.

 In one corner of the plot is the well, drilled many deep feet; in
 another is the antique sundial.

>fill cup with water from well


 You put some water in the cup. This fills the cup to the brim.  The
 water mixes with what was already there.

>link cup to well


 You valiantly try to link the two objects, but they are just too
 dissimilar.

>examine well


 A dark circle of stone, the depths of which you cannot see. The water
 comes up within reach.

 A bar of iron crosses the well, to support a bucket on a rope (which,
 however, is itself lacking).

 In the well is a body of water.

 You put some water in the cup. This fills the cup to the brim.

>link water in cup with water in well


 Liquids repel linkage, not being discrete bodies. (The Count once
 demonstrated this by linking a block of ice and letting you watch the
 link fade as the ice warmed.)

 The sun burns off some of the water and onion dye.

 the roof, in a shape little longer than a man's body, and just tall

 the air, the web of strong protections. The room does not seem to have

 reasons he is not to be executed.

 The text goes on to add that these matters are to be kept private, but
 that Marie is female heir effective to the Count's line, with all the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Chapel</span>
 The old private chapel, octagonal-shaped, with tall windows of stained

 Here the family used to hold its private worship services, keeping a
 form of the official religion that would no doubt have scandalized the
 parish curate.

 There's a conspicuous rat-hole where the stone floor meets the wooden
 beams.

>examine rat-hole


 A dark concavity, lined with the gathered debris of past services;
 bits of paper curled into the shadows, and string, and gnawed grey
 cloth. Most notably, there are a gilded key, a wadded paper and a rat.

>touch rat


 Keep your hands to yourself!

>take key


 (the gilded key)
 The rat nips your fingers sharply, drawing blood. You squeeze the
 offended digits until the flow is staunched. "Bastard scion of
 Lucifer!" you yell at it.

 It stares back at you beadily.

>punch rat


 A bare-handed attack is not likely to get you very far.

>kill rat with sword


 (first taking the sword)
 You draw the sword from its sheath. You stab. It dodges. The point of
 your sword buries itself into the wood and takes a moment to pull out
 again.

 With this kind of luck, it's going to take a lot of stabs before you
 get anywhere. Maybe you'd be better off with a subtler strategy.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 A grand room, for dining in style. The plastered ceiling is several

 You take the hinge-lidded teapot, freeing up the hole again.

>examine wedge


 Oozing and ripe, somehow. You would expect it to be thoroughly ruined
 by now -- this is not a cheese that should age -- but the Count's
 powers were diverse, and extended to careful protections of his
 possessions.  Of the wedge, only a couple of pieces remain.

>examine salers


 An aged, creamy yellowish cheese with an uneven grey-brown rind. It
 has a sharp and distinctive flavor, though it does not fall under the
 category of stinky cheeses.

>slice

 then both bee and rat fall still, the one spent, the other dead.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine bee


 A life-sized golden bee, its wings made of planed gems. It is,

 The worn and winding staircase is not so easy to climb, you find; it

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedchamber of the Count and Countess</span>
 As a child, you were never allowed in here; it is the only part of the
 house that is completely unfamiliar to you, though some parts were
 better known than others. The room, like the chapel below it, is made
 of stone, unfaced; high windows, clear rather than stained glass,
 admit a pure light. It is also octagonal, and the ceiling ribs meet at
 a boss overhead, shaped like a coiled dragon.

 It does not have the bare appearance of most of the other rooms of the
 house. There is a full company of furniture -- a tall-backed ebony and
 ivory chair, poster bed, wardrobe, inlaid florentine table. A
 staircase of worn stone steps leads back down.

 On the inlaid table are a fanciful book and an unfinished letter.

 There is a trunk in the middle of the room, its lid thrown open and
 its contents beginning to spill out.

 It seems to be set in Italy and to involve a number of improbable

 let her out of them again (but then always irritatingly departs
 without a word).

 The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
 overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
 carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
 manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
 you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
 scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
 you against their type.

 You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
 him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
 month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
 been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
 has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
 the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."

 But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
 your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
 fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
 You will just have to find what you can.

 West is the wall of the kitchen. Most of the space along the wall is
 planted with herbs -- bay, parsley, stalks of mint -- left of the open

 of a pipe that comes through the wall.

 In one corner of the plot is the well, drilled many deep feet; in
 another is the antique sundial.

 A tangle of climbing roses covers almost completely the wall and door
 of a shed to the southeast.

 "Is he very strict? Does he beat you?"

 "No, of course not, Maman. It is just as though he were my own Papa."

 She frowned, looked away. "And I suppose you are learning all sorts of
 things," she said.

 "Oh, yes, much more than at home."

 She made a little gesture; then her mood changed. "But you must be
 missing the sweet bread I make at home, no? I'll bring you some in a
 basket."

 "No, Maman, the cooks make me anything I want."

>examine vase


 A tall vase of some kind of turned stone, ornamented somewhat on the
 outside but neatly cylindrical inside.

 In the vase are some dead roses.

>take it


 (putting <span class="floydstyle em">The Lavori d'Aracne</span> into the sack to make room)
 Taken.

>eat roses


 (first taking the dead roses)
 (putting the fanciful book into the sack to make room)
 They're plainly inedible.

>examine wardrobe


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine window


 Windows framed in the old style, arched at the top with a little knot
 of carved flowerettes and ribbon-work.

>look out window


 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>search window


 Through the windows you can see the gardens -- first a wide patch of
 green, and then the flower plots delineated by hedges and topiary, and
 the scattered statues.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Count's Study</span>
 A large room with windows that face south, and a fireplace along the
 east. The place is a mess. Other rooms have looked bare, but this
 one-- this room has been ransacked. Furniture has not simply been
 removed or disarranged, it has been thrown around, in some cases even
 chopped up. The handsome secretaire has been turned into splinters.

 North is the doorway into the room that was once your bedroom.

 An open door leads back west into the corridor.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long Salon</span>
 A long empty room with shined wooden floors, perfect for sliding in
 stocking-feet. West is the top of the staircase, and rooms open to the
 north and east.

 The door to the Count's study stands open.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Staircase, First Floor</span>
 The top of a broad curving stair: east is the long salon that goes the
 length of the house, downstairs are the foyer and the grand receiving
 rooms.

 North is the old conservatory.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance Hall</span>
 Extremely spacious. It is its best with a half-dozen servants in
 livery. The floor is Italian marble.

 The main staircase ascends to the corridor on the second floor, and a
 smaller version leads down into the dim basement. Doors also open
 north and northeast.

 An old gothic door framed in stone leads west.

 A sad heap of used yellow brocade huddles on the floor here.

 On the wall is one of those mechanical clocks that pop open on the
 hour, allowing the ingenious internal figures out to play.

 The cuckoo clock ticks sullenly.

>go east


 The south door leads only out of the estate, where you are not ready
 to go. You can go only north, west, northeast, up or down.

 The cuckoo clock ticks sullenly.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 Originally a salon for the receiving of guests; but in recent years
 the Count has become increasingly interested in his own projects, and
 has taken over the entire room for the storage of books. Bookshelves
 line the walls, reaching above your head, leaving exits only east and
 south.

 A clockwork model of the universe stands in one corner.

 On one wall is an enormous portrait of the Count's father, from the
 hand of Hyacinthe Rigaud.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 A grand room, for dining in style. The plastered ceiling is several
 times your height. The air now is cool and deep, the sunlight glancing
 through the windows and scattering from the chandelier, putting points
 of light at your feet, over the table, across the painted wallpaper
 and the handsome wood paneling.

 Woodworked columns frame the exits west and southwest.

 Heavy double doors open east to the kitchen.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen Corridor</span>
 A narrow corridor between the kitchen and the main house, which has a
 thick separate wall. The two buildings are only barely attached, to
 discourage fires. A small staircase leads down.

 Double doors give west onto the main house.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A long, cross-beamed room, originally washed with white, though smoke
 has tinged the walls above the massive fireplace in which roasts are
 prepared. In addition, there are thick high tables that run the length
 of the room.

 To the east is the kitchen garden through which you entered; west is
 the corridor that connects with the main house. To the north there is
 the little scullery, and upstairs is the attic where the servants
 sleep.

 On the kitchen tables is a delicate contraption (which is empty).

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen Garden</span>
 West is the wall of the kitchen. Most of the space along the wall is
 planted with herbs -- bay, parsley, stalks of mint -- left of the open
 doorway. To its right is only a drainage ditch, catching the outflow
 of a pipe that comes through the wall.

 In one corner of the plot is the well, drilled many deep feet; in
 another is the antique sundial.

 You can see a cup (which is empty) and a sticky mixture of mead,
 water, and onion dye here.

>link bag to sack


 You valiantly try to link the two objects, but they seem as though
 they will never go together.

>take swordstick


 (putting the ivory silk gown into the sack to make room)
 Taken.

>wear swordstick


 You can't wear that!

>wear pin


 (first taking the jeweled pin)

 You slip the jewelled pin on. You close the jeweled pin.

 You can't wear that!

>save

 Ok.

>drop sack


 Dropped.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a rat corpse (as far from yourself as possible)
   a jeweled pin (being worn)
   a swordstick
   some dead roses
   a vase
   a gilded key (which opens the tall door)
   a bracelet (being worn)
   a hinge-lidded teapot (which is open)
     a slice of brie
     some mead (which leaves some room in the hinge-lidded teapot)
   a bag on a string (being worn and open)
     a celestial bauble (providing white light)
   a dashing hat (being worn)

>drop all


 There are none at all available!

>put roses in teapot


 You put the dead roses into the hinge-lidded teapot.

>put rat in teapot


 You put the rat corpse into the hinge-lidded teapot.

>put key in teapot

 You put the gilded key into the hinge-lidded teapot.

 You close the hinge-lidded teapot.

 Dropped.

 The sun burns off some of the mead, water, and onion dye.

>drop vase and swordstick


 vase: Dropped.
 swordstick: Dropped.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep in the Well</span>
 You cling to the rope ladder, deep within the well. The sky has
 narrowed above you to a coin of pale blue. The damp stones brush
 against your body as you move, no doubt leaving stains on the elegance
 of your attire, but there is no longer time for such concerns.

 An opening in the north wall. You could crawl, if you chose.

>go north


 You squirm your way through the close packing of stones, a tunnel not
 much wider than your body...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Room</span>
 A room like a coffin of rock: rock lines the floor, packed rocks vault
 the roof, in a shape little longer than a man's body, and just tall
 enough to accommodate you in sitting upright. There is an odor of
 dampness and vague decay, though you can feel, brushing round you in
 the air, the web of strong protections. The room does not seem to have
 been soaked, despite the water level in the well outside.

 The sloping passage leads back into the body of the well, to the
 south.

 Pushed to one side is a heavy box.

 You can also see a round stone and a mirror here.

>examine mirror


 It is, or should be, a mirror, but it is surrounded by odd markings. A
 spot at the bottom of the frame seems worn by touch. At one point
 there is what would seem to be a maker's mark, an ornate letter C.

>say couligne


 (to the mirror)
 When you speak the word, the mirror brightens somewhat, attentive to
 your intentions.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>touch mirror


 The mirror brightens and clears.

 You make out the image of Marie, alone, in a room high in a tower. The
 place is bare, except for a cot, and the clothes she is wearing.

 On the wall of the room you can discern the painted emblem of the
 house of D'Envers.

 Marie rubs at the handcuffs, shifting her hands.

>examine handcuffs


 (the handcuffs through the mirror)
 Ugly, thick metal that bind Marie's wrists.

 Marie shifts uncomfortably from one position to another.

>link handcuffs to pin


 (the handcuffs through the mirror)
 You valiantly try to link the two objects, but they are just a little
 too different. Maybe if they looked more alike.

 Marie shifts uncomfortably from one position to another.

>link handcuffs to bracelet


 (the handcuffs through the mirror)
 Bending your will, you form the link between the handcuffs and the
 bracelet.

 Marie shifts uncomfortably from one position to another.

>remove bracelet


 You take off the bracelet.

 Marie pokes at her hair hopelessly, perhaps trying to restore it to
 some semblance of order.

 The handcuffs fall open. Marie appears surprised, but not too
 surprised to react; she immediately pulls the handcuffs off fully and
 throws them on the ground.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>examine marie


 (Marie through the mirror)
 She seems bedraggled and dispirited. She is wearing a good dress, but
 it has been on her for a while, and is ruined by damp and dirt, and
 frayed at the hems.

 Marie sits down against the wall, with a disgusted expression.

>examine emblem


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cot


 (the cot through the mirror)
 It looks mostly clean, at least, which is a mercy.

 Marie sits down against the wall, with a disgusted expression.

>examine mirror


 It is, or should be, a mirror, but it is surrounded by odd markings. A
 spot at the bottom of the frame seems worn by touch. At one point
 there is what would seem to be a maker's mark, an ornate letter C.

 Marie pokes at her hair hopelessly, perhaps trying to restore it to
 some semblance of order.

>search it


 In the mirror you see reflected some handcuffs, a cot, Marie and a
 window.  Around the edges you can make out other indications of Prison
 Room.

 Marie sits down against the wall, with a disgusted expression.

>examine window


 (the window through the mirror)
 The window seems to be glass, but with iron bars across it, ensuring
 against an easy escape even if the hypothetical escapee could reach
 it.

 Marie sits down against the wall, with a disgusted expression.

>look in mirror


 In the mirror you see reflected some handcuffs, a cot, Marie and a
 window.  Around the edges you can make out other indications of Prison
 Room.

 Marie walks across the width of the room and stands looking up through
 the high window for a moment.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a jeweled pin (being worn)
   a bracelet
   a bag on a string (being worn and open)
     a celestial bauble (providing white light)
   a dashing hat (being worn)

 Marie pokes at her hair hopelessly, perhaps trying to restore it to
 some semblance of order.

>link pin to window


 Bending your will, you form the link between the jeweled pin and the
 window.

 Marie sits down against the wall, with a disgusted expression.

>open pin


 You open the clasp. Naturally, the pin falls off.


 Marie flinches as the window swings abruptly open, spraying bits of
 stone as it does so. You can't hear through the medium of the mirror,
 but you imagine that it must make a great deal of noise: Marie puts up
 her arms around her head as though to protect her ears and face.

 Then she takes them down again.

>wait


 Time passes.


 Marie goes to where the cot is and pushes it under the window,
 obviously in preparation for climbing out.

 Just as she does so, however, the door behind her opens, and D'Envers
 walks in. He says something sharply, which you are unable to hear. She
 feels around on the bed; you see her hand close around something
 behind her, and your hopes rise -- but then you see it is only a
 pillow, roughly round in shape.

>link pillow to bauble


 (the pillow through the mirror)
 (first unlinking the celestial bauble)
 You succeed in unlinking the celestial bauble from the sunlight.
 You valiantly try to link the two objects, but they are just too
 dissimilar.

 The conversation in the mirror seems to be growing more heated.
 Marie's fingers tighten on the pillow, which, unfortunately, does not
 look likely to protect her against a beating from D'Envers.

 As for her captor, his breathing has gotten faster and there is a red
 flush in his face, which is probably the prelude to violence.

 It is now pitch dark in here!

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Room</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>reverse link pillow to stone


 (the pillow through the mirror)
 Bending your will and all your attention, you manage to make a
 reverse-link between the pillow and the round stone, feeling their
 properties begin to merge together.

 D'Envers strides towards Marie, and she swings the pillow in his face;
 it hits so hard that his head snaps back and his nose streams blood.
 He falls without even crying out.

 Marie stands over him for a moment, startled. She leans forward and
 touches D'Envers' wrist, and then stands up and kicks him hard in the
 ribs.

 Only then does she climb out the window...

 Marie sips from the cup of coffee in her hand. "I still do not
 understand," she says, "why you were at the estate in the first
 place."

 You shrug. "I had-- certain obligations."  Her eyes meet yours, and
 she waits. "Gambling debts," you elaborate. "I was hoping your father
 would advance--"

 "I did not know you gambled."

 "Under ordinary circumstances, I do not. I was-- led into it, in a
 way, by an acquaintance, and found myself indebted through him to the
 Baron D'Envers. He became quite unpleasant about the matter."  You
 examine your fingernails. "In the event, it seems that I am absolved
 of these debts. I doubt his heir will press them."

 She nods. You consider whether to tell her the rest of what you
 learned. But she speaks first, frowning into her cup. "I should tell
 you, Pierre, it might not be a coincidence, your trouble with
 D'Envers."  She bites her lower lip. "You see, he was pressing me to
 marry him, and he might have had the impression-- that is to say, he
 might have thought--"

 You raise your right eyebrow. "If you used me as an excuse, Marie, do
 not worry about it," you say, with great generosity. "I have been the
 subject of more embarrassing rumors."

 She opens her mouth again, and you smile...
