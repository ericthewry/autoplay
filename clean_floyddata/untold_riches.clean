 You were reluctant to undertake another adventure with Professor
 d'Squarius, especially after the last near-catastrophe. Escaping from
 the Tomb of the Screaming Mummies had been treacherous enough, but
 then to have to go back inside because the professor lost his keys in
 some snake pit? Frankly, you had begun to question whether his
 treasure hunts were worth it.

 But the professor spoke persuasively about this new quest -- "for
 untold riches!" he claimed -- and, in the end, you agreed to join the
 expedition. Since then, things have gone exactly the way they always
 do: horribly.

 You tried to tell the professor that bringing a harpoon into an
 inflatable lifeboat was a bad idea. But, like always, he dismissed
 your objections with the usual "you're just the teenage sidekick"
 line. And now YOU are the one stranded on a remote tropical island
 with no clear way of getting back to civilization.

 And the amazing treasure you were originally seeking? The professor
 never explained precisely what it was.

 An Interactive Fiction by Jason Ermer
 Release 1 / Serial number 150927 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 You are on a deserted beach, alone except for the salty breeze, the
 waves splashing rhythmically on the sand, and a single palm tree that
 provides very little shade from the harsh sun. The beach extends to
 the southeast, and a path to the west leads into the rainforest.

 The flat husk of a once-inflatable lifeboat has washed up nearby.

>examine me

 You are the young assistant to Professor Edsger d'Squarius,
 adventurer-archaeologist.

 You and the professor have been through a lot together. You bravely
 charted the Grave of the Headless Vikings (at least until the swamp
 gases started to make you hallucinate). You ventured into the secret
 network of catacombs beneath Stonehenge in search of the Lost Codex of
 Zethar the Druid (it's still lost; you never found it). You have even
 seen the summit of Mount Everest (from a distance).

 And every time the professor has gotten into some bizarre or dangerous
 predicament (which is most of the time), you've been there to bail him
 out.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   the silver whistle (being worn)

>examine whistle

 The silver emergency whistle hangs from a nylon lanyard that you are
 wearing around your neck.

 The whistle was one piece of emergency equipment that the professor
 put you in charge of (the other was the emergency beacon, which seems
 to be missing).

>blow whistle

 The shrill sound of the emergency whistle is both loud and irritating.

>get lifeboat

 The deflated lifeboat has outlived all usefulness. There's no point in
 carrying it around.

>search lifeboat

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine tree

 The smooth trunk of the palm tree stretches up about twenty feet and
 ends in a fan of wide, green leaves.

>climb tree

 You're quite skilled at climbing trees -- and it's a good thing. When
 the professor was captured by the Cannibal Warriors, you scrambled up
 a tree and avoided detection. Later (but still before brunch!) you
 climbed down and helped the professor escape.

 Unfortunately, climbing this particular tree doesn't yield any new
 information. You climb back down.

>swim

 You and the professor once traveled in search of the Ukrainian Falcon,
 a golden bird encrusted from beak to claw with the rarest jewels. The
 professor learned that it had been left behind in the exclusion zone
 around the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. You journeyed up the Pripyat
 River, but you had to turn around when your boat was attacked by a
 school of giant, phosphorescent catfish.

 Since then, you've avoided recreational swimming.

>PRAY

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>sing

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>xzzy

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>xyzzy

 You recall a different tropical archipelago, far from here, which you
 and the professor traversed in hope of finding the Chachapoyan
 Fertility Idol. After that, whenever he needed a vacation, the
 professor would sometimes go back to Zabba, Deffe, Hijji, Noppo, and
 Tuvvu (and sometimes Xyzzy).

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tide Pool</span>
 This part of the beach probably floods completely when the tide comes
 in: all the sand has been washed away and only large rocks remain.
 Their many pockets and indentations are filled with pools of seawater.
 The beach becomes more sandy to the northwest and to the west, a large
 crack in the rocks leads down into a dark cave.

 A reddish-brown crab scuttles from pool to pool, its pointy legs
 clicking faintly on the stones.

 There is a long plastic tube here. It must have been left behind the
 last time the tide went out.

>get tube

 Taken.

>examine tube

 The long, waterproof tube has a tight-fitting cap. Large documents,
 like blueprints and maps, can be rolled up and slid inside for
 protection.

>open tube

 You open the waterproof case, revealing the professor's treasure map!

 When the pirates were starting to close in, you tried to convince the
 professor that you should be the one to carry both the map and the
 key. Instead, the professor took the map himself and, inexplicably,
 tied the key to Aziz's leg. He put you in charge of the emergency kit:
 the whistle (which you're wearing) and the beacon (which seems to be
 missing).

 The fact that the map case has washed up on the beach might indicate
 bad news for the professor, maybe even worse than that time he was
 almost devoured by man-eating spiders in the Shrine of the Cursed
 Knights.

>read map

 (first removing the map from the waterproof case)
 The sheet of yellowing parchment shows the outline of an island,
 hand-drawn in black ink. Most of the terrain is just sketched in, but
 the northwest region is mapped out in great detail and shows some
 unusual red symbols.

 It looks a little like the map the professor had that time you drove a
 dog sled through the arctic in search of the lost city of
 Tuktuyaaqtuuq. That's probably just a coincidence, though.

>examine symbols

 The symbols in the northwest region of the map are drawn in red ink.
 (At least, you think it's red ink?) They depict a face looking
 directly west at a seven-pointed star.

>examine crab

 It's hard to read the facial expression on a crab, but it doesn't seem
 very happy to see you.

 Untold Riches has been developed for use during the 2015-2016 school
 year as part of an interdisciplinary curriculum for the middle grades
 on computer programming and creative writing.

 Gameplay design principles were derived from the rules of
 IFBeginnersComp ([<a href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/IFBeginnersComp">LINK</A>]), in
 particular: (1) The initial goal should be clear from early on. (2)
 The puzzles should be fair and well-clued. (3) The world should be
 thoroughly implemented (no unwinnable states, good coverage of scenery
 and synonyms).

 Implementation design principles were based on the idea that the
 source code will be discussed as novice programmers learn to create
 their own games. The code should therefore aim to build game elements
 using the simplest implementation and as much "entry level" Inform 7
 functionality as possible.

 Comments, questions, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome. Please
 contact the author, jasonermer at gmail.

 You pass from the bright, warm sunlight of the tide pool to the cool

 It's as dark as the ocean floor. (You know that's a valid comparison
 because you and the professor once journeyed by submersible to the

 owned by Louis XVI.) You hear the occasional drip of water into some

 When the water recedes, you see the emergency beacon rolling in the
 surf. What luck!

>take beacon

 Taken.

>examine beacon

 The beacon was one piece of emergency equipment that the professor put
 you in charge of (the other was the emergency whistle).

 It's designed to float, but more importantly, to make you visible at
 night. It won't be of much use in the bright sunlight.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cavern</span>
 The yellow light of the emergency beacon reflects wetly off the
 irregular, black walls of the cave. Drips of water echo from some dank
 corner through the chilly underground air.

 A path exits this chamber to the east, and a rusty iron gate leads
 west. A long ladder stretches up, past the limit of the beacon's weak
 light and into the darkness.

 Leaning in the corner is an old shovel.

>get shovel

 After that time you and the professor got buried alive in the tomb of
 Pharaoh Humnatune you said you never wanted to use a shovel again...
 but it's been a while and you've calmed down quite a bit.

 You pick up the shovel.

>dig

 The ground here is too rocky for digging. You'd need a pickaxe or
 something to even make a dent, and you haven't seen one of those since
 the professor had you chip through the floor of the Biblioteca di San
 Barnaba on a hunch that it would uncover a secret passage. He was
 wrong, of course, and had to pay the library big bucks to repair the
 tile.

>go up

 You climb the ladder for a long time. After a while the rough rock
 walls of the cave smooth out and you find yourself ascending through
 the interior of a smooth stone cylinder. A minute later you emerge in
 a room filled with bright sunlight.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lantern Room</span>
 This room is at the very top of the island's lighthouse. The walls of
 this octagonal room are all made of glass, and you have a panoramic
 view. From here you can see that this island is just one of many that
 make up an archipelago. You notice a ship several miles away sailing
 in and out of sight among the many islands.

 In the center of the room is the lantern: a high-powered electric lamp
 nested inside a set of massive rotating lenses. Underneath the lens
 array, on the lantern's support pedestal, is a large power button.

 You can also see a tub of grease here.

>turn off beacon

 You switch the beacon off.

>get grease

 The professor once dangled you by your feet over the La Brea tar pits
 so that you could pull out a crate filled with twenty-eight pounds of
 stolen diamonds. You got it just moments before it sank forever into
 the sea of sticky, black gloop. The grease in the tub looks just like
 that tar, which you were cleaning out from under your fingernails for
 weeks.

 Anyhow, you pick up the tub of grease.

>examine tube

 The long, waterproof tube has a tight-fitting cap. Large documents,
 like blueprints and maps, can be rolled up and slid inside for
 protection.

>examine tub

 This tub contains a thick, black grease used to lubricate the gears of
 the mechanism that causes the bright beam of the lighthouse to sweep
 across the night sky. (Of course, that only happens if it's nighttime
 and if the lighthouse is operational, neither of which is currently
 the case.) The grease is applied using the paintbrush whose bristles
 are stuck in the goo.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Workshop</span>
 This cave has been turned into a small workshop with an assortment of
 furniture on one side and an array of machinery on the other.
 Everything in the room is damp from the constant mist churned up by
 the cascade of falling water at the cave's entrance, which lies to the
 west. There is a rusty iron gate in the eastern wall.

 Among the machinery is the room's most impressive feature: a massive
 water wheel, which is attached to a long horizontal track in the wall.
 At the near end of the track you see a crank and a kind of display
 panel.

>examine furniture

 The cramped workshop includes a drafting desk, stool, and a sleeping
 cot.

>examine desk

 The desk is tall and has a single drawer. Some papers are scattered
 across its surface.

>read papers

 The papers show engineering sketches for an electrical network which
 connects five structures on the island. The design shows a cable
 starting at the water wheel, running through three intermediate power
 stations, and terminating at the top of the lighthouse.

 The big metal crank juts from the wall at the near end of the track.
 Mounted on the wall above it is a control panel.

 The control panel displays five small light bulbs in a horizontal
 line. Currently, all of the lights are off.

>examine wheel

 The water wheel is enormous: it reaches almost all the way to the
 ceiling, and its blades are wider than your armspan. It is currently
 motionless, though it is obviously designed to spin on its axle. The
 axle connects the wheel to the track that runs horizontally along the
 wall.

>turn wheel

 The water wheel is far too big and heavy to be turned by hand. The
 force of the falling water, though, may be strong enough to get it
 spinning.

 water, it starts turning -- slowly at first, but it gradually picks up
 speed until it is spinning rapidly.

 The dense canopy of leaves breaks up the sunlight. The ground is

 both flowering and decaying plants.

 Trails to the west and southwest meander through the trees, and the
 way back to the beach is east. A steep cliff rises up directly to the
 south, and to the southeast you see a steep climb that goes up towards
 its summit.

 You also see something quite out of place in the natural surroundings:
 a mechanical device is poking out from among the ferns.

 Perched on the thick-stemmed leaf of a nearby banana tree sits Aziz,
 the professor's parrot. His blue and yellow feathers contrast brightly
 with the green forest backdrop.

>get parrot

 Aziz lets out a loud squawk, and swipes at you with a claw. Then he
 bobs his head back and forth a few times while uttering an angry hiss.

>examine device

 Based on the look of it, the device must be some kind of power station
 that routes electricity to another part of the island: The device has
 a glass dome on top and a single button labeled ON/OFF. At the base,
 thick electrical cables snake both southwest and southeast (up the

 Trails to the west and southwest meander through the trees, and the
 way back to the beach is east. A steep cliff rises up directly to the
 south, and to the southeast you see a steep climb that goes up towards
 its summit.

 A power station is poking out from among the ferns.

 Perched on the thick-stemmed leaf of a nearby banana tree sits Aziz,
 the professor's parrot. His blue and yellow feathers contrast brightly
 with the green forest backdrop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Grassy Plain</span>
 The dense forest thins and becomes a wide plain. There are no trees

 Standing alone in the center of the wide plain is an enormous stone

 You are on a deserted beach, alone except for the salty breeze, the

 provides very little shade from the harsh sun. The beach extends to
 the southeast, and a path to the west leads into the rainforest.

 The flat husk of a once-inflatable lifeboat has washed up nearby.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tide Pool</span>
 This part of the beach probably floods completely when the tide comes
 in: all the sand has been washed away and only large rocks remain.
 Their many pockets and indentations are filled with pools of seawater.
 The beach becomes more sandy to the northwest and to the west, a large
 crack in the rocks leads down into a dark cave.

 A reddish-brown crab scuttles from pool to pool, its pointy legs
 clicking faintly on the stones.

>wear gloves

 Wow, do you wish you'd had a pair of gloves like these that night all
 the donkeys got sick while you were trekking down into the Canyon of
 the Ancient Monks. You told the professor not to let them eat so many
 blackberries, but he wouldn't listen.

 Anyhow, you put on the gloves.

>get crab

 You pick up the crab. It pinches away at you furiously, but the thick
 canvas gloves protect your hands.

 The parrot scratches at the ribbon tied to its leg.

>give crab to parrot

 "CRAB SNACK!" the parrot caws with joy.

 Aziz jumps off the banana leaf and sails toward the crab, wings and
 talons outstretched. Before you know it, the bird has snapped its
 claws around the crab and started flapping up into the canopy of the
 rainforest. You hear a soft, metallic thump on the ground nearby, and
 then the parrot is gone.

>get key

 If you had a dollar for each little key you've had to keep track of
 over the years. In fact, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History
 recently requested to borrow the professor's key collection for a
 public exhibition. That's been put on hold, however, until the
 professor can find the key to the safe in which he keeps his key
 collection.

 Anyhow, you pick up the key.

>examine key

 The brass key is about as long as your finger. Professor d'Squarius
 was sure this key would grant you access to the vast riches he spoke
 so vaguely about.

 Standing alone in the center of the wide plain is an enormous stone
 head.

>examine head

 The monolithic sculpture, made of pitted red stone, is in the shape of
 an enormous head with a long nose. The statue's eyes, two bright
 copper plates embedded in the stone, gaze southeast over the waving
 grasses.

>examine plates

 The monolith's copper eyes catch and focus the bright sun. Together
 they project a brilliant beam of light on the ground to the southeast
 of the statue.

>examine map

 The sheet of yellowing parchment shows the outline of an island,
 hand-drawn in black ink. Most of the terrain is just sketched in, but
 the northwest region is mapped out in great detail and shows some
 unusual red symbols.

>examine symbols

 The symbols in the northwest region of the map are drawn in red ink.
 (At least, you think it's red ink?) They depict a face looking
 directly west at a seven-pointed star.

>dig

 The monolithic sculpture is facing southeast, whereas the symbols on
 the map show a face looking west. Perhaps it is possible to turn the
 statue so that it faces in that direction.

>turn head

 To turn the scuplture so that it faces a particular direction, use the
 command 'turn sculpture to direction'.

>turn statue to west

 By pushing on the its long nose you are able to turn the statue so
 that it faces west.

>dig

 You dig at the precise location where the light from the monolith's
 eyes hits the ground. After a few minutes of working, your shovel
 clanks hard against stone! A few minutes later you have cleared off a
 mysterious stone circle in midst of the grassy sea.

>circle

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine circle

 The circular stone reminds you of a manhole cover. Its surface is
 engraved with a seven-pointed star.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   the brass key
   some gloves (being worn)
   a tub of grease
   a shovel
   the beacon (providing light)
   the map
   a waterproof case (open but empty)
   the silver whistle (being worn)

>examine cover

 The circular stone reminds you of a manhole cover. Its surface is
 engraved with a seven-pointed star.

>examine star

 (the stone circle)
 The circular stone reminds you of a manhole cover. Its surface is
 engraved with a seven-pointed star.

>get cover

 The stone circle is just scenery and can't be taken.

>move cover

 You are able to pry the stone loose and open it just like a manhole in
 the street. When you do, a gasp of stale air escapes the chamber
 beyond. It smells ancient, like the air inside the Mausoleum of the
 First Qin Emperor, a necropolis guarded by the Terra Cotta Army, which
 you and the professor entered in your search for an intricately-carved
 jade funeral urn containing the ashes of Qin Shi Huang. (You couldn't
 find it.)

>I guess it couldn't be implemented as "fixed in place"

 I couldn't understand your entire command, although the first part
 matched the action take inventory.

>examine chamber

 The circular stone has been dragged aside to reveal a circular hole
 and a dim chamber below.

>SAVE
>cf3
 %% Enter a save filename to write:

>go down

 You lower yourself through the circular hole and drop to the floor.
 It's not a long drop (you can easily climb back out) but your impact
 kicks up a cloud of dust that has been undisturbed for a long time.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vault</span>
 You are in a cylindrical chamber. The floor and curved walls of this
 subterranean room have been lined with smooth stones. Light falls in
 through the circular opening in the low ceiling, glinting off the
 specks of dust that drift in the air.

 In the center of the room squats a wooden chest wrapped in iron bands.

>examine chest

 The wooden chest and its rounded lid are striped with bands of iron.
 An ornamental key plate surrounds an oblong keyhole.

 Adventuring with the professor has landed you in front of many
 treasure chests just like this one. You recall one that contained a
 huge hoard of Aztec gold, and another that contained nothing but a
 single platinum teaspoon (which, rumor had it, once belonged to Crown
 Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria).

 The fact that this chest looks exactly like all the others makes you
 that much more curious about what's inside.

>open chest

 It seems to be locked.

>unlock chest with key

 The brass key clicks perfectly into place and turns with a gentle
 twist of your wrist. You've done a lot to get here, and only one
 simple step stands between you and the professor's amazing treasure
 (whatever it is).

>open chest

 Gingerly you open the chest, revealing its contents.

 Inside, you behold an object so magnificent it defies description. No
 wonder Professor d'Squarius didn't get into detail about this amazing
 treasure! It's too incredible for words.

>examine treasure

 It's amazingly lifelike. Except for the number of feet, of course.

>again

 You want to examine it more and more closely, but part of you is
 worried you'd knock all the scales out of alignment (or maybe those
 are feathers).

>again

 It resembles the lost treasure of Nuuk'ta, although obviously smaller
 and not lost.

>again

 It's as though a blind jeweler carved it based on a poet's
 description.

>again

 It stirs up a complex set of emotions in you, the way only true art
 can. You find yourself simultansously drawn to it and repulsed by it.

>again

 It seems oddly perfect that the candle holder on the left is so much
 more countoured than the other five.

>again

 You study all the interlocking pieces, each one more delicate than the
 last... When you snap out of it, you're not sure how much time as gone
 by.

>again

 There really are few words to describe what an amazing treasure it is.

>again

 There really are few words to describe what a remarkable object it is.

>take treasure

 You carefully remove the object from its container. It is certainly a
 piece that curators and collectors from Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum to the
 British Museum will be clamoring for. Plus, the professor (if he's
 still alive) would be immensely proud of you for finding it.

 None of that matters, though, if you can't get off the island. So,
 onward!

 south, and to the southeast you see a steep climb that goes up towards
 its summit.

 A power station is poking out from among the ferns.

>power station

>examine power station

 The device has a glass dome on top and a single button labeled ON/OFF.
 At the base, thick electrical cables snake both southwest and

 You climb up the steep slope toward the top of the cliffs. After a
 while, you emerge into the sunlight.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lighthouse</span>
 You are on a rocky point that rises up through the canopy of the
 trees. Steep cliffs drop into the rainforest in every direction except
 to the northwest, where a steep path leads down. From this high perch
 you can see many of the other small islands that make up the
 archipelago.

 A tall, cylindrical lighthouse rises into the sky next to you,
 overlooking the ocean and the jungle below. Snug up against the curved
 stone wall is another power station.

 The area around the lighthouse is populated with a troop of playful
 monkeys who hoot and screech as they chase each other around.

>examine power station

 The device has a glass dome on top and a single button labeled ON/OFF.
 At the base, thick electrical cables snake northwest (down the slope).

>press button

 The monkeys react when you approach the power station. Howling in fear
 and aggression, they gather up into a tight pack between you and the
 lighthouse before you can get anywhere close to it.

>examine monkeys

 The monkeys, tense and aggressive, crouch in a cluster between you and
 the lighthouse. Thirty pairs of eyes scrutinize your movements.

>grease monkey

 Putting grease on the monkeys would achieve nothing.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   the amazing treasure
   the brass key
   some gloves (being worn)
   a tub of grease

   the silver whistle (being worn)

>blow whistle

 The piercing scream of the emergency whistle causes the monkeys to
 panic! Terrified, they scramble across the rocky ground, jump off into
 the trees, and go leaping and swinging down through the jungle. In
 just a few seconds, they are all gone.

 Your wall-climbing skills are quite good. Otherwise you never would
 have been able to infiltrate the headquarters of the Clan of the White
 Lotus in order to recapture the San Tilapian crown jewels. But you had
 ropes that time. There's no way the vines here will hold your weight.
 You might instead try the path to the southeast.

>examine vines

 The steep cliff is taller than the tallest rainforest trees. Clinging
 vines snake their way up the rocky wall, here and there dangling long
 chains of magenta flowers. A trail toward the top of the cliffs rises
 steeply to the southeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Waterfall</span>
 You are in a lush rainforest clearing, surrounded by steep cliffs.
 Clinging vines snake their way up the rocky wall, here and there

 northeast. A large waterfall to the east roars and churns up a dense
 cloud of mist.

 Another power station is poking out from among the dense foliage
 beside the waterfall.

>press button

 You press the button on the power station. With a puff of ozone, the
 glass dome flickers with green light and the device begins to emit a
 low hum.

 You have a brief flashback to that time in Philadelphia when the
 professor found, and then cranked up, Ben Franklin's original
 lightning machine. The main difference this time is that the power
 station doesn't explode.

>go east

 Be careful: Carrying the treasure map through the waterfall would
 certainly destroy it.

>put map in tube

 You roll up the treasure map slide it into the tube.

>close tube

 You close the waterproof case.

>go east

 You walk through the curtain of water, getting pelted and soaked in
 the process.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Workshop</span>
 This cave has been turned into a small workshop with an assortment of
 furniture on one side and an array of machinery on the other.
 Everything in the room is damp from the constant mist churned up by
 the cascade of falling water at the cave's entrance, which lies to the
 west. There is a rusty iron gate in the eastern wall.

 Among the machinery is the room's most impressive feature: a massive
 water wheel, which is attached to a long horizontal track in the wall.
 At the near end of the track you see a crank and a kind of display
 panel.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lantern Room</span>
 This room is at the very top of the island's lighthouse. The walls of
 this octagonal room are all made of glass, and you have a panoramic
 view. From here you can see that this island is just one of many that
 make up an archipelago. You notice a ship several miles away sailing
 in and out of sight among the many islands.

 In the center of the room is the lantern: a high-powered electric lamp
 nested inside a set of massive rotating lenses. Underneath the lens
 array, on the lantern's support pedestal, is a large power button.

>press button

 You flip the lamp's switch and the room is immediately filled with the
 brightest light your eyes have ever squinted to avoid seeing. It
 shines out from the lighthouse and soon attracts the attention of the
 passing ship.

 Fortunately, it is Captain Atlee's ship and within an hour or two, you
 find yourself safely back among her crew. You also find yourself
 reunited with Professor d'Squarius!

 "You found it!" he cries when he sees you holding the amazing
 treasure. "Fascinating," he says as he studies the piece. "I had read
 about it having handles. But why would it need so many?"

 Back in his cabin, the professor tucks the amazing treasure into a
 padded crate and tells the story of how, after the lifeboat deflated,
 he got caught in a current that carried him away from the island. At
 some point he was spotted and scooped from the sea by Atlee, who had
 managed to escape the pirates with her skillful maneuvering.

 "While you were away, I had a look at that." He gestures to one of
 several maps piled up on the table. The parchment shows a maze of
 twisty little passages, all alike. "Seems like there's loads of good
 stuff squirreled away in there."

 The story of what happens next -- your confusing trek through that
 network of caves, the unlikely method by which you slay the fearsome
 dragon, the clever way you recover the priceless (but impossibly
 delicate) Ming vase -- is a story that must wait for another day.
