 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Empty room</span>
 This room is full of silence.  Freshly disturbed dust hangs upon the
 air.  There are patterns of pressure upon the carpet, suggesting there
 are spaces where once there weren't.   The walls are bare, but for the
 occasional pictureless hook.  There is a wardrobe here, a chest of
 drawers and a skeleton of shelves against the far wall.

 The only way out is to the west onto the upstairs landing.

>examine me


 You've been better.

>examine wardrobe


 The wardrobe casts a knobbly shadow against the bare wall behind it.
 The door hangs very slightly open, showing a crack of darkness.

>open wardrobe


 You step into the wardrobe and sit down in the space, pressing your
 senses against the emptiness as if longing alone is enough to create
 something from nothing.  With your eyes closed you can almost feel the
 soft pressure of Celine's clothes against your face and breathe in the
 scent of her rising from the disturbed fabric.  But you cannot delude
 yourself for nearly as long as you would like to.  This wardrobe is
 empty.  There is nothing here, and you get out again before you start
 to feel foolish.

>examine chest


 A pale pine set of drawers.

>open chest


 There is no point opening them because you know they contain nothing,
 and you don't want to have to remember everything that's gone.  All
 her scarves, and rings, and pretty things.

 You are carrying nothing.

>examine shelves


 These shelves are a framework for nothing but air.  The books they
 held not so very long ago evade you now.

>examine carpet


 The carpet is the colour of sand, as though the room has become a
 tideline, washed clean of its cockleshell memories and mermaid-hair
 dreams.

 I don't know how to say this without sounding like an arse, but
 Eurydice is a text adventure about grief.  Although there are a few
 puzzly elements, it's mainly a mood piece, focused more on exploration
 and atmosphere than problem-solving. It's meant to have a sort of
 dreamlike quality to it so don't worry if you don't immediately know
 what you're supposed to be doing.

 Eurydice isn't exactly over-endowed with special commands because I
 lack the programming werewithall for anything that cool.  I hope most
 of the things you might want to do are accomodated in the body of the
 game anyway and that context-specific actions are adequately sign
 posted.  But you might want to consider the following: PLAY (a musical
 instrument should you acquire one), TALK TO (for interacting with
 people) and TURN AROUND (under a very specific set of circumstances).
 I would also recommend that you try repeating actions if it seems
 appropriate, since you will likely find they have different outcomes -
 especially when it comes to talking to people.  With reference to
 TURNING AROUND, if you happen to be in a situation in which it might
 not be ideal to TURN AROUND, doubling back on yourself will also
 count.

 More thanks than I can say to my friends and loved ones - you may be
 few in number but you are great in heart.

 And many many many thanks to my long-suffering, unsuspecting beta
 testers: Issy, Guy, Julian, Jessica, Dan, Shim and Arthur, with
 special thanks to Issy for the lovely artwork.

 Also, um, to Emily Short (who has no idea who I am - and for that
 matter I don't know who she is) but without her I wouldn't know a damn
 thing about Inform 7.  In all honesty, I still don't know that much.
 The actual coding underpinning this thing is a terrible mess, but
 that's not Emily Short's fault.  Pro tip: if you want to learn how to
 use Inform 7 don't start with an absurdly convoluted story about
 bereavement.

 living room downstairs.

 To the north is Dave's room, to the west your own.  The empty room

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">your room</span>
 Your room is a complete mess.  The bed is unmade.  The bookshelves
 that once lined the walls are a ruin of fallen books and splintered
 wood.  There are piles of things that shouldn't be piled everywhere.
 All the things you thought you cared about feel like mockery.

 A mysterious lyre, slightly battered from possibly having fallen from
 your bookshelves, lies among the wreckage.

 Behind you, to the east, is the upstairs landing

>examine lyre


 It looks out of place.  It is not an especially beautiful object; if
 anything it seems worn.

>play lyre


 You really have no idea how to even begin to play a lyre.  You pluck
 at the strings a bit and they make a sad little sound sound like
 elastic bands vibrating over an empty ice-cream tub.

>practice lyre

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">dave's room</span>
 Dave's room is little more than a storage space.  The bed is just a
 bare mattress and there are boxes of books - mostly yours - piled
 everywhere.  Damp socks, and half-finished laundry, strew the floor.

 The upstairs landing lies to the south.

>examine books


 You own far more books than can be stuffed onto your shelves - here
 they live in boxes and gather dust.  Every now and then you open them
 up and rifle through them and it's like meeting old friends you forgot
 you cared for.

>take books


 You don't really feel in the mood for digging through your books.

>examine bed


 An uncovered bed really gives a place a transient look.

>examine socks


 Dave's socks are plentiful and, truthfully, not entirely pleasant.
 They are bought in bulk by his parents and are therefore always
 identical, bobbly and embroidered - incongruously - with Ws.  You are
 not sure if they are damp because they have recently come out of the
 washing machine or because they desperately need to go in it.

>take socks


 Even in the extremity of grief, you cannot imagine willingly touching
 Dave's socks.

>finish laundry

 room.  From here, you can hear a murmur of voices coming from the
 living room downstairs.

 To the north is Dave's room, to the west your own.  The empty room
 that was Celine's is to the east. There is a flight of stairs leading
 up to John's room and another going down to the ground floor of the
 house.

>go up


 You pad about halfway up the staircase and then a vague sense of guilt
 assails you ... you probably shouldn't be snooping around in John's
 room.

>go up


 There is so much guilt washing about at the moment that violation of
 privacy hardly seems like bothering over and you make your way up the
 stairs to John's room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">John's Room</span>
 John's room occupies the attic spaces.  It is a room of peculiar
 geometries.  The whole place is a mess at present, and the blinds of
 the skylights are down so that triangular shadows cast themselves
 across the walls.  There are no obvious signs of Celine, but why would
 there be?  There is the jester's mask she bought John for Christmas
 hanging on the wall.

 Lying on the floor, in a corner, is a plastic bag

 The stairs down will take you back to the upstairs landing.

>fight guilt


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine bag


 It is a weirdly bulbous shape. The handles are knotted together so it
 looks as if the bag has bunny ears.

>examine mask


 From last Christmas, you seem to remember, another lifetime.  Like all
 Celine's gifts, it came exquisitely wrapped - black and gold, perhaps,
 to match the mask itself.  You wonder if Celine's box of wrapping
 paper, ribbons and decorations is still beneath the eaves, or if her
 parents took that too.  "Why go to all that trouble for something
 that's just going to be ripped off?" you'd ask.  But Celine loved the
 ephemeral.  And, so, apparently did you.

>open bag


 You undo the tight knots with difficulty and look inside, already
 knowing what you'll find.  The contents gleam silver like pirate
 treasure - the empty packets of Celine's medication you found on the
 floor of her bedroom the night she disappeared.  It is not the first
 time you have asked yourself if you should have insisted on taking it
 with you to the hospital, but it is not a question you dare ask
 yourself too often.

>examine eaves


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine packets


 Diazepam ... fluoxetine ... aripiprazole ... the names fly past you,
 tangling your tongue up in a merciless succession of rarely used
 letters.  Most of the packets are empty but not all.

>get them


 I'm not sure what "them" refers to.

>get packets


 You rifle through the packets and eventually find one that isn't
 gutted. You pop a couple of pills from their foil cocoon ... although
 they represent a peculiar form of memorabilia to say the least.

>examine pills


 (the pills)
 Smallish, off-white, round, innocuous, except not.

 The stairs down will take you back to the upstairs landing.

>open blinds


 You stand beneath the skylight and draw up the blinds.  From this
 peculiar angle you can see nothing but sloping roofs and an expanse of
 endless sky.  Light as bright as orange juice pours down from the
 setting sun but it is not warm.  After a moment or two, you let the
 blinds fall back into place.  You don't want John to know you were
 messing about in his room.

>examine mask


 A black and gold jester's mask, with empty eyes and a wry, mocking
 mouth.

>close bag


 You attempt to re-tie the knots - God knows why - but the plastic is
 too stretched.
>get mask


 You have no intention of stealing it but you unhook it carefully from
 the wall and, after a moment of hesitation, place it against your
 face.  The interior of the mask is cool and smooth, like dead skin.
 You look out at the world from a different face, your peripheral
 vision imprisoned by the edges of the eyeholes.  You trace your
 fingers over the painted smile.  It strikes you as no less real than
 any other expression you have worn lately and it is with reluctance
 that you return the mask to its place on the wall.

>take mask


 Better not keep indulging yourself with painted fancies.  Besides, it
 belongs to John and you shouldn't really be fiddling with it.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   some pills

 room.  From here, you can hear a murmur of voices coming from the
 living room downstairs.

 To the north is Dave's room, to the west your own.  The empty room
 that was Celine's is to the east. There is a flight of stairs leading

 house.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">downstairs hall</span>
 Winter light lies in anaemic strips upon the floor from where it has
 fallen through the glass panels in the front door.  There is an awful
 painting hanging on the wall. The murmuring voices are more of a
 babble now; too many over-lapping conversations create an alien,
 baboonish gibberish.

 The outside world lurks to the west and the living room to the north.
 Or you could always just retreat upstairs.

>examine painting


 You painted this - in the loosest sense of the word - when you were
 about eighteen and nurturing an over-inflated sense of your own
 creativity.  It is a black canvas with a heavily textured shape of
 reddish swirls in the middle and a speckling of white stars in one
 corner.  Sometimes it looks like a wound, sometimes like a freshly
 forming galaxy.  Your last housemate thought it was something obsence.
 So much for your aristic soul.  Ho hum.  So much for your artistic
 soul.

>examine panels


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine door


 You can't see any such thing.

 There are too many voices for you to be able to make out much of any
 conversation.  Besides, eavesdropping is the most foolish of vices.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">living room</span>
 There are lots of people gathered in the living room.  Stepping inside
 unfortunately catches the attention of the one you like least.  Laurie
 clatters towards you and, before you can do anything to save yourself,
 captures you in a hug you feel vaguely socially obligated to endure.
 You hold yourself as rigid as a blade until she goes away again.  The
 rush of hatred you feel towards her is positively intoxicating.

 There are so many people here.   Have they come to ... what? Stare at
 the bereft?  Why?  Is this how other people grieve?  En masse?

 Your housemate John is sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of
 the coffee table, frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch,
 sits opposite and appears much more laid-back about the whole
 business.  Rick is slumped on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow;
 Elsie is sitting next to him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is
 huddled in a cloak on the other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking
 almost as uncomfortable as you probably do.  As for Laurie, she's
 leaning against the fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite
 suffering like she's living her own little Victorian melodrama.

 And finally, in the far corner of the room by the open door to the
 kitchen, like a person in its own right, is the last piece of
 household furniture you bought in consultation with Celine: a wrought
 iron coat stand.  So nouveau-gothic darling.

 Your escape routes are east into the kitchen or south into the hall

>examine laurie


 Laurie is small and pretty, pale with apparent grief, and you despise
 her.  She's only here because she's dating Twitch (although they are
 both fucking other people) and she must have met Celine all of twice.
 You suspect she is enjoying the enactment of tragedy.

>examine john


 You remember the first time you invited John and Celine to come to
 dinner.  You can see them now on the doorstep, John slightly behind,
 handsome and distinguished in a military-style coat with gold buttons
 and braiding, Celine, in black just like always, holding out to you a
 hand-tied bouquet of flowers the colour of her lipstick, and smiling.

 Jess leans her head against Adrian's shoulder.

>examine twitch


 You only know Twitch by reputation.  He is an old school friend of
 Celine's and your paths have never crossed.  He looks like the
 clinically depressed stoner he is, which is not devoid of a certain
 glamour. He has restless fingers and idle eyes.

 Twitch steeples his fingers as he ponders the board in front of him.

>examine jess


 You cannot look at Jess at the moment without remembering the drive
 the hospital, stars streaking overhead, the slow drip-drip-drip of
 time in the waiting room, and the hushed, awkward solemnity of a brief
 bedside visitation.

 Laurie stands behind Twitch, combing her fingers through his lightly
 curling hair.

>examine adrian


 You find a flickering of kindred in Adrian's glance.  You are sure he
 finds this gathering almost as unendurable as you do.

 Rick opens a new bottle of port.

>examine rick


 Rick is a man not suited to inaction.  On the sofa like this, he looks
 like a pile of himself.  The port he is drinking is surely of
 excellent quality but it seems to afford him little pleasure at the
 moment.

 John sighs heavily as he loses yet another game of Go.

>examine elsie


 You don't know Elsie very well, but this mainly because there is not
 much overlap between your lives bar some friends in common. She has
 always struck you as a terribly nice person.

 Jess leans her head against Adrian's shoulder.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">living room</span>
 The extensive living / dining area was one of the features that drew
 you all to this house when you were looking for places to rent.  That
 and - despite the fact none of you have been able to bring yourself to
 do anything as prosaic as cleaning for days - the fact it's not an
 abject shit hole like most of places on offer when you were doing the
 rounds.

 Currently, it's all cluttered with people. Your housemate John is
 sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of the coffee table,
 frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch, sits opposite and
 appears much more laid-back about the whole business.  Rick is slumped
 on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow; Elsie is sitting next to

 other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking almost as uncomfortable as you

 fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite suffering like she's
 living her own little Victorian melodrama

 The coat stand is still in its corner, looming like an unexpected
 guest.

 Your escape routes are east into the kitchen, or south into the hall.

 Laurie paces back and forth in front of the fireplace, her fuck-me
 boot heels clomping on the wooden floor - clearly she is not garnering
 enough attention to feel comfortable.

>examine game


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine coat stand


 You seem to own far more coats than four people living in a house
 could possibly need or want.  The metal of the coatstand is almost
 entirely obscured beneath fabric.  One of your own coats is just
 visible.  There are two identical big brown dusters belonging to Dave.
 Celine's slightly shabby, soft velvet jacket.  A zebra-striped hoodie
 of John's.  His big military coat with the golden buttons.  More
 beneath.

 Someone makes a desultory remark.

>examine my coat


 It's just your coat.  Long, black, ordinary, equipped with a belt you
 never bother to tie, buttons you never fasten and pockets with no
 linings, where you keep losing things.

 Jess and Adrian converse in soft whispers.

>examine pockets


 There's a distortion in the fabric way down at the very bottom of the
 coat, as if something has slipped between the lining and the coat
 itself.

 Adrian tries to catch your eye.

>examine distortion


 You can't see any such thing.

>get coat


 You unhook your coat with difficulty from the coatstand, nearly
 over-toppling the whole teetering structure.  Folding it over your
 arm, you can feel the edge of something caught in the lining.

 Somebody asks the Rick the time.

>examine lining


 You can't see any such thing.

>search pockets


 Digging through your pockets, your fingers catch the edge of something
 that has fallen down into the depths of the lining.  After an
 impressive display of digital dexterity, you fish out a 50p coin.

 Adrian picks one of the Sunday paper supplements from the pile on the
 coffee table but discards it when he discovers it's about two weeks
 old.

>talk to adrian


 Under different circumstances you would actually quite like to talk to
 Adrian.  Maybe you are deluding yourself with suspicions of kinship
 but you can more readily imagine yourself saying something that feels
 true to him than anyone else.  But how can you speak of anything in
 this company, at this time.  Better not to talk to him at all.

>catch adrian's eye

>examine coin


 This is exactly what it looks like, except it is relatively freshly
 minted and has a brightness to it that would have delighted you when
 you were a small child.

 Jess pulls out a notebook and begins writing, or sketching, something
 in it and then gives up.

>talk to john


 "How's the game going," you ask.  There is a pause as John considers.
 "I'm losing," he concludes finally.  "Oh," you say.

>again


 "How are you doing?" you ask, since it is the officially sanctioned
 question at a time like this.  "Still losing," he says.  You didn't
 mean the game, and you're pretty sure John didn't either but it's
 probably better this way.

>talk to laurie


 God no.  You don't want to support her delusion that she has any place
 here. If you tried to talk to her, you might have to kill her.

>kill laurie


 You leap across the living room, shrieking like all the legions of
 hell and throw yourself at Laurie, in a whirlwind of clawing, biting,
 hitting, kicking and spitting ... or at least you imagine doing it.
 It's not, in any sense, a real temptation, pleasurable though it would
 be to wipe the condescension from her face.

 Jess pulls out a notebook and begins writing, or sketching, something
 in it and then gives up.

>talk to jess


 You wonder what to say to Jess but her ways are not your ways and
 despite mutual affection there are times when your differences seem
 less like intriguing points of interest upon the tourist map of your
 psyches than insurmountable barriers to understanding or accord.

 other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking almost as uncomfortable as you
 feel.  As for Laurie (fucking Laurie), she's leaning against the
 fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite suffering like she's
 living her own little Victorian melodrama

 The coat stand is still in its corner, looming like an unexpected
 guest.

 Your escape routes are east into the kitchen, or south into the hall.

 Jess and Adrian converse in soft whispers.

>talk to rick


 "Care for some port, m'dear?" offers Rick, with a valiant semblance of
 his usual bonhommie.  "It's a very fine old tawny."  You don't doubt
 it but you aren't sure inebriation would be the best addition to your
 mood right now.

>examine port


 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to rick


 Rick produces a silver hip flask with a flourish.  "Absinthe?" he
 suggests, raising his brows, entirely conscious of the effect.
 Amusement temporarily alleviates the atmosphere in the room.

>talk to rick


 Rick reaches a hand into a shopping bag languishing by the side of the
 sofa.  "Iberian ham?" he says.  "Brie?  Some pate?"  You are starting
 to feel churlish but you keep shaking your head.

>talk to rick


 Rick has probably run out of random indulgent  foodstuffs to offer you
 by now, and you do not want to press in case the temporary semblance
 of normality founders.  You remember that some of the people in this
 room are your friends and that you will not always feel this way.

>talk to twitch


 Like most comprehensively broken people there is a touch of the
 rockstar about Twitch, and he wears it well. You are conscious of an
 uncomfortable intermingling of attraction and disdain, and that makes
 you rather shy of talking to him.

>ask john about dave


 (To communicate in Eurydice, TALK TO a character.)

>talk to twitch


 You really have no idea what to say to him.

>examine eurydice


 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to Elsie


 "Would you like a cup of a tea?" asks Elsie, the moment you step into
 her visual range.  You shake your head and thank her.  Elsie is a
 perpetual tea-maker.  It might annoy you in somebody else but Elsie's
 tea is the sincerest tea you have ever drunk.

>again


 "How are you doing?" you both say, at exactly the same time and with
 exactly the same intonation.  You smile awkwardly at each other.  "I'm
 okay," you say into the pause that follows.  "I don't think I am,"
 says Elsie, shyly.  Her honesty ripples through the room like a stone
 dropped into a fetid pond.

>again


 You feel obliged to click into comforting mode. It is not that you
 don't want to comfort Elsie, it's just you're afraid that all your
 words are lies.  "I have to believe that it's a choice she made," you
 say.  "She was so unhappy, you can understand why she did it."  But
 you don't.  You don't.

>again


 Elsie nods.  You wonder if her faith makes this even harder for her.
 You want to ask about it, but what can you say?  "So do you think
 Celine has gone to Hell for what she did?"  Maybe not.

>again


 Neither of you really dare say anything else.  It's too delicate a
 balance to maintain, between honesty and lies, compassion and cruelty.

>examine celine's jacket


 Yeah, you're going to look like a right doink in front of a bunch of
 people you used to call your friends if you start stroking Celine's
 jacket.

 John sighs heavily as he loses yet another game of Go.

 You seem to own far more coats than four people living in a house
 could possibly need or want.  The metal of the coat stand is almost
 entirely obscured beneath fabric.  There are two identical big brown
 dusters belonging to Dave.  Celine's slightly shabby, soft velvet
 jacket.  A zebra-striped hoodie of John's.  His big military coat with
 the golden buttons.  More beneath

 A conversation starts up but sputters out like a candle flame in less

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">living room</span>
 The extensive living / dining area was one of the features that drew
 you all to this house when you were looking for places to rent.  That
 and - despite the fact none of you have been able to bring yourself to
 do anything as prosaic as cleaning for days - the fact it's not an
 abject shit hole like most of places on offer when you were doing the
 rounds.

 Currently, it's all cluttered with people. Your housemate John is
 sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of the coffee table,
 frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch, sits opposite and
 appears much more laid-back about the whole business.  Rick is slumped
 on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow; Elsie is sitting next to
 him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is huddled in a cloak on the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">kitchen</span>
 You remember long, sun-drenched afternoons in here with Celine, baking
 and talking, filling up the kitchen with laughter, the scent of sweet
 things cooking and occasionally smoke and the smell of stuff you've
 burned to a crisp.  The kitchen is surprisingly spacious for a rented
 house.  It has faux-granite counter tops and matching tiling, and
 fitted cupboards in shades of coffee and cream.  It would be a
 pleasure to cook in such a kitchen.

 Scattered across the  worksurface nearest the hob is an array of
 cooking utensils, onion skins and pepper cores, including the wooden
 knifeblock you bought for a tenner in Boswells during a sale.

 Vera and Tilda (plants, not people, and therefore bearable) are on
 the little round kitchen table.

 Natalie is by the hob, stirring a pan of pasta.

 The back door leads into the back garden to the north, and, if you're
 feeling particularly brave (or masochistic), the living room is to the
 west

>examine vera


 Vera-the-Aloe is an aloe vera plant, hence the name.  You christened
 her in an excess of cleverness.  Celine grew her from a tiny shoot
 Her soil is dry, and her long leaves are droopy, fraying brown at the
 ends.

>water vera


 You lift Vera up, careful not to damage her trailing fronds and carry
 her over to the sink.  You are sure there is a better way to do this
 but you hold her under the tap until her soil is damp and then take
 her back to the table.  There is no instant improvement and you can't
 really tell if she looks any happier but you feel a bit better.  It
 would be just too hopeless of you to let Celine's plants die with her.

>examine tilda


 Tilda is also a plant, although you've forgotten what kind.  You named
 her Tilda after Tilda Swinton because she is a very beautifully
 androgynous plant.  She has green leaves, shiny as wax, and generous,
 open-mouthed flowers with immensely long, lascivious stamen.  Celine
 also bought and nurtured Tilda.  She seems to be fine.

>examine natalie


 Oh hell, you'd entirely forgotten Natalie was here.  She's come up
 from London for you, especially for you ... to be with you now in your
 time of need.  You know you ought to feel gratitude but you can't seem
 to muster any.

>talk to Natalie


 Natalie comes over and hugs you.  She is no Laurie but you find
 touching people, and being touched, difficult at the moment.  The
 world waits for you, or possibly recedes from you, behind a pane of
 glass, visible but inaccessible.  Somebody breaching it is a dull kind
 of ache.

>again


 "How are you doing, hon?" she asks, all warmth and sympathy.  You
 suspect "doing" is a polite way of saying "coping".  "I'm fine," you
 lie.  And, then, because it's so obvious a lie: "It's hard, of
 course."  "Yeah."  Natalie gazes you at with an expression that is
 starting to become familiar - why do people always look at the
 bereaved that way?

>again


 "I'm nearly done with the pasta," says Natalie, "so at least this way
 I'll know you're eating."  You mumble your thanks, inevitably sounding
 ungracious.  You feel monstrous, caged behind your glass, snapping at
 proffered kindness, howling at a heedless sky.

>again


 Seeing you lingering in this awkward, Natalie stops stirring and
 smiles at you encouragingly. "I'm here for you," she says.  "Do you
 want to talk?"  You have to bite back sarastic things you don't mean.
 So you keep smiling and shake your head.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">back garden</span>
 The back garden is really little more than a lawn-gone-wild and a
 weedy patio.  The sky is a cool grey curtain backlit by the weak sun.
 The chill air bites at your skin.

 You can get back into the house to the south.

>examine lawn


 The blades are tipped by an unhealthy yellow and sway indolently in
 the slight breeze.  As you watch, a violent ripple of motion seizes
 the stalks and whips them back and forth.  At first you think it must
 be the wind but then you see a blur of a new green in the grass and a
 snake slithers onto the patio.

>examine snake


 You would not have thought there were such snakes in England.  It is a
 strong, sinuous creature, dappled in black diamonds like a snake on a
 Snakes And Ladders board.  It has hateful yellow eyes, as blank as
 pieces of glass.  You are not by nature inclined towards
 anthropomorphisation but there is something both directed and

 Winter light lies in anaemic strips upon the floor from where it has
 fallen through the glass panels in the front door.  There is an awful

 baboonish gibberish.

 The upstairs landing is dimly illuminated from the light in the empty

 To the north is Dave's room, to the west your own.  The empty room

 All the things you thought you cared about feel like mockery.

 A mysterious lyre, slightly battered from possibly having fallen from

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marlborough road</span>
 This is just an ordinary street, lined by Victorian terraces, with
 their slightly over-ambitious moulding and bow windows.  In the
 distance you can hear the muted roar of traffic streaming down the
 Abingdon Road.  It is not quite suburbia but it's a pocket of Oxford
 unreached by spires, dreaming or otherwise.   The fading light is
 nonetheless tinged by gold.  The sky is a swirl of grey and pink, like
 the interior of a shell.  There is a biting promise of winter in the
 air.

 Hinksey Park is to the northwest, your house to the east, and other
 places lie elsewhere.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hinksey Park Gate</span>
 The gate to Hinksey Park is not far from your house but by the time
 you arrive the sky is already suffused by a greyness that has blotted
 out the potential glories of an Oxford sunset.  Night is snapping at
 your heels.  The park  is the old fashioned kind, a basic arrangement
 of paths and benches, grass and trees. The nearest bench is over-hung
 by a willow tree, which has wept a burthen of withered foliage onto
 the seat.  There is a lake, girdled by a path and an open air swimming
 pool.

 A river, which must be a tributary of the Thames, flows to the west.
 Malborough Road lies to the southeast.

>elsewhere


 That's not a verb I recognise.

 The lake is misshapen splodge in the gloom.  The breeze occasionally
 picks up ripples on the water.  At its edge, an enormous swan twists
 its neck towards the sky and flings wide its white wings like an

 You go into the park and sit down on the nearest bench, letting the
 darkness enclose you. You're not very far from the houses and the road
 but the light and the noise doesn't reach you here.  You could be in
 another world.  The feeling of being entirely alone saturates your
 skin like cold.  You listen to the almost imperceptible sound of air
 moving across the lake and through the scrubby grass.  Tilting your
 head back, you stare at the sky.  It looks as if it is made of stone.
 You wonder if this is how Celine felt, sitting on this bench perhaps,
 waiting to die, and stand up again hastily.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">river</span>
 The river is a snake of moving darkness.  There is a railway line
 running parallel on the other side and open fields after that.  There
 is some kind of flat-bottomed boat by the bank nearest to you, and a
 tall man, in a long coat, is standing in the bow of the boat.

 Hinksey Park is behind you to the east.

>examine tall man


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine man


 The man is so swathed about in garments it is hard to make out much
 about him.  He is imposingly tall, or would be if he didn't stand in
 the hunched-over fashion he does, and seems gaunt.  His hood is pulled
 down over his face, so you only occasionally catch glimpses of his
 profile: you piece together an impression of sharp-nosed pallor and
 pale eyes the colour of dirty water. One of his gloved hands rests
 upon the pole he probably uses to propel the boat through the water.

>examine boat


 You're not really an expert in boats.  This one seems to be designed
 upon similar principles to a punt, although it lacks the comfortable
 cushions, champagne and strawberries you know for a fact to be an
 essential part of any punting trip.

>give coin to man


 You toss the coin to ferryman.  It turns over and over in the air,
 flashing silver, and then he reaches out a gloved hand and engulfs it
 in darkness.  He carries it to his mouth and bites it.  "That's not
 silver," he says. But then he shrugs.  "It'll do.  In you get."

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">river</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>talk to man


 At your approach, the hood turns in your direction and seems to be
 sizing you up.  "This journey isn't for you," the ferryman says
 finally.  His voice is neither as deep nor as sonorous as the hood
 merits, and the words seem rehearsed somehow.

>again


 You open your mouth to protest but the man speaks before you have a
 chance.  He heaves a gusty sigh that causes his garments to billow
 around him alarmingly as if they contain nothing but smoke.  "Let me
 guess," he says, "you want to take it anyway."  Again, you attempt to
 answer him but he prevents you.  "There's no need to look like that.
 You're not the first, I doubt you'll be the last."

>again


 It is hard to tell beneath the hood but the man seems to be regarding
 you quizzically.  "Haven't I seen you before somewhere?" he asks.
 "There's something about you ... you seem a bit familiar."  You shake
 your head.  You have certainly never seen him before.  "No," he
 agrees, after a moment.  "I suppose that wouldn't be likely.  I'm not
 exactly in a position to receive repeat custom."

>again


 "Will you take me across?" you ask, propelled by some sort of instinct
 you cannot easily articulate. You hardly know what you'll find on the
 other side of the river, or why you'd want to get there.  The ferryman
 shakes his head, partly to emphasise an answer you are fully expecting
 to be negative but, also, you suspect, to express a kind of weariness.
 "I'll tell you what I tell you everyone who comes to the banks of the
 river and looks for me," he says finally.  "If you want to cross,
 it'll cost you silver and, under the usual circumstances, seven days
 of lamentation but I'll waive them on account of the cold weather."

>again


 There's no point trying to change my mind or haggle me down," says the
 ferryman, a bit impatiently. "Rules are rules.  No silver, no
 ferrying.  That's the way it's always been, that's the way it'll
 always be.  But between you and me you'd be better off going home in
 any case.  You have no place on my boat, no place on the journey and
 the end that comes is not your end."

>give coin to man


 You toss the coin to ferryman.  It turns over and over in the air,
 flashing silver, and then he reaches out a gloved hand and engulfs it

 You step into the boat.  There is a space for a single passenger but
 it is not  exactly luxurious.  You barely have time to sit down upon
 the damp wooden boards before the ferryman takes his first stroke,
 propelling the boat forward at an unlikely speed that causes the
 moving air to catch at you like icy hands.  You  remember that someone
 told you once that a punt can travel at 30 miles an hour in
 favourable conditions ... but this one slips across the moonslick
 water as effortlessly as if it is glass.  At any rate, you are glad
 that the man has sufficient  taste to punt from the Oxford end.  You
 tilt your head back.  You are going so fast that the stars are smeared

 man, or even a river.  How did you get here?  Where are you?  There is
 a set of open wrought iron gates before you, as intricate as briars.
 Beyond them, hazy in the darkness to the southeast, a round lawn,

 All three heads turn in your direction as you lift the lyre, and a
 strange shiver runs down the length of the beast's back.  If it was
 human you don't know what emotions you'd ascribe to it. It holds
 itself still and silent, only the heaving of its flanks to betray the
 fact it lives at all.  And you play, strange, savage music, spiralling
 out of the lyre, drenched inhuman colours, filling your mouth up with
 heat and the tang of metal.  Your heart tightens sickeningly in your
 chest, pulsing with the lyre strings, something like excitement,
 something like dread.  The dog trembles where it stands, its eyes
 ablaze.

>examine dog


 The beast strains against its bonds
>play lyre


 You feel as if you have been running, and running hard, and your
 fingers tremble on the strings, fearful of the lyre and its music.
 But everything has changed.  Softly, softly, comes the scent of green
 things growing, dark places, damp fur, warmth in your belly and all
 around, different songs.  You lose time, the names of things. The
 stars becomes nothing but distant light. Your four clawed feet trample
 complex concepts to nothing but travelled earth, and happiness is the
 flow of the night.  Then comes the creeping cold, not without, but
 within, and it snaps like winter at your heels.  And you don't know
 what it means that yours is now the only song, and yours the only
 pounding paws, and yours the fur and yours the hunger and you alone
 who slumber in the dark places and dream of dreams once shared.  The
 music fades to silence, and the dog slumps to the ground, ungainly
 now.  Its eyes fall closed and it seems to sleep.

>se


 You muster up your courage and sidle past the subdued monster, holding
 your breath lest you rouse it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford Hospital Approach</span>
 You could be visiting a stately home, or an Oxford college, or a
 country church, except you're not.  You know there are more modern
 constructions hidden away behind it, one of which - the severely acute
 ward - lies like Sleeping Beauty's castle behind thorns of metal and
 stone.

 Circling an oval of moderately well-kept grass is a gravel path and,
 beyond it to the west, a sandstone building gleams palely golden
 against the shadowed sky. The gates loom to the northwest.

>go west


 As you cross the lawn, your footsteps lost among the many you have
 already taken, you feel a horrible tightness round you heart as if
 someone had a hand round it and was squeezing. There is a burning at
 the back your throat, like a lump of tears and bile is stuck there.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Path</span>
 The path sidles away down the side of the main building, taking you
 away from facades.  Here, there are no country house lawns, no
 sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass,
 borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings
 that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of
 beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to
 Cotswold House and Wintle Ward.

 Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the
 east.

>examine vaughan


 You can see it, square and sensible, at the end of the path.

>go west


 As you walk down the path, a human cry breaks upon the silence and
 dies.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Exterior</span>
 Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
 which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
 also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.

 The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
 There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
 to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

>examine tree


 It is hunched over the bench like a sullen teenager, its leafless
 branches hanging, lethargic.

>examine bench


 Wooden, a little bit worn but not so much that it looks like nobody
 cares, only lightly besplattered with bird shit.

>sit on bench


 You sit on the bench for a brief moment.  Cigarette ends are strewn at
 your feet, riotously like rose petals, and from them rises a stale
 scent and a ghostly nicotine buzz.

>examine doorbell


 Strangely totemic, it has a button for you to press and a grill - such
 as you might find on the visor of the villain in a sci-fi movie - for
 you talk into.

>take ends


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine window

>examine door


 Blueish.  Doorish.  Very very lockedish.

>ring


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>push


 What do you want to push?

>button


 You depress the button and listen to the silence while you wait.  You
 do not trust the doorbell.  It demands your faith yet gives you no
 miracles.  It doesn't even buzz to let you know it's actually
 functional.  Finally, just when you have given up all hope in the
 doorbell, there is a crackling from behind the grill and a distorted
 voice asks what you want.

>talk to grill


 You mumble your name into the grill, and explain you have come to get
 Celine.  A warped sigh gusts out of the grill with such force you are
 surprised it doesn't ruffle your hair.  Then crackling dies away and
 the grill speaks to you no further.  You assume that that means
 someone is coming to open the door but for all you know they could be
 activating the lever that drops you into the alligator pit.

 You are starting to wonder if perhaps they've forgotten you're there,
 or if answering the doorbell is a mere hobby, when there comes the
 sound of muted rattling and banging from behind the door as someone on
 the other side begins the ceremony required to open it.  It is finally
 eased open, just enough for you to squeeze through, by a Nurse,
 glowering at the effort required to perform the most basic tenets of
 her job.

>examine nurse


 You recognise her as Celine's Named Nurse, although you're damned if
 you can remember what she's called. But then it's only fair.  She
 would, after all, insist on calling Celine "Selin" (which she hated)
 instead of Celine.  "Like Celine Dion." Celine had tried to explain at
 first.  "Ohhhhhh," said the Nurse, in the voice reserved for
 patronising utter crazies, "so *you're* Celine Dion."  Celine had been
 obliged to explain that she meant her name was spelled and pronounced
 similarly to the singer's, not that she believed she actually was
 Celine Dion.  She told you about the misunderstanding later, laughing
 to cover her embarrassment.

>talk to nurse


 You try to bring yourself to say something polite to her but it's like
 forcing up a chicken bone.  In the end your masochism only extends to
 a grimace-like smile.

>examine door


 The blue door stands open now, guarded by the Nurse.

 also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.

 The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
 There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading

 The Nurse stands huffily by the door as if opening it for you has been
 a Herculean labour the like of which she resented performing.

>go west


 As you edge past the Nurse, she put out a log-like arm to momentarily
 stop you entering.  "You'll need to see the Doctor first," she says,
 gruffly. "You can't take a patient away without the doctor's
 permission."  You nod your understanding, although your mind is full
 of Escape from Alcatraz visions, search lights flashing, sirens
 screaming and helicopters whirling overhead as you and Celine run,
 hand in hand, giggling into a different coloured future.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Corridor</span>
 There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
 over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do
 nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a
 distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously
 has no smell, underscored by a desperate edge of nicotine.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>examine pinboards


 They are covered in slightly scrappy, utilitarian messages.  The names
 of the nurses on shift.  Advertisements for a workshop on Coping with
 Psychosis.  The telephone number for Mind The Mental Health Charity
 (or, as their charity shop reminds you, Mind The Step).  Various
 advocacy services in case you should happen to find yourself in One
 Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest.

>examine bookshelf


 There are overly-rifled paperbacks, yellowed by use, stuffed
 haphazardly onto the shelves.  A quick glance at the spines reveals
 them to be without exception the kind of airport novels you probably
 wouldn't want to read even at an airport.  Or in a loony bin.

>examine table


 A plain, square table piled with sweating glossy magazines.  The
 titles blare at you but, somehow, do not appeal.

>get magazine

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Hall</span>
 This is the large, bow-windowed room you could see from outside.  Dull
 light washes in from the corridor behind you and flickers from beneath
 the door to the television room.  Square tables are neatly arranged
 and the far wall boasts a display of artwork.  Upon the air hangs the
 cloying scent of old, institutional dinners.

 The Doctor's Office lies to the north, the Vaughan Thomas corridor to
 the south.

>examine artwork


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine art


 You stare for a bit at the collage of pictures.  They seem touched by
 neither madness nor genius.  They look, in fact, like the sort of
 pictures you would attempt if you were in hospital and weren't very
 good at drawing.  One shows a childishly circular moon hanging in a
 bruise coloured sky.  Another, with precision but not skill, reflects
 the building in which you stand.  Someone has attempted a wolf, a
 bemused-looking, lopsided wolf.  A bowl of fruit, faded with apathy. A
 tree, competent  but for the hostile angles of its bared branches.

>examine wall


 You can't see any such thing.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Doctor's Office</span>
 This is a typical Doctor's office.  It has a clinical air, but no more
 than you would expect.  It is really very neat in here.  The walls are
 hung with what look to be modern art prints, all in identical frames,
 imprisoned behind glass.

 The Doctor is sitting behind the desk, his elbows resting atop it and
 his chin upon the platform provided by his interlocked fingers.

 The door to the south leads back to the dining hall.

>examine doctor


 He seems surprisingly young for his role.  His hair is coal black and
 his eyes only one shade lighter, stark against the white coat that
 hangs open over an austere pinstriped suit.  He has a stern, unlovely
 face and returns your regard steadily.

>talk to doctor


 "Yes?" The Doctor's voice is not quite impatient, but the clipped
 quality of it suggests it very soon will be.  "You know I cannot
 accede to your ..." He stops abruptly, as if searching for a word, and
 settles finally on "...request".  I suggest you let me send you home,
 where you belong."

 "I confess, you have surprised me," says the Doctor, although he does
 not look displeased about it.  "I had not anticipated that you would

 hand upon your shoulder is ice cold even though layers of fabric but
 it only hurts for a moment and then the Doctor, his office, and the
 Warneford are gone...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Home Again</span>
 You are standing on the pavement outside your house.  The street looks
 exactly as it always looks, except evening has crept fully across the
 sky during your wanderings and the nascent night is definitely cold.
 You are conscious, for a second or two, of a vague nagging feeling, as
 if you have left something behind, but it passes swiftly.  Hinksey
 Park still lies, like a shadow, to the northwest and the rest of the
 world awaits in every other direction.  The door to your house stands
 before you, waiting for you to open it.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a lyre
   your coat
   some pills

>open door


 The brass handle is as cold as the night air beneath your hand but,
 for once, the door does not stick. It swings open before you in
 invitation, spilling a treasury's worth of light over the front path.
 Warm air rushes out to greet you and, from within, you hear the
 strains of speech and laughter rising like a phoenix


     <span class="floydstyle i">*** Finis ***</span>

>talk to doctor


 Before you can speak again, the Doctor forestalls you.  "I'm afraid
 you will not change my mind with tragic looks or eloquent words.  I
 have seen and heard them all a hundred throusand million times
 before."  You wonder, briefly, whether you are supposed to challenge
 him to a game of chess or, possibly riddles.  "I cannot be tricked,"
 he says, as if in answer.  "Nor changed.  It is not my nature."

>again


 "Your insistence is as wearisome as it is predictable," comments the
 Doctor.

>play lyre


 Time seems to unravel around you like the fraying threads of a
 tapestry as you lift the lyre into your arms.  The Doctor is on his on
 his feet, his face pale with fury and his eyes ablaze, but it's too
 late to stop you.  Music fills the air like cherry blossom, sweetly
 drifting, falling like fleeting kisses upon the senses and fading as
 swiftly as a summer evening.   For a moment, the Doctor is tranfixed,
 his face naked in pain and sorrow, and then his cold hands are
 wrenching the lyre from your grasp.  The notes shatter into rainbows
 of refracted light and then they're gone.  There is a vicious crack,
 like a bone breaking, and the Doctor flings the pieces of the lyre to
 the floor.  In seconds nothing remains of the lyre but a sprinkling of
 dust the colour of old blood.  "Take her then," he cries, "take her
 and may damnation have you both.  You'll find Celine in the gardens
 beyond the Sun Room.  Take her with you, as you wish, but remember:
 don't turn around, or she's mine forever.

 The Doctor's Office lies to the north, the Vaughan Thomas corridor to
 the south.

>go south


 A young-ish, not entirely unpretty woman, who steals from the other
 inmates and has no visitors, is staring blankly out of a window at the
 shadow-sloshed world outside.  She turns, smiles hopefully and shyly
 at you and then flees.  You try to feel more kindness towards her but
 she pilfered Celine's favourite perfume.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Corridor</span>
 There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
 over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do

 This is a primitive conservatory of sorts.  It is by far the most
 attractive room in the Warneford, which reflects well on neither the
 Warneford nor the room.  It has wicker chairs and, disconcertingly,
 there is white-sheeted hospital bed against one of the walls.  The
 square, unbeautiful windows overlook the grounds and currently admit a
 spill of moonlight the colour of old milk.

 Now you notice a set of doors at the back of the room have been flung
 wide open, drawing you like a beckoning finger, west, towards the
 shadow-smothered gardens.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

>examine bed


 You can't see any such thing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford Gardens</span>
 Somebody tried.  Here there are the elements of a garden.  Grass,
 although it is mainly mud.  Banks of soil where perhaps flowers might
 grow.  Squatting shrubs, hunched in upon themselves.  And in
 silhouette the anorexic shapes of trees, stripped before the oncoming
 winter.  Moonlight forms puddles here and there.

 The Sun room waits to the east.

 Celine is sitting on a stone bench.

>examine celine


 Celine is beautiful but not today.  The monochrome palette of the
 Warneford has wrung her out.  Her clothes are too black, her skin is
 too pale, her eyes too dark.

>talk to celine


 Celine smiles to see you, convincing gladness, desperate eyes.  You
 exchange the usual greetings, the usual enquiries, and, as ever, she
 thanks you for coming to see her, as if it is a kind and wonderful
 thing and not a terrible strain for both of you.  You tell her silly
 stories of the colour of the October leaves and how much you're
 looking forward to the blossom trees.  She listens, and laughs, and
 pretends.

>again


 Celine is not feeling so good and will only tell you so if you press
 her.  She has - quite literally - forgotten the way home, along with
 everything she learned on her art history course last term.  She has
 forgotten the tombstone cake you made for Jess's birthday.  She has
 forgotten Rick's parents are dead.  She has forgotten the entirety of
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It'll come back, you tell her, don't worry,
 and anyway we can watch it all over again - think how much fun that'll
 be.  She listens, and laughs, and pretends.

 Celine tells you her secrets, the ones she hasn't forgotten, the ones

 You are assailed by the sudden certainty that Celine has not followed

 and everyone else in this terrible place have taken you for a fool.
 You whirl round, ready to re-trace your steps, to find her again and
 save her, to drag her out of here if you have to.  Your heart lurches.
 Dizziness sweeps over you.  The Warneford is dissolves around you like
 damp sugar.  You feel as though you're about to faint, and the last
 thing you see before you lose track of everything is Celine,
 wide-eyed, standing behind you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marlborough Road Again</span>
 Marlborough Road is greyish in the dawn.  It seems you have been

 beats only half-heartedly against your mind.  The world is a formless
 shadow around you and the door to the house stands before you, waiting
 for you to open it.

 Here on the Warneford lawn again you can see a streak of lightness at

 the Warneford.  Before you, to the northwest, the wrought iron gates,
 as tall as thistles to a child, inevitably sealed.

>go northwest


 You can't, the gates bar your way, as insurmountable as death itself.
 All you can do now is turn around.

>open gates


 You throw yourself at the gates but you know even as you do that
 there will be no opening them. The metal tears at the skin of your
 hands and you send a chorus of clattering to the silent sky.  They are
 securely sealed and there is no forcing them.  You can't go back, you
 can't go through them.  It's time to turn around.

 You turn around slowly, as you know you inevitably must.  Celine is
 standing behind you, smiling.  The rising sun gleams upon her hair and
 in her eyes, her cheeks flushed with the first light of dawn.  The
 grass at her feet is a carpet of flowers and as you rush into her
 opening arms you find yourself clutching at nothing but a flurry of
 petals the colour of her lipstick.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">And Back Again</span>
 Marlborough Road looks exactly as it did when you left it, except it
 is greyish in the dawn.  It seems you have been wandering all night
 long.  Your house is dark and quiet behind its curtained windows, as
 if it has closed its eyes.  The world waits at your back, the front
 door lies ahead, waiting for you to open it.

>open door


 As you reach out to the door handle, a flash of colour catches your
 eye.  There is a flower petal stuck to your palm.  Shaken free by your
 movement, it drifts to the ground, gleaming briefly in the gloom. The
 door swings open and you step inside, into neither emptiness nor cold,
 and your hand warm as if someone holds it still.

 night?

 Identical doors, all closed but for the one that stands slightly ajar

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Celine's Room</span>
 The memories of past visits rise up to gnaw at you like wolves.  You
 see Celine, sitting on the bed, the colour washed out of her by her
 surroundings, her knees pulled up to her chin.  Jess is there beside
 her, back to the wall, feet dangling off the end of the bed.  You'd
 snuck in and you're kneeling on the floor, elbows folded on the
 coverlet.  You're probably pretty damn uncomfortable.  Spread out
 between you are brightly coloured cards. You're playing Once Upon A
 Time, a game for telling fairytales.  "Are you sure I used to like
 this?" Celine is asking.  "Yes," you say, "it's one of your
 favourites."  "You used to win all the time," Jess adds.  Celine
 laughs, uncertain.  "That doesn't seem very likely," she says.  "It'll
 come back," you say, half-reassuring, half-pleading.  Except it, of
 course, doesn't.  None of it does.

 A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to
 all the others on this corridor.  The carpet is a greyish-blue, only
 slightly stained.  There is a pine-coloured wardrobe and bedside
 table, a single bed and a chair.  There are signs of occupation - the
 black cardigan hanging on the back of the chair, books and a radio on
 the bedside table - but it's not the kind of room you can personalise.
 It is a transitory space.  Above the bed, the wall is splashed with a
 grid of cards and postcards, twenty or thirty of them maybe, pinned up
 there as bright as butterfly wings.

 You can see the Women's Corridor through the door to the east.

 On the narrow strip of a windowsill is a houseplant, another daub of
 colour.

>examine cards


 You open a couple of the cards at random.  Your own handwriting greets
 you.  All the cheerful, loving, desperate, tender, thoughtful, silly,
 downright banal words you sent, as if they could make a difference.  A
 card for every day that passed.  But not enough.  How could they be?

>examine plant


 This is Sylvia (after Sylvia Plath who also, we know, went mad), an
 Anthurium with dark red flowers, all Georgia o'Keefe.  It was a gift
 you nearly weren't permitted to give because of the toxic leaves.  "No
 committing suicide by eating Sylvia," you said, pretending to
 admonish.  And how Celine had laughed.  "I promise not to kill myself
 by eating an anthurium," she said with mock solemnitude, knowing at
 least ten better ways to do it.

>examine cardigan


 An ankle-length black wool cardigan, thick and soft, the sort of
 garment you could curl up inside and feel comforted.  You think it was
 a present from John.  The smell of the Warneford and cigarette smoke
 clings to it.

>examine radio


 You thought it might help her pass the difficult, interminable hours.
 It didn't.

>open wardrobe


 You can't see any such thing.

>take cardigan


 You don't want the cardigan.  When her parents came to take everything
 that was left of her, you told yourself that people were not their
 things.  You have to keep believing that because otherwise you'll have
 nothing.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a lyre
   your coat
   some pills

>get plant


 Taken.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Celine's Room</span>
 A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to
 all the others on this corridor.  The carpet is a greyish-blue, only
 slightly stained.  There is a pine-coloured wardrobe and bedside
 table, a single bed and a chair.  There are signs of occupation - the
 black cardigan hanging on the back of the chair, books and a radio on
 the bedside table - but it's not the kind of room you can personalise.
 It is a transitory space.  Above the bed, the wall is splashed with a
 grid of cards and postcards, twenty, thirty, forty of them maybe,
 pinned up there as bright as butterfly wings.

 You can see the Women's Corridor through the door to the east.

>examine books


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cards


 You open a couple of the cards at random.  Your own handwriting greets
 you.  All the cheerful, loving, desperate, tender, thoughtful, silly,
 downright banal words you sent, as if they could make a difference.  A
 card for every day that passed.  But not enough.  How could they be?

>eat plant


 That's plainly inedible.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Women's Corridor</span>
 The greyness unrolls before you like the tongue of a sick frog.  This
 sign above your head (this is not an exit) reminds you that it's women
 only past this point, but who is going to see you at this time of
 night?

 Identical doors, all closed but for the one that stands slightly ajar
 to the west, line the corridor.  Going north will return you to the
 Vaughan Thomas Corridor.

>go north


 An inmate, a sallow-complexioned, heavy-set man, pauses in the act of
 taking a book from the bookshelf.  "Cunt, you fucking cunt," he says,
 quite distinctly, as he walks away from you, the book stuffed under
 his arm.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Corridor</span>
 There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
 over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do
 nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a
 distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously
 has no smell, underscored by a desperate edge of nicotine.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 This is a primitive conservatory of sorts.  It is by far the most
 attractive room in the Warneford, which reflects well on neither the
 Warneford nor the room.  It has wicker chairs and, disconcertingly,
 there is white-sheeted hospital bed against one of the walls.  The
 square, unbeautiful windows overlook the grounds and currently admit a
 spill of moonlight the colour of old milk.

 There is a woman curled up on one of the wicker chairs, looking away
 from you, out over the shadowed grounds.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

>go west


 All the doors and windows are locked up tight, there's no way out.

>go east


 A man shuffles past you down the grey corridor.  He is tall and
 overweight, and he looks wrong.  It is something in the way the weight
 is distributed, distending his hair-speckled belly so that it hangs
 below his T-shirt, swaying slightly as if something is actually inside
 it.  An alien baby perhaps.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine woman


 She seems to be at the unforgiving end of the spectrum of middle-age,
 her face worn and withered by the cold glare of the moon.  Shadows
 emphasise the gauntness of her cheeks and define in cruel charcoal the
 lines that radiate from her eyes.  Her coarse, ash blonde hair falls
 straight to her waist and hangs like dead weight.  Garlands of
 withered flowers give her the air of an aging hippie.  Under your
 scrutiny, she turns her head in your direction and smiles and you feel
 a fleeting trace of warmth.

>talk to woman


 Hesitantly you offer a polite greeting and are relieved when the woman
 turns away from the window and smiles at you in return.  If she is an
 inmate she is, at least, not antisocially mad.  "Hello," she says, "I
 can see that you're a visitor."  Her voice is as deep and rich as
 freshly turned earth.  You think of honey-drunk bees and heavy, golden
 days.  "So am I," she says.  "At least, I think I am.  It's sometimes
 so hard to tell."

>again


 She turns away from you again towards the windows.  "I wish I could
 make something flourish here," she says.  "I can sometimes make things
 grow but it's not the same."  She strokes a hand absently through the
 brittle strands of her hair. "I miss the colours of things.   It all
 fades so quickly.  What's your favourite colour," she asks, suddenly,
 with a glance in your direction.  You tell her and she smiles again.
 "Of course it is," she says.  "Mine is green."  Same as Celine.

>again


 She is plucking at her skirt.  As the fabric moves you realise it
 isn't grey, as you first thought, but a pale green, all but washed
 out.  "I'm truly sorry about your friend," she says.  And there must
 be a look on your face that makes her add: "That is why you're here,
 isn't it?"  Her voice is gentle and her eyes are pale and sad in the
 moonlight.  "You know you shouldn't have come.  She can't leave with
 you."  She is silent a moment.  When she continues speaking the
 reassurance in her voice is as warm as sunlight against your skin.
 "Of course you'll miss her.  It will never be easy but it will be
 easier than this.  And one day you'll stop and be surprised at just
 how easy it is.  Then I'm afraid you'll feel guilty but that, too,
 will pass.  As it should."

>again


 The woman smiles reassuringly at you and her regard travels across
 your skin, leaving a glissando of fading warmth in its wake.  Then she
 turns away and casts her gaze out of the window again, moonlight
 etching the lines on her face.

 One of Celine's few friends (one to whom you have lost endless games
 of Scrabble) passes you with a nod and a greeting.  "I'm very much
 looking forward to the coping with psychosis workshop tomorrow," he
 comments, with a look so wry and self-knowing you cannot help but
 laugh.  He waves and vanishes into his room.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Hall</span>
 This is the large, bow-windowed room you could see from outside.  Dull
 light washes in from the corridor behind you and flickers from beneath
 the door to the television room.  Square tables are neatly arranged
 and the far wall boasts a display of artwork.  Upon the air hangs the
 cloying scent of old, institutional dinners.

 The Doctor's Office lies to the north, the Vaughan Thomas corridor to
 the south.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Doctor's Office</span>
 This is a typical Doctor's office.  It has a clinical air, but no more
 than you would expect.  It is really very neat in here.  The walls are
 hung with what look to be modern art prints, all in identical frames,
 imprisoned behind glass.

 The Doctor is sitting behind the desk, his elbows resting atop it and
 his chin upon the platform provided by his interlocked fingers.

 The door to the south leads back to the dining hall.

>talk to doctor


 "Yes?" The Doctor's voice is not quite impatient, but the clipped
 quality of it suggests it very soon will be.  "You know I cannot
 accede to your ..." He stops abruptly, as if searching for a word, and
 settles finally on "...request".  I suggest you let me send you home,
 where you belong."
>no


 At your refusal, the Doctor frowns.

>give plant to doctor


 Hades doesn't seem interested.

>show pills to doctor


 Hades is unimpressed.

>talk to doctor


 Before you can speak again, the Doctor forestalls you.  "I'm afraid
 you will not change my mind with tragic looks or eloquent words.  I
 have seen and heard them all a hundred throusand million times
 before."  You wonder, briefly, whether you are supposed to challenge
 him to a game of chess or, possibly riddles.  "I cannot be tricked,"
 he says, as if in answer.  "Nor changed.  It is not my nature."

>talk to doctor


 "Your insistence is as wearisome as it is predictable," comments the
 Doctor.

>examine prints


 You look at each of the paintings in turn.  They are placed a precise
 intervals along the grey wall.  Each print has the name of the piece
 and the artist printed along the bottom.  First, there is a Rothko,
 Blue, Green, and Brown.  Then IKB 73.  And finally Composition in Red,
 Blue, and Yellow.

 A desk purchased for utility rather than aesthetics.  Currently it

 A young-ish, not entirely unpretty woman, who steals from the other
 inmates and has no visitors, is staring blankly out of a window at the
 shadow-sloshed world outside.  She turns, smiles hopefully and shyly
 at you and then flees.  You try to feel more kindness towards her but
 she pilfered Celine's favourite perfume.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

>play lyre


 As you lift the lyre, a strange expression crosses the woman's face.
 "Please don't do that, dear," she says.

>play lyre


 A torrent of cherry blossom petals pours from between your fingers as
 they move across the strings but as even as they spiral to the floor
 they begin to wither and then they turn to ice and then they shatter
 where they fall, and each breaking pricks your skin like a wasp sting.
 And the lyre weeps and so does the woman, and the air all around you
 grows cold and heavy and blots out everything until there is only
 silence and the silver traces of disappearing tears and melting ice.
 Your hands are empty; the lyre is gone.  And the woman is looking at
 you as if she doesn't like you much.  "My husband.." she says "He
 doesn't like ... he won't ... you'd better go.  She's waiting for you
 in the gardens, just through here. I'll open the door for you." She
 crosses the room and fiddles with the lock.  "Remember the rules," she
 says, when she is finished.  "Don't look back."  And before you can
 say any thing else, she hurries from the room.

 Now you notice a set of doors at the back of the room have been flung
 wide open, drawing you like a beckoning finger, west, towards the
 shadow-smothered gardens.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford Gardens</span>
 Somebody tried.  Here there are the elements of a garden.  Grass,
 although it is mainly mud.  Banks of soil where perhaps flowers might
 grow.  Squatting shrubs, hunched in upon themselves.  And in
 silhouette the anorexic shapes of trees, stripped before the oncoming
 winter.  Moonlight forms puddles here and there.

 The Sun room waits to the east.

 Celine is sitting on a stone bench.

>give plant to celine


 Celine doesn't seem interested.

>talk to celine


 Celine smiles to see you, convincing gladness, desperate eyes.  You
 exchange the usual greetings, the usual enquiries, and, as ever, she
 thanks you for coming to see her, as if it is a kind and wonderful
 thing and not a terrible strain for both of you.  You tell her silly
 stories of the colour of the October leaves and how much you're
 looking forward to the blossom trees.  She listens, and laughs, and
 pretends.

>again


 Celine is not feeling so good and will only tell you so if you press
 her.  She has - quite literally - forgotten the way home, along with
 everything she learned on her art history course last term.  She has
 forgotten the tombstone cake you made for Jess's birthday.  She has
 forgotten Rick's parents are dead.  She has forgotten the entirety of
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It'll come back, you tell her, don't worry,
 and anyway we can watch it all over again - think how much fun that'll
 be.  She listens, and laughs, and pretends.

>again


 Celine tells you her secrets, the ones she hasn't forgotten, the ones
 you wish she could forget, the ones she has forgotten you already
 know.  You try to make it okay with your words.  And Celine listens,
 and laughs, and pretends.

 Suddenly you remember.  It's time to go home.  "Will you follow me?"
 you ask, and Celine nods.  She seems only a little afraid.

 As you enter the sunroom from the gardens, your own footsteps sound on

 promised she would.

 You strain to hear even the slightest hint of movement but there is
 nothing, nothing at all.  Perhaps you have been tricked.  Yes, that
 seems very likely.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go east


 You look around for the nurse but then notice that the door seems to
 be standing very slightly ajar.  You seize the opportunity and slip
 through
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Exterior</span>
 Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
 which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
 also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.

 The only thing that follows you now, it seems, is silence.

 The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
 There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
 to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Path</span>
 The path sidles away down the side of the main building, taking you
 away from facades.  Here, there are no country house lawns, no
 sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass,
 borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings
 that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of
 beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to
 Cotswold House and Wintle Ward.

 Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the
 east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford exit</span>
 Here on the Warneford lawn again you can see a streak of lightness at
 the eastern edge of the sky.  Behind you, a smear of gold and grey, is
 the Warneford.  Before you, to the northwest, the wrought iron gates,
 as tall as thistles to a child, inevitably sealed.

>go east


 You can't go that way.

>go northwest


 You can't, the gates bar your way, as insurmountable as death itself.
 All you can do now is turn around.

>turn around


 You turn around slowly, as you know you inevitably must.  Celine is
 standing behind you, smiling.  The rising sun gleams upon her hair and
 in her eyes, her cheeks flushed with the first light of dawn.  The
 grass at her feet is a carpet of flowers and as you rush into her
 opening arms you find yourself clutching at nothing but a flurry of
 petals the colour of her lipstick.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">And Back Again</span>
 Marlborough Road looks exactly as it did when you left it, except it
 is greyish in the dawn.  It seems you have been wandering all night
 long.  Your house is dark and quiet behind its curtained windows, as
 if it has closed its eyes.  The world waits at your back, the front
 door lies ahead, waiting for you to open it.

>open door


 As you reach out to the door handle, a flash of colour catches your
 eye.  There is a flower petal stuck to your palm.  Shaken free by your
 movement, it drifts to the ground, gleaming briefly in the gloom. The
 door swings open and you step inside, into neither emptiness nor cold,
 and your hand warm as if someone holds it still.

 Two nurses are standing by the pay phone, talking animatedly about

 The memories of past visits rise up to gnaw at you like wolves.  You
 see Celine, sitting on the bed, the colour washed out of her by her
 surroundings, her knees pulled up to her chin.  Jess is there beside
 her, back to the wall, feet dangling off the end of the bed.  You'd
 snuck in and you're kneeling on the floor, elbows folded on the
 coverlet.  You're probably pretty damn uncomfortable.  Spread out
 between you are brightly coloured cards. You're playing Once Upon A
 Time, a game for telling fairytales.  "Are you sure I used to like
 this?" Celine is asking.  "Yes," you say, "it's one of your
 favourites."  "You used to win all the time," Jess adds.  Celine
 laughs, uncertain.  "That doesn't seem very likely," she says.  "It'll
 come back," you say, half-reassuring, half-pleading.  Except it, of
 course, doesn't.  None of it does.

 A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to
 all the others on this corridor.  The carpet is a greyish-blue, only
 slightly stained.  There is a pine-coloured wardrobe and bedside
 table, a single bed and a chair.  There are signs of occupation - the
 black cardigan hanging on the back of the chair, books and a radio on
 the bedside table - but it's not the kind of room you can personalise.
 It is a transitory space.  Above the bed, the wall is splashed with a
 grid of cards and postcards, twenty or thirty of them maybe, pinned up
 there as bright as butterfly wings.

 You can see the Women's Corridor through the door to the east.

 On the narrow strip of a windowsill is a houseplant, another daub of
 colour.

 square, unbeautiful windows overlook the grounds and currently admit a
 spill of moonlight the colour of old milk.

 There is a woman curled up on one of the wicker chairs, looking away
 from you, out over the shadowed grounds.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

>talk to woman


 Hesitantly you offer a polite greeting and are relieved when the woman
 turns away from the window and smiles at you in return.  If she is an
 inmate she is, at least, not antisocially mad.  "Hello," she says, "I
 can see that you're a visitor."  Her voice is as deep and rich as
 freshly turned earth.  You think of honey-drunk bees and heavy, golden
 days.  "So am I," she says.  "At least, I think I am.  It's sometimes
 so hard to tell."

>give pills to woman


 Persephone doesn't seem interested.

>give plant to woman


 The woman seems to light up as you offer her Celine's plant. For a
 brief moment, a cloud engulfs the moon and you think she might be, or
 once have been, quite beautiful. But then the moon bursts free and
 she's just an bare-foot oldish woman draped in dead flowers, clutching
 a pot plant like it's a priceless thing.  "She's lovely," she says,
 running a reverent finger over one of the leaves.  "I'll love her, I
 promise."  There is a brief, awkward pause.  "Oh."  The woman fixes
 you with her moon-blanched eyes.  "You want something in return, don't
 you?  Of course you do.  You want something foolish and impossible.
 You expect me to speak to my husband, don't you?
>no


 The woman smiles, but it is tinged with melancholy.  "It's sweet that
 you're willing to give me something for nothing but that's not the way
 it works.  Don't worry, I know a way to make it fair.  I'm going to do
 the best thing anyone could possibly do for you right now.  You're not
 going to agree with me but you will, in time.  Before you can protest,
 the woman rises - she is surprisingly tall and graceful - and takes
 Sylvia from your hands.  "Thank you," she says.  "I don't expect you
 to thank me for what I'm about to give you but it's going to be all
 right, my dear, I promise."  She leans in and kisses your lips.  A
 fleeting taste of honey and then she, and the Warneford, and
 everything else, fade away.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Home Again</span>
 You are standing on the pavement outside your house.  The street looks
 exactly as it always looks, except evening has crept fully across the
 sky during your wanderings and the nascent night is definitely cold.
 You are conscious, for a second or two, of a vague nagging feeling, as
 if you have left something behind, but it passes swiftly.  Hinksey
 Park still lies, like a shadow, to the northwest and the rest of the
 world awaits in every other direction.  The door to your house stands
 before you, waiting for you to open it.

>open door


 The brass handle is as cold as the night air beneath your hand but,
 for once, the door does not stick. It swings open before you in
 invitation, spilling a treasury's worth of light over the front path.
 Warm air rushes out to greet you and, from within, you hear the
 strains of speech and laughter rising like a phoenix

>give plant to persephone


 The woman seems to light up as you offer her Celine's plant. For a
 brief moment, a cloud engulfs the moon and you think she might be, or
 once have been, quite beautiful. But then the moon bursts free and
 she's just an bare-foot oldish woman draped in dead flowers, clutching
 a pot plant like it's a priceless thing.  "She's lovely," she says,
 running a reverent finger over one of the leaves.  "I'll love her, I
 promise."  There is a brief, awkward pause.  "Oh."  The woman fixes
 you with her moon-blanched eyes.  "You want something in return, don't
 you?  Of course you do.  You want something foolish and impossible.
 You expect me to speak to my husband, don't you?
>yes


 The woman holds out her hand to you and, after a moment's hesitation
 you take it.  It is a strong, weathered, rather unladylike hand.  With
 Celine's plant still cradled in her other arm she leads you on her
 soundless feet through the grey corridors of the Warneford until you
 come to the Doctor's office.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Doctor's Office</span>
 As soon as you enter his office, the Doctor's attention flies to the
 woman with you.  "Is there something I can do for you?" he asks.

 The woman meets his ardent gaze with disinterest.  "There's something
 you can do for my friend here," she says.  "And don't give me the
 usual rubbish about the rules, I know just how flexible your rules can
 be."

 "That was an isolated incident," he replies, flushing. He seems to
 have forgotten you're standing there, because he blurts out his next
 words with a terrible, naked earnestness: "I know I have wronged you
 but I cannot ... that is ... I need ... " His hand moves compulsively
 to his heart as if he means to pluck it out and offer it to her, but
 she glares him back to silence.  Finally, he says, with something of
 his customary coldness: "I would do anything to assure your comfort
 while you're here with me."

 She thrusts the plant into his face.  "Then I want this," she says.

 "I offer you my kingdom and all you want is a weed?"

  She shrugs.  "You'll never understand."

 "Very well," says the Doctor, finally.  "Since you ask it of me."  He
 turns on you, contempt scored across his face. "You'll find Celine in
 the gardens beyond the Sun Room.  Take her with you, as you wish, but
 don't look back or she's mine forever."  And that seems to be the
 mattered settled.

 The woman, still cradling the houseplant drifts out.  She does not
 look at you.

>go west


 You can't go that way.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Hall</span>
 This is the large, bow-windowed room you could see from outside.  Dull
 light washes in from the corridor behind you and flickers from beneath
 the door to the television room.  Square tables are neatly arranged
 and the far wall boasts a display of artwork.  Upon the air hangs the
 cloying scent of old, institutional dinners.

 The Doctor's Office lies to the north, the Vaughan Thomas corridor to
 the south.

>go south


 A young-ish, not entirely unpretty woman, who steals from the other
 inmates and has no visitors, is staring blankly out of a window at the
 shadow-sloshed world outside.  She turns, smiles hopefully and shyly
 at you and then flees.  You try to feel more kindness towards her but
 she pilfered Celine's favourite perfume.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Corridor</span>
 There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
 over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do
 nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a
 distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously
 has no smell, underscored by a desperate edge of nicotine.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 This is a primitive conservatory of sorts.  It is by far the most
 attractive room in the Warneford, which reflects well on neither the
 Warneford nor the room.  It has wicker chairs and, disconcertingly,
 there is white-sheeted hospital bed against one of the walls.  The
 square, unbeautiful windows overlook the grounds and currently admit a
 spill of moonlight the colour of old milk.

 Now you notice a set of doors at the back of the room have been flung
 wide open, drawing you like a beckoning finger, west, towards the
 shadow-smothered gardens.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford Gardens</span>
 Somebody tried.  Here there are the elements of a garden.  Grass,
 although it is mainly mud.  Banks of soil where perhaps flowers might
 grow.  Squatting shrubs, hunched in upon themselves.  And in
 silhouette the anorexic shapes of trees, stripped before the oncoming
 winter.  Moonlight forms puddles here and there.

 The Sun room waits to the east.

 Celine is sitting on a stone bench.

>talk to celine


 Celine smiles to see you, convincing gladness, desperate eyes.  You
 exchange the usual greetings, the usual enquiries, and, as ever, she
 thanks you for coming to see her, as if it is a kind and wonderful
 thing and not a terrible strain for both of you.  You tell her silly
 stories of the colour of the October leaves and how much you're
 looking forward to the blossom trees.  She listens, and laughs, and
 pretends.

>play lyre


>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a lyre
   your coat
   some pills

>talk to celine


 Celine is not feeling so good and will only tell you so if you press
 her.  She has - quite literally - forgotten the way home, along with
 everything she learned on her art history course last term.  She has
 forgotten the tombstone cake you made for Jess's birthday.  She has
 forgotten Rick's parents are dead.  She has forgotten the entirety of
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It'll come back, you tell her, don't worry,
 and anyway we can watch it all over again - think how much fun that'll
 be.  She listens, and laughs, and pretends.

>again


 Celine tells you her secrets, the ones she hasn't forgotten, the ones
 you wish she could forget, the ones she has forgotten you already
 know.  You try to make it okay with your words.  And Celine listens,
 and laughs, and pretends.

>again


 Suddenly you remember.  It's time to go home.  "Will you follow me?"
 you ask, and Celine nods.  She seems only a little afraid.

 As you enter the sunroom from the gardens, your own footsteps sound on
 the floor but you hear no others.  Perhaps Celine has not followed as
 promised she would.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

 You strain to hear even the slightest hint of movement but there is
 nothing, nothing at all.  Perhaps you have been tricked.  Yes, that
 seems very likely.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go east


 You look around for the nurse but then notice that the door seems to
 be standing very slightly ajar.  You seize the opportunity and slip
 through
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Exterior</span>
 Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
 which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
 also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.

 The only thing that follows you now, it seems, is silence.

 The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
 There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
 to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Path</span>
 The path sidles away down the side of the main building, taking you
 away from facades.  Here, there are no country house lawns, no
 sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass,
 borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings
 that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of
 beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to
 Cotswold House and Wintle Ward.

 Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the
 east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford exit</span>
 Here on the Warneford lawn again you can see a streak of lightness at
 the eastern edge of the sky.  Behind you, a smear of gold and grey, is
 the Warneford.  Before you, to the northwest, the wrought iron gates,
 as tall as thistles to a child, inevitably sealed.

>go northwest


 You can't, the gates bar your way, as insurmountable as death itself.
 All you can do now is turn around.

>play lyre


>eat pills


 While imitation may be thought to be the sincerest form of flattery,
 you should probably not start randomly taking someone else's
 medication.  It didn't do much good for Celine, after all.

>examine gate


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine gates


 They look exactly the same as they did before, but they're sealed
 shut, barred and implaccable.

>turn around


 You turn around slowly, as you know you inevitably must.  Celine is
 standing behind you, smiling.  The rising sun gleams upon her hair and
 in her eyes, her cheeks flushed with the first light of dawn.  The
 grass at her feet is a carpet of flowers and as you rush into her
 opening arms you find yourself clutching at nothing but a flurry of
 petals the colour of her lipstick.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">And Back Again</span>
 Marlborough Road looks exactly as it did when you left it, except it
 is greyish in the dawn.  It seems you have been wandering all night
 long.  Your house is dark and quiet behind its curtained windows, as
 if it has closed its eyes.  The world waits at your back, the front
 door lies ahead, waiting for you to open it.

>open door


 As you reach out to the door handle, a flash of colour catches your
 eye.  There is a flower petal stuck to your palm.  Shaken free by your
 movement, it drifts to the ground, gleaming briefly in the gloom. The
 door swings open and you step inside, into neither emptiness nor cold,
 and your hand warm as if someone holds it still.

 Vaughan Thomas Corridor.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Celine's Room</span>
 The memories of past visits rise up to gnaw at you like wolves.  You
 see Celine, sitting on the bed, the colour washed out of her by her
 surroundings, her knees pulled up to her chin.  Jess is there beside
 her, back to the wall, feet dangling off the end of the bed.  You'd
 snuck in and you're kneeling on the floor, elbows folded on the
 coverlet.  You're probably pretty damn uncomfortable.  Spread out
 between you are brightly coloured cards. You're playing Once Upon A
 Time, a game for telling fairytales.  "Are you sure I used to like
 this?" Celine is asking.  "Yes," you say, "it's one of your
 favourites."  "You used to win all the time," Jess adds.  Celine
 laughs, uncertain.  "That doesn't seem very likely," she says.  "It'll
 come back," you say, half-reassuring, half-pleading.  Except it, of
 course, doesn't.  None of it does.

 A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to
 all the others on this corridor.  The carpet is a greyish-blue, only
 slightly stained.  There is a pine-coloured wardrobe and bedside
 table, a single bed and a chair.  There are signs of occupation - the
 black cardigan hanging on the back of the chair, books and a radio on
 the bedside table - but it's not the kind of room you can personalise.
 It is a transitory space.  Above the bed, the wall is splashed with a
 grid of cards and postcards, twenty or thirty of them maybe, pinned up
 there as bright as butterfly wings.

 You can see the Women's Corridor through the door to the east.

 On the narrow strip of a windowsill is a houseplant, another daub of
 colour.

 Two nurses are standing by the pay phone, talking animatedly about

 as if this was some kind of ordinary place.  They fall silent as you
 approach and then disappear into an office.

 The river is a snake of moving darkness.  There is a railway line
 running parallel on the other side and open fields after that.  There
 is some kind of flat-bottomed boat by the bank nearest to you, and a
 tall man, in a long coat, is standing in the bow of the boat.

 Hinksey Park is behind you to the east.

 As you step towards the boat the Ferryman intercepts you again.
 "Coming back is harder than going," he says. "Are you sure?"
>yes


 You step into the boat.  There is a space for a single passenger but
 it is not  exactly luxurious.  You barely have time to sit down upon
 the damp wooden boards before the ferryman takes his first stroke,
 propelling the boat forward at an unlikely speed that causes the
 moving air to catch at you like icy hands.  You  remember that someone
 told you once that a punt can travel at 30 miles an hour in
 favourable conditions ... but this one slips across the moonslick
 water as effortlessly as if it is glass.  At any rate, you are glad
 that the man has sufficient  taste to punt from the Oxford end.  You
 tilt your head back.  You are going so fast that the stars are smeared
 across the sky.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Iron Gates</span>
 Something has happened.  You have lost track of time, or track of
 yourself, or something.  You were looking at the sky, feeling stars
 upon your skin, no, you were in a boat, cold seeping through you, wind
 tangling in your hair.  But there is no trace of the punt here, or the
 man, or even a river.  How did you get here?  Where are you?  There is
 a set of open wrought iron gates before you, as intricate as briars.
 Beyond them, hazy in the darkness to the southeast, a round lawn,
 dotted with trees.  It all feels familiar somehow.

 Guarding the gate is biggest dog you have ever seen, a haunch of
 bloody meat and a vast water bowl at its feet.

>give pills to dog


 Cerberus doesn't seem interested.

>put pills in bowl


 You stand around, being still and looking boring, until the dog's
 attention is distracted.  Seizing  your opportunity, you flick some of
 the diazapam into the water bowl where it quickly dissolves.  Some
 minutes pass before the dog drinks, but eventually it lowers one of
 its heads to the bowl and slurps up most of the contents.  You watch
 it from a safe distance; its movements grow sluggish and its head
 droops.  Finally it keels onto its side and lies there, like a felled
 oak tree, not quite asleep but too lethargic to care much about
 anything much

 You muster up your courage and sidle past the subdued monster, holding

 You could be visiting a stately home, or an Oxford college, or a

 As you cross the lawn, your footsteps lost among the many you have

 Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
 which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
 also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.

 The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
 There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
 to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

>push button


 You depress the button and listen to the silence while you wait.  You
 do not trust the doorbell.  It demands your faith yet gives you no
 miracles.  It doesn't even buzz to let you know it's actually
 functional.  Finally, just when you have given up all hope in the
 doorbell, there is a crackling from behind the grill and a distorted
 voice asks what you want.

>talk to grill


 You mumble your name into the grill, and explain you have come to get
 Celine.  A warped sigh gusts out of the grill with such force you are
 surprised it doesn't ruffle your hair.  Then crackling dies away and
 the grill speaks to you no further.  You assume that that means
 someone is coming to open the door but for all you know they could be
 activating the lever that drops you into the alligator pit.

 You are starting to wonder if perhaps they've forgotten you're there,
 or if answering the doorbell is a mere hobby, when there comes the
 sound of muted rattling and banging from behind the door as someone on
 the other side begins the ceremony required to open it.  It is finally
 eased open, just enough for you to squeeze through, by a Nurse,
 glowering at the effort required to perform the most basic tenets of
 her job.

>go west


 As you edge past the Nurse, she put out a log-like arm to momentarily
 stop you entering.  "You'll need to see the Doctor first," she says,
 gruffly. "You can't take a patient away without the doctor's
 permission."  You nod your understanding, although your mind is full
 of Escape from Alcatraz visions, search lights flashing, sirens
 screaming and helicopters whirling overhead as you and Celine run,
 hand in hand, giggling into a different coloured future.

 hung with what look to be modern art prints, all in identical frames,
 imprisoned behind glass.

 The Doctor is sitting behind the desk, his elbows resting atop it and
 his chin upon the platform provided by his interlocked fingers.

 The door to the south leads back to the dining hall.

>play lyre


 Time seems to unravel around you like the fraying threads of a
 tapestry as you lift the lyre into your arms.  The Doctor is on his on
 his feet, his face pale with fury and his eyes ablaze, but it's too
 late to stop you.  Music fills the air like cherry blossom, sweetly
 drifting, falling like fleeting kisses upon the senses and fading as
 swiftly as a summer evening.   For a moment, the Doctor is tranfixed,
 his face naked in pain and sorrow, and then his cold hands are
 wrenching the lyre from your grasp.  The notes shatter into rainbows
 of refracted light and then they're gone.  There is a vicious crack,
 like a bone breaking, and the Doctor flings the pieces of the lyre to
 the floor.  In seconds nothing remains of the lyre but a sprinkling of
 dust the colour of old blood.  "Take her then," he cries, "take her
 and may damnation have you both.  You'll find Celine in the gardens
 beyond the Sun Room.  Take her with you, as you wish, but remember:
 don't turn around, or she's mine forever.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Hall</span>
 This is the large, bow-windowed room you could see from outside.  Dull
 light washes in from the corridor behind you and flickers from beneath
 the door to the television room.  Square tables are neatly arranged
 and the far wall boasts a display of artwork.  Upon the air hangs the
 cloying scent of old, institutional dinners.

 The Doctor's Office lies to the north, the Vaughan Thomas corridor to
 the south.

>go south


 The silence of the hospital surrounds you like an itchy blanket.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Corridor</span>
 There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
 over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do
 nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a
 distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously
 has no smell, underscored by a desperate edge of nicotine.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 This is a primitive conservatory of sorts.  It is by far the most
 attractive room in the Warneford, which reflects well on neither the
 Warneford nor the room.  It has wicker chairs and, disconcertingly,
 there is white-sheeted hospital bed against one of the walls.  The
 square, unbeautiful windows overlook the grounds and currently admit a
 spill of moonlight the colour of old milk.

 Now you notice a set of doors at the back of the room have been flung
 wide open, drawing you like a beckoning finger, west, towards the
 shadow-smothered gardens.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford Gardens</span>
 Somebody tried.  Here there are the elements of a garden.  Grass,
 although it is mainly mud.  Banks of soil where perhaps flowers might
 grow.  Squatting shrubs, hunched in upon themselves.  And in
 silhouette the anorexic shapes of trees, stripped before the oncoming
 winter.  Moonlight forms puddles here and there.

 The Sun room waits to the east.

 Celine is sitting on a stone bench.

>talk to celine


 Celine smiles to see you, convincing gladness, desperate eyes.  You
 exchange the usual greetings, the usual enquiries, and, as ever, she
 thanks you for coming to see her, as if it is a kind and wonderful
 thing and not a terrible strain for both of you.  You tell her silly
 stories of the colour of the October leaves and how much you're
 looking forward to the blossom trees.  She listens, and laughs, and
 pretends.

>again


 Celine is not feeling so good and will only tell you so if you press
 her.  She has - quite literally - forgotten the way home, along with
 everything she learned on her art history course last term.  She has
 forgotten the tombstone cake you made for Jess's birthday.  She has
 forgotten Rick's parents are dead.  She has forgotten the entirety of
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It'll come back, you tell her, don't worry,
 and anyway we can watch it all over again - think how much fun that'll
 be.  She listens, and laughs, and pretends.

>again


 Celine tells you her secrets, the ones she hasn't forgotten, the ones
 you wish she could forget, the ones she has forgotten you already
 know.  You try to make it okay with your words.  And Celine listens,
 and laughs, and pretends.

>again


 Suddenly you remember.  It's time to go home.  "Will you follow me?"
 you ask, and Celine nods.  She seems only a little afraid.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>

 there is white-sheeted hospital bed against one of the walls.  The
 square, unbeautiful windows overlook the grounds and currently admit a
 spill of moonlight the colour of old milk.

 As you enter the sunroom from the gardens, your own footsteps sound on
 the floor but you hear no others.  Perhaps Celine has not followed as
 promised she would.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

 distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously

 You strain to hear even the slightest hint of movement but there is
 nothing, nothing at all.  Perhaps you have been tricked.  Yes, that
 seems very likely.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go east


 You look around for the nurse but then notice that the door seems to
 be standing very slightly ajar.  You seize the opportunity and slip
 through
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Exterior</span>
 Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
 which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
 also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.

 The only thing that follows you now, it seems, is silence.

 The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
 There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
 to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Path</span>
 The path sidles away down the side of the main building, taking you
 away from facades.  Here, there are no country house lawns, no
 sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass,
 borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings
 that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of
 beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to
 Cotswold House and Wintle Ward.

 Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the
 east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford exit</span>
 Here on the Warneford lawn again you can see a streak of lightness at
 the eastern edge of the sky.  Behind you, a smear of gold and grey, is
 the Warneford.  Before you, to the northwest, the wrought iron gates,
 as tall as thistles to a child, inevitably sealed.

>go northwest


 You can't, the gates bar your way, as insurmountable as death itself.
 All you can do now is turn around.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is surprisingly spacious for a rented house.  It has
 faux-granite counter tops and matching tiling, and fitted cupboards in
 shades of coffee and cream.  It would be a pleasure to cook in such a
 kitchen.

 Scattered across the  worksurface nearest the hob is an array of
 cooking utensils, onion skins and pepper cores, including the wooden
 knifeblock you bought for a tenner in Boswells during a sale.

 Vera and Tilda (plants, not people, and therefore bearable) are on the
 little round kitchen table.

 Natalie is by the hob, stirring a pan of pasta.

 The back door leads into the back garden to the north, and, if you're
 feeling particularly brave (or masochistic), the living room is to the
 west.

>examine knifeblock


 Currently it contains only one knife.

 You are carrying:
   a 50p coin
   your coat
   some pills

 A cleaver-style knife, still relatively sharp despite your ineptitude
 with a sharpening stone.

 You draw the knife from the knife block, earning yourself a worried
 look from Natalie.

>go west


 You had better not wander around the house carrying a cleaver.  For a
 start, you could fall over and accidentally stab yourself, which would
 be embarrassing.  But also it could make the people in the living room
 - who are technically your guests -  feel uncomfortable

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">living room</span>
 The extensive living / dining area was one of the features that drew
 you all to this house when you were looking for places to rent.  That
 and - despite the fact none of you have been able to bring yourself to
 do anything as prosaic as cleaning for days - the fact it's not an
 abject shit hole like most of places on offer when you were doing the
 rounds.

 Currently, it's all cluttered with people. Your housemate John is
 sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of the coffee table,
 frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch, sits opposite and
 appears much more laid-back about the whole business.  Rick is slumped
 on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow; Elsie is sitting next to
 him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is huddled in a cloak on the
 other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking almost as uncomfortable as you
 feel.  As for Laurie (fucking Laurie), she's leaning against the
 fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite suffering like she's
 living her own little Victorian melodrama

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">downstairs hall</span>
 Winter light lies in anaemic strips upon the floor from where it has
 fallen through the glass panels in the front door.  There is an awful

 babble now; too many over-lapping conversations create an alien,
 baboonish gibberish.

 Or you could always just retreat upstairs.

 The upstairs landing is dimly illuminated from the light in the empty

 Your room is a complete mess.  The bed is unmade.  The bookshelves
 that once lined the walls are a ruin of fallen books and splintered
 wood.  There are piles of things that shouldn't be piled everywhere.
 All the things you thought you cared about feel like mockery.

 A mysterious lyre, slightly battered from possibly having fallen from
 your bookshelves, lies among the wreckage.

 Behind you, to the east, is the upstairs landing

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">back garden</span>
 The back garden is really little more than a lawn-gone-wild and a
 weedy patio.  The sky is a cool grey curtain backlit by the weak sun.
 The chill air bites at your skin.

 You can get back into the house to the south.

>examine lawn


 The blades are tipped by an unhealthy yellow and sway indolently in
 the slight breeze.  As you watch, a violent ripple of motion seizes
 the stalks and whips them back and forth.  At first you think it must
 be the wind but then you see a blur of a new green in the grass and a
 snake slithers onto the patio.

>examine snake


 You would not have thought there were such snakes in England.  It is a
 strong, sinuous creature, dappled in black diamonds like a snake on a
 Snakes And Ladders board.  It has hateful yellow eyes, as blank as
 pieces of glass.  You are not by nature inclined towards
 anthropomorphisation but there is something both directed and
 malignant in its gaze.

>play lyre


 A sudden surety takes possession of your fingers and they dance
 seemingly of their accord across the lyre strings as if they find them
 familiar.  Music floats across the still evening air, honey-sweet and
 sad.  You play to the neglected grass and the uncharted sky, to the
 inconstant breeze and the fading light.  Even the snake lifts its
 head, and sways entranced.

>again


 You are reluctant to touch the lyre again so soon, in case you dispel
 your own song by remembered incompetence.

>kill snake


 While the snake still seems enraptured by the music, you grip the
 kitchen knife in sweat-slippery hands and lunge.  You decapitate the
 snake in one clean blow - there's a confusion of sensory information,
 a gush of blood, a hiss of pain, the fleshly thump of the snake's
 ruined body hitting the pattio and then ... nothing.  No blood, no
 snake, nothing.  Just the fragrance of the olive trees and a sudden
 brightness in your eyes as if you stand beneath a different sun.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marlborough road</span>
 This is just an ordinary street, lined by Victorian terraces, with
 their slightly over-ambitious moulding and bow windows.  In the
 distance you can hear the muted roar of traffic streaming down the
 Abingdon Road.  It is not quite suburbia but it's a pocket of Oxford
 unreached by spires, dreaming or otherwise.   The fading light is
 nonetheless tinged by gold.  The sky is a swirl of grey and pink, like
 the interior of a shell.  There is a biting promise of winter in the
 air.

 Hinksey Park is to the northwest, your house to the east, and other
 places lie elsewhere.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hinksey Park Gate</span>
 The gate to Hinksey Park is not far from your house but by the time
 you arrive the sky is already suffused by a greyness that has blotted
 out the potential glories of an Oxford sunset.  Night is snapping at
 your heels.  The park  is the old fashioned kind, a basic arrangement
 of paths and benches, grass and trees. The nearest bench is over-hung
 by a willow tree, which has wept a burthen of withered foliage onto
 the seat.  There is a lake, girdled by a path and an open air swimming
 pool.

 A river, which must be a tributary of the Thames, flows to the west.
 Malborough Road lies to the southeast.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">river</span>
 The river is a snake of moving darkness.  There is a railway line
 running parallel on the other side and open fields after that.  There
 is some kind of flat-bottomed boat by the bank nearest to you, and a
 tall man, in a long coat, is standing in the bow of the boat.

 Hinksey Park is behind you to the east.

>give coin to man


 You toss the coin to ferryman.  It turns over and over in the air,
 flashing silver, and then he reaches out a gloved hand and engulfs it
 in darkness.  He carries it to his mouth and bites it.  "That's not
 silver," he says. But then he shrugs.  "It'll do.  In you get."

>enter boat


 As you step towards the boat the Ferryman intercepts you again.
 "Coming back is harder than going," he says. "Are you sure?"
>yes


 You step into the boat.  There is a space for a single passenger but
 it is not  exactly luxurious.  You barely have time to sit down upon
 the damp wooden boards before the ferryman takes his first stroke,
 propelling the boat forward at an unlikely speed that causes the
 moving air to catch at you like icy hands.  You  remember that someone
 told you once that a punt can travel at 30 miles an hour in
 favourable conditions ... but this one slips across the moonslick
 water as effortlessly as if it is glass.  At any rate, you are glad
 that the man has sufficient  taste to punt from the Oxford end.  You
 tilt your head back.  You are going so fast that the stars are smeared
 across the sky.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Iron Gates</span>
 Something has happened.  You have lost track of time, or track of
 yourself, or something.  You were looking at the sky, feeling stars
 upon your skin, no, you were in a boat, cold seeping through you, wind
 tangling in your hair.  But there is no trace of the punt here, or the
 man, or even a river.  How did you get here?  Where are you?  There is
 a set of open wrought iron gates before you, as intricate as briars.
 Beyond them, hazy in the darkness to the southeast, a round lawn,
 dotted with trees.  It all feels familiar somehow.

 Guarding the gate is biggest dog you have ever seen, a haunch of
 bloody meat and a vast water bowl at its feet.

>play lyre


 All three heads turn in your direction as you lift the lyre, and a
 strange shiver runs down the length of the beast's back.  If it was
 human you don't know what emotions you'd ascribe to it. It holds
 itself still and silent, only the heaving of its flanks to betray the
 fact it lives at all.  And you play, strange, savage music, spiralling
 out of the lyre, drenched inhuman colours, filling your mouth up with
 heat and the tang of metal.  Your heart tightens sickeningly in your
 chest, pulsing with the lyre strings, something like excitement,
 something like dread.  The dog trembles where it stands, its eyes
 ablaze.

>se


 You move.  The beast throws back all three heads and hurls a howl of
 blood-curdling ferocity at the sky.  And the clouds shake.  You think
 it would probably be for the best to stop moving.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">river</span>
 The river is a snake of moving darkness.  There is a railway line
 running parallel on the other side and open fields after that.  There
 is some kind of flat-bottomed boat by the bank nearest to you, and a
 tall man, in a long coat, is standing in the bow of the boat.

 Hinksey Park is behind you to the east.

>play lyre


 You sit down on the bank of the river and begin to run your fingers
 lightly over the strings of the lyre.  A strange stillness creeps over
 the universe as if it is holding its breath for you.  You play. At
 least you think it counts as playing.  It is as if the lyre has a
 human throat, from which you tear sound. You fill the space between
 earth and sky with screaming, bend the grasses to the ground with
 pain, strip the bark from the trees with the lash of your grief until
 the lyre shudders so violently in your hands you fear it will tear
 itself apart.  "All right, all right," says the ferryman, hastily.
 "I'll take you across.  Just that's enough of that, you hear me?  No
 more of that."

>enter boat


 As you step towards the boat the Ferryman intercepts you again.
 "Coming back is harder than going," he says. "Are you sure?"
>yes


 You step into the boat.  There is a space for a single passenger but
 it is not  exactly luxurious.  You barely have time to sit down upon
 the damp wooden boards before the ferryman takes his first stroke,
 propelling the boat forward at an unlikely speed that causes the
 moving air to catch at you like icy hands.  You  remember that someone
 told you once that a punt can travel at 30 miles an hour in
 favourable conditions ... but this one slips across the moonslick
 water as effortlessly as if it is glass.  At any rate, you are glad
 that the man has sufficient  taste to punt from the Oxford end.  You
 tilt your head back.  You are going so fast that the stars are smeared
 across the sky.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Iron Gates</span>
 Something has happened.  You have lost track of time, or track of
 yourself, or something.  You were looking at the sky, feeling stars
 upon your skin, no, you were in a boat, cold seeping through you, wind
 tangling in your hair.  But there is no trace of the punt here, or the
 man, or even a river.  How did you get here?  Where are you?  There is
 a set of open wrought iron gates before you, as intricate as briars.
 Beyond them, hazy in the darkness to the southeast, a round lawn,
 dotted with trees.  It all feels familiar somehow.

 Guarding the gate is biggest dog you have ever seen, a haunch of
 bloody meat and a vast water bowl at its feet.

>lay lyre


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>play lyre


 All three heads turn in your direction as you lift the lyre, and a
 strange shiver runs down the length of the beast's back.  If it was
 human you don't know what emotions you'd ascribe to it. It holds
 itself still and silent, only the heaving of its flanks to betray the
 fact it lives at all.  And you play, strange, savage music, spiralling
 out of the lyre, drenched inhuman colours, filling your mouth up with
 heat and the tang of metal.  Your heart tightens sickeningly in your
 chest, pulsing with the lyre strings, something like excitement,
 something like dread.  The dog trembles where it stands, its eyes
 ablaze.

>again


 You feel as if you have been running, and running hard, and your
 fingers tremble on the strings, fearful of the lyre and its music.
 But everything has changed.  Softly, softly, comes the scent of green
 things growing, dark places, damp fur, warmth in your belly and all
 around, different songs.  You lose time, the names of things. The
 stars becomes nothing but distant light. Your four clawed feet trample
 complex concepts to nothing but travelled earth, and happiness is the
 flow of the night.  Then comes the creeping cold, not without, but
 within, and it snaps like winter at your heels.  And you don't know
 what it means that yours is now the only song, and yours the only
 pounding paws, and yours the fur and yours the hunger and you alone
 who slumber in the dark places and dream of dreams once shared.  The
 music fades to silence, and the dog slumps to the ground, ungainly
 now.  Its eyes fall closed and it seems to sleep.

>se


 You muster up your courage and sidle past the subdued monster, holding
 your breath lest you rouse it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford Hospital Approach</span>
 You could be visiting a stately home, or an Oxford college, or a
 country church, except you're not.  You know there are more modern
 constructions hidden away behind it, one of which - the severely acute
 ward - lies like Sleeping Beauty's castle behind thorns of metal and
 stone.

 Circling an oval of moderately well-kept grass is a gravel path and,
 beyond it to the west, a sandstone building gleams palely golden
 against the shadowed sky. The gates loom to the northwest.

>go west


 As you cross the lawn, your footsteps lost among the many you have
 already taken, you feel a horrible tightness round you heart as if
 someone had a hand round it and was squeezing. There is a burning at
 the back your throat, like a lump of tears and bile is stuck there.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Path</span>
 The path sidles away down the side of the main building, taking you
 away from facades.  Here, there are no country house lawns, no
 sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass,
 borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings
 that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of
 beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to
 Cotswold House and Wintle Ward.

 Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the
 east.

>go west


 As you walk down the path, a human cry breaks upon the silence and
 dies.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Exterior</span>
 Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
 which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
 also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.

 The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
 There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
 to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

>push doorbell


 You depress the button and listen to the silence while you wait.  You
 do not trust the doorbell.  It demands your faith yet gives you no
 miracles.  It doesn't even buzz to let you know it's actually
 functional.  Finally, just when you have given up all hope in the
 doorbell, there is a crackling from behind the grill and a distorted
 voice asks what you want.

>play lyre


 The lyre feels strange and knobbly in your hands.  It does not want to
 be here, it does not want to play.

>talk to nurse


 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to grill


 You mumble your name into the grill, and explain you have come to get
 Celine.  A warped sigh gusts out of the grill with such force you are
 surprised it doesn't ruffle your hair.  Then crackling dies away and
 the grill speaks to you no further.  You assume that that means
 someone is coming to open the door but for all you know they could be
 activating the lever that drops you into the alligator pit.

 You are starting to wonder if perhaps they've forgotten you're there,
 or if answering the doorbell is a mere hobby, when there comes the
 sound of muted rattling and banging from behind the door as someone on
 the other side begins the ceremony required to open it.  It is finally
 eased open, just enough for you to squeeze through, by a Nurse,
 glowering at the effort required to perform the most basic tenets of
 her job.

>go west


 As you edge past the Nurse, she put out a log-like arm to momentarily
 stop you entering.  "You'll need to see the Doctor first," she says,
 gruffly. "You can't take a patient away without the doctor's
 permission."  You nod your understanding, although your mind is full
 of Escape from Alcatraz visions, search lights flashing, sirens
 screaming and helicopters whirling overhead as you and Celine run,
 hand in hand, giggling into a different coloured future.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Corridor</span>
 There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
 over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do
 nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a
 distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously
 has no smell, underscored by a desperate edge of nicotine.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Hall</span>
 This is the large, bow-windowed room you could see from outside.  Dull
 light washes in from the corridor behind you and flickers from beneath
 the door to the television room.  Square tables are neatly arranged
 and the far wall boasts a display of artwork.  Upon the air hangs the
 cloying scent of old, institutional dinners.

 The Doctor's Office lies to the north, the Vaughan Thomas corridor to
 the south.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Doctor's Office</span>
 This is a typical Doctor's office.  It has a clinical air, but no more
 than you would expect.  It is really very neat in here.  The walls are
 hung with what look to be modern art prints, all in identical frames,
 imprisoned behind glass.

 The Doctor is sitting behind the desk, his elbows resting atop it and
 his chin upon the platform provided by his interlocked fingers.

 The door to the south leads back to the dining hall.

>play lyre


 Time seems to unravel around you like the fraying threads of a
 tapestry as you lift the lyre into your arms.  The Doctor is on his on
 his feet, his face pale with fury and his eyes ablaze, but it's too
 late to stop you.  Music fills the air like cherry blossom, sweetly
 drifting, falling like fleeting kisses upon the senses and fading as
 swiftly as a summer evening.   For a moment, the Doctor is tranfixed,
 his face naked in pain and sorrow, and then his cold hands are
 wrenching the lyre from your grasp.  The notes shatter into rainbows
 of refracted light and then they're gone.  There is a vicious crack,
 like a bone breaking, and the Doctor flings the pieces of the lyre to
 the floor.  In seconds nothing remains of the lyre but a sprinkling of
 dust the colour of old blood.  "Take her then," he cries, "take her
 and may damnation have you both.  You'll find Celine in the gardens
 beyond the Sun Room.  Take her with you, as you wish, but remember:
 don't turn around, or she's mine forever.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Hall</span>

 light washes in from the corridor behind you and flickers from beneath

 cloying scent of old, institutional dinners.

 The Doctor's Office lies to the north, the Vaughan Thomas corridor to

>go south


 You  hear footsteps behind you, slapping like wet fish against the
 grey hospital floor.  You freeze and half-turn but then they recede.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Corridor</span>
 There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
 over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do
 nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a

 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 This is a primitive conservatory of sorts.  It is by far the most
 attractive room in the Warneford, which reflects well on neither the
 Warneford nor the room.  It has wicker chairs and, disconcertingly,
 there is white-sheeted hospital bed against one of the walls.  The
 square, unbeautiful windows overlook the grounds and currently admit a
 spill of moonlight the colour of old milk.

 Now you notice a set of doors at the back of the room have been flung
 wide open, drawing you like a beckoning finger, west, towards the
 shadow-smothered gardens.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford Gardens</span>
 Somebody tried.  Here there are the elements of a garden.  Grass,
 although it is mainly mud.  Banks of soil where perhaps flowers might
 grow.  Squatting shrubs, hunched in upon themselves.  And in
 silhouette the anorexic shapes of trees, stripped before the oncoming
 winter.  Moonlight forms puddles here and there.

 The Sun room waits to the east.

 Celine is sitting on a stone bench.

>talk to celnie


 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to celine


 Celine smiles to see you, convincing gladness, desperate eyes.  You
 exchange the usual greetings, the usual enquiries, and, as ever, she
 thanks you for coming to see her, as if it is a kind and wonderful
 thing and not a terrible strain for both of you.  You tell her silly
 stories of the colour of the October leaves and how much you're
 looking forward to the blossom trees.  She listens, and laughs, and
 pretends.

>go east


 You are determined not to leave this place this time without Celine.

>talk to celine


 Celine is not feeling so good and will only tell you so if you press
 her.  She has - quite literally - forgotten the way home, along with
 everything she learned on her art history course last term.  She has
 forgotten the tombstone cake you made for Jess's birthday.  She has
 forgotten Rick's parents are dead.  She has forgotten the entirety of
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It'll come back, you tell her, don't worry,
 and anyway we can watch it all over again - think how much fun that'll
 be.  She listens, and laughs, and pretends.

>again


 Celine tells you her secrets, the ones she hasn't forgotten, the ones
 you wish she could forget, the ones she has forgotten you already
 know.  You try to make it okay with your words.  And Celine listens,
 and laughs, and pretends.

>again


 Suddenly you remember.  It's time to go home.  "Will you follow me?"
 you ask, and Celine nods.  She seems only a little afraid.

 As you enter the sunroom from the gardens, your own footsteps sound on
 the floor but you hear no others.  Perhaps Celine has not followed as
 promised she would.

 The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east.

 You strain to hear even the slightest hint of movement but there is
 nothing, nothing at all.  Perhaps you have been tricked.  Yes, that
 seems very likely.

 This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
 East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

>go east


 You look around for the nurse but then notice that the door seems to
 be standing very slightly ajar.  You seize the opportunity and slip
 through
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Exterior</span>
 Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
 which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
 also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.

 The only thing that follows you now, it seems, is silence.

 The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
 There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
 to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford exit</span>
 Here on the Warneford lawn again you can see a streak of lightness at
 the eastern edge of the sky.  Behind you, a smear of gold and grey, is
 the Warneford.  Before you, to the northwest, the wrought iron gates,
 as tall as thistles to a child,  swinging open before you.

>go northwest


 You run through the gates and, as soon as both feet are indisputably
 over the threshold, you turn.  The shock of seeing her again, standing
 before you, looking no different to the last time you saw her alive,
 is too much for you. You fall but soft grass catches you, and laughter
 as heady as wine comes bubbling out of your mouth. Eurydice leans over
 you, while behind her the darkness peels away from the sky like a
 layer of dead skin.  There is a moment of confusion.  You feel an
 inexplicable coldness seeping into your skin from what should be the
 sun-warmed grass, and there is a babble of concerned voices - the
 wrong voices - calling out a name - the wrong name.  But then Eurydice
 kisses you and her lips are flower-petal soft and her mouth tastes of
 music and the sky is the colour of lapis-lazuli and, on the breeze,
 comes the scent of olive trees...



     <span class="floydstyle i">*** Finis. ***</span>


 This is "Fable", one of four possible endings for Eurydice.  To
 discover another, why not stop relying on the lyre to solve your
 difficulties?
