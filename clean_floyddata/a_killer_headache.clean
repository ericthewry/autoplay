 Ever since you died, the migraines have been getting worse. At first
 you tried the usual - aspirin, caffeine, screaming - but you quickly
 learned that the type of migraine caused by having a large part of
 your brain eaten by an undead creature does not respond well to
 medication. The only known remedy is nutritional.

 The brains of lower animals will work, partially, for a short time,
 but only human brains have the right balance of vitamins, essential
 fats and amino acids necessary to hold off the searing, throbbing
 agony long enough to make it to your next meal.  And they taste
 surprisingly good. Unfortunately, while you were busy figuring all
 this out, the rest of the undead world was finishing off the last of
 the human race, leaving you with...

 <span class="floydstyle header">A Killer Headache</span>
 A Distasteful Situation by Mike Ciul
 Release 3 / Serial number 121231 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cloudliner KC7 Trailer</span>
 This tiny trailer is where you would sleep, if you slept. The front
 door is to the south.

 What's left of a large mirror leans against the wall, smeared with
 dried blood and vomit. Pieces of broken glass litter the floor.

 Towards the back is a small kitchenette. There's not much to it, since
 the trailer has no water, gas, or electricity. The fridge is still
 here, though.

>open fridge

 You open the refrigerator, revealing the severed head of your friend
 Jim.

>examine head

 Eyes that were once steely blue have clouded over. There is a gaping
 hole in the back of the skull. The severed head is sitting on a shelf
 in the refrigerator.

>get head

 The head's eyes follow you as you pick it up.

>look in hole

 The skull was bashed in and most of the brains were scooped out and
 eaten. There's a lot of empty space in the skull cavity, but a small
 scrap of the hippocampus inside the head remains.

>sautee hppocampus

 I couldn't identify a verb in that command. Please enter a command
 such as LOOK, EXAMINE FRIDGE, or GO SOUTH.

>examine mirror

 (the broken mirror)
 Little remains but a few fragments of glass projecting from a wooden
 frame. Flies cluster around chunks of skin caught on the sharp edges.
 A much more pleasant sight than your own reflection.

>lick mirror

 (the broken mirror)
 The broken mirror tastes like dust.

>examine reflection

 Thankfully, there is not enough glass left in the mirror to see your
 reflection.

>eat hippocampus

 You scrape out the last of the rotten tissue and swallow it whole. The
 brains of the living are more nourishing, but you feel better as soon
 as it hits your stomach. You rock back and forth, feeling the heat
 spread through your body, soothing the rattling in your head.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Almost there.  </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">You rock back and forth, feeling the heat spread up your arm as</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you work. You're halfway through the spinal column. A hacksaw is just</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">not the right tool for this job.  Peter and Marie do their best to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">hold the body down, but it struggles more than ever. </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"It's not Jim anymore." Peter reminds you. "It's just a corpse. A</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">thing. A monster. You can do it, Jack."</span>

 This tiny trailer is where you would sleep, if you slept. The front

 What's left of a large mirror leans against the wall, smeared with
 dried blood and vomit. Pieces of broken glass litter the floor.

 The refrigerator is standing open.

 There's no hacksaw here. Are you hallucinating again?

>examine mirror

 (the broken mirror)
 Little remains but a few fragments of glass projecting from a wooden
 frame. Flies cluster around chunks of skin caught on the sharp edges.
 A much more pleasant sight than your own reflection.

>go south

 (first opening the front door)
 You grip the doorknob with your free hand and twist it. The door
 rattles, but doesn't open. You pull at the knob, but the door seems
 stuck. You yank at the doorknob again. The handle rips out of the door
 and you're left holding it in your hand.

>examine handle

 It's old and filthy with smears of dried fluids. The knob has been
 yanked from the door.

>kick door

 You give the front door a forceful kick, but it seems to do a lot more
 damage to your foot than your foot does to it.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Christ Almighty! This living death isn't for the weak</span>.

 Your foot is turned inward at an angle that would be impossible if it
 were firmly attached.

>push fridge

 It doesn't budge.

>examine door

 It's a splintered old wooden door with a missing handle. It is
 currently closed.

>hit door with handle

 You whack the doorknob against the door, but it hardly makes a mark.
 You hit it harder, until you hear a crack in your wrist.

 <span class="floydstyle em">God dammit to hell. </span>Flies settle on your body, tickling you
 in spots you can't reach.

>search glass
>look

 Among the pieces you find a shard of your mirror, about the size of a
 credit card.

 The head rolls its eyes, attempts to swallow, and speaks to you:
 "Ride. Riiiiiiide..."

 What's left of a large mirror leans against the wall, smeared with
 dried blood and vomit. Pieces of broken glass litter the floor.

 The refrigerator is standing open.

>examine glass

 There are countless pieces. You notice one in particular, a shard
 about the size of a credit card.

>take it

 That's fixed in place.

>take shard

 (putting the doorknob into the skull cavity to get your hand free)
 Taken.

>examine shard

 It's a shard of your mirror, about the size of a credit card.

>examine skull

 The skull was bashed in and all of the brains were scooped out and
 eaten.

 In the skull cavity is a doorknob.

>open door with shard

 Only the doorknob can unlatch the door.

>examine fridge

 It's a beat-up old white fridge, apartment-sized.

>get doorknob from cavity

 (putting the shard of your mirror into the skull cavity to get your
 hand free)
 Taken.

>inventory

 In one hand you have the severed head (containing a shard of your
 mirror). In the other you have a doorknob.

>open door with knob

 You slide the handle into the hole in the door and turn it, but you
 need another hand free to pull on the door.

>drop head

 The head bites onto your finger in an attempt to avoid being let go.
 The flesh of your hand is not very substantial, however, and the head
 drops to the ground, a small strip of your skin between its teeth.

>get shard

 Taken.

>open door with knob

 (putting the shard of your mirror into the skull cavity to get your
 hand free)
 You turn the doorknob, careful not to pull it out. Since you've got
 the other hand free, you're able to pry the door open with your
 fingernails.

 The front door swings closed with a bang.

>take head

 Taken.

>out

 (first opening the front door)
 The doorknob is loose, so you need a free hand to pry the door open
 while you turn it. You're still holding the severed head.

>drop head

 The head bites onto your finger in an attempt to avoid being let go.
 The flesh of your hand is not very substantial, however, and the head
 drops to the ground, a small strip of your skin between its teeth.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Trailer</span>
 Parked just uphill on the northern shoulder of the road is the
 battered Cloudliner trailer. The road leads along the mountainside
 from a pine grove in the west, and a sign points east towards the
 highway. Scattered trees and shrubs cling to the slope below you. The
 afternoon heat is on the wane.

 From inside the trailer, you hear the head wail, "Noooo! Doonnnn'
 leeavve!"

 Then the front door swings closed with a bang.

>go east

 You stumble along for what seems like quite a long distance. Your
 dragging foot catches on a rock. With a crack, it snaps right off and
 you plant your face in the hot asphalt. No matter, you can still crawl
 until you eat enough brains to reattach it.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Open Road</span> (crawling)
 You're crawling on an east-west road cut into the steep hillside. The
 desert spreads out to the south, covered by just enough low scrub to
 conceal a reasonably large predator.

 Your foot seems to have fallen off and it's lying on the ground
 nearby.

>take foot

 Taken.

>examine it

 Your foot is severed from your leg. Bones stick out of it at odd
 angles, and the sole is studded with gravel and broken glass. Every so
 often it flexes and wiggles its toes.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle i">Cracked Road</span> (crawling)
 Your path continues east over cracked, uneven asphalt. A glint of
 chrome to the east might be a diner. Everything here is dry as paper
 and there's not a cloud in sight to shade you from the harsh afternoon
 sun.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle i">Outside the Diner</span> (crawling)
 A roadside sign announces the Uptown Diner to the north. The door is
 chained shut, but the windows have been smashed, providing easy entry.
 The road continues east and a driveway leads around the diner to the
 northeast.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle i">Parking Lot</span> (crawling)
 A short drive from the southwest leads to this empty parking lot. The
 mountainside is choked with shrubs, obscuring the view of the road
 from here.

 Blinds in the windows prevent you from seeing inside the diner to the
 west. A paved walk leads northwest around the back of the building.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle i">Shed</span> (crawling)
 You are under an awning that forms a small shed against the back of
 the diner.  A paved walk leads east around the building past the
 parking lot. Next to the shed, a door marked "EMPLOYEES ONLY" leads
 south.

 A tangle of cables emerges from amid the vents on the wall. The cables
 snake down to a backup power generator.

 You can also see a siphon pump and a bright red plastic gas can here.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle i">Kitchen</span> (crawling)
 Traces of rust and mysterious stains line the reflective surfaces
 here, but do little to obscure the reflection of your gruesome
 appearance. The kitchen door is east, and there is an employee exit to
 the north.

 A massive steel door dominates the west end of the kitchen. It is
 closed.

 A key is in the keyhole of the steel door. It is attached by a chain
 to a bolt on the wall.

>examine key

 The key to the steel door is chained to a bolt on the wall. It's
 inserted into the lock, which is currently unlocked.

>examine steel door

 The steel door has a spring latch so it can be locked when it is open.
 It is currently closed and unlocked.

>open door

 You open the steel door.

>take key

 You take hold of the key at the end of the chain and remove it from
 the lock.

>go west

 As you leave, the chain tugs on the key in your hand. You let go and
 it dangles towards the floor.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Freezer</span> (crawling)
 This walk-in freezer is a dark and stuffy place with no power.
 Although cooler than outdoors, it has a suffocating atmosphere that
 makes you long for the open air.

 The freezer door is to the east. It is open.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle i">Kitchen</span> (crawling)
 Traces of rust and mysterious stains line the reflective surfaces
 here, but do little to obscure the reflection of your gruesome

 A massive steel door dominates the west end of the kitchen. It is
 open.

 A steel key hangs from a chain bolted to the wall.

>insert key

 I didn't understand that. Try rephrasing your command another way.

>lock door

 (with the steel key)
 (first taking the steel key)

 You take hold of the key at the end of the chain.

 You lock the freezer door.

>remove key

 You're not wearing that!

>take key

 You already have that.

 You are under an awning that forms a small shed against the back of
 the diner.  A paved walk leads east around the building past the

 south.

 A tangle of cables emerges from amid the vents on the wall. The cables
 snake down to a backup power generator.

 You can also see a siphon pump and a bright red plastic gas can here.

>examine cables

 The generator is weathered, but nothing is obviously broken, and it's
 still hooked up to some thick cables that run into the building. It
 has a large opening on the top labeled "GASOLINE." The gas cap seems
 to be missing. There's also a button labeled "IGNITION." Down near the
 bottom, where the motor is located, there's a pull cord with a plastic
 handle.

 The generator is currently switched off.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle i">Parking Lot</span> (crawling)

 The road continues east and a driveway leads around the diner to the
 northeast.

>in


 <span class="floydstyle i">The Uptown Diner</span> (crawling)
 A long counter divides the dining room from the kitchen entrance to
 the west. Booths line the east wall. Many of the windows are smashed,
 including most of the ones on the south wall, which provide an
 alternative exit to the locked front door. The floor is scattered with
 broken dishes and window glass.

 An old jukebox stands in one corner, dark and silent.

>examine jukebox

 The jukebox is as dark and silent as every electrical device in the
 diner. An array of panels list the available songs. There is a button
 labeled with the disc number and side by each one:

   A1: After the Fall - Klaus Nomi
   B1: The Voyeur of Utter Destruction - David Bowie

   A2: Piggy Smack - Severed Heads
   B2: Big Car - Severed Heads

   A3: Mad World - Tears for Fears
   B3: Everybody Wants to Rule the World - Tears for Fears

   A4: Thriller - Michael Jackson
   B4: Ghostbusters - Ray Parker Junior

   A5: Jerdacuttup Man - The Triffids
   B5: The Spinning Top Song - The Triffids

   A6: Love Zombie - Sweet Lickin' Honey Babes
   B6: I'm Not the Man I Used to Be - Fine Young Cannibals

   A7: Omnichrome - Three Hour Detour
   B7: Snow Karma - Three Hour Detour

 Button B2 looks more worn than the others - you can hardly read the
 label at all.

 An old jukebox stands in one corner, dark and silent.

>press b2

 Nothing happens. The jukebox doesn't appear to have any power.

>examine counter

 The counter extends from the north wall. It's made of rusted steel and
 chipped formica, and it's covered with dark sticky stains. Broken and
 twisted bolts in the floor indicate that the barstools were ripped
 out, probably for use in the general smashing of stuff that has taken
 place here. They are nowhere to be found now.

>examine dishes

 The word "dishes" was not understood.

>examine booths

 Each booth is a formica table with two bench seats upholstered in
 ripped and faded red vinyl, with a speaker positioned on the ceiling
 directly overhead.

>examine me

 Your hand isn't quite as firmly attached to your arm as it ought to
 be, and you are missing a foot. You have eaten a last piece of your
 friend Jim's brains. A sledgehammer-like rhythm pounds its way from
 the back of your skull towards your eyeballs, but it only hurts about
 five times as much as the worst headache you ever experienced while
 alive.

 You flail your limbs around on the floor.

>pick up limbs

 That's not something you can see right now.

>inventory

 In one hand you have your severed foot. The other hand is free.

>attach foot

 (to your leg)
 You hold your severed foot against your leg, but your body must not be
 ready to heal, because it doesn't stick. You need to find some more
 brains to eat.

>advertise happy hour

 It's about the size and shape of the gasoline intake on a car.

>examine can

 It's light and doesn't slosh - it must be empty, though it does bear
 the soothing odor of gasoline fumes.

 Flopping like a stranded trout, your foot arrives from the parking

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle i">Pile-up</span> (crawling)
 The road curves to the north here around a steep cliff. Dead ahead is
 the scene of a horrific accident - four or five cars are smashed
 together. Behind the pile-up is another wreck: lying on its side,
 blocking the entire road, is the carcass of a school bus.

 Several more cars seem to have stopped short of the accident scene.
 Most are stripped-down or rusted beyond recognition, but a large, boxy
 blue sedan looks more recent.

 Your severed foot arrives from the west.

>examine sedan

 It's an old Dodge. Light blue, scratched and dusty, but still in
 decent shape. The doors and windows are locked, but the gas cap for
 the sedan's tank is open.

>examine blue sedan

 It's an old Dodge. Light blue, scratched and dusty, but still in
 decent shape. The doors and windows are locked, but the gas cap for
 the sedan's tank is open.

>examine bus

 Straining to see through the smashed windows to the darkness inside,
 it looks like there's plenty of bodily fluids staining the seats.
 Maybe a few limbs too.

>put pump in sedan

 You insert the siphon pump into the sedan's gas tank.

>put pump in can

 You insert the siphon pump into the nozzle. Now the pump connects it
 to the sedan's gas tank.

>pump pump

 You start to squeeze the bulb, but it feels too stiff. It's dried out
 and beginning to crack - any further squeezing would probably break
 it.

>take pump

>spit

 What do you want to spit?

>bulb

 That's not in your mouth.

>get in bus

 You work your way through the wreckage towards the schoolbus. There's
 definitely something moving around underneath. You crouch down and
 reach your hand in. Something grabs it and pulls you forward. It's a
 small hand, and in the shadows you make out a blanched round face, and
 then several others. More hands grab your limbs, pulling them in
 different directions, then tiny teeth nip at your flesh as fingernails
 pry at your skull.

 In a moment, you're opened wide and icicles of hurt shoot from your
 head through your paralyzed body. As the children scoop out your
 brains, you become disoriented, but your consciousness of the pain
 never fades...

 You spit the siphon pump out onto the ground. It's a little slimy now,
 but still usable.

>examine pump

 Two flexible plastic tubes connect to either end of a black rubber
 squeeze bulb.

>attach pump to sedan

 You might as well just drop the siphon pump.

>put pump in tank

 You insert the siphon pump into the sedan's gas tank.

>bite bulb

 You grip the siphon pump between your teeth.

>squeeze bulb

 The squeeze bulb is too brittle - you'll have to find another way to
 fill the pump with gas.

>suck on pump

 You suck hard. Nothing comes. Then, very quickly, the gasoline rises
 through the pump and shoots into your mouth. You gag, but the fumes
 give you momentary relief from the pounding in your head.

 You are now holding the pump in your mouth to keep the gasoline from
 flowing out again.

>inventory

 In one hand you have a gas can. The other hand is free. You're holding
 a full siphon pump in your teeth.

>suck pump

 You've drunk enough gasoline already.

>blow pump

 I didn't understand that. Try rephrasing your command another way.

>put pump in can

 (first removing the pump from your mouth)
 You insert the pump into the nozzle and the tubes take on a
 comfortable chill as gasoline flows through them. Soon the flow stops
 and air bubbles back into the pump.

 A tattered orthopedic shoe crunches by your ear. You twist your head
 around and look up.

 "Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I didn't mean to startle you!" says the kindly
 old nun looking down at you.

>put gas in can

 (the sedan's gas tank in the gas can)
 That already has one end of the pump in it.

>examine nun

 A smiling woman in her seventies, the old nun looks quite dignified in
 her purple dress. The fact that one eye is missing and a dark purple
 ooze stains her plain white veil and flows out from where her left ear
 should be does nothing to reduce her appearance of grace and goodwill.
 A rosary made of irregular white beads hangs from her waist. She's
 smiling at you cheerfully.

>examine rosary

 The rosary has a loop of five decades, or sets of of ten beads, with a
 single bead separating each decade from the next. A string of four
 more beads hangs from the loop, with a crucifix at the end. Every bead
 represents a prayer. You know how to pray the rosary, and when you
 were alive you used one to calm down. This one appears to be made of
 cavity-riddled teeth hooked together with small pieces of wire.

 "Isn't this a lovely rosary? Would you like to have it?" She holds it
 out to you.

>ask nun for rosary

 You ask the old nun for the rosary.

 "Go ahead, take it," she offers.

>take rosary

 Taken.

>pray

 Your fingers are too spastic to do the rosary one-handed. You'll have
 to put the gas can down first.

>full gas can

 You mumble something almost comprehensible about the gas can.

 "Well, if you change your mind, you can have it," the old nun replies.

>drop can

 Dropped.

>pray

 You hold the rosary in your hands, counting off beads with your
 fingers. You start with the cross on the end, making the sign of the
 cross and praying the Apostle's Creed. At the first bead you say the
 Lord's Prayer, and then a Hail Mary on each of the next three.

>pray

 You enter the loop, which contains five strings of ten beads, each
 with a single bead in between. Meditating on the Resurrection, you say
 an Our Father and ten Hail Marys.

>pray

 You recite another decade meditating on Christ's ascent into heaven.

>pray

 You contemplate Pentecost, the time when The Holy Spirit descended on
 the apostles in tongues of fire. You say an Our Father and ten more
 Hail Marys.

>pray

 You say another Our Father and ten Hail Marys meditating on the
 mystery of the Assumption, in which the Blessed Virgin Mary is taken
 up into heaven.

>pray

 You complete the last decade of the rosary. The fifth mystery is the
 Coronation of Mary, Queen of Heaven. At the end you pray:

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hail, Holy Queen, mother of mercy,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">our life, our sweetness and our hope.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of tears.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">us,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and after this our exile, show us the blessed fruit of thy womb,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Jesus.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the promises of Christ."</span>

 Or at least that's how it goes in your head. The actual sound you make
 is more like <span class="floydstyle em">"Fghh hu arhl hrh cluh thghhl." </span>

>pray

 You hold the rosary in your hands, counting off beads with your
 fingers. You start with the cross on the end, making the sign of the
 cross and praying the Apostle's Creed. At the first bead you say the
 Lord's Prayer, and then a Hail Mary on each of the next three.

>eat nun

 You reach for her greedily but she stops your arm, holding it with an
 iron grip. "Dear me, child," she says. "If you want something, you
 ought to ask nicely."

>ask nun for brains

 "BRAAI--" you begin, but the old nun interrupts. "Hush now! You'll
 startle those creatures under the bus."

 The old nun looks you over gravely. "You're in very bad shape, my
 friend. Very bad. I wish I could help you. I'd even give you my own
 brain, if it were enough. But I don't think you'd have the strength to
 escape without eating more than that," she says. "Go find yourself
 some more brains to eat, and maybe I'll be able to help you then."

>fill gas can

 (from the blue sedan)
 That already has one end of the pump in it.

>examine can

 It sloshes heavily.

 One end of the siphon pump is sticking into the opening.

 "I see you got some gasoline out of my old clunker here," the old nun
 observes. "I hope it can be of use to you, and do please let me know
 if there's anything else I can help you with," she says.

>drink gas

 (the gas can)
 The gas can has the siphon pump in it.

>take pump

 (Removing the end of the siphon pump from the gas can)
 (Removing the end of the siphon pump from the sedan's gas tank)
 Taken.

>thank nun

 I couldn't identify a verb or a subject you can talk about in that
 command.

>take can

 Your hands are full.

>drop pump

 Dropped.

>take can

 Taken.

>go west

 You put away the rosary.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Outside the Diner</span> (crawling)
 A roadside sign announces the Uptown Diner to the north. The door is
 chained shut, but the windows have been smashed, providing easy entry.
 The road continues east and a driveway leads around the diner to the
 northeast.

 Your severed foot arrives from the east.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Parking Lot</span> (crawling)
 A short drive from the southwest leads to this empty parking lot. The
 mountainside is choked with shrubs, obscuring the view of the road
 from here.

 Blinds in the windows prevent you from seeing inside the diner to the

 Your severed foot arrives from the front of the diner.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Shed</span> (crawling)
 You are under an awning that forms a small shed against the back of
 the diner.  A paved walk leads east around the building past the
 parking lot. Next to the shed, a door marked "EMPLOYEES ONLY" leads
 south.

 A tangle of cables emerges from amid the vents on the wall. The cables
 snake down to a backup power generator.

 Your severed foot arrives from the parking lot.

>examine generator

 The generator is weathered, but nothing is obviously broken, and it's
 still hooked up to some thick cables that run into the building. It
 has a large opening on the top labeled "GASOLINE." The gas cap seems
 to be missing. There's also a button labeled "IGNITION." Down near the
 bottom, where the motor is located, there's a pull cord with a plastic
 handle.

 The generator is currently switched off.

>examine opening

 It's about the size and shape of the gasoline intake on a car.

>fill opening with can

 You insert the nozzle into the intake and gasoline glugs in. You pull
 it out again.

>push button

 You push the ignition button, but nothing happens. There's probably no
 battery power left.

>pull cord

 You pull on the cord and you hear a couple of bangs as the engine
 turns over. You try again and <span class="floydstyle em">the lawnmower roars to a start. Wow,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">that noise is loud - it makes everything shake.</span>

>push button

 <span class="floydstyle em">There's no Snow Karma here. Are you hallucinating?</span>

>examine lawnmower

 <span class="floydstyle em">It's old, rusty, and heavy, but it might make a decent weapon if</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you gave it a really good swing.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Lawnmower?</span>

 Damn. Forgot you were dead again.

>examine me

 Your hand isn't quite as firmly attached to your arm as it ought to
 be, and you are missing a foot. You have eaten a last piece of your
 friend Jim's brains. A sledgehammer-like rhythm pounds its way from
 the back of your skull towards your eyeballs, but it only hurts about
 five times as much as the worst headache you ever experienced while
 alive.

 broken dishes and window glass.

 An old jukebox stands in one corner, lit up and ready to play a tune.

 Your severed foot arrives from outside the front of the diner.

>push b2

 The jukebox comes to life, and your selection, "B2: 'Big Car' by
 Severed Heads," lights up on the display. After a few clunks and
 whirrs from inside, you hear a woman's voice screaming from the

 <span class="floydstyle i">Pines</span> (crawling)
 As the road leads into the mountains, the gnarled old pine trees get
 thicker. Further travel west is blocked by a pile of fallen rocks.

 A wretched old yellow dog is lying dead in the dirt. In its mouth is
 your severed hand.

 A pack of wild dogs is barking aggressively and hopping around, each
 one tripping over the others to get at you first. One of them seems to
 have something in its mouth.

 You feel an itching at the end of your leg and your arm. The stump of
 your ankle is really throbbing.

>examine mouth

 (the wild dog's mouth)
 The animal has your foot in its mouth. It must have picked it up and
 followed the scent here.

 Your ankle continues to throb.

>attach foot

 (to your leg)
 As you place your foot on your leg, the itching becomes more intense
 until it feels like a white-hot flame. Cartilage springs from your
 bone as sinews reattach and flesh crawls together. Within a minute or
 so your foot is as whole as it was before - that is to say, putrid and
 threadbare, but attached.

 Unfortunately, your headache is worse now.

>attach hand

 (to your arm)
 You hold your severed hand against your arm, but your body must not be
 ready to heal, because it doesn't stick. You need to find some more
 brains to eat.

>status

 Your foot has been fused back onto your leg, and you are missing a
 hand. You have eaten some old yellow dog's brains and a last piece of
 your friend Jim's brains. Your head is throbbing painfully, but it's
 only about four times the intensity of the worst headache you ever
 felt in your life.

 The hills here are steep and treacherous. You saw a dead guy going
 down a slope like this one time -- he tripped and fell quite a ways.
 Having both legs broken wouldn't have been so bad in itself, but then
 the wild dogs and the vultures found him. His flesh kept growing back
 and they just kept chewing it off before he could build up the

 The only way back is down the road to the east.

 You flee towards the east, pursued by the dogs.

 You stumble along for what seems like quite a long distance. Your
 dragging foot catches on a rock. With a crack, it snaps right off and
 you plant your face in the hot asphalt.

 The pack leaps upon you silently, pinning you to the pavement and
 tearing into your flesh. Your throat is torn out, your spine is
 crushed, and you feel the world tumble as your head rolls away from
 your body. The dogs lose interest in a short while, and then the
 vultures arrive to pick at your exposed organs. Somehow you are still
 able to feel all of it.

 You squeeze into the trailer and slam the door behind you.

 This tiny trailer is where you would sleep, if you slept. The front
 door is to the south.

 What's left of a large mirror leans against the wall, smeared with
 dried blood and vomit. Pieces of broken glass litter the floor.

 The refrigerator is standing open.

 The severed head is lying on the floor, its eyes following you
 crookedly.

 The sound of barking dogs is coming from the front door.

 Outside you hear howls of frustration. The door rattles as paws
 scratch and bodies thump against it. After a while, the barking turns
 to sniffing, and then silence as the animals leave in search of easier
 prey.

>ou

 You turn the doorknob, careful not to pull it out. By rubbing the
 stump of your wrist against the edge of the door, you're able to
 chivvy it open.

 Then the front door swings closed with a bang.

>go east

 You stumble along for what seems like quite a long distance. The road
 is uneven here, and your poor vision misses many rocks and pieces of
 debris. You trip on something, planting your face in the hot asphalt,
 but your foot seems to have healed well enough to take the punishment.
 You get up again.

 You're walking on an east-west road cut into the steep hillside. The

 A roadside sign announces the Uptown Diner to the north. The door is

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Uptown Diner</span>
 A long counter divides the dining room from the kitchen entrance to
 the west. Booths line the east wall. Many of the windows are smashed,
 including most of the ones on the south wall, which provide an
 alternative exit to the locked front door. The floor is scattered with
 broken dishes and window glass.

 An old jukebox stands in one corner, lit up and ready to play a tune.

 A pack of wild dogs is barking aggressively and hopping around, each
 one tripping over the others to get at you first.

>push b2

 The jukebox comes to life, and your selection, "B2: 'Big Car' by
 Severed Heads," lights up on the display. After a few clunks and
 whirrs from inside, you hear a woman's voice screaming from the
 loudspeaker over the booth:

 "All the way to the bottom, Maggie. You made it! AAAAAAAAAAAARHHH!"
 Then the music starts.

>examine dogs

 There are four or five big mongrel dogs - they move so fast and your
 vision is so poor that you can't be sure. They look stout and healthy,
 unlike the rabid beast you just took down. They're barking
 aggressively and hopping around, each one tripping over the others to
 get at you first.

 The jukebox is playing selection B2: 'Big Car' by Severed Heads. A
 foursquare techno beat.

 You flail around, jumping up and down like a crazy fool. It makes you
 a little dizzy, but your head doesn't hurt any worse for it.

 The jukebox is playing selection B2: 'Big Car' by Severed Heads. A
 foursquare techno beat.

>examine jukebox

 A light behind the entry for "B2: 'Big Car' by Severed Heads"
 indicates that it is now playing, and the music fills the room from a
 number of speakers over the booths. An array of panels list the
 available songs. There is a button labeled with the disc number and
 side by each one:

   A1: After the Fall - Klaus Nomi
   B1: The Voyeur of Utter Destruction - David Bowie

   A2: Piggy Smack - Severed Heads
   B2: Big Car - Severed Heads

   A3: Mad World - Tears for Fears

   A6: Love Zombie - Sweet Lickin' Honey Babes
   B6: I'm Not the Man I Used to Be - Fine Young Cannibals

   A7: Omnichrome - Three Hour Detour
   B7: Snow Karma - Three Hour Detour

 Button B2 looks more worn than the others - you can hardly read the
 label at all.

 A foursquare techno beat.

 A tangle of cables emerges from amid the vents on the wall. The cables
 snake down to a backup power generator that is chugging away noisily.

 The generator makes a really loud noise, and it makes everything
 shake. You can't even think straight.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parking Lot</span>
 A short drive from the southwest leads to this empty parking lot. The

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pile-up</span>
 The road curves to the north here around a steep cliff. Dead ahead is
 the scene of a horrific accident - four or five cars are smashed
 together. Behind the pile-up is another wreck: lying on its side,
 blocking the entire road, is the carcass of a school bus.

 Several more cars seem to have stopped short of the accident scene.
 Most are stripped-down or rusted beyond recognition, but a large, boxy
 blue sedan looks more recent.

 A religious sister is smiling at you peacefully.

 Christina observes. "I hope it can be of use to you, and do please let

 You offer your severed hand to Sister Christina Therese.

 She takes your severed hand and holds it out so you can steady
 yourself to reattach it.

>attach hand

 You hold your severed hand against your arm, but nothing happens. Your
 body refuses to heal.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Noooo! Need more braaaains!"</span> you howl.
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Braaaaaaaaaaiiins!"</span>

 You hear a great number of high-pitched voices somewhere among the
 wreckage. You can't make out what they're saying.

 "Oh listen to all these pitiable wretches! You must be very hungry,
 friend," Sister Christina says to you. "Here, you need this more than
 I do."

 She kneels down and pulls back her veil, exposing a scarred head
 dotted with patches of brittle white hair. A large gash running from
 front to back reveals that her skull is cracked open and most of her
 brain is still intact.

 "Go ahead, dear. I know you'll feel much better."

>push trigger

 Ow! A sharp stabbing snaps you back to reality. Your headache has
 intensified to a level you didn't believe was possible. What appeared
 in your daydream to be a crowd of adults turns out to be mere children
 - just as dead, but crawling enthusiastically from underneath the
 schoolbus rather than approaching from all sides.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pile-up</span>
 The road curves to the north here around a steep cliff. Dead ahead is
 the scene of a horrific accident - four or five cars are smashed
 together. Behind the pile-up is another wreck: lying on its side,
 blocking the entire road, is the carcass of a school bus.

 Several more cars seem to have stopped short of the accident scene.
 Most are stripped-down or rusted beyond recognition, but a large, boxy
 blue sedan looks more recent.

 Sister Christina Therese is sitting on the ground, staring ahead with
 a pure, empty gaze.

 A small crowd of decaying schoolchildren is emerging from under the
 schoolbus and spreading down the road to the west.

 You can also see a siphon pump and your severed hand here.

 You feel an itching at the end of your arm.

>attach hand

 (to your arm)
 As you place your hand on your arm, the itching becomes more intense
 until it feels like a white-hot flame. Cartilage springs from your
 bone as sinews reattach and flesh crawls together. Within a minute or
 so your hand is as whole as it was before - that is to say, putrid and
 threadbare, but attached.

 Unfortunately, your headache is worse now.

>status

 Your hand has been fused back onto your arm, and your foot has been
 fused back onto your leg. You have eaten some Sister's brains, some
 old yellow dog's brains, and a last piece of your friend Jim's brains.
 A ringing in your ears like a power drill boring into your skull is
 the last remnant of a once formidable headache. Now it's only about
 twice as bad as anything you had while living.

>examine children

 They're emerging from under the schoolbus and spreading down the road
 to the west.

>go east

 The wreckage of multiple vehicles blocks further passage down the
 road. The only way back is to the west.

>go west

 You shuffle along with the moving crowd...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Diner</span>
 A roadside sign announces the Uptown Diner to the north. The door is
 chained shut, but the windows have been smashed, providing easy entry.
 The road continues east and a driveway leads around the diner to the
 northeast.

 A small crowd of rotting schoolchildren is collected here, some of
 them eyeing you shyly with blackened drool oozing from gaps between
 their rotted teeth. They're wandering over from the east, and moving
 towards the west.

>in

 Some of the children watch hungrily as you leave.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Uptown Diner</span>
 A long counter divides the dining room from the kitchen entrance to
 the west. Booths line the east wall. Many of the windows are smashed,
 including most of the ones on the south wall, which provide an
 alternative exit to the locked front door. The floor is scattered with
 broken dishes and window glass.

 An old jukebox stands in one corner, lit up and ready to play a tune.

 The sound of barking dogs is coming from the kitchen door.

>push b2

 The jukebox comes to life, and your selection, "B2: 'Big Car' by
 Severed Heads," lights up on the display. After a few clunks and
 whirrs from inside, you hear a woman's voice screaming from the
 loudspeaker over the booth:

 "All the way to the bottom, Maggie. You made it! AAAAAAAAAAAARHHH!"
 Then the music starts.

 Undead children arrive from outside the front of the diner, and
 immediately begin dancing to the music from the jukebox, as if this
 were all a party planned in their honor.

>go west

 The dancing children are so densely packed by the kitchen entrance
 that you can't get past.

 The jukebox is playing selection B2: 'Big Car' by Severed Heads. A
 foursquare techno beat.

>open kitchen door

 That's not something you can see right now.

>go east

 You slip into the booth without the children noticing. It seems that
 second-graders are even more easily distractible when they're dead.

 <span class="floydstyle i">The Uptown Diner</span> (in the booth)
 A long counter divides the dining room from the kitchen entrance to
 the west. Booths line the east wall. Many of the windows are smashed,
 including most of the ones on the south wall, which provide an
 alternative exit to the locked front door. The floor is scattered with
 broken dishes and window glass.

 A handful of decaying schoolchildren are dancing to the music,
 temporarily oblivious to your presence. More are joining them as they
 come in from outside the front of the diner.

 Each booth is a formica table with two bench seats upholstered in
 ripped and faded red vinyl, with a speaker positioned on the ceiling
 directly overhead. This booth has a blind covering the window. It's
 crooked and appears to be jammed, but it covers the glass so that you
 can't tell whether it's broken or not.

>break glass

 (the east window)
 You ball your fist up and punch the window. Your fist bounces off. You
 try again, harder, and pieces of bone splinter from your knuckles.
 Finally, you pound your head against the window and it shatters
 pleasingly. You pick the bits of glass from your flesh and drop them
 to the ground.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parking Lot</span>
 A short drive from the southwest leads to this empty parking lot. The
 mountainside is choked with shrubs, obscuring the view of the road
 from here.

 The windows are smashed, allowing entry to the diner to the west. A
 paved walk leads northwest around the back of the building.

 This would be a nice quiet place to hide out, but there's no chance of
 that now that the kids have seen you going back here.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shed</span>
 You are standing under an awning that forms a small shed against the
 back of the diner.  A paved walk leads east around the building past
 the parking lot. Next to the shed, a door marked "EMPLOYEES ONLY"
 leads south.

 A tangle of cables emerges from amid the vents on the wall. The cables
 snake down to a backup power generator that is chugging away noisily.

 The generator makes a really loud noise, and it makes everything
 shake. You can't even think straight.

 The sound of barking dogs is coming from the employee entrance.

 In the parking lot you see a few of the children wandering over from
 the road.

>examine generator

 The generator is weathered, but nothing is obviously broken, and it's
 still hooked up to some thick cables that run into the building. It
 has a large opening on the top labeled "GASOLINE." The gas cap seems
 to be missing. There's also a button labeled "IGNITION." Down near the
 bottom, where the motor is located, there's a pull cord with a plastic
 handle.

 The generator is currently switched on.

 The gas tank is full.

>switch off generator

 There's no obvious way to turn off the generator. It's probably
 designed to shut down automatically when the grid power comes back on.

>go south

 Everything is shaking. You try to turn the handle on the back door but
 you can't get a good grip on it.

 A crowd of mean-looking kids sidles over from the parking lot, ready
 to tussle. With the kind of bloodthirsty abandon only a dead guy can
 muster, you take down half a dozen of them and sink your teeth into a
 soft, moldering head. But more of them pile on top, and you go down at
 the bottom of the pile...

 Several dead schoolchildren are milling around. They're wandering over
 from the front of the diner, and moving towards the back entrance of
 the diner.

 A sudden chill comes over the crowd and their attention focuses more
 sharply on you. As one, they reach out and begin pulling at your
 clothes, at your flesh. Little fingers pry your skull open wide and
 little teeth sink into the rotting remainder of your brain. Your body
 is laid out flat by many hands, and you become a permanent feast.

 A roadside sign announces the Uptown Diner to the north. The door is
 chained shut, but the windows have been smashed, providing easy entry.
 The road continues east and a driveway leads around the diner to the
 northeast.

 A horde of decaying schoolchildren is crowding you in. They're
 wandering over from the east, and moving towards the west and the
 inside of the diner.

>go west

 You stumble along, trying to get past the horde. Your dragging foot
 catches on a rock. With a crack, it snaps right off and you plant your
 face in the hot asphalt.

 The crowd leaps upon you with squeals of anticipation. They crack your
 skull wide like an egg and suck out the last rotten remains of your
 brain, as the world swirls into an increasingly painful blur. Your
 body becomes a plaything for a band of inquisitive little torturers...


     *** There is no relief. ***

>go west

 You climb in the window, and find yourself in a booth.

 <span class="floydstyle i">The Uptown Diner</span> (in the booth)
 A long counter divides the dining room from the kitchen entrance to
 the west. Booths line the east wall. Many of the windows are smashed,
 including most of the ones on the south wall, which provide an
 alternative exit to the locked front door. The floor is scattered with
 broken dishes and window glass.

 An old jukebox stands in one corner, lit up and ready to play a tune.

 A horde of decaying schoolchildren is wandering around the diner. They
 don't seem to notice you.

 Each booth is a formica table with two bench seats upholstered in
 ripped and faded red vinyl, with a speaker positioned on the ceiling
 directly overhead. This booth has a blind covering the window. It's
 crooked and appears to be jammed, but it covers the glass so that you
 can't tell whether it's broken or not.

 The sound of barking dogs is coming from the kitchen door.

>dance

 You flail around, jumping up and down like a crazy fool. It makes you
 a little dizzy, but your head doesn't hurt any worse for it.

>examine kitchen

 The sound of barking dogs is coming from the kitchen door.

>go west

 The children are so densely packed by the kitchen entrance that you
 can't get past.

>examine kitchen

 That's not something you can see right now.

>examine door

 A heavy chain wrapped around the chrome bars of the door prevents it
 from opening. But if you wanted to leave the diner, you could just
 walk south through the smashed windows.

>examine jukebox

 The jukebox is powered up, but not playing anything right now. An
 array of panels list the available songs. There is a button labeled
 with the disc number and side by each one:

   A1: After the Fall - Klaus Nomi
   B1: The Voyeur of Utter Destruction - David Bowie

   A2: Piggy Smack - Severed Heads
   B2: Big Car - Severed Heads

   A3: Mad World - Tears for Fears

   A4: Thriller - Michael Jackson
   B4: Ghostbusters - Ray Parker Junior

   A5: Jerdacuttup Man - The Triffids

   B6: I'm Not the Man I Used to Be - Fine Young Cannibals

   A7: Omnichrome - Three Hour Detour
   B7: Snow Karma - Three Hour Detour

 Button B2 looks more worn than the others - you can hardly read the
 label at all.

>push b2

 The jukebox comes to life, and your selection, "B2: 'Big Car' by
 Severed Heads," lights up on the display. After a few clunks and
 whirrs from inside, you hear a woman's voice screaming from the
 loudspeaker over the booth:

 "All the way to the bottom, Maggie. You made it! AAAAAAAAAAAARHHH!"
 Then the music starts.

 The children perk their mangled ears up to the speakers above the
 booths. They seem to think that screaming woman is here somewhere,
 maybe in the booth. They turn from you and slump over to the booth,
 poking around and picking at each other's flesh idly.

>go west

 Some of the children watch distractedly as you leave.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Traces of rust and mysterious stains line the reflective surfaces
 here, but do little to obscure the reflection of your gruesome
 appearance. The kitchen door is east, and there is an employee exit to
 the north.

 A massive steel door dominates the west end of the kitchen. It is open
 and locked.

 A steel key hangs from a chain bolted to the wall.

 A pack of wild dogs is barking aggressively and hopping around, each
 one tripping over the others to get at you first.

 Muffled music can be heard coming from the jukebox in the dining room.

>go east

 You head for the dining room, pursued by the dogs.

 including most of the ones on the south wall, which provide an
 alternative exit to the locked front door. The floor is scattered with
 broken dishes and window glass.

 A horde of decaying schoolchildren is dancing to the music in a tight
 clump around the booth, oblivious to your presence.

 The dogs charge in after you and then see the children. For a moment,
 all creatures are frozen, and then they approach one another with
 quiet, sideways steps.

 When another child enters from outside the front of the diner, you're
 suddenly pushed aside by a twirling melee of claws, fingernails and
 teeth. Fresh blood mingles with rotten black ichor like a Paleo
 smoothie gone wrong. The dogs squeal with surprise and terror as more
 children arrive, then they bolt from the room. The pile of wounded
 children struggles to its feet and turns its attention on you.

 The jukebox is playing selection B2: 'Big Car' by Severed Heads. A
 foursquare techno beat.

 maybe in the booth. They turn from you and slump over to the booth,
 poking around and picking at each other's flesh idly.

>go west

 You push your way through the moving crowd...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Traces of rust and mysterious stains line the reflective surfaces
 here, but do little to obscure the reflection of your gruesome
 appearance. The kitchen door is east, and there is an employee exit to
 the north.

 A massive steel door dominates the west end of the kitchen. It is open
 and locked.

 A steel key hangs from a chain bolted to the wall.

 A horde of undead schoolchildren is crowding you in, and moving
 towards the back entrance of the diner.

 Muffled music can be heard coming from the jukebox in the dining room.

>undo freeze

 I couldn't identify a verb in that command.

>unlock freezeer

 The word "freezeer" was not understood.

>unlock freezer

 (with the steel key)
 (first taking the steel key)

 You take hold of the key at the end of the chain.

 You unlock the steel door.

 Muffled music can be heard coming from the jukebox in the dining room.

>go west

 As you leave, the chain tugs on the key in your hand. You let go and
 it dangles towards the floor.

 Some of the children watch hungrily as you leave.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Freezer</span>
 Pale fluorescent lights illuminate the room. With the power back on,
 this walk-in freezer is getting cold quite rapidly. For a moment, it
 offers relief from the summer heat. Then the chill starts to seep in
 and you feel your body shutting down.

 Through the open freezer door you see a gathering crowd of
 ghoul-children.

>close door

 You close the door. The freezer continues getting colder.

 Accompanied by treble-voiced grunts and squeals of anticipation, small
 fingers claw at the freezer door. Slowly it opens to reveal the
 growing mob of little monsters outside.

>examine door

 The steel door has a spring latch so it can be locked when it is open.
 It is currently open and unlocked.

 A few small, curious heads poke their way into the cold light, gore
 and drool mixing as it drips down their chins. Cautiously, the small
 invaders step into the room and approach you. It's hard to tell if the
 twitching of their half-fleshed faces expresses terror or glee, but
 soon their teeth are on you and your eyes are plucked from their
 sockets. The pain in your head increases as torn fingernails scrape at
 the inside of your skull...


     *** There is no relief. ***


 In that game you scored 3 out of a possible 4, in 346 turns.

 A massive steel door dominates the west end of the kitchen. It is

 A steel key hangs from a chain bolted to the wall.

 A horde of rotting schoolchildren is crowding you in, a few of them
 turning your way, making little kiddie moans of murderous hunger, and
 moving towards the back entrance of the diner.

 You hear the music from the jukebox come to an end.

 You head towards the dining room, but the flood of incoming ghouls
 allows no passage.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Freezer</span>
 Pale fluorescent lights illuminate the room. With the power back on,
 this walk-in freezer is getting cold quite rapidly. For a moment, it
 offers relief from the summer heat. Then the chill starts to seep in
 and you feel your body shutting down.

 Through the open freezer door you see a gathering crowd of
 ghoul-children.

>go east

 You squeeze in amongst the swelling crowd in the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Traces of rust and mysterious stains line the reflective surfaces
 here, but do little to obscure the reflection of your gruesome
 appearance. The kitchen door is east, and there is an employee exit to
 the north.

 A massive steel door dominates the west end of the kitchen. It is
 open.

 A steel key hangs from a chain bolted to the wall.

 A horde of decaying schoolchildren is crowding you in, a few of them
 turning your way, making little kiddie moans of murderous hunger, and
 moving towards the back entrance of the diner.

 You hear the music from the jukebox come to an end.

>go east

 You head towards the dining room, but the flood of incoming ghouls
 allows no passage.

>examine key

 The key to the steel door is chained to a bolt on the wall. There is
 no way to get it off - the chain is made of stronger metal than the
 key itself.

>examine lock

 The steel door has a spring latch so it can be locked when it is open.
 It is currently open and unlocked.

>lock door

 (with the steel key)
 (first taking the steel key)

 You take hold of the key at the end of the chain.

 You lock the freezer door.

>break key

 You stick the key halfway in the lock and push on it with both hands.
 It flexes slightly. You pull it back the other way and the metal
 gives, bending so it'll never fit in the lock. The freezer door is now
 permanently locked.

>in

 As you leave, the chain tugs on the key in your hand. You let go and
 it dangles towards the floor.

 Some of the children watch hungrily as you leave.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Freezer</span>
 Pale fluorescent lights illuminate the room. With the power back on,
 this walk-in freezer is getting cold quite rapidly. For a moment, it
 offers relief from the summer heat. Then the chill starts to seep in
 and you feel your body shutting down.

 Through the open freezer door you see a gathering crowd of
 ghoul-children.

>close door

 You lock yourself in the freezer. It continues getting colder.

>look

 Pale fluorescent lights illuminate the room. With the power back on,
 this walk-in freezer is getting cold quite rapidly. For a moment, it
 offers relief from the summer heat. Then the chill starts to seep in
 and you feel your body shutting down.

>wait

 Time passes.

>wait

 You rest for a while. It's peaceful, but you start to get restless
 eventually. Perhaps there's something you can do to pass the time.

>pray

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">death."</span>

 Praying relaxes you, but it's over too soon.

>pray

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">death."</span>

 Again the prayer is over too soon, and your peace dissolves.

>use rosary

 You'll have to figure out how to use that productively.

>count rosary

 I couldn't identify a verb in that command.

>dance

 You flail around, jumping up and down like a crazy fool. It makes you
 a little dizzy, but your head doesn't hurt any worse for it.

>think
>examine rosary

 You're feeling contemplative.


 The rosary has a loop of five decades, or sets of of ten beads, with a
 single bead separating each decade from the next. A string of four
 more beads hangs from the loop, with a crucifix at the end. Every bead
 represents a prayer. You know how to pray the rosary, and when you
 were alive you used one to calm down. This one appears to be made of
 cavity-riddled teeth hooked together with small pieces of wire.

>pray rosary

 (first taking the rosary)
 You hold the rosary in your hands, counting off beads with your
 fingers. You start with the cross on the end, making the sign of the
 cross and praying the Apostle's Creed. At the first bead you say the
 Lord's Prayer, and then a Hail Mary on each of the next three.

 The chill of the freezer blankets you comfortably, encouraging you to
 continue the prayer.

>pray rosary

 You enter the loop, which contains five strings of ten beads, each
 with a single bead in between. Meditating on the Resurrection, you say
 an Our Father and ten Hail Marys.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Jim's eyes flicker open and fix your gaze. </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Jesus Christ! He's looking right at me! It's him, Peter! I just</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">cut my friend's head of with a fucking hacksaw! What do I do now?"</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em"></span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Bring him along, then." Marie suggests. "We'll have good times."</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em"></span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"No fucking way. I'm sticking him in the fridge."</span>

>pray rosary

 You recite another decade meditating on Christ's ascent into heaven.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Look out, Jack!" Jim shoves you aside and claws swipe the air by</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">your ear. Then he stumbles back as two ghouls rip into his chest.</span>

>pray rosay

 That's not a prayer you know.

>pray rosary

 You contemplate Pentecost, the time when The Holy Spirit descended on
 the apostles in tongues of fire. You say an Our Father and ten more
 Hail Marys.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Peter throws a handful of dirt on the headless body as it begins</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to shrivel in the heat of the bonfire.</span>

>pray rosary

 You say another Our Father and ten Hail Marys meditating on the
 mystery of the Assumption, in which the Blessed Virgin Mary is taken
 up into heaven.

 <span class="floydstyle em">It's got to be around here somewhere. </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">You and Peter search the ground for tracks in the early dawn</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">chill. "You think we'll find it before it reanimates?" </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Maybe not, Jack. There's a lot of places to hide. We might not</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">find Marie's body at all."</span>

>pray rosary

 You complete the last decade of the rosary. The fifth mystery is the
 Coronation of Mary, Queen of Heaven. At the end you pray:

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hail, Holy Queen, mother of mercy,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">our life, our sweetness and our hope.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of tears.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">us,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and after this our exile, show us the blessed fruit of thy womb,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Jesus.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the promises of Christ."</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Amen," Jim says with you. He gets up and scans the ridge ahead.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Then he coughs. "Damn, I'd kill for a cigarette right now." </span>


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trail</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">You and Jim are on a high mountain trail. There's a good view of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the desert in most directions, although you can't see the road</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">anymore. You'd expect it to be quiet out here, even when there were</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">cars that worked. But the quiet here is something else entirely.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">There's no sign of life anywhere.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Jim is walking ahead of you, searching for Peter and Marie.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">You're thinking, "Where'd they go?"</span>

>flex soul

 <span class="floydstyle em">I couldn't identify a verb or a subject you can talk about in that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">command.</span>

>t

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Where'd they go, Jim?"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Jim turns to you reassuringly. "We'll find them, Jack. Don't</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">worry." Then the motherfucker starts singing. </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">    "One of these mornings, and it won't be long </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">    All men will rise and stand side by side </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">    Then hand in hand, we'll walk to glory </span>

>amusing

 Have you tried:

 Telling the nun about the head? When the head is not with you? When it
 is?
 Smelling the walk-in freezer when the power is off?
 Listening to the jukebox when different songs are playing?
 Hitting the jukebox while it's playing?
 Typing "WHAT" instead of entering a command?
 Dancing, singing, laughing, crying, or vomiting?
 Drinking gasoline from the can?
 Examining the gas can when it's improbably stuck inside the skull
 cavity? When the siphon pump is also in the can?
 Putting the gas can into the head while it's full?
 Talking to Peter or Marie about the trailer or the old yellow dog when
 you're at the campfire?
 Talking about the trailer, food, or tonight when Peter's about to blow
 himself up?

 <span class="floydstyle em">You are one of the walking dead. Your name is probably Jack.</span>
