 "Here," says the professor. "These are yours now."

 In your hands, you see the old professor's alphabet case, containing
 the three known letters, and his well-used letter frame. This is the
 day that you've waited years for. Ever since Professor Spruce shocked
 the orthographic community by announcing that there were, somewhere
 out there, 26 (<span class="floydstyle em">twenty-six!</span>) letters in all, you made it your
 goal in life to search them out. You were just a kid then; you could
 never have imagined that Professor Spruce himself would be the one to
 send you on your way.

 "Before you go," Professor Spruce says, "I wonder if you might spell
 one last cup of tea for me."

 An Interactive Fiction by Adam Perry

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Institute of Orthographic Studies</span>
 These halls have been your home for the past several years. It was
 here that you learned how to arrange the known letters into words, to
 recognize the unknown letters, and to introduce them to your alphabet
 case. These skills are sure to come in handy very soon.

 The entrance doors are south of here, through which you can see the
 bustle of the city.

 You can see Professor Spruce here.

>examine professor

 No doubt the good professor would have loved to be the one to fill his
 alphabet case, but the man was always more of an academic. He has
 always been an inspiration to you, even now that his age is catching
 up to him.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   your alphabet case (A, E, and T)
   a three-letter frame

>examine frame

 This frame has exactly the right number of slots for you to spell
 three-letter words.

>examine case

 Your alphabet case holds your collection of letters. Currently, it has
 the letters A, E, and T.

>spell eat

 You don't need the alphabet's help to eat, and if you don't have
 something to eat, then this isn't the word you're looking for.


 It's not clear what you ate, but you feel quite satisfied now.

>spell eta

 The image of an "H" shimmers briefly in the air, but you can't use a
 Greek letter, even if it does resemble an English one.


>Spell Tea

 You deftly arrange the letters in the frame, just like you've
 practiced a thousand times. You produce a cup of bergamot, the
 professor's favorite.

 Between sips, the professor begins reminiscing. "You know, I've been
 studying the alphabet for most of a lifetime now. I always knew I
 wouldn't be the one to hunt down the unknown letters -- I'm not much
 for traveling, as you know. So I've kept my eyes open for the one who
 would fulfill my ambition. In all these years, I have only met a
 handful of people that showed the passion and aptitude for spelling
 that would be required for such a venture."

 Professor Spruce takes a final swill of his teacup and looks you
 square in the eyes. "You should know that this is not our first
 attempt at an expedition to Phoenicia. There was one other, a
 colleague of mine, that we were preparing to send. The expedition
 ended in failure before it could even begin. No orthographer has ever
 set foot in Phoenicia." He takes a look at you before continuing. "I
 don't mean to alarm you. I only want you to understand the
 significance of your journey. You know as well as I do the importance
 and power of the alphabet. The Institute exists to ensure that the
 alphabet is used responsibly, and -- well, I'm preaching to the choir,
 aren't I? I wish you the best of luck on your voyage. We are all
 counting on you to return with the complete alphabet."

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   your alphabet case (A, E, and T)
   a three-letter frame

>about

 Equipped with a three-letter frame and a case of your collected
 letters (currently A, E, and T), you are on a quest to find all 26.

 Your primary method of interacting with the world is by spelling
 words. If you have A, C, and T, for example, you could try the command
 <span class="floydstyle i">SPELL CAT</span>. If you're stuck, try spelling all the words you can
 in as many places as possible. While you can bring your journey to an
 abrupt end with a few ill-advised actions (in which case you can
 simply <span class="floydstyle i">UNDO</span>), you can never find yourself in a situation where
 it's impossible to win, so experiment! Many of the game's puzzles have
 multiple solutions.

 If this is your first time playing a game like this, type <span class="floydstyle i">HELP</span>
 for some tips on how to get around and a few useful commands. If you
 find yourself stumped, you can try the <span class="floydstyle i">HINT</span> command.

>sing

>xyzzy

>ask professor about expedition

 The old professor says, "You have a long journey ahead of you, and
 there's nothing more I can teach you."

 there's nothing more I can teach you."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aleph City</span>
 Today may be the most important day of your life, but for the rest of
 Aleph City, it's Tuesday. The streets are busy as ever, and you see a
 few familiar faces among the hustle and bustle. None of that matters
 to you. You have a mission.

 The Institute of Orthographic Studies is north of here, and far to the
 east is the wilderness of Phoenicia, theorized by Professor Spruce to
 contain the unknown letters.

>look at crowd

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Edge of Phoenicia</span>
 All of Phoenicia lies before you, ready for you to explore. You're not
 the first to explore Phoenicia -- that honor goes to Jerome Phoenix,
 for whom the region is named -- but you are the first orthographer to
 come here in search of the alphabet.

 This particular area is a little bare, though. Undoubtedly, there's
 something more interesting to the northeast, east, and southeast.
 Aleph City is far away to the west.

 The ground shakes a little beneath your feet.

>examine ground

 There's very little I can tell you about the ground that won't come
 across as incredibly patronizing.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 You find yourself in a grassy clearing. The landscape is thoroughly
 unremarkable here, but you can see the edge of Phoenicia Forest to the
 south, Lake Phoenicia to the east, and a large brick structure to the
 north. To your west is the area where you first set foot here.

 The ground shakes a little beneath your feet.

>search for letters

 You can't see any such thing.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lake Phoenicia</span>
 You stand at the bank of Lake Phoenicia. It's certainly not as
 majestic as you might have hoped: the water is a dank brown and the
 whole thing smells vaguely swampy. The lake is certainly vast, though:
 the only way forward from here is back to the west where you came
 from.

 A log floats in the water nearby.

 The letter C -- one of the unknown letters -- floats in the water a
 little ways from the shore.

>get c

 Hold on -- that log is a crocodile!

>examine c

 You'd have to get a little wet in the process, but otherwise only the
 crocodile is stopping you from taking the letter C.

>spell eat

 You don't need the alphabet's help to eat, and if you don't have
 something to eat, then this isn't the word you're looking for.

>eat crocodile

 That's plainly inedible.

>examine croc

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine crocodile

 The crocodile lies in wait, looking very much like a log. Only on
 careful inspection do you notice that the crocodile is very much
 alert.

>tickle crocodile

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>touch crocodile

 The crocodile might not like that.

>spell tea

 You enjoy a cup of oolong.

>spell log

 You don't have the necessary letters to spell "log."

>spell tae

 We could debate whether Scottish mutations of English words are
 appropriate in the context of this game, but it's not like "tae" would
 be helpful either way.


>spell aet

 "aet" isn't a word. Don't you know the dangers of reckless alphabet
 usage?

  (If you're stuck, you can type <span class="floydstyle i">HINT</span> for help.)

>spell ate

 It's not clear what you ate, but you feel quite satisfied now.

>take crocodile.

 I don't suppose the crocodile would care for that.

>shout

 The crocodile has nothing to say.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 You find yourself in a grassy clearing. The landscape is thoroughly
 unremarkable here, but you can see the edge of Phoenicia Forest to the
 south, Lake Phoenicia to the east, and a large brick structure to the
 north. To your west is the area where you first set foot here.

 The ground shakes a little beneath your feet.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Phoenicia Forest</span>
 The trees are sufficiently sparse to allow grass to grow in this area,
 but there are still enough of them to consider this part of the
 forest. The forest continues to the southeast. You can also head north
 or northwest from here.

 An elephant is relaxing here.

>examine elephant

 A large, gray pachyderm with floppy ears, ivory tusks, and a long,
 prehensile trunk. You're no zoologist, but it seems like any other
 elephant, really.

>climb elephant

 You've never been much of a climber, and the elephant isn't really
 made for climbing.

>climb tree

 You spend a few minutes climbing to the top of a tree, which affords
 you a marginally nicer vantage point of the area you were already able
 to see. At least you had fun.

>pet elephant

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>elephant, hello

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Within Phoenicia Forest</span>
 The trees are incredibly dense in this area, and there's no trail to
 follow. Were it not for your innate talent at recognizing cardinal
 directions, you could easily get lost in here.

 To the northwest and northeast, the forest begins to thin out. You see
 a small tunnel leading underground to the south.

>go south

 You wriggle and crawl through the cramped tunnel. Whatever's on the
 other side had better be worth it and not, like, a giant fleshworm or
 something.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kobold Warren</span>
 Oh, great. It's a hole full of rat-dragons. This was so <span class="floydstyle em">not</span>
 worth it. To make matters worse, this place isn't quite tall enough to
 stand in, so you're hunched over just a bit. This is giving you a
 neckache.  But wait -- the letter G is here. One of the unknown
 letters!

 A large fire lights the room from the western wall, and to the side is
 a large pile of sticks. The tunnel leading to the surface is to the
 north.

 The kobolds are huddled around the letter G on the southern edge of
 this little hole.

 The letter G -- one of the unknown letters -- sits unguarded at the
 south end of the warren.

>get g

 You edge closer to the south end of the warren where the kobolds are
 congregated, and they begin to notice you. A chorus of hisses makes
 its way through the crowd, then the kobolds begin to bark at you.

 "The human can't have our treasure!"

 "The human wasn't invited here!"

 "The human came in without knocking!"

 "We don't have a door, dummy!"

 "How did the human get in here if we don't have a door?"

 "The human must be a wizard!"

 And then the voices become muddled as the kobolds talk amongst
 themselves. After several seconds, they all quiet down at once. One of
 them calls out, "Show us your magic, wizard!" The other kobolds roar
 in approval.

>spell tea

 You enjoy a cup of peppermint tea.

 The kobolds seem puzzled. Clearly, your remarkable mastery of the
 alphabet was not "magical" enough.

>spell gate

 You don't have a four-letter frame, so you can't spell "gate."

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   your alphabet case (A, E, and T)
   a three-letter frame

>spell get

 You don't have the necessary letters to spell "get."

>spell eat

 You don't need the alphabet's help to eat, and if you don't have
 something to eat, then this isn't the word you're looking for.

 The kobolds seem puzzled. Clearly, your remarkable mastery of the
 alphabet was not "magical" enough.

 us your magic, wizard!"

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern Phoenicia Forest</span>
 The trees clear out on the east to reveal a precipice overlooking a
 beautiful rainbow. Far below, you see a waterfall flowing from a gap
 in the cliff wall that turns into a winding river. There is an
 outcropping nearby on which lies the letter S -- one of the unknown
 letters!

 You can return to the denser area of the forest to your southwest, or
 you can follow the cliff edge to the north.

 The letter S sits on the outcropping.

>get s

 As you approach the outcropping, a small man dressed in green hops up
 from the other side and snatches the letter! You're torn between being
 annoyed and wondering how long he was hanging there.

>examine man

 A small man with curly red hair and an outfit of dark green holds the
 letter S. He dances manically, hopping to and fro as if he weighed
 nothing.

>talk to man

 The leprechaun responds by blowing a raspberry and laughing
 derisively.

 You enjoy a cup of green tea.

 outcropping nearby, which is bare now that the leprechaun has taken
 the letter S.

 You can return to the denser area of the forest to your southwest, or
 you can follow the cliff edge to the north.

 A sprightly leprechaun dances around you waving the letter S.

 The sight of the leprechaun fills you with annoyance.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Wall</span>
 The forest gives way to reveal a lofty brick structure. There is a
 large archway facing you, through which you could access the interior
 were it not for a massive hole underneath. No, wait, holes can't be
 massive -- that doesn't make sense. Let's just call it a big hole.

 The path ends here: any further north and you'll have left Phoenicia,
 and the cliff is still to your east. You'll have to head back south.

 You'd get stuck. Isn't that the pits?

 Besides the ruins to the east, you can travel southwest to where you

 In your hands, you see the old professor's alphabet case, containing
 the three known letters, and his well-used letter frame. This is the
 day that you've waited years for. Ever since Professor Spruce shocked
 the orthographic community by announcing that there were, somewhere
 out there, 26 (<span class="floydstyle em">twenty-six!</span>) letters in all, you made it your
 goal in life to search them out. You were just a kid then; you could
 never have imagined that Professor Spruce himself would be the one to
 send you on your way.

 "Before you go," Professor Spruce says, "I wonder if you might spell

 Professor Spruce takes a final swill of his teacup and looks you
 square in the eyes. "You should know that this is not our first
 attempt at an expedition to Phoenicia. There was one other, a
 colleague of mine, that we were preparing to send. The expedition
 ended in failure before it could even begin. No orthographer has ever
 set foot in Phoenicia." He takes a look at you before continuing. "I
 don't mean to alarm you. I only want you to understand the
 significance of your journey. You know as well as I do the importance
 and power of the alphabet. The Institute exists to ensure that the
 alphabet is used responsibly, and -- well, I'm preaching to the choir,
 aren't I? I wish you the best of luck on your voyage. We are all
 counting on you to return with the complete alphabet."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Institute of Orthographic Studies</span>
 These halls have been your home for the past several years. It was
 here that you learned how to arrange the known letters into words, to
 recognize the unknown letters, and to introduce them to your alphabet
 case. These skills are sure to come in handy very soon.

 The entrance doors are south of here, through which you can see the
 bustle of the city.

 You can see Professor Spruce here.

>examine spruce

 No doubt the good professor would have loved to be the one to fill his
 alphabet case, but the man was always more of an academic. He has
 always been an inspiration to you, even now that his age is catching
 up to him.

>ask spruce about phoenica

 The old professor says, "You have a long journey ahead of you, and
 there's nothing more I can teach you."

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aleph City</span>
 Today may be the most important day of your life, but for the rest of
 Aleph City, it's Tuesday. The streets are busy as ever, and you see a
 few familiar faces among the hustle and bustle. None of that matters
 to you. You have a mission.

 The Institute of Orthographic Studies is north of here, and far to the
 east is the wilderness of Phoenicia, theorized by Professor Spruce to
 contain the unknown letters.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Edge of Phoenicia</span>
 All of Phoenicia lies before you, ready for you to explore. You're not
 the first to explore Phoenicia -- that honor goes to Jerome Phoenix,
 for whom the region is named -- but you are the first orthographer to
 come here in search of the alphabet.

 This particular area is a little bare, though. Undoubtedly, there's
 something more interesting to the northeast, east, and southeast.
 Aleph City is far away to the west.

 The ground shakes a little beneath your feet.

>examine ground

 There's very little I can tell you about the ground that won't come
 across as incredibly patronizing.

 The ground shakes a little beneath your feet.

>dig

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>listen to ground

 You hear nothing unexpected.

 The ground shakes a little beneath your feet.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Wall</span>
 This clearing is notable for the great wall that occupies its eastern
 edge, where an archway connects this clearing to the Phoenician ruins
 that lie beyond. Oh, and there is an enormous cyclops moping
 listlessly here, which is probably worth mentioning.

 Besides the ruins to the east, you can travel southwest to where you
 first arrived or south to a more open area.

 The cyclops occupies the entire archway and then some.

 The ground shakes as the cyclops's stomach roars.

>take i

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cyclops

 Easily twice and probably three times your height, this is one of the
 one-eyed giants known as cyclopes. They're not as stupid or mean as
 ogres or trolls, although it's common for a cyclops to have trouble
 concentrating on more than one thing at a time. This one is just
 sitting there looking despondent, probably on account of his empty
 stomach that's been causing these minor earthquakes.

 The ground shakes as the cyclops's stomach roars.

>talk to cyclops

 The forlorn cyclops fixes his eye on you. "No talk," he says.
 "Huuungry."

 The ground shakes as the cyclops's stomach roars.

>spell tea

 You enjoy a cup of green tea.

 The ground shakes as the cyclops's stomach roars.

>give tea to cyclops

 You can't see any such thing.

>spell eat

 The cyclops looks around for something to eat, but he only finds one
 thing that might possibly be edible.

 Years of orthographic training should have driven home the correct way
 to use the known letters for satiation, but hey, we all make mistakes.

 The ground shakes one last time as the cyclops delivers a thundering

 collapses in a deep sleep, but not before moving just enough to allow
 passage into the ruins.

 The cyclops snores loudly.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

 The ruins are in remarkably good shape given their age. The vines

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Entrance to Phoenician Ruins</span>
 The air is stale, and the walls are netted with cobwebs, but
 otherwise, these ruins are in marvelous condition. You're here for
 orthography, though, not archaeology, so your eyes are immediately
 drawn to the wall mural that clearly depicts the letter R -- one of
 the unknown letters! If you take it from the wall, you can add it to
 your alphabet case.

 The archway to the west leads back outside, and a staircase leads down
 into the dark subterrain of the ruins.

 The letter R is yours for the taking.

>take r

 You insert R into your alphabet case, adding its power to the three
 letters you already possess.

 You can now spell words that contain the letter R.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>spell treat

 You can't spell "treat," since your alphabet case has only one of each
 letter.

>spell rat

 A rodent of modest size appears out of thin air. After getting its

>spell ear

 You produce a third ear, square on your forehead. It's unsightly and
 it feels really weird, so you send it back with a poof.

 The archway to the west leads back outside, and a staircase leads down

 "at" is too short; you have to completely fill a letter frame in order

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lake Phoenicia</span>
 You stand at the bank of Lake Phoenicia. It's certainly not as
 majestic as you might have hoped: the water is a dank brown and the
 whole thing smells vaguely swampy. The lake is certainly vast, though:
 the only way forward from here is back to the west where you came
 from.

 A log floats in the water nearby.

 The letter C -- one of the unknown letters -- floats in the water a
 little ways from the shore.

>take c

 Hold on -- that log is a crocodile!

>spell tar

 Better not. Your hands and pockets would get sticky -- it'd be a real

>examine crocodile

 The crocodile lies in wait, looking very much like a log. Only on
 careful inspection do you notice that the crocodile is very much
 alert.

>spell ate

 It's not clear what you ate, but you feel quite satisfied now.

>spell eat

 You don't need the alphabet's help to eat, and if you don't have
 something to eat, then this isn't the word you're looking for.

 A crocodile is in the water nearby, keeping intruders away.

 The letter C -- one of the unknown letters -- floats in the water a

>swim

 You remove your shoes and socks and wade into the water a little,
 keeping an eye on the crocodile. It doesn't move, so you hesitantly
 edge towards the letter C. As you reach for it, the crocodile springs
 into action, moving more freely in the water than you could hope to.
 It turns out to be a better aquatic combatant than you, too.

 An elephant is relaxing here.

>examine elephant

 A large, gray pachyderm with floppy ears, ivory tusks, and a long,
 prehensile trunk. You're no zoologist, but it seems like any other
 elephant, really.

>ride elephant

 I don't think the elephant would let you do that.

>pet elephant

 A crocodile is swimming through the lake far from here. It seems to be

 The letter C -- one of the unknown letters -- floats in the water a
 little ways from the shore.

>take c

 You remove your shoes and socks and wade into the water. With the

 You can now spell words that contain the letter C.

 A card (the ace of diamonds) appears in your hand. It would bend in
 your pockets, so you send it back with a poof. Nice trick, though.

>spell act

 You put on a small play, using your hands as puppets. The crocodile is
 unamused.

>spell arc

 The image of a curve shimmers briefly in the air.


>spell car

 You produce a shiny red Ferrari. It's impressive, but the automobile
 won't be invented for quite some time still, so you have no clue how
 to operate it. You send it back with a poof.

 You enjoy a little recreation. Happy now?

 To the northwest and northeast, the forest begins to thin out. You see
 a small tunnel leading underground to the south.

>examine tunnel

 You can't see any such thing.

 You wriggle and crawl through the cramped tunnel. Whatever's on the

 something.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kobold Warren</span>
 Oh, great. It's a hole full of rat-dragons. This was so <span class="floydstyle em">not</span>

 neckache.  But wait -- the letter G is here. One of the unknown
 letters!

 A large fire lights the room from the western wall, and to the side is
 a large pile of sticks. The tunnel leading to the surface is to the

 The kobolds are huddled around the letter G on the southern edge of

 The letter G -- one of the unknown letters -- sits unguarded at the

 Well, in this case, it's a forgery, and it's too big to carry around,
 so you send it back with a poof.

 The stick as it stands would burn out quickly. If you want a light

 You don't have the necessary letters to spell "oil."

>examine kobolds

 Kobolds are to dragons what chihuahuas are to golden retrievers,
 except that some people find chihuahuas endearing. The kobolds are
 gathered around the letter G, ignoring you.

>examine fire

 The fire suggests some method of exhaust, since the warren isn't
 filled with smoke, but you didn't notice anything above ground. This
 makes you a little curious, but not curious enough to attempt a
 conversation with the kobolds.

 outcropping nearby on which lies the letter S -- one of the unknown
 letters!

 You can return to the denser area of the forest to your southwest, or
 you can follow the cliff edge to the north.

 The letter S sits on the outcropping.

>take s

 As you approach the outcropping, a small man dressed in green hops up
 from the other side and snatches the letter! You're torn between being
 annoyed and wondering how long he was hanging there.

>examine man

 A small man with curly red hair and an outfit of dark green holds the
 letter S. He dances manically, hopping to and fro as if he weighed
 nothing.

>talk to man

 The leprechaun responds by blowing a raspberry and laughing
 derisively.

 The path ends here: any further north and you'll have left Phoenicia,
 and the cliff is still to your east. You'll have to head back south.

>spell tar

 Better not. Your hands and pockets would get sticky -- it'd be a real

 The hole is large and deep, and the edges are sheer enough to make it

 Conveniently, you're already in an era of some sort, so this word has

 The leprechaun is dispirited at the loss of his treasure. He trudges

 entertained, though, since this might as well be magic to them.

>take g

 Now that the kobolds are enthralled by your, ahem,
 <span class="floydstyle em">performance</span>, you have no trouble budging through to the
 letter G. You insert G into your alphabet case, adding its power to
 the six letters you already possess.

 You can now spell words that contain the letter G.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>spell gas

 Hmm. That didn't do anything obvious, but you can smell something in
 the air now.

>spell gas

 Hmm. That didn't do anything obvious, but you can smell something in

>spell sag

 You feel your cheeks droop a bit.


>spell tag

 You tag the kobolds.

>spell rag

 You produce dirty scrap of cloth. Good for you?

>spell gat

 Kudos for thinking outside the box, but at no point will you need to
 use a word that obscure.


  (If you're stuck, you can type <span class="floydstyle i">HINT</span> for help.)



>tie rag to stick

 You wrap the rag tightly around the stick. If you soaked it in
 something more flammable, then it would make a good torch.

>spell tar

 Better not. Your hands and pockets would get sticky -- it'd be a real
 mess.

>spell art

 You produce a copy of the Creation of Adam. It's good, but is it art?

 Well, in this case, it's a forgery, and it's too big to carry around,
 so you send it back with a poof.

>spell sec

 You wait for a second, but nothing happens.


>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Within Phoenicia Forest</span>
 The trees are incredibly dense in this area, and there's no trail to
 follow. Were it not for your innate talent at recognizing cardinal
 directions, you could easily get lost in here.

 To the northwest and northeast, the forest begins to thin out. You see
 a small tunnel leading underground to the south.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern Phoenicia Forest</span>
 The trees clear out on the east to reveal a precipice overlooking a
 beautiful rainbow. Far below, you see a waterfall flowing from a gap
 in the cliff wall that turns into a winding river. There is an
 outcropping nearby where you found the letter S.

 You can return to the denser area of the forest to your southwest, or
 you can follow the cliff edge to the north.

>examine tar

 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a stick
     a rag
   your alphabet case (A, C, E, G, R, S, and T)

>spell car

 You produce a shiny red Ferrari. It's impressive, but the automobile
 won't be invented for quite some time still, so you have no clue how
 to operate it. You send it back with a poof.

>spell age

 You feel nominally older now.

>spell gar

 A needlefish appears out of thin air. You have no need for it at the
 moment and it would be cumbersome to carry around, so you send it back
 with a poof.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Within Phoenicia Forest</span>
 The trees are incredibly dense in this area, and there's no trail to

 directions, you could easily get lost in here.

 To the northwest and northeast, the forest begins to thin out. You see
 a small tunnel leading underground to the south.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Phoenicia Forest</span>
 The trees are sufficiently sparse to allow grass to grow in this area,
 but there are still enough of them to consider this part of the
 forest. The forest continues to the southeast. You can also head north
 or northwest from here.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 You find yourself in a grassy clearing. The landscape is thoroughly
 unremarkable here, but you can see the edge of Phoenicia Forest to the
 south, Lake Phoenicia to the east, and a large brick structure to the
 north. To your west is the area where you first set foot here.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lake Phoenicia</span>
 You stand at the bank of Lake Phoenicia. It's certainly not as
 majestic as you might have hoped: the water is a dank brown and the
 whole thing smells vaguely swampy. The lake is certainly vast, though:
 the only way forward from here is back to the west where you came
 from.

 The elephant has taken up residence in the lake.

 A crocodile is swimming through the lake far from here. It seems to be
 keeping its distance from the elephant.

>spell gar

 You produce a needlefish, which splashes into the lake and swims off.
 It wants nothing to do with the crocodile or elephant, nor they with
 it.


 You produce another rat, startling the elephant once again. The
 elephant trumpets loudly and, seeing no other exit, storms off to the
 west.

 Hey, that's where you were standing, wasn't it? Oops!

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Wall</span>
 The forest gives way to reveal a lofty brick structure. There is a
 large archway facing you, through which you could access the interior
 were it not for a large hole underneath.

 The path ends here: any further north and you'll have left Phoenicia,
 and the cliff is still to your east. You'll have to head back south.

>spell art

 You produce a copy of Persistence of Memory. It's good, but is it art?

 Well, in this case, it's a forgery, and it's too big to carry around,
 so you send it back with a poof.

>take hole

 That's hardly portable.

>go down

 Whether you meant down the hole or down the cliff, you'd have a hard
 time getting back up.

>examine wall

 The ruins are in remarkably good shape given their age. The vines
 crawling up the bricks of the outer walls are the biggest indication
 that the ruins have been long abandoned.

>spell sac

 You produce an anal sac. It's really gross and not obviously useful,
 so you send it back with a poof and a grimace.


>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kobold Warren</span>
 You're back in the kobold warren, despite your preference to be almost
 literally anywhere else. As always, this place isn't quite tall enough
 to stand in, so you're hunched over just a bit. This is giving you a
 neckache.

 A large fire lights the room from the western wall, and to the side is
 a large pile of sticks. The tunnel leading to the surface is to the
 north.

 As the kobolds notice you enter, they gather around you once again.

>light torch

 The rag needs to be more flammable before this will work as a torch.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a stick
     a rag
   your alphabet case (A, C, E, G, R, S, and T)
   a three-letter frame

>take stick

 You already snagged one. It's probably best to limit the amount you
 steal from the kobolds.

>spell set

 Unbelievable! You've produced a complete set of those wooden soldiers
 that your parents would never buy for you. These are worth a fortune
 nowadays. You have no use for them at the moment, of course, so you
 send them back with a poof and make a mental note to make another set
 once you get back to Aleph City.


>spell etc

 "etc" isn't a word. Don't you know the dangers of reckless alphabet
 usage?


>spell arg

 "arg" isn't a word. Don't you know the dangers of reckless alphabet
 usage?


>spell get

 You could, you know, just take whatever you're after. This is one word
 that you don't need to spell.


>spell reg

 You reminisce on the Institute's "Regulations for Proper Alphabet
 Use."

 Rule #2: No one shall engage in spelling while intoxicated.

  (If you're stuck, you can type <span class="floydstyle i">HINT</span> for help.)

>spell erg

 Reaching deep to the bottom of our vocabulary barrel, are we? Obscure
 words aren't required to win.





>spell ret

 That word isn't especially helpful unless you're playing a certain
 board game.

 You're not.





>hint

 Try <span class="floydstyle i">HINT TOPIC</span> for hints on a specific topic. For example, if
 you're having trouble slaying the dragon, try <span class="floydstyle i">HINT DRAGON</span>.

>hint torch

 A torch is more than just a stick. Before you can light it, you need
 to put an accelerant onto some kind of absorbent material -- such as
 cloth -- and wrap it around one end. Try <span class="floydstyle i">HINT ACCELERANT</span> or
 <span class="floydstyle i">HINT CLOTH</span> if you're still stuck.

 You'll also need a source of fire to get it going. You've seen one
 somewhere already.

>hint accelerant

 An accelerant is a highly flammable substance, like lighter fluid.
 There's something matching this description that you can spell.

>hint tar

 You're already off to a good start!

>hint cloth

 The cloth for your torch doesn't need to be in good shape.

>hint cloth

 The cloth for your torch doesn't need to be in good shape.

 You produce a cloud of gasoline and soak the stick in it. Just add
 fire and you've got a light source.

>put stick in fire

 Before the torch even touches the dancing flames, the fumes ignite and
 the torch bursts into life. Congratulations: you've got a light.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 You find yourself in a grassy clearing. The landscape is thoroughly

 south, Lake Phoenicia to the east, and a large brick structure to the
 north. To your west is the area where you first set foot here.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Wall</span>
 This clearing is notable for the great wall that occupies its eastern
 edge, where an archway connects this clearing to the Phoenician ruins
 that lie beyond.

 Besides the ruins to the east, you can travel southwest to where you
 first arrived or south to a more open area.

 The cyclops is sleeping just to the side of the archway.

 The cyclops snores loudly.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Entrance to Phoenician Ruins</span>
 The air is stale, and the walls are netted with cobwebs, but
 otherwise, these ruins are in marvelous condition. You're here for
 orthography, though, not archaeology, so you're unequipped to fully
 appreciate this.

 The archway to the west leads back outside, and a staircase leads down
 into the dark subterrain of the ruins.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Ruins Underground</span>
 The light of your torch dances on the walls of the walls of the
 Phoenician underground. To step down into these ruins is to step into
 history itself.

 The stairs lead up to the surface, and this corridor continues to the
 east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Ruins Corridor</span>
 The air down here is dry. From your admittedly limited exposure to
 spelunking, you had expected humid air and the occasional drip, but
 the Phoenician architecture holds watertight after all these years.

 The corridor continues to the west and east.

 The letter O hangs on a mural on the stone wall.

>take o

 You begin to approach the mural when your ears perk up. What was that
 noise? You stand still and listen. Footsteps, coming from the other
 direction.

 To the east, another light approaches. You strain to see a human woman
 who appears just as surprised to see you. You are considerably more
 surprised, however, when you notice what she's carrying: an alphabet
 case and a letter frame. An orthographer? But you're the only one the
 Institute authorized to explore Phoenicia!

 Dumbfounded as you are, you have no time to react as the woman
 arranges letters into her frame. The first two letters are unfamiliar,
 and you can barely see her slide T into the last slot when a gaping
 hole opens beneath you, dropping you into...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pit</span>
 Your landing was hardly comfortable, but you have only scrapes and
 bruises to show for it. The real problem is that the walls of the pit
 offer no means of purchase. Fortunately, you've retained your
 possessions, and you even managed to avoid burning yourself with the
 torch. All told, you're in great shape aside from being in this pit.

 The overall look of this hole brings to mind the one that you saw in
 the eastern ruins entrance. It occurs to you that your rival
 orthographer was probably responsible for that as well, meaning she's
 had more time than you to explore the ruins. Judging from the word she
 spelled, your new friend has at least two of the unknown letters. This
 is a serious problem: you're going to need those letters. You'd better
 be on your toes next time the two of you meet.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a torch (providing light)
   your alphabet case (A, C, E, G, R, S, and T)
   a three-letter frame

>spell sea

 You inhale sharply, hold your breath, and arrange the letters. You are
 slammed to the ground by a crushing load of water, and it's all you
 can do to keep your breath from being knocked out of you. Suddenly,
 you question the wisdom of this course of action. The torch has been
 extinguished and your possessions have been scattered. The wet torch
 is easy enough to find, but you spend precious seconds groping the
 floor for the case and frame. Seizing them, you swim as quickly as you
 can in the direction of the only light you can now see. Your breath
 gives out before you make it there, and just as you inhale a lungful
 of sea water, it occurs to you to dismiss the sea, sending it back
 with a poof.

 You cough and strain for air, but as you do, you hear a distant howl
 echoing through the tunnels. As you gather your things and head back
 to the surface, a grin reaches your lips. Somewhere deep in the
 catacombs below, the woman who tried to thwart your mission is
 fumbling around in the darkness. Being dropped in a pit was unpleasant
 for you, and having to rekindle your torch is a little inconvenient,
 but you have dealt her a major setback. After making sure your
 alphabet case survived the ordeal and returning to the kobold warren
 to relight your torch, you're ready to go.

 spelunking, you had expected humid air and the occasional drip, but
 the Phoenician architecture holds watertight after all these years.

 The corridor continues to the west and east. There's also a gaping
 hole in the ground here which you have no desire to revisit.

 The mural on the wall is unsurprisingly bare. Your new acquaintance
 has taken its letter.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Grand Staircase</span>
 The relatively tight corridor makes way here to a cavernous stairway
 that descends south into abyssal darkness. The dust and cobwebs fail
 to conceal the majesty of the stonework. You can't help but be
 awestruck.

 The north wall is decorated by a mural bare of any letter. The other
 orthographer came from this direction; she must have taken this
 mural's letter.

 Besides the staircase, you can go east and west from here.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Ruins Corridor</span>
 The corridor once again narrows to the east of the staircase. The
 corridor seems to be east-west symmetric about the staircase: a mural
 (once again bare) adorns the north wall again, and far to the east,
 you see a glimmer of sunlight.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Ruins Underground</span>
 As you'd expected, a staircase here ascends into daylight. The

 of this corridor.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Entrance to Phoenician Ruins</span>
 You find yourself on the other side of the large hole that you
 discovered earlier. There is a mural on the wall here, too,
 unsurprisingly bereft of its letter. No prizes for guessing what
 happened here.

 With the large hole effectively blocking the archway, your only option
 is to head back down into the ruins.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Underground City of Phoenicia</span>
 As you descend the gigantic staircase, your jaw drops. And it keeps
 dropping.

 The ceiling is no longer visible with the light from your torch.
 Through its inadequate glow, great structures rise to meet you. An
 entire city is down here.

 The heart of the underground city is south of here, and the staircase
 rises to the north.

 On the polished stone ahead is a four-letter frame, covered with the
 same centuries of dust as everything else.

>take frame

 (the four-letter frame)
 Your hands tremble in anticipation as you pick up the four-letter
 frame. You blow the dust off of it and polish it with your sleeve.
 Hundreds of years ago, a real, living Phoenician spelled words with
 this, using all twenty-six letters of the alphabet. Now, that power is
 yours.

 You can now spell four-letter words.

 arranging letters from the alphabet case into a letter frame). Certain

 You listen to the rest of Pop's lecture.

 "Son, these are pretty straightforward points, but you're flaking out,
 here. It's late at night, so I'll let it slide."

 "Look, it's up to you. I'll leave this spreadsheet right here. Short
 story: you're number one. Drotz's got the honors art course. And
 you're gonna slip to #2 without that independent study course. If
 you're too good for your father, maybe you're not too good for the
 hard work he put in."

 He hands you the spreadsheet. It looks sort of boring, but then again,
 you are a bit behind on your sleep. It helps you catch up.

 You know Pop probably would be pretty cross if he caught you wandering
 around so late, so you decide to call it a night. Pop drops you off
 the next day at Grubbyville High School, in the entry hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entry Hall</span>
 What a way to start the day. You've been through the Entry Hall
 countless times before, but never in the middle of summer. The Help
 Hole to the north is blocked off--tutoring during the school year--and
 the hall continues west to by the teachers' lounge.

 Of course, you can always chicken out back east. That'd make everyone
 except Pop happy.

 VERBS will tell you verbs used in the game, and THINK will give you an
 idea of what to do and where to go.

 It's got a comparison of your grades to Drotz's, a brief explanation
 of how Grubbyville awards GPA, and a listing of teachers and
 administrators with whom Pop has discussed your newfound interest in
 the study of art.

 The math still makes sense. Harley's got an extra 4.5, which lowers
 his average from 4.6, but if you slip and get an A-, it's like he's
 got an extra 4.8.

 You think about it. You almost can. It would be so easy, except it
 isn't. (Note: you really will leave if you try again.)

>go east


 You leave Grubbyville behind. Pop asks why you came back empty-handed,
 and you come up with a mishmosh of moral misgivings and, well, if
 other kids found out it might be hard for you. Pop tells you he's
 heard Harley isn't as popular as he pretends to be, and you just blew
 a chance...well. You'll learn.

 That June as Harley steps up to give his valedictorian speech, Pop
 looks at you pointedly to applaud. You two almost have a contest, who
 can applaud louder. After, some people congratulate you on your
 sportsmanship before segueing into complaining what a fake Harley is.
 It's not much consolation.

 others, including CASINO FUN by NO FUN CASEY.

 It has with formulas for the probability of turning $50 into $100
 playing craps, and if you play, you either go broke tonight or get
 hooked on gambling and go really broke ten years from now. The game
 will note playing it saved you three hours you would've wasted rolling
 dice and a headache from the noise, and it also lets the user see the
 formula used so it didn't have to bother actually simulating all those

 launches into turf wars between the math and chess teams, and how
 people who are on both are extra annoying. You nod in agreement. He
 seems almost surprised.

 "Man. I didn't know we were bummed by the same stuff. But you asked me
 what I'm doing here. What are YOU doing here?"

 After you explain, Dennis continues, "Well, enemy's enemy stuff, I
 guess. Still can't forgive Harley for, um...look, I have something
 that can help you. I wrote some really satirical protest poetry or
 something but if I submitted it to the school art magazine, they'd say
 I was just some bitter dork. You'd give it gravitas and stuff. What do
 you say? I just want to get the message out." (yes or no)
>yes


 You take a closer look at Dennis's note. It's a lot more coherent and
 funny than you'd imagined. You're almost...jealous. You find yourself
 riffing on it--like you're not totally happy with Grubbyville. You
 wonder how serious he is about not really wanting any credit. Maybe
 he'll backstab you later. I mean, If you can think ten moves ahead in
 chess, what else can you plan?

 But with this writing, you feel like you should be able to shmooze.

 Leaving the Chess Hovel behind, you feel like this grades thing is
 just business. You're not finding some huge tax loophole. Harley
 started it. Someone will find a new loophole next year.

 It was love at first sight. You weren't permitted even to see them
 until you passed the trials: rappelling down the east tower, slipping
 through the gap in the patrols, and then picking the counting house
 lock. When you returned triumphantly, your new friends toasted and
 praised and paraded you around the hall. You were happiest, though,
 when the master--- now just another respected colleague--- solemnly
 handed your set of lockpicks, shining darkly in the guild hall. For a
 while, it was perfect.

 And then it all went wrong.

 First-time players should type ABOUT.

 Mistakes were made. Plans were exposed. People were compromised. The
 job was ambitious but reasonable for a crew as skilled as Big Sally's,
 and you're certain your scheme would have been successful. The
 authorities couldn't prove anything, but the damage was done. With the
 town watch constantly looking over your shoulder, the Thieves' Guild
 gently suggested you look elsewhere. It was over.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Antechamber</span>
 Before it became the seat of local government, this castle was an
 actively defended fortress, built and run to protect the town of
 Blackacre. It was designed for defense rather than comfort, and the
 castle still retains its original vertiginous spiral staircases,
 cavernous galleries, and piles of crumbling stonework. Nevertheless,
 people expect a certain reassuring level of conspicuous wealth in
 their public buildings, and the town council has obligingly added
 little bits of opulence to this audience hall. An array of dainty
 chandeliers hanging from the ceiling barely warms or brightens the
 room. Portraits of jowly merchants line the stone walls, looking down
 onto the clerks and audience-seekers below with imperturbable disdain.
 The entrance to the council chambers to the north and the exit from
 the hall to the south are both flanked by extravagantly woven but thin
 tapestries.

 Well-dressed men and women sit in ornate chairs lined across one wall
 of the gallery, presumably also waiting for an audience with the
 council. The town's clerk, Trelawney, watches over them irritably from
 his desk.

>examine me

 As good-looking as ever.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   some forms
   a spellbook
   a set of lockpicks

>examine forms

 Various forms releasing the town council from any legal liability in
 various likely scenarios. Dragon-slaying has changed quite a bit since
 Blackacre was founded.

 A clerk scurries over to Trelawney and whispers something to him. "All
 right," he says to you, "give me your forms, and you can leave."

>give forms to trelawney

 Trelawney gives the forms a cursory inspection and adds them to the
 stack of paperwork on his desk. "You've already done your interview,"
 he says, and you wince as you remember it, "so that's it. You may go."

 It isn't a request. The Guild, though just as firm, was kinder. They
 arranged an apprenticeship to a wizard, but learning magic is a slow,
 arduous process. In the year you've worked for Dr. Mortemain, you've
 only managed to learn a single spell. You've dutifully completed the
 chores he gives you (usually involving petty acts of larceny against
 his rival wizards), but you're growing impatient, and you're always
 looking for something better.

 That thing turned out to be a giant, fire-breathing dragon. The
 otherwise pleasant town of Blackacre has been terrorized for the last
 few months by a dragon that sweeps in, burns down farmsteads and
 devours livestock, then retreats to the safety of its mountain lair.
 The town council is finally organizing a hunting party to defeat the
 dragon, and it needs someone to lead it. After weeks of pleading, Dr.
 Mortemain deigned to let you interview with the council to run the
 expedition, but only in exchange for stealing some important letters
 that are apparently stashed in the castle. (You didn't ask for the
 details; Dr. Mortemain doesn't like explaining himself, and you didn't
 want him to rescind his permission.) The interview turned out to be
 what you should have expected, but at least the council won't announce
 its decision until noon. You still have some time left.

 one. This interaction also replaces more complicated commands like ASK
 conversation tree as appropriate.

 There's no need to memorize or otherwise prepare spells; once you know
 a spell, you can cast it freely. The SPELLS or MEMORY verbs will show
 you what spells you've learned, although reading your spellbook will
 give you the same information.

 This game treats EXAMINE and READ as different verbs. Examining, say,
 a book will describe its cover; reading it would describe its
 contents.

 You can FOLLOW characters, though there's no difference between that

 The EXITS command lists the obvious exists from a room, though there
 may be some hidden exits that aren't initially listed.

 The ABOUT command will bring up a menu of various help topics,
 although you've presumably already figured that out by now.

 Before it became the seat of local government, this castle was an
 actively defended fortress, built and run to protect the town of
 Blackacre. It was designed for defense rather than comfort, and the
 castle still retains its original vertiginous spiral staircases,
 cavernous galleries, and piles of crumbling stonework. Nevertheless,
 people expect a certain reassuring level of conspicuous wealth in

 little bits of opulence to this audience hall. An array of dainty
 chandeliers hanging from the ceiling barely warms or brightens the
 room. Portraits of jowly merchants line the stone walls, looking down
 onto the clerks and audience-seekers below with imperturbable disdain.
 The entrance to the council chambers to the north and the exit from
 the hall to the south are both flanked by extravagantly woven but thin
 tapestries.

 Well-dressed men and women sit in ornate chairs lined across one wall
 of the gallery, presumably also waiting for an audience with the
 council. The town's clerk, Trelawney, watches over them irritably from
 his desk.

>examine tapestries

 The tapestries show Blackacre's founder, depicted as a victorious
 blond knight in spotless armor, slaying some sort of monstrous
 serpent. According to town legend, he defeated a monster that had been
 threatening the area and made it safe again for human habitation; in
 gratitude, the struggling settlers then declared him their mayor. In
 reality, Blackacre was founded by a consortium of herring merchants
 looking for a port closer to their shoals to cut down on
 transportation costs, and the founding comprised filing a proposal
 with the deputy undersecretary of the Royal Ministry of Fisheries. The
 artist chose the story that's easier to weave into a tapestry.

>examine portraits

 The portraits show long-deceased merchants from the past centuries of
 Blackacre's history. Some of their business practices were
 indisputably underhanded and occasionally completely illegal, but
 their considerable donations to the town have apparently succeeded in
 whitewashing their pasts. The painters did their best to present their
 dissipated, corpulent subjects in a favorable light (literally, in the
 case of the chiaroscuros), but the rows of faces look blank and
 unremarkable even as they sneer down at you.

>go north

 "The council will be deliberating for a while," says Trelawney.
 "You're free to leave now. They'll make the announcement at noon in
 the town square."

 You notice two of your old colleagues in the Guild, Mr. Wattman and
 Mr. Puncher, stalk into the antechamber. You try to look
 inconspicuous, but the two notice you, and Mr. Wattman boisterously
 waves to you.

>talk to wattman

 Against your better judgment, you strike up a conversation with Mr.
 Wattman.

 "How are you doing in the Guild?"
 "Mr. Puncher and I have moved up in the world. We're management now,"
 he says proudly. "We run the loss prevention group in the Guild."
 "Isn't that against the entire point of the Guild?"
 "Preventing the loss of people, not things. We're looking at the
 bigger picture now. You see, occasionally some guild members forget
 their loyalty to the guild and try to do some things they shouldn't:
 quit the guild, join a rival guild, or even run tattling to the town
 watch."
 "You don't think I---"
 "Oh, don't worry. You left the Guild on mutual and perfectly amicable
 terms. Besides, we have bigger fish to fry."
 "In burning oil," puts in Mr. Puncher.
 "For example. Our job is to find those poor, wayward souls who might
 be tempted to leave the Guild and put the fear of God, as well as
 several knives, into them."

 1) That's great!
 2) That's awful!

 "That's great!" you say a bit too loudly.
 "Glad to see you're on our side. Like I keep telling people, you're a
 good kid. I know a few members of the Guild think you're a traitor,
 but I want you to know that I merely think you're incompetent."

 As he leans forward to pat you on the shoulder in what he presumably
 thinks is a reassuring manner, you notice a small rock tied to his
 belt.

 one; Mr. Puncher and I met with the council last week. I showed off
 some of my knife tricks, which will come in handy for fighting a
 dragon. Some of the council members were concerned that I didn't have
 much experience with the finer points of diplomacy and negotiation,
 but I said I could take a wild stab in the dark at them. When they're
 walking home at night, for example."

 "That's terrible!"
 "No, it's actually very profitable."
 "I mean that it's morally wrong."
 "Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. If we always stopped to worry
 about what's 'right' or wrong'," he says, making quotation marks with
 his fingers, "then nothing would ever get done.
 "You have to keep in mind what's really important," he continues,
 giving you what he apparently thinks is a smile. "Does the Guild pay
 me a literally and metaphorically criminal sum for my work? Certainly.
 Am I successful? Of course. But I'm rich because I have a lot of
 friends." He clears his throat. "Excuse me, I misspoke. I'm rich
 because I have a lot of <span class="floydstyle u1">money</span>."

 You notice idly that when he lifted his arms and his tunic rode up
 slightly, he had a small rock tied to his belt.

 Your trusty set of lockpicks are undoubtedly your most treasured
 possession, far beyond the literal treasure you've possessed. Even
 though the Guild politely suggested that you return the other
 accoutrements and clever devices you carried, it would have been
 unthinkable to suggest or offer to relinquish your lockpicks.

 Well-dressed men and women sit in ornate chairs lined across one wall

 "The council will be deliberating for a while," says Trelawney.
 "You're free to leave now. They'll make the announcement at noon in
 the town square."

>go south

 Dr. Mortemain only deigned to let you come to the castle this morning
 after you promised to retrieve the missing letters for him. If you
 return empty-handed, you'll likely spend another week as a frog.

>go up

 You can't go that way.

>examine chandeliers

 The chandeliers are an obligatory bit of finery in the hall, but they
 serve no purpose; the castle is now a place of business rather than a
 residence, and it's unlit after the clerks leave at night.

>examine clerks

 The clerks shuffle through the hall carrying piles of documents,
 somehow managing to dodge the audience-seekers and other functionaries
 seemingly without looking at where they're going.

>look behind portrait

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine desk

 This desk is Trelawney's bulwark against the hordes of demanding
 troublemakers in the hall. Like its owner, it's wooden, imposing, and
 has paperwork piled onto it.

>steal rock

 You sidle over to Mr. Wattman and search around for something with
 which to distract him. "So, it sounds like you're moving up in the
 world."

 "Absolutely," he says, grinning. "Both metaphorically and literally.
 I'm in a corner office on the top floor, with a secretary to keep out
 the riffraff."

 "Impressive. Soon you'll have a portrait up there," you say, pointing
 at the rows of gilt-edged oil paintings of merchants lining the walls.
 As Mr. Wattman reflexively looks up at the portraits, you quickly
 snatch the rock off his belt.

 "Well, you'd better go in for your interview now," you say quickly,
 looking at Trelawney supplicatingly. He waffles for a moment between
 his distaste for you and his distaste for Mr. Wattman, then brusquely
 waves him toward the door. He triumphantly leaves to the north, and
 Mr. Puncher follows mutely.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>examine rock

 The grey, spongy rock is enchanted with a spell that magically summons
 a swarm of illusory insects when it's poked or squeezed, which can
 serve as a convenient distraction. It's one of the last resorts of
 thieves and joke shops; it's strange for Mr. Wattman to have had it.

>squeeze rock

 With a dry susurration, a horde of bugs crawls out of the holes in the
 rock and scatters across the floor. Even though you know they're only
 an illusion, you skin crawls as they do across the floor. The
 audience-seekers are too practiced to lose their composure, merely
 lifting their feet off the floor and trying to avoid eye contact with
 the bugs or their companions. The clerks, however, have no need to
 impress anyone, and several give short cries and dash out of the hall.
 Trelawney looks up from his desk and sighs.

 A year of study, and you've only learned one spell:

 accounting reports. They seem to be standard, uninteresting paperwork
 related to the castle upkeep.

 You'd rather leave the reports alone. As long as Trelawney is
 concentrating on them, he's not paying close attention to you.

>give rock to trelawney

 You miss, and the rock bounces into a corner. With a dry susurration,

 You miss, and the rock bounces into a corner. With a dry susurration,
 a horde of bugs crawls out of the holes in the rock and scatters
 across the floor. Even though you know they're only an illusion, you
 skin crawls as they do across the floor. The audience-seekers are too
 practiced to lose their composure, merely lifting their feet off the
 floor and trying to avoid eye contact with the bugs or their
 companions. The clerks, however, have no need to impress anyone, and
 several give short cries and dash out of the hall. Trelawney looks up
 from his desk and sighs.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Antechamber</span>
 Before it became the seat of local government, this castle was an
 actively defended fortress, built and run to protect the town of
 Blackacre. It was designed for defense rather than comfort, and the
 castle still retains its original vertiginous spiral staircases,
 cavernous galleries, and piles of crumbling stonework. Nevertheless,
 people expect a certain reassuring level of conspicuous wealth in
 their public buildings, and the town council has obligingly added
 little bits of opulence to this audience hall. An array of dainty
 chandeliers hanging from the ceiling barely warms or brightens the
 room. Portraits of jowly merchants line the stone walls, looking down
 onto the clerks and audience-seekers below with imperturbable disdain.
 The entrance to the council chambers to the north and the exit from
 the hall to the south are both flanked by extravagantly woven but thin
 tapestries.

 Well-dressed men and women sit in ornate chairs lined across one wall
 of the gallery, presumably also waiting for an audience with the
 council. The town's clerk, Trelawney, watches over them irritably from
 his desk.

 A horde of illusionary insects skitters across the floor here, causing
 many of the audience-seekers to jump on their chairs or hover in the
 corners of the hall.

 You can also see a porous grey rock here.

 The seneschal tries gamely to corral the swarm of illusionary bugs,
 stalking them about the room.


 Well-dressed men and women mill around the hall, trying in vain to
 grab the attention of the clerks that sweep through the room. A few
 more sit in the chairs around the edge of the hall, waiting patiently
 for their audience with the council.

 The seneschal tries gamely to corral the swarm of illusionary bugs,
 stalking them about the room. The spell maintaining the swarm is a
 weak one, and the complexity of responding to his actions is enough to
 disrupt it. The illusions scurry into corners of the room and fade
 out.

 Taken.


 Dr. Mortemain only deigned to let you come to the castle this morning
 after you promised to retrieve the missing letters for him. If you
 return empty-handed, you'll likely spend another week as a frog.


 You can't go that way.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Salon</span>
 This salon also functions as a waiting room, though it's refreshingly
 quieter than the main gallery to the west. A massive table occupies
 most of the space in the small, dimly-lit room, and there is a soft
 carpet underfoot.


 It's a massive table, probably used for some sort of meeting or
 conference.

>examine carpet

 The carpet is soft and thick, though slightly frayed at the edges.

>look under carpet

 You shove a corner of the carpet aside. The floor beneath it is far
 less dusty than you would have expected, and one of the flagstones in
 it looks loose.

>move flagstone

 The flagstone is too heavy to lift completely off the floor, though
 you can shove it aside with a bit of effort. The stone groans as it
 grinds against the floor, and you hear impatient footsteps
 approaching. You heave it back in place just in time to face Trelawney
 as he glares at you from the doorway.

 "What's going on in here?" he demands.
 "What do you mean, what's going in here?"
 "What do you mean, what do I mean, what's going in here?"
 "What do you---"
 "Enough. I heard a loud noise."
 "Oh, that. Sorry, I was doing some calisthenics--- you know, for the
 dragon. I must have bumped the table by accident."
 "Very well," says Trelawney. "I'll leave you alone for now. You should
 know, however, that I've talked with the city guard. I'll be keeping
 an eye on you."
 "I don't know what you mean, sir. I'm just eager to help out my city
 however I can."

 Trelawney mutters something under his breath and returns to the main
 hall.

 You are carrying:
   a porous grey rock
   a spellbook
   a set of lockpicks

 "Hmm? I didn't hear anything."
 The seneschal looks at you disapprovingly. "I don't know what you're
 up to, young man, but stay out of trouble. Don't make me have a word
 with your master. He and I are very good friends, you know."
 "I doubt that Dr. Mortemain is very good friends with anyone," you say
 skeptically.
 Trelawney opens his mouth to respond, then decides that he was bested
 and quietly withdraws from the room.

>push flagstone onto carpet

 You can't see any such thing.


 You are unable to.

>exits

 There is an exit leading west.


 That's not something you can stand on.

 The swarm of insects dissolves as the spell maintaining the illusion
 dissipates.


 You need to be holding the soft carpet before you can put it on top of
 something else.


 Although the carpet is undeniably valuable, walking through the castle
 with it might attract some notice.


 You uncover the flagstone again.


 That's not a verb I recognize.


 The flagstone is too heavy to lift completely off the floor, though
 you can shove it aside with a bit of effort. The stone groans as it
 grinds against the floor, and you hear impatient footsteps
 approaching. You heave it back in place just in time to face Trelawney
 as he glares at you from the doorway.

 "Could you please keep it down in here?" asks Trelawney exasperatedly.
 "I don't know what you're up to, and I don't care. Just don't make any
 trouble."
 "Wouldn't dream of it, sir," you reply, smiling innocently.

 The seneschal sighs and returns to the audience hall.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Antechamber</span>
 Before it became the seat of local government, this castle was an

 council. The town's clerk, Trelawney, watches over them irritably from
 his desk.


 You achieve nothing by this.

 Trelawney slowly and methodically adjusts the accounts on his desk,
 straightening the already neat stacks of paperwork. "A tidy desk means
 a tidy mind," he murmurs to himself.


 With a dry susurration, a horde of bugs crawls out of the holes in the
 rock and scatters across the floor. Even though you know they're only

 most of the space in the small, dimly-lit room, and there is a soft
 carpet underfoot.

 You can see a loose flagstone here.

 From the audience hall to the west, you hear heavy bootsteps and mild
 minced oaths directed at insects.


 The flagstone is too heavy to lift completely off the floor, though
 you can shove it aside with a bit of effort. The stone groans as it
 grinds against the floor, but you manage to heave it far enough aside
 to reveal a sheaf of letters underneath. You gingerly pocket it and
 replace the flagstone.

 From the audience hall to the west, you hear heavy bootsteps and mild
 minced oaths directed at insects.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by three points.]</span>

>examine letters

 The letters look vaguely official, but you can't determine anything
 more specific. They're free of dust, which suggests that they weren't
 hidden beneath the flagstone for long.

 The seneschal pokes his head through the doorway. "What are you doing
 in here? I heard a loud noise."
 "Really? I didn't hear anything," you protest innocently.
 Trelawney glares at you. "Out of respect for your master, I'm going to
 pretend I believe you. Now go. The council will announce its decision
 in the town square at noon."

>read letters

 The top sheet is blank, and the papers are bound together too tightly
 to read any of the others.

>unbind papers

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>open letters

 You consider unraveling the sheaf of letters, but Dr. Mortemain
 insisted that you not read them, and you don't think you could tie
 them together as neatly again.

>go west

 You discreetly conceal the letters in your tunic and return to the
 antechamber.

>go south

 With the letters safely tucked under your tunic, you dispose of the
 incriminating rock, bound out of the antechamber, and head toward
 Blackacre. The castle gate clatters down behind you, crashing against
 the stonework with a deafening finality.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Gate</span>
 The imposing Castle Blackacre stands before you to the south, casting
 a long shadow over the nearby farmland. Centuries ago, it was a useful
 fortification; now, it's the de facto town hall and headquarters for
 Mayor Pratt and his staff.

 A road to the north leads into town. The castle gate is normally left
 open, but today the portcullis is down while the castle prepares for
 the Mayor's speech at noon.


 There is an exit leading north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Winding Path</span>
 This path winds northwest to south between the town of Blackacre and
 its nearby castle. Newly-planted fields stretch as far as you can see
 to either side of the trail. It's a charmingly rustic sight but an
 unpleasant smell; the farmers must have fertilized the fields
 recently.

 You can see a skunk here.


 A small black and white creature with a bushy tail. It looks at you
 warily.


 There are exits leading south and northwest.

>shake lockpicks

 You look ridiculous waving the set of lockpicks.

>show lockpick to skunk

 The skunk is unimpressed.

 The skunk leaves to the northwest.

>show lockpicks to skunk

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine plants

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine field

 Blackacre was originally a fishing outpost, and the land here is not
 particularly fertile. There's no shortage of overly optimistic farmers
 in the area around the castle, but they don't stay in town long.

 The skunk enters from the northwest.

>yell

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Twisting Path</span>
 This path winds north to southeast between the town of Blackacre and
 its nearby castle. The farmland on either side of the road is bare;
 it's far too early for crops to start growing, and no trees disturb
 the empty fields.


 There are exits leading north and southeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Square</span>
 Blackacre's picturesque town square spreads out before you. Although
 it's no longer central in terms of geography or importance, this area
 is nevertheless a genuinely pleasant part of town. A clock tower
 dominates the plaza, towering over the cedars planted around it.
 Benches surround the flowerbeds that dot the square. Blackacre
 residents occasionally filter through the square, shivering in the
 crisp morning air.

 Streets leave the square to the east and west, and a road to the south
 leads from the town of Blackacre to the castle of Blackacre. Among the
 crowded buildings ringing the square are the post office to the north
 and magic store to the southwest.

>go southwest

 You decide to hand off the papers to Dr. Mortemain first; walking
 around town with them is unnecessarily risky.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Street (West)</span>
 As its name implies, Guild Street contains most of the town's
 guildhalls. There are far fewer now than a century ago, when the
 street was originally constructed, as the daily administration of the
 town became concentrated in the nearby castle. The ominous stone tower
 standing to the north was formerly the base of operations of the
 once-prominent Magicians' Guild, which counted dozens of wizards among
 its members in its heyday. That heyday passed centuries ago, however,
 and the only wizards currently in town are you and Dr. Mortemain. He
 acquired the tower after the guild's dissolution, and it's there that
 you now spend most of your time.

 The street returns to the town square to the west and continues to the
 east.

 You can see a tarnished brass mailbox (which contains a beige
 envelope) here.

 A tinny but catchy song issues from the mailbox:

     <span class="floydstyle u1">You have a letter!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tower Entry</span>
 This familiar area is the tower's entryway. It's intended to impress
 and intimidate visitors, and so the recesses of the gloomy vaulted
 ceiling are decorated with elaborate carvings of gargoyles and demons.
 The curtains are partially drawn, bathing the cavernous hall in
 hesitant shadows. As an uncharacteristic nod to practicality, an
 umbrella stand sits beside the double doors leading south from the
 tower. A corridor to the north leads across the polished marble floor
 deeper inside.

 Flux, Dr. Mortemain's familiar, waves its tail in a desultory greeting
 as you enter. "I sssee you have returned. How did the busssinesss at
 the cassstle go?" it hisses.
 "Great!" you lie smoothly. "I won't know until noon, but the interview
 went very well."
 "Not that," sneers Flux. "Did you sssteal the massster'sss lettersss?"
 "Oh, right. Sure, no problem."
 "Good! I knew you could do it," says Flux unconvincingly, dipping its
 head slightly in an uncharacteristic gesture of appreciation. "The
 massster sssaid you're good for nothing, but I know you're good for
 exsssactly one thing."

>take all

 Flux: I don't suppose Flux would care for that.
 perch: That's fixed in place.

>take umbrella

 That's hardly portable.


 Only visitors to the tower use the umbrella stand; you've never
 managed to keep track of an umbrella for more than a few days, and no
 wizard worth the title would deign to get caught in a rainstorm.


 The umbrella stand is empty.


 Flux is Dr. Mortemain's familiar. You're not sure what kind of
 creature it is, but it looks like a small lizard with leathery,
 bat-like wings and a scaly, prehensile tail. It performs some basic
 chores around the tower, but you suspect that the wizard keeps it
 around just to annoy you.

>talk to flux

 "Not now! Bring me the massster'sss lettersss!" it hisses.

 Flux idly whacks the perch with its tail.

>kill flux

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>go north

 Flux flaps its wings angrily in your face and hisses. "No no no! The
 massster told you to get his lettersss, and he told me to ssstop you
 from going inside the tower until you get them!"

>give letters to flux

 Flux greedily snatches the letters from you and flies off deeper into
 the castle. After a moment, it returns with three pouches and a sheet
 of parchment.
 "Well," you say conversationally, "I guess I'll be getting on with
 things. It'll nice to have the day to myself, without Dr. Mortemain
 dictating what I do."
 "I'm sssure it would, but the massster left some choresss for you in
 hisss absssenssse," says Flux, brandishing the parchment.
 "But---"
 "Or I could tell him that you ignored hisss inssstructionsss, if you'd
 prefer. I'm sssure he'd ssstill let you go to the ssseremony thisss
 afternoon..." It leaves the threat hanging in the air as you sigh and
 take the items. "Let me know when you're done, and I'll passs them
 along to the massster."
 "And that's it?"
 "Of courssse. Almossst sssertainly. Probably."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 The tower's library is wonderful. You spent the first two weeks as Dr.
 Mortemain's apprentice here, grudgingly falling asleep early each
 morning after spending the day and night reading through the mountain
 of the books piled around the room. Even now, you've only covered a
 small fraction of the maze of tipping bookcases that stretch to the
 ceiling and crowd around the reading area. In this quiet and
 undisturbed area, redolent of old books, you've spent the happiest
 part of your year in the tower. If you have to leave, exits lead in
 all four directions to the other wings.

 A lectern stands in an empty space near the center of the room.

 You can also see a leather-bound index here.

>examine index

 It's an index of some common substances used in enchantments. It's not
 detailed or specific enough to be helpful when actually casting
 spells, which is why it's in this library rather than a laboratory,
 but it's nevertheless a useful reference.

>read index

 You flip through the book to a random entry:

 SKINK: Skinks are often used in divination spells, usually in the form
 of a bright red powder. The natural color of powdered skink is a dull
 grey; the chemicals and magical treatments involved in preparing it
 for spellcraft dye it that color. They are particularly useful in
 spells locating quarry in caves or underground, due to their
 predilection for burrowing.

>read index

 You flip through the book to a random entry:

 BASILISK: This frightening monster is used in only very powerful
 magical spells, as it is rare and extremely dangerous. Its scales are
 far less dangerous to work with than the live creature, and they can
 often be found in abandoned lairs after molting. Basilisks are often
 used in protective spells, particularly in enchanting armor.

>look up toad in index

 TOAD: Frogs and toads are used in a variety of magic. For larger and
 more complex spells, it is generally preferable to use fossilized or
 petrified toads, rather than powdered ones, in order to concentrate
 the magical energies. The natural agility of the toad makes it a
 natural component for spells related to travel, and its locomotion
 makes it particularly apt for teleportation spells.

 The heavy book is a bestiary of mundane and fantastical creatures.
 It's not very reliable; the information in it is taken from folk

 beautiful, though, and it's remarkable as a work of art, if not
 scholarship. The book is chained to the lectern.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 This room is Dr. Mortemain's study, his gentlemanly refuge from the
 rigors of his duties as a wizard. An inviting antimacassared armchair
 sits in front of the fireplace, and a liquor cabinet stands at the
 ready nearby. Above the mantle, an intricately painted map hangs from
 the wainscoting. An octagonal stand has been tucked discreetly into
 the corner.

 You can see a wooden staff here.

 The crystal ball sits at the center of an octagonal stand with an
 arrow painted on it, pointing to the south.

 You receive a mild shock as you try to open the cabinet; apparently
 Dr. Mortemain has put a magical ward on it to prevent your breaking
 into it. You feel a momentary bit of righteous indignation at his lack
 of trust in you, tempered by the fact that you've just proven him
 right.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 This room is Dr. Mortemain's study, his gentlemanly refuge from the
 rigors of his duties as a wizard. An inviting antimacassared armchair
 sits in front of the fireplace, and a liquor cabinet stands at the
 ready nearby. Above the mantle, an intricately painted map hangs from
 the wainscoting. An octagonal stand has been tucked discreetly into
 the corner.

>turn stand

 You rotate the stand so that the arrow is now pointing to the
 southwest.

>examine ball

 It's a perfectly round sphere of crystal, or at least glass, set into
 the exact center of the octagonal stand. You can vaguely make out some
 hazy images deep within it.

>look in ball

 An image slowly fades into view:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Square</span>
 Blackacre's picturesque town square spreads out before you. Although
 it's no longer central in terms of geography or importance, this area
 is nevertheless a genuinely pleasant part of town. A clock tower
 dominates the plaza, towering over the cedars planted around it.
 Benches surround the flowerbeds that dot the square. Blackacre
 residents occasionally filter through the square, shivering in the
 crisp morning air.

 Streets leave the square to the east and west, and a road to the south
 leads from the town of Blackacre to the castle of Blackacre. Among the
 crowded buildings ringing the square are the post office to the north
 and magic store to the southwest.

 The map depicts this corner of the world in intricate detail: the
 ports along the coast, the financial center at Moneyville, the barren
 northeastern tundra, the densely forested marches to the west, and the
 rough gorges in the western scrublands.

>touch ball

 You feel nothing unexpected.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 The tower's library is wonderful. You spent the first two weeks as Dr.
 Mortemain's apprentice here, grudgingly falling asleep early each
 morning after spending the day and night reading through the mountain
 of the books piled around the room. Even now, you've only covered a
 small fraction of the maze of tipping bookcases that stretch to the
 ceiling and crowd around the reading area. In this quiet and
 undisturbed area, redolent of old books, you've spent the happiest
 part of your year in the tower. If you have to leave, exits lead in
 all four directions to the other wings.

 A lectern stands in an empty space near the center of the room.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The tower's kitchen is almost an afterthought; Dr. Mortemain prefers
 to conduct business with various dignitaries over meals in town rather
 than wasting time eating alone in the tower, and you're usually too
 busy while here to eat. As such, the spartan kitchen is usually empty
 and spotless. An unused trestle table sits in the center of the room,
 and a desultory cabinet has been set into the far wall.

 On the trestle table are a white canister (which is closed) and a
 green canister (which is closed).

>open white

 You open the white canister, revealing some salt.

>open green

 You open the moss-colored pouch.

>open green canister

 You open the green canister, revealing some bright green powder.

>examine green powder

 Dr. Mortemain is very particular about his tea, and he had this fine,
 bright green powder shipped here at great expense.

>take all

 trestle table: That's fixed in place.
 cupboard: That's fixed in place.

>take white container

 I only understood you as far as wanting to take the white canister.

>take white canister

 Taken.

>take green canister

 Taken.

>open cabinet

 Opening the cupboard reveals a variety of foodstuffs: a manchet loaf,
 some salted herring, and a slab of beef.

>take all from cabinet

 manchet loaf: Removed.
 salted herring: Removed.
 slab of beef: Removed.

>examine herring

 Although Blackacre was founded by fishermen, its appeal was quantity
 rather than quality. These herring look completely unremarkable.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tower Entry</span>
 This familiar area is the tower's entryway. It's intended to impress
 and intimidate visitors, and so the recesses of the gloomy vaulted
 ceiling are decorated with elaborate carvings of gargoyles and demons.
 The curtains are partially drawn, bathing the cavernous hall in
 hesitant shadows. As an uncharacteristic nod to practicality, an
 umbrella stand sits beside the double doors leading south from the
 tower. A corridor to the north leads across the polished marble floor
 deeper inside.

 Flux sits on his perch, idly kneading it with its claws.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Street (West)</span>
 As its name implies, Guild Street contains most of the town's
 guildhalls. There are far fewer now than a century ago, when the
 street was originally constructed, as the daily administration of the
 town became concentrated in the nearby castle. The ominous stone tower
 standing to the north was formerly the base of operations of the
 once-prominent Magicians' Guild, which counted dozens of wizards among
 its members in its heyday. That heyday passed centuries ago, however,
 and the only wizards currently in town are you and Dr. Mortemain. He
 acquired the tower after the guild's dissolution, and it's there that
 you now spend most of your time.

 The street returns to the town square to the west and continues to the
 east.

 You can see a tarnished brass mailbox here.

 leads from the town of Blackacre to the castle of Blackacre. Among the
 crowded buildings ringing the square are the post office to the north
 and magic store to the southwest.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Magick Shoppe</span>
 Blackacre's only magic shop looks the part: It's a musty, timbered
 building with some feeble light oozing in through its rafters. Its
 owner, Sandie, was formerly an undistinguished apprentice wizard; now
 she uses both that title and her ineptitude with magic for
 considerable financial gain. Her clients are from rich families and
 have elderly, sick relatives. They want to inherit, but they're
 obligated to do something to help. Sandie is that something. She
 performs the perfunctory duties of an attendant magician, but her lack
 of talent with magic eliminates the possibility of any inconvenient
 recovery. She sadly informs the dutiful sons or daughters that nothing
 can be done; they inherit a large sum of money shortly thereafter; and
 then they donate a modest fraction of that sum to Sandie in gratitude
 for her services.

 As such, most of the items in the shop are gaudy, sparkly trinkets of
 no use or value. A stuffed alligator even hangs gratuitously from the
 ceiling. To maintain plausible deniability, though, Sandie keeps some
 genuinely magical items in her shop. Having the occasional wizard as a
 customer makes her consulting activities more plausible, and she tries
 to keep you and Dr. Mortemain as loyal customers. Your jaundiced eye
 notices a display case that looks invitingly dusty.

 The store continues to the south, and the exit back to the town square
 is to the northeast.

 A golem stands at the exit.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shoppe Counter</span>
 This back corner is a bit more tasteful than the main shop floor to
 the north. There aren't any magical (or magickal) items for purchase
 here, but at the back of the room is a long, high counter.

 A satchel hangs from a hook on the wall.

 Sandie herself is here, stuffing a pile of envelopes into a satchel.
 She greets at you with a brisk but genuine friendliness without
 affection behind it. "I'm just about to take these to the post
 office," she explains, indicating the satchel. "It's part of a
 marketing campaign I've just begun. I'm mailing off as many of these
 as I can to advertise the shop. It means lugging a bag full of
 envelopes to the mail about four or five times per hour, but it'll be
 worth it if it drums up some more customers." She excuses herself and
 heads north.

 A golem stands at the exit.

 You can also see Sandie here.

 Sandie exits the shop, and the golem bows reverentially as she passes.

>examine display case

 The display case lacks the gaudiness of the rest of the shop's
 offerings and thus has accumulated a thick layer of dust. Three are
 three bins in it, suitable for storing small magical components.

>examine bins

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine bin

 Which do you mean, the left bin, the center bin, or the right bin?

>examine left bin

 Like the rest of the display case, the left bin has seen little use.

 The left bin is closed.

>open left bin

 You open the left bin, revealing some powdered skink.

>open center bin

 You open the center bin.

>examine center bin

 Like the rest of the display case, the center bin has seen little use.

 The center bin is open.

>open right bin

 You open the right bin, revealing some basilisk scales.

>examine scales

 The scales are transparent but have a faint oily, iridescent sheen.

>examine skink

 It's a fine, acrid red powder.

 Sandie enters the shop, and the golem bows reverentially as she
 passes.

 As you reach down to scoop up the powder, you're rudely jostled from
 behind. It tumbles out of your hand, and you watch helplessly as it
 falls down a crack in the floor. You turn in around in irritation and
 are met by the smirking face of Mr. Wattman.
 "Oh, I'm so sorry! It's so crowded in here," he says, gesturing at the
 empty space around the two of you, "and it looks like we were both
 looking for some powdered skink. I know your master asked you to get
 some, and now... Oh well, these things happen."
 Whistling happily, Mr. Wattman leaves the shop, doffing his hat to the
 golem as he passes it.

 Sandie leaves to the south.

>take basilisk

 Taken.

>go northeast

 As you leave, the golem pats you down, pawing at your clothing
 aggressively and rifling through your possessions. It lays one massive
 hand on the basilisk scales and looks at you expressionlessly.
 "Oh, that? I must have accidentally forgotten to pay for it by
 accident," you manage to say through confused anger.
 The golem continues to stare at you blankly, though it makes no
 movement away from the exit.

 There's a narrow crack in the floor, presumably leading into the

 Sandie hangs up her satchel.

 Sandie, smilingly brightly, stands once again at the counter.

>put basilisk into envelope

 There's not enough room in the beige envelope.

>buy basilisk

 "How much are these basilisk scales?"
 She peers at them critically. "Hmm, eighteen marks."
 "<span class="floydstyle u1">Eighteen marks</span>? That's more than the rent for my cottage for
 an entire year!"
 "Is it?" she asks, regarding you with disappointment. "Then perhaps
 the scales are not for you."
 "They aren't for me; they're for my master. Can you put them on his
 account?"
 "Dr. Mortemain? He doesn't have an account here," she says firmly.
 "Rich wizards with their attention on loftier matters have a tendency
 to forget about their debts. My creditors are not as absent-minded. If
 you want the scales, you'll have to pay for them in cash."

 When the Guild of Postmen flourished under the patronage of the town,
 this sprawling building was its headquarters. Now it's a humid,

 popular Thaumatics Group, that handles all of the mail within the
 city. The machine hums quietly as tiny iridescent sparks coruscate
 along its surface.

 The building's exit is to the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Square</span>
 Blackacre's picturesque town square spreads out before you. Although
 it's no longer central in terms of geography or importance, this area
 is nevertheless a genuinely pleasant part of town. A clock tower
 dominates the plaza, towering over the cedars planted around it.
 Benches surround the flowerbeds that dot the square. Blackacre
 residents occasionally filter through the square, glancing up
 nervously at the overcast sky.

 Streets leave the square to the east and west, and a road to the south
 leads from the town of Blackacre to the castle of Blackacre. Among the
 crowded buildings ringing the square are the post office to the north
 and magic store to the southwest.

 The sky looks cloudy.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Post Office</span>
 When the Guild of Postmen flourished under the patronage of the town,
 this sprawling building was its headquarters. Now it's a humid,
 cavernous warehouse containing a single contraption, designed by the
 popular Thaumatics Group, that handles all of the mail within the
 city. The machine hums quietly as tiny iridescent sparks coruscate
 along its surface.

 The building's exit is to the south.

>push black button

 The machine clicks hollowly, but nothing further happens.

>look in machine

 Which do you mean, the white button, the manchet loaf, or the white

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Street (West)</span>
 As its name implies, Guild Street contains most of the town's
 guildhalls. There are far fewer now than a century ago, when the
 street was originally constructed, as the daily administration of the
 town became concentrated in the nearby castle. The ominous stone tower
 standing to the north was formerly the base of operations of the
 once-prominent Magicians' Guild, which counted dozens of wizards among
 its members in its heyday. That heyday passed centuries ago, however,
 and the only wizards currently in town are you and Dr. Mortemain. He
 acquired the tower after the guild's dissolution, and it's there that
 you now spend most of your time.

 The street returns to the town square to the west and continues to the
 east.

 You can see a tarnished brass mailbox (which contains an umber
 envelope and a beige envelope) here.

 This familiar area is the tower's entryway. It's intended to impress

 The curtains are partially drawn, bathing the cavernous hall in
 hesitant shadows. As an uncharacteristic nod to practicality, an
 umbrella stand sits beside the double doors leading south from the
 tower. A corridor to the north leads across the polished marble floor
 deeper inside.

 Flux sits on his perch, idly kneading it with its claws.

>give black pouch to flux

 Flux considers the basilisk scales for a moment, trying to think of a
 reason to be displeased with them. "I sssuppossse this will have to
 do," it says resignedly, accepting the pouch and flying off with it
 deeper into the tower. After a moment, it returns empty-handed and
 lands heavily on its perch, clawing it at irritably.

 As its name implies, Guild Street contains most of the town's

 still some guilds whose headquarters lie along this street. Most

 nondescript building runs along the south edge of the street.

 The street continues to the east and west, and a narrow alley to the
 southeast winds along the guild.

 You can see a shiny brass mailbox (which contains a brown parcel)
 here.

 A shadowy figure stalks over to the mailbox and starts to open it.
 Seeing that you're watching him, he pointedly turns away from you. He
 then does something with the mailbox, but with his back blocking your
 view, you can't tell what exactly it is. There is a faint click from
 the mailbox, and the man turns back around. He pulls a parcel out of
 the mailbox, confusedly ponders its label for a moment, and returns
 it. With a shrug, he leaves to the east.

 The street address written on the nondescript parcel is smudged and

 The tower's library is wonderful. You spent the first two weeks as Dr.
 Mortemain's apprentice here, grudgingly falling asleep early each
 morning after spending the day and night reading through the mountain
 of the books piled around the room. Even now, you've only covered a
 small fraction of the maze of tipping bookcases that stretch to the
 ceiling and crowd around the reading area. In this quiet and
 undisturbed area, redolent of old books, you've spent the happiest
 part of your year in the tower. If you have to leave, exits lead in
 all four directions to the other wings.

 A lectern stands in an empty space near the center of the room.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tower Entry</span>
 This familiar area is the tower's entryway. It's intended to impress
 and intimidate visitors, and so the recesses of the gloomy vaulted
 ceiling are decorated with elaborate carvings of gargoyles and demons.
 The curtains are partially drawn, bathing the cavernous hall in
 hesitant shadows. As an uncharacteristic nod to practicality, an
 umbrella stand sits beside the double doors leading south from the
 tower. A corridor to the north leads across the polished marble floor
 deeper inside.

 Flux sits on his perch, idly kneading it with its claws.

>go east

 You can't go that way.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Street (West)</span>
 As its name implies, Guild Street contains most of the town's
 guildhalls. There are far fewer now than a century ago, when the
 street was originally constructed, as the daily administration of the
 town became concentrated in the nearby castle. The ominous stone tower
 standing to the north was formerly the base of operations of the
 once-prominent Magicians' Guild, which counted dozens of wizards among
 its members in its heyday. That heyday passed centuries ago, however,
 and the only wizards currently in town are you and Dr. Mortemain. He
 acquired the tower after the guild's dissolution, and it's there that
 you now spend most of your time.

 The street returns to the town square to the west and continues to the
 east.

 You can see a tarnished brass mailbox (which contains an ochre
 envelope) here.

 A tinny but catchy song issues from the mailbox:

     <span class="floydstyle u1">There's something in your mailbox!</span>
     <span class="floydstyle u1">Don't invest in kale stocks!</span>
     <span class="floydstyle u1">Something something snail fox!</span>
     <span class="floydstyle u1">Hooray!</span>

>examine mailbox

 Despite already beginning to tarnish, the brass mailbox is a recent
 addition to the tower. It emits a blandly cheerful tune when mail
 arrives, and it continues to do until it's removed. You and Dr.
 Mortemain both dislike it, but each of you keeps it around out of mild
 spite towards the other.

 Inside the tarnished brass mailbox is an ochre envelope.

>take ochre

>open ochre

 You open the ochre envelope, revealing a glossy flyer.

>examine flyer

 The glossy flyer shows colorful images of various alleged magical
 paraphernalia: raven's skulls, black pointy hats, staves with vaguely
 mysterious symbols on them, and so on. At the bottom is an endorsement
 from the head of the Illusionists' Guild: "These products
 have...magical value, and the claims made by their sellers are [not]
 fraudulent."

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Street (East)</span>
 As its name implies, Guild Street contains most of the town's
 guildhalls. There are far fewer now than a century ago, when the
 street was originally constructed, as the daily administration of the
 town became concentrated in the nearby castle. Nevertheless, there are
 still some guilds whose headquarters lie along this street. Most
 infamous among them is the Thieves' Guild, whose aggressively
 nondescript building runs along the south edge of the street.

 The street continues to the east and west, and a narrow alley to the
 southeast winds along the guild.

 You can see an umber envelope (which is closed) and a shiny brass
 mailbox (which contains a brown parcel) here.

>look under mailbox

 Remembering the earlier actions of the footman, you gingerly run your
 hands over the mailbox and discover a small indentation on its
 underside.

>push indentation

 The mailbox reassuringly issues a faint, tinny <span class="floydstyle u1">clink</span>.

 The sky looks cloudy.

>take parcel

 Taken.

>examine parcel

 The street address written on the nondescript parcel is smudged and
 difficult to read. The last digit could be a 9, meaning that it was
 intended for the Thieves' Guild, but it's much more likely to be a 7
 and thus intended for Dr. Mortemain's tower.

 umbrella stand sits beside the double doors leading south from the
 tower. A corridor to the north leads across the polished marble floor
 deeper inside.

 Flux sits on his perch, idly kneading it with its claws.

>give green pouch to Flux

 Flux considers the fossilized toad for a moment, trying to think of a
 reason to be displeased with it. "I sssuppossse this will have to do,"
 it says resignedly, accepting the pouch and flying off with it deeper
 into the tower. After a moment, it returns empty-handed and lands
 heavily on its perch, clawing it at irritably.

 You have so far scored 15 out of a possible 20, in 303 turns.

>look up skink in index

 SKINK: Skinks are often used in divination spells, usually in the form
 of a bright red powder. The natural color of powdered skink is a dull
 grey; the chemicals and magical treatments involved in preparing it
 for spellcraft dye it that color. They are particularly useful in
 spells locating quarry in caves or underground, due to their
 predilection for burrowing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Square</span>
 Blackacre's picturesque town square spreads out before you. Although
 it's no longer central in terms of geography or importance, this area
 is nevertheless a genuinely pleasant part of town. A clock tower
 dominates the plaza, towering over the cedars planted around it.
 Benches surround the flowerbeds that dot the square. Blackacre
 residents occasionally filter through the square, glancing up
 nervously at the overcast sky.

 Streets leave the square to the east and west, and a road to the south
 leads from the town of Blackacre to the castle of Blackacre. Among the
 crowded buildings ringing the square are the post office to the north
 and magic store to the southwest.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Magick Shoppe</span>
 Blackacre's only magic shop looks the part: It's a musty, timbered
 building with some feeble light oozing in through its rafters. Its
 owner, Sandie, was formerly an undistinguished apprentice wizard; now
 she uses both that title and her ineptitude with magic for
 considerable financial gain. Her clients are from rich families and
 have elderly, sick relatives. They want to inherit, but they're
 obligated to do something to help. Sandie is that something. She
 performs the perfunctory duties of an attendant magician, but her lack
 of talent with magic eliminates the possibility of any inconvenient
 recovery. She sadly informs the dutiful sons or daughters that nothing
 can be done; they inherit a large sum of money shortly thereafter; and
 then they donate a modest fraction of that sum to Sandie in gratitude
 for her services.

 As such, most of the items in the shop are gaudy, sparkly trinkets of
 no use or value. A stuffed alligator even hangs gratuitously from the
 ceiling. To maintain plausible deniability, though, Sandie keeps some
 genuinely magical items in her shop. Having the occasional wizard as a
 customer makes her consulting activities more plausible, and she tries
 to keep you and Dr. Mortemain as loyal customers. Your jaundiced eye
 notices a display case that looks invitingly dusty.

 The store continues to the south, and the exit back to the town square
 is to the northeast.

 A golem stands at the exit.

 empty space around the two of you, "and it looks like we were both

 The golem is a gigantic, roughly humanoid, earthenware figure with
 some vague facial features roughly carved into it. Golems are rare;
 this particular one was a present to Sandie from the grateful heir to
 a baron who devoted his leisure time to magical oddities. The
 unnerving thing about it is not how much it looks like a human, but
 how much it doesn't look like a human; it's like looking at a corpse.


 The golem stares at you blankly. It's probably better that it doesn't
 respond, considering its crudely-drawn face has no mouth.

 You need to be holding the powdered skink before you can put it into
 something else.


 That's not a verb I recognize.


 The green canister is too large to fit inside the left bin.


 As you reach down to scoop up the powder, you're rudely jostled from
 behind. It tumbles out of your hand, and you watch helplessly as it
 falls down a crack in the floor. You turn in around in irritation and
 are met by the smirking face of Mr. Wattman.
 "Oh, I'm so sorry! It's so crowded in here," he says, gesturing at the
 empty space around the two of you, "and it looks like we were both
 looking for some powdered skink. I know your master asked you to get
 some, and now... Oh well, these things happen."
 Whistling happily, Mr. Wattman leaves the shop, doffing his hat to the
 golem as he passes it.


 The finely powdered skink has disappeared down the hairline crack, and
 you see no way of recovering it.


 There's a narrow crack in the floor, presumably leading into the
 store's basement or underground.


 You can't see any such thing.


 It smells strongly of earth.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shoppe Counter</span>
 This back corner is a bit more tasteful than the main shop floor to
 the north. There aren't any magical (or magickal) items for purchase
 here, but at the back of the room is a long, high counter.

 A satchel hangs from a hook on the wall.

 You can also see Sandie here.

 "Do you have any more powdered skink?"
 "Sorry, that's it. Most of my customers prefer flashier items, and I
 prefer safer ones."
 "Do you know where I could get some more?"
 "Sure: Travel six hundred miles to the northern wastes, find a nest of
 skinks, capture one without getting bitten, carefully dissect it,
 dissolve it in several caustic acids, pulverize it, apply a variety of
 enchantments to preserve it, then travel back to Blackacre by
 dogsled."

 "Where did you get that golem?

 "Wonderful, isn't it? That was a gift from the Baron Brombury. His
 elderly mother caught a nasty cold, and he asked me to look after her.
 I did all I could, but..." She trails off. "Anyway, the baron was
 quite forgiving, and he graciously offered me the golem in gratitude
 for my services. It's been quite useful. I had a few problems with
 thieves earlier---"
 "I'm sure the Thieves' Guild would never---"
 "Oh, of course not," she says, smiling. "It's the amateurs I'm worried
 about. Fortunately, the golem has scared them off."

>look behind counter

 You find nothing of interest.


 You can't go that way.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Magick Shoppe</span>
 Blackacre's only magic shop looks the part: It's a musty, timbered
 building with some feeble light oozing in through its rafters. Its
 owner, Sandie, was formerly an undistinguished apprentice wizard; now
 she uses both that title and her ineptitude with magic for
 considerable financial gain. Her clients are from rich families and
 have elderly, sick relatives. They want to inherit, but they're
 obligated to do something to help. Sandie is that something. She
 performs the perfunctory duties of an attendant magician, but her lack
 of talent with magic eliminates the possibility of any inconvenient
 recovery. She sadly informs the dutiful sons or daughters that nothing
 can be done; they inherit a large sum of money shortly thereafter; and
 then they donate a modest fraction of that sum to Sandie in gratitude
 for her services.

 As such, most of the items in the shop are gaudy, sparkly trinkets of
 no use or value. A stuffed alligator even hangs gratuitously from the
 ceiling. To maintain plausible deniability, though, Sandie keeps some
 genuinely magical items in her shop. Having the occasional wizard as a
 customer makes her consulting activities more plausible, and she tries
 to keep you and Dr. Mortemain as loyal customers. Your jaundiced eye
 notices a display case that looks invitingly dusty.

 The store continues to the south, and the exit back to the town square
 is to the northeast.

 The floor here has a small crack in it, through which the powdered
 skink fell.

 A golem stands at the exit.

 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

 The golem is unimpressed.


 As you leave, the golem pats you down, pawing at your clothing
 aggressively and rifling through your possessions. You glare at it,
 but, having found nothing, it looks at you expressionlessly and
 gestures toward the exit. You sneer at it but quietly leave.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Square</span>
 Blackacre's picturesque town square spreads out before you. Although
 it's no longer central in terms of geography or importance, this area
 is nevertheless a genuinely pleasant part of town. A clock tower
 dominates the plaza, towering over the cedars planted around it.
 Benches surround the flowerbeds that dot the square. Blackacre
 residents occasionally filter through the square, glancing up
 nervously at the overcast sky.

 Streets leave the square to the east and west, and a road to the south
 leads from the town of Blackacre to the castle of Blackacre. Among the
 crowded buildings ringing the square are the post office to the north
 and magic store to the southwest.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Twisting Path</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Street (West)</span>
 As its name implies, Guild Street contains most of the town's
 guildhalls. There are far fewer now than a century ago, when the
 street was originally constructed, as the daily administration of the
 town became concentrated in the nearby castle. The ominous stone tower
 standing to the north was formerly the base of operations of the
 once-prominent Magicians' Guild, which counted dozens of wizards among
 its members in its heyday. That heyday passed centuries ago, however,
 and the only wizards currently in town are you and Dr. Mortemain. He
 acquired the tower after the guild's dissolution, and it's there that
 you now spend most of your time.

 The street returns to the town square to the west and continues to the
 east.

 You can see a tarnished brass mailbox (which contains a lemon-colored
 envelope) here.

 A tinny but catchy song issues from the mailbox:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tower Entry</span>
 This familiar area is the tower's entryway. It's intended to impress
 and intimidate visitors, and so the recesses of the gloomy vaulted
 ceiling are decorated with elaborate carvings of gargoyles and demons.
 The curtains are partially drawn, bathing the cavernous hall in
 hesitant shadows. As an uncharacteristic nod to practicality, an
 umbrella stand sits beside the double doors leading south from the
 tower. A corridor to the north leads across the polished marble floor
 deeper inside.

 Flux sits on his perch, idly kneading it with its claws.

>give indigo to flux

 Flux considers the bright red powder for a moment, trying to think of
 a reason to be displeased with it. "Thisss doesssn't ssseem quite
 right. The magic on it feelsss wrong," it hisses, gingerly poking the
 powder with its claws. It sinuously lowers its head to the powder and
 sniffs it. "What is that sssmell?
 "Oh, sorry. There was a skunk, and..."
 Flux delicately sniffs the powder again. "Bah, I can't sssmell
 anything else. Are you sssure thisss is the ssskink?"
 "Of course. The proprietor of the magic shop gave it to me herself."
 It snorts and flaps its wings in frustration. "Fine, fine." It
 resignedly accepts the pouch and flies off with it deeper into the
 tower. After a moment, it returns empty-handed and lands heavily on
 its perch, clawing it at irritably.

 "I'm done now, right? Free to go to the ceremony at noon?"
 "Of courssse," Flux reassures you. "Well, mossstly. There'sss ssstill
 one thing the massster needsss from you."
 "But his instructions said---"
 "I know what he ssssaid." It pauses. "It was sssupposssed to be a
 sssurprissse, but the massster told me to give you hisss old
 ssspellbook. You know, asss a sssort of good-luck charm before the
 announsssement this afternoon."
 "Oh," you say, embarrassed. "That's very kind of him."
 "He hasss a sssoft ssspot for lossst causssesss. Now, follow me," it
 says, flying off to the north.

 You notice with apprehension that it's starting to get late. If you're
 going to pull off some clever trick before the ceremony at noon, you'd
 better hurry.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 The tower's library is wonderful. You spent the first two weeks as Dr.
 Mortemain's apprentice here, grudgingly falling asleep early each
 morning after spending the day and night reading through the mountain
 of the books piled around the room. Even now, you've only covered a
 small fraction of the maze of tipping bookcases that stretch to the
 ceiling and crowd around the reading area. In this quiet and
 undisturbed area, redolent of old books, you've spent the happiest
 part of your year in the tower. If you have to leave, exits lead in
 all four directions to the other wings.

 Flux perches on the lectern, hissing excitedly.

 A lectern stands in an empty space near the center of the room.

 "Come on, come on," squeaks Flux, flying off to the east.

>go east

 You follow Flux through the doorway and arrive at the base of the
 tower's central staircase. As you begin to climb upward, you hear the
 sound of breaking glass above you, followed by a heavy, muffled thump.
 Flux seems unconcerned, though, and you follow it as it glides up the
 spiral stairs. Just as you reach the third floor, a figure dressed
 completely in black and cradling a crumbling spellbook bounds down the
 stairs, narrowly avoiding crashing into you. It loses its balance and
 tumbles roughly down the remaining stairs, only to fall into a roll at
 the bottom and gracefully recover. Snatching the book from the ground
 where it had landed, the figure runs out of the tower. You dash down
 the stairs to give chase, but you only manage to get a receding
 glimpse of the figure as it runs towards the Thieves' Guild.
