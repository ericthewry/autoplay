 "You're certain that you'll be okay on your own?" he asks.

 You smile at him, tightening the pack around your waist. A slight
 laugh creeps into your voice - it's not as if you haven't done this
 before. "Yes, dear. I'll be fine. It's nothing personal, I just..."
 You take in the concerned expression on his face and your voice
 softens slightly. "I just need a break. Not from you, necessarily, but
 from everything: work, responsibilities, friends. I just need a day to
 myself, you know?"

 He nods. "Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. No worries; I get like that myself
 sometimes. Just in case something happens, what route do you plan to
 take? Your usual?"

 You nod. "Yeah. I'll head up the long way, on the Lower Mt. Cammerer
 trail, hit the Appalachian trail to get to the tower, then descend by
 going further down the AT towards Low Gap. I'll take the Low Gap trail
 back to the campground."

 He smiles at you. "Like I said, 'Your usual.'  Listen, I'll be back to
 pick you up about... Hm, what time?"

 "Well, if I were just hiking, I could be out by mid-afternoon, but I
 really want to take my time and enjoy things. I guess it gets dark
 about... what? Half past nine these days?" He nods. "I should be out
 by then. I'll meet you right back here at nine-thirty, okay?" you
 offer up your most reassuring smile.

 "Sure," he says. "I love you. Be careful, and have a great hike."

 With that, he kisses you lightly on the lips and gets back in the car.
 He waves out the driver's side window and heads off toward the north
 end of the parking lot, towards home. Soon, the car is out of sight
 entirely.

 Hiker Parking
 Standing alone at the edge of the deserted parking lot, you take in a
 deep breath of fresh air and glance about. An inviting trail beckons
 from the forest to the east; that path quickly curves among the
 hemlocks and out of sight. Two roads depart from the parking lot: one
 leads north, towards home, the other south, toward the campground not
 quite half a mile distant.

 Today's hike is one you've done many times before, and you're
 intimately familiar with the ground you'll cover. You know without the
 aid of a map that you can proceed either east or south, and that
 either route will bring you toward the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail. From
 there it's a slow and steady climb to the fire tower.

 You are carrying:
   some socks (being worn)
   some hiking shorts (being worn)
   a shirt (being worn)
   some hiking boots (being worn)
   a hip pack (being worn and closed)
   a watch (being worn)

>set forest on fire
 I only understood you as far as wanting to set the forest.

>search for ticks
 You can't see any such thing.

 Modesty (and probably a law about public indecency) prevent you from
 following through on this idea, no matter how hot you might be.

>examine watch
 You glance down at your watch, a rather chunky and unstylish
 accoutrement purchased for fifteen dollars at the drugstore. Fashion
 critiques aside, it's a functional, water-resistant, glow in the dark
 timepiece.

 At present, it indicates that the time is 7:02 AM.

 You glance down and the first thing you see are your hiking boots.
 They're serious hiking boots - eight inches high, all leather exterior
 with Gore-Tex lining; so long as you don't walk through water more
 than, say, seven or seven and a half inches deep, your feet will stay
 dry. These boots consume most of your lower calves in a rather
 unladylike but not altogether unattractive way, and bits of your thick
 Thorlo socks are just visible.

 Your legs, feminine but muscular, are revealed to the world because
 you're wearing shorts, which, let's be honest, is probably silly,
 because you'll no doubt end up covered in bug bites and scratches, but
 it's sooo warm and you simply couldn't resist - it will give you
 something to complain about tomorrow, but only to the people who won't
 say, "Why didn't you wear pants?"

 At any rate, a long sleeved t-shirt rounds out the ensemble. You're
 comfortable, and you're ready to hike.

>what's the weather?
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 You don't know what you'd do without your wonderful hip pack on day
 hikes like this. It's compact, it's capable of carrying everything you
 could really need (even in an emergency), it holds a water bottle, and
 it's your favorite color (green!).

 A slight breeze blows out of the east.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>remove watch
 You take off the watch.

>look

 Hiker Parking
 The hiker parking area is where people generally leave their cars
 while exploring the nearby trail system in the national park, but this
 morning it's devoid of vehicles. A grassy hill, recently mown, lines
 the western edge of the parking lot, while a forest abuts it to the
 east. From the parking lot there are two roads: one departing north,
 toward the park exit, and one leading south toward the campground just
 under half a mile away. A trail enters the woods to the east, quickly
 disappearing amongst the hemlocks.

 For your hike, you can proceed either east or south. Either route will
 take you to the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail.

>go east
 You put your watch back on before walking away, just to make certain
 that you don't lose it.

 You decide it's best to leave the pavement as quickly as possible, and
 opt for the trail into the woods. The path, lined with wildflowers,
 curves south, then southeast, before joining with the Lower Mt.
 Cammerer trail.

 Trail Junction (Lower Mt. Cammerer & Access trails)
 You're standing at the junction of two trails, and two signs are
 nailed to a single post here to orient you. The Lower Mt. Cammerer
 trail heads northeast, toward the Sutton Ridge Overlook and,
 eventually, to the Appalachian Trail. Alternately, the trail continues
 southwest toward the campground, about two tenths of a mile away. A
 second trail, unnamed, runs northwest, toward the parking area where
 you began, or southeast, toward the Low Gap Trail.

 A patch of yellow flowers is growing at the base of the signpost.

>trample flowers
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>tramble flowers
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>take flowers
>pick flowers
 As much as you might love to pick some of the flowers, you'd prefer to
 leave them for the next hiker to enjoy. And besides, this is a
 National Park; things should be left untouched and in their natural
 state so that everyone can enjoy the beauty. There are flowers to pick
 in the garden back home.

 Their delicate beauty makes up for the lack of scent.

>jump
>examine nw
 You jump up and down, but the weight of your pack banging around on
 your hips is rather uncomfortable, so you quickly cease your hopping.

 An insect lights upon your ear, but a wave of your hand sends it away.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine path
 You're standing at the junction of two trails, one running
 northwest-southeast, the other running northeast-southwest. At the
 north corner of the junction, two signs are nailed to a single post
 indicating where each trail leads.

>explore!
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine signs
 There are two signs on the post. The uppermost sign faces southeast,
 and is oriented so that you know it pertains to the trail that runs
 northeast-southwest; it reads:

 LOWER MOUNT CAMMERER TRAIL
 &lt; Cosby Campground 0.2

 The other sign faces southwest and pertains to the access trail from
 the parking lot, which has no name; the sign reads:

 &lt;- Hiker Parking 0.4

 Trail Junction (Lower Mt. Cammerer & Access trails)
 You're standing at the junction of two trails, one running
 northwest-southeast, the other running northeast-southwest. At the
 north corner of the junction, two signs are nailed to a single post
 indicating where each trail leads.

>go northwest
 You take a look at the trail sign and confirm that that way just leads
 back to the parking area where you began. Your route heads northeast,
 up the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail.

>go northeast
 You head northeast. A quarter mile or so down the path you encounter a
 shallow stream, easily crossed by hopping from one rock to the next
 without getting your boots wet.

 Before long, the trail narrows from a road to a trail. The vegetation
 closes in on each side as well as overhead, forming a darkened tunnel
 of rhododendron. It's a pleasant stroll along this section, quiet,
 with only the smallest shafts of sunlight penetrating the thick
 canopy, but you're evidently the first person to break trail today and
 you keep hitting unseen strands of spider web. Eventually the tunnel
 disappears, the canopy opens up, and as you pick the last wispy cob
 web from your hiking shorts, you notice that you've arrived at the
 footbridge.

 Tom's Creek
 Sunlight pours forth into a large opening in the trees here,
 illuminating bits of pollen floating in the air and sparkling on the
 surface of Tom's Creek. The stream flows northwest, gurgling beneath a
 rustic but sturdy log footbridge.

 You hear the distinctive sound of a woodpecker in the distance.

>examine stream
 Tom's Creek is wide, perhaps thirty feet across, and sufficiently deep
 enough to merit the presence of a foot bridge. The water slides over
 rocks, slips over semi-submerged boulders into small white cascades,
 pauses near the bank in tiny eddies, and seemingly stops in darkened
 pools. Eventually, it flows off to the northwest, giggling and
 whispering its secrets to the forest as it goes.

>taste stream
 You're sure the cold, clear water would taste fantastic, but you also
 know that it might make you sick. Looks are deceiving, and despite its
 clarity there might be bacteria present. You've no filter, no way to
 boil it, and besides all that, you have some perfectly acceptable
 water in your water bottle.

>stalk bear
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>enter stream
 You splash your boots about at the edge of the stream, but ultimately
 decide to stand on the bank so as to keep from accidentally getting
 your socks wet. You forgot to bring a spare pair. You forgot a few
 things in your rush to get out the door. Oh well.

>what else did I forget?
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>look

 Tom's Creek
 Tom's Creek flows across the path here, beneath a sturdy log
 footbridge. The path continues on the other side of the bridge, to the
 northeast.

>examine log
 The stream is fairly wide and a bit too deep to cross without getting
 your socks wet, and so a foot bridge has been installed. It's a simple
 structure, half of a log with its flat side facing up for a walking
 surface. A hand rail affixed to one side allows will help you maintain
 your balance as you cross. It's functional, yet blends in well with
 the natural surroundings.

>cross
 It would be best to keep to the trail, which continues to the
 northeast.

>go northeast
 You climb onto the footbridge over Tom's Creek, walk halfway across,
 and pause. One hand on the railing for balance, you close your eyes,
 feel the coolness of the water running beneath you, and concentrate on
 the sound of the water as it ripples along over unseen rocks. You
 stand there for perhaps two minutes, enjoying the water's song, but
 eventually the cool air coming off the creek is too much for your
 uncovered legs and you decide to continue up the trail.

 After walking about a third of a mile, you come to a trail junction.

 Spur Trail to Sutton Ridge
 The trail crests the first of many ridges along the northern side of
 Mt. Cammerer here. Sutton Ridge, as it's called, is dry and exposed -
 perhaps not the loveliest spot for a rest break. But from here, a tiny
 spur trial scrambles up the ridge to the southeast, and the clearing
 at the top generally provides an lovely view of the surrounding
 mountains.

 You pause to contemplate whether you'd like to check out the spur
 trail, or to simply continue east, toward the fire tower.

>se
 You decide to make the scramble up to the overlook. It's only
 two-hundred yards, but the climb is steep and leaves you winded once
 you reach the top.

 Sutton Ridge Overlook
 The Sutton Ridge Overlook is a very formal name for a very informal
 clearing on the side of a hill. The ground here remains bare from
 people such as yourself coming up here to take in the view; evenings
 in particular are a great time to visit, because this is a wonderful
 vantage point from which to take in the sunset over Gabes Mountain,
 across the valley to the west. Though perhaps not quite so stunning as
 at sunset, the clearing is still quite beautiful during the day. To
 the north, the Cosby Valley stretches out lush and green, and mountain
 laurel dots the surrounding hillsides, pink and in full bloom. Galax
 and arbutus line the edges of the clearing at ground level.

 You sit down on the ground in the clearing to catch your breath and
 take in the view.

>examine valley
 The Cosby Valley rests between Mt. Cammerer and Gabes Mountain, lush
 and green. Though you can't see within its depths, you know that the
 Pigeon River courses along its floor, far below you.

>examine galax
 The galax is a lovely shade of green with round, waxy leaves. They
 stay green all winter.

>stand
 You get back up and brush off your clothes. Break's over.

>examine ground
 The ground, where it lacks vegetation, is brown and dry.

>l down
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>go down
 You work your way carefully down the steep spur trail.

 Spur Trail to Sutton Ridge
 You're standing at a bend in the trail on the crest of Sutton Ridge.
 The trail turns from south to east here, and a spur trail scrambles
 through the arbutus and galax to the southeast.

>examine spur trail
 You can't see any such thing.

>go up
 Mrm... no, you've already had that diversion. Probably best to trek on
 east, toward the fire tower.

>go east
 You leave the spur trail behind and head down the eastern side of the
 ridge. The path is a long, narrow straightaway, and the walking is
 easy. After less than a quarter mile you come to a lovely little
 waterfall, and pause to admire its beauty.

 Riding Fork Creek
 Whereas Sutton Ridge was a high spot, dry and exposed, this is a tiny
 creek draw between two ridges. Riding Fork Creek cascades down a
 series of mossy dark gray rocks here, southeast of the trail. You can
 continue on toward the fire tower by hopping across the creek to the
 north.

 A gentle breeze brushes your skin.

>examine waterfall
 Riding Fork Creek may be small, but that doesn't make it any less
 majestic: a narrow stream of water tumbles down over a series of
 chiseled, squarish, dark grey rocks, almost like a contrived fountain,
 and yet it's natural.

 You feel the coolness coming off the water and close your eyes. A
 smile touches your lips, and you breathe in the refreshingly chilled
 air. You take a moment to contemplate how even in the driest of years
 this tiny stream persists, flowing ever on, regardless of who's here
 to admire its beauty. You think like that sometimes... wondering about
 purpose, about process. About the way in which everything moves on
 regardless of your presence or concerns.

>think about purpose
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>think
 You take a moment to consider your next move.

 A gnat is momentarily caught in your eyelashes, but you blink it away.

>go east
 The ridge climbs sharply upward in that direction, with no path. You'd
 tear up a great deal of vegetation trying to make the climb. It would
 be better, perhaps, to remain on the trail. From here, you can go
 north.

>go north
 You cross Riding Fork Creek and continue weaving over and between
 ridges, making the long, slow climb along the northern face of Mt.
 Cammerer.

 After a mile and a half or so, you come to Campsite 35, the only
 developed backcountry campsite along the trail today. There's no one
 present, so you rest at one of the scorched fire rings, nibble on some
 trail mix, and watch a squirrel as he goes about his business.

 After a pleasant break, you continue on toward the tower. The gradual
 nature of the climb gives way to a steeper ascent, and after an
 additional two and three-quarter miles, you reach the next landmark of
 today's hike.

 Trail Junction (Lower Mt Cammerer and Appalachian trails)
 The Lower Mt. Cammerer trail ends here at a junction with the famous
 Appalachian Trail. Commonly referred to simply as the "AT," the trail
 covers nearly the entire length of the Appalachian Mountains, from
 Maine to Georgia - a distance of over two thousand miles. You wish
 that you'd taken a summer off during college to hike the length of it,
 but there's no point in regretting that now. There's always retirement
 to look forward to, right? You sigh wistfully at the thought and plop
 down onto the ground among the roots of a large tulip poplar growing
 in the center of the junction.

 The AT runs east-west here. According to the sign, it's only another
 three miles to the tower.

 A gentle breeze caresses your skin.

>go east
 You'll have to get off the ground first.

>stand
 You get back up and brush off your clothes. Break's over.

>look

 Trail Junction (Lower Mt Cammerer and Appalachian trails)
 The AT climbs from east to west here, ascending toward the peak of the
 mountain and the fire tower. The Lower Mt. Cammerer trail, from which
 you accessed the AT, descends out of the junction to the northwest.

 A sudden explosion of sound to your right alerts you to the presence
 of a grouse. As you stand there with your hand to your chest it flies
 off, equally as startled by your presence.

>examine grouse
 You don't see any grouse just now.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go west
 You look uphill at the rather intimidating stretch of steep trail,
 tighten your pack about your waist, and let out a long, slow breath.
 You've done this stretch many, many times, but no matter how in shape
 you get it always tends to kick your ass. Oh well, half begun is half
 done (or some stupid clich?).

 The trail is a steep mess of tree roots and rock, and for the next two
 and a half miles you feel as if you're working out on a gigantic
 natural stairmaster, dragging your heavy feet up one step at a time.
 You plow along like that with your head down for over an hour, your
 gaze rarely if ever straying from your boots to prevent tripping.
 Mercifully, you reach the next trail junction.

 Trail Junction (Appalachian and Mt. Cammerer Trails)
 The trail is wide here, with lots of bare ground from so many hikers
 having rested in this location before you. There's little to see here,
 really, save for the trail sign that benevolently announces that
 you're very close to your goal.

 The wind picks up for a moment, cooling your skin in the growing heat
 of the day.

>go west
 There appear to be only woods in that direction, with no path among
 the trees. The AT continues to the southwest, or you can visit the
 fire tower by heading north.

>go north
 You set off toward the fire tower. The trail runs along the top of a
 rocky ridge, but it's well-used and, for the most part, easily walked.
 The last few feet are a bit of a scramble, but you effortlessly manage
 the boulders and find yourself standing triumphantly on the porch of
 the fire tower.

 Mt. Cammerer, Outside the Fire Tower
 The Mt. Cammerer fire tower sits atop a jagged, rocky peak with a
 commanding view of the surrounding mountains. It's a fantastic
 location for such a structure, really, because you can see for miles
 in every direction and it would be easy to spot a plume of smoke,
 particularly if you used binoculars.

 You lean against the railing and take in the landscape. Gorgeous, and
 so worth the effort.

 A hawk cries in the sky above you, momentarily drawing your attention.

>examine hawk
 The hawk circles high overhead, seemingly without effort.

>fly
 You wish to have the freedom of a bird. Why not settle for the freedom
 of your feet?

>go down
 You take a quick peek over the edge of the railing and decide that
 falling to the rocks below might be bad for your health.

>go south
 Fortunately, the railing prevents you from toppling over the edge
 toward certain injury and possible death. You can leave the tower by
 going southwest.

>look

 Mt. Cammerer, Outside the Fire Tower
 The fire tower has a commanding view of the surrounding mountains. You
 can enter the tower or simply return back the way you came. The trail
 departs to the southwest.

>examine mountains
 You walk to the railing, lean against it, and take in the view. It's a
 wonderfully clear day, and it feels as if you're able to see the
 entire world from here - mountain after mountain, sprawling to the
 horizon. You can see Webb Mountain to the north, where your house is
 nestled somewhere in the trees. Beyond is Bays Mountain and, further
 still and slightly west, Clinch Mountain.

 You walk around the tower and look to the east. Snowbird Mountain lies
 just the other side of the Pigeon River gorge. Beyond that, the Unakas
 and, further still, the Blue Ridge.

 Traversing the porch to the south, you see the Mt. Sterling Lookout on
 a distant ridge, barely visible without binoculars.

 Finally, you step to the western railing and look out onto peaks of
 whose names you are not certain. The names aren't important, really,
 merely random designations of natural landmarks. First the Cherokee
 gave them names, then the Europeans, and perhaps someday someone else
 will call them something new. But the mountains will endure
 regardless. Or so you hope.

 A small purple butterfly flits across the trail in front of you and
 disappears among the trees.

>go southwest
 Having enjoyed a pleasant break in the company of an amazing view, you
 decide to start back toward home.

 Trail Junction (Appalachian and Mt. Cammerer Trails)
 The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, continuing on toward Low
 Gap. A trail sign announces that the Mt. Cammerer fire tower is
 located just over half a mile to the north.

 A tiny chipmunk climbs to the top of a nearby rock, chatters in your
 general direction, then bounces away.

>go east
 There appear to be only woods in that direction, with no path among
 the trees. The AT continues to the southwest, or you can visit the
 fire tower by heading north.

>go north
 Nah... you've already been there, done that, and heading back out to
 the tower would add an additional mile to your hike, which, quite
 frankly, is long enough already. Best to head back to the parking lot
 now. The AT departs to the southwest, toward Low Gap.

>und
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>undo

 [Previous turn undone.]

>undo

>\u
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 You recommence climbing the Appalachian Trail. Just as with the
 previous stretch, it's littered with roots and rocks and excessive
 steepness, and makes you not such a happy hiker. "Oh well," you think
 to yourself, "it's making me stronger. Stronger. Yes. Stronger."  You
 continue this rather ineffective little pep talk for about a half a
 mile, at which point the trail graciously levels out along the crest
 of a ridge.

 You find an easy, confident pace, and begin to notice how effortlessly
 your legs move on this type of terrain. The lack of obstructions in
 the trail allows you to take in the view as you hike, and incredible
 mountain vistas are present on both sides of the trail for a short
 while - successive waves of blue, smoky ridges trailing off into the
 distance.

 After a bit, the trail begins to descend off the ridge and into the
 trees... gradually at first, then steeper, and your pace finds a
 decrescendo as you carefully navigate the slope. Many people prefer a
 strenuous uphill to this, because descending can be fairly hard on
 your knees and ankles, but after the beating your lungs and legs took
 on the AT earlier, you are inclined to respectfully disagree.

 After a total walk of just over two miles, you encounter another trail
 junction.

 Trail Junction (Appalachian and Low Gap trails)
 Two trails cross here, in the center of what's called Low Gap, so
 named because it's the lowest pass through the mountains for over
 fifty miles if you were traveling along the Appalachian Trail headed
 north. The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, climbing toward
 Cosby Knob and beyond - all the way to Georgia. The Low Gap trail
 crosses perpendicular to the AT, descending in both directions:
 southeast, toward Walnut Bottoms and Big Creek, or northwest, toward
 the Cosby Campground and, for you, home.

 A sign at one side of the junction points the way and provides the
 mileage to nearby landmarks.

 Your socks have shifted uncomfortably in your boots, so you take a
 seat in the clearing to readjust them. Once you're finished, you
 decide the ground feels good enough to simply rest there for a bit.

 A cool breeze builds momentarily from the east, cooling your skin.

 "You're certain that you'll be okay on your own?" he asks.

 You smile at him, tightening the pack around your waist. A slight
 laugh creeps into your voice - it's not as if you haven't done this
 before. "Yes, dear. I'll be fine. It's nothing personal, I just..."
 You take in the concerned expression on his face and your voice
 softens slightly. "I just need a break. Not from you, necessarily, but
 from everything: work, responsibilities, friends. I just need a day to
 myself, you know?"

 He nods. "Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. No worries; I get like that myself
 sometimes. Just in case something happens, what route do you plan to
 take? Your usual?"

 You nod. "Yeah. I'll head up the long way, on the Lower Mt. Cammerer
 trail, hit the Appalachian trail to get to the tower, then descend by
 going further down the AT towards Low Gap. I'll take the Low Gap trail
 back to the campground."

 He smiles at you. "Like I said, 'Your usual.'  Listen, I'll be back to
 pick you up about... Hm, what time?"

 "Well, if I were just hiking, I could be out by mid-afternoon, but I
 really want to take my time and enjoy things. I guess it gets dark
 about... what? Half past nine these days?" He nods. "I should be out
 by then. I'll meet you right back here at nine-thirty, okay?" you
 offer up your most reassuring smile.

 "Sure," he says. "I love you. Be careful, and have a great hike."

 With that, he kisses you lightly on the lips and gets back in the car.
 He waves out the driver's side window and heads off toward the north
 end of the parking lot, towards home. Soon, the car is out of sight
 entirely.

 Hiker Parking
 Standing alone at the edge of the deserted parking lot, you take in a
 deep breath of fresh air and glance about. An inviting trail beckons
 from the forest to the east; that path quickly curves among the
 hemlocks and out of sight. Two roads depart from the parking lot: one
 leads north, towards home, the other south, toward the campground not
 quite half a mile distant.

 Today's hike is one you've done many times before, and you're
 intimately familiar with the ground you'll cover. You know without the
 aid of a map that you can proceed either east or south, and that
 either route will bring you toward the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail. From
 there it's a slow and steady climb to the fire tower.

>go south
 As you enter the campground, you realize that it's early yet - none of
 the campers seem to be stirring. You attempt to make as little noise
 as possible with your boots against the pavement, and after about four
 tenths of a mile you reach the trailhead.

 Lower Mt. Cammerer Trailhead
 You're standing at the edge of the road on the eastern edge of the
 Cosby Campground. A familiar wooden sign, painted brown with bright
 white lettering stands here, just off the pavement and to the left of
 the trail. As with all of the National Park Service's trail signs, it
 gives you the name of the trail and the distance to the nearest
 important junctions. This one reads:

 LOWER MOUNT CAMMERER TRAIL
 Low Gap Trail 0.2
 Sutton Ridge Overlook 1.4
 Appalachian Trail 7.5

 The dirt trail is wide enough here to accommodate a full-size vehicle,
 and begins behind a locked gate.

 A slight breeze blows out of the east.

>look

 Lower Mt. Cammerer Trailhead
 A standard NPS trail sign indicates that the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail
 begins here, leaving the pavement and entering the woods to the
 northeast.

>go northeast
 You step behind the gate and begin walking the wide trail. Tire tracks
 are evident here and there where the soil is softer; the rangers have
 been back here recently for some reason. There's a gentle uphill
 grade, though it's barely noticeable, and before too long you come to
 another trail sign.

 Trail Junction (Lower Mt. Cammerer & Access trails)
 You're standing at the junction of two trails, and two signs are
 nailed to a single post here to orient you. The Lower Mt. Cammerer
 trail heads northeast, toward the Sutton Ridge Overlook and,
 eventually, to the Appalachian Trail. Alternately, the trail continues
 southwest toward the campground, about two tenths of a mile away. A
 second trail, unnamed, runs northwest, toward the parking area where
 you began, or southeast, toward the Low Gap Trail.

 A patch of yellow flowers is growing at the base of the signpost.

>go northeast
 You head northeast. A quarter mile or so down the path you encounter a
 shallow stream, easily crossed by hopping from one rock to the next
 without getting your boots wet.

 Before long, the trail narrows from a road to a trail. The vegetation
 closes in on each side as well as overhead, forming a darkened tunnel
 of rhododendron. It's a pleasant stroll along this section, quiet,
 with only the smallest shafts of sunlight penetrating the thick
 canopy, but you're evidently the first person to break trail today and
 you keep hitting unseen strands of spider web. Eventually the tunnel
 disappears, the canopy opens up, and as you pick the last wispy cob
 web from your hiking shorts, you notice that you've arrived at the
 footbridge.

 Tom's Creek
 Sunlight pours forth into a large opening in the trees here,
 illuminating bits of pollen floating in the air and sparkling on the
 surface of Tom's Creek. The stream flows northwest, gurgling beneath a
 rustic but sturdy log footbridge.

 You hear the distinctive sound of a woodpecker in the distance.

>go north
 The water appears to be too deep to cross in that direction. It's
 perhaps best to instead use the footbridge.

>cross
 It would be best to keep to the trail, which continues to the
 northeast.

>go northeast
 You climb onto the footbridge over Tom's Creek, walk halfway across,
 and pause. One hand on the railing for balance, you close your eyes,
 feel the coolness of the water running beneath you, and concentrate on
 the sound of the water as it ripples along over unseen rocks. You
 stand there for perhaps two minutes, enjoying the water's song, but
 eventually the cool air coming off the creek is too much for your
 uncovered legs and you decide to continue up the trail.

 After walking about a third of a mile, you come to a trail junction.

 Spur Trail to Sutton Ridge
 The trail crests the first of many ridges along the northern side of
 Mt. Cammerer here. Sutton Ridge, as it's called, is dry and exposed -
 perhaps not the loveliest spot for a rest break. But from here, a tiny
 spur trial scrambles up the ridge to the southeast, and the clearing
 at the top generally provides an lovely view of the surrounding
 mountains.

 You pause to contemplate whether you'd like to check out the spur
 trail, or to simply continue east, toward the fire tower.

>go up
 You decide to make the scramble up to the overlook. It's only
 two-hundred yards, but the climb is steep and leaves you winded once
 you reach the top.

 Sutton Ridge Overlook
 The Sutton Ridge Overlook is a very formal name for a very informal
 clearing on the side of a hill. The ground here remains bare from
 people such as yourself coming up here to take in the view; evenings
 in particular are a great time to visit, because this is a wonderful
 vantage point from which to take in the sunset over Gabes Mountain,
 across the valley to the west. Though perhaps not quite so stunning as
 at sunset, the clearing is still quite beautiful during the day. To
 the north, the Cosby Valley stretches out lush and green, and mountain
 laurel dots the surrounding hillsides, pink and in full bloom. Galax
 and arbutus line the edges of the clearing at ground level.

 You sit down on the ground in the clearing to catch your breath and
 take in the view.

>stand
 You get back up and brush off your clothes. Break's over.

>go down
 You work your way carefully down the steep spur trail.

 Spur Trail to Sutton Ridge
 You're standing at a bend in the trail on the crest of Sutton Ridge.
 The trail turns from south to east here, and a spur trail scrambles
 through the arbutus and galax to the southeast.

>go east
 You leave the spur trail behind and head down the eastern side of the
 ridge. The path is a long, narrow straightaway, and the walking is
 easy. After less than a quarter mile you come to a lovely little
 waterfall, and pause to admire its beauty.

 Riding Fork Creek
 Whereas Sutton Ridge was a high spot, dry and exposed, this is a tiny
 creek draw between two ridges. Riding Fork Creek cascades down a
 series of mossy dark gray rocks here, southeast of the trail. You can
 continue on toward the fire tower by hopping across the creek to the
 north.

>go north
 You cross Riding Fork Creek and continue weaving over and between
 ridges, making the long, slow climb along the northern face of Mt.
 Cammerer.

 After a mile and a half or so, you come to Campsite 35, the only
 developed backcountry campsite along the trail today. There's no one
 present, so you rest at one of the scorched fire rings, nibble on some
 trail mix, and watch a squirrel as he goes about his business.

 After a pleasant break, you continue on toward the tower. The gradual
 nature of the climb gives way to a steeper ascent, and after an
 additional two and three-quarter miles, you reach the next landmark of
 today's hike.

 Trail Junction (Lower Mt Cammerer and Appalachian trails)
 The Lower Mt. Cammerer trail ends here at a junction with the famous
 Appalachian Trail. Commonly referred to simply as the "AT," the trail
 covers nearly the entire length of the Appalachian Mountains, from
 Maine to Georgia - a distance of over two thousand miles. You wish
 that you'd taken a summer off during college to hike the length of it,
 but there's no point in regretting that now. There's always retirement
 to look forward to, right? You sigh wistfully at the thought and plop
 down onto the ground among the roots of a large tulip poplar growing
 in the center of the junction.

 The AT runs east-west here. According to the sign, it's only another
 three miles to the tower.

 In the distance, you hear a woodpecker's familiar drilling.

>examine sign
 There are two signs on the post. The uppermost sign faces south, and
 is oriented so that you know it pertains to the trail that runs
 east-west; it reads:

 APPALACHIAN TRAIL
 &lt;- Mt Cammerer Fire Tower 2.9
 &lt;- Low Gap 4.4

 The other sign faces west and reads:

 LOWER MT CAMMERER TRAIL
 &lt;- Cosby Campground 7.5

 Seven and a half miles back to the campground and parking area...
 you've already come quite a way!

>go east
 You'll have to get off the ground first.

>stand
 You get back up and brush off your clothes. Break's over.

>go west
 You look uphill at the rather intimidating stretch of steep trail,
 tighten your pack about your waist, and let out a long, slow breath.
 You've done this stretch many, many times, but no matter how in shape
 you get it always tends to kick your ass. Oh well, half begun is half
 done (or some stupid clich?).

 The trail is a steep mess of tree roots and rock, and for the next two
 and a half miles you feel as if you're working out on a gigantic
 natural stairmaster, dragging your heavy feet up one step at a time.
 You plow along like that with your head down for over an hour, your
 gaze rarely if ever straying from your boots to prevent tripping.
 Mercifully, you reach the next trail junction.

 Trail Junction (Appalachian and Mt. Cammerer Trails)
 The trail is wide here, with lots of bare ground from so many hikers
 having rested in this location before you. There's little to see here,
 really, save for the trail sign that benevolently announces that
 you're very close to your goal.

 A previously-camouflaged spadefoot toad hops off trail and disappears
 again amongst the leaves.

>examine toad
 You've seen a few amphibians here and there, but you don't see any
 just now.

 You hear a sound in the underbrush off to your left, but see nothing.

>go north
 You set off toward the fire tower. The trail runs along the top of a
 rocky ridge, but it's well-used and, for the most part, easily walked.
 The last few feet are a bit of a scramble, but you effortlessly manage
 the boulders and find yourself standing triumphantly on the porch of
 the fire tower.

 Mt. Cammerer, Outside the Fire Tower
 The Mt. Cammerer fire tower sits atop a jagged, rocky peak with a
 commanding view of the surrounding mountains. It's a fantastic
 location for such a structure, really, because you can see for miles
 in every direction and it would be easy to spot a plume of smoke,
 particularly if you used binoculars.

 You lean against the railing and take in the landscape. Gorgeous, and
 so worth the effort.

 A hawk cries in the sky above you, momentarily drawing your attention.

 The wind picks up for a moment, cooling your skin in the growing heat
 of the day.

>enter
 You open the door to the fire tower and walk inside, closing it behind
 you.

 Within the Fire Tower
 The interior of the fire tower is simple and unadorned. A plain wooden
 floor stretches from wall to wall, and windows stretch from about
 waist high to just short of the ceiling. Despite the sun, the warmth
 of the day, and the large windows that allow a 360-degree view of the
 surrounding landscape, the air is surprisingly cool inside the tower,
 no doubt due to the stone foundation you saw outside. You're thankful
 for the break from the heat.

>look through window
 You walk to the edge of the room, lean gently against the window, and
 take in the view. It's a wonderfully clear day, and it feels as if
 you're able to see the entire world from here - mountain after
 mountain, sprawling to the horizon. You can see Webb Mountain to the
 north, where your house is nestled somewhere in the trees. Beyond is
 Bays Mountain and, further still and slightly west, Clinch Mountain.

 You turn and walk across the room a bit, and look to the east.
 Snowbird Mountain lies just the other side of the Pigeon River gorge.
 Beyond that, the Unakas and, further still, the Blue Ridge.

 Turning south, you see the Mt. Sterling Lookout on a distant ridge,
 barely visible without binoculars.

 Finally, you step to the western portion of the room and look out onto
 peaks of whose names you are not certain. The names aren't important,
 really, merely random designations of natural landmarks. First the
 Cherokee gave them names, then the Europeans, and perhaps someday
 someone else will call them something new. But the mountains will
 endure regardless. Or so you hope.

>examine webb mountain
 The mountain is a sea of trees, dark green waves rolling over a
 weathered landscape. These mountains are considered by some to be less
 majestic than the Rockies or other, younger, unweathered mountain
 chains, but you think of them as wise and old, containing secrets.

>examine bays maountain
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine clinch mountain
 The mountain is a sea of trees, dark green waves rolling over a
 weathered landscape. These mountains are considered by some to be less
 majestic than the Rockies or other, younger, unweathered mountain
 chains, but you think of them as wise and old, containing secrets.

>examine blue ridge
 The mountain is a sea of trees, dark green waves rolling over a
 weathered landscape. These mountains are considered by some to be less
 majestic than the Rockies or other, younger, unweathered mountain
 chains, but you think of them as wise and old, containing secrets.

>look

 floor stretches from wall to wall, and windows stretch from about
 waist high to just short of the ceiling. Despite the sun, the warmth

>eat mix
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   some socks (being worn)
   some hiking shorts (being worn)
   a shirt (being worn)
   some hiking boots (being worn)
   a hip pack (being worn and closed)
   a watch (being worn)

>open pack
 You wiggle around a bit, and manage to pull the zipper open. It's so
 much easier to do that when you're not actually wearing the thing.

>look in pack
 In the hip pack are a headlamp, a first aid kit, a water bottle and a
 massive bag of trail mix.

>reduce mass of trail mix bag
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>eat trail mix
 (first taking the massive bag of trail mix)
 It's sort of difficult to get stuff out of your pack when you're still
 wearing it, but somehow you manage to get your hands on the trail mix.

>eat trail mix
 You snack on a few bites of the trail mix.

>examine it
 It's a massive bag of trail mix, full of all sorts of goodies. Not the
 sort of food one would want to rely on for sustenance all the time,
 but it'll provide plenty of energy for today's hike.

>smell it
 The bag emits an aroma of yummy nutty goodness. Mmmm.

 For the first time, you realize that the sun is now directly overhead.

>put it in pack
 You seal the bag of trail mix and tuck it neatly away in your pack.

>close pack
 You wiggle around a bit, and manage to pull the zipper closed. It's so
 much easier to do that when you're not actually wearing the thing.

>stretch
 What do you want to stretch?

>stretch calves
 Your calves feel a bit tight, so you walk over to a nearby tree and
 place your palms against the bark, enjoying the rough texture beneath
 your hands. You bend your left leg in a lunge and step back with your
 right foot, leg straight. Closing your eyes, you take a pleasantly
 deep breath and wait for some of the tension to subside in your calf,
 which it does.

 After stretching both legs a couple of times, you decide it's probably
 time to move on down the trail.

>examine socks
 Your Thorlos are designed specifically for hiking, with extra padding
 beneath the heel and ball of your foot for comfort. This particular
 pair of Thorlos are white; just the very tops of them are visible.

>smell feet
 The exterior off the boots smell like leather. You'd rather not smell
 in the inside of the boots.

>smell armpit
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine shirt
 You're wearing a dark brown long-sleeved t-shirt, the color of
 chocolate. It's cotton, which isn't always a wise thing to wear when
 hiking - fantastic when it's hot, but is miserable in the rain -
 however there's a brilliant blue sky and a favorable forecast, so
 you're risking it.

>smell shirt
 You glance at the sun climbing in the sky, then lift your arm and take
 a sniff of your arm pit. Not too bad... yet.

>out
 You open the door to the fire tower and walk out onto the porch,
 closing it behind you.

 Mt. Cammerer, Outside the Fire Tower
 The fire tower has a commanding view of the surrounding mountains. You
 can enter the tower or simply return back the way you came. The trail
 departs to the southwest.

>go southwest
 Having enjoyed a pleasant break in the company of an amazing view, you
 decide to start back toward home.

 Trail Junction (Appalachian and Mt. Cammerer Trails)
 The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, continuing on toward Low
 Gap. A trail sign announces that the Mt. Cammerer fire tower is
 located just over half a mile to the north.

 A tiny chipmunk climbs to the top of a nearby rock, chatters in your
 general direction, then bounces away.

>chatter back
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>stretch hips
 You're not quite sure how to stretch those bits. Maybe you should look
 into yoga.

>stretch groin
 You can't see any such thing.

>stretch legs
 Your calves feel a bit tight, so you walk over to a nearby tree and
 place your palms against the bark, enjoying the rough texture beneath
 your hands. You bend your left leg in a lunge and step back with your
 right foot, leg straight. Closing your eyes, you take a pleasantly
 deep breath and wait for some of the tension to subside in your calf,
 which it does.

 After stretching both legs a couple of times, you decide it's probably
 time to move on down the trail.

>do some pushups
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>look

 Trail Junction (Appalachian and Mt. Cammerer Trails)
 The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, continuing on toward Low
 Gap. A trail sign announces that the Mt. Cammerer fire tower is
 located just over half a mile to the north.

>go northeast
 There appear to be only woods in that direction, with no path among
 the trees. The AT continues to the southwest, or you can visit the
 fire tower by heading north.

>go southwest
 You recommence climbing the Appalachian Trail. Just as with the
 previous stretch, it's littered with roots and rocks and excessive
 steepness, and makes you not such a happy hiker. "Oh well," you think
 to yourself, "it's making me stronger. Stronger. Yes. Stronger."  You
 continue this rather ineffective little pep talk for about a half a
 mile, at which point the trail graciously levels out along the crest
 of a ridge.

 You find an easy, confident pace, and begin to notice how effortlessly
 your legs move on this type of terrain. The lack of obstructions in
 the trail allows you to take in the view as you hike, and incredible
 mountain vistas are present on both sides of the trail for a short
 while - successive waves of blue, smoky ridges trailing off into the
 distance.

 After a bit, the trail begins to descend off the ridge and into the
 trees... gradually at first, then steeper, and your pace finds a
 decrescendo as you carefully navigate the slope. Many people prefer a
 strenuous uphill to this, because descending can be fairly hard on
 your knees and ankles, but after the beating your lungs and legs took
 on the AT earlier, you are inclined to respectfully disagree.

 After a total walk of just over two miles, you encounter another trail
 junction.

 Trail Junction (Appalachian and Low Gap trails)
 Two trails cross here, in the center of what's called Low Gap, so
 named because it's the lowest pass through the mountains for over
 fifty miles if you were traveling along the Appalachian Trail headed
 north. The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, climbing toward
 Cosby Knob and beyond - all the way to Georgia. The Low Gap trail
 crosses perpendicular to the AT, descending in both directions:
 southeast, toward Walnut Bottoms and Big Creek, or northwest, toward
 the Cosby Campground and, for you, home.

 A sign at one side of the junction points the way and provides the
 mileage to nearby landmarks.

 Your socks have shifted uncomfortably in your boots, so you take a
 seat in the clearing to readjust them. Once you're finished, you
 decide the ground feels good enough to simply rest there for a bit.

 A cool breeze builds momentarily from the east, cooling your skin.

>remove boots
 You take your boots off and remove your socks. It feels great to get
 some air on your feet, but after a bit of a rest you decide it's best
 to get going again. You put your socks and boots back on, tie the
 laces securely.

>examine sign
 There are two signs on the post. The uppermost sign faces southeast,
 and is oriented so that you know it pertains to the trail that runs
 northeast-southwest; it reads:

 APPALACHIAN TRAIL
 &lt;- Cosby Knob Shelter 0.8

 The other sign faces southwest and reads:

 LOW GAP TRAIL
 &lt;- Cosby Campground 2.9

>examine roots
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine soles
 Wonderfully durable boots, size seven narrow. Their heavy leather
 exterior protects your feet from rocks and roots, they're tall for
 proper ankle support over rough terrain, the soles tend to keep you
 from slipping even on slick rocks, and they're lined with Gore-Tex to
 keep you dry. Your only complaint is that the company claims that the
 boots 'breathe,' when in fact they seem to keep your feet hot in the
 summer, freezing cold in the winter. So far, though, they're the best
 boots you've ever owned.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   some socks (being worn)
   some hiking shorts (being worn)
   a shirt (being worn)
   some hiking boots (being worn)
   a hip pack (being worn and closed)
   a watch (being worn)

>examine watch
 You glance down at your watch, a rather chunky and unstylish
 accoutrement purchased for fifteen dollars at the drugstore. Fashion
 critiques aside, it's a functional, water-resistant, glow in the dark
 timepiece.

 At present, it indicates that the time is 1:59 PM.

 The sun seems to glare down upon you, hot and unrelenting. When will
 it start to sink in the sky? Mid-afternoon is always the harshest time
 of day to be hiking on a clear day.

>exits
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>look

 Trail Junction (Appalachian and Low Gap trails) (on the ground)
 You stand in the center of Low Gap, where two trails intersect. For
 the Appalachian Trail, this is a low spot, and the trail climbs both
 to the southwest, toward Cosby Knob, and northeast, back toward the
 fire tower. Conversely, this is high spot on the Low Gap trail, which
 descends into Walnut Bottoms to the southeast and, to the northwest,
 toward home.

>go southwest
 You'll have to get off the ground first.

>stand
 You get back up and brush off your clothes. Break's over.

>xyzzy
 If that actually could work, you'd certainly miss out on some
 beautiful scenery.

>go southwest
 According to the sign, the AT climbs toward Cosby Knob in that
 direction. Not only is that out of your way, but it's also uphill, and
 you're just not down with anymore uphill today.

>se
 The Low Gap trail drops down into Walnut Bottoms in that direction.
 It's a lovely area, but completely out of your way. Home is in the
 opposite direction, to the northwest.

>go northwest
 With a lightness in your heart at the realization that you're on the
 downhill stretch, you set off toward the campground. At first, the
 going is rather steep, but the trail soon begins to switchback upon
 itself, snaking slowly downhill toward flatter ground. Though the
 tight switchbacks reduce the angle of descent, they also make the
 trail longer and limit the space for trees. There seems to be little
 or no shade, and the sun beats down relentlessly upon you as you
 descend the west-facing ridge. It's tempting to simply cut off-trail
 and travel crosscountry to save time, but you realize that if everyone
 did that the erosion along this ridge would be terrible.

 After about two miles, the switchbacks disappear and you find yourself
 comforted by the shade of the woods once again. The air is cool here,
 chilled further by the presence of Cosby Creek, which flows parallel
 to the path for a quarter mile or so. Larger than the other streams
 you've encountered today, Cosby Creek is full of white-foamed cascades
 and deep, dark pools. The water of the stream feeds life into the
 forest, and everything along this stretch is green and moist and
 mossy. From time to time the landscape seems rather surreal, as if
 you're strolling through a fairytale rather than a real place. After a
 time, the stream flows off into the forest, out of sight, and you're
 somewhat sad to see it go. No matter, this means you're even closer to
 home.

 The trail begins to widen, from a path to a road, and you come to
 another junction.

 Trail Junction (Low Gap & Access trails)
 You smile as you enter the junction and see the sign in the northeast
 corner of the clearing:

 LOW GAP TRAIL
 &lt;- Cosby Campground 0.4

 Less than half a mile to the campground! Of course, the parking area's
 another half mile beyond that, but that's of little consequence...
 you're very close to home now.

 Somewhere in the distance, a woodpecker drills in search of insects.

>go east
 No, there's only forest in that direction, with no path amongst the
 trees. You can return to the parking lot by going either north or
 west.

>go north
 You decide to take the access trail back, seeing as how it's a
 slightly shorter walk in that direction. This portion of the access
 trail isn't very heavily used and is slightly overgrown; grass brushes
 against your legs as you walk. After not quite half a mile, you find
 yourself back in the same clearing you passed through earlier today.

 Trail Junction (Lower Mt. Cammerer & Access trails)
 You're standing at the junction of two trails, one running
 northwest-southeast, the other running northeast-southwest. At the
 north corner of the junction, two signs are nailed to a single post
 indicating where each trail leads.

 A previously unseen skink on a nearby log is startled by your presence
 and skitters under the bark.

>go south
 To the south lie dense woods, with no path among the trees. Two trails
 bisect the standard cardinal directions here, one running
 northeast-southwest, the other northwest-southeast. Your quickest
 route, back to the parking lot, is northwest.

>go northeast
 No, you've already been down that trail today. It's time to go home.
 The hiker parking area is just under a half mile to the northwest.

>go southwest
 That's the longer route back. Not that it matters, really - your feet
 are up for an extra quarter of a mile. You head down the wide trail
 (it's more of a road than a trail, really), and quickly find
 yourselfback in the campground.

 Lower Mt. Cammerer Trailhead
 A standard NPS trail sign indicates that the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail
 begins here, leaving the pavement and entering the woods to the
 northeast.

>go north
 To the north lie dense woods, with no path among the trees. The trail
 leads into the forest to the northeast.

>go southwest
 The campground lies in that direction, while your trail leads into the
 woods to the northeast.

>go northeast
 No, you've already been down that trail today. It's time to go home.
 The hiker parking area is just under a half mile to the northwest.

>go northwest
 You continue walking northwest, through the campground. Parents at a
 nearby site are setting up their tents for the evening, one for them,
 and a smaller one for their children. A young boy and girl are
 laughing and throwing a frisbee (and not throwing it very well)
 nearby. Suddenly, the frisbee comes flying right toward you!
 Fortunately, you see it coming and deftly toss it to the little girl,
 who thanks you and runs back to play with her brother. Another quarter
 mile finds you back in the parking lot.

 Hiker Parking
 You stroll into the parking lot, light on your feet despite the
 sixteen miles behind you, and glance at your watch. It reads three
 twenty-nine in the afternoon. Not bad time, really, considering all
 the stops along the way to check things out. You take off your pack
 and plop down on a grassy hill at the western edge of the parking lot.
 Lying back, angled with your head uphill of your feet, you watch the
 clouds that are gathering overhead. One of them reminds you of a galax
 leaf. You smile to yourself, thinking of the wonderful day you've had,
 close your eyes, listen to the birds the nearby woods, and eventually
 drift off to sleep in the grass. What a fantastic day.

 As darkness falls, the serenity is broken by the sound of an
 approaching car, and you open your eyes to see your ride pulling into
 the parking lot, right on time.

 In the Garden

 You stand in the middle of Grandmother's garden. You still have many
 weeds left to find. The woods are so far away.

 Grandmother always insists on an immaculate garden. "The daises will
 not allow anyone to crowd their soil. They forgot how to live with the
 unknowable."

>take weeds
 You reach down and snap off a dull green weed, but you can't find its
 roots. You let it go.

>inventory
 You aren't allowed anything.

>examine me
 You know yourself by looking through your eyes.

 A girl appears at the edge of the woods. "Hello," she calls.

 You've dreamed about this day for almost 25 years.  If only your
 father were alive; he's the one that got you hooked on baseball.  He
 would be so proud.  Here you are, Fenway Park, game seven.  It's the
 American League Championship Series against the rival New York
 Yankees.  The bases are loaded, there are two outs, it's the bottom of
 the ninth inning and the count has just run to three balls and two
 strikes.  The Yankees are leading 4-2 and only one strike away from
 going to the World Series - again.

 That is, unless Jake Garrett has anything to do with it.

 Fenway Park, At Bat
    The crowd is deafening and everybody is up on their feet.  You've
 been playing pro ball for six years and you're usually able to tune
 out the crowd, the hysteria and the sheer madness.  But not this time.
 You're finding it hard to concentrate.  You are standing in the
 batter's box, awaiting the biggest pitch of your career.

>hit ball with bat
 You focus on the ball approaching the plate.  Not knowing the pitch or
 location, you just pray for the best and swing as hard as you can.
 You're surprised that a curve ball is thrown inside and you manage to
 foul off the ball.  The ball goes out of play behind the dugout.

 The pitcher gets another ball and approaches the mound.

 Looks like you'll have one more chance to be a hero.
 The roar of the crowd is deafening.

 out like your dream.  Your teammates try to console you, but you're
 numb.  You take a quick shower, meet up with your wife and kids and
 head home.  There's always next year.

 You focus on the ball approaching the plate.  You extend your arms and
 the bat and ball meet.  As soon as you hit it, you know that it has a
 shot to leave the park.  You watch the ball drift toward the center
 field bleachers.  You toss the bat aside and start running up the
 first base line and by the time you round first, you see the ball land
 in the seats.  Euphoria.  You don't even remember touching the second
 base bag and as you hit third, you look up and see your wife and kids,
 screaming and jumping for joy.  The crowd is so loud you can't even
 hear the sound of your footsteps on the dirt.

 The third base coach slaps you on the butt as you pass him and home
 plate is near.  This is the defining moment of your baseball career
 and all of your teammates are there to greet you.  Your team is going
 to the World Series and you're a big part of it.  As you step on the
 plate, you are immediately mobbed. You don't remember the first five
 minutes, just a bunch of grown men laughing, screaming, crying and
 hugging.  You end up on the ground in a ceremonial pig pile.

 You don't feel the sharp pain in your leg for at least several
 seconds.  You then realize someone's metal spike has inadvertently
 torn a gash across the lower part of your thigh.  At first your
 screams are thought to be part of the celebration and nobody notices.
 The red splash of blood is quite a contrast to your white Red Sox
 uniform.  Somebody finally notices.

 Trainer's Room, on the table
    The pain is really starting to set in now, especially since Charlie
 is cleaning the wound.  You don't even remember being dragged into the
 trainer's room and plopped onto the table.  You just wish the pain
 would go away so you could start celebrating the victory.

 The trainer's room is not a place you're familiar with.  In fact, this
 is the first time you've been hurt since playing for the Red Sox; who
 would have imagined that your first injury would be sustained during a
 celebration.

 Various and sundry medical supplies are scattered about the room.  In
 the center of the room is a large table (the one you're sitting on)
 and the exit is through a door to the south.
    Charlie the trainer is here, looking at your wound.

 "You're very lucky, Jake," says Charlie, "the cut is not too deep.
 Another inch or so and it could have damaged the muscle."

>examine wound
 It's not visible right now, but it hurts a lot.

 "I'm going to give you a shot of morphine," says Charlie.  "This
 should make the pain subside."  Charlie draws the syringe and wipes
 the area around the wound with some alcohol.  "Hold still now!" quips
 Charlie.  You barely feel the needle.

>wait
 Time passes...

 "In the best interests of you and the team," says Charlie, "we're
 sending you to the local hospital."

 You open your mouth to object, but Charlie raises his hand and motions
 you to be quiet.

 "I know what you're going to say, Jake," continues Charlie.  "This is
 the biggest night of your career, you want to celebrate with the team;
 yadda, yadda, yadda."

 Charlie clears his throat and starts to speak again.  "The team can't
 afford to have you miss game one of the Series; they need you in the
 lineup," adds Charlie.  "Just let the hospital run some routine tests
 and you'll be back here in a couple of hours.  We're even going to
 send you by ambulance so they can start the routine right away."

 Reluctantly, you agree to go to the hospital.  It's not like you
 really have a choice because you want to make sure you're ready for
 Game One.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Charlie looks at his watch.

 "Okay, Jake.  It's 11:20, they should be here in less than 5 minutes.
 You don't have time to take a shower or change, but at least change
 into your sneakers.  I can imagine that you're not too fond of metal
 spikes right now."  He chuckles.

 You look down at your cleats and the half-inch metal spikes and
 shiver, thinking that one of them almost ruined the World Series for
 you.

>remove cleats
 Wait until you reach the locker room.

 Your wife and twin daughters enter the trainer's room.  You jump off
 the table, wince in pain for a second, and then greet them.  You
 explain what Charlie has told you and the fact that you need to spend
 a couple of hours at the local hospital.  You and your wife work out a
 plan and decide to meet at the hospital in an hour.  That should give
 her enough time to drop off the kids at her mom's house.  Your wife,
 visibly relieved that you're okay, plants a kiss on your cheek as you
 give your daughters a reassuring hug.  Your youngest waves as Charlie
 walks the three of them out.

 So much for the big celebration.

 You exit the trainer's room and head for your locker.  Most of the
 players and their families have already left for the party; you'll
 just have to catch up with them later.  You put on your Nike sneakers
 and place your lucky Swiss army knife into your rear pocket.  You
 never go anywhere without it.

 A moment later, a couple of paramedics escort you out of the locker
 room by the back door and into the ambulance.  What a night.

 Ambulance, on the stretcher
    Thank goodness Charlie was right: the pain is starting to subside.
 It's hard to believe that fifty minutes ago you were hitting a
 dramatic grand slam.  Now?  Now you're strapped to a stretcher in an
 ambulance heading down Division Street.  You've traveled this road
 countless times, but usually as a driver heading home after a game or
 practice.  It really hasn't sunk in yet.

 You can't see much of the ambulance, considering you're on your back.
 Apart from the ambulance ceiling, you can make out the ambulance door,
 which is obviously closed, and an IV pole.  Various medical supplies
 are scattered about and the rhythmic sounds of the different machines
 beeping and humming is almost soothing; almost.
    A technician, whose name is Jason -- at least that's the name sewn
 on his jacket -- is here.

>ask jason about iv
 "No need to worry about the IV," says Jason in a soothing voice.

 "I'm sorry, Jake," says Jason.  "I know you may think it's
 unnecessary, but it's policy, you need to be strapped in."  He
 continues, "I just need to perform some routine procedures; please be
 patient."

 Jason then turns around and starts to gather his blood pressure
 equipment.

>examine strapes
 I don't know the word "strapes".

>examine straps
 The straps are prohibiting any movement.

>examine pole
 The IV pole is used to hang the appropriate medicine and/or saline
 solution that would be pumped into your body intravenously.  The pole
 is standing near the head of the stretcher.

 Jason wraps a medical cuff around your arm, flips the stethoscope over
 his head and begins to pump the bulb.  You feel the cuff tighten
 around your arm, and then just when it starts to get uncomfortable,
 the pressure slowly releases from the cuff.  Jason listens intently
 through his stethoscope and a few moments later, removes the cuff.

 "One-fifteen over sixty-two," says Jason.

>examine jason
 The technician is named Jason, or at least that's the name sewn on his
 jacket. He stands about six feet tall, is in his mid-forties and has a
 neatly trimmed goatee.  He entering some information in your file.

 Jason updates his file.

>ask jason about file
 "Your file can be reviewed once we reach the hospital," replies Jason.

 Jason grabs your wrist, feels for your pulse and after a brief period
 of time, looks down at his watch.

 "Sixty-four," he Jason.  "By the way, Jake, I see here that you're
 diabetic.  Make sure you take care of that, low blood sugar can sneak
 up on you rather quickly."

>ask jason about diabetes
 "I'm no expert, but I do know that you should eat at regular intervals
 or your low blood sugar may cause you to black out," replies Jason,
 almost as if he's reciting from a medical book.

 Jason looks around for something.

>kick jason
 You're strapped to the stretcher; you can't move.

 Jason snaps off the cap of a new thermometer and places it under your
 tongue.  A few moments later he removes it and turns it slightly to
 read your temperature.

 "Ninety-eight point six," says Jason.  "I've completed the necessary
 round of checks," he continues.  "You just need to sit tight until we
 reach the hospital.  We should be there shortly."

>ask jason about insurance
 I don't know the word "insurance".

 Ambulance, on the stretcher
    You can't see much of the ambulance, considering you're on your
 back.  Apart from the ambulance ceiling, you can make out the
 ambulance door, which is obviously closed.  Various medical supplies
 are scattered about and the rhythmic sounds of the different machines
 beeping and humming is almost soothing; almost.
    You see an IV pole here.
    A technician is here.

 Jason organizes his files.

 I don't know the word "missing".

>examine supplies
 The medical supplies are of no use to you.

 Your body jerks forward and you immediately hear the screeching sound
 of the ambulance tires.  A moment later the ambulance begins to
 fishtail and you watch the various medical supplies bounce off the
 walls.  Jason is thrown down on the floor and you helplessly watch him
 get peppered with falling objects.  You then hear, and feel, a
 tremendous crash followed by some screaming coming from the driver's
 compartment.  Jason appears unconscious and is now lying underneath a
 large piece of equipment.

 The ambulance begins to spin uncontrollably as you hold on to the side
 railings with a determined grip.  To the stretcher's credit, it has
 kept you safe up until this point; you wonder for a moment what you
 would be doing if you weren't strapped in.

 Just as the ambulance appears to come to a stop, you look out the
 small window of the back door and see the ambulance veer off the road
 and start to plummet down the side of a cliff.  The back door flies
 open and you watch the contents of the ambulance get thrown out
 systematically.  You turn your head away as you watch Jason slide out
 the back of the ambulance; who knows if he'll survive.

 The vehicle continues to plunge down the precipice but remarkably
 stays on its wheels.  The stretcher appears to be on the verge of
 tipping over several times but its position in the ambulance and its
 braking system prevent it from doing any damage to you.  The IV pole
 crashes on top of you, your quick reflexes help you avoid it colliding
 with your head, and it ends up leaning up against the stretcher.  The
 ambulance continues to tumble and slowly comes to rest near some thick
 brush, a good thirty feet from the road.

 An instant later, you hear the engine compartment burst into flames.
 Your eyes widen: you know you don't have much time left before the
 entire ambulance is engulfed in flames.

>bite straps
 I don't know the word "bite".

>yell
 Jason looks awkwardly at you.

 The intense heat is almost too much for you to take.  It appears as if
 the stretcher has caught fire and the thick black smoke is making it
 almost impossible for you to see.

>jason, free me
 I don't know the word "free".

>take pole
 Taken.

 The inside of the ambulance is almost an inferno.  The heat is so
 intense that you pass out.  It's probably best that you did -- you
 don't survive the barbecue.

 Ambulance, on the stretcher
    The ambulance is cluttered with machines, medical supplies and
 broken glass. The ambulance door is wide open and you can see thick
 brush dotting the landscape.  The ambulance itself appears to be
 tilted on a steep angle: if it weren't for the brakes on the
 stretcher, you would have rolled right out the back door.

 You're still strapped to the stretcher and the IV pole is leaning up
 against you.  You can hear and feel the fire getting closer.  The
 smoke is making it hard for you to breathe.
    You see an IV pole here.

 The IV pole doesn't appear appetizing.

 You can hear the fire crackle and grow in intensity.

>take pole
 Taken.

 The fire has now consumed the entire engine compartment.  You can
 smell the strong pungent odor of the smoke.

>push brakes with pole
 You lower the IV pole and poke at the brake.  You hear a click and the
 brake is disengaged.

 With the brake disengaged, the stretcher quickly accelerates unchecked
 through the smoke and flames, shooting out the rear of the ambulance,
 the cool air hitting you like a wall.  For a brief moment you hang
 weightless, and then with a sudden jolt the wheels make contact with
 the steep terrain beneath you, knocking the IV pole from your grip.
 Strapped in helplessly as the unguided stretcher continues to hurtle
 downhill through heavy brush, every rock sending it dangerously atilt,
 every branch threatening to take your head off, all you can do is
 close your eyes and pray that you're not headed directly for a tree,
 lake, or precipitous drop.  Finally, the inevitable impact that you
 wish you could have seen coming: the stretcher slams into a rock with
 such force that you find yourself flipping over, snapping right
 through the strap over your chest and arms, and landing upside-down in
 a low scrub tree.

 You're upside-down, hanging uncomfortably from the strap around your
 legs.  But never mind that; you're just glad that the ride is over and
 that you're still in one piece.

 Heavy Brush, on the stretcher
    You're on the stretcher, hanging upside down.  The wheels of the
 stretcher seem to be caught in some heavy brush right near a large oak
 tree.  Above, you can see a red glow coming from the ambulance; below,
 the slope of the cliff continues its descent toward the water.

 With a terrible explosion the ambulance bursts into flames.

>take knife
 You remove the Swiss army knife from your back pocket.

 The fire is starting to spread through the forest brush at an alarming
 rate.

>cut strap with knife
 You reach up to your legs and grab hold of the strap with your left
 hand as you begin to cut the strap with your right.  The straps are
 tougher than you thought and require some elbow grease to get the job
 done.  Halfway through, you glance up at the approaching fire and
 figure you literally have seconds before it's too late.  The intense
 heat of the blaze is making your hands sweat and you feel your left
 hand slipping as you try to maintain your balance.  With one last
 thrust, you manage to cut off the bottom strap.

 You weren't prepared for the incredible jolt you receive as you slide
 down the stretcher and into the thick brush.  The steep descent
 catches you off guard as you tumble down the precipitous slope.  You
 have no control over your arms and legs as they flail helplessly,
 trying to grab on to something that can stop your fall.

 Just about when you thought your ride was over, you roll past another
 thick brush into thin air.  You fall for few silent seconds and land
 on your back with a heavy thud; thank goodness the soft beach sand
 broke your fall.  You look at your right hand.  You can't believe you
 managed to hold on to your lucky Swiss army knife, especially without
 cutting yourself.

 You lay motionless for a while, admiring the full moon, ominously
 casting an eerie light on the ocean.  You can hear the waves crashing
 onto the beach and you can't help but laugh.  Such a beautiful moment
 landscape-wise, considering a few moments ago you were almost engulfed
 in a savage inferno.  After catching your breath, you stand up and
 shake off the sand; what a night.

 Beach Alcove
    You're standing at the end of a beach alcove.  From what you can
 see there's a large cliff to the north, making this a very private
 area.  The forest is up and to the east, unreachable from this point.
 The ocean lies to the west and goes as far as the eyes can see.  The
 beach path continues south.

 Stretch of Beach
    You've made your way to a nice stretch of beach.  The surroundings
 resemble the alcove where you first entered the beach.  The ocean
 spans your field of vision to the west and the thick impenetrable
 forest is up to the east.  The beach ends abruptly to the north but
 continues to the south.

>go south
 Private Beach
    The moon sheds just enough light for you to imagine the
 breathtaking view this location must have during the day.  Your best
 guess is that you're on a private beach, protected by a massive cliff
 wall to the south.  To the east is a small path that appears to lead
 to a prominent looking gate.  To the north, a smaller stretch of beach
 leads into darkness.

>go east
 Gate Entrance
    You're standing before a large metal gate.  A tall stone wall
 extends to the north and south, wrapping around what appears to be an
 enormous house.  The gate is closed.  Beyond the gate to the east is a
 path that leads toward a house.

>examine leg
 They're your legs.

>examine wound
 I don't see any wound here.

>examine gate
 The large metal gate separates the beach from the manicured property
 of the house on the hill.  It is somewhat Gothic looking and seems out
 of place.  Attached to the gate is a latch, secured by a small
 padlock.  The gate is closed.

>examine padlock
 The padlock has seen better days.  The salt air has done a number on
 the metal, the tiny keyhole is full of rust, and it wouldn't be a
 surprise if it didn't work at all.  The padlock is locked.

>open padlock
 You tug at the padlock but it doesn't open.

>pick padlock with knife
 You try to jam the Swiss army knife blade into the padlock but have no
 luck; the Swiss army knife blade doesn't fit.

>climb gate
 Apart from it being rather high and dangerous, there are no good
 footholds to start your climb.

>break padlock
 Violence isn't the answer.

>kick gate
 Nothing happens.

>examine latch
 The latch is used to lock the gate in place.  It's currently in the
 locked position and there's a padlock hanging from it.

>kick padlock
 Violence isn't the answer.

>unscrew latch
 You see no way to do that.

>examine knife
 Your Swiss army knife has been with you for the last fifteen years.
 It got handed down to you by your dad when you turned eighteen, which
 is one of the reasons it means so much to you.  Apart from the
 frighteningly sharp knife, it also contains a flathead screwdriver, a
 Phillips screwdriver, a bottle opener, tiny scissors and an awl.

>pick lock with awl
 You insert the awl and poke inside the padlock for a bit.  After a
 couple of jabs, a fair amount of rust escapes from the padlock; you
 hear a small click.  You remove the awl from the padlock and try to
 open it.  Success!

>open latch
 You first remove the padlock from the latch and then lift the latch.

>open gate
 As you swing the gate open, a tremendous screeching sound fills the
 night air, you can hear the din reverberate in every direction.  The
 gate apparently isn't used as often as one might think, considering
 the incredible beach it protects.

>go east
 You walk up the winding stone path, passing by numerous flower beds,
 sculpted bushes and ornate lawn decorations.  Each section of the yard
 is meticulously manicured as if the house was featured on the cover of
 Home and Garden each week.  After a brisk walk, you climb several
 stairs and enter the wrap-around porch.

 Porch
    You're standing at the back entrance of the house which is flanked
 by an enormous wrap-around porch.  A set of double doors made up of
 mostly smoked glass is to the east.  The porch runs both north and
 south.

 The house is eerily absent of any light.

>go east
 The double doors are closed.

>open doors
 The double doors are locked.

>knock on door
 You knock on the door.  Eerie silence.

>break glass
 That would create too much of a disturbance; you're afraid you'd scare
 the owners and get promptly shot.

>go north
 North End of Porch
    You're standing at the north end of the wrap-around porch, which
 ends abruptly due to the fact that the external casing of the chimney
 needed to be accounted for.  Two large windows flank the fireplace
 casing.

>examine chimney
 The casing is part of the house, shaped in the form of a chimney.

>examine windows
 The windows are very large and, when there's sunlight, must give the
 room inside an incredible view of the ocean.

>open windows
 You can't open the windows from the outside.

>go south

>go south
 South End of Porch
    You've made your way to the south end of the wrap-around porch,
 which continues to the east.  A pair of large windows offers the room
 inside an exceptional view of the ocean.  The porch also continues
 north.

>go east
 East End of Porch
    You're standing at the east end of the wrap-around porch, which
 ends near a patio door.  The porch continues to the west.

>examine door
 The patio door looks as if it's been compromised.  The glass from one
 of the window panes is missing and the door is closed.

>enter door
 (Opening the patio door)

>go north
 Before you enter the house, you check to make sure your Swiss army
 knife has been closed and slip it into your front pocket.  No need to
 walk into a strange house carrying a knife since you don't have
 hostile intentions.

 As you take your second step, you feel a sharp pain run down your
 spine.  Before your brain can process what just happened, you fall to
 the floor like a sack of potatoes.  Two men jump on top of you and
 immediately begin to secure your hands and legs with some rope.  As
 the rope is being tightened you notice one of them pick up the padlock
 which fell out of your hand.

 You momentarily black out from the pain and after a few moments, or at
 least, it felt like only a few moments, you regain your consciousness.

 You're lying on your back in the middle of a stranger's living room,
 feet bound and hands tied behind your back.  Two men are standing over
 you, inspecting their catch with their flashlights.

 Living Room

 "I'm telling you Tommy, it's him!" whispers one of the men.  "Look!
 He's still wearing his uniform."

 "Bobby," counters Tommy, sounding very skeptical, "why would Jake
 Garrett be breaking into this house in the middle of the night when he
 just hit the game-winning grand slam a few hours ago?  And why was he
 knocking on the door a few moments ago?"

 "I can't answer that, Tom," replies Bobby in a soft, almost giddy
 voice, "all I know is that I'm a huge fan and this IS Jake Garrett."

 Bobby and Tommy stare at you, each taking turns scratching their
 heads.

>say hi
 I don't understand that sentence.

>talk to bobby
 I don't know the word "talk".

>ask bobby about tommy
 "Silence!" yells Bobby.

 "Screw this job," says Bobby, "we could make much more money with a
 hostage like this.  Can you imagine the ransom we could get?"

 "Now you're talking, Bobby!  Didn't he just sign a multi-million
 dollar contract this year?" asks Tommy, not wanting or needing an
 answer.  "I'm just sure he would love to share some of that money with
 us!"

>go east
 You're not going anywhere until you get off of your back.

 Bobby and Tommy confer quietly.

>stand
 Not possible.

 Tommy reaches for his cell phone and makes a call.  Before he can say
 hello, he walks into a different room so you can't quite make out what
 he's saying.  A few moments later he returns.

>move hands
 Your hands aren't important.

 "Okay, change in plans Jake," quips Bobby as he and Tommy lift you to
 your feet.  "We're going for a ride," says Tommy as he puts a
 blindfold on you.  "We also don't need you shouting for help," says
 Tommy as he puts a makeshift gag around your head.

 Bob and Tom drag you through several rooms and out yet another door to
 their car.  Your finely tuned, athletic body is treated like a slab of
 beef as Bobby and Tommy haul you to their car.  This does nothing for
 your injury, save perhaps make it even worse.  One of them pops open
 the trunk and you're unceremoniously dumped in.  The morphine Charlie
 gave you must be wearing off and before you can catch your breath, all
 goes dark.

 In the trunk of a car

 You hear the car doors open and close.  A few moments later, the car
 engine starts and slowly the car accelerates.  An instant later, the
 car veers drastically as your body bounces off the back of the trunk
 wall.  Apparently they've left the driveway and are now on the road.
 You're going for a ride alright, you just don't know where.

>take knife
 You can't reach the Swiss army knife; your hands are currently tied.

 You can hear the radio changing stations, evidently Tommy and Bobby
 can't agree on the same type of music.  After several attempts, the
 radio is shut off.  A moment later, you hear the siren of a fire truck
 with police sirens also filling the midnight air.

 "What do we have here?" says one of them to his friend.  "Wow, it
 looks like some sort of accident.  Look, Tommy, part of the woods is
 on fire!" says Bobby rather excitedly.  "Now drive carefully, the last
 thing we need is to be pulled over."

 The conversation continues for a bit as you feel the car stop and
 start several times.  A few moments later, the car accelerates and the
 sound of the sirens grow more and more distant.

>listen
 You don't hear anything unusual.

 The car hits a large pot hole, either that or it's time for them to
 replace the struts, and this causes your body to slam against the
 inside wall.  Your lucky Swiss army knife digs into your thigh, much
 too close to your gash.  Thank goodness the blade was retracted,
 you've had your share of pain tonight.

>take knife
 You can't reach the Swiss army knife; your hands are currently tied.

 You're starting to lose track of time.  You can't remember if you've
 been trapped in this trunk for five or 35 minutes and it's starting to
 get hard to breathe.  You're doing your best to remain calm.

>move hands
 Your hands aren't important.

 After what seems like an eternity, the car comes to a full stop.  You
 listen attentively to see what Bobby and Tommy do.  Both doors open
 simultaneously, followed shortly by the pop of the trunk.  Neither man
 says anything as they drag you out of the trunk.

 You're led down a path, up a few steps and then brought into another
 house.  You're guided to a chair where you are forced to sit down as
 your feet and arms are secured to the chair.  You are now a hostage.
 What you wouldn't do for your baseball bat right about now.

 As you settle into your chair, you wiggle your hands accordingly.  If
 only you had put your Swiss army knife in your back pocket.  The way
 they tied you to the chair, it would take a minimal amount of effort
 to retrieve the knife and cut your way loose when they weren't
 looking.  Oh well, live and learn.

 Some room, sitting on the chair
    You see nothing.

>wriggle
 I don't know the word "wriggle".

>lean east
 I don't understand that sentence.

>lean
 What do you want to lean?

>shake
 What do you want to shake?

>listen
 You don't hear anything unusual.

 You hear a conversation taking place in another room in the house.
 The voices sound like they belong to Bobby and Tommy.

 "It'll work," says Bobby, "I know it will."

 "Bobby," says Tommy in an exasperated voice, "your plan sounds like it
 came from a Colombo episode.  I don't have a good feeling about it."

 "Listen, we call the Red Sox, we tell them that we have Jake Garret
 and we want the money," replies Bobby, obviously trying to convince
 his partner of the soundness of the plan.  "They can't trace the call
 because they probably don't know he's missing yet!" says Bobby as his
 voice gets louder and louder.

 "Okay, okay, Bobby.  Let's go over your plan one more time," says
 Tommy, trying to give his friend the benefit of the doubt.

 Their voices get softer as they discuss the details of the ransom
 pick-up.  You don't catch all of the details, apart from a possible
 swap of luggage and a fake getaway car.  One thing you do hear, loud
 and clear, as if they wanted you to hear it.  Should anything go
 wrong, you're dead.

 You hope everything goes right.

>shift weight
 I don't know the word "shift".

>feel chair
 The chair feels just like a chair.

 The silence is broken by Tommy and Bobby discussing the timing.  It
 appears as if they're opting for rush hour traffic in Boston.  You
 hear them tentatively agree to leave the house this afternoon.  Their
 conversation continues for a while, bouncing from topic to topic.
 After a while, you lose interest and drift off to sleep.

 You wake up many hours later with somebody shaking your shoulder.

 As you gather your senses, the previous night's activities replay in
 your mind. The ambulance, the fire, the thunk on the head.  Oh, does
 it hurt now.  That horrible ride in the trunk of the car, it's a
 wonder you managed to sleep at all and worst of all, you're starving
 and need to go to the bathroom.  You wonder if it can get any worse.

 "Hey!", screams a voice in your ear.  "Hotshot, wake up!  It's
 payday."

 You mumble something incoherently.  Bobby and Tommy both snicker.

 voice, "and I won't hesitate to use this."

 Bobby motions to the gun in his hand, you get the hint.

 You're led through the kitchen area, down a short hallway and into the
 bathroom.  He tells you to leave the door ajar so that he can keep an
 eye on the window.  He doesn't have a view of the toilet or sink.

 Bathroom
    You're standing in a small bathroom which contains a pedestal sink
 and a toilet.  There is a mirror hanging over the sink, but no
 medicine cabinet can be found.  The room is relatively neat,
 considering the house occupants.  To the north is a door that is ajar,

 plan.

>close door
 Closed.

 The bathroom door swings open.

 "Listen, hotshot!" screams Bobby as if he's scolding his teenage son.
 "This door needs to stay ajar so I can monitor the window.  You're
 lucky we've given you these five minutes to use the bathroom."

 Bobby stares you down for a minute and then shuts the door, only
 leaving it open a crack.

>examine sink
 The pedestal sink is not noteworthy.

>examine toilet
 The toilet is not noteworthy.

 "How we doing in there?" questions Bobby, obviously eager to return
 you to your chair.  "Let's go!  You only have a few minutes left."

>examine mirror
 The mirror hangs over the pedestal sink.

>break mirror
 You'll have to tell me how to do that.

 The bathroom door swings open with Bobby standing there, gun in hand.
 Bobby escorts you back to the wooden chair where he promptly ties your
 hands and feet to the chair.

 "Hey Tommy," yells Bobby to his friend in the kitchen, "you think it's
 okay to leave the gag and blindfold off?"

 "Yeah, shouldn't be a problem," replies Tommy, "he can yell until he
 loses his voice, aint nobody gonna hear him."

 Bobby walks toward the kitchen where he and Tommy finalize the plan.

 "Why don't you call Jimmy," says Tommy, "let him know that we have a
 house guest and to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity.
 Don't tell him our plan, he'll probably want a piece of the action.
 He keeps forgetting that he retired from the business years ago."

 You hear Bobby use his cellular phone and speak to their friend Jimmy.
 He divulges more of the plan than Tommy would have liked, and you can
 hear Tommy tell Bobby to end the call.  After a few moments, Bobby
 gets the message across to Jimmy and the call ends.  You see Bobby
 make his way back into the family room.

 "Okay, hotshot.  We'll be back soon with lots of money," quips Bobby,
 rather amused.  "Make sure you don't go anywhere!"

 Both Bobby and Tommy laugh as they start to leave the house.  You
 overhear them talk about Jimmy, how ruthless he was and how he didn't
 mess around.  They were sad when he left the business, but a brush
 with death tends to make people look at life differently.  The last
 thing you hear is the sound of the front door closing.

 Family Room, sitting on the chair
    You're in what is best described as a family room, though there is
 no entertainment center to speak of.  The furniture in this room is
 rather sparse, yet cozy for this type of cabin.  To the north, a door
 leads out to the deck and the kitchen is east.

 Bathroom
    You're standing in a small bathroom which contains a pedestal sink
 and a toilet.  There is a mirror hanging over the sink, but no
 medicine cabinet can be found.  The room is relatively neat,
 considering the house occupants.  To the north is a door that is ajar,
 and on the southern wall is a window that is closed.

>put knife in front pocket
 Done.

 You can hear the muffled voices of Bobby and Tommy fine tuning their
 plan.

>take a leak
 I don't know the word "leak".

>piss
 You relieve yourself in the toilet.  After a proper shake (or two),
 you flush the toilet.

>examine window
 The window is closed.

 "How we doing in there?" questions Bobby, obviously eager to return
 you to your chair.  "Let's go!  You only have a few minutes left."

>open window
 Opened.

 The bathroom door swings open.

 "Listen, hotshot!" screams Bobby as if he's scolding his teenage
 daughter.  "This window needs to stay closed.  I wasn't born
 yesterday, you know!"

 Bobby stares you down for a minute and then proceeds to shut the
 window.  He then does an about face and shuts the door, only leaving
 it open a crack.

>look under sink
 There's nothing under the pedestal sink.

>break mirror with knife
 You can't use the Swiss army knife to break anything.

 The bathroom door swings open with Bobby standing there, gun in hand.
 Bobby escorts you back to the wooden chair where he promptly ties your
 hands and feet to the chair.

 "Hey Tommy," yells Bobby to his friend in the kitchen, "you think it's
 okay to leave the gag and blindfold off?"

 "Yeah, shouldn't be a problem," replies Tommy, "he can yell until he

 rather sparse, yet cozy for this type of cabin.  To the north, a door
 leads out to the deck and the kitchen is east.

>get knife
 You remove the Swiss army knife from your front pocket.

>cut rope
 You begin to cut the rope with your Swiss army knife and after a few
 moments, you free your hands.  You then reach down and cut the rope
 from your feet and when complete, stand up and stretch.  You quickly
 place the Swiss army knife into your front pocket.  You look down at
 the rope and determine that it may be useful.  You discard the smaller
 pieces of rope that you cut and keep the large piece.

 Now, if you could only find a phone.

>go east
 Kitchen
    You're standing in the middle of the kitchen, which doesn't appear
 as if it's used too often.  There are almost no kitchen appliances
 apart from the major ones; neatly tucked away in the corners of the
 room are the stove, refrigerator and dishwasher.  Near the kitchen
 counter is a blue recycling bin.

 There is a breakfast type counter which nicely separates the kitchen
 area from the family room.  On the kitchen counter is a microwave, and
 near it is a note. You can enter the family room to the west and a
 hallway leads south, toward the bathroom.  The dining room is east of
 here.

 It's been an awfully long time since you last ate and hunger is
 starting to consume most of your thoughts.

>examine note
 The note is written in ink, by somebody with awful penmanship.

>read note
 (first taking the note)
 Tommy,

    Thanks for letting me use the boat.  Sorry I ran out of gas,
 believe you me, it was embarrassing having to be towed in by those
 schmucks.  Anyway, I left the key in the cabin of the boat.  Here's
 fifty bucks for the gas.

 Thanks again,
 Jimmy

>open fridhe
 I don't know the word "fridhe".

>open fridge
 You check out the contents of the refrigerator and snub your nose at
 most of the items, not that there is an abundance of them.  Most of
 the occupants of the refrigerator are not edible or haven't seen the
 light of day in quite some time.  You do manage to see some pizza that
 looks relatively fresh and some beverages, most notably a can of coke
 and a can of beer.

>take coke
 Taken.

>drink coke
 You pop off the lid and down the Coke.  It takes a couple of attempts,
 carbonation in soda is a wonderful thing, but you manage to finish it
 in record time.  Very refreshing.

>eat pizza
 You chomp down the cold pizza as if you haven't eaten in days, which
 is closer to the truth than you care to admit.  Though the pizza was
 cold and had no taste, it does satisfy you.

 You let out a loud gassy burp; that coke was really carbonated.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 Kitchen
    You're standing in the middle of the kitchen, which doesn't appear
 as if it's used too often.  There are almost no kitchen appliances

 There is a breakfast type counter which nicely separates the kitchen

 You can enter the family room to the west and a hallway leads south,

    The refrigerator seems to contain a beer, a leftover pizza, and
 some non-edible items.

>take pizza
 Taken.

 You let out a loud gassy burp; that coke was really carbonated.

>examine microwave
 The microwave has no buttons.  This must be one of those new automatic
 models which starts and stops automatically.  It is currently closed.

>open microwave
 Opened.

>put pizza in microwave
 Done.

>close microwave
 You close the door and the microwave emits three short beeps.  You
 hear the microwave turn on as it prepares to heat its contents.  You
 watch the leftover pizza, wondering when the microwave will sense it
 and stop accordingly.  A few moments later the microwave stops and
 emits five short beeps.

>open microwave
 Opening the microwave reveals a leftover pizza.

>eat pizza
 The pizza is rather hot and you don't enjoy it as much as you could.
 The cheese stings the roof of your mouth as you swallow the pizza bit
 by bit.  You were hungrier than you thought, if that's possible, and
 when done, you are quite satisfied.

>open dishwasher
 Opening the dishwasher reveals some dirty dishes.

>examine dishes
 You see nothing unusual about the dirty dishes.

 A small burp escapes from your mouth, definitely coke.

>go east
 Before you leave, you shut the refrigerator.  No need to keep it open.

 Dining Room
    The dining room is rather small, and the table and chairs that
 adorn the middle of the room barely fit.  The style of the dining room
 set conflicts with most of the furniture you've seen, particularly in
 the family room.  Your bet is that Tommy and Bobby inherited this from
 the previous owner.  Two large windows give a good view of the
 backyard.  The kitchen is west and to the south, is the formal living
 room.

>go south
 Living Room
    The formal living room, if you could call it that, doesn't appear
 as if it's been used for quite some time.  You're getting the feeling
 that Bobby and Tommy don't really call this home.  The fireplace is as
 clean as a whistle and nothing is out of place.  The sofa looks as if
 the plastic was just removed from it and the coffee table doesn't have
 one stain on it.  Two large windows give you a view of the front yard.
 The dining room is north and to the west is a small foyer.

>go west
 Foyer
    You've made your way to the small foyer.  Toward the east is a
 large living room which then opens up to the dining room.  A hallway
 is northwest of here and to the south, is the front door which is
 closed.

>open door
 Opened.

>go south
 Front Yard
    You're standing in front of the house, just beyond the driveway.
 It's a simple one floor cabin, in the style of a Cape.  The shingles
 of the house have worn well and the shrubs and bushes surrounding the
 house have overgrown a bit. You can make your way east or west to
 explore the front yard more, or you can go south toward the driveway.
 The front door is north.

 As you step outside for the first time, you notice the threatening
 sky.  The clouds are starting to roll in and they don't look too
 happy.  Looks like you're in for some nasty weather soon.

>go east
 East of Cabin
    You're standing east of the cabin.  The forest suffocates the area
 here, but you can make out the backyard to the north.  To the west is
 the front of the house.  Near some shrubs, nested against the house,
 is a ladder lying on the ground.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>take ladder
 Taken.

>go north
 You struggle with the eight foot ladder, but manage to balance it as
 you walk along.

 Backyard
    You're standing in the middle of the backyard, which judging by the
 color of the grass, doesn't get too much water or fertilizer.  A large
 barn can be seen to the north and to the west, is a small deck.  The
 house is due south and is protected by thick trees and brush.  The
 side yard can be accessed by going southwest or southeast.

 You feel a bit gassy and force a burp, that coke is still haunting
 you.

>go north
 Backyard, Near Barn
    You've made your way to the rear of the backyard.  Directly north,
 a large barn stands before you and to the northwest, a path leads
 through some brush toward the water.  The backyard is south.

>burp
 You swallow some air, but nothing happens.

>go north
 The barn doors are closed.

>open door
 The double doors are locked.

>examine barn
 The barn occupies most of the corner of the yard and is up against the
 property line, protected by a row of trees.  It has two large double
 doors that are closed as well as a window near the roof line.

>examine window
 The window is near the roof line of the barn.

 You glance up at the sky; definitely rain clouds.

>lean ladder on barn
 You lean the ladder against the barn and it now reaches up to the
 window.

>go up
 You ascend the ladder.

 Top of the Ladder, Near Window
    You're standing at the top of a ladder, near the barn window which
 is directly north.  The window is protected by a flimsy mesh screen,
 most likely used to keep the bugs out and to ventilate the barn
 appropriately.

>cut mesh with knife
 There is no need to cut the screen, you could probably open it if you
 tried.

>open mesh
 You tug at the screen and it comes loose.  You pull it away from the
 barn window and the screen is damaged slightly.  You inspect it for a
 moment, then let it drop to the ground.

>open screen
 I don't see any screen here.

>in
 Seeing as you're going to need your hands to squeeze through the
 window, you'll never make it carrying some rope, a note, and a coke
 can.

>tie rope to myself
 There is no need to tie the rope to yourself.

>look through window
 You stick your head through the window and peer in.  The barn is
 extremely cluttered and doesn't appear as if it's used too often.
 There are a couple of other windows on the far wall allowing some
 light to filter in, but from here, all you can make out is a pile of
 junk.

>save

>drop all
 rope:  You drop the rope and watch it fall to the ground.
 note:  You drop the note and watch it fall to the ground.
 coke can:  You drop the coke can and watch it fall to the ground.

>in
 You squeeze through the window and then hang from it for a brief
 moment, trying to figure out the optimum landing area.  You then let
 go and land on your feet.

 Inside the Barn
    You're inside an old barn, dimly lit by several windows near the
 roof line and the window that you squeezed through.  The barn appears
 as if it houses a boat in the winter, judging by a boat trailer near
 the rear of the barn.  Most of the room is occupied by various items,
 mostly worthless.

 Two large doors, which are closed, are to the south.  A large wooden
 crate is here, near the far wall.
    You see a gas container here.

>examine crate
 The wooden crate is roughly three feet wide and four feet tall.  It is
 unmarked.

>open it
 You lift the cover slightly and peek in the crate; it's empty.  You
 then lower the cover.

>examine can
 I don't see any can here.

>examine gas
 The gas container is extremely large and is probably used to contain
 some emergency gas for the boat.  The verbiage on the container
 indicates that it can hold up to 10 gallons.  There appears to be
 about two gallons of gas in the container.

>get it
 Taken.

>examine trailer
 The boat trailer is approximately twenty feet long and is made of
 steel.  It's parked at the rear of the barn.

 It doesn't appear as if the gas container can fit through the window,
 but you give it a shot anyway.  You heave the ten gallon gas container
 at the window and immediately duck as it bounces off the window and
 promptly hits you on the back of the head.  It tumbles off the crate
 and lands on the barn floor.  Thankfully, the container was closed and
 the gas is safe, for now.

 You relieve yourself in the toilet.  After a proper shake (or two),
 you flush the toilet.

>wash hands
 You wash your hands; not wanting to dry them on their towels, you

 "How we doing in there?" questions Bobby, obviously eager to return
 you to your chair.  "Let's go!  You only have a few minutes left."

 The bathroom door swings open with Bobby standing there, gun in hand.

    You've made your way to the only bedroom in the cabin.  Based on
 how it's furnished, you begin to wonder what exactly Bobby's and
 Tommy's relationship is, but that's the least of your problems right
 now.  The room has the bare essentials, and nothing more.

 Your eyes wander to the small night stand where an alarm clock is
 displaying the current time.  You can hardly believe that it's 2:17
 pm.

>look under bed

    You're standing in the middle of a short hallway that connects most
 of the rooms in this cabin.  To the north is the kitchen area which
 then leads to the dining room and family room.  To the south is the

 and to the east, is a closed door.  The hallway continues southeast to
 a small foyer which opens up into a large living room.

 Cellar
    You've made your way into a small cramped cellar.  It's more of a
 crawl space than anything, but apparently it's used to store items no
 longer required.  The cellar is illuminated by several small windows
 scattered around the foundation wall.  There's lots of junk cluttered
 about, most of it useless. On one of the walls, there's a shelf that
 contains a flashlight, a jar and other various junk items.

 Considering your predicament, something in the corner catches your
 eye; it appears to be a portable TV.  The only exit is to the west,
 back up the stairs.

>examine tv
 It's a nine inch portable TV, with an antenna attached to the back.
 The TV is currently off and appears to be battery operated.  On the
 back of the TV is a battery compartment.

 A TV dial is attached to the front of the portable TV.  The TV dial
 can be turned to channels numbered from 2 to 13.  It's currently set
 to 3.

 As you reach up to take the flashlight, the shelf gives and comes
 crashing to the floor.  The flashlight escapes your grip and falls to
 the hard cement floor, along with the other occupants of the shelf.

 Kitchen
    You're standing in the middle of the kitchen, which doesn't appear
 as if it's used too often.  There are almost no kitchen appliances
 apart from the major ones; neatly tucked away in the corners of the
 room are the stove, refrigerator and dishwasher.  Near the kitchen
 counter is a blue recycling bin.

 There is a breakfast type counter which nicely separates the kitchen
 area from the family room.  On the kitchen counter is a microwave.
 You can enter the family room to the west and a hallway leads south,
 toward the bathroom.  The dining room is east of here.

>go west
 Family Room
    You're in what is best described as a family room, though there is
 no entertainment center to speak of.  The furniture in this room is
 rather sparse, yet cozy for this type of cabin.  To the north, a door
 leads out to the deck and the kitchen is east.
    You see a chair here.

>go north
 (Opening the deck door)
 Deck
    You're standing in the middle of the wooden deck.  It's made of
 pressure-treated wood, but hasn't been cleaned in years.  The color of
 the wood is a dark gray.  In the corner of the deck is a gas grill
 that has rusted itself obsolete.  To the east, stairs descend toward
 the backyard and to the south is the door to the family room, which is
 open.

 As you step outside for the first time, you notice the threatening
 sky.  The clouds are starting to roll in and they don't look too
 happy.  Looks like you're in for some nasty weather soon.

>examine grill
 The gas grill looks as if it hasn't been used in years and is mostly a
 pile of rust.

>search it
 You find nothing of interest.

>open it
 You open the gas grill and take a peek inside.  Nothing but rust and
 cobwebs, so you close it.

>go down
 Backyard
    You're standing in the middle of the backyard, which judging by the
 color of the grass, doesn't get too much water or fertilizer.  A large
 barn can be seen to the north and to the west, is a small deck.  The
 house is due south and is protected by thick trees and brush.  The
 side yard can be accessed by going southwest or southeast.

 East of Cabin
    You're standing east of the cabin.  The forest suffocates the area

 is a ladder lying on the ground.

    You're standing on a small path that leads from the backyard to the
 water.  The path is protected by thick brush and trees and just ahead,
 is a large pole. To the north, you can see water as well as a small
 dock and near the dock is a small motor boat.  The barn is southeast
 of here.

>examine pole
 The tall pole appears to be some type of light post.  It's
 approximately twenty feet high and has two large lights hanging off
 the end of it.  Both lights appear to be directed at the dock and
 boat.

 As you head toward the dock, you glance up at the light stanchion and
 then it hits you.  Those lights are probably triggered by motion, but
 because it's still pretty bright out, you don't think its a problem;
 for now.

 Dock
    You're standing on a short wooden dock, near a boat.  The smell of
 salt air fills your lungs and you are instantly reminded of your
 younger days, when you and your father would go on fishing trips that
 would last all afternoon.  The boat can be boarded to the east and dry
 land is due south.

>go east
 At the Dock, In the Boat
    You're in a decent size boat, which is currently docked.  You're
 not very familiar with boats and most of the features of this craft
 are not recognizable.  There is no sail, so you quickly determine that
 it must be powered.  You recall the note from Jimmy.  It's powered
 alright, but it has no gas.

 A closed hatch, which leads down into the cabin, is here.  Just beyond
 the hatch is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the
 outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently
 secured by a gas cap.  Sitting right near the gas cap is a funnel.

>get funnel

 Seeing as the ladder will never fit down there, you decide to leave
 the ladder on the boat deck.

 As you make your way down the steps, you're surprised at the lack of

 reach the bottom of the steps, you can't see a thing.

 with are the ignition, throttle, steering wheel and speedometer.

 Tommy,

    Thanks for letting me use the boat.  Sorry I ran out of gas,
 believe you me, it was embarrassing having to be towed in by those
 schmucks.  Anyway, I left the key in the cabin of the boat.  Here's
 fifty bucks for the gas.

 Thanks again,
 Jimmy

>throw bottle out window
 You throw the two-liter plastic Pepsi bottle at the window.  A
 mediocre throw, at best.  It rattles off the side of the window a
 couple of times, but still manages to squeak through.  You hear it
 land somewhere in the yard.

    You're standing at the top of a ladder, near the barn window which
 is directly north.

>go down
 You descend the ladder.

 Backyard, Near Barn
    You've made your way to the rear of the backyard.  Directly north,
 a large barn stands before you and to the northwest, a path leads
 through some brush toward the water.  The backyard is south.  Leaning
 up against the barn is a ladder.
    You see a window screen, some rope, a can of coke, a note, a beer,
 a two-liter plastic Pepsi bottle, and a bottle cap here.

 You look down and notice that the two-liter bottle didn't survive the
 fall.  The cap must have popped off from the impact and the gasoline
 is gone.

 Inside the Barn, standing on the wooden crate
    You're inside an old barn, dimly lit by several windows near the
 roof line and the window that you squeezed through.  The barn appears
 as if it houses a boat in the winter, judging by a boat trailer near
 the rear of the barn.  Most of the room is occupied by various items,
 mostly worthless.

 Two large doors, which are closed, are to the south.  You're currently
 standing on a large wooden crate, which is under the barn window.

>hint

 The hint system in this game will slowly nudge you along.  Depending
 where you are and what you've done, it'll display minor hints
 accordingly.  If you're stuck, consult the walk-through or send me a
 note at msousa@efortress.com.  You'll only see this message once.

 The various items may be of some use to you.

>search items. hint
 The various junk items are bunched up in one corner of the barn.  Most
 of the things appear worthless to you, though a radio does catch your
 eye.

 You can barely reach the window.  I'm sure if you had something else
 to stand on, it would make your job a lot easier.

>get on crate. hint
 You climb up onto the crate.

 I can't think of any right now; maybe later.

>go down
 You climb down off the crate.

 Inside the Barn
 You're inside an old barn, dimly lit by several windows near the

 as if it houses a boat in the winter, judging by a boat trailer near
 the rear of the barn.  Most of the room is occupied by various items,
 mostly worthless.

 Two large doors, which are closed, are to the south.  A large wooden
 crate is here, under the barn window.
 You see a radio and a gas container here.

>throw sprite at window
 You throw the two-liter plastic Sprite bottle at the window and hold
 on to the other end of the rope with your other hand.  The bottle
 sails through the open window and starts its journey toward the grass.

 Two-thirds of the way down, the rope snaps tightly in your hand as the
 bottle crashes into the side of the barn.  A moment later, the rope
 goes limp in your hand; it appears as if the bottle came loose.  You
 pull the rope back up.

 You've dreamed about this day for almost 25 years.  If only your father
 were alive; he's the one that got you hooked on baseball.  He would be
 so proud.  Here you are, Fenway Park, game seven.  It's the American
 League Championship Series against the rival New York Yankees.  The
 bases are loaded, there are two outs, it's the bottom of the ninth
 inning and the count has just run to three balls and two strikes.  The
 Yankees are leading 4-2 and only one strike away from going to the
 World Series - again.

 That is, unless Jake Garrett has anything to do with it.

 Fenway Park, At Bat
 The crowd is deafening and everybody is up on their feet.  You've
 been playing pro ball for six years and you're usually able to tune out
 the crowd, the hysteria and the sheer madness.  But not this time.
 You're finding it hard to concentrate.  You are standing in the
 batter's box, awaiting the biggest pitch of your career.

 The pitcher rubs up the ball and approaches the mound.

 The catcher crouches behind the plate.

 The third base coach looks into the dugout.

 The runners are doing some last-minute stretching, anticipating the
 next pitch.

 At the Dock, In the Boat
 You're in a decent size boat, which is currently docked.  You're not
 very familiar with boats and most of the features of this craft are not
 recognizable.  There is no sail, so you quickly determine that it must
 be powered.  You recall the note from Jimmy.  It's powered alright, but
 it has no gas.

 An open hatch, which leads down into the cabin, is here.  Just beyond
 the hatch is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the
 outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently
 secured by a gas cap.

>open cap
 Which cap do you mean, the bottle cap, or the gas cap?

>gas
 I don't know how to open the gas cap.

>get gas cap

 You screw the cap onto the gas tank.

 Small Cabin
 The TV provides just enough light for you to look around this small
 room.  You're hunched over in a tiny cabin.  The room isn't much bigger
 than a large closet, and you wonder how people can spend the night
 here.  The entire eastern wall is taken up by a twin bed and there is a
 small dresser near the opposite wall.  An open hatch leads up to the
 boat deck.

 Sitting on the dresser table is a key.

>get key
 Taken.

>go up
 At the Dock, In the Boat
 You're in a decent size boat, which is currently docked.  You're not
 very familiar with boats and most of the features of this craft are not
 recognizable.  There is no sail, so you quickly determine that it must
 be powered.  But then again, that's why you put some gas in the tank.

 An open hatch, which leads down into the cabin, is here.  Just beyond
 the hatch is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the
 outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently
 secured by a gas cap.
 You see a two-liter plastic Pepsi bottle and a two-liter plastic
 Sprite bottle here.

>turn off tv
 You turn off the TV.

>put key in ignition
 Done.

>turn key
 You turn the key and the boat engine roars to life.

 The boat rocks gently back and forth.

>examine panel
 The control panel is the brain center of the boat.  There are many
 dials, displays and buttons, but the ones that you're most concerned
 with are the ignition, throttle, steering wheel and speedometer.

 The boat rocks gently back and forth.

>examine throttle
 The throttle is used to indicate which speed and which direction the
 boat should travel.  It has four settings: reverse, neutral, slow and
 fast.  The throttle is currently set to neutral.

 The boat rocks gently back and forth.

>set throttle to slow
 You move the throttle to slow.  The engines rev up a bit and the boat
 starts to move forward.  After a few moments, the boat glides along at
 about ten knots.  The boat slowly pulls away from the dock.  You put
 your hand on the steering wheel and guide the craft away from the
 shore, toward the open water.  With your other hand you move the
 throttle to fast; you've spent enough time at Bobby's and Tommy's
 cabin.  Just as the boat appears to hit its stride, you hear gun shots.

 Your instincts take over and you dive to the floor, your possessions
 scattering on the deck floor.  You roll onto your stomach and cover
 your head with your hands, desperately trying to take cover from the
 gun fire.  You lift your head slightly and catch a glimpse of an older
 man at the edge of the dock, firing away at the boat.  You surmise that
 it's Jimmy, but can't be sure.

 The attack only lasts for a few seconds before the speeding boat is out
 of reach.  You slowly get to your feet and look around.  You can't
 believe your eyes.  One of the bullets hit the steering wheel dead
 center.  There's practically nothing left of it.

 The boat continues to speed away from the shore at about 25 knots,
 that's the good news.  The bad news is that without a steering wheel,
 who knows where you're headed.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, a steady rain starts
 to fall.  You glance up at the skies ahead and it doesn't look good.
 The wind is starting to swirl and the sea water is starting to get
 agitated.  The boat continues to speed straight out to sea as it pounds
 into the waves of the choppy water.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The rain picks up and is now pelting you constantly.  You see several
 flashes of lightning and a few moments later, they are followed by the
 sound of thunder echoing in the distance.  The boat continues to speed
 straight out to sea as it pounds into the waves of the choppy waters.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The driving rain is making it very hard for you to see.  More flashes
 of lightning illuminate the dark skies and the waves are starting to
 reach the boat deck.  The storm is upon you.  The boat catches a couple
 of waves and actually goes airborne for a moment.  The impact knocks
 you back and you hold onto the railing for dear life.

 A huge wave spills across the deck and picks up the two-liter plastic
 Pepsi bottle.  You watch it float to the back of the boat where it
 disappears into the dark waters.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The sheets of rain are making it almost impossible for you to keep your
 eyes open.  The thunder and lightning are no longer separated by time.
 Each bolt of lightning is immediately followed by a tremendous clap of
 thunder.  It appears as if you're smack in the middle of a horrible
 storm.

 The boat speeds along and catches a large wave.  The back of the boat
 becomes submerged in water as enormous waves wash up on the deck.
 Water pours down the hatch into the cabin.

 A tremendous wave washes up on the deck and begins to carry the
 two-liter plastic Sprite bottle overboard.  You helplessly watch it
 disappear into the stormy water.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The storm intensifies.  The rain, wind and rocking motion of the boat
 has made you disoriented.  The speeding boat continues to challenge the
 surf but is not winning.  Every few seconds the boat crashes into a
 wall of water, throwing you from stem to stern.  Water continues to
 fill up the boat cabin below.

 A tremendous wave washes up on the deck and begins to carry the window
 screen overboard.  You helplessly watch it disappear into the stormy
 water.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The storm has reached its peak.  The rain is actually falling
 horizontally, at least in theory it should be falling.  The wind has
 probably reached hurricane status and is so loud that you can't hear
 yourself think.  A tremendous wave knocks you down to the boat deck but
 you quickly bounce back up to your feet.

 The boat engines sputter and come to a stop; they apparently are out of
 gas.  The boat continues to rock back and forth and comes awfully close
 to capsizing. You hang on to the railings as you get pummeled with
 driving rain, ferocious wind and buckets of sea water.  Water continues
 to fill up the boat cabin below.

 A huge wave spills across the deck and picks up the note.  You watch it
 float to the back of the boat where it disappears into the dark waters.

>wait
 Time passes...

 A tremendous surge of water breaks over the port side and carries you
 into the savage water.  You manage to tread water for several minutes
 before you are dragged into a watery grave.  All goes dark.  There is
 no pain.  Just silence.

 cabin.

 You whip your head around and watch in terror as the boat hatch starts

 incredible amount of water to fill the cabin.  You fight your way to
 the hatch opening to escape but the water pressure is just too much.
 You are pinned against the back wall as you try to catch your breath.
 A moment later you are submerged in dark cold water.  The silence is
 eerie.  So is death.

 Dock
 You're standing on a short wooden dock, near a boat.  The smell of
 salt air fills your lungs and you are instantly reminded of your
 younger days, when you and your father would go on fishing trips that
 would last all afternoon.  The boat can be boarded to the east and dry
 land is due south.

 At the Dock, In the Boat
 You're in a decent size boat, which is currently docked.  You're not
 very familiar with boats and most of the features of this craft are not
 recognizable.  There is no sail, so you quickly determine that it must
 be powered.  You recall the note from Jimmy.  It's powered alright, but
 it has no gas.

 An open hatch, which leads down into the cabin, is here.  Just beyond
 the hatch is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the
 outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently
 secured by a gas cap.

 Small Cabin
 The TV provides just enough light for you to look around this small
 room.  You're hunched over in a tiny cabin.  The room isn't much bigger
 than a large closet, and you wonder how people can spend the night
 here.  The entire eastern wall is taken up by a twin bed and there is a
 small dresser near the opposite wall.  An open hatch leads up to the
 boat deck.

 Sitting on the dresser table is a key.

 You move the throttle to fast.  The engines roar and you feel the boat
 jerk forward for a split second.  The boat's engines sputter briefly
 and then come to a stop.  Putting the throttle on fast called for too
 much gas too quickly and must have stalled the engines.

 You move the throttle back to neutral.

>move throttle to slow
 You move the throttle to slow.  The engines rev up a bit and the boat
 starts to move forward.  After a few moments, the boat glides along at
 about ten knots.  The boat slowly pulls away from the dock.  You put
 your hand on the steering wheel and guide the craft away from the
 shore, toward the open water.  With your other hand you move the
 throttle to fast; you've spent enough time at Bobby's and Tommy's
 cabin.  Just as the boat appears to hit its stride, you hear gun shots.

 Your instincts take over and you dive to the floor, your possessions
 scattering on the deck floor.  You roll onto your stomach and cover
 your head with your hands, desperately trying to take cover from the
 gun fire.  You lift your head slightly and catch a glimpse of an older
 man at the edge of the dock, firing away at the boat.  You surmise that
 it's Jimmy, but can't be sure.

 The attack only lasts for a few seconds before the speeding boat is out
 of reach.  You slowly get to your feet and look around.  You can't
 believe your eyes.  One of the bullets hit the steering wheel dead
 center.  There's practically nothing left of it.

 The boat continues to speed away from the shore at about 25 knots,
 that's the good news.  The bad news is that without a steering wheel,
 who knows where you're headed.

 Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, a steady rain starts
 to fall.  You glance up at the skies ahead and it doesn't look good.
 The wind is starting to swirl and the sea water is starting to get
 agitated.  The boat continues to speed straight out to sea as it pounds
 into the waves of the choppy water.

>throw tv in water
 You can't put anything into the ocean.

 The rain picks up and is now pelting you constantly.  You see several
 flashes of lightning and a few moments later, they are followed by the
 sound of thunder echoing in the distance.  The boat continues to speed
 straight out to sea as it pounds into the waves of the choppy waters.

>throw tv overboard
 I don't know the word "overboard".

>close hatch
 Closed.

 The driving rain is making it very hard for you to see.  More flashes
 of lightning illuminate the dark skies and the waves are starting to
 reach the boat deck.  The storm is upon you.  The boat catches a couple
 of waves and actually goes airborne for a moment.  The impact knocks
 you back and you hold onto the railing for dear life.  You needed both
 your hands for that last wave that rocked the boat so you are no longer
 carrying any possessions.

 A large wave crashes onto the deck and you catch a glimpse of the
 funnel being carried overboard by the water.

>winnable
 The game is in a winnable state.

>throw tv
 In order to throw the portable TV, you should be holding it.

 The sheets of rain are making it almost impossible for you to keep your
 eyes open.  The thunder and lightning are no longer separated by time.
 Each bolt of lightning is immediately followed by a tremendous clap of
 thunder.  It appears as if you're smack in the middle of a horrible
 storm.

 The boat speeds along and catches a large wave.  The back of the boat
 becomes submerged in water as enormous waves wash up on the deck.

 A huge wave spills across the deck and picks up the window screen.  You
 watch it float to the back of the boat where it disappears into the
 dark waters.

 cabin.

 You whip your head around and watch in terror as the boat hatch starts
 to buckle.  An instant later the hatch door explodes open, allowing an
 incredible amount of water to fill the cabin.  You fight your way to
 the hatch opening to escape but the water pressure is just too much.
 You are pinned against the back wall as you try to catch your breath.
 A moment later you are submerged in dark cold water.  The silence is
 eerie.  So is death.

 cabin.  Just as the boat appears to hit its stride, you hear gun shots.

 Your instincts take over and you dive to the floor, your possessions
 scattering on the deck floor.  You roll onto your stomach and cover
 your head with your hands, desperately trying to take cover from the
 gun fire.  You lift your head slightly and catch a glimpse of an older
 man at the edge of the dock, firing away at the boat.  You surmise that
 it's Jimmy, but can't be sure.

 The attack only lasts for a few seconds before the speeding boat is out
 of reach.  You slowly get to your feet and look around.  You can't
 believe your eyes.  One of the bullets hit the steering wheel dead
 center.  There's practically nothing left of it.

 The boat continues to speed away from the shore at about 25 knots,
 that's the good news.  The bad news is that without a steering wheel,
 who knows where you're headed.

>set throttle to stop
 I don't know the word "stop".

>set throttle to neutral
 You move the throttle to neutral.  The engines quiet down and the boat
 decelerates.  After a few moments, the boat comes to a full stop.

 Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, a steady rain starts
 to fall.  You glance up at the skies ahead and it doesn't look good.
 The wind is starting to swirl and the sea water is starting to get
 agitated.  The boat continues to speed straight out to sea as it pounds
 into the waves of the choppy water.

 Lost at Sea, in the Boat
 You're in a decent size boat, which is currently floating idly in
 the open, albeit turbulent, sea.  You're not very familiar with boats
 and most of the features of this craft are not recognizable.

 An open hatch is here, which leads down to the cabin.  Just beyond the
 hatch, is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the
 outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently

 Small Cabin
 You're hunched over in a tiny cabin.  The room isn't much bigger

 You see a dresser and a bed here.

 You feel the boat rocks back and forth in the choppy water.

 You can hear thunder rumbling in the distance as the boat rocks back

 The boat brutally rocks back and forth but manages to stay afloat.  The
 closed hatch door appears to keep the water from pouring into the cabin
 but the violent motion of the boat is throwing you about.  You feel a
 tremendous wave crash the side of the boat and you go flying across the
 tiny cabin.  Another wave sends you flying in the opposite direction.
 Just as you get back to your feet, the boat appears to almost tip over.
 You fall backwards and crack your head against the small dresser.  The
 last thing you remember before you lose consciousness is the incredible
 pain.

 You wake up many hours later with the boat rocking gently back and
 forth.  Looks like you and the boat survived the storm.

 Private Beach, in the Boat
 You're in a decent size boat, which is run aground on a beach of a
 private island.  You're not very familiar with boats and most of the
 features of this craft are not recognizable.

 An open hatch is here, which leads down to the cabin.  Just beyond the
 hatch, is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the
 outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently
 secured by a gas cap.

>out
 Before you disembark, you leave your possessions on the boat deck.  You
 figure that you'll need both hands to navigate the water.  You jump out
 of the boat and land in shallow water.  There's nothing like touching
 terra firma after spending countless hours on a boat.  You walk toward
 the shore admiring the beauty of the cove the boat decided to dock at.

 Rocky Shore
 You're standing on the shore of a rocky stretch of beach on what
 some might consider a paradise.  To the west is a lush forest that
 extends high up into the only mountain on the island.  The beach is
 nature at its best.  Sandpipers dart the beach, running toward the
 water and then retreating when the surf breaks.

 The water is sparkling due to the bright sun rising from the east.  The
 wind has died down considerably and is now a gentle zephyr blowing in
 from the shore.  There's something to be said for the morning after a
 storm.  The rocky beach continue north and south.

 Sandy Beach
 This stretch of beach has much more sand and barely any rocks.  The
 western side is still protected by the lush forest and the water is
 very inviting here. The sun bounces off the water making this area very
 surreal.  You can retreat back toward the boat by going south and the
 beach continues north for a while before it takes a sharp left turn.

>go north
 As you prepare to continue down the stretch of beach, a small beagle
 runs up to you and starts wagging its tail.  You stop in your tracks
 and bend down to pet the dog.  It reciprocates by licking your face.

>examine dog
 The dog is brown and white with streaks of black.  It's constantly
 sniffing something, probably in search of food.

 "Godzilla!" shouts a short elderly man.  "Why did you run away from
 me?" questions the man as if he's fully prepared for the dog to answer
 him.  The beagle sniffs a pile of seaweed and then makes a beeline
 toward the old man.  The man then looks up to you and smiles.

 "Well, hello there," says the man as he walks up to you.  "I reckon
 that you were caught in that horrible storm last night?" questions the
 man as he glances over your shoulder at the boat that's run aground.

 You extend your hand and introduce yourself, though you quickly realize
 he is not a baseball fan since he didn't recognize the name.  You learn
 that his name is Joe and that you washed up on his private island.  He
 tells you more about himself than you can possibly remember and he
 guides you back to his estate.

 You explain to him the incredible thirty-six hour stretch you've just
 lived and how lucky you are to be alive.  He listens attentively during
 your walk, but you can tell from his reaction that he can't relate; his
 daily life is much different here.  You do learn that apart from
 several boats, Joe has his own air strip with a single engine Cessna on
 the island.  You'll be home in several hours.

 The two of you seem to hit it off during your fifteen minute walk to
 his estate, but you're just relieved that you'll be able to see your
 wife and kids shortly.

 "Here we are," says Joe as he leads you into the living room.  "You can
 use the phone there," he says as he points to a small end table near
 the sofa.  "Once you've called your wife and let her know the plan, you
 can freshen up in the bathroom," mentions Joe.  "I'll let Mary know
 that you're here.  She'll probably bring you something to eat,"
 chuckles Joe, aware that you're probably starving as well.

 Joe then leaves the room.

 Living Room
 You're in a large living room, overlooking the ocean.  It's
 furnished quite nicely and appears to be well taken care of.  Hanging
 on the walls are several paintings that look like they belong in a
 museum.  The granite fireplace anchors the living room with the sofa
 and chairs centered accordingly.  There is no TV or radio and you
 gather that this room is set up as an ideal conversation place.

 The east wall is made up of four extremely large floor to ceiling
 windows that give an exceptional view of the island.  Near the sofa,
 sitting on a small end table, is a phone.

>call wife
 You pick up the phone and dial your number.  After a couple of rings,
 you're greeted by the precious sound of your wife's voice.  She
 immediately starts to cry when she hears your voice and you do your
 best to soothe her.  You tell her that you're stranded off a private
 island near Martha's Vineyard and that the owner is flying you home in
 his private Cessna.  You tell her that you should be arriving at New
 Bedford's airport within two hours and that you'll see her then.

 You avoid telling her all the details of your ordeal and manage to
 quench her thirst for information by saying that you're fine and that
 you'll explain everything to her shortly.  You tell her to give the
 kids a kiss for you and then hang up the phone.

 Godzilla runs into the room and sniffs your leg for a second.  He wags
 his tail several times, sniffs around the sofa and then darts out of
 the room.

>hint
 There are no more hints, but the end is near!

>winnable
 The game is in a winnable state.

>call police
 I don't know the word "police".

>call 911
 I don't know how to call the number 911.

 "Hi Jake," says a soft voice.

 You turn around and see an elderly woman standing at the entrance of
 the room.

 "Joe told me your story, I can't believe what happened to you, you poor
 soul.  By the way, I'm Mary, Joe's better half," she grins as she
 places a platter containing coffee, juice and a blueberry muffin down
 on the end table.

 You return the greeting and thank her for the hospitality.  You
 exchange several more pleasantries before she excuses herself.

>drink coffee
 You sip the coffee.

 Godzilla comes streaking into the room again.  He immediately notices
 the blueberry muffin and before you can salvage it, he snags it from
 the silver platter and consumes it whole.  He sniffs the area for a
 moment and then leaves just as quick as he appeared.

 You take a bite of the blueberry muffin.  You take another bite.  You
 then realize just how hungry you are and finish it off.

 Godzilla comes streaking into the room again.  He sniffs the air, quite
 confident that a meal was here, but finds nothing.  He sniffs around
 the end table for a moment and then leaves.

>drink coffee
 You sip the coffee.

 Mary walks into the room and asks if you would like to use the
 bathroom.  You respond accordingly and are promptly escorted to the
 washroom.

 You spend several minutes taking care of what you need to do and come
 out feeling very refreshed.  You retrace your steps back into the
 living room, hoping that Joe is there waiting for you.  You're eager to
 get back to your family.

>oops platter
 You see nothing remarkable about the silver platter.  Sitting on the
 platter is a cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice.

 "You ready?" quips Joe as he enters the room.

 You look up and smile at Joe.  "You bet!" you reply as you follow Joe
 out of the room.

 You're still a little apprehensive that he's the pilot, but you figure
 you've just about had enough of boats and it will be the quickest way
 home.  Yes home. That's where you need to be.  You've had enough
 adventure to last a lifetime.

 You follow Joe out of the estate, but not without first saying good-bye
 to Mary, and of course, Godzilla.  Joe motions for you to get into the
 golf cart and you're whisked away to the airfield.  A few minutes later
 you arrive at the Cessna.

 The plane looks brand new and well maintained.  He reminds you that he
 has it serviced every month and that he's been flying for almost forty
 years.  It comforts you somewhat, but not entirely.

 You're then led into the aircraft through a small door in the cabin and
 after a sharp left turn, you enter the cockpit.  You're amazed at how
 small it is but beggars can't be choosers, so you strap yourself in the
 passenger's seat.  The passenger seat harness uses a five point
 restraint and looks pretty solid.

 Joe then sits down in the pilot's chair, straps himself in and starts
 the engine.  You look down at his flimsy two piece seat belt and
 chuckle.  You're finally glad that you're the passenger.  A few moments
 later, the plane starts rolling down the runway.

 Cockpit, buckled in the passenger's seat
 As the plane accelerates, you glance over to Joe; he looks as calm
 as can be.  You look down at the instrument panel and are immediately
 hit with sensory overload.  There are more displays, dials, lights and
 indicators than you could have possibly imagined.  You can't even make
 out the speed or altitude displays, there are just too many of them.

 Joe tells you to hang on, this part can be bumpy at times.

 "Bumpy?" you question Joe.  "I thought you told me that this was smooth
 sailing from start to finish?"

 "Heh heh," he chuckles.  "Just sit back and relax," he replies as the
 plane leaves the ground, shakes violently for a moment and then eases
 up.  "Like I said, no sweat!" he continues, almost as if he's toying
 with you.  "The rest of the ride will be a breeze, Jake.  I promise."

 Joe picks up the receiver to the radio and mumbles something into it.
 After several confirmations, he places the receiver back on the radio.

>hint
 There are no more hints, but the end is near!

>wait
 Time passes...

 The plane continues to climb, giving you an incredible view of the
 small chain of islands.  Joe had mentioned earlier that most of the
 islands are uninhabited and that you were lucky you landed on his.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The plane ascends to its cruising altitude and appears to be as steady
 as a rock.  You were a bit apprehensive of the possible turbulence at
 this height, but the cool clear weather conditions are apparently
 optimal for flying.

 Joe points at an island off in the distance and remarks that it's
 Martha's Vineyard.  You play the part and appear interested, even
 though your thoughts of getting home are consuming you.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The plane is finally flying over land again.  Joe mentions that the
 approach to New Bedford airport is literally minutes away.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Joe picks up the radio receiver and signals air traffic control that
 he's ready for his approach.  You glance out the window, finally able
 to relax a little, knowing that within fifteen minutes or so you'll be
 surrounded by your family.

 Your daydreaming is interrupted by the repeated request of the air
 traffic controller to confirm the landing pattern and by the sudden
 altitude change of the plane.

 You turn to look at Joe and gasp.  He's slumped over in his chair,
 radio receiver on the cockpit floor, squawking for confirmation.  Joe
 doesn't say a word.

 The plane pitches forward and you hang on for dear life.  It starts to
 nose dive toward Earth and there's not much you can do.  All of the
 loose items in the plane are thrown toward the back wall of the plane
 cabin.  You can't see much, your brain is having a hard enough time
 processing the incredible sound the plane is making as it plummets
 toward Earth.  You don't feel a thing at Ground Zero.

 Cessna cabin
 You're in the tiny cabin of the plane.  There's not much room here,

 You see a red parachute and a blue parachute here.

 The Cessna continues to tremble.

 You almost lose your balance as the airplane dips slightly.

 Okay, you're now wearing the red parachute.

 You open the door and the wind almost knocks you back.

 The sound coming from the single engine starts to worry you.  The speed

 Which parachute do you mean, the red parachute, or the blue parachute?

>red
 The parachute is opened by pulling it's appropriate cord.

 The engine stalls as the plane continues its descent toward earth.

>pull cord
 Which cord do you mean, the long black cord, the short white cord, the
 long green cord, or the short orange cord?

>examine red
 The red parachute is the larger of the two.  It is neatly bundled up
 and contains the necesary straps and belts to secure it to your body.
 On the right side of the parachute are two cords, one long and black,
 the other short and white.  Each cord has a small tag attached to it.

 The sound of the airplane flying without its engine is starting to get
 on your nerves.

>examine long black tag
 I don't see any long black tag here.

>examine long black
 The long black cord is attached to the red parachute.  It has a small
 tag hanging off the end of it.

 The wings of the aircraft are now shaking violently as it races toward

 You then grab the side of the door jam, bend one knee and jump.  You

 Your body jerks back as your descent toward Earth slows down immensely.

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

 While floating to Earth, you watch in horror as Joe's airplane crashes
 into a small body of water.  It appears as if nobody got hurt, apart
 from poor Joe.  There's no way he could have survived that crash.  A
 moment later, the Cessna disappears under water.

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait

>wait
 Time passes...

 The ground quickly approaches and you brace for impact.  You land
 harder than expected and do a nifty tuck and roll.  The parachute drags
 your body for several feet before you come to a full stop.  You can't
 believe you're alive.

 You look around and see nothing but cows; just your luck, you happen to
 land right in the middle of a cow pasture.  Thankfully, you managed to
 avoid colliding with one of them.  As you regain your senses, you get
 to your feet and notice several people running toward you.

 Several folks help you remove the parachute and comment on the plane
 landing in the water just outside the farm grounds.  You hang your head
 in shame; you should have saved Joe.  Now he's dead.

 Several minutes later, you are escorted to a paramedic who checks you
 out.  You refuse to ride in the ambulance and ask for a police escort
 home instead; you've been away from your wife and kids far too long.

 Interestingly enough, the police officer mentions on the ride home that
 one of kidnappers was mortally wounded during the money exchange and
 that the other man was apprehended at his beach house later that
 evening.  You're glad that Bobby and Tommy got their just due.

 The reunion with your family is a precious moment.  After swapping
 hugs, kisses and stories, you manage to catch a few winks.  After all,
 Game One of The Series is tonight.  You just hope that you don't have
 to hit the game winning home run again.

 You were:
 Excited by the opportunity to hit the game-winning home run;
 Anxious after barely fouling off a pitch;
 Distressed about being in the trainer's room wounded;
 Tranquil when you realized you had to travel via ambulance;
 Frightened after the ambulance was involved in an accident;
 Terrified when you hung upside down on the stretcher;
 Encouraged after you survived the forest fire;
 Apprehensive of the house on the beach;
 Incredulous when you stumbled onto a crime in progress;
 Pessimistic about getting out of the trunk alive;
 Overwhelmed by Bobby's and Tommy's plan;
 Concerned that you only had a few minutes to plan an escape in the
 bathroom;
 Optimistic that your Swiss army knife would save the day;
 Desensitized when you ran out of emotional support;
 Satisfied when you ate hot pizza;
 Felicitous after you discovered an escape option;
 Indignant when you caused the shelf to fall in the cellar;
 Rejuvenated after you stepped outside for the first time at the
 cabin;
 Delighted after you landed safely in the barn;
 Gratified when you found a way to get gas from the barn;
 Mendacious when you destroyed the light;
 Thrilled that you finally started the boat;
 Flabbergasted at your predicament in the boat;
 Serene after you survived the storm on the boat;
 Sanguine upon touching terra firma;
 Hopeful that Joe would be the savior;
 Emotional after you spoke to your wife;
 Satiated after you ate that delicious blueberry muffin;
 Panicky when you saw Joe slumped over in his chair;
 Abhorrent for leaving Joe in the plane.

 You finished the game, but did you really WIN?

 One of them mentions that they found the body of an elderly man near a
 large tree.  They ask you why you think his parachute didn't open, but
 you don't offer a reply.  The guilt almost consumes you as you say
 nothing.

 Several minutes later, you are escorted to a paramedic who checks you
 out.  You refuse to ride in the ambulance and ask for a police escort
 home instead; you've been away from your wife and kids far too long.

 Interestingly enough, the police officer mentions on the ride home that
 one of kidnappers was mortally wounded during the money exchange and
 that the other man was apprehended at his beach house later that
 evening.  You're glad that Bobby and Tommy got their just due.

 The reunion with your family is a precious moment.  After swapping
 hugs, kisses and stories, you manage to catch a few winks.  After all,
 Game One of The Series is tonight.  You just hope that you don't have
 to hit the game winning home run again.

 You were:
 Excited by the opportunity to hit the game-winning home run;
 Anxious after barely fouling off a pitch;
 Distressed about being in the trainer's room wounded;
 Tranquil when you realized you had to travel via ambulance;
 Frightened after the ambulance was involved in an accident;
 Terrified when you hung upside down on the stretcher;
 Encouraged after you survived the forest fire;
 Apprehensive of the house on the beach;
 Incredulous when you stumbled onto a crime in progress;
 Pessimistic about getting out of the trunk alive;
 Overwhelmed by Bobby's and Tommy's plan;
 Concerned that you only had a few minutes to plan an escape in the
 bathroom;
 Optimistic that your Swiss army knife would save the day;
 Desensitized when you ran out of emotional support;
 Satisfied when you ate hot pizza;
 Felicitous after you discovered an escape option;
 Indignant when you caused the shelf to fall in the cellar;
 Rejuvenated after you stepped outside for the first time at the
 cabin;
 Delighted after you landed safely in the barn;
 Gratified when you found a way to get gas from the barn;
 Mendacious when you destroyed the light;
 Thrilled that you finally started the boat;
 Flabbergasted at your predicament in the boat;
 Serene after you survived the storm on the boat;
 Sanguine upon touching terra firma;
 Hopeful that Joe would be the savior;
 Emotional after you spoke to your wife;
 Satiated after you ate that delicious blueberry muffin;
 Panicky when you saw Joe slumped over in his chair;
 Indomitable -- need I say more;
 Shocked that you lost your grip on Joe.

 You finished the game, but did you really WIN?

 Inside the Barn
 You're inside an old barn, dimly lit by several windows near the
 roof line and the window that you squeezed through.  The barn appears
 as if it houses a boat in the winter, judging by a boat trailer near
 the rear of the barn.  Most of the room is occupied by various items,
 mostly worthless.

 Two large doors, which are closed, are to the south.  A large wooden
 crate is here, under the barn window.
 You see a gas container, a funnel, and a two-liter plastic Pepsi
 bottle here.  The gas container seems to contain some gas.

 Cessna cabin
 You're in the tiny cabin of the plane.  There's not much room here,
 and you need to duck your head as you move around in the cabin.  The
 closed cabin door is to the east.  You can enter the cockpit by going
 north.
 Joe is here, lying on the floor, unconscious from an apparent heart
 attack or stroke.

>tie receiver cord to orange cord
 You tie the end of the receiver cord to the short orange cord.

 The pitch of the plane is making it very hard for you to do anything.
 Your rendezvous with Earth is fast approaching.

>get receiver cord
 You already have the receiver!

 The beeping and humming coming from the cockpit panel is driving you
 nuts.  Every light and display is indicating a problem with the plane;
 one look out the window and you can figure that out all by yourself.

>jump
 You walk up to the cabin door, look out at the open sky and then
 prepare to jump out of the plane.  You glance down at Joe, clinging to
 life.  You briefly inspect the red parachute and hope that you put it
 on correctly.

 You then grab the side of the door jam, bend one knee and jump.  You
 actually catch yourself screaming "Geronimo!" as you clear the plane.

 You aren't prepared for the tremendous jolt your body receives and
 before you can compensate, you're stripped of your possessions.
 Fortunately, you manage to hang on to Joe.

 Racing toward Earth
 You're currently racing toward Earth at break-neck speed.  Your best
 guess is that you're less than 10,000 feet from land.

 orange cord of the the blue parachute.

 The plane continues its steep descent toward Earth.  It's a matter of

>open door
 You open the door and the wind almost knocks you back.

 The Cessna is starting to shake violently.  You're probably no more
 than ten thousand feet from earth right now, barely enough time for a
 parachute to open properly.

>jump
 You walk up to the cabin door, look out at the open sky and then
 prepare to jump out of the plane.  You glance over at Joe lying on the
 cabin floor, clinging to life.  You hope that his parachute will
 somehow save his life.  You briefly inspect the red parachute and hope
 that you put it on correctly.

 You then grab the side of the door jam, bend one knee and jump.  You
 actually catch yourself screaming "Geronimo!" as you clear the plane.

 The radio receiver is ripped from your hand since it was tied to Joe's
 parachute in the plane.

>pull receiver cord
 You try to yank on the receiver cord, but there's not enough tension to
 snap the short orange cord and open Joe's parachute.

>pull red cord
 I don't see any red cord here.

>pull black cord
 You yank on the long black cord and it separates from the red
 parachute.  Uh oh.  You let go of it.

 You're beginning to wonder how much longer you have before impact.

>pull white cord
 You pull the short white cord and the red parachute begins to open.
 Your body jerks back and you lose your grip on Joe.  His body slips
 through your hands and you helplessly watch his body fall toward Earth.
 The radio receiver also slips through your fingers, and you watch it
 and Joe silently fall toward the ground.

 Meanwhile, your descent toward Earth slows down tremendously.

 snap the short orange cord and open Joe's parachute.

>drop joe
 You let Joe go and watch him slowly move away from you.  Gravity is a
 wonderful thing.  Joe only floats away several feet because you're
 still holding on to the radio receiver which is attached to the blue
 parachute.

 You're beginning to wonder how much longer you have before impact.

>pull receiver cord
 You pull the receiver cord, which in turn pulls the short orange cord
 and Joe's parachute begins to open.  The receiver is then ripped from
 your hand and snaps toward the blue parachute.  Joe's body then shoots
 straight up into the sky, or at least it appears that way.  In reality,
 you're falling thirty-two feet per second and Joe is leisurely drifting
 toward Earth.

>pull black
 You yank on the long black cord and it separates from the red
 parachute.  Uh oh.  You let go of it.

 You're starting to panic.

>pull white
 You pull the short white cord and the red parachute begins to open.
 Your body jerks back as your descent toward Earth slows down immensely.

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

 While floating to Earth, you watch in horror as Joe's airplane crashes
 into a small body of water.  It appears as if nobody got hurt, apart
 from some poor fish.  A moment later, the Cessna disappears under
 water.

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

 The ground quickly approaches and you brace for impact.  You land
 harder than expected and do a nifty tuck and roll.  The parachute drags
 your body for several feet before you come to a full stop.  You can't
 believe you're alive.

 You look around and see nothing but cows; just your luck, you happen to
 land right in the middle of a cow pasture.  Thankfully, you managed to
 avoid colliding with one of them.  As you regain your senses, you get
 to your feet and notice several people running toward you.

 Several folks help you remove the parachute and comment on the plane
 landing in the water just outside the farm grounds.

 One of them mentions that the elderly man appears to have had a heart
 attack during the fall, but that the paramedics are on their way and
 that he's clinging to life.  You saved him.
