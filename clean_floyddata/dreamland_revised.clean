 I wrote my review of Dreamland a few weeks back, and then I deleted
 the app and said I was done. But I can't stop thinking about it. Not
 because the ads keep showing up (though they do, and whoever voiced
 that Nexus ad, fuck you forever) but because it was just... so good.
 Until the bullshit ending.

 Now that I know I'm not alone (hello AIXeddit! thank you for the cloud
 payments, no hard feelings on the overload!) I decided it was time to
 do something about it. I deserved better than this.  You deserved
 better than this.

 Given the price of REME devkits, I can't get my hands on one, and it's
 not like I have my Oni license anyway. And I'm shit for drawing, you
 don't want me trying to animate this. But I did get my hands on some
 really oldschool tech called Inform 7, which you're reading right now.

 That's right - this is interactive. I used a text adventure to build
 the end of Dreamland, the way it should have been.

 This is the ending we all should have had. Roll tape.

 Before we get going, one more thing. Did you have the content-locked

 Key Y if you had the content locked version, N if you had the unlocked

>describe game

 Hi, I'm EpicNightmare. If you're at my cloud, you know that already,
 but it's tripped all over AIXeddit now and I have no idea who's
 running it, so. (Enabled updates are the best.)

 If you haven't played Dreamland (by Wonderland's Alice) you should
 play it before playing this. I think Dreamland Revised is great,
 because I did the best I could, but it's also crammed full of
 spoilers.

 Here's my original review.

 ----------------------
  Dreamland (Wonderland's Alice)
 This is some new VR/AR thing I looked at last month. The gimmick is
 it's a game that you play in your dreams. I found the concept
 intriguing, so I hooked up the ol" REM Enhancer and downloaded the
 game's app to it. At first, I couldn't tell if the game was working
 (REME and other dreamtechs can be pretty buggy), but a few days in, I
 started having the trippiest dreams. A woman, dressed all in white
 with no eyes, asks me if I have visited the "Quartzian Palace". Far
 off in the distance, I see a castle that glows in many colors, but the
 way there always seems to be blocked by a chasm. Over many nights I
 struggled to find a way there, sometimes through bizarre dangers,
 often through places of great and strange beauty, until one night, I
 finally managed to find a way into the palaceâ€¦

 Aaaand it turns out the ending is some serious "Don't forget to drink
 your Ovaltine!" bullshit. Like, seriously. Watch it on Youtube if you
 don't believe me. It's such a shame, because the game was so cool up
 to that, but I honestly cannot recommend this game in good conscience
 thanks to that ending.

 I deleted the app off my REME the next day. I'm still getting ads in
 my sleep. Goddammit.
  ----------------------

 So what you want to do is get across the chasm and STOP THERE. Do NOT
 use your Visage to pass the portcullis, do NOT go into the Quartzian
 Palace, that's what trips off the ads. Believe me you do not want that
 shit. Come back and play the REAL ending here.

 If you don't know how to work this game, key HELP ME.

>help me

 Okay, you've never played a game like this. Neither had I. They are
 completely fucking weird, so don't feel bad.

 The big problem I had when I was making this game is that Dreamland
 was a fully enabled system and this isn't.

 The way this is <span class="floydstyle em">supposed</span> to work is that you key what you
 want to do, and then the game does it. But Inform 7 is from 2020, so
 instead of understanding English, it has a list of verbs and a list of
 nouns and it pairs them off in grammar structures. Like this:

 EXAMINE (something) &lt;-- look at whatever-it-is
  TAKE (something) &lt;-- pick something up
  PUT (something) IN (something) &lt;-- you get the idea by now, right?

 Whoever made this system made some really weird decisions. For
 example, the built-in input to find out what you're carrying was
 INVENTORY, but that isn't even a verb. I made it so you can key WHAT
 DO I HAVE instead, because that makes a lot more sense.

 The built-in input to walk around is with compass directions, like
 NORTH SOUTH EAST etc etc. First off, this bears no relation to how
 people walk around in real life, and second off, it's not like
 Dreamland had a stable compass. I put in a thing so you can just key
 GO (wherever) and go where you want to go. GO only works when you're
 right near where you want to go, so don't try to teleport around the
 map that way.

 The worst part of this was figuring out how to convert enabled stuff
 into this system. Example, we all know how to change the Visage from
 state to state. But how do you describe that in just one verb? And
 there are like forty different names for the different states,
 depending on whose cloud you hit. I went with ASSUME VISAGE and
 Depardu's emotive list, like ASSUME DETERMINED VISAGE, but you can use
 the Allis creature list instead if you want. Key SHOW LIST if you need
 a reminder.

 There aren't any puzzles here, so if you paid attention when you
 played the original, you shouldn't have any trouble. If you played it
 too long ago and your memory is flaky, key REMIND ME for a reminder.
 If you can't figure out the right input, key WHAT DO I DO NEXT to get
 the next command (or just NEXT, I made it easy.)

>show list

 The Depardu list:

 clear
 contaminated
 cruel
 determined
 implacable
 patient
 serene
 sorrowing
 subtle

 Of course some of you are like "where's the other 464?", but there's
 no point in me putting them all in, since you know from Ariadne that
 these are the ones in the Palace.

>assume serene visage

 You already have the visage of serenity.

>assume subtle visage

 You said your Dreamland was unlocked. Stop cowering from yourself.

>assume patient visage

 You assume a grotesque visage, the visage of patience.

>examine me

 It's you.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(Troller, I have no clue what you look like. Fill it in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">yourself.</span>)

 You are wearing Mandelbrot's tattoo and carrying the lightning eye of
 Aladdin Sane. You have the visage of patience.

 (the lightning eye of Aladdin Sane)
 The eye is open.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(There were a lot of options, of course - this could've been the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">eye of Vecna, or the eye of Odin, or the eye of the Illuminati. But</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">this is the one I got, so it's the one I'm implementing here.</span>)

>examine tattoo

 It's a fully detailed tattoo of the Mandelbrot set. You got it from
 Adrien Douady.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(I guessed most people didn't transmute Douady's rabbit. If you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">did, this should be the Diva tattoo. You won't need it from here on in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">anyway. I just included it for completeness.</span>)

>xisage

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 It's grotesque to the touch.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(I couldn't figure out natural keys for the visage, so you have to</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End-World</span>
 The chasm lies behind you. The Quartzian Palace waits ahead. The
 thorny portcullis bars the way.

 A world-reflecting unicorn wanders with its head lowered along the
 railroad tracks.

>examine unicorn

 The unicorn isn't really grazing - just moving its head through the
 grass, switching its tail, occasionally shifting position. Its horn,
 hooves, and eyes have the distinctive glitter of dye-sensitized solar
 biofilm.

>pet unicorn

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine tracks

 There was a train and that is the truth.

>examine portcullis

 The only entrance to the castle is blocked by a portcullis. The
 portcullis's wooden bars swarm with sprouted thorns and vines.

>examine bars

 The only entrance to the castle is blocked by a portcullis. The

>open portcullis

 The portcullis doesn't honor patience.

>assume serene visage

 You assume a cold visage, the visage of serenity.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(Are you confused? You'd better key DESCRIBE GAME, unless you're</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">just kicking the scenery for fun. Or HELP ME is a good idea.)</span>
>assume determined visage

 You assume a whiskered visage, the visage of determination.

 The Quartzian Palace honors your determination. Vines reach out from
 the thorny portcullis to wrap about your torso. As they drag you
 forward, the portcullis bars part and you pass through safely.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rainbow Passage</span>
 You are inside the wall, lost in light and rainbows.

 The portcullis seals itself behind you.

>examine rainbows

 It shines with colors you don't even have names for.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(I know some people see colors they can recognize when they look</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">up at the Palace. But since no one agrees on what those colors ARE,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">this is what you get.</span>)

 You can't see any such thing.

>assume serene visage

 You assume a cold visage, the visage of serenity.

>assume clear visage

 You assume a scaled visage, the visage of clarity.

 You see the walls of the maze. You find your way through, and now you
 are in the Palace.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ballroom</span>
 A polished floor, and whirling dancers, and the smell of broken metal.
 A sound worth listening to. A heavy velvet curtain across the back,
 blocking you from the orchestral pi.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(Some of you are completely pissed at me right now. I don't blame</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you, because everything's been building up to the Ballroom, right? But</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">do you really want to fill out a thirty-part questionnare about the</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">I'm not spending the next four years on this.</span>)

>listen

 The rhythm blurs in your old ears, troller.

>examine curtain

 Decidedly opaque. Also heavy, dark, red.

>move curtain

 You strive to make your way across the floor, but the whirling dancers
 catch you up and throw you back again to the safety of the shore.

>smell

 It's a familliar smell.

>assume implacable visage

 You assume a metallic visage, the visage of implacability.

>assume determined visage

 You assume a whiskered visage, the visage of determination.

>assume cruel visage

 You assume a furred visage, the visage of cruelty.

>assume patient visage

 You assume a grotesque visage, the visage of patience.

>assume contanimated visage

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 You try to mingle with the crowd, but you don't have the connections
 to maneuver, and eventually the dancers throw you back on the shore.

 You said your Dreamland was unlocked. Stop cowering from yourself.

 4. Key PLAY (and the name of an instrument).

 You assume a mottled visage, the visage of pestilence.

 The dancers draw away from you, and the heavy curtain parts to reveal
 the orchestral pi. Walking in single file, the musicians abandon their
 posts and climb the steps, joining the dancers in a worried circle
 behind you.

>go orchestral

 Now you are in the orchestral pi, where you see yourself, a gravity
 dam, a Danish publication, a pulgada, a Boleslaw Chrobry Crown, a
 Japanese neologism, a random article from Wikipedia, and a red
 herring, all abandoned.

>examine herring

 You strike up a sprightly tune on the red herring. The dancers return
 to the floor. Feet stamp. Skirts swirl.

 The orchestral pit lowers into the ground, taking you with it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Red Queen's Chambers</span>
 The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries
 that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy
 folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber
 only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the
 decorations. The panes here were scarlet - a deep blood color.

 The Red Queen is here. RUN.

>run

 You run. And the Red Queen pursues. And the tapestries and the other
 things round you never change their places at all: however fast you
 go, you never seem to pass anything.

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

 <span class="floydstyle em">chanson</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">strophe</span>, and nothing after.

 heel. You fall backward. You fall....

 The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the
 threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have
 died.

 the sand. Briny grey stretches away on one side and translucent sand

 the glowing green above. Similar cracks stretch through the
 translucent sand below.

 You can see the woman in white with no eyes here.

 The woman watches your efforts impassively. After a long, considering
 moment, she waves you out of the way, kneels, and sets her hands to
 either side of the crack in the sand.

 She shoves hard, and the crack gapes wider still, revealing a stairway
 into the earth. She straightens, dusts off her robes, and descends the
 chthonian stair.

>go down

 You walk down the stair, duck through the curtain of falling sand, and
 come out at the entrance to a small town.

>give eye to pemphredo

 The Pemphredo closes her hands about your offering. She holds up the
 eye, then swings it in a slow arc to survey the world around her.

 Then she passes the eye to her sister, and as she does, you notice the
 youth leaving her face. Her sister passes the eye along and grows grey
 and withered in turn, and all three sisters hunch in upon themselves
 as they encircle the eyeball.

 The gates of Cisthene open to you, and you go down to the Sunlight
 Gardener's School, where the citizens embrace you in broad triangles
 and uplift your spirit nineteen times.
