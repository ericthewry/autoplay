 <span class="floydstyle subheader">WARNING! This is not a nice game.</span>
 This is your favorite place.
 A small, almost forgotten lake just outside the city limits. His
 parents own the cabin here, but they never go here. And you have to
 look for it, deep in the wood, so nobody ever comes here.
 But even though he's here, lying beside you in the tall grass, you
 can still feel work in your bone. It's only Tuesday, and your eyes are
 already dry, your shoulders clenched, and the spot where the headset
 grabs onto your head has turned into an annoying small red dot. You
 rub it absent-mindedly and look at him. He seems distracted today,
 distant somehow.
 "Thanks for picking me up, honey."
 He nods and stares up at the full moon.
 "Are you allright?"
 He raises his hip awkwardly and rummages around in his pocket. As you
 watch, a small shiver runs down your arms. It's been a warm June day,
 and you're still only wearing your t-shirt. He rolls over, his eyes
 warm and kind, and raises the knife.

 You feel the the knife plunge deep into your chest - sudden, burning,
 confused pain. You scream out and he rolls over and covers your mouth,
 his calloused, warm hand terribly familiar. You try to writher away
 from under him, but all strength has left you, and you want to scream,
 to bite, but you can just wriggle helplessly. Tears burn in your eye
 and you choke on something metallic and viscous. And then you don't
 wriggle anymore, your legs go numb, and you feel your useless heart
 still pump blood through the hole in your chest. He looks at you, and
 above the hands that killed you his eyes are calm and friendly. "I'm
 sorry, dear" he whispers. "I just don't love you anymore."
 You look up at the moon, that old mistress, that has looked down on
 all our wars and all our blood, but there is no dignity in death. He
 crinkles his nose and you feel the warmth spread from your crotch down
 your leg. And then it ends.

 But you can't go on.

 The Grass is long and wild, and apruptly turns into a sandy beach to

 There is a dark, wet spot in the grass, and from it drag marks lead
 west.

 You take a step off the pier, fearing for a second you'll just sink

 all unpleasant.  You cast a last look down before going on.
 And something looks back. A white face, beneath the pier, hands
 reaching up. For a second, a voice, distant, like through rain

 "You weren't ... the first. Avenge us.  You can't touch ... can't
 see, but you can ... possess."

 The woman sinks, sinks. Is gone. You continue on.

 This game was written for the 2015 Shufflecomp by  Eldridge Murray. It
 is a short horror game and contains some graphic content. It's
 inspired by "The ghost who walks" by Karen Elson. I've received an
 excellent number of songs, and choosing one was hard. Everyone one of
 them deserved a game.

>examine body


 They say sleeping people are beautiful, and you always thought that
 was a lie. Sleeping people are ugly. And that's how you look, one eye
 half-closed, the other staring mindlessly, mouth slightly agape. Your
 torso a mess of blood, with something blue shimmering inside the
 wound. Ugly.

>examine blue


 Some unthinkable part of your viscera. You clench your hands as you
 remember the pain. So sudden, so severe.

>examine him


 You used to gently mock his hipster looks, the weird, spotty beard,
 checkered shirts and cord trousers. And the scene is so surreal. It's
 like an ad. The shovel, the small hole before him. And now you hate
 him. Everything about him. You want to see him suffer.

 A mouse runs out from the undergrowth and sits by the fire pit.

>possess mouse


 There's something in the mouse - quick, alert, and scared, so scared,
 always scared - but you manage to wrestle control from it. The world
 seems gargantuan and hostile. It takes a moment to get your bearings.
 Four feet, the unconsciously swishing tail. The heart, hammering so
 fast inside your chest.



 There is a huge heap of discarded food wrappers, beer cans, used
 napkins and the like beside the fire pit.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">branch</span>
 You are on the branch overlooking the fire pit.

 An old bird's nest sits here.



 It has been long abandoned.



 That's not something you can enter.



 You push with all the strength of your little legs, and the nest
 skitters off the branch and tumbles lightly into the pit below.

 In the fire pit are a nest and a lighter.



 This dangerous act would achieve little.



 It isn't something you can switch.



 You quickly dart from the mouse into the lighter.
 You touch the lighter. There is that familiar scraping of the flint
 and a small spark, but the nest is not really dry enough on its own to
 catch fire.

  You quickly dart back into the mouse.



 Nothing obvious happens.



 You can't see any such thing.

 After nosing around in it for a bit, you discover a small bottle of

 You can't possess that.



 (first taking bottle of lighter fluid)
 It's too heavy.



 It isn't something you can open.



 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 You jump on the bottle and a little lighter fluid flies into the pit.

 You quickly dart from the mouse into the lighter.
 You touch the lighter. There is that familiar scraping of the flint
 and a small spark, and the fluid lights up instantaneously. The nest
 catches fire, and soon there is a nice fire going in the pit.
 There is movement at the shore. A figure appears on the pier.
 You leave the mouse and it darts away.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pier</span>
 The wooden pier extends a few yards into the lake. Looks like some
 repairwork has been done on it recently, as the outer end looks new
 and shiny in places.
 Out in the lake, in silhouette, the island is barely visible.

 Paul stands here, looking wearily at the fire on the island.

 A nail gun is sticking up, front forward, between the boards.



 He is about to turn back as the nail hits him in the Adam's apple. He
 stands for a second, and slowly grabs his throat like a surprised
 baronet in a soap opera. He takes one step forward and slowly turns on
 the spot. Blood gushes down his shirt with every heartbeat,
 statisfyingly black and plentiful. He falls forward, chipping one of
 his teeth on the wood.
 You kneel beside him, wishing you could pick up that little bit of
 enamel as a memento.
 It takes him a few minutes to die, and you idly wonder if he will go
 on, or if he will have to stay, like you. Maybe for people like him
 death is the only exit there is.
 You look up, at the moon. The lake is silent.



     *** You found rest. ***



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last
 command?


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pier</span>

 You touch him, but there is something in him - warm, protective,
 fierce - and you shrink back.

 You really don't want to try that. What if you cannot leave?



 You touch the car, and it suddenly honks. He looks up, startled. For a
 few seconds he stands, breathing open-mouthed. Then he shrugs and gets
 back to digging.



 Your ghostly form doesn't allow for this anymore.

 Half an hour later, the old man goes to bed; you wait a few more
 minutes, until he starts snoring. When he's snoring, the way is clear;
 grab the keys from the table, and let's go pick Jane up.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Heading East</span>
 By Alex Davies
 First-time players should type ABOUT.
 Release 1 / Serial number 150507 / Inform v6.33 Library 6/11

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the living room</span>
 The room is dark and warm, it's a hot June night. There's barely a
 glimmer of light from the street, but you know where everything is:
 the TV and the couch on the east wall, the door to your room behind
 you, and the one for your Dad's on the opposite side, the dinner table
 kind of in the way, and the front door. The keys must be on the entry
 table, near the door; at least that's where they always are.

>touch entry table


 You touch the top of the entry table, expecting to find the keys...
 But you can't find them. Crap! You hope he put them somewhere else,
 because if they're still in his pants pockets, you're just gonna have
 to go back to bed.

>touch dining table


 Maybe the keys were left on that table... You carefully run your
 fingers on the surface of the table, but they're not here.

>touch tv


 You feel nothing unexpected.

>touch couch


 You get closer to the front of the couch and run your hands on it,
 just in case... ah! The car keys got stuck in the back of the couch.
 They must have fell from your dad's pocket. You grab them quietly,
 trying to not make them jingle too much.

>out


 You slowly, carefully put your shoes on, then unlock the door and
 leave quietly. Locking the door behind you without making any noise is
 always a bit scary, but you've mastered the trick; once it's locked,
 you wait a few minutes, just in case, but the light in your Dad's room
 remains off. You walk to the car, unlock it manually, and start it as
 smoothly as you can.
 You slow down when you reach Jane's block; but she's been posted
 behind that big oak since you texted her, and she climbs quickly in
 your car.
 "Hey" you nod.
 "Hey. Thanks for picking me up" she says as she put the guitar in the
 back of the car.
 "Yeah sure. I was worried you'd forget the guitar, forgot to remind
 you"
 "Well, we're going camping, of course I'm bringing it! ;)"
 "Haha yeah. Sounds great. You ok though? :/"
 "It's..." She sighs, exasperated. "My stupid sister and her stupid
 boyfriend"
 She doesn't say more. But there's no need. "Ok. Going east, then?"
 "Yeah. I'll tell you"

 "..."

 "Hey, wanna get pot?" she says out of the blue.
 "Haha. Sure, might as well, we're going to be up there a few hours eh?
 :)"
 "I know a guy. Go towards SFU, I'll tell you"
 "Ok. And we'll just stop at 7/11 for munchies?"
 "I brought chips"
 "Duuude, you rock :D"
 "I know duuude :D" You bump fists jokingly.

 "Is that the place?"
 "Yeah, that house there. Shit do you have money?"
 "How much do we need?"
 "20 bucks for an eighth :/"
 You count your change. "$8.75, you?"
 "Damn it, $6.75. We're short, like, 5 bucks :("
 You pause for a second. "Well... My dad usually has change lying
 around everywhere..."
 "Yeah but..." She stops, uneasy.
 "He won't mind... I mean if he asks I'll say it was for fast food or
 something ^^'"
 "Ok. You sure?"
 "Yeah. Besides, I haven't smoked in ages"
 "Hehe, k"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the car</span>
 The car is a Chevrolet... something. Like, it's not a truck, just a
 regular, dark red, automatic car. It's fine. Your dad always keeps
 change around, sometimes in the most random places, for like Tim
 Hortons, or groceries, or like to give to bums. He probably won't
 notice if you grab some, and he won't mind anyway.

 Jane is here, looking around her. "I dunno, where does he keep
 change?"

>look under seat


 You reach under the seat and pull it back a little, then look down.
 "There's nothing. How about you?"
 "Nah. Maybe if we..." she reaches under her seat awkwardly, and pats
 around on the floormat. "Mmmh... Pfff no there's nothing"
 "Let me see if I can..." You stick your arm under the seat, and fish
 around... Ah! That was definitely something cold, like metal. "I'll
 just... reach... and... Pff! Hey, a loonie!"
 "Jesus, your Dad *does* have change lying around everywhere"
 "Told you"

>inventory


 You are carrying your Dad's car keys, your Novice license, your
 cellphone and some change.

>examine license


 You got it six months ago. And six months ago, you started borrowing
 your Dad's car for a ride while he was sleeping. Pretty sure he knows
 (oh yeah, especially since that day where you and Jane forgot A & W
 bags in the car), but he's never mentioned it.

>examine cellphone


 It's just your cell phone. You've had it for a while, I guess. You
 don't use it much for calls, but you sure text.

>examine change


 Your money, plus Jane's, plus the change you found in the car, that
 makes it $16.50. In other words, not quite enough.

>open glove compartment


 "Hey, could you try the glovebox?"
 "Oh yeah, sure" She pops it open.
 "There's... Ah yeah, three quarters here"
 "Cool"

>examine door


 The car door, with a pretty deep compartment in which your dad keeps a
 few things, like his old CDs and his sunglasses.

>look in door compartment


 You reach inside the compartment. "Hey, there's actually a few coins
 here..."
 "Oh yeah?" She checks the one on her side.
 "Yeah... let's see... Like, three dimes"
 "I got a dime and two quarters"
 "Man, we're loaded!"

>examine floor mat


 It's a kind of plastic mat; an annoying plastic mat, because it always
 moves under your feet.

>look under it


 You lift the floormat, to see if anything fell under it... Mmh, no,
 there doesn't seem to be anything.
 "Ugh, it's..." says Jane, looking at her fingers.
 "Is it dirt?"
 "Yeah"
 "Come on, we're going in the woods, don't tell me that --"
 "Ya ya ya ya, I know!" she rolls her eyes. "Well, I can't... ah!"
 "Found anything?"
 "Yeah it's... ugh, just a quarter"
 "Hahaha"
 "Hey shut up, I worked hard for this one"
 ":p"

 "Man, there sure is a lot of places you can hide change in a car" she
 says.
 "Yeah. I'm sure you can hear all the coins when my Dad goes over a
 speed bump ^^"
 "Haha yeah"

>search floor


 You look under your feet, to see if anything fell... A-ha! There was a
 quarter between the edge of the floormat and the side of the console
 in the middle.
 "Cool! I can't really see anything on my side"

 You think for a second. "Are you sure it's gonna be ok? I mean, we
 have a lot of change... :/"
 "Ah, don't worry about that, I'm sure it'll be fine..."
 "Yeah but... I dunno"
 "Yeah well what's he gonna do? Make a fuss?"
 "Yeah, and then we won't have any"
 She shrugs. "It'll be fine, trust me"
 "K"

>examine back seat


 You can't really see behind, because twisting your neck is awkward,
 but there might be coins back there after all...

 You think for a second. "Are you sure it's gonna be ok? I mean, we
 have a lot of change... :/"
 "Ah, don't worry about that, I'm sure it'll be fine..."
 "Yeah but... I dunno"
 "Yeah well what's he gonna do? Make a fuss?"
 "Yeah, and then we won't have any"
 She shrugs. "It'll be fine, trust me"
 "K"

>jane, search back seat


 Jane has better things to do.

>jane, x back seat


 Jane has better things to do.

>search back seat


 "Oh yeah," you say, "do you think there's some in the back?"
 "Ah yeah maybe. I'll check"
 She throws her leg between the seats and climbs into the back of the
 car. "Well... Ah, there's like a dime here!" she says while checking
 in the seats. "And let's see... nothing on the rear deck, I think..."
 "Did you check behind the seats? Like, the pockets?"
 "Oh right, good call! Let's see..." she puts her hand in it and
 searches while making a face. "Yeah, there's... Hey, that's a loonie!"
 "Sweet!"
 "Yeah!... I'm just gonna come back from outside now"
 "Ya it's awkward as hell :p"
 She opens the passenger door and sits back in her seat.
 "Thanks duuude ;)"
 "Haha yeah you bet dude"

 "Hey, so... Have you been writing anything lately?"
 "Yeah..." you reply. "I mean nothing major, but yeah, a little bit.
 You?"
 "A song :) but I haven't finished it yet"
 "Cool. You'll show me?"
 "Sure, we'll write the rest when we're high :p"
 "Haha sounds good"

>examine dashboard


 Right under the windshield, where you're supposed to put your parking
 receipt.

>examine windshield


 It's just the windshield, with the dashboard under it; it's not really
 dirty right now, and you hope it won't be after your little trip to
 the mountains, so that your Dad doesn't notice. Hopefully.

>examine steering wheel


 The wheel is pretty high, but you don't mind, and then you can drum up
 your fingers on the dashboard when you're waiting at a long light.
 There's the horn in the middle, and various switches on the side.

>examine console


 Between the two seats, there's a few cupholders, and a little
 compartment that opens from the top.

 "Pff look at us, looking for dimes to get pot" you say jokingly.
 "Haha yeah, that's pretty bad"
 "I do want it pretty bad, so there's that"
 "Yeah, it's gonna be pretty awesome"

>examine cupholders


 There's two cupholders side-by-side in the console between the seats.
 They're good for soda, but the milkshakes from the place on Robson
 never quite fit. The trick is to drink a third of it, and then squish
 them in.

>look in them


 "Did we look here?"
 She shrugs.
 "There's a dime I think... Ugh, it's... stuck..."
 "Niiice. Covered in sugar?" she says.
 "Must be. Yuck, it sticks to my fingers"
 "Gross :p"

 "So your Dad still doesn't know?"
 "What, that I take the car sometimes?"
 "Yeah"
 "I dunno" you shrug. "I'm sure he knows, but he doesn't say anything"
 Pause.
 "Which is pretty cool I guess"
 "Yeah. Your Dad is cool"
 "Yeah, he's alright. We get along well. I mean, it could have been
 worse"
 "Yeah"

>look in console compartment


 You can't see any such thing.

>look in little compartment


 You open the small compartment. There's a box of Tic-Tacs there, and a
 few coins.
 "Sweet! That's like... 80 cents!"
 "That's all? Sucks :/ It was probably the most obvious place"
 "Yeah... I'm sure there's more lying around."

 "Alright, we have enough :D"
 "Yay! Ok, I'm going"
 "K. I hope it'll be fine..."
 "?"
 "With all that change and all..."
 She shrugs. "I don't care. I'll try it."
 And with that, she's out of the car.
 ...
 Yeah, he doesn't seem very chill. He's like laughing at her. But she
 doesn't move one bit. So he starts acting all important and macho --
 like, arms wide open moving a lot, his face kind of in her face. "u
 disrespecting me? i'm doing u a favor selling pot to a teenager and u
 come here with your lunch money? man i don't have time to waste", you
 can totally picture it. But she doesn't move one bit. Even crosses her
 arms, unimpressed like "r u done here bro".

 God, she's *amazing*. So determined and self-assured. You wish you
 could do that.

 The guy's still at it but she shrugs like "ok u don't want my money i
 guess". Then she starts to turn away but he grabs her by the arm; and,
 like, he starts getting angry like "wtf r u doing". And then bam --
 she gives him the money, like right in his hand, and she puts the
 other one out. And she got him, and he knows it, and he's like "pff
 whatever", and he gives her the pot. She nods a thank you and walks
 away; he looks at her while she walks away, shaking his head but
 almost grinning.
 "You ok?"
 "Yeah, no worries. He tried to make a fuss, but yknow. He had to I
 guess, but it's not like he didn't want to sell it to me so..."
 "Haha nice." You stop, unsure of what to say next. But you say it
 anyway. "You're amazing. Like, seriously"
 "Haha yeah thanks. I get around."
 "No, really! Hey how am I gonna get pot when you're gone?"
 "Haha. You're gonna miss me, eh?"
 "You kidding? Totally."

 You stop -- an awkward silence. It's not that funny I guess. Anyway,
 she breaks it:
 "So -- head east!"
 "East!!"


 "..."


 "So... yeah."


 "..."


 "What happened?" you ask, tentatively.
 "It's just... ugh. She's visiting, right?"
 "Right"
 "And she brought Brandon, you know, her fiancé"
 "Right"
 "And like... The guy's working in real estate out there in Toronto,
 right? So like, three-piece suit and the smile and oh i'm a people
 person right"
 "Right..."
 "Anyway. It's fine, except that he was like asking questions, like 'Oh
 well what good is an art degree anyway? It's not about quality anyway,
 all that contemporary shit...'"
 "Ugh, of course"
 "Yeah, that kind of guy! And like 'What are you going to Concordia
 for? You're gonna have to come back and live in your parents' basement
 anyway. It's not like it gives you a job!'"
 "?????"
 "Yeah! Total. Massive. Douchebag."
 ":/ sorry. Why does your sister like him?"
 "Ugh dunno. And like, she didn't like say anything! Like he was all
 laughing loud, and my sister was like looking at me... and I was like
 'Dude! How about, like, saying something! Control your man! I'm your
 sister, for fuck's sake!'"
 "Really?"
 "Yeah! ... well, no, not really. OF COURSE i didn't say anything,
 cause i'm stupid"
 ":("


 "Sorry" she says after a while.
 "That's fine"
 "It's just... Family's hard, yknow?"
 "Heh, tell me about it"
 "Well, no, I mean... ugh, sorry, I just"
 "Hey no, I know what you meant"
 "Yeah. Sorry. Ugh, I hate this"
 "Haha I know. Drives you crazy eh? Not finding the words. Like, for
 your songs too"
 "Pff whatever, writing nerd"
 "U jealous? :D"
 ":D"



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A remote place in the woods</span>
 Sitting in the grass on the side of a hill, with the forest all
 around, with a guitar, some pot, and your best friend. Best way to
 spend the night. You feel very good, completely in the moment,
 although you can't help but think about how it's the last few months,
 already nostalgic.

 Jane is sitting next to you, eating some chips.


>ask jane about school


 "So, how do you feel about this Concordia University?"
 "You know what, pretty good. I mean, Montreal sounds like such a... I
 dunno, like, a vibrant, and different, and exciting city -- and their
 campus is amazing apparently, and the classes I could take all sound
 so cool... I'm really gonna like it I think :D"
 "Cool! Sounds good. You sound excited :)"
 "Yeah well, I wouldn't be going there if I wasn't, right?"
 "Haha I guess yeah"

>ask jane about montreal


 "Have you ever been to Montreal?"
 "Nope, never been further east than Saskatoon" she replies. "You?"
 "When I was, like, 10. Apparently I hated it cause I couldn't read any
 of the signs -- I dunno, I just remember the theme park"
 "Haha, nice"

>ask jane about french


 "Are you gonna have to work on your French then?"
 "Nah, I mean a bit, but not that much. Concordia is an English
 university, so I'll be fine"
 "Yeah, but you'll be surrounded by French people in the city, right? I
 mean, it's basically expatriation"
 "I guess yeah. Guess I should have worked a bit harder in French class
 :p"
 "Haha, instead of sitting at the back of the class and chatting with
 your neighbour? :p"
 "Yeah -- that damn neighbour"
 "Lol u mad? :D"
 ":D"

>ask jane about us


 Ah, this is a tough question. You struggle to find the words for a few
 minutes.
 "Do you really... I mean... We're gonna stay... yknow..."
 You think you see in her eyes that she's as scared as you. But she
 says, with a confident voice: "We're gonna keep in touch? Yeah! Of
 course! Why wouldn't we?"
 "I don't know, it's just... far away, right?"
 "Yeah, sure, I guess, but like, it's only three hours of time
 difference! Like, nothing!"
 "I guess, yeah, it's pretty convenient if we want to, like, call each
 other..."
 "Yeah! It's gonna be fine, I'm sure. We always talk for hours, and
 we'll have even more to talk about :)"
 "Haha yeah, that sounds good :)"

>ask jane about vancouver


 "Isn't it gonna be weird, to like not be living in Vancouver anymore?"
 "Yeah, it's true. I'll miss all the cool shit happening here"
 "Yeah. And it's not like you can come back visit all the time..."
 "I know... It's a bummer :/"
 "Yeah. Anyway..."

>ask jane about art


 "So, are you still talking about doing an album?"
 "Yeah! I mean... I want to, but it's hard"
 "To write?"
 "No, more like... I don't know, I have a lot of songs, but it's like I
 have a hard time finishing them, and like, actually being proud of
 them... you ever get that feeling?"
 "Nah, I mean... I have ideas, but I don't start them. Like, I know if
 I start it I have to finish writing it till the end, or it drives me
 crazy, so I don't"
 "Oh yeah?"
 "Yeah! Not you?"
 "No, it's like the opposite! Like, sometimes I get ideas and like, I
 HAVE to grab my guitar and spend like half an hour working out chords
 and stuff"
 "But what if you don't have time to finish it?"
 "I don't know, I don't care? I'm like 'meh', and I forget about it. I
 mean, that's how I know a song is good, if I want to come back to it"
 "Huh. Interesting"
 "Huh indeed"

>eat chips


 "Can I have some?"
 "Sure" she says, tilting the bag towards you. You grab some chips and
 eat them almost instantly -- can't resist, and you feel really hungry
 right now.

>play guitar


 You reach out for the guitar. "Do you mind?"
 "Nah, it's cool, just chillin here"
 You strum a few chords, aimlessly. You don't really know a song, and
 you can't sing.


>ask jane about guitar


 "Hey, will you help me one day on the guitar?"
 "Oh yeah, we've been talking about it for ages. Shit, sorry :/"
 "No, that's cool! It's just... let's not forget, right? I mean, let's
 do it this summer"
 "Yeah, this summer for sure. Before I leave, definitely"
 "Cool :) and I'll practice while you're gone and then we'll start a
 band :p"
 "Haha, yeah sounds good ;)"

>ask jane about band

 "So... how do... How do you feel?"
 "Fine?"
 "I mean... about leaving and stuff"
 "Oh." She sits there quietly for a while.
 "I dunno, I felt like asking, because..."
 "No, yeah, it's okay. I mean, thanks." She sighs heavily. "I dunno. I
 mean, I'm excited, sure. But at the same time... like why can't I
 stay? Like, I'm going to have to leave everything behind, right?
 Family, you, friends, the city I grew up in, and all that... Is it
 worth it? I mean, it is... It's just..."
 "Right"
 "It's just a huge change, and it's hard. And the closer it gets, the
 worse it's gonna be"
 "Right, yeah" You sit there, quietly, for a moment.
 "It sucks, and it doesn't suck, at the same time"
 "Yeah." Another pause. "Well, if you need to talk, you know..."
 "Yeah. Sure, yeah. Hey, thanks"
 "Sure. And in the meantime, let's enjoy this summer?"
 "Yup, definitely. It's gonna be a good one"
 "Hehe. Yeah, I think so too :)"

>ask jane about summer


 "Any plans for the summer?"
 "Not really, no. Maybe go somewhere with my parents for a week, but
 not even sure right now. You?"
 You shrug. "No, nothing. My Dad's gonna work, I think"
 "Ah. Sucks"
 "Whatever", you shrug, trying to act casual. "I'm gonna try to get a
 part-time job somewhere, but I don't really know where. I don't know.
 I really don't feel like it"
 "Yeah, that sucks. Well, in any case, we'll make time to hang out?"
 "For sure :D I want that more than getting a job :p might be why I'm
 so not motivated to look for one"
 "Haha yeah I bet ^^"

>ask jane about job


 There is no reply.

>ask jane about family


 "How are your parents?"
 She shrugs. "Fine, I think. I dunno. I think it's hard for them, but
 they haven't talked too much about it"
 "That's good I guess"
 "Yeah... I dunno. I don't know why, but I think it's gonna be worse
 when my sister's gone"
 "Ah, yeah. Yeah, maybe"
 She fiddles with her hair, and doesn't say more.

>ask jane about future


 Ah, this is a tough question. You struggle to find the words for a few
 minutes.
 "Do you really... I mean... We're gonna stay... yknow..."
 You think you see in her eyes that she's as scared as you. But she
 says, with a confident voice: "We're gonna keep in touch? Yeah! Of
 course! Why wouldn't we?"
 "I don't know, it's just... far away, right?"
 "Yeah, sure, I guess, but like, it's only three hours of time

 "I guess, yeah, it's pretty convenient if we want to, like, call each

 "Yeah! It's gonna be fine, I'm sure. We always talk for hours, and
 we'll have even more to talk about :)"
 "Haha yeah, that sounds good :)"

>ask jane about friends


 There is no reply.

>ask jane about pot


 "Do you think we should smoke some more?"
 "Nah" she makes a face. "I mean, I'm pretty high right now lol"
 "Haha yeah me too"
 "You can if you wanna tho"
 "Yeah. Nah. I'm good"


>ask jane about woods


 There is no reply.

>wait


 Time passes.

>ask jane about song


 "Hey, so... You wrote a song lately?"
 "Yeah", she says with a smile. "It's... yknow. About graduating to
 being a cog"
 "Haha. Like, totally not inspired by true events"
 "Noooo, definitely not a song I wrote about myself or my fears or
 whatever
 "Hehe yeah ^^"
 "I'm having trouble though. Like, I want to find something powerful,
 like, something that really means what I want to say, and that's
 like... you know... powerful" She pauses for a second. "Wanna help me?
 Like, say something to finish the line when I look at you?"
 "Yeah, sure. Show me :D"
 "K :D It's only the last two lines... Anyway"

 She grabs the guitar and strums a few chords.
 "Ok, here we go", and she starts singing, in her raw, quavering,
 beautiful voice:
    Countdown till you're eighteen, then it's over
    Here is your toga, now it's time to go
    Here is your adult life, a dull life
    Taxes spouse don't forget to call back home
    Welcome to the machine, you must now...
 choose: comfort or calling
    Don't look back, you'll soon forget...
 where you came from

 She gazes out into the night as the last chord reverberates in the
 dark, a light smile on her face. "That's good dude. Real good.
 Thanks."
 You both stay quiet. It feels right. And this moment, this very night,
 is the memory that never fades.

 You are Molly Butterfield, dairy farmer extraordinaire. You have the
 finest cows and the sweetest butter for miles around, and word of it
 has spread far and wide.

 Perhaps too far.

 In the past week there have been two mysterious butter disappearances
 from your own kitchen. There will not be a third.

 This time, you'll be lying in wait for the thief. And you'll be armed
 with a fire poker.

>examine dish

 A china dish shows off an exquisite specimen of butter, round from the
 butter mold and stamped with your signature imprint of a flower.

 With all the labor that goes into making butter, you feel a twinge of
 regret that you're sacrificing it to lure a thief, and on a beautiful
 dish passed down from your grandparents, to boot. But you're
 determined to find out who has been stealing your butter, and why.

 You hear a cow lowing outside--unusual for this time of night.
 Something must have startled Millicent.

>examine poker

 An iron fire poker, useful for scaring off intruders if necessary.

 The door creaks open, revealing a sliver of night.

>examine door

 The front door is open.

 Glimmering points of light float in through the doorway like different
 colored fireflies.

>examine points

 Points of light drift and flicker like tiny luminescent butterflies.

 The flickering points of light drift towards your fancy plate of
 butter. Now the butter dish is rising into midair. The butter dish
 balances, then hovers towards the front door, accompanied by the
 lights.

>close door

 Not now!

 The butter on its dish floats through the doorway, surrounded by the
 glimmering sparks, and then the door closes behind it.

 You let out the breath you've been holding and lay down the fire
 poker. You won't be needing a heavy thing like that to deal with a
 couple of sparks. You're better off using your wits, and if need be,
 your fists. Now, where's that thief off to?

>out


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Yard</span>
 It's shadowy in the yard. You can just make out the red water pump in
 the moonlight. The farmhouse stands to the west, and the forest to the
 east. There ought to be a path into the forest, but you can make out
 only a tangle of trees.

 White pebbles glint in the grass.

 Points of light drift and flicker, carrying with them the dish of
 butter.

 The glimmering lights are making their way slowly east across the
 field.

>take pebbles

 You scoop up a generous handful of pebbles.

 The glimmering lights are making their way slowly east across the
 field.

>pump pump

 You sidle over to the bright red water pump and begin pumping water.
 The thief startles at the noise and vanishes along with the coveted
 butter.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forest Stream</span>
 You feel as though you have entered not one forest, but two. The trees
 you've always known are still here, but tonight new trees have joined
 them, and an unfamiliar mass of wild brambles has overtaken most of
 the ground. The new vegetation intersects the old and grows right
 through it, unaffected by its presence. A stream flows through the
 center of it all.

 You know every path through the forest--this is your home, after all.
 But tonight you're not sure you'll be able to find your way back.

 Unless, perhaps, you have something to mark the way.

>drop pebble

 Good idea! You'll leave a trail of pebbles as you go through the
 strange forest so you'll be able to find your way back. <span class="floydstyle em">(You are</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">now leaving a trail of pebbles automatically.)</span>
 You drop some pebbles on the ground.

>examine trees

 Strange, otherworldy plants and trees surround you.

 The colored points of light float slowly south with the fancy dish of
 butter, staying well away from the stream.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hollow Log</span>
 A clearing in the heart of the double-natured forest. Unfamiliar vines
 hang down through familiar trees, and strange toadstools grow near a
 hollow log that wasn't here before this evening.

 You drop some pebbles on the ground.

>examine toadstools

 Strange, otherworldy plants and trees surround you.

 The colored points of light float slowly southeast with the fancy dish
 of butter.

>take vine

 The surrounding forest seems so strange, almost threatening. You don't
 trust it far enough to do anything with it.

 The thief is going southeast, and is almost out of sight.

>se


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forest Slope</span>
 The trees are sparse here at the edge of the forest, and the ground
 slopes down to the east. Well, some of it does. A spongy layer of
 ground with tall grass and another layer that's rocky are oddly
 interwoven with each other.

 As you make your way through the grass, you stop for a moment. You've
 seen this place before.

 Haven't you?

 You drop the last of your pebbles on the ground.

 The colored points of light float slowly east with the fancy dish of
 butter.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bog</span>
 You stand in a moonlit bog at the bottom of a valley. Mist drifts
 across the spongy turf, and amidst the fog, floating in midair, is the
 ghostly outline of a castle, draped with ivy and flowers. An almost
 transparent bridge leads east across the mud to its front door. The
 tangled forest lies to the west, and to the northwest is the opening
 to a small cave.

>examine castle

 The ghostly form of a castle stands to the east, across the bridge.
 The castle walls look as if they are not quite solid. Or not
 quite...there.

 The thief is floating toward the bridge.

>go east

 You march up to the bridge and, as you step forward, find it to be
 just as unsubstantial as it looks. You fall through it as though it
 were air, and land splat in the mud.

 The thief floats east across the bridge with the butter.

 A new cluster of lights comes into view, lavender and rose and green.
 The lights drift back and forth on this side of the bridge.

>get out of mud

 I only understood you as far as wanting to get outside.

>stand

 You get out of the mud.

>examine cluster

 Floating here is a twisting constellation of glimmering lights,
 lavender and rose and green. Here and there the points of light
 lengthen into lines, suggesting edges of petals and fluttering fabric.

>touch cluster

 The cluster of glimmering lights might not like that.

>talk to cluster

 "Hail, bold mortal. Welcome to our <span class="floydstyle u1">banquet</span>," says a voice.

 You choose a focal point amongst the floating lights and say "Good
 evening," annoyed that you don't know whom you're addressing.

 "You may call me 'Your Majesty,'" says the voice, answering your
 unspoken question. "It is only edges and glimpses of us you see now.
 But tonight our worlds <span class="floydstyle u1">converge</span> for a while, and as the night
 draws on, you may see us in our true <span class="floydstyle u1">form</span>."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(Please type a keyword to proceed.)</span>

>form

 "Yes, mortal, we are of the fair folk," says the voice. "You cannot
 see this, for we are not yet fully in your world, nor you in ours. But
 we are happy to share what we have as the worlds come together, even a
 crossing into our realm, should you desire it."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You could type </span><span class="floydstyle u1">banquet</span><span class="floydstyle em"> or</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em"></span><span class="floydstyle u1">converge</span><span class="floydstyle em">.)</span>

>converge

 The voice answers. "Every so often the world of faerie and the world
 of humans pass through each other, and while the worlds converge, we
 may mingle."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You could type </span><span class="floydstyle u1">banquet</span><span class="floydstyle em">.)</span>

>banquet

 "Our banquet is held in the castle there, across the bridge," says the
 voice. "Do not neglect to bring a fairy flower with you."

 "I have tarried here long enough. I must go. See to the flower,
 mortal," says the voice, and the lights vanish.

>examine cave

 An opening to the northeast leads into a cave.

>go northeast

 You can't go that way.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bog</span>
 You stand in a moonlit bog at the bottom of a valley. Mist drifts
 across the spongy turf, and amidst the fog, floating in midair, is the
 ghostly outline of a castle, draped with ivy and flowers. An almost
 transparent bridge leads east across the mud to its front door. The
 tangled forest lies to the west, and to the northwest is the opening
 to a small cave.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave</span>
 A small cave in the rock, large enough to walk a little, but no more.
 Overgrown tree roots and flowering vines camouflage the cave opening
 to the southeast.

 A ledge in the wall of the cave forms a natural seat. It gives you a
 curious feeling to look at it.

>sit on seat

 You sit on the stone seat and when you look at the cave from your new
 perspective, you are cast adrift in a sea of memory: <span class="floydstyle em">the look of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the vines hanging in the doorway, dark against the moon. Flower</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">shadows on the wall. Sitting on the smooth stone seat with your legs</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">dangling, not long enough to touch the ground.</span> Fragments of
 forgotten dreams.

 If they were dreams.

>examine vines

 Overgrown tree roots and flowering vines camouflage the cave opening
 to the southeast. The blossoms on the vines look oddly faint.

>take flower

 The flowers look more like tricks of the light than real blossoms. As
 you reach for one you wonder if you'll be able to touch it at all. But
 you can, and once you've picked the flower, it seems more solid,
 somehow.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a fairy flower

>smell flower

 It smells both sweet and bitter.

>examine flower

 A blossom you picked from the flowering vine. On the vine it looked
 faint, as though it were not quite present, but now that you've picked
 it, it looks more solid, somehow.

>stand

 You get off the natural seat.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave</span>
 A small cave in the rock, large enough to walk a little, but no more.
 Overgrown tree roots and flowering vines camouflage the cave opening
 to the southeast.

 A ledge in the wall of the cave forms a natural seat.

>out

 You go to leave.  <span class="floydstyle em">A rainstorm was raging that night. That must</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">have been why you were lost, though you thought you knew the path. But</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you found a cave and crept in, and sat on the ledge, and began to sing</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to yourself in the dark.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Curious children, about your own age, peeped into the cave, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">came in. By the end of the song you had a small audience sitting on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the floor.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"I've never heard that lullaby before," one of them said.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"My mother always sings it to me during a storm," you said.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"The fairies don't sing about rain. They don't seem to like it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">much."</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"What fairies?"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"The ones who live over yonder. But don't worry--you're safe for</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">now. Sing us another."</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bog</span>
 You stand in a moonlit bog at the bottom of a valley. Mist drifts
 across the spongy turf, and amidst the fog, floating in midair, is the
 ghostly outline of a castle, draped with ivy and flowers. An almost
 transparent bridge leads east across the mud to its front door. The
 tangled forest lies to the west, and to the northwest is the opening
 to a small cave.

>touch bridge

 You touch the bridge, and it feels solid. You can't help but feel that
 the flower has something to do with it.

>go east

 As you step onto the bridge, unsure if it will support you, you grip
 your flower.

 The bridge holds, and you cross.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Banquet Hall</span>
 A table stretches from one end of the hall to the other, spread with a
 fine banquet, and seated along the table are scores of fairies. Other
 fairies are walking through with pitchers and silver trays,
 periodically disappearing through a set of doors to the north. There
 is a great deal of laughter and singing going on.

 Your dish of butter is nowhere to be seen.

 "Psst! Molly!" whispers a voice.

 You turn, and over in the corner, waving at you, is none other than
 Tom the Baker.

 Tom, the man who jilted your friend Lucinda seven years ago. A
 midsummer wedding had been planned, but on the appointed day, he never
 showed up. No one ever saw him around after that.

 And to think all this years he's been here enjoying himself! You
 hardly know whether to <span class="floydstyle u1">ignore</span> him, or give him a piece of
 your <span class="floydstyle u1">mind</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(Please enter a keyword to proceed.)</span>

>mind

 You march forward, ready to light into him, but he is the first to
 speak.

 "I cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am that I was not there to
 marry Lucinda. But I must tell you this: do not drink the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">wine</span> the fairies offer you. Once you drink it, you cannot
 leave the fairy realm."

 He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a folded-up piece of
 <span class="floydstyle u1">paper</span>.

>examine tom

 This is the man who failed to show up for his own wedding to your
 friend Lucinda, seven years ago, and was never seen since.

>paper

 He hands you a folded letter with "LUCINDA" written on the outside.

 "I would be so grateful if you would give this letter to Lucinda," he
 says.

 (You could type <span class="floydstyle u1">wine</span>.)

>ask tom about lucinda

 Tom the Baker does not respond.

>wine

 You ask him about the wine.

 "You see over there some others you may know," says Tom, "the midwife,
 the miller's son. They, too, drank the fairy wine. It is not meant for
 humans; it binds us to the realm of faerie. None of us can ever go
 home again."

 You look over at the familiar faces, laughing and carrying on. They
 take no notice of you.

 "Don't they see me?" you ask.

 "If you drink enough, you <span class="floydstyle u1">forget</span> those you knew. You forget
 the human world. Our friends over there can't remember any life other
 than this."

>forget

 "If you are imprisoned here forever," you say, "then don't you wish to
 forget what you have lost, as the others have done?"

 "Many times I have wanted to forget entirely," says Tom. "But I hoped
 for the day when someone would visit from the human world, as you
 have. Someone who could deliver this letter to Lucinda."

 "And besides," he continues, "if I were to forget, how could I warn
 others who might come in, unsuspecting, like you? The fairies may have
 trapped my body in this world," says Tom. "But they cannot trap my
 will."

 "Please, give Lucinda the letter," he says. "And remember what I said
 about the wine."

 Seeing a fairy approach, Tom slips away.

>examine server fairy

 A fairy offering drinks to the guests.

 A fairy greets you and offers you a goblet of some purplish,
 sweet-smelling liquid. You debate whether to say <span class="floydstyle u1">thank you</span> or
 to <span class="floydstyle u1">decline</span>. <span class="floydstyle em">(Please enter a keyword to proceed.)</span>

>thank you

 You thank the fairy for the drink, and with a nod, the server moves
 on.

>examine goblet

 A silver goblet full of a purplish liquid.

>examine liquid

 A silver goblet full of a purplish liquid.

>smell it

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>examine table

 You've seen enough to know that your dish of butter is not in the
 Banquet Hall. There's no use wasting more time on the banquet.

>go north

 (first opening set of doors)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scullery</span>
 Precariously-stacked dishes fill much of the scullery. Along the north
 edge of the room, behind a half-wall, is a long channel with a stream
 of water running through it. A grating across the floor is meant to
 drain any stray water. A set of doors to the south leads back into the
 banquet hall, and a little wooden door leads west.

 Among the stacks of dishes is your beautiful china butter dish passed
 down from your grandparents. You were beginning to think you'd never
 see it again!

>examine dish

 It's your fancy butter dish that you laid out to lure the thief! With
 not a trace of butter left on it.

>take it

 Taken.

>examine channel

 Water splashes into the channel through an opening in one end of the
 room and flows out again at the other end. A thick half-wall divides
 the channel from the rest of the scullery. It's clear that the stream
 of water is meant for washing dishes, but the height and thickness of
 the wall must make it difficult.

 You puzzle over the thick half-wall and the long grating. The fairies
 seem to have gone to a lot of trouble to keep the floor dry.

>pour goblet

 You glance around to make sure no one is watching, then pour the
 contents of the goblet over your shoulder. You hear a hiss as the
 liquid burns a hole in the floor.

>fill goblet with water

 You'd like to take your dish home, not fiddle with the channel of
 water.

>go west

 You doubt the fairies would appreciate you taking their silver goblet
 home with you.

>put goblet in channel

 You'd like to take your dish home, not fiddle with the channel of
 water.

>drop goblet

 Dropped.

>go west

 (first opening the little wooden door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bog</span>
 You stand in a moonlit bog at the bottom of a valley. Mist drifts
 across the spongy turf, and amidst the fog, floating in midair, is the
 ghostly outline of a castle, draped with ivy and flowers. An almost
 transparent bridge leads east across the mud to its front door. The
 tangled forest lies to the west, and to the northwest is the opening
 to a small cave.

 Oh, no. There's a fairy here, and she's already seen you! You stroll
 by, doing your best not to call attention to the dish you're carrying.

 "What is this?" says the fairy. "Is this how you repay our
 hospitality, mortal? How dare you steal our fine dish! Give it to me!"

 You recognize that voice.

 "Pardon, Your Majesty," you say, "but I won't have you calling it
 yours when one of your thieving fairies stole it first!"

 Alas, diplomacy was never your strong suit. The Queen goes inside to
 fetch the other fairies, and soon they are pouring out of the castle,
 chasing after you.

 I hope you know your way home, Molly. There's no time to dilly-dally!

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forest Slope</span>
 The trees are sparse here at the edge of the forest, and the ground
 slopes down to the east. Well, some of it does. A spongy layer of
 ground with tall grass and another layer that's rocky are oddly
 interwoven with each other.

 A trail of pebbles leads northwest and east.

 A memory...

 <span class="floydstyle em">After the rain died down on the night of the storm, the singing</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">came to an end and your little friends whispered, nudging you towards</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the forest. "You'd better go. If the Fairy Queen catches sight of you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">she might decide she'd like another servant."</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"What if the fairies should come after me?" you asked.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"If you're quiet, they'll never know you were here. But if they</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">follow you, look for the dewleaf, which grows by running water. The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">fairies cannot follow you through water. Dip the leaf in water, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">when you stand outside your home, throw the leaf down on the ground.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Then you'll be safe."</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"What does the leaf--"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Shh--they'll come looking for us any minute. You must go!</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Goodbye!"</span>

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hollow Log</span>
 A clearing in the heart of the double-natured forest. Unfamiliar vines
 hang down through familiar trees, and strange toadstools grow near a
 hollow log that wasn't here before this evening.

 A trail of pebbles leads north and southeast.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forest Stream</span>
 It looks as though there is not one forest here, but two. The trees
 you've always known are still here, but tonight new trees have joined
 them, and an unfamiliar mass of wild brambles has overtaken most of
 the ground. The new vegetation intersects the old and grows right
 through it, unaffected by its presence. A stream flows through the
 center of it all.

 A strange bush by the stream catches your eye.

 A trail of pebbles leads west and south.

>examine bush

 The low bush has leaves like slices of water: clear, with ripples of
 light running from tip to tip as though across the surface of a
 stream.

>take leaf

 You gently pull a dewleaf from the bush.

>put it in stream

 You dip the dewleaf into the stream. Soon the leaf begins to glow, and
 you draw it out again.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Yard</span>
 It's shadowy in the yard. You can just make out the red water pump in
 the moonlight. The farmhouse stands to the west, and the forest to the
 east.

>throw leaf

 You throw down the glowing wet dewleaf, and as it hits the ground, the
 earth begins to shake.

 A crack appears in the ground, and you leap out of the way as it
 lengthens and widens.....
 lengthens and widens.....
 And the crack in the ground deepens into a trench, rapidly snaking
 around the farmhouse....
 around the farmhouse....
 And then you hear a loud rush of water, and the trench becomes a
 river, completely encircling your home....

 And then you catch sight of two more dishes being swept down the
 stream: the ones that disappeared when your butter was stolen before.
 You grab them as they approach....
 You grab them as they approach....
 Then the fairies arrive from the east, a whole crowd of them, hopping
 mad. They gather on the opposite side of the river and command you to
 give them the dishes.

 You decline.

 "Now if you'll excuse me," you say, "it's almost morning, and the
 milking won't wait. And then I've got an important letter to deliver."

 And the fairies never trouble you again.
