 Nostrils of Flesh and Clay
 An Olfactory Fiction by Porpentine

 erogater's office
 Fake dawnlight streams through drawn blinds. The erogater is at her
 desk, thumbing through papers. Behind her, some kind of critter
 languidly swims through a murky aquarium. The only exits are a
 stainless steel door on the east wall and the hallway door south.

>examine me
 In profile: a strong nose splitting a curtain of tangled dark brown
 hair. Chapped lips. Green jacket.

>smell me
 Smelling yourself creates a horrific hyper-olfactory feedback loop.
 Time and space collide within your nostrils--you smell the past, the
 present, the future, you smell it all, and you pay the ultimate price.

 The erogater steeples her fingers and continues. "I really should give
 you permanent leave of absence for that little debacle down at Palace
 Street."

>smell critter
 Your extra-olfactory perception requires proximity.

>smell erogater
 She smells like cold clay, chilled wire. But something deeper. Deeper.

>examine her
 You feel dizzy as your scent-brain tips over into oblivion. You blink,
 shutting off the stream of olfactons. Note to self: never smell an
 erogater.

 She purses her lips. "But you're the best we've got. And that makes me
 the worst at firing your ass."

 "Get out of here before I change my mind." She goes back to perusing
 her papers.

 You leave, flakes of her gaze stuck to your skin like flecks of ice.

 green hallway
 Flourescent lights saturate the hallway emerald. The sole decoration
 is a huge morale poster covering the wall. The ministry branches off
 west into a maze of corridors, the erogater's office is at the north
 end of the hall, and if you keep going south you'll hit the exit.

 More of a token at this point, a totem. Once there must have been some

 You smell your own insecurity. You wouldn't be shit without this card.
 Just that pathetic fuck from five years ago who was smelling for

 The scent of blood is strained, diffused, but it's still there. Even
 through the medium of electronic banking, the blood is always there.

 jauntry room
 Utilitarian metal room, shelves full of incoming and outgoing gear. A

 You can see a counter (on which are an aboro qihilus and a loan
 lantern) here.

>examine aboro
 One of the Acontextual Artifacts of the Chalice Meringue Dumpyard.
 Someone hasn't checked this one in yet.

>smell it
 Sheen of fertility, but for some reason you can't delve deeper. The
 olfactons feel snared, skewed. It's like smelling an egg, or a door.

>smell lantern
 Your nostrils toke up snared illuminance, squandered radiance,
 subjugated shadows. You smell philosophy, theosophy, and utility.

 Thoroughly de-olfactonized, as per regulations.

 Bars of purple flourescence buzz in the ceiling. The exit gate is at

 Eastern Exit Gate
 A dark metal room lit only by a plexiglass window. A sliding iron gate
 fills the east wall. This is the last layer before leaving the

 purple alleyway
 The western mouth of this alley is filled with an iron gate. A
 security camera stares down from above the gate. Sob Street lies east.

>smell camera
 The olfactons have been stripped from this camera. The uncomfortable
 feeling of smelling nothing, like suddenly entering a dark space or
 being abruptly deafened.

 A black eye set in the wall like some kind of obsidian pustule.

>sob

>go east

 Sob Street
 Sob Street runs along the waterfront, a bank of grey fog to the east.
 Purple light glowers from a narrow alleyway set in the wall of hulking
 warehouses. One of those old info-gloops is mounted near the alley
 entrance.

>xmell info-gloop
 [Try typing LOOK for a description of your surroundings. Any compass
 directions indicate exits which you can use by typing (for example)
 EAST or E. Some of the objects mentioned in the description might be
 worth a closer look with a command like EXAMINE FILM CAPSULE. You can
 also TAKE or DROP some things, type INVENTORY to see a list of what
 you're carrying already, OPEN or CLOSE containers or doors, and so
 on.]

>smell info-gloop
 Hallucinatory bubblegum. Through this gloop you sense the combined
 gloop of all gloops. They gloop as one.

>examine info-gloop
 Imagine an ATM with pink goo burbling out of it. The goo constantly
 seems as if it were about to disgorge itself from the wall and
 splatter to the sidewalk, but somehow it always manages to suck itself
 back inside.

 You hate using these things, but you're shit with directions.

>eat gloop
 [You can't consume the info-gloop, or that's not the way to do so.]

>use gloop
 You stick your hand in and say, "Location query: Club Coccyx"

 The goo speaks:

 "Club Coccyx is south of your current position BLARRRRRRGHHHHHHH"

 "Head south down Sob Street, Club Coccyx lies on the east side of the
 street BLARGGGGHHHHHHHHH"

 The gloop clings to your skin as you disentangle yourself. You feel
 faintly nauseous.

>smell hand

>smell me
 Smelling yourself creates a horrific hyper-olfactory feedback loop.
 Time and space collide within your nostrils--you smell the past, the

 entrance. To the south, Sob Street deepens.

>go south

 Lower Sob Street
 Streetlamps cast cool light on the street. Below your feet, a storm
 drain sings a ghostly song. To the south, a gap in the buildings gives
 a view of the Meringue Dumpyard. To the east, you see Club Coccyx,
 spelled out in dead neon. Everything else is boarded up, closed,
 caged, black glass.

 You can see some chalice city songers here.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>smell drain
 You travel through the cold guts of the city, through the the dark
 places. You feel a dead rat tumble through your viscera, followed by
 mangled trash, then streams of puke. Then you exhale that trip out
 your mouth and you're back in your own skin.

>examine songers
 Leprous street saints that sing for a living, and pray for a dying.
 The rot of their skin is like lichen on wax.

>go south
 The chalice city songers start to croon. Their boombox percusses
 backing beats that snarl, warp, thrash, crash, thud against the air,
 rattle the windows.

 Their sounds are vibrant, melodic, but the notes wash over you like an
 arctic breeze, because you've always been insensate to the musical

 Chalice Meringue Dumpyard view
 This used to be an alley, now it's a cusp of concrete looking out on a
 dizzying drop. The Meringue Dumpyard sprawls for miles into the
 exposed heart of the earth. Back in dynasty days, this was downtown.
 Now it's a low, dead, dark place, a post-apocalyptic quarry.

 Club Coccyx
 Stale alcohol bites the air and sticks to your shoes. Just a dim joint
 with no customers, chairs all lined up against the wall. A very tall
 man is standing by a deep red door against the east wall, just past
 the bar.

>examine man
 You'd call him an ugly customer, but he looks like staff of some sort.
 What's to say? He ain't winnin' no beauty pageants. BUT DON'T SAY THAT
 TO HIS FACE

>smell man
 He's wearing that weird cologne people sell these days that supposedly
 masks you from the smell detectives. Doesn't seem to work though,
 because you smell a whole lotta crime on this guy, so much of it that
 it blends together like a bad soup, all the flavors muddled and
 indistinct.

>ask man about himself
 He grunts.

>ask man about crimes

>examine door
 Whadda they call this kind of red? Burgundy? Oxblood? Ah, forget it.

>smell door
 This door came from overseas, where they still have forests, and not
 just little viewing stations for lone trees buried inside iron bells.
 You smell memories of blood on the door but that could just be a fresh
 coat of paint. If the paint in question is blood, that is.

>ask man about door

 "Comedy. That's a real gift." He sounds entirely sarcastic, but
 begrudgingly opens the door for you.

 inner chamber
 A candle-laden table glows in the midst of darkness. Cards soaked in
 gin, a dagger stabbed into the wood, mounds of money. Two figures (one
 fat, the other lean) are at the table, counting coins.

 You take a seat. Eternal Hog smiles at you. "Hey there, ladybuck."

 You flick the capsule at Hog. "Everything on Olympia that can be got
 for blood or money. In this case, I'll take the money."

 Eternal Hog slides a billfold across the table. You slip the cash
 inside your wallet.

 He sits back. "We need one final favor before we leave. Papyrus from
 the sea tombs. The ministry dug them up last night." You blink. "Yeah,
 the erogater was looking through them today." He leans forward,
 licking his lips. "The scrolls are in your department? You can get
 them by tonight?"

 You spread your hands. "Tonight? That's a tall order." He furrows his
 brow. "We just need the chart. We don't care about the rest of the
 scrolls. Please."

 Antagonistic James raps the table. The crash of his fist knocks the
 sound from the air. He breathes deeply, the bristles on his moustache
 flaring outwards. "Enough squabbing. I feel the noose tightening
 around my neck. If we don't have the chart by midnight, we cast off."

 Eternal Hog smiles beatifically. "My unmannered friend is correct,
 sadly. The more scrupulous members of your department are closing in
 on us. Our joint down on Neat Street is getting a lot of heat. Could
 be arthritis, but I doubt it. Only a matter of time before they
 connect the don't's and burst into this very room."

 He sighs. "If you fetch us the chart before midnight, we will make you
 very rich. I anticipate your return, dear lady, knowing you to be wise
 and resourceful." They resume counting their money.

 Smelling Hog is like drinking down some cloying chocolate liqueur with

 fraud, and bootlegging.

 Antagonistic James smells like bloody metal, brine, and apples.

 freeze baths
 A vat of ice water glows luridly in the shadows, lit from below. The
 erogater lies on her back in the water, the clay moon of her face just
 above the surface of the water, eyes switched off. Frost swirls from
 her parted lips every so often, flashing white against the darkness.

 You can see a slab (on which are a suit and an erogater's card) here.

 The faintest rasp of the erogater's breath, like the exhalation of
 some distant machine.

>take card

>examine suit
 The erogater's black suit, shed. Gold buttons peek out from under
 crumpled fabric.

 The faintest rasp of the erogater's breath, like the exhalation of
 some distant machine.

>smell suit
 Evocative of a shell surrounding the meat of a beetle, except the
 other way around.

 The faintest rasp of the erogater's breath, like the exhalation of
 some distant machine.

>take suit
 You slowly slide the suit towards you, easing it from the slab. One of
 the golden buttons scrapes the edge.

 The erogater hums. An eery sound that gets inside your bones. You
 start to back away.

 She turns her hollow eyes on you, rising in the water, icy beads
 rolling down her vaporous form. "Why don't you come take a bath with
 me?"

 Somehow you can't say no. And the water is very, very cold.

 You tip-toe out, closing the door very, very softly.

 erogater's office
 An office cut from obsidian and silver. Fake dawnlight streams through
 drawn blinds. Some kind of critter languidly swims through a murky
 aquarium.  The exits are a stainless steel door on the east wall and
 the hallway door south.

 A massive black safe sits in the corner of the room.

 You swipe the card. Something clicks and the safe door swings open,

 the bowels of the safe
 You hold tight to metal rungs. Light above, darkness below.

>go down

 shadow-enswathed bridge
 You feel your way through some kind of cavern. A bridge of stinking
 iron spans a chasm before you. Across the bridge, a gap in the
 darkness bleeds ghostly light.

>smell bridge
 You smell the erogater's footsteps, cold and light, like snowflakes
 melting amid a hellish slough of rust.

  Interestingly enough, some of the smell of metal comes from the
 corrosion of metal on contact with human perspiration, the oxidization
 of skin oils producing lipid peroxides, a precursor to the relevant
 odor molecules.

>examine bridge
 Horribly corroded.

 A softly glowing portal.

>examine critter
 The water is too murky.

>take critter
 You dip your hands into the murky water and fish around.

>smell critter
 What's this? What's happening...your mind blurs with images of your
 hand suddenly being eviscerated by a tankful of pirhana, pulling back
 a stump of bloody bones, or some horrible parasite burrowing inside
 your fingers, dead set on spiraling straight into your brain...

 You pull up a wriggling, writhing baby octopus!

>pet octopus
 [That's not a verb I recognise.]

>hug octopus
 [You can only do that to something animate.]

>smell octopus
 Your vision fills with the watery realm from which this octopus was
 snatched. The drowned ruins of ancient cities from the
 before-times--coral-encrusted freeways, skyscrapers thronged with
 schools of fish, passenger airplane stuck in the craw of a dark
 trench.

 A dang choopy octopus, purple and slimy. Cute as hell, looking at you
 with great trust and affection.

>open chest with octopus
 The octopus squirms in your hand as you shove it into the lock. Ink
 bubbles and foams across the lock as the octopus's tentacles are
 forced inside the holes. With a screech (of the octopus) and a screech
 (of the chest) the lid pops open.

 The octopus pops free and scuttles away from you.

>look
 fungal vault
 The cavern opens into an angular vault of chiseled rock, gently lit by

 You can see some sea tomb scrolls and an octopus here.

>smell scrolls
 The hand of a dead tyrant set ink to this parchment. Blood, riches,
 the conquest of nations above and below the earth, and graveworms.
 You've never smelled anything so terribly ancient.

>examine scrolls
 You can't read any of these queer runes, but you know a chart when you
 see one. The islands of the northern reach are clearly depicted, along
 with a red X and finely scrawled coordinates. The rest is page after
 page of dead languages, along with strange technical diagrams that you
 cannot comprehend the parts or use of.

>take scrolls
 Something lurches from the shadows, shaking the ground with each step.
 Cracks split open under your feet as an immense shadow plunges you
 into the darkness of its hulking form.

 "Halt!"

 You stand perfectly still. The ruby eyes of the security automaton
 focus on you. "Are you doing anything illegal?"
 1 - Yes.
 2 - No.

 "Oh. Well, that's all right then." The automaton powers down.

 Your phone beeps.

 [That's not something you can close.]

>examine blinds
 White plastic strips. Standard blind fare. Positively provincial
 compared to some of the mind-blowing blinds they've got up in--oh,
 who're you kidding.

>smell blinds
 Thoroughly de-olfactonized.

>go south
 You tip-toe across the room, scrolls gripped in your clammy hands.

 A cold presence crawls up your back. You turn around.

 The erogater stands naked and vaporous, ice water tracing down her
 body. Her eyes regard you, two impassive filaments, but her nostrils
 flare, drinking in

 every

 inch

 of

 your

 body

 sucking in all the sweat beaded up in your armpits, rolling down your
 collar bone, hot and moist around your cunt, itching across your skin,
 and deeper, deeper, smelling your whole body of beating blood like
 dragged up red roots suspended dripping in the air, sniffing the
 marrow in your bones like a starving, salivating wolf ready to crunch,
 and deeper still, smelling your thoughts, every single silly,
 embarassing, personal thought, every hope and dream and aspiration
 you've ever had, she smells your soul, your electromagnetic
 quintessence, all the stuff that makes you up, she sucks into her
 nostrils like hallucinogenic ribbons rippling across the room--

 --and then she's right next to you and her fingers are crawling across
 your skin and you head-butt her and there's blood and clay dust all
 over your face but she's reeling back and you spin from the room and--

 --run at breakneck speeds down the hall, through the jauntry room, and
 into the alley where an alarm rises into the air, keening and
 spectral.

 purple alleyway
 The western mouth of this alley is filled with an iron gate. A
 security camera stares down from above the gate. Sob Street lies east.

>SAVE
>cf10
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go east
 Down the street you see incoming squad cars, sirens splashing green
 light across the fog. A megaphone booms, nightmarish and distorted,
 like the roaring of some beast.  Are they saying your name? Are they
 saying anything? Or just screaming bestially, baying for blood...

 Sob Street
 Sob Street runs along the waterfront, a wall of fog smeared with
 emerald sirenlight. The only possible way to run from the horde of
 speeding squad cars that has any chance of survival however remote is
 south!

>go south

 Lower Sob Street
 Squad cars are howling from the mist, they'll be on you in a few
 seconds! To the east you see Club Coccyx, vibrating, shaking,
 shuddering in its foundations.

 You can see some chalice city songers here.

>go east
 You race across the street and into Club Coccyx. As your foot crosses
 the threshold, the floor wrenches itself from the ground with a
 titanic spasm, knocking you down.

 You leap up, grabbing the edge of the floor as the Club rises above
 the grimy walls, past the jungle of dead neon signs, into the cool
 night air.

 The building yaws to one side. You claw onto the threshold, carving
 swathes through a dark layer of crushed cigarette stubs and spilled
 whiskey. The floor rises above your head and everything that isn't
 nailed down inside the club starts to roll down towards you. Bottles
 and ashtrays skid past your head, plummeting into the clouds.

 clinging to the middle edge
 The city is rapidly shrinking below you. You have some room to the
 right and left, if you need to adjust your grip.

>SAVE

 A chair comes hurtling out of the darkness towards your face!

>go up
 You crawl, one hand in front of the other, a little further up from
 the edge.

 The chair whips past your face.

>smell

>go up
 You strain to lift yourself up. Sweat pours down your face.

>go up
 Just a little more...

 A table slowly slides from the darkness, picking up momentum.

>right
 You can't go that way.

 [From here, you can go up and left.]

>left

 clinging to the middle edge
 The city is rapidly shrinking below you. You have some room to the

>go up
 You grit your teeth.

 The table noses past you like an apologetic, blind hippopotamus
 feeling its way off a cliff. You barely cling to the edge as it
 tumbles past you, dribbling playing cards and shot glasses in its
 wake.

>go up
 You drag yourself on board the flying building. Behind you, clouds
 race past. Goddamn you didn't even notice how much you were sweating.
 Fuck.

 tilted club
 You balance on the sloping floor. Alcohol runs past your feet in
 rivulets, raining ethanol into the sky. The club is transforming
 itself, boilers and pipes exposing themselves behind the sultry chic
 and mood lighting. The northern wall is splayed by mechanical arms,
 revealing a metal wall with a blue cabin door set in it.

>smell alcohol
 Vision of sudden shaking, shattering glass, gushing release.

>examine arms
 The club is revealing an industrial, airborne side of itself you never
 knew.

>examine door
 A wooden door with a little porthole set in it.

>smell door
 You smell hurried hands and shouts.

>open door
 You try the door. It rattles in the frame. Locked.

>knock on door
 You hear sirens howling far below. Red lights sweep the sky, filling
 the interior of the club with crimson radiance.

>look
 tilted club
 Garish red light fills the club. Everything is bathed in blood.

>look through porthole
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine porthole
>examine porthole
 Through greasy glass you see a cockpit fraught with chaos--meters and
 dials spinning furiously, valves spraying steam, James struggling to
 hold onto a ship's wheel as Hog gesticulates wildly at the city
 horizon.

 The sky screams. You glance over to the open doorframe to see a point
 of light pierce the clouds, trailing smoke and flame.

 Everything is dark and red and white and your eyeballs feel knocked
 inside your skull and your guts feel sucked outside your body and then
 you're tumbling through the air, the wreckage of the club spiraling
 through the sky on plumes of fire.

 The city is a velvet painting glimpsed from breathless heights. You
 see the waterway cutting through the city like an icy vein, you see
 the crater of the Dumpyard like a frozen, gaping wound rimmed with
 frayed streets, skyscraper cartilage, bleeding culverts. And beyond,
 the ocean, with all its drowned sea kings and coral tombs.

 Everything you've ever smelled flashes across your nostrils. But it
 all smells bitter-sweet now.

 From this height the ocean will be concrete. You'd need a miracle to
 get out of this one. But they don't make miracles anymore. Not since
 dynasty days.

 There are no miracles. Just men. Women. And the blood beating beneath
 their palms.

 The aboro qihilus wakes up, starts squirming inside your jacket.
 Blinking its sleepy eyes, it says, "Where are we?"

 You hit the water.
