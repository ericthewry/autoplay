                     [Press SPACE if you dare...]








 This is the job that all men in white coats dream of...a potential
 epidemic. The details were sparse but menacing - mysterious,
 unexplained deaths in the isolated Dales village of Skebdale. The
 authorities had no choice but to send you, their most experienced
 environmental health agent, to check things out. Unfortunately it
 looks more like a job for Bond than for Herriot...

 Country Lane
 A winding country road threads its way between old stone cottages and
 barns. Daffodils and snowdrops spring from the grass verges, adding a
 dash of colour to the grey walls and roofs. To your north, the sign of
 'The Green Calf' swings in the sunshine, beckoning locals and tourists
 alike to pop in for a drink. There is a small garden to the south of
 the road which is attached, unsurprisingly, to a small house.

 A short gravel track leads up to a wooden gate to your north-east.

 Your car, a battered blue Volvo estate, is slewed across the grass
 verge, two wheels in the ditch.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a faxed note
   a remote control (which is closed)

>examine remote
 A beautifully styled black handset with an invitingly red button in
 the middle. A small panel on the back allows you to change the
 battery.

>read note
 Your instructions from head office, scribbled untidily and faxed to
 you without regard for legibility. Peering at the note you can only
 make out a few words:

 Reference: DCK 817S
 Operation: Red-Chevette

 Task: Agent 398-MUGWUG reports serious epidemic risk in Skebdale
 region of Yorkshire. Agent claims cross-over risk of BSE without beef
 consumption. Use operation codeword to gain contact, he will be lying
 low in disguise.

 If possible also investigate allegations of widespread devil worship
 in Skebdale area. Agent reports possible links.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

 You hammer the button to no avail - there must be something wrong with
 the control.

>open remote
 You open the remote control, revealing a burnt-out battery.

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

 A small, round, lithium watch-battery, charred almost out of

>examine car
 Dented from countless brushes with marauding cattle, your car looks
 three times its age. In fact it is fitted out with all mod cons,
 including an electric sunroof, in-car CD player, and remote locking
 system. (The latter comes in very useful when escaping from marauding
 cattle.)

 Farmyard
 This wide rectangle of concrete is littered with the chaotic fallout
 of everyday dairy farming. And its brown! The stark windows of the
 farmhouse stare accusingly down into the yard from the north, and, to
 the east, the roof of the main barn is outlined against the rising
 sun.

 The farm gate to the south-west stands open. You really should shut it
 or anything could happen.

 A crumpled leaflet, presumably discarded by a passing tourist, blows
 back and forth in the gentle summer breeze.

 A group of clucking chickens peck their way around the farmyard,
 desperately searching for grain.

 The farm gate to the south-west is safely shut.

 A crumpled leaflet, presumably discarded by a passing tourist, blows
 back and forth in the gentle summer breeze.

>read leaflet
 The leaflet has been torn, mud-bespattered, and generally maltreated,
 and as such you can make out very little, but it seems to cover topics
 as wide ranging as sheep varieties, weather forecasting and the
 country code. It also includes a badly typeset advert for a badly
 typeset computer game called 'LSE' by Shirc Shimt.

>look up lse in leaflet
 You discover nothing of interest in the leaflet.

>look up sheep in leaflet
 Apparently there are three main varieties of sheep found in Skebdale:
 the hardy Skebdale Mountain Sheep, the fatter, more cautious,
 Skebdale-Milton Keynes Cross, and, finally, the newly-bred Fliglot.
 There are individual paragraphs on each breed.

>look up mountain
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>look up mountain in leaflet
 The Skebdale Mountain Sheep is an ancient breed, adapted to cope with
 grazing on steep moorland. It is world famous for its most unusual
 trait: the pair of legs on one side of any sheep are shorter than the
 pair on the other. This allows the sheep to walk around the mountain
 while remaining upright. There are two distinct strains: those with a
 left-leg bias, and those with a right-leg bias. Obviously
 interbreeding is impossible between the two strains of sheep due to
 simple geographical problems. This means that the two strains have
 drifted apart to form differing sub-species. The left-leg variety are
 the more common as they graze with the prevailing wind around the
 hills in Skebdale. The right-leg  variety, however, tend to end up
 grazing against the wind. This means they graze more slowly as they
 must cope with more air resistance, and they have hence become the
 rarer breed. To overcome these aerodynamic difficulties the right-leg
 variety developed closer, shorter, more tight-knit coats that allowed
 them to move faster. However, in order to counterbalance the resulting
 heat loss, they have evolved thin, concentrated layers of fat beneath
 their skin.

 The Skebdale sheep has never spread further than a few hills in
 Skebdale as it is perfectly suited to the slope angle of Skebdale
 Pike. The leg-bias makes migration difficult and unrewarding, so the
 Skebdale Mountain Sheep remains an isolated and extraordinary
 specimen.

>look up keynes in leaflet
 The Skebdale Milton-Keynes Cross was a result of cross-breeding in the
 mid-nineteenth century (before the invention of ethics). It created a
 sheep ideally suited to living on the flat flood plain of Skebdale
 Beck. The Milton is possibly the exact opposite of the Skebdale
 mountain sheep. It is a low slung sheep which hugs the ground for
 warmth and protection, it's layers of fat and wool insulating it from
 temperatures lower than 30 degrees. A farmer's dream, it grazes slowly
 and steadily, producing perfectly mown stretches of grass, and
 yielding high quantities of wool, milk, and fat. The famous cricket
 pitch in Skebdale was brought to such a high degree of perfection due
 to a groundsman's brilliant idea. By releasing several Miltons at the
 right time and angle around the pitch, he created a perfect
 overlapping hexagonal cut, something very rarely seen on cricket
 pitches. It was this flash of inspiration that originally brought fame
 to Skebdale and resulted in the booming tourist industry that now
 flourishes there.

 The name of the sheep is not, in fact, derived from the town, but from
 the 19th century creators of the sheep, Mr. Milton and Mr. Keynes. (It
 is a little known fact that the town is actually named after the
 sheep, not the village of the same name. The developers were so
 impressed with the concept of a large, artificially created, easily
 manageable sheep, that they decided to apply exactly the same
 principles to town planning.)

>look up fliglot in leaflet
 The Fliglot was an experimental sheep first released in early June
 1966. Bred by the now infamous farmers-cum-genetic-engineers Liz and
 Ned Brown, of Fliglot Farm, Skebdale, it had a short black coat, two
 straight, sharp horns, prominent hooves and a pointed swishy tail.
 Comments at the time likened it to a goat rather than a sheep, but it
 quite happily bred with the other breeds in Skebdale to produce a
 small flock of Fliglots. However, they were extremely lazy and
 unproductive, and also quite violent. In the late 1970s they broke
 free of their field in South Skebdale. There was a brief spurt of
 mysterious disappearances in the village the same week, accompanied by
 heavy storms. At the end of the week the Fliglots returned to their
 pen and peace returned to the village. Since then the sheep have been
 regarded as a good luck omen and guarded against escape at all costs.

>go north

 Hall
 The farm's hallway serves its purpose well. In other words, its the
 way in. It leads up to a dark staircase, the northern end flanked by
 two low, wooden doorframes. Along the west wall, there is a row of
 three or four wooden pegs, underneath which is a delapidated welly
 rack.

 A bright yellow floppy sou'wester hangs from one of the pegs, clashing
 badly with the corridor's decor.

>get yellow
 You take the sou'wester, revealing an electric socket underneath.

>examine yellow
 The sou'wester is dazzlingly yellow. Glowingly mustard-hued, no less.

 Farmhouse Kitchen
 Painted in an uninspiring shade of pastel cream-gunk, the farmhouse
 kitchen has evolved over time into a mixture of modern and ancient
 appliances jumbled against the walls. Decorated with stains ranging

 country life in all its glory.

 A single rubber glove lies discarded upon the draining board.

 You can also see a kettle here.

 The Green Calf
 This single-roomed inn is dominated by a long bar, topped with
 perfectly polished wood. The shelves behind the bar are stacked to
 breaking point with sparkling glasses and inviting bottles. A single
 beer pump protrudes forlornly from the bar at one end, but it is,
 unfortunately, un-manned, so you will have to cope without a drink. A
 well-oiled wooden door leads south-east into the street.

 The Green Calf
 This single-roomed inn is dominated by a long bar, topped with
 perfectly polished wood. The shelves behind the bar are stacked to
 breaking point with sparkling glasses and inviting bottles. A single
 beer pump protrudes forlornly from the bar at one end, but it is,
 unfortunately, un-manned, so you will have to cope without a drink. A
 well-oiled wooden door leads south-east into the street.

 Old Tom, Old Dick, and Old Harry sit around the beer pump, whispering

 Country Lane

 A short gravel track leads up to a wooden gate to your north-east.

 Your car, a battered blue Volvo estate, is slewed across the grass
 verge, two wheels in the ditch.

 Farmyard
 This wide rectangle of concrete is littered with the chaotic fallout
 of everyday dairy farming. And its brown! The stark windows of the
 farmhouse stare accusingly down into the yard from the north, and, to
 the east, the roof of the main barn is outlined against the rising
 sun.

 The farm gate to the south-west is safely shut.

 A crumpled leaflet, presumably discarded by a passing tourist, blows
 back and forth in the gentle summer breeze.

 A group of clucking chickens peck their way around the farmyard,
 desperately searching for grain.

 Black cumulonimbus clouds tower over Skebdale to the north-west.

 Barn
 Most of the space in the east end of the farms high stone barn is
 taken up by a huge haystack of rectangular bales, each of which is
 held together with tough, plastic twine. Around the double doors rusty
 farm equipment, almost inevitably infected with a potent range of
 bacteria, microbes, protozoa and agriculture ministers, lies derelict
 and unused.

 A red and white tractor is parked next to the haystack.

>examine tractor
 The tractor was presumably new once (most things were), but its paint
 has started to peel off, with bubbles of rust forming all over the
 bodywork. The makers mark on the side reads simply 'Case

 Hall
 The farm's hallway serves its purpose well. In other words, its the
 way in. It leads up to a dark staircase, the northern end flanked by
 two low, wooden doorframes. Along the west wall, there is a row of
 three or four wooden pegs, underneath which is a delapidated welly
 rack.

 A bright yellow floppy sou'wester hangs from one of the pegs, clashing
 badly with the corridor's decor.

 Farmhouse Kitchen
 Painted in an uninspiring shade of pastel cream-gunk, the farmhouse
 kitchen has evolved over time into a mixture of modern and ancient
 appliances jumbled against the walls. Decorated with stains ranging
 from champagne to tomato ketchup, the ceiling has obviously seen
 country life in all its glory.

 A single rubber glove lies discarded upon the draining board.

 You can also see a kettle here.

 The storm continues at full force outside.

 The storm continues at full force outside.

 Lounge
 The farmhouse's lounge closely resembles a bomb site. An old sofa,
 covered in ragged blankets and thin cushions, is positioned opposite a
 large TV and a wide, open fireplace. The window, hung with clashing
 flowery curtains, faces out onto the farmyard. A door in the east wall
 leads out to the hall.

 Laid out in front of the fireplace is a thick hearth-rug, covered in
 dog hair.

 Curled up on the rug there is, of course, a dog.

 The unusually violent storm suddenly dies and Skebdale is silent and
 peaceful once more.

 Country Lane
 A winding country road threads its way between old stone cottages and
 barns. Daffodils and snowdrops spring from the grass verges, adding a
 dash of colour to the grey walls and roofs. To your north, the sign of
 'The Green Calf' swings in the sunshine, beckoning locals and tourists
 alike to pop in for a drink. There is a small garden to the south of

 A beautiful Yorkshire garden, full of mouth-watering fruits such as
 parsnips, marrows and broccoli. This is more a vegetable garden than

 unthreatening farmer's cottage.

 A garden fork has been rammed disrespectfully into a steaming compost
 heap in one corner of the garden.

 Country Lane
 A winding country road threads its way between old stone cottages and
 barns. Daffodils and snowdrops spring from the grass verges, adding a
 dash of colour to the grey walls and roofs. To your north, the sign of
 'The Green Calf' swings in the sunshine, beckoning locals and tourists
 alike to pop in for a drink. There is a small garden to the south of
 the road which is attached, unsurprisingly, to a small house.

 A short gravel track leads up to a wooden gate to your north-east.

 Your car, a battered blue Volvo estate, is slewed across the grass
 verge, two wheels in the ditch.

 You can also see a rubber glove here.

 Garden
 A beautiful Yorkshire garden, full of mouth-watering fruits such as
 parsnips, marrows and broccoli. This is more a vegetable garden than

 Farmyard
 This wide rectangle of concrete is littered with the chaotic fallout
 of everyday dairy farming. And its brown! The stark windows of the
 farmhouse stare accusingly down into the yard from the north, and, to
 the east, the roof of the main barn is outlined against the rising
 sun.

 The farm gate to the south-west is safely shut.

 A group of clucking chickens peck their way around the farmyard,
 desperately searching for grain.

>go north

 Hall
 The farm's hallway serves its purpose well. In other words, its the
 way in. It leads up to a dark staircase, the northern end flanked by
 two low, wooden doorframes. Along the west wall, there is a row of
 three or four wooden pegs, underneath which is a delapidated welly
 rack.

 Built into the west wall under the pegs is an electric socket.

 Lounge
 The farmhouse's lounge closely resembles a bomb site. An old sofa,
 covered in ragged blankets and thin cushions, is positioned opposite a
 large TV and a wide, open fireplace. The window, hung with clashing
 flowery curtains, faces out onto the farmyard. A door in the east wall
 leads out to the hall.

 Laid out in front of the fireplace is a thick hearth-rug, covered in
 dog hair.

 Curled up on the rug there is, of course, a dog.

 Underground Passage
 This low, earth-hewn passage is cramped and dirty. Held up by crude
 wooden props, it looks none too stable. The tunnel is quite short,
 only about twenty metres in length. At the south-east end is the short
 stone staircase which leads up to the trapdoor, while to the
 north-west is an enormous door.

 The enormous door is more firmly shut than the main air-lock on Space
 Shuttle Paranoia.

 The leaflet has been torn, mud-bespattered, and generally maltreated,
 and as such you can make out very little, but it seems to cover topics
 as wide ranging as sheep varieties, weather forecasting and the
 country code. It also includes a badly typeset advert for a badly

>push black button
 The door emits a long, low pitched beep.

>open door

 The main points of the country code are, according to the leaflet:

 - Guard against all risk of fire.
 - Leave gates as you find them.
 - Keep dogs under close control.
 - Keep to public footpaths.
 - Take your litter home.
 - Make no unnecessary noise.

 The leaflet goes on to explain how anyone breaking the code in
 Skebdale faces punishment by the Skebdale flying squad, an elite group
 of park wardens who punish criminals quickly and efficiently.

 The Green Calf
 This single-roomed inn is dominated by a long bar, topped with
 perfectly polished wood. The shelves behind the bar are stacked to
 breaking point with sparkling glasses and inviting bottles. A single
 beer pump protrudes forlornly from the bar at one end, but it is,
 unfortunately, un-manned, so you will have to cope without a drink. A
 well-oiled wooden door leads south-east into the street.

 Old Tom, Old Dick, and Old Harry sit around the beer pump, whispering
 conspiratorially.

 The border collie pads off towards the farmyard.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>open envelope
 The flap is obviously secured with some sort of superglue as you
 cannot tear it open at all.

>get it

 You are carrying:
   an envelope
   a brass key
   an empty can of beer
   a garden fork
   a briefcase (which is open)
     a key ring
   a white coat (being worn)
     a glass jar
     a remote control (which is open but empty)
     a faxed note
     a leaflet
     a typed note
     a toy pistol
     a kettle
     a rubber glove
   a sou'wester (being worn)

>out
 You get out of the tractor.

 Barn
 Most of the space in the east end of the farms high stone barn is
 taken up by a huge haystack of rectangular bales, each of which is
 held together with tough, plastic twine. Around the double doors rusty
 farm equipment, almost inevitably infected with a potent range of
 bacteria, microbes, protozoa and agriculture ministers, lies derelict
 and unused.

 A long rope ladder, safely twined around several hay bales, leads
 downwards from the ledge to the barn floor.

 A red and white tractor is parked next to the haystack.

>go west

 Farmyard
 This wide rectangle of concrete is littered with the chaotic fallout
 of everyday dairy farming. And its brown! The stark windows of the
 farmhouse stare accusingly down into the yard from the north, and, to
 the east, the roof of the main barn is outlined against the rising
 sun.

 The farm gate to the south-west is safely shut.

 A group of clucking chickens peck their way around the farmyard,
 desperately searching for grain.

>go north

 Hall
 The farm's hallway serves its purpose well. In other words, its the
 way in. It leads up to a dark staircase, the northern end flanked by
 two low, wooden doorframes. Along the west wall, there is a row of
 three or four wooden pegs, underneath which is a delapidated welly
 rack.

 The collie paces restlessly up and down the hall.

 Built into the west wall under the pegs is an electric socket.

 A post-card showing a rolling vista of Yorkshire countryside, taken
 from Skebdale Pike. A few unintelligible notes and messages have been
 scrawled on the back in slightly smudged fountain pen:

 Lounge
 The farmhouse's lounge closely resembles a bomb site. An old sofa,
 covered in ragged blankets and thin cushions, is positioned opposite a
 large TV and a wide, open fireplace. The window, hung with clashing
 flowery curtains, faces out onto the farmyard. A door in the east wall
 leads out to the hall.

 A dark staircase leads downwards from the open trapdoor.

 A rolled up rug lies on the floor next to the fireplace.

>go down

 Underground Passage
 This low, earth-hewn passage is cramped and dirty. Held up by crude
 wooden props, it looks none too stable. The tunnel is quite short,
 only about twenty metres in length. At the south-east end is the short
 stone staircase which leads up to the trapdoor, while to the
 north-west is an enormous door.

 The enormous door is more firmly shut than the main air-lock on Space
 Shuttle Paranoia.

>examine door
 An enormous, circular door, no doubt made of some extremely unlikely
 space age metal which can only be cut using a knife blade forged in
 the core of a red giant. Or something like that. There, right in the
 centre, is one of those lock-cum-handle thingummybobs that you get on
 all good bank vaults.

 Lab Six
 A shining white laboratory decked out with rows of pristine benches
 and tables. Shelves full of ridiculous sounding biochemicals line the
 walls. The room is windowless and lit only by fluorescent bulbs on the
 ceiling.

 You can leave by the door to the south.

 A wooden pinboard on one wall is covered in clippings from various
 respected publications.

 Some sort of sci-fi gadget sits on the main lab bench.

>examine gadget
 You can't have a proper adventure game these days without some special
 sci-fi gadget. In this case it resembles a microwave oven. It also
 sports a row of LEDs so it can flash them back and forth as it speaks
 in its predictably sarcastic monotone. Whoever built this one was well
 au fait with current trends and even painted a smiley face on the
 speaker. Lovely.

 You stumble from the labyrinthine passages into...

 Altar Chamber
 This room is Gothic horror at its best. Dry, wooden torches burn
 brightly in their rusty iron brackets, sending a flickering orange
 light flashing around the high, vaulted stone rafters and dull granite
 flagstones. The walls are daubed with unsightly scenes of scarlet
 terror and cruelty, and, at the centre of this hexagonal cathedral of
 doom, a gigantic inverted cross hangs in space, suspended by a
 criss-crossing web of thin, spider-like ropes which lead ever upwards
 into the enormous arched roof. Sinister shadows are cast onto the
 floor from the grotesque, twisted statuettes which stand on their dark
 pedestals, seeming to writhe in the torchlight. Where the hell is this
 place...

 Any moment now you expect a nice man with horns and hooves to jump
 from the shadows and discuss the afterlife, but, fortunately, there
 seem to be none of those in today.

 Instead, a small note has been attached to the bottom of the cross
 with a drawing pin.

 From the far side of the chamber, high up on one wall, an enormous,
 abstract black and red pictogram stares down at you.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine pictogram
 It depicts simply the head of a cow - but no ordinary heifer. Its ears
 are long and pointed, its eyes narrow, and its nostrils wide and
 flaring-red. The mouth is half-open in a Satanic grin, exposing double
 rows of carnivorous teeth. You dread to look for fear of being
 ensnared in the deep, swirling, whirling eyes...

>read note
 (the note)
 You can't read it from down on the floor.

 You feel uneasy, as if the pictogram is watching your every move.

>examine cross
 It's over-riding feature is that it is the wrong way up. However, just
 for the record, it is made from two gigantic oak beams held together
 by two enormously thick selotape straps.

>climb cross
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

 You feel unable to stop yourself turning and staring into the swirling
 eyes of the pictogram.

>close eyes
 You can't see any such thing.

>wait

>wait

 An irresistible surge of terror rises within you as the face of the
 pictogram twists and seems to force its way out of the wall. You try
 to shut your eyes to it, but your only option seems to be flight. You
 have little time to escape as the power of the evil has almost rooted
 you to the spot.

>wait
 Time passes.
 The primitive drawing continues to wrench itself into reality in a
 series of horrific jerks and contortions.

>again
 Time passes.
 As the scene comes to life before you a wind whips around the chamber,
 statues are blown over and torches threaten to go out. The evil figure
 emerging from the wall roars in anger at your intrusion.

>again
 Time passes.
 The figure of a cow, decked in blood and gore, begins to take shape
 from the writhing pictogram and screams a dire warning. "Access
 Denied! Access Denied! Unauthorised personnel in building!" You start
 to petrify with fear.

>pee self
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>wait
 Time passes.
 An involuntary scream rips your throat open as the devilish figure
 pops from the canvas like a satanical morph. "Trespassers will be
 prosecuted....." screams the phantom of the pit as it totters about on
 its hind-legs, wreathed in smoke and flames. These demonic vassals
 never were very good at co-ordination, were they?

>kill cow
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.
 "I will destroy you!!!" The demon raises a hoof and a ball of fiery
 flame (isn't it all) cannons towards you. You are engulfed utterly,
 perish utterly, and generally cease to exist.

 Barn
 Most of the space in the east end of the farms high stone barn is

 held together with tough, plastic twine. Around the double doors rusty
 farm equipment, almost inevitably infected with a potent range of
 bacteria, microbes, protozoa and agriculture ministers, lies derelict

 Towering black cumulonimbus clouds pour forth vast quantities of tiny,
 hard hailstones onto Skebdale.

 The sheepdog scampers back and forth along the base of the haystack,
 sniffing at cracks and whimpering.

 Altar Chamber
 This room is Gothic horror at its best. Dry, wooden torches burn
 brightly in their rusty iron brackets, sending a flickering orange
 light flashing around the high, vaulted stone rafters and dull granite
 flagstones. The walls are daubed with unsightly scenes of scarlet
 terror and cruelty, and, at the centre of this hexagonal cathedral of
 doom, a gigantic inverted cross hangs in space, suspended by a
 criss-crossing web of thin, spider-like ropes which lead ever upwards
 into the enormous arched roof. Sinister shadows are cast onto the
 floor from the grotesque, twisted statuettes which stand on their dark
 pedestals, seeming to writhe in the torchlight. Where the hell is this
 place...

 Any moment now you expect a nice man with horns and hooves to jump
 from the shadows and discuss the afterlife, but, fortunately, there
 seem to be none of those in today.

 Instead, a small note has been attached to the bottom of the cross
 with a drawing pin.

 From the far side of the chamber, high up on one wall, an enormous,
 abstract black and red pictogram stares down at you.

>wait

 You feel uneasy, as if the pictogram is watching your every move.

 to shut your eyes to it, but your only option seems to be flight. You
 have little time to escape as the power of the evil has almost rooted
 you to the spot.

 statues are blown over and torches threaten to go out. The evil figure
 emerging from the wall roars in anger at your intrusion.

>examine figure

 It depicts simply the head of a cow - but no ordinary heifer. Its ears
 are long and pointed, its eyes narrow, and its nostrils wide and
 flaring-red. The mouth is half-open in a Satanic grin, exposing double
 rows of carnivorous teeth. You dread to look for fear of being
 ensnared in the deep, swirling, whirling eyes...
 The figure of a cow, decked in blood and gore, begins to take shape
 from the writhing pictogram and screams a dire warning. "Access
 Denied! Access Denied! Unauthorised personnel in building!" You start
 to petrify with fear.

 An involuntary scream rips your throat open as the devilish figure
 pops from the canvas like a satanical morph. "Trespassers will be

 Altar Chamber
 This room is Gothic horror at its best. Dry, wooden torches burn
 brightly in their rusty iron brackets, sending a flickering orange
 light flashing around the high, vaulted stone rafters and dull granite
 flagstones. The walls are daubed with unsightly scenes of scarlet
 terror and cruelty, and, at the centre of this hexagonal cathedral of
 doom, a gigantic inverted cross hangs in space, suspended by a
 criss-crossing web of thin, spider-like ropes which lead ever upwards
 into the enormous arched roof. Sinister shadows are cast onto the
 floor from the grotesque, twisted statuettes which stand on their dark
 pedestals, seeming to writhe in the torchlight. Where the hell is this
 place...

 Any moment now you expect a nice man with horns and hooves to jump
 from the shadows and discuss the afterlife, but, fortunately, there
 seem to be none of those in today.

 Instead, a small note has been attached to the bottom of the cross
 with a drawing pin.

 From the far side of the chamber, high up on one wall, an enormous,
 abstract black and red pictogram stares down at you.

 You raise the pistol and squirt a shining arc through the air towards

 demonic Denzil erupts in fire and smoke, the body crumbling
 dramatically into ash. You're sure there should be some brimstone in
 there somewhere, but your probing nostrils fail to deliver and you
 miss the experience of a lifetime.

 Denzil's final roar ("I'll sue...") reverberates around the cavern, as

 tumbling from the ceiling. You had better make the safety of the

 Altar Chamber
 This room is Gothic horror at its best. Dry, wooden torches burn
 brightly in their rusty iron brackets, sending a flickering orange
 light flashing around the high, vaulted stone rafters and dull granite
 flagstones. The walls are daubed with unsightly scenes of scarlet
 terror and cruelty, and, at the centre of this hexagonal cathedral of

 criss-crossing web of thin, spider-like ropes which lead ever upwards
 into the enormous arched roof. Sinister shadows are cast onto the
 floor from the grotesque, twisted statuettes which stand on their dark
 pedestals, seeming to writhe in the torchlight. Where the hell is this
 place...

 Any moment now you expect a nice man with horns and hooves to jump

 Altar Chamber
 This room is Gothic horror at its best. Dry, wooden torches burn
 brightly in their rusty iron brackets, sending a flickering orange
 light flashing around the high, vaulted stone rafters and dull granite
 flagstones. The walls are daubed with unsightly scenes of scarlet
 terror and cruelty, and, at the centre of this hexagonal cathedral of
 doom, a gigantic inverted cross hangs in space, suspended by a
 criss-crossing web of thin, spider-like ropes which lead ever upwards
 into the enormous arched roof. Sinister shadows are cast onto the
 floor from the grotesque, twisted statuettes which stand on their dark
 pedestals, seeming to writhe in the torchlight. Where the hell is this
 place...

 Any moment now you expect a nice man with horns and hooves to jump
 from the shadows and discuss the afterlife, but, fortunately, there
 seem to be none of those in today.

 Altar Chamber
 This room is Gothic horror at its best. Dry, wooden torches burn
 brightly in their rusty iron brackets, sending a flickering orange
 light flashing around the high, vaulted stone rafters and dull granite
 flagstones. The walls are daubed with unsightly scenes of scarlet
 terror and cruelty, and, at the centre of this hexagonal cathedral of
 doom, a gigantic inverted cross hangs in space, suspended by a
 criss-crossing web of thin, spider-like ropes which lead ever upwards
 into the enormous arched roof. Sinister shadows are cast onto the
 floor from the grotesque, twisted statuettes which stand on their dark
 pedestals, seeming to writhe in the torchlight. Where the hell is this
 place...

 Any moment now you expect a nice man with horns and hooves to jump
 from the shadows and discuss the afterlife, but, fortunately, there
 seem to be none of those in today.

 Instead, a small note has been attached to the bottom of the cross
 with a drawing pin.

 From the far side of the chamber, high up on one wall, an enormous,
 abstract black and red pictogram stares down at you.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine pistol
 The pistol is an uninspiring shade of washed-out pink, but makes up
 for it with the battery-powered sound effects generator tagged on to
 the handle. Its pea-sized water tank is currently full of water.

>empty pistol
 Emptied.

 You feel uneasy, as if the pictogram is watching your every move.

>pour jar in pistol
 The glass jar is closed.

>open jar
 You open the glass jar.

 You feel unable to stop yourself turning and staring into the swirling
 eyes of the pictogram.

>pour jar in pistol
 You fill the pistol from the jar.

>wait
 Time passes.
 An irresistible surge of terror rises within you as the face of the
 pictogram twists and seems to force its way out of the wall. You try
 to shut your eyes to it, but your only option seems to be flight. You
 have little time to escape as the power of the evil has almost rooted
 you to the spot.

>wait
 Time passes.
 The primitive drawing continues to wrench itself into reality in a
 series of horrific jerks and contortions.

>wait
 Time passes.
 As the scene comes to life before you a wind whips around the chamber,
 statues are blown over and torches threaten to go out. The evil figure
 emerging from the wall roars in anger at your intrusion.

>wait
 Time passes.
 The figure of a cow, decked in blood and gore, begins to take shape
 from the writhing pictogram and screams a dire warning. "Access
 Denied! Access Denied! Unauthorised personnel in building!" You start
 to petrify with fear.

>shoot pistol at cow
 You raise the pistol and squirt a shining arc through the air towards
 your adversary. The liquid, despite your bad aim, hits it right
 between the eyes, in true David and Goliath tradition. The head of the
 demonic Denzil erupts in fire and smoke, the body crumbling
 dramatically into ash. You're sure there should be some brimstone in
 there somewhere, but your probing nostrils fail to deliver and you
 miss the experience of a lifetime.

 Denzil's final roar ("I'll sue...") reverberates around the cavern, as
 these things do. The whole chamber suddenly begins to shake, rocks
 tumbling from the ceiling. You had better make the safety of the
 farmyard or your number is surely up.

 Towering black cumulonimbus clouds pour forth vast quantities of tiny,
 hard hailstones onto Skebdale.

 sniffing at cracks and whimpering.

>amusing

 A few allegedly amusing facts about BSE...

 The note in the Altar Chamber can be reached and read - just try to
 destroy the demonic pin using the toy pistol. Don't expect to
 understand the contents though!

 If you hadn't worked it out, the Demonic vassal at the end was called
 Denzil. His earthly creators, Liz and Ned Brown, who bred him in the
 genetics lab downstairs, named him after themselves, but with the
 names turned around.

 Likewise if you hadn't worked it out, Samuel Smith, the 'Model' in the
 Discredits on the help menu, is a dog, and the border collie was
 modelled on him to a certain extent.
