 FOREWORD

 The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and
 is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be
 highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your
 investigation.

 The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other
 characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant:
 it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about
 something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made
 elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when
 laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you
 will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead.

 Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample
 time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in
 fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at
 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose
 patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of
 his arrival.

 And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits!

 "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache
 mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield.
 "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought
 up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the
 neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He
 was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house
 about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from
 his study window."

 "Think he might have jumped?"

 "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder
 unless you can find anything to prove otherwise."

 You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says,
 "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
 The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're
 ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?"

 "Got it."

 What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy
 drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late
 it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

 Front Drive
 You are standing on the front drive of Gull Point, residence of noted
 theatrical patron Frederic Sheppard. The house, a rambling old place,
 stands to the south.

 Beside the front doors, the large doorbell button gleams amber in the
 moonlight.

 You can also see a red Triumph Roadster, a blue Austin and a green
 Morris Saloon here.

 Front Drive
 You are standing on the front drive of Gull Point, residence of noted
 theatrical patron Frederic Sheppard. The house, a rambling old place,
 stands to the south.

 Beside the front doors, the large doorbell button gleams amber in the
 moonlight.

 You can also see a red Triumph Roadster, a blue Austin and a green
 Morris Saloon here.

>ring doorbell
 You ring the doorbell. Somewhere deep in the recesses of the house,
 pleasant chimes announce your arrival. A moment later, the front door
 swings open.

 The woman who appears in the doorway appears to be about 30, quite
 attractive, with steel-frame glasses. Her manner is cool and aloof; if
 she is at all disturbed by the current situation, she's hiding it well.
 She looks you up and down through clear blue eyes before speaking.
 "Good evening. I take it you must be from the police?"

>no

 She raises an eyebrow. "No? What do you want, then?" Faced with a
 distinct lack of anything else to say, you admit that you are, after
 all, the police. The woman draws her lips into a tight line and says,
 "This is hardly the time to be playing the fool, Inspector. Now please,
 come in."

 Entrance Foyer
 Theatrical bills on the walls give this otherwise sterile entry hall
 the appearance of a theatrical lobby. The front doors are to the north,
 and the central hall is to the south. The cloak room is to the east.

 "My name is Deborah Wolf, by the way. Frederic Sheppard was my uncle.
 My husband and I just arrived today to spend the weekend...." She
 shakes her head. "I'm sorry. It has all been a terrible shock. Please,
 come this way."

 She takes a few steps towards the south and pauses, waiting for you.

>go south
 As she walks with you, Deborah Wolf says, "I should explain that my
 husband is Alexander Wolf, the playwright. He's working on a new stage
 musical called Twisty Passages, with a friend, Elinor Lamb. They were
 going to spend the weekend here, working on it together."

 Just as you pass under the arch into the central hall, the grandfather
 clock by the stairs chimes the midnight hour in doleful tones.
 Wonderful.

 Central Hall
 The central hall is a two-storeyed room, with wide arches north,
 northwest, southeast and east. French doors to the south open into the
 library, and a flight of stairs leads upstairs. The kitchen is through
 a discreet little door to the west. High above, the night sky is
 visible through a vast skylight.

 Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively.

 Loud, ponderous ticking echoes from the grandfather clock by the
 stairs.

 The hall telephone stands in its niche beneath the stairs like an
 inscrutable modern art sculpture.

 As you set your watch and wind it up, a tall, slender young man emerges
 from the drawing room to the east. "Ah," he drawls, "the illustrious
 representative of the Law. How perfectly delightful." He looks down at
 you with a vaguely supercilious manner.

 Deborah Wolf makes the introductions. "Inspector, this is Mr Benedict
 Lamb, Elinor Lamb's brother. As I mentioned, Miss Lamb is collaborating
 with my husband on a stage musical; and Benedict here is acting
 chaperone."

 "Never trust a Wolf alone with a Lamb, I always say."

>ask deborah about window
 Benedict Lamb interrupts you, saying, a little sharply, "I think we can
 leave my sister out of any of this, Inspector. She's in a wheelchair;
 her health is practically non-existant. She's quite incapable of any
 acts of violence. Would you agree?"

>examine deborah
>no

 Benedict Lamb's grey eyes flash angrily, but Deborah Wolf quickly says,
 "The Inspector hasn't even seen the -- the body yet. You can't honestly
 expect him to make that sort of a judgement without evidence!"

 Benedict merely sneers. Deborah Wolf rolls her eyes and says, "Where is
 Elinor, Ben?"

 "She's in the conservatory, of course." Benedict jerks his head to the
 northwest arch, through which you can see the dining room. "I told her
 she should go to bed and get some rest, but she insists on staying up
 for the investigation." He looks in your direction. "Any time you want
 to speak with her, Inspector, be my guest. Though I assure you it won't
 be necessary."

 Benedict turns on his heel and strides back into the drawing room.
 Deborah heads towards the door to south. "Shall we continue,
 Inspector?"

>yes
 Deborah lowers her voice and says, "Ben's very protective of his
 sister, which is sweet but perhaps a little obsessive, in my opinion.
 Elinor may be wheelchair-bound, but she is nowhere near as delicate as
 he seems to think."

 Library
 The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen
 of crowded bookshelves occupying the west wall. The rest of the room is
 occupied with modern art. French doors open north to the central hall
 and southeast onto the terrace. The billiards room is through an
 anonymous-looking door to the east.

 Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively.

 On closer inspection, one piece of modern art turns out to actually be
 a clock.

 You can also see a tide table here.

 A short, red-headed young man is bent over a leather briefcase as you
 enter the Library. He looks up, startled, as you come in, and hurriedly
 shuts the briefcase. Then he's all smiles and cheerful camaraderie as
 he tosses his briefcase into a corner and comes forward to shake your
 hand.

 "Inspector," says Deborah, "I'd like you to meet Mr Cedric Crane, my
 uncle's former accountant. He was the one -- along with Mr Lamb -- who
 discovered the crime and raised the alarm."

 Cedric Crane pumps your arm with all the excessive energy of a
 campaigning politician. Close up, you realise that he must actually be
 quite a bit older than he appeared at first glance. "A pleasure to make
 your acquaintance," he says expansively, beaming from ear to ear.

>ask cedric about briefcase
 Cedric Crane doesn't seem to have much to say about the leather
 briefcase.

 There is a short burst of music from the west. Cedric Crane says, "We
 left Mr Sheppard's wireless on. Since it was part of the crime scene,
 we didn't want to disturb it."

 "You'd best take the Inspector to the body," says Deborah to Cedric,
 "since you were the one who found him, after all."

 Cedric does not look too happy at this, but turns towards the
 southeastern exit.

>get briefcase
 "Inspector, that briefcase is private." Cedric smiles, but it doesn't
 quite reach his eyes.

 The door to the east suddenly crashes open, revealing a
 broad-shouldered, truculent-looking man holding a billiard cue. He
 glares at you.

 "This is Alexander Wolf," says Deborah, "my husband." Alexander makes a
 brief sweeping gesture by way of greeting, and growls, "let's get this
 over with as quickly as possible, eh?"

 "Alex, you've been drinking."

 Cedric Crane whispers to you, "We'd best head on out, Inspector." He
 quietly exits the room to the southeast.

>follow cedric
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>se

 East Terrace
 The wide, stone-paved terrace overlooks the sea here to the west and
 south, and stairs lead down towards the beach. French doors go north to
 the billiard room and northwest to the library. The terrace itself
 continues to the west, around the corner of the library.

 You can see Cedric Crane here.

 Cedric Crane nods to you. "Right then. You've met the Wolfs, of course;
 have you met the Lambs? Benedict and Elinor? The five of us would be
 the only people in the house at the moment, other than yourself.
 Anyway, it seems plain that Mr Sheppard must have been killed in his
 study," he says, pointing to a part of the house just west of the
 library, "but Mr Lamb and I found him among the rocks down by the
 beach. Come on, I'll show you."

 Cedric Crane turns and descends the stairs to the cliffside path below.

 From the direction of Library, you hear Alexander Wolf's raised voice,
 and then the slamming of a door.

>go down

 Rocky Cliffside Path
 On one side is the steep cliff, punctuated with scrubby bushes clinging
 to crevices in the rock face; on the other side, you are completely
 exposed to the wide expanse of the sea. Stairs go up to the terrace of
 Gull Point, not quite visible from here, and the path itself winds down
 to the rocky beach below.

 You can see Cedric Crane here.

 Cedric Crane goes down.

>go down

 Beach
 It is a quiet, moonlit night. The waters of the lagoon lap gently
 against the sand. Treacherous-looking rocks surround the beach, but a
 narrow path back up to the house has been cut into the cliff face
 behind you, and the rocks to the northwest look just safe enough to
 clamber over.

 You can see Cedric Crane here.

 Cedric Crane looks around at you and points off to the northwest.
 "There's a small tide pool out that way. That's where Mr Lamb and I
 found the body. I think it must have been a bit after 11:00 pm --
 probably about 11:10 pm -- we're not surrounded by clocks out here as
 we are up in the house. We did take a closer look, of course, to make
 sure we weren't just making a horrible mistake, but otherwise we didn't
 touch anything."

>thank cedric
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>think about strawberries and punting
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>go northwest
 As you begin picking your way through the rocks, Cedric Crane turns and
 heads back up to the house.

 Rocks
 If the beach was isolated, this rocky area is even more so. Seawater
 filters in through the rocks all around to fill this little tide pool,
 currently at a low ebb. On one side, the cliff rises sharply up, and
 from here you can just make out the broken window of Frederic
 Sheppard's study. The least treacherous path through the rocks goes
 southeast, back to the beach.

 A sturdy wooden post stands upright in the water, just a short distance
 from the body.

 Frederic Sheppard is sprawled across the rocks, clearly dead.

>examine body
 In life, Frederic Sheppard was a big man, still quite robust at the age
 of 60. Right now, he's looking quite battered from the precipitous drop
 from his study window; it is not immediately apparent if it was the
 fall which killed him, or something else. He is also quite thoroughly
 soaked, though he's mostly clear of the water.

>search body
 What's this? There's a bit of a broken branch clutched in his hand. He
 must have pulled it off of one of the scrubby little bushes in the
 cliffside, on his way down.

 Further examination of the body reveals a a number of injuries
 consistent with either a sharp blow with a blunt object, or an
 unfortunate encounter with the side of a cliff. You're not quite enough
 of a forensics expert to distinguish between the two.

>get branch
 You already have that.

>examine window
 You can't make out any details from here.

>examine post
 A bold, white line near the top of the post indicates the high water
 mark. It seems pretty accurate: the wood still seems wet from the last
 high tide, right up to the mark itself.

>examine cliff
 By the light of the moon, you can make out a few stunted, twisted
 bushes clinging desperately to the rocks of the cliff.

>se

 Beach
 It is a quiet, moonlit night. The waters of the lagoon lap gently
 against the sand. Treacherous-looking rocks surround the beach, but a
 narrow path back up to the house has been cut into the cliff face
 behind you, and the rocks to the northwest look just safe enough to
 clamber over.

>go up

 Rocky Cliffside Path
 On one side is the steep cliff, punctuated with scrubby bushes clinging

 exposed to the wide expanse of the sea. Stairs go up to the terrace of
 Gull Point, not quite visible from here, and the path itself winds down
 to the rocky beach below.

>go up

 East Terrace
 The wide, stone-paved terrace overlooks the sea here to the west and
 south, and stairs lead down towards the beach. French doors go north to
 the billiard room and northwest to the library. The terrace itself
 continues to the west, around the corner of the library.

>go west

 West Terrace
 This section of the terrace is essentially a five-foot-wide walkway
 connecting the study to the north with the main part of the terrace, to
 the east.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

 There is a sudden swell of dramatic music. It seems to be coming from
 the study.

>go north

 Study
 This is Frederic Sheppard's study, a neat, spacious, modern room
 decorated with old theatrical bills. The library is through a door to
 the east, and french doors open south to the terrace. Cold, damp air
 flows in through the broken window to the west.

 The well-ordered study desk stands to one side of the broken window.
 On the study desk are a Faberge egg clock, a black telephone, a scrap
 of paper and an annotated ledger.

 A corner fireplace occupies, well, a corner.

 You can also see a wireless, an antique fireplace poker and a hunting
 rifle here.

 There is a sudden commotion: you hear raised voices and the sound of
 breaking glass from the wireless.

>examine scrap of paper
 Odd that this scrap of paper would be found sitting on Frederic
 Sheppard's pristine study desk, but perhaps he never got around to
 clearing it away. A telephone number has been hastily scrawled across
 it.

 From the wireless comes the soft hiss of static and the dramatic
 tension of a late-night radio show.

>call number
 You're not messing with the dead man's telephone any more than you can
 help. A fancy country house like this ought to have another telephone
 that you can use, probably out in the hall.

 You hear a muffled explosion from the wireless. It's rather convincing,
 but in fact it is merely part of tonight's radio show.

>get scrap of paper
 Taken.

 From the wireless comes the soft hiss of static and the dramatic
 tension of a late-night radio show.

>examine poker
 This poker hails from a time when fireplaces were the sole source of
 household heating, and, as such, were much larger and required pokers
 nearly the size of pool cues to reach properly into their recesses.
 Well, perhaps that's an exaggeration, but you certainly wouldn't want
 to be poked by this particular poker.

 From the wireless comes the soft hiss of static and the dramatic
 tension of a late-night radio show.

>fingerprint poker
 The forensics crew will be taking everybody's fingerprints in the
 morning, if you can't determine a Most Likely Suspect before then;
 frankly, the Chief Inspector would really prefer to spare everyone the
 inky fingers. So right now, the only useful set of prints you're likely
 to have are Frederic Sheppard's ... and this being his home, they're on
 absolutely everything.

 From the wireless comes the soft hiss of static and the dramatic
 tension of a late-night radio show.

>examine desk
 Frederic Sheppard's desk is spacious and tidy, with everything easily
 visible and within reach. A pair of drawers are stacked one atop the
 other on one side of the desk.

 From the wireless comes the soft hiss of static and the dramatic
 tension of a late-night radio show.

>search fireplace
 Which do you mean, the corner fireplace or the antique fireplace poker?

>corner
 You find nothing of interest.

 From the wireless comes the soft hiss of static and the dramatic
 tension of a late-night radio show.

>turn off wireless
 And not a moment too soon. That thing was as annoying as all hell.

 Study
 This is Frederic Sheppard's study, a neat, spacious, modern room
 decorated with old theatrical bills. The library is through a door to
 the east, and french doors open south to the terrace. Cold, damp air
 flows in through the broken window to the west.

 The well-ordered study desk stands to one side of the broken window.
 On the study desk are a Faberge egg clock, a black telephone and an
 annotated ledger.

 A corner fireplace occupies, well, a corner.

 You can also see a wireless, an antique fireplace poker and a hunting
 rifle here.

>examine window
 It doesn't look as though it was ever particularly sturdy; positioned
 as it is over a steep drop into the sea, it probably never needed to
 be. The casement opens outwards; the panes are cracked but otherwise
 intact. The latch, a rather flimsy affair, is twisted half off the
 frame. The sill is quite high off the floor: it seems highly unlikely
 that anyone might have fallen through it by accident.

>l through window
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine bushes
 By the light of the moon, you can make out a few stunted, twisted
 bushes clinging desperately to the rocks of the cliff.

>examine ledger
 This ledger details the investments and various business dealings of
 Frederic Sheppard and the Sheppard Trust. While the numbers seem to
 indicate a perfectly healthy state of affairs, someone has gone through
 this ledger with a red pen, making annotations in the margin, and
 pointing out subtle discrepancies. While he is far from ruined,
 Frederic Sheppard is clearly not quite as well-off as everyone seems to
 think, nor is the Sheppard Trust quite so healthy. The annotations
 culminate in a note to "Please speak to Cedric" written across the
 final page and underlined twice.

>examine clock
 An ostentatious antique: a clock in the shape of a gold easter egg,
 with all manner of baroque designs picked out over its surface.

>examine rifle
 It's fancy enough to be purely decorative, but it is after all a
 working firearm. A careful inspection shows it to be loaded.

>open drawer
 Which do you mean, the upper drawer or the lower drawer?

>upper
 You open the upper drawer.

>search upper drawer
 The upper drawer is empty.

>close upper drawer
 You close the upper drawer.

>open lower drawer
 You open the lower drawer, revealing a pistol.

>examine pistol
 This little pistol is so small, it might easily be mistaken for a toy.
 It is, however, quite the real thing.

>take pistol
 Taken.

>go east

 Library
 The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen
 of crowded bookshelves occupying the west wall. The rest of the room is
 occupied with modern art. French doors open north to the central hall
 and southeast onto the terrace. The billiards room is through an
 anonymous-looking door to the east.

 Deborah Wolf is curled up in a comfortable armchair, reading a mystery
 novel.

 On closer inspection, one piece of modern art turns out to actually be
 a clock.

 You can also see a leather briefcase and a tide table here.

>examine tide table
 Your eye goes straight for the present date. It seems the last high
 tide was 8:40 pm yesterday (or, if you prefer, 8:40 pm earlier
 tonight). Low tide is at 3:05 am and the following high tide at 9:30
 am.

>time
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 records.

 Central Hall
 The central hall is a two-storeyed room, with wide arches north,
 northwest, southeast and east. French doors to the south open into the
 library, and a flight of stairs leads upstairs. The kitchen is through
 a discreet little door to the west. High above, the night sky is
 visible through a vast skylight.

 Loud, ponderous ticking echoes from the grandfather clock by the
 stairs.

 The hall telephone stands in its niche beneath the stairs like an
 inscrutable modern art sculpture.

>call number
 You find yourself on the line with Frederic Sheppard's bank manager,
 who does not seem particularly happy about being called up at this time
 of the night, especially once you inform him of the circumstances.
 "Yes, I spoke to Mr Sheppard this evening. He called ... must have been
 about 8:20 pm, maybe a little after. I was listening to the wireless at
 the time. Mr Sheppard's been very anxious of late about his financial
 affairs, and I should never have given him my home phone number. Fat
 lot of good I could do him without my files, anyway. Mr Crane could
 probably tell you more."

>ask manager about finances
 You can't see any such thing.

 You can also see a leather briefcase and a tide table here.

>open briefcase
 The briefcase is locked tight. Apparently a healthy amount of expense
 was put into ensuring its security.

>ask deborah about cedric
 Deborah Wolf purses her lips before saying: "Not an honest man, I'm
 afraid. Vain, and a little too much in love with his own cleverness.
 Uncle Fred never recognised any of this, of course."

>examine briefcase
 An expensive-looking leather briefcase, with the initials "C.C." picked
 out in gold on the handle. It appears to be locked.

>take briefcase
 Deborah looks up from her book. "You shouldn't take that, Inspector.
 Cedric's very touchy about his things, and would probably start
 screaming about whether or not you had a warrant."

>ask deborah about ledger
 "The ledger on Uncle Fred's desk? I was the one who marked that up. I'd
 been wondering how Sheppard Trust was doing, so I took a look in Uncle
 Fred's books ... well, it does appear that Cedric Crane has been
 embezzling from the Trust. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. He's a
 little too extravagant to be satisfied with an accountant's salary.
 Anyway, that was a couple of days ago, and I assume that Cedric was
 invited here today because Uncle Fred wanted to confront him about it
 face-to-face."

>go east

 Billiards Room
 The middle of the billiards room is, of course, taken up by the
 billiards table. A bar occupies one corner of the west wall, beside the
 door to the library. The drawing room is through the arch to the north,
 and wide french doors open south onto the terrace. The central hall is
 to the northwest.

 Alexander Wolf and Cedric Crane appear to be deeply engrossed in a game
 of pool.

 One of those old-fashioned schoolroom clocks hangs on the wall.

>cedric, follow me
 There is no reply.

>ask cedric about ledger
 Cedric Crane turns a trifle pale. "You can't prove anything. Mrs Wolf
 is hardly a qualified accountant; she's probably made a mistake."

>ask cedric about alibi
 "I stayed in the dining room after dinner -- to digest the meal
 properly, you know -- must have been about 6:45 pm. Had a cigar.
 Benedict Lamb was there, as I recall, at least until 8:05 pm when I
 decided to go stretch my legs. I met Elinor Lamb in the library, around
 9:05 pm. Rather a surprise to see her without her brother hanging
 around, I thought. Anyway, we were together until 10:20 pm, when I
 decided to go take a walk on the beach. Benedict came down some time
 later, about 11:10 pm, I think, and we talked for a while. We wandered
 over to the rocks at the northwestern end of the beach, and that's when
 we found Frederic Sheppard's body."

>ask alex about wireless
 Alexander Wolf doesn't seem to have much to say about the wireless.

>ask wolf about murder
 "It was supposed to be a sort of working holiday -- for Elinor and me,
 anyway. We're working on a musical production, Twisty Passages, for the
 West End, and Fred was supposed to be backing us financially. Anyway,
 Debbie and I arrived separately: I had some stuff to attend to, and
 arrived only just as everyone was sitting down to dinner. That was
 about 5:30 pm. After dinner, we all wandered off to do our own thing.
 Nothing to it. Next thing you know, Ced comes pounding up from the
 beach bellowing for the police, and now Fred is dead and here you are.
 How are we supposed to get financial backing now?"

 You ask Alexander Wolf about his movements after dinner, to which he
 replies: "I was playing billiards with Ben from 8:15 pm until about
 9:35 pm. Round about 10:00 pm, I joined Debbie in the drawing room. We
 were together until 10:50 pm. Sure, it doesn't cover the whole evening,
 and maybe I might have wandered by the study at some point, but I
 didn't kill the old bastard, if that's what you're thinking."

>go north

 Drawing Room
 The drawing room is a study in contrasts. The walls are very white, and
 there is a modern-looking fireplace in the middle of the north wall;
 grouped around the fireplace is a collection of the most old-fashioned
 drawing room furniture one can imagine. Wide arches go west to the
 central hall and south to the billiards room.

 An oversized carriage clock sits on the fireplace mantle.

 Benedict lounges off to one side, watching you discreetly.

 A painting of Lord Dundreary, outlandish whiskers and all, looks down
 on the room with a vaguely befuddled air.

>ask benedict about alibi
 "Let's see. I was in the dining room with Cedric from 6:45 pm until
 8:05 pm. Later, about 8:15 pm, I wandered into the billiards room and
 played billiards with Alex until 9:35 pm, when I must confess I
 wandered off. Round about 11:10 pm, I decided to head down to the
 beach.  I happened to run into Cedric there, and shortly thereafter we
 spotted Fred lying dead among the rocks. And that was my evening. I'm
 afraid that does leave some awfully large gaps, doesn't it? I suppose
 iron-clad alibis only happen in stories, anyway."

 dinner, about 7:30 pm. We chatted until 8:50 pm. Otherwise, I spent
 most of the evening alone in a quiet corner of the drawing room,
 reading a book. Alex was there as well from about 10:00 pm to 10:50 pm.
 I'm afraid I didn't see anything unusual."

 discreet little door leads south to the kitchen, while a wide arch goes
 southeast to the central hall. Through another arch to the west is the
 conservatory.

 An elaborate clock keeps time on one wall.

 From the west, you hear the soft tinkling of someone muddling around on
 a piano.

>go west

 Conservatory
 Evidently an addition to the house before Frederic Sheppard ever bought
 the place, the Conservatory is only half-heartedly furnished. A few
 sad-looking plants testify to the man's lack of any real interest in
 horticulture. The dining room is back to the east.

 A baby grand piano sits in a corner of the room. Evidently there was
 some indecision as to which definition of "conservatory" to adopt.

 A girl in a wheelchair is parked in front of the piano.

 A large clock hangs from a bracket by the door.

 The girl in the wheelchair, a fragile-looking blonde, looks up as you
 enter, and for a moment you get the impression of some sort of
 "fight-or-flight" instinct kicking in. Then she smiles hesitantly and
 introduces herself as Elinor Lamb. "And you must be the police
 inspector investigating the murder. Oh dear, it's such a terrible
 shock...."

 Elinor absently fingers the keys of the piano, humming a little as she
 does.

 "I spent some time in the library. Debbie was there. That was between
 7:30 pm and 8:50 pm, I think. Cedric came by later, and the two of us
 were together in the library from 9:05 pm to 10:20 pm. I went to the
 conservatory after that to continue with my music. I was alone in the
 conservatory for the rest of the evening after that. I'm sorry, I can't
 think of anything else that might be important."

 "It's just horrible. Ben and I arrived at about 3:30 pm; it's his first
 visit, and I wanted to surprise him with the secret passage behind one
 of the kitchen cabinets. But Deborah and Mr Sheppard were fixing
 dinner, and I never got around to doing that. We were all having such a
 fine time ... it seems impossible to believe that that was just a few
 hours ago, and the most important thing on my mind then was some stupid
 secret passage."

 Elinor absently fingers the keys of the piano, humming a little as she
 does.

 "From the study side, you turn one of the candlesticks on the
 fireplace, and from the kitchen side, you turn one of the hooks in the

 Dining Room
 The dining room still bears traces of the evening's entertainment. A
 discreet little door leads south to the kitchen, while a wide arch goes
 southeast to the central hall. Through another arch to the west is the
 conservatory.

 An elaborate clock keeps time on one wall.

 From the west, you hear the soft tinkling of someone muddling around on
 a piano.

>go south

 Kitchen
 This is the large, well-equipped kitchen of a person who takes his
 entertaining extremely seriously. Counters line all the walls except
 the south, which is taken up by a series of tall cabinets. Discreet
 little doors lead north to the dining room and east to the central
 hall.

 A large kitchen table occupies most of the southern half of the
 kitchen.
 On the kitchen table is a tape measure.

 A simple, round-faced clock on the wall announces that it is now 12:19
 am.

>take tape measure
 Taken.

>open cabinet
 Going through the contents of the cabinets could take all night. Or, in
 the case of the one empty cabinet, about two seconds.

>turn hook
 You jiggle the hooks, and one of them turns in its place. There is a
 click, and then the back wall of the empty cabinet swings open to
 reveal a room beyond.

>go south

 Secret Pantry
 On one side, a kitchen counter with cabinets and a small kitchen sink
 takes up the length of the wall; on the other, narrow stairs lead up
 and down, though the stairs going up are now used as storage shelves
 instead. There are narrow doors to the north and south.

>go south
 The door swings open, and you find yourself passing through a secret
 panel into the study....

 Study
 This is Frederic Sheppard's study, a neat, spacious, modern room
 decorated with old theatrical bills. The library is through a door to
 the east, and french doors open south to the terrace. Cold, damp air
 flows in through the broken window to the west. To the north, a secret
 panel leads into a room beyond.

 The well-ordered study desk stands to one side of the broken window.
 On the study desk are a Faberge egg clock, a black telephone and an
 annotated ledger.

 A corner fireplace occupies, well, a corner.

 You can also see a wireless, an antique fireplace poker and a hunting
 rifle here.

>go south

 West Terrace
 This section of the terrace is essentially a five-foot-wide walkway
 connecting the study to the north with the main part of the terrace, to
 the east.

>go down
 You can't go that way.

>go east

 East Terrace
 The wide, stone-paved terrace overlooks the sea here to the west and
 south, and stairs lead down towards the beach. French doors go north to
 the billiard room and northwest to the library. The terrace itself
 continues to the west, around the corner of the library.

>go down

 Rocky Cliffside Path
 On one side is the steep cliff, punctuated with scrubby bushes clinging
 to crevices in the rock face; on the other side, you are completely
 exposed to the wide expanse of the sea. Stairs go up to the terrace of
 Gull Point, not quite visible from here, and the path itself winds down
 to the rocky beach below.

>go down

 Beach
 It is a quiet, moonlit night. The waters of the lagoon lap gently
 against the sand. Treacherous-looking rocks surround the beach, but a
 narrow path back up to the house has been cut into the cliff face
 behind you, and the rocks to the northwest look just safe enough to
 clamber over.

>go northwest

 Rocks
 If the beach was isolated, this rocky area is even more so. Seawater
 filters in through the rocks all around to fill this little tide pool,
 currently at a low ebb. On one side, the cliff rises sharply up, and
 from here you can just make out the broken window of Frederic
 Sheppard's study. The least treacherous path through the rocks goes
 southeast, back to the beach.

 A sturdy wooden post stands upright in the water, just a short distance
 from the body.

 Frederic Sheppard is sprawled across the rocks, clearly dead.

>examine post
 A bold, white line near the top of the post indicates the high water
 mark. It seems pretty accurate: the wood still seems wet from the last
 high tide, right up to the mark itself.

 Library
 The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen
 of crowded bookshelves occupying the west wall. The rest of the room is
 occupied with modern art. French doors open north to the central hall
 and southeast onto the terrace. The billiards room is through an
 anonymous-looking door to the east.

 Deborah Wolf is curled up in a comfortable armchair, reading a mystery
 novel.

 On closer inspection, one piece of modern art turns out to actually be
 a clock.

 You can also see a leather briefcase and a tide table here.

>ask deb about murder
 "It's difficult to believe that just half a day ago I was chopping
 onions with Uncle Fred in the kitchen. We were talking and laughing,
 and then Cedric Crane and the Lambs showed up, and it was just a
 regular kitchen party." Deborah pauses, then says, "Speaking of the
 kitchen, I should probably tell you: there's a secret way from the
 kitchen into the study. From the study side, you have to turn one of
 the candlesticks on the fireplace mantle to get in, and from the
 kitchen you turn one of the hooks in the empty cabinet. The murderer
 might have gotten in and out that way -- though I rather think that
 everybody here already knows about it."

>ask deb about cedric
 Deborah Wolf purses her lips before saying: "Not an honest man, I'm
 afraid. Vain, and a little too much in love with his own cleverness.
 Uncle Fred never recognised any of this, of course."

 "Poor boy. He tries so hard to seem aloof and indifferent. Actually, I

 Billiards Room
 The middle of the billiards room is, of course, taken up by the
 billiards table. A bar occupies one corner of the west wall, beside the
 door to the library. The drawing room is through the arch to the north,
 and wide french doors open south onto the terrace. The central hall is
 to the northwest.

 Alexander Wolf and Cedric Crane appear to be deeply engrossed in a game
 of pool.

 One of those old-fashioned schoolroom clocks hangs on the wall.

>ask cedric about deborah
 "She's a bit of a priss, if you ask me. Always so very superior."

>ask alexander about deborah
 "Debbie? She's my wife. Are you trying to insinuate something, here?"

>go north

 Drawing Room
 The drawing room is a study in contrasts. The walls are very white, and
 there is a modern-looking fireplace in the middle of the north wall;
 grouped around the fireplace is a collection of the most old-fashioned
 drawing room furniture one can imagine. Wide arches go west to the
 central hall and south to the billiards room.

 An oversized carriage clock sits on the fireplace mantle.

 Benedict lounges off to one side, watching you discreetly.

 A painting of Lord Dundreary, outlandish whiskers and all, looks down
 on the room with a vaguely befuddled air.

>ask ben about deb
 "Deborah's probably the most intelligent woman I've ever met." Benedict
 frowns. "Which makes her marriage to that first class yob, Alexander

                                  by

 FOREWORD

 The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and
 is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be
 highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your
 investigation.

 The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other
 characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant:
 it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about
 something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made
 elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when
 laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you
 will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead.

 Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample
 time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in
 fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at
 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose
 patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of
 his arrival.

 And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits!


 Please press SPACE to continue.








 "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache
 mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield.
 "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought
 up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the
 neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He
 was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house
 about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from
 his study window."

 "Think he might have jumped?"

 "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder
 unless you can find anything to prove otherwise."

 You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says,
 "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
 The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're
 ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?"

 "Got it."

 What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy
 drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late
 it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

 Front Drive
 You are standing on the front drive of Gull Point, residence of noted
 theatrical patron Frederic Sheppard. The house, a rambling old place,
 stands to the south.

 Beside the front doors, the large doorbell button gleams amber in the
 moonlight.

 You can also see a red Triumph Roadster, a blue Austin and a green
 Morris Saloon here.

 moonlight.

>ring doorbell
 You ring the doorbell. Somewhere deep in the recesses of the house,
 pleasant chimes announce your arrival. A moment later, the front door
 swings open.

 The woman who appears in the doorway appears to be about 30, quite
 attractive, with steel-frame glasses. Her manner is cool and aloof; if
 she is at all disturbed by the current situation, she's hiding it well.
 She looks you up and down through clear blue eyes before speaking.
 "Good evening. I take it you must be from the police?"

>no

 She raises an eyebrow. "No? What do you want, then?" Faced with a
 distinct lack of anything else to say, you admit that you are, after
 all, the police. The woman draws her lips into a tight line and says,
 "This is hardly the time to be playing the fool, Inspector. Now please,
 come in."

 Entrance Foyer
 Theatrical bills on the walls give this otherwise sterile entry hall
 the appearance of a theatrical lobby. The front doors are to the north,
 and the central hall is to the south. The cloak room is to the east.

 "My name is Deborah Wolf, by the way. Frederic Sheppard was my uncle.
 My husband and I just arrived today to spend the weekend...." She
 shakes her head. "I'm sorry. It has all been a terrible shock. Please,
 come this way."

 She takes a few steps towards the south and pauses, waiting for you.

>go south
 As she walks with you, Deborah Wolf says, "I should explain that my
 husband is Alexander Wolf, the playwright. He's working on a new stage
 musical called Twisty Passages, with a friend, Elinor Lamb. They were
 going to spend the weekend here, working on it together."

 Just as you pass under the arch into the central hall, the grandfather
 clock by the stairs chimes the midnight hour in doleful tones.
 Wonderful.

 Central Hall
 The central hall is a two-storeyed room, with wide arches north,
 northwest, southeast and east. French doors to the south open into the
 library, and a flight of stairs leads upstairs. The kitchen is through
 a discreet little door to the west. High above, the night sky is
 visible through a vast skylight.

 Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively.

 Loud, ponderous ticking echoes from the grandfather clock by the
 stairs.

 The hall telephone stands in its niche beneath the stairs like an
 inscrutable modern art sculpture.

 As you set your watch and wind it up, a tall, slender young man emerges
 from the drawing room to the east. "Ah," he drawls, "the illustrious
 representative of the Law. How perfectly delightful." He looks down at
 you with a vaguely supercilious manner.

 Deborah Wolf makes the introductions. "Inspector, this is Mr Benedict
 Lamb, Elinor Lamb's brother. As I mentioned, Miss Lamb is collaborating
 with my husband on a stage musical; and Benedict here is acting
 chaperone."

 "Never trust a Wolf alone with a Lamb, I always say."

>ask deb about window
 Benedict Lamb interrupts you, saying, a little sharply, "I think we can
 leave my sister out of any of this, Inspector. She's in a wheelchair;
 her health is practically non-existant. She's quite incapable of any
 acts of violence. Would you agree?"

>no

 Benedict Lamb's grey eyes flash angrily, but Deborah Wolf quickly says,
 "The Inspector hasn't even seen the -- the body yet. You can't honestly
 expect him to make that sort of a judgement without evidence!"

 Benedict merely sneers. Deborah Wolf rolls her eyes and says, "Where is
 Elinor, Ben?"

 "She's in the conservatory, of course." Benedict jerks his head to the
 northwest arch, through which you can see the dining room. "I told her
 she should go to bed and get some rest, but she insists on staying up
 for the investigation." He looks in your direction. "Any time you want
 to speak with her, Inspector, be my guest. Though I assure you it won't
 be necessary."

 Benedict turns on his heel and strides back into the drawing room.
 Deborah heads towards the door to south. "Shall we continue,
 Inspector?"

>yes
 Deborah lowers her voice and says, "Ben's very protective of his
 sister, which is sweet but perhaps a little obsessive, in my opinion.
 Elinor may be wheelchair-bound, but she is nowhere near as delicate as
 he seems to think."

 Library
 The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen
 of crowded bookshelves occupying the west wall. The rest of the room is
 occupied with modern art. French doors open north to the central hall
 and southeast onto the terrace. The billiards room is through an
 anonymous-looking door to the east.

 Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively.

 On closer inspection, one piece of modern art turns out to actually be
 a clock.

 You can also see a tide table here.

 A short, red-headed young man is bent over a leather briefcase as you
 enter the Library. He looks up, startled, as you come in, and hurriedly
 shuts the briefcase. Then he's all smiles and cheerful camaraderie as
 he tosses his briefcase into a corner and comes forward to shake your
 hand.

 "Inspector," says Deborah, "I'd like you to meet Mr Cedric Crane, my
 uncle's former accountant. He was the one -- along with Mr Lamb -- who
 discovered the crime and raised the alarm."

 Cedric Crane pumps your arm with all the excessive energy of a
 campaigning politician. Close up, you realise that he must actually be
 quite a bit older than he appeared at first glance. "A pleasure to make
 your acquaintance," he says expansively, beaming from ear to ear.

>ask cedric about briefcase
 Cedric Crane doesn't seem to have much to say about the leather
 briefcase.

 There is a short burst of music from the west. Cedric Crane says, "We
 left Mr Sheppard's wireless on. Since it was part of the crime scene,
 we didn't want to disturb it."

 "You'd best take the Inspector to the body," says Deborah to Cedric,
 "since you were the one who found him, after all."

 Cedric does not look too happy at this, but turns towards the
 southeastern exit.

>get briefcase
 "Inspector, that briefcase is private." Cedric smiles, but it doesn't
 quite reach his eyes.

 The door to the east suddenly crashes open, revealing a
 broad-shouldered, truculent-looking man holding a billiard cue. He
 glares at you.

 "This is Alexander Wolf," says Deborah, "my husband." Alexander makes a
 brief sweeping gesture by way of greeting, and growls, "let's get this
 over with as quickly as possible, eh?"

 "Alex, you've been drinking."

 Cedric Crane whispers to you, "We'd best head on out, Inspector." He
 quietly exits the room to the southeast.

>se

 East Terrace
 The wide, stone-paved terrace overlooks the sea here to the west and
 south, and stairs lead down towards the beach. French doors go north to
 the billiard room and northwest to the library. The terrace itself
 continues to the west, around the corner of the library.

 You can see Cedric Crane here.

 Cedric Crane nods to you. "Right then. You've met the Wolfs, of course;
 have you met the Lambs? Benedict and Elinor? The five of us would be
 the only people in the house at the moment, other than yourself.
 Anyway, it seems plain that Mr Sheppard must have been killed in his
 study," he says, pointing to a part of the house just west of the
 library, "but Mr Lamb and I found him among the rocks down by the
 beach. Come on, I'll show you."

 Cedric Crane turns and descends the stairs to the cliffside path below.

 From the direction of Library, you hear Alexander Wolf's raised voice,
 and then the slamming of a door.

>go down

 Rocky Cliffside Path
 On one side is the steep cliff, punctuated with scrubby bushes clinging
 to crevices in the rock face; on the other side, you are completely
 exposed to the wide expanse of the sea. Stairs go up to the terrace of
 Gull Point, not quite visible from here, and the path itself winds down
 to the rocky beach below.

 You can see Cedric Crane here.

 Cedric Crane goes down.

>go down

 Beach
 It is a quiet, moonlit night. The waters of the lagoon lap gently
 against the sand. Treacherous-looking rocks surround the beach, but a
 narrow path back up to the house has been cut into the cliff face
 behind you, and the rocks to the northwest look just safe enough to
 clamber over.

 You can see Cedric Crane here.

 Cedric Crane looks around at you and points off to the northwest.
 "There's a small tide pool out that way. That's where Mr Lamb and I
 found the body. I think it must have been a bit after 11:00 pm --
 probably about 11:10 pm -- we're not surrounded by clocks out here as
 we are up in the house. We did take a closer look, of course, to make
 sure we weren't just making a horrible mistake, but otherwise we didn't
 touch anything."

>go northwest
 As you begin picking your way through the rocks, Cedric Crane turns and
 heads back up to the house.

 Rocks
 If the beach was isolated, this rocky area is even more so. Seawater
 filters in through the rocks all around to fill this little tide pool,
 currently at a low ebb. On one side, the cliff rises sharply up, and
 from here you can just make out the broken window of Frederic
 Sheppard's study. The least treacherous path through the rocks goes
 southeast, back to the beach.

 A sturdy wooden post stands upright in the water, just a short distance
 from the body.

 Frederic Sheppard is sprawled across the rocks, clearly dead.

>examine body
 In life, Frederic Sheppard was a big man, still quite robust at the age
 of 60. Right now, he's looking quite battered from the precipitous drop
 from his study window; it is not immediately apparent if it was the
 fall which killed him, or something else. He is also quite thoroughly
 soaked, though he's mostly clear of the water.

>search body
 What's this? There's a bit of a broken branch clutched in his hand. He
 must have pulled it off of one of the scrubby little bushes in the
 cliffside, on his way down.

 Further examination of the body reveals a a number of injuries
 consistent with either a sharp blow with a blunt object, or an
 unfortunate encounter with the side of a cliff. You're not quite enough
 of a forensics expert to distinguish between the two.

>get branch
 You already have that.

>examine window
 You can't make out any details from here.

>examine post

 mark. It seems pretty accurate: the wood still seems wet from the last
 high tide, right up to the mark itself.

 Study
 This is Frederic Sheppard's study, a neat, spacious, modern room
 decorated with old theatrical bills. The library is through a door to
 the east, and french doors open south to the terrace. Cold, damp air
 flows in through the broken window to the west.

 The well-ordered study desk stands to one side of the broken window.
 On the study desk are a Faberge egg clock, a black telephone, a scrap
 of paper and an annotated ledger.

 A corner fireplace occupies, well, a corner.

 You can also see a wireless, an antique fireplace poker and a hunting
 rifle here.

 Over the wireless comes an advertisement for the Higgins School of
 Elocution.

>examine scrap of paper
 Odd that this scrap of paper would be found sitting on Frederic
 Sheppard's pristine study desk, but perhaps he never got around to
 clearing it away. A telephone number has been hastily scrawled across
 it.

 From the wireless comes the soft hiss of static and the dramatic
 tension of a late-night radio show.

>call number
 You're not messing with the dead man's telephone any more than you can
 help. A fancy country house like this ought to have another telephone
 that you can use, probably out in the hall.

 tension of a late-night radio show.

 frankly, the Chief Inspector would really prefer to spare everyone the
 inky fingers. So right now, the only useful set of prints you're likely
 to have are Frederic Sheppard's ... and this being his home, they're on
 absolutely everything.

>examine window
 It doesn't look as though it was ever particularly sturdy; positioned
 as it is over a steep drop into the sea, it probably never needed to
 be. The casement opens outwards; the panes are cracked but otherwise
 intact. The latch, a rather flimsy affair, is twisted half off the
 frame. The sill is quite high off the floor: it seems highly unlikely
 that anyone might have fallen through it by accident.

>look through window
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine bushes
 By the light of the moon, you can make out a few stunted, twisted
 bushes clinging desperately to the rocks of the cliff.

>examine ledger
 This ledger details the investments and various business dealings of
 Frederic Sheppard and the Sheppard Trust. While the numbers seem to
 indicate a perfectly healthy state of affairs, someone has gone through
 this ledger with a red pen, making annotations in the margin, and
 pointing out subtle discrepancies. While he is far from ruined,
 Frederic Sheppard is clearly not quite as well-off as everyone seems to
 think, nor is the Sheppard Trust quite so healthy. The annotations
 culminate in a note to "Please speak to Cedric" written across the
 final page and underlined twice.

>examine clock
 An ostentatious antique: a clock in the shape of a gold easter egg,
 with all manner of baroque designs picked out over its surface.

>examine rifle
 It's fancy enough to be purely decorative, but it is after all a
 working firearm. A careful inspection shows it to be loaded.

 Library
 The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen

 occupied with modern art. French doors open north to the central hall
 and southeast onto the terrace. The billiards room is through an
 anonymous-looking door to the east.

 Deborah Wolf is curled up in a comfortable armchair, reading a mystery
 novel.

 On closer inspection, one piece of modern art turns out to actually be

 You can also see a leather briefcase and a tide table here.

>examine tide table
 Your eye goes straight for the present date. It seems the last high

 This poker hails from a time when fireplaces were the sole source of

 Well, perhaps that's an exaggeration, but you certainly wouldn't want

 Loud, ponderous ticking echoes from the grandfather clock by the

 The hall telephone stands in its niche beneath the stairs like an

 You find yourself on the line with Frederic Sheppard's bank manager,
 who does not seem particularly happy about being called up at this time
 of the night, especially once you inform him of the circumstances.
 "Yes, I spoke to Mr Sheppard this evening. He called ... must have been
 about 8:20 pm, maybe a little after. I was listening to the wireless at
 the time. Mr Sheppard's been very anxious of late about his financial

 "The ledger on Uncle Fred's desk? I was the one who marked that up. I'd
 been wondering how Sheppard Trust was doing, so I took a look in Uncle
 Fred's books ... well, it does appear that Cedric Crane has been
 embezzling from the Trust. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. He's a
 little too extravagant to be satisfied with an accountant's salary.
 Anyway, that was a couple of days ago, and I assume that Cedric was
 invited here today because Uncle Fred wanted to confront him about it
 face-to-face."

 Benedict Lamb was there, as I recall, at least until 8:05 pm when I

 9:05 pm. Rather a surprise to see her without her brother hanging
 around, I thought. Anyway, we were together until 10:20 pm, when I
 decided to go take a walk on the beach. Benedict came down some time
 later, about 11:10 pm, I think, and we talked for a while. We wandered

 wandered off. Round about 11:10 pm, I decided to head down to the
 beach.  I happened to run into Cedric there, and shortly thereafter we
 spotted Fred lying dead among the rocks. And that was my evening. I'm
 afraid that does leave some awfully large gaps, doesn't it? I suppose
 iron-clad alibis only happen in stories, anyway."

 Evidently an addition to the house before Frederic Sheppard ever bought

 A baby grand piano sits in a corner of the room. Evidently there was

 A girl in a wheelchair is parked in front of the piano.

 A large clock hangs from a bracket by the door.

 The girl in the wheelchair, a fragile-looking blonde, looks up as you
 enter, and for a moment you get the impression of some sort of
 "fight-or-flight" instinct kicking in. Then she smiles hesitantly and
 introduces herself as Elinor Lamb. "And you must be the police

 Rocks
 If the beach was isolated, this rocky area is even more so. Seawater
 filters in through the rocks all around to fill this little tide pool,
 currently at a low ebb. On one side, the cliff rises sharply up, and

 Sheppard's study. The least treacherous path through the rocks goes

 Billiards Room
 The middle of the billiards room is, of course, taken up by the

 FOREWORD

 The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and
 is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be
 highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your
 investigation.

 The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other
 characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant:
 it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about
 something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made
 elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when
 laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you
 will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead.

 Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample
 time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in
 fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at
 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose
 patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of
 his arrival.

 And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits!


 Please press SPACE to continue.








 "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache
 mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield.
 "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought
 up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the
 neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He
 was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house
 about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from
 his study window."

 "Think he might have jumped?"

 "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder
 unless you can find anything to prove otherwise."

 You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says,
 "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
 The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're
 ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?"

 "Got it."

 What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy
 drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late
 it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

 Front Drive
 You are standing on the front drive of Gull Point, residence of noted
 theatrical patron Frederic Sheppard. The house, a rambling old place,
 stands to the south.

 Beside the front doors, the large doorbell button gleams amber in the
 moonlight.

 You can also see a red Triumph Roadster, a blue Austin and a green
 Morris Saloon here.

 Conservatory
 Evidently an addition to the house before Frederic Sheppard ever bought
 the place, the Conservatory is only half-heartedly furnished. A few
 sad-looking plants testify to the man's lack of any real interest in
 horticulture. The dining room is back to the east.

 A baby grand piano sits in a corner of the room. Evidently there was
 some indecision as to which definition of "conservatory" to adopt.

 Elinor Lamb is parked in front of the piano.

 A large clock hangs from a bracket by the door.

 Elinor absently fingers the keys of the piano, humming a little as she
 does.

>go east

 Dining Room
 The dining room still bears traces of the evening's entertainment. A
 discreet little door leads south to the kitchen, while a wide arch goes
 southeast to the central hall. Through another arch to the west is the
 conservatory.

 An elaborate clock keeps time on one wall.

 Central Hall
 The central hall is a two-storeyed room, with wide arches north,
 northwest, southeast and east. French doors to the south open into the
 library, and a flight of stairs leads upstairs. The kitchen is through
 a discreet little door to the west. High above, the night sky is

 "I actually arrived earlier than expected: Mr Sheppard was still fixing
 dinner when I came in the door, and I went to join him. I suppose I
 should have gone home straight after dinner, but that always seems a
 little rude. And besides," he adds with a wink, "Mr Sheppard keeps a
 beautifully well-stocked bar. Anyway, I wound up heading down to the
 beach late in the evening for some fresh air and alone time. I'd
 already been there rather a while when Benedict Lamb came down from the
 house, and we happened to wander close enough to the tidal pool at the
 base of the cliff to notice Fred lying there dead, and that's when we
 raised the alarm." He shrugs his shoulders and continues, "I wish I'd
 been paying more attention. For all I know, whatever happened could
 have happened while I was right there, strolling about on the sand."

>ask cedric about Twisty Passages
 "Currently, the main draw on the Sheppard Trust resources would be this
 stage musical production ... Twisty Passages, I think it's called." He
 glances around and lowers his voice. "I shouldn't be saying this, but
 then this is rather a serious business. The others will probably tell
 you that Mr Wolf was writing the script and Miss Lamb the music, with
 Mr Sheppard supplying the funds ... but musical productions generally
 run into greater costs than non-musical stage plays. The entire project
 was sliding deep into debt, and Mr Sheppard was thinking about cutting
 his losses. He let slip about it while we were all in the kitchen,
 before dinner, and there was a tremendous uproar."

 Library
 The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen
 of crowded bookshelves occupying the west wall. The rest of the room is
 occupied with modern art. French doors open north to the central hall
 and southeast onto the terrace. The billiards room is through an
 anonymous-looking door to the east.

 Deborah Wolf is curled up in a comfortable armchair, reading a mystery
 novel.

 On closer inspection, one piece of modern art turns out to actually be
 a clock.

 You can also see a leather briefcase and a tide table here.

>ask deb about branch
 Deborah Wolf doesn't seem to have much to say about the broken branch.

>ask deb about murder
 "It's difficult to believe that just half a day ago I was chopping
 onions with Uncle Fred in the kitchen. We were talking and laughing,
 and then Cedric Crane and the Lambs showed up, and it was just a
 regular kitchen party." Deborah pauses, then says, "Speaking of the
 kitchen, I should probably tell you: there's a secret way from the
 kitchen into the study. From the study side, you have to turn one of
 the candlesticks on the fireplace mantle to get in, and from the
 kitchen you turn one of the hooks in the empty cabinet. The murderer
 might have gotten in and out that way -- though I rather think that
 everybody here already knows about it."

>ask deb about twisty passages
 "Twisty Passages is one of Alex's better scripts, if I do say so
 myself. Elinor's providing the music, and Uncle Fred's money was
 supposed to actually get it onto the stage. Investing in the theatre
 was something of a hobby with Uncle Fred, you know: he didn't always
 get a good return, but he did love feeling like a great patron of the
 arts. Naturally, when Alex and Elinor started talking about producing
 something, I went straight to Uncle Fred and arranged it all with him."

 The drawing room is a study in contrasts. The walls are very white, and
 there is a modern-looking fireplace in the middle of the north wall;
 grouped around the fireplace is a collection of the most old-fashioned

 central hall and south to the billiards room.

 An oversized carriage clock sits on the fireplace mantle.

 Benedict lounges off to one side, watching you discreetly.

 A painting of Lord Dundreary, outlandish whiskers and all, looks down
 on the room with a vaguely befuddled air.

>ask ben about musical
 "I don't pretend to pay it all too much attention. I know it's called
 Twisty Passages and that Frederic Sheppard was supposed to finance it.
 My sister Elinor, who is writing the music for it, could probably tell
 you more; as could Alex, who is writing the script."

>ask ben about funding
 "So you heard that Fred Sheppard was cutting the funding. Hmph. Elinor
 nearly had a relapse."

>ask ben about elinor
 "My sister has had a very unfortunate life: first the accident that put
 her in the wheelchair, then her ... her health issues, and now this.
 She can't possibly have anything to do with this, believe me. As a
 matter of fact, I happen to have her latest medical report in one of my
 coat pockets. Go ahead and see for yourself; my coat's the green
 zimarra in the cloak room."

>ask ben about health issues
 "Elinor's always been rather delicate. Then there was the accident that
 put her in a wheelchair, and when that happened they discovered she was

 following note: "Mr Lamb, your sister has not much longer to live.
 While it is true that the completion of this magnum opus you describe
 will be a very great thing by which to remember your sister after she
 is gone, and that this is what she most certainly wants, is not her
 comfort now, while she is alive, more important? Why must you insist on

 All right. Fred told me a couple of days back that he was thinking of

 it, but I figured I'd see what my options were. So I made an
 appointment to find out exactly what sort of control Fred had over the
 Sheppard Trust. I waited all afternoon and the bastards still didn't
 have time for me. At least they left me a copy of Zack Sheppard's will.
 Here, I haven't looked at it yet, thanks to all this mess, but I'm
 guessing you'll want a look at it."

 The main part of the will concerns the Sheppard Trust, the main purpose

 purpose of which is to provide Mr Zachary Sheppard's heirs with a
 steady income. Frederic Sheppard is named as a manager of the Trust.
 Thanks to some clumsiness in the wording, it seems that the Trust is to
 exist only for the duration of Frederic Sheppard's life, after which
 the capital is to be divided among various charities. Stapled to the
 back of the document is a list of figures detailing large chunks of
 money being shifted out of the Trust and into what appears to be
 Deborah Wolf's bank account.

 the Trust lived on. Of course, now that Uncle Fred's gone ... I wish we

 Trust. The Trust's supposed to die with Mr Sheppard, leaving Mrs Wolf
 with nothing, so the two of them decided to engage in a spot of
 embezzling and shift the money into her bank account. It was rather
 slow going, but give them a couple more years, and I think they might
 even have succeeded." He shrugs. "Well, it's a victimless crime. Can it
 still be embezzling if you're stealing from yourself, and if you let
 all the lawyers and accountants know what you're up to? I'm not a
 lawyer, so I don't know: I just like calling it that."

 Entrance Foyer
 Theatrical bills on the walls give this otherwise sterile entry hall
 the appearance of a theatrical lobby. The front doors are to the north,
 and the central hall is to the south. The cloak room is to the east.

 The door swings open, admitting Chief Inspector Duffy. He looks more
 put-upon than ever. "I hope you have something for me, Inspector. I
 want to be home and in bed some reasonable amount of time before having
 to get up and head back to the station."

 He sighs. "At the moment, as far as I know, everybody had the means and
 opportunity, and nobody had any motive. Tell me about anything you've
 found that will change this."

 FOREWORD

 The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and
 is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be
 highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your
 investigation.

 The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other
 characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant:
 it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about
 something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made
 elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when
 laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you
 will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead.

 Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample
 time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in
 fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at
 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose
 patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of
 his arrival.

 And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits!

 "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache
 mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield.
 "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought
 up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the
 neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He
 was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house
 about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from
 his study window."

 "Think he might have jumped?"

 "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder
 unless you can find anything to prove otherwise."

 You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says,
 "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
 The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're
 ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?"

 "Got it."

 What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy
 drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late
 it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

 Front Drive
 You are standing on the front drive of Gull Point, residence of noted
 theatrical patron Frederic Sheppard. The house, a rambling old place,
 stands to the south.

 Beside the front doors, the large doorbell button gleams amber in the
 moonlight.

 You can also see a red Triumph Roadster, a blue Austin and a green
 Morris Saloon here.

 "That's a very serious accusation on Mrs Wolf's part. If Mr Crane were

 have been a very good reason to want him dead.

>tell chief about will
 Chief Inspector Duffy nods thoughtfully as you fill him in on what
 you've learnt so far.

 "Interesting. So Mrs Wolf knew the provisions of her father's will,
 and, what is more, she knew she had a lot to lose by her uncle dying
 when he did. I can't say I can picture her as our murderess, in that
 case."

>tell chief about branch
 Chief Inspector Duffy nods thoughtfully as you fill him in on what
 you've learnt so far.

 Chief Inspector Duffy nods thoughtfully as you fill him in on what

>tell chief about phone call
 Chief Inspector Duffy nods thoughtfully as you fill him in on what

 "Financial worries? That's rather vague ... but at least we know Mr
 Sheppard was still alive at 8:20 pm."

>tell chief about window
 Chief Inspector Duffy nods thoughtfully as you fill him in on what
 you've learnt so far.

 When you finish, he strokes his moustache and says, "I imagine that
 pushing a full-grown man up against a window, and then through it when
 it breaks open, would entail quite a bit of physical exertion --
 especially given the height of the window sill."

>tell chief about ben's alibi

>tell chief about elinor

 Inspector.

>tell chief about measurements
 This provokes no reaction.

>tell chief about tide table
 Chief Inspector Duffy nods thoughtfully as you fill him in on what
 you've learnt so far.

>tell chief about body position
 Chief Inspector Duffy nods thoughtfully as you fill him in on what
 you've learnt so far.

 Chief Inspector Duffy reaches for his notebook and begins jotting down
 calculations. "That suggests that the murder probably occurred some
 time before 9:15 pm ... give it another ten minutes; I'd say 9:25 pm
 would be the very latest that the body could have gone into the water."

 Chief Inspector Duffy compares his notes. "Well, that clears two of our
 suspects, at least: Benedict Lamb and Alexander Wolf appear to have
 alibis for the small window of opportunity in between Frederic
 Sheppard's telephone call, when he was last known to be alive, and the
 time at which he must have gone into the water. And if they're
 eliminated, then that leaves just one possibility among our suspects.
 Which means, I think, that we can make an arrest and go home."

 Central Hall
 The central hall is a two-storeyed room, with wide arches north,
 northwest, southeast and east. French doors to the south open into the
 library, and a flight of stairs leads upstairs. The kitchen is through
 a discreet little door to the west. High above, the night sky is
 visible through a vast skylight.

 Loud, ponderous ticking echoes from the grandfather clock by the
 stairs.

 The hall telephone stands in its niche beneath the stairs like an
 inscrutable modern art sculpture.

 Billiards Room
 The middle of the billiards room is, of course, taken up by the
 billiards table. A bar occupies one corner of the west wall, beside the
 door to the library. The drawing room is through the arch to the north,
 and wide french doors open south onto the terrace. The central hall is
 to the northwest.

 Alexander Wolf and Cedric Crane appear to be deeply engrossed in a game
 of pool.

 One of those old-fashioned schoolroom clocks hangs on the wall.

 "Very well," says Chief Inspector Duffy. "Let's get on with it...

 Cedric Crane is still playing pool with Alexander Wolf when you find
 him, leaning across the table for a difficult shot. He looks up as you
 approach. "I was wondering when you'd come for me," he says.

 You read out the charges and are about to cuff him when Alexander
 suddenly roars, "Murder AND embezzlement? You bastard! You're the
 reason Fred wanted to bail on us!" Alexander vaults over the table -- a
 surprising feat for a man his size -- and it is all you and Chief
 Inspector Duffy can do to keep him from tearing Cedric Crane apart
 right there.

 The commotion draws the attention of all the other former suspects.
 Deborah, looking triumphant in the doorway of the library, says, "I
 told you he was a dishonest man."

 Cedric glares at her. "Damn you. It's your own fault -- if you hadn't
 tipped the old man off, we might have gone on for years. As it was,
 engineering this little farce was the last chance I had, given the
 short notice. Shoving the old bastard out the window was child's play;
 and Mr Lamb played right into my hands when he suggested we walk out
 towards the rocks.... I would have gotten rid of that confounded
 ledger, too, but I couldn't find it. I suppose you had it all along and
 left it lying conveniently on Mr Sheppard's desk for the police to
 find."

 Deborah says, "Of course I did. When I saw the state of the study, I
 guessed what had happened, and took steps accordingly." She turns to
 you. "Take him away, Inspector. I hope you put him away for a very,
 very long time."
