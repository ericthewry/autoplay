 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.

 To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick
 building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands
 invitingly open.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you.

 Okay, what do you want to do now?
>examine signpost

 Post Office
 This is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with
 small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs
 along the entire length of the room.

 Your boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other
 people's postcards.

 Mr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. "Where have you been?"
 he barks angrily. "Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere
 for you!"

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 1 out of 100.)

 What next?
>crisp examine
 He's wearing a regulation Post Office uniform, which does little to
 hide his ugly face.

 Mr. Crisp reaches under the service counter and pulls out a mysterious
 envelope. "We just got this Special Delivery," he snarls, tossing it
 onto the service counter. "I want you to drop it off right away. That
 means NOW!"

 What next?
>eat crisp
 It seems unlikely that Mr. Crisp would agree with you.

 Mr. Crisp drums his fingers on the service counter impatiently. "Get
 moving! The Magick Shoppe closes at five o'clock!"

 What next?
>look at time
 You can't see any time here!

 What next?
>envelope get
 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 6 out of

 Mr. Crisp yells, "Scram!"

 (You won't see the "What next?" prompt any more.)

 As you leave the Post Office, somebody slams and locks the door behind
 you.

 You'd tumble down the hill if you went that way.

>go east
 Outside Cottage
 You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the town librarian. The road
 turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post
 Office Hill.

 As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle
 you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street,
 yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth.

 You can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps.

 Outside Cottage
 You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the town librarian. The road
 turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post

 You can hear the poodle's sharp little teeth snapping as it nips your
 heels.

>go west
 The cemetery is a fearful place. Are you sure you want to go in there?

>yes

 You have been warned.

 Creepy Corner
 You're in a creepy corner of the Festeron Cemetery, surrounded by
 silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane
 wanders north.

>examine tombstones
 The lettering is too faded to read clearly.

>listen
 At the moment, you hear nothing special.

>go north
 Spooky Copse
 A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really
 spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.

 There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected
 next to it.

 An old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree.

 The gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach.

>gravedigger, hello
 The gravedigger doesn't respond. He seems to be a bit hard of hearing.

>examine copse
 (This story doesn't know the word "copse.")

>examine willow
 (Presumably, you mean the willow tree.)
 The droopy boughs sway eerily in the breeze.

 The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding. "That's
 a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says. "Let's
 have a look at it."

>look in grave
 It's six feet deep and freshly dug. You can see an old bone inside.

 "Sure would like to get a closer look at that mysterious envelope."

>give envelope
 (to the gravedigger)
 The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope. "Hmm,"
 he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried that old
 woman years ago."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you
 soon."

 The old man ambles away to the west.

>undo
 (What do you want to undo?)

>examine bone
 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

>examine bone
 You see nothing interesting about the old bone.

>take bone
 You can't reach the old bone from here. The open grave is too deep.

>go west
 Twilight Glen
 The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make
 out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the
 tombstones winds off to the east.

 There must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their
 umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.

 The gravedigger is locking the iron gate from the outside as you
 approach. "Keep out of the cemetery after Dark," he tells you with a
 sly wink.

 You can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.

>examine umbrella
 The handle of the closed umbrella is carved like a parrot's head.

>take umbrella
 Taken.

 Rotary South
 This is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south,
 towards Post Office Hill.

 The Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic
 artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner.

 Miss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you
 approach. "Just the person I was looking for!" she exclaims, smiling
 brightly.

>examine miss voss
 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

>look at voss
 She's holding a purse and an armful of books.

 Miss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her
 purse. "Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp,"
 she coos, holding the note out to you. "I'd be ever so much obliged."

>ask voss about poodle
 "I'm in a hurry. Let's talk later," she replies.

 You're on the eastern side of the Festeron Rotary. A street branches
 off to the east, towards the bay.

 On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes
 and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance,
 and a marquee announces the current feature.

 hour!)

 Pleasure Wharf
 You're standing near the entrance to the Pleasure Wharf, the town's
 most popular tourist attraction. The Wharf extends eastward into
 Festeron Bay, and a tidal beach curves north along the shore.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

>look at mailbox
 The big mailbox seems ordinary enough.

>open mailbox
 Okay, the big mailbox is now open.

>look in mailbox
 You can see nothing extraordinary in the big mailbox.

 The lid of the big mailbox squeaks and snaps shut with a clang.

>read sign
 The neon sign says, "VIDEO GAMES."

>enter building
 Video Arcade
 This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op
 video games. The machines are all deserted and quiet, except for one in
 the corner that emits a feeble "wokka-wokka" sound.

 A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token."

>look at game
 The game machine is equipped with a video screen, a joystick, a big red
 button and a narrow slot for tokens. A lurid logo ("LEATHER GODDESSES
 OF PHOBOS!") is painted on the side.

>look in slot
 It's too dark to see!

>go east
 Wharf's End
 The sea-worn planks of the Festeron Pleasure Wharf end abruptly a few
 feet to the east. You're surrounded by the blue, sparkling waters of
 Festeron Bay.

 Apparently a careless fisherman has just left the wharf, for lying on
 the planks is a little seahorse, its gills moving in and out with its
 dying gasps.

 The seahorse looks at you with moist, frightened eyes.

>take seahorse
 Taken.

 The seahorse opens and closes its little mouth pathetically.

>put it in ocean
 Splash!

 The seahorse floats without moving for a few anxious moments. Then it
 springs suddenly to life, circling and splashing joyfully in the waves.
 Before it swims away it looks up at you with an unmistakable expression
 of gratitude.

>examine water
 The waters of the bay twinkle merrily in the sunlight.

>enter water
 You'd probably drown in the bay if you went that way.

 back home.

 an hour!)

 A tiny voice in the conch shell that sounds just like your mean old
 boss, Mr. Crisp, screams, "Don't just stand there! DELIVER!"

>go north
 Lighthouse
 This is where the river empties into Festeron Bay. A beach follows the
 shore of the bay to the south, and a path leads west along the
 riverbank.

 A miniature lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands blinking on the
 shore nearby.

 Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through
 half-closed eyelids.

>watch pelican
 It's a fat old bird with a droopy beak and half-closed eyes.

>pelican, hello
 The pelican pays no attention to you.

>get pelican
 The pelican nips you with its beak. Ouch!

 Festeron River. A dense, impenetrable forest borders the south edge of
 the path.

 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post
 Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of
 clouds.

 The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the
 distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments,
 checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.

 A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted
 shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale.
 A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick
 Shoppe."

 "There you are, dummy!"

 You wince as Mr. Crisp strides into view and grabs you by the front of
 your uniform.

 "You good-for-nothing chowderbrain!" he bellows in your face. "I wanted
 you to deliver that envelope BEFORE five o'clock! Now the Magick Shoppe
 is closed... and you're FIRED!"








 Looks like the story's over. But don't despair! Interactive fiction
 lets you learn from your mistakes.

 Your score is 14 points out of 100, in 120 moves.

 Time passes.

 Miss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her
 purse. "Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp,"
 she coos, holding the note out to you. "I'd be ever so much obliged."

 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post
 Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of
 clouds.

 The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the
 distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments,
 checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.

 A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted
 shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale.
 A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick
 Shoppe."

>SAVE
>cf4

>enter
 The Magick Shoppe door is closed.

>open door
 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.

>enter
 Magick Shoppe
 You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.

 Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and
 mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene
 jokes and naughty birthday cards.

 In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented
 with a frowning crescent moon and other celestial symbols.

 The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of
 the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.

 A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed
 bell tinkles merrily.

 "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain.

>read jokes
 Tsk, tsk, tsk!

 The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.

>examine clock
 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

>examine clock
 The staring grandfather clock says it's 3:42 pm.

 The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.

 The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin,
 pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature
 in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever
 seen.

 You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice.
 "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late
 in the day."

 The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.

>SAVE
>cf5
 Enter saved game to store: Okay, done.

>listen
 At the moment, you hear nothing extraordinary.

 "Hope you have some mail for me," the old woman says eagerly.

>listen to clock
 At the moment, the grandfather clock makes no sound.

 "It's fun to get a surprise letter."

>read clock
 The grinning grandfather clock is stopped at 3:42 pm.

 "I hoped you might have some mail to give me."

>give envelope to woman
 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 19 out of
 100.)

 The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you.
 "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she
 murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again."

 She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and
 hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she
 pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

>open envelope
 (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer
 package.)

 Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.

 "Don't be bashful. Read the letter to me."

>open envelope
 It's already open.

 "Read the letter to me, please."

>read it
 (to the old woman)
 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 20 out of
 100.)

 The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of
 anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.

 "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly
 around the room, deep in thought.

 "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to
 herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to
 conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and
 family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice
 breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion."

 Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and
 crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard
 Wishbringer alone."

>ask her about wishbringer
 "That's a long story," sighs the old woman wistfully. "Maybe later."

 The old woman makes an effort to compose herself.

 "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a
 shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take
 this little trinket anyway."

 The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.

>see can
 It's a round metal can with a closed lid, illustrated with a
 tasty-looking assortment of mixed nuts.

 "Take this gift," says the old woman, holding a metal can out to you.

>take can
 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 23 out of
 100.)

 "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost
 hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town."

>ask woman about cemetery
 "Not now," sighs the old woman wistfully. "Some other time, perhaps."

 The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A
 concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words
 slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as
 night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right
 HERE."

 The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The
 light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.

>open can
 Your body seems unwilling to respond.

 The old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.

 "The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the
 place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts
 and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely
 on legends to instruct you in its mysteries."

 As she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the
 Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.

 "Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.

 "Her name is Chaos."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.








 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward.

 The surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of
 evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely
 hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce
 the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...

 ... an island with a tower on it.

 There's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline
 is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare,
 the clearer and more frightening it becomes.

 The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.

>examine tower
 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

>look at tower
 Its lonely outline fills you with dread.

>open can
 Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It
 squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and
 slithers out of sight.

 vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise

 the river.

 A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the

 closed gate.

 Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less
 original story would probably refer to it as a troll.

>troll, hello
 The troll wails something awful and ignores you.

>look at troll
 The troll is staring back at you stupidly.

 Yow! As he opens the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It squirms

 slithers out of sight.

 The metal can clatters to the ground.

 A scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across
 the covered bridge.

 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you
 can see Witchville Village nestled among the trees. A narrow trail

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and
 majestic oak tree.

 A horseshoe is lying in the grass near the stump.

>stump

 The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic
 leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol!

 You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an
 especially tall Boot. "What have we here?" he hisses. "Out after
 curfew? Tsk, tsk, tsk. I wonder what Sgt. MacGuffin will say about
 this."

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor.
 "What's this?" he demands impatiently.

 "A nightcrawler," hisses the Tall Boot, giving you a vicious little
 kick. "Outside after curfew. Shall I feed it to the sharks?"

 Sgt. MacGuffin shakes his head. "Later. The Tower wants all prisoners
 held for questioning." He turns back to his work. "Cell Three."

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel

 Grue's Nest
 You have stumbled into the nesting place of a family of grues.
 Congratulations. Few indeed are the adventurers who have entered a
 grue's nest and lived as long as you have.

 Everything is littered with rusty swords of elvish workmanship, piles
 of bones and other debris. A closed refrigerator stands in one corner
 of the nest, and something... a small, dangerous-looking little
 beast... is curled up in the other corner.

 The only exit is to the west. Hope you survive long enough to use it.

 Snoring fitfully, the little beast turns away from the light of the
 small stone and faces the wall.

>put blanket on grue
 Okay, the little beast is now covered with the thick blanket.

 The creature stirs restlessly for an anxious moment. Then it settles
 into the comfortable darkness of the thick blanket, sighs gently and
 lies still.

 Lookout Hill
 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you
 can see Witchville Village nestled among the trees. A narrow trail
 winds down the north side of the hill, towards the river.

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and
 majestic oak tree. An opening in the stump leads down into darkness.

 A rusty "click!" draws your eyes to the iron gate. You watch as it
 slowly creaks open, all by itself!

 The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic
 leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol!

 You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an
 especially tall Boot. "What have we here?" he hisses. "Out after
 curfew? Tsk, tsk, tsk. I wonder what Sgt. MacGuffin will say about
 this."

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor.
 "What's this?" he demands impatiently.

 "A nightcrawler," hisses the Tall Boot, giving you a vicious little
 kick. "Outside after curfew. Shall I feed it to the sharks?"

 Sgt. MacGuffin shakes his head. "Later. The Tower wants all prisoners
 held for questioning." He turns back to his work. "Cell Three."

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and
 majestic oak tree. An opening in the stump leads down into darkness.

 You're standing in the lobby of the movie theater. A short corridor

 The gravedigger is standing near the corridor, a large cardboard carton
 at his feet.

 The open carton is marked, "Free 3D Movie Glasses Here!"

 No doubt about it. He's the town gravedigger, looking stiff and
 uncomfortable in his new usher's uniform.

 You're standing near the remains of the Pleasure Wharf. The Wharf
 extends eastward into Witchville Bay.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 A voice behind you growls, "Feed me. I'm HUNGRY!" You turn to face the
 sound, but there's nobody here except you.

>see big mailbox
 The big mailbox seems ordinary enough. Or does it?

 You watch with astonishment as the lid of the big mailbox slowly opens
 by itself, then snaps shut with a clang.

 The little mailbox "clump-clumps" into view and snaps a greeting.

>see little mailbox
 It's the strangest little mailbox you've ever seen.

 The lid of the big mailbox opens again. "Mail!"

 The two mailboxes freeze at the sight of one another.

 The little mailbox snarls and stands protectively by your side. The big
 mailbox emits a frightful growl and throws its lid wide open,
 displaying rows of sharp little teeth. A crowd of postal meters and
 stamp dispensers gathers as the metal warriors circle each other with
 tense, snapping lids.

 With a sudden rush, the little mailbox throws itself at the big mailbox
 and clamps onto its forefoot. The big mailbox roars with anger, bites
 the little mailbox viciously and tries in vain to shake it off. You
 stare in wonder as the fighting boxes swell to twice their normal size,
 then four times larger, eight times!

 The big mailbox frees itself with a savage twist and bends to finish
 its foe. The little mailbox dodges, grips the descending lid and holds
 on for dear life. Locked in mortal combat, the giant boxes roll over
 and over, shaking the earth with the thunder of battle.

 The scene disappears under a cloud of dust. You hear a terrible scream
 of agony, then an even more terrible silence. When the air clears, the
 boxes and spectators are gone.

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor. His

 Lookout Hill
 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you
 can see Witchville Village nestled among the trees. A narrow trail
 winds down the north side of the hill, towards the river.

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and
 majestic oak tree. An opening in the stump leads down into darkness.

 Circling like sharks, they stroke your face with ghostly fingers and

 Spooky Copse
 A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really
 spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.

 There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected

 Giggling with mischievous Glee, the eldritch vapors clutch your legs
 and cover your eyes with their luminous hands. The ground falls away
 beneath your feet as the foggy fiends lift you high above the treetops,
 scatter your possessions and carry you screaming into the night.

 Police Station
 You're in the front office of the Witchville Police Station. The room
 is lined with dimly-lit jail cells. Occasional wails of anguish suggest
 that many of the cells are occupied.

 Sgt. MacGuffin, Witchville's finest, is glaring down at you from behind
 an intimidatingly high desk. You can see a wanted poster taped to the
 wall.

 "You again!" cries Sgt. MacGuffin as you enter. Moments later you're
 pinned to the floor by a dozen gigantic Boots. An especially tall Boot
 strides into the lobby, curls its leather tongue and leaves an ugly
 toeprint on your nice, clean clothes.

 Sgt. MacGuffin shows you his sharp little teeth. "Well, well. If it
 isn't the disappearing mail clerk." You open your mouth to reply, but a
 vicious little kick changes your mind. "The Tower wants a chat with
 this troublemaker."

 "The sharks are getting restless," remarks the Tall Boot hopefully.

 Sgt. MacGuffin smirks. "So is the Evil One."

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel
 door and stone walls offer little hope for escape.

 The only furnishing is a hard bunk against the wall.

 This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville

 A dead branch is lying on the ground.

 The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic
 leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol again!

 You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an
 especially tall Boot. "What!" he cries. "I thought you were locked up
 with Sgt. MacGuffin. Tsk, tsk."

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor. His
 eyes narrow when he sees you. "Well, well. If it isn't the disappearing

 Misty Island
 You're standing on a fog-shrouded beach. Sheer cliff walls rise to the

 Throne Room
 You're standing in a long, high-ceilinged chamber. Hundreds of
 platypuses are milling about with teacups in their paws, their faces
 illuminated by a roaring fireplace.

 At the far end of the chamber stands a mighty throne. It's occupied by
 a snow-white platypus with a gold crown on its head and a jeweled
 scepter in its paw. On the floor near the throne is another crowned
 platypus... the same one you rescued from the pit.

 The crowd falls silent as you enter.

 "Welcome, brave Adventurer," says the white platypus, rising from its
 throne to greet you. "I am Anatinus, King of Misty Island. My court
 thanks you most humbly for rescuing the life of my daughter, Princess
 Tasmania. Great would our sorrow have been if not for your cunning."

 The crowd applauds politely, and Princess Tasmania blushes.

>see king
 (Presumably, you mean King Anatinus.)
 Not unexpectedly, King Anatinus is arrayed in high platypus fashion.

 "My messengers have told me of your quest," continues King Anatinus.
 "Allow me to repay your kindness with words of advice."

 The old platypus motions you to his side. "The Tower of the Evil One is
 formidable," he begins in a low, serious voice. "You will never get
 inside unaided. Legends speak of a Magick Word that can open the gates
 of the Tower. But what Word it is, none can say."

 The king reaches beneath his throne and takes out a small wizard's hat.
 "Take this," he says, holding it out to you.

 Magick. Heed him well! In his wisdom lies your only hope."

>wear hat
 But the wizard's hat is much too small!

 A fanfare of trumpets breaks the silence, and the crowd falls to its
 knees.

 "Good luck to you, brave Adventurer!" cries King Anatinus, bowing
 deeply. "Now blow into the silver whistle one more time, and deliver us
 from the horror of the Evil One."

 The platypuses look at you expectantly.

>blow whistle
 A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 A sudden gust of wind rises out of nowhere, and Misty Island falls away
 beneath your feet. You feel the silver whistle slip from your hand as

 Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through
 half-closed eyelids.

>give hat to pelican
 The pelican sniffs the wizard's hat suspiciously. Its eyes open wide
 with interest, and the wizard's hat quickly finds a place on the
 pelican's head. Then the old bird gives you a sly, knowledgeable wink.

 All at once the lighthouse blazes to life! Its shining beacon whirls
 like a gyroscope, and a pencil-thin beam of light pierces the sky and
 traces a word on a passing cloud: SORKIN.

 The pelican spreads its wings and soars away over the bay. As the beam
 of the lighthouse fades, a voice in your head whispers, "Good luck,
 brave Adventurer!"

 With great effort, you manage to squeeze yourself into the hole.

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel
 door and stone walls offer little hope for escape.

 The only furnishing is a hard bunk in the middle of the floor.

 There's a dark, narrow hole in the floor.

 The small stone begins to glow again.

>burn note

>read leaflet
 It seems to be a junk-mail ad for a primitive computer game. The
 cancelled stamp on the leaflet is too faded to read clearly.

>squeeze stone
 That would be a pointless thing to do.

>shake note
 How would you like it if somebody did that to YOUR violet note?

 Talking to yourself is said to be a sign of impending mental collapse.

 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you

 winds down the north side of the hill, towards the river.

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and

 Miss Voss, the former town librarian, is peering at you suspiciously.

 The vulture hovers in the sky high overhead.

 Theater Lobby
 You're standing in the lobby of the movie theater. A short corridor

 Twilight Glen
 The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make
 out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the
 tombstones winds off to the east.

 As you glance around you notice luminous ribbons of mist darting among
 the tombstones. The air is filled with sinister voices.

 Circling like sharks, they stroke your face with ghostly fingers and

 The tombstones block your path.

 Giggling with mischievous Glee, the eldritch vapors clutch your legs

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Misty Island
 You're standing on a fog-shrouded beach. Sheer cliff walls rise to the
 north and south, and the dark waters of the lake stretch eastward.

 To the west stands a magnificent castle, its parapets rising high into

 Throne Room
 You're standing in a long, high-ceilinged chamber. Hundreds of
 platypuses are milling about with teacups in their paws, their faces
 illuminated by a roaring fireplace.

 At the far end of the chamber stands a mighty throne. It's occupied by
 a snow-white platypus with a gold crown on its head and a jeweled
 scepter in its paw. On the floor near the throne is another crowned
 platypus... the same one you rescued from the pit.

 The crowd falls silent as you enter.

 "Welcome, brave Adventurer," says the white platypus, rising from its
 throne to greet you. "I am Anatinus, King of Misty Island. My court
 thanks you most humbly for rescuing the life of my daughter, Princess
 Tasmania. Great would our sorrow have been if not for your cunning."

 The crowd applauds politely, and Princess Tasmania blushes.

>see fireplace
 You can see nothing interesting about it.

 "My messengers have told me of your quest," continues King Anatinus.
 "Allow me to repay your kindness with words of advice."

 The old platypus motions you to his side. "The Tower of the Evil One
 is formidable," he begins in a low, serious voice. "You will never get
 inside unaided. Legends speak of a Magick Word that can open the gates
 of the Tower. But what Word it is, none can say."

 The king reaches beneath his throne and takes out a small wizard's
 hat. "Take this," he says, holding it out to you.

>see king
 (Presumably, you mean King Anatinus.)
 Not unexpectedly, King Anatinus is arrayed in high platypus fashion.

 "Take this Hat," says King Anatinus, holding it out to you.

>take hat
 You're holding too many things already!

 "I offer you this Hat," says King Anatinus, holding it out to you.

 Dropped.

 "This Hat is for you. Take it," says King Anatinus, holding it out to
 you.

>see princess

 Not unexpectedly, Princess Tasmania is arrayed in high platypus
 fashion.

 The King Anatinus glares at you with annoyance.

 "You dare to ignore a royal gift?" he cries, deeply offended. "I see.
 Perhaps a short visit to the granola mines will teach you some
 respect!"

 The King turns you into a platypus with an angry wave of his scepter,
 and the guards lead you away to twenty years of backbreaking labor.

 deeply. "Now blow into the silver whistle one more time, and deliver
 us from the horror of the Evil One."

 The platypuses look at you expectantly.

 It's not likely that King Anatinus would approve.

 "The merest blow into the whistle will speed you on your quest," says
 King Anatinus.

 It seems unlikely that King Anatinus would approve.

 "You need only blow into the whistle," says King Anatinus.

 Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the
 water.

 You can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake.

 The pelican sniffs the wizard's hat suspiciously. Its eyes open wide
 with interest, and the wizard's hat quickly finds a place on the
 pelican's head. Then the old bird gives you a sly, knowledgeable wink.

 All at once the lighthouse blazes to life! Its shining beacon whirls
 like a gyroscope, and a pencil-thin beam of light pierces the sky and
 traces a word on a passing cloud: SORKIN.

 The pelican spreads its wings and soars away over the bay. As the beam
 of the lighthouse fades, a voice in your head whispers, "Good luck,
 brave Adventurer!"

 (Hope you saved your story position.)

 A sudden power drain makes all the other games in the arcade go dim.
 Blue sheets of energy leap from the game machine, surrounding you in
 an incandescent aura. You can feel your molecules being taken apart
 one at a time, analyzed, modulated and broadcast through space. It is
 not a pleasant sensation.








 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Witchville.

 A tower stands in bleak silhouette against the moonlit sky. It rises a
 hundred feet above a barren plateau, and is encircled by a deep moat.
 The only entrances are a closed drawbridge and a dark window near the
 top.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 A synthetic voice says, "Game Over. Insert Token To Play Again."

 Vestibule
 You're standing in a dimly-lit vestibule just inside the tower's
 entrance. The drawbridge is opened across the moat to the north. A
 short corridor leads south, into the tower.

 "Turn back, brave Adventurer!"

 You stare in horror at the platypus chained to the floor. It's
 Princess Tasmania!

>ask princess about chains
 (Presumably, you mean Princess Tasmania.)
 A rumbling noise calls your attention away from the chain.

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of...
 Mr. Crisp!

 "Nice of you to drop by," he sneers as a gigantic Boot pins you to the
 ground. "Saves me the bother of tracking you down."








 Torture Chamber
 You're chained up in the corner of a dim, stuffy chamber, deep within
 the bowels of the tower. The walls gleam with obscure medical
 instruments, and a diabolical torture machine occupies most of the
 opposite corner.

 Princess Tasmania is clamped into the torture machine!

 A ladder rises to meet an open hatch in the middle of the ceiling.

 Mr. Crisp is strolling around dusting off the instruments.

>corky, hello
 Mr. Crisp reddens. "Don't use that name in front of me!"

>corky, hi
 Mr. Crisp reddens. "Don't use that name in front of me!"

>show note to crisp
 Mr. Crisp takes the violet note and stares at it. His face turns pale.
 "Where did this come from?" he whispers, opening it.

 An unbearably sweet expression spreads over his face as he reads. The
 violet note falls from his hands.

 "I've got to run," Mr. Crisp cries, tossing his white lab coat into a
 corner and stuffing his shirttails into his pants. "Violet scolds me
 when I'm late!" He struggles into a hideous velvet blazer, pushes a
 comb through his hair and scampers up the ladder like a little boy.

 The hatch closes with a hollow thud.

>get note
 You can't. Mr. Crisp dropped it out of your reach.

 You hear the distant rattle of the drawbridge opening.

 Princess Tasmania breathes a sigh of relief.

 Princess Tasmania strains against her clamps. "Release me from this
 torture machine, brave Adventurer! The merest pull of the lever will
 gain my freedom."

>pull lever
 The clamps on the torture machine retract, and Princess Tasmania leaps
 off. She's free!

 "Again you spare my unworthy life, brave Adventurer." The platypus
 humbly licks your shoe, to your considerable embarrassment. "My
 father, King Anatinus, does not forget such kindness."

 The little creature produces a silver whistle from her gown and blows
 into it gently. A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 "Your journey is not yet ended," she warns as a whirlpool of colored
 light envelops her. "But even if you fail, your deeds shall live
 forever in our legends. Have faith!"

 When the colors fade, Princess Tasmania is gone.

 sorry state. Many of the best exhibits have been carted away; the few
 remaining are sorely in need of renovation.
>blow on books

 Fortunately, one of your childhood favorites is still intact. It's a
 pair of enormous fossil mailboxes, their metal bones locked together
 in a pose of eternal combat.

 There's a glass display case in the corner. You can see a sculpture in
 the case.

 (That sentence didn't make sense. Please reword it or try something

>examine sculpture
 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

>see sculpture
 The black marble sculpture is about 14 inches high. It's exquisitely
 crafted in the likeness of a cat.

 You can see a round, shallow hole carved into the forehead of the
 sculpture.

 Crash! You broke the display case open with the horseshoe.

 The tinkle of broken glass is drowned out by the blare of an electric
 security alarm! You stand frozen with fear as Sgt. MacGuffin strides
 into the Museum and drags you to the Tower, where you're subjected to
 months of slow, painful torture at the skilled hands of the Evil One.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 You can feel little icky things sliding down your throat.

>wish for darkness
 The air becomes very still as you speak the Wish. The gravedigger
 frowns, blinks his eyes and looks around nervously.

 All at once a terrifying shadow sweeps across the surface of
 Wishbringer. The candle flame withers and dies, plunging the room into
 total darkness.

 "Who turned out the lights?!" cries the gravedigger, stumbling around
 the pitch-black lobby in terror.

 (Thankfully, the icky taste of grue milk is gone.)

>go north
 The gravedigger cries, "Don't leave me alone!"

 It is pitch black.

 As suddenly as it faded, the light from Wishbringer returns, and the
 candle flares back to life.

 Inside Theater
 This is a movie theater unlike any you've ever seen! The seats are
 wide, deep and comfortable. The aisles are spotless. The air is clear
 of smoke, and the screen is dramatically large. A chill goes up your
 spine as you realize how alien your universe has become.

 There's a noisy movie playing on the screen. A dark corridor leads out
 to the lobby.

 The screen image is a meaningless blur of colored light.

>see image
 (Presumably, you mean the movie screen.)

 All you can see on the screen is a confusing double-image.

>search seats
 Hmm. This place isn't completely spotless. You just discovered a used
 pair of 3D glasses under a seat.

 The picture on the screen is fuzzy and hard to watch.

>wear glasses
 You're not holding the pair of 3D glasses.

 All you can see on the screen is a confusing double-image.

>take glasses

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 88 out of

 The screen image is a meaningless blur of colored light.

>wear glasses
 Wow! As you put on the glasses the picture on the screen fuses into a
 solid, 3-dimensional image.
 The movie screen shows an evil woman squinting through an antique
 telescope. A laboratory full of bubbling 3D chemicals is visible in
 the background.

>see woman
 She's a dark, sinister being with terrible eyes!

 A 3D vulture lands on the woman's shoulder and croaks a secret into
 her ear. An evil eyebrow rises slowly as she listens.

>watch film
 The old woman swings the 3D antique telescope around (narrowly missing
 your nose) and peers into it again. A point-of-view shot reveals what
 the 'scope is focused on: a small movie theater, remarkably similar to
 the one you're in right now.

>see telescope
 The antique telescope is pointing out the window.

 The antique telescope zooms in on the entrance to the movie theater. A
 dead ringer for Miss Voss looks up and waves timidly at the camera.

>see vulture
 Its steady gaze makes you uneasy.

 The old woman stalks across the lab to a panel of heavy-duty power
 switches. As the camera follows, you catch a fleeting 3D glimpse of a
 black cat sleeping in the corner of the lab.

>see cat
 She's black as night from head to tail, and sound asleep.

 The old woman selects a power switch labeled "Palace Theater" and
 opens it with a diabolical cackle. A 3D arc of electricity leaps from
 the screen, and a shower of sparks seems to engulf the movie
 theater...

 Poof! The image on the screen goes black. The soundtrack slowly grinds
 to a halt.

>see stone
 The small stone glows with an eerie violet-white radiance.

>remove glasses
 Okay, you're no longer wearing the pair of 3D glasses.

 As you appear in the lobby the gravedigger promptly throws you out
 into the street. "Sneak past me, eh? Scram!"

 Misty Island
 You're standing on a fog-shrouded beach. Sheer cliff walls rise to the

 Throne Room

 a snow-white platypus with a gold crown on its head and a jeweled
 scepter in its paw. On the floor near the throne is another crowned
 platypus... the same one you rescued from the pit.

 The crowd falls silent as you enter.

 "Welcome, brave Adventurer," says the white platypus, rising from its
 throne to greet you. "I am Anatinus, King of Misty Island. My court
 thanks you most humbly for rescuing the life of my daughter, Princess
 Tasmania. Great would our sorrow have been if not for your cunning."

 The crowd applauds politely, and Princess Tasmania blushes.

 Lighthouse
 This is where the river empties into Witchville Bay. A path leads west
 along the riverbank.

 A broken-down old lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands on the
 shore nearby.

 Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through
 half-closed eyelids.

>bow to pelican
 Paying respect to the pelican doesn't do anything.

>give hat to pelican
 The pelican sniffs the wizard's hat suspiciously. Its eyes open wide
 with interest, and the wizard's hat quickly finds a place on the
 pelican's head. Then the old bird gives you a sly, knowledgeable wink.

 All at once the lighthouse blazes to life! Its shining beacon whirls
 like a gyroscope, and a pencil-thin beam of light pierces the sky and
 traces a word on a passing cloud: SORKIN.

 The pelican spreads its wings and soars away over the bay. As the beam
 of the lighthouse fades, a voice in your head whispers, "Good luck,
 brave Adventurer!"

 You're on the eastern side of the Witchville Rotary. A street branches

 and a marquee announces the current feature.

 Miss Voss, the former town librarian, is peering at you suspiciously.

 "You won't get far without a ticket!" cries Miss Voss.

 Theater Lobby
 You're standing in the lobby of the movie theater. A short corridor
 leads north into darkness. Sound effects and music can be heard
 drifting down the corridor.

 Slurp! All gone.

 You can feel little icky things sliding down your throat.

>wish for darkness
 The air becomes very still as you speak the Wish. The gravedigger
 frowns, blinks his eyes and looks around nervously.

 All at once a terrifying shadow sweeps across the surface of
 Wishbringer. The candle flame withers and dies, plunging the room into
 total darkness.

 "Who turned out the lights?!" cries the gravedigger, stumbling around
 the pitch-black lobby in terror.

 (Thankfully, the icky taste of grue milk is gone.)

>go north
 The gravedigger cries, "Don't leave me alone!"

 It is pitch black.

 As suddenly as it faded, the light from Wishbringer returns, and the
 candle flares back to life.

 Inside Theater
 This is a movie theater unlike any you've ever seen! The seats are
 wide, deep and comfortable. The aisles are spotless. The air is clear
 of smoke, and the screen is dramatically large. A chill goes up your
 spine as you realize how alien your universe has become.

 There's a noisy movie playing on the screen. A dark corridor leads out
 to the lobby.

 All you can see on the screen is a confusing double-image.

>look under seat
 Hmm. This place isn't completely spotless. You just discovered a used
 pair of 3D glasses under a seat.

 The screen image is a meaningless blur of colored light.

>get glasses

 The picture on the screen is fuzzy and hard to watch.

>wear glasses
 Wow! As you put on the glasses the picture on the screen fuses into a
 solid, 3-dimensional image.

 The movie screen shows an evil woman squinting through an antique
 telescope. A laboratory full of bubbling 3D chemicals is visible in
 the background.

>see movie
 A 3D vulture lands on the woman's shoulder and croaks a secret into
 her ear. An evil eyebrow rises slowly as she listens.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The old woman swings the 3D antique telescope around (narrowly missing
 your nose) and peers into it again. A point-of-view shot reveals what
 the 'scope is focused on: a small movie theater, remarkably similar to
 the one you're in right now.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The antique telescope zooms in on the entrance to the movie theater. A
 dead ringer for Miss Voss looks up and waves timidly at the camera.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The old woman stalks across the lab to a panel of heavy-duty power
 switches. As the camera follows, you catch a fleeting 3D glimpse of a
 black cat sleeping in the corner of the lab.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The old woman selects a power switch labeled "Palace Theater" and
 opens it with a diabolical cackle. A 3D arc of electricity leaps from
 the screen, and a shower of sparks seems to engulf the movie
 theater...

 Poof! The image on the screen goes black. The soundtrack slowly grinds
 to a halt.

 Video Arcade
 This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op
 video games. The machines are crowded with half-crazed, stunted
 humanoids, who pay no attention to you as they satisfy their thirst
 for electric violence.

 One machine in the corner appears to be deserted.

 A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token."

>put token in machine
 The brass token disappears into the slot.

 The stunted humanoids in the arcade hold their breath as your hand
 touches the flashing button. This might be a trap! You don't really
 want to press that big red button, do you?

>yes

 (Hope you saved your story position.)

 A sudden power drain makes all the other games in the arcade go dim.
 Blue sheets of energy leap from the game machine, surrounding you in
 an incandescent aura. You can feel your molecules being taken apart
 one at a time, analyzed, modulated and broadcast through space. It is
 not a pleasant sensation.








 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Witchville.

 A tower stands in bleak silhouette against the moonlit sky. It rises a
 hundred feet above a barren plateau, and is encircled by a deep moat.
 The only entrances are a closed drawbridge and a dark window near the
 top.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 A synthetic voice says, "Game Over. Insert Token To Play Again."

 Vestibule
 You're standing in a dimly-lit vestibule just inside the tower's
 entrance. The drawbridge is opened across the moat to the north. A
 short corridor leads south, into the tower.

 "Turn back, brave Adventurer!"

 You stare in horror at the platypus chained to the floor. It's
 Princess Tasmania!

>princess, hello
 (Presumably, you mean Princess Tasmania.)
 A rumbling noise calls your attention away from Princess Tasmania.

 (spoken to Princess Tasmania)
 A rumbling noise calls your attention away from Princess Tasmania.

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of...
 Mr. Crisp!

 "Nice of you to drop by," he sneers as a gigantic Boot pins you to the
 ground. "Saves me the bother of tracking you down."








 Torture Chamber
 You're chained up in the corner of a dim, stuffy chamber, deep within
 the bowels of the tower. The walls gleam with obscure medical
 instruments, and a diabolical torture machine occupies most of the
 opposite corner.

 Princess Tasmania is clamped into the torture machine!

 A ladder rises to meet an open hatch in the middle of the ceiling.

 Mr. Crisp is fondling the instruments, one by one.

>give note to crisp
 Mr. Crisp takes the violet note and stares at it. His face turns pale.
 "Where did this come from?" he whispers, opening it.

 An unbearably sweet expression spreads over his face as he reads. The
 violet note falls from his hands.

 "I've got to run," Mr. Crisp cries, tossing his white lab coat into a
 corner and stuffing his shirttails into his pants. "Violet scolds me
 when I'm late!" He struggles into a hideous velvet blazer, pushes a
 comb through his hair and scampers up the ladder like a little boy.

 The hatch closes with a hollow thud.

>get coat

 You hear the distant rattle of the drawbridge opening.

 Princess Tasmania breathes a sigh of relief.

 You're holding a pair of 3D glasses, an umbrella, a leaflet, a candle

 torture machine, brave Adventurer! The merest pull of the lever will
 gain my freedom."

>drop leaflet

 The chains cut painfully into your wrist as you strain to grasp the
 white lab coat. Your fingertips brush against the collar... There! You

 Tasmania.

>look in coat
 You can see a rusty key in the white lab coat.

 Round Chamber
 You're in a round chamber at the very heart of the tower. The clammy
 stone walls are hung with a series of paintings, all the same size and
 identically framed. Years of neglect have blackened the art almost
 beyond recognition.

 In the corner is an open hatch. Peering downward, you see a ladder
 descending into gloom.

 A corridor disappears to the north, and a damp stairway winds upward
 into the tower.

>/undo

>pull down lever
 The clamps on the torture machine retract, and Princess Tasmania leaps
 off. She's free!

 "Again you spare my unworthy life, brave Adventurer." The platypus
 humbly licks your shoe, to your considerable embarrassment. "My
 father, King Anatinus, does not forget such kindness."

 The little creature produces a silver whistle from her gown and blows
 into it gently. A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 "Your journey is not yet ended," she warns as a whirlpool of colored
 light envelops her. "But even if you fail, your deeds shall live
 forever in our legends. Have faith!"

 When the colors fade, Princess Tasmania is gone.

 Formerly a popular tourist attraction, the old Festeron Museum is in a

 Wishbringer glows brighter as it nears the sculpture. It looks like it

 "Wait!" commands a familiar voice.

 You turn, and see the figure of an old woman standing in the darkness
 of the corridor.

 "Your quest is ended, brave Adventurer," says the old woman. "The
 sculpture you see before you is Chaos, the Cat Which Was Stolen. Now
 give Wishbringer to me, and together we shall rejoice in your
 success."

 Do you still want to put Wishbringer into the sculpture?

 A blast of Magick shakes the building as Wishbringer touches the
 forehead of the sculpture. Violet sheets of energy, pure and
 brilliant, erupt from the very heart of the Stone and illuminate the
 room like daylight.

 The woman's disguise evaporates in the glare. It's the Evil One, her
 mouth frozen open in a wail of despair as she fades into oblivion. The
 memory of that face will haunt your dreams as long as you live.

 You watch as the sculpture begins to soften in the radiance. It
 wriggles like a thing alive, leaps across the floor and disappears
 into a vortex of color. The library folds around you like the closing
 of a great book...








 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward. Looking southeast, you see a friendly orange sun
 rising from a bank of morning clouds.

 Post Office Hill is visible to the south, topped as usual by the
 Festeron Post Office.

 The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.

 A black cat is rubbing against your leg.

>pet cat

 The door of the Magick Shoppe creaks open, and the old woman, dressed
 in a nightgown, stands blinking in the morning sun. "Who's there?"

 The black cat leaps into the woman's arms. "Chaos!" she cries,
 laughing and sobbing all at once as the cat licks tears of joy from
 her face.

 At last the old woman lowers Chaos to the ground and walks over to
 where you're standing, red with embarrassment.

 "Now you know me for the old liar I am," she chuckles, clasping your
 hands gratefully in her own. "I promised to give you Wishbringer,
 knowing full well that, if you succeeded, its virtue would be lost.

 "In truth, the Stone would make a poor reward," she continues,
 stooping to tickle the cat's white forehead. "As you can see, it
 brings more joy in the shape of a companion than in any other. This is
 Wishbringer's finest Magick. A pity that my sister, the Evil One, did
 not know of it."

 You can hear a familiar "clump-clump, clump-clump" sound behind you.
 It's the little mailbox, hopping bravely up the steep trail! The woman
 looks on with puzzled amusement as the faithful box hops to your side
 and rubs lovingly against your sleeve.

 The old woman pulls Miss Voss's violet note from an obscure pocket and
 hands it to you. "Make sure you give this to Mr. Crisp when you see
 him," she says with a sly wink. "And tell him I said hello."

 Cradling Chaos in her arms like a child, the old woman ambles back
 into the Magick Shoppe. "Farewell!" she calls from the closing door,
 and the sunlight makes her face look young. "Now you are a true
 Adventurer."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 Museum
 Formerly a popular tourist attraction, the old Festeron Museum is in a
 sorry state. Many of the best exhibits have been carted away; the few
 remaining are sorely in need of renovation.

 Fortunately, one of your childhood favorites is still intact. It's a
 pair of enormous fossil mailboxes, their metal bones locked together
 in a pose of eternal combat.

 There's a broken glass display case in the corner. You can see a
 sculpture in the case.

>put stone in forehead
 (Presumably, you mean the sculpture.)
 Wishbringer glows brighter as it nears the sculpture. It looks like it
 will fit perfectly into the black forehead.

 "Wait!" commands a familiar voice.

 You turn, and see the figure of an old woman standing in the darkness
 of the corridor.

 "Your quest is ended, brave Adventurer," says the old woman. "The
 sculpture you see before you is Chaos, the Cat Which Was Stolen. Now
 give Wishbringer to me, and together we shall rejoice in your
 success."

 Do you still want to put Wishbringer into the sculpture?

>no
 Okay, you're still holding Wishbringer.

 The old woman steps out of the darkness and moves towards you. "Give
 me the Stone," she says. "I want to make certain you haven't damaged
 it."

>eat wishbringer
 It isn't likely that the small stone would agree with you.

 "Let me touch Wishbringer," says the old woman, inching closer. "I
 want to hold it again in my hands."

 You feel your fingers relaxing as she speaks.

>see woman
 It looks like the old woman you met at the Magick Shoppe.

 (Hmm. The outline of the woman is blurry, like a double image. Must be
 your eyes getting tired or something.)

 "Quickly!" snaps the old woman impatiently. "Give me the Magick Stone.
 You have no use for it now!"

 Your fingers are beginning to lose their grip on Wishbringer.

>wear glasses
 You can't see any glasses here!

>see woman
 It looks like the old woman you met at the Magick Shoppe.

 (Hmm. The outline of the woman is fuzzy, like a double image. Must be
 your eyes getting tired or something.)

 The old woman stretches out her clawlike hand. "If you will not give
 the Stone to me freely," she growls, "I will have no choice but to
 take it."

 Your hand is trembling violently. It wants to give her Wishbringer!

>wear glasses
 You can't see any glasses here!

>go north
 The old woman is blocking your path.

 "Yield!" commands the woman sharply.

 The small stone leaps out of your hand and into the old woman's bony
 fingers. She holds it up and gazes into its depths. "Wishbringer," she
 whispers, deep in her throat.

 The Stone begins to pulse with crimson light. In its sinister glow,
 the old woman's disguise melts away. It's the Evil One!

 "A fool!" she cackles wildly, and the sculpture shatters to pieces at
 the sound. "My sister was a fool to send the likes of you on such a
 quest! Does she think a mail clerk can save the world from Wickedness?
 Be gone!"

 With a wave of her warty hand, the Evil One turns you into a furry
 toilet seat cover.








 Looks like the story's over. But don't despair! Interactive fiction
 lets you learn from your mistakes.

 Your score is 91 points out of 100, in 411 moves. You've used 1 of the
 Stone's 7 Wishes.

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.

 To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick
 building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands
 invitingly open.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you.

 Okay, what do you want to do now?
>go south
 Post Office
 This is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined
 with small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter
 runs along the entire length of the room.

 Your boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other
 people's postcards.

 Mr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. "Where have you
 been?" he barks angrily. "Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking
 everywhere for you!"

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 1 out of

 What next?

 Mr. Crisp screams, "Come back here, numbskull!"

 Post Office

 Mr. Crisp reaches under the service counter and pulls out a mysterious
 envelope. "We just got this Special Delivery," he snarls, tossing it
 onto the service counter. "I want you to drop it off right away. That
 means NOW!"

 What next?
>take package
 (Sorry, but this story doesn't recognize the word "package.")

 What next?
>corky, hi
 Mr. Crisp reddens. "Don't use that name in front of me!"

 What next?
>take envelope
 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 6 out of

 As you leave the Post Office, somebody slams and locks the door behind
 you.

 wanders north.

 Spooky Copse
 A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really
 spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.

 There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected
 next to it.

 An old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree.

 The gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach.

 What next?
>go down
 The gravedigger reaches into the open grave and pulls you out. "Don't
 go in there!" he cries. "You might get buried alive!"

 The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding.
 "That's a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says.
 "Let's have a look at it."

 (You won't see the "What next?" prompt any more.)
>give envelope to gravedigger
 The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope.
 "Hmm," he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried
 that old woman years ago."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 "Couldn't ask for a nicer day for diggin' graves."

>ask man about graves
 (Sorry, but the word "graves" is not in the vocabulary that you can
 use.)

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you
 soon."

 The old man ambles away to the west.

>go down
 Open Grave

 You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the town librarian. The road
 turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post
 Office Hill.

 As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle
 you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street,
 yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth.

 You can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps.

>alexis, heel
 The poodle decides that you're only guessing its name, and yaps all
 the louder.

>give bone to poodle
 The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to
 gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you.

 brightly.
