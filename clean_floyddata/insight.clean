 "Is this alright?" asks the young cop. "Do you need the lights lower,
 or incense, or something?"

 "This is fine. I just need to see him, ask some questions."

 "Okay," he nods. "Just buzz the buzzer when you're done." He leaves,
 pulling the metal door to with the click of a magnetic lock. Across
 the table from you the man stiffens, waiting for you to speak.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Interview Room</span>
 The six walls are metal. This is a box in which nothing happens but
 people talk, and fans whir air in and out to help the words move
 along. By the door in the north wall is a small red button that rings
 the buzzer for the guard, and it's smart enough to know who's pushing.
 This isn't a place people leave of their own accord, and they rarely
 come here that way either.

 The man across the table from you is no different. His eyes are
 sagging from lack of sleep, and he is sweating just a little even
 though the air is regulated to be cold.

>examine me


 You look just as you would expect to.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>examine man


 Mackenzie is a broad man, with receding spiky hair and the slow march
 of middle-age filling out his stomach. His fingers are the only
 delicate thing about him, long and arachnid, somehow out of place on
 the ends of his bulky hands. He watches you, afraid, perhaps guarding
 something. He fidgets nervously.

>help


 <span class="floydstyle em">INSIGHT</span> is a standard text-game in many ways. The most
 important commands are EXAMINE (provide a closer description of
 something), LOOK (describe the current location), TAKE (to collect an
 object), and INVENTORY (to list your current possessions). These can
 be abbreviated X, L, T and I respectively. (eg. "T KETTLE. X KETTLE.")

 To talk to characters, you may ASK them about various topics, or type
 a character's name, a comma and then a question. (eg. MAN, WHY DID YOU
 MOVE THE BODY?) The game understands quite complicated constructions,
 but is less prone to error if you keep input simple. Asking the same
 questions again will often prompt more complete answers; you can also
 type "PROMPT CHARACTER". "ASK" can be shortened to A.

 Movement is via compass directions (N, S, E, W), also Up and Down. You
 may type RESTART and QUIT at any time; also SAVE will store your
 current position and RESTORE will reload it. Acknowledgements and
 credits are in the end-game text. Bugs and feedback to
 jonnyingold@netscape.net.

>ask man about crime


 "Poison, did they say? I have a lab, it could have been anything." He
 is jittery, his face twitching. "She might have eaten one of my bulbs
 or something. I don't know why it's being called a <span class="floydstyle em">murder</span>."

>prompt man


 "I don't know! A lab is full of poisons, that's how I work! She must
 have got into it."

 It is a little difficult to follow the man's speech. His accent is
 thick, and the language is still unfamiliar.

>ask man about her


 His language is something you only started learning two weeks ago,
 when this crime was reported and he was put on the ship back home.
 You're still sufficiently rusty that there are some things (such as
 that) you still do not know how to say.

>ask man about poison


 "I don't know! A lab is full of poisons, that's how I work! She must
 have got into it."

>ask man about the victim


 He flinches. "Do you have to put it like that? She was my wife."

>ask man about his wife


 His face pales. "She's dead, I know," he whispers.

>man, what is your wife's name


 "My name's Mackenzie. But... I guess you already know that. Yes," he
 says.

>ask man about bulb


 You rack your brain but cannot come up with the right vocabulary to
 express it in his language.

>ask man about murder

>ask man about language

 "I don't know! A lab is full of poisons, that's how I work! She must
 have got into it."



 "I'm monolingual; I never even learnt English. My wife used to say it
 made it fairer. She didn't understand what I did, but I didn't
 understand a word of her documents."

>mackenzie, can I call you mac


 He frowns, confused. It seems your two-week attendance at the language
 course hasn't totally paid off.

>ask man about documents


 "What documents? I don't know what you're talking about," he replies,
 looking quite confused.

>ask man about wife


 His face pales. "She's dead, I know," he whispers.

>ask man about job


 "I'm a genetic designer. I design plants for the soil, to grow
 naturally. To fill up the atmosphere. I'm at the top of my field," he
 adds, nervously.

>ask man about confession


 "Just because I had the lab. That doesn't mean anything."

>ask man about genetics


 "It's my field; designing organisms. Sorry, no offence intended," he
 quails. "I mean, I only work with plants. My company invented oxyalg."

>waterboard man


 -- "waterboard" isn't a recognised verb.

>ask man about oxyalg


 "Oxyalg. You know what it is. Three quarters of Mars does. It's
 growing us the atmosphere up there. Why are you asking this? What does
 it matter to... you know."

>prompt man


 "It's almost finished with, then we have a little bacterial agent to
 release which will destroy the stuff. And that's it."

>again


 He sighs, helplessly. "We have a thousand tanks of bacteria ready to
 release, to mop up all the algae once its finished its job. If we
 don't do it, it'll just keep on spreading. And then it's flat-out
 colonisation. The only thing to slow it are the windstorms."

>again


 He sighs, helplessly. "We have a thousand tanks of bacteria ready to
 release, to mop up all the algae once its finished its job. If we
 don't do it, it'll just keep on spreading. And then it's flat-out
 colonisation. The only thing to slow it are the windstorms."

>ask man about windstorms


 "The windstorms have been a problem since the atmosphere started to
 grow. I was working on solutions, using plants. Would you like to know
 how they work, is that it?"

>again


 "The idea is to grow plants with some pollination that'll trigger in
 high winds, but with pollen redesigned to clump together in the air,
 act as a biological thickener. If enough is released, the air will be
 locally very viscous, and the wind will slow. Of course," he adds,
 "we'd need a lot of these plants if it was ever to work. Or in
 strategic places. I think it's unlikely," he finishes. "Whatever the
 papers might think."

>ask man about plants


 "They've been a hobby for a while. I've been growing things around the
 house. I'm particularly proud of the bush outside the front."

 "But just tell me," he says suddenly. "Is this going to hurt me? Is it
 like torture?"

>man, is what like torture


 "I'm sorry," Mackenzie replies. "I didn't quite follow that."

>ask man about bush


 "That bush is one of my personal collection; I made it. Its sap is
 laced with a chemical that briefly sharpens your reflexes, muscle
 control, that sort of thing. I use it before I drive."

>again


 "It's not illegal or anything. It's just like caffeine; that comes
 from plants too."

>ask man about papers


 "I read 'The Native'. It's a hackrag, but it's the only paper in my
 language after all."

>again


 "There's been a lot of rubbish recently about Knassion," he remarks.
 "It's a big thing up there."

>ask man about Knassion


 "Knassion?" he smiles. "Everyone else calls it 'Genus K' like it was a
 codename." He smiles bitterly. "It's a plant designed to reduce the
 windstorms." There is a pause, and he sighs. "They're a problem for
 everyone," he replies. "We've been working on it at AlgCorp. But
 that's not why I'm here, surely?"

>again


 "It's a plant designed to reduce the windstorms." There is a pause,
 and he sighs. "They're a problem for everyone," he replies. "We've
 been working on it at AlgCorp. But that's not why I'm here, surely?"

>ask man about AlgCorp


 "AlgCorp. Nice enough company, too, I suppose. They gave us the
 house."

>again


 "AlgCorp. Nice enough company, too, I suppose. More or less the only
 one we've got," he finishes.

>ask man about house


 "We've been in Olympia about ten years now. I like it. I think Laura
 did too."

>again


 "It's a beautiful area," he says wistfully. "The long red deserts and
 the cracked-up horizon." You feel like reminding him its bone-dry
 sand, but refrain.

>ask man about Laura


 "She was American by birth, and came up here to act as a scientific
 interpreter. She was always gifted with languages; she picked up mine
 in about a month."

>again


 "She worked as a translator," he says, voice shaking.

>prompt man


 "How could I have poisoned her? I loved her!"

>again


 "I don't what more you want me to say."

>ask man about Mars


 "I love my planet. I've never wanted to leave it. We've managed to do
 without all the problems you have down here. No overcrowding,
 employment. It's an idyll."

>ask man how did he fall in love


 He shakes his head. "I wish I could talk to you in English," he says,
 "but I never learnt."

>man, how did you meet laura


 "She was American by birth, and came up here to act as a scientific
 interpreter. She was always gifted with languages; she picked up mine
 in about a month."

>ask man about torture


 "Look," he says, his voice shaking and his fingers winding around one
 other like olive trees. "I'm just a scientist. That's all. Just a
 scientist. You don't have to hurt me."

 The door opens briefly and the guard appears. "Brought you some tea,
 sir," he says politely, and brings a mug over to put on the table.
 Mackenzie looks startled by this appearance and is offered nothing
 himself. The guard leaves with a nod and a click of a magnetic lock.

>ask man about hobbies


 You think very hard, but cannot come up with the right words to say it
 in his tongue.

>examine tea


 The tea is black, no sugar; the mug is white and marked "EUPD" below
 the department's badge.

>ask man about eupd


 Your language skills are deficient, such that you cannot come up with
 the right words to say it in his language.

>give tea to man


 (first taking the mug of tea)
 He looks suspiciously at the mug. "No, thank you."

>demonstrate tea


 -- "demonstrate" isn't a recognised verb.

>ask man about family


 You think very hard, but cannot come up with the right words to say it
 in his tongue.

>take tea


 You already have that.

>ask man about enemies


 You rack your brain but cannot come up with the right words to convey
 it in his language.

>ask man about associates


 You think very hard, but cannot come up with the right vocabulary to
 say it in his tongue.

>ask man about laura


 "I don't what more you want me to say."

>drink tea


 You sip a little of the tea.

>ask man about coworkers


 For all the classes and the work, you cannot come up with the right
 phrase to say it in his language.

>feign poisoning


 -- "feign" isn't a recognised verb.

>ask man about torture


 "Look," he says, his voice shaking and his fingers winding around one
 other like olive trees. "I'm just a scientist. That's all. Just a
 scientist. You don't have to hurt me."

>ask man about genus a


 "Genus A - alaphabax. That one didn't work because it didn't pollinate
 enough."

>a genus b


 "Genus B - brodilus. No good as the wind just blew it over and
 uprooted it."

>a genus c


 "Genus C - caromange. Died. Not quite sure what from, but I think lack
 of sunlight."

>a genus d


 "Genus D - dexilille. No good."

>a genus e


 "Genus E - edisonia. It was cactus-based and the spines just broke,
 and then the wind blew them everywhere. Lethal."

>let man go


 -- "let" isn't a recognised verb.

>a genus f


 "Genus F - forrage. Most common problem - degenerative. Never made it
 past a metre high."

>a genus g


 "Genus G - gwenish. Most common problem - degenerative. Never made it
 past a metre high."

>a genus h


 "Genus H - harrallic. Most common problem - degenerative. Never made
 it past a metre high."

>a genus i


 "Genus I - innamoxas. Most common problem - degenerative. Never made
 it past a metre high."

 Dimly, through the thick walls, layers of piping and cables that
 surround this chamber, resonates the deep tolling of Big Ben. It is
 twelve o'clock.

>a genus j

>a genus j

 "Genus J - jingscum. Most common problem - degenerative. Never made it
 past a metre high."



 "Genus J - jingscum. Most common problem - degenerative. Never made it
 past a metre high."

>a genus k


 "Knassion," he says. "It's called Knassion." Then he shrugs. "It's a
 plant designed to reduce the windstorms." There is a pause, and he
 sighs. "They're a problem for everyone," he replies. "We've been
 working on it at AlgCorp. But that's not why I'm here, surely?"

>ask man about London


 You rack your brain but cannot come up with the right vocabulary to
 convey it in his tongue.

>ask man about Earth


 "The first Earth creature to spread on Mars was the ant, you know
 that? Building its scurrying colonies, a thousand creatures crawling
 on each other's backs. Just like your world here; that's waiting to
 come and infest mine."

>again

>prompt man

 "You can keep your planet," he spits. "Let me keep mine."



 "You can keep your planet," he spits. "Let me keep mine."

>again


 "You can keep your planet," he spits. "Let me keep mine."

>ask man about crime


 "I don't know! A lab is full of poisons, that's how I work! She must
 have got into it."

>ask man about set up


 You think very hard, but cannot come up with the right vocabulary to
 express it in his language.

>ask man about being framed


 Your language skills are deficient, such that you cannot come up with
 the right vocabulary to say it in his tongue.

>ask man about lab


 "My lab? It's newly installed - only a week ago. I haven't even been
 in it yet. I don't even know if it's stocked; I didn't oversee the
 installation, we spent that weekend away. Honestly, I didn't take
 anything from in there."

>ask man about innocence


 You rack your brain but cannot come up with the right vocabulary to
 convey it in his language.

>ask man about lab


 "My lab? I can't detail it, I've not been there. I suppose there's
 something poisonous in there, I don't know."

>ask man who did it


 He is looking blank, again.

>ask man about algcorp


 "AlgCorp. Nice enough company, too, I suppose. More or less the only
 one we've got," he finishes.

>ask man about america


 "I don't know much else about it. I don't speak the language, I have -
 I had - no interest in visiting Earth."

>ask man about earth


 "You can keep your planet," he spits. "Let me keep mine."

>ask man about europe


 "What? I don't know... I don't really know anything about it. It's all
 so far from home. That's why she was doing it, impartiality, or
 something. Avoid bias in the language used. As though she wouldn't
 have a bias," he adds, strangely bitter.

>ask man about face on mars


 "Could you rephrase that?" he says, timidly. "I didn't quite
 understand."

>ask man about bias


 For all the classes and the work, you cannot come up with the right
 vocabulary to say it in his tongue.

>ask man about me


 "You're from the police. I know. I know all about you. It's not my
 field, but it's close."

>ask man about europe


 "This is not my idea of a holiday, no."



 "What? I don't know... I don't really know anything about it. It's all
 so far from home. That's why she was doing it, impartiality, or
 something. Avoid bias in the language used. As though she wouldn't
 have a bias," he adds, strangely bitter.

 something. Avoid bias in the language used. As though she wouldn't

>ask man about vacation


 "This is not my idea of a holiday, no."

>man, who found the body


 He has not understood your words, again.

>man, who found laura


 His face pales. "She's dead, I know," he whispers.

>ask man about alibi

>man, why did you kill her

 You think very hard, but cannot come up with the right vocabulary to
 say it in his language.



 "But I loved her. Why would I kill the thing I love the most?" His
 voice is shaking, he may even be close to tears. "She was the
 beautiful... beautiful thing." He turns away, screwing up his eyes,
 his fingers curling into themselves. "And I couldn't have killed her."

>prompt man


 "You have no idea," he says quietly. "You have no idea what you're
 saying."

>a do you still beat your wife


 He has not understood your words, again.

>man, do you still beat your wife


 He has not understood your words, again.

>a do you smoke


 He has not understood your words, again.

>a wife


 His face pales. "She's dead, I know," he whispers.

>a do you drink


 He has not understood your words, again.

>throw tea at man


 There is no need for crude torture methods. You are more evolved than
 that.

>insult man's shirt


 -- "insult" isn't a recognised verb.

>mock man


 -- "mock" isn't a recognised verb.

>man, why did your wife never love you

>scare man

 He has not understood your words, again.



 Mackenzie is already quivering right down to his feet.

>dance


 -- "dance" isn't a recognised verb.

>threaten man


 Mackenzie is already quivering right down to his feet.

>a laura's job


 "Laura was sent documents to translate, went over them and sent them
 back. I think she got paid per word," he says with a misplaced smile.

>a laura's employer


 -- Please be more specific about what you want to say.

>again


 -- Please be more specific about what you want to say.

>ask man about translate


 Your language skills are deficient, such that you cannot come up with
 the right phrase to say it in his tongue.

>a documents


 "I couldn't read them. I might have scanned a couple sometimes, but
 the only words I could pick out were place names and maybe a few
 numbers. I told you, I only speak this language."

>a laura's job


 "I don't know what you're hoping for," he replies angrily. "I don't
 know anything more about it, I couldn't read a word of what she did,
 it was all bloody Turkish to me, or whatever. I think whatever you're
 talking about you know more than me."

>a names


 You think very hard, but cannot come up with the right vocabulary to
 convey it in his language.

>place names


 -- "place" isn't a recognised verb.

>a laura's job


 "She translated," he snaps.

>a magazine


 You rack your brain but cannot come up with the right words to express
 it in his language.

>push button


 "Thank you, Mackenzie. That'll be all." You stand, and go over to
 press the buzzer. He looks quite puzzled. After a moment, the door
 slides open and the guard stands aside to let you through into the
 hallway.

 "You didn't get it, sir," he reports, and you say nothing to
 contradict him.

 "Time for more traditional methods," you reply. The guard nods, and
 you clip down the steel corridors, out to the front and collect a car
 from the pool. Within fifteen minutes you are at the address and
 feeling the sun's cold rays outside the bubble, Mackenzie's file in
 your hand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Mackenzie's Bubble</span>
 Your car is parked at a slight angle at the end of the long drive, its
 nose almost poking into a purple-leaved bush. A dusty wake is
 gradually settling on the long track behind. Mackenzie's bubble is to
 the east, its door closed. The road leads right up to it, with no
 front garden.

>examine file


 An A4 brown envelope marked: "MACKENZIE CASE". It is sealed.

>open envelope


 You slide a finger under the corner of the flap and tear open the
 envelope.

>read file


 The Mackenzie case file: It reads:

 Summary of crime: Murder - Mackenzie, Laura, 32.
 Prime suspect:  Mackenzie, Doctor Yogi, husband, 41.
 Date of crime: 23.5.63
 Location: Bubble 4563. Body found in main bedroom.
 Cause of death: Poison - type unknown.
 Motive: Unknown.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Please clarify unknown variables.</span>

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a brown envelope (which is open)
     a case file
     a printed fax
     a plastic card

>read fax


 A fax-printout photograph of the body, as found by police called to
 the scene by Dr. Mackenzie. The woman depicted is lying on a bed, her
 face constricted and her fingers quite stiff and splayed. Her skin has
 gone a pale white, maybe nearing blue. She is fully clothed, and
 wearing shoes.

>examine card


 (the plastic card)
 A standard plastic card, taken from Mackenzie's wallet, that has his
 house number on it: 4563.

>examine bush


 A line of bushes growing to about waist-height which border the track
 for about twenty metres from the house. They are unfamiliar to you,
 sprawling, with a purple tinge to the leaves.

>eat leaves


 (first taking the line of bushes)
 You pluck a leaf from the bush with a thick snap. In response the
 branch moves backwards, far more than just a recoil, curling up into
 itself. The movement seems to disrupt other branches, sparking a wave
 that travels down the hedgerow in an uncoordinated squirm of fauna. It
 is several minutes before it is still once more; by then the leaf in
 your hand has leaked a fine sap as far as your wrist.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a purple leaf
   a brown envelope (which is open)
     a case file
     a printed fax
     a plastic card

>eat sap


 -- "sap" isn't a recognised word.

>eat leaf


 The leaf is tough to chew, and waxy, and taste of little until you
 have pulped the outer skin when a thin banana-like flavour leaks out.
 Eventually you cannot swallow the residue of the hide and spit it out.

>eat fax


 (first taking the printed fax)
 That's plainly inedible.

>examine bubble


 The bubble is a standard home on a standard road, which runs a few
 hundred metres back to the west. It rises about three metres high and
 is made of a solid white material over which the dust and winds move
 quite harmlessly. There are a few windows; thick and acting as mirrors
 to the seas of dust. There is a door near to you, which a line of
 bushes lead up on either side of the track.

 to the seas of dust. There is a door near to you, which a line of
 bushes lead up on either side of the track.

>open door


 The door is locked.

>examine door


 The standard design of door for one of these buildings, with two main
 doors and a porch between so that the atmosphere inside can be kept
 slightly fuller. The lock is set into the centre. The door is closed
 and locked.

>unlock door with card


 (the plastic card)
 (first taking the plastic card)
 The doorlock beeps distantly through the thin air, and the light
 flicks to a pale green.

>open door


 You push open the door and step into the porch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Porch</span>
 The porch is just a short space of corridor, with two large fans built
 into the walls behind a white-mesh grille. The air is a little better
 regulated here, and smells fresh and tart, straight from an
 algae-tank. There is little else here - a rack for shoes and a hook
 for coats. Either end of this space are the large doors that seal
 inside from outside, they are east and west respectively.

 On the shoe rack are a pair of lady's shoes.

>look in shoe


 (the lady's shoes)
 You tip up one shoe, then the second, and peer inside. After a little
 more shaking the left is revealed to contain a small, hardy cactus
 spine.

>get spine


 You lift the spine very gingerly indeed.

>examine spine


 A multi-barbed cactus spine, with a central point from which nine
 separate needles radiate outward.

 You feel momentarily dizzy.

>lick spine


 -- "lick" isn't a recognised verb.

>eat spine


 That would hardly be wise.

>examine rack

>wear shoes

 A cyan wire rack for placing shoes on. There is space for four or five
 pairs, and the rack is worn down, but now it is almost empty. Only one
 pair of shoes is in attendance.



 (your clothing)
 You are already wearing it.

>examine fan


 The grilles are several feet square; enough to quickly vent this room
 if pressures demanded it.

>wear lady shoes


 -- "lady" isn't a recognised word.

>open fan


 They're just part of the walls.

>examine hooks


 -- "hooks" isn't a recognised word.

>go east


 You open the door with a soft hiss, and go through into the hallway.
 The lights inside come on automatically.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway of Mackenzie's home is bare but homely, one wall hung with
 a photograph of some Earth lake surrounded by mountains, and an
 antiquated-looking coat-stand by the porch door to the west. Doorways
 lead off in two other directions; the east appears to be a kitchen and
 the north is a living room. There is no upstairs in the house; the
 entire upper metre or so is filled solid with various forms of algae,
 to grow oxygen, regulate temperature and recycle waste.

 In one corner is a stubby yucca tree.

>examine coat stand


 An antique wooden coat-stand.

>move it


 You are unable to.

>examine tree


 A hardy plant, quite probably capable of growing as easily outside as
 in.

>get coat stand


 That's not portable.

>take tree


 The tree is fairly bulky.

>examine photo


 The photograph depicts a lake surrounded by snowy peaks; it is from
 Ontario or somewhere in the North American continent.

>look behind photo


 It is securely vacuumed-sealed to the wall.

>examine algae


 -- You referred to something that can't be interacted with at present.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is largely uninteresting - a small functional room, a
 laboratory of life, with the various implements of cooking arranged
 around the walls. For all the advances in materials over the last
 thousand years; roasting, baking and boiling still work as before.
 Just with the addition of microwave generators and plasmacoil hobs.

 So against the northwest wall, is a sink; and in one corner a freezer
 hums quietly to itself.

 The floor is seamless bar a square of plexiplastic.

>examine sink


 A white porcelain sink with a stud marked with a tap, built into the
 wall.

>push stud


 You press the stub and water oozes from a nozzle set into the side of
 the sink.

>examine square


 A frosted crystal plexiplastic sheet in the centre of the floor.

>take square


 You lift up the hinged sheet of plastic, and lay it to one side,
 revealing a ladder leading down into the cellar.

>open freezer


 A blast of cold air hits you from inside. You open the freezer,
 revealing a shelf of food and some frozen biosamples.

 The water shuts off automatically.

>examine biosamples


 Thirteen frozen biosamples stacked up on the top shelf of the freezer,
 happily coexisting with a frozen pizza and a chicken. They are
 labelled "GENUS A" through "GENUS N". Needless to say: one is missing.

>take biosamples from freezer


 You've no idea if they're safe to touch, even if they are sealed.

>examine genus k


 There is a gap where genus K should be.

>examine genus e


 You find the sample for Genus E. Its full name is written on the top:
 edisonia.

>take pizza


 You don't need to eat.

 The basement is lit by striplamps crisscrossed across the plastic

 decomposing rubbish from various plants stored here over the years.
 The other clear thing about this room is that it's half the width it
 used to be - though the ceiling continues back there is a gleaming
 white wall in the way, in the centre of which is a large, forbidding

 A solid metal chest, large enough to hold a ream of paper, with curved
 edges to frustrate hacksaws and hinges buried under a lip of moulded
 steel. It is held closed by a small lock at the front, which takes an
 ordinary key (rather than a fingerprint or a magnetic strip). On the

 the first in place but your hand shakes a little too much and you
 cannot get the third. Irritated, you finally give up.

 a photograph of some Earth lake surrounded by mountains, and an
 antiquated-looking coat-stand by the porch door to the west. Doorways
 lead off in two other directions; the east appears to be a kitchen and

 to grow oxygen, regulate temperature and recycle waste.

 In one corner is a stubby yucca tree.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Porch</span>
 The porch is just a short space of corridor, with two large fans built
 into the walls behind a white-mesh grille. The air is a little better

 algae-tank. There is little else here - a rack for shoes and a hook
 for coats. Either end of this space are the large doors that seal
 inside from outside, they are east and west respectively.

 On the shoe rack are a pair of lady's shoes.

>out


 You open the door effortlessly with a loud hissing sound, and go
 through.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Mackenzie's Bubble</span>
 Your car is parked at a slight angle at the end of the long drive, its
 nose almost poking into a purple-leaved bush. The low sun makes the
 red dust glow like amber into the distance. Mackenzie's bubble is to
 the east, its door closed. The road leads right up to it, with no
 front garden.

>take leaf


 -- You referred to something that can't be interacted with at present.

>examine bush


 A line of bushes growing to about waist-height which border the track
 for about twenty metres from the house. They are unfamiliar to you,
 sprawling, with a purple tinge to the leaves.

 The door swings silently shut and the light on the card-reader returns
 to red.

>take leaves


 You pluck a leaf from the bush with a thick snap. In response the
 branch moves backwards, far more than just a recoil, curling up into
 itself. The movement seems to disrupt other branches, sparking a wave
 that travels down the hedgerow in an uncoordinated squirm of fauna. It
 is several minutes before it is still once more; by then the leaf in
 your hand has leaked a fine sap as far as your wrist.

 You slip the card into the lock and the light flicks over to green.

 Eventually you cannot swallow the residue of the hide and spit it out.

 You slide the hairpin in and with a steady wrist and dextrous

 The sofa stands out quite strikingly; it is pea-green.

 On the long sofa is a newspaper.

 You feel momentarily dizzy.

 The sofa looks in good condition and pretty well made, which means
 almost certainly it was shipped in from Earth as the one luxury the

 a puzzle for the greatest scientific minds.

>examine computer


 A Mx200 notebook computer; built they say for lightness and speed, but
 in reality constructed to handle the flaky network connections running
 under the Marsian dust by devoting half their size to transmitters
 angled in as many directions at once at possible. As a result they're
 renowned for overheating.

>turn on computer


 You flip open the notebook. It bleeps but does not turn on - except
 for a small light which ignites in the corner. It is bright red but

 Although the computer is light, it has no doubt been positioned in the

 Moving it, then, would be bad feng shui.

>examine papers


 They are stamped with the seal of the European Union, and look like
 dossiers on various topics. You pick up the first sheet and scan for
 English fragments.

 The top document must be new - the date is 23.5.63 and it has yet to
 be annotated; which is to say the whole thing is still in ProtoFrench
 and contains no translations. The only words you recognise in the
 horrendous grammatical nightmare that remains are "colonnaque"
 (colony), "houmlla dla sciesse" (scientists) and "Knassion" - which is
 not PF at all, but is familiar from previous debriefings all the same.
 It's a recent prototype piece of biotech.

 The dunes are brushed with a delicate haze of floating orange dust
 like the steam rising from a Spaniard's tanned back; still but for the
 sporadic storms that whip across the sky unchecked and unpredictable.

 the yucca plant. A large bed fills the centre, with a nightstand by
 one side. There are no bookcases and no books; there is no television
 because there are no stations here. A doorway in the southwest wall
 leads to the bathroom, built into the central column of the bubble.

 Around hundred photographs: on skimming through they all appear to be
 of Earth. Forests, trees, lakes, rivers; but also many of cities,
 roads, buildings, bridges, famous monuments; and a good twenty of
 people - crowds, a family outside a green house, another family on a
 boat. Some of the pictures are large - ten inches across - some have
 traces of tape on the back from where they were once stuck to a wall.

 Buried amongst the photographs is a scrawled sheet of paper.

 A sheet of paper covered in scribbles - nothing coherent, but not
 exactly doodles; rather fragments of letters and words and scattered

 strikes you as odd which takes a minute to place: the sheet is not
 handwritten. It has been printed out.

 "Dear Laura.
 Your reports so far are excellent, and will prove of great benefit

 pollenation processes." The final line has been underscored in red
 ink. "Recommend we retrieve alternate information on the matter."

>examine papers


 They are stamped with the seal of the European Union, and look like
 dossiers on various topics. You pick up another sheet and scan for
 English fragments.

 It seems the sheets lower in the stack are all concerned with the
 North African drought crisis.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway of Mackenzie's home is bare but homely, one wall hung with
 a photograph of some Earth lake surrounded by mountains, and an
 antiquated-looking coat-stand by the porch door to the west. Doorways
 lead off in two other directions; the east appears to be a kitchen and
 the north is a living room. There is no upstairs in the house; the
 entire upper metre or so is filled solid with various forms of algae,
 to grow oxygen, regulate temperature and recycle waste.

 In one corner is a stubby yucca tree.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is largely uninteresting - a small functional room, a
 laboratory of life, with the various implements of cooking arranged
 around the walls. For all the advances in materials over the last
 thousand years; roasting, baking and boiling still work as before.
 Just with the addition of microwave generators and plasmacoil hobs.

 So against the northwest wall, no doubt backing onto the sink in the
 bathroom, is a sink; and in one corner a freezer hums quietly to
 itself.

 The floor is seamless bar a square of plexiplastic.

>open freezer


 A blast of cold air hits you from inside. You open the freezer,
 revealing a shelf of food and a frozen biosamples.

>examine genus e


 You skim along the row and locate the sample for Genus E. Its full
 name is written on the top: edisonia.

>open genus e


 That's not something you can open.

>eat genus e


 (first taking the genus E sample)
 You've no idea if they're safe to touch, even if they are sealed.

>go down


 The lights flick on as you enter the cellar.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement</span>
 The basement is lit by striplamps crisscrossed across the plastic
 ceiling, and is the only truly grubby room in the building. The floor
 is caked with dust and what even looks like soil; no doubt actually
 decomposing rubbish from various plants stored here over the years.
 The other clear thing about this room is that it's half the width it
 used to be - though the ceiling continues back there is a gleaming
 white wall in the way, in the centre of which is a large, forbidding
 door. It leads into the laboratory.

 Steps lead upward on one side.

 On one wall is the bubble thermostat.

 Cooling in a corner is a black chest.

 The porch is just a short space of corridor, with two large fans built
 into the walls behind a white-mesh grille. The air is a little better
 regulated here, and smells fresh and tart, straight from an
 algae-tank. There is little else here - a rack for shoes and a hook
 for coats. Either end of this space are the large doors that seal
 inside from outside, they are east and west respectively.

 On the shoe rack are a pair of lady's shoes.

 "Is this alright?" asks the young cop. "Do you need the lights lower,
 or incense, or something?"

 "This is fine. I just need to see him, ask some questions."

 "Okay," he nods. "Just buzz the buzzer when you're done." He leaves,
 pulling the metal door to with the click of a magnetic lock. Across
 the table from you the man stiffens, waiting for you to speak.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">INSIGHT</span>
 An interactive investigation, by Jon Ingold (c) 2003
 Type HELP for brief instructions.
 Release 4 / Serial number 030209 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Interview Room</span>
 The six walls are metal. This is a box in which nothing happens but
 people talk, and fans whir air in and out to help the words move
 along. By the door in the north wall is a small red button that rings
 the buzzer for the guard, and it's smart enough to know who's pushing.
 This isn't a place people leave of their own accord, and they rarely
 come here that way either.

 The man across the table from you is no different. His eyes are
 sagging from lack of sleep, and he is sweating just a little even
 though the air is regulated to be cold.

>about


 -- "about" isn't a recognised verb.

>kiss man


 You are not that sort of information-gatherer.

>ask man about crime


 "Poison, did they say? I have a lab, it could have been anything." He
 is jittery, his face twitching. "She might have eaten one of my bulbs
 or something. I don't know why it's being called a <span class="floydstyle em">murder</span>."

>ask man about glass


 His language is something you only started learning two weeks ago,
 when this crime was reported and he was put on the ship back home.
 You're still sufficiently rusty that there are some things (such as
 that) you still do not know how to say.

>ask man about fingerprints


 "Yes," he whines. "It's a fingerprint lock on my print, yes, that's
 true. I don't know how she got in, but she must have. There's a lot of
 chemicals inside. I don't know how!"

 It is a little difficult to follow the man's speech. His accent is
 thick, and the language is still unfamiliar.

>prompt man


 "Yes," he whines. "It's a fingerprint lock on my print, yes, that's
 true. I don't know how she got in, but she must have. There's a lot of

 Your language skills are deficient, such that you cannot come up with

 shivers a little. "Not the only plants with spines, of course," he
 adds.

 and Amerimexican. I doubt native Marsian will survive myself." His
 face has gone quite stony. "The only thing's that kept them away this
 long are the climate problems - the duststorms - and my company is
 fixing those."

 anything from in there."

>ask man about jasper


 "Why are you even bothering to ask? Morpheus, that damn sample box...
 I don't believe you, you know. I don't know how you're doing it -
 spies or police or..."

 He stops, quite suddenly, a shallow smile moving over his face. "Of
 course. Your spy. This is all rubbish, isn't it? You know because you
 are Jasper Morpheus and you sent her that damn box yourself. Of
 course," he continues, now nodding madly, convinced of his fantasies.
 "This isn't a police station at all, is it? You're not a Genetic at
 all! This is all just political! You think the only way you can get
 your hands on Knassion now that Laura's not around to pick my pocket
 is to get it out of me. Well you won't. If I killed her for it than
 I'm sure as hell not going to just hand it over to you." His eyes
 narrow. "You can do what you like." And he leans back, face in a
 snarl.

 straight."

 The door opens briefly and the guard appears. "Brought you some tea,
 sir," he says politely, and brings a mug over to put on the table. The
 man looks startled by this appearance and is offered nothing himself.
 The guard leaves with a nod and a click of a magnetic lock.

>ask man about murder


 "So I dipped a cactus spine in a little solution that was lying
 around, and placed it into her shoe for when she went out. Then I
 removed it before calling the police along."

 if I hadn't spoken!"

>press button


 "Thank you, Mackenzie. That'll be all." You stand, and go over to
 press the buzzer. He looks up at you, his eyes flashing. "This is
 insane. I'm lying!" he shouts suddenly to the cameras. "I'm just
 stringing him along! You can't convict me on it!"

 You shrug. "Which of us is more insane, Doctor? Me, for believing I
 read minds, or you, for killing your wife so easily for the sake of a
 desert?"

 The door slides open and the guard is there. "Thank you, sir," he says
 formally. "I believe that's all."

 "Yes, you do," is the reply.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">EUPD Foyer</span>
 The foyer of the EUPD is a wide expanse of functional metal; every
 wall inlaid with panels, displays, buzzers and listings of the
 voluminous amounts of relevant and irrelevant information generated by
 a building this size and an organisation this complex. Of course,
 complex organisations are much easier for your purposes.

 In front of you is the main door of the building, outside which lies
 the street.

>out


 The door will not open until it recognises your fingerprint.

 A young man walks past with a cop. "Is it true?" he is saying. "Or do
 they just research it and guess, like at a circus or something?" You
 smile at the foolish question.

>touch door


 You touch your finger to the lock. It grows gently warm as it reads
 your print, then the door the swings open. A clipped automated voice
 says: "Have a nice evening, Jackson Roberts". You cannot help but tip
 your head in reply as you step outside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Street</span>
 The street is fairly quiet for London, with a gentle background buzz
 of traffic and pedestrians. Luckily you will have to go no distance in
 this foul city, as the car is already here, parked right out front.

>enter car


 You open the car door and slip inside. "Good evening," you say to the
 driver, who rolls away from the kerb as the door clicks shut. "Back to
 the office."

 "Very good, Mr. Morpheus," he replies.

 The drive is uneventful; you are dropped outside your building and
 make your way through the maze of corridors until you reach your
 current - hopefully temporary - room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Your Office</span>
 The corridor runs off in both directions, but room 42 is directly to
 the east.

>go east


 (opening the office door first)
 You touch your finger to the lock. It grows gently warm as it reads
 your print, then falls cold with a flat honk. Your fingerprint has not
 been read.
 So you can't go that way.

>knock


 -- What do you want to knock?

>knock on door


 You bash on the door, but it doesn't budge.

 You are carrying:
   a plexilatec fingercap on your index finger

>examine fingercap


 One thin layer of sculpted plexilatecover your index finger.

>remove cap


 You carefully peel off Jackson Roberts' index finger.

 You touch your finger to the lock. It grows gently warm as it reads
 your print, and the door clunks heavily.

>go east


 (opening the office door first)
 You open the office door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Office</span>
 Your office is small, and quite sparse, with nothing but a desk by the
 large window which overlooks this ghastly city. It is equipped with a
 little bathroom - you made sure of that before taking it - it lies to
 the north.

 On the desk is a scrawled sheet.

 The door locks quietly behind you.

>read paper


 A sheet of paper covered in scribbles - nothing coherent, but not
 exactly doodles; rather fragments of letters and words and scattered
 at all angles around the edges and middle of the page, with the
 occasional snatch of a drawn line or a distorted margin. It has been
 carefully laser-printed from a computer image.

>take paper


 Taken.

>go north


 (opening the bathroom door first)
 You open the bathroom door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Small Bathroom</span>
 The small bathroom is empty and very rarely used. The only thing here
 not provided by the cleaners was, of course, the cabinet you brought
 in yourself. The door to the office is south.

 On one wall is your own reflection, sketched onto the surface of a
 cabinet with an oil-mirror surface.

>examine reflection
>turn dial to picasso


 The cabinet is adorned with your features, only transformed into an
 oil painting, currently following the style of Schulz, leaving you
 with a simplistic vacant look across your face. A small dial
 underneath allows this to be readjusted.



 The dial clinks into place at Picasso and the picture shifts
 appropriately.

>look at paper in mirror


 You close the door first.

 Holding the paper up to the mirror, it takes a little adjustment
 before the fragments of words and letters solidify into lines of text.
 "JM - Delivery from Mars received, placed in desk drawer. Crime
 occurred too late. We have our sample - PK."

 You open the mirrored cabinet.

 (opening the bathroom door first)
 You open the bathroom door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Office</span>
 Your office is small, and quite sparse, with nothing but a desk by the
 large window which overlooks this ghastly city. It is equipped with a
 little bathroom - you made sure of that before taking it - it lies to
 the north.

>open desk


 You grip the handle, hear the lock click back at your print, and slide
 it open. The drawer has got a key and a black box in it.

>open box with key


 (first taking the key)
 Are you certain? Mackenzie good as said he found it; opened it. Would
 he let Knassion fall into your hands? Of course you might have been
 wrong on that - maybe he never opened the box, never picked the lock,
 and got wind of his wife some other way. Your decision. Make it now.
 Unlock it - or leave it sealed, and close up the drawer again.

>open box with key


 No. Your spy did her work, clearly. Mackenzie knew he'd lost the
 sample and was lying to you. Something you'd never fall for -
 mind-reading or no. You slip the key into the lock, and flick open the
 casket.

 There is not enough time between the opening of the lid and the
 explosion of pollen into your face to look away. Three hours later you
 are regretting that gap of time, as you stare into the mirror,
 watching the oil-paint running down your face as it burns and scars.
 One miscalculation, that was all. One error, one gamble that you knew
 what he was thinking, and you got it wrong. And then Jasper Morpheus
 falls.

 Simple enough. You know Mackenzie opened the box. Jasper Morpheus did
 not get to his position on skill alone, but natural born talent too.
 Science may have engineered the psychics first in lab-rats then in
 men, but nature alone did the work on you. There are only nine men
 with your power, and each one sits around the same table back in the
 US. The box opens and pollen-dust melts at your skin. So - save it for
 the next time a removal is needed.

 And, of course, Mars will come to you, eventually. You are not about
 to take a mis-step.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">    *** You do not get the sample ***</span>



 Would you like to RESTART or QUIT?

 "Shall we move on this, sir?"

 You consider a moment... then shake your head. "No. It's too
 uncertain." You look up at the other man. "Mackenzie is having a
 laboratory fitted into his house in two months time. He and his wife
 will take that weekend away on holiday. The house will be empty apart
 from workmen. I'll go myself."

 "Morpheus, we have agents..."

 "We have no-one who can be relied upon to get it right first time,"
 you reply sternly.

 The journey through space is uneventful; the landing in Olympia is
 five minutes of hellish burnslow freefall. The Marsian sky is more
 slate, more rock-like than you have ever imagined. Soon you arrive.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Bubble 4563</span>
 You have walked here, all the way from the spaceport. The air is dry
 and cold, you wrap your coat tighter and breathe with a little
 difficulty. The low sun makes the red dust glow like amber into the
 distance. Mackenzie's bubble is to the east, its door closed. The road
 leads right up to it, with no front garden.

 Parked by the purple-leaved bush that lines the track is a large
 truck.

 A workman holding a large sheet of plexiplastic unlocks the door with
 a keycard and slips through. It closes after him, the light on the
 lock still green.

>get bush


 You pluck a leaf from the bush with a thick snap. In response the
 branch moves backwards, far more than just a recoil, curling up into
 itself. The movement seems to disrupt other branches, sparking a wave
 that travels down the hedgerow in an uncoordinated squirm of fauna. It
 is several minutes before it is still once more; by then the leaf in
 your hand has leaked a fine sap as far as your wrist.

>examine truck


 On the side is stencilled: AlgCorp FACILITIES MANAGMENT.

>go east


 You push open the door and step into the porch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Porch</span>
 The porch is just a short space of corridor, with two large fans built
 into the walls behind a white-mesh grille. The air is a little better
 regulated here, and smells fresh and tart, straight from an
 algae-tank. There is little else here - a rack for shoes and a hook
 for coats. Either end of this space are the large doors that seal
 inside from outside, they are east and west respectively.

 The inner door hisses closed just as you enter.

>go east


 You open the door with a soft hiss, and go through into the hallway.
 The lights inside come on automatically.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway of Mackenzie's home is bare but homely, one wall hung with
 a photograph of some Earth lake surrounded by mountains, and an
 antiquated-looking coat-stand by the porch door to the west. Doorways
 lead off in two other directions; the east appears to be a kitchen and
 the north is a living room. There is no upstairs in the house; the
 entire upper metre or so is filled solid with various forms of algae,
 to grow oxygen, regulate temperature and recycle waste.

 In one corner is a stubby yucca tree.

 From the kitchen you hear someone moving around.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is largely uninteresting - a small functional room, a
 laboratory of life, with the various implements of cooking arranged
 around the walls. For all the advances in materials over the last
 thousand years; roasting, baking and boiling still work as before.
 Just with the addition of microwave generators and plasmacoil hobs.

 So against the northwest wall, is a sink; and in one corner a freezer
 hums quietly to itself.

 The floor is seamless bar a square of plexiplastic.

 A workman is crouched on the floor, and he looks up and stares at you.
 "Who are you?" he demands. You turn to leave, but the workman is
 determined to make sure he helps you on your way. You hit the dust as
 you are thrown through the front door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lounge</span>
 The living room is similarly austere, with its walls all white and
 furniture resting in between large spaces. In the north wall opposite
 the doorway is a large window through which the long view of desert
 stretches until reaching the tooth of Mount Olympus, and the room is
 filled by the orange-red tinge. Another door leads east to the
 bedroom.

 In one corner is a long desk.

 On the desk is a glass of water.

 The sofa stands out quite strikingly; it is pea-green.

 The man sat on the sofa looks up. "Jack..." he begins, but the word
 dies. "Who the hell are you?" He proves to be a big man, when he
 stands and grabs you by the shoulder. Your stealth operation ends as
 you are escorted from the house.

 From the kitchen you hear a workman and a powertool.

 The tree is fairly bulky.

 In the living room, you hear a man stand. You tense, but then an

>examine glass


 (the north window)
 The dunes are brushed with a delicate haze of floating orange dust
 like the steam rising from a Spaniard's tanned back; still but for the
 sporadic storms that whip across the sky unchecked and unpredictable.
 It is dotted with a few strange plants - wide trunked cacti, large
 flat leaved palms that spread across the ground instead of upwards
 into the sky, and grass stalks that rise and bend flat at two metres
 high. Most are unfamiliar to your eye.

 From the centre of the bubble your hear a toilet flush.

>examine glass of water


 It looks ordinary enough.

>take glass

 That's not portable.

 From the south you hear the other workman moving through the hallway.
 The door of the bubble seals with a hiss behind him.

 piping of the bubble sucks water from the toilet. However, he goes no
 further than the sofa.

 The trapdoor is already open.

>open freezer


 A blast of cold air hits you from inside. You open the freezer,
 revealing a shelf of food and some frozen biosamples.

>examine biosamples


 Thirteen frozen biosamples stacked up on the top shelf of the freezer,
 happily coexisting with a frozen pizza and a chicken. They are
 labelled "GENUS A" through "GENUS N".

>examine food


 On the bottom shelf: bricklike slabs of pale stone. On the top: bright
 yellow biosample bags.

 The lights flick on as you enter the cellar.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement</span>
 The basement is lit by striplamps crisscrossed across the plastic
 ceiling, and is the only truly grubby room in the building. The floor
 is caked with dust and what even looks like soil; no doubt actually
 decomposing rubbish from various plants stored here over the years.
 The other clear thing about this room is that it's half the width it
 used to be - though the ceiling continues back there is a gleaming
 white wall in the way, in the centre of which is a large, forbidding
 door. It leads into the laboratory.

 Steps lead upward on one side.

 On one wall is the bubble thermostat.

 Mackenzie will live to see the first wave of colonisation.
