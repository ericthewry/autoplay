 so the first release includes room 18, the second will include room 17
 and 18, the third includes 16, 17, and 18, and so on. All released
 rooms are available at [<a href=".">LINK</A>]

 This release is Room 16. This is near the end of Yesenia's journey,
 but it's just a short way into yours.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>
 Tourists move down the steps toward Cabrillo Pavilion in long waves,
 unconsciously mimicking the ocean beyond. Yesenia loiters awkwardly at
 the sidewalk's edge and pretends to be fascinated by the fat little
 palm trees, the blue sign reading ZOO with its arrow, or anything else
 that will keep her face away from pedestrians.

 Yesenia turns at the distant roar of a bus. The familiar white body
 with its upper yellow stripe comes around the bend, and she reads 20
 Carpinteria with relief. The crowd at the bus stop shuffles around,
 and Yesenia queues up to board, rolling the flowered suitcase behind
 her.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">20 to Carpinteria</span>
 It's like any other MTD bus: bluish-gray plastic seats crowded with
 passengers, huge windows, and an array of silver poles and black
 straps for standing passengers. No one's standing right now, though.

 The driver taps the fare box and gives Yesenia a meaningful look.

 Yesenia braces her suitcase against her leg.


 Yesenia digs hurriedly through her pockets and comes up with two
 crumpled singles.


 Yesenia can't see any such thing.


 Yesenia flattens the two singles against the fare box and then feeds
 them into the machine. The fare box chimes its approval.

 The driver says, "No change," and points at the sign that says the
 same thing.

 Yesenia says, "That's fine," and she hefts her suitcase and moves
 further in so the next person can pay. There are still a few seats
 free: one at the front behind the driver (occupied by a newspaper),
 one in the middle across from the rear door, and one at the very back.


 It's a folded copy of the Santa Barbara News-Press. Yesenia could see
 the articles if she unfolds it.

 The last two passengers pay and board.


 Yesenia picks up the folded newspaper.

 The bus pulls away from the curb. Yesenia shifts her weight to
 compensate and puts a hand on one of the silvery poles.


 Yesenia takes the back seat.

 The bus picks up speed as it chugs along.


 Yesenia unfolds the newspaper fully and holds it in front of her
 faceSince she's sitting in the back, she only has to angle her body
 and raise the newspaper to hide her face entirely. That worked out
 well.

 A portly man in his mid-forties opens up his iPad and starts listening
 to the news. Yesenia can tell that he's listening to the news because
 he's not using headphones, in clear violation of the bus policy sign.


 Yesenia skims the newspaper, but she doesn't really want to read about
 the cleanup cost of the Santa Barbara oil spill. It's too depressing.

 The iPad says, "There was a disturbance today at the Santa Barbara
 Zoo, when a masked woman confronted a group of schoolchildren. KEYT
 reporter Vanessa Ellis is on the scene. Vanessa, over to you."

 Yesenia's heart drops like a brick. If there's footage....

 The bus rumbles through a pothole.


 Yesenia says, "Excuse me, would you mind turning that off?"

 The portly man frowns at her. "Yes, yes I would. It's a free country."

 The iPad says, "Thank you, Brandon! I'm at the Santa Barbara Zoo,
 where a group of schoolchildren were about to board their bus when a
 masked woman attempted to take them hostage."

 The bus slows down before entering a traffic circle.


 It isn't something Yesenia can switch.

 The iPad says, "Witnesses describe the woman as five-five, dressed in
 white and lavender, with a crown of flowers in her hair.  The pending
 catastrophe was averted when a bystander engaged her in hand-to-hand
 combat, giving students and teachers a chance to escape."

 The bus swings majestically out onto Coast Village Road.


 Yesenia wonders how much of her is visible behind the newspaper. How
 much of this worry is paranoia? How much do they need to see, to
 recognize her? There are thousands of people in Santa Barbara with her
 build, her height, and her coloration - but none of the others happen
 to be on the bus just now.

 The iPad says, "One of the teachers, Katie Edwards, captured part of
 their encounter. We'll show you that footage now."

 The bus pulls to a stop in accordance with traffic regulations.

>examine crown

 Yesenia can't see any such thing.

>kiss man

 The portly man might not like that.

 The iPad marvels, "Will you look at that!"

 The bus rumbles back into motion.


 If only she could! But the man's holding his iPad out of the sunlight,
 to avoid glare on the screen.

 The iPad says, "It's quite an impressive sight." After a pause, it
 continues, "Both the masked woman and the intervening bystander fled
 the scene before the police could arrive."

 The bus picks up speed as it merges onto the freeway.

>man, kiss me

 The portly man has better things to do.

 The iPad says, "Anthony Torres was here with his daughter, and they
 saw the entire exchange. Anthony, what did you see?"

 Despite the air conditioning, several of the windows are cracked open,
 and there's enough wind to whip Yesenia's hair across her face.


 (<span class="floydstyle em">To speak with someone, use the command TALK TO.)</span>

 The iPad says, "It was The Hyacinth. I'm sure of it. I study these
 things. She normally stomps around Miami, but she's come to California
 for some reason."

 The bus exits the freeway and turns left over the bridge.


 Yesenia smells sunscreen, sea winds, diesel, and industrial
 antiseptic. Some of these are more pleasant than others..

 The iPad says, "What about the woman who stopped the attack?"

 The bus stops to pick up a few more passengers and then rumbles back
 into motion.


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>listen

 It's loud, both from the bus's steady roar and the chatter of
 passengers..

 The iPad answers, "She was just a bitty thing, but she picked The
 Hyacinth up and threw her like a stuffed elephant. She was knocking
 her all over the parking lot. The Hyacinth knocked her down a few
 times, but she just got right back up. She must've had powers of her
 own."

 The manicured lawns of Toro Canyon pass the bus windows and vanish
 again.

>listen

 It's loud, both from the bus's steady roar and the chatter of
 passengers..

 The iPad says in a little kid's voice, "It was pretty scary."

 A recorded voice announces, "Real and Sandpiper," and the bus stops to
 let the heavyset woman off before lurching back into motion.

>listen

 It's loud, both from the bus's steady roar and the chatter of
 passengers..

 The iPad says, "Thank you, Anthony. Brandon, back to you."

 Yucca and palms and carefully clipped shrubbery yield to the
 fantastically painted bridge railing outside Kim's Market.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Let's look at the current state of the Santa Barbara
 County oil spill."

 The bus has reached Carpinteria proper, and the bus begins to empty as
 more people get off at each stop.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Kevin Reese Dolman, aka Surgical Strike, has publicly
 repented his act of terrorism and joined the cleanup efforts alongside
 Angelina Manatee. More than 44% of the coastline is now clear, thanks
 primarily to the efforts of regular volunteers."

 Yesenia sees her stop coming up, and she presses the yellow strip. The
 bus chimes and announces, "Stop requested."


 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "When asked about the experience of working with her
 former nemesis, Manatee said...." but the bus rolls to a stop, and
 Yesenia misses the sound bite as she heads for the door.

 Yesenia hefts her suitcase down from the bus. It's about three minutes
 from the bus stop to her apartment, and she takes the distance
 briskly, stopping only once to shove windblown hair out of her eyes.

 About halfway there, she realizes that she doesn't have her purse.
 <span class="floydstyle em">¡Carajo!</span> She tries to think back to when she last had it.,
 and she realizes it must have been in the restaurant office. She'll
 have to ask Camilla for a ride once she gets home.

 There's an easy cut across the grass, but Yesenia takes the sidewalk
 instead, with the suitcase rolling along behind her. She rounds the
 corner of the building and starts up the front walk.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tradewind Apartments - Front Walk</span>
 A wide concrete walkway leads around the three-story building and up
 to the front door, flanked by ground lights on both sides, which shine
 in response to the setting sun. On the right, regimentally spaced palm
 trees provide an illusion of privacy for the west-facing windows. On
 the left, there's a parking lot for the apartment, but since the
 divider is all of six inches wide, the parked cars in the first row
 rest their noses against the walkway.

 Yesenia parks her suitcase beside the building's front door.

 There's a bank of resident mailboxes set into the outer wall, just to
 the right of the front door. The doorbells are on the other side.


 Yesenia can't see any such thing.


 The mailbox is locked.  Yesenia will have to unlock it first.

>examine hyacinth

 Yesenia can't see any such thing.


 Yesenia reaches automatically for her mailbox key, but of course she
 doesn't have her keys. Because she doesn't have her purse. Because
 it's in the restaurant.

 But... she pauses to consider the angles of the sun. There's still
 sunlight touching the mailbox, which means she could open it with
 sufficient <span class="floydstyle i">focus</span>. And it wouldn't be the first time she's
 opened the mailbox without a key.


 Shielded from sight by the building and a palm tree, Yesenia stretches
 her awareness to the setting sun. The orange light warms her, just as
 it warms the mailbox.

 The sun has power over the mailbox; its heat can make the metal
 expand. Its absence can make the metal shrink. And <span class="floydstyle em">she</span> has
 power over....

 Yesenia focuses. The tumblers click into the unlocked position, and
 she pulls it open.


 Yesenia pulls the mail out of her mailbox. Among the advertisements
 and junk mail (promptly discarded into a convenient recycling bin),
 she discovers three white envelopes.


 According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara
 three days ago.

 Yesenia rips open the first envelope, revealing a letter.


 According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara
 two days ago.

 Yesenia rips open the second envelope, revealing a letter.


 According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara
 one day ago.

 Yesenia rips open the third envelope, revealing a letter.


 (the first letter)
 Yesenia unfolds the first letter.

 It's typed in simple serif letters.

 <span class="floydstyle em">We need to talk. Call me - </span>

 and a number that Yesenia doesn't recognize. There's a 305 area code,
 though, and that's the Miami area.


 (the second letter)
 Yesenia unfolds the second letter.

 It's typed in simple serif letters.

 <span class="floydstyle em">I'm trying to help you. You don't have to hide from me.</span>


 (the third letter)
 As Yesenia unfolds the letter, a playing card falls to the ground.

 At the sight of it, Yesenia's stomach clenches, and goose bumps
 prickle across her shoulders.

 It's typed in simple serif letters.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Call me, or I'm coming to see you</span>.


 Yesenia picks up the playing card.


 It's a standard playing card: paper coated with plastic, with a blue
 design on the back.

 Yesenia turns it over. As she expected, it's the Jack of Spades -
 which means the Jack of Shadows.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Chris</span>, she thinks, and glances around apprehensively. Is
 Chris already here? She always drives, because she hates the bus....
 .


 Yesenia scans the parking lot again, taking her time. She doesn't know
 what Chris is driving these days, but she knows it'll be a cut above
 the norm.

 And it is - a sleek, matte black car with a T-shaped logo on its nose,
 sitting three cars down and barely a centimeter off the walkway. The
 large black crystals hanging off the rearview mirror seal her
 suspicions.


 (the sleek black car)
 Yesenia takes a deep, centering breath and then slams her foot into
 the black car's front bumper. She's reserving her strength; after all,
 there's no need to punt it across the parking lot, and there would be
 awkward questions if she did.

 The car launches an strenuous protest, flashing its lights wildly,
 shrilling an alarm, and honking its horn - not polite little beeps,
 but bewildered, angry blares. If Chris is anywhere around, that should
 get her attention.


 (the sleek black car)
 Yesenia considers kicking the pretty black car again, but she decides
 against it. Someone might see her do it, and the car is already upset
 enough.

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.


 Time passes.

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

 There's a sudden clatter from the apartment building, and then Chris
 explodes from within.

 Chris is tall and well-coiffed, as always, but her brown eyes are wide
 with rage, and if she has a perfect manicure today, it's concealed by
 her clenched fists. "What the hell are you doing? What the
 <span class="floydstyle em">hell</span> are you doing to my <span class="floydstyle em">car</span>?"

 "Getting your attention," Yesenia says. "It seems to have worked."

 (<span class="floydstyle em">To speak with Chris, TALK TO CHRIS.)</span>


 Yesenia steps into Chris and then drops to execute a leg sweep.  Chris
 ducks around the blow.

 Chris says in an aggrieved tone, "Knock it off!"

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.


 Yesenia lunges for Chris and throws an elbow toward her face.  Chris
 dodges sideways.

 Chris exclaims, "I didn't come here to fight!"

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.


 Yesenia pivots toward Chris and then drops to execute a leg sweep.
 Chris fends her off, though not without difficulty.

 Chris exclaims, "Knock it off!"

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.


 Yesenia says, "You need to leave. Now."

 Instead of answering, Chris glances west to the setting sun. It's so
 familiar a gesture that it makes Yesenia's heart ache, and for a
 second she even forgets what it means. But Chris is the Jack of
 Shadows....

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.


 Yesenia reaches her mind toward the sun. It's setting rapidly, but
 there's still enough light... and she seizes that light and focuses
 upon Chris. She doesn't want to hurt her - but she closes her power
 all around her. There's just enough vibration leaking through for
 Chris to know what's happening.

 Chris freezes immediately. "Think about what you're doing," she says
 in a tight voice.

 "I thought about it," Yesenia says. "And I want you to go away. And
 leave me alone. <span class="floydstyle em">Now.</span>" She waits a few breaths longer, to make
 sure Chris gets the point, and then releases the power.

 Chris glares at her, but then she goes to the car. A door handle
 extrudes as Chris reaches for it, and she gets inside the car.

 Yesenia watches the sleek black car back up, and she watches it leave
 the parking lot, and she keeps watching until it vanishes down the
 road.


 The front door has been propped open with a rock, but there's no one
 in sight. Yesenia kicks it out of the way - why doesn't anyone
 understand security around here? - and swings her suitcase into the
 familiar darkness of her apartment building. Two flights of stairs
 later, she reaches the door to her apartment.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tradewinds Apartments - Hallway</span>
 During the day, the hallway's cool shadows provide relief from the
 California sun. But at night, it's simply dark, because the scattered
 wall sconces aren't close enough or bright enough to provide decent
 illumination.  It couldn't be a better environment for the Jack of
 Shadows if someone had planned it that way. Yesenia never realized
 that before, and she feels sick at the idea.

 The door of Yesenia's apartment stands wide open. There's a folded
 note taped to it.


 Yesenia peels the note off the door.


 It's a plain white piece of paper, folded into thirds. Illegible black
 marker has smudged through from the inside.


 There's a muffled sound from within the apartment, and Yesenia calls
 Camilla's name as she crosses the threshold at speed.



     *** It could have been so much worse.

 There's a standard fare box beside the driver's seat.

 The bus driver waits for Yesenia to pay her fare.


 The bus driver is wearing a distinctly non-uniform jean jacket over a
 button-down shirt. Her expression conveys the boredom of a thousand
 summers spent driving up and down US-101.

 The bus driver says, "Come on, you're holding up the line."

>ask driver about fare

 (<span class="floydstyle em">To speak with someone, use the command TALK TO.)</span>

 A heavyset woman in a pale blue shirt pushes past Yesenia. She drops
 two bus tokens in, paying for Yesenia's fare as well as her own.
 "There. Go sit down," she says impatiently.

 There are still a few seats free: one at the front behind the driver
 (occupied by a newspaper), one in the middle across from the rear
 door, and one at the very back.


 The bus driver interrupts her. "Honey, I got a bus to drive here,
 okay? Please don't distract me."

 The last two passengers pay and board.

 It's like any other MTD bus: bluish-gray plastic seats crowded with

 There are still a few unoccupied seats: one at the front behind the
 driver, one in the middle across from the rear door, and one at the
 very back.

 Yesenia's suitcase is braced against her leg so that it won't roll
 anywhere or fall over.

 The bus pulls away from the curb. Yesenia shifts her weight to
 compensate and puts a hand on one of the silvery poles.


 Yesenia picks up the folded newspaper.

 A couple people glance at Yesenia, likely because she's standing when
 there's room to sit.

 The bus picks up speed as it chugs along.


 Yesenia takes the front seat.

 A portly man in his mid-forties opens up his iPad and starts listening
 to the news. Yesenia can tell that he's listening to the news because
 he's not using headphones, in clear violation of the bus policy sign.


 It's a folded copy of the Santa Barbara News-Press. Yesenia could see

 The bus picks up speed as it merges onto the freeway.

 The portly man suddenly swivels in his chair to stare at Yesenia. He
 squints at his iPad again and then squints at her unshielded face.
 "Hey! That's you!"


 Yesenia says, "Please, keep your voice down."

 The iPad says, "Anthony Torres was here with his daughter, and they
 saw the entire exchange. Anthony, what did you see?"

 Despite the air conditioning, several of the windows are cracked open,
 and there's enough wind to whip Yesenia's hair across her face.

 The portly man says, "You're a hero! The press want to talk to you!"


 Yesenia says, "I don't want any attention."

 The iPad says, "It was The Hyacinth. I'm sure of it. I study these
 things. She normally stomps around Miami, but she's come to California
 for some reason."

 The bus exits the freeway and turns left over the bridge.

 The portly man says, "Hey, everyone! That girl - she's a hero! She
 saved a bunch of kids from The Hyacinth this afternoon!"


 Yesenia says, "Please, don't do this."

 The iPad says, "What about the woman who stopped the attack?"

 The bus stops to pick up a few more passengers and then rumbles back
 into motion.

 One of the new passengers gives Yesenia a dirty look as he maneuvers
 around her flowered suitcase.

 Other people on the bus are taking notice now. "Doesn't The Hyacinth
 stay in Florida?" someone asks.


 There's no point any more. The entire bus is looking at her.

 The iPad answers, "She was just a bitty thing, but she picked The
 Hyacinth up and threw her like a stuffed elephant. She was knocking
 her all over the parking lot. The Hyacinth knocked her down a few
 times, but she just got right back up. She must've had powers of her
 own."

 The manicured lawns of Toro Canyon pass the bus windows and vanish
 again.

 The man's seatmate corroborates, "No, she's in town. Just saw it on
 the news."

 Yesenia hears someone dialing a cell phone, but she can't spot who's
 doing it - she just knows the sound came from the back of the bus.


 There's no point any more. The entire bus is looking at her.

 The iPad says in a little kid's voice, "It was pretty scary."

 A recorded voice announces, "Real and Sandpiper," and the bus stops to
 let the heavyset woman off before lurching back into motion.

 Everyone's chattering now and staring at Yesenia. Even the bus driver
 glances back in the rear view mirror. It's exactly the kind of
 attention she doesn't want.


 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Thank you, Anthony. Brandon, back to you."

 Yucca and palms and carefully clipped shrubbery yield to the
 fantastically painted bridge railing outside Kim's Market.

 Another passenger says, "I've got to call my sister about this!"


 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Let's look at the current state of the Santa Barbara
 County oil spill."

 The bus has reached Carpinteria proper, and the bus begins to empty as
 more people get off at each stop.

 No one on the bus cares about the Santa Barbara County oil spill.


 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Kevin Reese Dolman, aka Surgical Strike, has publicly
 repented his act of terrorism and joined the cleanup efforts alongside
 Angelina Manatee. More than 44% of the coastline is now clear, thanks
 primarily to the efforts of regular volunteers."

 Yesenia sees her stop coming up, and she presses the yellow strip. The
 bus chimes and announces, "Stop requested."

 A bleached blond in huge fuchsia sunglasses touches Yesenia's arm.
 "Don't look so <span class="floydstyle em">glum</span>, chica. Smile! You're a hero!"


 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "When asked about the experience of working with her
 former nemesis, Manatee said...." but the bus rolls to a stop, and
 Yesenia misses the sound bite as she heads for the door.

 Yesenia hefts her suitcase down from the bus. It's about three minutes
 from the bus stop to her apartment, and she takes the distance
 briskly, stopping only once to shove windblown hair out of her eyes.

 About halfway there, she realizes that she doesn't have her purse.
 <span class="floydstyle em">¡Carajo!</span> She tries to think back to when she last had it.,

 A flashbulb goes off in Yesenia's face. As she flinches back, a
 reporter lunges forward, accompanied by his camerawoman.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tradewind Apartments - Front Walk</span>
 A wide concrete walkway leads around the three-story building and up
 to the front door, flanked by ground lights on both sides, which shine
 in response to the setting sun. On the right, regimentally spaced palm
 trees provide an illusion of privacy for the west-facing windows. On
 the left, there's a parking lot for the apartment, but since the
 divider is all of six inches wide, the parked cars in the first row
 rest their noses against the walkway.

 There's a minor gaggle of photographers and reporters milling about on
 the front walk.

 Yesenia belatedly remembers to drop her suitcase. It almost falls
 over, but she catches it just in time.

 There's a bank of resident mailboxes set into the outer wall, just to
 the right of the front door. The doorbells are on the other side.

 One of the reporters asks her camera crew, "Are you getting this?"


 Yesenia shouts, "No comment! No comment!" and raises her newspaper to
 block her face from the flashbulbs.

 A cameraman circles around for a different angle.


 With the press here? She might as well write her media handle on her
 own forehead.

 One of the reporters asks his camera crew, "Are we losing the light?"


 Yesenia shouts, "No comment! No comment!" and raises her newspaper to
 block her face from the flashbulbs.

 A reporter shouts, "Are you the Sun Queen's protege?"

 Yesenia feels the blood drain from her face. "No comment," she
 manages.


 While Yesenia could focus on the enormous black camera, that would
 be... indiscreet. And she strives for discretion these days.

 Another flashbulb goes off in Yesenia's face.  Yesenia shields her
 face with her newspaper.


 Yesenia is no stranger to violence, but she doesn't see the need for
 it here.

 Another flashbulb goes off in Yesenia's face.  Yesenia shields her
 face with her newspaper.


 Yesenia kicks the rock out of the way and swings her suitcase into the
 familiar darkness of her apartment building. She shuts the door on the
 press, like shutting out an unwanted cat, but she can still hear their
 voices through the door.

 Their clamoring fades as she climbs the two flights of stairs leading
 to her apartment. It's been a very long day. It's good to come home,
 however briefly.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tradewinds Apartments - Hallway</span>
 During the day, the hallway's cool shadows provide relief from the
 California sun. But at night, it's simply dark, because the scattered
 wall sconces aren't close enough or bright enough to provide decent
 illumination. Still, this is home, and there's nothing more welcome to
 Yesenia right now than the sight of her own front door.

 There's a folded note taped to the door. Yesenia frowns at it.


 Yesenia peels the note off the door.

 Yesenia unfolds the note.


 Yesenia stares at the note. There's one sentence written on it in
 stark black marker.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Come on in.</span>

 It's not Camilla's handwriting.

 Yesenia hears footsteps and voices on the stairs - not the tired
 sounds of a neighbor, but the eager bumbling of the press. She curses
 her neighbors silently. Doesn't <span class="floydstyle em">anyone</span> care about security?
 Anyone at all?


 Yesenia reaches out to try the door, and the knob turns easily. Unease
 coils in her belly, and a familiar prickling runs down her arms.

 She pushes the door open.

 Yesenia can hear the press galumphing through the hallway below her.
 It's not as organized as a search-and-rescue, but it's likely to be
 fruitful very soon.


 She's about to cross the threshold when an all-too-familiar voice
 within says, "Welcome home."

 "Chris," Yesenia says. Ice forms in her gut, but her skin prickles
 with heat. "What are you doing here?" She bites back her next words -
 <span class="floydstyle em">What have you done to Camilla?</span>

 "Welcome home, Yesenia," the other woman says. "Or should I say..."

 "No," Yesenia says sharply, "you shouldn't." And she steps through the
 door.



 *** Too many mistakes in a very long day. Or maybe not
 enough....

 Time passes.

 Yesenia hears footsteps and voices on the stairs - not the tired
 sounds of a neighbor, but the eager bumbling of the press. She curses
 her neighbors silently. Doesn't <span class="floydstyle em">anyone</span> care about security?
 Anyone at all?


 Time passes.

 Yesenia can hear the press galumphing through the hallway below her.
 It's not as organized as a search-and-rescue, but it's likely to be
 fruitful very soon.


 Time passes.

 Yesenia hears the press galloping up the stairs to her floor.


 Time passes.

 A reporter reaches the top of the stairs, turns the corner, and spots
 Yesenia. "I found her!" she shouts to her cameraman, and the rest of
 the gaggle descends.

 Reporters are good at spotting blood in the water.  A reporter shouts,
 "Are <span class="floydstyle em">you</span>, in fact, the Sun Queen?"

 Yesenia feels the brief, mad temptation to shout, "Yes, yes, you found
 me!" but she resists the urge.


 Yesenia raises her hands toward the reporters and says in a loud,
 clear, voice, "You're trespassing. You need to leave this building
 before I call management."

 With a collective "awwww," the press shuffles back down the stairs.
 Yesenia stands listening until the door clicks behind the last of
 them.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tradewinds Apartments - Hallway</span>

 Yesenia reaches out to try the door, and the knob turns easily.

 It shouldn't be unlocked - <span class="floydstyle em">dammit, Camilla!</span> How many times do
 they have to have this conversation? Carp may be the home of surf, but
 that doesn't mean it's always going to be safe.

 She pushes the door open.

 Another flashbulb goes off in Yesenia's face.  Yesenia shields her
 face with her newspaper.


 She's about to cross the threshold when the air itself catches her in
 a vice grip. Several strangled cries of dismay come from behind her,
 and she realizes the reporters and camera crews are trapped, too.

 From within the apartment, Chris's all-too-familiar voice says, "Have
 you lost your mind for good? Why did you bring the <span class="floydstyle em">press</span>
 here?" The voice lowers. "You shouldn't have done this. You shouldn't
 have made this public. Now <span class="floydstyle em">you're</span> responsible for what I have
 to do." And the invisible grip jerks Yesenia across the threshold.



     *** And the Jack of Shadows succumbs to the dark.
