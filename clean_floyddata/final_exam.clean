 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom</span> (on the bed)
 You're in bed. The alarm didn't wake you. Something feels wrong. There
 is no light from the window, and your bedroom seems to be empty...

 [Enter HELP if you are unsure what to do now.]

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   an identity badge

>examine badge


 (first getting out of bed)
 A small plastic ID badge. The badge states: 'Candidate Number 28436'.

 Something is certainly wrong! Is this... part of the test? You never
 found out exactly what the final exam involved. Perhaps it is like
 this for every candidate.

>examine look


 You can't see any such thing.

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 This is very like the room you were assigned for this year's exam
 season. There are dozens of them in the Administration Centre's
 residential block, all more or less identical. But it cannot be your
 room, because all of your stuff is gone, and the room looks like it
 did when you first moved in. It's clean, tidy, and almost completely
 empty, just with basic furnishings: desk, chair, bed and washbasin.
 There's a window in the north wall and a door leads south.

>examine washbasin


 It's a small washbasin with a mirror above it. Your toothbrush and
 soap have gone, along with everything else.

>examine me


 You are a student of Administration theory. You think of yourself as
 fairly smart and attractive, reasonably charming, and certainly
 well-prepared for any exam.

>wash


 Congratulations on your excellent hygiene.

>sit on chair


 But you have an exam to pass!

 [You should go out; whatever is going on, you're not going to find any
 answers here.]

>open desk


 There are no drawers in the desk.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Final Exam</span> is a parser-based game. The basic idea is to type
 what you want to do and then see what happens. However, the game only
 understands a limited set of actions. If you find that the game
 doesn't understand you, try simplifying your command to a few words.
 If you're not making any progress, you can find some more suggestions
 on the author's website at [<a href="http://www.jwhitham.org/fnlexam/">LINK</A>]

 If you've explored as much as you can, but you're not sure what to do
 next, then you might try the 'HINT' command. You can also ask for a
 HINT about a specific object, e.g. HINT BED. Final Exam also has an
 'EXITS' command, which lists the compass directions that you can move
 in from your current location. The walkthrough (which is available
 from the author's website) includes some maps along with step-by-step
 instructions for completing the game.

>hint bed


 If there were any hints about the bed, you'd see them now. But the bed
 isn't important, so there are no hints about it.

 There's a window in the north wall and a door leads south.

>examine window


 Even at night, you'd expect to see something. The gardens of the
 Administration Centre, and beyond them, the amphitheatre, the hedge
 maze and ornamental lake, lit by street lights and moonlight. It never
 gets completely dark. But today, there's nothing at all. Just total
 blackness, as if there is a smooth black wall just beyond the window.

>out


 You walk through a few deserted corridors. There is nobody here; the
 building is completely silent. You cross the Administration Centre's
 quadrangle, also deserted, and end up in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 This is the main entrance to the sprawling Administration Centre.
 Large doors to the south would lead to the driveway and surrounding
 parkland, but you cannot see anything through the windows in the south
 wall. A grand staircase leads upwards. Doors lead east and west to the
 wings of the main building, while a smaller exit leads north to the
 quadrangle. There is a green door in the northwest corner of the room.
 There's a mural on the western wall, and a portrait and a mirror on
 the eastern wall.

 On the reception desk is a fax machine.

>examine machine


 It's on the reception desk, where it seems quite out of place next to
 the modern computer workstations. It's not a printer or a scanner:
 it's an old-fashioned fax machine that prints onto thin thermal paper.
 You notice some paper hanging out of the machine.

>examine door


 Which do you mean, the large doors or the green door?

>examine green door


 It's a small green door in the northwest corner of the room, under the
 staircase. The word 'MAINTENANCE' is written faintly on the door.
 The fax machine bleeps.

>examine paper


 Poor-quality paper from a fax machine. It reads:

 'Dear candidate 28436, please go upstairs to the Observation Gallery
 where you will find further instructions.'

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>enter mirror


 That's not something you can enter.

>examine mural


 The mural shows the construction of a gigantic Gothic cathedral by
 medieval craftsmen. The cathedral, which is half finished, is covered
 in both primitive scaffolding and workmen, each of whom is busily
 engaged in creating some small part of the whole. It is already a
 thing of great beauty on both a micro and macro scale, though it may
 be a century before the work is done. A tiny caption reads 'The
 Rebuilding of Civilisation'.

>examine mirror


 Somehow, your reflection looks older than you remember. The exam
 stress must be causing some premature aging!

 The wide staircase leads up to a mezzanine.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quadrangle</span>
 The quadrangle is completely surrounded by Administration Centre
 buildings. It's a large, square outdoor space with well-tended lawns
 and flowerbeds and paths leading in all directions. The place is
 unnervingly quiet. Though the buildings, paths and gardens are
 well-lit, the sky is completely black.

 There is a sundial in the centre of the quadrangle.

>go up


 As you walk up the stairs, you recall the first time you were here. It
 was a school trip when you were very young: a day out at the
 Administration Centre! You remember the sense of excitement at being
 so close to the great and powerful.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mezzanine</span>
 The first floor landing forms a mezzanine here, overlooking the lobby
 below. It's a sort of waiting room, placed right outside the Central
 Administrator's office, which is through the double doors to the west.
 A corridor leads east, and a grand staircase leads down. Like the rest
 of the building, the mezzanine is deserted, but if anyone was waiting
 here, they would be able to sit on the sofa and read the papers on the
 coffee table. Or they might look at the rather Administratively-themed
 artwork on the walls.

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Stability' on the north wall.

 On the coffee table are a memo and a newspaper.

>examine memo


 It is an internal memo from one of the Administration departments:

 'Following the recent expansion of the Sellafield data and power
 facility, the Simulation Department is pleased to announce that there
 will be a 25% increase in simulator availability from next month. A
 third data centre has been built on the Sellafield site, where it will
 benefit from highly cost-effective electricity. The Administration
 will have priority access to 50% of its computing power, the remainder
 being sold privately to finance the reactor upgrade. The increase will
 enable more detailed policy evaluations to be carried out.'

>examine newspaper


 It's one of the few newspapers that still has a printed edition,
 though for obvious reasons, this is an electronic copy. The front page
 story is all about an African dictator named Mugaffi. It is
 illustrated with pictures of children being treated for chemical burns
 outside a school. A few days ago, chemical weapons were used in the
 rebel city of Morgazi. 'Sources' blame Mugaffi's forces for the
 attack.

 According to the newspaper, this is the latest horrible incident of
 the full-blown civil war in Assadia. Though the protests against the
 corrupt Mugaffi regime began peacefully enough, the regime retaliated
 brutally - first with riot police, then with soldiers - and the
 situation rapidly escalated into war between rebels and regime forces.
 Last week, Mugaffi launched airstrikes against rebel-held cities. Now
 he uses chemical weapons against unarmed civilians, in contravention
 to all law, decency and sanity. But Mugaffi is afraid of the usual
 fate of deposed dictators, and he will do anything to cling to power.

 You recall that Assadia is an independent country outside of the
 Administration. As such, Mugaffi is free to do as he pleases, with no
 authority to restrain his gangster government. Strange, though, that
 the situation should have developed so quickly. You had thought that
 Mugaffi only won his presidency last year, as an anti-corruption
 candidate with much acclaim in the media, and was generally thought to
 be doing a good job in hard circumstances. But the newspaper reports
 imply that he's been in power for years.

>examine coffee table


 You see nothing special about the coffee table.

>l east


 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>examine sofa


 A large and comfortable leather sofa. You notice a book underneath the
 sofa.

>examine book


 The book is 'Notopia', by Perry Simm. Some of the book is a biography
 of the Central Administrator. But mostly, the book concerns how the
 Administration rose to power. The title refers to the Administration's
 approach to government, rejecting ideology and Utopian idealism, and
 focusing instead on stability and rational pragmatism. The result,
 according to the back cover, is 'the sort of society in which people
 would actually like to live'.

>examine artwork


 Which do you mean, the portrait of Edmund Burke or the twelve
 pictures?

>twelve


 There are twelve pictures, each representing a key advancement in the
 development of human civilisation as seen by the Administrators. Some
 are obvious, like the discovery of fire, and the development of
 writing and agriculture. Others are more controversial, such as the
 institutionalisation of religion and the English revolution of 1688.
 The most recent pictures show the development of the Internet and the
 creation of the Administration.

>take book

>examine portrait


 The painting hangs on the eastern wall. It is an enormous portrait of
 Edmund Burke, the 18th century writer and politician. The Central
 Administrator is said to be a fan.

>go west


 The doors are locked. In this building, office doors are usually keyed
 to the identity of the person who works there, so these doors will
 only open for the Central Administrator, unless he is already in the
 office. It seems that he is out.

>examine plaque


 It's one of three such plaques: the others are placed along the
 corridor to the east. Each briefly describes one of the three values
 of the Administration: Stability, Liberty, and Responsibility. Exams
 are highly likely to involve essays on interactions between the three,
 but it never hurts to revise a little more, so you read the
 description below the word:

 'Administrators have a duty to ensure that their government is stable,
 reliable and predictable, so that the freedoms and benefits enjoyed by
 subjects are unchanged from day to day, untouched by the chaos of
 civil disorder and economic turmoil. Policies with the potential to
 cause unrest, upheaval and conflict are considered dangerous, and
 Administrators are required to test all policies rigorously in
 simulation before deployment. As Pratchett wrote,

 'People believe they want justice and wise government but, in fact,
 what they really want is an assurance that tomorrow will be very much
 like today.'

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor turns a corner here, continuing to the north and west.

 to the south, a short staircase leads downwards to a darkened room.

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Liberty' on the north wall.

  east to the Security Administrator's Office.
  south to the Observation Gallery.
  west to the Mezzanine.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Observation Gallery</span>
 You are in a cavernous room built on the same vast scale as a concert
 hall. It cannot possibly fit within the buildings of the
 Administration Centre - the normal rules of geometry have clearly been
 bent here. You are standing in an observation gallery far above the
 floor, which is filled with concentric circles of workstation desks.
 All face the centre of the room, where another circular desk is placed
 on a raised platform. Above all of this, a huge three-dimensional
 globe hangs in empty space. The dim lighting in the room comes mainly
 from the planet, which glows with an internal light. To the north,
 stairs lead up to the landing.

 A display monitor hangs above the gallery. There's a message on the
 monitor.

 You saw this room on your first visit to the Administration Centre,
 all those years ago. It was even more awe-inspiring then: the room
 seemed even more gigantic, and at that time, it was full of people,
 all busily at work on the floor below. It felt like standing at the
 centre of the world. You knew this was the place you wanted to be.

>examine monitor


 The display is an enormous high-resolution flat-screen monitor,
 suspended from the gallery ceiling. It shows a message: green text on
 black background.

 '<span class="floydstyle i">Dear candidate 28436,</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You must be wondering where everyone has gone. Let me explain.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A serious situation has developed, and I have been forced to take</span>
 emergency steps to isolate the Administration Centre - and ourselves -
 from the outside world. This isolation prevents my communicating with
 you normally, and at present I can only do so via this screen. I will
 explain more in due course.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the meantime, I need you to obtain the emergency access card.</span>
 It's in the museum north of here. It allows you to enter the
 Maintenance Room, which is northwest of the Lobby. Then POKE
 702522351. Afterwards, please return here for further instructions.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Yours,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">Central Administrator.</span>'

>examine globe


 The 3D representation of Earth hangs in the centre of the room,
 suspended in empty space. It's a three-dimensional political map,
 highlighting countries and major cities, and it's tilted so that much
 of your view is filled with the European continent, where the
 countries of the First Settlement are shaded green. Across the
 Mediterranean Sea, much of Africa is shaded pink. The exception is the
 North African country of Assadia, which appears in yellow to indicate
 a major crisis.

>examine assadia


 Assadia is a North African country run by a vicious gangster named
 Mugaffi. The yellow colour indicates that a major crisis is happening
 there.

>examine africa


 That part of the world is independent from the Administration.

>examine first settlement


 The First Settlement countries were once the European Union - an
 unhappy federation in which very different countries with very
 different cultures were forced to fit together by those who favoured
 ideology over stability. The unstable and incompetent union stumbled
 from crisis to crisis until it eventually blundered into the one that
 finished it off for good. That was when the Administration took over.

>examine desks


 The Administrators do much of their work here. Each desk is assigned
 to some small region of the world, with physically adjacent regions
 occupying adjacent desks in this room. The workstations allow
 situations to be analysed, resources to be allocated, and
 Administration decisions to be sent to the outside world. The layout
 of the room makes it easy to coordinate with neighbours.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Museum of Pre-Administration Government</span>
 This is the Administration Centre's museum. It's a vast hall,
 stretching far away to the north and east. It is currently closed and
 in darkness. A red rope blocks passage to the north and east. Light is
 coming from the corridor to the south and faintly from a blank video
 screen just beyond the rope. Exhibition displays fill the room, most
 too far away into the dark to be readable.

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Responsibility' on the west wall.

 You can see a glass case containing an access card.

 You remember your first visit to the Administration Centre. The tour
 spent hours in the museum. Most of your classmates took little
 interest in it and were quickly bored. But you found it fascinating.
 Here in the centre of it all, literally within the corridors of power!
 What excitement, what possibility!

 'Administrators have a duty to nurture personal responsibility, as
 this is necessary to build a strong, lawful and liberal society. It is
 held that each adult person has free will and is responsible for his
 or her actions. As Burke wrote,

 'Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and
 appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there is within, the
 more there must be without.'

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Security Administrator's Office</span>
 This is the office of the Security Administrator. There is no sign of
 the Administrator or any other staff. The door leads west to the
 corridor. The office is furnished by a desk, sofa, a bookshelf, and a
 mural on the northern wall.

>examine mural


 The mural shows a dystopian cityscape of ugly skyscrapers and foul
 motorways. Miserable crowds mill around in the polluted, smoggy
 streets. The picture is intensely detailed, so you can even guess at
 what some of the people are doing, though none of them seem happy:
 miserable commuters, miserable criminals, miserable homeless people.
 Skyscrapers tower above them, adorned with the logos of credit cards
 and banks, and bearing the flags of failed governments. A tiny caption
 reads 'Where We Came From'.

 ('Notopia')
 The book is 'Notopia', by Perry Simm. Some of the book is a biography
 of the Central Administrator. But mostly, the book concerns how the
 Administration rose to power. The title refers to the Administration's
 approach to government, rejecting ideology and Utopian idealism, and
 focusing instead on stability and rational pragmatism. The result,
 according to the back cover, is 'the sort of society in which people
 would actually like to live'.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Observation Gallery</span>
 You are in a cavernous room built on the same vast scale as a concert
 hall. It cannot possibly fit within the buildings of the
 Administration Centre - the normal rules of geometry have clearly been
 bent here. You are standing in an observation gallery far above the
 floor, which is filled with concentric circles of workstation desks.
 All face the centre of the room, where another circular desk is placed
 on a raised platform. Above all of this, a huge three-dimensional
 globe hangs in empty space. The dim lighting in the room comes mainly
 from the planet, which glows with an internal light. To the north,
 stairs lead up to the landing.

 A display monitor hangs above the gallery.

 Administrator's office, which is through the double doors to the west.
 A corridor leads east, and a grand staircase leads down. Like the rest
 of the building, the mezzanine is deserted, but if anyone was waiting
 here, they would be able to sit on the sofa and read the papers on the

 coming from the corridor to the south and from a video screen just
 beyond the rope. Exhibition displays fill the room, most too far away
 into the dark to be readable.

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Responsibility' on the west wall.

 You can also see a glass case (which is empty) here.

>examine screen


 The video screen is showing a televised interview with the Central
 Administrator. He is wearing a dark suit, and even in this old
 recording, his hair has already started to turn grey. The sound is
 faint, but you can make out some of the discussion if you listen
 carefully.

>listen


 (to the video screen)
 The Central Administrator is speaking:

 '<span class="floydstyle i">...having committed themselves to so-called science-based</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">policies, these being policies tested by computer simulation, the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">intellectual class could not raise an objection when the simulators</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">produced answers they had not expected.</span>'

>listen


 (to the video screen)
 'Such as?' prompts the interviewer.

 '<span class="floydstyle i">I mean that the simulations favoured social policies that the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">intellectuals had regarded as conservative, old-fashioned and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">reactionary. The data clearly pointed at stability, liberty and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">personal responsibility as the key properties of a good society. The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">people had assumed that the machines would confirm their own beliefs</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">in globalism, socialism and so forth. They had never questioned those</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">beliefs, and indeed did not even think that their beliefs were</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">beliefs. The idea that the machine might come up with the 'wrong'</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">answer never occurred to them.</span>'

>listen


 (to the video screen)
 'This must have created some problems,' the interviewer remarks.

 '<span class="floydstyle i">Oh, well, some. But nothing greatly significant. The simulations</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">were quite repeatable. There were a few cases where independent</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">research got different answers, but these were discredited. I audited</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">their software and traced the differences to software bugs. Coding</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">errors. It turns out that humans are almost as bad at writing software</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">as they are at running a government!</span>'

 The interviewer laughs. 'Is there any link between the two?'

 '<span class="floydstyle i">I think so. Humans... well, all of us... struggle to deal with</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">complexity. When dealing with a complex system, like a country, or a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">large software program, the temptation is always to assume that you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">know enough to make an informed guess about what should be done. It is</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">a temptation that must be resisted. Everything must be thoroughly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">tested before it is allowed to 'go live'. You must do everything you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">can to avoid destabilising something that used to work.</span>'

>listen


 (to the video screen)
 'But were there protests?' presses the interviewer.

 '<span class="floydstyle i">Some people will disagree with government no matter what it does.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">That is fine. They may choose to complain, and we may choose to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">listen. I think, though, that one reason the intellectuals eventually</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">accepted the new system is that they found themselves in bad company.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">They now stood alongside deniers and conspiracy theorists, the same</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">people they had once mocked as 'wingnuts' and lunatics for denying the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">validity of simulation results. Ultimately, they came over to our side</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">out of embarrassment as much as anything. Pretended they had agreed</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">with us all along...</span>'.

>examine nearest display


 The nearest display is the only one you can read. It forms an
 introduction to the rest of the exhibition, and it's immediately clear
 that the theme of the museum has hardly changed since you last visited
 it. The museum presents the case against the pre-Administration
 approach to government, known here as 'populism'.

 The display bears a quotation from a political adviser regarding his
 own government's lack of forward planning. Like all Western
 governments of its time, that government was completely dominated by
 concerns about retaining popularity and good public relations. It had
 no policies as such; rather, it simply reacted to events, attempting
 to retain the favour of the press and the public.

 This was not limited to one policy area, to one party, or to one
 government in one country. It was a universal failing. The voters said
 that they wanted politicians who spoke plainly and stuck to their
 principles, but if such people actually stood for election, they were
 quickly rejected, as no principle is universally popular. Consequently
 the only successful politicians had no principles and never said what
 they meant.

>examine rest of exhibition


 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the rest of the
 exhibition.

>examine rest


 You can't make out much of the rest of the exhibition, but you already
 know that it continues in much the same vein as the nearest display,
 charting the failure and decline of pre-Administration government.

 You are a well-oiled and somewhat noisy maintenance robot. Your robot
 body has a humanoid configuration - two legs, two arms, and a head,
 but it could not possibly pass for a human anywhere, not even a sci-fi
 convention, because the design is so completely functional. There is
 no skin; tubes, solenoids and wires are exposed along with the metal
 skeleton. The machine was never designed to leave the bunker - its
 intended purpose is limited to replacing server parts and installing
 network gear. A black box is attached to you like a backpack.

 This is a cold and dirty room with concrete walls and an oily floor.
 There are no windows - the room is deep underground - and the only
 light comes from aged, flickering fluorescent tubes. There's another
 room to the south and a doorway to the west. Much of the eastern wall
 is taken up by a blast door (which is closed).

 Network Socket WS3 is on the south wall. The socket is not in use.

 Network Socket WS2 is on the north wall. The socket is not in use.

 There are two charging stations on the north side of the room, each
 large enough to accommodate your robotic body.

 You can also see a workbench here.

>go east


 The blast door is closed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Battery Room</span>
 This dingy concrete room is filled with racks of batteries, providing
 backup power for the facility. There are doorways to the north, east
 and west.

 Network Socket WS4 is on the south wall. The socket is not in use.

 You can see a single-length network cable here.

>get cable

>go west


 (letting go of the single-length network cable, as it is plugged into
 Socket WS4, and it's too short to stretch to another room)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Secure Room</span>
 This room was once an office. Some ancient desks and chairs are
 cluttered into a corner, and you can see a faded calendar on the wall
 beside a dusty portrait. There's a doorway to the east and a blast
 door to the south.

 You can see some old desks and chairs here.

>exits


 The only exit leads east to the Battery Room.

>desks


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine desks


 Old and poor quality. The chairs look uncomfortable and flimsy, while
 the desks are made of peeling chipboard. This could never have been a
 pleasant place to work. You see a network cable underneath one of the
 desks.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Data Centre</span>
 This large room is filled with racks of black boxes. It seems that
 many of the internal walls of the bunker were removed in order to make
 more space. There is just enough room to move between the racks, but
 not much more. You find doorways leading south, west and northwest.
 There is a door in the northeast corner.

>exits


 Exits lead:
  northeast to the Network Room.
  south to the Battery Room.
  west to the Passage.
  northwest to the Broadcasting Studio.

>examine racks


 The racks are used to support the black boxes, making them easily
 accessible for maintenance.

>examine boxes


 The physical minds of thousands of Administration staff. These boxes
 contain your colleagues and associates. Each box is firmly mounted in
 a metal rack, bears a five-digit number, and is the same shape as the
 one you carry.

>get boxes


 They're fixed in place. In any case, you cannot know whose mind is in
 each box.

>examine number


 The backpack is a large black box attached to the back of your robot
 body. It contains your physical mind, isolated from the network and
 power supply of the data centre. The number 28436 is printed on the
 box in a neat typeface. A second number has been crudely scratched on
 it: 644358724. The box has a network socket. The socket is not in use.

 The floor tile moves slightly when you stand on it.

>stand on tile


 That's not something you can stand on.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Broadcasting Studio</span>
 The mixing desk, soundproof walls and 'On Air' sign in this room tell
 you that it was originally intended to be used as a broadcasting
 studio. Now it is being used as a store room for computer parts, which
 have been stacked up against the walls.

 There is an instruction book on the mixing desk.

 You can also see a satellite uplink kit and a toolbag (which is
 closed) here.

>get all


 satellite uplink kit: Taken.
 instruction book: Taken.
 toolbag: Taken.
 mixing desk: That's hardly portable.
 'On Air' sign: That's hardly portable.
 computer parts: You find nothing that you need there.

>examine instruction book


 The book dates from the 1970s and contains many pages of typewritten
 instructions which explain how to use the primitive studio facilities.
 Reading the book makes it clear that this bunker was one of many
 intended to house 'key personnel' during wartime. It seems it was
 subsequently repurposed by the Central Administrator as his (physical)
 home.

>examine desk


 The studio equipment is vintage. Given the right buyer, this old
 analogue gear might be quite valuable. But it's no use to you.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a toolbag (which is closed)
   an instruction book
   a satellite uplink kit
   a single-length network cable
   a single-length network cable
   a screwdriver
   a black box

>mix phat beats


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>open toolbag


 You open the toolbag, revealing a cable joining tool and a
 single-length network cable.

>join cable with cable


 The cables are joined, creating two coiled lengths.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>join cable with cable


 You have no other cable end to join to the double-length network
 cable.

>examine kit


 The satellite uplink kit is housed in a heavy case (which is closed).
 It provides emergency network access via satellite, but can only be
 used in an area with a clear view of the sky.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a double-length network cable
   a toolbag (which is open)
     a cable joining tool
     a single-length network cable

   a screwdriver
   a black box

>take cable


 (the double-length network cable)
 You already have that.

>examine joining


 This tool allows you to JOIN two network cables, or CUT one cable into
 two sections.

>take single-lengyj cable


 Taken.

>join cable with cable


 Which do you mean, the single-length network cable or the
 double-length network cable?

>join cables


 single-length network cable: The cables are joined, creating three
 coiled lengths.
 triple-length network cable: You have no other cable end to join to
 the triple-length network cable.

>join single-length cable with double-length cable


 You can't see any such thing.

 There is a console in the centre of the room. There's a message on the
 console's display.

 A portal occupies most of the northeast wall.

 Candidate number 28199


 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom</span> (on the bed)
 You're in bed. The alarm didn't wake you. Something feels wrong. There
 is no light from the window, and your bedroom seems to be empty...

 [Enter HELP if you are unsure what to do now.]

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   an identity badge

>examine badge


 (first getting out of bed)
 A small plastic ID badge. The badge states: 'Candidate Number 28199'.

 Something is certainly wrong! Is this... part of the test? You never
 found out exactly what the final exam involved. Perhaps it is like
 this for every candidate.

>examine window


 Even at night, you'd expect to see something. The gardens of the
 Administration Centre, and beyond them, the amphitheatre, the hedge
 maze and ornamental lake, lit by street lights and moonlight. It never
 gets completely dark. But today, there's nothing at all. Just total
 blackness, as if there is a smooth black wall just beyond the window.

>examine bed


 Even the bed seems wrong. This isn't your duvet and these aren't your
 pillowcases.

 The only exit leads south to the Quadrangle.

>examine door


 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>go south


 You walk through a few deserted corridors. There is nobody here; the
 building is completely silent. You cross the Administration Centre's
 quadrangle, also deserted, and end up in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 This is the main entrance to the sprawling Administration Centre.
 Large doors to the south would lead to the driveway and surrounding
 parkland, but you cannot see anything through the windows in the south
 wall. A grand staircase leads upwards. Doors lead east and west to the
 wings of the main building, while a smaller exit leads north to the
 quadrangle. There is a green door in the northwest corner of the room.
 There's a mural on the western wall, and a portrait and a mirror on
 the eastern wall.

 On the reception desk is a fax machine.

>examine mirror


 Somehow, your reflection looks older than you remember. The exam
 stress must be causing some premature aging!

>examine portrait


 The painting hangs on the eastern wall. It is an enormous portrait of
 Edmund Burke, the 18th century writer and politician. The Central
 Administrator is said to be a fan.
 The fax machine bleeps.

>examine fax


 (the fax machine)
 It's on the reception desk, where it seems quite out of place next to
 the modern computer workstations. It's not a printer or a scanner:
 it's an old-fashioned fax machine that prints onto thin thermal paper.
 You notice some paper hanging out of the machine.

>read paper


 [In Final Exam, 'READ' is synonymous with 'EXAMINE'.]
 Poor-quality paper from a fax machine. It reads:

 'Dear candidate 28199, please go upstairs to the Observation Gallery
 where you will find further instructions.'

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine full


 You can't see any such thing.

>go up


 As you walk up the stairs, you recall the first time you were here. It
 was a school trip when you were very young: a day out at the
 Administration Centre! You remember the sense of excitement at being
 so close to the great and powerful.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mezzanine</span>
 The first floor landing forms a mezzanine here, overlooking the lobby
 below. It's a sort of waiting room, placed right outside the Central
 Administrator's office, which is through the double doors to the west.
 A corridor leads east, and a grand staircase leads down. Like the rest
 of the building, the mezzanine is deserted, but if anyone was waiting
 here, they would be able to sit on the sofa and read the papers on the
 coffee table. Or they might look at the rather Administratively-themed
 artwork on the walls.

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Stability' on the north wall.

 On the coffee table are a memo and a newspaper.

>examine memo


 It is an internal memo from one of the Administration departments:

 'Following the recent expansion of the Sellafield data and power
 facility, the Simulation Department is pleased to announce that there
 will be a 25% increase in simulator availability from next month. A
 third data centre has been built on the Sellafield site, where it will
 benefit from highly cost-effective electricity. The Administration
 will have priority access to 50% of its computing power, the remainder
 being sold privately to finance the reactor upgrade. The increase will
 enable more detailed policy evaluations to be carried out.'

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor turns a corner here, continuing to the north and west.
 The Security Administrator's office is through a door to the east, and

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Liberty' on the north wall.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Museum of Pre-Administration Government</span>
 This is the Administration Centre's museum. It's a vast hall,
 stretching far away to the north and east. It is currently closed and
 in darkness. A red rope blocks passage to the north and east. Light is
 coming from the corridor to the south and faintly from a blank video
 screen just beyond the rope. Exhibition displays fill the room, most
 too far away into the dark to be readable.

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Responsibility' on the west wall.

 You can see a glass case containing an access card.

 You remember your first visit to the Administration Centre. The tour
 spent hours in the museum. Most of your classmates took little
 interest in it and were quickly bored. But you found it fascinating.
 Here in the centre of it all, literally within the corridors of power!
 What excitement, what possibility!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Observation Gallery</span>
 You are in a cavernous room built on the same vast scale as a concert
 hall. It cannot possibly fit within the buildings of the
 Administration Centre - the normal rules of geometry have clearly been
 bent here. You are standing in an observation gallery far above the
 floor, which is filled with concentric circles of workstation desks.
 All face the centre of the room, where another circular desk is placed
 on a raised platform. Above all of this, a huge three-dimensional
 globe hangs in empty space. The dim lighting in the room comes mainly
 from the planet, which glows with an internal light. To the north,
 stairs lead up to the landing.

 A display monitor hangs above the gallery. There's a message on the
 monitor.

 You saw this room on your first visit to the Administration Centre,
 all those years ago. It was even more awe-inspiring then: the room
 seemed even more gigantic, and at that time, it was full of people,
 all busily at work on the floor below. It felt like standing at the
 centre of the world. You knew this was the place you wanted to be.

>examine monitor


 The display is an enormous high-resolution flat-screen monitor,
 suspended from the gallery ceiling. It shows a message: green text on
 black background.

 '<span class="floydstyle i">Dear candidate 28199,</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You must be wondering where everyone has gone. Let me explain.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A serious situation has developed, and I have been forced to take</span>

 It's a small green door in the northwest corner of the room, under the

>examine mural


 The mural shows the construction of a gigantic Gothic cathedral by
 medieval craftsmen. The cathedral, which is half finished, is covered
 in both primitive scaffolding and workmen, each of whom is busily
 engaged in creating some small part of the whole. It is already a
 thing of great beauty on both a micro and macro scale, though it may
 be a century before the work is done. A tiny caption reads 'The
 Rebuilding of Civilisation'.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quadrangle</span>
 The quadrangle is completely surrounded by Administration Centre
 buildings. It's a large, square outdoor space with well-tended lawns
 and flowerbeds and paths leading in all directions. The place is
 unnervingly quiet. Though the buildings, paths and gardens are
 well-lit, the sky is completely black.

 There is a sundial in the centre of the quadrangle.

 The first floor landing forms a mezzanine here, overlooking the lobby

 Administrator's office, which is through the double doors to the west.
 A corridor leads east, and a grand staircase leads down. Like the rest
 of the building, the mezzanine is deserted, but if anyone was waiting
 here, they would be able to sit on the sofa and read the papers on the
 coffee table. Or they might look at the rather Administratively-themed
 artwork on the walls.

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Stability' on the north wall.

 On the coffee table are a memo and a newspaper.

>examine newspaper


 It's one of the few newspapers that still has a printed edition,
 though for obvious reasons, this is an electronic copy. The front page
 story is all about an African dictator named Mugaffi. It is
 illustrated with pictures of children being treated for chemical burns
 outside a school. A few days ago, chemical weapons were used in the
 rebel city of Morgazi. 'Sources' blame Mugaffi's forces for the
 attack.

 According to the newspaper, this is the latest horrible incident of
 the full-blown civil war in Assadia. Though the protests against the
 corrupt Mugaffi regime began peacefully enough, the regime retaliated
 brutally - first with riot police, then with soldiers - and the
 situation rapidly escalated into war between rebels and regime forces.
 Last week, Mugaffi launched airstrikes against rebel-held cities. Now
 he uses chemical weapons against unarmed civilians, in contravention
 to all law, decency and sanity. But Mugaffi is afraid of the usual
 fate of deposed dictators, and he will do anything to cling to power.

 You recall that Assadia is an independent country outside of the
 Administration. As such, Mugaffi is free to do as he pleases, with no
 authority to restrain his gangster government. Strange, though, that
 the situation should have developed so quickly. You had thought that
 Mugaffi only won his presidency last year, as an anti-corruption
 candidate with much acclaim in the media, and was generally thought to
 be doing a good job in hard circumstances. But the newspaper reports
 imply that he's been in power for years.

>go west


 The doors are locked. In this building, office doors are usually keyed
 to the identity of the person who works there, so these doors will
 only open for the Central Administrator, unless he is already in the
 office. It seems that he is out.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor turns a corner here, continuing to the north and west.
 The Security Administrator's office is through a door to the east, and
 to the south, a short staircase leads downwards to a darkened room.

 There's a plaque bearing the word 'Liberty' on the north wall.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Observation Gallery</span>
 You are in a cavernous room built on the same vast scale as a concert
 hall. It cannot possibly fit within the buildings of the
 Administration Centre - the normal rules of geometry have clearly been
 bent here. You are standing in an observation gallery far above the
 floor, which is filled with concentric circles of workstation desks.
 All face the centre of the room, where another circular desk is placed
 on a raised platform. Above all of this, a huge three-dimensional
 globe hangs in empty space. The dim lighting in the room comes mainly
 from the planet, which glows with an internal light. To the north,
 stairs lead up to the landing.

 A display monitor hangs above the gallery.

>examine planet


 The 3D representation of Earth hangs in the centre of the room,
 suspended in empty space. It's a three-dimensional political map,
 highlighting countries and major cities, and it's tilted so that much
 of your view is filled with the European continent, where the
 countries of the First Settlement are shaded green. Across the
 Mediterranean Sea, much of Africa is shaded pink. The exception is the
 North African country of Assadia, which appears in yellow to indicate
 a major crisis.

>examine assadia


 Assadia is a North African country run by a vicious gangster named
 Mugaffi. The yellow colour indicates that a major crisis is happening
 there.

>examine desk


 Which do you mean, the rows of workstation desks or the raised central
 platform?

>central


 It's a large desk in the middle of the room, directly below the model
 of the Earth. At times of crisis, the Central Administrator and his
 assistants may direct operations from here.

>examine rows


 The Administrators do much of their work here. Each desk is assigned
 to some small region of the world, with physically adjacent regions
 occupying adjacent desks in this room. The workstations allow
 situations to be analysed, resources to be allocated, and
 Administration decisions to be sent to the outside world. The layout
 of the room makes it easy to coordinate with neighbours.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Security Administrator's Office</span>
 This is the office of the Security Administrator. There is no sign of
 the Administrator or any other staff. The door leads west to the
 corridor. The office is furnished by a desk, sofa, a bookshelf, and a
 mural on the northern wall.

>examine desk


 A very solid-looking wooden desk, bare and clean, as if it's just been
 delivered by an upmarket furniture shop. You feel like something is
 missing from the desk, but you can't remember what it is.

>examine sofa


 A large and comfortable leather sofa.

>examine bookshelf


 The bookshelves seem to have been emptied recently. Marks in the dust
 show where books have been removed. There is a book on the top shelf.

>examine book


 It's one of the well known Idiots' Guide series of computer books. It
 has a friendly yellow cover, on which a cartoon man offers to tell you
 how to 'Crack computers, flood networks and steal information'. The
 book contains several hundred pages of instructions for finding and
 exploiting security holes in computers. While this book may be filled
 with all sorts of interesting information, none of it's going to come
 up on your exam.

>take book


 Taken.

>examine mural


 The mural shows a dystopian cityscape of ugly skyscrapers and foul
 motorways. Miserable crowds mill around in the polluted, smoggy
 streets. The picture is intensely detailed, so you can even guess at
 what some of the people are doing, though none of them seem happy:
 miserable commuters, miserable criminals, miserable homeless people.
 Skyscrapers tower above them, adorned with the logos of credit cards
 and banks, and bearing the flags of failed governments. A tiny caption
 reads 'Where We Came From'.

 The video screen is showing a televised interview with the Central

 recording, his hair has already started to turn grey. The sound is
 faint, but you can make out some of the discussion if you listen
 carefully.

>listen


 (to the video screen)
 The Central Administrator is speaking:

 '<span class="floydstyle i">...having committed themselves to so-called science-based</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">policies, these being policies tested by computer simulation, the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">intellectual class could not raise an objection when the simulators</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">produced answers they had not expected.</span>'

>again


 (to the video screen)
 'Such as?' prompts the interviewer.

 '<span class="floydstyle i">I mean that the simulations favoured social policies that the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">intellectuals had regarded as conservative, old-fashioned and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">reactionary. The data clearly pointed at stability, liberty and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">personal responsibility as the key properties of a good society. The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">people had assumed that the machines would confirm their own beliefs</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">in globalism, socialism and so forth. They had never questioned those</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">beliefs, and indeed did not even think that their beliefs were</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">beliefs. The idea that the machine might come up with the 'wrong'</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">answer never occurred to them.</span>'

>listen


 (to the video screen)
 'This must have created some problems,' the interviewer remarks.

 '<span class="floydstyle i">Oh, well, some. But nothing greatly significant. The simulations</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">were quite repeatable. There were a few cases where independent</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">research got different answers, but these were discredited. I audited</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">their software and traced the differences to software bugs. Coding</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">errors. It turns out that humans are almost as bad at writing software</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">as they are at running a government!</span>'

 The interviewer laughs. 'Is there any link between the two?'

 '<span class="floydstyle i">I think so. Humans... well, all of us... struggle to deal with</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">complexity. When dealing with a complex system, like a country, or a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">large software program, the temptation is always to assume that you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">know enough to make an informed guess about what should be done. It is</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">a temptation that must be resisted. Everything must be thoroughly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">tested before it is allowed to 'go live'. You must do everything you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">can to avoid destabilising something that used to work.</span>'

>again


 (to the video screen)
 'But were there protests?' presses the interviewer.

 '<span class="floydstyle i">Some people will disagree with government no matter what it does.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">That is fine. They may choose to complain, and we may choose to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">listen. I think, though, that one reason the intellectuals eventually</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">accepted the new system is that they found themselves in bad company.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">They now stood alongside deniers and conspiracy theorists, the same</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">people they had once mocked as 'wingnuts' and lunatics for denying the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">validity of simulation results. Ultimately, they came over to our side</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">out of embarrassment as much as anything. Pretended they had agreed</span>

 It's one of three such plaques: the others are placed along the

 of the Administration: Stability, Liberty, and Responsibility. Exams
 are highly likely to involve essays on interactions between the three,
 but it never hurts to revise a little more, so you read the
 description below the word:

 'Administrators have a duty to ensure that their government is stable,
 reliable and predictable, so that the freedoms and benefits enjoyed by
 subjects are unchanged from day to day, untouched by the chaos of
 civil disorder and economic turmoil. Policies with the potential to
 cause unrest, upheaval and conflict are considered dangerous, and
 Administrators are required to test all policies rigorously in
 simulation before deployment. As Pratchett wrote,

 'People believe they want justice and wise government but, in fact,
 what they really want is an assurance that tomorrow will be very much
 like today.'

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Maintenance Room</span>
 This is a cold and dirty room with concrete walls and an oily floor.
 There are no windows - the room is deep underground - and the only
 light comes from aged, flickering fluorescent tubes. There's another
 room to the south and a doorway to the west. Much of the eastern wall
 is taken up by a blast door (which is closed).

 Network Socket WS3 is on the south wall. The socket is not in use.

 Network Socket WS2 is on the north wall. The socket is not in use.

 There are two charging stations on the north side of the room, each
 large enough to accommodate your robotic body.

 You can also see a workbench (on which is a screwdriver) here.

>examine robot


 You are a well-oiled and somewhat noisy maintenance robot. Your robot
 body has a humanoid configuration - two legs, two arms, and a head,
 but it could not possibly pass for a human anywhere, not even a sci-fi
 convention, because the design is so completely functional. There is
 no skin; tubes, solenoids and wires are exposed along with the metal
 skeleton. The machine was never designed to leave the bunker - its
 intended purpose is limited to replacing server parts and installing
 network gear. A black box is attached to you like a backpack.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a black box

>examine box


 The backpack is a large black box attached to the back of your robot
 body. It contains your physical mind, isolated from the network and
 power supply of the data centre. The number 28199 is printed on the
 box in a neat typeface. A second number has been crudely scratched on
 it: 856414854. The box has a network socket. The socket is not in use.

 The robot body may stand inside one of these in order to recharge its
 battery. While the robot body is recharging, your mind returns to the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Overlook</span>
 You're standing on a path on the north side of an underground river
 which flows through the cave here. The river level is too high to
 allow passage in any direction except through a narrow passage to the

 northwest.

 There is a cabinet here. A narrow conduit runs from the cabinet to the
 bunker on the other side of the chasm.

>examine cabinet


 A rusty metal box which has probably been here since the bunker was
 built. It's about the size and shape of a gym locker. A sign on the
 door reads 'GPO Telephones'.

>open cabinet


 Opening the cabinet reveals some modern networking gear, and Network
 Socket Z5. You see a network cable inside the cabinet.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of the Chasm</span>
 You're in the middle of a large cave which runs northeast and south,
 standing near the corner of the concrete wall of the bunker, which is
 to the southwest. A wide chasm spans the cave here, preventing passage
 to the north. The chasm was once spanned by a footbridge, but it
 collapsed years ago, and only a few rusted girders remain. A narrow
 conduit, bolted to the western cave wall, runs from the bunker to a
 cabinet on the other side of the chasm.

>examine conduit


 The conduit is a rectangular plastic pipe, a few inches in diameter,
 and it's bolted to the western cave wall. It seems to be filled with
 wires which run from the bunker wall to the cabinet.

>examine wires


 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine bunker wall


 It is the outer wall of the bunker. It is as tall as the cave and made
 entirely of reinforced concrete, stained a slimy green colour by
 decades of damp and algae growth.

>examine bridge


 All that remains of the footbridge are a few rusted girders on each
 side of the chasm. Over decades, the moisture in these caverns must
 have eroded the bridge, until it broke under its own weight and
 disappeared into the darkness.

 water to a small muddy beach on the far side. You hear a waterfall to
 the west. A passage leads northwest.

>examine pipe


 The pipe is made from rusty iron, and is around eight inches in
 diameter. It looks like a waste pipe. It spans the lake, and seems to
 be strong enough to use as a bridge.

>go west


 The robot body cannot swim.

>wear float


 You do not need to do that.

>go south


 You start to cross the lake by walking along the pipe, but you
 struggle to balance because of the weight and bulk of the satellite
 uplink kit. If you want to cross, you'll either have to drop that, or
 drop almost everything else.

>drop kit


 Dropped.

>go south


 You cautiously cross the lake by walking along the pipe...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lake Beach</span>
 You stand on a muddy beach on the south side of an underground lake.
 The lake occupies almost all of the cave, leaving only this beach and
 a path to the west. The lake is bridged by a pipe here - it comes from
 a passage to the east, and then runs across the lake to the north. The
 cave is filled with the sound of a waterfall.

 As you step into the portal, you take on physical form. You now find
 yourself standing in the outside world, in the metallic form of a
 maintenance robot...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Maintenance Room</span>
 This is a cold and dirty room with concrete walls and an oily floor.
 There are no windows - the room is deep underground - and the only
 light comes from aged, flickering fluorescent tubes. There's another
 room to the south and a doorway to the west. Much of the eastern wall
 is taken up by a blast door (which is open).

 Network Socket WS3 is on the south wall. A cable is plugged into
 Socket WS3. The rest of the cable is in your hand.

 Network Socket WS2 is on the north wall. The socket is not in use.

 There are two charging stations on the north side of the room, each
 large enough to accommodate your robotic body.

 You can also see a workbench here.

>go east


 (laying the trailing network cable as you go)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Entrance</span>
 You're in the southwest corner of a large cave. The walls of this cave
 are part natural limestone, and part slimy concrete, covered in
 decades of algae growth. To the west, you see the back entrance of the
 bunker, which is a wide door set into a concrete wall. The wall
 stretches north; the cave expands to the north and east.

 You are holding a trailing network cable. The cable runs west from
 here.

>go north


 (laying the trailing network cable as you go)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of the Chasm</span>
 You're in the middle of a large cave which runs northeast and south,
 standing near the corner of the concrete wall of the bunker, which is
 to the southwest. A wide chasm spans the cave here, preventing passage
 to the north. The chasm was once spanned by a footbridge, but it
 collapsed years ago, and only a few rusted girders remain. A narrow
 conduit, bolted to the western cave wall, runs from the bunker to a
 cabinet on the other side of the chasm.

 You are holding a trailing network cable. The cable runs south from
 here.

 here, and underneath its lowest point, a crawl tunnel leads northeast.
 A narrow passage leads southeast and the cave widens to the west.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crawl Tunnel</span>
 You are crawling through a very low, uneven passage that runs from
 southwest to east. It is fortunate that you do not need to breathe,
 because there is no space for breathing here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of the Chasm</span>
 You're in the north end of a large cave, standing beside a chasm which
 blocks passage to the south. The chasm was once spanned by a
 footbridge, but it collapsed years ago. On the other side of the
 chasm, you see the wall of the bunker. Passages lead east and
 northwest.

 There is a cabinet here. A narrow conduit runs from the cabinet to the
 bunker on the other side of the chasm.

 Network Socket Z5 is inside the cabinet. The socket is not in use.

 A network cable crosses the chasm: it runs south from here.

 is taken up by a blast door (which is open).

 Network Socket WS3 is on the south wall. A cable is plugged into
 Socket WS3. The cable runs east.

 Network Socket WS2 is on the north wall. The socket is not in use.

 There are two charging stations on the north side of the room, each
 large enough to accommodate your robotic body.

 You can also see a satellite uplink kit and a workbench here.

>go north


 As you step into the charging station, your robotic form shuts down...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Maintenance Room</span>
 The maintenance room is a round room with a low ceiling. The walls are
 made of shiny brushed metal, giving an impression of 1970s science
 fiction. Doors lead west and southeast. You see a warning sign on the
 western door.

 There is a console in the centre of the room. The console's display is
 filled with line noise, and a red light is flashing.

 A portal occupies most of the northeast wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">It's worse than I thought. We have no external communications at</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Our enemy has discovered the location of our data centre, and will</span>
 soon attempt to break in. We must act quickly. You will need to run a
 cable from socket WS3 to some place where the sky is visible. Set up a

 distance, you will need to join more network cables - probably as many
 as you can find. Look in the Network Room first. There will be more in
 other places.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You will have to explore the caves.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">One more thing. Be careful with the other network sockets. Some of</span>

 water to a small muddy beach on the far side. You hear a waterfall to
 the west. A passage leads northwest.

>go south


 You cautiously cross the lake by walking along the pipe...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lake Beach</span>
 You stand on a muddy beach on the south side of an underground lake.
 The lake occupies almost all of the cave, leaving only this beach and
 a path to the west. The lake is bridged by a pipe here - it comes from
 a passage to the east, and then runs across the lake to the north. The
 cave is filled with the sound of a waterfall.

 into the black box attached to the maintenance robot. The cable is
 also attached to Socket WS1.

 Network Socket WS1 is on the east wall.

 You can see a single-length network cable here.

 You can also see some glass cabinets here.

>examine robot


 (the broken maintenance robot)
 The robot is obviously malfunctioning. It lies on the floor, twitching
 violently as if having a fit. In other respects, the robot looks just
 like 'you': it has a humanoid body just like your own, and is plainly
 intended to maintain the systems in the bunker. There's a black box
 attached to the robot like a backpack.

>unplug broken robot


 The broken robot stops twitching.

 The single-length network cable is now unplugged from the black box
 attached to the maintenance robot.

>examine box


 (the black box attached to the maintenance robot)
 The backpack is a large black box attached to the back of the broken
 robot, containing his physical mind. There's a number printed on the
 box, 40189, and a name: 'Maurice'.

>ask maurice about maurice


 There is no reply.

>take box


 (the black box attached to the maintenance robot)
 The poor robot has suffered enough!

>examine ws1


 The label reads 'Socket WS1 - Unfiltered'. A cable is plugged into
 Socket WS1. The rest of the cable is in your hand.

>unplug ws1


 The single-length network cable is now unplugged from Socket WS1.

>examine cabinets


 Dozens of glass-fronted cabinets filled with modern networking gear.
 You can see many network cables in the cabinets, but they're mostly
 very short, just long enough to connect one router to another.
 However, you notice one cable at the bottom of one cabinet, apparently
 unconnected, and just within reach.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]
