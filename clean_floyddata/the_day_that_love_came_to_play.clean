 You are in a prison that has 32767 cells. The Guv' has said that a new
 policy has been brought in by the Gov'. Due to prison crowding they're
 offering every prisoner the chance to be freed.

 In order to decide who gets set free, The Guv' will ask each prisoner
 which cell they choose. The prisoner will then be escorted to that
 cell where they will spend the night.

 During the night, a piece of card will be attached to each cell door
 on which will be written the word "keep" on one side and the word
 "release" on the other. The piece of card will start off with the word
 "keep" visible.

 The Guv' will turn around every piece of card so that the word
 "release" is now visible. Afterwards every second piece of card will
 be turned then every third and so on until the last card has been
 turned.

 "I don't make the rules," he says, "I only go to ridiculous lengths to
 enforce them."

 If at dawn when all the cards have been turned, the word "keep" is
 visible on a cell door, its prisoner will be forced to live out the
 rest of their sentence, but if the word "release" is visible on a cell
 door, its prisoner will be released.

 "Alright, you little oik," says The Guv',"which cell is it going to
 be?"

>1


 Picking a number at random, you tell The Guv' that you choose cell
 number "one" to spend the night in.

 You are then escorted to that cell where spend a restless night,
 worrying over whether your maths was right. Early next morning, The
 Guv' comes in and takes ahold of your hand. You get an eerie sensation
 that all your troubles are just beginning. You are then blindfolded
 and led away from the cell.

 When the blindfold is removed, you blink as you see the light of day.
 No sooner do you see the light, than a fiddle is thrust into your
 grubby fingertips.

 "Alright," says The Guv', "what we didn't tell you is that you'll have
 to spend out the rest of your sentence as an unattributed spare band
 member for <span class="floydstyle i">They Might Be Giants</span>.

 "Fingertips: I don't understand you" was written by Matt Weiner for
 the Apollo 18 tribute IF compilation, organized by Kevin Jackson-Mead.
 Thanks to Andrew Schultz, Ruth Alfasso, and Dan for beta-testing,
 Victor Gijsbers for the original code for handling blank commands, and
 Melvin Rangasamy for the code for handling UNDO and OOPS as well.

 In the spirit of the song from which the game takes its title, none of
 your commands are understood. Anything you type should yield the same
 response.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Onstage at the Cherrywood Lounge</span>
 The crowd looked dead before you came on. Now they're lively, as the
 music begins. You catch a glimpse of Gladys; she gives you a wink.



 She had her lips done recently; they're gleaming in the music. Her
 eyes are aglow, and she's breathing deep, showing off a little
 cleavage before the universe dies.



                             -=-=-=-=-=-

>wink


 You return Gladys' wink with a merry wave, and add a little dance
 move, and she beams at you and dances back. The destruction of all
 life is so much sweeter with an unholy consort.

 Ah, one of the first spells you learned in the service of the

 You abandon the stage for a moment, ducking back into the wings from

 It's fitting, of course, that the world ends here, at Cherrywood, in a
 storm of orgone, music, and love.

 They laughed at you at the Diamond Room. They boo'ed you offstage at
 Manny's Temporary Jazz Establishment. They wouldn't even let you in
 the door at the Desert Springs Resort offices, and you had a
 <span class="floydstyle em">manager,</span> then.

 But beyond the stars, and deep within the earth, dwelled Sazark, and
 the minions of Sazark, and they felt in you the kinship of true lounge
 art. They sent you Gladys, and your song ... your theme song ... came
 true. Love came to play, and not just <span class="floydstyle em">play:</span> it came to kill
 everyone.

 With the music as the engine, with the souls as fuel, with your hand
 and voice as instrument, you summon Sazark the Destroyer, and you do
 it with a little hip-wiggle that makes Gladys almost blush.

 Cue pyrotechnics.

 As the Destroyer walks the earth, and as the earth dies, you reflect
 on your crimes, your sins, your delights, your pair of
 modestly-successful LPs.

 It's been a good gig. Goodbye, cruel world.



                             -=-=-=-=-=-

            The moment is done. The world is done with it.

>about


 This is a <span class="floydstyle em">single-moment</span> text-adventure by S. John Ross, a
 freebie fun-time toy from Cumberland Games & Diversions. You can enjoy
 this game on its own, but it's also one "fingertip track" on <span class="floydstyle i">Apollo</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">18+20: The IF Tribute Album,</span> a collection of themed games by many
 authors, honoring They Might Be Giants. There are full-sized games
 (based on the full-sized album tracks) and several single-moment
 fingertip games as well (the fingertips were little fragmentary
 tracks, often just a few seconds long).

 If you're looking for hints ... well, there's no way to win or lose,
 really. Make a single move (VERB THE NOUN) and the game is over (only
 it's not <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> over, since you can explore that same moment
 again and again). There <span class="floydstyle em">is</span> a command that ends the game
 utterly, so you can look for that if you want to. I would. But I'm
 biased.

 As per usual, everything would be worthless crapola without the
 testers (Gwyn Adams, Ruth Alfasso, Chris Creel, Dan Efran, Dave
 LeCompte, Zed Lopez, Eric Nail, Melvin Rangasamy and Daniel Suptic).
 Thanks also to Kevin Jackson-Mead for organizing the tribute, to Zarf
 for suggesting the fingertips be single-move games, and to Sam Barlow
 for <span class="floydstyle em">Aisle.</span>

 Flush with the warm magnificence of the orgone energy projected from
 the heart of the demon, you let your hips express the cosmic disdain.
 Brushing the lapels of your red-velvet suit and flashing your pearly

 You get closer to the mic, considering, maybe, a few parting words ...
 a little speech about how glad you are that everyone's here, and how
 gladder you are that, in a few minutes, they'll all be gone. A few
 words for Gladys, a few words for the lounge. A joke, some questions
 ... a crocodile tear, perhaps, for character? But the moment passes.
 You've never been a great talker, only a great singer. And why talk to
 the dead?

 You, or someone you're supposed to be, will be spending his last few

 Your kid's backpack is here for the snooping.

 An ashtray here holds a cigarette that ain't getting finished.

 A refrigerator is here. Well, actually, it's visible off to the side
 in what could pass for a kitchen. There's a refrigerator magnet on it.

 There's a wall cell phone here--you know, the sort that still needs to

 You can also see a can of beer, an apple, a glossy magazine, a box of
 nicotine gum, a paper note and a chocolate bar here.

>examine magnet


 You feel uneasy, as if there is a camera zooming on you. Probably
 because you can see its reflection in the refrigerator. But actually,
 it is focusing on the QUITLINE number on the magnet.

 The director walks over from behind the cameras pats you on the back
 with his notepad. "Okay, okay, don't get too high or low. It's a
 start. Don't be afraid to mess up. In fact, the basic ways to mess up
 might help move things along. We just need ideas now. Like, just do
 what comes naturally before you die.

 "Once we got enough, we can put the clips through focus and approval
 groups and then we can decide which ones are best. Reformulate your
 ideas for more appropriate characters. Cause, y'know, I'm pretty sure
 it's the tobacco companies who stole the last pages of the script, and
 us doin' lots of neat new stuff would SHOW em.

 "Now, uh, you're not legally obligated to stay. You can take this
 paycheck and leave if you want. Contract ending today and all.
 But...have another go? Or ten? Or twenty?"

 Before you can pick up the cigarette, a security guard runs over and
 tackles you to the ground.

 "Hey! Whoah! Easy, fella. That's not a real cigarette." The director
 turns his ire from the security guard to you. "And YOU! We did you a
 big favor by not even forcing you to SEEM to smoke. That's just water
 vapor. We'd have all kinds of ethical troubles if that was a REAL
 smoke. State Assembly bums dragging their feet on common-sense
 exceptions cuz the smoking ban zapped EXPERIMENTS to show indoor
 smoking's even worse than we thought." But he waves you off when you
 try to apologize.

 "Good thought, but you didn't stumble enough getting to the window.
 Also, yeah, more gasping noises." You practice it a few more times

 It's on the film! That's gonna be some CGI time to fix it. Geesh! The

 for a camera to feature the name of the manufacturer of said gum and
 also the different flavors it comes in. Hey, they're paying your
 salary, partially. It's the least you can do.

 smoking with the gum and leaves you in the dust! We'll add that in
 later. You'll get overtime."

 You, or someone you're supposed to be, will be spending his last few

 Your kid's backpack is here for the snooping.

 An ashtray here holds a cigarette that ain't getting finished.

 There's a wall cell phone here--you know, the sort that still needs to
 be recharged--with a list of emergency numbers.

 You can also see a can of beer, an apple, a glossy magazine, a box of
 nicotine gum and a chocolate bar here.

 "You goddamn numbskull!" shouts the director from the fourth wall.
 "That's an idea I had for the I QUIT SMOKING film. The one they
 rejected. Too much choreography, they said. Thanks for the reminder!"
 The director hyperventilates for a bit before calming down.

 "Keep at it. Keep at it. New ideas probably getting tougher now. Don't
 worry if I yell at you for dumb new ones."

 Congratulations! You found a new way to die, or mess up, or mess up

 "But it's serious business now. In this interconnected world, people

 You go to take the paycheck. It's just lying out there. Since the
 script writers didn't fulfill their contract, legally...

 As you take your paycheck, the director takes you aside.

>about


 This game was written for the intfiction.org They Might Be Giants
 tribute. It follows the Fingertips mini-song "I'm Having a Heart
 Attack" and, like the other Fingertips games, consists of only one
 (meaningful) move. In this case, looking and examining and other
 non-time-consuming actions (like this) don't (always) count.

 This game was designed in the mold of the AISLE or Pick up the Phone
 Booth and Die joke games the Interactive Fiction community knows so
 well. I immediately thought "Hey, I could write a game called Pick Up
 the Lit Cigarette and Die," but I realized it'd be trolling to release
 in a totally serious venue.

 I don't think I'm trying to make any big social point with this,
 except I remember doodling about making my own text adventure games in
 health class well before Inform 7 existed. Especially during the
 wretchedly overdone movies.

 That said, Aisle by Sam Barlow is well done and has a deeper story
 than this. Check it out, if you haven't.

 Release 1 was 3/26/2012 for the tribute album.
 Release 2 was 4/15/2012. It added a point and tightened up writing and
 made more variable responses.

 See CREDITS for a list of people who helped, directly and indirectly,
 with this game.

>examine notepad


 You peek over at the director's notepad. He has some notes scrawled on
 it. Get a closer look?
>yes


 Under the maze he's drawn with just one straight line you notice the
 text "nonsense."


 The director makes a noncommital hmph. He already thought of that, but
 then again, you knew that, because you peeked at his notepad. Still,
 yay for scoring an extra point with me.

 Congratulations! You found a new way to die, or mess up, or mess up
 dying, and it involved guessing a verb!
 You feel like you've really earned that paycheck, man. There's not
 much else to do. You just know it!

>take paycheck


 You go to take the paycheck. It's just lying out there. Since the
 script writers didn't fulfill their contract, legally...

 As you take your paycheck, the director takes you aside.

 "Good work today. You'll get a raise for this. And you'll deserve it.
 Truth be told, I saw MANAGEMENT MATERIAL out there. I mean, there're
 actors for acting's sake and all that rubbish, but you're clearly so
 much MORE than that."

 Congratulations on winning my little game here, such as it can be won!
 I actually intended it to be a sort of meta-exercise for the reader to
 get points for trying standard Interactive Fiction verbs. Or, if not
 points, funny reactions.

 In addition, I also created a crude coding engine so I could easily
 add verbs, add a second response (when I couldn't decide my favorite,)
 and even add cheating directions for if you read the director's
 notepad, which you did, though I hope there wasn't too much
 verb-guessing. I also plan to send out the source code, not as a
 shining example, but because I'm pleased with the flexibility I had.

 Please press SPACE to continue.
 That was too stuffy and straight-laced, wasn't it?


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 Well, actually, it was originally more that I wanted my own private
 revenge on cheesy health films. Plus I saw a bunch of opportunities
 for really sophomoric jokes that wouldn't have fit anywhere else. Like
 the LifeCall one. (And if you're not in/from the US, hey, I apologize
 for that one. But look it, and the Empire jingle, up on YouTube.)

 Now go enjoy the other games in this collection. There're some good
 ones!

 How many fingers am I holding up?

>4


 You cautiously enter "four" into the keyboard.

 After a few moments the screen fades out and a disembodied voice
 whispers, "Fingertips" over and over. Then the walls, floor and
 ceiling slide into the ground. You find yourself in a void. You start
 to wonder where you may be but as soon enough you black out.


 Press ANY KEY to continue.
 You awake in a cold sweat, safe but unsettled, a strange tingle in
 your fingertips.
