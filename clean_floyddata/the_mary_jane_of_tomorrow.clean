 Jenny tilts her head and squints at the Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow.
 It's dressed in pink and its chassis is chrome-embellished. You even
 gave it your own hairstyle.

 "Do you like her?" you ask.

 "Mary Jane, I-" Jenny gives you a sideways look. Things have been
 weird since you both almost died. You've been trying to listen better.
 "I wasn't expecting a present like this."


 1) "You said you hate being cooped up in the store alone! So now
 you can have a replica me. For company!"
 2) "I had to recycle a lot of the supplies so my father wouldn't
 know what I was working on, but she's got all the same hardware as the
 Wife of Tomorrow."
     3) "Happy Birthday!"

>3

 "Happy Birthday!" you say. You even throw in a cheerleading jump. That
 always makes her smile.

 "This is amazing! And so impressive. You could have your own
 engineering company if you wanted." But. You can tell there's a but.
 "I just... couldn't you have made one of me? To run the shop? And then
 I wouldn't need robot company because I could spend the afternoon with
 actual you."


     1) "I couldn't copy you, silly!"
 2) "But... it would've been weird to give you a birthday present
 that was another you."

>1

 "I couldn't copy you, silly!" Just the idea of a Jenny of Tomorrow
 makes you feel strange. You'd be telling her what to do and how to be,
 a little like your father does with you, and...

 "Could you try?" Jenny asks. "It doesn't have to be an exact replica.
 Just as long as it can ring up purchases and answer some basic plant
 care questions, it ought to be fine... And maybe you want to make sure
 it can bake, just in case."


     1) "I really like Jenny of Today."
     2) "Well, I might need some more training resources..."
     3) "Anything you want!"

>look

 While you're conversing, you can only pick conversation options.

     1) "I really like Jenny of Today."
     2) "Well, I might need some more training resources..."
     3) "Anything you want!"

>2

 "I'd need some more training resources," you say. "I don't know all
 the things you know."

 "If you really get stuck, call me," Jenny says. "But I bet you've got
 more around here than you realize... oh! I'd better get going.
 Speaking of the shop."

 She gets up and gives you half an apologetic smile. You try to think
 of what to say. While you're thinking, Jenny kisses your cheek and
 goes out.

 "Should I follow her?" The Pine Nut Queen turns hopefully to you.


     1) "Not this time, kid."
     2) "We've got some more training to do."

>2

 "We've got some more training to do."

 "I'd love to!" The Pine Nut Queen takes a seat on the sofa.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Home-like Showroom</span>
 There are plenty of actual laboratories at MinSystems Labs. This isn't
 one of those: you train your robots in an ordinary household setting.

 Off to the east is the kitchen area, panelled in faux walnut, and
 there's a bathroom, south, just for the sake of verisimilitude. The
 robots do not need to use it.

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow is sitting properly on the sofa and
 wearing a sash. The sash was a good touch, but it's not very Jenny.
 Arranged on the coffee table in front of her (to make the room look
 more realistic) are a poem book and <span class="floydstyle em">Le Dernier Regret de</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Thérèse</span>.

>examine me

 You, Mary Jane Minsky, were the Pine Nut Queen of Canyonville, and
 before that, Pine Nut Princess. You ride in parades. You taste pies.
 You have an exquisitely efficient metabolism. You are beloved by the
 entire citizenry. And that was even before you helped Bonstance
 Noodleman save the town from the massive brain-suckage induced by
 incoming yellow-slimed monsters. That's all in the past now. They're
 probably not coming back.

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow looks at you. And blinks. Twice.

>sing

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a pink purse (being worn and closed and locked)

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow watches you go through your
 possessions. "I did not take any of your things, if that is what you
 are worried about."

 Okay, hang on, let's focus.

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow is still able to process new training
 documents: books, manuals, pamphlets, any kind of written document.
 You just need to give her something to work with.

>open purse

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow changed the combination last week
 during training, and you never got around to writing down the new
 combo.

 If anything goes too wrong with the training program, you can always
 reset the Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow back to hardware level with her
 reset button.

>give poem boom to pine nut queen

 You can only do that to something animate.

>pine nut, read poem book

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow has better things to do.

>train pine nut

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>give poem book to pine nut

 (first taking the poem book)
 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow watches you pick up the poem book. "Is
 that for me?" she asks. "I've got lots of spare storage space still!"

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow scrutinizes the poem book, committing
 all of its details to memory. "Poetry: Learned! Ennui: Memorized!
 Would you refrain from boring me with your purposeless tasks?"

>ask pine nut about pine nut

 Here we TALK TO people. I'll assume that's what you meant.

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow begins to speak: "Hello there. I am the
 Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow."

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."
     2) "Your new name is Jenny Yoshida of Tomorrow."
     3) "Could you hand me your sash?"
     4) "Can you give me some tips about plant care?"
     5) "Could I have the contents of your chassis?"
     6) "How do you feel about parades?"
     7) "Can you write me a poem?"
     8) "Do you remember how to unlock my purse?"
 9) "Is it true you fought off the Brain Guzzlers almost
 singlehanded?"
     10) "I'm done talking now."

>2

 "Your new name is Jenny Yoshida of Tomorrow."

 The Pine Nut Queen of Tomorrow shrugs. "Understood. I'm now Jenny of
 Tomorrow."

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."
     2) "Could you hand me your sash?"
     3) "Can you give me some tips about plant care?"
     4) "Could I have the contents of your chassis?"
     5) "How do you feel about parades?"
     6) "Can you write me a poem?"
     7) "Do you remember how to unlock my purse?"
 8) "Is it true you fought off the Brain Guzzlers almost
 singlehanded?"
     9) "I'm done talking now."

>7

 "Do you remember how to unlock my purse?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow says, "Sorry, I don't recall. I need security
 training."

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."
     2) "Could you hand me your sash?"
     3) "Can you give me some tips about plant care?"
     4) "Could I have the contents of your chassis?"
     5) "How do you feel about parades?"

     7) "Do you remember how to unlock my purse?"
 8) "Is it true you fought off the Brain Guzzlers almost
 singlehanded?"
     9) "I'm done talking now."

>1

 "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 The Jenny of Tomorrow puts her hands on her hips in a mock
 cheerleading stance. "Known skills: pine-nuts; cheerleading; poetry;
 ennui; ...and that's it."

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."
     2) "Could you hand me your sash?"
     3) "Can you give me some tips about plant care?"
     4) "Could I have the contents of your chassis?"
     5) "How do you feel about parades?"
     6) "Can you write me a poem?"
     7) "Do you remember how to unlock my purse?"
 8) "Is it true you fought off the Brain Guzzlers almost
 singlehanded?"
     9) "I'm done talking now."

>9

 "Goodbye, friend!"

>give le dernier regret to pine nut

 (first taking <span class="floydstyle em">Le Dernier Regret de Thérèse</span>)
 The Jenny of Tomorrow watches you pick up <span class="floydstyle em">Le Dernier Regret de</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Thérèse</span>. "Another book. I'm surprised we're not training in the
 Canyonville Central Library."

 The Jenny of Tomorrow flips through <span class="floydstyle em">Le Dernier Regret de</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Thérèse</span>, but says, "Sorry, I need better French before I can
 understand such a text."

>reset pine nut

 The button depresses. The Jenny of Tomorrow's head emits a metallic
 PING!! noise and her eyes flash twice. She is now back on line.

>talk to jenny

 The Jenny of Tomorrow begins to speak: "Hi! I am the Jenny of
 Tomorrow." She looks nothing like actual Jenny, which is
 disconcerting.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tosses her hair.

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."
     2) "Could you hand me your sash?"
     3) "Can you give me some tips about plant care?"
     4) "Could I have the contents of your chassis?"
     5) "How do you feel about parades?"
     6) "Can you write me a poem?"
     7) "Do you remember how to unlock my purse?"
 8) "Is it true you fought off the Brain Guzzlers almost
 singlehanded?"
     9) "I'm done talking now."

>1

 "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 The Jenny of Tomorrow plays a mood-enhancing chime. "Known skills:
 None. At all. I am skill-less. You'd better do something quickly."

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 You can also see a coffee table here.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow crosses her metal legs, the opposite way from
 before.

>go east

 "Say hi to Jenny if you call her," says the Jenny of Tomorrow, as you
 head for the kitchen. Apparently you haven't completely got rid of the
 training you did last week, imprinting her robot brain with a liking
 for Jenny. Some things are hard to get rid of even with a reset.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ordinary Kitchen</span>
 Nothing has ever been prepared in the Ordinary Kitchen, so it is
 extremely clean and a little short on food and utensils. Still, there
 are the cabinets (faux walnut) and the sink (functional) to help teach
 your robot how to interact with a real kitchen. And there's a stove,
 though to the best of your knowledge the oven has never actually been
 used.

 The telephone hangs on the wall, if you need to call Jenny.

>open cabinet

 You open the kitchen cabinet, revealing <span class="floydstyle em">The Polite and Cheerful</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Girl's Guide To Elegant Dining</span>.

 Guide To Elegant Dining. "Etiquette: Learned! That's cooler than a
 dead man's nose."

 The Jenny of Tomorrow begins to speak: "Hello there! I'm the Jenny of

 "Could you hand me your sash?" you ask. She looks down at it
 thoughtfully.

 "I really like parades! And sashes! So... I'd rather not."

 Admittedly, it's what you'd say in the same situation. You did a great
 job of training her.

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 "Can you write me a poem?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow sighs faintly. "Sure." She clears her throat.

 "The apocalypse horse grumbles in the basement! Rot! Skeleton dressed
 in Salmon! Gray suits!"

     1) "Bravo! Well done!"
     2) "I'm really coming to respect you as an artist."
     3) "That was terrible."
     4) "Ooh, do me another one!"

 "Ooh, do me another one!"

 "Blue rivers! Green valleys! Body of our Mother Earth! Blue Gum tree!
 The sky is ivory with mushrooms! War! Genocide!"

 Jenny answers the phone on the first ring. "Yoshida Floral," she says.
 "What can I do for you?"

 "Jenny, it's me," you say.

 "Hey," she says. It's only when she's talking to you that her voice
 settles down to what you think of as its normal sound. Around other
 people, it's higher and faster.

     1) "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"
     2) "Could you give me your recipe for Snickerdoodles?"
     3) "Could I borrow your diary to train her with?"
     4) "Okay, thanks! I'll call you back when she's ready."

>1

 "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"

 "Well... she'll need to know plant types, so she can answer questions
 in the shop. She should have enough finance skill to handle the
 register. And if she can bake, that would help with the illusion.
 Otherwise... you know what I'm like!"

     1) "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"
     2) "Could you give me your recipe for Snickerdoodles?"
     3) "Could I borrow your diary to train her with?"
     4) "Okay, thanks! I'll call you back when she's ready."

>2

 "Could you give me your recipe for Snickerdoodles? Not so I can make
 it, I wouldn't be good at it, but I need to train the Jenny of
 Tomorrow."

 "It's not written down," Jenny says. "I'd have to work out the
 quantities... Oh wait! We did write it down and donate the recipe to
 the Canyonville High Fundraiser Cookbook. I could send it to you by
 telepod, if you want."

 You gave Jenny a telepad. It comes in handy when she wants to send you
 pies while you're working. You've always been generous like that.

 A moment later, you hear the familiar activation sound of the telepod.

     1) "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"
     2) "Could I borrow your diary to train her with?"
     3) "Okay, thanks! I'll call you back when she's ready."

>2

 "Could I borrow your diary to train her with?"

 "Ummm." There's a long, tense silence down the phone. "I don't think
 she needs to know that kind of stuff. Some of what I wrote in there is
 kind of personal." It stands to reason. Jenny never lets you read her
 diary, so it makes sense she wouldn't let your robot read it either.
 But it means you can only make the robot so Jenny-like.

     1) "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"
     2) "Could I borrow your diary to train her with?"
     3) "Okay, thanks! I'll call you back when she's ready."

>3

 "Okay, thanks! I'll call you back when she's ready."

 "Back to painting signs," Jenny says.

 Before you can hang up, she adds, "Thanks so much for doing this!
 ...uh. Actually. Granny's started me doing some ad sign painting. It
 would save a lot of time if she could do that too...? I don't know if
 that's too much to ask... Oops, I'd better go. Call me later if you
 need anything."

 You hang up.

 her social conditioning around propriety runs pretty deep.

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."
     2) "Could you hand me your sash?"
     3) "Can you give me some tips about plant care?"
     4) "Could I have the contents of your chassis?"

 singlehanded?"

 "Can you write me a poem?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow sighs faintly. "You won't be sorry you asked."
 She clears her throat.

 "Bloodshed is red
 Mood swings are blue
 taffy is sweet
 I like it."

     1) "Bravo! Well done!"
     2) "I'm really coming to respect you as an artist."
     3) "That was terrible."
     4) "Ooh, do me another one!"

 "The Trundle Bed of Tomorrow

 "Can you paint a sign advertising seasonal flowers?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow sounds exasperated. "You won't be sorry you
 asked." The Jenny of Tomorrow gets to work trying to draw a flower,
 but she gets bogged down when it becomes obvious she's never seen an
 actual flower at all. Her rendition looks a lot like the pattern on
 the upholstery.

 There aren't any pictures, so you'll just have to imagine what the

 It's a thin paperback, barely more than a pamphlet. The cover is
 black, except for the poet's name, T. Brandt. You've never gotten
 further than the first page or so, but The Jenny of Tomorrow might be
 able to do something with it. If for instance you need to teach her a
 disdain for authority and a general lack of enthusiasm.

 Full of helpful hints and line-drawings of utensils in silhouette. If
 you've ever wondered whether the dessert fork should be placed to the
 right or the left of the steak knife, this is the book for you. The
 narration of the guide, as with all the works in this series, is
 relentlessly positive and enthusiastic. There is nothing negative in

 Off to the east is the kitchen area, panelled in faux walnut, and
 there's a bathroom, south, just for the sake of verisimilitude. The
 robots do not need to use it.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow is sitting properly on the sofa and wearing a
 sash. The sash was a good touch, but it's not very Jenny.

 Someone left this book in the locker room at high school, and it's
 been making the rounds.

 The cover of the novel shows a rugged man on a horse in the
 foreground, and in the background a woman standing in front of a
 burning ranch house. "One cowboy! One notorious safe-cracker! And the
 heart of a woman, forever locked!"

 There's a lot about what good, down-home folks the heroes are - not
 like the snobs and bank people, who deserve to be robbed.

 The book tends to fall open on its own to the page about the Dubuque
 Bank Robbery, where the safe-cracker is listening to the fall of the
 tumblers, and he realizes he can open a woman's heart by listening
 just as closely.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow says, "I don't know if you've considered
 constructing the Cowboy of Tomorrow?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow emits a pre-recorded gusty sigh.

 According to the introduction, it promises to eliminate foreign,
 archaic, and slang usages from the owner's vocabulary, leaving behind
 only that which is idiomatic and suitable for written prose and
 broadcast television. There are no pictures.

 "Why is it a cowboy, and not a cowman?" muses Jenny of Tomorrow.

>talk to jenny

 The Jenny of Tomorrow begins to speak: "Howdy, friend! I am ye Jenny
 of Tomorrow." She looks nothing like actual Jenny, which is
 disconcerting.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tosses her hair.

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."
     2) "Could you hand me your sash?"
     3) "Can you give me some tips about plant care?"
     4) "How do you feel about parades?"
     5) "Can you write me a poem?"
     6) "Can you listen to my troubles?"
     7) "Can you paint a sign advertising seasonal flowers?"
     8) "Do you remember how to unlock my purse?"
 9) "Is it true you fought off the Brain Guzzlers almost
 singlehanded?"
     10) "I'm done talking now."

 "Can you write me a poem?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow mimes drawing a pistol, spinning it around her
 finger a few times, and holstering it again. "Sure!" She clears her
 throat.

 "Roses are red
 violets are blue
 sugar is sweet
 I like it."

     1) "Bravo! Well done!"
     2) "I'm really coming to respect you as an artist."
     3) "That was terrible."
     4) "Ooh, do me another one!"

 "Ooh, do me another one!"

 "Roses are red

     1) "Bravo! Well done!"

     3) "That was terrible."
     4) "Ooh, do me another one!"

 "Mary had a little lamb,

     3) "That was terrible."
     4) "Ooh, do me another one!"

 "Bravo! Well done!"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow accepts your praise with a modest smile. "It
 just came to me. The world is my inspiration."

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

>read report

 The report covers the pine nut harvest and pine nut futures. It
 describes pine nut stockpile levels and average pine nut size. It
 projects pine nut earnings for years to come. There are graphs
 representing different weather possibilities. It even has a map of the
 three different agricultural zones in New Mexico, with charts of how
 many frost days you can expect in each.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow crosses her metal legs, the opposite way from
 before.

>give report to jenny

 The Jenny of Tomorrow eagerly studies the annual Canyonville Pine Nut
 Harvest report, committing all of its details to memory. "Finances:

 "Do you remember how to unlock my purse?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow crosses her legs. "Oh yes!  We based the
 combination on something important! The years of peak pine-nut
 production were 13, 34, and 45."

 She reaches over and spins the dial a few times, and your purse clicks
 open.

 It's pink, and it locks with a combination, so that your most personal
 and private possessions can't be snooped-on by other people.

 Thing is, the Jenny of Tomorrow changed the combination last week
 during training, and you never got around to writing down the new
 combo.

 In the pink purse is a library flyer.

 You haven't dialed the purse to any combination yet.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tosses her hair.

 her throat.

 "There's a colorful man baptized Max

 "Ayup!"

 The Queen heads over to the kitchen and places the call.

 You're not able to hear everything from her side of the conversation,
 but she comes back a moment later, complaining that the person at the
 other end described her composition as "drivel" and "doggerel."

 Every Pine Nut Queen needs a sash. This used to be yours: pink satin
 with white lettering.

 You slip the sash over your own head. It feels good. Familiar. "I
 observe you take refuge in roles assigned by other people," remarks
 the Jenny of Tomorrow.

>look at jenny

 The chassis doesn't contain a drinks cabinet, because the Pine Nut
 Queen is clean-living and doesn't imbibe. Her mini-micro brain uses
 some of the same circuitry as the Wife of Tomorrow, though.

 There's also a gleaming yellow button on the back of her neck.

 The button resets the Jenny of Tomorrow, booting her with a new
 personality and causing her to forget any training she's undergone so
 far. It has been pressed two times today.

 frankly a little on the underdressed side.

 sure I want to."
     2) "I'm afraid of being separated from Jenny if I go to college."
     3) "I keep having flashbacks to the Brain-Guzzlers attack."

>2

 There's a lot to explain, and it's hard to get started, so you circle
 around the topic for quite a while.

 Jenny of Tomorrow nods. "College isn't forever, but it is a big change
 in a person's life, and it can change relationships. Unfortunately,
 you've a difficult decision in front of you. But there are more
 possibilities than you've currently considered. For instance, there
 are correspondence courses if you wish to study without leaving
 Canyonville. Most of all, you've not talked to Jenny about this, and
 it would help a lot to get her opinion. She's probably worried about
 that part of the future too."

 "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 If it's possible to look both seductive and bored at the same time,
 the Jenny of Tomorrow is doing a good impression of it. "Known skills:
 etiquette; security; active listening; innuendo; finances; pine-nuts;
 weather; rhyme; fromage; ennui; snobbery; painting; advertising;
 ...and that's it."

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 You can't go that way.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow eyes the sofa upholstery. "Would you say these
 flowers were better described as puce, or venetian red?"

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ordinary Kitchen</span>
 Nothing has ever been prepared in the Ordinary Kitchen, so it is
 extremely clean and a little short on food and utensils. Still, there
 are the cabinets (faux walnut) and the sink (functional) to help teach
 your robot how to interact with a real kitchen. And there's a stove,
 though to the best of your knowledge the oven has never actually been
 used.

 The telephone hangs on the wall, if you need to call Jenny.

>call jenny

 Jenny answers the phone on the first ring. "Yoshida Floral," she says.
 "If you're calling about the misprinted coupon in the Canyonville
 Gazette, we will be honoring it through next week."

 "Jenny, it's me again," you say.

 "Oh, hi!"

     1) "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"
     2) "Could I borrow your diary to train her with?"
     3) "Fake Jenny is ready for her closeup."
     4) "Okay, thanks! I'll call you back when she's ready."
     5) "I'm worried about moving away from you for college."

>5

 You take a deep breath and then just say it. "I'm worried about moving
 away from you for college."

 Jenny is silent for a long moment. "Me too," she says. "But I didn't
 want to sound like I'm keeping you from doing what you want. And I
 know it means a lot to your father, for you to go."

 "Yeah."

 "I really want to talk about this more," Jenny says. "Sometime when
 I'm not watching the store. We need to talk in person."

 But at least now the topic isn't lurking like one of those Guzzlers in
 a creepy yellow egg-seed, waiting to climb out.

     1) "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"

 "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"

 "Well... she'll need to know plant types, so she can answer questions
 in the shop. She should have enough finance skill to handle the
 register. She should be able to paint ad signs, too. And if she can
 bake, that would help with the illusion. Otherwise... you know what
 I'm like!"

 Before you can hang up, she says, "Thanks again!"

 You hang up.

 Jenny answers the phone after a couple of rings. "Yoshida Floral," she
 says. "You'll never exceed a bouquet from Yoshida."

 "Jenny, it's me again," you say.

 "Oh, hi!"

     1) "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"
     2) "Could I borrow your diary to train her with?"
     3) "Fake Jenny is ready for her closeup."
     4) "Okay, thanks! I'll call you back when she's ready."

 "Fake Jenny is ready for her closeup," you say. This is it: Jenny's
 going to judge your work.

 "Wait, really? I'll be right over!"

 ***
 *** "So I can test her?" Jenny's at the door. She looks... like
 someone has just given her the key out of prison. Wow. Maybe you
 didn't quite realize how much she hates working in that shop every
 day.

 "Go for it," you say, and gesture at Jenny of Tomorrow.

 "Okay," says Jenny. "I'll just try to think of stuff I would ask
 her... I mean that I would ask me. Or, no, stuff that other people
 would ask me."

 You give her a little nod. It's a sensible approach.

 ***
 ***"Can you give me some tips about plant care?"

 If it's possible to look both seductive and bored at the same time,
 the Jenny of Tomorrow is doing a good impression of it. "Pine-nuts are
 a tolerable plant highly recommended by the local Nut Farmers
 Association."

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "How much change would you give if I bought an apple sapling with a
 five dollar bill?"

 If it's possible to look both seductive and bored at the same time,
 the Jenny of Tomorrow is doing a good impression of it. "That would be
 four dollars and sixty-nine cents, accounting for the six cents of
 local tax on top of the standard sapling price of twenty-five cents."

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "Can you listen to my troubles?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow shrugs. "You won't be sorry you asked."

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>3

 You don't try to say anything. Best just to wait and see how this
 plays out.

 "Can you paint a sign advertising seasonal flowers?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow sniffs commandingly. "If I must." The Jenny of
 Tomorrow gets to work trying to draw a flower, but she gets bogged
 down when it becomes obvious she's never seen an actual flower at all.
 Her rendition looks a lot like the pattern on the upholstery.

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>1

 "I don't know why she does that," you say.

 Neither Jenny of Today nor Jenny of Tomorrow look your way.

 "What's the weather forecast?"

 If it's possible to look both seductive and bored at the same time,
 the Jenny of Tomorrow is doing a good impression of it. "We're looking
 at light rainfall starting by mid morning and stopping by Wednesday. I
 mean, I think. I can't look outside from here."

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "Where are you really from?"

 If it's possible to look both seductive and bored at the same time,
 the Jenny of Tomorrow is doing a good impression of it. "I was
 manufactured right here in Canyonville!" she says brightly.

 Jenny giggles. "That's... yeah. That's perfect."


     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "I'd be worried about her trying to use the oven when she doesn't know
 how," comments Jenny. "Fire safety is important."

 It looks like Actual Jenny has something else to add, so you wait for
 it.

 "Um," says Jenny. "This is what you think I'm like? I don't even
 recognize me."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Home-like Showroom</span>
 There are plenty of actual laboratories at MinSystems Labs. This isn't
 one of those: you train your robots in an ordinary household setting.

 Off to the east is the kitchen area, panelled in faux walnut, and
 there's a bathroom, south, just for the sake of verisimilitude. The
 robots do not need to use it.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow is sitting properly on the sofa, and looking
 frankly a little on the underdressed side.

 You can also see a coffee table here.

 "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tilts her head pleasantly. "Known skills:
 poetry; rhyme; etiquette; ...and that's it."

 "Can you write me a poem?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow pauses a moment before replying, "I'd love to!"
 She clears her throat.

 "Although we ne'er may meet again,
  Enticed by you I shall remain.
 You graced the front of Pine Gazette,
  That meeting I shall ne'er forget.
 I would not say, 'I love,' but still,
  Forgetting you is all uphill.
 Sweet girl! though only once we met,
  you'd ornament my new Corvette."

     1) "Bravo! Well done!"
     2) "I'm really coming to respect you as an artist."
     3) "That was terrible."
     4) "Ooh, do me another one!"
 5) "Let's phone the librarian now and you can recite that for
 her."

>5

 "Let's phone the librarian now and you can recite that for her," you
 say.

 "Sure!"

 The Queen heads over to the kitchen and places the call.

 You're not able to hear everything from her side of the conversation,
 but a few moments later, there's a familiar sound from the telepod.

>examine telepod

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tosses her hair.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Standard Bathroom</span>
 Sink, taps, toilet, even a bath: this is a fully functional bathroom
 in every sense except that it's not meant to be used by anyone.
 There's a little closet, not big enough to step into, that would be
 used to store clean towels if this were a normal household.

 Everything is very tidy in here.

 The telepod sits in the corner here, just to keep it out of the way.

 You can also see some melted scissors here.

>examine telepod

 A large, egg-shaped pod about the size of a garbage can, but
 lightweight enough for you to lift.  There's an open hatch in the
 side.

 In the telepod is a French botanical book.

>get book

 (the French botanical book)
 Taken.

>read botanical

 The stamping on the spine says Société botanique de France, and there
 are lots of very pretty drawings of flower types inside.
 Unfortunately, you can't read a word of it. But the Jenny of Tomorrow
 might be able to, with the proper training.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Home-like Showroom</span>
 There are plenty of actual laboratories at MinSystems Labs. This isn't
 one of those: you train your robots in an ordinary household setting.

 Off to the east is the kitchen area, panelled in faux walnut, and
 there's a bathroom, south, just for the sake of verisimilitude. The
 robots do not need to use it.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow is sitting properly on the sofa, and looking
 frankly a little on the underdressed side.

 You can also see a coffee table here.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow crosses her metal legs, the opposite way from
 before.

>give botanical to jenny

 The Jenny of Tomorrow flips through French botanical book, but says,
 "Sorry, I need better French before I can understand such a text."

>give rhyming to jenny

 The Jenny of Tomorrow scrutinizes the French Rhyming Dictionary.
 "Rhyme: Already know that one. French: All of this learning sends my

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tosses her hair.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow pores over the French botanical book. "Botany:

 The Jenny of Tomorrow rapidly studies the annual Canyonville Pine Nut

 The Jenny of Tomorrow begins to speak: "Hi! I am the Jenny of
 Tomorrow." She looks nothing like actual Jenny, which is
 disconcerting.

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tosses her hair.

     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."
     2) "Can you give me some tips about plant care?"

 "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 The Jenny of Tomorrow lights up. "Known skills: botany; finances;

 "Can you listen to my troubles?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tilts her head pleasantly. "Sure!"

 1) "My father wants me to go to a technical college, and I'm not
 sure I want to."
     2) "I keep having flashbacks to the Brain-Guzzlers attack."

>2

 You talk about the ooze, and the noise of the saucers. You talk about
 the nightmares. You talk about the time when you thought Jenny was
 dead. It's not a very organized explanation.

 Jenny of Tomorrow listens for a while. "I fear you've experienced
 something very frightening," she says. "It's almost as though you've
 been to war. After something like that, you may expect some long-term
 effects."


     1) "Remind me what you're trained in right now."

 "Can you paint a sign advertising seasonal flowers?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow pauses a moment before replying, "Sure!" The

 later, there's a full-color sign wreathed in a border of
 botanically-accurate heather blooms, surrounding exquisite lettering
 inviting the buyer to buy seedlings now, 5 cents for a packet.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ordinary Kitchen</span>
 Nothing has ever been prepared in the Ordinary Kitchen, so it is
 extremely clean and a little short on food and utensils. Still, there
 are the cabinets (faux walnut) and the sink (functional) to help teach
 your robot how to interact with a real kitchen. And there's a stove,
 though to the best of your knowledge the oven has never actually been
 used.

 The telephone hangs on the wall, if you need to call Jenny.

>call jenny

 Jenny answers the phone after a couple of rings. "Yoshida Floral," she
 says. "We have a special on roses all this week."

 "Jenny, it's me again," you say.

 "Oh, hi!"

     1) "Remind me what the Jenny of Tomorrow should do?"
     2) "Could I borrow your diary to train her with?"
     3) "Fake Jenny is ready for her closeup."
     4) "Okay, thanks! I'll call you back when she's ready."

>3

 "Fake Jenny is ready for her closeup," you say. This is it: Jenny's
 going to judge your work.

 "Wait, really? I'll be right over!"

 ***
 *** "So I can test her?" Jenny's at the door. She looks... like
 someone has just given her the key out of prison. Wow. Maybe you
 didn't quite realize how much she hates working in that shop every
 day.

 "Go for it," you say, and gesture at Jenny of Tomorrow.

 "Okay," says Jenny. "I'll just try to think of stuff I would ask
 her... I mean that I would ask me. Or, no, stuff that other people
 would ask me."

 You give her a little nod. It's a sensible approach.

 ***
 ***"Can you give me some tips about plant care?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tilts her head pleasantly. "In this part of New
 Mexico, plant beans indoors in early May, outdoors in late May, and
 expect to harvest in September to mid-October."

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "How much change would you give if I bought an apple sapling with a
 five dollar bill?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow pauses a moment before replying, "That would be
 four dollars and sixty-nine cents, accounting for the six cents of
 local tax on top of the standard Conkling sapling price of twenty-five
 cents. Or, if they went for the more deluxe Tom Blake Hard Times, the
 base price would be fifty cents with twelve cents tax, for change of
 $4.38."

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "Can you listen to my troubles?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tilts her head pleasantly. "Sure!"

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "Can you paint a sign advertising seasonal flowers?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow plays a mood-enhancing chime. "You won't be
 sorry you asked!" The Jenny of Tomorrow gets to work with pastels on
 board. Thirty minutes later, there's a full-color sign wreathed in a
 border of botanically-accurate lavender blooms, surrounding exquisite
 lettering inviting the buyer to buy seedlings now, 5 cents for a
 packet.

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "Do you know how to bake Snickerdoodles?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tilts her head pleasantly. "I could, though I
 could also do something else if you wanted. What would you say to
 Arugula Mashed Potato Divinity?"

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>3

 You don't try to say anything. Best just to wait and see how this
 plays out.

 "What's the weather forecast?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow pauses a moment before replying, "We're looking
 at rising pressure starting in a few hours and stopping by Monday."

     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "Where are you really from?"

 The Jenny of Tomorrow tilts her head pleasantly. "I was manufactured
 right here in Canyonville!" she says brightly.

 Jenny giggles. "That's... yeah. That's perfect."


     1) "I don't know why she does that."
     2) "Good, isn't she?"
     3) "..."

>2

 "Good, isn't she?" you say.

 Jenny flashes you a smile.

 "Is it true you knew Tokyo Rose?" Jenny asks the robot.

 "I don't know who that is," says the Jenny of Tomorrow.

 When people find out Jenny was at Gila River Internment Camp, they
 come out with all kinds of questions, even though she was still a
 little kid when she left. Questions about whether she knew spies
 there, and what it was like, and why her family didn't go back to
 Fresno afterwards. Since Jenny's Granny doesn't talk about that topic,
 Jenny doesn't know the answer either. She told you once that the main
 thing she remembers is being warned to look out for scorpions.

 Jenny's being very quiet, looking at the Jenny of Tomorrow, so you
 say, "She isn't able to get upset about stupid questions."

 Jenny nods. "That's good. Useful feature."

 The Jenny of Tomorrow looks at Jenny hopefully and smiles.

 Everyone is quiet for a moment, waiting for Jenny to say whatever
 she's going to say.

 It looks like Actual Jenny has something else to add, so you wait for
 it.

 "I'm... honestly I'm kind of amazed," says Jenny. "She's so detailed.
 And definitely a better painter than I am."

     1) "I've had a lot of time to study the original."
     2) "I love you."

>2

 "I love you."

 It gets easier to say with practice. And it seems to need repetition,
 because every time you think things are finally clear between you and
 Jenny, they get muddied up again. But you're getting better at it.
 Maybe now you can actually talk about what's going to happen after
 this summer.
