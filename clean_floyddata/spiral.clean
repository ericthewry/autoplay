 And then you hear something. The low, steady rumbling of a train. As
 your eyelids slowly peel back, you feel like you're swimming up to the
 surface of a deep, black ocean. For a while, the disorientation is
 overwhelming, and you can't think about anything. But once you start
 thinking, you can't stop.

 Carriage
 It's dark, and the only artificial light is flickering, but it doesn't
 take much light for you to know that you're in trouble. Most of your
 body is numb. Directly opposite you is a man, plastered with fear,
 gagged. His arms are tied to his sides, his legs bound together in
 three different places. The numbness gives way to pain, as though
 needles are shooting out of all your blood vessels and you start to
 feel more than just your pounding heart: the tight ropes digging into
 you, the rigid metal floor, the stale air, the gag over your mouth.

 you, the rigid metal floor, the stale air, the gag over your mouth.

>examine me


 You can see your legs stretched out in front of you, tied together at
 the ankles, shins and thighs with thick ropes that really seem to bite
 into your skin. Just looking at it makes you shuffle in discomfort,
 but it doesn't make it any better. In the dark light you can't tell if
 you're wearing blue jeans or black ones - you think black - but either
 way they're very dusty. You look down at your similarly hue-ambiguous
 sweater, which is also marked by tight ropes around your upper and
 lower arms. Your mouth is covered by a patch that is stuck right over
 your lips: you can only make muffled, incoherent groaning noises.

>inventory


 Your hands are bound to your sides, and honestly, there's nothing here
 that you'd want to pick up anyway.

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Carriage</span>
 You look around again. The carriage is small and is practically empty.
 On the floor in front of you is a sea of dead wasps - there's not a
 live one to be found. You look over at your only living companion,
 tied up and leaning against the wall opposite you. Your eyes meet, and
 you try to convey sympathy, and you try to read sympathy from his, but
 that wouldn't do either of you any good even if you <span class="floydstyle em">could</span>
 hide the fear. The light flickers off for a second, sending you
 temporarily into darkness.

>examine wasps


 Disgustingly, there are about a hundred dead things on the floor -
 concentrated in the centre of the carriage - bobbing up and down with
 the train's movement in a grotesque dance. They're bigger than wasps,
 and they're red, with menacing needles for stinging. It's a good thing
 they're all dead.

>examine man


 You look over at your only companion. He's looking as battered as you
 feel, with disheveled black hair, a grimy face and crumpled clothes,
 dusty and discoloured. He's not agitated, or nervous, but you can just
 about see a forlorn, almost despairing expression if you catch his
 eyes at the right moment. Something about him is familiar, but you're
 damned if you know what it is.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[ To switch perspective, use the BE command. ]</span>

>examine me


 Your legs are tied together at the ankles, shins and thighs with thick
 ropes that really seem to bite into your skin. In the dark light you
 can't tell if you're wearing blue jeans or black ones - you think
 black - but either way they're very dusty. Further ropes bind your
 upper and lower arms, and you can feel your dry skin and lips where
 the gag is stuck over them.

 Panic is setting in. Breathing getting heavy, blood pumping faster and
 faster. Thoughts and possibilities, each more frightening than the
 last, are starting to bombard you, and frankly, you'd rather die and
 be free of it forever. Each dread is coming at you, like a spectre
 from the air that wants to wrap its cold hands around your brain and
 banish you to a place of endless torment.

>think


 For a moment, everything is blank. Tabula rasa. You could be anyone -
 a terrorist, a psychopath, a drug addict, a prostitute, a mugger. But
 then memories flood in all at once, as if you'd asked to borrow a
 lighter and got your house set on fire instead. You're Helen Wright.
 You can picture the faces of your mum and dad and your older sister
 Mary in your house in London; you can see the bright white walls of
 that house - everything white and pristine, like a hospital; you can
 see yourself playing with dolls at the foot of your bed; you can see
 yourself telling Mary to leave you alone; you see the park, you're on
 the swings, you're down the slide, you're on your own, playing with
 the playground grass; you're at school, you're scribbling in your
 book, you're the last one out of the classroom, and the first one in.
 You're eight years old, and the memories are still coming...

>make muffled, incoherent groaning noises


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>think


 Faster and faster, your memories are coming back, and you can't keep
 up with them. Then, suddenly, they stop. The last one is just an
 ordinary day on the London Underground and you're going to lectures.
 How did you get from there to here? That can't be the end - that can't
 have been the last thing that happened. Unless perhaps some random
 madman came along, beat you up and locked you in here. But who would
 want to kidnap you? There's nothing special about you - far from it.

>remember


 There aren't any particular memories going through your head at the
 moment.<span class="floydstyle em"> [ You can REMEMBER things. If you see something in bold</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">print in the description of a memory, then you can use the remember</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">command with that too. ]</span>

>be a mugger


 You can't become that.

>think


 You know who you are now: Helen Wright, just another horrible person.
 Your memories have come back, though apparently not all of them.

 There's a sudden clanging noise, and the room flashes momentarily red.
 Your heart rate goes up. Something's happening. The red light keeps
 flashing in a regular cycle, and two small vents opens on the wall,
 just little circular holes. There's the sound of rushing air, and you
 fear what might come out of those dark tubes. You feel a certain
 warmth in the air as it hits you, and a vile, acrid smell. It's
 certainly not the ventilation. Then the flashing light suddenly stops,
 the vent covers slide back into place, and the train rumbles on along
 as though nothing happened at all.

>be the man



 <span class="floydstyle i">Carriage</span> (as Ross)
 When you look around again, the most striking thing is the floor:
 dozens of dead insects are scattered around it, and you can't see a
 single living one. What does that mean? That you've been here for
 ages? Or is there a fly trap? You try not to dwell on it, and look
 around the whole carriage. It's not big, and it doesn't take long to
 realise that there's nothing else here, except the other captive and
 the flickering light. The shadows are deep, oppressive. The noise of
 the train's movement is a dull but constant clanking. The air is
 stale.

 You try to think about what happened. But nothing is coming.
 Literally, nothing. And who <span class="floydstyle em">is</span> that over there?

 Since it doesn't seem like anything is happening, you wonder if it
 might be OK to get some sleep.

>remember


 Who are you? The question bounces around in your mind for a moment,
 with no answer forthcoming. But then it's as though someone opens a
 tap, and things start trickling back. Your name is Ross. You can see
 your flat in London, your mum and dad, arguing, doors slamming,
 crumpled pieces of paper on the floor. There's your brother, hitting
 and kicking you, and you trying to fight back. You can see yourself,
 six or seven years old, looking at a large rash, going to the
 hospital. But then the memories stop, and you feel drained. For God's
 sake, why is this so hard to remember? It's there, and it's coming
 back, but it's just so much effort to get it.

 As your mind begins to wake up, thoughts and possibilities start
 whirling around, bombarding and confusing you. Your limbs feel so
 stiff, but are slowly getting better.

>examine me


 It really is as bad as it feels. Your arms are bound to your sides
 with one rope that crosses your chest and one over the stomach, and
 both are hurting like hell as they dig into your skin through your
 shirt. You wouldn't rate your chances of being able to wriggle free,
 and you don't think you could even move anywhere: three more ropes are
 bound tightly around your ankles, shins and thighs. The worst thing,
 though, is the thick tape covering your mouth. If it ever does come
 off, it'll probably rip off your lips with it.

>examine her


 She looks frightened, of course. Her eyes are wide and she's looking
 around everywhere, presumably trying to see a way out. There's
 <span class="floydstyle em">something</span> familiar about her, but you don't know what it is.
 She's quite tall. Very, very pale. Shoulder-length brown hair. You get
 the impression that it's only as tangled as it is because of the
 situation - knocked out, gagged, tied up and thrown into this place.
 You flinch just thinking about it. You hope this isn't your fault. You
 don't know why it would be.

 You're feeling quite sleepy.

>sleep


 You're not getting anywhere by being awake, so you don't think it will
 matter to try getting some sleep. It's hardly comfortable, but it
 isn't noisy - in fact it's far quieter than London. You push yourself
 over onto your side and shut your eyes.
>wake




 The beast hisses. Something rips through you, wrenching out your soul,
 which floats through the vacuum of space to become part of the
 machine. There's the Earth, with a whirlwind of nature being sucked
 into one end of the machine, and there's a big tube running along the
 top of it, until it gets to the beast at the other end. The beast
 snarls. It wants more, and then more still, and then more and more,
 and the machine has to go faster and faster. It has your soul now too.
 You're being pulled in towards the machine, and you don't want to go
 there, you don't want to! The beast roars.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Platform</span> (as Ross)
 You're on a ledge jutting out from the machine, a metal platform. You
 get a real sense of the enormity of the machine from this perspective,
 as it stretches as far as you can see in both directions. The Earth
 and the beast themselves are just out of sight.

 There's an unusual archway in the east wall, which is doing something
 to the light so that you can't see through it.

 You're not going to sell yourself to the machine. You've got to get
 your soul back.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>look down


 The everlasting nothingness is out there, dotted with stars.

>think


 Just another idiotic idealist here, who thinks he can make a
 difference but is just as powerless as everyone else, if not more so
 for being such a fucking weakling.

>examine archway


 The archway in the east wall is an unusual shape, and is distorting
 the light so much that you can't see through it. The edges are very
 clearly defined though, so that the whole thing looks a bit like a
 sticker.

>examine machine


 It's a monstrosity, groaning and clanking and humming as it tears away
 all the beauty from the Earth. The machine gets ever faster, to
 satisfy the growing hunger of the beast.

>touch archway


 You feel nothing unexpected.

>peel sticker


 You feel around the edges of the arch, then peel it away, removing the
 way to the east. You now have a sickle.

>examine sticker


 You can't see any such thing here.

>examine sickle


 A dependable worker's tool. You got it by removing an arch from the
 wall.

>go east


 You bang your fist against the closed wall of the machine. It feels
 somehow delicate, as though it could easily be cut open.

>cut machine


 You'd love to, but you're not sure you can do it with just your hands.

>cut machine with sickle


 You don't think that would do much damage.

>put sickle back


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>put sickle on wall


 Dropped.

>examine east wall


 The closed wall of the machine. It looks somehow spongy, as though you
 could easily cut into it.

>take sickle


 You expropriate the sickle.

>cut wall


 [ You should specify a compass direction. ]

>cut east


 You plunge the sickle into the wall, and it cuts itself into the shape
 of an arch, leading east.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: West</span> (as Ross)
 Complicated machinery is everywhere, clunking and scraping and turning
 and chugging away at the task of destroying the planet. At the north
 end of the room is a single stake, standing upright, and just beyond
 it is a gap in the floor, so that you can see through to the void of
 space below. A set of stairs leads up, and the machine room itself
 extends eastward.

 An archway leads west.

>examine machinery


 Cogs are turning, machines whirring, lights flashing and pistons
 hammering, in service to the beast.

>examine stake


 There's a single pole in the ground, and a round hole next to it where
 another one could go.

>examine gap


 The everlasting nothingness is out there, dotted with stars.

>examine stairs


 A long, metal staircase.

>examine hole


 The archway in the west wall is an unusual shape, and is distorting
 the light so much that you can't see through it. The edges are very
 clearly defined though, so that the whole thing looks a bit like a
 sticker.

>examine round hole


 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the upright stake.

>get pole


 You give the stake an experimental wobble, and it looks like it would
 come free, but you think it would make more sense to complete the
 pair, rather than remove it completely.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: Central</span> (as Ross)
 Giant cogs are turning, forming a messy pattern that snakes around the
 room, interspersed with other machines whose function is entirely
 opaque to you. Some are spewing steam, some are making horrid
 squelching noises, some have bright flashing lights. There is a wall
 to the east, and many of the cogs cut right through it. You can go
 back to the west.

 A small crystal is here - a part of your soul ready to be taken back.

>examine crystal


 You're not sure it'll ever be the same after being ravaged by the
 beast.

>get it


 This part of you is encased in crystal, and you snatch it up from the
 floor, wondering where the other pieces might be. They're probably in
 the clutches of the machine already.

>examine cogs


 You walk up close to one of the machines. A face stares back at you,
 anguished and pale, frozen in the act of screaming. You step back.

>examine east wall


 (the patch on the wall)
 There's a wall to the east, but some of the cogs and other machines
 cut right through it, so maybe there is another area on the other
 side. What's more, there's a rectangular patch on the wall where a
 door might once have been.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: East</span> (as Ross)
 It's a continuation of the machine room, with more of the squeaking,
 pulsing mechanisms and gizmos. A trapdoor in the floor leads into
 darkness via a ladder. Emanating from it is a symphony of slicing,
 cutting and crashing sounds, and there's a machine up here that's
 buzzing and shaking in time with it.

 An archway leads west.

>examine gizmos


 Cogs are turning, machines whirring, lights flashing and pistons
 hammering, in service to the beast.

>down?


 <span class="floydstyle em">[ Verb not available. ]</span>

>examine machine


 The machine is buzzing, whirring and even shaking. No wires are
 visible, but there's a raised bit of the floor connecting the machine
 to the hole in the floor. You imagine this machine is controlling the
 slicing you can hear.

>go down


 You look down the hole. The ladder just vanishes into blackness, but
 you can hear the sounds of slicing blades and other destructive
 machinery. Now, now. Let's hold on for... just a moment longer.

>examine north wall


 There are just more machines that way.

>turn machine off


 There are no visible controls on the machine. You'll have to take a
 more physical approach.

>examine east wall


 There are just more machines that way.

>examine ladder


 There's a trapdoor in the floor with a ladder that leads down into
 darkness. The music of slashing, grinding and cutting is emanating
 from it. There's a raised part of the floor connecting the hole to a
 particularly loud machine here in the room, which you assume is in
 control of the slicing action.

>examine w


 You've cut an archway through the wall there, so you can go to the
 rest of the machine room.

>close trapdoor


 That's not something you can close.

>peel sticker


 You feel around the edges of the arch, then peel it away, removing the

 You fall through the hole, and drop into space outside the machine.
 You can't scream, and you can't breathe.
>look


 You bolt awake. Still in the train carriage, trundling along. You
 manage to push yourself back into a sitting position.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Carriage</span> (as Ross)
 The metal carriage is a deep grey with shadowy corners, and the
 fluorescent lamp on the ceiling is on the blink, so that every so
 often you're sent into total darkness. Your only company is the girl
 opposite you and a sea of dead wasps. You don't know where you're
 going or how you got here.

 There's that clanking sound again. As before, a red light fills the
 room every second, and little vents open on the walls. There's the
 sound of rushing air, a horrid smell, and then they shut.

>examine vents


 You can just about see the outline of the circular covers of those
 tubes. You have no idea what they're for, but the way that red light
 comes on and the way the air gets so foul when they're open suggests
 that they're not your friends.

>sleep


 You're not getting anywhere by being awake, so you don't think it will
 matter to try getting some sleep. It's hardly comfortable, but it

 You climb the stairs, and the stairs themselves fly upwards, so that
 with each footfall you're much higher up. Eventually the staircase
 halts, and you step off onto a platform.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Beneath the Pipe</span> (as Ross)
 You're standing on a small platform, watching severed parts of Earth
 shoot past through the pipe just above you that leads to the beast. By
 this point in their processing, things are barely recognisable as
 belonging to Nature - there are some earthy colours and familiar
 shapes, but it's mostly just a kind of tangled mush. Bits of it escape
 the flow and trickle onto the floor, creating a pungent deathly odour.
 A tiny ladder will take you right into the flow.

 There's a loud sucking noise, and a small crystal suddenly drops out
 of the flow, strangely intact.

>examine crystal


 (the piece of soul)
 You're not sure it'll ever be the same after being ravaged by the
 beast.

>get it


 Now you've got two of these soul things. Something tells you there are
 seven in total... at least, that's what you're going to aim for.

 You suddenly see a burst of colour floating past you, and it turns out
 to be a glass sphere drifting up towards the pipe. Presumably
 someone's soul is within. You have no time to save it before it is
 caught by the flow and vanishes down the tube.

>examine flow


 Material from the Earth is gushing through this pipe, on its way to
 the beast.

>examine ladder


 A little ladder leads up to the material surging through the tube.

 You suddenly catch sight of a human face, burnt and disfigured,
 shooting past in the tube.

>exits


 <span class="floydstyle em">[ Verb not available. ]</span>

>go up


 Is this really the only option? You hesitate a minute and let the
 Earth gush past your eyes. Then you step in. The flow instantly
 arrests you, seizes you, hurls you, compacts you, bashes you, forces
 you into compliance. The beast and its insatiable hunger is waiting.
 Waiting for you.

 "Hello, lost one," it hisses. "You should have known there's no
 escape..."

 You fly between its jaws and for a moment find yourself hanging at the
 top of its digestive tract, looking down at a fiery, rocky end. Then
 you scream.

 This material has been sucked out of the Earth and processed into a
 barely recognisable mush. Every so often a human form, or just a face
 flashes past, usually disfigured, burnt and incomplete. Except for the
 bits that have slipped out and coated the floor in a deathly crust,
 it's all headed for the beast's stomach.

>go down


 As you climb down the stairs, the entire staircase shoots down,
 landing in the huge machine room you came from.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: West</span> (as Ross)
 Complicated machinery is everywhere, clunking and scraping and turning
 and chugging away at the task of destroying the planet. At the north
 end of the room is a single stake, standing upright, and just beyond
 it is a gap in the floor, so that you can see through to the void of
 space below. A set of stairs leads up, and the machine room itself
 extends eastward.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: Central</span> (as Ross)
 Giant cogs are turning, forming a messy pattern that snakes around the
 room, interspersed with other machines whose function is entirely
 opaque to you. Some are spewing steam, some are making horrid
 squelching noises, some have bright flashing lights. There is a wall
 to the east, and many of the cogs cut right through it. You can go
 back to the west.

 An archway leads east.

 You feel around the edges of the arch, then peel it away, removing the

 You climb the stairs, and the stairs themselves fly upwards, so that
 with each footfall you're much higher up. Eventually the staircase
 halts, and you step off onto a platform.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Beneath the Pipe</span> (as Ross)
 You're standing on a small platform, watching severed parts of Earth
 shoot past through the pipe just above you that leads to the beast. By
 this point in their processing, things are barely recognisable as
 belonging to Nature - there are some earthy colours and familiar
 shapes, but it's mostly just a kind of tangled mush. Bits of it escape
 the flow and trickle onto the floor, creating a pungent deathly odour.
 A tiny ladder will take you right into the flow.

 A burnt body shoots through the flow of material in the tube above

 There's no window, so the only light is from a slim fluorescent lamp
 in the ceiling that flickers every so often, periodically plunging you
 into darkness.The floor is littered with dead wasps, but they're not
 you're only company: a man, probably in his early twenties, is in the
 same state, leaning against the opposite wall.

 You're feeling surprisingly tired, so even though you'd rather not be
 off your guard in a situation like this, you can't be bothered to
 worry about it. You fall down onto your side, shut your eyes, and try
 to let the train's steady movement send you off.




 You're walking up the mountain along with all the other dead people,
 heading for judgement at the summit. Grimy fear and sweat-soaked
 resignation are trooping up with you. The dust sweeps around your head
 and blinds you every now and then until you blink. Suddenly, you're at
 the top. There are countless books open on the table. A bony hand is
 holding your book in front of your eyes.

 "NO!" the judge shrieks, and you're thrown forwards, and the book is
 flying with you. As you soar through the air, you can see its pages
 fluttering down over the rocky landscape. You manage to snatch one
 from the air just before you crash into the mountainside and roll over
 and over, and stop yourself before you shoot over into the pit of fire
 below.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Mountainside</span> (as Helen)
 You're looking out upon the enormous pit of fire surrounding the
 mountain. Rocks of various sizes litter the ground, and an acrid dust
 suffuses your senses. It looks like you could probably scramble down
 to the south without much injury. Up above, the judgement continues.

 You hear a noise from up the mountain, and see a colourful glass
 sphere tumbling down towards you. The sphere instantly smashes into a
 million shards, which disappear in the dust.

>get sandwich


 You can't see anything of the sort.

>examine me


 You look at yourself and immediately look away. You don't want to be
 reminded of what an ugly thing you are. You're wearing shitty clothes
 as usual and are taking up too much of the universe's precious space
 with your good-for-nothing body.

 You don't know why, but something's telling you that you want your
 book back. You want to see your life, work out where you went wrong.

 A page from your book, a piece of you. But the words are blurred and
 you can't read them properly. Maybe if you were awake you'd be able to

 over the fire is a small island with a small church on it, and indeed
 no room for anything else. You can reach it by a wooden bridge to the

 <span class="floydstyle i">Church Isle</span> (as Helen)
 A small hexagonal stone church stands here, filling up almost the
 whole surface area of the island. It's somewhat crooked, and seems to
 get thinner and more distant the higher up you look, until the spire
 is like a spindly wire reaching up to the sky. The church is
 surrounded by a spiky wire mesh fence; there might be an opening
 around the back, but you can't tell. You can only walk back across the

 <span class="floydstyle i">Foot of the Mountain: East</span> (as Helen)
 In front of a line of heavy boulders, there's a cage. A cage, large
 enough for you to get into, and indeed with a door hanging invitingly

 up into the sky, disappearing into thick cloud. You can still ignore
 it all and go back to the west, of course.

 No sooner have you stepped into the cage than the door slams shut, and
 you start moving upwards. You look out at the side of the mountain,
 and then the movement gathers pace and before you know it, you've
 passed the summit. You look up through the bars and see the clouds
 getting nearer. Far below, the pit of fire is still bubbling and
 spitting away. You can see the great line of the dead, queuing all the
 way down the mountainside, waiting to be judged at the top, but now
 even the judges and the judging table look small and insignificant.
 Suddenly the vision disappears as you shoot into a cloud. The cage
 keeps on moving up, and you see the clouds changing colour: the first
 ones red and fiery, the next ones gradually cooler, whiter, bluer.
 Then you see people. People looking at you, resting on the clouds and
 looking at you, pointing at you. Angels casting murderous glances at
 you. People laughing.

 Then the cage stops, and you're looking out at a familiar group of
 people, playing cards on this white fluffy cloud. Mark is there.

 <span class="floydstyle i">On the Cloud</span> (in the cage) (as Helen)
 Mark, and a couple of unimportant cronies, are playing cards here,
 here on this cloud. This must be the little place in heaven they've
 been granted for their unshakeable faith. You get the feeling you
 should be guilty, but shameless or not, there's only one thing that
 interests you about the whole scene: the page of your book that's on
 the table.

 You can't reach that from inside the cage.

 "What's that whore even doing here?" says one of Mark's cronies.

 A page from your book, a piece of you. But the words are blurred and
 you can't read them properly.

>examine mark


 Mark is sitting at the table, playing cards with two of his friends.
 He's completely ignoring the page that's right next to him, but
 something also makes you feel that he's guarding it.

 "What's that whore even doing here?" says one of Mark's cronies.

>remember mark


 That's not in the foreground of your memory, if it ever was.

>remember


 You can't seem to do that. Your mind's gone blank.

>talk to mark


 "Mark, look, I'm sorry about what happened. I'm really sorry. But I
 was wondering... could I have that page please?"

 One of Mark's friends snickers. That's all the response you get.

>examine cronies


 Two of Mark's friends are also sat at the table, concentrating hard on
 their game. You think one of them is Chris, and the other one is Paul.
 Or is it Luke? You're not sure. They're all pretty much the same
 anyway.

>talk to cronies


 "Would one of you be able to let me out of here please?"

 "Did you hear something?" says one of Mark's friends.

 "No," he replies. Perhaps if you could somehow prove to Mark that he
 once cared about you... Which you're fairly sure is true, even if it's
 incomprehensible.

 "Mark, that page you've got there... it's useless to you. Let me have

 Nobody answers you, but you notice Mark slowly shaking his head. Maybe
 you could somehow prove to Mark that he once cared for you. He goes in
 for that soppy stuff.

>examine cage


 It's a cage, cube-shaped and made of vertical metal bars. A thick
 cable is tied to the top of it, running all the way up into the clouds
 above. The cage is currently shut.

 They ignore you.

 You have an awful singing voice.

 "Can't we get rid of that horrible thing over there? I swear I'm going
 to puke in a minute."

 "She's insignificant enough just to ignore," says Mark coolly.

 attention of the judges.

>throw stake at mark


 No! You might not be able to get it back.

>show page to mark

 "Hey, look at this!" you call. But he doesn't pay any attention.

 "We've got to be thankful for the Lord's protection," says Mark.
 "There's so much evil around."

 as if you didn't have enough torment.

>examine wasps


 Disgustingly, there are about a hundred dead things on the floor -
 concentrated in the centre of the carriage - bobbing up and down with
 the train's movement in a grotesque dance. They're bigger than wasps,
 and they're red, with menacing needles for stinging. It's a good thing
 they're all dead.

>remember


 Pictures and memories of being a bully are lingering in your head, for
 whatever reason.

>think


 You're not feeling hungry at the moment - not in the slightest - but
 what's going to happen when you are? Will the train stop before that
 happens, and you'll be hauled into a creepy nightmarish abandoned
 mansion in the middle of nowhere, where your screams will echo
 throughout the valleys, startling sheep and assorted wildlife but
 reaching not a single human ear, and you'll be kept barely alive by
 stringy, tasteless sludge that's shoved under the door once a day? Or
 will you be lucky and starve to death?

>talk to man


 You so wish that you could talk. Of course, you have no idea what he's
 like, but he can't be the bad guy around here. Just having somebody to
 talk to would make things so much more bearable.

>get wasp


 Even if your hands weren't incapacitated, you still wouldn't want to
 touch those things.

>get up


 You might be able to stand up, but there's no way you can walk
 anywhere without tripping: your legs are tied together with no fewer
 than three ropes. And even if you could walk, there is nowhere to go.

>examine ropes


 The ropes around you and him are the same and are in the same places -
 two are binding your arms to your sides and three are sticking your
 legs together. They are all excruciatingly tight.

 Suddenly that loud noise comes back, and the red light fills the room
 again. You can't help your pulse raising. But it happens just like
 last time: there are little tubes leading into the wall, and some sort
 of gas is being pumped out of them, but nothing happens. Then they
 shut.

 bricks. A <span class="floydstyle i">girl</span> came up to you, and then she ran off because you

 "You can't join me because you can't count," you said. "You're too

 went and cried in a corner, or maybe she just played with someone

 You don't have too many memories of that place. The building was from

 outdoors. You were first in line to get in, and you just put your head
 down and worked, storming through arithmetic workbooks and leaving
 everyone behind.

 what does this mean? Can you solve this one by induction? Stop being
 silly, Helen, this is bloody serious. It means you've been kidnapped.
 But why would that happen? You can't understand why a kidnapping of
 this magnitude would happen to a nobody like you. You would expect a
 random psychopath to just hack your limbs off and be done with it; if
 somebody is actually keeping you alive, it makes you think they need
 you for something.

 You're looking out of your prison at the little piece of heaven that
 Mark and his friends have been given. They're sat at a small table,

 on the table. If the situation seems hopeless, then you think the
 lever that's poking through the bars of your cage would send you back
 down.

 The card game seems placid, but serious. Mark's hand is unreasonably

 Suddenly the whole scene disappears as the cage shoots down into the
 cloud. It's swaying violently from side to side, shooting down between
 the clouds, barely giving the other residents chance to see you. Soon
 you're looking down at the pit of fire far below you, but before you
 know it the cage has slammed back into the ground and you're back at
 the side of the mountain.

 over the fire is a small island with a small church on it, and indeed
 no room for anything else. There's no way over to it, but there is an
 upright stake lodged in the ground, and a recess next to it where
 another one might go. There are also paths around the base of the

 Looking west you can see an island, floating on the surface of the

 are two more stakes. You can continue around the mountain to the

 the east, and a bridge leads over to its base. There's a crater here,
 with a signpost next to it that has an arrow pointing down.

 There's one of your pages here, glowing faintly.

>get page

 That was the second of your pages. Somehow, you know there are seven.
 There's always seven.

>get sign


 The signpost is lodged firmly in the ground, but you have a feeling
 you don't need it anyway.

 The arrow is pointing straight down.

>examine crater


 There's a crater, with a radius of almost a metre, and there's a
 signpost next to it with an arrow pointing straight down.

>read page


 A page from your book, a piece of you. But the words are blurred and
 you can't read them properly. Maybe if you were awake you'd be able to
 concentrate on it?

>wake


 Suddenly you're awake, and you struggle back into a sitting position,
 but it feels like you've just come from one nightmare to another.
 Images and memories from your dreams are parading through your mind,
 as if you didn't have enough torment.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Carriage</span> (as Helen)
 It's a grey, metal carriage, only slightly longer than it is wide.
 There's no window, so the only light is from a slim fluorescent lamp
 in the ceiling that flickers every so often, periodically plunging you
 into darkness.The floor is littered with dead wasps, but they're not
 you're only company: a man, probably in his early twenties, is in the
 same state, leaning against the opposite wall.

>remember


 Images from your wretched past are swimming around in your mind: the
 holiday in Turkey and being a bully. Most prominent are the memories
 of being a bully.

>remember turkey


 There was that nuclear furnace we call the Sun, and though you knew it
 was the same one, it definitely felt different, beating down on you on
 the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. You felt very dizzy on that walk,
 because of the heat. You'd gone out of your little holiday cottage on
 your own, hadn't told your parents where you were going. Mary was in
 the pool, and you didn't like swimming, so you just left. You walked
 through the town, wandered in and out of shops, tried to talk to
 random locals, who didn't answer you, not even if you said "merhaba"
 or some of the other phrasebook things that you can't remember now.
 You ended up on this beautiful coastal path, looking out at the
 glimmering <span class="floydstyle i">sea</span> and the beautiful <span class="floydstyle i">rocks</span> poking out of it.
 You were fourteen.

>remember sea


 You remember looking down at the sea, and all you could think about
 was what it would be like to jump in. It was a really long way up, and
 you weren't scared. There was no fence on the side of the cliff - it
 would have been so easy to just dive down. You knew you wouldn't do
 it, but you couldn't resist thinking about it.

 Usually you wouldn't want to be asleep when you feel in danger, but
 you've somehow ceased to care. You could do with a nap.

>remember rocks


 You thought about the rocks poking out from the water. You thought
 about your jumping trajectory. You imagined what it would be like to
 fall straight onto the rocks, your blood flowing out to sea.

>remember mary


 That's not in the foreground of your memory, if it ever was.

>remember parents


 That's not in the foreground of your memory, if it ever was.

>remember merhaba


 That's not in the foreground of your memory, if it ever was.

>sleep


 You're feeling surprisingly tired, so even though you'd rather not be
 off your guard in a situation like this, you can't be bothered to
 worry about it. You fall down onto your side, shut your eyes, and try
 to let the train's steady movement send you off.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Coast</span> (as Helen)
 You're on the shores of an island, bigger than the church isle you saw
 earlier, floating in the pit of fire. The great mountain is visible to
 the east, and a bridge leads over to its base. There's a crater here,
 with a signpost next to it that has an arrow pointing down.

>go down


 You step into the crater experimentally, finding the ground to be
 somewhat elastic, almost like fabric. Nothing happens though, so you
 step out.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Foot of the Mountain: West</span> (as Helen)
 Looking west you can see an island, floating on the surface of the
 fiery sea. A wooden bridge leads over to its shores. You can continue
 around the mountain to the north, or go back where you came from to
 the south.

>go north


 You continue walking around the mountain, clambering over fallen rocks
 and picking your way through dead bushes. You look ahead, and stop
 dead in your tracks. In the distance you can see that parade of death
 that you came from: the dead, clambering up the mountainside towards
 judgement. Nobody's seen you, and you'd rather it stay that way. Your
 heart beating fast with terror, you scurry back around to where you
 came from, moving so recklessly that you almost fall into the fire.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Foot of the Mountain: South</span> (as Helen)
 Down here, the pit of fire attacks all your senses at once, your eyes
 with its intense colour, your ears with the sound of its bubbling and
 popping, your skin with its searing heat. Just a short distance away
 over the fire is a small island with a small church on it, and indeed
 no room for anything else. There's no way over to it, but there is an
 upright stake lodged in the ground, and a recess next to it where
 another one might go. There are also paths around the base of the
 mountain to the west and east, and a way back up to the north.

>get stake


 The stake looks as though it would be easy to pull out, but there's
 that other recess right next to it: you'd rather put another in than
 have both recesses empty.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle i">Mountainside</span> (as Helen)

 <span class="floydstyle i">Church Isle</span> (as Helen)
 A small hexagonal stone church stands here, filling up almost the
 whole surface area of the island. It's somewhat crooked, and seems to
 get thinner and more distant the higher up you look, until the spire
 is like a spindly wire reaching up to the sky. The church is
 surrounded by a spiky wire mesh fence; there might be an opening
 around the back, but you can't tell. You can only walk back across the
 bridge to the northwest. Flames are licking up at the church's
 foundations, and you have to be careful that they don't claim you too.

>enter church


 You bump into the fence surrounding the church. Your vision blurs
 momentarily.

 It's a colossal pit of constant flame. You can feel its heat from

 you. You know that it will do so. You belong there.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: Central</span> (as Ross)
 Giant cogs are turning, forming a messy pattern that snakes around the
 room, interspersed with other machines whose function is entirely
 opaque to you. Some are spewing steam, some are making horrid
 squelching noises, some have bright flashing lights. There is a wall
 to the east, and many of the cogs cut right through it. You can go
 back to the west.

>remember


 Remember? Was there a past?

>wake


 You bolt awake. Still in the train carriage, trundling along. You
 manage to push yourself back into a sitting position.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Carriage</span> (as Ross)
 The metal carriage is a deep grey with shadowy corners, and the
 fluorescent lamp on the ceiling is on the blink, so that every so
 often you're sent into total darkness. Your only company is the girl
 opposite you and a sea of dead wasps. You don't know where you're
 going or how you got here.

>examine helen


 The girl is up against the wall directly opposite you, with the same
 tight ropes binding her limbs together, and the gag over her mouth.
 There's a nagging familiarity about her, but no matter how many times
 you cast your eyes over her tangled brown hair, pale face, the
 expensive-looking navy blue jumper or surprisingly intact jeans, you
 cannot work out who she is. She looks to be in her early twenties, and
 generally, you feel she doesn't deserve to be here. Not that anyone
 does.

 She's currently lying on her side, getting some sleep.

>examine me


 It really is as bad as it feels. Your arms and legs are tightly bound;
 you've got no chance of shaking yourself free or even being able to
 move around. And worst of all, you can't even talk to the only other
 person in the room. The gag feels like a permanent attachment.

>remember


 You decide to give it another go. Shutting your eyes tightly, you
 devote all your energy to the task of remembering, and this time the
 memories come in thick and fast, so quickly you can scarcely keep up.
 And that's it. Your sad, sorry life. You're just another idealistic
 idiot who thinks he can make a difference. You've achieved nothing,
 done nothing wrong and nothing right. Your last memory is of racing to
 the Underground and fighting your way through the carriage to stop
 Reth's stupid, stupid plan from working. And you did, didn't you? You
 did it. And that's all you remember. Don't say this is his silly
 messed-up idea of revenge... Reth isn't like that. No, you just don't
 get it.

 Some memories seem particularly clear in your mind now. Usually you
 have no interest in the past, especially your own.

 You're feeling quite sleepy.

>remember reth


 That's not in the foreground of your memory, if it ever was.

>remember


 Various memories are running around your head: the climate change talk
 and the anti-war march.

>remember climate change talk


 The talk was over and you were pretty much exhausted, especially after
 all the long, technical and boring questions that had been asked at
 the end. Various campaign groups had <span class="floydstyle i">stalls</span> in the entrance
 hall area and you quickly lost <span class="floydstyle i">Caroline</span> in the crowd. You'd
 been loitering in the middle of the room for a while, not knowing
 where to go, too jaded to go and read the posters and leaflets that
 had been set out, when a youngish or middle-aged <span class="floydstyle i">woman</span> spotted
 you and started talking to you, for whatever reason.

 There's that clanking sound again. As before, a red light fills the
 room every second, and little vents open on the walls. There's the
 sound of rushing air, a horrid smell, and then they shut.

>remember woman



 You'd never seen her before and you never saw her again. She was
 wearing a shirt and a jacket like a businesswoman but she still seemed
 a bit scruffy. She had short hair and a rucksack over one shoulder.
 Her voice was quite deep, full and stern, but it was so busy in there
 that you doubt anyone else heard what she was saying to you.

 Maybe you could try going to sleep... Maybe when you wake up you'll
 have arrived. Somewhere.

>remember rucksack


 You don't remember everything you talked about, but some of it sticks
 out.

 "I just want to know the answer," you remember saying. "All this talk
 about the problems and about how deeply ingrained they are in our
 society, but what do you do about that?"

 "You should go over there," she said, pointing to the socialist youth
 stall. "Far as I'm concerned, that is the place to start."

>remember stalls


 There were stalls for all kinds of things, from political parties to
 environmental campaign groups to home solar panel installation
 companies.

>remember socialist youth


 You were too tired to look carefully or to speak to them there and
 then, so you just snatched up one of each of the leaflets and fliers.

>remember leaflets

>socialist youth


 You were too tired to look carefully or to speak to them there and
 then, so you just snatched up one of each of the leaflets and fliers.

>remember caroline


 Caroline wasn't in the best of moods that day, and you can hardly go
 to a talk on climate change to unwind. You'd just recently caved in to
 getting a soul-destroying job at a supermarket, just for the money,
 and as soon as her ex-husband heard about it, he stopped sending
 Caroline the money packets that were only just keeping you afloat as
 it was. So, money was as tight as ever, if not more so.

>remember supermarket


 That's not in the foreground of your memory, if it ever was.

>remember march


 The memory has been overtaken a bit by all the other demos you've been
 on since, but the first one always sticks out, of course. The anger on
 the streets was probably more palpable than you've ever felt it. You
 remember loving the <span class="floydstyle i">crowd</span>, being able to voice that anger along
 with so many others. The streets were familiar but transformed. You
 all felt so powerful; you could make a difference; surely they
 couldn't ignore you, the people. Best of all, <span class="floydstyle i">Caroline</span> was
 there all the way, shouting along with you. You loved having a mother
 who felt the same way as you.

 What you learned from it all was: the government can't be trusted.

>remeember crowd

 It's strange that the first march you went on was also the biggest.
 You suppose it was something that tended to cut across political
 differences. You weren't 'political' at 11 years old, after all, so
 you suppose there were plenty of older people who were similarly
 apolitical but just knew injustice when they saw it. The streets were
 simply packed full. You remember catching glimpses of the sidelines;
 the police were always there.

 You're not really sure how it started, but you can scarcely imagine it
 any other way. It's not like she dragged you into this or that you
 dragged her into it: together you saw what was going on around you and
 together you acted. You were sounding boards for each other, trying to
 disentangle the politics. You learnt from each other. Even then, you
 called her Caroline. Her husband - you didn't call him dad, let alone
 Steve - was out of the picture. You didn't talk about him and didn't
 need to.

 You plunge the sickle into the wall, and it cuts itself into the shape
 of an arch, leading west.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: Central</span> (as Ross)
 Giant cogs are turning, forming a messy pattern that snakes around the
 room, interspersed with other machines whose function is entirely
 opaque to you. Some are spewing steam, some are making horrid
 squelching noises, some have bright flashing lights. There is a wall
 to the east, and many of the cogs cut right through it. You can go
 back to the west.

 An archway leads east.

>get sickle


 You feel around the edges of the arch, then peel it away, removing the
 way to the east. You now have a sickle.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: West</span> (as Ross)
 Complicated machinery is everywhere, clunking and scraping and turning
 and chugging away at the task of destroying the planet. At the north
 end of the room is a single stake, standing upright, and just beyond
 it is a gap in the floor, so that you can see through to the void of
 space below. A set of stairs leads up, and the machine room itself
 extends eastward.

>go up


 You climb the stairs, and the stairs themselves fly upwards, so that
 with each footfall you're much higher up. Eventually the staircase
 halts, and you step off onto a platform.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Beneath the Pipe</span> (as Ross)
 You're standing on a small platform, watching severed parts of Earth
 shoot past through the pipe just above you that leads to the beast. By
 this point in their processing, things are barely recognisable as
 belonging to Nature - there are some earthy colours and familiar
 shapes, but it's mostly just a kind of tangled mush. Bits of it escape
 the flow and trickle onto the floor, creating a pungent deathly odour.
 A tiny ladder will take you right into the flow.

 You suddenly see a burst of colour floating past you, and it turns out
 to be a glass sphere drifting up towards the pipe. Presumably
 someone's soul is within. You have no time to save it before it is
 caught by the flow and vanishes down the tube.

>put sickle in pipe


 You stretch your arm out and let the torrent seize the sickle. It
 disappears down the pipe in an instant.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Foot of the Mountain: South</span> (as Helen)
 Down here, the pit of fire attacks all your senses at once, your eyes
 with its intense colour, your ears with the sound of its bubbling and
 popping, your skin with its searing heat. Just a short distance away
 over the fire is a small island with a small church on it, and indeed
 no room for anything else. There's no way over to it, but there is an
 upright stake lodged in the ground, and a recess next to it where
 another one might go. There are also paths around the base of the
 mountain to the west and east, and a way back up to the north.

 You hear a noise from up the mountain, and see a pair of scissors and
 a colourful glass sphere tumbling down towards you. The sphere
 instantly smashes into a million shards, which disappear in the dust.

>get scissors


 You bend down and retrieve the pair of scissors.

 Another body wordlessly accepts its fate, and flies down into the pit
 of fire.

>examine it


 It's a big pair of scissors that came over the mountaintop.

>go south


 If you go that way, you'll fall headlong into the fire. Perhaps it's
 time.

>se


 Time to stop fooling around here. You step to the edge and let the
 flames lick your feet. You get used to the burns, almost enjoy it, and
 then you sway forward and let yourself go. The heat surges inside you,
 an intense pain eating through you, snaking round your blood vessels
 and turning you to death. You still have the sensation of falling, and
 falling, and you think you see something metal. Something big and
 metal, floating in space, consuming the Earth, but that's all you have
 time to notice before you scream your way into oblivion.

 Suddenly you're awake, and you struggle back into a sitting position,
 but it feels like you've just come from one nightmare to another.
 Images and memories from your dreams are parading through your mind,
 as if you didn't have enough torment.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Carriage</span> (as Helen)
 It's a grey, metal carriage, only slightly longer than it is wide.
 There's no window, so the only light is from a slim fluorescent lamp
 in the ceiling that flickers every so often, periodically plunging you
 into darkness.The floor is littered with dead wasps, but they're not
 you're only company: a man, probably in his early twenties, is in the
 same state, leaning against the opposite wall.

>sleep


 You're feeling surprisingly tired, so even though you'd rather not be
 off your guard in a situation like this, you can't be bothered to
 worry about it. You fall down onto your side, shut your eyes, and try
 to let the train's steady movement send you off.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Mountainside</span> (as Helen)
 You're looking out upon the enormous pit of fire surrounding the
 mountain. Rocks of various sizes litter the ground, and an acrid dust
 suffuses your senses. It looks like you could probably scramble down
 to the south without much injury. Up above, the judgement continues.

 There's a loud sucking noise, and a sickle and a metal pole suddenly
 drop out of the flow, strangely intact.

>get all


 metal pole: You expropriate the metal pole.

>go down


 As you climb down the stairs, the entire staircase shoots down,
 landing in the huge machine room you came from.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Machine Room: West</span> (as Ross)
 Complicated machinery is everywhere, clunking and scraping and turning

 (the metal pole in the recess)
 You lodge the stake into the recess, and a bridge shimmers into
 existence, leading north.

>examine bridge


 A simple metal walkway leads north, with bars along it that are bolted
 to two upright stakes at either end.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle i">Over the Gap</span> (as Ross)
 You've crossed the abyss to get over here, and there's just a
 boarded-up door to the north and, slightly more intriguingly, a
 strange device hanging through the ceiling - a column of metal with
 handles at the bottom. You could get back via the bridge to the south.

 A small crystal is here - a part of your soul ready to be taken back.

>get crystal


 (the piece of soul)
 You've found another part of your 'soul'.

>examine door


 The door has been blocked, so thoroughly that there are no gaps
 between the boards.

>open door


 You tug at the boards, but they don't budge.

>examine column


 A strange column of metal is hanging down from the ceiling, a bit like
 a periscope, with handles at the bottom as though you could turn it.
 You imagine it goes up into one of the pipes, but you're not sure what
 effect turning it has.

>turn it


 You get a grip on the handles and try turning the machine in an
 anticlockwise direction. It's stiff, but you put in all your might and
 it finally budges, moving around by a set amount and clicking into a
 new position. The handles are strangely hot, as though the machine is
 connected to a furnace or something.

 That sounds like a waste of time.

 The door has been blocked, so thoroughly that there are no gaps
