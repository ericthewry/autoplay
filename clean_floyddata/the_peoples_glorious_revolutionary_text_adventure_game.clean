 Today is the day you've been waiting for! Today is the day when the
 Revolution arrives to sweep over this entire town, converting it to a
 worker's paradise! Your heart beats with trepidation and excitement
 and you can almost taste victory!
 But victory's not here yet. You still have a lot of work to do. After
 all, it's like Marx said: It's one thing to interpret the world but
 the point is to change it. And today, change will come!

 The People's Glorious Revolutionary Text Adventure Game
 An Interactive Revolution by Taylor Vaughan
 Release 1 / Serial number 100930 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Revolutionary Headquarters
 In future generations, this building may well be a museum, for this is
 where the People's Committee for the Revolution made their glorious
 plans to liberate all who are oppressed! The red light that
 illuminates the room might cause eye strain and make it hard to work,
 but it is truly inspiring.
 You can exit the headquarters to the west (how appropriate!) and a
 staircase leads downwards to the lab.

 A giant workers' flag hangs on the back wall, filling your heart with
 Revolutionary Pride.

 Underneath the flag sits the committee's desk, upon which all
 Revolutionary Managerial Work is accomplished.

>examine me
 You've known since you were 12 that it's fate that you share a name
 with the late, great Karl Marx. You've also been trying to grow out a
 beard like his but so far that hasn't gone very well.

 Your head itches beneath your papakha.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your papakha (being worn)
   a WWTD Bracelet (being worn)

>salute flag
 You salute the workers' flag.

>examine bracelet
 A small bracelet with the words "What Would Trotsky Do?" as a reminder
 to always do the Revolutionary Thing.

>scratch head
 You swore a solemn vow not to remove the papakha from your head until
 the Revolution is achieved!
 Well, on the other hand, your hair is getting really greasy and itchy.
 It probably wouldn't hurt to take your hat off for a minute or two.
 Tucked into the hollow of your papakha is your to-do list. So that's
 where it went!

 You scratch your hair.

>read list
 You look over your to-do list.

>examine flag
 A glorious red flag emblazoned with a yellow hammer and sickle. Just
 looking at it swells your heart with pride and anticipation.

>examine work
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine desk
 A fine wooden desk, carved out of solid wood, no doubt by an oppressed
 worker. Luckily his work was turned to good use when the Committee
 liberated this desk from the basement of a nearby office building
 where it was wasting away as an example of capitalist decadence.

 The desk has a single large drawer. The drawer is closed.

>open it
 You open the drawer, revealing some borscht.

 Guiltily, you quickly put your papakha back on.

>examine borscht
 An bowl of old, rancid borscht. Who knows how long it was in that
 drawer?

>find supplies
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take borscht
 Taken.

>take it
 You already have that.

>eat borscht
 The borscht has really gone bad. There's no way you're going to even
 taste it.

>smell borscht
 It smells terrible.

 A fine wooden desk, carved out of solid wood, no doubt by an oppressed

 Revolutionary Ambiance it provides is worth it.

 People's Laboratory
 This room is filled with all sorts of machines and inventions for the
 betterment of the lives of the proletariat.
 The only exit is up the stairs back to the rest of the Headquarters.

 Comrade Semenov sits at his workbench, hunched over an undoubtedly
 miraculous device.

 You can also see Semenov's workbench (on which are the Marxist
 Ventriloquator Mk II, the Communistic Converter and some sleeping
 serum) here.

>examine semenov
 Comrade Semenov is a diligent worker, his life devoted to science. He
 is currently fiddling intently with the circuit board of his latest
 creation, his eyes hidden behind his impenetrably thick glasses.

>ventrilo
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine mk
 The Ventriloquator is a long plastic tube that widens at one end into
 a curved speaker.

>examine device
 Which do you mean, the Marxist Ventriloquator Mk II, the Communistic
 Converter or the miraculous device?

>miraculous
 The device is currently in many small pieces. That, along with the
 fact that you have little to no knowledge of electronics, means you
 have no idea what it is or what it does.

 The miraculous device is currently switched off.

>turn it on
 You can't turn on the miraculous device while Comrade Semenov is
 holding it.

>examine converter
 The Communistic Converter is a rather small cylinder with some nasty
 looking spikes coming out of one end.

>take it
 Taken.

 "That's the Communistic Converter, Commissar," Semenov says. "It's a
 very powerful piece of technology. Put it on someone and it will
 inject pure Revolutionary Spirit into them, instantly converting them
 to our side. Be very careful with it though, it can only be used
 once."

>ask comrade about miraculous device
 "What's that you're working on now, Comrade Semenov?" you ask.
 "This is going to be the greatest piece of Revolutionary Technology
 known to man, Commissar! It's so exciting I can't find ample words to
 describe it," Semenov jabbers as he pokes at the device with even more
 excitement.

>take ventriloquator
 Taken.

 "The Marxist Ventriloquator mark II is an amazing device," Semenov
 says. "Simply point it at a person or object and he, she or it will be
 forced to shout out a glorious Marxist quote!"

>take serum
 Taken.

 "That's a super-potent (but safe and nonaddictive!) sleeping serum,
 Commissar," Semenov says. "I invented it so that a Revolutionary can
 get the sleep he or she needs in order to function for a full day's
 worth of Revolutionary Work. It tastes pretty bad by itself, though.
 You should probably put it into a food or drink if you want to have
 some."

>point ventriloquator at semenov
 You point the Ventriloquator at Comrade Semenov.
 Comrade Semenov suddenly swells up with Revolutionary Pride and shouts
 "Workers of the world, unite!"
 "I'm trying to work here, Commissar," Semenov frowns.

>point ventriloquator at me
 You point the Ventriloquator at yourself.
 You suddenly swells up with Revolutionary Pride and shouts "Outside of
 a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to
 read!"

>ask comrade about parts
 "What do you need for me to get for you?" you ask.
 Semenov glances at the parts strewn across his workbench. "I think
 that all I need to finish the device is a computer's motherboard,
 Commissar."

>point ventriloquator at flag
 You point the Ventriloquator at the workers' flag.
 The workers' flag suddenly acquires a voice. "I never forget a face,
 but in your case I'll be glad to make an exception!" it shouts.

>ask comrade about motherboard
 "Tell me about the motherboard you need, Comrade Semenov," you say.
 "It's fairly simple," Semenov says, "I just need a regular motherboard
 like you can find in any computer."

>ask comrade about himself
 "How are you doing, Comrade Semenov?" you ask.
 "I'm fine, Commissar," Semenov says. "Right now I'm excited to finish
 this device."

 You can also see Semenov's workbench here.

>examine workbench
 The workbench is cluttered with all manner of half-assembled gizmos,
 assorted electronic parts, tools and incomprehensible blueprints.

>show flag to comrade
 Comrade Semenov doesn't seem interested.

>search workbench
 There is nothing on Semenov's workbench.

>ask comrade about revolution
 "Tell me, Comrade, how do you feel about the Revolution?" you ask.
 Semenov looks at you, smiling. "I'm ready for the Revolution to arrive
 as soon as possible, Commissar. I can't wait for the day when I can
 turn science to peaceful ends for the good of the proletariat."

>get semenov
 I don't suppose Comrade Semenov would care for that.

>ask comrade about proletariat
 Semenov shrugs and silently continues working.

>ask semenov about name
 Semenov shrugs and silently continues working.

>ask comrade about science
 Semenov shrugs and silently continues working.

>ask comrade about me
 "What do you think of me as a Commissar, Comrade Semenov?" you ask.
 Semenov looks up at you seriously. "I think you're quite capable, and
 I'm glad to be working alongside you to bring about the Revolution,"
 he says.

 The committee's desk sits against the back wall, drawer opened.

>go west
 Jetski grins a dopey grin at you.

 Reagan Street
 You are standing on the street outside of the Committee's
 Headquarters, which are to the east. The central park of Freedonia is
 to the north.

 Comrade Jetski is here, reading a comic book.

>examine book
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine comic
 The comic colorfully details the adventures of Captain Freedom as he
 fights the Red Menace. What garbage.

>point ventriloquator at jetski

 Comrade Jetski suddenly swells up with Revolutionary Pride and shouts
 "Workers of the world, unite!"
 Jetski grins stupidly.

>point ventriloquator at comioc
 You can't see any such thing.

>point ventriloquator at comic
 You point the Ventriloquator at the comic.
 The comic suddenly acquires a voice. "Religion is the opium of the
 masses!" it shouts.

>examine jetski
 Jetski may talk like an idiot and look like an idiot, but don't let
 that fool you. He really is an idiot. Luckily he seems to have a
 ridiculous amount of blind luck, avoiding both injury and arrest
 despite how out of his league the missions he usually attempts tend to
 be.

>ask jetski about revolution
 "Comrade Jetski, how do you feel about the Revolution?" you ask.
 Jetski grins a dopey smile at you. "I tell ya, Commissar, I just can't
 wait!"

>take comic
 That seems to belong to Comrade Jetski.

>ask jetski for comic
 "I need to requisition that comic book, Comrade Jetski," you say.
 "But Commissar," Jetski whines, "I'll get bored and fall asleep and
 then I can't guard the HQ! You can have it but first I need something
 else to keep me from getting bored..."

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   some sleeping serum
   the Marxist Ventriloquator Mk II
   the Communistic Converter
   a workers' flag
   some borscht
   a to-do list
   your papakha (being worn)
   a WWTD Bracelet (being worn)

>give borscht to jetski
 "Are you hungry, Comrade Jetski?" you ask. "Would you like this
 borscht I found in the desk drawer?"
 "Oh hey, that's where that went!" Jetski says, slapping himself in the
 forehead. "Sure thing, Commissar, I'm pretty hungry." He grabs the
 borscht and gobbles it down, then lets out a hearty Revolutionary
 Belch. "Wow, that's even better when it's a few days old," he says.
 "I'm full of energy now, no chance of getting bored. Here, you can
 take the comic book I was reading."

>go north

 Freedonia Park
 You are standing in one of the few grassy places in Freedonia. The
 park is visited by a great deal of people daily due to the fact that
 it is in the exact center of the city. Roads lead in all four cardinal
 directions.

 You can see a flagpole (on which is an American flag) here.

 A construction worker walks past and salutes the flag.

>examine flag
 (the workers' flag)
 A glorious red flag emblazoned with a yellow hammer and sickle. Just
 looking at it swells your heart with pride and anticipation.

>examine american flag
 This flag is the hateful symbol of the largest capitalistic nation in
 the world!

>examine pole
 A large metal poll with a rope on it, designed to hoist up a symbol to
 remind those who pass by what they stand for.

 On the flagpole is an American flag.

>pull rope
 You can't see any such thing.

>put workers flag on pole
 You attach the flag to the line and hoist it into the air. A gust of
 wind catches it and it unfurls to its full length, proudly displaying
 the hammer and sickle. A few people nearby gaze at it in wonder, then
 slowly, carefully salute it.

 Looks like you've won the people's hearts!

 A passing mechanic looks up at the red flag and salutes it, grinning
 madly.

 Nixon Avenue
 Just being on this street makes you shiver in disgust. You're standing
 east of the town hall, the central seat of the local capitalist
 government. The city center is to the south.

 A shady-looking peddler leans against an ice cream cart.

>examine peddler
 A shifty-looking independent capitalist. He stands with his hands deep
 in his pockets, slouching and grinning as people walk by.

 "Tootsie Frootsie ice cream!" shouts the peddler.

>examine ice cream
 An old Tootsie-frootsie Ice Cream cart.

 In the ice cream cart are some books.

>examine books
 Buried underneath copies of The Three Little Pigs and other
 pornographic, bourgeoisie trash, you see a copy of The Communist
 Manifesto

>take manifesto
 That seems to belong to the peddler.

>ask peddler about it
 "I think I have a book about it somewhere..." mutters the peddler.

>ask peddler about manifesto
 "Tell me about The Communist Manifesto," you say.
 "I'm sure you know more about it than I do, kid. It's yours for a
 dollar."

 "Get your ice cream!" shouts the peddler.

>buy manifesto
 The peddler laughs at you. "You don't have any money. This is a
 capitalistic society, you know. You have to pay for things! But I tell
 you what," he says, scratching his chin, "I can't see that ever
 getting bought, so I'll trade it for another book if you want."

>point ventriloquator at peddler
 You point the Ventriloquator at the peddler.
 The peddler suddenly swells up with Revolutionary Pride and shouts
 "Religion is the opium of the masses!"

>trade comic for manifesto
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 "Would you like to join the People's Glorious Revolution?" you ask.
 The peddler shakes his head. "No thanks. I'm happy where I am."

 "Fresh cold ice cream!" shouts the peddler.

>read comic
 The comic colorfully details the adventures of Captain Freedom as he
 fights the Red Menace. What garbage.

>give comic to peddler
 "Will this work for a trade?" you ask, offering Jetski's comic to the
 peddler.
 "Is that an original edition of Captain Freedom vs. The Red Menace?"
 he says in shock, his eyes lighting up in greed.
 "Maybe," you say, "What's it worth?"
 "Oh, not much," he says, trying to keep his voice casual, "Really, I'm
 still losing out by giving you the manifesto, but I guess we can make
 that trade."
 He snatches the comic out of your hands and tosses The Communist
 Manifesto at you.
 "So long, sucker," he says, rushing off with his newfound treasure.

>manifesto
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 You have this great work memorized word-for-word. Within can be found

 Town Hall
 Freedonia's town hall bustles with the bureaucratic drones necessary
 to keep capitalism from collapsing under its unsustainable weight.
 There are some offices to the north, a bathroom to the south, and you
 can exit east to get back to the streets.

>go north

 Government Office
 This large office is almost entirely filled with filing cabinets, no
 doubt containing the gathered bureaucratic detritus necessary to run a
 capitalistic government. The main section of the town hall is south.

 A government bureaucrat sits at a desk, contributing to the continuing
 operation of the capitalist system.

 You can also see the bureaucrat's desk (on which are an Inbox (in
 which are some unstamped papers), an Outbox (in which are some stamped
 papers) and a stamp) here.

>take stamp
 The bureaucrat stops you. "Please fill out form T36-B, 'Requisition of
 Government Office Supplies' before taking that."

>ask bureaucrat about form t36-b
 The bureaucrat doesn't even look up. "Please fill out form F2-A,
 'Request for Intercourse with Government Employee' and then I'll talk
 to you."

>point ventriloquator at bureaucrat
 You point the Ventriloquator at the bureaucrat.
 The bureaucrat suddenly swells up with Revolutionary Pride and shouts

 The bureaucrat gets up, takes a form out of a filing cabinet, and
 moves it to an identical filing cabinet.

>hit bureaucrat
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>examine inbox
 In the Inbox are some unstamped papers.

>examine unstamped papers
 A stack of unintelligible forms. There's a large box in the lower
 right corner of each, ostensibly to be stamped by a government
 bureaucrat.

 The bureaucrat wonders aloud about when lunch is, before glancing at
 you balefully and getting back to work.

>examine stamped forms
 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the stamped papers.

>examine stamped papers
 A stack of unintelligible forms. Each has a large box in the lower

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>use converter on worker
 You can't see any such thing.

 The Communistic Converter is a rather small cylinder with some nasty

 The bureaucrat takes a form out of the inbox, looks at it, then
 crumples it up and throws it away.

>touch converter to bureaucrat
 I only understood you as far as wanting to touch the Communistic
 Converter.

>poke bureaucrat with converter
 You stick the Converter on the back of the bureaucrat's neck.
 His eyes suddenly light up with Revolutionary Fervor. "Commissar!" he
 shouts, standing saluting you, "What do you require of me?"
 "Um...I guess you can help me out by taking all these papers and
 destroying them, thereby throwing the capitalist government into
 confusion."
 "Can do, Commissar!" shouts the bureaucrat, and runs out, grabbing the
 papers and stamp on the way.

>use converter on bureaucrat
 You can't see any such thing.

 Government Office
 This large office is almost entirely filled with filing cabinets, no
 doubt containing the gathered bureaucratic detritus necessary to run a
 capitalistic government. The main section of the town hall is south.

 A government bureaucrat sits at a desk, contributing to the continuing
 operation of the capitalist system.

 You can also see the bureaucrat's desk (on which are an Inbox (in
 which are some unstamped papers), an Outbox (in which are some stamped
 papers) and a stamp) here.

 Town Hall
 Freedonia's town hall bustles with the bureaucratic drones necessary
 to keep capitalism from collapsing under its unsustainable weight.
 There are some offices to the north, a bathroom to the south, and you

 A simple bathroom, used by the government employees to refresh

 Just being on this street makes you shiver in disgust. You're standing

 government. The city center is to the south.

 Freedonia Park
 You are standing in one of the few grassy places in Freedonia. The
 park is visited by a great deal of people daily due to the fact that
 it is in the exact center of the city. Roads lead in all four cardinal
 directions.

 You can see a flagpole (on which is a workers' flag) here.

>go west

 You are standing on Goldwater Lane, one of the main streets of the
 city. A small pawn shop to the south is dwarfed by the massive
 corporate edifice that looms to the north. Freedonia Park lies to the
 east.

 Rockefeller Pawn
 This small shop is filled with all sorts of junk and miscellany. It's
 a disgusting testament to the excesses of capitalism.
 You can exit to the north.

 The shopkeeper stands behind the counter, glancing around at all his

>examine edifice
 This office building is the tallest building in town, even bigger than
 the town hall. But that's capitalism for you.

>go north

 Lobby
 You stand in the lobby of a massive office building. The workers here
 embody capitalism to its most extreme -- pointless nonphysical labor
 purely to increase wealth. To the north is a Bronco Coffee franchise.
 Its very presence seems to poison the air with its crass
 commercialism. To the east is an elevator nook and you can exit to the
 south.

>go north

 Bronco Coffee
 The garish, decadent colors and decorations of this institution fill
 you with disgust. Being mid-afternoon, the building is mostly empty,
 but during the morning hours it is filled with the capitalist sheep
 seeking the dastardly psycho-stimulant that enables them to perform
 their meaningless drudge work. A door in the north wall leads back to
 the employee area and you can exit to the south.

 Comrade Chambers lazes behind the counter, bored.

>examine chambers
 Comrade Chambers is your inside man. He's made the ultimate sacrifice
 -- exposing himself to the horrors of capitalistic work in order to
 help destroy the system from the inside.

>ask chambers about revolution
 "Tell me your thoughts about the Revolution, Comrade Chambers," you
 say.
 Chambers straightens up excitedly. "It can't come soon enough, Karl.
 I'm sick and tired of this mind-numbing capitalist job, and totally
 ready for the worker's paradise!"

>ask chambers for coffee
 (Comrade Chambers first taking coffee)
 "I'm working right now, Karl," Chambers says.

>examine coffee
 You can't actually see the coffee here. It's probably in the backroom.

>go north

 Backroom
 This is the backroom of Bronco Coffee. Amidst the miscellaneous boxes
 and packages, A small couch sits in the corner, on which employees are
 allowed to sit during their pathetically short breaks.
 You can exit to the south.

 A large vat sits in the corner, slowly percolating the coffee for the
 entire coffeehouse.

 You can also see a greasy rag and some donuts here.

>examine vat
 This single vat brews the coffee for the customers. Look at this
 uncaring capitalism -- no custom-brewed drinks just for you, instead
 one draws all ones daily sustenance from the same murky puddle that's
 been sitting around all day.

>take va
 You can't see any such thing.

>take vat
 That's fixed in place.

 From the front, you hear someone order a drink. The vat gurgles,

 discerning customer.

>dip donuts in vat

>put serum in coffee
 You pour a significant amount of the serum into the vat. It's quickly
 mixed into the coffee.

 From the front, you hear someone order a drink. The vat gurgles,
 pumping the coffee through a large pipe to deliver it to the
 discerning customer. A few minutes pass, then the customer starts
 shouting.
 "This coffee is only making me more tired, not awake! I didn't order
 decaf! You can be sure I'll tell everyone I know not to come here."

 Well, looks like you ruined the reputation of a major capitalist
 chain.

 Rand's Liquors is the main provider of alcoholic beverages in
 Freedonia.
 You can exit to the north.

 Thousands of varieties of bottles of every color imaginable sit upon
 the shelves.

 The clerk leans on the counter, bored.

 The clerk looks absolutely bored and miserable. A sad victim of the
 meaningless capitalistic "service economy"!

 "Would you like to join the People's Glorious Revolution?" you ask.
 "Revolution?" the clerk looks at you, confused. "Isn't that the new
 dance club they're opening this fall?"

>give manifesto to clerk
 The liquor store clerk doesn't seem interested.

>tell clerk about revolution
 "The Revolution is going to be wonderful," you explain. "There will be
 no more bosses, no more unjust wages, everyone will work for
 themselves!"
 "Sounds great," agrees the clerk. "Lemme know when it happens and I'll
 be the first one there."

>examine bottles
 The many bottles of alcohol smile benevolently at you from the
 shelves.
 A particular bottle of Russian vodka catches your interest.

 In the shelves is a bottle of vodka.

 Russian wodka, fuel of the Revolution!

 brainwashing facility in Freedonia. The main thoroughfare of the

 and to the east lies a dusty, forgotten corridor. To the south, you
 can exit back to (relative) sanity.

>go east

 School Hallway
 Judging by the layer of dust on the floor of this hallway, it is
 mostly unused. Which is odd, considering the fact that you can hear a
 monotone voice droning steadily through the door to the north, marked
 "Economics." There is also a small closet to the south. To the west
 lies the main hall.

>go south

 Supply Closet
 This cramped closet is entirely empty except for Comrade Rosalia and a
 large cardboard box.
 You can exit to the north.

 Comrade Rosalia is looking through a box filled with copies of The
 Communist Manifesto.

>examine rosalia
 Comrade Rosalia's harsh features and fierce eyes help to emphasize the
 burning passion she feels for the Revolution. All people are equal, of
 course, but you can't help but feel that Rosalia is the only comrade
 of yours who is actually your equal in both intelligence and activism.

>ask rosalia about revolution
 "Tell me your thoughts about the Revolution, Comrade Rosalia," you
 say.
 Rosalia looks at you, positively glowing. "Commissar, I can't help but
 feel that victory is close at hand! I can barely stand the wait."

>ask rosalia about manifesto
 "What's your status with the books?" you ask Rosalia.
 "Well, Commissar, right now I'm trying to slip copies of The Communist
 Manifesto to those poor students being brainwashed by capitalistic
 propaganda in the classroom just outside this closet."
 "Wonderful!" you exclaim. "How's it going?"
 "Well, Commissar," Rosalia frowns thoughtfully, "Turns out I'm one
 book short. It just wouldn't be right to give all but one of the
 students copies. That's not equal at all!"

>give book to rosalia
 Rosalia's eyes light up. "Thanks, Commissar! This is perfect!"
 She puts it reverently in the box with the others, then takes the box
 outside. A few seconds pass by, then she comes back in looking
 dejected.
 "Well, Commissar, I gave them the books. But they're all too apathetic
 to read them!" She shakes her head. "What a terrible society, churning
 out students too filled with ennui to even glance at Marx's grand
 ideas."

>go north

 School Hallway
 Judging by the layer of dust on the floor of this hallway, it is

 Economics Classroom
 This classroom is one of the most depressing (and grey) places you've
 ever seen. The dilapidated desks and out-of date facilities look more
 than ten years older than the students using them. Dust and cobwebs
 have settled on every available surface, including in some cases its
 human inhabitants.
 The exit is south.

 An elderly teacher stands in front of his bored students, droning on
 about nothing in particular.

 You can also see some students here.

>examine students
 The students slump in their seats, bored. Some of them are asleep,
 small puddles of drool pooling on their desks. They each have a copy
 of The Communist Manifesto on their desk, but none of them seem to
 have noticed it.

>point ventriloquator at teacher
 You point the Ventriloquator at the teacher.
 The teacher suddenly swells up with Revolutionary Pride and shouts
 "Capital is dead labor!"
 The students wake up when they hear the Revolutionary Message. Looking
 down at their desks they notice the copies of The Communist Manifesto.
 They quickly read it, then look at each other with Revolutionary
 Fervor and run out the door.

 Looks like you've won the minds of the people!

 J. Edgar Hoover High School
 The J. Edgar Hoover High School is the premier capitalist youth
 brainwashing facility in Freedonia. The main thoroughfare of the
 school stretches to the north. To the west you see the school offices,
 and to the east lies a dusty, forgotten corridor. To the south, you
 can exit back to (relative) sanity.

>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

 McCarthy Boulevard stretches through Freedonia. To the north is J.
 Edgar Hoover High School and directly across the street to the south
 is Rand's Liquors. The city center is to the west.

>go west

 Freedonia Park
 You are standing in one of the few grassy places in Freedonia. The
 park is visited by a great deal of people daily due to the fact that
 it is in the exact center of the city. Roads lead in all four cardinal
 directions.

 You can see a flagpole (on which is a workers' flag) here.

>go west

 Goldwater Lane
 You are standing on Goldwater Lane, one of the main streets of the

 Just being on this street makes you shiver in disgust. You're standing

 government. The city center is to the south.

>go north

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go west

 Town Hall
 Freedonia's town hall bustles with the bureaucratic drones necessary
 to keep capitalism from collapsing under its unsustainable weight.
 There are some offices to the north, a bathroom to the south, and you
 can exit east to get back to the streets.

>go north

 Government Office
 This large office is almost entirely filled with filing cabinets, no
 doubt containing the gathered bureaucratic detritus necessary to run a
 capitalistic government. The main section of the town hall is south.

 A government bureaucrat sits at a desk, contributing to the continuing
 operation of the capitalist system.

 You can also see the bureaucrat's desk (on which are an Inbox (in
 which are some unstamped papers), an Outbox (in which are some stamped
 papers) and a stamp) here.

>put sign on desk
 You can't see any such thing.

>put card on desk
 You put the "Out to Lunch" card on the desk.
 "Lunch time already?" yawns the bureaucrat, getting up and leaving.
 For some reason, he takes his stamp with him. That's kind of weird.

>take all from inbox
 The capitalists will be waiting for these forms to be approved for
 quite a long time, causing their work to grind to a halt!

>take all from outbox
 The capitalists will have a hard time getting things done with all
 these approved forms missing.

 You think you've caused enough chaos in the town hall to disrupt the
 government, at least for awhile.

 Comrade Jetski is here, smiling vacantly at you.

 Revolutionary Headquarters
 In future generations, this building may well be a museum, for this is
 where the People's Committee for the Revolution made their glorious
 plans to liberate all who are oppressed! The red light that
 illuminates the room might cause eye strain and make it hard to work,
 but it is truly inspiring.
 You can exit the headquarters to the west and a staircase leads
 downwards to the lab.

 The committee's desk sits against the back wall, drawer opened.

>go down

 People's Laboratory
 This room is filled with all sorts of machines and inventions for the
 betterment of the lives of the proletariat.
 The only exit is up the stairs back to the rest of the Headquarters.

 Comrade Semenov sits at his workbench, hunched over an undoubtedly
 miraculous device.

 You can also see Semenov's workbench here.

>give mobo to semenov
 You can't see any such thing.

>give motherboard to semenov
 You offer the motherboard to Semenov. "Is this what you need?"
 He grabs it excitedly. "This is exactly it, Commissar! Now I'll be
 able to finish the device. Oh Commissar, this is wonderful!"

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 The device is currently in many small pieces. That, along with the

 You can't turn on the miraculous device while Comrade Semenov is

 That seems to belong to Comrade Semenov.

 Lobby
 You stand in the lobby of a massive office building. The workers here
 embody capitalism to its most extreme -- pointless nonphysical labor
 purely to increase wealth. To the north is a Bronco Coffee franchise.
 Its very presence seems to poison the air with its crass
 commercialism. To the east is an elevator nook and you can exit to the

>go east

 Elevator Nook
 This is a small elevator nook. They've installed a security card
 system since you were last here.
 Considering that the last time you were here you stole a desk from the
 basement, that isn't very surprising.
 Since the elevators are apparently inaccessible, your only exit is to
 the west.

 The garish, decadent colors and decorations of this institution fill

 but during the morning hours it is filled with the capitalist sheep
 seeking the dastardly psycho-stimulant that enables them to perform
 their meaningless drudge work. A door in the north wall leads back to

>take vodka
 You grab the vodka. The perfect thing for a Communist Party!

 You hear a loud commotion coming from the direction of Freedonia Park.

 Ah, vodka liberated from the capitalists!
>get vodka

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 You already have that.

>go north

 J. Edgar Hoover High School
 The J. Edgar Hoover High School is the premier capitalist youth
 brainwashing facility in Freedonia. The main thoroughfare of the
 school stretches to the north. To the west you see the school offices,
 and to the east lies a dusty, forgotten corridor. To the south, you
 can exit back to (relative) sanity.

>go south

 McCarthy Boulevard
 McCarthy Boulevard stretches through Freedonia. To the north is J.
 Edgar Hoover High School and directly across the street to the south
 is Rand's Liquors. The city center is to the west.

 Guiltily, you quickly put your papakha back on.

>go west

 Freedonia Park
 You are standing in one of the few grassy places in Freedonia. The
 park is visited by a great deal of people daily due to the fact that
 it is in the exact center of the city. Roads lead in all four cardinal
 directions.

 A growing crowd sings Revolutionary Anthems and celebrates the coming
 Revolution.

 You can also see a flagpole (on which is a workers' flag) here.

 You are astounded at the huge crowd that has gathered in the park.
 They stand in a circle around the flag, celebrating and singing
 glorious inspirational Revolutionary Songs. Your heart swells with
 joy. Is this it? Has the Revolution truly begun?
>space
 Your happiness deflates immediately, however, as Rosalia runs up to
 you, panic in her eyes.
 "Commissar!" she shouts, "Come quick! Something terrible's happened!
 The HQ has been attacked by reactionary scum!"
 The very word chills you to your core. Reactionaries. In your sanctum.
 Impossible.
 Rosalia heads towards the HQ, leaving you in shock.

>go south

 Reagan Street
 You are standing on the street outside of the Committee's
 Headquarters, which are to the east. The central park of Freedonia is
 to the north.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>go east

 Revolutionary Headquarters
 The room has been trashed! The desk has been overturned and papers are
 scattered everywhere. A giant green dollar sign has been spray painted
 on the wall.

 The committee's desk lies flung against the wall, overturned, drawer
 opened.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>Dollar sign!
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go down
 You almost run into Rosalia as you enter. She's standing at the bottom
 of the stairs in utter shock, and you can see why. The destruction
 upstairs is nothing compared to here. The laboratory is barely
 recognizable anymore. All the instruments and documents of technology
 and progress have been destroyed and scattered. From a nearby pile of
 junk, you hear a groan. You and Rosalia rush over and quickly clear
 away the trash, revealing the battered form of Comrade Semenov.
  "Commissar..." he groans, "It was Chambers! He...he sold us out to
 the capitalists."
  "That bastard!" you shout, clenching your fist, "We've got to..."
  "C-Commissar!" Semenov coughs, "It's worse than that! They...they
 took my device! I had just f-finished it, and now...without it, I...I
 don't know...if the Revolution is possible." Semenov sighs and closes
 his eyes.
  "Don't worry about that, Semenov," you say softly, as you stand up.
 "I'll get it back. Comrade Rosalia, you stay here and take care of
 Semenov. I'm going to track down 'Comrade' Chambers, and teach him
 that those who make peaceful Revolution impossible, MAKE VIOLENT
 REVOLUTION INEVITABLE!"
>space

 People's Laboratory
 The laboratory is completely trashed! Semenov's tools and plans are
 scattered all over the room in complete disarray. From the looks of
 it, it seems the reactionaries also destroyed several of his devices.
 The only exit is up the stairs back to the rest of the Headquarters.

 Comrade Rosalia is crouching next to Semenov, cleaning his wounds.

 Semenov lies amidst the junk, unconscious.

 You can also see Semenov's workbench here.

>ask rosalia about revolution
 "Tell me your thoughts about the Revolution, Comrade Rosalia," you
 say.
 Rosalia looks at you, worried. "Commissar, I can't help but feel that
 victory is uncertain, now."

>ask semenov about revolution
 Semenov is unconscious.

>search semenov
 "That's not very polite, Commissar," Rosalia says reproachfully.

>search junk
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine junk
 You can't make head or tail of any of the devices, parts or plans
 filling the lab, but you have no doubt that they would have been a
 great help to the Revolution, had they not been destroyed.

>put rag in vodka
 You stick the greasy rag into the wodka bottle, creating a molotov
 cocktail.

>ask rosalia about lighter
 "I don't know anything about that, Commissar," Rosalia says, shaking
 her head.

>ask rosalia about matches
 "I don't know anything about that, Commissar," Rosalia says, shaking
 her head.

>go up
 As you reach the top of the stairs, you are almost knocked off your
 feet by Comrade Jetski.
  "Commissar! Commissar! I'm so sorry! I couldn't take them all, they
 picked me up and threw me in a dumpster!"
  "Don't worry about it, Jetski," you say, shaking your head. "Against
 the crushing force of capitalism, what can one man do?"
  "That's just it, Commissar! I did do something! I followed 'em back
 to their home base! They went way up north past the Town Hall, and
 went into this big mansion! But there were two guards at the door so I
 didn't try to go in just in case I got caught. I thought it was more
 important that I told you first."
  "You thought right, Jetski," you say. "Stay here and help Rosalia
 take care of Semenov. I'll take a look at this mansion."

 Revolutionary Headquarters
 The room has been trashed! The desk has been overturned and papers are

 a large mansion is north.

>go north

 Mansion Gates
 You stand before the gates of an enormous mansion. Many would find the
 dark colors, stark architecture and enormous size intimidating, but
 you just find it a disgusting testament to inequality.
 The mansion is to the north, and you can return to the city to the
 south.

 A pair of jackbooted reactionary thugs guard the gates.

 One guard turns to the other. "What're we supposed to watch out for
 again?"
 "Revolutionaries, idiot," says the other, rolling his eyes.
 "What's that?" asks the first one.
 "Obviously they're a kind of political group dedicated to the
 overthrow of the government and establishment of a communist state,"
 sighs the second guard.

>examine guards
 A pair of muscly, brainwashed (and braindead) reactionary enforcers,
 the use of their force no doubt purchased by the owner of this
 mansion, and likely for a sum that would embarrass them if they had
 any sense of pride.

 One of the thugs yawns.

 "Obviously they're a kind of monster," sighs the second guard.

>ask thugs about revolution
 You don't want to draw attention to yourself.

 One of the thugs scratches himself.

>examine mansion
 An enormous gothic mansion, taunting you with its decadence and
 grandiosity.

 One guard turns to the other. "What're we supposed to watch out for
 again?"
 "Revolutionaries, idiot," says the other, rolling his eyes.
 "What's that?" asks the first one.
 "Obviously they're a kind of political group dedicated to the

 sighs the second guard.

>point mk ii at guard
 You point the Ventriloquator at one of the guards. He swells up with
 Revolutionary Pride and shouts "Last night I shot an elephant in my
 pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I'll never know!"
 "What'd you just say?" snaps the other thug.
  "I didn't say nothin'," says your target, "But what was that crap you
 were just spoutin'? Didn't sound very loyal to the good old US of A!"
  "Oh don't you try to blame your treason on me," shouts the other
 guard, lunging at the speaker. Soon the guards are tangled in a
 massive fight and are completely ignoring the gate.

 One of the guards punches the other in the eye.

>go north

 Foyer
 An enormous, grand foyer. Marble floor, chandelier, the works. It's
 strangely empty and quiet, so much so that it would make you feel very
 small, if you weren't so full of Revolutionary Spirit.
 A door leads to the north and you can exit to the south.

>get all
 There are none at all available!

>go north
 As you step forward into the mansion, the chandelier in the ceiling
 suddenly comes loose and crashes down on you. This is it. Your
 Revolution ends here. But at least your death can serve as a metaphor:
 crushed to death by capitalism, just as it crushes the spirits of
 the...
 "Oh, please, stop being so melodramatic, Karl," laughs a familiar
 voice. Chambers steps into your field of vision, wearing a three-piece
 suit and smoking a cigar.
 "Chambers! Why'd you do it?" you cry in anguish.
  "That's Mr. Whittaker Chambers, Esquire to you, comrade. And can't
 you see? It's obvious!" he waves his hand grandly, indicating his
 foyer and mansion. "It's because of capitalism that I was able to buy
 and own all this."
  "You were able to buy this with the money you made working at Bronco
 Coffee? That doesn't even make sense," you say.
  "Of course it doesn't make sense to you, Karl," Chambers laughs, "But
 any capitalist knows that pure hard work and dedication can take
 anyone from utter poverty to outstanding wealth, and anyone who
 doesn't make it is just too lazy. But I'm wasting time," he sighs. "I
 need to get back to my workshop and figure out what Semenov's device
 was supposed to do. If I'm right, I think he might have just
 inadvertently given me the means to wipe out communism once and for
 all." He smirks. "Take him away, boys, you know where."

 The guards drag you out of the chandelier's wreckage and take you
 through the mansion to a large vault door. One whispers a password to
 the voice scanner on the door. The door opens and the guards toss you
 unceremoniously in.

 Vault
 This is Chambers' giant vault. In the center is a large pit filled to
 the brim with money. The vault extends to the north, and a massive
 vault door stands to the east.

 A diving board is bolted over the edge of the pit.

>swim
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>get money
 You wouldn't dare dirty your hands with such capitalist filth.

>burn money
 This dangerous act would achieve little.

>examine board
 A regular diving board, like you might find at any swimming pool.

>search money
 You find nothing of interest.

>dive
 You must supply a noun.

>swim
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>dive into money
 That might be more fun from the diving board.

>get on board
 You get onto the diving board.

>get on board
 But you're already on the diving board.

>dive into money
 You plug your nose (to cover up the stench of the currency you're
 about to dive into, of course) and leap into the pool. You sink
 through the money and fall right into a drain! Crawling through the
 pipes, you soon emerge near the mansion.

 Mansion Gates
 You stand before the gates of an enormous mansion. Many would find the
 dark colors, stark architecture and enormous size intimidating, but
 you just find it a disgusting testament to inequality.
 The mansion is to the north, and you can return to the city to the
 south.

 Two reactionaries are lying here unconscious, apparently having
 knocked each other out.

>go north

 Foyer
 An enormous, grand foyer. Millions of tiny pieces of glass lie
 scattered across the marble floor around a wrecked chandelier.
 A door leads to the north and you can exit to the south.

>examine chandelier
 The chandelier lies shattered on the floor, having fallen from the
 ceiling.

>take glass
 You'd cut your hands.

>go north

 Hallway
 This grand hallway stretches north to south, lined with various pieces
 of expensive-looking and exploitative artwork. You can hear Chambers'
 voice coming from the east. To the west is a vault door, and the
 mansion stretches to the north.

>listen to door
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>listen to chambers
 You can't see any such thing.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>go north
 You have no reason to go to that part of the mansion.

>go west
 (first opening the vault door)
 The vault door is sealed tight and locked with a biometric scanner
 requiring a voice print. These capitalists take the security of their
 money seriously.

>whisper swordfish
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>say swordfish
 (to yourself)
 There is no reply.

>say swordfish to scanner
 You can only do that to something animate.

>point ventriloquator at scanner
 You point the Ventriloquator at the biometric scanner.
 The biometric scanner suddenly acquires a voice. "Workers of the
 world, unite!" it shouts.

 You look through the guards' pockets and find a twenty-dollar bill.
 Well, that would have been useful about half an hour ago.

>search reactionaries
 You don't find anything else.

>examine bill
 A green (how appropriate) piece of paper with a dead capitalist on it.

 You are carrying:
   a twenty dollar bill

   some stamped papers
   some unstamped papers
   some donuts

 Study
 You can't help but feel enveloped in the sense of decadent comfort
 this study is meant to provide. Plump furniture sits scattered
 haphazardly around the room, surrounded by large bookshelves filled
 with rare tomes. If only your Revolutionary Will wasn't so strong, you
 think you might begin to see Chambers' point.
 You can exit the study to the west.

 Chambers huddles over his desk, examining Semenov's miraculous device.

>examine desk
 Chambers' desk is almost as nice as the desk you liberated for the
 committee's desk.

>examine ashtray
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cigar
 You can't see any such thing.

>hit chambers
 You sneak up behind Chambers and hit him in the back of the head.
 He spins around, startled. "Useless brainless fools..." he mutters,
 then shouts "Guards! Intruder!"
 Quickly, you find yourself thrown back into the vault.

 Vault
 This is Chambers' giant vault. In the center is a large pit filled to
 the brim with money. The vault extends to the north, and a massive

 You can't turn on the miraculous device while Comrade Chambers is

>put converter on chambers
 You stick the Converter on the back of Chambers' neck. His eyes go
 wide and his mouth opens in shock. Slowly he slumps, then turns to
 you.
 "Commissar..." he says, haltingly, "What...do you require of me?"
 "The device, Comrade Chambers," you say, sternly.
 Chambers looks at the device, then at you. "Of...of course,
 Commissar," he says, handing it to you. "If you'll excuse me, I'd like
 to lie down."
 "Of course, Chambers," you say sadly, "It's been a long day for you."
 Your gaze strays to the device in your hand.

 Government Office
 This large office is almost entirely filled with filing cabinets, no

 Thousands of varieties of bottles of every color imaginable sit upon

 purely to increase wealth. To the north is a Bronco Coffee franchise.
 Its very presence seems to poison the air with its crass
 commercialism. To the east is an elevator nook and you can exit to the

 Bronco Coffee
 The garish, decadent colors and decorations of this institution fill
 you with disgust. Being mid-afternoon, the building is mostly empty,

 their meaningless drudge work. A door in the north wall leads back to

 embody capitalism to its most extreme -- pointless nonphysical labor
 purely to increase wealth. To the north is a Bronco Coffee franchise.
 Its very presence seems to poison the air with its crass
 commercialism. To the east is an elevator nook and you can exit to the
 south.

>go north

 Bronco Coffee
 The garish, decadent colors and decorations of this institution fill
 you with disgust. Being mid-afternoon, the building is mostly empty,
 but during the morning hours it is filled with the capitalist sheep
 seeking the dastardly psycho-stimulant that enables them to perform
 their meaningless drudge work. A door in the north wall leads back to
 the employee area and you can exit to the south.

>go north

 Backroom
 This is the backroom of Bronco Coffee. Amidst the miscellaneous boxes
 and packages, A small couch sits in the corner, on which employees are
 allowed to sit during their pathetically short breaks.
 You can exit to the south.

 A large vat sits in the corner, slowly percolating the coffee for the
 entire coffeehouse.

>take coffee
 That's fixed in place.

>pour coffee
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine vat
 This single vat brews the coffee for the customers. Look at this
 uncaring capitalism -- no custom-brewed drinks just for you, instead
 one draws all ones daily sustenance from the same murky puddle that's
 been sitting around all day.

>draw coffee
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>turn on vat
 That's not something you can switch.

 Elevator Nook
 This is a small elevator nook. They've installed a security card
 system since you were last here.
 Considering that the last time you were here you stole a desk from the
 basement, that isn't very surprising.
 Since the elevators are apparently inaccessible, your only exit is to
 the west.

>poke system with converter
 You can only do that to something animate.

>pour serum on card system
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 That can't contain things.

 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

 Goldwater Lane
 You are standing on Goldwater Lane, one of the main streets of the
 city. A small pawn shop to the south is dwarfed by the massive
 corporate edifice that looms to the north. Freedonia Park lies to the
 east.

>go east

 Freedonia Park
 You are standing in one of the few grassy places in Freedonia. The
 park is visited by a great deal of people daily due to the fact that
 it is in the exact center of the city. Roads lead in all four cardinal
 directions.

 A growing crowd sings Revolutionary Anthems and celebrates the coming
 Revolution, unaware of how delicately it hangs in the balance.

 You can also see a flagpole (on which is a workers' flag) here.

>point mk ii at crowd
 You point the Ventriloquator at the crowd.
 The crowd suddenly swells up with Revolutionary Pride and shouts "I
 never forget a face, but in your case I'll be glad to make an
 exception!"

 A passing fast food worker looks up at the red flag and salutes it,
 grinning madly.

 Rockefeller Pawn
 This small shop is filled with all sorts of junk and miscellany. It's

 You can exit to the north.

 The shopkeeper stands behind the counter, glancing around at all his
 stuff.

>junk
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>buy junk
 Contributing to capitalism, are we?

>show cocktail to shopkeeper
 The shopkeeper looks at the molotov cocktail, and shakes his head
 sadly.

 Nixon Avenue
 Just being on this street makes you shiver in disgust. You're standing
 east of the town hall, the central seat of the local capitalist
 government. The city center is to the south, and according to Jetski,
 a large mansion is north.

>examine ice cream
 An old Tootsie-frootsie Ice Cream cart.

 In the ice cream cart are some books.

>examine books
 Any inspiring reading material that may be in there is buried
 underneath copies of The Three Little Pigs and other pornographic,
 bourgeoisie trash.

>examine pigs
 A despicable "children's" book espousing the benefits of living in
 wealth while your brother lives in poverty.

>go north

 Mansion Gates
 You stand before the gates of an enormous mansion. Many would find the
 dark colors, stark architecture and enormous size intimidating, but
 you just find it a disgusting testament to inequality.
 The mansion is to the north, and you can return to the city to the
 south.

 Two reactionaries are lying here unconscious, apparently having
 knocked each other out.

>go north

 Foyer
 An enormous, grand foyer. Millions of tiny pieces of glass lie
 scattered across the marble floor around a wrecked chandelier.
 A door leads to the north and you can exit to the south.

>go north

 Hallway
 This grand hallway stretches north to south, lined with various pieces
 of expensive-looking and exploitative artwork. You can hear Chambers'
 voice coming from the east. To the west is a vault door, and the
 mansion stretches to the north.

>go east

 Study
 You can't help but feel enveloped in the sense of decadent comfort
 this study is meant to provide. Plump furniture sits scattered
 haphazardly around the room, surrounded by large bookshelves filled
 with rare tomes. If only your Revolutionary Will wasn't so strong, you
 think you might begin to see Chambers' point.
 You can exit the study to the west.

 Chambers huddles over his desk, examining Semenov's miraculous device.

>hit chambers
 You sneak up behind Chambers and hit him in the back of the head.
 He spins around, startled. "Useless brainless fools..." he mutters,
 then shouts "Guards! Intruder!"
 Quickly, you find yourself thrown back into the vault.

 Vault
 This is Chambers' giant vault. In the center is a large pit filled to
 the brim with money. The vault extends to the north, and a massive
 vault door stands to the east.

 A diving board is bolted over the edge of the pit.

>go north

 Northern Vault Section
 This wing of the vault contains various riches and luxuries that
 Chambers has apparently collected. The main vault is to the south.

 A gold statuette of Chambers stands out among the junk.

>examine statuette
 A small gold statue of Chambers, depicting him in a top hat and
 monocle.

>examine monocle
 You can't see any such thing.

 Your pride and joy, this furry hat stands atop your head as a proud
 testament to your commitment to the Revolution!

 hundred-dollar bills.

>stand on board
 You get onto the diving board.

>dive into money
 You plug your nose (to cover up the stench of the currency you're
 about to dive into, of course) and leap into the pool. You sink
 through the money and fall right into a drain! Crawling through the
 pipes, you soon emerge near the mansion.

 Chambers huddles over his desk, examining Semenov's miraculous device.

>hit chambers with statuette
 You raise the statuette high above you and slam it against the back of
 Chambers' head. He collapses like a sack of pickled herring, leaving
 the miraculous device yours for the taking.

 Wow, that was almost too easy. Not that you're complaining.

>take device
 (the miraculous device)
 Taken.

>search chambers
 You look through Chambers' pockets and find a Bronco Coffee Employee
 Discount Card, which you take.

>again
 You don't find anything else.

>push button
 You press the button. At first, nothing happens, and you feel deflated
 at having to have gone through all that for nothing. Soon, though, you
 realize that you can hear cheering and shouting coming from the
 direction of the city.

>go east
 You walk back into Revolutionary Headquarters and are astounded to see
 that it's back in pristine condition! Jetski and Rosalia support a
 weakly grinning Semenov as many members of the proletariat look on in
 joy.
 "You did it, Commissar!" Semenov says.
 "No," you say, pausing for dramatic effect, "We did it, Comrade." The
 onlookers erupt into applause, despite the utter cheesiness.
 "Now it's time for a Communist party!" shouts Jetski.
 You grin sheepishly. "About that...I used the wodka to make a molotov
 cocktail when I was attacking Chambers' mansion, so I'm afraid..."
 "No problem, Commissar!" says the liquor store clerk, stepping forward
 with a cartful of wodka bottles.
 At the end of the party, you are unanimously (and drunkenly) chosen to
 head the Committee in Charge of the Enlightened Guidance of Freedonia,
 the Worker's Paradise.
