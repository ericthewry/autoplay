 Glorious day, comrade!  Of all the countless applicants, you yourself
 have been chosen to represent the great government of the Motherland
 as the political officer -- the zampolit -- in the crown jewel of the
 People's accomplishments: the lunar base.  With months of training
 complete, you are finally ready to assume your post.

 <span class="floydstyle header">Comrade</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by Roger Carbol
 Release 1 / Serial number 150506 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shuttle</span>
 The inside of this reusable space vehicle is cramped, but not
 unbearably so for the trip up from Earth.  A ramp has opened up,
 leading out into the base.

 You can see DUFFY, apparently with some message on its screen, here.

>examine duffy

 This large immobile robot is known as DUFFY, which is an acronym
 for... something you can never quite remember.  The "U" is for Unit,
 maybe?  Anyway, its primary purpose is to analyze various substances
 and objects.  It displays any relevant output from its analysis on a
 large integral screen.

>read screen

 It reads:

 MESSAGE FROM COMMAND -- MAY 2 0759 -- COMRADE -- ZAMPOLIT REPORTED
 DECEASED BY SUICIDE.  INVESTIGATE PRIOR TO SHUTTLE DEPARTURE AT 2000.
 MAKE ARREST IF POSSIBLE.  END MESSAGE.


 You are carrying nothing.

>examine me

 You are now this lunar base's zampolit, charged with keeping everyone
 in line with the approved ideology of the Motherland.  It is a duty
 you take seriously.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dock</span>
 Small as far as hangars go, but large enough to contain the shuttle
 you arrived in, and afford space for its maintenance.  The vehicular
 airlock in the ceiling is closed, of course.  An airlock suitable for
 personnel is to the northeast, while an open airlock chamber is to the
 southeast.

>examine shuttle

>examine airlock

 You can't see any such thing.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dock Airlock</span>
 You can see a space suit and a big red button here.

>examine button

 Pushing the button cycles the airlock, for access to the lunar
 surface.

>examine suit

 If someone made a full-body parka out of tin foil, and added a bubble
 of a helmet, it might look something like this.

>wear suit

 You put on the space suit.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quarantine Lock</span>
 Theoretically, a room where terrestrial goods can be quarantined.  In
 practice, no one's going to wait an extra four weeks to eat a fresh
 pineapple.  The dock is to the northwest; the rest of the base is to
 the southeast.

 You can see a coffin here.

>examine coffin

 This insulated box seems to have been originally designed for the
 transport and storage of perishable food.  It now serves a nobler, if
 more tragic, purpose.

>open coffin

 You open the coffin, revealing a body.

>examine body

 This must be the previous zampolit officer.  His nakedness surprises
 you, but between the autopsy and lack of an open-casket funeral, it
 makes perfect sense.

 On the body is a crucifix.

>examine crucifix

 Such a thing is somewhat scandalous, and twice so on a political
 officer.  It is pendant from a silver chain, which is beginning to
 show some tarnish.

>examine chain

 DUFFY doesn't seem interested.

>duffy, analyze the crucifix

 You slip the crucifix into a slot in DUFFY.  The robot begins to
 churn, whine, grumble, and grind alarmingly.  Just when you're
 beginning to seriously worry that it might finally explode, it comes
 to an abrupt halt.  Its screen updates with a new message.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mechanical Workshop</span>
 This room is full of workbenches and power tools of various sorts.  A
 non-pressure door is to the southwest.  The quarantine area is to the
 northwest; the rest of the base is to the southeast.

 You can see the mechanical file cabinet here.

>examine file cabinet

 The standard government-issue battleship-grey file cabinet.  The
 Motherland may be built on vodka and blood, but her government is
 built upon a vast foundation of file cabinets just like this one.

>open it

 You open the mechanical file cabinet.

>look in it

 The contents seem to be arranged by date.  You could look up a
 particular date to find a specific record.

 You find several standard statement-of-work forms, but none of them
 seem particularly interesting.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mechanic's Quarters</span>
 A small, cramped room.  A cot, a locker, a small writing desk.  The
 place smells faintly of lightweight oil.  The only door is to the
 northeast.

 You can see Tsygan here.

>examine tsygan

 The mechanic, Tsygan, as you recall from your briefing, is in charge
 of all the mechanical systems and subsytems on the entire base, from
 life support to plumbing.  He is angrily mumbling under his breath
 about something.

>comrade, hello

 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>tsygan, hello

 There is no reply.

>examine cot

 As far as beds go, it's pretty spartan, even by your standards.  It
 looks like an air duct grille has been installed under it.

 This grille seems designed to admit airflow and little else.  It seems
 to be loose on its hinges.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mechanic's Quarters Duct</span>
 These cramped tubes beneath the flooring of the base provide fresh air
 to the various occupied spaces, although your own body is mostly
 preventing that from happening now.  It's easy to get disoriented in
 here.  There is a grille above your head.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mechanic's Quarters</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mess Hall</span>
 The largest room in the base by a fair margin.  There's enough tables
 and chairs here that everyone could eat by themselves if they wanted
 to; perhaps a larger crew was originally planned.  Access to the dock
 is afforded to the northwest.  The kitchen is conveniently located
 nearby to the southwest.  To the northeast, a hall leads to personnel
 quarters and offices.

 You can see Burlak here.

>examine burlak

 The gardner, Burlak, as you recall from your briefing, is in charge of
 the greenhouse and lunar excursions.  He looks approximately ancient.

 troubled one."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The room is dominated by a large counter, on which is spread a
 bewildering variety of bowls, knives, and food ingredients.  An
 industrial refrigerator stands in one corner; beside it, a strange
 contraption churns away.  A non-pressure door is directly to the
 south.  The mess hall is conveniently located nearby to the northeast;
 a hall is to the northwest.

 You can see Prokopenko here.

>examine prokopenko

 The cook, Prokopenko, as you recall from your briefing, is in charge
 of turning the dehydrated elementary particles of nutrition into
 something that a normal human might recognize as food.

>ask prodopenko about sablin

 You can't see any such thing.

>ask prokopenko about sablin

 "We did not always see eye-to-eye, it is true.  Still," he says, "it
 is a terrible thing, so close to his return to Earth."

>ask prokopenko about burlak

 There is no reply.

>examine refrigerator

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine contraption

 This machine, at first glance, defies comprehension.  It looks like an
 outboard motor engaged in some sort of kinky fan-belt-based bondage
 with the refrigerator.  You eventually puzzle out that it must be some
 sort of rigged-up stand mixer, for baking.

>ask prokopenko about contraption

 "It is a marvel, is it not?"  He does not await a reply.  "A few bits
 and pieces from here and there, and now I can bake a cake."

>prokopenko, bake cake

 There is no reply.

>look in contraption

 You find nothing of interest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Communications Room</span>
 Most of the room is filled with radio equipment.  There's a
 non-pressure door to the northeast.  A delicious smell wafts in from
 the southeast; to the southwest is the greenhouse dome.

 You can see the radio file cabinet here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 A pleasant respite from the rest of the base are the rows and rows of
 growing plants.  The greenhouse is a geodesic dome constructed from
 thick glass.  Metal shutters are retracted near the floor, ready to be
 deployed in case of danger.  The rest of the base is to the northeast.

 You can see a composter here.

>examine composter

 Just a large metal box, really, full of organic materials slowly
 decomposing into soil.  Worth more than gold, up here.

>search soil

 You can't see any such thing.

>get organic materials

 You can't see any such thing.

>search composter

 You dig around a bit in the muck.  Your fingers hit something which
 doesn't feel organic at all, so you pull it out -- it's a long black
 piece of rubber.  Surely that doesn't belong in the compost.  You pull
 it out.


 You can't see any such thing.

 You are carrying:
   an old fan belt
   a space suit

 He stops working for a moment.  "Ah, comrade.  I was hoping you'd drop
 by.  Here's the medical report regarding Sablin."  He hands you a
 medical report.

>read report

 Nothing is written on the medical report.

>examine report

 The medical report is several pages of dense medical jargon, but
 you're able to gather that it concludes that Sablin died from
 strangulation, late May 1 or early May 2.  He was found hanged in his
 quarters, once they kicked down the locked door.  It has been
 officially ruled a suicide.

>ask doctor about report

 He puts down his paperwork and regards you.  "I know you are
 newly-arrived, comrade.  I have been here eleven months, and I'm
 scheduled to return to Earth in a few weeks.  The zampolit was
 discovered behind a locked door, hanging from his neck.  In my
 professional opinion, that is a suicide, wherever it happens."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Observatory</span>
 This building seems to have been designed to be generally kept at

 "telescope", but presumably that's what all the dials and switches are
 for.  Covering a goodly portion of one wall is a larger-than-usual
 file cabinet.

 You can see the astronomical file cabinet here.

>open cabinet

 You open the astronomical file cabinet.

>examine it

 A larger-than-standard government-issue battleship-grey radio file
 cabinet.  The Motherland may be built on vodka and blood, but her
 government is built upon a vast foundation of file cabinets somewhat
 smaller than this one.  At a glance, you can see it is full of
 photographic plates, arranged by date.

>look up May 1 in cabinet

 You find a photographic plate for May 1.  Unlike the other plates, it
 is not full of stars -- it seems to be just an over-exposed field of
 white.  You take it anyway.

 PROKOPENKO NOT REPEAT NOT ROTATE OUT INSTEAD STAND ON ADDITIONAL YEAR.
 WILL INFORM PERSONALLY.  APPROVED BY ZAMPOLIT SABLIN.  END MESSAGE.

 There's a subtle whoosh of air as the life support system exhales
 through some nearby grille.

>ask prokopenko about sablin

 "We did not always see eye-to-eye, it is true.  Still," he says, "it
 is a terrible thing, so close to his return to Earth."

 There's a subtle whoosh of air as the life support system exhales
 through some nearby grille.

>arrest prokopenko

 You arrest Prokopenko, who is placed on the return shuttle for trial.

 Following months of deliberation, the jury finds that Prokopenko did
 the deed, traitorously angry from being recommended to another year of
 duty.  He is sentenced to life in the gulag.


     *** The End ***

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The room is dominated by a large counter, on which is spread a
 bewildering variety of bowls, knives, and food ingredients.  An
 industrial refrigerator stands in one corner; beside it, a strange
 contraption churns away.  A non-pressure door is directly to the
 south.  The mess hall is conveniently located nearby to the northeast;
 a hall is to the northwest.

 You can see Prokopenko here.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mess Hall</span>
 The largest room in the base by a fair margin.  There's enough tables
 and chairs here that everyone could eat by themselves if they wanted
 to; perhaps a larger crew was originally planned.  Access to the dock
 is afforded to the northwest.  The kitchen is conveniently located
 nearby to the southwest.  To the northeast, a hall leads to personnel
 quarters and offices.

 You can see Burlak here.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mechanical Workshop</span>
 This room is full of workbenches and power tools of various sorts.  A
 non-pressure door is to the southwest.  The quarantine area is to the
 northwest; the rest of the base is to the southeast.

 You can see the mechanical file cabinet here.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quarantine Lock</span>
 Theoretically, a room where terrestrial goods can be quarantined.  In
 practice, no one's going to wait an extra four weeks to eat a fresh
 pineapple.  The dock is to the northwest; the rest of the base is to
 the southeast.

 You can see a coffin here.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dock</span>
 Small as far as hangars go, but large enough to contain the shuttle
 you arrived in, and afford space for its maintenance.  The vehicular
 airlock in the ceiling is closed, of course.  An airlock suitable for
 personnel is to the northeast, while an open airlock chamber is to the
 southeast.

>in


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shuttle</span>
 The inside of this reusable space vehicle is cramped, but not
 unbearably so for the trip up from Earth.  A ramp has opened up,
 leading out into the base.

 You can see DUFFY here.

>duffy, analyze photograph

 You slip the photograph into a slot in DUFFY.  The robot begins to
 churn, whine, grumble, and grind alarmingly.  Just when you're
 beginning to seriously worry that it might finally explode, it comes
 to an abrupt halt.  Its screen updates with a new message.
   As well, a photograph is ejected by DUFFY and lands nearby.

>examine screen

 It reads:

 PHOTOGRAPHIC DATA ANALYZED.  PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFIED -- NICOTIANA
 RUSTICA -- COMMON NAME TOBACCO.   COMRADE BURLAK IDENTIFIED.

>get photograph

 Taken.

>examine it

 It appears as though the telescope can, in fact, be swivelled down to
 observe the base itself, or at least the greenhouse section.  Shown is
 someone squeezed into a cramped space, between the glass dome and some
 sort of metal wall.  He's surrounded by plants.

>examine ivanovsky

 The astronomer, Ivanovsky, as you recall from your briefing, is in
 charge of the observatory and its telescope, as well as all radio
 communications.  He is shockingly young.

>examine pictures

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine stars

 You can't see any such thing.

>ask ivanovsky about himself

 There is no reply.

>ask ivanovsky about sablin

 "I can't imagine what would drive him to it," he says.

>ask ivanovsky about ivanovsky

 He smiles modestly.  "Oh, you've probably read everything important
 about me in my file," he says.  "I operate the telescope and the
 radio, mostly."

>ask ivanovsky about me

 There is no reply.

 Ivanovsky is unimpressed.

 This game was written for the 2015 competition ShuffleComp: Disc 2,
 organized by Neil Butters.  The songs that inspired it, to greater or
 (mostly) lesser degrees, are:

 - <span class="floydstyle em">Rossiya</span> by Laibach, from Victor Gijsbers and Dannii Willis;
 - <span class="floydstyle em">Cha Cha on the Moon</span> by Pat Reader, from Marius Müller;
 - <span class="floydstyle em">Rocket Man</span> by Iron Horse, from Walter Sandsquish; and
 - <span class="floydstyle em">Russian Roulette</span> by Rihanna, from Matt Weiner.

 Many thanks are due to the organizer, the other entrants and their
 excellent taste in music, and to everyone who votes.  I am also
 indebted to Marc Blank for <span class="floydstyle em">Deadline</span>.

 Fair warning: this release has not been betatested.  If you decide
 not to play it for this reason, I have nothing but respect for you.
 If you press onwards, I wish you good luck.
