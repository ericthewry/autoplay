 Dear Ms. Gold:

 As you know, I have been unhappy for quite some time with your
 management of the PRISM Project. However, until now, I have always
 been able to live with your meddling incompetence.

 Your inept, disgraceful and insulting handling of the Phase III
 Funding Request has exceeded the generous boundaries of my patience.
 This was more than just another in a long series of Vera Gold
 fiascoes; this episode has seriously undermined the morale of my team
 and endangered the Project's long-range chances for

 (Phoenix) (10/11/30) In a case with far-reaching implications, the
 Arizona Supreme Court has ruled that state authorities cannot evict
 members of a religious sect from the radio telescope facility atop
 Greens Peak.

 The sect, a group of extremists calling itself the Church of God's
 Word, seized the facility in December of 2027, after group founder
 Ellis Vincent, 59, a minor engineer at the facility, claimed that
 signals emanating from a region in the constellation Cygnus were the
 revealed word of God.

 Although scientists once thought those signals might be a message from
 another intelligent race, light-years distant, most scientists now
 attribute the signals to a new type of quasar at the fringes of our
 universe. Despite this, members of the sect continue to believe that
 Greens Peak, which they call "The Mount," is a holy site, and the
 radio telescope is the "ear for hearing the word of God."

 A spokesman for the sect, Holy Keeper Sergei Korn, hailed the ruling
 as a sign of divine providence and revealed plans for constructing a
 temple there. Larron Hart, chairman of the American Foundation for
 Astronomical Research (AFAR), which built and ran the Greens Peak
 facility, expressed disgust at what he termed "a historically stupid
 decision," and vowed to appeal.

 The Church of God's Word, which received a great deal of media
 attention from the occupation of Greens Peak, has been growing rapidly
 during the past three years, and it now claims twenty thousand
 adherents worldwide. Vincent, who is referred to by his followers as
 the Holy Prophet, has not been seen in public since the takeover.

 (Colorado Springs) (11/17/30) Congress has approved the establishment
 of the Border Security Force as a separate, independent uniformed
 military service, to be headquartered in the Colorado facility known
 as the "Pentagon of the West."

 Since its creation in 2021, the BSF has been jointly administered by
 the U.S. Army and the CIA. Today's action makes the BSF the seventh
 branch of the Armed Forces, joining the Army, Navy, Marines, Coast
 Guard, Air Force and Space Force.

 Commander Rile McLoughlin, the current chief of the BSF, said that the
 BSF now has "the leeway we need to take the tough stance and
 courageous steps necessary to keep our nation free from the threat of
 nuclear blackmail."

 The BSF was established by Executive Order in 2021, after the
 completion of the USNA's TROY antimissile shield and the East Bloc's
 counterpart system fundamentally altered the East-West nuclear arms
 race from the building of missiles to the smuggling of miniature
 bombs.

 In its first nine years, the BSF has thwarted 13 attempts to bring
 fully armed nuclear devices into the USNA, as well as countless
 attempts to smuggle various parts and supplies that could be used for
 the construction of nukes. It is unknown whether any bombs have
 actually penetrated the American border.

 USNA and BSF officials have never confirmed the supposition that the
 BSF's secret charter also empowers it to smuggle nuclear devices into
 the territory of the East Bloc.

 The prevention of nuclear smuggling is expected to become even more
 difficult with the development of the nobelium bomb, a nuclear device
 which can theoretically fit in a space no larger than a pack of
 cigarettes.

 (Tripoli) (1/8/31) During 2030, Libya became a net exporter of oil for
 the first time since the 1998 nuclear accident that poisoned most of
 the Libyan oil fields.

 The turnaround was due to the opening of the first of six new
 refineries around the Gulf of Sidra. As the other five facilities are
 activated during the next three years, Libyan oil will add around
 seven percent to the world's petroleum supply. Experts predict that
 such a global oil glut would plunge the price of crude as much as
 twenty-five percent from its current price of $160 per barrel.

 The accident that decimated Libya's petroleum industry was allegedly
 caused by a mishandled attempt to develop a nuclear capability. The
 acquisition of a nuclear arsenal was a lifelong dream of former Libyan
 dictator Muammar Kaddafi, who perished in the blast along with nearly
 a million of his countrymen.

 (Vancouver) (2/6/31) The prestigious Manning Institute has released a
 study, entitled "The Tax Spiral: A Vicious Cycle," which details how
 nonreporting and underreporting of income is undermining the current
 tax structure. The study concludes that, unless changes are made, the
 federal revenue system could collapse by the end of the decade.

 The Tax Spiral is the phenomenon where high rates cause more people to
 cheat on their taxes, necessitating even higher rates, causing even
 more people to cheat, and so forth. Economists believe that the
 current tax spiral began in the late twentieth century.

 The following chart shows the growth of the "underground" economy --
 income nonreported and therefore not taxed:

 Senator Richard Ryder is the foremost spokesman for advocates of the
 Plan for Renewed National Purpose. Here are excerpts from several of
 his speeches on the Plan:

 "I've criticized the shiftless troublemakers in our nation often
 enough. But I also question the moral decay of our society that turns
 potentially fine young lads into shiftless troublemakers in the first
 place! Is it possible we've forgotten the basics of discipline, and
 misplaced the ability to instill the simple fundamentals of a humane
 society in our youths?"

 "Yesterday, I spoke to a man who waited for eleven hours at the local
 branch of the Federal Firearms Agency, just to get a permit for a gun
 so he could protect his family and his home. Now, anyone who knows me
 knows I haven't got a darn thing against legitimate functions of
 government. But when regulations, paperwork, and flim-flam bureaucracy
 get so out of hand that it interferes with a man's simple, decent
 attempt to protect his loved ones and personal property, then I say
 it's time for a drastic change."

 "Last year, this country subsidized sick, inefficient, dying
 industries to the tune of eighty billion dollars. Now, that's a lot of
 dough. Let's say you're Joe Average-Taxpayer. Last year, you made
 $90,000 and, if you're honest, you paid about $48,000 in taxes. That
 means that you spent about $400 so that Penn Steel or Powell Computers
 or KGN Media Services could stay in business. There are a lot of
 things Joe could do with that 400 bucks, and almost every one of them
 would have a healthier effect on our economy than life support for
 some archaic industry."

 "A lot of bleeding hearts these days are talking about how we ought to
 be sending a lot of money and stuff to countries that aren't as lucky
 as us. These misguided souls seem to think we're some kind of
 bottomless well of wealth, and they can just keep shipping that well
 water around the world, telling their thirsty little friends, 'No need
 for you to knuckle down and solve your problems -- we'll keep bailing
 you out!' And who are some of these poor little countries we're
 talking about? Greece! Guatemala! North Korea! Albania! The same
 countries that are always against the USNA in every issue, every
 forum, every two-bit propaganda show. I think I speak for a majority
 of my fellow citizens when I say, 'Let's start looking after our own
 interests first!'"

 "Yes, the problems of the nation are many, the troubles of the world
 are great. There is widespread despair among the people, and a clarion
 call cries out: 'Why? Why must this be so?' And now, electrified by
 the power of those cries, clouds of change are gathering on the
 horizon. Clouds that signify not another storm, but the dawning of a
 new day! A new day of growth, of prosperity, of hope, of reawakened
 moral values, of streamlined government, of respect for our country at
 home and abroad! The Plan for Renewed National Purpose would bring all
 that and more. The road is long, but with the Lord at our side, we are
 ready to take that first step!"

 The following excerpts are from a position paper issued by Citizens
 for Sanity in Government, a political action committee working for the
 reelection of President William Bowden:

 "Many of today's domestic problems, such as joybooth safety, high
 energy costs, or residual acidity in our precipitation, exist not
 because of sophisticated government regulation, but despite it."

 "Subsidization of industries caught in a changing economic environment
 is a temporary measure, vital to avoid severe, localized unemployment
 while retraining workers for healthier industries."

 "Global instability is exploited by East Bloc adventurism, not caused
 by it. Instability is the result of underdevelopment and
 overpopulation, and it will be cured not by militarization of these
 regions, but by development aid and education. These programs,
 expensive in this generation, will have tremendous paybacks in the
 years ahead."

 "The Plan's supporters are blatantly hypocritical. They call for
 old-fashioned laissez-faire capitalism, but at the same time they
 promise protectionist restrictions on trade imports. They pay lip
 service to the advantages of technological advance, but they quietly
 prepare to decimate funding for medical research, space exploration,
 and higher education."

 "The elements of the misnomered Plan for Renewed National Purpose are
 either dangerous overreactions to admittedly serious problems, or
 misguided concepts lacking any merit whatsoever. The Plan is the work
 of hypocrites and demagogues, clamoring for power by making promises
 they can never keep. Today's complex problems need and deserve sober,
 deliberate, difficult solutions, not cosmetic quick-fixes which sound
 inviting but promise even bigger problems further down the road."

 The HVAC Controller is a simple computer which activates and
 deactivates the heating, ventilating, and cooling systems of the PRISM
 complex.

 The complex is divided into four independent sectors, and the
 controller can be instructed to shut off or turn on the systems in any
 of them. For example:
    HVAC CONTROLLER, SHUT OFF COOLING FOR ALPHA SECTOR
    HVAC CONTROLLER, START VENTILATION IN GAMMA SECTOR
    HVAC CONTROLLER, TURN ON HEATING TO ALL SECTORS

 HVAC CONTROLLER, STATUS orders the device to give a report on the
 systems, by sector.

 The Janitorial Controller is a simple computer for scheduling various
 custodial functions in the PRISM complex.

 The four functions can be independently scheduled for any time between
 8:00pm and 11:30pm. Times must be submitted in numeric form. For
 example:
    JANITORIAL CONTROLLER, SET BATHROOMS FOR 9:00
    JANITORIAL CONTROLLER, CHANGE ROTATING FUNCTIONS TO 10:30

 The status command (JANITORIAL CONTROLLER, STATUS) will provide a
 report of the current schedule.

 The Metropolitan Traffic Computer controls all ground and aerial
 traffic patterns for greater Rockvil, based on expected periods of
 heavy usage. Although it is a sophisticated expert system, its
 interface is limited and simple.

 The start and end of morning rush hour can be scheduled for any time
 before noon, and the start and end of evening rush hour can be
 scheduled for any time after noon. Times must be submitted in numeric
 form; "am" or "pm" is obviously unnecessary. For example:
    TRAFFIC COMPUTER, SET MORNING RUSH HOUR START AT 7:00
    TRAFFIC COMPUTER, CHANGE EVENING RUSH HOUR END TO 6:30

 The STATUS command will give you the current rush hour schedule. More
 complex data input, such as additions to the traffic network, may be
 done only by authorized programmers.

 Heiman Village
 This massive complex is a revolutionary and controversial concept in
 urban development, the "city within a city." Apartments of every size,
 schools, offices, stores, and city services, all can be found under
 this one gigantic roof. Exits from the Village lead northwest, west,
 and east.

 Proponents of this type of city-microcosm say that it makes the
 desirable urban lifestyle available to the middle class, saves energy
 and commuting time, and shields people from the crime and pollution of
 the city streets.

 Critics call it an urban cocoon, creating a sterile, isolated
 environment and eliminating the need to deal with the urban problems
 which make isolation so desirable.

 Heiman Village, in the few years it has been open, has proved to be a
 tremendous commercial success, and more communities of the type are
 being planned.

 southwest are some brick houses, and a car lot occupies the northwest
 corner. All along the east side of the street is a huge construction
 site.

 Bend
 River Street curves here, heading downtown to the north and under an
 old railroad bridge to the southeast. To the northeast is an opening
 in a tall fence. A row of stores round the curve on the other side of
 the street: a laundromat to the west, a pharmacy to the southwest, and
 a hardware store to the south.

 A swirling wind catches a yellowed newspaper page, and blows it

 Wicker & River
 You have crossed the proverbial railroad tracks. The optimism and
 economic recovery don't seem to have spilled over into this run-down
 section of Rockvil, near the river. Wicker Drive, which runs northeast
 to southwest, cuts perpendicularly across River Street here. To the
 northwest, River dips under an unused rail bridge. There are factories
 on the northern and eastern corners. To the west is a dingy warehouse,
 and south of here are some dilapidated apartments. The smell of stale
 urine wafts from a stairway leading down to a gloomy Tube station.

 You are in a tangle of narrow streets. All the buildings around you

 The headline story in the news section is about the Index of Leading
 Economic Indicators, which are up a stunning 9.7% over last month, yet
 another indication of the economy's robust performance. Related
 stories discuss the unemployment rate, which is at the lowest level in
 almost thirty years, and commercial and housing construction, which
 are at an all-time high.

 Another major story covers President Ryder's speech for the
 Distinguished Lecturer Series of the Border Security Force Academy. In
 his address, the President called the '40s a "decade of new hope," and
 attributed much of that new hope to the work of the BSF, sending a
 signal to the entire world that the USNA "won't be pushed around by
 the biggest dictatorship or the smallest band of terrorist murderers."

 On one of the inside pages, an in-depth report on crime reveals that,
 although the overall crime rate has dropped only 4% over the last
 decade, public perception is that crime has fallen much further. The
 report attributes this perception to three points: Violent crime has
 decreased much faster than other types of crime, and is down by 15%
 from ten years ago. Crime in the schools, which has always gotten the
 most publicity, has dropped by 40%. Most importantly, offenders are
 getting harsher sentences, as opposed to the old days of getting off
 on technicalities, low bail, and easy parole.

 Other stories in the news section deal with the construction of a new
 InfoTech orbiting factory, deregulation of the medicinal drug
 industry, the war in Turkey, and plans for a lunar mining operation.
 An editorial calls for lowering draft board requirements in order to
 ease prison overcrowding.

 The headline story in the news section is about the Index of Leading
 Economic Indicators, which are up a stunning 9.7% over last month, yet
 another indication of the economy's robust performance. Related
 stories discuss the unemployment rate, which is at the lowest level in
 almost thirty years, and commercial and housing construction, which
 are at an all-time high.

 Another major story covers President Ryder's speech for the
 Distinguished Lecturer Series of the Border Security Force Academy. In
 his address, the President called the '40s a "decade of new hope," and
 attributed much of that new hope to the work of the BSF, sending a
 signal to the entire world that the USNA "won't be pushed around by
 the biggest dictatorship or the smallest band of terrorist murderers."

 On one of the inside pages, an in-depth report on crime reveals that,
 although the overall crime rate has dropped only 4% over the last
 decade, public perception is that crime has fallen much further. The
 report attributes this perception to three points: Violent crime has
 decreased much faster than other types of crime, and is down by 15%
 from ten years ago. Crime in the schools, which has always gotten the
 most publicity, has dropped by 40%. Most importantly, offenders are
 getting harsher sentences, as opposed to the old days of getting off
 on technicalities, low bail, and easy parole.

 Other stories in the news section deal with the construction of a new
 InfoTech orbiting factory, deregulation of the medicinal drug
 industry, the war in Turkey, and plans for a lunar mining operation.
 An editorial calls for lowering draft board requirements in order to
 ease prison overcrowding.

 Tube Station
 You are on a platform between two sets of tracks which lie to the
 northeast and southwest. On the wall is a red sign which reads:
   Elm and River Street
     (Heiman Village)
 A stairway leads up out of the station.
 A tubecar, its doors open, is waiting on the tracks to the northeast.

 Elm & River
 Elm Street begins here and crosses the downtown area to the west.
 Along the eastern side of River Street stands the vast Heiman Village
 building. You can enter Rockvil Mall to the southwest, or the old
 Stock Exchange building to the northwest. An entrance to a Tube
 station graces one corner of the intersection. The sidewalks and
 street are crowded with people.

 Elm & Kennedy
 This is an intersection with streets heading in the four cardinal
 directions. There is a park entrance on the northwest corner and a
 hospital on the southwest corner. To the southeast lies a shopping
 mall, and a large, old building with an impressive facade can be
 entered to the northeast.

 You are startled as a taxi horn blares nearby.

 Southway & Park
 Southway bends sharply at this intersection, leading east and
 southwest. Park Street begins here and heads north. There are new
 buildings on the northeast and western corners, and older-looking
 buildings to the northwest and southeast. A grocery store, its
 brightly lit window heaped with food, spans the southern side of the
 street.

>go west

 Parkview Apartments
 You are in the vestibule of a typical high-rise city apartment
 building. A wide expanse of labelled buzzers and tiny mailboxes fills
 one wall. Glass doors lie closed to the west. Next to this inner door
 is a picturephone. The street lies to the east.

 Living Room
 This is the large living area of your apartment, with a bedroom to the
 north and a kitchen to the east. The front door of the apartment, next
 to the couch on the south wall, is open. A huge window provides a
 panoramic view to the west.

 Jill's easel occupies a beautiful, well-lit spot near the window. Her
 current painting is on the easel. In one corner is the old word
 processor where you do your writing.
 There is a romance novel here.
 Jill is standing at the easel, working on her current painting.

 Jill looks up from her painting. "Hi, hon. Any news from your agent

 the woman. The man, in a gravelly voice, adds, "We've been to the
 Riviera, all over the Caribbean, but no place was as nice as Mexico.
 And it's so close to home!" The picture dissolves to a dark-skinned,
 bikini-clad woman walking through knee-deep surf. "A land of beauty,"
 hawks the voiceover, "closer than you've ever imagined. Mexico!"

 decided to embarrass me by being more severe than I predicted. It's
 already dumped nearly four inches of snow on Vancouver, and as our
 satellite photo shows, that storm system is just stalled there on the
 coast. They'll probably see another two or three inches before this

 Perelman walks into the office and spots the active light on your
 communication unit immediately. "Hello, PRISM," he says, sitting down
 at his desk. "It looks like you beat me here. Give me a moment,
 please." He begins quickly jotting a few notes onto a pad.

 Perelman looks up, smiling. "An excellent job, PRISM. We just finished
 viewing your recordings, and the experts were quite pleased." He
 pauses, as though realizing something for the first time. "In fact, I
 thought they looked pretty good myself. I suppose this means the
 Plan'll get adopted.

 "What's next for you, I wonder? You're going to be a hero, you know.
 You'd probably get a call from the President congratulating you,
 except of course that he's against the Plan." Perelman notices a paper
 on his desk. "Oh, apparently the Simulation Controller generated a lot
 of new data correlations while running your simulation. I'm not sure
 what the effect of that will be. Might make an even more accurate
 simulation possible.

 "Well, I've got another meeting now, as usual. But once again, thanks
 for not letting me down." Perelman leaves.

 Perelman's desk is covered with a number of items, including a
 decoder, a map of the city, a ball-point pen, and a printout of a

 Perelman enters with Dr. Ernest Grimwold, a quintessential Viennese
 psychiatrist whom you met a few days earlier, and nods to you. "Good
 afternoon, PRISM. You remember Dr. Grimwold."

 "It's a pleasure to see you again," says Grimwold, in an accent that
 matches his appearance perfectly. "This should take only a couple of
 minutes. I'm going to show you some patterns, and I simply want you to
 tell me the single word that comes to mind when you see them. Don't
 think about it; just say the first word you think of."

 placards. "Ready to begin?" he asks.

 A message begins coming over the message line: "Perelman to PRISM.
 Thought you'd be interested to know that, based on your recordings,
 the special Congressional subcommittee has recommended the Plan for
 full adoption, which might occur in just a few weeks. Things sure are
 moving fast. I don't know about you, but I still get a funny feeling
 about the Plan. Oh, well. By the way, I've been so snowed under I
 haven't had time to line up any projects for you. I'm really sorry; I
 hope you're keeping busy."

 Time passes...

 Doctor Perelman walks into the office, carrying a pile of pink message
 slips. He scans them, drops all but one into a basket on his desk,
 picks up the phone receiver, and presses two or three buttons. Your
 sensitive audio pickup hears a few rings, a click, and then a young
 woman's voice: "This is Esther Perelman. Can't come to the phone now.
 Please leave a message, though." Pause. "BEEP!" Perelman speaks into
 the phone. "Hi, it's Dad. I got your message, but I can't make it; I'm
 too tied up with the Project. I'll probably be in the office all
 evening if you want to talk."

 A message begins coming over the message line: "Perelman to PRISM,
 private line, no storage: Several of us have just finished viewing the
 record buffer, per your request. Please meet me at the communications
 outlet in my office right away."

 Time passes...

 Perelman walks into the office and spots the active light on your
 communication unit immediately. "Hello, PRISM," he says, sitting down
 at his desk. "It looks like you beat me here. Give me a moment,
 please." He begins quickly jotting a few notes onto a pad.

 Perelman looks up. "PRISM, the record buffer was empty. If this is
 your idea of a practical joke, it isn't very funny. We're pretty
 overworked around here as it is." He stalks out of the room.

 are a computer, and your life was merely a simulation whose purpose

    Riding some form of public transportation
    Attending a court in session
    Talking to a church official

 The newspaper is extremely thin, and the news section is the thinnest
 section of all. The lead story deals with the drop in USNA farm
 output, the first drop in twenty years. A spokesman for the Department
 of Agriculture attributed the decline to a year of unseasonable cold
 and low rainfall, and predicted that the coming year would more than
 make up for it. An alternative viewpoint was expressed by the head of
 the American Association of Agribusiness, who claimed the drop was
 caused by overfarming of lands, depletion of aquifers, and an increase
 in acid rain, and called for a massive government program to save the
 country's farms.

 Other stories cover the Ryder administration's support for a
 strip-mining bill; the announcement by Huang Laboratories that without

 "A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF GOD'S WORD

 The Church of God's Word is the vision of a great man, a man named
 Ellis Vincent. He alone, of all the scientists on the Mount who heard
 the signals, recognized them for what they were, the Word of God.

 The Holy Prophet was ridiculed and persecuted for his beliefs, but he
 had the strength that comes from knowing the Truth, and Followers
 began to hear those Truths and flock around him. They grew in numbers
 and in strength, and when the Evil Scientists of the Mount attempted
 to bar Vincent from the instruments there, he and his Followers rose
 up and smote the Evil Scientists.

 And so it came to pass, in 2025, that the Temple was founded on the
 Mount, and the Instrument of the Word was devoted entirely to
 listening to God's Word. Vincent interpreted the Words for his
 Followers, who broadcast the Message around the world, and branches of
 the Church appeared in many cities.

 When Vincent finally became very old, and God began to beckon his
 servant to his side, he taught the wisest of his Followers how to
 interpret the Word, so that the world would continue to understand the
 Word after he was gone. These Followers became the High Priests of the
 Church, who to this day continue to pass along God's Word."

 Southway & Kennedy
 Kennedy Street, from the north, ends here in a "T" with Southway. On
 the northwest corner is a tall, ugly office tower. The words "First
 Continent Bank Building" hang in large metal letters over the
 entrance, and a car lot fills the northeast corner. A row of old brick
 triple-deckers, once renovated, lines the southern side of the street.

 "A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF GOD'S WORD

 The Church of God's Word is the vision of a great man, a man named
 Ellis Vincent. He alone, of all the scientists on the Mount who heard
 the signals, recognized them for what they were, the Word of God.

 The Holy Prophet was ridiculed and persecuted for his beliefs, but he
 had the strength that comes from knowing the Truth, and Followers
 began to hear those Truths and flock around him. They grew in numbers
 and in strength, and when the Evil Scientists of the Mount attempted
 to bar Vincent from the instruments there, he and his Followers rose
 up and smote the Evil Scientists.

 And so it came to pass, in 2025, that the Temple was founded on the
 Mount, and the Instrument of the Word was devoted entirely to
 listening to God's Word. Vincent interpreted the Words for his
 Followers, who broadcast the Message around the world, and branches of
 the Church appeared in many cities.

 When Vincent finally became very old, and God began to beckon his
 servant to his side, he taught the wisest of his Followers how to
 interpret the Word, so that the world would continue to understand the
 Word after he was gone. These Followers became the High Priests of the
 Church, who to this day continue to pass along God's Word."

 The newspaper is extremely thin, and the news section is the thinnest
 section of all. The lead story deals with the drop in USNA farm
 output, the first drop in twenty years. A spokesman for the Department
 of Agriculture attributed the decline to a year of unseasonable cold
 and low rainfall, and predicted that the coming year would more than
 make up for it. An alternative viewpoint was expressed by the head of
 the American Association of Agribusiness, who claimed the drop was
 caused by overfarming of lands, depletion of aquifers, and an increase
 in acid rain, and called for a massive government program to save the
 country's farms.

 Other stories cover the Ryder administration's support for a
 strip-mining bill; the announcement by Huang Laboratories that without
 subsidized shuttle flights it would be forced to close GEO-7, the last
 remaining space factory; committee hearings on euthanasia legislation;
 the decision by a Church of God's Word priest in Arizona to run for a
 Senate seat; and a poll showing President Ryder enjoying a 71%
 approval rating.

 audit possibilities.

 The percentage of filers audited in a given year can be easily
 changed, and is usually based on the year's Auditing Division budget.
 This input must be in numeric form. The Auditing Computer will give
 status reports. Examples:

 Perelman looks up. "PRISM, several of my colleagues and I have
 finished viewing the recordings that you made, and while we saw some
 things that concerned us, we'd really need to see quite a bit more
 from a number of different years before drawing any conclusions. Maybe
 you could collect some more data, make some more recordings, and then
 report back to us. Well, I've got to run, but I'll talk to you later."

 Southway & River
 Here at River Street, Southway ends its long trip from the western
 suburbs. South of here, the street bends toward the river. To the
 southwest are some brick houses, and a car lot occupies the northwest
 corner. All along the east side of the street is the featureless,
 cliff-like facade of Heiman World. Little, if anything, has been done
 to restore the top several floors, gutted by fire about five years
 ago.

 That fire, which cost several thousand lives, revealed a severe
 deficiency of built-in fire control systems, but the courts threw out
 all suits since the building was built after the deregulation of the
 construction industry in '38, and the developer never falsely
 represented the building's safety systems. The sidewalks and street
 are crowded with people.

 Jill's current artistic endeavor, an acrylide painting, is on her

 The bedroom is sparsely furnished with a bed and bureau. A doorway

 You hear a noise from the open doorway and Jill comes running into the
 room. She seems terribly upset, throws herself against you, and begins
 sobbing uncontrollably. As you attempt to comfort her, she begins
 speaking between the sobs.

 "It's Mitchell," she begins, and a lifelong fear of injury to your
 only child clutches at your heart. "He's gone off and joined the
 Church of God's Word. He came and collected all his stuff about an
 hour ago. He said he's going to an orientation camp in Arizona. He
 says he'll never be able to speak to you or me again unless we join
 the Church. I followed him all the way to the airport but he wouldn't
 listen to me! He wouldn't even say goodbye to me! He wouldn't even..."
 She begins sobbing even more uncontrollably, breaks away from you, and
 throws herself down onto the bed.

 You hear a commotion in the hallway and then, as you rush into the

 "Hear and obey the Word of God.

 Ever since the brave crusade of the Holy Prophet Vincent against the
 evil sinners of the Mount, the priests of the Church of God's Word
 have been the sacred guardians of God's Mouth, passing along His Word
 as sent down from the heavens.

 The Lord Most High has been growing angry at His flock -- angry that
 there are some who do not heed His Word. He is sending a sign, a fiery
 star that will soon burn in our nighttime skies, to warn us that all
 created in His image must become brethren of His Church. The
 punishment for not doing so will be swift and cruel, and directed not
 just against the sinners but against all of mankind, such that all
 will suffer for the sins of the few.

 Our Father and Creator is demanding, but He is also generous and kind.
 When the day arrives that all men have joined His Church and heed His
 Word, he will bring down upon the Earth an epoch of such peace and
 beauty as the world has not seen since Eden. The choice He gives us is
 simple: Turn away and suffer, or Follow and live to see Heaven on
 Earth."

 You are at a perpendicular intersection formed by the north-south
 Kennedy Street and the east-west Aquarium Drive. On the northeast
 corner is the Chun Building, a small office building. On the other
 corners, scanning clockwise, are a dental school, the Aquarium, and a
 bank.

 Perelman looks up. "PRISM, several of my colleagues and I have
 finished viewing the recordings that you made, and everyone agreed
 that your recordings from 2061 were a bit worrisome. However, everyone
 also agreed that there weren't enough recordings from other years to
 show any sort of significant pattern. Maybe you could collect some
 more data, make some more recordings, and then report back to us.
 Well, I've got to run, but I'll talk to you later." He leaves the

 Southway & River
 Here at River Street, Southway ends its long trip from the western
 suburbs. South of here, the street bends toward the river. To the
 southwest are some brick houses, and a car lot occupies the northwest
 corner. All along the east side of the street is the featureless,
 cliff-like facade of Heiman World. Little, if anything, has been done
 to restore the top several floors, gutted by fire about five years
 ago.

 That fire, which cost several thousand lives, revealed a severe
 deficiency of built-in fire control systems, but the courts threw out
 all suits since the building was built after the deregulation of the
 construction industry in '38, and the developer never falsely
 represented the building's safety systems. The sidewalks and street
 are crowded with people.

 Jill's current artistic endeavor, an acrylide painting, is on her

 You hear a noise from the open doorway and Jill comes running into the
 room. She seems terribly upset, throws herself against you, and begins
 sobbing uncontrollably. As you attempt to comfort her, she begins
 speaking between the sobs.

 "It's Mitchell," she begins, and a lifelong fear of injury to your
 only child clutches at your heart. "He's gone off and joined the
 Church of God's Word. He came and collected all his stuff about an
 hour ago. He said he's going to an orientation camp in Arizona. He
 says he'll never be able to speak to you or me again unless we join
 the Church. I followed him all the way to the airport but he wouldn't
 listen to me! He wouldn't even say goodbye to me! He wouldn't even..."
 She begins sobbing even more uncontrollably, breaks away from you, and
 throws herself down onto the bed.

>wait

 You hear a commotion in the hallway and then, as you rush into the
 living room, a half-dozen Border Security Force officers storm in,
 rifles ready. You freeze as they tramp about the apartment wielding
 Rad-Detectors. After a few nightmare minutes, they seem satisfied and
 begin to leave. One officer turns to you. "The place is clean," he
 says gruffly. "Keep it that way." He slams the door behind him.

 that your recordings from 2061 were a bit worrisome. However, everyone
 also agreed that there weren't enough recordings from other years to

 Southway & River
 Here at River Street, Southway ends its long trip from the western
 suburbs. South of here, the street bends toward the river. To the
 southwest are some brick houses, and a car lot occupies the northwest
 corner. All along the east side of the street is the featureless,
 cliff-like facade of Heiman World. Little, if anything, has been done
 to restore the top several floors, gutted by fire about five years
 ago.

 That fire, which cost several thousand lives, revealed a severe
 deficiency of built-in fire control systems, but the courts threw out
 all suits since the building was built after the deregulation of the
 construction industry in '38, and the developer never falsely
 represented the building's safety systems. The sidewalks and street
 are crowded with people.

 filters through the walls, and the odor of mindex hangs in the air.
 The street lies to the east.

 Suddenly, the front door slams open, and dozens of uniformed officers
 burst into the building. They force their way into room after room,
 and through the nearby doorways you can see the police ransacking
 every room. Several students are hustled outside into a waiting police
 van. A higher-ranking officer passes by, and you can hear him saying
 something about "confiscated drugs" and "arrest will make a good
 example." A few minutes later, the raid is over, and the dorm is

 the inner sanctums to the east, and impressively tall arched doorways
 lead out to the northwest and southwest.

 "   --- New Pronouncements from The Mount ---

 Our Father in Heaven is pleased with the progress the Church is making
 toward Purifying His flock, and assures the Faithful that the day of
 deliverance is soon.

 He has instructed that new Worship Camps for the Unpure be opened in
 every part of His favorite nation. He has instructed that these be
 filled with more of the Beasts in Human Form, who have not joined the
 Church, or who are not considered fit to join the Church, so that they
 may be purified and sent to meet Him.

 He has instructed that only the officials of the Church may hold
 governmental posts, in order to speed His work and facilitate the
 dawning of the new Eden. He has, in his generosity, increased the
 number of slaves a Churchman may own, from twenty-five to fifty.

 This is the Word of God; blessed be His name."

 Southway & River
 Here at River Street, Southway ends its long trip from the western
 suburbs. South of here, the street bends toward the river. To the
 southwest are some brick houses, and a car lot occupies the northwest
 corner. All along the east side of the street is the featureless,
 cliff-like facade of Heiman World. Little, if anything, has been done
 to restore the top several floors, gutted by fire about fifteen years
 ago.

 That fire, which cost several thousand lives, revealed a severe
 deficiency of built-in fire control systems, but the courts threw out
 all suits since the building was built after the deregulation of the
 construction industry in '38, and the developer never falsely
 represented the building's safety systems.

 Elm & Kennedy
 This is an intersection with streets heading in the four cardinal
 directions. There is a complex of high-security townhouses on the

 by cheap wooden boards, lie closed to the west. Next to this inner

 looking for a hiding place, but fortunately the mob turns onto an

 Out of the corner of your eye, you glimpse something that looks like a

 looking for a hiding place, but fortunately the mob turns onto an
 adjoining street. You stand frozen for a minute as the sounds from the
 mob recede.

 Midland & River
 Eastbound Midland Avenue forms a "T" with River Street at this
 intersection. To the northeast is a graceful structure of marble and
 glass, bearing the black radar dish symbol of the Church. The ALI
 Building, headquarters of the American Life Insurance group and a
 fairly typical twenty-first century skyscraper, extends along the
 western side of the street, and a car lot occupies the southeast

 Main & River
 This is a typical four-way intersection between Main and River
 Streets. An entranceway through the massive walls of Heiman Village
 fills the southeast corner of the street, and a former health care
 facility occupies the northeast corner.

 To the southwest is 80 River Street, a forties-style plastalloy and
 glass office building. The fourth corner, the northwest, is the site
 of Perez Towers, a luxury apartment building.

 Time passes...

 With a roar of tromping feet, six or eight heavily armed Church police
 storm into the apartment. You see a look of horror come over Jill, as
 she covers her mouth with the back of her hand, as though stifling
 some silent scream. You follow her gaze, and -- a shock of recognition
 -- sauntering in behind the police...

 The ten years since you last saw him have left scant change on the
 face of your son. "Mitchell!" you yell, and take a step toward him,
 but a blow from one of the cops sends your frail, old body flying
 against the wall.

 "She is the one." The voice is Mitchell's, but the tone is cold,
 unrecognizable, sending shivers through you. He raises a fur-clad arm,
 pointing at his mother without a hint of emotion. "She spake against
 the Church; she tried to poison the mind of a child too young to know
 the Truth." The thugs grab Jill, who reaches toward Mitchell, tears of
 terror streaming down her face. Totally unresponsive, he turns and
 walks calmly out of the apartment.

 As Jill is dragged, screaming and crying, through the front door, you
 try to follow, but a cop pummels you in the stomach with his club. You
 fall to the floor, retching, as the apartment door slams closed,
 shutting you off forever from the son you cannot understand and the
 wife you will never see again.

 satisfied and march out without a word, leaving the door open behind

 cluttered and disorganized. Overstuffed bookshelves line the room.
 Perelman's desk is covered with a number of items, including a
 decoder, a map of the city, a ball-point pen, and a printout of a
 magazine article.
 Doctor Perelman is sitting at his desk, reading through stacks of
 papers and occasionally typing on his desk terminal.

 Perelman looks intrigued. "You've recorded something interesting, eh?
 Let me get a few of my colleagues together, and we'll view the buffer.
 I'll let you know when we're done, okay?" He leaves the room.

 Perelman walks into the office and spots the active light on your
 communication unit immediately. "Hello, PRISM," he says, sitting down
 at his desk. "It looks like you beat me here. Give me a moment,
 please." He begins quickly jotting a few notes onto a pad.

 Perelman looks up. "PRISM, several of my colleagues and I have
 finished viewing the recordings that you made, and everyone agreed
 that 2051, '61, and '71 all looked disturbing. But there wasn't
 anything interesting from 2081. Perhaps things turn around. Maybe you
 could collect some more data, make some more recordings, and then
 report back to us. Well, I've got to run, but I'll talk to you later."
 He leaves the room.

 The street runs from west to east, where a bridge is visible. A crude
 sign is posted just west of here. Another road leads south into a
 different section of town, where smoke billows upward from scattered
 fires. Buildings all along the street look typically looted and
 deserted; a grocery store, its large plate glass window shattered, is
 on the southwest corner. On the southeast corner is the burnt-out
 shell of a building, and an overgrown cemetery lies to the north. As
 usual, all the telephone poles have been chopped down for firewood.

 Wicker & Pier
 Rats scamper among the weeds growing through the cracks in the street
 and among the ruined buildings. A pallor of smoke hangs in the air,
 and a distant sound like a drumbeat gives this area the feel of a
 surreal jungle.
 Suddenly, you are surrounded by a group of men clad only in loin
 cloths, their faces marked with charcoal in an identical, tribal
 pattern. You are quickly bound and gagged, and carried to an open area
 where many people with similar facial markings are gathered.

 You are tossed helplessly in the center of the clearing, amidst bones
 that are unmistakably human. Wood is quickly gathered for a bonfire,
 and you are rudely thrown upon it. Through the agonizing pain of the
 fire, you hear the tribal members chanting. Your last sight is of one
 of your captors, tending the fire and salivating like a wild animal.

 They tear towards you, driven by mindless animal hunger, saliva

 split second the other animals are on top of you as well.

 Perelman hesitates. "I feel <span class="floydstyle em">proud</span> of you right now." He grabs

 Your inept, disgraceful and insulting handling of the Phase III

 The HVAC Controller is a simple computer which activates and
 deactivates the heating, ventilating, and cooling systems of the PRISM
 complex.

 The complex is divided into four independent sectors, and the
 controller can be instructed to shut off or turn on the systems in any
 of them. For example:
    HVAC CONTROLLER, SHUT OFF COOLING FOR ALPHA SECTOR
    HVAC CONTROLLER, START VENTILATION IN GAMMA SECTOR
    HVAC CONTROLLER, TURN ON HEATING TO ALL SECTORS

 HVAC CONTROLLER, STATUS orders the device to give a report on the
 systems, by sector.

 The office door opens, and Doctor Perelman walks in. You can see at

 later, a second man walks in, a man with a charismatic presence, a man
 you instantly recognize from myriad news reports -- Richard Ryder.

>examine ryder

 3/29


 Ryder's most striking features are his sharp eyes, his thick blown-dry
 hair, and his energetic charisma. Although he is red-faced, barking
 mad, the presence that has given him such wide public appeal is
 readily apparent.

 "How dare you come in here with all..." Perelman begins yelling,
 before Ryder cuts him off with a sharp "Shut up, Perelman! I'm doing
 the talking here, so get used to it! You're not in control here
 anymore, and I am!" Perelman suddenly stiffens ever so slightly and
 nonchalantly slides some papers across his desk, as though to cover
 something.

>examine Perelman
 10:2
 3/29


 Perelman is an older man, in his late fifties, and has a white goatee.

 "Now let's get a few ground rules straight, Perelman. Nothing is
 stopping the Plan. Even if I <span class="floydstyle em">didn't</span> think your damn tapes
 were faked, I wouldn't give a damn. A helluva lot of people have a
 helluva lot at stake in this thing, and so what if a lot of creeps who
 can't take care of themselves get a little hurt." "I'm very
 frightened, Senator," says Perelman, his voice laced with sarcasm.
 "Shut up," Ryder shouts back. "I said that I'm doing the talking
 here!"

>wait

 Time passes...

 "And let me tell you another thing, Perelman. Don't think that just
 because you've been on the news and been a big hot shot around here,
 you're gonna get some special consideration, because all that doesn't
 mean diddly-squat in the kind of power circles I'm talking about!"

>again

 Ryder is getting really worked up; his normal, fatherly demeanor is
 completely gone. "Perelman, you're an even bigger idiot than I
 imagined if you think we'd let some two-bit egghead scientist and some
 high-tech whiz bang computer stand in our way! Remember this -- if you
 were to have some unforeseen accident, you wouldn't be the first
 person who's gotten crushed by standing in the way of the Plan!"
 Perelman, with a quick glance in your direction, says, "Quite an
 oration, Senator. Vintage thug. I wish I could save it for posterity.
 Would you be willing to go on the record with that statement?" Ryder
 becomes even more livid. "A real jokester, huh? Lemme tell you this,
 Perelman -- you'd better stop joking and start listening to my advice,
 or you're not going to be around to care about posterity, understand?"

>record on

 don't worry about visitors; we'll take care of that. And if I get any
 trouble out of you, I swear to God I'll personally pull the plug on
 that goddam wonder machine of yours. Got it?" He stomps out without
 waiting for a reply, leaving Perelman sputtering in anger. A few
 seconds later, National Guardsmen enter and escort Perelman away.

 The IRS Auditing System is a data-oriented computer with massive
 storage capacity. Using its database, it produces lists of the best
 audit possibilities.

 The percentage of filers audited in a given year can be easily
 changed, and is usually based on the year's Auditing Division budget.
 This input must be in numeric form. The Auditing Computer will give
 status reports. Examples:
    AUDITING SYSTEM, STATUS
    AUDITING SYSTEM, CHANGE AUDITING PERCENTAGE TO 5

 A message begins coming over the message line: "PRISM!" It's Perelman,
 sounding giddy with joy. "You've done it! That was brilliant,
 absolutely brilliant, sending your recordings out over the World News
 Network! Ryder just left here so fast and so mad like nothing I've
 ever seen! The switchboard is lighting up like crazy, and I just got
 off the phone with President Bowden himself!" You hear the sound of
 whooping and cheering in the background, and Perelman gives a
 "Yeehah!" more suited to a Texas cattle rancher than a Jewish big-city
 scientist. "The National Guard unit has just been recalled! PRISM, the
 Plan is dead in the water -- you're a hero!"

 "PRISM, the supercomputer who exposed the Ryder scandal, will soon be
 granted his final request: to live out the remainder of his days --
 and how long that might be, nobody knows -- simulating his human
 existence. PRISM, who recently received the Congressional Medal of
 Honor as well as a citation from President Bowden, has been spending
 much of his time in simulations, giving top grades to the
 administration's new program to replace the discredited Plan.

 "At a press conference in Rockvil, Doctor Abraham Perelman, one of the
 creators of PRISM, insisted that the world's first intelligent machine
 was, in fact, quite human." The picture cuts to Perelman, standing
 behind a podium. "His body may be silicon and steel," Perelman is
 saying, "but in his heart he's as human as anyone I've ever met. As
 PRISM prepares to embark on his final voyage of the mind, I'd like to
 read a line from 'Hamlet' as his epitaph, so to speak: 'He was a man,
 take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.'"

 The image from the WNN Feed suddenly blinks off, and you find yourself
 back at the entry level of Communications Mode. The list of outlets
 indicates that none are currently active. A message is coming in:
 "PRISM, programming of the Simulation Controller with the parameters
 of the New Plan is complete. Everything is set for you to enter

 Sunlight spills off the vines and shrubs of this wide outdoor terrace.
 The view, always breathtaking, seems particularly sharp today; beyond
 the parklands and forests to the west, the foothills of the Rockies
 are clearly visible; to the south, the river bends around Rockvil
 before flowing upcountry toward North Dakota and the Garrison Lakes.

 The headline story is about a newly released study which indicates
 that the average life expectancy for both sexes has now passed one
 hundred years, and success in the development of regeneratives should
 send that figure even higher. Despite the dropping mortality rate,
 global population remains stable at just under two billion, with
 offworlding now running at a staggering seven million people annually.

 To celebrate next month's special twentieth anniversary Disarmament
 Day, the World Council has passed a bill authorizing fireworks
 displays in each of the former capital cities of the twenty-two former
 nuclear powers. The fireworks displays, by Aerialist designer Jean
 M'gomo, will feature disarmament themes, and will be the largest
 display of pyrotechnic art in this century.

 A story on an inside page catches your eye: "Perry Simm, Noted Author,
 To Join Crew of Silver Dove," reads the headline. "Perry Simm, author
 and poet, recipient of the 2089 Mexicana Prize, has been selected from
 nearly a thousand applicants to be the resident author aboard the
 Silver Dove, the space colony that is currently being equipped for
 mankind's first interstellar journey, a trip expected to last a dozen
 generations."

 Kitchen
 Rimmed with butcher-block counters, softly lit by recessed zyolights,
 and decorated in a random pattern of pastel tile, the kitchen is both
 lovely and functional. You can exit to the west.

>examine counters
 9:51
 7/18


 There is nothing on the counter.

 The gentle voice of your domestic computer calls softly from one of
 its many unseen speakers. "The skycab you asked for is now waiting on
 the roof." Jill appears at the top of the steps with the robutler, who
 is carrying several bags. "Algie has everything, Perry. Let's get
 going!"

 You take a last look around the apartment and follow Jill and Algie
 into the hallway and up to the roofpad. As you clamber into the
 waiting skycab, Jill gives the robutler a fond farewell pat. The
 skycab climbs lazily and veers off to the northeast.

 Skycab
 This skycab is a luxurious, top-of-the-line model, a veritable sky
 limousine. The opulent features include reclining seats, tinted
 zero-glare windows, and a two-meter viewscreen.

>examine viewscreen
 9:52
 7/18


 At the moment, the screen is dark.

 The cab enters the central Rockvil traffic pattern, gently curving
 along the ring of downtown parks. You can see a festival of some sort
 in Halley Park. The gold and crimson tents of the festival form a
 multicolored patchwork against the green background of the city's
 oldest park.

 Jill, glancing through yet another magazine article on the Silver
 Dove, says, "This story talks about the new athletics and art forms
 that are still being discovered for the weightless area at the axes of
 the habitats. Oh, Perry, I'm so excited," she adds, unnecessarily.

>turn on viewscreen
 9:53
 7/18


 The screen is activated automatically by incoming transmissions.

 The skycab continues its wide arc around the downtown area,
 approaching the Rockvil Pier. The river is dotted with sailboats, and
 a tourboat is just pulling away from the pier for a daytrip upriver,
 through Montana to the Devil's Tower region of Wyoming. Along the
 river, south of the pier, are the outdoor shells and amphitheatres of
 the Riverside Cultural Center.

>wait
 9:54
 7/18


 Time passes...

 As the cab whisks northward along the edge of the river, you can make
 out the gleaming surface of the receiver station, nestled among the
 forests west of the city, where orbiting solar collectors beam their
 precious energy.

>wait
 9:55
 7/18


 Time passes...

 As the skycab begins its approach to the spaceport, it passes over the
 museum established on the site of the former BSF Base, a sobering
 monument to one of mankind's great follies.

 Suddenly the viewscreen lights up, and Mitchell's face appears. "Hi,
 Mom, Dad! I wanted to wish you bon voyage, and I enlisted a little
 help!" He expands the field of vision to include the entire living
 room of his spacious apartment at the Marine Biology Institute in Nova
 Scotia. The room is filled with your grandchildren and
 great-grandchildren, plus various in-laws, more than twenty members of
 the Simm clan. Everyone is hooting, yelling, waving, and blowing
 kisses. "We're having a big party in your honor -- I'm only sorry we
 couldn't be there with you. We're real proud of you both, and excited
 for you, too. Call me when you get to the habitat! Bye!" The clan
 signs off by singing Auld Lang Syne, and when the screen goes dark,
 you notice that Jill's eyes are wet, and a second later you realize
 that yours are, as well.

>wait
 9:55
 7/18


 Time passes...

 With the gentlest bump, the skycab settles into a landing bay at the
 spaceport terminal. Jill reaches over and gives your hand an excited
 squeeze. Through the window of the skycab, you can see the sleek,
 white shuttle waiting to carry you on your first leg of the journey
 to...to what? The Silver Dove would be more than just another space
 colony. It was the pinnacle of an eon of human achievement, the first
 step into interstellar space.

 You and Jill would never live to see the completion of that first
 step, generations hence. (Although in the germfree, low-gee
 environment of a habitat, and with the recent strides in health and
 longevity research, who could say for sure?) But you would still have
 been part of that dawning of a new age, that future of unlimited
 potential. Humanity was beginning a journey into the universe, a
 voyage that would last forever.

 <span class="floydstyle em">A</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Mind</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Forever</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Voyaging</span> would not
 have been possible without the effort of many people. Marc Blank made
 the changes to our development tools that "pushed back the envelope"
 and made Interactive Fiction Plus (tm) a reality.

 As always, all the other authors pitched in when needed, but I want to
 particularly acknowledge the help of Stu Galley and Jerry Wolper.

 As a former playtester, I can say with authority that the testing of
 <span class="floydstyle em">A</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Mind</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Forever</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Voyaging</span> was
 superb. I appreciate the efforts of everyone who tested, especially
 Amy Briggs, Gary Brennan, Tomas Bok, Max Buxton, and Suzanne Frank.

 Paul Gross, Linde Simpson, Duncan Blanchard, Mike Morton, Rick Lay and
 Andy Kaluzniacki performed various wizardries on the micro-computers
 which run <span class="floydstyle em">A</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Mind</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Forever</span> <span class="floydstyle em">Voyaging</span>.

 The package was designed by Carl Genatossio and Elizabeth Langosy.
 Package art was the work of Larry Winborg and Jess Nicholas, and
 photography the work of Ralph King.

 Finally, I'm extremely grateful to Jon Palace for immeasurable advice
 and support throughout this project.
