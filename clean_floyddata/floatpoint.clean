 Are you sure you want to quit? Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation,
 library version 0.9.0.





 It is night on this side of the planet. Settled areas are lit: a jagged
 crescent in the tropics, lining the inland sea. The bright splatter
 along the top of the curve is Tanhua, as bright from space as New York.
 The north continent is darker, sprinkled finely with small lights,
 where the failing climate makes it hard to survive a winter. And the
 northernmost point, almost lost on the slope of Mt. Cordia, is the
 original Aleheart Colony, where the first settlers from Earth landed.
 It is your destination as well.

 Altogether, the population comes to two hundred and thirty-seven
 million not-quite-humans, most likely doomed if they stay here. The ice
 comes faster every year. It would have been more convenient if they had
 had this crisis twenty years ago, but Earth can still use it.

 Your job is to make an arrangement acceptable to both sides, to bring
 the Aleheart population home.

 The shuttle drops.

 HELP to learn about special commands unique to this game.

 Lakeshore
 When Aleheart Colony was choosing landing spots, Cordia Peak was deemed
 a good source of geothermal and hydroelectric energy. This lake, snug
 under the mountain, is the oldest manmade thing on the planet; you have
 a poster of it at home.

 In the early pictures, the lake is whitish, silty water in a bowl of
 bare rock, fed by a trickle of glacial runoff, and dammed at the south
 end with concrete. Now it is deep blue. The glacier has progressed so
 far that it forms a wall across the north end of the lake, tall enough
 to block any view of Cordia Peak except the summit. Icebergs float on
 the water. Fine black grass, rippled like velvet, grows on the bank. At
 the south end, the concrete too is gone; the water simply seems to
 stop.

 The arc of Aleheart's ring system crosses the southern sky, much the
 same pale white as the moon in daytime.

 A narrow path climbs west through a low point in the ridge and
 continues along the face of the glacier towards town.

 I beg your pardon?

 Lakeshore
 The glacier forms a wall across the north end of the lake, tall enough
 to block any view of Cordia Peak except the summit. Icebergs float on
 the water. Fine black grass, rippled like velvet, grows on the bank. At
 the south end, the water simply seems to stop.

 The arc of Aleheart's ring system crosses the southern sky, much the
 same pale white as the moon in daytime.

 A narrow path climbs west through a low point in the ridge and
 continues along the face of the glacier towards town.



>examine glacier
 Where the glacier moves over land, the leading edge crumbles into a
 slope; but here, where it is moving into water, icebergs are carried
 away, leaving a sheer cliff face. The ice is pale blue in
 cross-section, with striations of dirt, and, in a few layers, something
 blacker that looks like ash.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a comfortable outfit of chronometer, grey undersuit, shoes, and socks

 You have a little time to look around, but you shouldn't drag this out
 for long: you're supposed to meet your predecessor, Ambassador Valenti,
 in the center of town, as soon as possible.

>examine icebergs
 Weathered into odd shapes, some small enough to pick up, some as large
 as a yacht. A few are implausibly top-heavy above water, having melted
 into a barbell shape.

>take iceberg
 You're too far away to do anything but look.

 You've been warned you'll hate the ring come winter, when it forms a
 dusty shield between you and the sun, when the snow comes in sudden
 fierce storms and then refuses to melt, when there are no stars to be
 seen.

 Now, in summer, it is a gleaming, moon-colored arc, the skeleton of a
 rainbow.

 You remind yourself about the waiting Valenti.

 Now, in summer, it is a gleaming, moon-colored arc, the skeleton of a
 rainbow.

 With a roar, a big chunk of the glacier calves off and falls into the
 lake -- it seems in slow motion -- and water sprays up around it,
 surprisingly high.

 Where the glacier moves over land, the leading edge crumbles into a
 slope; but here, where it is moving into water, icebergs are carried
 away, leaving a sheer cliff face. The ice is pale blue in
 cross-section, with striations of dirt, and, in a few layers, something
 blacker that looks like ash.

 The ripples from the far end of the lake reach your shore and die out.

 You can't see any such thing.

>look
 You climb the gravel pathway. On Earth you would be struggling more
 with this slope; the lighter gravity and richer air are a great help.
 Even so, it's a trip of some minutes.

 Aleheart's Edge
 This is as far north as you can come without ice-climbing. The glacier
 is chunks and patches of ice at first, but soon solid beyond that.
 There are rocks on the face of it, and twisted metal, and scraps of
 buildings, which were formerly the northern part of town.

 You can feel the frigid air coming off of it, and hear the rumble of
 breaking and shifting ice -- the danger is obvious -- but somehow it
 gives the impression you could start walking now and in an hour come to
 the summit; stand at the top of Cordia and turn around, and see the
 rings filling the sky and the visible curvature of the world, the
 western ocean green with engineered algae, the patches of land made
 fertile and those still barren rock.

 From this direction the rings frame the outline of town, off toward the
 south.

 A narrow path descends east along the side of the glacier towards the
 lakeshore.

 Aleheart's Edge
 This is as far north as you can come without ice-climbing. The glacier

 There are rocks on the face of it, and twisted metal, and scraps of
 buildings, which were formerly the northern part of town.

 You can feel the frigid air coming off of it, and hear the rumble of
 breaking and shifting ice. The initial inclination to climb the face of
 Cordia has worn off, but there's still something intriguing about it.

 From this direction the rings frame the outline of town, off toward the
 south.

 A narrow path descends east along the side of the glacier towards the
 lakeshore.

 Cordia Peak dominates the northern horizon. The perfect symmetry
 reminds you of Fuji, though this mountain is wider, bulked out by the
 layers of glacial ice. But it could erupt at any time, turning all that
 ice into floodwater.

 It was self-indulgence to have the shuttle set you down at the
 Lakeshore, since you wanted to have a look at the part of the Colony
 you would recognize from pictures, before going on to the part that
 would be strange to you. But you shouldn't drag this out.

 You walk about half a mile. There are now some buildings along the east
 side of the street, though most of them are abandoned.

 Broad Street
 To the northwest is a public building with a deep portico; to the east,
 one with a conical roof. The others are private houses, but, except one
 or two, they don't look lived in. There is a general atmosphere of
 neglect.

 The street continues south into the heart of town, or north towards the
 mountain and the glacier. A track for a floating train cuts southeast
 between the buildings.

 The rings in the southern sky are partly obscured by the buildings on
 the horizon, but are still bright enough to catch the eye.

 After a few minutes of walking, you reach an area with Colonists
 around. You carefully don't stare at them as they carefully do not
 stare at you. But from the sides of your eyes you watch how they float
 a few inches off the ground; how they do not touch things.

 Clearing
 The street runs north/south, so that you have an uninterrupted view of
 Cordia Peak, and the leading edge of the glacier at the northern edge
 of town.

 Both sides of the street are built up. A substantial building of metal
 and glass lies to the east, houses to the west.

 The ring system is mostly obscured by the grand solarium to the south,
 accessible through the insulating doors. The solarium is a huge domed
 structure to keep in as much heat and warmth as possible; the Earth
 embassy is inside.

 At the center of the open space here is a monument shaped like a tusk
 or tooth. This is the landmark: Ambassador Valenti is going to meet you
 here -- in fact, he was supposed to be waiting.

 Mentally you check off "go to the Clearing to meet Valenti" on your
 list of remaining tasks. You run over the things you still need to get
 done before you can settle in:
   find out what Valenti wanted
   show up at the Embassy

 (To stop receiving reminders of your schedule, try REMINDERS OFF. You
 may still view them manually with THINK.)

 It has look of force-grown bone, monolithic and taller than a man.

 The symbolic lettering of the current language has been painted on the
 side, but the original carving is in Chinese and English: "To those
 who, in the name of the Company and for the advancement of knowledge,
 were killed, modified incorrectly, or born unfit."


 A flash of memory: Kruger has turned his chair toward the window and
 was looking out over the water. "They want to send some colonists back
 to Earth," he says. "To repopulate. They're losing climate control, and
 they're afraid they can't turn it around. And we could use them, to be
 honest."

 You start to comment, but he goes on. "And your future boss is insane
 and a genius and needs watching. I know you're too senior to be
 someone's lackey. But these are not normal circumstances."

 What you heard on the way here was more worrying: anecdotes that
 Valenti had gone native; that he had stopped answering official mail;
 that he was in love with a native woman; that a native man was in love
 with him. That he abused his assistants. That he was concealing a
 sinister truth he had learned about the Colony. That he was not human.
 That he was human, but had been talking with a native scientist about a
 genetic retrofit.

 Kruger's last message didn't reach you until you were in orbit here:
 that you were not to be a lackey after all; that you were to take over
 the job of ambassador yourself. "Valenti has been notified," he said.

 So this is the man you're waiting to meet, and all you know of his
 character is that he is not punctual.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

 It's a huge dome and encloses not only gardens but also a good number
 of buildings. The Embassy is inside, you gather, but not visible from
 here.

 Out of the doors to the south comes a short, balding man, walking
 briskly for someone so late. So this will be Valenti, then.

 "Ambassador Moskin. Welcome to Aleheart," he says, shoving both hands
 deep in his pockets. Perhaps it would be uncouth to shake hands in
 public. "I read your file."

 "Pleasure to meet you," you begin, but you get no further than that
 before he interrupts.

 "You're out of your depth." He kicks a spray of gravel into the bushes.
 A young female coming along the path lifts her head in surprise and
 floats to the side before passing him. (A heressa: the female colonists
 are called heressa when they have reached the age of maturity.)

 "Your previous assignment was New Zealand?" He bounces on the balls of
 his feet, getting in your face. "New Zealand has humans. Who speak
 English."

 His eyes are black. His hair, if he had much, would be black. He
 reminds you of nothing so much as a plutonium ball: small, dense,
 packed with malignant energy.

 "There's only one reason High Command would replace me with you," he
 says. "You'll do what they say." He takes something out of his pocket
 and tosses it to you. It is, you see, the size and shape of a skipping
 stone, a widget that can be turned on. "You'll need this."

 "What is it?"

 He laughs, waves, and begins walking swiftly down the gravel path.
 "Don't lose it!" he calls back. "You'd better hurry. My feckless
 assistant Liam is waiting for you. Your feckless assistant now, I
 suppose."

 You consider chasing him, but it's obvious that he's in such a mood
 that he will be no help to you anyway. Instead you weigh the stone in
 your hand, frowning.

>examine stone
 A plain grey device, fitted to the shape of the hand, and turned off at
 the moment.  There is an inscription on the back, and it is in English:
 To LV from A3205.

 Mentally you check off "find out what Valenti wanted" on your list of
 remaining tasks. You run over the things you still need to get done
 before you can settle in:
   show up at the Embassy

>turn stone on
 You tap the widget and it warms in your hand -- more waking up than
 being switched on, somehow. After a moment, three numbers appear on
 its... skin? The later digits flicker: SOC 15.7759, POW 20.00197, INT
 11.2261. Below this, in smaller letters: SQUEEZE TO SUMMON AIDES.

>squeeze stone
 The surface has a give to it, and it squeaks once. Small regretful
 letters read: AIDE CURRENTLY OUT OF RANGE. Maybe in the embassy proper,
 then.

 The chronometer chirps, indicating that you have a new message waiting
 to be read in the Embassy communications room. You should get inside
 and check your mail. This will be important.

 You run over the things you still need to get done before you can
 settle in:
   check your messages
   show up at the Embassy

 The air inside is thicker, denser, more humid: more like Earth. The
 paths are crowded with people coming and going, brightly-clothed. As
 they glide around, their feet move, just a little, as though they were
 slowly treading water: not striding, not skating, not quite hovering
 either.

 Grand Solarium
 The Grand Solarium is an enormous dome with an oval roof of glass and
 grown metalwork. Inside is a botanical garden, which, on this planet,
 is a kind of art museum. Each plot displays some invented shrub that
 would be illegal on Earth.

 The southern end of the dome, where they grow edible crops, is hidden
 by a decorative screen of hanging flowers. The garden also continues to
 the east; away to the west is the front of the Earth Embassy, now your
 home.

 A double set of insulating doors leads north to the outdoors.

>examine garden
 Shrubs with fur. Shrubs with ears. Best not to think too hard about
 that.

 Flowers with all the color bred out, translucent buds clustered on grey
 vines. They separate you from the southern part of the dome.

 A heressa approaches the curtain. The air shimmers around her and her
 green gardening robe, and then the vines draw aside to let her through.

 You wander between plots: what catches your eye this time is a grass
 that grows silver and then dies off, leaving an intricate metal fence.

 Reflecting Pool
 You stand at the eastern end of a shallow rectangular pool -- no doubt
 part of the reason the air is softer and more humid here than it was
 outside. The Embassy is just west of here, at the far end of the pool.

 If you look down, you catch the reflection in the surface, and a number
 of small red fish swimming around, in formation, making symbols which
 you cannot read.

 You can't see any such thing.

 They have red-gold scales and fat round bodies, and are about two
 inches long. The formations are symbols from the syllabary, but you
 can't read them.


 Front Stairs
 The Embassy proper is directly west. The entrance is flanked by orange
 trees, familiar and earthly.

 From the top of the Front Stairs you have an excellent view of the
 whole interior of the Solarium, the sunlight catching in the curved
 triangular panes of glass.

 East, at the bottom of the stairs, is the mirror-glass of the pool.
 Beyond it the botanical garden has a structure invisible from the
 inside.

 The paths are a knot-work, the plots arranged to diversify shape and
 unify color. If you stare long enough, you even start to get the
 impression that the movement of the colonists through the garden is
 itself choreographed so that groups meet and pass each other at the
 nodes -- but it's impossible to be sure.

>xyzzy
 I didn't understand that sentence.


 Embassy Foyer
 Your first impression is of a large space, luxuriously built; of many
 textures of wood and metal and colored enamel; of four corner pillars
 with the shape and height of oak trunks. There is a staircase up, and
 some other exits north and west, which look more like things to
 investigate later.

 At the south end is a door to what looks like a private room.

 A young ayamet is waiting at the center of the room -- studiedly
 looking at something in his hand, trying to wait without seeming to do
 so. This will be Liam the assistant, then.

 He turns: his face is elfin and slightly furred. "Greetings,
 ambassador. Welcome to Aleheart."  His English is oddly accentuated,
 almost sung. He does not extend a hand, but you would not have expected
 him to touch you: some things are too much a taboo to overcome, even in
 deference to Earth manners.

 "You've just been meeting Ambassador Valenti, I think?" he adds. "I
 hope it was a productive encounter. You must have had questions for
 him."

 The smile is so bland. This might be a dart at your inexperience, or at
 Valenti for being naturally unhelpful. Or it might be nothing at all.
 But the grey widget trembles eagerly in your hand. It catches Liam's
 eye, and his expression grows, if anything, blander still.

 Mentally you check off "show up at the Embassy" on your list of
 remaining tasks. You run over the things you still need to get done
 before you can settle in:
   check your messages

 This is awkward.

 Your assignment was sudden, and you have only the phrases you learned
 on the voyage by skulking outside the engine room. You are therefore
 restricted to a) insulting your listener's parentage, diet, and sexual
 practices, or b) suggesting that he is damaged in the antigravitic
 propulsion unit.

 It would be dangerous to let on that Earth sent a diplomat who doesn't
 even know the language, so it is best to rely on gestures and silence
 until you can (quickly!) finish a linguistic hypnosis program.

 Liam looks at it and then at you. He says something, which naturally is
 meaningless. Then he makes a gesture of hiding something in his sleeve.
 So maybe you're not supposed to be showing it off...?

 It would be nice if you'd been properly trained for this assignment,
 instead of half-trained for the position of your own assistant. It
 would be nice if Valenti weren't using you in some power play. And it
 would be nice if you could work, privately, in your office for a while
 until you'd had a chance to figure out the situation here. But that's
 looking less and less likely.

 A plain grey device, fitted to the shape of the hand,  on whose surface
 are three constantly flickering numbers: SOC 15.26018, POW 20.26726,
 INT 11.14011. SQUEEZE TO SUMMON AIDES.  There is an inscription on the
 back, and it is in English: To LV from A3205.

 You are carrying:
   a grey widget saying SOC 15.99781, POW 20.45966, INT 11.3811
   a comfortable outfit of chronometer, grey undersuit, shoes, and socks

>insult liam's parentage
 I only understood you as far as wanting to insult Liam's clothing.

>insult me
 With concentration, you manage a tolerably accurate rendition of the
 chief engineer's favorite insult, complete with pitch and accent. A
 strange look crosses yourself's face; then open laughter.

 Evidently you got it wrong.

>squeeze stone
 The surface has a give to it, and it squeaks once. Liam winces and puts
 a finger to his temple. Summoning him at short range is possibly a
 little unfair.

 You approach the door; Liam watches you uncomfortably and speaks a few
 hesitant words of his own language. The phrase is unclear but the
 meaning is not: he is embarrassed to stop you, but he very much does
 not want you to go in there; it would be inappropriate. Probably this
 is his own private room, in fact.


 Hall
 At the top of the shallow stairs there is a spacious landing, with
 windows giving a view east across the Grand Solarium garden. Apparently
 past ambassadors have found this a pleasant place in which to read,
 because there is a small library of Earth books, otherwise impossible
 to get here.

 The entry to your bedroom is to the north, and an office area to the
 south.

 Liam follows you upstairs, floating without any apparent motion of the
 legs even on the incline. "This floor is the Earth Ambassador's," he
 says, as you reach the top. "The office--" and he points to the south
 door. "And the personal quarters." He indicates the north. "I believe
 Valenti left some clothing behind." He looks you up and down as though
 trying to guess whether it would fit you. "I do not know whether you
 will have a use for it, but I am sure that no one else will, so
 please..."

 This speech is halting enough to suggest that he memorized all these
 remarks.


 Office
 You take in perfunctorily the Earthish surroundings: two paintings, a
 plain floor, a shipment crate that probably arrived on the same vessel
 as your own.

 Valenti has of course left you his handheld computer -- useful, though
 not able to send and receive messages. The secure mail line must be in
 the next room, off to the west.

 Liam is out of sight, though you can presumably summon him back at
 need, or find him again.

 Taken.

 The computer is portable, and is able to scan and interpret the meaning
 of the colonists' symbolic writing. It has also been programmed to
 respond to search terms, to sift through data files and the personal
 logs of the ambassadors before you, assuming all the relevant disks are
 loaded. At the moment the slot for adding an extra data disk is empty,
 which looks ominous.


 Communications Room
 With all the machinery in here, the space remaining for you is little
 larger than a closet, except that the room extends upward a good
 fifteen or so feet, widening at the top into a bell of tinted glass.

 The comm terminal itself could be an invention out of Jules Verne. The
 keypad is arranged in the standard way, except that all the keys are
 slightly too small for the fingers of a normal human, and the pad
 itself stands up from the floor on a metal stalk.

 The comm screen, meanwhile, is round and surrounded by a copper ring,
 porthole-like. The whole arrangement is aesthetically pleasing and
 completely inconvenient.

 You key in your pass-code to activate the terminal.

 The following messages are available for you to read or reply to:

 11:21 am: Instructions
 10:02 am: Hello From Ivory Coast
 9:34 am: Shuttle Departure Plans

 You select the message and read:

 Greetings, ambassador. Sorry for the sudden change of plan. One day
 I'll tell you the whole story with Valenti, it'd be a good read. For
 now, you've got to do the Gift Day ritual, which means receiving their
 ambassador and handing over a present. There are two main points here
 -- what you give her and what you wear. Get the gift box that we
 shipped. It should have come in a crate, on the same ship as you.
 You're going to want to give them a vaccine sample; there should be one
 among Earth artifacts in our Museum in the Embassy.

 Wear something red and keep the rest of your clothes (if any) neutral.
 Black and white are also meaningful to them, so avoid those. Grey is
 fine.

 If you can get a float unit, get one: you'll want it for the meeting,
 so you can be as tall as the others.

 That's it. Don't give offense, don't look weak, and remember that they
 need us. -- Kruger.

 Mentally you check off "check your messages" on your list of remaining
 tasks. You run over the things you still need to get done:
   acquire a gift box from the goods shipped
   acquire vaccine from the Museum (HC's orders)
   prepare gift for Ambassador Aylene
   wear something red(dish) (High Command's instruction)
   find a working float unit

 Seeing this message makes you almost too impatient to read it.

 Your situation with Jane is odd. She is not much older than yourself,
 but prematurely grey, with mannish features. Her braying laugh is a
 liability in quiet restaurants. But she is smart and dependable, and
 sensitive to the times when you're best left alone. In the past year
 you've rarely been out of message contact for more than a week, and
 during the voyage over you missed her correspondence intensely.

 You were beginning to wonder about your feelings toward her -- a
 worrying idea that can be put aside now. She would probably be as
 appalled by the thought as you are.

 You select the message and read:

 Trust you're settled into UNDESERVED post with minimum fuss/maximum
 floating handmaidens. Wish I were there. Ivory Coast still rustic.
 Marsh risen two feet in floods. Cannot leave research post. Cannot buy
 liquor. Cannot reach you on transport ship. About to kill self from
 tedium and bug bites. Write at once. Jane.

 You select the message and read:

 Ship scheduled for departure 9:30 PM -- pls advise if any further
 shuttle contact is needed before that time.

 You try to rest your hands on the odd keypad and type normally, but the
 keys are too small for that to feel right, and the keypad bounces on
 its stupid metal stalk with every stroke. Eventually you settle on a
 vicious two-fingered approach.

 Dear Jane,

 Arrived to news Kruger assigning me as Valenti's replacement rather
 than assistant. Understood mystery when I met Valenti, who has less
 diplomatic skill than bowl of chopped liver.

 Am thus ambassador without language training. Would be content to
 switch places, if you wish. No liquor here, nor any floating
 handmaidens either. Understand through channels that I will be living
 on diet of tan ration bars fabricated in vat. Disgusting.

>q
>y
 You fire it off. Soon she will write back, and be sane and not related
 to all of this mess.

 The comm screen, meanwhile, is round and surrounded by a copper ring,
 porthole-like. The whole arrangement is aesthetically pleasing and
 completely inconvenient.


 Office
 Adjusted by your predecessors, and more like an Earth room than any
 other you've seen here. There are two paintings, a serious tax on
 someone's luggage limit. There is a plain floor that doesn't assume you
 can hover in midair. The foyer is back out to the north, and there's a
 child-sized Communications Room west of here.

 A crate, marked with shipping and import seals from Earth, sits in the
 middle of the room. It is still sealed.

 It is scuffed from its time in the cargo bay, but otherwise
 uncompromised.

 You open the shipment crate, revealing a quantity of packing material,
 a mail packet, and a gift box.

 gift box: Taken.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine packet
 It's mail meant for Valenti.

 You read it anyway.

 Unsurprisingly, there's nothing to hint at close ties back on Earth.
 But there are a number of demands from people who wanted Valenti to
 research what happened to some family member who came over in the
 colony ships. Apparently these people don't understand how much time
 has passed in Aleheart terms. One or two even threaten to sue the
 Aleheart Colony at large for damages for "illegal exploitation of
 genetic material" from their relatives -- a claim viable only on Earth,
 and only where High Command has something to say about it.

 A decorative box, obviously made on Earth, enameled like a Faberge
 piece. The exterior is covered in a design of leaves and morning
 glories.

 You tilt open the lid of the gift box, but it's tantalizingly empty.

 Soft and tightly-wadded.

>eat it
 (first taking the quantity of packing material)
 It would leave little fuzzy bits everywhere. You've done enough.

 They are not restful paintings, and look as though they were created by
 Van Gogh's angrier, more demented relation. As near as you can tell,
 one is of a circus performer about to fall off his unicycle, and the
 other is an extremely severe rainstorm. But still.

 Everything is on a smaller scale in the private quarters. There's no
 real bed, only a stone platform, too short to accommodate your full
 height, in the center of the room. The sole gesture towards comfort is
 a pillow of Earth style, perhaps left here by Valenti. A rich person's
 bedroom. People who paid for space would tuck the bed against the wall,
 and not let it waste the whole room.

 A refreshment room is visible to the west, and the hallway is back to
 the south.

 Your suitcase sits on the floor.

 You open the suitcase and experience a sudden deflation. There used to
 be a dozen new undersuits in different colors (or shades of grey,
 anyway); two carefully pressed jackets; hats and gloves for the cold
 climate; a parka; another pair of shoes.

 Now there're only few things, and one of them is a yellow paper, the
 kind you get when it's made of multiply-recycled fibers. Someone has
 written on it by hand. The letters have sunk in and blurred, but
 they're still legible.

 DUE TO MASS LIMITATIONS ON THIS TRIP ITEMS DEEMED TO BE OF LESSER VALUE
 OR PERSONAL SIGNIFICANCE WERE RECYCLED TO EARTHBOUND CHARITY. HAVE A
 NICE TRIP! DOCKWORKER 175.

 Which is funny, because with labor shortages you wouldn't have guessed
 there were a whole 175 people working at the space dock.

 Out of all you couldn't bear to give away when you left Earth -- the
 Bach cello suites recorded by your great-grandfather, seven years of
 your parents' love letters while your father died in quarantine, your
 school medal for life-saving action -- here's what they deemed to be of
 personal significance: a yellow paper note, some fuzzy bunny slippers,
 and a silver kiddush cup.

>examine slippers
 They have rabbit ears and are a collector's item from before the plague
 years. They are also pink. Your friend Jane gave them to you, motivated
 by inscrutable Jane-like humor; they still bear the stamp of Salvage
 and Reclamation on the soles.  Presumably your felonious dockworker
 recognized their worth and decided it was better not to steal them, but
 under the circumstances you'd rather have some of the clothing you
 actually intended to wear.

 It occurs to you that you left your old black sweater aboard the
 shuttle. Irritating.

 Your mother's silver kiddush cup. Most likely the only reason you got
 to keep it is the Star of David on the base, alerting the dockworker to
 its significance.

 Much of your time, the last days before departure, was spent getting
 rid of things. Jane helped, though no longer officially employed by
 Salvage and Reclamation. ("If you don't want to take the slippers with
 you, I won't be offended," she said, standing over a cardboard box,
 hands on hips. "It was just a present for fun." But you insisted on
 keeping them.)

 Getting rid of Katie: you hadn't been dating long, and neither of you
 pretended to consider maintaining a relationship at long distance.
 "It's been nice getting to know you, David," she said, before she hung
 up.

 Getting rid of obligations: you will not be home when your mother's
 yahrzeit comes around, and there is no one else. You have no brothers
 and no sisters. You had to look up the right words online; went to her
 grave with a flimsy print-off, and sang the Kaddish in a thin rain,
 though no one was listening to your prayers but a groundskeeper in a
 flap-eared hat. He watched with his arms folded from the next plot.
 When you were two-thirds through, he snorted and went away.

 So you still have the cup, at least. But you rarely use it, and what
 would it mean to do so here? Your music would have been more use.

 Bedroom
 There's no real bed, only a stone platform, too short to accommodate
 your full height, in the center of the room. The sole gesture towards
 comfort is a pillow of Earth style, perhaps left here by Valenti. Aside
 from this, the place is unfurnished.

 A refreshment room is visible to the west, and the hallway is back to
 the south.

 Your suitcase lies open on the floor, displaying a yellow paper note,
 some fuzzy bunny slippers, and a silver kiddush cup.

 It is deep red stone, decorated with bands of small colorful tiles.
 There's no attempt to accommodate a body either human or otherwise. And
 no sheets or blankets, which is discouraging.


 Refreshment Room
 Divided into several sections for hygienic purposes. To one side are
 the toilet facilities; on the other side, the food cabinet. Eating is
 considered a disgusting bodily function, here: something to be done out
 of sight and only when necessary.

 A long scarlet robe in the native style hangs from a clothing stand.

 Slightly raised from the floor by the door is a round grate, evidently
 the output vent for something-or-other.

 The purpose of clothes here is to keep a person warm while disguising
 as much as possible the presence of a solid body. They're made of light
 but tightly-woven material, generously cut, and studded with floatpins,
 allowing the cloth to hover, drift, and swirl perpetually without
 coming into indecent contact with the flesh.

 The robe is designed to drape from the shoulders, with several shorter
 layers of floatpinned cape at the back. It must billow magnificently
 when a person walks, and double as a sail in a strong wind.

>examine grate
 A pipe comes up an inch or two from the floor and, like a trunk sawn
 off near the ground, ends in a round brass-colored grating about nine
 inches in diameter. The only reasonable thing for it to be in this
 climate is a heating outlet. It is ideally placed for stubbing the toes
 of sensitive, non-floating Earth feet, so you'll have to keep an eye
 out when you go by.

>open it
 The grate is secured in place.

 You open the food cabinet, revealing a squashed unripe seed and some
 ration bars.

>examine seed
 Once upon a time, this appears to have been a partially ripe seed or
 fruit. The skin is streaked in orange and green, like an unready
 tomato. Then someone squashed it, and now it's gooey and possibly
 fermenting.

>examine bar
 High Command provided example ration bars to show the locals what
 nutrition was required. Apparently they took these instructions
 literally, and now all Embassy food comes in tasteless tan squares.

 Taken.

 You pick up the seed by the least drippy part.

 Hall
 At the top of the shallow stairs there is a spacious landing, with
 windows giving a view east across the Grand Solarium garden. Apparently
 past ambassadors have found this a pleasant place in which to read,
 because there is a small library of Earth books, otherwise impossible
 to get here.

 The other interesting item is a chute in the wall, looking (like
 everything else here) as though it had grown as metal or bone into the
 wall.

 The entry to your bedroom is to the north, and an office area to the
 south.

>examine chute
 It leads down into darkness, possibly meant for laundry or garbage,
 possibly for something else.

>go south

 Office
 Adjusted by your predecessors, and more like an Earth room than any
 other you've seen here. There are two paintings, a serious tax on
 someone's luggage limit. There is a plain floor that doesn't assume you
 can hover in midair. The foyer is back out to the north, and there's a
 child-sized Communications Room west of here.

 A crate, marked with shipping and import seals from Earth, sits in the
 middle of the room. It has been broken open.

>go west

 Communications Room
 With all the machinery in here, the space remaining for you is little
 larger than a closet, except that the room extends upward a good
 fifteen or so feet, widening at the top into a bell of tinted glass.

 The comm terminal itself could be an invention out of Jules Verne. The
 keypad is arranged in the standard way, except that all the keys are
 slightly too small for the fingers of a normal human, and the pad
 itself stands up from the floor on a metal stalk.

 The comm screen, meanwhile, is round and surrounded by a copper ring,
 porthole-like. The whole arrangement is aesthetically pleasing and
 completely inconvenient.

 Sorry to hear about Valenti. Sounds bad. Congrats on the promotion,
 though.

 To point: rumors say High Command has issued orders for you to
 negotiate, colonists are returning, will be given Africa under terms.
 You MUST NOT DO THAT. Human population gone, rain forest beginning to
 recover. Better than expected. Gene-splicers would ruin it. If they
 want a laboratory, let them stay there, fix existing planet. Was a
 reason they went away in the first place. Survived plague without them
 (sort of), don't need them now. Unless they can RESURRECT dead, it
 won't do any good.

 Didn't think so.

 That is all. Return to delicious ration bar, ruminate. Jane.

>taste bar
 You chew and chew and with difficulty swallow a small corner thereof,
 which will now probably keep you nourished until next month.

 Somewhere on this planet there is probably something worth eating, but
 you could no more ask for details than you could inquire into favorite
 forms of contraception.

 You run over the things you still need to get done:
   acquire vaccine from the Museum (HC's orders)
   prepare gift for Ambassador Aylene
   wear something red(dish) (High Command's instruction)
   find a working float unit

 You settle the robe around your shoulders, where it is much lighter
 than it has any right to be considering the amount of material. Still,
 it lends you a sense of authority, of moral weight.

 Or possibly makes you look like Little Red Riding Hood.

 Mentally you check off "wear something red(dish) (High Command's
 instruction)" on your list of remaining tasks. You run over the things

 You put the cup into the box -- luckily it is just short enough to fit,
 though it rolls back and forth slightly inside.

 A flash of memory: Your mother is sitting up in bed. "Your father
 wanted another child," she says to you abruptly. "But I told him, no.
 If we had another, we couldn't afford to send both to a quarantined
 school. One, we could afford to keep safe. Two would both be in danger
 and might both die."

 "Mother, you shouldn't have--"

 "Of course," she says, with the dry little chuckle of her last days. "I
 thought you would grow up to have Jewish sons and daughters, later,
 when it was safe. I thought the number of my grandchildren would make
 up for the number of my children."

 There is nothing to say. Coming out of the room, you run smack into
 Jane. "That was completely unfair," she whispers to you. "You shouldn't
 let her make you feel--"

 "You were listening?" you say.

 "I was in the hall and overheard part and it didn't seem like the right
 time to walk in," Jane answers, putting something cold into your hand.
 "I brought you more pain meds."

 "I know you get curious, but don't ever listen at the door again," you
 say.

 The blood creeps up her cheek. "It was hard to avoid hearing," she
 says, which is probably a legitimate point. You look down at the
 bottles and say nothing.

 My dear unfortunate successor:

 Possibly Kruger didn't tell you the importance of Gift Day. What you
 offer shows our intentions towards the colony. To date, Earth has made
 inappropriate or deceptive gestures thirteen times. They do employment
 here by running vote, and Ambassador Aylene is about to be removed
 because she hasn't gotten a good result out of us. You guess whose
 fault that is.

 Fate of negotiations is now in your hands. Ultimate responsibility:
 yours. Kruger can't control what you do from Earth.

 He's probably told you to wear red. This is a mistake: it would allow
 the colonists to come to Earth as our adoptees and put us in a position
 of power over them. This is neither morally nor pragmatically
 defensible.

 Recommend that you wear white -- it is a color associated with
 equality. I have a white jacket; it's possible Liam has taken it away,
 in which case you should get it back from him. I threw out the receipt,
 but it may still be in the recycling chute, if that helps communicate
 your needs.

 Do not know what Kruger will have told you to give in the gift box, but
 if you haven't already done so, recommend you look up "gifts" in the
 computer. It has an etiquette guide. This should give some idea what
 he's getting you into.

 When you are ready to present your gift, summon Liam and show him the
 gift box. He will arrange the meeting for you.

 Yours in haste, Valenti

 Mentally you check off "check your messages again" on your list of

   meet with Ambassador Aylene to present your gift

 Dear Honored Former Ambassador Valenti,

 Thank you very much for your valuable advice. It is, of course,
 somewhat unlikely that I will disobey orders merely on the basis of
 your uncertain instructions. If you had tried more persuasion and less
 condescension, I might be more inclined to listen.
 Yours, etc...

 An illustrated cookbook, useless here except as an object of fantasy. A
 few volumes in Japanese: you can't read them, but at least they're a
 familiar kind of foreign. A custom-printed poetry anthology.

 You expect possibly a collection of lyrics from popular hits, but the
 names come up Donne, Hopkins, Christopher Smart. It is all religious,
 imagery of divinity and the soul's subordination, and very alien. The
 plague years brought in plenty of reactionary movements, plenty of
 scourging and prayer, but they didn't look like this.

 You turn on the computer. It starts up a screen inviting you to look up
 some search term of your choosing.

 You key in your request and wait hopefully...

 Your search turns up the following articles:

 Gift day: Three times per local year you are expected to exchange gifts
 with a representative of the Aleheart government.  These days are keyed
 to the anniversary of first Earth contact and are not celebrated by the
 rest of the population in general.

 gift symbolism: draft proposal: According to the etiquette files, those
 proposing marriage or cooperative scientific ventures may do so by
 creating a sample of the kind of project they hope to undertake. In the
 case of marriage, these are usually representations of the offspring
 that might be engineered from the two parents; for purely business
 relationships, other kinds of model, sample, or technical proposal are
 appropriate. A superior looking to employ or adopt an inferior may give
 a sample of the kind of work the inferior will be expected to produce
 as a condition of the employment.

 gift symbolism: personal token: Etiquette files reveal that an object
 personally significant to the giver is an appropriate gift when
 establishing a relationship of friendship in which no joint work or
 project is intended. Also sometimes used for marriages not intended to
 produce offspring.

 gift symbolism: knife: Apparently, according to the etiquette files,
 any edged instrument is a symbol of restrictions, living under strict
 controls imposed by someone else, and dating back to clinical trials in
 which new genetic lines deemed to be failing their intended purpose
 were slaughtered with a knife. This practice is now called flushing and
 does not require a blade, but the associations remain.

 Aleheart eating habits, since this eating apparently takes place
 entirely in private.

 The computer is portable, and is able to scan and interpret the meaning
 of the colonists' symbolic writing. It has also been programmed to
 respond to search terms, to sift through data files and the personal
 logs of the ambassadors before you, assuming all the relevant disks are
 loaded. At the moment the slot for adding an extra data disk is empty,

 Embassy Foyer
 Like most buildings here, the Embassy is built with an eye for organic
 color and form: windows and doorways framed with curved ironwork,
 accents of bright enamel, wooden floors grown in place. All
 conspicuously wasteful of both materials and labor. It might be
 intended to make Earth representatives uncomfortable, or it might be
 meant as an honor, or it might be an advertisement for a standard of
 living that Earth lost some time ago. Too hard to tell.

 There's a large Receiving Room to the west. Less prominent rooms lie
 north and south -- the south with a locked private door, the north an
 archway. Shallow stairs, almost a ramp, rise to a second story.


 Museum
 The Museum is a presentation on Earth -- geography, culture, and
 everything else. The selection is idiosyncratic, but apparently
 compelling, to judge by the healthy crowd currently looking it over.

 To one side there is a ramp leading down. The studious way the crowd
 ignores this ramp suggests that they consider it private space.

 A map of Earth covers the east wall, so large that you can barely reach
 across South America with both arms outstretched. It has attracted
 several groups of interested visitors, who are pointing out to each
 other details of the topography of Mongolia and making excited gestures
 at the Sahara.

 There is a display case in the middle of the room.

 There's a most peculiar noise, like TOK TOK TOK TOK TOK, coming from
 all around. You eventually work out that it's a clicking or clucking
 they're making with their mouths because, what, you have food in
 public? A few of these fine folks should ride a subway one day. Ideally
 the Manhattan/Brooklyn train nicknamed Charnel Line.

 A detailed geographical map which omits political boundaries of any
 kind. While High Command doesn't lie about the political situation, it
 tends towards discretion -- as Kruger puts it, "You don't talk about
 ex-girlfriends on the first date."

 Designed for a viewer with an Earth-average eye level, which is to say,
 several inches lower than is ideal. It contains only a pink card.

 The display case isn't open.

 The pink card appears to say cure/serum fatal-sickness primitive
 borrowed -- research center room 58 -- card-that-grants-access.

 With a great deal of luck, that will mean that you can go to this
 research facility and collect the vaccine without too much hassle. That
 is, assuming Colonist scientists are less fussy about interrupting
 their experiments than the Earth scientists you've met.


 Basement
 Unlike the upper levels of the Embassy, the basement is built for
 practical purposes, and resembles the inside of a concrete cigar box.
 It continues to the south, dimly lit and cold.

 Along the west wall, a chute from above empties into a large metal
 container.

 You push up the lid to reveal a receipt and a data disk. Well, well,
 well. Valenti may have been a criminal and an ass, but at least he was
 incompetent.

 Very interesting.

 You put the data disk into the spare data slot.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 --: Valenti's data disk contains a variety of data entries, article
 annotations, translations of this and that, etc., and is more easily
 approached by trying to extract a single topic of information than by
 straight reading.  Hence the need to look things up.

 Your search turns up the following articles:

 Gift day: Three times per local year you are expected to exchange gifts
 with a representative of the Aleheart government.  These days are keyed
 to the anniversary of first Earth contact and are not celebrated by the
 rest of the population in general.

 gift symbolism: draft proposal: According to the etiquette files, those
 proposing marriage or cooperative scientific ventures may do so by
 creating a sample of the kind of project they hope to undertake. In the
 case of marriage, these are usually representations of the offspring
 that might be engineered from the two parents; for purely business
 relationships, other kinds of model, sample, or technical proposal are
 appropriate. A superior looking to employ or adopt an inferior may give
 a sample of the kind of work the inferior will be expected to produce
 as a condition of the employment.

 gift symbolism: personal token: Etiquette files reveal that an object
 personally significant to the giver is an appropriate gift when
 establishing a relationship of friendship in which no joint work or
 project is intended. Also sometimes used for marriages not intended to
 produce offspring.

 gift symbolism: knife: Apparently, according to the etiquette files,
 any edged instrument is a symbol of restrictions, living under strict
 controls imposed by someone else, and dating back to clinical trials in
 which new genetic lines deemed to be failing their intended purpose
 were slaughtered with a knife. This practice is now called flushing and
 does not require a blade, but the associations remain.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 six months ago: ...Mealy-mouthed third-rate translation of a
 traditional courtship greeting.  Not sure whether High Command is so
 dumb that they don't know this, or so dumb that they don't tell their
 emissaries.  Not sure which would be dumber.  What do they think Gift
 Day is about? Hostess presents?

 Your search turns up the following articles:

 color symbolism: red: Red is the color of superior power, requiring
 relatively expensive dyes.  It is worn by parties offering conditional
 adoption.

 Conditional adoption: An agreement by which one party becomes
 responsible for the needs of another party, in exchange for some
 concessions -- usually part or all of that party's work.  Somewhere
 between hiring and slavery.  Usually offered with red clothing and a
 token of the sort of work required.  Cannot seriously be offered by
 someone without the credible appearance of power, however.

 There isn't any personal data available from logs or annotations.

 Your search turns up the following articles:

 color symbolism: white: White is the color of balance, being the color
 of the rings in summer sky.  It is worn to offer marriage, equitable
 business, or cohabitation in shared house under non-hierarchical terms.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 15 days ago: Got suited for white jacket today for wedding proposal.
 Not quite sure what the tailor thought. Charged it to personal funds
 since do not want it on HC bill.

 color symbolism: black: The color of termination, worn to refuse an
 agreement; to propose corporate splits or divorce.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 six months ago: Aylene gave me a live rock! Which, in theory,
 calculates what everyone thinks of me, to many decimal places of
 accuracy (!).  Don't think she realized what negative reinforcement
 this would be. Can't help experimenting with ways to make numbers go up
 and down.  Bet I could crash all three to zero if I ran through the
 Solarium bareassed.  Apparently the thing corresponds to a portion of
 the alien brain. I admit (if only to myself) that I find the concept
 disgusting. But I admit a lot to myself lately. I gather my predecessor
 talked to herself as well.  I need some recordings of human speech or
 may go insane...

 three months ago: I tried asking her whether she can factor in my
 thoughts the same way her little live rock tracks everyone else's. She
 said no, I don't broadcast. She looked tremendously uncomfortable. I
 cannot say how smug this makes me.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 eight months ago: Met my counterpart, the ambassador Aylene, today.
 Frankly, High Command should have left Yamashita here -- they probably
 did wonderfully having tea parties together and comparing fashion
 notes. Have never met another human -- no, strike that, because she
 isn't human. Have never met any person with so little emotional affect
 in speech and behavior. Not sure what gene modifications they made to
 her, but it is frightening.

 five months ago: Coming to terms with the bowing. When Aylene bows,
 when she smiles, when she says polite formulas, the etiquette system
 doesn't seem stupid.  She's not bowing to show how well-bred she is.
 It's a liturgy of respect.  You bow to show that you respect someone
 but also to remind yourself of this fact. Sincerity can work inward as
 well as outward. You don't have to like someone to treat them well. If
 you practice this sometimes leads to liking.

 Then again, sometimes not.

 five weeks ago: Is it possible that Liam is jealous of me because of
 Aylene? I find him lurking around after she's been here, looking sniffy
 and grim. Naturally Aylene's live rock doesn't offer any sort of data
 analysis function. That might be dangerously useful.

 four weeks ago: Another long, long talk with Aylene.  She may be coming
 around on the cohabitation idea, of shared resources and an integrated
 society.  But there are concessions involved on both sides, and she is
 more afraid of her people than I am of mine.  There's no way they're
 going to be able to live on Earth and preserve their daintiness about
 eating, for instance.  Which in my opinion would be no bad thing, but
 one can hardly say that...

 28 days ago: Naturally after I read that I asked Aylene about it (if
 we're modeling our alliance on a marriage I'd rather not have
 "marriage" mean "eugenics program"). She says in practice there's
 hardly any "flushing".  I still have some serious questions about this,
 but I think inasmuch as it applies to the current occasion we're
 looking rather at a joint stewardship of the resources available to
 both planets.  HC should be able to live with that.  I don't know
 whether the general population would be so enthusiastic, but the
 general population seems to think it's a point of principle not to make
 any concessions or in fact live in the real world in any way.

 25 days ago: And, well, the personal component of all this.  I very
 nearly put it to Aylene as an offer based on symbolism and political
 expediency.  She would have understood that, but... I would like to
 marry her, in truth, and not simply as a means to an end.  She was
 silent after I raised the possibility.  I think I went about it wrong,
 but it's damned difficult to know what "right" looks like here.  How
 the hell would I know?

 24 days ago: She won't talk to me today.

 23 days ago: They voted her out. I cannot believe they voted her out.
 What kind of employment system is that, anyway?

 5 days ago: News from Kruger: I am out. No explanation. Replacement
 already en route. Pack bags, prepare to leave. Can't bring myself to
 contact Aylene.

 Basement
 Unlike the upper levels of the Embassy, the basement is built for
 practical purposes, and resembles the inside of a concrete cigar box.
 It continues to the south, dimly lit and cold.

 Along the west wall, a chute from above empties into a large metal
 container.


 Museum
 The Museum is a presentation on Earth -- geography, culture, and
 everything else. The selection is idiosyncratic, but apparently
 compelling, to judge by the healthy crowd currently looking it over.

 To one side there is a ramp leading down. The studious way the crowd
 ignores this ramp suggests that they consider it private space.

 A map of Earth covers the east wall, so large that you can barely reach
 across South America with both arms outstretched. It has attracted
 several groups of interested visitors, who are pointing out to each
 other details of the topography of Mongolia and making excited gestures
 at the Sahara.

 There is a display case in the middle of the room.


 Embassy Foyer
 Like most buildings here, the Embassy is built with an eye for organic
 color and form: windows and doorways framed with curved ironwork,
 accents of bright enamel, wooden floors grown in place. All
 conspicuously wasteful of both materials and labor. It might be
 intended to make Earth representatives uncomfortable, or it might be
 meant as an honor, or it might be an advertisement for a standard of
 living that Earth lost some time ago. Too hard to tell.

 There's a large Receiving Room to the west. Less prominent rooms lie
 north and south -- the south with a locked private door, the north an
 archway offering a mercifully limited view of the "Museum". Shallow
 stairs, almost a ramp, rise to a second story.

 The floor of the Receiving Room is decorated with broken glass. It's
 not conducive to strolling around without a float unit.

>time
 It is 1:31 pm -- here, anyhow.


 Front Stairs
 The Embassy proper is directly west. The entrance is flanked by orange
 trees, familiar and earthly.

 From the top of the Front Stairs you have an excellent view of the
 whole interior of the Solarium, the sunlight catching in the curved
 triangular panes of glass.

 East, at the bottom of the stairs, is the mirror-glass of the pool.
 Beyond it the botanical garden has a structure invisible from the
 inside.


 Reflecting Pool
 You stand at the western end of a shallow rectangular pool -- no doubt
 part of the reason the air is softer and more humid here than it was
 outside. The garden paths open at the east end of the pool; the Embassy
 is west, at your back.

 If you look down, you catch the reflection in the surface, and a number
 of small red fish swimming around, in formation, making symbols which
 you cannot read.

 You wander between plots: what catches your eye this time is a
 writing-desk-tree, spreading to a flat surface at about three feet.

 Grand Solarium
 The Grand Solarium is an enormous dome with an oval roof of glass and
 grown metalwork. Inside is a botanical garden, which, on this planet,
 is a kind of art museum. Each plot displays some invented shrub that
 would be illegal on Earth.

 The southern end of the dome, where they grow edible crops, is hidden
 by a decorative screen of hanging flowers. The garden also continues to
 the east; away to the west is the front of the Earth Embassy, now your
 home.

 A double set of insulating doors leads north to the outdoors.

 You head out of the Solarium and down a brief slope, into the clearing
 at the center of town.

 Clearing
 The street runs north/south, so that you have an uninterrupted view of
 Cordia Peak, and the leading edge of the glacier at the northern edge
 of town.

 Both sides of the street are built up. A substantial building of metal
 and glass lies to the east, houses to the west.

 The ring system is mostly obscured by the grand solarium to the south,
 accessible through the insulating doors. The solarium is a huge domed
 structure to keep in as much heat and warmth as possible; the Earth
 embassy is inside.

 At the center of the open space here is a monument shaped like a tusk
 or tooth.

 It has look of force-grown bone, monolithic and taller than a man.

 The symbolic lettering of the current language has been painted on the
 side, but the original carving is in Chinese and English: "To those
 who, in the name of the Company and for the advancement of knowledge,
 were killed, modified incorrectly, or born unfit."

 A repulsion field prevents you from entering the building without the
 proper security device.

 From here, you can go south (to grand solarium), east, or north (to the
 broad street).

 A double set of insulating doors leads north to the outdoors.

 You approach the curtain of vine; it draws away, then begins to repel
 you. Your face feels hot, as though sunburnt. You step away.

 Flowers with all the color bred out, translucent buds clustered on grey
 vines. They separate you from the southern part of the dome.

 You run over the things various people have decided you ought to do:
   give the jacket receipt to Liam
   acquire vaccine from the research facility (HC's orders)
   wear white jacket (Valenti's idea)
   find a working float unit
   summon Liam and show him the gift box
   meet with Ambassador Aylene to present your gift

 The surface has a give to it, and it squeaks once. Small regretful
 letters read: AIDE CURRENTLY OUT OF RANGE. Maybe in the embassy proper,
 then.

 You wander between plots: what catches your eye this time is a wispy
 groundcover exuding fog.

 Reflecting Pool
 You stand at the eastern end of a shallow rectangular pool -- no doubt
 part of the reason the air is softer and more humid here than it was
 outside. The Embassy is just west of here, at the far end of the pool.

 If you look down, you catch the reflection in the surface, and a number
 of small red fish swimming around, in formation, making symbols which
 you cannot read.

 The surface has a give to it, and it squeaks once. COMING, reads the
 skin lettering tersely.

 Liam slips through the locked barrier from the south.

 Liam takes the receipt numbly and looks at it, then back at you. "You
 are... seeking this apparel?" he asks. You nod curtly in a manner you
 hope suggests decisiveness rather than an inability to speak his
 language.

 The silence becomes uncomfortable. You realize after a moment what has
 changed: he is now floating at the same height as you, looking you in
 the eye directly. For some reason he is not at all pleased with this
 request.

 Mentally you check off "give the jacket receipt to Liam" on your list
 of remaining tasks. You run over the things various people have decided
 you ought to do:
   acquire vaccine from the research facility (HC's orders)
   wear white jacket (Valenti's idea)
   find a working float unit
   summon Liam and show him the gift box
   meet with Ambassador Aylene to present your gift

 A moment later -- more quickly than you expected -- he returns with the
 white jacket, and something else: a pale pink fruit. He puts the fruit
 into your hand firmly so that it is squeezed.

 It is one of those recording fruits into which information is put.

 The pink fruit hisses sparks and juice, but then it begins to play, a
 projection hovering in the middle of the air:

 Liam is standing in the foyer next to Aylene. The Ambassador has
 ordered a white jacket, he says.

 It is not a surprise.  Her hands are clasped in front of her, the
 sleeves almost covering them. We are discussing a treaty of
 cohabitation.

 Liam frowns. It pleases me that they admit they are wrong to exile us
 from Earth...

 But you prefer not to mix cultures, Aylene finishes.

 I would prefer that they beg us to return and we refuse.

 She smiles affectionately. Like an angry lover! But Valenti has not
 guessed how you felt toward him when he arrived here.


 Liam is entirely occupied with the recording he wants to show you, and
 you find you have a hard time looking away either.

 In the recording, Liam turns pink. Unlikely that he would guess any
 social thing that is not told to him three times in English! And I only
 admired -- he seemed to have energy, much purpose.

 He has.  Her own tone is wistful. But I know you, Liam. You are not
 unjust to the Earth folk because Valenti disappoints you. If the right
 thing is cohabitation, you judge the possibility fairly.

 What good will come of it? he asks. They are not-- The subtitling
 flickers here, flashing through a half-dozen words: social nice
 adjusted sane-minded obedient easily-understood.  They do not design
 new lines. They will probably forbid us designing ourselves.

 Aylene answers: In a year ice will break the dam and the Solarium wall.
 We will all take the train to Tanhua to be retired. We have few
 choices.

 It is one of those recording fruits into which information is put.

 The TY line are bred for winter survival. Fur, hibernation, slow
 metabolism.  He runs a finger over the fuzz on the backs of his wrists.

 I've followed your designer's experiments, Aylene says. They move too
 slowly.

 We wasted time on Earth compatibility, he replies, bitter. I commented
 this on design proposals, but everyone is mad with wanting to go Home.
 Earth songs sung again, the Sanctuary of Earth plants restored, people
 laugh with teeth showing. Does Valenti like the almost-humans? No, he
 takes no interest. And if we do not go to Earth, they are trouble --
 retrograde stock, badly socialized, expensive to feed.

 It is one of those recording fruits into which information is put.

 She turns to him abruptly. Be careful. When I am removed after Gift
 Day, you will be Ambassador.

 His mouth opens, but he recovers. Then let Earth also send a different
 speaker. Valenti has no respect for us. I cannot talk to him.

 He has no respect for groups, only individuals. You see the bad; there
 is also good. He does not expect us to sacrifice any lines of stock--

 If we go to Earth, the TY are useless. If we stay, the
 Earth-compatibles...

 She puts up a hand, hushing him. Valenti is at the door. His eyes go to
 Aylene; he moves towards her, barely sparing a glance for Liam, who
 smiles wryly.

 The recording flickers out.

 The images over, Liam seems to feel that you have seen whatever he
 wanted you to see, so he puts the white jacket you demanded over your
 arm.

 You are carrying:
   a puffy white jacket
   a pale pink fruit
   a silver kiddush cup
   some fuzzy bunny slippers
   a yellow paper note
   a mail packet
   an empty gift box
   a handheld computer (in which is a data disk)
   a grey widget saying SOC 13.08113, POW 20.7639, INT 11.61016
   a magnificent ensemble of flowing scarlet robe, chronometer, grey
 undersuit, shoes, and socks

 Liam waits for your instructions, though with a faint air of
 impatience.

 The jacket is loosely cut, as you would expect, with floatpins
 throughout. The cuffs have two narrow stripes of gold and red, like a
 uniform. It looks very fresh and crisp. Possibly Valenti never wore it,
 and that's why he didn't bother to keep it.  It looks as though you
 might be able to wear it, though you may look strange.

 Liam waits for your instructions, though with a faint air of
 impatience.

 They have rabbit ears and are a collector's item from before the plague
 years. They are also pink. Your friend Jane gave them to you, motivated
 by inscrutable Jane-like humor; they still bear the stamp of Salvage
 and Reclamation on the soles.  Presumably your felonious dockworker
 recognized their worth and decided it was better not to steal them, but
 under the circumstances you'd rather have some of the clothing you
 actually intended to wear.

 Liam slips through the locked barrier to the south.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 six months ago: Have been making progress with the translations of
 etiquette guide... much appears to center upon proposals of various
 kinds.  I have gathered the formal proposal system they're using on us
 is not (contrary to what they might say) a frequent feature of daily
 life for them either, but is rather some archaic bit of hazing they got
 out of mothballs.  As a test, maybe.  Or maybe because the symbols and
 terms of it are actually, God help us, simpler than communicating all
 the nuances in their language.

 seven weeks ago: Liam told me about the flint knife in the Earth
 Sanctuary. Turns out it wasn't brought by us (always thought that a
 really odd thing to send) but they brought it here from Earth
 themselves. There's some sort of gloomy symbolism there which, as
 usual, he couldn't bring himself to explain directly. A less useful
 assistant would be difficult to find.

 25 days ago: And, well, the personal component of all this.  I very
 nearly put it to Aylene as an offer based on symbolism and political
 expediency.  She would have understood that, but... I would like to
 marry her, in truth, and not simply as a means to an end.  She was
 silent after I raised the possibility.  I think I went about it wrong,
 but it's damned difficult to know what "right" looks like here.  How
 the hell would I know?

 They have red-gold scales and fat round bodies, and are about two
 inches long. The formations are symbols from the syllabary, but you
 can't read them.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the fish.

 With a computer, you can read the writing system here, but that is
 about all.

 You wander between plots: what catches your eye this time is a
 thorn-tree with black fruit smelling of oil.

 Grand Solarium
 The Grand Solarium is an enormous dome with an oval roof of glass and
 grown metalwork. Inside is a botanical garden, which, on this planet,
 is a kind of art museum. Each plot displays some invented shrub that
 would be illegal on Earth.

 The southern end of the dome, where they grow edible crops, is hidden
 by a decorative screen of hanging flowers. The garden also continues to

 You can't see any such thing.

 Which do you mean, the substantial building or the houses?

 Large enough to contain hundreds of apartment dwellings, or to provide
 considerable office space. There is a sign on the wall.

 Alien Bioengineering Facility.

 You walk along the crunching gravel for some time, noticing here and
 there a few gravel walkways off to the east and west, but nothing open
 to visitors. There are fewer Colonists at this end of town.

 Broad Street
 To the northwest is a public building with a deep portico; to the east,
 one with a conical roof. The others are private houses, but, except one
 or two, they don't look lived in. There is a general atmosphere of
 neglect.

 The street continues south into the heart of town, or north towards the
 mountain and the glacier. A track for a floating train cuts southeast
 between the buildings.

 The rings in the southern sky are partly obscured by the buildings on
 the horizon, but are still bright enough to catch the eye.

 The facade has been renovated, but the original walls of the building
 are old, made of blocks of cut stone brought down from the mountain a
 long time ago.


 Ruined Vineyard
 Once this was a kind of hothouse, but the glacier has knocked out
 loadbearing portions of the north wall. The roof is buckled at that end
 and gives a view of patchy sky; only a steel scaffold prevents it from
 falling in completely. Gusts of warm air from the wall vents quickly
 turn to cloud.

 A pamphlet lies discarded near kiosks that line the west wall. The bulk
 of the area, though, is full of plant lines, growing on frames as in a
 vineyard.

 The pamphlet appears to say Greetings noble companion. Welcome to data
 compression and storage tree! Designed by (long string of letters and
 numbers, constituting some colonist's unique personal identification).

 Data compression tree analyzes/presses recording and finds
 correspondences/similarities/relations to known/studied narrative/story
 structures! Content re-expressed as combination of known/studied
 structures! Output significantly more compact than original!

 SCIENTIFIC mode best suited for compacting very long meetings with
 scientific content into brief precis; STORY mode captures plot events;
 SOCIAL mode includes both dialogue and emotion-projection data. More
 advanced version of Data compression tree available for large projects

 (Output fruit has similar function to other recording fruits. Squeeze
 output fruit to display content!).

 Blond-wood cabinets just big enough for someone to stand inside and do
 something.

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 They're recordings: the fruits store data. Or they did. The skins are
 frosted over now.

 That's fixed in place.

 You pinch one of the fruits at random. A tiny woman appears in
 hologram, singing a soprano part. Her voice is staticky and broken. The
 flesh of the fruit is bruised from being pinched when it was
 half-frozen.


 Kiosk
 The kiosk is no larger than a contamination testing booth back on
 Earth. It briefly evokes the old fear that somehow, despite every
 reasonable precaution, this time you will turn out to be infected, and
 you'd have to tell your mother, and she would be so upset. That would
 be the worst thing: having to tell your mother.

 The only thing of note here is a metal box, mounted on the wall at
 about shoulder-height, with a bonzai-sized tree growing out of the top.

 (the tree machine)
 A machine titled DATA COMPRESSION AND STORAGE. There is a miniature
 tree growing out of the top, naked of foliage. On the front of the
 metal box are green and blue push-knobs, and a movable bronze pointer.

 On the left side of the machine there is a funnel, the right size for
 inserting a recording fruit.

 The four settings of the pointer are ORIGINAL, SCIENTIFIC, STORY,
 SOCIAL.

 The pointer is currently set to original.

 The blue knob appears to say PREVIEW.

 The green knob appears to say RECORD.

 The pale pink fruit rolls down inside the machine. There is a whirr
 like your mother's juicer on the first day of a new diet.

 The pointer turns with a heavy click. The selector now points to story.

 You can't see any such thing.

 The projection plays, bringing on stage Aylene and Liam in similar,
 bright-colored costumes.

 Aylene sings: I AM PLEASED TO TELL YOU I AM BEING WED.

 Liam: MY DEAR FRIEND, IT IS THE PUREST DELIGHT TO HEAR IT. WHO IS THE
 FORTUNATE GROOM?

 Aylene: IT IS VALENTI! THE HANDSOME AND MOST ADMIRABLE VALENTI! THE
 HONORABLE AND WELL-GROOMED VALENTI OF SUPERIOR GENETIC INHERITANCE!
 (And so on in this mode for some stanzas, endowing Valenti with such
 virtues as reinforced femurs and multiple rows of sharklike teeth.)

 Liam: THIS CANNOT BE!

 Aylene: WHY NOT?

 Liam: THIS CANNOT BE!

 Aylene: I ASK AGAIN: WHY NOT?

 Liam: HE WAS PROMISED TO ME! OH PERFIDIOUS WRETCHED MAN, OH WRETCHED
 LYING MAN, OH (etc. for a number of verses), AND WHAT IS MORE I WOULD
 BE DELIGHTED TO LIVE WITHOUT HIM, AND I WISH YOU JOY OF HIM, AND MAY
 YOU BOTH PERISH OF THE POX

 Then the compression system gave up, apparently, because the music
 splutters out and the antagonists stand glaring at one another, their
 sequined sleeves glittering in the faux light, until the projection
 stops.

 The pointer turns with a heavy click. The selector now points to
 scientific.

 The projection plays. Aylene and Liam are meeting in some sort of glass
 and steel boardroom. I have chosen a new collaborator, says the
 cartoonish scientist Aylene. It is your boss.

 Liam: I do not approve of his project idea. I was hoping you would
 prefer mine.

 Aylene: There are pragmatic reasons to favor his design.

 Liam: Drat.

 The pointer turns with a heavy click. The selector now points to
 social.

 The projection plays. Aylene and Liam stand shoulder to shoulder, not
 actually talking. How difficult this is, Aylene thinks, in squiggly
 symbols. I care for Valenti, and what is more I have no choice but to
 accept his proposals, whatever they might be. All the same, there are
 those who will be wounded by my decision, including Liam here. Though
 he is not appreciated by his employer, I have come to value his advice.

 Meanwhile Liam thinks: What a disappointment that Valenti has not
 proven to be a more decisive man, and to better effect! And alas that
 we do not make more progress in our experiments...

 Aylene, Liam, aloud together: It is a pity, since we are friends, that
 we take different sides of this matter.

 The pointer turns with a heavy click. The selector now points to story.

 You push the green knob in: it resists, proving the solidity of the
 machine.

 Nothing happens.

 Then a small flower blooms on the tree, hurrying in seconds through a
 spring and summer, until the petals drop away. It swells into a fruit
 the size of a kumquat.

 You can't see any such thing.

 Taken.

 There is a symbol reading STORY COMPRESSION on the skin of the kumquat.

 (heading east, since that is the only direction available)

 Ruined Vineyard
 Once this was a kind of hothouse, but the glacier has knocked out
 loadbearing portions of the north wall. The roof is buckled at that end
 and gives a view of patchy sky; only a steel scaffold prevents it from
 falling in completely. Gusts of warm air from the wall vents quickly
 turn to cloud.

 A pamphlet lies discarded near kiosks that line the west wall. The bulk
 of the area, though, is full of plant lines, growing on frames as in a
 vineyard.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You will have to be more specific about which direction you want to go.
 From here, you can head southeast and west.

 Broad Street
 To the northwest is a public building with a deep portico; to the east,
 one with a conical roof. The others are private houses, but, except one
 or two, they don't look lived in. There is a general atmosphere of
 neglect.

 The street continues south into the heart of town, or north towards the
 mountain and the glacier. A track for a floating train cuts southeast
 between the buildings.

 The rings in the southern sky are partly obscured by the buildings on
 the horizon, but are still bright enough to catch the eye.


 Meeting Chamber
 A grand, hexagonal room with a tiled floor of intricate design. Around
 the outside of the room runs a bench, divided by carving into seats --
 perhaps ten seats on a side -- and there is a label on each seat,
 except for a few blank ones left at the south-east side of the room.

 But it can't have been used for some time. The glass is knocked out of
 the windows, the tiles broken.

 The seating label appears to say A3 representative... TY
 representative... RA....

 Liam: All that's available is a brief dossier about Liam's former
 employment and job rankings, which are cryptic in format and convey
 almost nothing to you.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 seven months ago: God. Where to begin? Liam would not be assigned this
 -- as I discover -- extremely low-ranking position as my assistant if
 he had turned out to be good at any of the traditional skills, such as
 manufacturing birds that fly backwards, or engineering climatic
 disasters. He is sensitive, petty, and desperate for my approval, since
 only my approval will improve his rank and get him out of here. He has
 some good points, such as tolerance for boredom, but this is not enough
 to prevent me wanting to strangle him.

 seven weeks ago: Liam told me about the flint knife in the Earth
 Sanctuary. Turns out it wasn't brought by us (always thought that a
 really odd thing to send) but they brought it here from Earth
 themselves. There's some sort of gloomy symbolism there which, as
 usual, he couldn't bring himself to explain directly. A less useful
 assistant would be difficult to find.

 five weeks ago: Is it possible that Liam is jealous of me because of
 Aylene? I find him lurking around after she's been here, looking sniffy
 and grim. Naturally Aylene's live rock doesn't offer any sort of data
 analysis function. That might be dangerously useful.

 22 days ago: Fight with Liam. Not my finest hour. Sometimes am almost
 glad they're getting me out of here. Filched the recording, that not
 being something I want anyone else to have a copy of. And I used to
 have such high ideas about what diplomacy could be.

 two months ago: Funny sort of personal conversation with A. Turns out
 that she is descended from Peter and Charla herself -- the whole A line
 is. This is such a strange thought to me. Apparently they're among the
 most human-like of the remaining lines (though with certain obligatory
 modifications, of course), which I suppose is why she was assigned to
 deal with us.

 The rings in the southern sky are partly obscured by the buildings on

 The tracks run away between the houses, heading southeast towards
 southern settlements and eventually to Tanhua. They stop at the edge of
 Broad Street, so this must be the end of the line for any supplies or
 visitors being brought up from the south -- though presumably there is
 a larger station and a proper loading and unloading dock elsewhere.

 After a few minutes of walking, you reach an area with Colonists
 around. You carefully don't stare at them as they carefully do not
 stare at you. But from the sides of your eyes you watch how they float
 a few inches off the ground; how they do not touch things.

 Clearing
 The street runs north/south, so that you have an uninterrupted view of
 Cordia Peak, and the leading edge of the glacier at the northern edge
 of town.

 Both sides of the street are built up. A substantial building of metal
 and glass lies to the east, houses to the west.

 The ring system is mostly obscured by the grand solarium to the south,
 accessible through the insulating doors. The solarium is a huge domed
 structure to keep in as much heat and warmth as possible; the Earth
 embassy is inside.

 At the center of the open space here is a monument shaped like a tusk
 or tooth.


 Grand Solarium
 The Grand Solarium is an enormous dome with an oval roof of glass and
 grown metalwork. Inside is a botanical garden, which, on this planet,
 is a kind of art museum. Each plot displays some invented shrub that
 would be illegal on Earth.

 The southern end of the dome, where they grow edible crops, is hidden
 by a decorative screen of hanging flowers. The garden also continues to
 the east; away to the west is the front of the Earth Embassy, now your
 home.

 A double set of insulating doors leads north to the outdoors.


 Sanctuary
 This area is set aside from the rest of the Solarium by a stone wall.
 There are no engineered plants that you recognize, only green grass. It
 smells like the Chicago suburbs in August.

 At the center of the grass is a hexagonal stone dais large enough to
 elevate one person above the crowd.

 A few Colonists stand facing the center with the silent attitude of
 worshippers.

 It is carved. It's also old. Along one edge of the hexagon it reads (in
 English): "RIP Peter Long, Director of High-Risk Research".

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 four months ago: More research. My Charla seems to have been married to
 Peter Long. Wish I had a clearer idea of what Peter Long was up to.

 four months ago: So. Put together the archive files on Charla and her
 companion Peter Long here. I have what appear to be six versions of the
 same events, recorded in distinctly stylized and different forms --
 including what looks like an opera. (Or some perversion thereof.) I'd
 say they were literary reworkings but no, they seem actually to be a
 convention-based compression of some original, now-lost data recording.
 The weird thing is that they don't all end the same way -- apparently
 the conventions of recording are allowed to override, for instance,
 matters of fact.

 four months ago: Oh my. Cross-comparing the data and the compression
 algorithm information I could find I think I have worked my way to a
 fuzzy but more-accurate version of the original. Spent a good while in
 the archive building messing with the kiosks. Got to talk to A about
 this, find out if it is really true. If it is, we may end scuttling the
 whole treaty if I report what I found on Charla and Peter Long. Long is
 really the issue; it's just our bad bad bad bad bad luck that Charla's
 relatives are still alive and, worse, pushy about finding out what
 became of her.

 four months ago: Amazing it never occurred to me to wonder exactly what
 happened when they lost Earth contact here. Peter Long's solution seems
 obvious. In retrospect.

 three months ago: Long talk with A, and she essentially confirmed for
 me what I had already pieced together, though with some bits that I
 hadn't quite understood about Peter and Charla. And then I got rid of
 the recordings. The destruction of data, a slippery slope. This was
 much bigger than getting rid of Yamashita's correspondence disc but it
 felt less awful, somehow. This is something I cannot, cannot report
 back if I want these people saved. And increasingly I do. Even my
 infuriating assistant.

 deal with us.

 27 days ago: Went to the Earth Sanctuary and heard a few songs.
 Strangely moving. One of them was in fact about old Peter. Felt like it
 was the play to catch the conscience, etc., except of course in this
 case I'm not the murderer and it's everyone else's conscience that
 really ought to be bothered, not mine. It was a good song, though. They
 got out the flint knife at the end -- it's a prop of this performance,
 I gather.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 seven months ago: Huge wad of demands from Earth that I do research to
 find people's missing ancestors. In my spare time from carving out a
 treaty, I am to look for someone's great-aunt Charla.

 five months ago: More background research. Think I found the files on
 this Charla character, but they're very strange. All their historical
 data is preserved in severely lossy formats.

 four months ago: More research. My Charla seems to have been married to
 Peter Long. Wish I had a clearer idea of what Peter Long was up to.

 any edged instrument is a symbol of restrictions, living under strict
 controls imposed by someone else, and dating back to clinical trials in
 which new genetic lines deemed to be failing their intended purpose

 does not require a blade, but the associations remain.

 You're already in Sanctuary, so further directions are needless.

 Sanctuary

 smells like the Chicago suburbs in August.

 At the center of the grass is a hexagonal stone dais large enough to

 Quiet and thoughtful.

 From here, you can go west (to grand solarium).

 The Grand Solarium is an enormous dome with an oval roof of glass and
 grown metalwork. Inside is a botanical garden, which, on this planet,
 is a kind of art museum. Each plot displays some invented shrub that
 would be illegal on Earth.

 The southern end of the dome, where they grow edible crops, is hidden

 home.

 A double set of insulating doors leads north to the outdoors.

 The computer beeps irritably: NO RESULTS FOUND. PLEASE REPHRASE AND TRY

 You wander between plots: what catches your eye this time is vines
 growing tablet-like medicinal berries.

 Reflecting Pool
 You stand at the eastern end of a shallow rectangular pool -- no doubt
 part of the reason the air is softer and more humid here than it was
 outside. The Embassy is just west of here, at the far end of the pool.

 If you look down, you catch the reflection in the surface, and a number
 of small red fish swimming around, in formation, making symbols which
 you cannot read.

 From here, you can go west (to the front stairs) or east (to grand
 solarium).


 Front Stairs
 The Embassy proper is directly west. The entrance is flanked by orange
 trees, familiar and earthly.

 From the top of the Front Stairs you have an excellent view of the
 whole interior of the Solarium, the sunlight catching in the curved
 triangular panes of glass.

 East, at the bottom of the stairs, is the mirror-glass of the pool.
 Beyond it the botanical garden has a structure invisible from the
 inside.

 Short orange trees growing in tubs next to the staircase. They have
 glossy dark leaves and orange fruit.


 Embassy Foyer
 Like most buildings here, the Embassy is built with an eye for organic
 color and form: windows and doorways framed with curved ironwork,
 accents of bright enamel, wooden floors grown in place. All
 conspicuously wasteful of both materials and labor. It might be
 intended to make Earth representatives uncomfortable, or it might be
 meant as an honor, or it might be an advertisement for a standard of
 living that Earth lost some time ago. Too hard to tell.

 There's a large Receiving Room to the west. Less prominent rooms lie
 north and south -- the south with a locked private door, the north an
 archway offering a mercifully limited view of the "Museum". Shallow
 stairs, almost a ramp, rise to a second story.

 The floor of the Receiving Room is decorated with broken glass. It's
 not conducive to strolling around without a float unit.

 Your search turns up the following articles:

 Float technology and human adaptation: The article describes, with
 pictures, the float units built for humans who want to replicate the
 colonists' natural floating abilities. A supply of these were
 apparently built for the use of ambassadors and stored in the basement
 of the Embassy, since it was observed that humans tended to break them
 at a high rate.

 There isn't any personal data available from logs or annotations.

 From here, you can go south, east (to the front stairs), west, up (to
 the hall), or north (to the museum).


 Museum
 The Museum is a presentation on Earth -- geography, culture, and
 everything else. The selection is idiosyncratic, but apparently
 compelling, to judge by the healthy crowd currently looking it over.

 To one side there is a ramp leading down. The studious way the crowd
 ignores this ramp suggests that they consider it private space.

 A map of Earth covers the east wall, so large that you can barely reach
 across South America with both arms outstretched. It has attracted
 several groups of interested visitors, who are pointing out to each
 other details of the topography of Mongolia and making excited gestures
 at the Sahara.

 There is a display case in the middle of the room.


 Basement
 Unlike the upper levels of the Embassy, the basement is built for
 practical purposes, and resembles the inside of a concrete cigar box.
 It continues to the south, dimly lit and cold.

 Along the west wall, a chute from above empties into a large metal
 container.


 Utility Room
 Little more than a chilly concrete box. It continues some distance to
 the north.

 Something resembling the root system of Yggdrasil covers the south
 wall; from close up it appears to be a complex heating system with
 pipes and tubes.

 A personal float unit hovers three inches off the floor at the middle
 of the room.

 Mentally you check off "find a working float unit" on your list of
 remaining tasks. You run over the things various people have decided
 you ought to do:
   acquire vaccine from the research facility (HC's orders)
   wear white jacket (Valenti's idea)
   summon Liam and show him the gift box
   meet with Ambassador Aylene to present your gift

 It is not designed to be lifted, only ridden. The outer shell is
 extremely dense.

 Reminding yourself that you have never yet broken your neck on one of
 these things, you put your left foot onto the float unit and attempt to
 take your right foot off the floor.

 Naturally, being frictionless, it glides away, and you fall into a
 painful split.

 The good thing about this, remember, is that you're alone down here.
 Plenty of opportunity to try again.

 You circle the float unit a few times, sizing it up. When it looks most
 helpless and unsuspecting, you hop on.

 It dips, wobbles, tries to dodge -- but you master it. Yes. You are
 aboard.

 The purpose of the float unit is to allow you to do awkwardly what the
 natives do well: hover a few inches off the ground (or water). It
 consists of an oval platform four or five inches thick and made of
 dense material, with a reservoir for floatpoints inside.  There is also
 a dial on one side. The unit currently hovers three inches off the
 floor.

 A small dial, unlabeled but presumably meant to control the floatation
 of the unit.

 Utility Room (on the personal float unit)
 Little more than a chilly concrete box. It continues some distance to
 the north.

 Something resembling the root system of Yggdrasil covers the south
 wall; from close up it appears to be a complex heating system with
 pipes and tubes.

 A curious combination of metal and organics. A potbellied brass shell
 contains a living organism with pinkish, sparsely-furred flesh visible
 at the openings. Metal pipes lead out of the shell into the walls, and
 a metal switch controls whether it is on or off. There's an intake gill
 along the front, also made of metal.

 The only thing not protected by metalwork is the heater's mouth, which
 has a black beak as long as your hand.

 Receiving Room (on the personal float unit)
 None of the rooms of the Embassy are ordinary, but this one is
 spectacular: the floor glittering with blue and gold glass, the vault a
 basketry of interwoven branches of interwoven branches. The lower half
 of the wall is covered with feathers, yellow and deep blue, like a
 parrot's.

 Something like a glass flower grows from the wall, a disguised bracket
 for holding a recording machine.

 It looks like a glass tulip with a round red seed in it.

 It looks like a round red seed. You've seen these before, on the ship
 over: they're recording devices that mature as they fill up with data,
 and will show their contents when squeezed. It is around the size of an
 apricot pit.

 They have the gloss of real feathers, and that doesn't change the
 complete strangeness of having them there. The whole room seems like a
 thematic allusion to a lost Amazonian jungle, as interpreted by
 aesthetes with no experience of a natural biome of any kind. Which is
 true.

 You run over the things various people have decided you ought to do:

 You open the display case.

 Picking the pink card up is challenging because, you discover, it's
 embedded with a couple of floatpoints -- probably a security-override
 device. You can grasp it by the edges, though.

 The pink card appears to say cure/serum fatal-sickness primitive
 borrowed -- research center room 58 -- card-that-grants-access.

 You urge the float unit east down the stairs: quickly it gathers speed
 and sends you shooting across into the middle of...

 Reflecting Pool (on the personal float unit)
 On the float unit, you are able to float above the water. The water
 underneath the float unit goes flat. The fish bump into the surface and
 bounce off as if from a sheet of aquarium glassthe western end of a
 shallow rectangular pool -- no doubt part of the reason the air is
 softer and more humid here than it was outside. The garden paths open
 at the east end of the pool; the Embassy is west, at your back.

 If you look down, you catch the reflection in the surface, and a number
 of small red fish swimming around, in formation, making symbols which
 you cannot read.

 You wander between plots: what catches your eye this time is purplish
 moss several inches deep but with no identifiable purpose.

 Grand Solarium (on the personal float unit)
 The Grand Solarium is an enormous dome with an oval roof of glass and
 grown metalwork. Inside is a botanical garden, which, on this planet,
 is a kind of art museum. Each plot displays some invented shrub that
 would be illegal on Earth.

 The southern end of the dome, where they grow edible crops, is hidden
 by a decorative screen of hanging flowers. The garden also continues to
 the east; away to the west is the front of the Earth Embassy, now your
 home.

 A double set of insulating doors leads north to the outdoors.

 You head out of the Solarium and down a brief slope, into the clearing
 at the center of town.

 Clearing (on the personal float unit)
 The street runs north/south, so that you have an uninterrupted view of
 Cordia Peak, and the leading edge of the glacier at the northern edge
 of town.

 Both sides of the street are built up. A substantial building of metal
 and glass lies to the east, houses to the west.

 The rings in the southern sky are partly obscured by the buildings on
 the horizon, but are still bright enough to catch the eye.

 A double set of insulating doors leads south into a huge glass and
 metal dome, a greenhouse and Solarium where most of the local
 population now lives; the Embassy is inside.

 At the center of the open space here is a monument shaped like a tusk
 or tooth.


 Research Facility (on the personal float unit)
 The lobby of the building is surprisingly open: you would have expected
 security and a receptionist. But there are no industrial secrets to
 protect.

 Mounted on the east wall are colorful project proposals.

 A baffling number of doors lead out to smaller rooms around the
 perimeter of the central space. They are all protected by security
 fields, so that you can't even approach them without a way to breach
 the barrier.

 A glance around reveals a Door 58 to the northeast.

 Several different proposals of varying complexity: at one end, in
 childlike handwriting, is a proposal with sketches of fish; at the
 other, something about colonist eye color and brain function, with many
 pages of additional notes. You also note one with what looks like a map
 of Africa.

 The float unit lets you hover off the ground. It does not let you pass
 through walls or give you access to restricted areas. From here, you
 can go west (to the clearing) or northeast.

 You walk to the door and hesitate. The etiquette of the situation is
 unclear. On the one hand, it's impolite to knock. On the other, you do
 have a card which grants you the right to enter, and which deactivates
 the security field. So it must be all right...

 You step through the field, which here is translucent grey...


 Private Laboratory (on the personal float unit)
 A room outfitted with lab desk, lab drawer, a recycling chute, and
 assorted equipment. It's immediately obvious what kind of
 experimentation that takes place here. The walls are a shrine to humans
 -- and not to the human genome, which would be comprehensible, but to
 human society. Some still shots from Chinese television, a sketch of
 Stonehenge, a landscape recognizably New Zealand...

 The door out leads southwest.

 Beside the lab desk is a female scientist, perhaps in her teens.

 She greets you with a stream of words you don't understand, and bows
 deep.

 A personal float unit hovers three inches off the floor at the middle

 Beside the lab desk is a female scientist, perhaps in her teens.

 She greets you with a stream of words you don't understand, and bows

 Someone, someone must have made this creature on purpose to attract
 humans. It is what makes sense. Perhaps because they knew that it would
 be that much harder to refuse help to a colonist who looked like
 this... Ignoring your less respectable urges, you hand the pink card
 over to her.

 She holds up a finger as though to say: wait. And reaching into her
 cleavage, she removes a tiny man, whom she sets down on the desk. It
 looks alive, after a fashion. You have heard of these things, little
 living models with almost no intelligence -- but you'd never seen one
 before.

 She gets out some small ration bars and feeds them to the tiny man, who
 eats ravenously, making faces. "See?" her expression seems to say. "It
 is just like one of you people."

 But of course it isn't: it is like a human who has been a bit modified.
 He floats a bit over the table, for all that he looks like a little
 person.

 Lolita is your first thought. She has the long sweet limbs, the
 faunlike brown eyes that meet yours and dart away. The most alien
 features of the Colonists are subdued in her, leaving only a subtle
 exoticism you can hardly stop looking at. And the longer you look, the
 less sure you are whether she's really that young, or just some
 perfectly tuned ideal of innocence.

 They made her like that on purpose.

 Having eaten to the point where his stomach is distended, the model man
 lies down, curls up, and begins to snore a tiny, insect-like snore.

 The girl -- no, scientist -- turns to you and says something
 long-winded. Though you can't understand the words, the gist is plain
 enough: do you like it? Are you interested? Do you want one of your
 very own? How about we install some floatpoints in your kind?

 An offer of what they might do if you let them come back to Earth,
 perhaps -- if a very naive one.

 You can't see any such thing.

 On the lab desk is a tiny man.

 A small man, only about six inches tall. He looks uncannily like
 Valenti. He also has tiny floatpoints in his hands and feet, like a
 Colonist.

>take pink card
 That seems to belong to the female scientist.

 You can't get it open. No authorization.

 A chute for the disposal of wastes from the lab.

 Anything you might say in English -- or any other language you know,
 for that matter -- would be pretty much incomprehensible here. Unless
 you found a scholar of ancient languages, but as far as you can tell,
 they don't go in for that.

>think
 You run over the things various people have decided you ought to do:
   acquire vaccine from the research facility (HC's orders)
   wear white jacket (Valenti's idea)
   summon Liam and show him the gift box
   meet with Ambassador Aylene to present your gift

>ask scientist for vaccine
 You can't see any such thing.

>consult computer about vaccine
 Your search turns up the following articles:

 High Command: An extremely circumspect article describing how, in the
 later years of the plague, the international quarantine authority in
 North America became a de facto government and managed the distribution
 not only of vaccine (once available) but also of other essential
 resources. All hints of controversy are omitted.

 plague: Billions of deaths, infection rates most severe in the less
 developed countries; revolutions and crumbling infrastructure; the
 regress of technology.  This is why High Command wants back the
 Aleheart population.  Fear of contaminating the environment with
 engineered flora and fauna seems insignificant now in the face of such
 medical sophistication -- an insurance against the same ever happening
 again.  The vaccine exists, of course, and is produced in great
 quantity still, though it is very expensive to make.

 There isn't any personal data available from logs or annotations.

>ask tiny man about vaccine
 Anything you might say in English -- or any other language you know,
 for that matter -- would be pretty much incomprehensible here. Unless
 you found a scholar of ancient languages, but as far as you can tell,
 they don't go in for that.

 You gingerly pick up the tiny man, thinking that Kruger would have an
 aneurysm if he saw this thing. The girl seems to read this as
 encouragement, though. Perhaps this is her research project, her final
 thesis. Depressing thought.

 The little man is warm in the palm of your hand, like a hamster.

 Evidently feeling that she need not keep you any longer, she also gets
 out the vaccine sample and hands it over to you.

 Mentally you check off "acquire vaccine from the research facility
 (HC's orders)" on your list of remaining tasks. You run over the things
 various people have decided you ought to do:
   wear white jacket (Valenti's idea)
   summon Liam and show him the gift box
   meet with Ambassador Aylene to present your gift

 You recognize this -- and how could one not? The writing on the outside
 of the glass bottle has faded, and the contents perhaps degenerated
 with time, but the bulbous bottle shape, the sigil of High Command on
 the cap, the blue-black tint of the liquid like ink, all are iconic
 now.

 (heading southwest, since that is the only direction available)

 Research Facility
 The lobby is an open oval room, with no security or reception desk.

 Mounted on the east wall are colorful project proposals.

 A baffling number of doors lead out to smaller rooms around the
 perimeter of the central space. They are all protected by security
 fields, so that you can't even approach them without a way to breach
 the barrier.

 A glance around reveals a Door 58 to the northeast.

 A personal float unit hovers three inches off the floor at the middle
 of the room.

 You climb back on the float unit, increasingly confident.


 Clearing (on the personal float unit)
 The street runs north/south, so that you have an uninterrupted view of
 Cordia Peak, and the leading edge of the glacier at the northern edge
 of town.

 Both sides of the street are built up. A substantial building of metal
 and glass lies to the east, houses to the west.

 The rings in the southern sky are partly obscured by the buildings on
 the horizon, but are still bright enough to catch the eye.

 A double set of insulating doors leads south into a huge glass and
 metal dome, a greenhouse and Solarium where most of the local
 population now lives; the Embassy is inside.

 At the center of the open space here is a monument shaped like a tusk
 or tooth.


 Grand Solarium (on the personal float unit)
 The Grand Solarium is an enormous dome with an oval roof of glass and
 grown metalwork. Inside is a botanical garden, which, on this planet,
 is a kind of art museum. Each plot displays some invented shrub that
 would be illegal on Earth.

 The southern end of the dome, where they grow edible crops, is hidden
 by a decorative screen of hanging flowers. The garden also continues to
 the east; away to the west is the front of the Earth Embassy, now your
 home.

 A double set of insulating doors leads north to the outdoors.

 You wander between plots: what catches your eye this time is a
 writing-desk-tree, spreading to a flat surface at about three feet.

 Reflecting Pool (on the personal float unit)
 On the float unit, you are able to float above the water. The water
 underneath the float unit goes flat. The fish bump into the surface and
 bounce off as if from a sheet of aquarium glassthe eastern end of a
 shallow rectangular pool -- no doubt part of the reason the air is
 softer and more humid here than it was outside. The Embassy is just
 west of here, at the far end of the pool.

 If you look down, you catch the reflection in the surface, and a number
 of small red fish swimming around, in formation, making symbols which
 you cannot read.


 Front Stairs (on the personal float unit)
 The Embassy proper is directly west. The entrance is flanked by orange
 trees, familiar and earthly.

 From the top of the Front Stairs you have an excellent view of the
 whole interior of the Solarium, the sunlight catching in the curved
 triangular panes of glass.

 East, at the bottom of the stairs, is the mirror-glass of the pool.
 Beyond it the botanical garden has a structure invisible from the
 inside.


 Embassy Foyer (on the personal float unit)
 Like most buildings here, the Embassy is built with an eye for organic
 color and form: windows and doorways framed with curved ironwork,
 accents of bright enamel, wooden floors grown in place. All
 conspicuously wasteful of both materials and labor. It might be
 intended to make Earth representatives uncomfortable, or it might be
 meant as an honor, or it might be an advertisement for a standard of
 living that Earth lost some time ago. Too hard to tell.

 There's a large Receiving Room to the west. Less prominent rooms lie
 north and south -- the south with a locked private door, the north an
 archway offering a mercifully limited view of the "Museum". Shallow
 stairs, almost a ramp, rise to a second story.

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>time
 It is 4:20 pm -- here, anyhow.

 You take off the long scarlet robe.

 You pull Valenti's white jacket on. The effect could be more
 flattering: the float-pins make it stand out around your torso as
 though inflated. You can't see, but it feels as though all your chest
 hair is being forced to lie flat. Breathing in is a challenge.

 Mentally you check off "wear white jacket (Valenti's idea)" on your
 list of remaining tasks. You run over the things various people have
 decided you ought to do:
   summon Liam and show him the gift box
   meet with Ambassador Aylene to present your gift

 The kumquat will not fit in the gift box.

 You are carrying:
   a vaccine sample
   a tiny sleeping man
   a kumquat
   a silver kiddush cup
   some fuzzy bunny slippers
   a yellow paper note
   a mail packet
   an empty gift box
   a handheld computer (in which is a data disk)
   a grey widget saying SOC 15.14945, POW 20.9361, INT 12.9797
   a flowing scarlet robe
   a humiliating outfit of puffy white jacket, chronometer, grey
 undersuit, shoes, and socks

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 You tuck the vaccine into the box.

 A flash of memory: A long line of people standing, closer together than
 strangers ever stand. Holding hands, sometimes kissing. Everyone wears
 their sleeves rolled up, their upper arms bare. Out in the middle of
 the square, two old men in drag are dancing a tango. A ring of girls
 has gathered to watch.

 Your mother stands beside you, periodically squeezing your elbow. "Your
 father would have loved this," she says each time. She does not sound
 wistful, just overwhelmingly glad.

 Far off at the front of the line is a white pavilion with a blue-black
 logo stitched into the roof.

 The surface has a give to it, and it squeaks once. COMING, reads the
 skin lettering tersely.

 Liam slips through the locked barrier from the south.

 Liam takes in your clothing, then looks into the box. "Equal
 partnership, with a shared work in medical enterprises?" he says. "This
 is what you desire to propose to our Ambassador?"

 Liam bows and departs to make a few arrangements. You wait, and cool
 your heels. People come and go. Messages are sent. When everything is
 ready, you gather...

 Receiving Room (on the personal float unit)
 None of the rooms of the Embassy are ordinary, but this one is
 spectacular: the floor glittering with blue and gold glass, the vault a
 basketry of interwoven branches of interwoven branches. The lower half
 of the wall is covered with feathers, yellow and deep blue, like a
 parrot's.

 The heressa who must be Ambassador Aylene stands at the far end of the
 hall. The approach to her is flanked by two rows of witnesses. You
 hadn't anticipated that, somehow, though surely you should have. As for
 Liam, he is carefully in the corner, aligning himself neither with you
 nor with his own people.

 You had been expecting someone slight and ephemeral-looking, but she is
 a tall woman and built proportionally, and reminds you of the pictures
 you have sometimes seen of proud African women from before the bad
 years. Only her eyes are wrong, not brown but something closer to
 golden.

 Anything you might say in English -- or any other language you know,
 for that matter -- would be pretty much incomprehensible here. Unless
 you found a scholar of ancient languages, but as far as you can tell,
 they don't go in for that.

 Aylene receives the box and looks at the vaccine sample for a moment.
 She looks at you -- surprised, a little concerned, perhaps?

 Then she faces her audience and begins to speak.

 *** Some weeks later ***

 "I take it, then, that you support this decision?"

 It's not unpleasant to see Kruger grilling Valenti for a bit, rather
 than you. Though there's plenty of grilling to go around.

 "It was always a bad idea to invite them to Earth as our inferiors,"
 says Valenti stolidly. "I would have arranged things differently if I
 had been the ambassador at the time, but I do believe this is the best
 thing David could have done with the options available to him."

 "The idea that the Colonists work in collaboration with human
 scientists will not be received well at home," says Kruger.

 "To understatement," Valenti replies, lifting his glass. He is drinking
 an anise liqueur he favors. You and Kruger watch him take another
 yellow sip. "Are you going to change the deal? I should warn you that
 alteration to a contract is viewed with extreme disfavor in their
 society."

 "Which is why you and David should have followed my advice in the first
 place!" Kruger yells. "I pulled Yamashita because she expressed
 reservations of conscience about what I was asking her to do, and I
 pulled you because I didn't trust you to follow orders, but I never
 thought David would go native on his first day there. What's wrong with
 you?"

 Valenti frowns into his glass, swirling the ice around. "With respect,
 sir, you a few hours on Aleheart itself would have been enough to
 change your plans."

 Kruger's face gradually loses the beet color. "We gave the matter a
 great deal of thought," he says. "Thought, study, polls, moral
 consultations. Also prayer, meditation, even a tarot reading or two,
 I'm told. Those were off the meeting record and on a strictly
 individual basis. But there is a female member of the commission who
 claims that a good tarot spread focuses her thinking."

 "There are things you cannot reason out," Valenti says. "When you're
 face-to-face with the colonists, you see how much they long to be back
 on Earth. They are afraid of our bad opinion, conscious that they are
 our descendants, and embarrassed by how primitive we seem to be. But
 they are also infatuated. There are some dissenters, but most would do
 whatever they could to be with us again. They will bend themselves to
 fit Earth. We do not have to force them to do anything."

 Kruger glares out the window. He does not say anything.

 Valenti catches your eye and raises his glass in a small salute.

 Receiving Room (on the personal float unit)
 None of the rooms of the Embassy are ordinary, but this one is
 spectacular: the floor glittering with blue and gold glass, the vault a
 basketry of interwoven branches of interwoven branches. The lower half
 of the wall is covered with feathers, yellow and deep blue, like a

 Something like a glass flower grows from the wall, a disguised bracket
 for holding a recording machine.

>take seed
 Taken.

>put kumquat in bracket
 The bracket is precisely shaped to hold only a small round recording
 machine.

>go to basement
 You hurry toward embassy foyer, the museum, and then the basement.


 Basement (on the personal float unit)
 Unlike the upper levels of the Embassy, the basement is built for
 practical purposes, and resembles the inside of a concrete cigar box.
 It continues to the south, dimly lit and cold.

 Along the west wall, a chute from above empties into a large metal
 container.

>go south

 Utility Room (on the personal float unit)
 Little more than a chilly concrete box. It continues some distance to
 the north.

 Something resembling the root system of Yggdrasil covers the south
 wall; from close up it appears to be a complex heating system with
 pipes and tubes.

>give seed to beak
 You can only do that to something animate.

>put seed in beak
 The heater tentatively opens its beak to admit the recording machine.
 Then it begins to chomp away. There are at first some sparks, droplets
 of flying juice, abortive beginnings of projections, but soon it is
 thoroughly destroyed and reduced to pure food form.

>undo
 Utility Room
 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine seed
 It looks like a round red seed. You've seen these before, on the ship
 over: they're recording devices that mature as they fill up with data,
 and will show their contents when squeezed. It is around the size of an
 apricot pit.

>squeeze seed
 An image begins to play, projecting itself:

 The room is a mess, bits of things scattered around. The camera begins
 on a heressa you assume must be Aylene, a beautiful woman of apparently
 African descent, who floats as still as if she were anchored.

 "Things like this," says Valenti forcefully, "you don't predict. You
 choose without full knowledge, and make the choice good." He picks up a
 silvery streamer from the floor and plays at crumpling it.

 She answers in her language, and the subtitle says: If it were me only.

 He stuffs his hands into his pockets, streamer and all. "It could be
 you only. With or without the treaty of cohabitation, I would still
 marry you."

 Your genes are bad. Why would I marry you?

 "For pleasure."

 The recording plays on: Valenti has stopped pacing and is watching her.
 She meets his eye and smiles a small smile. I do not know if I can walk
 all the rest of my life on dirt, even for you.

 "It's mostly floors, really," Valenti says, fists held rigidly in
 pockets. "The once-popular custom of walking barefoot in the dirt is a
 few hundred years behind us."

 Our greatest art is a disgusting offense on Earth. Do we go where we
 are despised?

 "I know," he says. "There are concessions I cannot make. If I tried,
 they would not be honored."

 He gives the tormented streamer another pull, and it breaks apart in
 his hands with a flash of grey light; here the recording ends.

>go to bedroom
 You hurry toward the basement, the museum, embassy foyer, the hall, and
 then the bedroom.


 Bedroom (on the personal float unit)
 There's no real bed, only a stone platform, too short to accommodate
 your full height, in the center of the room. The sole gesture towards
 comfort is a pillow of Earth style, perhaps left here by Valenti. Aside
 from this, the place is unfurnished.

 A refreshment room is visible to the west, and the hallway is back to
 the south.

 Your suitcase lies open on the floor.

>take seed
 You already have that.

>go south

 Hall (on the personal float unit)
 At the top of the shallow stairs there is a spacious landing, with
 windows giving a view east across the Grand Solarium garden. Apparently
 past ambassadors have found this a pleasant place in which to read,
 because there is a small library of Earth books, otherwise impossible
 to get here.

 The other interesting item is a chute in the wall, looking (like
 everything else here) as though it had grown as metal or bone into the
 wall.

 The entry to your bedroom is to the north, and an office area to the
 south.

 There are some ration bars and a squashed unripe seed on the floor.

>take unripe seed. squeeze it.
 Taken.

 You squeeze the thing tentatively and it hisses sparks and juice, but
 then it begins to play, a projection hovering in the middle of the air:

 Liam is standing in a group with some others, in the Receiving Room,
 when Valenti walks in. DID YOU VOTE IN THIS MATTER? say projected
 English subtitles shakily.

 Liam shivers. Replacing the ambassador heressa? Everyone voted, my
 lord. We determined she does not make progress.

 Then Valenti grabs him by the middle of his robes where there are no
 floatpoints, and shoves violently. Liam falls hard on the sharp floor,
 mortified and astonished. Progress, Valenti repeats, dusting his hands.

 She stays until Gift Day,  Liam says, not trying to get up.

 Valenti nods curtly and goes out; the other people in the group
 tactfully turn aside. Liam wipes the back of his mouth with his hand.
 After a moment he crawls to the corner and is sick.

 The image flickers out, leaking warm juice from the recorder.

>go kiosk
 You aren't in Kiosk.

>go to kiosk
 You hurry toward embassy foyer, the front stairs, the reflecting pool,
 grand solarium, the clearing, the broad street, ruined vineyard, and
 then kiosk.


 Kiosk (on the personal float unit)
 The kiosk is no larger than a contamination testing booth back on
 Earth.

 The only thing of note here is a metal box, mounted on the wall at
 about shoulder-height, with a bonzai-sized tree growing out of the top.

>examine box
 (the empty gift box)
 A decorative box, obviously made on Earth, enameled like a Faberge
 piece. The exterior is covered in a design of leaves and morning
 glories.

>examine metal box
 A machine titled DATA COMPRESSION AND STORAGE. There is a miniature
 tree growing out of the top, naked of foliage. On the front of the
 metal box are green and blue push-knobs, and a movable bronze pointer.

 On the left side of the machine there is a funnel, the right size for
 inserting a recording fruit.

 The green knob appears to say RECORD.

 The four settings of the pointer are ORIGINAL, SCIENTIFIC, STORY,
 SOCIAL.

 The pointer is currently set to story.

>put unripe seed in funnel
 The damaged recorder rolls down inside the machine. There is a whirr
 like your mother's juicer on the first day of a new diet.

>set pointer to story
 The bronze pointer is already aligned in that direction.

 The projection plays. It is Liam and Valenti in the Receiving Room
 again, but a Receiving Room that looks sketchy and animated, many of
 the details blurred out and replaced with a schematic representation.
 Liam and Valenti face each other, in a semi-circle of nondescript
 onlookers.

 YOU HAVE OPPOSED MY WISHES! sings the angry cartoon Valenti, AND CAUSED
 HARM TO ONE OF MY ALLIES.

 Cartoon Liam bows his head. IT WAS IN FULFILMENT OF MY CIVIC DUTY, he
 sings meekly, leading into a monody about the needs of the colony being
 more important than personal considerations. Nonetheless, his posture
 is apologetic rather than defiant. Tears run freely from his cartoon
 face.

 Valenti bursts into a lyrically agitated reply, vocally quite complex;
 the translation, which you feel must not do justice to the poetry of
 the original, is

 YOU BETRAYED US YOU RUINED OUR PLANS
  YOU BETRAYED US YOU WEASEL

 Whereupon cartoon Valenti walks out of the room. Cartoon Liam takes out
 a bottle from somewhere in his robes and sings a sad song of
 explanation: it is a poison keyed to his genetic makeup, which he has
 had ready in case he failed to please his creators. He drinks it off
 and falls dead.

 The assembled company, which has been silent up to this point, ends the
 scene with a few platitudinous choruses on the subject of divided duty,
 and the scene flickers out.

 Liam and Valenti are inspecting some diagrams, unreadable.

 I propose we replace technician Aylene, says Liam. I do not believe she
 has the required skills to complete this task.

 I disagree, says Valenti.

 Let us compromise, Liam remarks.

 Valenti: We will give her a deadline.

 Liam: If she does not meet it--

 Valenti: -- then I will send her away, wearing black. But if she
 succeeds by Gift Day--

 Liam: -- then she will have honor for her achievement.

 Liam, Valenti: This compromise is sufficient for us both.

 the details blurred out and replaced with a schematic representation.
 Liam and Valenti are standing together, a little apart from the rest of
 the group.

 YOU VOTED AGAINST AYLENE! says Valenti.

 This was not intended as a personal insult! replies Liam, Indeed I am
 very sorry you should be distressed by her removal when you have come
 to stand on terms of friendship with her. But I fear that those
 qualities which you value in her, not least her desire to give pain to
 no one, are causing a delay which may prove disastrous to all.

 Valenti grunts. YOU ARE VERY STUPID.

 Cartoon Liam looks pale. Perhaps you are aware that the ambassador is
 not to be removed until after Gift Day; thus there remains some
 opportunity for her to conclude this business expeditiously, and retire
 with honor. If this is your desire, then it certainly lies in your
 power to assist her!

 Valenti walks out of the room.

 Liam turns to one side. A thought caption appears above his head: How
 distressing it is to be in the employ of one with so little
 understanding of the proprieties! And how much worse to have
 disappointed one whose capacities are so far inferior to one's own!

 The bronze pointer is already aligned in that direction.

>push green knob
 The green knob clunks in. There's a pause, and then a silver floating
 symbol-message comes up saying ORIGINAL FRUIT DAMAGED.

 A moment later the damaged fruit comes flying out of the funnel. The
 designer must have put a lot of love into the eject button.

>examine damaged fruit
 It is evident (now) that this is one of those recorders that grows
 riper as it gets more full of information, and that something happened
 to it at a primitive stage of its growth. Probably Valenti could think
 of no place where people would be less likely to pry than his food
 cabinet.

>take it
 Taken.

>squeeze it
 You squeeze the thing tentatively and it hisses sparks and juice, but
 then it begins to play, a projection hovering in the middle of the air:

 Liam is standing in a group with some others, in the Receiving Room,
 when Valenti walks in. DID YOU VOTE IN THIS MATTER? say projected
 English subtitles shakily.

 Liam shivers. Replacing the ambassador heressa? Everyone voted, my
 lord. We determined she does not make progress.

 Then Valenti grabs him by the middle of his robes where there are no
 floatpoints, and shoves violently. Liam falls hard on the sharp floor,
 mortified and astonished. Progress, Valenti repeats, dusting his hands.

 She stays until Gift Day,  Liam says, not trying to get up.

 Valenti nods curtly and goes out; the other people in the group
 tactfully turn aside. Liam wipes the back of his mouth with his hand.
 After a moment he crawls to the corner and is sick.

 The image flickers out, leaking warm juice from the recorder.

>squeeze red fruit
 You can't see any such thing.

>squeeze red seed
 An image begins to play, projecting itself:

 The room is a mess, bits of things scattered around. The camera begins
 on a heressa you assume must be Aylene, a beautiful woman of apparently
 African descent, who floats as still as if she were anchored.

 "Things like this," says Valenti forcefully, "you don't predict. You
 choose without full knowledge, and make the choice good." He picks up a
 silvery streamer from the floor and plays at crumpling it.

 She answers in her language, and the subtitle says: If it were me only.

 He stuffs his hands into his pockets, streamer and all. "It could be
 you only. With or without the treaty of cohabitation, I would still
 marry you."

 Your genes are bad. Why would I marry you?

 "For pleasure."

 The recording plays on: Valenti has stopped pacing and is watching her.
 She meets his eye and smiles a small smile. I do not know if I can walk
 all the rest of my life on dirt, even for you.

 "It's mostly floors, really," Valenti says, fists held rigidly in
 pockets. "The once-popular custom of walking barefoot in the dirt is a
 few hundred years behind us."

 Our greatest art is a disgusting offense on Earth. Do we go where we
 are despised?

 "I know," he says. "There are concessions I cannot make. If I tried,
 they would not be honored."

 He gives the tormented streamer another pull, and it breaks apart in
 his hands with a flash of grey light; here the recording ends.

>put red seed in funnel
 The recording machine rolls down inside the machine. There is a whirr
 like your mother's juicer on the first day of a new diet.

 Valenti and Aylene float serenely in a space that looks more like a
 stage set than the Receiving Room. Their features, also, have been
 simplified to the point of cartoonishness. Their songs are very long
 and detailed, and the subtitles only try to provide a summary; you have
 the sense that the lyrics are borrowed more or less directly from some
 classic work.

 Aylene: Your people are not genetically compatible with mine.

 Valenti: Perhaps a cross-breed would not be so bad!

 Aylene: It would be a waste of the colony's resources!

 Valenti: I wish you felt otherwise.

 Aylene: It is not a question of my feelings.

 Valenti: You are cold-hearted!

 Aylene: You are stupid!

 Valenti, Aylene: How strange that I love you very much!

 Valenti and Aylene are standing together and looking at some papers.
 Valenti is wearing white, Aylene some neutral color.

 Valenti says, "Look, I have prepared a model of our descendants!"

 Aylene bends to look at the paper as well, and her eyes go wide with
 cartoonish horror. "Our child is deformed!"

 Valenti frowns and looks again at the paper. "It is true it is not
 attractive --"

 "--it has two heads!" Aylene retorts.

 Valenti: "Looks are not everything--"

 Aylene: "--it would argue with itself all day!"

 Valenti: "Does anyone else offer you the same treaty?"

 Aylene: "No, there are no counteroffers."

 Valenti: "Then consider." And he rolls up the diagram of the two-headed
 child, and walks away with it.

 "I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY ME," says Valenti.

 Aylene looks at him shyly. "I am flattered by your offer, and not
 indifferent to you personally, but I have some fears about the alliance
 of our families."

 "YOU ARE HOT," says Valenti.

 Aylene blushes. "It would not be right to be persuaded by that sort of
 reason."

 "LETS GET TOGETHER BABY," says Valenti.

 "I do not usually consider associating with men quite of your style,"
 Aylene admits a little awkwardly. "Despite your animal allure, you
 would not be at all comfortable at the social gatherings as I must
 routinely attend, and my friends would not hold you in high esteem."

 "THAT IS NOT VERY NICE."

 "Please try to understand."

 "IF YOU DO NOT GET WITH ME YOU WILL WIND UP SINGLE."

 Aylene looks annoyed. "Possible! Now leave me alone." She goes out.

>push green knob
 You push the green knob in: it resists, proving the solidity of the

 Nothing happens.

 Then a small flower blooms on the tree, hurrying in seconds through a
 spring and summer, until the petals drop away. It swells into a fruit
 the size of a kumquat.

 You get off the personal float unit.

 Kiosk
 The kiosk is no larger than a contamination testing booth back on
 Earth.

 A personal float unit hovers three inches off the floor at the middle
 of the room.

 The only thing of note here is a metal box, mounted on the wall at
 about shoulder-height, with a bonzai-sized tree growing out of the top.

 The contents might come out, and that would make a real mess.

>undo

 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine float unit
 The purpose of the float unit is to allow you to do awkwardly what the
 natives do well: hover a few inches off the ground (or water). It
 consists of an oval platform four or five inches thick and made of
 dense material, with a reservoir for floatpoints inside.  There is also
 a dial on one side. The unit currently hovers three inches off the
 floor.

>examine dial
 A small dial, unlabeled but presumably meant to control the floatation
 of the unit.

>turn dial
 You reach down and twiddle the dial on the side of the float unit,
 feeling very much the master even of the most alien technology.

 This feeling passes, however, when the dial sticks in place without
 adjusting anything.

 You struggle with the dial, exerting the strength developed in the

 freely without effect.

>press dial
 The dial cannot be moved separately from the personal float unit.

 Whatever you did, it put an end to uses of the convenient dial. If you
 want to change the setting of the float unit, you'll have to do

 A machine titled DATA COMPRESSION AND STORAGE. There is a miniature

 On the left side of the machine there is a funnel, the right size for

 what they really meant.

 six months ago: Aylene gave me a live rock! Which, in theory,
 calculates what everyone thinks of me, to many decimal places of
 accuracy (!).  Don't think she realized what negative reinforcement
 this would be. Can't help experimenting with ways to make numbers go up
 and down.  Bet I could crash all three to zero if I ran through the
 Solarium bareassed.  Apparently the thing corresponds to a portion of
 the alien brain. I admit (if only to myself) that I find the concept
 disgusting. But I admit a lot to myself lately. I gather my predecessor
 talked to herself as well.  I need some recordings of human speech or
 may go insane...

 broadcasting as well as audio and visual -- the same stuff picked up by

 three months ago: I tried asking her whether she can factor in my
 thoughts the same way her little live rock tracks everyone else's. She
 said no, I don't broadcast. She looked tremendously uncomfortable. I
 cannot say how smug this makes me.

 five weeks ago: Is it possible that Liam is jealous of me because of
 Aylene? I find him lurking around after she's been here, looking sniffy
 and grim. Naturally Aylene's live rock doesn't offer any sort of data
 analysis function. That might be dangerously useful.

 five weeks ago: Suppose I could feed recordings through social
 compression to get some idea what Feckless Assistant is thinking. Not
 sure I want to know, though. Despite live rock, this method feels a
 little like spying. Not to say I won't. Just that I'm not sure I will.

>consult computer about charla

 seven months ago: Huge wad of demands from Earth that I do research to
 find people's missing ancestors. In my spare time from carving out a
 treaty, I am to look for someone's great-aunt Charla.

 five months ago: More background research. Think I found the files on
 this Charla character, but they're very strange. All their historical
 data is preserved in severely lossy formats.

 four months ago: More research. My Charla seems to have been married to
 Peter Long. Wish I had a clearer idea of what Peter Long was up to.

 four months ago: So. Put together the archive files on Charla and her
 companion Peter Long here. I have what appear to be six versions of the
 same events, recorded in distinctly stylized and different forms --
 including what looks like an opera. (Or some perversion thereof.) I'd
 say they were literary reworkings but no, they seem actually to be a
 convention-based compression of some original, now-lost data recording.
 The weird thing is that they don't all end the same way -- apparently
 the conventions of recording are allowed to override, for instance,
 matters of fact.

 four months ago: Oh my. Cross-comparing the data and the compression
 algorithm information I could find I think I have worked my way to a
 fuzzy but more-accurate version of the original. Spent a good while in
 the archive building messing with the kiosks. Got to talk to A about
 this, find out if it is really true. If it is, we may end scuttling the
 whole treaty if I report what I found on Charla and Peter Long. Long is
 really the issue; it's just our bad bad bad bad bad luck that Charla's
 relatives are still alive and, worse, pushy about finding out what
 became of her.

 three months ago: Long talk with A, and she essentially confirmed for
 me what I had already pieced together, though with some bits that I
 hadn't quite understood about Peter and Charla. And then I got rid of
 the recordings. The destruction of data, a slippery slope. This was
 much bigger than getting rid of Yamashita's correspondence disc but it
 felt less awful, somehow. This is something I cannot, cannot report
 back if I want these people saved. And increasingly I do. Even my
 infuriating assistant.

 two months ago: Funny sort of personal conversation with A. Turns out
 that she is descended from Peter and Charla herself -- the whole A line
 is. This is such a strange thought to me. Apparently they're among the
 most human-like of the remaining lines (though with certain obligatory
 modifications, of course), which I suppose is why she was assigned to

 Aleheart family structure: On Aleheart Colony marriage bears a strong
 resemblance to a corporate merger. Possessions, resources, and
 knowledge are pooled; the efficiency rating of the family unit is
 understood to be an average of the efficiency of all its members, with
 income determined accordingly, so that merger with a significantly less
 efficient partner is a sacrifice rarely made.  Children are rated on a
 different scale, but their rating is also counted for the family
 starting at the age of four.  This produces extra economic and social
 pressure towards flushing children who turn out to be lazy or ill-made.

 looking rather at a joint stewardship of the resources available to
 both planets.  HC should be able to live with that.  I don't know
 whether the general population would be so enthusiastic, but the
 general population seems to think it's a point of principle not to make
 any concessions or in fact live in the real world in any way.

 Your search turns up the following articles:

 Europe: This could take a while to read, but as far as recent history
 is concerned, that territory is now mostly under the control of High
 Command, and still populated, though not nearly so thickly as it once
 was.  There are a lot of crumbling suburbs all over the former first
 world, where no one wants to live any longer, because the lifestyle
 eats resources and the neighborhoods are lonely.

 Earth history (general): The recent history of Earth is not light
 reading, and it's hard to scan through the encyclopedia article without
 some sense of irritation; but it was prepared with the understanding
 that the computer might be taken and read by the Aleheart colony.
 Perhaps that is why it is so coy about the plague years, the desolation
 of Africa, Chinese separatism...

 three months ago: I don't know why High Command likes this conditional
 adoption concept.  For one thing, even if we do make them agree to do
 what we say for a while, we don't have the power to keep them in line
 by force, and if they resent us they'll eventually fight back.  And
 second, segregating a minority culture and relegating it to some ghetto
 has a long history of being a horrible idea. HC does not think of these
 things?

 Your search turns up the following articles:

 Aleheart Climate: The article is somewhat rough, since, though Earth
 has been running its own tests by probe and satellite on the viability
 of Aleheart's climate, most of its information comes from the
 statements of the Aleheart diplomatic structure.  There are those
 paranoid enough to think that they might be fabricating the problem for
 unknown reasons.

 Aleheart Colony: You've read the article before, but you refresh
 yourself on the major topics: how the Aleheart corporation grew large
 and powerful; how its forays into genetic experimentation came into
 conflict with many Earth laws; how Aleheart launched its own colony in
 order to have a place completely under its own jurisdiction.  The
 rumors of human experimentation that trickled back to Earth made it
 difficult for Aleheart to continue operating at home at all, so instead
 the last employees were given a choice between layoff and emigration.
 Sometime after Aleheart Colony was established, it lost all contact
 with Earth, in the so-called Separation. The colony was picked up again
 only two years ago, orbiting a star in the wrong place, and so much
 changed that at first contact Earth-command thought it had heard from
 humanoid aliens.

 human genetic experimentation: There's no question, of course, that
 Aleheart has done things illegal on Earth -- far more extensively after
 all Earth contact was lost.  The current population is the product of
 those changes; they've been changed in appearance and body shape, and
 probably in an assortment of personality traits.  It is an open
 question whether they are still human enough for interbreeding, or
 whether they should now be considered a different species.

 Separation: The separation of Earth and Aleheart Colony occurred for
 reasons as yet undetermined.  Contact was re-established when Aleheart
 sent a message to Earth requesting a meeting.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 six months ago: Oh, I feel I am losing touch. Don't know whether Kruger
 intends this: for a smart man he can be very stupid. What happens if
 you send to Aleheart someone with no living family or lovers on Earth,
 and no humans to talk to? Of course they're bound to go a little
 native: people are social.

 five months ago: Have been doing the background research home people
 keep asking for, in attempt to stave off the suicidal gloom of winter,
 and because no one around here seems to want to do much in the
 mornings, when it is still so dark. Not that I blame them. But it turns
 out that the archives for Aleheart Corporation and the early days are
 terrible.

 sent a message to Earth requesting a meeting.

 First contact: First contact between Earth and Aleheart Colony after
 separation was the result of an Aleheart ship coming within cautious
 hailing distance of Earth. It remained in the solar system for several
 days before approaching directly.  The crew then sent a message in
 rather simple English and Chinese, requesting the right to meet "to get
 to know one another with an eye toward better friendship".

 seven months ago: If you ask me, the separation was the result of some
 kind of boneheaded physics experiment they did themselves.  Who knows?
 Of course they wouldn't say, if so.  But where do they get the
 floatpoints from anyway?  Collective act of will so they'd never have
 to touch anything ever again?

 three months ago: Weird sort of nobility about the separation story.
 Wish I could tell someone. God, god, god. I might ask for a human
 assistant or something. But of course what good would that do?
 Burdening a second person's conscience wouldn't really improve matters,
 and besides, he or she might not agree with me about what to do. No, I
 should avoid that.

 27 days ago: Went to the Earth Sanctuary and heard a few songs.
 Strangely moving. One of them was in fact about old Peter. Felt like it
 was the play to catch the conscience, etc., except of course in this
 case I'm not the murderer and it's everyone else's conscience that
 really ought to be bothered, not mine. It was a good song, though. They
 got out the flint knife at the end -- it's a prop of this performance,
 I gather.

 Ambassador Yamashita: You met Yamashita a few times before coming out
 here, but didn't get a strong impression of her, and her computer
 record is as tediously laudatory as you would expect; you lack the
 context to read between the lines.  She spent several years here before
 honorably returning to Earth, apparently without doing anything other
 than sending home reams of reports.  But possibly that was all there
 was to do here at the time.

 Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

 eight months ago: Met my counterpart, the ambassador Aylene, today.
 Frankly, High Command should have left Yamashita here -- they probably
 did wonderfully having tea parties together and comparing fashion
 notes. Have never met another human -- no, strike that, because she
 isn't human. Have never met any person with so little emotional affect
 in speech and behavior. Not sure what gene modifications they made to
 her, but it is frightening.

 eight months ago: Surprised and horrified by Yamashita's taste in
 office decor. Thought about donating hideous paintings to museum, but I
 worry this would lower us further in the opinion of the locals.

 six months ago: Well. Have been going through Yamashita's
 correspondence disk. I have solved the mystery of the hideous
 paintings: they appear to be a gift from a lover back home, who painted
 them herself. I had not guessed Yamashita was interesting enough to
 have a secret lover Kruger doesn't know about.

 Lover seems to be afflicted by residual plague nerve-degeneration too.
 I sense a conflict of interest! Wonder if Kruger did find out and yank
 Yamashita out for this reason? But since she doesn't seem to be
 languishing in disgrace, I don't know.

 four months ago: Destroyed Yamashita's correspondence disk. Don't
 really want HC reprimanding her after the fact for relationship that
 was probably the one thing keeping her sane... Then again, when I look
 at the paintings... Oh well.

 three months ago: Long talk with A, and she essentially confirmed for
 me what I had already pieced together, though with some bits that I
 hadn't quite understood about Peter and Charla. And then I got rid of
 the recordings. The destruction of data, a slippery slope. This was
 much bigger than getting rid of Yamashita's correspondence disc but it
 felt less awful, somehow. This is something I cannot, cannot report
 back if I want these people saved. And increasingly I do. Even my
 infuriating assistant.
