 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.

 Welcome to the IF story "Closed Circles".

 Before heading into the story there are a few things to be mentioned
 to help you get the richest possible experience of the tale.

 You will enter the story as a story character, free (within limits) to
 interact with the elements of the story and the story world.  Your
 story character - the protagonist - will come with ideas, a personal
 history, and a general outlook on life that you may not agree with,
 but which you cannot alter.  You as a reader are invited to accompany
 this character and to an extent decide his actions.  You will be
 challenged, both as the story character and as a reader to make up
 your mind about what is going on, and what is the appropriate response
 to what the protagonist experiences.

 If you at any time wish to be reminded of the most common ways of
 interacting with the story (commands that are available to you) you
 can type "help" to bring up a separate banner window with a static
 list of options.  There will be other ways of interacting with the
 story too, but it is up to you to find them.  Pay attention to what
 the story suggest that you do.  That way you will be pointed in the
 right direction.

 "About" will bring up the story's cover art.  "Credits" will give you
 the acknowledgments of the game.  If nothing you type bring any
 reactions from the window, take a glance at the status bar at the
 bottom of the screen.  You may be inside a narrative that prompts you
 to hit the space bar to continue, like this screen.

 Now when you are ready, you can hit the space bar and be transported
 to where the story begins.  When you do, this introduction will be
 cleared from your window.  Remember; "help" will bring up a separate
 banner window with a sample list of options.

 SPECIAL NOTICE: To my best estimate this intro is about 15% of the
 story as it will eventually be, and it is intended for the IF
 IntroComp only.  The submission consists of 7 rooms, several objects,
 but no NPCs.  When you reach Part II of the story the narrative stops
 mid-stride, but you can go back and forth to discover more of the
 content, for as long as you like.  My apologies in advance for all
 those bugs and other ugliness that is bound to crop up.

 Kathrel








 You are transported through time and imagination to a dark and cold
 place, and you slowly become aware of your surroundings.  In
 particular a most annoying voice:

 "Time and time again the world has developed through the opposition of
 new ideas against old ones," someone says.  "It is an ageless war
 where the old ways are bound to lose on the trivial grounds that
 victory inevitably is defined by the survivors.  And in its widest
 sense the core of progress is to act in the interest of self
 preservation."

 The words seem to drone meaningless and disembodied around in your
 mind, uttered from afar, or perhaps remembered.  Somehow they seem
 important.  You are not really sure why; right now rest holds more
 appeal than lectures.  But the churning wont't stop;

 Conflict.  Progress.  Self preservation.  Duty.  It goes on and on.

 "Go to hell," you think, but the thought appears automatic and without
 context.

 A loud clatter from somewhere nearby makes you start, and the movement
 provokes a wave of nausea.  You curl up and retch emptily with your
 face down into trampled grass, and agony explodes inside your chest
 with sudden brutality.


 Self preservation.

 You open your eyes again, recognizing that self preservation as a
 practical excercise drives home a much harder lesson than a lecture.

 Part I

 Version 0.5, an IntroComp contribution.


 A swath of downtrodden grass (lying on the ground)
 The sky is dark and chasing clouds are gathering into black mountains
 defined by the blinking stars they blot out as they build.  Cold wind
 puts a vast ocean of surrounding grass into swaying motion.  The moon
 is up, and its bleak presence reveals a grotesque scene: Wooden debris
 is scattered across a swath of partly downtrodden grass.  Clothes are
 trampled into the dirt.  A looming silhouette turns out to be a broken
 stage coach, tilting towards you on three wheels.  The missing wheel
 is nowhere in sight.  A body hangs out of a window next to an open
 door swinging in the wind, and suitcases and bags are lying around,
 open, their contents spilled on the ground.

 The grass is trampled in a corridor to the north, outlining a track of
 sorts.

 You grit your teeth; your rib cage feels like a conflagration, and
 something is wrong with your right leg.

 A long cut runs across your right tigh.  Judging from the clotted blod
 on your pants it bled profusely.

 The coach door whines quietly as it swings on its hinges, occasionally
 accentuated by a clatter as a particular strong gust of wind pushes it
 against the coach wall.

 The door is already open.

 The coach door whines quietly as the wind makes it swing on its
 hinges.

 The wagon is a large, built-in stage coach with doors and windows.
 The roof has cramps bolted to it and a low railing runs all the way
 around it.  A piece of black material is stuck in the railing,
 flapping in the wind.  The driver seat is outdoor, placed a little
 lower than the roof so that the front wagon wall becomes its backrest
 and provides a little shelter.  Its front axle is broken, and the left
 front wheel is missing.

 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

 Its hard to make out any details from down here, but it could be a
 coat.

 accentuated by a clatter as a particular strong gust of wind pushes it

 The coach door whines quietly as the wind makes it swing on its

 The agony in your ribs is bothering you.  The cut in your thigh isn't
 making things any better either.

 The word "yeah" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points
 out an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your
 next command.)

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing, and are wearing some clothes: a pair of
 shoes, a pair of pants, and a shirt.


 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

>examine me
 Your skin is pale and dirty, and the knuckles on your right hand are
 bloody.  A pale mark encloses your right ring finger at the base,
 obviously a ring used to be there.  The dull ache that throbs in every
 joint and limb doesn't quite drown out the burning sensation around
 your chest.  By the feel of it several ribs might just be broken.  You
 realize that you are cold.  Very cold.  With this realization comes a
 reflex jerk as your body attempts to curl up to preserve body heat,
 and in response the movement sends jolts of agony from your right leg
 to your brain.

 The coach door whines quietly as it swings on its hinges, occasionally
 accentuated by a clatter as a particular strong gust of wind pushes it
 against the coach wall.

 It would probably be a good idea to find some warm clothes.

>examine cut
 The cut is long, but shallow, and it doesn't bleed anymore.  The edges
 are clean, almost as if it was a knife or a sword wound.

>take black material
 You can't reach it from down here.

>examine clothes
 Most of the clothing are mens' clothes.  Shirts, socks, a tie, pants
 and a torn cloak and a ruined coat as well.  There's a shawl here too,
 a dress, panties, and at least one stocking is in clear sight.

 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

>get up
 You get up with some difficulty.

 The coach door whines quietly as the wind makes it swing on its
 hinges.
 You shiver from the cold wind.

>take material
 You can't reach it from down here.

>take coat
 You see no coat here.

>take shawl
 The word "shawl" is not necessary in this story.

 You can't reach it from down here.

>examine body
>search clothing
 A man in his thirties perhaps, slight, and well clad, but his eyes
 stare into eternity with no means to convey what they see.  The limbs
 are stiffening, suggesting that he has been dead for some hours.  The
 cause of death is obvious... a clean cut across his throat.

 The word "clothing" is not necessary in this story.

>take clothes
 You can't take that.

>take coat
 You see no coat here.

>black
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>examine black
 You see no black here.

>examine black material
 Its hard to make out any details from down here, but it could be a
 coat.

 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

>enter driver's seat
 You see no seat here.

>examine coach
 The wagon is a large, built-in stage coach with doors and windows.
 The roof has cramps bolted to it and a low railing runs all the way
 around it.  A piece of black material is stuck in the railing,
 flapping in the wind.  The driver seat is outdoor, placed a little
 lower than the roof so that the front wagon wall becomes its backrest
 and provides a little shelter.  Its front axle is broken, and the left
 front wheel is missing.

 You limp over and push yourself into the coaches' dark interior.

 The interior of a broken stage coach
 The inside of the wagon is very dark, and the floor tilts in a steep
 angle toward the front left side.  A lifeless body hangs out of a
 window.  Padded seats face each other with just enough place to store
 small bags under them, and over the seats a shelf runs along the wall.
 A laced umbrella juts out from the shelf in the front right corner,
 and an embroidered bag is stuck under the same seat.  Otherwise the
 coach is empty.  The windowpanes on both sides are broken.

 The bag is made of cloth, embroidered with tiny stitches in a floral
 pattern.  It has been turned inside out, and nothing remains inside.

 The chill saps your strength; you need warmer clothes.

 (out of the the interior of a broken stage coach)
 You step out of the coach.

 A swath of downtrodden grass
 The sky is dark and chasing clouds are gathering into black mountains
 defined by the blinking stars they blot out as they build.  Cold wind
 puts a vast ocean of surrounding grass into swaying motion.  The moon
 is up, and its bleak presence reveals a grotesque scene: Wooden debris
 is scattered across a swath of partly downtrodden grass.  Clothes are
 trampled into the dirt.  A looming silhouette turns out to be a broken
 stage coach, tilting towards you on three wheels.  The missing wheel
 is nowhere in sight.  A body hangs out of a window next to an open
 door swinging in the wind, and suitcases and bags are lying around,
 open, their contents spilled on the ground.

 The grass is trampled in a corridor to the north, outlining a track of
 sorts.


 The coach door whines quietly as the wind makes it swing on its
 hinges.

>go up
 You use the door as step and groan from the agony in your chest as you
 heave yourself onto the coach roof.

 The tilting roof of a stage coach
 The roof tilts precariously to the southeast and you have to struggle
 to keep your balance.  The railing around the sides provides a
 convenient handhold just as it once served to keep bags and suitcases
 securely in place.  From this elevated position you can see further
 around, but all you see in the flickering moonlight is the grassy
 plain, stretching in all directions.

 A piece of black material is stuck in the railing, flapping in the
 wind.

 What do you want to enter?

>take material
 You take the material.

>take coat
 You are already carrying the material.  You shiver from the cold wind.

>wear coat
 Much to your relief you feel the coat take the sting out of the wind
 as you button it up.

>examine coat
 It is a thick, woolen, coat.  The double seams and inside lining shows
 its quality.  It has a single row of buttons down front, with big
 outside pockets.

 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

>examine pockets
 The pockets are roomy with ample room to warm your hands, or to carry
 stuff around.

>look in pockets
 The pocket contains an envelope.

 The windchill is uncomfortable, and you shrink into the coat as well
 as you can.

>take envelope. x it.
 You get the envelope from the pocket.

 The envelope has a formal look, and the adress is:
    Ms. Dabowe
    Great Plains Lighthouse
 The envelope is sealed.

 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

 The coach isn't important.
 Coat notwithstanding, it seems like an increasingly good idea to take
 what little shelter you can inside the coach, and wait for dawn.

 Your memory floods back; you received the envelope the very same
 evening you ran into professor Asunac in the university square, the
 day you took your step toward liberation, in earnest.  You recall the
 place, the smell, the din of voices enveloping you and the sense of
 being on the edge of adventure.

 You were looking for Charles in the crowded pub and saw him beckon
 from a dim corner table with two of your drinking buddies from
 Astronomy; "Mark?  Where the hell have you been?"

 "Sorry guys.  Damn Ass-unac stopped me on the way."  Your friends
 laughed and pushed you into a chair.  "Here."  A beer magically
 appeared before you, and you downed half of it before looking up.

 "He's going to flunk me."

 "Shit, Mark, I don't get it.  You have everything... why are you
 wasting it?"  It was Charles, of course.  Your best friend and
 wingman; smart, sensible and just a little bit brutal about it.

 Your reply was drowned by the wind slamming the door shut behind a
 customer and Charles cursed.

 "Sorry guys, I have to go."He was clearly annoyed.

 "Hey, why so soon?"  It was Sandy to your right, asking.

 "The harbor master assigned me an apprentice at the lighthouse.  I'm
 not allowed to let him handle the machinery alone if the weather gets
 rough."  Charles looked apologetically at you and said something that
 was drowned in more clatter from the door.

 He pushed an envelope across the table.

 "Here.  Like I said.  Drop by my place soon, I've got stuff I need to
 show you."

 "You guys are thick as thieves," Sandy commented.  "Cheers for new
 beginnings!"

 "To new beginnings!"

 They had all toasted to that, and then the evening took it's usual
 course ending with you showing up somewhere you oughtn't be the next
 morning, and with no assignment to show for professor Asunac.

 You see no bag here.

>look
 The tilting roof of a stage coach
 The roof tilts precariously to the southeast and you have to struggle
 to keep your balance.  The railing around the sides provides a
 convenient handhold just as it once served to keep bags and suitcases
 securely in place.  From this elevated position you can see further
 around, but all you see in the flickering moonlight is the grassy
 plain, stretching in all directions.


 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

>go down
 You painfully climb down, using the door as steps.

 Swath of downtrodden grass
 The sky is dark and chasing clouds are gathering into black mountains
 defined by the blinking stars they blot out as they build.  The
 blowing wind puts a vast ocean of surrounding grass into swaying
 motion.  The moon is up, and its bleak presence , and its chill
 presence reveals a grotesque scene; Wooden debris is scattered across
 a swath of partly downtrodden grass.  The looming silhouette of the
 broken wagon tilts away from you on its three wheels.  The missing
 wheel is nowhere in sight, but a dead horse with a broken leg lies
 next to the wagon.  It is still in its harness, but three other
 harnesses lie on the ground around it.

>in
 (first opening the door)
 You limp over and haul yourself up into the coaches' dark interior.

 The interior of a broken stage coach
 The inside of the wagon is very dark, and the floor tilts in a steep
 angle toward the front left side.  A lifeless body hangs out of a
 window.  Padded seats face each other with just enough place to store
 small bags under them, and over the seats a shelf runs along the wall.
 A laced umbrella juts out from the shelf in the front right corner,
 and an embroidered bag is stuck under the same seat.  Otherwise the
 coach is empty.  The windowpanes on both sides are broken.


 You feel exhausted.

>take bag
 You can't take that.


 You realize that the coach is your best choice for the night, but
 consider it with mixed feelings.  The chilly wind makes the outside a
 bad choice.

>open bag
 That is not something you can open.  Enough.  Under the circumstances
 you'll just have to suffer the company of the dead man.

>take umbrella
 You can't take that.

 The relief from being out of the wind and behind the relative security
 of walls makes you sit down on the seat. Your body, almost as if by
 its own volition then slumps into a lying position, and all thought of
 anything but sleep is gone.

>open envelope
 You break the seal even as you realize that the letter is not for you.








 The dream started chaotically, tossing you between memories.  Then it
 seemed to gain purpose and all of a sudden it placed you somewhere you
 did not want to be:

 "Unacceptable!"  My mothers outrage was tangible, making the expensive
 earrings jingle as her head shook.  I fervently wished I had concealed
 my plans better, but no way out now.  The confrontation was a fact.  I
 felt like a naughty schoolboy caught at a prank and hauled in to stand
 to justice.  Her panelled office gave people that feeling, quite
 intentionally, no doubt.

 "You are doing no such thing!"

 The walls in the office started to wave in and out of focus.

 "I already have."  I was trying to keep my calm, but the familar
 tension had started to build somewhere down in my stomach.

 A large bell rang and the office faded out, and I was standing in a
 square looking up at the university clock tower.





 "Aahh, there you are my boy!  Did you finish the assignment on the
 Trade balance with Belgium?"  Professor Asunac's nasal voice intruded
 and made me cringe.

 "I'm sorry sir, but I attended a class at Institute of Astronomy last
 night...  I haven't finished it yet."  The professor raised his eye
 brows, but didn't comment directly.  Instead: "Does your mother know
 you are flunking classes in Buisness in favor of star gazing?"  He
 didn't even attempt to disguise his disapproval.

 Stomach tension building up again.  The sky above the clock tower
 turned into night, and the familar constellations of the Northern
 hemisphere swirled around me, impossibly fast.



 You wake with a start and blink in bewilderment for a moment before
 recalling where you are and what happened.

>look in envelope
 The envelope contains a letter.

>read letter
 (first taking the letter from the envelope)
 You smooth out the paper and start reading:

 Dear Ms Dabowe,
    I am sending this letter of introduction with my good friend Mark
 Dunne,
    who has received his first appointment as Lighthouse Manager with
 this
    assignment to the Great Plains Lighthouse.  I know that Stacangers
 harbor master
    already has notified you about the appointment, and I know that you
 will take
    as good care of him as you do of the household.  I wish to let you
 know that
    I have trained him in his duties personally, and even if he is
 inexperienced
    he has been a dilligent student and I vouch for his abilities.
    You can trust him as you would trust me.

    Your friend,
    Charles Smitherhill.
    Stacanger Lighthouse Manager

 Yes, this is the letter Charles gave you that night, and the coat must
 be the one Charles gave you so you wouldn't stand out.  Damn nice of
 him to write that letter.  Now you just have to remember what he
 showed you about the lighthouse machinery so you don't make a fool of
 yourself...  You better, but the lessons from the crash course he gave
 you doesn't quite manage to penetrate your headache right now.

 You fold the letter again and put it back into the envelope, slightly
 regretting that you broke the seal.

 A brilliant light sweeps over the coach, leaving you with a glittering
 negative image on your eyes.

>out
 (off of the seat)
 Okay, you're no longer on the seat.

>examine image
 The word "image" is not necessary in this story.

>examine light
 You see no light here.

>out
 (out of the the interior of a broken stage coach)
 You push out of the coach to the east, and dropping to the ground you
 raise the coats lapel to shield yourself from the windchill.

 Swath of downtrodden grass
 The sky is dark and chasing clouds are gathering into black mountains
 defined by the blinking stars they blot out as they build.  The
 blowing wind puts a vast ocean of surrounding grass into swaying

 broken wagon tilts away from you on its three wheels.  The missing
 wheel is nowhere in sight, but a dead horse with a broken leg lies
 next to the wagon.  It is still in its harness, but three other
 harnesses lie on the ground around it.


 The coach door whines quietly as it swings on its hinges, occasionally
 accentuated by a clatter as a particular strong gust of wind pushes it
 against the coach wall.

>examine horse
 The horse in the harness is a typical stage coach animal, sleek, well
 built, with a long strong back.  Its tan coat is dry, altough there is
 evidence of sweat under the harness.  It's front left leg is quite
 obviously broken, but what killed it is a mercy bullet to its head.

 The coach door whines quietly as the wind makes it swing on its
 hinges.

 A sudden brilliant light from the east puts the coach in stark
 silhouette, and is gone as quickly as it appeard.

>examine harnesses
 The harnesses appears to have been cut open and thrown off the animals
 that are no longer there.

 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

>take them
 The word "them" doesn't refer to anything right now.

>take harnesses
 You can't take that.

>examine suitcases
 You see no suitcases here.

>inventory
 You are carrying an envelope, and you're wearing some clothes: a pair
 of shoes, a pair of pants, a shirt, and a coat.


 A sudden brilliant light from the east puts the coach in stark
 silhouette, and is gone as quickly as it appeard.

>go east
 You limp over to the other side of the coach.

 A swath of downtrodden grass
 The sky is dark and chasing clouds are gathering into black mountains
 defined by the blinking stars they blot out as they build.  Cold wind
 puts a vast ocean of surrounding grass into swaying motion.  The moon
 is up, and its bleak presence reveals a grotesque scene: Wooden debris
 is scattered across a swath of partly downtrodden grass.  Clothes are
 trampled into the dirt.  A looming silhouette turns out to be a broken
 stage coach, tilting towards you on three wheels.  The missing wheel
 is nowhere in sight.  A body hangs out of a window next to an open
 door swinging in the wind, and suitcases and bags are lying around,
 open, their contents spilled on the ground.

 The grass is trampled in a corridor to the north, outlining a track of
 sorts.

>examine body
 A man in his thirties perhaps, slight, and well clad, but his eyes
 stare into eternity with no means to convey what they see.  The limbs
 are stiffening, suggesting that he has been dead for some hours.  The

>take body
 You can't take that.

 The coach door whines quietly as it swings on its hinges, occasionally
 accentuated by a clatter as a particular strong gust of wind pushes it
 against the coach wall.

 A beam of light from the east sweeps over the grass before it
 disappears.

>examine sky
 You appear small and insignificant compared to the vast sky with its
 shifting display of chasing clouds.

 The coach door whines quietly as the wind makes it swing on its
 hinges.

>examine lighthouse
 You see no lighthouse here.

>go east
 You decide to follow the lightbeam in the hopes of finding somebody
 that can help in the other end.  If your luck have taken a turn for
 the better this is the powerful beam of the Great Plains Lighthouse.

   You set off into the dark, a little uneasy.  Packs of wolves are not
 unheard of on the plain, not to mention bandits and the like.
 Limping, you trudge on, determined to make it through the night.

 Slowly, almost unnoticeable in the start, the stars start to pale and
 the sky begins to turn a lighter shade of gray.  Dawn arrives, and its
 bleak light reveals what your hoped for, a towering lighthouse
 stretching toward the sky like an admonishing finger.  Relief wash
 over you as you finally totter into a courtyard and hear the sound of
 gravel crunch under your feet.

 CLOSED CIRCLES
 Part II

 The courtyard of a lighthouse
 A lighthouse teethering on the edge of a tall cliff rises defiantly
 into the air.  Its weathered white wash is covered by a thin layer of
 gray salt, making it look dingey and old.  Behind it to the east an
 ocean stretches out into a blue haze where the rolling waves meet the
 gray sky above.  Beyond boulders to the west a wide open expanse of
 plains stretches as far as you can see, using a palette of green and
 amber, making it an ocean of a different sort.  A patch of gravel
 serves as a courtyard and is fenced in by the two wings of the
 lighthouse, sensibly shielding it from the brunt of the weather.

 Shrill shrieks from the seagulls sailing on the wind above pierce the
 constant din of waves breaking on the beach far below the cliff.

 Far to the west a flock of birds circle over a fixed spot in the
 plain.

>examine flock
 The word "flock" is not necessary in this story.

>examine lighthouse
 The lighthouse seems quite old, but it could be that the exposed
 position between the sky, the sea and the plains stretching out to the
 east weathers the paint quickly.  A daring seagull swoops down with an
 angry shriek.

>in
 (first opening the front door)

 Hallway
 The hallway is narrow and dusty, but well lit due to the tall window
 to the east.  Old paint comes off the rough wooden walls, and the
 ceiling once white, now has a gray layer of salt on it.  A few pegs
 have been hammered into the wall next to the main door and serve as a
 simple place to hang a coat.  Two doors stand shoulder to shoulder on
 the west wall, and another is next to the window on the east wall.  To
 the south, a stairwell with spindly stairs leads straight up.

 An old cloak lies on the floor, partly covering an old boot,
 apparently having slipped off its peg.

>examine cloak
 The cloak is made of black oiled cloth, of the kind fishermen use when
 they are out in stormy weather.  It is stiff from salt and full of
 sand.

>take cloak
 You take the cloak.  You pick up the cloak and give it a shake,
 spraying fine sand all over yourself in the process.

>examine boot
 The boot has obviously seen better days.  Its dirty sole is partly
 coming off.

>take sole
 The word "sole" is not necessary in this story.

>take boot
 As you pick up the boot you hear something jingle inside.  You take
 the old boot.

 That is not something you can open.

>look in boot
 The old boot contains a key.

>examine key
 The key is quite small and made of dull metal.  The key head is
 circular so it can be fitted onto a key ring.

>take key
 You take the key.

>look
 Hallway
 The hallway is narrow and dusty, but well lit due to the tall window
 to the east.  Old paint comes off the rough wooden walls, and the
 ceiling once white, now has a gray layer of salt on it.  A few pegs
 have been hammered into the wall next to the main door and serve as a
 simple place to hang a coat.  Two doors stand shoulder to shoulder on
 the west wall, and another is next to the window on the east wall.  To
 the south, a stairwell with spindly stairs leads straight up.

>call out
 The word "call" is not necessary in this story.

>say "hello"
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>examine east door
 You see no east door here.

>put cloak on peg
 You can't put that on the peg.

>examine cloak
 The cloak is made of black oiled cloth, of the kind fishermen use when
 they are out in stormy weather.

>pull peg
 The peg cannot be moved.

>push peg
 The peg cannot be moved.

>look
 Hallway
 The hallway is narrow and dusty, but well lit due to the tall window
 to the east.  Old paint comes off the rough wooden walls, and the
 ceiling once white, now has a gray layer of salt on it.  A few pegs
 have been hammered into the wall next to the main door and serve as a
 simple place to hang a coat.  Two doors stand shoulder to shoulder on
 the west wall, and another is next to the window on the east wall.  To
 the south, a stairwell with spindly stairs leads straight up.

>go east
 You can't go that way.  Obvious exits lead south; west; and out, back
 to courtyard.

>examine door
 Which door do you mean, the main door, the right door, or the left
 door?

>main door
 It's a heavy wooden door, once painted bright white.  It's open.

>close door
 You close the main door.

>close main door
 The main door is already closed.

>examine right door
 It's been painted to match the walls, and quite narrow.  Perhaps a
 closet door of some sort.  It's closed.

>examine left door
 It's in dire need of paint, and quite narrow.  Perhaps a closet door
 of some sort.  It's closed.

>examine window
 The window is tall, reaching almost from floor to ceiling.  Its
 windowpanes are horrendously dirty, and only a pale gray light filters
 in through the thick layer of salt covering the outside.  The
 windowsill is extremely dusty and full of dead flies.

>windowsill
 The word "windowsill" is not necessary in this story.

>examine windowsill
 The word "windowsill" is not necessary in this story.

>examine south
 You see nothing remarkable to the south.

>go south
 A dark stairwell
 A stair rises straight up through a hole in the ceiling, winding about
 a center pole that is as thick as a tree.  There's a railing on the
 outside of the steps all the way up.  It looks like a rickety
 structure, but both steps and railing seems worn from long use, so it
 must be reasonably secure.  It is quite dark.  The light from the
 rooms to the south and north shine through, but this room has no light
 source of its own.

>go north
 Hallway
 The hallway is narrow and dusty, but well lit due to the tall window
 to the east.  Old paint comes off the rough wooden walls, and the
 ceiling once white, now has a gray layer of salt on it.  A few pegs
 have been hammered into the wall next to the main door and serve as a
 simple place to hang a coat.  Two doors stand shoulder to shoulder on
 the west wall, and another is next to the window on the east wall.  To
 the south, a stairwell with spindly stairs leads straight up.

>go south
 A dark stairwell
 A stair rises straight up through a hole in the ceiling, winding about
 a center pole that is as thick as a tree.  There's a railing on the
 outside of the steps all the way up.  It looks like a rickety
 structure, but both steps and railing seems worn from long use, so it
 must be reasonably secure.  It is quite dark.  The light from the
 rooms to the south and north shine through, but this room has no light
 source of its own.

 You can't go that way.  The only obvious exit leads north, back to A
 narrow hallway.

 The courtyard of a lighthouse
 A lighthouse teethering on the edge of a tall cliff rises defiantly
 into the air.  Its weathered white wash is covered by a thin layer of
 gray salt, making it look dingey and old.  Behind it to the east an
 ocean stretches out into a blue haze where the rolling waves meet the
 gray sky above.  Beyond boulders to the west a wide open expanse of
 plains stretches as far as you can see, using a palette of green and
 amber, making it an ocean of a different sort.  A patch of gravel
 serves as a courtyard and is fenced in by the two wings of the
 lighthouse, sensibly shielding it from the brunt of the weather.

 Shrill shrieks from the seagulls sailing on the wind above pierce the
 constant din of waves breaking on the beach far below the cliff.

 A sudden gust of wind sends ripples of motion through the grass on the
 plain.

>swim
 The word "swim" is not necessary in this story.

>go east
 You can't go that way.  Obvious exits lead west, to tall grass; and
 in, back to A narrow hallway.  A daring seagull swoops down with an
 angry shriek.

>go west
 As you set off into the featureless plain you realize that the
 lighthouse serve as directional beacon for sea and land travel alike.

 A swath of downtrodden grass
 An overcast sky thick with chasing clouds stretches in all directions
 and closes down on the distant horizon in a haze where green blurs
 into gray.  Cold wind puts a vast ocean of surrounding grass into
 swaying motion.  The bleak daylight reveals a grotesque scene: Wooden
 debris is scattered across a swath of partly downtrodden grass.
 Clothes are trampled into the dirt.  A broken stage coach is tilting
 towards you on three wheels.  The missing wheel is nowhere in sight.
 A body hangs out of a window next to an open door swinging in the
 wind, and suitcases and bags are lying around, open, their contents
 spilled on the ground.

 The grass is trampled in a corridor to the north, outlining a track of
 sorts.

>go north
 You limp north along the track.

 Track through the grass
 An overcast sky thick with chasing clouds stretches in all directions
 and closes down on the distant horizon in a haze where green blurs
 into gray.  The blowing wind puts the vast ocean of surrounding grass
 into swaying motion, and trampled grass reveals that a coach and
 horses went past this way not long ago for sure.  Strange though,
 because there are no sign of a road, or even a path.

 A wooden chest lies on the side, halfway hidden by the grass.

>examine chest
 The chest is undamaged, and its lid is closed and locked with a heavy
 padlock.  It is made of wood, with iron casting along its edges.
 Maybe that's why it made the fall from the coach without breaking.
 It's closed.

>open chest
 The wooden chest seems to be locked.

>unlock chest
 What do you want to unlock it with?

>key
 The key doesn't look suitable for unlocking that.

>unlock padlock with key
 The word "padlock" is not necessary in this story.

>take chest
 You take the wooden chest.

>go north
 You realize that you are in the middle of nowhere with no sense of
 direction.  Better stay within sight of the coach.

>shake chest like a Christmas present
 The word "shake" is not necessary in this story.

 You limp south along the track.

 The rustle of grass bowing to the wind is everywhere.

>search body
 You overcome your aversion and search through the body looking for
 anything that can identify the traveller, but no such luck.  He
 doesn't even have a pen knife.  Obviously whoever caused his death
 beat you to the search.

 The coach door whines quietly as the wind makes it swing on its
 hinges.

>search clothes
 You rummage through the tattered clothes, but what you find is either
 torn or too flimsy to be of any use.

 The coach door whines quietly as it swings on its hinges, occasionally
 accentuated by a clatter as a particular strong gust of wind pushes it
 against the coach wall.

>search pockets
 You see nothing unusual in the pocket.

>look under coach
 You see nothing unusual under the broken stage coach.

>in
 You limp over and push yourself into the coaches' dark interior.

 The interior of a broken stage coach
 The inside of the wagon is very dark, and the floor tilts in a steep
 angle toward the front left side.  A lifeless body hangs out of a
 window.  Padded seats face each other with just enough place to store
 small bags under them, and over the seats a shelf runs along the wall.
 A laced umbrella juts out from the shelf in the front right corner,
 and an embroidered bag is stuck under the same seat.  Otherwise the
 coach is empty.  The windowpanes on both sides are broken.

>search bag
 There's nothing unusual in the bag.

>search seats
 You see nothing on the seat.

 You are carrying an envelope; some clothes: a cloak and an old boot; a
 key; and a wooden chest.  You're wearing some clothes: a pair of
 shoes, a pair of pants, a shirt, and a coat.

>examine shelf
 This is a typical hat shelf, and it wouldn't hold anything large.  It
 is just big enough to hold the few personal items that would be
 covenient to have at hand over a long trip.

>open seat
 That is not something you can open.

>examine laced umbrellas
 The word "laced" is not necessary in this story.

>examine umbrella
 The umbrella is purple, and judging from the frills and lace it looks
 more like a sun shield than anything suited to keep bad weather at
 bay.

 The word "lift" is not necessary in this story.

 The seat cannot be moved.

>open seat
 That is not something you can open.

>think about me

>think about envelope
 You muse about it for a bit, but reach no conclusions.

>think about lighthouse
 Your destiny lies ahead of you in the shape of your new position as
 lighthouse manager at the Great Plains Lighthouse, you are sure.  Far
 away from your mother, the family company and business studies.  The
 whole sky above you and the perfect vantage point for studying the
 stars.  You are looking forward to it with an anticipation that is
 only slightly checked by your anxiety regarding the actual job.  But
 how hard can it be...?  According to Charles it's all a breeze.

>about
 Welcome to the IF story "Closed Circles".

 Before heading into the story there are a few things to be mentioned
 to help you get the richest possible experience of the tale.

 You will enter the story as a story character, free (within limits) to
 interact with the elements of the story and the story world.  Your
 story character - the protagonist - will come with ideas, a personal
 history, and a general outlook on life that you may not agree with,
 but which you cannot alter.  You as a reader are invited to accompany
 this character and to an extent decide his actions.  You will be
 challenged, both as the story character and as a reader to make up
 your mind about what is going on, and what is the appropriate response
 to what the protagonist experiences.

 If you at any time wish to be reminded of the most common ways of
 interacting with the story (commands that are available to you) you
 can type "help" to bring up a separate banner window with a static
 list of options.  There will be other ways of interacting with the
 story too, but it is up to you to find them.  Pay attention to what
 the story suggest that you do.  That way you will be pointed in the
 right direction.

 "About" will show you this introduction.  "Credits" will give you the
 acknowledgments of the game.  If nothing you type bring any reactions
 from the window, take a glance at the status bar at the bottom of the
 screen.  You may be inside a narrative that prompts you to hit the
 space bar to continue, like this screen.

 Remember; "help" will bring up a separate banner window with a sample
 list of options.

>think about charles
 It was Charles who provided the miracle that let you escape the
 choking chains of family duty.  Great friend.  The two of you had made
 many a narrow escape from whatever insanity either of you had gotten
 into.  A few years your elder and coming from nowhere to his position
 Charles had the brain smart to back his street smart, and more street
 smart than anybody else you knew.

 Betrayal. It tastes bitter in your mouth. Your neck is still itching
 where the death-blow struck. The part of you that is called "Wiseguy"
 objects that you don't have a neck. Technically, that's correct.

 Let's take inventory, shall we? You have: a head, and a one metre long
 tail sprouting out from the selfsame head where the rest of your body
 used to be. That's it.

 Your mental condition has cycled between catatonic, delusional, raging
 and weeping for you don't know how long. Right now is one of your
 clearer moments.

 It's a bright day, literally. Or at least it's not as dark as your
 average day. You see, sometimes when the constellation of some shiny
 junk, the stars and whatnot is just right, a feeble ray of light finds
 its way into your godforsaken pit. You fancy the light somehow
 strengthens you. You also fancy your tail is growing longer every
 day/hour/year/other useless measurement of time. Cell by cell for
 cell...

 Octagonal Pit
 The pit is just large enough to comfortably pace around, as far as you
 can do that with your humble assortment of extremities. All compass
 directions lead to nothing but towering grey walls. That's right,
 there's no exit, except maybe up. A slight draft hints that there must
 be an opening somewhere above. The walls just have to end somewhere.

 A feeble ray of light comes glistening down, painting a shifting
 pattern on the humid floor.

 You feel on the edge of starvation. You've felt this way since you
 woke up in this chamber. But you don't starve. Time has no meaning
 here. What is this, some obscure Buddhist hell?

>examine me

 You can't see much of yourself, so you have to rely on your body
 sense: It feels as if you once had more appendages. It feels very
 awkward to move your tail. The connection between your head and tail
 feels flat-out wrong.

>examine head

 feels like a skull thinly wrapped in wrinkled skin.

 A green ball of light drops into your pit. It is zipping back and
 forth at a dazzling speed. You're having trouble focusing on something
 so fast.

 There, it stopped for a second: You see a green, iridescent carapace,
 six legs, antennae... the carapace opens, revealing wings. It is a
 beetle.

 in your tail.

 Slowly, inch for inch, you pull the beetle into your mouth. Its
 helplessly beating wings tickle your face. Finally, it is in what
 counts as your stomach. You feel a flurry of bites from inside. You
 seize up.

 The thing must die. Your belly gurgles.

 Synthesizing such a volume of acid screws up your weak metabolism big
 time. You faint, but just as you do you feel the carapace give in and
 dissolve. There will be food....

 Yes. This is definitely preferable to starving.

 More beetles have stumbled into your pit over time. You didn't catch
 them all, but you've become quite adept at hunting them. Hide - wait -
 pounce - eat. Your conscious mind has taken a back seat for a while.

 A short time ago, you did something important. You don't quite

 accomplishment.

 You rest now. For the first time in ages you truly rest.

 Rusted Dome
 Thousands of octagonal pits are arranged around you in a neat
 geometrical pattern. One of them was yours - you're not sure if you
 could find it again in the uniform masses - but that doesn't matter
 any more.

 A huge metal dome is overarching the whole room. It is ancient and
 rusty; light is seeping in through a series of cracks in the ceiling.

 A towering door is embedded in the east wall.

 A peculiar piece of metal is stuck in the dome near the floor - a
 clawed arm.

 Transport Corridor
 Decrepit light bulbs drench this spacious east-west tunnel in a sickly
 yellow light. The walls and ceiling are stained with large patches of
 corroded metal. Most of the floor is taken in by a wide conveyor belt,
 with only small walkways on either side.

 A glinting heap of scrap metal is piled up near the eastern end of the
 corridor.

 There's something next to the scrap heap - a lizard is cowering there,
 eyeing the silver shreds suspiciously. Its scales camouflage it almost
 perfectly against the rough walls. Casually, without any sign of
 surprise, its scaly head rises towards you.

 You shouldn't be able to interpret a lizard's facial expression, but
 somehow you do. The look it shoots you is one of close scrutiny.

 Your gazes lock for a moment, then the lizard's attention wanders back
 to the scrap heap.

>examine lizard

 The corridor ends at a t-junction, separating into two smaller tunnels
 running north and south. Both tunnels have conveyor belts over the

 tunnel's conveyor is running at maximum speed to yank whatever is put

 Lookout Point
 The tunnel ends here abruptly, as if it snapped in two. You stand at
 its fringed edge, facing a vast dark sky, overlooking a grey
 wasteland.

 This is the first time you see the world outside. You are far up on a
 mountain; your view of the stars is almost unobstructed by things like
 atmosphere. Far below you, a storm is brewing over a wooded crater
 filled with roiling, writhing fog.

 Mixed with the howling wind, cries of primal creatures are carried to
 you through the thin air. Your heart speeds up. You wish to walk among
 them, tearing and rending. You wish for claws.

 You try to lie down as flat as you possibly can while a set of blades
 moves in your direction. Rusty teeth rend at your scalp, but an
 anxious second later you are through with only minor lacerations.

 Two meters of conveyor later, you are dropped into a gaping hole in
 the floor. The world gets dark abruptly as you slide down some sort of
 chute cut into raw stone. The abrasive surface starts ripping the
 flesh from your bones. You cannot stop. The pain gets worse with every
 metre of bloodied rock.

 A faint light shoots towards you from below. Cool air embraces you as
 you enter free fall. The breeze alleviates the hurt a little.

 A dim greenish glow comes ever closer. Then you hit something.

 You pick yourself up from a pool of crusted blood on the cool stone

 Hunger is back with a vengeance.

 the back of the throat. Black spots are dancing before your eyes. Your
 stomach cramps. You are about to throw up, but your throat just blocks
 it. It is heavily swollen. Your scalp tingles.

 You shudder, and the shudder intensifies into uncontrolled spasms. You
 find yourself on the floor, throwing yourself around, cringing in
 pain. As your body locks in a full on cramp, you see a pair of scaly
 feet directly in front of your eyes. You again.

 It is hard to describe the feeling of poison working its way through
 your organs, leaving swaths of dead or dying tissue behind. Your body
 is working on its limits to keep from flatlining. But it lives. It

 Euphoric, you eat some more of the venomous fungi. This causes some
 more cramps, but they are nowhere as severe as before. You eat some
 more, only vaguely conscious of the savage grin on your face.

 lie before you. A plethora of sensation assaults your brain: the
 chilly draft, full of moisture. The smell of algae. The sound of
 running water. The rustling of unknown creatures.

 Overjoyed, you set out to hunt.

 In front of docking hatch A12
 Like many grand endeavours, it begins with you waiting for your ship
 to arrive. Standing with your two pairs of arms crossed in front of
 docking hatch A12, watching the depth of space. Waiting for your ride
 into battle.

 Staring through the narrow armoured window you go through inventory
 lists and ingredients that need to be restocked for the hundredth
 time. Just in case the galaxy decides not to go down in flames over
 the next few days. Just a pipe dream.

 A silver dot separates from the Grand Curve - the crystalline belt
 among the nearest planet, not the bar - and grows rapidly in front of
 your eyes. They are here.

 Thankfully most of the docking procedure is automated. Only the truly
 desperate or foolish are still around.

 Docking hatch A12 opens with a hydraulic scream.

 "Out of my way, D'heg." D'heg - herbivore, cattle. Most likely used in
 a derogatory way here. The speaker, a hard-bodied Scoiar, is
 shouldering her way past you. The look on her face might make a
 granite slab flinch.

 Another Scoiar smiles at you from the open hatch and waves you closer.

 "Please don't mind my sister's manners. She's trying to work up a
 rage, for the Wrathblade.

 1) "What's a Wrathblade?"

 2) "Now who are you?"

 3) "It's all right. I'm Khemgi."

>1
 they're exceedingly rare these days. Basically, a Wrathblade draws on
 the wielders anger and hate to generate destructive power. Most of the
 time, a Wrathblade looks just like a small crystal dagger, but when
 the wielder is really pissed, the blade becomes larger and more
 powerful. When a Wrathblade is fuelled with true righteous fury, it
 can cut anything. Or so the elders say."

 1) "What's your name?"

 2) "I'm Khemgi."

>1
 Kluster. The angry one that just rushed past you is my sister Moera.
 You must be Khemgi. I take it you're with us?"

 "I am."

 "Listen, we don't know exactly in how much trouble Xiar's people are.
 Things could get pretty hairy. So if you'd prefer to stay here..."

 1) "There's not much of a choice, really. If we don't fight now, we'll
 soon have nothing worth fighting for."

 2) "The Great Mother wants me to join you, so I do."

 3) "I'm actually pretty scared, but I'll do my best."

>3
 it. Anyway, welcome to the crew!"

 After you've exchanged some awkward looks with Kaya, the angry Scoiar
 - Moera - returns. Her mood definitely hasn't improved.

 "Where's the owner of that shitty bar?" she hisses. "I need a drink,
 dammit!"

 1) "Hey, you're still pissed! Good."

 2) "That would be me, then."

 3) (slip her a bottle of liquor) "Don't tell anybody."

 4) (ignore her)

>4

 "OK, let's get the weapons on board", Kaya says. "Khemgi, would you
 lend me a hand here please?"


 Please press SPACE to continue.








 Halfway to Xiar's Kluster
 Kaya points at the crate of slug throwers. "We need to get a few of
 those ready. We don't have a lot of weapons ourselves."

 You start to unpack and load a few of them and distribute them among
 the crew.

 "Have you ever used one of those? I mean, I've played some holo-games,
 but that's not the same thing, is it?", Kaya asks.

 1) "A game can't teach you what it's like to kill."

 2) "A game can't teach you how to kill."

 3) "Sure it's the same. I know how to load, aim, shoot... I'll show
 you!"

 200 klicks from Xiar's Kluster
 Moera emerges from the cockpit. "Everybody listen up! This is now
 officially a combat mission. We've just received a distress call from
 Xiar's Kluster. They are in deep trouble."

 "It looks like a bad case of Machine infestation. The outbreak must
 have been triggered by our approach. The Machines are trying to take
 over the colony before clean supplies and weapons arrive. All docked
 spacecraft are infected and unusable. The people of the Kluster are
 being slaughtered!"

 1) "Machine infestation?

 2) "Why are the ships unusable?"

>2
 hatches at all, or they'll self-destruct soon after the start. I've
 seen it happen."

 1) "Machine infestation?

>1
 their own accord, guns don't fire at all or go off in the wrong
 moment, doors smash people... It's a nightmare. In our colony..."

 She hesitates. Her face is tense.

 "We had a fully computerized security system. Autoturrets and cameras
 everywhere. We thought we were safe. But then..."

 "First the guns just went amok, but then they developed a system for
 the killing. We were herded like cattle, driven by some animated
 Exosuits. Some of the suits had dead bodies in them. They prodded the
 survivors into the airlocks..."

 "Maybe they were out of ammunition at the time. At least that's what
 we were hoping when we made our attack. Can you imagine the
 helplessness? Not being able to use all the stuff you took for granted
 all your life? We were down to using sticks and stones against
 Exosuits! They feel no pain, no nothing. It took ten of us to down a
 single one of those bastards..."

 1) "How did you survive?"

>1
 tubes, but we hid in the nooks and crannies. Then the spiders came for
 us..."

 "They decimated us slowly. I can't remember much, I must have been
 mostly... gone or something. Finally your people came and pulled me
 out of my hiding place screaming and kicking. They'd cleared the place
 from the Machines."

 "Nobody should have to suffer this."



 Please press SPACE to continue.








 Approach to Xiar's Kluster
 The pilot's voice blares out of the intercom.

 "Attention! We've got new orders!

 The elders have decided to abandon the colony. Our main priority will
 be the colony's Warrior Seed. We dock, get the seed, cram as many
 survivors into our ship as possible, and make a run for it."

 You and Kaya look at each other.

 1) "They have a Warrior Seed too?"

>1
 hope into Xiar's. The spirit in the Kluster's seed must be really
 bad-ass, according to the legends I've been told."

 1) "I know how our seed was lost."

 2) "Tell me about the spirit of Xiar's Seed."


 1) "I gave it to a human. He failed."

 2) "I gave it to a human. He tried his best, but he was badly wounded
 in battle. I trust he's still fighting hard for us."

>2

 1) "Tell me about the spirit of Xiar's Seed."

>1
 a proper name too, but everybody just called her that. She was one of
 the greatest generals in the Starbirth Empire. During the Rebellion,
 she executed whole planets for treason. Everybody feared her, friends
 and enemies alike, but she was absolutely loyal to the Emperor. She
 was like his bloodhound."

 "But the times were hard, so they had to use her, right? I mean, she's
 killed scores of enemies with her own hands. Her army was
 unstoppable!"

 "But I don't envy the poor soul that merges with her. It must be an
 exceptional individual to contain this spirit and keep it in check."

 1) "How did the World Flayer die?"

 2) "Do we have a candidate for the Seed?"

>1
 in the midst of battle. One of the World Flayer's own warriors."

 1) "Do we have a candidate for the Seed?"

>1
 others. We've never seen a Madagakkur or Scoiar survive a merge. I
 don't know how humans take it. Our best guess would be to find one of
 the old race. The Great Mother will know."

  The pilot's voice again. "The sky around the Kluster is clear. No
 spacecraft around. No signs of regular Machine troops.".

 "OK, they've managed to get a docking port open. A group of Kluster
 people is rushing to meet us there. They have the Seed!"

 "Screw the regular docking routine. Brace yourselves; this is gonna be
 rough!

 You've grown.

 You've fed.

 You've become the scourge of this little section of caves. The top of
 the food chain.

 But you don't grow any more. The bugs and mushrooms and fish no longer
 satiate you. You need bigger prey.

 Time to quit playing it safe. You cannot get any better prepared than
 this.

 Collapsed Bridge
 The rock is getting thin where you're standing right now. Your fingers
 and toes are clinging tightly to a giant limestone needle pointing
 northwest. At some point in the past, this might have been part of a
 natural bridge that would have lead to further hunting grounds. Now it
 just ends at a thin point in mid-air above a raging underground
 torrent.

 Fingers? You finally have some. You can also walk on two legs if you
 take the effort. Not that it's been of much use yet. And still no
 claws.

 The inky stream below generates a deafening noise, distorted and
 amplified by the sheer canyon walls. On the opposite side of the rift,
 you can glimpse some nooks and crannies in the wall. Caves maybe?

 You've regarded this point as a dead end until now. But with all other
 dead ends being really dead ends, this here is just an obstacle. It's
 time to take the leap.

>examine me
 Your front leg pair has transformed into a pair of arms with
 five-digit hands, but your tail is still present and actually comes in
 pretty handy for balancing. You skin is smooth and of a nondescript,
 slightly camouflaging grey.

>jump
 free fall seconds makes you question your wisdom, though. Your body
 stiffens. You might at least go out well-poised. And not screaming.

 The impact pushes your eyeballs into your head. Only icy water and
 bubbles around you. Good. At least the water was deep enough. The
 stream pulls you with it for a stretch before it slows down and allows
 you get your bearing again.

 Broad Stream
 The north-south torrent has slowed to a manageable pace here. The
 river is braced by steep canyon walls, so your only options are to
 follow the river or try swimming upstream.

 A series of shrieking howls cuts through the air, ping-ponging between
 the walls. They must come from somewhere above. A cave maybe?

>go north
 getting a lot stronger very quickly; You cannot overcome it. You're
 stuck to this part of the river.

>go south
 prey...

 ...and thus ends the IntroComp version of this game.

 The full version will include:
  - further body enhancements
  - wild combat action featuring our favourite four-armed barkeeper
  - a climatic battle with Wiseguy fighting for his very mind and soul
  - and much more.

>take coat
 The coats isn't important.

>go east
 As you walk to the east, you feel a tingling sensation.
 Forest
    This is a large redwood forest with large eerie and somewhat
 strange trees.  Sitting here, very much out of place, is a lamppost.

 Up the Tree
    You are sitting on the branch of a heavily-nested tree about ten
 feet above the ground.  Most of the nests are above you and out of
 reach.  The only way out of here is back down the tree.
    Sitting in the nest is an emerald that is shaped like an egg,
 probably brought here by some lonely mother bird.

 As the words fade over the lake, a silence is stilled as a long
 forgotten realm is reborn.  Elegantly, the hand of a fair lady rises
