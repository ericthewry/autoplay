 July, 1892.

 Father is off to Oxford again, and Mother's gone with him.  You know
 what that means: another day in the care of Uncle Stephen, who is nice
 but boring, and Aunt Emma, who means well but won't let you do
 anything fun.  Worst of all, it's a Sunday, which means you're sitting
 very upright in Aunt Emma's parlour, in all your stiff-starched Sunday
 best, trying to read Uncle Stephen's latest sermon about one of the
 less-interesting parts of the Bible while Aunt Emma pretends that she
 wouldn't rather be knitting and Uncle Stephen hides under a pile of
 Hebrew and Latin and Greek in his study.

 Plus, it's gloriously sunny outside, and you can smell the grass from
 in here.  It's just not fair.  All the servants have the day off
 because Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma don't believe in making people do
 any real work on Sundays, and you can bet that they -- Janet and
 Morris and Cookie, each of whom is loads more fun than Uncle Stephen
 and Aunt Emma put together -- are probably not all cooped up indoors
 in their Sunday best.

 If only there were some way you could escape....

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday Afternoon</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by Christopher Huang (originally writing as
 "Virgil Hilts")
 Release 3 / Serial number 121213 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle i">Parlour</span> (in the armchair)
 The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and
 cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in
 the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly
 claustrophobic.

 You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace.  Escape seems
 most likely either east into the hall or north into the dining room.

 From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes
 benignly down on the room.

 Aunt Emma sits by the window, dutifully reading her Bible.

>examine victoria


 Mother has a portrait just like this back home, hung in exactly the
 same place over the parlour fireplace.  Everybody you know has the
 same.  You reckon that anyone who doesn't must be a spy, a heretic, a
 foreigner, or worse.

>examine bible


 Aunt Emma's had the same Bible for as long as you've known her.  How
 she manages to keep it from getting dog-eared, given how often she
 reads it, you do not know.  Aunt Emma has it open on her lap, and you
 notice that she's using Janet's master key to mark her place.

>examine key


 The master key is usually carried by the servants, which seems a
 little ironic.  But then it's the servants who need to get into every
 nook and cranny of the house, from attic to coal cellar; normal people
 only need to get into the civilised living spaces.  Since the servants
 today are out, it's been handed over to Aunt Emma ... which still
 seems a little ironic, since she's the <span class="floydstyle em">mistress</span> of the house.

>examine emma


 Aunt Emma is Uncle Stephen's sister, one of those maiden aunts who
 always ends up chaperoning people around; which, as you understand it,
 means it's her job to make sure people don't have any fun.  You know
 she means well, really, but she takes her job much too seriously.

>examine fireplace


 The fireplace is cold this time of the year, just as it should be.
 The mantel above is, as usual, burgeoning with a million little
 ornaments.

>examine mantel


 It's one of those extraordinarily sturdy oak affairs.  Every time you
 visit, it looks as though it could not possibly hold even one more
 little ornament without collapsing; and yet, every time you visit, it
 looks as though Aunt Emma has managed to fit one more thing on it.

>examine ornaments


 Absolutely everything has some sort of sentimental value.  It boggles
 the mind how any one person can have this much sentiment.

 Among the many souvenirs of ancient history, you spot a duelling
 pistol.  That doesn't look like the sort of thing boring people like
 Aunt Emma or Uncle Stephen (or, let's face it, anyone in your whole
 family) are likely to keep around the house!

>examine pistol


 It's a little chipped and battered, which means that it's been used,
 which is even more surprising because you really cannot picture Uncle
 Stephen handling a pistol without sermonising about it.

>ask emma about pistol


 "That used to belong to an old friend.  I don't normally hold with
 duelling, but he was a very dear friend and ... you really should get
 back to your reading, Hector."

>ask emma about friend


 "You are referring to a dear, old friend of the family," says Aunt
 Emma, not looking at you.  "He got a commission with the army and went
 to India and ... war is a nasty, nasty business, Hector.  I hope and
 pray that you never have to see it."  Well, perhaps, but it would be
 really exciting....

>ask emma about war


 "That," says Aunt Emma firmly, "is thankfully something about which I
 know absolutely nothing."

 Your family is so boring.

>ask emma about india


 "I much prefer to stay in England, thank you very much.  Strange lands
 like India are for wanderers with more courage than sense."  Aunt Emma
 pauses.  "Well, courage ... it's a very fine thing, I suppose...."

 You're sure you hear Aunt Emma say something about "dear old Captain
 Davis..." as she turns back to her Bible.

>ask emma about davis


 "Captain Davis was a dear, old friend of the family," says Aunt Emma,
 not looking at you.  "He got a commission with the army and went to
 India and ... war is a nasty, nasty business, Hector.  I hope and pray
 that you never have to see it."  Well, perhaps, but it would be really
 exciting....

>ask emma about bible


 Aunt Emma wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

>examine armchair


 Give Aunt Emma due credit: she did make sure you always got the most
 comfortable armchair in the house.

>examine me


 You've been thoroughly scrubbed and ironed and starched into your
 least comfortable set of clothes.  One day, when you are either Prime
 Minister or Archbishop of Canterbury -- depending on whether you
 listen to Mother or Father -- you're going to outlaw starch or declare
 it anathema or both.

>examine window


 From here, you can see the lawn and the woods and the distant  spires
 of the cathedral.  The sun is shining and you know that the woods are
 just bursting with interesting things to discover.

>examine cathedral


 Barchester Cathedral is just visible beyond the woods.  You can't make
 out the details, but you know it's all very grand and impressive, at
 least to someone who isn't made to go there quite as regularly as you
 are.

>examine sun


 Why are you still indoors?  Why?

>examine woods


 The woods look incredibly enticing this time of the year.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   Uncle Stephen's latest sermon

>examine sermon


 Uncle Stephen seems to have picked 1 Chronicles 6:1-15 as the topic of
 his sermon.  Oh dear.

>read it


 Believe it or not, the part where Uncle Stephen expounds upon the
 chosen passage is even less interesting than the passage itself.

>ask emma about sermon


 "If you're having trouble with it, bring it here and show it to me,
 and I'll explain it as best I can," says Aunt Emma kindly.

>show sermon to emma


 Aunt Emma tries to explain the sermon to you.  Her rather confused and
 unintelligible rambling fails to make it any more interesting.

>ask emma about levi


 Aunt Emma wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

>put sermon on mantel


 There's no room.  There's never any room.

>open window


 That's not something you can open.

>break window


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.  Also, Uncle Stephen would tan
 your hide.

>swear


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask Emma where baby Bible characters come from


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>go find a nice girl and do some begetting


 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>give sermon to emma


 You show Uncle Stephen's latest sermon to Aunt Emma.

 Aunt Emma tries to explain the sermon to you.  Her rather confused and
 unintelligible rambling fails to make it any more interesting.

>ask emma about key


 "Someone has to take care of supper while the servants are away,
 Hector."

>get portrait


 The portrait is out of reach.  Besides, that would probably be
 <span class="floydstyle em">lèse-majesté</span>, which you just learned about last Spring in
 your French lessons.  You would never want to visit a French crime on
 your English queen.  That would be wrong.

>get key


 Ask, and it shall be given you; but somehow you doubt if this will be
 the case here.

>look behind portrait


 You can't see any such thing.

>ask emma for key


 Ask, and it shall be given you; but that is clearly not the case here.

 Something among the ornaments on the mantel catches the light, and
 gleams momentarily.

>get pistol


 If you so much as nudged anything there, you risk having the whole lot
 come avalanching down upon your head.  You're too young to die.

>go east


 Emma gives you a stern glare that quite effectively puts you in your
 place.  Or keeps you there, at least.

>enter fireplace


 You'll only get yourself covered in soot.

>go north


 Emma gives you a stern glare that quite effectively puts you in your
 place.  Or keeps you there, at least.

>tell emma about three-headed monkey


 Aunt Emma wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

>ask emma about uncle


 "Your uncle is a busy man, Hector.  He does not wish to be disturbed."

>ask emma about emma


 Aunt Emma wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

>ask emma about me


 You're not so vain that you need Aunt Emma to tell you what a good boy
 you are; nor do you care to hear about how you should have washed
 behind your ears this morning, or some such nonsense.

>examine ears


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine gleam


 You can't see any such thing.

>read sermon


 Believe it or not, the part where Uncle Stephen expounds upon the
 chosen passage is even less interesting than the passage itself.

 Bored, you glance up at the mantel and wonder what Aunt Emma could
 have added to it since your last visit.

 It would be rude to go meddling with something while someone else is
 still holding on to it.

 Ask, and it shall be given you; but that is clearly not the case here.

 July, 1916

 Getting the other fellows to join in on this story-telling lark seemed
 like a good idea at the time.  It was better than yet another game of
 cards, anyway, and it rather took the mind off who is or is not going
 to be at mess in the morning.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Somewhere In Flanders</span>
 It's a little terrifying how accustomed you've gotten to this muddy,
 grimy hell-hole.  You could probably find your way back here in the
 dark, crawling blind through a maze of twisty trenches, all alike.

 You can see Anderson, Jellicoe, Hardy and Macdougal here.

 Everyone is staring at Macdougal, who begins to turn a bright red.

 "What on earth is that supposed to mean?" barks Anderson at the
 hapless fellow.

>examine macdougal


 Macdougal joined the battalion only a month ago, thanks to the
 Military Service Act of January last.  Just think, when you were his
 age, Edward VII was just clambering up onto the throne.  Anderson
 probably picked him for his batman out of pity.

 "Magic words," says Macdougal, looking to you in appeal.  "It's
 standard operating procedure in these games, isn't it?"

 "I've never heard that one before in my life," you declare.

>examine me


 Your uniform was beautifully starched and crisp when you first left
 England two years ago.  You thought you'd be back (for good, not on
 leave) before the starch had quite softened on your collar.  And now
 look at you.

 Jellicoe lets out a snort of exasperation.  "Really," he drawls.
 "Magic.  What nonsense.  I'm surprised at you, Macdougal, although
 goodness knows what they're teaching you in school these days."

 "I'd suggest we just get on with it, wouldn't you?" says Hardy, and
 Anderson nods in agreement.

 ABOUT THE AUTHOR

 Christopher Huang is an architectural technician (which is a fancy way
 of saying "Draughtsman" or "CADmonkey") based in Montreal.  He is
 perhaps a little overly influenced by the Barsetshire novels written
 by Anthony Trollope, and "Sunday Afternoon" may be said to take place
 within that universe.  In spite of this, the author is not himself a
 member of the Church of England.

 The author can be reached by e-mail at mise@ricordius.com.
 Alternatively, one might try hunting him down on IFmud
 ([<a href="http://ifmud.port4000.com/">LINK</A>]) where he goes by the name of Miseri.  In
 either case, he promises not to speak of himself in the third person;
 truth be told, it is rather a tiresome business.

>examine emma


 Aunt Emma is Uncle Stephen's sister, one of those maiden aunts who
 always ends up chaperoning people around; which, as you understand it,
 means it's her job to make sure people don't have any fun.  You know
 she means well, really, but she takes her job much too seriously.

 Aunt Emma's had the same Bible for as long as you've known her.  How
 she manages to keep it from getting dog-eared, given how often she

 notice that she's using Janet's master key to mark her place.

>examine ornaments


 Absolutely everything has some sort of sentimental value.  It boggles
 the mind how any one person can have this much sentiment.

 Sunlight glints off a glass unicorn.  Now that's more the sort of
 pointless ornament you'd expect to find in Aunt Emma's collection.

 that unicorn is the last of the lot."

 Ask, and it shall be given you; but that is clearly not the case here.

>ask emma why Noah let the unicorns die in the flood


 I didn't understand that sentence.

 Absolutely everything has some sort of sentimental value.  It boggles
 the mind how any one person can have this much sentiment.

 You spot a statuette of a black falcon in the midst of all the
 clutter.

>examine falcon


 It's a black bird.  How boring.  Why anyone would want something like
 this, you do not know.

 If you so much as nudged anything there, you risk having the whole lot
 come avalanching down upon your head.  You're too young to die.

 "Captain Davis picked that up years ago when he was in Malta, and
 brought it back as present."

>ask emma about malta


 "I've never been there, but I've heard that it's quite fascinating."
 Aunt Emma recounts a few vague memories of stories told to her years
 and years ago, when the earth was young.

 Aunt Emma wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

 Here's something that's not so bad: a painting of a ship sailing into
 the sunrise.  Or sunset.  One of the two.

>examine ship


 A rather fantastic-looking ship, with a dragon figurehead, sails over
 greenish-blue waves, into the sunrise.  Or the sunset.  It's rather
 hard to tell.

>examine sunset


 Maybe it's the sunrise.

 If you were a ship's captain, you'd want your ship to have a

 You can almost believe that the waves are moving, if you look long

 There's a saucer leaning against the wall at the back of the mantel.
 Normally you wouldn't give it a second glance, but there's something
 odd about the design.

 You thought at first that the fanciful design around the saucer was a

 "That's from Wales.  There used to be a whole dinner service, but ...
 well."  Aunt Emma seems to be blushing slightly, and you guess it must
 be because she broke all the rest of the dishes and doesn't want to
 admit it.

>examine centerpiece


 You can't see any such thing.

>ask emma about wales


 "Your Uncle and I, when we were children, spent a summer in Wales.  I
 remember...." Aunt Emma pauses to stare out the window, but before you
 can seize the opportunity, she turns back to you and continues,
 "That's where we met dear old Owen Davis...."

 You are considering asking her for more about this Captain Davis
 character, when Aunt Emma sighs.  "Sometimes I wonder what might have
 been...."  She turns her attention back to her Bible, determined not
 to say any more.  But when you look up a few moments later, she's
 staring out the window, Bible forgotten.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall</span>
 Bright sunlight shines through the sidelights of the front door, to

 panelling.  Aunt Emma's parlour is to the west, Uncle Stephen's study

 The front door is large and imposing ... and creaky.  Morris says that
 Aunt Emma makes him keep it that way so she can hear when anyone comes
 in or out of the house.

>panelling


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine small door


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine closet


 The hall closet is where things like winter boots and umbrellas are
 kept.  This one is usually a lot tidier than the one back home, but
 Mother says that's probably because Aunt Emma and Uncle Stephen don't
 have a nine-year-old to worry about.

 Currently, the closet is closed.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hector...!"</span>

 Crumbs!  Aunt Emma bears down on you like the wrath of Achilles and
 grabs you by the ear.  "What have you been up to, Hector?  It's the
 Lord's day: do try to behave yourself this one day of the week!  Now
 please, sit down."  She hauls you back into your seat.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Parlour</span> (in the armchair)
 The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and
 cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in
 the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly
 claustrophobic.

 You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace.  Escape seems
 most likely either east into the hall or north into the dining room.

 On the mantel are a flower saucer, a ship painting, a black falcon, a
 glass unicorn and a duelling pistol, all half hidden in a crowd of
 other little ornaments.

 From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes
 benignly down on the room.

 Aunt Emma sits by the window, dutifully reading her Bible.

 Uncle Stephen has taken to long walks over the hills, and as a
 consequence has gotten himself a walking stick that's really more of a
 staff, it's so long and sturdy.  Father says he's really just
 practicing for such a time as when he finally gets a bishop's crozier,
 but Mother thinks Father should not make light of such things.

 Uncle Stephen spends most of his time shut up in here, reading the
 most boring books imaginable.  One whole wall is lined with shelves
 full of these books, and then there's the desk with even more books
 stacked on it.  The only decent things you can see here are the
 fireplace, which is quite grand, and a marvellous painting of the
 seaside.  The hall is back to the west.

 Half-hidden among the papers on the desk, you spot a large matchbox.

 Uncle Stephen seems to have nodded off in his chair.  His pipe droops
 unhappily from his lips, stone-cold dead.

 A rather thick folder lies on the floor by the desk, having been
 displaced by some of Uncle Stephen's reference books.

>examine shelves


 Picking out a random book from the shelves, you find ...
 <span class="floydstyle em">Confessiones</span>.  Ah yes, the works of Augustine of Hippo.  Of
 course, Uncle Stephen would only have the Latin translations.

 You return the book to the shelves, though not perhaps in quite the

 Why doesn't Uncle Stephen keep any exciting fiction in his library?

 You return the book to the shelves, though not perhaps in quite the

>examine fireplace


 You wouldn't think, to look at it, that this is actually the back side
 of the much-larger kitchen fireplace, would you?  It's so dressed up
 that it looks like the front side of something fancy.  But yes, the
 two fireplaces share a flue and everything, though the flue itself is
 really only accessible from the kitchen side.

 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hector...!"</span>

 Crumbs!  Aunt Emma bears down on you like the wrath of Achilles and
 grabs you by the ear.  "What have you been up to, Hector?  It's the
 Lord's day: do try to behave yourself this one day of the week!  Now
 please, sit down."  She hauls you back into your seat.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Parlour</span> (in the armchair)
 The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and
 cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in
 the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly
 claustrophobic.

 You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace.  Escape seems
 most likely either east into the hall or north into the dining room.

 On the mantel are a displaced gnomon, a snake locket, a white cat, a
 wooden goblet, a flower saucer, a ship painting, a black falcon, a
 glass unicorn and a duelling pistol, all half hidden in a crowd of
 other little ornaments.

 From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes
 benignly down on the room.

 Aunt Emma sits by the window, dutifully reading her Bible.

 In the armchair you can see Uncle Stephen's latest sermon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall</span>
 Bright sunlight shines through the sidelights of the front door, to
 the south.  The rest of the hall is dull and muted, with heavy wood
 panelling.  Aunt Emma's parlour is to the west, Uncle Stephen's study
 is to the east, and the dining room is to the northwest.  A small,
 unobtrusive door behind the stairs goes northeast to the servant
 areas, and then there's the hall closet.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 Uncle Stephen spends most of his time shut up in here, reading the
 most boring books imaginable.  One whole wall is lined with shelves
 full of these books, and then there's the desk with even more books
 stacked on it.  The only decent things you can see here are the
 fireplace, which is quite grand, and a marvellous painting of the
 seaside.  The hall is back to the west.

 Half-hidden among the papers on the desk, you spot a large matchbox.

 Uncle Stephen seems to have nodded off in his chair.  His pipe droops
 unhappily from his lips, stone-cold dead.

 A rather thick folder lies on the floor by the desk, having been
 displaced by some of Uncle Stephen's reference books.

>wake stephen


 Uncle Stephen stirs and looks bemusedly at you.  "Eh?  I'm awake.
 What is it, Hector?"

 Uncle Stephen takes a puff on his pipe and notes with some annoyance
 that it has somehow gone out.  He draws a match from a nearby
 matchbox, relights the pipe, and puffs contentedly.

 "The family spent a summer there, a long time ago.  Your Aunt Emma and
 I must have been about 17 or 18, at the time."  It occurs to you that
 Mother must have been born in that year.  You're old enough to know
 that parents don't like having the children around when the stork
 makes a delivery, which probably explains why Uncle Stephen and Aunt
 Emma were sent to Wales to begin with.

 July, 1916

 Getting the other fellows to join in on this story-telling lark seemed
 like a good idea at the time.  It was better than yet another game of
 cards, anyway, and it rather took the mind off who is or is not going
 to be at mess in the morning.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Somewhere In Flanders</span>
 It's a little terrifying how accustomed you've gotten to this muddy,
 grimy hell-hole.  You could probably find your way back here in the
 dark, crawling blind through a maze of twisty trenches, all alike.

 Anderson was doodling on an old letter of recommendation earlier, and
 seems to have forgotten about it.

 You can also see Anderson, Jellicoe, Hardy and Macdougal here.

 Anderson shakes his head.  "I can't believe she'd fall for that a
 third time.  What kind of a weak-minded aunt did you have, Conrad?"

 "You're the ones who can't figure it out," you reply.  "So she'll keep
 falling for the same stunt until you do."

>examine hector


 Your uniform was beautifully starched and crisp when you first left
 England two years ago.  You thought you'd be back (for good, not on
 leave) before the starch had quite softened on your collar.  And now
 look at you.

 "Major Conrad just wants us to try again," says Jellicoe, with an air
 of pouring oil over troubled waters.  "So why don't we go and do
 that?"

 "We need a better strategy," Hardy muses, drawing the other men to
 him.  "Look, we've got only so long before she stops mooning over
 ancient history, and I'm pretty sure the major doesn't mean for the
 trick to happen more than once.  What can we do with those few
 minutes?"

>ask hardy about outdoors


 The men can figure this out on their own.

 Macdougal says, "there's bound to be something in one of the other
 rooms that will convince her to leave us alone."

 "It can't be that simple," snorts Anderson in reply.

 "Anyway we can just keep trying until we get it right, right?"  Hardy
 looks around the table, and the others nod.  "So, let's get on with
 this."

 The dining room is a pleasant, sunny room, with a round dining table
 just large enough for six.  A huge bay window looks out over the lawn
 towards the cathedral: Uncle Stephen's morning reminder of who he is
 and why he's here.  Aunt Emma's parlour is back to the south, and the
 hall is to the southeast.  The butler's door into the kitchen is to
 the east.

 On the dining table is an elaborate flower centrepiece.

>examine centerpiece


 Aunt Emma believes in "civilised dining", which is why she insists on
 maintaining a pretty centrepiece on the dining table at all times.
 This centrepiece is beginning to get a little old and dry.  The
 flowers and leaves stick out all over like bristles on a brush, and
 the ribbons holding it together are looking droopy.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit Uncle Stephen.

>examine painting


 It's a brilliant painting of a town beside the sea, with the sun
 shining on whitewashed houses and the bluest sky you ever did see.
 Uncle Stephen always smiles and says he's seen better when you ask him
 about it.

>ask stephen about it


 Uncle Stephen stirs and looks bemusedly at you.  "Eh?  I'm awake.
 What is it, Hector?"

 Uncle Stephen takes a puff on his pipe and notes with some annoyance
 that it has somehow gone out.  He draws a match from a nearby
 matchbox, relights the pipe, and puffs contentedly.

>ask stephen about it


 "I'm rather fond of it, even if your Aunt Emma isn't."  Uncle Stephen
 smiles wistfully.  "Admittedly, it's not the artist's best work, but
 it brings back memories, you see."

>ask stephen about memories


 Uncle Stephen looks a little wistful.  "You know, the late summer of
 1886 found me on the continent...."  But you quickly stop him before
 he gets carried away.

 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 Uncle Stephen spends most of his time shut up in here, reading the
 most boring books imaginable.  One whole wall is lined with shelves
 full of these books, and then there's the desk with even more books
 stacked on it.  The only decent things you can see here are the
 fireplace, which is quite grand, and a marvellous painting of the
 seaside.  The hall is back to the west.

 Half-hidden among the papers on the desk, you spot a large matchbox.

 Uncle Stephen is reading a really ancient-looking manuscript while
 making notes in another sheaf of papers.  White smoke curls from the
 bowl of his pipe.

 Uncle Stephen begins to nod drowsily.  In a few moments, his pipe
 droops down onto his chest and he lets out a tiny little snore.

>examine manuscript


 It's one of those ancient, dusty artefacts that Uncle Stephen
 occasionally gets out of the rare books department at the British
 Museum.  It's all written in funny squiggles that no-one can read.

>examine sheaf


 You can't see any such thing.

 Uncle Stephen stirs and looks bemusedly at you.  "Eh?  I'm awake.

 "It's quite an interesting, apocryphal document, I must say.  I'll let
 you read it when I'm done, if you're good."  Right.  Better misbehave
 before it's too late.

>examine papers


 It looks like a translation of some sort, full of crossed-out bits and
 notes about notes about other notes.  As far as you can tell, it's
 about some servant's account of the water-into-wine miracle from the
 Bible, although why Uncle Stephen is working on translating that when
 he can just read it in any old Bible, you do not know.

 Uncle Stephen's desk is covered with all sorts of papers.  There's a
 huge dictionary that Uncle Stephen keeps flipping through, and things
 in languages that you've never even heard of before.  Uncle Stephen is
 sitting right up close to the desk, blocking its only drawer.

 On the desk is a large matchbox.

 Uncle Stephen begins to nod drowsily.  In a few moments, his pipe
 droops down onto his chest and he lets out a tiny little snore.

>examine dictionary


 The dictionary on Uncle Stephen's desk is actually some sort of book
 about Hebrew grammar.  You have enough trouble with Latin and French;
 Father says he wants to get you started on Greek next year, which
 sounds like the end of the world as you know it; Hebrew looks like it
 goes beyond even Greek, Latin and French all put together in terms of
 things Man was not meant to know.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall</span>
 Bright sunlight shines through the sidelights of the front door, to
 the south.  The rest of the hall is dull and muted, with heavy wood
 panelling.  Aunt Emma's parlour is to the west, Uncle Stephen's study

 The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and

 claustrophobic.  Escape seems most likely either east into the hall or
 north into the dining room.

 An armchair, which years of visits have accustomed you to thinking of

 On the mantel are a displaced gnomon, a snake locket, a white cat, a

 is to the east, and the dining room is to the northwest.  A small,
 unobtrusive door behind the stairs goes northeast to the servant
 areas, and then there's the hall closet.

 Uncle Stephen is casting about for his missing matchbox.  His pipe
 droops unhappily from his lips, stone-cold dead.

 You can also see an elaborate flower centrepiece here.

>open closet


 You open the closet, revealing a large matchbox and a walking stick.

 Uncle Stephen catches sight of the matchbox sitting where you'd left
 it, and happily retrieves it.  Thankfully, he doesn't seem too
 interested in wondering how it got there in the first place.

 Uncle Stephen returns to his study.

>read letter


 Let's see.  It's from a Mr John Austin, thanking your Uncle Stephen
 for something ... boring stuff, boring stuff ... well.  It looks as
 though Uncle Stephen has been sending money regularly to this Mr
 Austin, but why?  You separate the letter out into its three pages,
 and regard each one individually....

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   three pages of a scandalous letter
   a brown folder
     Uncle Stephen's old sermons

>examine letter


 Which do you mean, the first page, the second page or the third page?

>first


 Mr John Austin sends his regards ... lovely weather ... good health
 ... first child ... all very standard fare, nothing you wouldn't
 expect to find in a hundred other letters....

>examine second page


 Thanks for the assistance ... goodness, here's an account of all sorts
 of money that Uncle Stephen has been sending to this Austin fellow
 over the past year.  Mr Austin sounds as though he should have been a
 bank clerk, but why on earth would Uncle Stephen be sending him money?

>examine third letter


 Here's where Mr Austin talks about his wife, which sounds terribly
 boring.  But the way this page is creased, it looks as though Uncle
 Stephen's been reading and re-reading it over and over, for some odd
 reason.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parlour</span>
 The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and
 cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in
 the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly
 claustrophobic.  Escape seems most likely either east into the hall or
 north into the dining room.

 An armchair, which years of visits have accustomed you to thinking of
 as "your" armchair, is positioned near the fireplace.

 On the mantel are a displaced gnomon, a snake locket, a white cat, a
 wooden goblet, a flower saucer, a ship painting, a black falcon, a
 glass unicorn and a duelling pistol, all half hidden in a crowd of
 other little ornaments.

 From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes
 benignly down on the room.

 Aunt Emma sits by the window, dutifully reading her Bible.

>show letter to emma

 Aunt Emma would never even look at that if you were to present it to
 her directly.  You'll need a more subtle approach.

>put letter in folder

 Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?

>put first in folder


 You put the first page into the brown folder.

>put second in folder


 You put the second page into the brown folder.

>put third in folder


 You put the third page into the brown folder.

>show folder to emma


 Aunt Emma looks in the folder and begins scanning the topmost sermon.
 Flipping through the collected sermons, she happens quite by chance
 upon the first page of that letter to Uncle Stephen.  She reads the
 first few lines, then stops, carefully extracts the offending pages,
 and hands them to you.  "This doesn't belong in here with your uncle's
 sermons, Hector; it looks like a private letter, probably from a
 parishioner.  I don't know how it got mixed in with the old sermons,
 but you had better return it to him."

>put third page in folder


 You put the third page into the brown folder.

>show folder to emma


 Aunt Emma looks in the folder and begins scanning the topmost sermon.
 Flipping through the collected sermons, she happens quite by chance

>put second letter in folder


 You put the second page into the brown folder.

>show folder to emma


 Aunt Emma looks in the folder and begins scanning the topmost sermon.
 Flipping through the collected sermons, she happens upon the second
 page of that letter to Uncle Stephen, the one that you'd left in
 there.  She reads the first few lines, stops, then reads it again.
 Clearly, the information about Uncle Stephen's money management has
 caught her attention, and she is not at all happy about it.  "Excuse
 me, Hector," she says, "but I really must speak to your uncle about
 something."

 Aunt Emma slips something between the pages of her Bible to mark her
 place, then takes the folder from you and stalks off.  She's left her
 Bible behind.

>get bible


 Taken.

>examine key


 The master key is usually carried by the servants, which seems a
 little ironic.  But then it's the servants who need to get into every
 nook and cranny of the house, from attic to coal cellar; normal people
 only need to get into the civilised living spaces.  Since the servants
 today are out, it's been handed over to Aunt Emma ... which still
 seems a little ironic, since she's the <span class="floydstyle em">mistress</span> of the house.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The dining room is a pleasant, sunny room, with a round dining table
 just large enough for six.  A huge bay window looks out over the lawn
 towards the cathedral: Uncle Stephen's morning reminder of who he is
 and why he's here.  Aunt Emma's parlour is back to the south, and the
 hall is to the southeast.  The butler's door into the kitchen is to
 the east.

 This is Cookie's domain, the place where all the baking and roasting
 and cooking gets done.  You're generally not allowed in here, although
 once, ages ago, Uncle Stephen gave you special permission to come in
 and watch a chimney sweep have a go at the kitchen fireplace.

 The main part of the house is back to the southwest, while a very
 steep and narrow staircase goes up and down.  There's also the
 butler's door into the dining room, the west.

 An old photograph is framed over the kitchen fireplace.

>examine fireplace


 The kitchen fireplace is almost big enough to stand in.  It's
 back-to-back with the fireplace in Uncle Stephen's study, and shares a
 flue.  You remember this from the time Uncle Stephen let you watch the
 sweep clean out the chimney.

>examine staircase


 That's how the servants get all over the house without anyone
 noticing.

 A small unit of soldiers poses in front of an elephant.  You recognise
 a much-younger Morris as one of the soldiers; the others are
 strangers, though one looks vaguely familiar for reasons you can't
 quite determine.

>examine flue


 There's the flue, which is shared with Uncle Stephen's study.  You
 remember the sweep saying that this was highly irregular, although
 maybe he was just miffed that he had one less chimney to clean and be
 paid for.  It's currently closed, since there's no reason to light a
 fire just yet.

>open


 What do you want to open?

>flue


 You open the flue.

>listen to flue


 Through the open flue, you can hear Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma
 speaking rather animatedly in the study.  It's a pity they never raise
 their voices, but you can make out a few words: "moral obligation" ...
 "finally understood" ... "Owen" ... Mother's name comes up rather more
 often than one might expect, which probably means you're going to be
 in so much trouble when she gets back from Oxford.

 It's a little chipped and battered, which means that it's been used,

 but Mother thinks Father should not make light of such things.

 Aunt Emma seems to have been somewhere in the middle of the Acts of

 July, 1916

 Getting the other fellows to join in on this story-telling lark seemed
 like a good idea at the time.  It was better than yet another game of
 cards, anyway, and it rather took the mind off who is or is not going
 to be at mess in the morning.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Somewhere In Flanders</span>
 It's a little terrifying how accustomed you've gotten to this muddy,
 grimy hell-hole.  You could probably find your way back here in the
 dark, crawling blind through a maze of twisty trenches, all alike.

 You can see Anderson, Jellicoe, Hardy and Macdougal here.

 Hardy blinks at Anderson's question.  "Well, sir, what I was thinking
 was, I thought perhaps we could get out by the tradesman's door."

 "There isn't a tradesman's door," you say quickly.

 "No tradesman's door?  How do the servants get in and out, then?
 Where does the butcher deliver?  Not the front door, surely?"

>examine jellicoe


 Jellicoe's father was Uncle Stephen's curate back around '95.  You
 didn't care much for him at the time, but two years of hell can make
 brothers out of anyone.

 "Hardy's right," says Anderson slowly, "there ought to be a
 tradesman's door.  Never would have occurred to me.  Never been
 below-stairs, or thought about what goes on there."

 Macdougal shrugs.  "I've spent all my life in flats, myself.  Setup's
 a little bit different."

>examine hardy


 Resourceful chap, Hardy.  Not someone you'd care to rub elbows with in
 peacetime, but his ... acquisitions make life in the trenches just a
 touch more bearable.  Which is why you've taken him as your batman.
 Hope he lasts.

 Jellicoe looks from you to the others and back.  "There's a reason,
 surely, that you didn't poke around more?  Or perhaps the door was
 locked, or blocked somehow, or...."

 "Right, right," you say, "of course there was.  I quite forgot.
 Morris was there...."

 Crumbs, it looks like Morris is back, propped right up against the
 tradesman's door with a bottle of the demon drink.  He'll give you a
 good whipping for trespassing if he catches you here, so you'd best
 keep your distance.  Besides, the alcohol fumes coming off him would
 do you in for sure.

 It sounds as though Morris is back, and dead drunk.  You don't want to

 exceedingly silly.

>sweep fireplace


 You thrust the flowery end of the walking stick up into the flue, and
 are rewarded with a sudden explosion of soot ... and the sounds of
 Aunt Emma and Uncle Stephen's consternation at a corresponding
 explosion of soot on the other side.  Not long after, you hear them
 both hurrying up the stairs to get themselves cleaned off and changed.

 With Aunt Emma and Uncle Stephen otherwise occupied, you quickly open

 with the folder of old sermons.

 4) After Aunt Emma has decided that you can be trusted to leave your

 Bright sunlight shines through the sidelights of the front door, to
 the south.  The rest of the hall is dull and muted, with heavy wood
 panelling.  Aunt Emma's parlour is to the west, Uncle Stephen's study
 is to the east, and the dining room is to the northwest.  A small,
 unobtrusive door behind the stairs goes northeast to the servant
 areas, and then there's the hall closet.

 The hall closet door is half-open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parlour</span>
 The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and
 cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in
 the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly
 claustrophobic.  Escape seems most likely either east into the hall or
 north into the dining room.

 An armchair, which years of visits have accustomed you to thinking of
 as "your" armchair, is positioned near the fireplace.

 On the mantel are a flower saucer, a ship painting, a black falcon, a
 glass unicorn and a duelling pistol, all half hidden in a crowd of
 other little ornaments.

 From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes
 benignly down on the room.

 Aunt Emma sits by the window, staring off into the distance.

 If anyone heard you, they'd want to know where you learned such
 terrible language.  And then Morris would be in terrible trouble, and
 you don't want that.

 Quite.

 Aunt Emma sighs and finally looks around.  When she sees you out of
 your seat, she frowns and rises, and grabs you by the ear.  "What have
 you been up to, Hector?  It's the Lord's day: do try to behave
 yourself this one day of the week!  Now please, sit down."  She hauls
 you back into your seat.

 July, 1916

 Getting the other fellows to join in on this story-telling lark seemed
 like a good idea at the time.  It was better than yet another game of
 cards, anyway, and it rather took the mind off who is or is not going
 to be at mess in the morning.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Somewhere In Flanders</span>
 It's a little terrifying how accustomed you've gotten to this muddy,
 grimy hell-hole.  You could probably find your way back here in the
 dark, crawling blind through a maze of twisty trenches, all alike.

 Anderson was doodling on an old letter of recommendation earlier, and
 seems to have forgotten about it.

 You can also see Anderson, Jellicoe, Hardy and Macdougal here.

 Anderson glares at his batman.  "How many times are you going to ask
 her about that, Macdougal?"

 "I think Macdougal just likes hearing the Major talk about how war is
 such a dreadful business," says Hardy with a look of amusement.

 "Well, it's getting tiresome," snaps Anderson, still glaring at poor
 Macdougal.

>kill anderson


 Violence is the answer to a lot of things, but this isn't one of them.

 "It's clear she's got nothing else to say on the subject," reasons
 Jellicoe, "and anyway the story isn't about war or the army or
 anything like that, is it?"

 You shake your head in agreement.  This was supposed to be a diversion
 into a more innocent time.

>xyzzy


 MacDougal flashes you a knowing smile, but says nothing.

 Macdougal has the grace to look sheepish.  "Sorry, sir," he mumbles.
 "I won't do it again."

 "Good.  Let's move on."

 "Agreed."

 <span class="floydstyle i">Parlour</span> (in the armchair)
 The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and
 cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in
 the fireplace.  On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly
 claustrophobic.

 You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace.  Escape seems
 most likely either east into the hall or north into the dining room.

 On the mantel are a flower saucer, a ship painting, a black falcon, a
 glass unicorn and a duelling pistol, all half hidden in a crowd of
 other little ornaments.

 From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes
 benignly down on the room.

 Aunt Emma sits by the window, dutifully reading her Bible.

 In the armchair you can see Uncle Stephen's latest sermon.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Goodness.  What just happened there?</span>

>ask emma about army


 "It is certainly a respectable career choice, Macdougal."  For some
 reason you can't quite name, you feel reluctant to press the issue
 further.  Nor are you sure why she just called you "Macdougal".

>examine falcon


 It's a black bird.  How boring.  Why anyone would want something like
 this, you do not know.

>examine treader


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine ship


 A rather fantastic-looking ship, with a dragon figurehead, sails over
 greenish-blue waves, into the sunrise.  Or the sunset.  It's rather
 hard to tell.

>examine mantlepiece


 It's one of those extraordinarily sturdy oak affairs.  Every time you
 visit, it looks as though it could not possibly hold even one more
 little ornament without collapsing; and yet, every time you visit, it
 looks as though Aunt Emma has managed to fit one more thing on it.

 On the mantel are a flower saucer, a ship painting, a black falcon, a
 glass unicorn and a duelling pistol, all half hidden in a crowd of
 other little ornaments.

>examine unicorn


 It's a unicorn, made of glass, rearing up on its hind legs.  Its horn
 appears to have been broken off once upon a time, though it's been
 glued back on since.

 Absolutely everything has some sort of sentimental value.  It boggles

 There's a wooden goblet standing at one end of the mantel.  It's very
 plain, but on the other hand you didn't think people made goblets out
 of wood.

>examine goblet


 It's plain and non-descript, even remarkably so; its only point of
 interest is that it's a goblet made of wood, which seems like a funny
 sort of material to make goblets out of.

 You notice a white porcelain cat sitting on the mantel, looking down

 a mouth.

 There's that old locket with the snake on the front.  You remember

 memory on Aunt Emma's mantel.

>examine locket


 It's rather large, and very ornate.  The snake on the front is curved
 like the letter S, and no-one as far back as anyone remembers has ever
 been able to open it.

 How odd, there's a gnomon here, the triangular shadow-casting bit from
 a sundial, but no sundial.

 It's triangular and made of brass, with a screwy end where it's
 supposed to screw into a sundial somewhere.

 Someone whispers <span class="floydstyle em">"Gnomon is an island"</span> into your ear, but
 when you look around, there's no-one there.

 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

>fidget


 "Don't fidget, Hector," says Aunt Emma.  "It's unbecoming."

>go east


 Emma gives you a stern glare that quite effectively puts you in your
 place.  Or keeps you there, at least.

>ask emma about owen


 Aunt Emma sighs.  "Sometimes I wonder what might have been...."  She
 turns her attention back to her Bible, determined not to say any more.
 But when you look up a few moments later, she's staring out the
 window, Bible forgotten.

>go east


 (First stealthily slipping out of the armchair)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall</span>
 Bright sunlight shines through the sidelights of the front door, to
 the south.  The rest of the hall is dull and muted, with heavy wood
 panelling.  Aunt Emma's parlour is to the west, Uncle Stephen's study
 is to the east, and the dining room is to the northwest.  A small,
 unobtrusive door behind the stairs goes northeast to the servant
 areas, and then there's the hall closet.

>fidget


 It doesn't make you any more comfortable.

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 Uncle Stephen spends most of his time shut up in here, reading the
 most boring books imaginable.  One whole wall is lined with shelves
 full of these books, and then there's the desk with even more books
 stacked on it.  The only decent things you can see here are the
 fireplace, which is quite grand, and a marvellous painting of the
 seaside.  The hall is back to the west.

 Half-hidden among the papers on the desk, you spot a large matchbox.

 Uncle Stephen seems to have nodded off in his chair.  His pipe droops
 unhappily from his lips, stone-cold dead.

 A rather thick folder lies on the floor by the desk, having been
 displaced by some of Uncle Stephen's reference books.

>get sermons


 Taken.

>ask stephen about llew


 Uncle Stephen stirs and looks bemusedly at you.  "Eh?  I'm awake.
 What is it, Hector?"

 Uncle Stephen takes a puff on his pipe and notes with some annoyance
 that it has somehow gone out.  He draws a match from a nearby
 matchbox, relights the pipe, and puffs contentedly.

>ask stephen about llew


 Uncle Stephen wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hector...!"</span>

 Crumbs!  Aunt Emma bears down on you like the wrath of Achilles but
 stops in surprise when she sees the folder of Uncle Stephen's old
 sermons in your hands.  "Oh!" she says.  "Oh ... are those your Uncle
 Stephen's old sermons?  So that's what you were after!  You should
 have just said so.  I see I should have trusted you enough to know you
 could not possibly mean any mischief when you leave your seat."

 She actually smiles and pats you on the head.  On the bright side, it
 looks as though she doesn't mind you wandering around any more, since
 she makes no further attempt to usher you into your chair.

>ask stephen about gronw


 Uncle Stephen looks inexplicably alarmed.  "We'll have none of that
 talk here," he says sharply.

>ask stephen about llew


 Uncle Stephen wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

 Uncle Stephen begins to nod drowsily.  In a few moments, his pipe
 droops down onto his chest and he lets out a tiny little snore.

>ask stephen about bloduwedd


 Uncle Stephen stirs and looks bemusedly at you.  "Eh?  I'm awake.
 What is it, Hector?"

>ask stephen about bloduwedd


 Uncle Stephen looks inexplicably alarmed.  "We'll have none of that
 talk here," he says sharply.

 areas, and then there's the hall closet.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The dining room is a pleasant, sunny room, with a round dining table
 just large enough for six.  A huge bay window looks out over the lawn
 towards the cathedral: Uncle Stephen's morning reminder of who he is
 and why he's here.  Aunt Emma's parlour is back to the south, and the
 hall is to the southeast.  The butler's door into the kitchen is to
 the east.

 On the dining table is an elaborate flower centrepiece.

 You can see Anderson, Jellicoe, Hardy and Macdougal here.

 Hardy folds his arms.  "I really don't see why we can't just open the
 door and make a run for it."

 "Don't be absurd," says Jellicoe, "we'd be in terrible trouble if we
 did that."

>fuck


 Quite.

 "We'd be in trouble anyway, if we ever got out of the house," reasons
 Hardy, not budging.  "Which is the point of this little story, isn't
 it?  Getting out of the house?"

 "But then we'd have both the aunt and the uncle chasing after us,"
 says Macdougal thoughtfully, "and we'd have to try and find a hiding
 spot before they catch us, and then we wouldn't be able to enjoy the
 afternoon because we'd always be looking over our shoulder."

>darn


 Seriously?  Your sainted Aunt Emma could do better.

 Anderson nods.  "What we need is a head start.  It would also help if
 no-one knew which direction we ran off in.  Isn't that right, Conrad?"

 You nod, not wanting to admit that it had never occurred to you to
 directly defy Aunt Emma, as per Hardy's suggestion.  You were just so
 used to Aunt Emma's authority that the sound of her voice alone was
 enough to make you stop in your tracks.

 Hardy rolls his eyes.  "Fine.  Clearly you know what's what better
 than I do.  Let's get back to the story."

 July, 1892.

 Father is off to Oxford again, and Mother's gone with him.  You know
 what that means: another day in the care of Uncle Stephen, who is nice
 but boring, and Aunt Emma, who means well but won't let you do
 anything fun.  Worst of all, it's a Sunday, which means you're sitting
 very upright in Aunt Emma's parlour, in all your stiff-starched Sunday
 best, trying to read Uncle Stephen's latest sermon about one of the
 less-interesting parts of the Bible while Aunt Emma pretends that she
 wouldn't rather be knitting and Uncle Stephen hides under a pile of
 Hebrew and Latin and Greek in his study.

 Plus, it's gloriously sunny outside, and you can smell the grass from
 in here.  It's just not fair.  All the servants have the day off
 because Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma don't believe in making people do
 any real work on Sundays, and you can bet that they -- Janet and
 Morris and Cookie, each of whom is loads more fun than Uncle Stephen
 and Aunt Emma put together -- are probably not all cooped up indoors
 in their Sunday best.

 If only there were some way you could escape....

 little ornaments.

>ask about unicorn


 "That used to be part of a much larger glass menagerie," says Aunt
 Emma, "but, well, the less said about that the better."

>ask about falcon


 Aunt Emma seems to hesitate.  "An ... old friend picked that up years
 ago when he was in Malta, and brought it back as present."

 You're sure you hear Aunt Emma say something about "dear old Captain
 Davis..." as she turns back to her Bible.

>ask about malta


 "I've never been there, but I've heard that it's quite fascinating."
 Aunt Emma recounts a few vague memories of stories told to her years
 and years ago, when the earth was young.

>ask about ship


 "It's a little fantastic for my tastes.  But I suppose, as your Uncle
 Stephen says, the fantastic is a reminder of the wonder and majesty of
 our Lord, and who am I to argue?"

>ask about saucer


 "That's from Wales.  There used to be a whole dinner service, but ...
 well."  Aunt Emma seems to be blushing slightly, and you guess it must
 be because she broke all the rest of the dishes and doesn't want to
 admit it.

>ask about wales


 "Your Uncle and I, when we were children, spent a summer in Wales.  I
 remember...." Aunt Emma pauses to stare out the window, but before you
 can seize the opportunity, she turns back to you and continues,
 "That's where we met dear old Owen Davis...."

>ask about owen


 "Captain Davis was a dear, old friend of the family," says Aunt Emma,
 not looking at you.  "He got a commission with the army and went to
 India and ... war is a nasty, nasty business, Hector.  I hope and pray
 that you never have to see it."  Well, perhaps, but it would be really
 exciting....

>wait


 Time passes.

>ask emma about wales


 "Your Uncle and I, when we were children, spent a summer in Wales.  I

>examine mantlepiece


 It's one of those extraordinarily sturdy oak affairs.  Every time you
 visit, it looks as though it could not possibly hold even one more
 little ornament without collapsing; and yet, every time you visit, it
 looks as though Aunt Emma has managed to fit one more thing on it.

 On the mantel are a displaced gnomon, a snake locket, a white cat, a
 wooden goblet, an owl saucer, a ship painting, a black falcon, a glass
 unicorn and a duelling pistol, all half hidden in a crowd of other
 little ornaments.

>ask emma about goblet


 "That is the cup of a carpenter," says Aunt Emma.  You wait for her to
 continue, but she doesn't seem to want to say any more than that.

>ask emma about cat


 "Charming, is it not?  I always imagine it's saying hello to me when I
 come into the parlour in the mornings."  But how can it, when it has
 no mouth?

>ask emma about locket


 "That thing was in the house when we moved in, and we've never been
 able to track down the owners.  Well.  I suppose we're duty-bound to
 hold on to it until its true owner shows up."

>ask emma about gnomon


 "Your Uncle Stephen picked that up while on holiday in London.  I
 don't claim to understand everything about your uncle, but this gnomon
 clearly means something to him."

>wait


 Time passes.

>ask emma about wales

 can seize the opportunity, she turns back to you and continues,
 "That's where we met dear old Owen Davis...."

>ask emma about service


 Aunt Emma wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

>ask emma about mother


 Aunt Emma wouldn't have anything interesting to say about that,
 surely; at least, nothing that <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> would find interesting.

>go east


 Emma gives you a stern glare that quite effectively puts you in your
 place.  Or keeps you there, at least.

>ask about saucer


 "That's from Wales.  There used to be a whole dinner service, but ...
 well."  Aunt Emma seems to be blushing slightly, and you guess it must
 be because she broke all the rest of the dishes and doesn't want to
