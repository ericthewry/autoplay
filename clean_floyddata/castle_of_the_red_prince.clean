 Even after you ended your studies into the arcane, the nightmares
 continued to get worse.

 You see Amaranth in these dreams - a small and distant land that
 claims some vague portion of your ancestry - and the tyrant of a
 prince who rules it. You see everyone you have ever loved, everything
 you have ever cherished, shrivel and wither and fade - touched by his
 corrupting shadow.

 The Red Prince must die. You realise that now.

 Only then will the dreams stop.

 Welcome to Amaranth, traveller.

 This whole blighted land sprawls out before you. Interact with any
 region, building or object you've seen mentioned in the text, at any
 time, by typing a simple command and pressing return.

 The game will try to introduce the commands you need as you play -
 either in bracketed, italicised prompts or in the story text itself.
 You can also use the command <span class="floydstyle i">COMMANDS</span> to view a brief list of
 the most important actions.

 The command <span class="floydstyle i">CREDITS</span> will fill you in on who made this game
 possible.



 <span class="floydstyle i">EXPLORE</span> or <span class="floydstyle i">X</span> any part of Amaranth you've seen mentioned
 in the text. Exploring the land and uncovering new areas will be one
 of the most important parts of your quest.

 When you come across the inhabitants of Amaranth, you can <span class="floydstyle i">TALK</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">TO</span> or <span class="floydstyle i">ATTACK</span> them, as you see fit.

 You can also <span class="floydstyle i">TAKE</span> certain useful items you may find and
 <span class="floydstyle i">PUT</span> them <span class="floydstyle i">IN</span> other places. Find out what items you have
 taken with the command <span class="floydstyle i">INVENTORY</span> or <span class="floydstyle i">I</span>.

 To remind yourself of the main areas of Amaranth, use the command
 <span class="floydstyle i">MAP</span>.

 And if you get stuck, <span class="floydstyle i">SLEEP</span>. The same dreams that brought you
 to Amaranth may also show you the path ahead.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(To remind yourself of the lay of the land, type MAP.)</span>

>explore


 What do you want to explore?

>examine village


 You follow deserted cobble roads between shuttered cottages and past a
 burnt-out church. Although barely a soul is to be found out of doors,
 there is movement in the windows of the local inn.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(If you get stuck, SLEEP. Your dreams brought you to Amaranth and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">they may still show you the way.)</span>

>examine inn


 The inn bears no name, only a hanging sign depicting an overflowing
 tankard. The windows are barred and the door is unusually heavyset,
 but the hearth within casts a friendly glow and the barstool is a
 welcome respite for your weary legs.

 The innkeeper nods a silent greeting, while a drunken carouser stamps
 his feet and slurs boisterous songs.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You may find out important information if you TALK TO the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">inhabitants of Amaranth.)</span>



 The innkeeper sizes you up. "Don't get so many of your sort round
 here, least not these days. If you're looking for a drink, I have the
 best ale in all Amaranth."



 The carouser looms over you, his breath stinking of cheap ale. "We
 don't need any more of your sort around here. Why don't you bloody
 well bugger off back where you came from?"

 <span class="floydstyle em">(ATTACK belligerent parties WITH any weapons you may have. If you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">have yet to find anything more suitable, you can always resort to your</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">FISTS.)</span>



 Burly and red-nosed. He reeks of ale.



 The carouser slams his drink on the bar. "Get out! Your kind aren't
 welcome here! Or are you <span class="floydstyle em">looking</span> for a fight?"

>examine me


 One who has spent too many nights studying forgotten lore, and too few
 days in the sunlight.

>tell carouser to naff off


 I didn't understand that sentence.



 You raise your fists to attack, and the carouser suddenly falls to his
 knees. "No, don't! I'm the last of my brothers and sisters left alive!
 This lighter's not worth much, but my father gave it to me. Take it,
 and we'll call it quits!"

 You pocket the lighter and lower your fists.



 The engraving reads, "Be sober, be vigilant."

 With this, you should be able to light anything suitably flammable.



 Burly and red-nosed. He reeks of ale.



 "I s'pose you'll be setting fire to all sorts of things now. You look
 the type."

>set fire to carouser


 There seems little purpose in setting the carouser on fire.



 The ale served in the inn proves lukewarm and watered down.

 The innkeeper meets your eye and smiles. You smile back.



 "They say the Armoured Lady has haunted the church graveyard for a
 hundred years. Never seen her myself, mind."

 <span class="floydstyle em">The sun sets over Amaranth and those few citizens out of doors</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">scurry back to their homes. You retire to the local inn.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Something descends on the village from the castle with the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">flapping of leathery wings. Come morning, another poor soul is found</span>

 You follow deserted cobble roads between shuttered cottages and past a
 burnt-out church. Although barely a soul is to be found out of doors,
 there is movement in the windows of the local inn.



 Once grand and reverently architected, the windows are now empty, the
 roof open and the walls blackened by smoke. The spire remains
 standing, but the stairs up were apparently burned away in the
 original conflagration.

 Despite this blasphemy, the graveyard seems untouched.



 An accusing claw, pointing at the sky.



 Emerging from tangled weeds are a chaos of headstones topped with
 cherubs and angels. A mausoleum stands in one corner.

 Within the gates of this graveyard you feel watched.

>get weeds


 You decide to leave the weeds for now.

>examine them


 The weeds of Amaranth are clinging, resilient and often poisonous.



 There seems to have been a long lasting tradition of angel headstones
 in Amaranth. These stone guardians seem both protective and resigned
 to mute sadness.

>move headstone


 Those are fixed in place.

>pray


 You mutter what feeble protective incantations come to mind, to no
 obvious effect.



 A small and gabled building of mossy stone. The silence around it is
 unnatural and oppressive.

 As soon as you step inside the mausoleum, a long-haired revenant
 stumbles shrieking from its depths, clad in chainmail and brandishing
 a gleaming sword. Her voice claws at your eardrums and you find
 yourself fleeing the graveyard in terror.

 She stops at the threshold of the mausoleum and watches you with empty
 eye sockets.

>talk to revenant


 Tip of her sword at your throat, the revenant speaks through parched
 lips. "Treachery at every turn. Betrayed by my own army. Failed by my
 heirs. Take this sword. Slay the one who trapped me in my own grave.
 Fail, and I shall recover it from your corpse and devour your heart.
 As I did with those who came before you."

 With a flash of white-hot light from her empty eye sockets, the
 armoured lady retreats into the mausoleum and disappears. You find
 yourself holding her silver sword.

>examine sword


 Its edge glints with an otherworldly light.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a silver sword
   an engraved lighter

>examine clothes


 For a moment you are confused. You might know that item by another
 name, it might not be important, or perhaps you grasp at phantoms that
 exist on another plane.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Amaranth</span>
 Wild forestland surrounds a quaint and shadowed village.

 A sheer cliff rises over the treetops, upon which is perched an
 ancient and gothic castle.



 Burly and red-nosed. He reeks of ale.

 Those few cottages that are not shuttered up or barricaded are empty
 and dilapidated.

>examine weeds


 The weeds of Amaranth are clinging, resilient and often poisonous.

>take barstool


 You decide to leave the barstool for now.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The sun sets over Amaranth and those few citizens out of doors</span>

 The forests of Amaranth are dark and wild. An unpaved path leads
 through the grasping branches, past an abandoned shack and an ancient
 stone shrine, and ends - seemingly at random - in a quiet glade.

>get branch


 The wood of Amaranth seems sickly and damp - not much good for
 firewood, let alone more involved uses.



 Clearing away the ivy that has overgrown its broken door, you discover
 that the abandoned shack is the entrance to an old mine shaft.



 The weeds of Amaranth are clinging, resilient and often poisonous.



 The mine shaft is lit only by an eerie phosphorescence. Deserted rails
 lead down through the subterranean passages and makeshift crosses
 protrude from cave-in debris.

 Among the abandoned mine equipment, you see a stick of dynamite.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You can TAKE certain items and PUT them IN other locations. See</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">what items you're carrying with INVENTORY or I.)</span>

>get cross


 You will not disturb these poor miners" graves.



 The stick of dynamite is old, but dry and intact. It should make a
 reasonable bang several seconds after being lit.



 You take possession of the stick of dynamite... carefully.



 The rails lead nowhere and carry no cargo.



 The forests of Amaranth are dark and wild. An unpaved path leads
 through the grasping branches, past an abandoned shack and an ancient
 stone shrine, and ends - seemingly at random - in a quiet glade.



 A weather-smoothed stone that might once have been in the form of some
 obscure god.

 A horned skeleton is lying near the shrine.

>get horn


 Those seem to be a part of the horned skeleton.



 You gather up the horned skeleton. It maintains its form almost as
 though some inhuman will remains to hold it together.



 A weather-smoothed stone that might once have been in the form of some
 obscure god.

>move stone


 It is fixed in place.

>look behind it


 A weather-smoothed stone that might once have been in the form of some
 obscure god.



 The path that leads through the forest has been worn into the dirt by
 many feet.



 A quiet clearing in the forest, carpeted in daisies that gently sway
 in the wind.

 A ring of scorched earth is the only blot on the glade's idyll.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The sun sets over Amaranth and those few citizens out of doors</span>

 perform such an action.

 You step uneasily around the ring. It is a perfect, unnatural circle.

>enter ring


 As you step into the ring of scorched earth, the sky beings to acquire
 a green tint. The trees around you warp and change into species you
 have never seen before. Mellifluous voices carry on the wind, and you
 catch glimpses of naked, horned figures frolicking in the eerie light
 of two suns.

 With the gasp of one who has been holding their breath, you step out
 of the ring and back into the everyday world, before you are
 completely lost.

>throw skeleton into ring


 You place the horned skeleton within the ring of scorched earth,
 taking care not to enter it yourself.

 With a sound like the ripping of flesh, a toothed maw opens in the
 ground, swallowing the skeleton whole.

 The maw stretches wide, exuding sulphur and the sense of an immense
 appetite yet unfulfilled.



 The forests of Amaranth are dark and wild. An unpaved path leads
 through the grasping branches, past an abandoned shack and an ancient
 stone shrine, and ends - seemingly at random - in a quiet glade.



 The abandoned shack stands over the entrance to an old mine shaft.

>examine equipment


 For a moment you are confused. You might know that item by another
 name, it might not be important, or perhaps you grasp at phantoms that
 exist on another plane.

>go castle


 A towering gothic structure of ancient stone. Its crumbling watchtower
 overlooks the village, and dim lights glow in the windows of the Great
 Hall.

 Gaunt soldiers stand guard around the Great Hall.

>examine soldiers


 The gaunt soldiers of the Red Prince are haggard and emaciated. Their
 pallor speaks more of the grave than the battlefield.



 The watchtower has a commanding view of the village below. Though
 built from huge stone bricks that have resisted weathering, it slants
 distinctly.

 The air inside the watchtower is thick with flies. Rotting carcasses
 are shackled to the walls.

 A massive gong stands within the watchtower.



 Very little is left of these unfortunate prisoners.

>examine gong


 Heavy and ornate, it will make quite a sound when rung.

>go watchtower


 The watchtower has a commanding view of the village below. Though
 built from huge stone bricks that have resisted weathering, it slants
 distinctly.

 The air inside the watchtower is thick with flies. Rotting carcasses
 are shackled to the walls.

 A massive gong stands within the watchtower.

>hit gong


 The gong resounds with a mournful note that echoes throughout the
 castle.

 The gaunt soldiers that guard the Great Hall leave their posts to file
 slowly into the watchtower. They shamble and crawl over its mouldy
 flagstone, picking at the carcasses chained to the walls.

>examine great hall


 You enter a domed hall of faded tapestries and tarnished gold. Cobwebs
 span the archways and dust coats every surface.

 A tall, pale figure emerges from the shadows. "Welcome. I am known as
 the Red Prince. A fitting title, I feel. And who might you be? No,
 don't tell me."

 A chill runs down your spine as his dark eyes drill into yours. You
 hear subtle echoes of your recent thoughts and conversations, before
 he breaks the contact and smiles. "A fellow student of the occult, I
 see. Do feel free to explore my library."

 Finding little fresh meat to sate their appetites, the gaunt soldiers
 march back to their posts in the Great Hall.



 Shelves and shelves of books are crammed together in the tight space
 of the castle library. The air is musty with the smell of aging paper.
 You find any number of arcane and esoteric books, many of which you
 have previously read.

 A few rare titles catch your eye, however, books you had thought long
 lost to the world: a Treatise on Other Worlds, Analysis Of Evil,
 Ignorant Children, History of Greatness and a black book.

 A lantern has been cast aside in one corner.

>get lamp


 For a moment you are confused. You might know that item by another
 name, it might not be important, or perhaps you grasp at phantoms that
 exist on another plane.

>take lantern


 Taken.

>examine lantern


 A sturdy lantern in an old style. It is unlit.



 You light the lantern. You can now explore places that are shrouded in
 darkness.

>examine black book


 This book is distinguished by only an embossed skull on its cover.
 Nevertheless, you recognise it immediately. You are unable to read the
 thin, inhuman scrawl within its pages, and would be reluctant to
 expose yourself to its horrors even if you could.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The sun sets over Amaranth and those few citizens out of doors</span>

 You thumb through the book looking for anything of interest, and find
 the following:

 "...such 'Fairy Rings' have long been held in European folklore as
 passages to the realm of the Others. Doors left ajar, if you will,
 awaiting the return of visitors to our world.

 "Experimentation reveals that such travellers need not return to their
 doorway in a state of life for it to open, albeit, in such cases, not
 quite to the place from which they originally came."

>read analysis of evil


 You thumb through the book looking for anything of interest, and find
 the following:

 "Many myths and tales attribute various strengths and weaknesses to
 such evils - from the ability to turn to mist, to a variety of
 apotropaics thought to ward them away. In particular, the powers of
 evil are said to wane considerably during the daylight hours, although
 the notion that sunlight should result in the combustion of the demon
 is recent and apocryphal.

 "Most reliable sources agree on the effectiveness of silver as
 anathema to evil. Those advocating iron instead are surely victim to
 ecumenical confusion between those that are Evil and those that are
 merely of the Other."



 You skim the first chapter and pick out a passage at random:

 "Moulded by foreign magicks into human form, these cuckoo chicks of
 outre parents may even reach adulthood unaware of their heritage and
 abilities."

>read history of greatness


 You read a page from the middle of the book:

 "But recognising his magnificence, the invading army pledged their
 immortal souls to his throne. The betrayed jezebel fell into a fatal
 fit of rage and was said to have died of a heart too unrighteous to
 beat."

>again


 You read a page from the middle of the book:

 "But recognising his magnificence, the invading army pledged their

>set dynamite


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>place dynamite in castle


 Although you're unable to find an obvious weak point, you place the
 dynamite in the castle.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Amaranth</span>
 Wild forestland surrounds a quaint and shadowed village.

 A sheer cliff rises over the treetops, upon which is perched an
 ancient and gothic castle.



 These treacherous cliffs of black rock project straight up from the
 banks of a raging river and cast a shadow over the village. A single
 narrow trail leads up to the castle.



 It winds up the cliff, starting from the banks of a raging river.



 A deep river of hidden undercurrents and nameless flotsam. Following
 it to its source, you find a waterfall cascading down the cliff face.



 Behind the waterfall is a dark cave.



 Holding your lantern high to illuminate your way, you edge into the
 cave.

 Although seemingly natural in origin, the cave intersects with the
 foundations of some structure. They're not substantial enough to be
 shoring up the entire castle, but you suspect that these foundations
 might underlie its watchtower.



 Thick beams of damp and rotting wood that must support the castle
 watchtower.



 You are not holding the stick of dynamite.

>get dynamite


 You take possession of the stick of dynamite... carefully.

>put it in foundations


 You study the foundations for a while, working out where the point of
 greatest weakness is, and place the dynamite there.

>hit gong


 The gong resounds with a mournful note that echoes throughout the
 castle.

 The gaunt soldiers that guard the Great Hall leave their posts to file
 slowly into the watchtower. They shamble and crawl over its mouldy
 flagstone, picking at the carcasses chained to the walls.

>light dynamite


 You light the fuse and quickly make your exit from the cave. Scant
 seconds later the dynamite explodes and the nearby foundations fold up
 like a concertina.

 With a low rumble, the watchtower collapses into a pile of broken
 stone and dust, forever changing the skyline of Amaranth. Those few of
 the Prince's terrible soldiers to escape are in no state to return to
 their posts.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The sun sets over Amaranth and those few citizens out of doors</span>

 You enter a domed hall of faded tapestries and tarnished gold. Cobwebs
 span the archways and dust coats every surface.

 The Red Prince lounges in a high-backed chair, a terrible and languid
 smile adorning his pale features.

>examine tapestries


 These faded tapestries depict battles whose combatants and outcomes
 have been obscured by age.



 "Oh... you were expecting me to be perturbed that you intend to kill
 me? You think, perhaps, that you're the first to try? But that is not
 so. I have bested far greater warriors than you. Much braver souls
 have begged me for mercy. Whole armies have been broken to my will.
 Yes, carry out your futile designs. And the less you bore me, the less
 I shall make you suffer."

>wipe smile off his face


 For a moment you are confused. You might know that item by another
 name, it might not be important, or perhaps you grasp at phantoms that
 exist on another plane.



 You charge the Red Prince, swinging the silver sword. He easily evades
 your clumsy attack, at first, before you find a grace and prowess you
 had no idea you possessed. You duck beneath fingers wielded like
 talons and drive the silver sword through his heart. With a prolonged
 death rattle, he crumples into his chair.

 The corpse of the Red Prince bears a strange and terrible smile.



 In truth, he does not seem to have changed much from when he was
 alive.

 The corpse of the Red Prince moves with the slightest twitch.

 Taken.

 A shudder runs through the corpse of the Red Prince.



 While you heft it towards the maw, the Red Prince's corpse seems to
 convulse with a renewed effort to tear through the thin albumen
 between death and unlife.

 As you finally cast it into those terrible, subterranean jaws, the
 corpse's eyes flick open. "No! You cannot! Wretch!"

 But the Red Prince's curses grow distant as he tumbles into oblivion.

 With a satisfied, sulphurous growl, the maw's gangrenous lips draw
 closed and fade completely from this world. Behind you, the sinister
 castle that has for so long dominated the sky of Amaranth finally
 collapses in on itself.

 You draw a deep breath of fresh air, and feel a weight lifted from
 your soul. Perhaps now you can return home and rest.
