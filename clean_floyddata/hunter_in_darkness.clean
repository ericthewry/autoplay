 Hunter, in Darkness
 A Cave Crawl by "Dave Ahl Jr." (Andrew Plotkin)
 First-time players should type "about".
 Release 4 / Serial number 991119 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/9


 Nearly -- nearly. The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your
 crossbow, try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.

>about
 "This game was conceived of and fully outlined in early June of 1999."

 And it was, too. All that discussion of compassless games, and mazes,
 and whether "Hunt the Wumpus" was really IF, made me giggle. I already
 had this on the drawing board. I didn't start any of that discussion,
 either -- although I contributed a few comments that I knew would turn
 out relevant.

 Hunter, in Darkness came in eighth in the 1999 Interactive Fiction
 Competition. I might perhaps have done better if I'd included a
 walkthrough, or hints. Never know now, eh?

 I'm not including hints now, because this is no longer a Competition
 game. Different strictures apply. You can easily find a walkthrough,
 or ask for help. However, I will say this:

 No serious mapping is necessary, or even useful, in playing this game.
 If you think you need to start drawing a map, you're wrong.

 Type "credits" for full accreditation.

 Hunter, in Darkness is copyright 1999 by Andrew Plotkin,

>inventory
 You are carrying your crossbow (loaded with a bolt), a thighband with
 four bolts (strapped to your leg), and a brightly-glowing lamplens (on
 your wrist).

 Something shifts in the darkness ahead, a great silent bulk. Your
 prey.

>examine prey
 You can see nothing of it; only a sense of movement, back and forth,
 in the depths of the cave ahead.

>inventory
 You are carrying your crossbow (loaded with a bolt), a thighband with
 four bolts (strapped to your leg), and a brightly-glowing lamplens (on
 your wrist).

 A faint rustling echoes deep in the side chamber, and the laughing
 chitter of bats.

>examine me
 You're tired and covered with mud.

>examine mud
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine lens
 A clear glareless light pours from the lamp's curved face.


 Branching Cave
 You glance around again. The cave narrows ahead, a tight crawl winding
 around folds of limestone. A low passage descends to your right, and
 there is a side chamber on the left.

 A low passage descends out of sight on the right.

 A high chamber lies to your left. You cannot see its far side, but the
 rustle of cave bats drifts from the darkness.

>go down

 Edge Of Pit
 The passage drops off suddenly, ending in a deep pit. The sides are
 steep but not vertical; you might be able to scramble down, but you
 make no bets about climbing back up.

>examine pit
 The pit is edged in veined, knotted flowstone. A stiff climb,
 considering its steepness, but possible -- in descent.

 You can make out a ledge far below.

>examine ledge
 The ledge is deep in the pit's darkness. You can see no details.

>examine sides
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying your crossbow (loaded with a bolt), a thighband with
 four bolts (strapped to your leg), and a brightly-glowing lamplens (on
 your wrist).

>examine bow
 The crossbow is well-designed enough to be simple. Laminated
 leaf-laths, fiber string, and a cocking lever that runs the full
 length of the stock.

 The bow is loaded with a bolt.

>examine me
 You're tired and covered with mud.

>examine band
 It's a long band of heavy leather, with side straps, woven into a
 foot-long tube. The four bolts inside are secure yet easily slid out,
 and the whole is strapped comfortably to your leg.

>look

 Edge Of Pit
 You stand at the bottom of a rising passage. Before you is a deep pit.
 The sides are steep but not vertical; you might be able to scramble
 down, but you make no bets about climbing back up.

>jump to ledge
 You can't see any such thing.

>jump on ledge
 You can't see any such thing.

>jump ledge
 The ledge is far out of reach.

>go down
 You sit at the edge, turn, catch, and hang full-length against the
 wall. There ought to be a foothold...

 Well, perhaps not. You slam into the ledge and lean into stone, face
 and belly, trying not to slide any farther.

 Narrow Ledge
 After a moment you retake your balance, and turn. This ledge is barely
 two feet wide at most. You try not to feel like it's angled slightly
 outward. The pit stretches above and below you; but you can see no way
 to climb from here, either way.

 A gentle arc hangs across the pit, well above your head.

>examine arc
 It's a rope. Someone must have been trying to cross the pit. Yes, you
 can make out the side passages now -- dark patches in the walls above
 you. The rope seems to be tied to a pillar by one; the other end is
 wound around an opposite pillar, hooked precariously by something
 white and curved.

>examine white
 Long, curved, white -- it's a claw, a broken-off claw of the beast
 that you seek. The rope is tied to it, and the makeshift grapple is
 wound precariously around a pillar by the right passage, above you.

>listen
 Stone-silence. Water drips somewhere.

>sniff
 The air smells of old mud.

>look down
 You can make out the pit floor. It's only two or three body-lengths
 down; but the stone formations directly below you look vicious.

>pull rope
 Even at the center of its arc, the rope is fifteen feet above you.

>exits on
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 A rope hangs across the pit, a gentle arc well above your head.

>think
 That's your job.

>shoot rope with bolt
 (the bolt)
 The crossbow isn't cocked.

>cock bow
 You pull down the lever, winching the string back until it locks.

>cock bolt
 (the bolt)
 Don't be absurd.

>shoot rope with bolt
 (the bolt)
 Tunk. Well shot -- the bolt catches the rope neatly in the center,
 whipping it upward before shearing through. The ends dance like mad
 snakes, then settle.

>look

 Narrow Ledge
 This ledge is barely two feet wide at most. You try not to feel like
 it's angled slightly outward. The pit stretches above and below you;
 but you can see no way to climb from here, either way.

 Two ends of a rope hang down the pit walls, above you and to either
 side of the ledge.

>climb rope
 You move to the extreme right side of the ledge and stretch, but the
 cut end of the rope is too far up and out. The left end is no better.

>load bow
 You need to be holding the bolt before you can put it into something
 else.

>take bolt
 You slide a bolt from your thighband.

>load bow
 You put the bolt into the crossbow.

>cock bow
 You pull down the lever, winching the string back until it locks.

>shoot rope with bolt
 (the bolt)
 Tunk. Your bolt brushes the dangling rope, which dances gently.

>undo
 Narrow Ledge
 [Previous turn undone.]

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>shoot fang with bolt
 (the bolt)
 Tunk. The bolt rattles among the blades and is lost.

>undo
 Narrow Ledge
 [Previous turn undone.]

>jump
 You back along the ledge, then take a long step and leap...

 The cut end of the rope brushes your fingers, but you have no chance
 to grab it. You twist, plummet, and are impaled on sharp stone.


     *** You have died ***



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move,
 or QUIT?
>undo
 Narrow Ledge
 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine grapple
 Long, curved, white -- it's a claw, a broken-off claw of the creature
 that you seek. Half the rope is still tied to it, and the makeshift
 grapple is wound precariously around a pillar by the right passage,
 above you.

>shoot grapple with bolt
 (the bolt)
 Tunk. Well shot -- the claw is dislodged, whirls furiously around the
 pillar, and falls free. Its half of the rope snakes down into the
 darkness.

>climb down rope
 I only understood you as far as wanting to climb the pit below.

>climb rope
 You breathe a moment; only one chance at this.

 A step and a leap, and you clutch the rope. It's slicker than you
 expected; chilly and damp. Perhaps a bit of mold, you think
 abstractedly, as your hands slip, and catch, and slip again --

 Ouch. You've fetched up against the knot at the bottom of the rope;
 and the claw is biting into your hand. Razor-edged on the inside. You
 hope you never run into one of these alive -- ow. You've slipped
 again, and now both your hands are clamped around the claw, and your
 full weight is on them.

 Hanging From a Rope
 You are dangling at the end of the rope, against a sheer stone wall.
 Directly below you are vicious stone blades, and the claw you hang
 from is slowly slicing into your palms, and it hurts...

>examine wall
 Limestone, streaked and banded, rippled and bulged and twisted like
 the flesh of some living thing. You've seen many caves before, but the
 beauty never wearies.

 Your fingers slip, and the claw-edge cuts a little deeper.

>undo

>go up
 You couldn't even hold in place on the rope, and that was before your
 hands were cut bloody. Climbing is impossible.

 Your fingers slip, and the claw-edge cuts a little deeper.

>undo
 Hanging From a Rope
 [Previous turn undone.]

>swing
 (yourself)
 You lurch yourself to the side, kick at the wall, and manage to set
 yourself swinging. The pain is amazing, but you have a chance at
 missing the stone blades now.

 Your fingers slip, and the claw-edge cuts a little deeper.

 You swing along the wall, fingers screaming at the extra strain.

>jump
 You twist back, forth, back, increasing your swing. Now -- you're
 rising away from the spires, which look sharper than ever -- you let
 go of the claw, finally, the pain nearly stops -- and you drop --


 Bottom of Pit
 You begin to drag yourself up. Ah -- no, you won't be putting any
 weight on your hands. They're badly torn up, and bleeding freely.

 This is the bottom of a wide pit. The walls are entirely unclimbable,
 of course. The floor is rippled and uneven, rising to sharp blades of
 stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but
 there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in
 the far corner.

 A twisted shape lies nearby.

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine shape
 It's human.

 And it's been here a long time. He has, you think... or she, for all
 you know. There's little left to recall this broken shape to past
 life. The bones lie crumpled, clad in tatters of chewed black flesh.
 The clothes have fared somewhat better -- some resistant fiber -- but
 even they are brittle and rent.

 A bat flutters down from overhead. And another. You wave your arms,
 but they're keeping their distance.

>get bolt
 You slide a bolt from your thighband.

 Blood continues to trickle down your fingers.

 More bats gather.

>load bow
 You put the bolt into the crossbow.

 You are starting to feel quite chill and distant.

>cock bow
 You pull down the lever, winching the string back until it locks.

 A stream of bats flickers overhead, around, never settling. You wave
 again. They seem more attracted than frightened by your hand.

>inventory
 You are carrying your crossbow (loaded and cocked), a thighband with
 three bolts (strapped to your leg), and a cracked but still glowing
 lamplens (on your wrist).

>tie clothes to hands
 You need to be holding the rags before you can put them on top of
 something else.

 Something moves on the ground nearby. You twist around violently, but
 it's not approaching you; the bat is crouched over the blood-stained
 stone where you fell.

>remove cloths
 You can't see any such thing.

>remove clothes
 (first taking the rags)
 The old fiber tears without too much strain. You manage to rip loose
 some strips from the loose hems, lying clear of the corpse. What
 remains behind, stained with old decay, you'd just as soon not touch.

 You shake your head to disperse the cold mist, and start to rub your
 eyes. It doesn't help, except to smear blood all over your face.

>tie clothes to hands
 (the cloth strips)
 You quickly bind up your hands with the cloth. It stanches the
 bleeding, at least. You only hope that you can get to better care
 before infection sets in.

 The bats seem less agitated now.

>examine corpse
 There's little left to recall this broken shape to past life. The
 bones lie crumpled, clad in tatters of chewed black flesh and torn
 rags.

 A bat darts towards your face, and quickly away.

 You see no gear or equipment on the corpse.

 You're starting to feel a bit less shaky.

 You have no desire at all to touch the thing. Man. Person.

>examine pebbles
 You can't see any such thing.

>crawl
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go down
 You kneel, stiffly, and poke your head into the opening. It's tight,
 and it looks like it gets tighter ahead. No help for it -- you crawl
 inside, pushing the crossbow awkwardly ahead of you.

 Tight Crawl
 You're on your hands and knees in a throat of stone. The roof dips
 even lower ahead. If you advance, it'll be squirming forwards on your
 belly. And squirming backwards will be impossible, you think grimly.

>forward
 You hunch your elbows beneath your chest, and wiggle forward on them,
 into the gullet.

 Tight Crawl
 You stop, after a long silent time, to rest. Crawling is hard work,
 you know well, and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to
 it. But the crawl is no different here than anywhere. You have just
 enough room to raise your head, and there's nothing to see ahead but
 more stone to crawl through.

>again
 You begin determinedly working yourself forward, again.

 Tight Crawl
 The rock is lower above you. And narrower; you're lying full length
 now, your arms stretched out ahead, but still rough stone scrapes your
 shoulders. And you seem to be angling a bit downwards.

 Icy water is trickling past you.

 Your lamp flickers erratically. The moisture must be getting to its
 workings.

>drink water
 You manage to lip a few drops from the stone. The water is muddy and
 harsh.

>foreward
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>forward
 You continue. Scrabble with fingers, brace arms, push with toes. Shove
 the crossbow a bit farther ahead. You're definitely tilted head-down
 now. Is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you?

 Tight Crawl
 You lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your
 back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into
 unexpected stone. A cold stony knot presses into your left side, your
 right knee.

 You stretch forward once more, feeling for a few more inches before
 you continue.

 Splash.

 Your fingers are submerged in water.

>drink water
 You manage to lip a few drops from the stone. The water is muddy and
 harsh.

>feel water
 It's cold.

>search water
 There's either a shallow puddle in the passage ahead... or more than
 that. From where you lie, there is no way to tell.

>examine knot
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine stone
 Limestone, streaked and banded, rippled and bulged and twisted like
 the flesh of some living thing. You've seen many caves before, but the
 beauty never wearies.

>forward
 You stretch your hands forward, submerging them. Hunch, stretch.
 Inchworm... inchworm...

 Your arms are submerged, and water ripples at your chin. No room to
 lift your head. You turn your face to the side, cheek scraping against
 the damn everpresent stone, and stretch again.

 Your lamp flickers once and goes out.

 Tight Crawl
 You are lying in cold still water. It licks at your cheek and arms,
 and across the backs of your thighs. The chill makes your bruised
 knees and chest hurt all the more; your neck screams from craning high
 enough to breathe, but there is no room to sit up. No room to turn. No
 room.

>forward
 You struggle on. You hope the water grows no deeper. That thought
 occupies you for a few more hunches, a few more stretches. Grow no
 deeper. If the water grows deeper... Grow no deeper. You shake that
 away, and nothing comes to replace it.

 You crawl on in the dark. The water grows no deeper.

 Maybe it's not as deep now?

 Tight Crawl
 Water trickles over your hands, but the floor must have risen; there
 is less of it... a note of hope. But you cannot see.

>again
 You thrust your shoulders forward. They stick.

>again
 You push again. It's just this spot; your hands are free in a wider
 area ahead. But immovable stone grates against your chest and
 shoulders.

>again
 You've got one shoulder past the edge. The other is behind a corner of
 stone, and you can't imagine how it's going to get through.

>again
 You brace your legs as best you can, and shove futilely against the
 trap.

>again
 You brace your legs as best you can, and shove futilely against the
 trap.

 You are never going to leave this place.

>look

 Tight Crawl
 Water trickles over your hands, but the floor must have risen; there
 is less of it. But the roof lowers, and the crawl has become almost
 impossibly tight. And you cannot see.

 The stone is not going to let you go.

>push stone
 You are unable to.

 You are never going to leave this place.

 You try to shove yourself back, but you cannot move.

 It is dark.

 You can make out almost nothing in this dark.

 again, and now both your hands are clamped around the claw, and your
 full weight is on them.

 Hanging From a Rope
 You are dangling at the end of the rope, against a sheer stone wall.
 Directly below you are vicious stone blades, and the claw you hang
 from is slowly slicing into your palms, and it hurts...

>examine rope
 It's an old rope. Somewhere above, it's tied to a stone pillar. At
 your end, it's tied to a razor-like claw, and that's the end that's
 got your attention.

 Your fingers slip, and the claw-edge cuts a little deeper.

 Hunter, in Darkness
 A Cave Crawl by "Dave Ahl Jr." (Andrew Plotkin)
 First-time players should type "about".
 Release 4 / Serial number 991119 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/9


 Nearly -- nearly. The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your
 crossbow, try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.

>look

 Branching Cave
 You glance around again. The cave narrows ahead, a tight crawl winding
 around folds of limestone. A low passage descends to your right, and
 there is a side chamber on the left.

 Something shifts in the darkness ahead, a great silent bulk. Your
 prey.

>left
 You advance into the chamber. A bat flutters in your face. You swipe
 it away... and three more bats replace it. You duck, swearing;
 swearing again at a sharp nip on your arm. Drew blood, it did.

 There is a rustling all around you. You try to remember what you know
 about the habits of cave bats --

 Oh.

 You scramble back, covering your eyes; too late. The swarm is on you,
 harrying you, small teeth and shrieks like shards of glass. You cannot
 see. You are running, stumbling ahead of the storm, and as you recall
 what else you know of the hunting of bats, the floor drops away to
 nothing beneath you --

>press enter

 Bottom of Pit
 You roll painfully to hands and knees. Ah -- your arm nearly gives way
 -- you realize you somehow tore hell out of it on the way down, or
 landing. It's bleeding freely.

 This is the bottom of a wide pit. The walls are entirely unclimbable,
 of course. The floor is rippled and uneven, rising to sharp blades of
 stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but
 there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in
 the far corner.

 A twisted shape lies nearby.

 You creep up the passage, as stealthily as you can. It must be
 retreating ahead, for you see only empty stone, though the smell grows
 harsher...

 And the eyes of the beast are on you, and claws come out of the night.

 Bottom of Pit
 You roll painfully to hands and knees. Ah -- your arm nearly gives way
 -- you realize you somehow tore hell out of it on the way down, or
 landing. It's bleeding freely.

 This is the bottom of a wide pit. The walls are entirely unclimbable,

 stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but
 there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in
 the far corner.

 A twisted shape lies nearby.

>examine me
 Your arm is pretty torn up. Also, you're tired and covered with mud.

 A bat flutters down from overhead. And another. You wave your arms,
 but they're keeping their distance.

>get clothes
 The old fiber tears without too much strain. You manage to rip loose
 some strips from the loose hems, lying clear of the corpse. What
 remains behind, stained with old decay, you'd just as soon not touch.

 Blood continues to trickle down your fingers.

 More bats gather.

>tie arm with clothes
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>wrap arm with clothes
 (the cloth strips)
 You quickly bind up your arm with the cloth. It stanches the bleeding,
 at least. You only hope that you can get to better care before
 infection sets in.

 there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in

 Several bats flutter overhead.

 A twisted corpse lies nearby.

 The bats seem less agitated now.

 A stream of bats flickers overhead, around, never settling. You wave
 again. They seem more attracted than frightened by your hand.

>examine blades
 Water dripping down has left runnels across the floor, that rise by
 some fluke into sharp spires by the edge of the pit. They rise like
 the teeth of sharks; no doubt you slashed your arm on one as you fell.

>kick blades
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>brake blades
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>hit blades
 The stone isn't thin enough to break.

 You're starting to feel a bit less shaky.

 Something moves on the ground nearby. You twist around violently, but
 it's not approaching you; the bat is crouched over the blood-stained
 stone where you fell.

 Tunk. The aim is tricky; your bolt misses, and ricochets wildly around
 the pit.

 there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in

 Bats flutter everywhere, just overhead.

 A twisted corpse lies nearby.

 You're feeling considerably better.

 A bat darts towards your face, and quickly away.

>go down
 You kneel, stiffly, and poke your head into the opening. It's tight,
 and it looks like it gets tighter ahead. No help for it -- you crawl
 inside, pushing the crossbow awkwardly ahead of you.

 Tight Crawl
 You're on your hands and knees in a throat of stone. The roof dips
 even lower ahead. If you advance, it'll be squirming forwards on your
 belly. And squirming backwards will be impossible, you think grimly.

>go down
 You can see no way through in that direction.

>forward
 You hunch your elbows beneath your chest, and wiggle forward on them,
 into the gullet.

 Tight Crawl
 You stop, after a long silent time, to rest. Crawling is hard work,
 you know well, and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to
 it. But the crawl is no different here than anywhere. You have just
 enough room to raise your head, and there's nothing to see ahead but
 more stone to crawl through.

>again
 You begin determinedly working yourself forward, again.

 Tight Crawl
 The rock is lower above you. And narrower; you're lying full length
 now, your arms stretched out ahead, but still rough stone scrapes your
 shoulders. And you seem to be angling a bit downwards.

 Icy water is trickling past you.

 Your lamp flickers erratically. The moisture must be getting to its
 workings.

>again
 You continue. Scrabble with fingers, brace arms, push with toes. Shove
 the crossbow a bit farther ahead. You're definitely tilted head-down
 now. Is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you?

 Tight Crawl
 You lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your
 back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into
 unexpected stone. A cold stony knot presses into your left side, your
 right knee.

 You stretch forward once more, feeling for a few more inches before
 you continue.

 Splash.

 Your fingers are submerged in water.

>again
 You stretch your hands forward, submerging them. Hunch, stretch.
 Inchworm... inchworm...

 Your arms are submerged, and water ripples at your chin. No room to
 lift your head. You turn your face to the side, cheek scraping against
 the damn everpresent stone, and stretch again.

 Your lamp flickers once and goes out.

 Tight Crawl
 You are lying in cold still water. It licks at your cheek and arms,
 and across the backs of your thighs. The chill makes your bruised
 knees and chest hurt all the more; your neck screams from craning high
 enough to breathe, but there is no room to sit up. No room to turn. No
 room.

>again
 You struggle on. You hope the water grows no deeper. That thought
 occupies you for a few more hunches, a few more stretches. Grow no
 deeper. If the water grows deeper... Grow no deeper. You shake that
 away, and nothing comes to replace it.

 You crawl on in the dark. The water grows no deeper.

 Maybe it's not as deep now?

 Tight Crawl
 Water trickles over your hands, but the floor must have risen; there
 is less of it... a note of hope. But you cannot see.

 You thrust your shoulders forward. They stick.

 That's not something you can open.

 You slip the lamplens from your wrist.

 You push again. It's just this spot; your hands are free in a wider

 shoulders.

 It feels like scraping flesh from bone, but your shoulder tears past
 the edge. You lie and gasp for a moment, and then work your torso
 painfully through the gap.

 The passage slants sharply down now, but it's widening. It's widening.
 You half-crawl, half-slide downward, dragging your legs out of the
 gap, and come to rest in what seems like blinding light --

 Smallish Cave

 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel

 You shake your head, side to side, trying to push off the weight of
 weariness for another few minutes. Keep moving.

 You are in a smallish roundish cavern. Stalactites form heavy stone
 fringes across the ceiling. A wide path leads down, a low crack goes

 You catch a whiff of something rank from the low crack to the right.

 a twisting tunnel descends, and a wide passage leads ahead.

>wait

 You catch a whiff of something rank from the passage to the left.

 Cramped Room
 This is a cramped round room, with a high roof. Ropy pillars rise from
 floor to roof, and a small still pool lies to one side. Gravel and
 chipped rock cover the ground. A rough tunnel goes right, a narrow pit
 ascends, and a pit leads down.

 The scent of the creature hangs all around you. It's welling from the
 pit leading down.

>go down
 The pit opens abruptly into vast space.

 Top of Slope
 You emerge onto a steep slope, high above a canyon that stretches out
 of sight to either side. Twisted and stalactite-hung stone forms a
 vault overhead, which glimmers with reflections of some unseen source
 of light; but the canyon below is shadowed. Water rushes somewhere at
 its root. You could climb farther down, and a narrow crevice leads
 back into the rock.

 Movement, on a level area on the far side of the canyon, partway down.
 Something gliding silently back and forth, back and forth. Your prey.
 Waiting.

 Your foot slips. For a moment your fatigue flares into panic, as you
 clutch to steady yourself, but you know you are tired, tired. This
 must end soon. Too much blood. Too much stone.

>shoot prey
 Tunk. And you flinch at the hissing shriek that echoes up the cave
 walls.

 The dark shape flees -- not climbing, but running down the canyon
 slope, vanishing in the depths. Your thudding pulse slows.

 Moments later, barely sensed, the scent of blood. You have wounded the
 Wumpus.

 You turn, test your balance, and begin edging down the slope. And your

 You fling your arms out, heedless of your possessions. You grasp at
 nothing.

 Much too tired for this, you think, as you skid wildly down the
 canyon. A danger to yourself and everyone around you. And below, you
 add with distant amusement, before the bottom arrives with a horrible
 jolt.

>get bolt

 Base of Canyon
 You must be getting better at this. You're only freshly bruised. Lying
 still, even on cold stone, is painfully easy... but after a few
 minutes, you find yourself struggling to stand.

 You are in an alcove, a side chamber at the base of a vaulting canyon.
 The walls spread upward around you. And the distant roof is hung with
 glimmering stars -- droplet-tipped stalactites in some hidden
 suffusion of light. You think, against your will, that it was worth
 it.

 A crevice runs along the canyon at your feet. You can cross it and
 continue on ahead.

 The Wumpus certainly fled this way: a pool of thick, dark, reeking
 blood is spilled across the ground. Bats crawl all around it --
 rustling, fluttering, feasting.

 A pool of thick, dark, reeking blood is spilled across the ground.
 Bats crawl all around it -- rustling, fluttering, feasting.

 You are carrying a bolt, some cloth strips (tied around your wounded
 arm), a thighband with three bolts, and a cracked and darkened
 lamplens (on your wrist).

>SAVE

>examine blood
 Which do you mean, your bloody wound or the pool of blood?

>examine pool of blood
 The pool is clotted and dark, nearly black in this dim light. It is
 bitter and foul; it already smells of decay. And bats squat all around
 it.

>smell
 A violent bitter reek fills the air, overlying even the animal stink
 of the Wumpus's presence. The blood is cooling, but not yet dry.

>forward
 You heave yourself wearily over the crevice, and approach the twisted
 formations that make up the far canyon wall...

 And you round a pillar, and stop there. Here? Now?

 Canyon Wall
 Massive buttresses of stone rise all around you, climbing the canyon
 wall, flowing down again in cascades of pale fluorite. A path seems to
 climb up among them; but you don't think you can get to it right now.

 The Wumpus is crouched before you. Blood trickles from the wound your
 bolt tore, down its hide, puddling on the floor.

 It holds your crossbow in its claws; gently cradled; loaded and
 cocked; steady on your throat.

>SAVE

>duck
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>jump
 Jumping here would be fruitless.

>forward
 You take a tentative step towards the creature. And stop. The crossbow
 hasn't moved a fraction, but you see a claw moving restlessly on the
 trigger...

>back
 You back up, trying not to take your eyes from its eyes. It works, or
 the Wumpus decides to allow it.

 Base of Canyon
 You are in an alcove, a side chamber at the base of a vaulting canyon.
 The walls spread upward around you. And the distant roof is hung with
 glimmering stars -- droplet-tipped stalactites in some hidden
 suffusion of light. A crevice runs along the canyon at your feet. You
 can cross it and continue on ahead.

 You are carrying a bolt, some cloth strips (tied around your wounded

 lamplens (on your wrist).

>examine crevice
 A canyon in the canyon. It is only a couple of feet wide, though it
 seems to widen beneath. At the bottom, perhaps six feet below, water
 rushes. It is only a remnant of the river that carved this place; but
 it boils the more furiously for being confined.

 Another bats flutters down from above, and pushes into the mass.

 You are carrying a bolt, some cloth strips (tied around your wounded

 You carefully unwrap the cloth from your arm. The worst of the
 bleeding has stopped, although there is still a fierce ache and a slow
 trickle of blood.

>wave
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel
 foolish.

 A bat suddenly pokes its stained nose up above the pool, casting
 about.

>show blood to bats
 Which do you mean, your bloody wound or the pool of blood?

>show wounds to bats
 You can only do that to something animate.

>wave
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel

 The bats jostle each other around the pool.

 Two of the bats rattle up and begin circling above you.

 Several of the bats are fluttering in the air around you, ignoring the
 drying pool of blood nearby.

>again
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel
 foolish.

>again
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel

 In a rush, together and by no visible signal, the bats are airborne.
 The chittering cloud rises -- and then falls towards you.

 You scramble back, covering your eyes; too late. The swarm is on you,
 harrying you, small teeth and shrieks like shards of glass. You cannot
 see. You stumble away from the storm, and the stone falls away into
 rushing water beneath you.

 No doubt the bats find your body eventually.

 A cluster of bats flickers after you, chittering. You hunch your

 More bats are arriving, streaming across the canyon.

 Later, all you will be able to remember are its eyes. They are rich
 mud-brown, and they hold your own without effort.

 The swarm grows thicker, swirling above the Wumpus, which tosses its
 head around angrily before returning its gaze to you.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The Wumpus grunts, and swats at an overbold bat. The tiny shape
 shrieks and falls broken to the ground; but the Wumpus hisses as well,
 and shakes blood from its forelimb.

 And the swarm descends.

 The Wumpus flails furiously within a swarm of biting black shadows.

 The Wumpus is crouched before you. It sways forward and back, trying
 to escape the assault, and the crossbow wavers.

 Bats rush overhead in a vast wheeling cloud.

 The Wumpus turns towards you, shielding its face from the bats. There
 is understanding somewhere in there, what you have done to it and why
 -- and rage.

 It lunges at you, heedless now of what the bats might do; it only

 Streams of bats continue to converge and swarm towards the Wumpus. The

 Time passes.

 More bats are arriving, streaming across the canyon.

 Time passes.

 The swarm grows thicker, swirling above the Wumpus, which tosses its
 head around angrily before returning its gaze to you.

 Time passes.

 The Wumpus grunts, and swats at an overbold bat. The tiny shape
 shrieks and falls broken to the ground; but the Wumpus hisses as well,
 and shakes blood from its forelimb.

 And the swarm descends.

 You take a hesitant step sideways. And another, sliding past the
 beast, trying to be a thin part of the canyon wall...

 The Wumpus, lashing out at bats, doesn't seem to notice.

 Rising Path
 You are partway up the canyon wall, on a narrow path that climbs from
 ledge to ledge. The cavern is vast around you, water-hewn strata
 stretching upward to the stone forest of the roof; and somewhere above
 you, a crack of daylight sets it all glimmering...

 Down on the canyon floor, the Wumpus thrashes within a rustling black
 cloud. Dark growls rise to you.

 There are better targets.

 Those directions have meaning under the stars and the sun. These

 You are carrying a bolt, some cloth strips, a thighband with three

 There is a roar, and something huge lurches up the path. The dark eyes
 of the Wumpus peer out of a chittering swarm. There is understanding
 somewhere in there, what you have done to it and why -- and rage.

 It lunges at you, heedless now of what the bats might do; it only
 wants to reach you with its claws.

 Hunter, in Darkness
 A Cave Crawl by "Dave Ahl Jr." (Andrew Plotkin)
 First-time players should type "about".
 Release 4 / Serial number 991119 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/9


 Nearly -- nearly. The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your
 crossbow, try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.

 "This game was conceived of and fully outlined in early June of 1999."

 And it was, too. All that discussion of compassless games, and mazes,
 and whether "Hunt the Wumpus" was really IF, made me giggle. I already
 had this on the drawing board. I didn't start any of that discussion,
 either -- although I contributed a few comments that I knew would turn
 out relevant.

 Hunter, in Darkness came in eighth in the 1999 Interactive Fiction
 Competition. I might perhaps have done better if I'd included a
 walkthrough, or hints. Never know now, eh?

 I'm not including hints now, because this is no longer a Competition
 game. Different strictures apply. You can easily find a walkthrough,
 or ask for help. However, I will say this:

 No serious mapping is necessary, or even useful, in playing this game.
 If you think you need to start drawing a map, you're wrong.

 Type "credits" for full accreditation.

 Hunter, in Darkness is copyright 1999 by Andrew Plotkin,

 The usual credit to Graham Nelson, the creator of Inform, the
 development system which displayed its usual panache as I pounded this
 work into shape. Also Stephen Granade, who managed the 1999
 Interactive Fiction Competition.

 The madding crowd of beta-testers were: Adam Thornton, Magnus Olsson,
 Lucian P. Smith, Miron Schmidt, and of course Goob.

 Thanks also to all the Usenet grues who slavered out to post reviews,
 commentary, and replies to my post-Comp interrogation. You have
 contributed much to my understanding of what I messed up and what I
 didn't. Perhaps, two or three games from now, the lessons will even
 start to sink in.

 You creep up the passage, as stealthily as you can. It must be
 retreating ahead, for you see only empty stone, though the smell grows
 harsher...

>examine left pillar
 The passage is just a dark patch in the side of the pit, off to the
 side and far above the ledge you stand on. Its outline is ragged with
 stalactites and flowstone pillars where water has dripped for
 millennia down the pit walls. A rope is tied securely to one such
 pillar, and stretches across the pit.

>go up
 Ascent is impossible.

>go down
 You dangle your legs over the edge again, and turn and hang... and
 steel yourself, and drop.

 The stone blades that impale you probably aren't that large, in truth.
 You don't care. The sound of fluttering wings draws closer.

 A Cave Crawl by "Dave Ahl Jr." (Andrew Plotkin)
 First-time players should type "about".
 Release 4 / Serial number 991119 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/9


 Nearly -- nearly. The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your
 crossbow, try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.

>go down

 Edge Of Pit
 The passage drops off suddenly, ending in a deep pit. The sides are
 steep but not vertical; you might be able to scramble down, but you
 make no bets about climbing back up.

>examine pit
 The pit is edged in veined, knotted flowstone. A stiff climb,
 considering its steepness, but possible -- in descent.

 You can make out a ledge far below.

>examine floor
 The floor is irregular, water-worn.

>examine walls
 Limestone, streaked and banded, rippled and bulged and twisted like
 the flesh of some living thing. You've seen many caves before, but the
 beauty never wearies.

>examine ceiling
 Dark stone glistens overhead.

>examine me
 You're tired and covered with mud.

>examine crossbow
 The crossbow is well-designed enough to be simple. Laminated
 leaf-laths, fiber string, and a cocking lever that runs the full
 length of the stock.

 The bow is loaded with a bolt.

>go down
 You sit at the edge, turn, catch, and hang full-length against the
 wall. There ought to be a foothold...

 Well, perhaps not. You slam into the ledge and lean into stone, face
 and belly, trying not to slide any farther.

 Narrow Ledge
 After a moment you retake your balance, and turn. This ledge is barely
 two feet wide at most. You try not to feel like it's angled slightly
 outward. The pit stretches above and below you; but you can see no way
 to climb from here, either way.

 A gentle arc hangs across the pit, well above your head.

>examine ledge
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine floor
 You can make out the pit floor. It's only two or three body-lengths
 down; but the stone formations directly below you look vicious.

>examine stone
 (the stone blades)
 Sharp spires rise directly below you -- some chance result of dripping
 minerals and flowing water. If you try to descend farther, you'll slip
 and probably fall into them.

>examine pit above
 The pit walls are slick vertical limestone here, although you know
 they widen somewhere above.

>examine limestone
 Limestone, streaked and banded, rippled and bulged and twisted like
 the flesh of some living thing. You've seen many caves before, but the
 beauty never wearies.

>take bolt

 You extract the bolt from the crossbow.

 Nearly -- nearly. The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your

>r
 What do you want to drop?

>back
 You can't see any such thing.

>ahead
 You creep up the passage, as stealthily as you can. It must be
 retreating ahead, for you see only empty stone, though the smell grows
 harsher...

 And the eyes of the beast are on you, and claws come out of the night.

 The passage is just a dark patch in the side of the pit, off to the

 stalactites and flowstone pillars where water has dripped for
 millennia down the pit walls. A rope is tied securely to one such
 pillar, and hangs down the wall to a point above your head.

 pillar, hooked to itself with a curved white claw. The rope hangs down
 the wall to a point above your head.

>examine claw
 Long, curved, white -- it's a claw, a broken-off claw of the animal
 that you seek. Half the rope is still tied to it, and the makeshift
 grapple is wound precariously around a pillar by the right passage,

 It's a rope. Someone must have been trying to cross the pit. Yes, you

 white and curved.

 A step and a leap, and you clutch the rope. It's slicker than you

 abstractedly, as your hands slip, and catch, and slip again --

 Ouch. You've fetched up against the knot at the bottom of the rope;
 and the claw is biting into your hand. Razor-edged on the inside. You
 hope you never run into one of these alive -- ow. You've slipped
 again, and now both your hands are clamped around the claw, and your
 full weight is on them.

 Hanging From a Rope
 You are dangling at the end of the rope, against a sheer stone wall.
 Directly below you are vicious stone blades, and the claw you hang
 from is slowly slicing into your palms, and it hurts...

>climb rope
 You couldn't even hold in place on the rope, and that was before your
 hands were cut bloody. Climbing is impossible.

 Your fingers slip, and the claw-edge cuts a little deeper.

 Your fingers slip, and the claw-edge cuts a little deeper.

 You swing along the wall, fingers screaming at the extra strain.

 You twist back, forth, back, increasing your swing. Now -- you're

 Bottom of Pit
 You begin to drag yourself up. Ah -- no, you won't be putting any
 weight on your hands. They're badly torn up, and bleeding freely.

 This is the bottom of a wide pit. The walls are entirely unclimbable,
 of course. The floor is rippled and uneven, rising to sharp blades of
 stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but
 there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in
 the far corner.

 A twisted shape lies nearby.

 It's human.

 And it's been here a long time. He has, you think... or she, for all
 you know. There's little left to recall this broken shape to past
 life. The bones lie crumpled, clad in tatters of chewed black flesh.
 The clothes have fared somewhat better -- some resistant fiber -- but
 even they are brittle and rent.

 A bat flutters down from overhead. And another. You wave your arms,
 but they're keeping their distance.

>examine clothes
 The corpse is wrapped in rags gone colorless with time. The cloth is
 cracked and stained where it rested against flesh, but much is merely
 old.

 Blood continues to trickle down your fingers.

 More bats gather.

>get clothes
 The old fiber tears without too much strain. You manage to rip loose
 some strips from the loose hems, lying clear of the corpse. What
 remains behind, stained with old decay, you'd just as soon not touch.

 You are starting to feel quite chill and distant.

>inventory
 You are carrying some cloth strips, your crossbow, a thighband with
 four bolts (strapped to your leg), and a cracked but still glowing
 lamplens (on your wrist).

 A stream of bats flickers overhead, around, never settling. You wave
 again. They seem more attracted than frightened by your hand.

>wrap hand with cloth
 You quickly bind up your hands with the cloth. It stanches the
 bleeding, at least. You only hope that you can get to better care
 before infection sets in.

 stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but
 there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in
 the far corner.

 Bats flutter everywhere, just overhead.

 A twisted corpse lies nearby.

 The bats seem less agitated now.

 Something moves on the ground nearby. You twist around violently, but
 it's not approaching you; the bat is crouched over the blood-stained
 stone where you fell.

>go down
 You kneel, stiffly, and poke your head into the opening. It's tight,
 and it looks like it gets tighter ahead. No help for it -- you crawl
 inside, pushing the crossbow awkwardly ahead of you.

 Tight Crawl
 You're on your hands and knees in a throat of stone. The roof dips
 even lower ahead. If you advance, it'll be squirming forwards on your
 belly. And squirming backwards will be impossible, you think grimly.

>go down
 You can see no way through in that direction.

>ahead
 You hunch your elbows beneath your chest, and wiggle forward on them,
 into the gullet.

 Tight Crawl
 You stop, after a long silent time, to rest. Crawling is hard work,
 you know well, and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to
 it. But the crawl is no different here than anywhere. You have just
 enough room to raise your head, and there's nothing to see ahead but
 more stone to crawl through.

>ahead
 You begin determinedly working yourself forward, again.

 Tight Crawl
 The rock is lower above you. And narrower; you're lying full length
 now, your arms stretched out ahead, but still rough stone scrapes your
 shoulders. And you seem to be angling a bit downwards.

 Icy water is trickling past you.

 Your lamp flickers erratically. The moisture must be getting to its
 workings.

>ahead
 You continue. Scrabble with fingers, brace arms, push with toes. Shove
 the crossbow a bit farther ahead. You're definitely tilted head-down
 now. Is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you?

 Tight Crawl
 You lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your
 back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into
 unexpected stone. A cold stony knot presses into your left side, your
 right knee.

 You stretch forward once more, feeling for a few more inches before
 you continue.

 Splash.

 Your fingers are submerged in water.

>look

 Tight Crawl
 You lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your
 back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into
 unexpected stone. A cold stony knot presses into your left side, your
 right knee.

 A trickle of water runs past you, and merges into a shallow pool at
 your fingertips.

>ahead
 You stretch your hands forward, submerging them. Hunch, stretch.
 Inchworm... inchworm...

 Your arms are submerged, and water ripples at your chin. No room to
 lift your head. You turn your face to the side, cheek scraping against
 the damn everpresent stone, and stretch again.

 Your lamp flickers once and goes out.

 Tight Crawl
 You are lying in cold still water. It licks at your cheek and arms,
 and across the backs of your thighs. The chill makes your bruised
 knees and chest hurt all the more; your neck screams from craning high
 enough to breathe, but there is no room to sit up. No room to turn. No
 room.

>ahead
 You struggle on. You hope the water grows no deeper. That thought
 occupies you for a few more hunches, a few more stretches. Grow no
 deeper. If the water grows deeper... Grow no deeper. You shake that
 away, and nothing comes to replace it.

 You crawl on in the dark. The water grows no deeper.

 Maybe it's not as deep now?

 Tight Crawl
 Water trickles over your hands, but the floor must have risen; there
 is less of it... a note of hope. But you cannot see.

>ahead
 You thrust your shoulders forward. They stick.

>ahead
 You push again. It's just this spot; your hands are free in a wider
 area ahead. But immovable stone grates against your chest and
 shoulders.

>ahead
 You've got one shoulder past the edge. The other is behind a corner of
 stone, and you can't imagine how it's going to get through.

>ahead
 You brace your legs as best you can, and shove futilely against the
 trap.

>ahead
 You brace your legs as best you can, and shove futilely against the
 trap.

 You are never going to leave this place.

>ahead
 You brace your legs as best you can, and shove...

 It feels like scraping flesh from bone, but your shoulder tears past
 the edge. You lie and gasp for a moment, and then work your torso
 painfully through the gap.

 The passage slants sharply down now, but it's widening. It's widening.
 You half-crawl, half-slide downward, dragging your legs out of the
 gap, and come to rest in what seems like blinding light --

 Smallish Cave
 Eventually, you manage to sit up and look around.

 And you round a pillar, and stop there. Here? Now?

 Canyon Wall
 Massive buttresses of stone rise all around you, climbing the canyon
 wall, flowing down again in cascades of pale fluorite. A path seems to
 climb up among them; but you don't think you can get to it right now.

 The Wumpus is crouched before you. Blood trickles from the wound your
 bolt tore, down its hide, puddling on the floor.

 It holds your crossbow in its claws; gently cradled; loaded and
 cocked; steady on your throat.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>back
 You back up, trying not to take your eyes from its eyes. It works, or
 the Wumpus decides to allow it.

 Base of Canyon
 You are in an alcove, a side chamber at the base of a vaulting canyon.
 The walls spread upward around you. And the distant roof is hung with
 glimmering stars -- droplet-tipped stalactites in some hidden
 suffusion of light. A crevice runs along the canyon at your feet. You
 can cross it and continue on ahead.

 A pool of thick, dark, reeking blood is spilled across the ground.
 Bats crawl all around it -- rustling, fluttering, feasting.

>examine bats
 Bats squat all around the spill of clotting blood. They do not seem to
 be paying you much heed; they are intent on their feast.

 A bat chitters angrily at its neighbor.

>examine blood
 Which do you mean, your bloody wound or the pool of blood?

>examine blood pool
 The pool is clotted and dark, nearly black in this dim light. It is
 bitter and foul; it already smells of decay. And bats squat all around
 it.

>inventory
 You are carrying some cloth strips (tied around your wounded hands), a
 thighband with three bolts (strapped to your leg), and a cracked and
 darkened lamplens (on your wrist).

 ...And no crossbow. Right.

>take cloth
 You already have those.

>remove cloth
 You carefully unwrap the cloth from your hands. The worst of the
 bleeding has stopped, although there is still a fierce ache and a slow
 trickle of blood.

>show cloth to bats
 You can only do that to something animate.

>dip cloth in blood
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>wave
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel
 foolish.

 A bat suddenly pokes its stained nose up above the pool, casting
 about.

>wave
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel
 foolish.

>wave
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel
 foolish.

 Two of the bats rattle up and begin circling above you.

>wave
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel
 foolish.

>wave
 You put your hands up in the air and wave them like -- you feel
 foolish.

 Several of the bats are fluttering in the air around you, ignoring the
 drying pool of blood nearby.

>ahead
 A cluster of bats flickers after you, chittering. You hunch your
 shoulders and try to ignore them.

 You heave yourself wearily over the crevice, and approach the twisted
 formations that make up the far canyon wall.

 Canyon Wall
 Massive buttresses of stone rise all around you, climbing the canyon
 wall, flowing down again in cascades of pale fluorite. A path seems to
 climb up among them; but you don't think you can get to it right now.

 The Wumpus is crouched before you. Blood trickles from the wound your
 bolt tore, down its hide, puddling on the floor. It holds your
 crossbow in its claws; gently cradled; loaded and cocked; steady on
 your throat.

 The bats dive forward, then rise, emitting glass-shrill cries.

>wait
 Time passes.

 More bats are arriving, streaming across the canyon.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The swarm grows thicker, swirling above the Wumpus, which tosses its
 head around angrily before returning its gaze to you.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The Wumpus grunts, and swats at an overbold bat. The tiny shape
 shrieks and falls broken to the ground; but the Wumpus hisses as well,
 and shakes blood from its forelimb.

 And the swarm descends.

>go up
 You take a hesitant step sideways. And another, sliding past the
 beast, trying to be a thin part of the canyon wall...

 The Wumpus, lashing out at bats, doesn't seem to notice.

 Rising Path
 You are partway up the canyon wall, on a narrow path that climbs from
 ledge to ledge. The cavern is vast around you, water-hewn strata
 stretching upward to the stone forest of the roof; and somewhere above
 you, a crack of daylight sets it all glimmering...

 Down on the canyon floor, the Wumpus thrashes within a rustling black
 cloud. Dark growls rise to you.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The Wumpus screams.

>go up
 You pick your way... slowly... up the canyon wall. Everything is
 heavy; you're glad you have nothing more to carry.

 Somewhere below, a hissing scream is cut off, abruptly. You round a
 pale fold of limestone, and you are blinded by daylight.
