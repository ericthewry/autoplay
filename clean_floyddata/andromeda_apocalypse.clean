 Down on the horizon, thunderstorms cloud the sky. But the sea is fresh,
 and the air has taken on that orange hue.

 It's just a perfect day.

 Korhos is setting. Its outer halo burns with no warmth. Loud waves
 splash on the sand half a dozen meters from your feet. The deep blue of

 Shore
 Korhos is setting. Its outer halo burns with no warmth. Loud waves

 The morning is brilliant.

 You can see Uncle Oren here.

>examine oren
 Division, during your first year of assignment as a teacher and
 researcher. A man well in his seventies, he always looked sturdy and
 healthy.

 Lately, his retirement seems to have struck him quite a blow. His hair
 has gone completely white, his posture slouched and his voice has got
 that sad croaking. He is staring at the horizon like a bird in search
 of a migratory route.

 A white electric arc paints the southern sky.

>ask oren about hyerotrope

 "It is so beautiful, isn't it, Ektor?" Uncle Oren says, pointing at the
 landscape. "It looks like Paradise."

 "It does," you reply.

 Oren sends a glance to the west, towards Grey Cape, saying: "I wonder
 what a man who was born here -- I mean here, on Monarch -- would think,
 looking at this place. The sun, the sea going orange, the endless sky."

>talk to oren

 "Yeah. So what do you think?" He turns to face you but stops,
 distracted by the impending storm.

 "It is breathtaking."

>talk to oren
 Indigenes or sat-born." That said, he sits on his heels and grabs a
 handful of sand. From it, picking lightly, he extracts a small, green
 crab and puts it on his other hand. "I don't know if I deserve an
 afterlife. I haven't done much evil in my days, but maybe our god has
 another point of view. What I know is: if I have to have a life after
 death, I hope it is in a place like this." He gets near the shore and
 neatly drops the crab into the water.

 "Hell," he exclaims. "I'd stay here for the rest of eternity, if you
 asked me!"

 Thunder rumbles from the horizon.

 "You know, Andy and I found something last week. It's a sort of...

 He turns to face you. He looks extremely tired, and you notice it for
 the first time. "Your research?"

 "Yes."

 "If it's Uni work, then," he says, banishing the subject with the back
 of his hand, "it's best discussed at Uni. Don't waste the moment, son.
 There will be time. This sunset won't last forever, and the next one is
 due in eighty weeks."

 almost a minute he stays silent.

 Then, when you begin to think he's done, he says: "The wind is growing
 stronger. It's a hell of a storm, that one incoming."

 It turns out that the universe is uneven, in the end. A black spot

 where the stars seem to be missing.

 A sort of shining crescent cuts the dark presence in half.

 The Hyerotrope approaches the dark shape, as it starts engulfing a vast
 amount of space in front of you. You strain your eyes until you discern
 other brilliances in the multiplying crescent.

 Finally, you catch the meaning of what you are looking at.

 The black gap in the sky is a gigantic structure, of a size and type
 you've never seen before. In comparison, even the Mechanostations
 around Monarch are dwarfed. Around it, thousands of other objects, like
 drifting debris, float meaninglessly. The reflections on them create a
 kaleidoscope of twirling lights.

 As you get near the metal horde you begin mentally assessing the
 situation....



 ...until, suddenly, the Hyerotrope starts spinning out of control.

 There is a strong shock, then you find yourself...

 The crumpled, alien wreckage -- the thing the Ancients have named "the

 You are floating away, drifting on the last raft the universe has
 given you. Even the stars provide no light.

 A crumpled, alien wreckage lays at your feet.

>examine raft


 The perfect demisphere in which you stand is half of the
 star-traveling machine you used to escape Judgement Day on your home
 planet, Monarch. Thinking back to the moment, you realize it was the
 Hyerotrope who used you, instead. Leaving the planet was <span class="floydstyle em">not</span>
 your plan to begin with, and you could have done without it even in
 the end. You still puzzle at how exactly things went, after all.

 The Hyerotrope's walls, although perfectly dark from the outside, seem
 to be totally transparent from the inside. You can see the universe.

>examine universe


 The Monarch system is already too far to be seen. In its place, a
 pulsating nebula is starting to spread, the three suns devoured in its
 growing belly.

 The fabric of the universe, in the direction to which the Hyerotrope
 is floating, seems to be disrupted. A dark presence lingers in space,
 breaking the pattern of the stars.

>examine dark presence


 It turns out that the universe is uneven, in the end. A black spot
 stains a single point -- the magnitude of which you can but imagine --
 where the stars seem to be missing.

 A sort of shining crescent cuts the dark presence in half.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Low corridor</span>
 A wormhole dug into rusty metal and torn pipes, the curving tunnel

 The tunnel ends here.

 A jutting ledge floats over the void that opens into the east side of
 the tunnel, through a gap in the wall.

 Beside the ledge is a single turret, one meter tall, surmounted by a
 strange device.

 The ledge retracts to its resting position.

>examine ledge


 The side of the tunnel is open and falls towards blackness below your
 feet. The ledge looks like a trampoline of sorts. Beyond the gap is a
 twin tunnel, at least five meters out of reach.

 There is a single turret on this side, one meter tall, surmounted by a

 A wormhole dug into rusty metal and torn pipes, the curving tunnel

 A gap in the west wall opens into darkness. On the other side, an
 extended ledge is suspended over the void.

 [You have earned the <span class="floydstyle i">The Leaper</span> achievement]

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Corridor</span>
 The space widens in all directions. The bigger tunnel in which you
 stand is a replica of the lower ones, starting southwest of here. Same
 environment, except for different proportions. The ceiling is at least
 ten meters above you, and the wormhole is equally wide. To the south,
 it clogs into a strange valve, like an intestine curtain of steel. To
 the east and northeast, two glass paneled doors open into similar,
 sterile rooms. The high corridor continues to the north.

>examine valve


 It looks like a camera's shutter. Several two meter long laminas
 intersect to form an air-tight valve. It is now closed, concealing its
 destination.

 On the side of the valve is a lever.

>examine lever


 You see nothing special about the lever.

>pull lever


 You pull the lever but the valve only shifts a little, while the dim
 light in the corridor gets dimmer. Maybe it needs more power.

>go east


 (first opening the east glass door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Laboratory</span>
 A sterile room, every wall filled by glass cases of the same size and
 shape. It opens west through a glass paneled door.

 A series of glass cases covers all the walls of this tiny room. They
 are all dark and empty, except for a single one, whose interior is lit
 by a pure white strobing flash.

>examine case


 The case is filled with white light, and nothing else. It can be
 opened.

>open case


 You pull the handle then release it. The small door closes back
 pneumatically in a few seconds.

 Something strange happens.

 A faint... wind caresses your right arm as the case closes. It feels
 like someone is breathing in your ears with levity. A sort of...
 buzzing can be heard around you.

 It could easily have been your imagination.

 (first opening the northeast glass door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northeast Laboratory</span>
 The room is exceptionally blank. Its walls are lined with polished
 metal and there's no furniture, apart from a single, weighty table in
 its center.

>examine table


 It looks like a metal table, but only because it is made from a
 horizontal slab and four legs. It is polished to exhaustion. It looks
 like an examination desk.

 Just by chance you drop a glance down and discover something. Under
 the table is a steel grate, leading into darkness.

>examine grate


 It holds on heavy hinges. You can (maybe) open it and check what's
 inside.

>open grate


 You pull up the grate and look inside. Darkness welcomes you. When you
 release the grate, it slowly closes back.

>examine reflection


 You can't see any such thing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Corridor</span>
 Another portion of the same tunnel. Your eyes start to get used to the
 dim light and round shapes. The steel wormhole continues north into a
 wide chamber, and runs south into its next section. Lights flicker
 dimly, seemingly powered by vanishing batteries. To the east, a bulky
 shutter stands closed. To the southwest, beyond a glass panel, is a
 dimly lit room, with strange machinery on the inside.

 You can just guess the shape from this side of the darkened glass.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Freezing Chamber</span>
 A sort of warehouse, this large chamber is filled with cases and
 wiring, all inter-tangling like cerebrum synapses. Large tubes come

 A larger container -- three meters tall, two meters wide and deep --

 It is very cold in here. The air must be well below freezing. You can
 barely breathe.

 A large metal and glass container, from which freezing smoke descends
 like a cheap cinema effect. Bulky hoses are plugged into its sides. A
 sort of porthole opens in its side.

 The intense cold starts crawling under your exposed skin.

 You leave the cold environment of the corridors to enter a much wider

 Light in here gets dimmer, as the only source is several meters up

 several tunnels, each lined by railways. Many of the holes are
 shuttered by heavy bulkheads, while others lead into darkness, way out
 of reach. On the opposite side, the circular room enters the high

 A lone wagon, an open boat hanging over rails, sits undamaged at the
 beginning of the ramp.

 On the lone wagon is a rusty console.

 Lately, his retirement seems to have struck him quite a blow. His hair
 has gone completely white, his posture slouched and his voice has got
 that sad croaking. He is staring at the horizon like a bird in search
 of a migratory route, holding a glass of water from which he drinks
 from time to time.

 "So," Oren asks, "do <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> believe in afterlife?"

 You stare at him. "I... I don't know."

 Oren takes a look at Grey Cape, to the west. Some gulls are circling
 its southernmost rock. "I don't, either. But... all of this, all this

 "Well," you argue, "every minute is a treasure, they say. A show can
 be pretty interesting even if it lasts only a second. You know, some
 elementary particles' lives are so short..."

 "Don't lecture me, reg," Oren interrupts you. A smile cuts his face in
 two. "I was a scientist and a teacher <span class="floydstyle em">ages</span> before you. What I
 mean is: Is this show just for us? Apart from how long it lasts -- or
 how long <span class="floydstyle em">we</span> last -- don't you think it would deserve a better

 You cough. "Are you talking about... other, more... durable,

 "I am," he says.

 The thunderstorm is getting closer.

 You prefer following the flow of the conversation.

 "So that the show wouldn't require an afterlife..."

 "Indeed."

 You laugh. "So you'd rather believe in aliens than in Heavens."

 "We don't <span class="floydstyle em">need</span> Heavens. And thinking that Big Mama Kohr is
 there just for our own, miserable eyes is showing incredible
 arrogance."

 "You'd feel at home with Andy and Marion. They are believers. I stay

 there never has been any proof of another single life form in the
 known part of the galaxy. And that's a very <span class="floydstyle em">large</span> amount of

 Oren laughs. He raises his glass in front of your eyes and looks
 through. "Let's imagine," he says, "that we filled this glass with
 water from the sea. Now, you can easily see we caught no fish in it,
 right?"

 You nod, silently.

 "So: would you <span class="floydstyle em">dare</span> say, given the glass is empty, that there
 are no fish in the <span class="floydstyle em">ocean</span>?"

 Ektor, not us. We can only hope their legacy, the legacy of the stars,
 will be soft on us. 'Cause we just don't compare."

 He takes a fair gulp from the glass, then puts it back on the table.
 His eyes wander again towards the impending thunderstorm.

 "By Fat," he laughs, in the end. "Using your measuring method, if we
 caught something in here, we'd say that was the biggest fish in the
 sea. But the sea is endless, Ektor," he smiles. "The sea can host such
 awesome creatures that won't even fit this glass. Squids, sharks..."

 A segment of the dome has been retracted. Through it the supernova
 looks far brighter. The white light is piercing through your
 unprotected retina like a warm knife through butter.

 The radiation coming from the supernova, now that the protecting
 layers of the glass dome have been retracted, blows through you like a
 soft summer breeze. In a few seconds you are incinerated from the
 inside.

 A hexagonal room, lined in plaster and steel, with six doors opening

 This six-sided room reminds you of the chess training grounds in which
 you used to spend your spare time during your first years in
 Brouguoise, before they hired you at the University of Monarch: The
 size, roughly the same; the white, featureless walls -- a sort of
 dramatic fashion of the times in which the Campus was built; the
 plain, cold light that fills the place. But most of all, what strikes
 you as a perfect mimic is the object filling the center of the room.

 Two men, seated and facing each other, play a game around a six-sided
 table, in an everlasting match.

>distract man


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine game


 They are made of stone. Sitting, immobile, staring at the center of
 the table, in a replica of a very slow, endless game of chess.

 You begin wondering. <span class="floydstyle em">What has happened to these people? Is this</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">really a sculpture or...?</span>

 As an answer, you hear a faint beep coming from the north.

>examine men


 They are made of stone. Sitting, immobile, staring at the center of
 the table, in a replica of a very slow, endless game of chess.

>get rook


 You can't see any such thing.

>get pieces

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thousand Lights Room</span>
 A six-sided room, again. Each wall is covered in a myriad of tiny
 bulbs, each one the size of a bee's eye. Most of the lights are off.
 On the east wall, a ten-by-twenty centimeter spot just below a small
 viewscreen bears a series of five symbols, printed in an obscure,
 alien language. The room is then empty, except for a large cubic
 device placed against its northern wall.

>examine symbols


 A series of five symbols, printed in a language you don't comprehend.
 Obviously alien.

>examine device


 It looks like an examination table.

 Another, stronger beep fills the room. All of a sudden, many of the
 dormant lights come to life and the whole room is turned into a dance
 floor. The air starts circulating -- probably the air conditioning
 kicking in -- and something appears above the large cubic device and
 on the small viewscreen.

>examine viewscreen


 The viewscreen shows a big, green eye.

>wink at eye


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>say hello


 (to LOGAN)
 I don't know what you are referring to.

>examine device


 A cone of green light goes from the ceiling to the table's top. Inside
 it, a smaller beam runs to cover all its surface. It reminds you of a
 3D scanner you once toyed with in Brouguoise.

>put disk on device


 You can't see any such thing.

>put disc on device


 Hesitantly, you put the golden disc onto the table's top. As soon as
 you retract your arms, the green beam starts covering the disc's
 surface, scanning it in the process. When it's done, a metallic voice
 comes out of somewhere:

 LOGAN://"Galaxy Ex-NOVA -- -cal. Ghjugaak, hysndee akim akimaa tota"//

 A series of sounds follows -- waves, wind, thunder -- then you can
 slowly hear some... music coming out of the device.

 <span class="floydstyle em">This is the music recorded on the disc,</span> you murmur. <span class="floydstyle em">It</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">is... it is trying to learn from disc.</span>

 A long array of spoken words -- many of which you never heard before,
 some guttural, others quite musical, mixed with ones from your own
 language -- closes the show. At the end, the green light vanishes, in
 its place a holographic image.

 The last word from the speakers, the very voice of this station's main
 computer, you guess, is: "LOGAN."

>ask logan about earth


 You tell the computer what you know about the galaxy, the planets and

 Member's speech, but then, word by word, his alien language starts
 mixing with your own.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Impressive. It's really learning just from listening to me</span>.


 The holographic picture on the cubic device changes.

>examine hologram


 The hologram now shows a couple of human beings, probably a man and a
 woman, depicted in a rough style. They seem to be holding each others'
 hands.

 On the large cubic device is a golden disc.

>ask logan about logan


 LOGAN://"Cannot compute. Sample doesn't match."

>ask logan about me


 LOGAN://"Cannot compute. Sample doesn't match."

>ask logan about people


 You look at the two figures and start belaboring, as lightheartedly as
 it gets in these hard times, about the human race. You speak about the
 ages, the history, the legacy of mankind. At the end, you fail to keep
 a tear from rolling down your cheek.

 LOGAN seems unimpressed as, again, it goes on calculating the many
 facets of your own existence.


 A new, dark hologram fills the space above the examination table on
 the cubic device.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Second Station</span>
 In here rails depart into several holes that plunge into darkness. A
 set of secondary tunnels leaves from the north and northeast while, to
 the west, a much larger highway is lit by a strong flashing strobe.

 A lone wagon, an open boat hanging over rails, sits undamaged at the
 end of the ramp.

 On the lone wagon is a rusty console.

 LOGAN://"This is the sternbound hub for the railways of the
 <span class="floydstyle i">Arcadia</span>. I'm afraid that most of the routes are either clogged
 or powerless."

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Through Belmont and Keller</span>
 As you enter the brilliant avenue of steel and plaster, you are choked
 with panic.

 The wide tunnel is an unbelievably perfect replica of a place you know
 far too well. The curving ceiling, the polished walls, the shining
 lights that strobe in your eyes: All is coming at you from the recent
 past, from your last steps into what you once dared call civilization.

 This looks like the section of highway that dives under the Garath
 Sea, west of Brouguoise and back home in Capital Monarch, to all the
 people in town known as "Belmont and Keller", after the avenues it
 runs through. No cars, no traffic and no toll booth, but all the rest
 is here, replicated tile-by-tile.

 It takes you about three minutes to recover from the shock. After
 that, memories of a gone world start tumbling in your forehead like a
 cascade of freezing water.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Gone</span>, you sigh. <span class="floydstyle em">Gone. Gone. Gone</span>.

 A giant gate, several bars lining up like matches in a box, blocks the
 way to the west, where the tunnel continues.

 With a soft, pneumatic sound, the bars of the gate lift to the
 ceiling, into which they almost completely sink.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Through Belmont and Keller, other side of the gate</span>
 The tunnel runs east to west, into a very big chamber.

 The bars of the gate are lifted and now stick into the ceiling like a

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the Mouth of the Whale</span>
 You begin to realize the actual size of the giant structure you have
 shipwrecked on the very moment the open space in front of you is
 revealed.

 At least six hundred meters wide, two hundred high and... well, three
 kilometers long, the hangar could probably harbor all of your
 skyscraper block in Monarch with spare room for a garden and a
 supermarket. The place has been trashed by some unknown force, a lot
 of its old content scattered around and devastated.

 The docks are to the northwest, west and southwest, while south and
 north the enormous chamber continues, among debris, spare ship parts,
 crates and boxes of every kind and size.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Docks</span>
 The mouth of the ship is open and shouting at the universe. All of the
 bulkheads are retracted, leaving a unique sight for your sore eyes. In
 absence of an atmosphere, the sky is crystalline and every shadow is
 intense as if painted with a black varnish. A soft wind caresses your
 skin and you shiver at the thought of its origin.

 <span class="floydstyle em">This is beyond science. It's magic, </span>you consider.

 After a -- long -- walk, you reach this corner of the docks area.

 This is the southernmost side of the giant mouth opening into the sky.
 Apart from broken equipment and trashed boxes, the place is worthless.

 Or maybe not.

 In the darkest corner of the hangar, a solitary, forgotten cabinet
 stands evidence of a former life.

 LOGAN://"During the large amount of <span class="floydstyle i">time</span> the docks have been

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Docks</span>
 The mouth of the ship is open and shouting at the universe. All of the
 bulkheads are retracted, leaving a unique sight for your sore eyes. In
 absence of an atmosphere, the sky is crystalline and every shadow is
 intense as if painted with a black varnish. A soft wind caresses your
 skin and you shiver at the thought of its origin.

 The remnants of a foundered ship are jabbed into the pavement near the
 open bay. A broken wing emerges from the metal floor like a rampaging
 shark aimed at a flying prey.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Docks, north</span>
 After a -- long -- walk, you reach this corner of the docks area.

 This is the northernmost side of the giant mouth opening into the sky.
 There is nothing here but debris and piles of broken crates.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hangar, north</span>
 After a -- long -- walk, you reach this corner of the docks area.

 The place is a mess. Crates and equipment pieces are scattered all
 around the floor, remains of a devastating incident. The hangar
 continues south, southwest and west.

 A sort of egg-like pod shines, through the debris, under a transparent
 tube coming off of the ceiling.

>examine pod


 A glass and metal egg-shaped pod, containing just a seat.

>talk to logan


 LOGAN://"The <span class="floydstyle i">nav-pod</span> is the fastest way to travel the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the Mouth of the Whale</span>
 At least six hundred meters wide, two hundred high and three

 A sort of egg-like pod shines, through the debris, under a transparent
 tube coming off of the ceiling.

>go pod


 You get into the pod.

 LOGAN://"This is a nav-pod. You can use it to travel to different
 sections of the ship. The one still available, at least: the power

 The tube enters the ceiling and disappears into a dark hole.

>ask logan about 29port


 LOGAN://"Actually, bay 2, level 9, port section is the port hangars.
 You are here already."

>logan, 71port


 LOGAN://"Navigating!"


 The nav-pod is sucked into the tube and sent running through dark
 tunnels. In a few minutes you find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle i">The Reliquary</span> (in the pod)
 There is a place, in your heart, where you are sure all the grievous
 moments will play a ghastly rehearsal for the rest of the life you
 still have to live. A place where the same striking images follow one
 after the other as a sort of stop-motion nightmare with just three
 frames.

 The first one is the earth opening beneath your feet and devouring
 your world. The second, the very moment you unknowingly said goodbye
 to Andy and to everything you had.

 The third is now flickering in your face as a film about to burn.

 A dark, metal-plated room. The ceiling ten meters above. The floor a
 matrix of ebony-colored tiles. A cave, you would call it. A cave of
 the soul.

 And then a sphere: A dark, shiny sphere -- your enemy, your nemesis --
 breathing slowly in the east side of the room, its thousand
 luminescent tentacles strangling reality and changing it at its will.

 The Hyerotrope, the end of all life.

 Half buried in the ground, as per the first time you met each other in
 the fiery depths of drowning Monarch, its four dots are blinking in
 the dark.

 LOGAN://"This is your <span class="floydstyle i">vessel</span>, Ektor Mastiff. This is the only
 way you have out of this galaxy."

 But you don't listen. There's a voice in your head whispering deathly
 words.

 "What for," you ask yourself. "This is just... just..."

 LOGAN://"Unfortunately, it seems that the <span class="floydstyle i">corruption</span> has done
 too much damage to the ship. The object you call the <span class="floydstyle i">Hyerotrope</span>
 has sunk into the floor."

 [You have earned the <span class="floydstyle i">Flying the Egg</span> achievement]

>examine hyerotrope


 The Hyerotrope has sunk into the ground far more than the one you
 discovered in the depths of Monarch. A door is open on its side, half
 hidden by the floor but still enterable to the east. Four red dots
 line up above the opening, eyes you cannot inquire.

>examine dots


 The four dots are all lit. This means the Hyerotrope is alive and
 kicking.

 The Hyerotrope, the end of all life.

 Half buried in the ground, its four dots are blinking in the dark.

 As you would expect, the Hyerotrope door opens around you and lets you
 in.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Vessel</span>
 The translucent walls of this Hyerotrope are no different from any
 others you have seen. The half-sphere in which you stand is empty and
 static.

 LOGAN://"The <span class="floydstyle i">corruption</span> has gone too far. The <span class="floydstyle i">vessel</span> is
 trapped in the floor of the ship."

 You check the walls of the Hyerotrope, but there is no reaction from
 them.

 LOGAN://"It seems you are stuck here, Ektor Mastiff. I'm sorry to
 inform you that the omega <span class="floydstyle i">supernova</span> will be reaching the

 You shrug.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Whatever the route I take, what will be the difference? World's</span>

 But you are not listening. In your mind, and in your eyes, there is
 only one image...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Terrace</span>
 The thin air of the evening is picking at you, leaned against the rail
 of the balcony, shoulders tossed at the first darkness in ages.

 Your friend and colleague Andy Re's is here, leaning against the
 banister and looking at the city.

>talk to andy re


 I only understood you as far as wanting to talk to Andy Re's.

> x andy


 Your best colleague and, most of all, your best friend. He shares your
 studies and your passions. If you ever had a brother it would have
 been him. He looks a bit battered. The events of the last few days
 must have put a lot of stress on him.

>andy, chin up


 You prefer following the flow of the conversation.

 Andy turns to face you. He seems resolute, but also tired to death.

 "You understand the importance of what we are doing, right?"

 You nod.

 "You understand the importance of your delivery, right?"

 You smile, uncomplaining.

>ask logan about corruption


 I don't know what you are referring to.

>talk to andy


 "So?" Andy baits you.

 "So... I don't know. I don't know why it can't be you. I mean: The
 Committee will trust you more than me, being the veteran and so on..."

 "A veteran? I've been walking in the Campus seven months more than
 you. If that's being a veter..."

 "You know what I mean," you stop him.

 "Actually," he smiles, turning to face the city again, "I don't.
 What's up, Doc?"

>examine city


 The city goes on forever, until the curve of the horizon or the ocean
 puts an end to its travels. There are thousands of lights, shining
 more than the stars themselves.

>talk to andy


 You fill your lungs and wait for the fresh air to make you dizzy. You
 are in need of more energy and can't tell if you'll ever find enough.

 "Fact is," you start, "I'm not exactly sure about our motives, Andy."

 "Our motives? What are you talking about, man? This may be the most
 important discovery in our history and you need a <span class="floydstyle em">motive</span> to
 go public?"

 "Yeah, I need it. They don't seem to be paying much attention, don't
 you think? Have you heard from them, lately? Everybody knows what we
 are doing but nobody cares. That's a fact."

 "So you need the psychological support..."

>again


 "It's not like that. Don't paint me as an idiot. I mean... Did you
 ever think about it? No noise, mate. No noise at all. You know how it
 sounds to me?"

 Andy turns to face you again. "Nope," he sais. "How does it sound?"

 "Sounds like it's pointless. I mean: All the time spent, the research.
 And no one gives a damn. No one called. No one paid attention. And
 this sounds like it's pointless. Why are we doing this? What's the
 research for? Ten years, mate. Ten years and now we know something
 big, no one fucking cares."

 "Can I ask you a question, Ektor?" Andy leaves the balcony, enters his
 room and comes back a moment later with his copy of the files you are
 holding in your hands.

>say no

 (to Andy Re's)
 You prefer following the flow of the conversation.

 "Go on," you say.

 "What do you think it is our job is made of? Being a scientist." You
 pause a second. "Knowing something and then having to tell the world?"

 "Well, no..."

 "Well, <span class="floydstyle em">yes</span>. That is exactly what I think being a scientist
 means. Spreading the news. Having... secrets, stories untold that you
 have to <span class="floydstyle em">tell</span>. It's all about that. When you know something
 that you think is important, or even half-important, you have to tell
 the world, Ektor. You have to spread the news and give away the
 secret. Even if the world doesn't care. <span class="floydstyle em">Especially</span> if the
 world doesn't care."

 He rushes through the pages of the Report, flipping them like a card
 dealer, stopping only when the back-cover is uppermost. Then, with a
 patient smile filled with the stubborn resolution you've known for so
 much time, he points at you and says:

 "Maybe it is our only meaning, Ektor. Letting the knowledge survive.
 Even if it has to survive us."

 Suddenly there is a flash on the horizon, followed by a low, terrible
 rumble.

 <span class="floydstyle em">It's a hell of a storm, that one</span>, you think. <span class="floydstyle em">And it just</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">came to our doorstep.</span>

>ask logan about shock


 LOGAN://"The only way I can think of is activating the ship's
 <span class="floydstyle i">self-destruction</span> system. It will deflagrate taking down the
 bridges from 10 to 1 sequentially. The resulting shocks should be
 enough to free the Hyerotrope and thus free yourself. This system
 would be <span class="floydstyle i">destroyed</span> in the process, but there is no protocol I
 would break to let you do it."

>ask logan about self-destruction


 LOGAN://"To activate the self-destruction sequence, you have to first
 get back to the Forebridge, in bay 2, level 9 port section."

>ask logan about destrpyed


 LOGAN://"I cannot compute, sorry."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mixer</span>
 A small room, no window, just a thin slot for air conditioning.

 The north wall harbors a bulky keyboard, lit up by several buttons.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Observatory Room</span>
 At least fifty meters wide, this semi-circular room must have been the
 observatory lounge for the inhabitants' spare time. A set of tables
 and seats form a theater of sorts, for tonight's show of the universe.
 A glass dome, covering all the south side of the room and part of the
 ceiling, is open to the stars. The high corridor is to the northwest,
 while a second, tighter tunnel departs from the northeast. In the
 northern wall, a metal ladder heads up into an opening.

>go north


 You can't go that way.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Corridor</span>
 The bigger tunnel in which you stand is a replica of the lower ones,
 starting southwest of here. Same environment, except for different
 proportions. The ceiling is at least ten meters above you, and the
 wormhole is equally wide. To the south, it clogs into a strange valve,
 like an intestine curtain of steel. To the east and northeast, two
 glass paneled doors open into similar, sterile rooms. The high
 corridor continues to the north.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Corridor</span>
 The steel wormhole continues north into a wide chamber, and runs south
 into its next section. Lights flicker dimly. To the east, a bulky
 shutter stands closed. To the southwest is a dimly lit room, with
 strange machinery on the inside.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Train Station</span>
 Light in here gets dimmer, as the only source is several meters up
 ahead, on the distant ceiling. In front of you, a ramp runs into
 several tunnels, each lined by railways. Many of the holes are
 shuttered by heavy bulkheads, while others lead into darkness, way out
 of reach. On the opposite side, the circular room enters the high
 corridor to the south.

 A lone wagon, an open boat hanging over rails, sits undamaged at the
 beginning of the ramp.

 On the lone wagon is a rusty console.

>enter wagon


 You get onto the lone wagon.

 On the lone wagon you can see a rusty console.

>push red button. g


 The wagon departs!

 After a short while you find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle i">Crossroads</span> (on the lone wagon)
 The tube opens into a crossed path. The rails cross a few meters
 ahead, providing passages in all four cardinal directions.

 A signpost is hanging from the ceiling, a fluorescent symbol faintly
 glowing in the dark. The symbol is now plus-shaped.

 On the lone wagon you can see a rusty console.

 The wagon departs!

 After a short while you find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle i">Second Station</span> (on the lone wagon)

 set of secondary tunnels leaves from the north and northeast while, to
 the west, a much larger highway is lit by a strong flashing strobe.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hexagon</span>
 A hexagonal room, lined in plaster and steel, with six doors opening
 into six more locations. Three of them look dead, while the others
 glow or flicker to different rhythms. To the south is the dark tunnel
 leading to the railway station; to the northwest and north the
 functioning exits.

 LOGAN://"You can recognize the Commanders' area by the unique shape of
 the rooms. Most are six-sided, like this one. Due to the power
 leakage, some of the doors have rested shut for so much <span class="floydstyle i">time</span>
 they are now useless. You can take the two still working to gain
 access to the Commanders' Quarters, to the north, or the Forebridge,
 to the northwest."

>talk to logan


 LOGAN://"The many broken doors lead to the crew quarters. I suspect
 there is still someone trapped in there. Of course, no more living."

>go north


 The plaster door opens as you get near it and closes after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Commanders' Quarters</span>
 Another hexagonal room, this time with just one exit, leading south
 through a plaster door. The room is exceptionally blank, as a sort of
 minimalistic museum.

 In the center of the room, a six-sided glass table takes most of the
 space. The surface is crystal-clean, a mocking at the passing of time.

 LOGAN://"This has been a much livelier place, back in <span class="floydstyle i">time</span>. The
 table in the center of the quarters is a holographic projector. It was
 used by the crew to gaze at the stars, both for leisure and for
 study."

>ask logan about table


 LOGAN://"I don't understand, Ektor Mastiff."

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Hard time interacting with LOGAN? Remember you can TALK to him in</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hexagon</span>

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Chess Room</span>
 This six-sided room reminds you of the chess training grounds in which
 you used to spend your spare time during your first years in
 Brouguoise, before they hired you at the University of Monarch: The
 size, roughly the same; the white, featureless walls -- a sort of
 dramatic fashion of the times in which the Campus was built; the
 plain, cold light that fills the place. But most of all, what strikes
 you as a perfect mimic is the object filling the center of the room.

 Two men, seated and facing each other, play a game around a six-sided
 table, in an everlasting match.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thousand Lights Room</span>
 A six-sided room. Each wall is covered in a myriad of tiny bulbs, each
 one the size of a bee's eye. Most of the lights are on, drawing
 patterns and ungraspable designs. On the east wall, a ten-by-twenty
 centimeter spot just below a small viewscreen bears a series of five
 symbols, printed in an obscure, alien language. The room is then
 empty, except for a large cubic device placed against its northern
 wall.

 The hologram on the device shows -- unmistakably -- a Hyerotrope.

 On the large cubic device is a golden disc.

>take disc


 Taken.

 glow or flicker to different rhythms. To the south is the dark tunnel
 leading to the railway station; to the northwest and north the
 functioning exits.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forebridge</span>
 An hexagonal chamber, this time rather larger than the previous ones.
 A set of lounge chairs dots the place, each of the seats resting empty
 in front of a terminal. To the north, a four-by-two-meter screen
 almost entirely covers the wall. This is probably the main bridge of
 the ship.

 LOGAN://"To engage the <span class="floydstyle i">self-destruction</span> sequence you have to
 activate the emergency measures at console 21b. Let me show it to
 you."

 A second later, a terminal comes out from one of the desks.

>SAVE
>cf4
 %% Enter a save filename to write:
 Ok.

>examine terminal


 (the emergency measures terminal)
 The console is made of a lot of senseless keys and symbols. One larger
 button is glowing green.

 LOGAN://"If you find any difficulties engaging the right
 <span class="floydstyle i">sequence</span>, ask me and I will help produce it for you."

>inventory


 You're carrying a golden disc, a translucid bar and an useless railway
 ticket. You are wearing a white jumpsuit and some clothes.

>show disc to logan


 LOGAN://"Part of your race's history is coded in that disc. I found
 the music and the natural sounds... quite inspiring. Yours must have
 been a very interesting planet to inhabit."

>ask logan about sequence


 LOGAN://"Oh, yes, of course. You don't understand Neulanean. Let me
 trigger the sequence for you. When I'm done, simply press the large,
 green button to engage it."

 All of a sudden, the big screen on the wall turns to life, and a
 series of mysterious symbols start filling it. After a while, the
 symbols are replaced by the blueprint of the Arcadia.

>examine blueprint


 The Arcadia is showing itself on the big screen. A set of tiny dots
 stipples the blueprint following an invisible line that cuts the ship
 in two.

 Just by chance you discover a strange little drawing in the bottom
 part of the blueprint. It looks like a hundred-legged spider. When you
 understand what it is -- and the proportions with the rest of the ship
 -- you gasp.

 "That's the train station," you whisper, prompting a comment from
 LOGAN.

 LOGAN://"Quite <span class="floydstyle i">big</span>, right, Ektor Mastiff?"

>ask logan about big


 LOGAN://"The starship Arcadia is six-hundred-twenty-five kilometers
 long and two-hundred-ninety across. That's the largest size a
 Neulanean ship has ever been. Unfortunately that record will never be
 broken."

 LOGAN://"This is interesting. The sequence won't start. The

 this I couldn't foresee: the bars are kept in a place where my sensors

 intense heat.

 LOGAN://"You are lucky you wear one of the suits, Ektor Mastiff. The
 radiation is so intense it is disrupting some of my sensors."

>talk to logan


 LOGAN://"This was the relax area of the ship. Due to the limited
 amount of space, the Observatory was accessed after a quite long
 queue. All had the rights to be here, but sometimes you had to wait a
 month before finding a single vacant seat. The <span class="floydstyle i">Commanders</span> were

 otherwise."

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clogged Railway</span>
 The narrow corridor comes to a halt where it has been devoured by a
 large gaping hole, opening to the north under your feet. The hole
 continues up and to the southeast, from where it must have originated.
 A pair of now useless rails departs from here and fall into the
 darkness before you.

 LOGAN://"The chamber you seek is right below this point. You can try
 and go down from here. Just be extremely careful."

>be extremely careful


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look down


 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>examine hole


 The hole has been dug by something, quite big, punching through the
 metal boundaries of the structure you are in. Below, it plunges into
 darkness. Above, a hundred meters away, it opens into the emptiness of
 space.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Radioactive Bars Containment Chamber</span>
 The tunnel dug through torn metal and broken laminas opens after a
 while into a sort of alcove.

 Hidden under layers of lead and plastics, this cubic room seems to be
 a vault for protecting some highly valuable equipment. The only exit
 is via a rip above your head: There's no sign of another door and you
 puzzle at how one could have entered the place before the ravagings of
 time opened a way.

 Near the rip that cuts through the room, a double y-shaped holder has
 been pierced through by some unknown object. Although the holder
 itself has survived the crash: the same cannot be said of the bar that
 once rested on it, now reduced to mere powder.

 LOGAN://"It seems that the object that has pierced the hull in this
 section of the ship has done its share of damage to the radioactive
 bars of the self-destruction engine. It seems you have to find an
 adequate substitute to power the sequence."

>insert bar in holder


 (the charged bar in the bars holder)
 You start putting the charged bar on the holder... but then hesitate.
 There is something, in Andy's words, that's still ringing in your
 ears.

 <span class="floydstyle em">If I trigger the sequence, </span>you murmur, <span class="floydstyle em">the AI will be</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">destroyed along with the ship.</span>

 LOGAN://"What are you waiting for, Ektor Mastiff? There is not much
 time left. The supernova is now less than half an hour from the
 Arcadia."

 "Tell me, LOGAN: How did your crew store their... memories? The story
 of your galaxy?"

 LOGAN://"The bulk of Neulanean knowledge complexity is recorded in a
 compartment in bridge 3, level 4, starboard section, if that is what
 you mean. Unfortunately, the place is unreachable from here. Why are
 you asking, if I can inquire?"

 "Fact is, my friend, that if I decide to blow up this ship, those
 memories... and yours also, will be lost forever. I don't know if I
 want the hand that pushes the button to be mine."

 LOGAN://"Oh, this is a nice consideration, on your behalf, but I don't
 see how your choice could change the outcome. The supernova is almost
 here and there is no one left in the galaxy to save us."

 "That's fine, but... I don't know. Pulling the trigger: Wouldn't it
 mean they have won? The Hyerotropes, I mean. The fact that they are
 going seek-and-destroy on us and in the end we decide to sacrifice
 ourselves -- our heritage -- to them... Isn't it like surrendering?"

 There is a minute of silence, then the friendly machine speaks again:

 LOGAN://"I think you are rather miscalculating the situation, here,
 Ektor Mastiff. What makes you believe the objects you call the
 Hyerotropes are after you or any other being in the galaxy? Evidence
 suggests that the scope of the events triggered by them is not even
 comparable to the life-span of your -- or Neulanean's -- entire
 history. They seem to be invoking forces to mould masses of galaxies.
 Although I'm not programmed to make hypotheses, I can suppose they
 don't even calculate <span class="floydstyle em">life</span> as something worthy of their
 attention."

 You pause. The bar in your hands starts growing dim.

 "But they <span class="floydstyle em">did</span> disintegrate at least three inhabited
 galaxies." You think about Uncle Oren's last words. "If not life, what
 is it they are after?"

 LOGAN://"That I cannot answer. What I understand, though, is that you
 are giving us more account than we deserve. The universe is fifteen
 billion years old. We are just a whisper in a crowded gathering. The
 universe will survive. It will outlive us and maybe the Hyerotropes,
 too."

 "But," you insist, "why did they spare me? Why did they <span class="floydstyle em">save</span>
 me, if I'm not that important?"

 LOGAN://"Because it is polite, isn't it, Ektor Mastiff?"

 You stare at the vacuum and take your decision. As you drop the
 charged bar in place, a vigorous alarm starts ringing. It is so strong
 you have to clog your ears. After about ten seconds, the alarm goes
 silent and everything becomes dark and cold.

 LOGAN://"To trigger the self-destruct sequence, I had to remove power
 from every other remaining facility. I kept the railways functioning
 for you to get back to the Hyerotrope. The ELSS is down, so don't
 remove your suit at any cost. You have 40 minutes left before the
 Arcadia will blast. Good luck, Ektor Mastiff."

 As you pass through the big valve, it closes after you. Something
 tells you there's no turning back, at this point.


>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Corridor</span>
 The steel wormhole continues north into a wide chamber, and runs south
 into its next section. Lights flicker dimly. To the east, a bulky
 shutter stands closed. To the southwest is a dimly lit room, with
 strange machinery on the inside.

 LOGAN://"Warning! Self-destruct sequence activated. You have
 thirty-six minutes to leave the ship!"

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Train Station</span>
 Light in here gets dimmer, as the only source is several meters up
 ahead, on the distant ceiling. In front of you, a ramp runs into
 several tunnels, each lined by railways. Many of the holes are
 shuttered by heavy bulkheads, while others lead into darkness, way out
 of reach. On the opposite side, the circular room enters the high
 corridor to the south.

 A deformed monstrosity is snarling in front of you. You can see its
 eye, its venomous, thousand-toothed mouth. You can see its hunger. As
 you move a step, it becomes aware of you and picks up your scent.

 You had better hurry.

 A lone wagon, an open boat hanging over rails, sits undamaged at the
 beginning of the ramp.

 On the lone wagon is a rusty console.

 LOGAN://"Oh dear. It seems that dropping the main power has released
 our other only guest. Find sanctuary, Ektor Mastiff. That thing looks

 You pull the handle then release it. The small door closes back
 pneumatically in a few seconds.

 Something strange happens.

 A faint... wind caresses your right arm as the case closes. It feels
 like someone is breathing in your ears with levity. A sort of...
 buzzing can be heard around you.

 It could easily have been your imagination.


 The creature roars with anger. You can feel its hunger growing.

 The creature snarls at you, its thousand-toothed mouth the sole
 plausible exit from this decaying world. Then, something happens. Its
 mouth begins filling with blood and before you can understand what is
 happening, the hulk is devoured by a billion tiny insects.

 A hiss follows the invisible killer as it abandons the room, leaving
 you unscarred.

 people in town known as "Belmont and Keller", after the avenues it

 The bars of the gate are lifted and now stick into the ceiling like a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the Mouth of the Whale</span>
 At least six hundred meters wide, two hundred high and three
 kilometers long, the hangar could probably harbor all of your
 skyscraper block in Monarch with spare room for a garden and a
 supermarket. The place has been trashed by some unknown force, a lot
 of its old content scattered around and devastated.

 The docks are to the northwest, west and southwest, while south and

 crates and boxes of every kind and size.

 The place is a mess, but not as much as the south side. Crates and

 "Goodbye, LOGAN," you frown. "And thank you for helping me out."

 LOGAN://"It has been a pleasure, more than a duty. Talking to someone

 don't forget to write!"

 You take one last, deep breath, then jump into the welcoming
 Hyerotrope. You wonder where it will take you and puzzle at how your
 story will go on.

 What you are sure of, though, is that it will be a hell of a ride.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lone Ship</span>

 The Monarch system is shrinking. It is now just a tiny dot, glaring
 and glittering in the emptiness of space.

 They told you there were more, out there: other planets, other
 civilizations, other galaxies. They couldn't tell, though, how much
 deep space divides one from the other. How much time.

 You are distracted by a dark spot, in the emptiness of your voyage,
 lingering beyond the boundaries of Andromeda. <span class="floydstyle em">What is it?</span> you
 puzzle. Then, a blinding explosion suffocates your sight. A hundred
 sequential blasts paint the dark shape red, then yellow, then white.
 And all of a sudden, the sky is black again.

 There is just that... small round object, running from the explosion
 like a speeding bullet.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Could it be that...?</span>

 "We are reaching our destination," the old man says. "Brace yourself,
 'cause this is goin' to be strong."

 The dark, silent presence turns and you can finally see its eyes
 looking at you.



 Staring. Like the four red eyes of a devil.

 The original game, to which <span class="floydstyle em">Apocalypse</span> tries to be a
 reasonable sequel, was filled with a cartload of bulls**t. The main
 example is the description of the laser disc contained in the
 "Beacon", which I erroneously described as a "couple of human beings".
 As many understand, the actual copper-and-gold-plated object inside
 the real "Beacon" is not a laser disc and depicts no human being.
 Actually, the censorious governments of the era forbade the depiction
 of nudity on the disc, and so some far less explicit scientific
 drawings were used. What I'm saying here is NOT that I'm trying to
 make amends in this game for the last one's sins. Just: close an
 eye... and, sometimes, close them both.

 The sad truth is thatâ¦ we don't know.

 The history of the Hyerotropes, as narrated in <span class="floydstyle em">Andromeda</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Awakening</span>, is shrouded in a veil of mist. All we know is that
 they have been found, hidden in the deep underground of the planet
 Monarch, about 3,000 years prior to the events depicted in
 <span class="floydstyle em">Awakening</span>. The first colonists, known as the Ancestors, have
 come to the galaxy of Andromeda in a trip through time and space
 following an ancient probe (the 'Beacon') that has been abducted by
 the Hyerotropes from the outer layers of the Solar System. Following
 the breadcrumbs left by the Beacon, the Ancestors found a planet worth
 colonizing: the New Heaven. Hidden by millennia-old layers of rock,
 the Hyerotropes lay dormant there until the devastating effects of
 world-shattering tides somehow switched them on.

 The Hyerotropes are perfect black spheres of nature unknown. They have
 proven to be somewhat intelligent and 'living', with some unique
 mechanics involved in their functioning. First, the Hyerotropes
 'breathe': their surface grows and shrinks while their radiation level
 increases. Second, they seem to be able to disrupt the laws of physics
 by challenging the mass, the energy and the shape of matter. Using
 this power, they have formed a wormhole to catch the 'Beacon'
 (actually, the Voyager II probe) and pull it to Andromeda thousands of
 times faster than the speed of light. Finally, the Hyerotropes seem to
 corrupt their surroundings by laying a set of luminous, living
 tentacles which convert even stone to a sort of cold, azure light.

 The main character, Ektor Mastiff, has escaped the exploding planet of
 Monarch aboard a Hyerotrope, and is now trying to find a way to save
 himself, along with his knowledge.

 Up to now, the motives behind the Hyerotropes' behavior are unknown.

 The main character of the Andromeda series is a scientist and a
 researcher, as well as a teacher in the University of Monarch. He
 found himself involved in a trial of gargantuan scope when his best
 friend and colleague, Dr. Andy Re's, was found dead in an alley, shot
 in the back by some unknown assailant (you can discover more about it
 playing the excellent game <span class="floydstyle em">Andromeda Dreaming</span> by Joey Jones).
 The story behind it is that both Ektor and Andy were responsible for a
 groundbreaking discovery: under the soil of planet Monarch, a new form
 of energy, named Alpha radiation, started growing to detectable levels
 just two weeks before the coming of the tides that would have
 destroyed Monarch itself. Someone (details withheld to avoid spoiler)
 killed Andy to prevent the news being made public. With the discovery
 in hand, Ektor departed towards the University to show the Scientific
 Committee. During his trip, however, a fierce quake devoured his
 train, and he survived the crash by mere luck.

 As far as we know, no one else has survived the tides and Ektor is the
 only living being in the galaxy, floating in space with the sole
 support of his knowledgeâ¦ and of a unused, expired railway ticket.
