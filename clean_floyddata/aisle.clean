 Late Thursday night. You've had a <span class="floydstyle em">hard</span> day and the last thing
 you need is this: shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and
 you're progressing rapidly.

 On to the next aisle.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Interesting... fresh Gnocchi--you haven't had any of that since...</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i"></span><span class="floydstyle em">Rome</span>.

 The aisle stretches to the north, and back to the south. The shelves
 on either side of you block your view of the rest of the supermarket,
 with only the brightly coloured aisle markers visible.

 You have stopped your trolley next to the pasta section, bright
 plastic bags full of pale skin-tone shapes.

 There is a brunette woman a few metres ahead, filling her trolley with
 sauces.

>examine me

 You don't need a mirror to know what you look like. Old. "Old beyond
 your years", as they say. Old. Old and lonely. You look lonely--you
 are lonely. You are well dressed but people think you are a tramp. You
 feel like a tramp. Ever since Clare left you... without word... in
 Rome.

 You leave your trolley and walk to the exit. Then drive home.

>examine trolley

 (your trolley)
 The trolley is a small cage of steel with bent rubber wheels. Full of
 your shopping: meals for one, drinks for one (well, drinks for
 several, but <span class="floydstyle em">hey</span>, who's counting?).

 Gnocchi for <span class="floydstyle em">one</span> wouldn't really work. You settle for
 spaghetti and continue on to the next aisle.

>eat gnocchi

 You rip open the packet and take out a few Gnocchi, cramming them into
 your mouth. The uncooked, floury balls clog in your throat and you
 swallow them down, hard.

 The brunette glances at you and moves on quickly.

 You feel stupid, slip the opened bag back into the shelf and carry on.
 It's never been as good as it was in Rome.

>remember rome

 Rome.

 You pick up the Gnocchi and stare at the illustration of Piazza
 Venezia on its packet. You remember; sun, heat, food, pasta, sauces,
 wine, love, ancient, modern, Italians, Americans, love. And ultimately
 pain. A pain you had thought you had forgotten. But like a cancer
 returning to wreak havoc again, the pain resurfaces and tears through
 the thin barriers you had erected. Tears flow. Memories; guilt. And
 finally acceptance. You live with it.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>buy gnocchi then cook it

 You pick up the packet of Gnocchi and toss it into your trolley.
 You'll have that tonight with some olive oil and a few leaves of fresh
 basil. Just like in Rome... though without Clare.

 But it's useless remembering, best just enjoy the Gnocchi.

 You walk over. "Hi. You trying to choose a sauce?" She looks at you
 and pauses, "Um. Yeah I'm just looking." You reach down a random jar
 and pass it to her, "This is a great sauce." She smiles politely,
 "Thanks," and quickly moves on to the next aisle.

 You feel a bit stupid. Why is it that none of them understand you like
 she did?

 You run over to her and throw a punch which knocks her into the
 shelves. Jars fall and splatter grainy red sauces across the aisle.
 Shit. You run out--out to the car and drive--drive home. When you park
 up, you find that you are holding the gnocchi from the supermarket.

 What was it about the gnocchi? You can't remember (I don't think you
 want to remember). You feel ashamed, stupid and old.

>remember gnocchi

 You focus on the gnocchi and whilst the little, floury balls remain
 the same everything else changes. There is a flush of noise in your
 ears, the cold air pushed away by the warmth from table-top candles. A
 friendly waiter approaches, "Gnocchi for two?" His English is correct
 but with a European slant. You nod. "Prego," you volunteer as he lays
 the plate before you. Clare Prego's too as he presents her plate. He
 asks if you would like a bottle of wine. "Uno vino rose," you reply in
 half-Italian. He scurries away, whilst a smaller waiter hurries to you
 and puts a basket of bread and bread sticks on the table. "Prego," he
 nods as he backs away into the busy restaurant. You take a fork and
 spear a bud of gnocchi, dunking it in the sauce. As you draw it up to
 your mouth your eyes level with Clare's.

 You shake your head and are back in the supermarket.

 Hmmm. Maybe there was something more important than gnocchi? But it's
 gone now. You take a couple of packets and pile them into the trolley.
 Then with a push of the wrists you move the trolley onwards.

 You cannot save.

>inventory

 Taking everything from your pockets you crouch down and line up your
 possessions on the floor:

 Wallet: coins, bank card, store card, bookclub card, <span class="floydstyle em">photo</span>--

 Each object, representing something else, is like a word. The
 inventory-sentence ends and begins with that photo. An attempt to
 possess Clare in her image, to hold her and to contain her. You
 rearrange the coins in a circle around the photo, a makeshift frame.
 <span class="floydstyle em">A photo of Clare</span>. If only you could lose those first few
 words: Clare. Then you could hold Clare, possess Clare. She would be
 yours...

 With a furtive glance you scoop up your things and return them to your
 pockets.

 The photo burns a hole in your pocket, through your heart and to the
 centre of your universe.

 Sorry. You can't use your possessions directly.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Forget it</span>. Easy to say. Not as easy to do. Like cleaning shit
 from your shoes it's a nasty business but, eventually, it's gone. Like
 a weight off your shoulders, a clean slate, etc. You feel much better.
 Can't even remember what it was that was bothering you. Shopping--now
 that you do remember.

 The squeak of the rubber wheels as you push off and continue shopping,
 that's all you remember.

 Then, squinting slightly to check your aim, you push your shoulders
 into it and watch it wheeeeeeeel into the brunette's trolley.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clash of the metal beasts!</span>

 For a second it occurs to you that her trolley, with its greater load,
 might win--but as the trolleys smack together with a steely
 <span class="floydstyle i">tink</span> you know you've won. A smile emerges as her trolley tips,
 rocks and then falls to its side. Your trolley stands above it,
 shaking from the contact, but still upright.

 She turns, shocked by your disruption of her domestic tranquillity.
 You grin, turn and walk to the exit. No-one makes to follow you. This
 surprises you, but perhaps they're learning--no matter how many times
 they lock you up they can't keep a <span class="floydstyle em">good boy</span> down.

 air, bouncing awkwardly off the brunette. Caught unawares, she drops
 the jar she is holding which shatters on the floor, leaving a puddle
 of grainy red. She stares, red-faced, in disbelief. You hear the soft
 crunch of leather boots behind you and turn to face a middle-aged
 security guard. You feint to the left then run to the right, out of
 the exit and to your car. As you pull away with a badly clutched roar,
 you shout out of the window "She had it coming--bitch!"

 Something about the way she stands pisses you off; she is so insolent.
 The gnocchi whispers in your ear, "Remember what happened last time?
 Prevention is always better than cure." You walk up and take a jar
 from the shelf. The brunette ignores you. You throw the jar.

 It glances off her with a glass-bone-skin sort of crack, and she falls
 to the floor limply. You look over her; sauce runs down her face. No;
 not just sauce--a thin stream of blood is entwined in the onion and
 tomato. You start to run towards the exit, but just before you get
 there you feel the air knocked out of you as a heavy thump knocks you
 from the side and you are tackled to the ground.

 This time the judge rules in society's best interest rather than in
 yours.

 it's with an 'i' or not, we'll just assume). In a whipcrack chain of
 rather bizarre events, you end up in the supermarket cafe surrounded
 by a pile of shopping bags. You sit across the tiny table from each
 other, sipping on your coffee and chatting. Even more bizarre is the
 fact that you get on. Fabulously.

 She leaves her bags in her car, storing the frozen stuff in your

 You have stopped your trolley next to the pasta section, bright

 There is a brunette woman a few metres ahead, filling her trolley with
 sauces.

>confess

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tell woman the real story

 I'm not sure what you are talking about.

>tell woman about murder

 You scurry up to the brunette. "Excuse me--I probably ought to tell
 you this, now rather than later", she looks confused and you continue,
 "but I am a murderer. All very complicated complicated stuff--but
 basically I killed my girlfriend (my lover) and well I am over it now
 so there is no problem there but like I said just thought I would
 say.."

 With that off your chest you continue on your shop.

>tell woman about gnocchi

 You pick up the gnocchi and walk over to the brunette. "Look...
 gnocchi!" She looks bemused, a little embarrassed. "We had gnocchi on
 our last night together." She smiles, blushing, and moves her trolley
 to the next aisle.

 Perhaps you were too forward. Perhaps you missed your chance all those
 years ago. It is all so <span class="floydstyle em">difficult</span>.

>kiss woman

 You walk briskly up to the brunette. As you lean over her she turns
 and gives a puzzled look. You force your mouth onto hers and reach out
 hotly for her. She pushes you off--you slip to the floor and she runs
 to the checkouts. A bulky security man pulls you to your feet and
 escorts you from the store.

 Falling to the pavement outside, you stop yourself with outstretched
 hand, landing near a dirty puddle left by the recent rain. Your old
 old face stares up at you--how long was it since you kissed those
 lips? How long since you kissed? Too long? Too late.

>kiss security

 You saw them when you came in, but you can't see any around right now.

>climb shelves

 You stare at the Gnocchi. You remember the Trevi Fountain in Rome. How
 you and Clare sat and bathed your feet in it on the first day. And how
 you would continually lose yourselves trying to find some other
 monument, only to turn a corner and be back at the fountain
 <span class="floydstyle em">again</span>.

 You remember the day after Clare had gone, you returned to the
 fountain. Drunk, you climbed the fountain and screamed. The police
 pulled you down and sobered you up.

 Grabbing onto the shelves you hitch yourself up, setting off a
 mini-avalanche of pasta. Upon reaching the top of the shelves you can
 see the whole store. People stare at you. They think it's <span class="floydstyle em">you</span>
 that is mad. Fuckers.

>remember murder

 The one thing you didn't <span class="floydstyle em">want</span> to remember. A bloody smile
 drawn across the aisle, Gnocchi for teeth--punch them all out--A red,
 red smile--brighter than any lipstick--but wait--she speaks. No; she
 does not. The smile drips, runs into the carpet and blushes into a
 crimson flower. Purple bruises. Colourful scene don't you think? Of
 course it's all in the past now. And they said you were over it.

 A bright red smile opens and devours you whole. Everything goes black.

>sing

 Sing a sad song... You start off singing softly to yourself; what must
 appear to be but a mumble to the other shoppers. But then you slowly
 get louder and louder until everyone in the shop is glancing nervously
 at you. It seems the more you sing the more uncomfortable everyone
 gets. You stop, chuckle. Then continue with your shopping; the aisles
 seem more empty somehow.

>laugh

 You allow yourself a laugh--memories of holiday float up and tickle
 your cheeks. The two guitarists singing in pigeon-English by your
 table as you finished off your gnocchi. Clare thought they were quite
 good. But, for you, they were too close to embarrassing. And the
 bric-a-brac sellers with their lighters (naked statues--you push the
 nipple to light up) and brass colloseums. Not like in the films,
 really--but then real romance often isn't, right? I mean, there was
 the evening when you ate on the street where they filmed the Dolce
 Vita. You spent the meal being distracted by a beggar who was doing a
 mime-swim across the pavement. Real romance makes you laugh.

 Remember when you would sit in the front of the trolley and your mum

 cause havoc. But she still loved you. You didn't even do anything
 wrong with Clare.

 You climb into the trolley and sit down, your shopping crunching
 beneath you. You push off against the shelves and roll a little way.
 But then the trolley shakes and turns onto its side. The shopping
 falls over you and <span class="floydstyle em">fuck</span> your leg really hurts. You stumble to
 your feet and curse, limping out of the store into the night.

 Maybe if you had ordered macaroni rather than gnocchi on that last
 night she wouldn't have left you. But you couldn't have helped that,
 really. I mean, you don't even like macaroni. So it's not your fault.
 If you don't like macaroni she couldn't have expected you to order it.
 So who's fault is it? Not hers--you both agreed it was no one's fault;
 people fall out of love. No, not anyone's fault. Something's fault.
 Pasta. How stupid does that sound? <span class="floydstyle em">The macaroni's fault</span>.
 Stupid but true.

 You rake a shelf of the bags onto the floor; long packets of
 spaghetti, small papery bags of macaroni, big sacks of penne. As they
 hit the floor you <span class="floydstyle i">stamp</span>. The bags split like bruised fruit and
 spill their contents across the floor. The shells hop and skid as you
 crack and squash them under your feet. The brunette turns, a worried
 glance back, and then scurries on. You kick a few stray bows after
 her, scattering nearby twirls.

 Inevitably the guards appear. You let them take you, explaining that
 you aren't mad--you can imagine a lot of men in your position would
 be, but you are quite sane. You've never done this kind of thing
 before. You really are sorry. You'll pay for the cost, and the mess.
 If it helps you'll apologise to the brunette. Wait... they're not
 listening.

 You end up speaking to a balding man who is really very
 intellectual--you know the sort--and he agrees, you are very sane. He
 agrees, love is a dangerous thing. It burns just as many as it warms.
 He agrees. Tired of his stating the obvious, you stop listening.

 Staring at the gnocchi you feel a memory slowly, awkwardly, awfully
 rise to the surface.

 --The scooter driver looks surprised. You grab for Clare and jump to
 the side--bounce across the road, scrape your head--

 Scuffed and light headed you open your eyes... your hands are
 empty--Clare is a few metres away, lying awkwardly. Splattered with a
 thin red liquid, reflecting the scooter's bright red paintwork.

 The scooter skids--you jump. You are in the supermarket. Your hands
 are empty, sweaty.

 You glance over at the brunette's trolley. It is almost full--a
 cursory survey shows it to be mostly full of fresh produce and healthy
 food. The quantities suggest to you that, like yourself, she is
 cooking for one. Her choices though, seem to show a genuine love of
 food. Eating for her is not a burden. You almost feel humbled as you
 continue filling your trolley with the kind of easy, dull food that
 you have become accustomed to.

 out a packet of gnocchi from behind your back, "Look what I found."
 She smiles, "Gnocchi? Like in Rome. How sweet!" Then she starts to
 walk off, "Come on, we've got to be out at eight and we've still all
 the shopping to get done, and tea to cook!"

 You turn the trolley and catch up with her.

>ask clare about tea

 I'm not sure what you are talking about.

>leave clare

 You can't see Clare.

>hit shelves

 Shelves. Like little prisons. Tempting <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> with their goods.
 Bastard shelves. You grab hold of a shelf and pull it off the
 backboard, shedding its contents across the floor. You tug at the
 backboard itself and the whole unit falls down, crashing and spilling.

 Two security guards come running up the aisle and grab you, pushing
 your arm into your back.

 The police come and it's the usual cycle of recrimination, them
 telling <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> what is wrong with you. How do they know? They
 don't know what it was like.

 You miss another ten years.

 You look down the aisle and imagine it empty, smaller and with doors
 at either end.

 Remember the institution?

 They taught you to think differently. They told you that you had
 forgotten--but the red smile still haunts you. What they really made
 you forget was the guilt... that was what hurt the most. She made you
 feel guilty in her life and her death. But you forgot that.

 You'll never forget the smile; the smiles you gave her. Bloody lips
 all over her body.

 But that doesn't bother you, much... On with the shopping!

 You can't use 'all' in this game. Refer to individual items.

 You've prayed before--to no avail. But again you drop to one knee and
 close your eyes.

 "Please God. Please God. Please God. Please.."

 You stop--you know there is no point. You have sinned. You have been
 sinned against. It is too late. Best just go home and await judgement.
 Which you do.

>remove clothes

 Now what she doesn't realise (and a lot of people don't realise this)
 is that you look bloody good for your age. Anyone can look good in a
 shirt and trousers. But you actually look <span class="floydstyle em">good</span>. Especially
 for your age. You pull your jumper over your head and throw it to the
 floor. A few tugs and your shirt crumples around your feet. You kick
 off your shoes and bend down to remove your socks. You look up to see
 the brunette, shocked and intrigued. With a deft flick your belt
 snakes out of the hooks on your trousers. Your trousers fall and you
 stand, pink and hairy in the middle of the aisle. The brunette puts a
 hand to her mouth.

 You take a hand to your balls, cupping them and displaying your penis.
 "Pretty good, eh? For my age?" You perform a little twirl, "You
 wouldn't give up on this would you?" The squeak of shoes behind you
 makes you turn to see several security guards coming at you from the
 direction of the checkouts. You stand your ground. As the men circle
 you they grab you reluctantly, careful where to put their hands. One
 of them scoops your clothes up and forces you into your trousers.
 "Stupid old perv," offers the fattest of the guards, avoiding your
 eyes. They drag you to the front of the shop (the police are on the
 way, you are informed). As they take you past the queues at the
 checkout you turn to confront your audience, "You want some? You all
 do!" Catching a glimpse of your reflection in the automatic doors you
 smile--you'll never lose your smile.

>remove woman's clothes

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine markers

 Each aisle has its marker, hanging above it on a long rail. You look
 at the sections; dairy, bread, meat, fish, sweets, alcohol,
 toiletries, frozen. Hard to decide which aisle you belong in. Before
 you met Clare you were meat. Raw, unfocused, a bit simple. With her
 you were promoted to a more civilised taste; sweets, alcohol. You were
 intoxicated, she was sweet. Meat was always wrapped in a puff pastry,
 or swamped in a pasta sauce. Never crude, raw, bloody... Now--well,
 now you're back to meat again. Except this time, you're frozen. If
 someone hit you hard enough you'd smash into hundreds of icy pieces.

 The pasta is a seething mass of off-white food. You tear at the
 plastic bags until the curls and tubes and twists and shells cascade
 onto the floor and into your hands. Scooping up a collection of
 different shapes you cram the pasta into your mouth. It is dry, it is
 hard. That's what your body is saying. But you learnt something a
 while back--that your body (your eyes, your hands, your
 <span class="floydstyle em">heart</span>) isn't always right. No, you've learnt to listen to
 your mind. And your minds says: soft, warm, slightly salty pasta.
 Tangy sauce. What a feast!

 They spoil your fun, they take you away--or so your body says. Your
 mind knows better; you're still in Rome eating pasta, drinking
 wine--everything is fine.

 You pull the trolley back a few inches then run it forward, releasing
 your hands and watching it whirr towards the woman. She stands
 oblivious to the trolley.

 At the last moment it curls to the left and impacts with the shelves,
 sliding into the women's calf. She lets out a yelp and jumps back,
 falling to the floor. Jars of sauce cascade down from the shelves,
 littering the aisle with glassy, red splotches.

 The woman gets to her feet, her hand going to her leg which is
 bleeding. Kind of reminds you of something, but you don't feel guilty!
 Uh-uh. You run out to the exit, dodging past the overweight security
 guard, and jump into your car. Hitting the gas you squeal out into the
 night, a faint remembrance sliding in through the window "Shame she

 In the grey dusk twilight between sleep and consciousness images float

 crash of flesh on scooter. Your head jumps with a start. The veil is
 lifted. You're hunched over your trolley in the supermarket aisle,

 You really need to get some sleep but it's so hard to sleep with the

 Late Thursday night. You've had a <span class="floydstyle em">hard</span> day and the last thing
 you need is this: shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and
 you're progressing rapidly.

 On to the next aisle.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Interesting... fresh Gnocchi--you haven't had any of that since...</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i"></span><span class="floydstyle em">Rome</span>.

 The aisle stretches to the north, and back to the south. The shelves
 on either side of you block your view of the rest of the supermarket,
 with only the brightly coloured aisle markers visible.

 You have stopped your trolley next to the pasta section, bright
 plastic bags full of pale skin-tone shapes.

 There is a brunette woman a few metres ahead, filling her trolley with
 sauces.

>push pasta

 You are unable to.

>get in her trolley

 You run up alongside the brunette and leap onto the trolley. She jumps
 into the shelves, shocked. The trolley skids, spinning round and out
 of the aisle. As it turns, the wheels lock and it turns onto its side,
 pulling you over with it. You hit the floor with a jolt, pain shooting
 up your elbow.

 You climb to your feet, the brunette running over to you. Her shock
 has turned to anger and she looks at you, red faced, and with piercing
 eyes--"What the hell were you doing?" She raises a hand and you block
 as she slaps at you. With your hands above your head, you are chased
 out of the supermarket by the angry stranger.

 Once you are outside she withdraws back into the warmth, a few choice
 phrases fired out as she goes. You cower for a while then trudge over
 to your car. As you are pulling out onto the main road a couple of
 security guards come running up to you. You leave them standing on the
 pavement as you pull out quickly and speed off into the night.

 Say <span class="floydstyle em">something</span>, dammit.


 You jog up to the trolley and grab onto it with a hand. Putting a foot
 on the back wheels you pull it over--the contents bounce across the
 aisle, the metal crash of the trolley resounding round the aisle--

 The brunette spins round, "Shit!" You give her a menacing glare--"You
 don't need all that food! Where you're going--" A crushing blow from
 behind knocks the words out of your mouth. You fall to the floor,
 landing sharply on the contents of the brunette's trolley. A man
 stands over you. He has an arm round the woman, "You alright, Kate?"
 She nods.

 The man offers you a hand and pulls you up. When you are on your feet
 he releases your hand and steps back. Before you get a chance to
 dodge, his fist smacks into your face--

 Under the advice of a lawyer you decide not to prosecute; apparently
 it might require you to undergo another psychiatric evaluation.
 Probably best--just let it go.

>remember scooter

 The accident. You had joked about the traffic, over the previous days.
 There is something about scooters and Italians that is comical. But
 the thin veneer of blood soon takes that away. You can't remember much
 more than the skid, the collision and the shock. Friends and relatives
 organised everything--getting the body flown over, the police, the
 papers, etc. Gave you room to grieve. But you'll always remember the
 way the scooter flicked her into the air as if she were a feather. And
 the way she fell as if she were lead.

 Shopping doesn't seem so important--well, still as important, just not
 as easy.

>tell woman about accident

 The brunette looks confused when you start talking, but you continue,
 "Please hear me out. I need to tell someone." She shifts uneasily on
 her feet. You go on, "See the gnocchi over there," you point to the
 pasta shelves, "it's triggered some nasty memories. I can't keep them
 to myself. The story goes like this: young lovers, very much in love,
 go to Rome for a summer holiday. On the last night they have a
 candlelit meal besides the Pantheon. Gnocchi was the second course.
 The next day a scooter hits Clare--she was one of the lovers--and
 takes all the life out of her." Her eyes flick to the floor, "I'm so
 sorry." You smile, "No one's fault. That's what it means,
 'accident'--no one's fault. Not so bad really, thanks. Bye." You
 stroll back to your trolley, sorry that you had to include someone
 else--selfish really, but you doubt she was really listening. Probably
 thought you were some kind of crackpot.

 You're tired of playing around with girls, getting tired of casual
 sex. Maybe time to settle down?

 You were going to settle down all that time ago (four years now?) with
 Clare. Even had the ring. So the key this time is to be careful who
 you choose--and anyway, last time you were too young. Now you have
 experience on your side.

 You've always thought that there is no point putting in unnecessary
 effort, and right in front of you is a beautiful woman--mature,
 sophisticated and intelligent. Leaving the gnocchi you walk over and
 drop to a knee. "Will you marry me?"

 She looks down, laughing, "What?". You repeat yourself, "Marry me."

 Now she looks confused, "Get away!" Again you repeat "Marry me."

 She looks less amused now, "Piss off."

 You're not stubborn and you know when you're beat. So you stand up and
 walk back towards your trolley. You spend about twenty minutes
 finishing the shopping and wheel up to the checkout. The woman at the
 checkout beeps all the goods through. She looks up with a smile and
 asks whether you have a store card. In response you drop to a knee
 (your face almost disappearing behind the sill of the counter) "Will
 you marry me?"

>dance with woman

 The Muzak informing your movements you waltz on over to the brunette,
 your hips rocking to the soulful sounds... As you approach you allow
 your legs to pick out a jaunty rhythm from the music and strut. "Fancy
 a dance?" sounds like a reasonable question as it leaves your lips.
 But from the look on her face you'd have thought you asked for
 something a lot more, well, naughty. She furrows her brow, "I'm
 sorry?" You wiggle your hips, "Come on--a dance? Shake your bones--"

 Whoops. That doesn't mean to dance does it? I think you just alluded
 to the naughtiness you didn't intend... perhaps that was your
 intention all along... and she saw through you. Damn. Why do women
 always get that five minutes head start on you? You grab her hand and
 with a goodbye kiss to her knuckles you depart, "Ciao!"

 If she would come over then you could chat and get to know each

 acknowledge your wave; either she hasn't seen you or she doesn't want
 to see you. More waving, this time with both hands. "Hey! Over here!"
 Now she <span class="floydstyle em">must</span> be ignoring you, and she's doing a damn good job
 of it. One last, desperate wave... no, she's gone.

 You've been here before, haven't you?

 A cool breeze whips droplets up off the waves and wets the air. The
 river Tiber. You had assumed that the Tiber would be to Rome what the
 Seine was Paris; the perfect place for a romantic stroll. The reality
 is a grafitti'd, dirty stink. A green, thick streak through the city.
 The evening was going badly as it was, after the argument at the
 restaurant, and this fetid river has only made it worse. Clare is
 walking ahead of you, defiant strides putting distance between you.
 You wave, "Come back....<span class="floydstyle em">wait</span>..."

 One last, desparate wave... no, she's gone.

 You slowly let an image form in your mind; the metro, busy--packed
 with Italians and <span class="floydstyle em">heat</span>. Sweaty, close heat. And her hand in
 yours--hot, sweaty and easy to hold. The train slows,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">"Termini. Termini."</span>

 Termini station; the end of the line. The train slowly pulls into the
 station.

 You slowly begin to push your trolley to the next aisle.

 Rome.

 You pick up the Gnocchi and stare at the illustration of Piazza
 Venezia on its packet. You remember; sun, heat, food, pasta, sauces,
 wine, love, ancient, modern, Italians, Americans, love. And ultimately
 pain. A pain you had thought you had forgotten. But like a cancer
 returning to wreak havoc again, the pain resurfaces and tears through
 the thin barriers you had erected. Tears flow. Memories; guilt. And
 finally acceptance. You live with it.

 wanted to know. Have you ever been to Rome?" She thinks, "No. I've
 never been to Italy. My husband suggested Rome, actually, for our
 holiday this year. What's this for--is it some consumer survey?"

 You chuckle. "Well, I'm a consumer and I'm asking a question. So
 maybe." She smiles, "Is that it?" You nod, "Yeah, that's it. Thanks."

 You walk back towards your trolley, "Oh, one more thing--don't go to
 Rome with your husband. Try Paris instead." Wish I had...

 swirling with the water and lapping at your feet, how it was all so
 Clare--such a romantic idea of suicide, the bath overflowing as her
 life-blood left her. The way her head was lolling against the side of
 the bath, staring at you when you walked in. The porter had never seen
 anything like it before.

 Had she planned this all along--was the holiday a framing device for
 her carefully staged exit? Or did something click whilst on the
 holiday? There were no signs. You've told everyone that. <span class="floydstyle i">There were</span>

 Years of loneliness condense into the innocent, floury white buds of

 running in streams down your face and dripping off your chin.

 When the tears abate, you get to your feet. You've come to realise

 as you recount the shock and the pain and how the thing you remember
 most was the noise as you opened the door and the blood and water
 lapped around your feet. Then you stop speaking and her expression
 turns from shock to pity. She puts and arm around you and says how
 sorry she is. But that's all she can do, and she leaves you.

 The brunette must have said something to someone because after a few
 minutes a small, kind-looking lady comes up and takes you to the
 supermarket cafe. She gives you a cup of tea and a small muffin. It's
 a nice gesture, but only reminds you of the breakfast you had minutes
 before you discovered Clare. The tea is warm, almost body-temperature.
 You sense that the staff are worrying now--the presence of a grown man
 crying in their cafe cannot be good for business. You go before they

 feel guilty in her life and her death. But you forgot that.

 You'll never forget the smile; the smiles you gave her. Bloody lips
 all over her body.

 But that doesn't bother you, much... On with the shopping!

 The aisle stretches to the north, and back to the south. The shelves
 on either side of you block your view of the rest of the supermarket,

 You have stopped your trolley next to the pasta section, bright
 plastic bags full of pale skin-tone shapes.

 There is a brunette woman a few metres ahead, filling her trolley with
 sauces.

>tell woman about institution

 You scurry up to the brunette. "Excuse me--I probably ought to tell
 you this, now rather than later", she looks confused and you continue,
 "but I am a murderer. All very complicated complicated stuff--but
 basically I killed my girlfriend (my lover) and well I am over it now
 so there is no problem there but like I said just thought I would
 say.."

 With that off your chest you continue on your shop.

 You leave your trolley and walk up to the brunette. She turns to you
 and you smile, "Come with me! I'll show you a good time. I promise.
 I'll buy you a meal, we can go on holiday! Just come with me." You put
 out your hand. She makes no move to take it. "Come on! Let's go. Come
 with me..." She's looking alarmed now and she starts to walk away.

 She didn't want to come with you? Well, at least you asked. No harm in
 trying.

 You stand and listen; just the sounds of a supermarket. Trolleys,

 registers.

 You've heard it all before, nothing to worry about. You continue with
 your shopping and drive home.

 You draw alongside the woman and inhale. She is draped in a perfume
 that combines fruit, alcohol and spice. You let the scent fall slowly
 down your throat, and allow yourself to wonder what the rest of the
 brunette smells like.

 But you really aren't the type of person who could find out and so you
 trot back to your trolley and continue with your shop.

 You stand and draw in air through your nose. Cleanliness, suggestions
 of spice drifting in from somewhere. And a hint of perfume hanging in
 the air. Is the perfume with you? Is it a reminder of what was here? A
 taster for what is to come?

 Or is it just here to taunt, with its promises of intimacy and sex?

 You exhale and move on.

 You remember the meal like this: Clare sat opposite. It was warm but
 an evening breeze took the uncomfortable edge of the heat. You ordered
 and the food took a while to come. The wine made your face red. You
 walked back after the meal via the Spanish Steps. You sat amongst the
 crowds until the police moved you on so that they could wash the steps
 ready for the tourists in the morning. You strolled back to the hotel
 down backstreets, past the four fountain junction; a crossroads with
 fountains built into the houses on each corner. You knew from
 experience that the water in them was ice cold, even in the afternoon
 heat. You ran a finger through the water as you walked past and wiped
 it on your trousers before taking Clare's hand in yours. Which seems
 like a good place to end.

 Actually, there is help of a sort: I will upload a list of all actions
 anticipated by the game to ftp.gmd.de. But you should only look at
 them after you've got as much out of Aisle as you can yourself.
 Otherwise the point of the game will be rather lost.

 Thanks to <span class="floydstyle i">Stephen Granade</span> for his initial comments and ideas.
 Then a huge thanks to my testers, all superb men and women. They are:

 <span class="floydstyle i">Lutz van Hasselt</span> and <span class="floydstyle i">Will Jennings</span>. I owe them a great
 debt of thanks for turning Aisle into what I had imagined it could be,
 rather than the pale imitation called the "beta-version". The
 Baudelaire quote is from James McGowan's translation of 'La Chevelure'
 in the Oxford University Press edition of The Flowers of Evil (points
 for spotting the less direct Baudelaire references). And any list of
 thanks wouldn't be complete without a big cheers to <span class="floydstyle i">Graham</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">Nelson</span> for the Inform compiler.

 For bugs, suggestions, praise, criticism, etc. my current e-mail is
 (sam.barlow@talk21.com). If this doesn't work, your best bet is to
 look for my last <span class="floydstyle em">rec.games.int-fiction</span> posting.

>author

 My competition game, "The City", has its Save and Restore verbs
 disabled. Many people disliked this feature. A response to this,
 <span class="floydstyle em">Aisle</span>, started out as a game which would not need the usual
 meta-verbs... i.e. a game with only one turn. The initial idea was:
 How do I make a game with only one turn interesting? Give it lots of
 endings--in fact there are many 'endings' and (hopefully) every
 sensible action results in an 'ending'. There is no winning action.
 There is however more going on than just this and the more endings you
 see the more things should become clear. Please try any action you
 think of, there are far more verbs, etc. than usual for a single scene
 in a piece of IF. If you're not sure what the game is about, read the
 frontispiece again--it should set you straight.

 Enjoy, Sam.


 You scoop a packet of gnocchi off the shelves and run over to the
 brunette. "Hi. Take this!", you chuck the gnocchi into her trolley.
 She squeaks, "What? Sorry, I don't want any, thanks." She takes it out
 and passes it back to you.

 "<span class="floydstyle em">No</span>. <span class="floydstyle i">No</span>. Take it--" You put the gnocchi back in her
 trolley. She looks exasperated, "No, please--I don't want it. Thanks."
 Well, what can you say? You can take a horse to water, but you can't
 make it drink. You take the gnocchi and pad back to your trolley,
 shouting back "It tastes really nice--" You stop; she's gone.

 You take the gnocchi for yourself and finish shopping. When you get
 back home (traffic is awful) you put on the hob and start boiling the
 water. You chuck the gnocchi into the pan and walk into the lounge.
 Flicking on the TV you sit down and start watching the news.

 You wake up, lips moist with dribble, and a numb arm where you slept
 on it. You jump up and run into the kitchen. Aw, shit. The pan has
 boiled dry, and the gnocchi is smoking. You sprint to the window and
 try to lift it open, but too late--the smoke alarm sounds:
 <span class="floydstyle i">Beeeee-eeee-eeeee-eeee-eee-eeee</span>.

 Later on you sit in the lounge again, a plate of burnt gnocchi in your
 lap. You stab a small fluffy (blackened) bud and swallow it.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Yum</span>. It tastes really nice.

 You grab some bags of macaroni and walk over. You chuck them into the
 brunette's trolley. Then a few jars of sauce. She turns, her face a
 map of disbelief, "What are you doing?"

 You don't get it. You're just helping her with her shopping, "I was...
 just trying to help. Helping with your shopping..." She pushes you
 away, "Get off! Leave me alone!" You stand back, "Sorry..."

 You walk back to your trolley, "If you do need my help--just ask."
 God, next time you won't bother. What is it with people?

 Day dreaming. It's like that thing about the butterfly--you know, the

 a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming about being a man dreaming about a
 butterfly? You spend some much time dreaming, more than not in fact.
 So, as I'm sure you realise, the fact that you are dreaming now is not
 strange. And what are you dreaming?

>tell woman about illness

 You slowly pad up to the brunette. She turns, you speak "Sorry to
 bother you, but I really need to speak to someone, right now." She
 looks empathetic and you continue, "A few years ago the love of my
 life, Clare was her name, she died very suddenly and in real pain. The
 thing is, well, she is out of her misery. But I'm not--we had gnocchi
 the night she died--", you point to the bags of gnocchi on the
 shelves, "and it's all coming back to me. I just need to talk---"

 She smiles a sad, caring smile, "Do you want a cup of tea, love?" She
 takes you to the cafe and you sit (you have cake as well as tea) and
 she lets you talk.

 When you finish you wish you had done that sooner. The pain is still
 there, but now you have some power over it.

 You smile, flash your teeth, "How you doing?" The brunette turns,
 smiles politely, "Fine, thanks." She pauses, unsure as to whether she
 should turn back to shelves or maintain eye contact.

 You take the initiative, "Shopping for one?" She smiles, "Yes. You're
 quite forward aren't you?" You reflect her smile, "Yes. But no-one
 ever got anywhere hiding under a bushel, did they?" "So you're not one
 to hide under a bushel then?" "When it's required, sure--", you falter
 (think of something funny, sexy) and she steps in, "Look I've got to
 get my shopping finished now, but I can see you for a drink later?"

 You smile again, "Sure... <span class="floydstyle em">you're</span> being quite forward now--for

 "Sorry--didn't mean to be rude. I just thought you were looking

 right--I've had a stinker of a day", again she smiles, "and now I'm
 being chatted up by a loon in the supermarket. When all I want to do
 is get home and put my feet up." You give a mock look of upset, "I'm
 no loon!.. Put your feet up you say? Well, four feet are better than
 two--"

 She interrupts, "I'm going to have to stop you there, Mr. Supermarket
 smooth. You're a nice guy--well I don't know, but you seem nice--so I
 don't want to disappoint you. I'm not into men so much, you know?" You
 shrug, "...I could watch?" She groans and rolls her eyes to the
 heavens. You turn, taking a coin from your pocket and tossing it. For

 will be up soon. Till then just keep on trying...

 last meal with Clare. She was in bed, pasty white and crumbling. She
 wanted something <span class="floydstyle em">nice</span> for her last meal and so you got some
 special Gnocchi brought up by room service. But she couldn't eat it
 and she dribbled, and couldn't swallow. And she couldn't even cry--nor

 Tucking your toe under the hem of her dress, you flick it up. She
 spins round, clutching at her clothes, "Hey!"

 You back off, arms raised in an apologetic gesture, "Sorry. Sorry.
 Just thought you might like to slip into something a little more...
 comfortable?" She gives a look of incredulity, "What?" You move
 nearer, again, "Look--don't fret just get undressed. <span class="floydstyle em">Come on</span>
 slip out of that dress--what's wrong? You not got any underwear on?
 No, you <span class="floydstyle em">have</span>--I can see it now: Sexy black lingerie,
 clutching you tightly. Your bra only separated from your breasts by a
 layer of perspiration--" She slaps you, spitting "Jesus Christ. Go
 take a cold shower, get some fucking help!" as she strides off to the
 next aisle, leaving you giggling. Ha! She didn't guess. She didn't
 realise that is was <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> wearing the sexy black lingerie.
 <span class="floydstyle i">The best Italian suspenders</span>. Only the best next to your skin.
 Baby soft skin. Clapping your hands together you trot back to the
 trolley. <span class="floydstyle i">Gnocchi for two?</span> You'd like that wouldn't you Clare?
 <span class="floydstyle i">I sure would, Clark</span>. Sexy bitch!

 Late Thursday night. You've had a <span class="floydstyle em">hard</span> day and the last thing
 you need is this: shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and
 you're progressing rapidly.

 On to the next aisle.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Interesting... fresh Gnocchi--you haven't had any of that since...</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i"></span><span class="floydstyle em">Rome</span>.

 The aisle stretches to the north, and back to the south. The shelves
 on either side of you block your view of the rest of the supermarket,
 with only the brightly coloured aisle markers visible.

 You have stopped your trolley next to the pasta section, bright
 plastic bags full of pale skin-tone shapes.

 There is a brunette woman a few metres ahead, filling her trolley with
 sauces.

>frown

 Your brow becomes furrowed, sporting a frown. You don't like it when
 you are forced to think about Rome, and more specifically Clare. She
 seems to be getting along with it--she's been with her new boyfriend
 for ages now (you can't stand him) and she seems fine talking to you.
 But you would much rather just, well, not keep in touch. It just keeps
 the wounds open...

 The frown follows you around for the rest of the shop (you feel sorry
 for the checkout girl--she gets a particularly severe look, no fault
 of her own) and spend the rest of the evening in a really dissatisfied
 mood.

                               ----------

 You can't remember that.


 I'm not sure what you are talking about.


 She looks at you, "Sorry?" You blush, "Oh. Oh. Nothing." You quickly
 turn round and wheel your half-full trolley to the checkout. Then
 home.

 She walks into the aisle, "Yeah?" You take her hand and walk her along
 to the gnocchi, "Look, gnocchi, like in Rome--I've never seen it in
 the shops before." She picks up a packet and drops it in the trolley.
 "Get some for tea then?" she offers, pecking you on the lips.

 You have some for tea and it's like Rome, except: it's colder, you
 have work tomorrow and you're <span class="floydstyle em">even more in love</span> than you were
 then.

>pray

 You've prayed before--to no avail. But again you drop to one knee and
 close your eyes.

 "Please God. Please God. Please God. Please.."

 You stop--you know there is no point. You have sinned. You have been
 sinned against. It is too late. Best just go home and await judgement.
 Which you do.

 "Help! Security!" A balding man in his forties, squeezed into a blue
 uniform appears at the bottom of the aisle. "Can I help you sir?" You
 run to him. Pull him close. Whisper in his ear: "You see that woman?"
 "Yes, sir" "She just raped me." "I don't quite understand sir?" "She
 is stealing all your food!" "Calm down sir, speak slowly" You raise
 your voice, "I will not be quiet! It's your job--stop her!" The guard
 pauses. You make a dash for the woman, "If you won't do your job, then
 I will--" He is too quick for you and hooks a foot around your leg.
 You crash to the floor and black out, the guard's words dragged with
 you into oblivion, "I think you ought to come with me, sir."

 (your trolley)
 You look into the trolley; meals for one, toiletries for
 one--everything for <span class="floydstyle i">one</span>. You tip the trolley on to its side and
 it sheds its contents. A bottle smashes and wine spills onto the
 floor. The brunette hurries on nervously and you kick a can down the
 aisle. Then you leave into the night.

 You jog up to the trolley and grab onto it with a hand. Putting a foot
 on the back wheels you pull it over--the contents bounce across the
 aisle, the metal crash of the trolley resounding round the aisle--

 The brunette spins round, "Shit!" You give her a menacing glare--"You
 don't need all that food! Where you're going--" A crushing blow from
 behind knocks the words out of your mouth. You fall to the floor,
 landing sharply on the contents of the brunette's trolley. A man
 stands over you. He has an arm round the woman, "You alright, Kate?"
 She nods.

 The man offers you a hand and pulls you up. When you are on your feet
 he releases your hand and steps back. Before you get a chance to
 dodge, his fist smacks into your face--

 Under the advice of a lawyer you decide not to prosecute; apparently
 it might require you to undergo another psychiatric evaluation.
 Probably best--just let it go.

 You scoot round the corner of the aisle. Sure enough there she is,
 looking through the magazines. You pull up behind her and slide and
 arm round her waist. She laughs, "Get off! We're in public." You pull
 out a packet of gnocchi from behind your back, "Look what I found."
 She smiles, "Gnocchi? Like in Rome. How sweet!" Then she starts to
 walk off, "Come on, we've got to be out at eight and we've still all
 the shopping to get done, and tea to cook!"

 You turn the trolley and catch up with her.

 You stand by the gnocchi until she starts to move off. Then you walk
 in step with her, cornering the aisle a few metres behind her. She
 stops to put something in her trolley, and you pull up across the
 aisle. This goes on for a few minutes.

 You come to a point where you are straddling the line between
 following an attractive woman and stalking one. You decide to stop,
 and recommence your shopping.

 What made you follow her in the first place--sure she's attractive,
 but... Maybe there was something about her that rang a few bells. A
 dulled romance in the far reaches of your mind, reawakened, reborn in
 a stranger? Best forgotten, eh?

 map of disbelief, "What are you doing?"

 You don't get it. You're just helping her with her shopping, "I was...
 just trying to help. Helping with your shopping..." She pushes you
 away, "Get off! Leave me alone!" You stand back, "Sorry..."

 You walk back to your trolley, "If you do need my help--just ask."
 God, next time you won't bother. What is it with people?

 Staring at the gnocchi you feel a memory slowly, awkwardly, awfully
 rise to the surface.

 --The scooter driver looks surprised. You grab for Clare and jump to
 the side--bounce across the road, scrape your head--

 Scuffed and light headed you open your eyes... your hands are
 empty--Clare is a few metres away, lying awkwardly. Splattered with a
 thin red liquid, reflecting the scooter's bright red paintwork.

 The scooter skids--you jump. You are in the supermarket. Your hands
 are empty, sweaty.

  or,
  <span class="floydstyle i">(c)</span> your mother, in disguise.

 You slowly start to back away, keeping your eyes on her. As you clear
 the end of the aisle, she turns, reaching into her jacket. You dive
 across the end of the aisle, scrambling to your feet and running
 towards the exits. You get to the doors, wait. After what seems like
 an age the automatic sensors concede and the doors slide open. You
 emerge into the car park. <span class="floydstyle em">Shit</span>.

 The car park is full of <span class="floydstyle em">cars</span>--they must have known you were
 here. You can't escape now.

 You fall to your knees, a trolley-parker approaching--why are they
 being so blatant? They're normally so clever. They must know they have
 won.

 Sweating in your skull, your brain decides that the best way to calm
 you down is to deny you consciousness. The world fades, blurry and
 greasy, the parker speaks--threatening code-speak--"Sir, are you OK?"

 You remember the meal like this: Clare sat opposite. It was warm but
 an evening breeze took the uncomfortable edge of the heat. You ordered
 and the food took a while to come. The wine made your face red. You
 walked back after the meal via the Spanish Steps. You sat amongst the
 crowds until the police moved you on so that they could wash the steps
 ready for the tourists in the morning. You strolled back to the hotel
 down backstreets, past the four fountain junction; a crossroads with
 fountains built into the houses on each corner. You knew from
 experience that the water in them was ice cold, even in the afternoon
 heat. You ran a finger through the water as you walked past and wiped
 it on your trousers before taking Clare's hand in yours. Which seems
 like a good place to end.

 Late Thursday night. You've had a <span class="floydstyle em">hard</span> day and the last thing
 you need is this: shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and
 you're progressing rapidly.

 On to the next aisle.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Interesting... fresh Gnocchi--you haven't had any of that since...</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i"></span><span class="floydstyle em">Rome</span>.

 The aisle stretches to the north, and back to the south. The shelves
 on either side of you block your view of the rest of the supermarket,
 with only the brightly coloured aisle markers visible.

 You remember the Pantheon. It looked so solid... it had stood the test
 of time. You were sure that nothing could be ephemeral after being
 near that. It was so beautiful, yet strong. Timeless. But you were
 wrong--it was the only thing that was so. Your life, your
 relationship, Clare.. all open to change, decay and collapse.

 The image of the Pantheon in your head slowly sinks, failing to
 support you with its pillars. You move the memory aside, out of direct
 sight, and continue with the shopping.

 Remember love? You don't even know what the word means any more. You
 need to find love again before you can remember it. Right now all
 there is is a dulled pain. And Gnocchi rubbing it in.

 Your mind wanders over the day's work. Fairly usual stuff; Johnathon
 really pissed you off, taking your work, putting a cover on it and
 getting all the credit. But lunch was cool; Michelle and you had a fun
 chat about her new boyfriend over coffee. You pointed out that he was
 exactly twice her age, something she hadn't realised. Plus, you
 managed to get all the Longbridge account finished, which is a weight
 off your mind--

 A mental kick up the arse--stop thinking about work and get on with
 the shopping. Clare'll kill you if you're back late.

 A quick scoot round the rest of the supermarket--a full trolley--then,
 stepping on the gas, you arrive home just before seven. Clare opens
 the door to you, "Ooh... home early? What have I done to be so lucky?"
