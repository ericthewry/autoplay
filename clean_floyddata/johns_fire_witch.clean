 GlkTADS - A text-only TADS 2.5.3 Interpreter.
 TADS copyright (c) 1993, 2000 by Michael J. Roberts.


 It's a cold weekend in December of 1990, and it's been far too long
 since you have seen your friend John Baker!  But you've finally managed
 to take some time out of your schedule to drive to Columbus and spend
 some "quality time" together.  Quality time, of course, means that you
 and he are going to sample every bar that Ohio State University's High
 Street has to offer.

 John was to meet you at a favorite pizza and beer spot to start off the
 evening, but he hasn't showed up.  John's always been rather
 spontaneous (read that as 'erratic'), so you think he'll show up
 eventually.  But as the night wears on and you tire of downing beers by
 yourself, you decide to drive to his place and see if he's left a note
 or something for you there.

 You find his front door unlocked and John nowhere to be found.  Pretty
 tired from your earlier drive, and also buzzing a bit from the beer you
 drank, you quickly doze off in the living room.

 It is now morning.  A terrible snow storm is raging outside, the worst
 you've ever seen.  You can't believe how much snow has piled up over
 the night.  You still haven't heard from John, and you seem to now be
 trapped in his apartment.

 Living Room
    This is John's Living Room.  It is in its usual state of disarray,
 littered with junk (old copies of alternative newspapers, empty beer
 cans and bottles, dirty plates and glasses, and so on).  What a
 complete sloth!  To the north is the dining area.  There is a door
 leading outside to the south.  One set of stairs leads down to the
 basement, while another set leads upstairs.

>examine junk
 There is a fairly large amount of junk here, consisting mostly of empty
 beer cans and bottles, dirty plates and glasses, old copies of
 alternative newspapers, etc.  There is very little of it that you would
 consider touching.

>search junk
 You find nothing of interest.

>go south
 Red Robin Road
    You are outside the apartment on Red Robin Road.  It is bitterly
 cold, and the storm drives snow into your face.  Huge drifts of snow
 block your way in every direction you look.  The door back into the
 apartment is to the north.

>examine snow
 The huge drifts of snow block your path in every direction.

>dig in snow
 What do you want to dig in it with?

>me
 The snow isn't important.

 You know, it really is quite cold out here.  Perhaps you should step
 back in to the apartment and warm up.  You already can't feel your
 fingers and toes.

>search snow
 The snow isn't important.

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

 It is so cold that you are beginning to feel sleepy.  You remember
 reading somewhere that this is a really bad sign.  Perhaps you should
 step back into the apartment, unless you're really intent on freezing
 to death.

>go north

 littered with junk (old copies of alternative newspapers, empty beer
 cans and bottles, dirty plates and glasses, and so on).  What a
 complete sloth!  To the north is the dining area.  There is a door
 leading outside to the south.  One set of stairs leads down to the
 basement, while another set leads upstairs.

>search junk
 You find nothing of interest.

>close door
 The door isn't important.

>clean junk
 The junk looks a bit cleaner now.

>go north
 Dining Area
    This is the Dining Area, inaptly named here since it is never used
 for that purpose.  This room is less cluttered than the living room,
 but that's not saying much.  The kitchen is to the east, while the
 living room lies to the south.
    Sitting on the dinner table is a handwritten letter.

>examine clutter
 I don't know the word "clutter".

>examine junk
 I don't see any junk here.

>examine letter
 It appears to be a letter from John to his landlord.  It seems to
 display a lot of anger.

>read letter
 Dear Pig:

 There is no way that I am going to pay any more rent than I already do
 for this hole you call an apartment.  The rent you're already charging
 is paramount to extortion for a struggling student like myself.  You
 don't do a thing I ask, you don't answer maintenance calls, and you
 have refused to fix the hole that has opened up in the basement.  So
 bugger off.

            - John

>get letter
 Taken.

>examine table
 It's your everyday dinner table.  You notice numerous nicks and
 scratches in the surface, as though someone had repeatedly bounced a
 coin off of it.

>look under table
 There's nothing under the dinner table.

>go east
 Kitchen
    The kitchen is in better shape than you would expect after seeing
 the rest of the apartment.  This puzzles you for a moment, until you
 figure out that John probably eats out all the time.  A door leads
 outside to the north, and the dining area is to the west.
    You see a stove and a refrigerator here.  Sitting on the stove is a
 big pan. Sitting on the refrigerator is a typed letter.

>get typed letter
 Taken.

>examine it
 It appears to be a letter to John from his landlord telling him that
 his rent is going up.  The landlord sounds really greedy.

>read it
 Dear Tenant:

 As some of you may know, I have recently purchased a third sports car.
 This one was exceptionally expensive, and in order to maintain my
 extravagant lifestyle, I am going to have to increase your rent again.
 I can't exactly remember what I charge you now (my accountant handles
 all that stuff), but whatever it is, add $50 a month from now on.

            Thanks

>examine stove
 There is a thin layer of dust on the stove; further evidence that this
 room is not used much.  Continued inspection shows that the stove does
 not even work.  You wonder if John is aware of this or if he even
 cares.  On the stove you see a big pan.

>examine pan
 This big pan appears to have been filled with lasagna at one time, but
 it is now empty.  John told you yesterday on the phone that he was
 making it for the both of you.  He has got to be one of the biggest
 gluttons you know.

>get pan
 Taken.

>fridge
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>open fridge
 You open the refrigerator, and find it completely empty.  John never
 ceases to amaze you.  You close it back up, shaking your head.

>open stove
 The oven door seems to be stuck.  It does open just a little bit, and
 you catch the pleasant odor of cooked fish, possibly herring.

>go north
 Patio
    You are outside the apartment, on a patio enclosed by fencing.  The
 storm wails around you, driving snow into your face.  It is bitterly
 cold.  A fence door leads north out into the apartment complex parking
 lot, but there is so much snow piled against it that you doubt you
 could open it.  The door back into the apartment is to the south.

>examine snow
 The snow is drifted against the door so that you can't open it.

>fencing
 I don't know the word "fencing".

>examine fence
 That's not important.

 You know, it really is quite cold out here.  Perhaps you should step
 back in to the apartment and warm up.  You already can't feel your
 fingers and toes.

>examine lot
 I don't know the word "lot".

>go south
 Kitchen
    The kitchen is in better shape than you would expect after seeing
 the rest of the apartment.  This puzzles you for a moment, until you
 figure out that John probably eats out all the time.  A door leads
 outside to the north, and the dining area is to the west.
    You see a stove and a refrigerator here.

 littered with junk (old copies of alternative newspapers, empty beer
 cans and bottles, dirty plates and glasses, and so on).  What a
 complete sloth!  To the north is the dining area.  There is a door
 leading outside to the south.  One set of stairs leads down to the
 basement, while another set leads upstairs.

>go up
 Landing
    This is the landing at the top of the steps.  A laundry chute is in
 the wall here.  To the north is John's bedroom, while the bathroom lies
 to the east.  The stairs lead down.

>examine chute
 This is a laundry chute.  It most likely travels from here down into
 the basement.

>look in chute
 This is a laundry chute.  It most likely travels from here down into
 the basement.

>enter chute
 I don't know how to enter the laundry chute.

>go east
 Bathroom
    The bathroom is typical for an apartment like this.  The floor is
 tiled and bare.  The shower curtain is a striking blend of wild colors.
 It is just beginning to show the first signs of mold.  The landing lies
 to the west.
    Sitting on the sink is a flashlight.

>get flashlight
 Taken.

>examine it
 The flashlight is off.  There seems to be no battery in it.

>examine curtain
 That's not important.

>examine mold
 Pretty gross.

>get mold
 The mold isn't important.

>examine sink
 It's a typical bathroom sink.  What did you expect to find?

>clean curtain
 The shower curtain isn't important.

>flush toilet
 I don't know the word "flush".

>examine toilet
 I don't know the word "toilet".

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>go west
 Landing
    This is the landing at the top of the steps.  A laundry chute is in
 the wall here.  To the north is John's bedroom, while the bathroom lies
 to the east.  The stairs lead down.

>go north
 John's Bedroom
    This is John's bedroom.  You are immediately surprised by the sheer
 volume of dirty clothes that cover the floor.  The room itself is
 furnished with rather spartan furniture.  You can exit back to the
 landing to the south.
    You see a bed here.

>examine clothes
 There is a terrific volume of dirty clothes here, completely covering
 the floor to a depth of about three inches.  Who knows what all could
 be mixed in among them?

>search clothes
 You find a crystal card!  What else could be in here?

>search clothes
 You find a picture!  What else could be in here?

>search clothes
 You find a modem!  What else could be in here?

>search clothes
 There's nothing else in the clothes.

>examine modem
 It does not surprise you at all that John left an expensive modem like
 this in the pile of clothes you found it in.

>examine picture
 This is a picture of a rather lusty-looking girl.  She must be very
 important to John, for him to have left the picture all mixed in with
 his important clothes like that.

>examine crystal card
 This card is about the size of a playing card.  It is made out of some
 type of gleaming crystal, and is grey in color.

>rub card
 Nothing happens.

>examine bed
 It looks like an ordinary bed.  You would have been disappointed in
 John if it had been made, but it's not.

>look under bed
 You find a battery and a book!

>make bed
 You start to make the bed, and then decide that John might get upset
 about it.

>put battery in flashlight
 Done.

>examine book
 The book appears to be a diary, probably John's.  You're not going to
 read it are you?

>read book
 The diary goes on about mundane personal matters, as diaries are wont
 to do, for quite some time.  A recurring theme seems to be how envious
 John is of people who are out "living life".  This puzzles you a bit,
 since John has done more crazy shit than any 10 people you know, with
 the possible exception of some of his psycho friends.

 The last couple of pages are really strange.  Apparently a few days
 ago, a hole opened in John's basement due to some water damage.  John
 has been having dreams about a "Fire Witch" and an "Ice Wizard" that
 live down this hole.  Here's the part that's really weird:  he thinks
 the dreams are real.  The ice wizard has imprisoned the fire witch, and
 John seems almost obsessed with freeing her.  He also talks about a
 "magic crystal card" that the fire witch gave him in a dream.  By
 rubbing it and saying the "magic word" necken-sway, John thinks that he
 can find the fire witch.  He talks about the card as if he actually has
 it in his possession.

 Obviously, years of heavy drinking have finally destroyed his mind.

>say "necken-sway"
 Nothing happens.

>rub card
 Nothing happens.

>say "necken-sway"
 Nothing happens.

>say neckensway
 I don't know the word "neckensway".

>rub card and say necken-sway
 Nothing happens.

 I don't understand that sentence.

 John's Bedroom
    This is John's bedroom.  You are immediately surprised by the sheer

 furnished with rather spartan furniture.  You can exit back to the
 landing to the south.
    You see a bed, a crystal card, a picture, a modem, and a book here.

>take all

    This is John's Living Room.  It is in its usual state of disarray,
 littered with junk (old copies of alternative newspapers, empty beer
 cans and bottles, dirty plates and glasses, and so on).  What a
 complete sloth!  To the north is the dining area.  There is a door
 leading outside to the south.  One set of stairs leads down to the
 basement, while another set leads upstairs.

>go down
 Basement
    This is the basement of the apartment.  It is unfinished, and there
 is no furniture here.  There is a large hole in the west wall, probably
 large enough for you to fit through, and a set of stairs lead up.
    You see a board here.

>examine board
 This is a 2x4 board.  It appears very sturdy.

>take board

>go west
 Hollow Space
    You are in a hollow space in between the walls of John's basement
 and the basement of one of his neighbors.  You are pretty cramped; you
 can barely fit in here.  It is also kind of dark, making you strain to
 see.  A dark, forbidding hole leads down, while you can return to the
 basement to the east.

>go down
 You carefully climb down the hole into darkness.  It goes straight down
 for at least 100 feet; luckily it is pretty rough and there are many
 handholds and places to position your feet.  Finally, you drop down
 into a room below.

 It's pitch black.

>switch on flashlight
 The flashlight is now on.

>look
 Red Crystal Grotto
    You have entered a grotto made entirely of some type of gleaming
 red-tinted crystal.  The crystal achieves the effect of appearing both
 natural and crafted.  Floors, ceiling, and walls all smoothly blend
 together.  The light from your flashlight is reflected back to you both
 from the direction you are pointing it and from other parts of the
 room, as gleams of red light seem to travel through the crystal to
 emerge elsewhere.

 The overall effect is quite beautiful.

 A hole in the ceiling, just reachable, leads up.  To the south, the
 crystal slowly turns into some type of grey stone and becomes a tunnel.

>examine red crystal
 I don't see any red crystal here.

>rub card
 As you rub the card, its color changes to grey.

>examine crystal
 This card is about the size of a playing card.  It is made out of some

 I don't know the word "xzyy".

>go up
 You jump up and manage to get yourself at least partly into the hole.
 Pulling yourself into it, you start your long climb upwards.  You
 arrive in the hollow space out of breath.

 A hole in the ceiling, just reachable, leads up.  To the south, the
 crystal slowly turns into some type of grey stone and becomes a tunnel.

>go south
 Long Tunnel (1)
    This is a long tunnel leading north and south.  It has definitely
 been purposefully made, being tiled with crafted stone.  It looks like
 something that would have been created centuries ago.  You can see the
 Red Crystal Grotto to the north, and a side corridor leads off to the
 east.

>examine files
 I don't know the word "files".

>oops tiles
 I don't see any tiles here.

>go east
 Cell Block
    This room, tiled with the same stone as the long tunnel, smells a
 bit dank.  Moisture must get in here somewhere.  The room appears to be
 a cell block, mainly because there are jail cells with entrances on the
 northern, eastern, and southern walls.  The exit is to the west.

 The northern cell appears to be completely filled up by something
 massive.

>examine massive
 I don't know the word "massive".

>go north
 The northern cell is completely filled with ice.  You can't enter it.

>examine ice
 The ice completely fills the northern cell.  It feels cold and slick to
 the touch, but does not appear to be melting.  Something is frozen in
 the center of the ice, a human figure.  As you continue to peer through
 the frozen mass, you realize with a shiver that it looks a lot like
 John.

>examine john
 John appears to be frozen in the center of the ice in the northern
 cell.  You are worried about his health.

>go east
 Eastern Cell
    You are in a non-descript 10 x 10 room of tiled stone.  It has the
 appearances of a cell, but has no door.  There is an exit to the west.

>go west
 As you try to move west through the exit, you feel as though you are
 pushing yourself through thick molasses.  It takes quite a bit of
 effort and no small amount of time to get yourself back out into the
 cell block.

    This is a long tunnel leading north and south.  It has definitely

 something that would have been created centuries ago.  You can see the
 Red Crystal Grotto to the north, and a side corridor leads off to the
 east.

>go south

    The long tunnel continues to lead north and south.  The same tiling
 is present here as in the rest of the tunnel.  A side corridor leads
 off to the west.

>examine tiling
 I don't know the word "tiling".

>go south
 Long Tunnel (3)
    The long tunnel continues to lead both north and south.  The
 carefully-crafted stone tile appears to be a darker grey here.  Your
 way to the south appears to be blocked by a deep pit, but there is a
 side corridor leading off to the east.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 Long Tunnel (2)
    The long tunnel continues to lead north and south.  The same tiling
 is present here as in the rest of the tunnel.  A side corridor leads
 off to the west.

>go west
 Side Corridor
    This is a side corridor leading east and west.  It is somewhat
 smaller than the long tunnel, which lies to the east.  An archway lies
 to the west.  You can't put your finger on it, but you have a very
 strange feeling about that archway.

>examine archway
 The archway is made of the same tiled stone as the rest of the
 construction seems to be made of.  Shining your light through the
 archway reveals the dim outline of a room with a safe in the wall
 beyond it.

 There is something that you can't put your finger on about the archway
 that bothers you.

>SAVE

 I don't know the word "finger".

>touch archway
 Touching the archway doesn't seem to have any effect.

>go west
 As you are moving through the archway, you hear a sound much like that
 of breaking glass, and you suddenly become very disoriented.  When you
 regain your senses a moment later, you are not where you thought you
 would be.

 Eastern Cell
    You are in a non-descript 10 x 10 room of tiled stone.  It has the
 appearances of a cell, but has no door.  There is an exit to the west.

 There is a loud and horrible rushing noise in your ears, and the room
 appears to be filling up with what you would describe as steam if it
 were not so very very cold.

>go west
 You frantically try to push out of the room, but moving through the
 doorway is like trying to push through thick molasses.


 Your flesh feels like leather and your eyes like glass as a huge block
 of ice forms around you.  Mysteriously you are not killed outright by
 this; instead you fall into a deep sleep.  Unfortunately, within a few
 days without food you expire anyway.

 Long Tunnel (3)
    The long tunnel continues to lead both north and south.  The
 carefully-crafted stone tile appears to be a darker grey here.  Your
 way to the south appears to be blocked by a deep pit, but there is a
 side corridor leading off to the east.

>examine pit
 You can just make out the bottom of the pit with your flashlight; the
 floor is covered with sharp spikes pointing upwards.  This is not
 something you want to fall into.  The pit is pretty far across, too.
 Jumping it would be chancy, and you'd probably want to be carrying as
 little as possible.


>go east
 Vault Room
    The walls here are made of a mixture of stone and steel.  The room
 is completely dominated by a large metal vault whose door is almost the
 entire east wall.  Light illuminates this room, but you can't tell
 where it is coming from.  You can exit back to the long tunnel to the
 west.
    You see a thin rod here.

>get rod
 You've already got your hands full.

>examine it
 This thin rod is made of some indeterminite material and is black in
 color.  It looks like a magician's wand.  A word is written in a fancy
 looking script on the rod's side.

>read rod
 The word reads "tar-molay".

>say "tar-molay"
 Nothing happens.

>examine door
 It is made of steel, and probably about three feet thick.  There are
 three dials on the vault door, each one is notated with numbers ranging
 from 1 to 36. Some quick mental arithmetic tells you that means over
 45,000 combinations.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll get a hunch.

>inventory
 You have a handwritten letter, a typed letter, a big pan, a flashlight
 (providing light), a crystal card, a picture, a modem, a book, and a
 board.  The flashlight seems to contain a battery.

>put all in pan

>wave wand
 As you wave the thin rod, blue sparkles appear in the air around it.
 The rod itself is glowing with a soft blue light.

>say "tar-molay"
 The thin rod wrenches itself from your hand and attaches firmly to the
 vault door.  The big pan flies into the air and attaches itself to the
 thin rod.  A moment later, the thin rod stops glowing.  The thin rod
 drops to the floor.  The big pan drops off of the thin rod.

 Long Tunnel (3)
    The long tunnel continues to lead both north and south.  The
 carefully-crafted stone tile appears to be a darker grey here.  Your
 way to the south appears to be blocked by a deep pit, but there is a
 side corridor leading off to the east.

>examine pit
 You can just make out the bottom of the pit with your flashlight; the
 floor is covered with sharp spikes pointing upwards.  This is not
 something you want to fall into.  The pit is pretty far across, too.
 Jumping it would be chancy, and you'd probably want to be carrying as
 little as possible.

 Side Corridor
    This is a side corridor leading east and west.  It is somewhat
 smaller than the long tunnel, which lies to the east.  An archway lies
 to the west.  You can't put your finger on it, but you have a very
 strange feeling about that archway.

>inventory
 You have a handwritten letter, a typed letter, a flashlight (providing
 light), a crystal card, a picture, a modem, a book, a board, and a thin
 rod.  The flashlight seems to contain a battery.

 You're feeling a bit run-down and tired.  This always happens when you

 Long Tunnel (1)
    This is a long tunnel leading north and south.  It has definitely
 been purposefully made, being tiled with crafted stone.  It looks like
 something that would have been created centuries ago.  You can see the
 Red Crystal Grotto to the north, and a side corridor leads off to the
 east.

>go north
 Red Crystal Grotto
    You have entered a grotto made entirely of some type of gleaming
 red-tinted crystal.  The crystal achieves the effect of appearing both
 natural and crafted.  Floors, ceiling, and walls all smoothly blend
 together.  The light from your flashlight is reflected back to you both
 from the direction you are pointing it and from other parts of the
 room, as gleams of red light seem to travel through the crystal to
 emerge elsewhere.

 The overall effect is quite beautiful.

 A hole in the ceiling, just reachable, leads up.  To the south, the
 crystal slowly turns into some type of grey stone and becomes a tunnel.

>go up
 You jump up and manage to get yourself at least partly into the hole.
 Pulling yourself into it, you start your long climb upwards.  You
 arrive in the hollow space out of breath.

 Hollow Space
    You are in a hollow space in between the walls of John's basement
 and the basement of one of his neighbors.  You are pretty cramped; you
 can barely fit in here.  It is also kind of dark, making you strain to
 see.  A dark, forbidding hole leads down, while you can return to the
 basement to the east.

>go east
 Basement
    This is the basement of the apartment.  It is unfinished, and there
 is no furniture here.  There is a large hole in the west wall, probably
 large enough for you to fit through, and a set of stairs lead up.

>go up
 Living Room
    This is John's Living Room.  It is in its usual state of disarray,
 littered with junk (old copies of alternative newspapers, empty beer
 cans and bottles, dirty plates and glasses, and so on).  What a
 complete sloth!  To the north is the dining area.  There is a door
 leading outside to the south.  One set of stairs leads down to the
 basement, while another set leads upstairs.

>go up
 Landing
    This is the landing at the top of the steps.  A laundry chute is in
 the wall here.  To the north is John's bedroom, while the bathroom lies
 to the east.  The stairs lead down.

>go north
 John's Bedroom
    This is John's bedroom.  You are immediately surprised by the sheer
 volume of dirty clothes that cover the floor.  The room itself is
 furnished with rather spartan furniture.  You can exit back to the
 landing to the south.
    You see a bed here.

>lie on bed
 Okay, you're now lying on the bed.

>sleep
 Snuggling up in John's bed, you drift pleasantly off to sleep.  During
 your comfortable sleep, you have a dream.  You are wandering through a
 vast desert at night.  The wind whips sand into you, and it is cold
 enough to make you shiver.  You know that you are looking for
 something.

 Finally, you come upon a cage just sitting out in the middle of the
 lonely expanse.  Inside is a beautiful woman in crimson robes, who
 turns to face you as you approach.

 She seems troubled.  "You are not the one who usually comes," she says,
 and then drops her head.  "I do not have the strength to continue very
 much longer. You must get this to the one who calls himself 'John'."

 With what seems like a great amount of effort, she hands you a small
 slip of paper through the bars of the cage.  Almost immediately the
 cage disappears, the woman with it.

 You wake up some time later, feeling refreshed.

>examine paper
 This small slip of paper holds some cryptic numbers.

>read paper

 Vault Room
    The walls here are made of a mixture of stone and steel.  The room
 is completely dominated by a large metal vault whose door is almost the

 The demon is about 12 feet tall, has large leathery bat-like wings, and
 is heavily muscled.  Its skin is glossy black.  Large tusks protrude
 from its face, and it looks really angry.  You suddenly realize that it
 may not have been a good idea to take time out to examine it more
 closely.

 The demon's hand grabs your right shoulder, jerking you up off your

 East Ledge
    You are on a small ledge (barely big enough to hold you) looking out
 over a huge cavern.  The floor of the cavern (if there is one) lies so
 far down that you cannot see it, while the ceiling is about 40 feet
 above you.  You can return to the long tunnel to the east.

 To the west, hanging by a chain from the ceiling, is a large wooden
 disk.  The chain is attached to the center of the disk, which looks to
 be about 5 feet wide.  You think that you could probably jump to the
 disk from here.  It's not nearly as long a distance to have to jump as
 the pit was.

 You back up a bit in order to get some speed, and take off running
 towards the disk at your best sprint.  At the edge of the ledge, you
 leap out into the cavern towards the disk.  You make it fairly easily,
 but the disk tilts sickeningly as you land on it.  You begin a mad
 scramble towards the chain as gravity tries to slide you off the edge.
 Many frightening seconds later, your hands grasp the chain and you pull
 yourself to the center of the disk.  Whew!

 Disk
    You are precariously standing on a wooden disk, hanging suspended
 from the cavern ceiling by a chain.  You cannot see the floor of the
 cavern.  To both the east and west, you can see ledges in the middle of
 the cavern walls.  The problem is, although it was easy to jump *to*
 the disk, you don't have enough room for a running start to jump *off*
 the disk.

>swing
 (the disk)
 Using your own body, you begin swinging the disk from east to west.
 After about a minute, you've got quite an arc going.

 The disk swings to the east.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The disk is swinging to the west, but is in a neutral position.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The disk swings to the west.

>go west
 As the disk reaches the point closest to the west ledge, you make your
 leap!  No problem!  You land with a thud that takes your breath away
 for a few seconds, but you are safe and sound.

 West Ledge
    You are on a small ledge (barely big enough to hold you) looking out
 over a huge cavern.  The floor of the cavern (if there is one) lies so
 far down that you cannot see it, while the ceiling is about 40 feet
 above you.  The ledge leads a short distance into the cavern wall and
 immediately turns south.

 To the east, hanging by a chain from the ceiling, is a large wooden
 disk.  The chain is attached to the center of the disk, which looks to
 be about 5 feet wide.  The disk is a little farther away from here than
 it was from the east ledge; although you could jump to it from here,
 you don't know if you could stay on it when you got there or not.

 The disk comes to rest.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>go south
 Green Crystal Grotto
    You have entered a grotto made entirely of some type of gleaming
 green-tinted crystal.  The crystal achieves the effect of appearing
 both natural and crafted.  Floors, ceiling, and walls all smoothly
 blend together.  The light from your flashlight is reflected back to
 you both from the direction you are pointing it and from other parts of
 the room, as gleams of green light seem to travel through the crystal
 to emerge elsewhere.

 The overall effect is quite beautiful.

 To the north, the crystal turns to stone and turns immediately east.
 An opening in the crystal leads south.

>examine card
 This card is about the size of a playing card.  It is made out of some
 type of gleaming crystal, and is green in color.

 Long Tunnel (1)
    This is a long tunnel leading north and south.  It has definitely
 been purposefully made, being tiled with crafted stone.  It looks like
 something that would have been created centuries ago.  You can see the
 Red Crystal Grotto to the north, and a side corridor leads off to the
 east.

>go south
 Long Tunnel (2)
    The long tunnel continues to lead north and south.  The same tiling
 is present here as in the rest of the tunnel.  A side corridor leads
 off to the west.

>go south
 Long Tunnel (3)
    The long tunnel continues to lead both north and south.  The
 carefully-crafted stone tile appears to be a darker grey here.  Your
 way to the south appears to be blocked by a deep pit, but there is a
 side corridor leading off to the east.
    You see a picture, a modem, a book, a board, a thin rod, a slip of
 paper, and a red gem here.

 Goblin Room
    A small rather non-descript grey-stone cavern, this location does
 have one thing that makes it distinct:  an ornate archway leading
 south.  You can see the green crystal grotto to the north.
    There is a small, fierce guardian creature blocking your way to the
 south.  For some reason, the name 'goblin' pops into your head.

 The goblin charges you, but you dodge aside.

>examine goblin
 The goblin is a little smaller than you are, but it appears very
 fierce.  Small tusks protrude from its pig-like face, and razor-sharp
 talons spring from its hands.  The goblin appears to be wearing a large
 lead key around its neck.

 The goblin snarls at you like a mad dog.

>attack goblin
 (with the board)
 You ram the end of the board into the goblin's stomach, knocking it
 back several feet.  It looks hurt, but also more than a little furious.

 The goblin charges you, but you dodge aside.

>again
 Holding the board like a baseball bat, you crack the goblin upside the
 head.  A lead key (previously unseen) flies from a chain around the
 goblin's neck.  While the goblin staggers back dazed, you take
 advantage of the situation and crack it in the head again.  This time
 you hear a sickening snap, and it drops to the ground dead.

>take key
 You've already got your hands full.

>examine key
 The key is about two inches long and pretty thick for a key.  It is
 made of lead; this puzzles you as you would expect a key to be made of
 a stronger metal.

>examine archway
 The archway is made entirely of marble.  It leads south.

 It's definitely dead, apparently from a cracked skull.  Its pig-like

 Pedestal Room
    This tiny room is made entirely of smooth, polished marble.  The
 only feature is a small marble pedestal in the southern portion of the
 room.  It appears to be firmly attached to the floor, or perhaps even a
 part of it.  The only exit is north.
    Sitting on the marble pedestal is a blue gem.

 West Ledge
    You are on a small ledge (barely big enough to hold you) looking out
 over a huge cavern.  The floor of the cavern (if there is one) lies so
 far down that you cannot see it, while the ceiling is about 40 feet
 above you.  The ledge leads a short distance into the cavern wall and
 immediately turns south.

 To the east, hanging by a chain from the ceiling, is a large wooden
 disk.  The chain is attached to the center of the disk, which looks to
 be about 5 feet wide.  The disk is a little farther away from here than
 it was from the east ledge; although you could jump to it from here,
 you don't know if you could stay on it when you got there or not.

>go east
 The disk is a little farther away from the West Ledge as it is from the
 East Ledge.  You know that you could jump to it, but after the way it
 tilted last time, the thought of making a longer jump kind of worries
 you.  If you want to jump to the disk from here, you'll have to tell me
 so explicitly by saying 'jump'.

>jump
 You back up a bit in order to get some speed, and take off running
 towards the disk at your best sprint.  At the edge of the ledge, you
 leap out into the cavern towards the disk.  You make it fairly easily,
 but the disk tilts sickeningly as you land on it.  You don't have as
 good of a position as you have had before, and after a few moments of
 mad scrambling, you slide off the disk to begin a long plummet to the
 cavern floors below.

 Cell Block
    This room, tiled with the same stone as the long tunnel, smells a
 bit dank.  Moisture must get in here somewhere.  The room appears to be
 a cell block, mainly because there are jail cells with entrances on the
 northern, eastern, and southern walls.  The exit is to the west.

 The northern and southern cells are individually filled up by something
 massive.

 A hole in the ceiling, just reachable, leads up.  To the south, the
 crystal slowly turns into some type of grey stone and becomes a tunnel.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>go up
 You jump up and manage to get yourself at least partly into the hole.
 Pulling yourself into it, you start your long climb upwards.  You
 arrive in the hollow space out of breath.

 Hollow Space
    You are in a hollow space in between the walls of John's basement
 and the basement of one of his neighbors.  You are pretty cramped; you
 can barely fit in here.  It is also kind of dark, making you strain to
 see.  A dark, forbidding hole leads down, while you can return to the
 basement to the east.

>go east

    This is the basement of the apartment.  It is unfinished, and there

 large enough for you to fit through, and a set of stairs lead up.

 Living Room
    This is John's Living Room.  It is in its usual state of disarray,
 littered with junk (old copies of alternative newspapers, empty beer
 cans and bottles, dirty plates and glasses, and so on).  What a
 complete sloth!  To the north is the dining area.  There is a door
 leading outside to the south.  One set of stairs leads down to the
 basement, while another set leads upstairs.

 Dining Area
    This is the Dining Area, inaptly named here since it is never used
 for that purpose.  This room is less cluttered than the living room,

    The kitchen is in better shape than you would expect after seeing
 the rest of the apartment.  This puzzles you for a moment, until you

 straining for the edge on the other side.  You immediately know you're
 not going to make it.

 *** WHACK ***

 Your body smacks the side of the pit, and you claw at the edge (just an
 inch away from your fingertips) for just a second, before bouncing
 backwards to fall to the spikes below.  A second later you are thinking
 how strange the tips of the spikes look protruding from your torso like
 that.  Coughing blood, you expire.

 Your body smacks the side of the pit, and you claw at the edge, just

 yourself up over the edge, and worm your way to the safety of the floor
 beyond.  You DO NOT want to try that again.

 Devil's Task Room
    This small cavern appears completely natural.  The rock is very
 rough, and stalactites hang from the ceiling.  To the north there is an
 exit laced with gleaming blue crystal.  To the south, the cavern opens
 up into a much larger cavern, with a drop-off that leads down farther
 than you can see.  Spanning the vast emptiness of the large cavern is a
 bridge that appears to be made entirely of ice.  A chill comes from
 that direction.
    A red tinted devil stands casually against the cavern wall here.  He
 appears to be ignoring you.

>examine devil
 The devil is about your size, and mostly human in appearance.  The only
 thing that gives him away are two small horns protruding from his head
 and a slight reddish tint to his skin.  Quite a handsome fellow
 actually.  He is leaning casually against the cavern wall.

>kiss devil
 "Being affectionate won't help you."

>ask devil about task
 "Glad you asked.  Hmmmm....".

 The devil produces a small leather bag from the folds of his clothes
 and throws it at your feet.

 "That's a magic bag that can hold as much of anything that you can fit
 into the opening.  You take it, fill it full of all of the sins, and
 bring it back to me.  If you've got all of the sins in there, and
 nothing but sin, I'll let you by.  BUT - if you have anything in there
 that isn't a sin, or you don't have them all, I get your soul."

 The devil flashes you a quick smile.

 [Your score just went up by 1 point.]

 above you.  You can return to the long tunnel to the east.

 To the west, hanging by a chain from the ceiling, is a large wooden
 disk.  The chain is attached to the center of the disk, which looks to
 be about 5 feet wide.  You think that you could probably jump to the
 disk from here.  It's not nearly as long a distance to have to jump as
 the pit was.

>put me in bag
 You can't put yourself anywhere.

>go west
 You back up a bit in order to get some speed, and take off running

    You are precariously standing on a wooden disk, hanging suspended

 (the disk)
 Using your own body, you begin swinging the disk from east to west.
 After about a minute, you've got quite an arc going.

 The disk swings to the east.

 Time passes...

 The disk is swinging to the west, but is in a neutral position.

 Time passes...

 The disk swings to the west.

 As the disk reaches the point closest to the west ledge, you make your
 leap!  No problem!  You land with a thud that takes your breath away
 for a few seconds, but you are safe and sound.

 West Ledge
    You are on a small ledge (barely big enough to hold you) looking out
 over a huge cavern.  The floor of the cavern (if there is one) lies so
 far down that you cannot see it, while the ceiling is about 40 feet
 above you.  The ledge leads a short distance into the cavern wall and
 immediately turns south.

 To the east, hanging by a chain from the ceiling, is a large wooden
 disk.  The chain is attached to the center of the disk, which looks to
 be about 5 feet wide.  The disk is a little farther away from here than
 it was from the east ledge; although you could jump to it from here,
 you don't know if you could stay on it when you got there or not.

 The disk comes to rest.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>go south
 Green Crystal Grotto
    You have entered a grotto made entirely of some type of gleaming
 green-tinted crystal.  The crystal achieves the effect of appearing
 both natural and crafted.  Floors, ceiling, and walls all smoothly
 blend together.  The light from your flashlight is reflected back to
 you both from the direction you are pointing it and from other parts of
 the room, as gleams of green light seem to travel through the crystal
 to emerge elsewhere.

 The overall effect is quite beautiful.

 To the north, the crystal turns to stone and turns immediately east.
 An opening in the crystal leads south.

 Long Tunnel (1)
    This is a long tunnel leading north and south.  It has definitely
 been purposefully made, being tiled with crafted stone.  It looks like
 something that would have been created centuries ago.  You can see the
 Red Crystal Grotto to the north, and a side corridor leads off to the
 east.

 Long Tunnel (2)
    The long tunnel continues to lead north and south.  The same tiling
 is present here as in the rest of the tunnel.  A side corridor leads
 off to the west.

 Long Tunnel (3)
    The long tunnel continues to lead both north and south.  The
 carefully-crafted stone tile appears to be a darker grey here.  Your
 way to the south appears to be blocked by a deep pit, but there is a
 side corridor leading off to the east.
    You see a picture, a modem, a book, a board, a thin rod, a slip of
 paper, and a red gem here.

 Vault Room
    The walls here are made of a mixture of stone and steel.  The room
 is completely dominated by a large metal vault whose door is almost the
 entire east wall.  Light illuminates this room, but you can't tell
 where it is coming from.  You can exit back to the long tunnel to the
 west.  You can enter the open vault door to the east.
    You see a big pan, a handwritten letter, and a typed letter here.

>go east
 Inside the Vault
    You are inside the vault.  The interior is about 10 x 10 feet, and
 all of the walls are made of dull grey steel.  You are very sure that
 nothing gets in or out of here when the vault door is closed.  The room
 appears bare for its size.  The vault door is to the west.

 This is a picture of a rather lusty-looking girl.  She must be very
 important to John, for him to have left the picture all mixed in with
 his important clothes like that.

 It appears to be a letter to John from his landlord telling him that
 his rent is going up.  The landlord sounds really greedy.

>examine book
 The book appears to be a diary, probably John's.  You're not going to

>y
 I don't know the word "y".

>read book
>read book
 The diary goes on about mundane personal matters, as diaries are wont
 to do, for quite some time.  A recurring theme seems to be how envious
 John is of people who are out "living life".  This puzzles you a bit,
 since John has done more crazy shit than any 10 people you know, with
 the possible exception of some of his psycho friends.

 The last couple of pages are really strange.  Apparently a few days
 ago, a hole opened in John's basement due to some water damage.  John
 has been having dreams about a "Fire Witch" and an "Ice Wizard" that
 live down this hole.  Here's the part that's really weird:  he thinks
 the dreams are real.  The ice wizard has imprisoned the fire witch, and
 John seems almost obsessed with freeing her.  He also talks about a
 "magic crystal card" that the fire witch gave him in a dream.  By
 rubbing it and saying the "magic word" necken-sway, John thinks that he
 can find the fire witch.  He talks about the card as if he actually has
 it in his possession.

 Obviously, years of heavy drinking have finally destroyed his mind.

 Goblin Room
    A small rather non-descript grey-stone cavern, this location does
 have one thing that makes it distinct:  an ornate archway leading
 south.  You can see the green crystal grotto to the north.
    There is a small, fierce guardian creature blocking your way to the
 south.  For some reason, the name 'goblin' pops into your head.

 Rushing at your feet, the goblin springs up and plants its shoulder
 into your stomach.  You painfully exhale all the air in your lungs.

>examine slip
 This small slip of paper holds some cryptic numbers.

 Rushing at your feet, the goblin springs up and plants its shoulder
 into your stomach.  As you double over in pain, it brings its knee up
 to smash you agonizingly in the face.

>attack goblin

 You ram the end of the board into the goblin's stomach, knocking it
 back several feet.  It looks hurt, but also more than a little furious.

 The goblin charges you, but you dodge aside.

>attack goblin
 (with the board)
 Holding the board like a baseball bat, you crack the goblin upside the
 head.  A lead key (previously unseen) flies from a chain around the
 goblin's neck.  While the goblin staggers back dazed, you take
 advantage of the situation and crack it in the head again.  This time
 you hear a sickening snap, and it drops to the ground dead.

 Pedestal Room
    This tiny room is made entirely of smooth, polished marble.  The
 only feature is a small marble pedestal in the southern portion of the
 room.  It appears to be firmly attached to the floor, or perhaps even a

    Sitting on the marble pedestal is a blue gem.

 You jump up and manage to get yourself at least partly into the hole.
 Pulling yourself into it, you start your long climb upwards.  You
 arrive in the hollow space out of breath.

 Hollow Space
    You are in a hollow space in between the walls of John's basement
 and the basement of one of his neighbors.  You are pretty cramped; you
 can barely fit in here.  It is also kind of dark, making you strain to
 see.  A dark, forbidding hole leads down, while you can return to the
 basement to the east.

>go east

    This is the basement of the apartment.  It is unfinished, and there

 large enough for you to fit through, and a set of stairs lead up.

 Living Room
    This is John's Living Room.  It is in its usual state of disarray,
 littered with junk (old copies of alternative newspapers, empty beer
 cans and bottles, dirty plates and glasses, and so on).  What a
 complete sloth!  To the north is the dining area.  There is a door
 leading outside to the south.  One set of stairs leads down to the
 basement, while another set leads upstairs.

>take junk
 You collect a handful of the junk, being careful not to touch anything
 too gross.  After gathering a small amount, you decide that nothing

    This is the basement of the apartment.  It is unfinished, and there

 large enough for you to fit through, and a set of stairs lead up.

 Hollow Space
    You are in a hollow space in between the walls of John's basement
 and the basement of one of his neighbors.  You are pretty cramped; you
 can barely fit in here.  It is also kind of dark, making you strain to
 see.  A dark, forbidding hole leads down, while you can return to the
 basement to the east.

>get red gem
 Taken.

>examine it
 This brilliant red gem seems to almost sparkle with a light of its own.
 It feels slightly warm to the touch.

>examine key
 The key is about two inches long and pretty thick for a key.  It is
 made of lead; this puzzles you as you would expect a key to be made of
 a stronger metal.

 see.  A dark, forbidding hole leads down, while you can return to the

>go down
 You carefully climb down the hole into darkness.  It goes straight down
 for at least 100 feet; luckily it is pretty rough and there are many
 handholds and places to position your feet.  Finally, you drop down
 into a room below.

 Red Crystal Grotto
    You have entered a grotto made entirely of some type of gleaming
 red-tinted crystal.  The crystal achieves the effect of appearing both
 natural and crafted.  Floors, ceiling, and walls all smoothly blend
 together.  The light from your flashlight is reflected back to you both
 from the direction you are pointing it and from other parts of the
 room, as gleams of red light seem to travel through the crystal to
 emerge elsewhere.

 The overall effect is quite beautiful.

 A hole in the ceiling, just reachable, leads up.  To the south, the
 crystal slowly turns into some type of grey stone and becomes a tunnel.

>go south
 Long Tunnel (1)
    This is a long tunnel leading north and south.  It has definitely
 been purposefully made, being tiled with crafted stone.  It looks like
 something that would have been created centuries ago.  You can see the
 Red Crystal Grotto to the north, and a side corridor leads off to the
 east.

>go south
 Long Tunnel (2)
    The long tunnel continues to lead north and south.  The same tiling
 is present here as in the rest of the tunnel.  A side corridor leads
 off to the west.

>go west
 Side Corridor
    This is a side corridor leading east and west.  It is somewhat
 smaller than the long tunnel, which lies to the east.  An archway lies
 to the west.  You can't put your finger on it, but you have a very
 strange feeling about that archway.

>inventory
 You have a flashlight (providing light), a crystal card, a small bag, a
 thin rod, a slip of paper, a blue gem, a lead key, and a red gem.  The
 flashlight seems to contain a battery.

>examine card
 This card is about the size of a playing card.  It is made out of some
 type of gleaming crystal, and is red in color.

>go west
 As you are moving through the archway, you hear a sound much like that
 of breaking glass, and you suddenly become very disoriented.  When you
 regain your senses a moment later, you are not where you thought you
 would be.

 Eastern Cell
    You are in a non-descript 10 x 10 room of tiled stone.  It has the
 appearances of a cell, but has no door.  There is an exit to the west.

 There is a loud and horrible rushing noise in your ears, and the room
 appears to be filling up with what you would describe as steam if it
 were not so very very cold.

 The archway is made of the same tiled stone as the rest of the

 Safe Room
    The side corridor ends in a compact little room with walls made of a
 mixture of stone and steel.  A dim light illuminates the area, but you
 can't tell where it's coming from.  A key-lock safe is set into the
 west wall.  The exit is through an archway to the east.

>examine safe
 The safe is set very firmly into the west wall, and has a keyhole in
 the very center of it.  From the looks of it, you can pretty much
 forget trying to open it if you don't have the key that fits that
 keyhole.

 The safe is closed.

>get key

>open safe
 Opening the safe reveals a glass bottle.

>get bottle

>examine bottle
 The bottle is about the right size to hold 2 liters of liquid.  There
 is no opening to the bottle; it appears to be sealed air-tight.  It
 does look fairly fragile though.  In the glass bottle you see a
 metallic ring.

>open bottle
 There is no opening to the glass bottle.  To open it you'll have to
 break it.

>examine ring
 The metallic ring is quite beautifully crafted, but you can't tell what
 kind of metal it is made out of.  It has an empty inset about right for
 a medium sized gemstone.  It is about your size.

>break bottle
 With a simple motion, you toss the bottle to the ground.  It shatters
 immediately, freeing the ring.  It also seems to have released some
 sort of noxious green gas which quickly fills the surrounding area.
 With a burning sensation in your throat and lungs, you expire.

 Devil's Task Room
    This small cavern appears completely natural.  The rock is very
 rough, and stalactites hang from the ceiling.  To the north there is an
 exit laced with gleaming blue crystal.  To the south, the cavern opens
 up into a much larger cavern, with a drop-off that leads down farther
 than you can see.  Spanning the vast emptiness of the large cavern is a
 bridge that appears to be made entirely of ice.  A chill comes from
 that direction.
    You see a pile of ash here.

>blow ash
 I don't know the word "blow".

>inventory
 You have a flashlight (providing light), a crystal card, a thin rod, a
 slip of paper, a blue gem, a lead key, a metallic ring (being worn), a
 board, a modem, and a old scroll.  The flashlight seems to contain a
 battery.

>go south
 Ice Bridge (1)
    You are on a narrow bridge made entirely of ice.  The footing is
 slick but you have managed to keep your balance so far.  You are colder
 than you can ever remember being; the bridge seems to be drawing your
 life right out of you.  To the north the bridge ends in a small cavern.
 The bridge continues to the south for as far as your flashlight allows
 you to see.

 The ring (being worn) is providing you with a feeling of warmth.

>go south
 Ice Bridge (2)
    You are on a narrow bridge made entirely of ice.  The footing is
 slick but you have managed to keep your balance so far.  You are colder
 than you can ever remember being; the bridge seems to be drawing your
 life right out of you.  The bridge continues both to the north and
 south for as far as your flashlight allows you to see.

 The ring (being worn) is providing you with a feeling of warmth.

 Ice Bridge (3)
    You are on a narrow bridge made entirely of ice.  The footing is
 slick but you have managed to keep your balance so far.  You are colder
 than you can ever remember being; the bridge seems to be drawing your
 life right out of you.  The bridge continues to the north for as far as

 small cavern.  A dim reddish glow emerges from the cavern.

 The ring (being worn) is providing you with a feeling of warmth.

>go south
 Fire Room
    This small cavern is uncomfortably warm.  A bridge of ice spans a
 drop-off to the north.  There is a large exit to the south, but it is
 completely filled with a roaring wall of fire.  The entire room is lit
 by a bright reddish glow from the flames.

>get red gem
 You've already got your hands full.

>inventory
>examine fire
 You have a flashlight (providing light), a crystal card, a thin rod, a
 slip of paper, a blue gem, a lead key, a metallic ring (being worn), a

 Engulfed in Flames
    You are entirely engulfed by flames.  You can barely see through
 them.

 The ring (being worn) is providing you with a feeling of coolness.

 You can't go that way.

 Trophy Room
    This room looks like it belongs in a modern home instead of some
 underground cavern complex.  It is neatly square, about 20 feet wide by
 25 feet long, and the walls are paneled with cedar wood.  It looks
 unusual only due to its contents, and that the west wall is a wall of
 roaring flames.  The room is of a comfortable temperature though.
    An altar is on the northern wall, a desk lies against the eastern
 wall, a table sits against the southern wall, and in the middle of the
 room sits a large crystal obelisk.
    Sitting on the altar is a large black book.  Sitting on the wooden
 table is a black rod.  Sitting on the wooden desk is a tarot card and a
 small bowl.
    A grey old man in dark blue robes is here.  The Ice Wizard stops
 admiring his trophies and turns to face you as you enter.  "This used
 to be the Fire Witch's trophy room," he mumbles.  "Now she's a part of
 it."

 The Ice Wizard snaps his fingers, and the thin rod appears in his
 hands.  He fingers it lightly and places it within the folds of his
 robes.

>examine ice
 The Ice Wizard is a grey old man with a sinister look about him.  A
 sense of power radiates from him, and he frightens you.

 The Ice Wizard snaps his fingers, and the ring appears in his hands.
 He rolls it in his fingers and places it within the folds of his robes.

>examine witch
 You can barely make out the Fire Witch inside of the obelisk, but it is
 obvious that she is very beautiful.

 The Ice Wizard snaps his fingers, and the crystal card appears in his
 hands.  "Damned Witch," he mumbles.  "How did she get that to the
 mortal?"

>examine obelisk
 The large obelisk is made out of some type of purple crystal.  There
 seems to be something inside the obelisk, the unmoving form of a
 beautiful woman in crimson robes.

 "Didn't want you leaving me," the Ice Wizard mumbles as he rubs the
 crystal card and places it within the folds of his robes.

>say "necken-sway"
 Nothing happens.

 The Ice Wizard snaps his fingers, and the red gem appears in his hands.
 He rolls it in his fingers and places it within the folds of his robes.

>examine black book
 The large black book is open to page 569.

 "Well," mumbles the Ice Wizard.  "It appears you don't have anything
 else that I would be interested in.  Except perhaps your freeze-dried
 body."  And those are the last words you ever hear.

 [Your score just went up by 2 points.]
 The wizard's eyes open wide as you say the magic word.  There is a
 brief flash of light, and where the wizard once stood is a lovely woman
 in crimson robes.  Glancing at the purple crystal obelisk, you see the
 wizard's form trapped within.

 "You have done well," the Fire Witch purrs.  With a snap of her
 fingers, you both appear in John's living room.  With a flourish of her
 robes and some mumbled words, John appears as well.  He appears dazed
 and confused, and he gawks at the sight of the Fire Witch.  With raised
 eyebrows and a beautiful smile, the Fire Witch purrs "I hope you're
 ready for some unseasonably hot weather," and promptly disappears.

 It's a cold weekend in December of 1990, and it's been far too long
 since you have seen your friend John Baker!  But you've finally managed
 to take some time out of your schedule to drive to Columbus and spend
 some "quality time" together.  Quality time, of course, means that you
 and he are going to sample every bar that Ohio State University's High
 Street has to offer.

 John was to meet you at a favorite pizza and beer spot to start off the
 evening, but he hasn't showed up.  John's always been rather
 spontaneous (read that as 'erratic'), so you think he'll show up
 eventually.  But as the night wears on and you tire of downing beers by
 yourself, you decide to drive to his place and see if he's left a note
 or something for you there.

 You find his front door unlocked and John nowhere to be found.  Pretty
 tired from your earlier drive, and also buzzing a bit from the beer you
 drank, you quickly doze off in the living room.

 It is now morning.  A terrible snow storm is raging outside, the worst
 you've ever seen.  You can't believe how much snow has piled up over
 the night.  You still haven't heard from John, and you seem to now be
 trapped in his apartment.

 Commandment #12592

 Oh ye who go about saying unto each:  "Hello sailor":
 Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
 Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
 Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
 Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
 Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
 Unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
 Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

 "Didn't want you leaving me," the Ice Wizard mumbles as he rubs the
 crystal card and places it within the folds of his robes.
