 About this Game

 The Elysium Enigma is a relatively kind game.  It is possible to get
 killed or otherwise arrive at a less than ideal ending, but in such
 cases you can always UNDO.  It should not be possible to put the game
 into an unwinnable state.

 You may well finish the game, or even win the game, with fewer than
 the maximum points (it's possible to win the game with as few as 13
 points, or even 12 on a second or subsequent playthrough).  If you
 arrive at a less than satisfactory ending with a very low score, that
 means that there's a lot of the game you have missed; but if you
 arrive at a winning ending with less than the maximum score that means
 you have seen the essentials but missed out on some optional extras.

 It should be fairly easy to complete this game in the sense of
 reaching some ending, and not too hard to reach a winning ending
 within two hours; achieving the full score of 30 points could prove
 more of a challenge.

 To access in-game hints directly, type HINT (or HINTS).

 Conversation is important in this game, which uses the ASK/TELL
 method.  At any point in a conversation you can use the TOPICS
 commands to list topics it's currently worth asking or telling your
 interlocutor about.  You may find it makes for better gameplay,
 however, if you try asking and telling NPCs about the topics that
 naturally occur to you, rather than treating conversations as a kind
 of speech-maze to be navigated.

 For further details of conversational and other commands, see the "How
 to Play Interactive Fiction" and "Playing this Game" menus.

 To see this menu again type HELP or ABOUT (the commands are equivalent
 in this game).

 This post-comp release of The Elysium Enigma attempts to address some
 of the main criticisms expressed by the comp reviewers, insofar as it
 is possible to do that with relatively minor tweaks that don't affect
 the structure of the game.

 Automatic Typo Correction

 The Elysium Enigma incorporates Steve Breslin's Spelling Corrector
 extension, which can correct some typos for you.  For example, if you
 type:


 Then, depending on context, the game may be able to correct this to:


 And proceed to execute the appropriate command.  This can be very
 useful in correcting minor errors automatically, rather than
 presenting you with a parser error and the need to retype a command,
 but there are two things you should note about this feature:

 (1) This library extension (rightly) takes a conservative approach to
 typo-correction, making only those corrections that are very likely to
 be correct, rather than risking speculative corrections that were not
 what the player intended.  This means that you may often find that the
 game does not correct a typo that looks obvious to you.  In such a
 case the reason is probably that the correction was not so obvious to
 the algorithm used by the spelling corrector; it's far better not to
 have the game "correct" your input to something you didn't intend and
 execute a command you didn't want.

 (2) For this reason, no automatic typo correction occurs in
 conversational commands (like ASK and TELL) and other such commands
 where any input is potentially valid.  For example, you can ask an NPC
 about anything you like, so it would be highly annoying to have:


 "corrected" to:


 Which might happen if "move" but not "love" is one of the words
 defined in the game's dictionary.

 (3) Should you find this typo-correction feature more of a hindrance
 than a help you can disable it with the TYPO OFF command.  Use TYPO ON
 command to turn it back on (you can also use the bare TYPO command to
 toggle the two states).

 Abort on/off (for multiple commands)

 Sometimes when you enter multiple commands on a single command line,
 the failure of one of the earlier commands renders the subsequent ones
 problematic or at least redundant.  For example, suppose there's a
 troll who won't let you go north, but you enter two NORTH commands in
 succession:


 The ugly troll blocks your path with a growl.

 The ugly troll blocks your path with a growl.

 The second message is really superfluous, since you probably didn't
 mean to try to go north twice from your present location, but rather
 to go north then go north again.

 In other situations, this could be even more troubling.  Suppose you
 enter a command line like:


 If the first command fails, but travel east from your current location
 is possible, you could end up doing something quite different from
 what you intended.

 To avoid this problem The Elysium Enigma cancels any subsequent
 commands on a command line if one of the commands fails.  It does not
 however cancel the iteration of a command.  So, for example, if you
 entered the command:


 And DROP TROUSERS failed halfway through the list of items to be
 dropped ("You'd better not drop your trousers in public!"), the DROP
 command would continue through the list of other items that might be
 dropped, but the NORTH command would be cancelled (since a previous
 command had failed).

 In most cases this behaviour will probably give better results than
 the normal library behaviour, but if you don't like it you can turn it
 off with the ABORT OFF command; all commands on the command line will
 then be executed even if one fails.  You can also turn it on again
 with an ABORT ON command, or toggle between settings with a simple
 ABORT command.

 "There, sir," the shuttle pilot points to a tiny collection of
 buildings nestling next to the river, "That's the town."

 "That's the town!" you cry, "Are you sure, sublieutenant?"

 "Quite sure, sir," the pilot assures you as she checks her
 navigational instruments, "Which means our designated landing zone
 should be just the other side of that forest."

 You let out a deep sigh as the shuttle carries out its final descent
 over the farmland and turns to sweep over the multi-coloured trees.
 It's not that you have any objection to walking per se, indeed the
 prospect of a good brisk walk on a sunny morning is rather appealing
 after four days cooped up in a frigate; it's being obliged to walk to
 this meeting just to avoid upsetting the natives' technophobic
 sensibilities that irritates you.

 The pilot now has the shuttle under manual control; she kills the
 speed and drops the craft into a hollow just north of the forest.  As
 she finally cuts the engines she turns to you with a brisk smile.
 "Right, here we are, sir," she announces cheerfully.  Pointing to the
 south she adds, "The town should be about a quarter of an hour's walk
 that way.  I think I spotted a path running more or less straight
 through the forest, so you shouldn't have any difficulty finding it."

 "Thanks," you reply laconically.  You let out another sigh; but at
 least this shouldn't take more than a couple of hours, then you'll be
 away from this wretched backwater - hopefully for good.

 Inside the Shuttle (sitting on the passenger seat)
 The inside of the shuttle is not exactly spacious; there's room for
 the pilot and three passengers, one beside the pilot and two behind.
 The seats are comfortable enough, but otherwise it's all pretty basic.
 There's not much in front of you except the forward window; the pilot
 has a bank of instruments.

 The pilot is sitting next to you; she's turned to face you, as if
 waiting for you to speak.

>typo off
 Typo correction disabled.

>ask pilot about town
 "What do you know about this place?" you ask her.

 "Only what I've heard, sir," she replies, "I've never been here
 before.  It does have quite an odd reputation, though, as I'm sure you
 know.  Something went horribly wrong in the past, but no-one wants to
 talk about it.  And now the natives refuse to use any technology
 that's much more advanced than the wheel."

>ask pilot about natives
 As you start your question the pilot lets out a wide yawn.

>ask pilot about mission
 "So, sublieutenant, what do you think about..." you begin.

 "Perhaps we should discuss that some other time, sir," the pilot
 suggests, "right now you have a job to do."

>ask pilot about meeting
 "About meetings..." you begin.

 "What about meetings, sir?" she replies warily.

 "Well..." you start, but something in her manner makes you trail off
 as you realize your question wasn't all that important after all.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing, and are wearing a purple belt and a white
 uniform.  The purple belt contains a drik.  Your left pocket contains
 an ID card.  Your right pocket contains a crumpled piece of paper.

>read paper
 (first taking the crumpled piece of paper from your right pocket)
 After the standard preamble, it goes on:

 "I'm sorry to dump this on you, but the Federation crisis means that
 we've had to pull all but skeleton resources out of this sector, and
 you're the nearest Legion officer to hand.  As a result, we need you
 to include Elysium in your rounds.  It's a sensitive planet - probably
 one of the most sensitive settlements in the Empire - but provided you
 go straight in and straight out and stick strictly to these orders you
 shouldn't have any problems.

 The purpose of your visit is simply to remind the local leadership
 that they are still part of the Empire and that we are still keeping
 tabs on them; quite literally, you're just there to 'show the flag'.
 To do this you'll need to make your way to the Legion office in what
 passes for the settlement's capital, and, once there, hoist the
 imperial flag above the building to show the local Elders that you're
 open for business.  One or more of them should then come to call on
 you within the hour.  When they do, be as diplomatic and courteous as
 possible, but otherwise keep the conversation to a minimum.  Inform
 them in the simplest possible terms of the nature of the Federation
 crisis, emphasising that the Empire will continue to guard them from
 intrusion. Ask them if they have anything they want to raise with you.
 Almost certainly they won't, apart from their standard grumbles about
 imperial interference.  Say as little as possible in reply beyond
 promising to pass their comments on.  Once you have completed this
 conversation get out of there as quickly as you can.

 The most important thing to understand about the Elysians is that they
 have made a religion of technophobia.  Their idea of a paradisal
 society is a pre-industrial society, so try not to flaunt any
 technology you bring with you; the less the settlers see of any
 thirtieth-century technology, the better you'll get on with them.

 Finally, I cannot stress too strongly that you should on no account
 get involved in any of the internal affairs of Elysium, and that you
 should if at all possible avoid any contact with any of the settlers
 apart from the Elders who come to meet you.  Terrible mistakes have
 been made on Elysium in the past, and any problems that come up in the
 present must be left to officers with a deep understanding of the
 situation there, which does not include you.  So, get in, keep the
 chat nice and short, and get straight out again.

 I look forward to receiving your report in due course.
 Subtribune G.F.  Booker (C/O Sect PP12, ISL)
 13-Sep-2980.

 [Auth Code: ISL-GF-PPn342]"

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)
 (If you'd prefer not to be notified about score changes in the future,
 type NOTIFY OFF.)

>ask pilot about flag
 "Where do you suppose I'll find this imperial flag I'm meant to be
 hoisting?" you wonder.

 "It'll be in the Legion building somewhere, sir," she assures you,
 "I'm sure you won't have any trouble finding it."

>ask pilot about elders
 You ask your question about the Elders, but the pilot doesn't seem to
 have anything interesting to say on the subject right now.

>ask pilot about id
 She seems momentarily distracted, and apparently doesn't hear you.

>examine id
 (first taking your ID card from your left pocket)
 Your ID card is a rectangle of white data-plastic about two
 centimetres wide by four long.  It bears a small photograph of you and
 identifies you as Praefect Andrew Holt of the Imperial Sovereign
 Legion.

>put id in left pocket
 Done.

>examine uniform
 (your uniform)
 Your uniform comprises a white tunic and matching white trousers.  On
 the left breast of the tunic is emblazoned a purple eagle, and though
 you can't see them without the aid of a mirror, you know that there's
 a purple patch on each collar, bearing your insignia of rank.  Below
 your belt the tunic has a pair of pockets.  Your left pocket contains
 an ID card.

>examine belt
 It's a standard issue Sovereign Legion uniform belt, with a gold belt
 buckle at the front.  It contains a drik.

>examine drik
 You have no idea where the name "drik" came from; so far as you know
 that's what it's been called for centuries.  The drik is a
 multipurpose device that's issued to all Legion officers as standard.
 Despite the natives' dislike of modern technology, this is one item
 you're not prepared to go without - it was drummed into you at the
 Legion Training School that a Legion Officer's drik is an integral
 part of his uniform, never to be lost or surrendered under any
 circumstances.

 The drik is vaguely dagger-shaped, with a black handle, on which are
 four small coloured studs, and a slightly longer "blade", a flat
 plastimetal strip that is not actually sharp enough to cut anything.

 The drik has one further function in addition to that provided by its
 four studs: although you're unlikely to encounter much strange
 technology on Elysium, if you do encounter something you're suspicious
 of, pointing your drik at it may reveal something about its function.

 "I hope this isn't going to take too long, sir," the pilot remarks,
 "The sooner we're out of here the happier I shall be!"

>examine studs
 There are four small studs round the base of the handle: one red, one
 yellow, one green, and one blue.

>ask her about drik'
 (the pilot)
 "Sublieutenant, I've been meaning to ask you about..." you begin.

 "Beg pardon, sir, but I thought we were both anxious to get out of
 here, sir," she interrupts you, "So can we talk about that on the way
 back to the ship once you've finished here?"

 "Okay," you nod.

>exit shuttle
 (first standing up)
 "Goodbye, sir," the pilot calls after you.

 You clamber out of the shuttle.

 Hollow
 You step out of the shuttle and feel the soil of Elysium pressing
 against your boots.  It feels good to be back on the surface of a
 planet once more, and at first glance this planet looks welcoming
 enough.  The early autumn air is comfortably warm, and smells fresh,
 if a little earthy, while the grass underfoot looks springy and green.
 But what really strikes you is how quiet it is.

 Looking around, you speculate that your shuttle has just landed in
 what was originally an impact crater.  To the west the ground rises
 quite sharply - more sharply than you care to climb - but there seems
 to be a usable trail running north and south, and from what the pilot
 said, it's the southern one you want.

 Your shuttle rests in the middle of the hollow.

>examine all studs
 There are four small studs round the base of the handle: one red, one
 yellow, one green, and one blue.

>examine red stud
 The red stud is quite plain.

>push red stud
 Pushing the red button will send an emergency distress signal which
 will bring a squad of marines rushing to your rescue.  If there isn't
 actually an emergency you'll be in real trouble for wasting their
 time.  If there is a real emergency the marines can't possibly get
 here in time, since they'd need to come down in a shuttle from the
 orbiting frigate.  So either way, you may as well leave that stud
 alone.

 Don't forget, if you just want to test something with your drik, just
 point the drik at it.

>push yellow stud
 Do you really want to shoot yourself in the foot?  You should only
 press the yellow stud when the drik is aimed at someone you want to
 stun.

>push green stud
 The drik lights up.

>again
 The drik goes dark.

>push blue stud
 A short beep indicates that you have opened a communications link with
 your pilot.

 "Hello, do you read me?" you ask.

 "I read you, praefect," the pilot's voice replies.

 (You could ask her about herself, Elysium, or the Federation crisis,
 or tell her about yourself.)

>ask pilot about crisis
 "So, what do you make of this Federation business, sublieutenant?" you
 ask her, "Will it be war do you think?"

 "I don't know, sir." she replies, "But if it is, at least we're well
 out of it here!"

>ask pilot about elysium
 "Do you know anything else about Elysium, sublieutenant?" you ask.

 "I thought the Sovereign Legion was meant to be the experts on that
 kind of thing, sir," she replies pertly.

>pilot, bye
 "Over and out," you say.

 "Over and out, sir," she confirms, just before the comms link goes
 dead.

>go south
 Dirt Track
 You leave the hollow and follow the dirt track down a ridge onto level
 ground, where it runs on south between untended fields towards the
 forest.  This area looks like it may have been farmland once, but now
 the fields are reverting to wilderness, and even the track is starting
 to become overgrown.  As you pause to take stock of your surroundings,
 you wonder why the land has been allowed to go to waste.

>examine field
 You see no field here.

>examine fields
 The fields on either side of the track are so overgrown as to be
 impenetrable.  They look as if they may once have been valuable arable
 land, but now they are rapidly reverting to wilderness.

>go south
 You set off down the track and after a few minutes' walk you find
 yourself deep in the heart of the forest.

 Heart of the Forest
 You stop to look round and try to reassure yourself that you're still
 on the path the pilot told you about.  You can't see any side trails
 (though there may be the odd gap in the trees through which you could
 leave the main path) so it's hard to see how you could have gone
 wrong; and yet it doesn't quite feel right - but perhaps that's just
 because you find it so disconcerting being forced to walk through a
 forest for a routine meeting with local officialdom.

 Although the path has been straight enough so far, a short way ahead
 it starts to twist.

>follow path
 Which way do you want to go: north or south?

>go south
 The path twists and turns through the trees, but broadly continues
 south.

 Edge of the Forest
 The track becomes straighter and wider here as the trees become
 sparser.  They are now so widely spaced that you could easily wander
 among them to east and west, and since they continue to thin out to
 the south you surmise that you must be coming to the edge of the
 forest.

 While you are taking stock of your surroundings, you hear a sudden
 rustling in the undergrowth.  Your heart misses a beat as you see a
 figure emerge from the trees and walk rapidly towards you.  Under the
 dirt and the tattered rags you recognize it as a young woman, and you
 wonder if this is how all the settlers live.

 "Excuse me!" she cries, as she hurries up to you, "You're an
 offworlder, aren't you?  From the Empire?"

 (You could say yes, or ask her who she is.)

>exits on
 The list of exits will now be shown in both the status line and in
 each room description.

>yes
 "Yes, that's right," you nod, "Why, is there a problem?"

 "Can't you see for yourself?" she demands, "As you can see, my clothes
 are falling to rags, and I'm starving!  I'm an outcast - no one from
 round here will help me, and I daren't be caught stealing.  But you're
 an offworlder - so maybe - please, can you try to find me some new
 clothes and something to eat?"

 (You could say yes or no, refuse politely, offer to get help, or ask
 her about food or clothes.)

>refuse politely
 "Look, I'd like to help, but I really can't," you tell her, "I have my
 orders you see - I'm not even meant to be talking with you, let alone
 getting involved.  Besides, I won't be here more than an hour or so."

 "Oh, but it won't take you more than an hour or two to find me
 something," she assures you, "The town isn't far away, and I'm sure
 you can find something for me there."

>refuse politely
 That command can't be used right now.

>ask her about her
 "So, who are you?" you ask.

 "I'm Leela," she tells you.

>topics
 You could ask her about herself, the town, or Elysium.

>ask her about exile
 "So, what can you tell me about...  " you begin.

 "Well," she interrupts, "I think you should tell me something about
 yourself before you ask me anything else."

>ask her about food
 "Where am I meant to get food from?" you ask.

 "Like I said, the town's the best bet," she reminds you.

>ask her about town
 "What will I find in the town?" you wonder.

 "Not much," she shrugs, "No one actually lives there; it's just for
 meetings and markets.  But that means things get stored there, so you
 should be able to find me some food and clothes, without anyone there
 to stop you."

>ask her about elysium
 "What can you tell me about this world?" you ask her.

 "Well, it's the only world I know, so I wouldn't know what to compare
 it with," she begins, a little hesitantly.

>examine woman
 She's a young woman of about twenty standard Earth years of age.
 She's smeared in dirt and her long dark hair flops lank and limp over
 her shoulders.  She looks like she might be quite pretty if she had a
 good wash, but right now she's a mess.

 Leela is wearing some smelly rags.

>ask leela why she was cast out
 The story doesn't understand that command.  Please use ASK ACTOR ABOUT
 TOPIC (or just A TOPIC).

>ask her about outcast
 "What happened to you?  Why are you wandering around half-naked in the
 forest?" you want to know.

 "I asked too many questions," she replied, "the Elders don't like you
 asking too many questions, so when I asked one too many they decided I
 wasn't fit for Elysian society - so now I'm an outcast."

>ask her about questions
 "What sort of questions did you ask that upset the Elders so much?"
 you wonder.

 "Oh, all sorts," she replies, "Why there are so many restrictions, why
 they're so scared of change, why our ancestors came here, what
 happened between Elysium and the Empire, why we've stayed such a small
 community, why I can't choose my own husband... you name it, I've
 probably asked it!"

>Leela, follow me.
 "Follow me," you tell her.

 "Well - I can't follow you into town," she replies dubiously, "I
 daren't be seen there!"

>go north
 "No, no!"  Leela stops you, "You need to go into town to find me some
 new clothes and something to eat!  The town isn't that way, it's that
 way!" she points to the south.

>go south
 Leela waves to you, then turns and walks away, deeper into the forest.

 Hillside above the Town
 Emerging from the forest you catch sight of the pathetic cluster of
 buildings at the foot of the slope, and realize that this must be the
 town where you're meant to be meeting with the Elders; on any other
 world it wouldn't even rate as a hamlet.  The centre of the town lies
 straight down the slope to the south. Beyond the western edge of the
 hillside you catch a glimpse of the river that flows on past the town,
 while at your back is the forest.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West, Northwest

>examine buildings
 The collection of buildings spread out below is apparently the nearest
 approximation to a town anywhere on the planet, though on any other
 world it would hardly even rate as a hamlet.

>examine river
 The river flows down from the forest and runs along the western edge
 of the town, before disappearing across the distant fields to the
 south.

>go south
 You walk down the slope into the centre of the town.

 Town Centre
 The centre of Elysium's sole town looks no more impressive than it did
 from a distance.  The main street, running east-west, is simply the
 baked mud space between buildings you could count on your fingers.
 The track you've just walked down continues south between a neat white
 building (to the east) and a large barn (to the west).  Across the
 street from the barn is an enclosed area that has the look of a
 primitive market, while opposite the single-storey white building a
 large wooden hall has shed most of its red paint.  Overall this place
 is more like your idea of some frontier trading post than a planetary
 capital, and it seems totally deserted.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Northwest

>put paper in right pocket
 Done.

>put drik in pocket
 Which pocket do you mean, your right pocket, or your left pocket?

>right
 (first taking the drik from the purple belt)
 It would fit better in your belt.

>examine white building
 It's a small, square, single-storey flat-roofed building, with a
 flagpole jutting up from the roof.

>go east
 East End of Town
 The north side of the street is occupied by a large wooden hall.  On
 the south side is a neat single-storey white building (directly south)
 next to a two-storey green house (to the southeast).  The street
 continues eastwards but quickly peters out into a narrow farmtrack as
 it leaves the town, while to the west it runs back towards the town
 centre.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Southeast

>go south
 (first trying to open the purple door)
 The purple door seems to be locked.

>examine purple door
 Affixed to the purple door is a neatly hand-painted sign, under which
 is a small vertical slot.  It's closed.

>read sign
>examine sign
 The sign reads "Imperial Sovereign Legion Office, Elysium" in neat
 gold lettering.

 The sign reads "Imperial Sovereign Legion Office, Elysium" in neat

 Sovereign Legion Office
 You look round the clean, white office with a flood of relief, feeling
 that you are at last back in civilization.  Everything here looks
 clean and neat and Legion-fashion.  A large white desk, with a
 standard built-in console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted
 on the east wall.  Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather
 chair, while a pair of smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are
 positioned in front of the desk, presumably for the benefit of
 visitors.  The main door is next to the window overlooking the street
 to the north, while a staircase runs up against the south wall to a
 hatch in the ceiling.  A second door is set in the east wall, to the
 left of the eagle, while a large portrait of the Emperor hangs
 opposite.

 Obvious exits: North, East, Up

>examine eagle
 (the large golden eagle)
 It's a large heraldic eagle, of the same pattern as the one on your
 tunic, that represents the might of the Empire and the authority of
 the Aquila dynasty who rule it.

>close main door
 The door closes with a sharp click, indicating that it has relocked
 itself.

>examine hatch
 It's a square hatch, set in the ceiling.  It's closed.  It's currently
 locked.

>unlock hatc
 The word "hatc" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points
 out an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your
 next command.)

>unlock hatch
 Unlocked.

>go up
 (first opening the hatch)

 Roof
 Although the roof is not that high up, it affords you a reasonably
 good view over the town.  A low parapet runs round the edge of the
 roof, at one end of which is a tall white flagpole with a white locker
 at its base.  At the far end is an array of solar panels, while in
 between a narrow staircase leads back down through an open hatch.

 Sovereign Legion Office
 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your
 idea of civilization.  A large white desk, with a standard built-in
 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of

 Obvious exits: North, East, Up

>examine desk
 The desk is the familiar model you've seen in many Legion offices,
 with a built-in console and a single shallow drawer.

>examine console
 It's a standard model console, with a 50 cm screen and a datatab slot.
 On an ordinary world it would be connected to the planet-wide datanet,
 but you doubt that such a thing exists on Elysium.

>examine slot
 It's about 8mm long.

>examine portrait
 The portrait provides evidence that even on this insignificant world
 someone is taking regular care of the Legion office, since it's a
 portrait of Charles V, who ascended the throne only a few months ago.
 He's a man of about thirty, trying to look formal despite the twinkle
 in his eye, dressed in the traditional gold-trimmed purple cloak and
 golden laurel-wreath crown of his office.

>open drawer
 Opening the drawer reveals a purple datatab and a pair of safety pins.

>look behind portrait
 You see nothing unusual behind the portrait of the Emperor.

>point drik at eagle
 Which eagle do you mean, the eagle on your tunic, or the eagle on the
 wall?

>wall
 Okay, you point the drik at the large golden eagle.

>point drik at console
 A stream of coloured dots runs along the blade of the drik and
 disappears into the handle; but this is just what you'd expect for the
 console.

>point drik at me
 Okay, you point the drik at yourself.

>point drik at portrait

 (first taking the crumpled piece of paper from your right pocket)
 After the standard preamble, it goes on:

 "I'm sorry to dump this on you, but the Federation crisis means that
 we've had to pull all but skeleton resources out of this sector, and
 you're the nearest Legion officer to hand.  As a result, we need you
 to include Elysium in your rounds.  It's a sensitive planet - probably
 one of the most sensitive settlements in the Empire - but provided you
 go straight in and straight out and stick strictly to these orders you
 shouldn't have any problems.

 The purpose of your visit is simply to remind the local leadership
 that they are still part of the Empire and that we are still keeping
 tabs on them; quite literally, you're just there to 'show the flag'.
 To do this you'll need to make your way to the Legion office in what
 passes for the settlement's capital, and, once there, hoist the
 imperial flag above the building to show the local Elders that you're
 open for business.  One or more of them should then come to call on
 you within the hour.  When they do, be as diplomatic and courteous as
 possible, but otherwise keep the conversation to a minimum.  Inform
 them in the simplest possible terms of the nature of the Federation
 crisis, emphasising that the Empire will continue to guard them from
 intrusion. Ask them if they have anything they want to raise with you.
 Almost certainly they won't, apart from their standard grumbles about
 imperial interference.  Say as little as possible in reply beyond
 promising to pass their comments on.  Once you have completed this
 conversation get out of there as quickly as you can.

 The most important thing to understand about the Elysians is that they
 have made a religion of technophobia.  Their idea of a paradisal
 society is a pre-industrial society, so try not to flaunt any
 technology you bring with you; the less the settlers see of any
 thirtieth-century technology, the better you'll get on with them.

 Finally, I cannot stress too strongly that you should on no account
 get involved in any of the internal affairs of Elysium, and that you
 should if at all possible avoid any contact with any of the settlers
 apart from the Elders who come to meet you.  Terrible mistakes have
 been made on Elysium in the past, and any problems that come up in the
 present must be left to officers with a deep understanding of the
 situation there, which does not include you.  So, get in, keep the
 chat nice and short, and get straight out again.

 I look forward to receiving your report in due course.
 Subtribune G.F.  Booker (C/O Sect PP12, ISL)

 [Auth Code: ISL-GF-PPn342]"

>enter ISL-GF-PPn342
 (on the console)
 The screen displays: "Authorization Code Correct!  Access permitted.
 "

 The console screen displays a recent report on the status of Elysium.

 The summary page tells you that the current population of the planet
 is a mere 11,345 (as of the latest count, last year), and that Elysium
 has the lowest GDP per head of any planet of the Empire by a very long
 way.  The population apparently peaked at around fifteen thousand
 about a century ago and has been declining slowly ever since (there's
 a link to a lengthy social-scientific analysis of this, but you're
 content with the summary, which suggests that the society has simply
 become too stagnant).  The prognosis is that within a century or two
 Elysian society will have become non-viable and the Empire will be
 able (and obliged) to move in with a fresh bunch of settlers and make
 something of the world (though this is not to be communicated to any
 of the current inhabitants) but in the meanwhile, the Elysians are to
 be left alone to decay as they wish, since there must be no repetition
 of past tragedies (there's a link to a file explaining this in more
 detail, but it turns out you don't have the security clearance to read
 it).  The summary ends with an instruction to all imperial personnel
 operating on Elysium to keep contact and interference to the bare
 minimum required to monitor the status of Elysian society and ensure
 no outside interference.

 As you remove the purple datatab, the console screen goes blank.

 Bedroom
 This small bedroom is presumably provided in case a visiting Legion
 officer needs to stay overnight, but there's not much here apart from
 a single bed hard against the wall, a small wardrobe, and a small
 chest of drawers.  There's a door to the west back into the office,
 and a tiny bathroom to the south.

 Obvious exits: South, West

>open wardrobe
 Inside the wardrobe is a small domestic robot.

>look under chest
>examine robot
 You see nothing unusual under the chest of drawers.

 It's one of those small cylindrical jobs, basic but robust.
 Presumably it carries out the routine maintenance and cleaning in this
 building.  There's a yellow sticker attached to it.  It's currently
 plugged into the wall, charging.

>look under wardrobe
 You see nothing unusual under the wardrobe.

 It strikes you that you should really hurry up and get that flag
 hoisted over the Legion Building, like your orders said.

>read sticker
 The sticker reads, "Last maintenance check 14-Mar-80: Fixed glitch in
 laundry program."  Under the notation is a Harcourt Research Logo.

>examine logo
 The logo depicts a pair of spaceships orbiting a sun in a manner that
 resembles a pair of electrons orbiting an atomic nucleus.  The
 intention is presumably to convey that Harcourt Research's
 technological competence encompasses all scales.

 roof, at one end of which is a tall white flagpole with a white locker
 at its base.  At the far end is an array of solar panels, while in
 between a narrow staircase leads back down through an open hatch.

 Obvious exits: Down

>examine panels
 The array of four solar panels at the east end of the roof is arranged
 to catch as much sunlight as possible during the course of the day.
 You suspect that they convert the sun's energy into electricity using
 photovoltaic cells, and that the power is then stored in batteries.
 These panels wouldn't give enough power for continuous use all the
 year round, but they probably generate enough for the few days a year
 on which this building is actually used.

 It's just an ordinary plain pillowcase of the sort used to put pillows
 in.  It's freshly laundered and neatly folded.

 again.

>fold sheet
 You fold the plain white sheet.

>examine object
 You almost missed it, it's so tiny.  It's round and black and smaller

 West End of Town
 The muddy street from the centre of the town to the east ends at a

 tumbledown shacks, while on the north side of the street is a rough
 enclosed area that looks like it's probably some sort of market.
 Behind the market the land climbs up towards the distant forest.

 (You could ask her about herself, or the Federation crisis, or tell
 her about yourself, Leela, the robot, the town, or the bug.)

>tell pilot about bug
 "I found a tiny black bug hidden in a pillowcase in the Legion
 Office," you tell her.

 "Great galloping galaxies, who could have done that, sir?" she
 wonders.

 "I don't know, sublieutenant" you reply, "But it's certainly worrying.
 No one on this planet is meant to have anything like that level of
 technology."

 "Then it must have been planted there by someone from offworld, sir,"
 she deduces.

 "That's just what I was thinking, sublieutenant," you agree, "and I've
 just thought of something else.  The domestic robot in the bedroom has
 got a Harcourt Research maintenance sticker on it, so we know a
 Harcourt Research engineer has been in the building recently."

 "I see your point, sir," she acknowledges.

>ask pilot about harcourt
 "What do you think of Harcourt Research, sublieutenant?" you ask.

 "From what point of view, sir?" she asks, "They make a lot of decent
 products, but as a corporation they stink, as I'm sure I have no need
 to tell you!  I mean, Senator Harcourt has been arrested for treason!"

>ask pilot about senator
 "What was that, sir?" she asks, "I'm afraid I didn't quite copy."

>ask pilot about senator harcourt
 "Maybe now isn't the best time to discuss that, sir," she suggests.

>ask pilot about harcourt
 "As you say, sublieutenant, Senator Harcourt's been arrested for
 treason," you muse, "Among other things, his Federation links are
 under the microscope.  I wonder - his massive multiplanetary
 conglomerate had a reputation for swallowing things even before the
 good Senator got himself arrested; could Harcourt Research have had
 designs on Elysium?"

 "I hardly see how, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin protests, "Anywhere that
 offered fewer prospects for a hi-tech company like Harcourt Research
 would be impossible to imagine!"

>ask pilot about harcourt
 "Obviously Harcourt Research wouldn't find much of a market on
 Elysium, and obviously they wouldn't find much use for native labour
 either, but apart from the tiny area of cultivated land, there's a
 whole unexploited world out there," you point out, "Could it have
 something they want?  Some valuable raw material perhaps?"

 "With respect, sir, aren't you extrapolating rather wildly beyond the
 evidence?"  Sublieutenant Soolin points out.

>ask pilot about evidence
 Her reply is lost in a burst of static.

>ask pilot about harcourt
 It's already plain enough that she's not that impressed by your
 speculations about Harcourt Research, so there's no point repeating
 them.

 be used for a market, both from the rubbish that's been left lying
 around, and the impress in the muddy ground of what might be stalls or
 tables.  A small shed stands near the centre of the area, with a
 trestle table off to one side.  Gaps in the fence allow egress to the
 south and southeast, as well as north along the bank of the river.

 On the trestle table are a carrot and a parsnip.

 A large black dog is sniffing around, scavenging for food.

 Obvious exits: North, South, Southeast, In The dog charges up to you
 and starts snapping at your heels.

>take food
 parsnip: The dog growls at you so fiercely as your hand approaches the
 parsnip that you decide you'd better leave it alone.

 carrot: The dog growls at you so fiercely as your hand approaches the
 carrot that you decide you'd better leave it alone.

>examine dog
 It's an ugly black mongrel with fierce-looking teeth.  He's scavenging
 for food.

 The dog sniffs round the table.

>examine shed
 The small wooden shed might be for storage, or it might be some sort
 of stall.  Either way it's a crude wooden structure with a plain
 wooden door.

 The dog leaps up on the table and snatches the parsnip.  Then it drops
 back down and starts chewing it.

>stun dog

 (first taking the drik from the purple belt)
 The dog lets out a startled whine, then topples over with legs
 splaying.  His legs give a final couple of twitches, and then he lies
 still.

>take parsnip
 You see no parsnip here.

 Inside the hut
 Two people standing inside this tiny hut would be cramped; three would
 be excessively intimate.  It is almost completely bare apart from a
 small hook fixed to the west wall.

 A folded piece of cloth lies on the floor of the hut.

 West End of Town
 The muddy street from the centre of the town to the east ends at a
 ramshackle wooden bridge that has unfortunately fallen into a terminal
 state of disrepair, leaving no other means of crossing the river.  A
 large wooden barn stands immediately to the south, next to a pair of
 tumbledown shacks, while on the north side of the street is a rough
 enclosed area that looks like it's probably some sort of market.

 The blue stud on your drik starts flashing, indicating that someone is

>push blue stud
 A short beep indicates that you have opened a communications link with
 your pilot.

 "Hello, sir, it's Sublieutenant Soolin," your pilot announces.  "I've
 been thinking about that bug you found," she tells you, "I've looked
 up the data on the range of that kind of device, and I've been
 checking it against the plans of the town on our onboard datastore.  I
 reckon the best place for someone to have hidden the receiver would be
 high up in the barn."

 (You could thank her, ask her about herself, or the Federation crisis,
 or tell her about yourself, Leela, the robot, or the town.)

>thank her
 "Thank you, sublieutenant, that's useful," you reply.  "I'll follow it
 up."

 "We only aim to serve, sir," she replies pertly.

>soolin, bye
 "Over and out," you say.

 "Over and out, sir," she confirms, just before the comms link goes
 dead.

 You're not all that familiar with freshly-caught fish; the only trout
 you have encountered before have been the cooked variety, served up in
 restaurants and officers' messes, but from what you recall of the
 trout you've eaten, you think this fish is probably a trout.  It looks
 a decent enough specimen, anyway.

 Loft
 The loft is little more than a storage platform running the width of
 the barn, about three metres deep, in the space under the rafters.  At
 the eastern end of the platform a large wooden box is fixed to the

 You carefully choose a spot between the rafters so as not to risk
 bumping your head, and then jump.  As your head comes level with the
 rafters, you catch a brief glimpse of a lump on the southernmost one,
 but you fall back down to the floor before you can get a decent look
 at it.

>examine cube
 The small black cube looks like it's made of some kind of shiny

 Whatever it is, it looks more like the product of offworld technology
 than something that belongs on Elysium.

>eat cube
 It's obviously inedible.

>push blue
 A short beep indicates that you have opened a communications link with

 "Hello, do you read me?" you ask.

 "I read you, praefect," the pilot's voice replies.

 (You could ask her about herself, or the Federation crisis, or tell
 her about yourself, Leela, the robot, the town, or the small black
 cube.)

>tell pilot about cube
 "I found a small black cube in the barn in town," you tell her, "It
 looks far too advanced for Elysian technology."

 "Try testing it with your drik, sir," she suggests.

>point drik at cube
 The drik blade emits a short series of rapid amber flashes, confirming
 your suspicions: the cube is some sort of receiving device.

>tell pilot about cube
 "That black cube I told you about," you tell her, "I've tested it with

 planted a receiving device in the town, where's the transmitter?"

>tell pilot about bug

 The old man is standing out in the street.

 Obvious exits: North, East, Up

 The old man enters the Sovereign Legion Office.  "I'm Petroc, Chief
 Elder of Elysium," the old man introduces himself, "I saw your flag
 flying, so I came - but you look even greener than the last one they
 sent.  So what have you come to bother about us this time?"

>close hatch
 Closed.

>tioucs
 The word "tioucs" is not necessary in this story.

>topics
 You could ask him about the planet, himself, meetings, market-days,
 the town, the Empire, technology, the ruined bridge, or the green
 house, or tell him about the Federation, or Leela.

>SAVE
>cf4
 Saved.

>ask him about planet
 "This is just one of our regular visits to check up on how things are
 going here," you tell him, "So, how are things going here?  Any
 problems?"

 "The harvest is not plentiful, children are not respectful to their
 parents, and parents do not produce enough children to make our
 numbers increase," he shrugs, "Nothing changes."

>tell him about empire
 "Let me tell you about the Empire," you say.

 "If you must," he sighs.

>tell him about empire
 You start to tell him about the Empire, but he interrupts you with an
 abrupt wave of the hand.  "Some other time, maybe," he says.

>examine man
 Which man do you mean, the portrait of the Emperor, or Petroc?

>petroc
 He's a slightly-stooped old man with a weatherbeaten face, grizzled
 grey hair, and a straggly beard.  He's standing here talking with you.

 Petroc is wearing a floppy hat.

>examine hat
 It's brown in colour and battered almost shapeless.

>bug petroc
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>put bug in hat
 You can't put anything in the floppy hat.

>topics
 You could ask him about the planet, himself, meetings, market-days,
 the town, the Empire, technology, the ruined bridge, or the green
 house, or tell him about the Federation, or Leela.

>ask him about himself
 (Petroc)
 "Did you say you're the Chief Elder?" you ask.

 "I sure did," he affirms, "but that just makes me the first among
 equals - the Chairman of the Council of Elders, I'm not some petty
 emperor."

>ask him about bridge
 "I see the bridge at the west end of town has fallen into terminal
 disrepair," you remark, "Can't you people even maintain a bridge?"

 "You are right," he sighs, "I have been trying to get agreement from
 my fellow Elders to act on that for some time now, but always there
 seem to be other priorities."

>ask him about green house
 "What's that green house for?" you ask.

 "The Wheatsheaf, you mean?"  Petroc replies, scratching his head,
 "It's the best inn in town - hell, it's the only inn in town.  Too bad
 it's closed."

>ask him about meetings
>tell elder about federation
 "How often do people come to meetings in this town?" you ask.

 "The Elders meet here once a month.  Once a year there's a Great
 Gathering when anyone can come," he replies, "Otherwise, it's just as
 and when."

 "I've been instructed to tell you something about the Federation
 crisis," you explain, "Ever since Relda, tension between the Empire
 and the Federation has been growing, and now there's a real risk of
 war.  I'm instructed to inform you that, in the event of hostilities,
 the Empire will continue to protect Elysium from outside interference
 as it has always done, even though much of our attention will of
 necessity be diverted to, ah, other matters."

 "Empire or Federation, what difference does it make to us?"  Petroc
 shrugs; but then his curiosity gets the better of him, "Who or what
 was Relda?  And why is your mighty Empire so worried about this
 Federation?"

>tell petroc about relda
 "It was what happened on Relda that revealed the real nature of the
 Federation," you explain, "Relda was one of the Federation's wealthier
 worlds - it may still be, for all we know.  It used to be
 self-governing, but the Federation took more and more power away from
 the planetary government, and bought up more and more of the planet's
 assets.  Then, a few years ago, the Reldans elected a new Planetary
 Council on a platform of wresting control of their world back from the
 Federation.  The Federation responded by blowing up the Council and
 blaming it on terrorists; then they took over the planetary government
 themselves.  Relda went from being a member-world to being a
 subject-world, a pattern that's been repeated all over the
 Federation."

 "That is where riches and greed and human ambition always lead,"
 Petroc opines, "to injustice and oppression.  That is why we have
 forsworn all such things here."

>tell petroc about federation
 "The Paranian Federation has grown nearly as strong as the Empire - it
 too now numbers more than sixty worlds over a comparable volume of
 space," you explain, "Over the last two decades or so they've become
 more and more of a tyranny - as events on Relda showed - and they're
 also becoming more and more aggressive, looking for new worlds to
 conquer.  We can't stand by and just watch this happen, so sooner or
 later we seem bound to clash.  In any case, there's every danger
 they'll try to attack us!"

 "That's what your 'progress' and 'technology' does for you," Petroc
 grunts, "Our ancestors were right to turn their backs on all that
 rubbish!"

>tell petroc about bug
 "I found this planted in a pillowcase in the Legion office," you say,
 "Know anything about it?"

 "Planted in a pillowcase, you say?" he chortles, "Any fool knows it
 won't grow if you plant it there!"

>tell petroc about bug
 "This is a listening device; someone's trying to bug the Legion
 office." you tell him.

 "Bug, you say?  Well, if there's bugs in your office you ought to
 clean it more often," he replies.

>tell petroc about bug
 "This device was being used to spy on the Empire," you insist, a
 little pompously, "Do you have any idea who might be responsible?"

 "Spy?  Call that a spy?  Looks more like a withered pea to me!" he
 replies.  "But I suppose you're going to tell me it's one of them
 techno-thingies.  Well, I don't know about such stuff, and I don't
 want to know about it!"

>ask petroc about harcourt
 "I think we should discuss Harcourt Research," you suggest.

 "Do you now?" he retorts, "I should have thought we both had better
 things to do!"

>ask petroc about barn
 Petroc appears baffled by your question.

>tell petroc about cube
 You know better than to offend Petroc by discussing modern technology
 with him; he probably doesn't understand it and even if he does he
 certainly won't admit it.

>ask petroc about last rep
 His words of wisdom are lost in a fit of coughing.

>ask him about last representative
 He pretends not to hear you.

>ask petroc about previous
 Petroc drowns your question in a fit of coughing.

>ask him about visitors
 You ask your question but Petroc ignores it.

>ask petroc about elysium
 "Is there anything you need to report, any outside interference or
 anything like that?" you enquire.

 "The only outside interference comes from your empire," Petroc grunts.
 But then he relents to the extent of adding, "You haven't been talking
 with old Jeb, have you?  You don't want to take any notice of anything
 he says - he's full of addle-witted fool-guff."

>ask petroc about jeb
 "Who or what is old Jeb?" you wonder.

 "Oh, he's just the old fool who owns the farm just across the river."
 Petroc tells you, "He's not such a bad fellow, but he's so full of
 bumble-rot.  He says he saw something last week - or was it the week
 before?  He's such a muddle-wit he probably doesn't even know
 himself!"

>ask him about Leela
 "I met a young woman called Leela in the forest on the way here," you
 inform him, "She says she's an outcast - that you elders cast her
 out."

 "I know of no Leela," he tells you stiffly, "And we do not cast people
 out.  We take care of our own on Elysium."

>again
 "Leela's a young woman with long dark hair, about twenty standard
 Earth years or so old, I'd say," you remark, "Do you not know of such
 a woman?"

 "Your description would match any of a score of young women I know,"
 Petroc complains, "But none of them have been 'cast out'.  We do not
 do such things."

>again
 "Leela is half-starved and half-naked, and says none of you will feed
 her or clothe her," you tell him.

 "That is nonsense; if any young woman was in such a plight, any of our
 people would give her food and clothing," Petroc replies.

 "But she says you have forbidden it!" you protest.

 "That is a lie!" he declares fiercely, "We would never do such a
 thing!"

>again
 "Leela told me you cast her out because she was asking too many
 questions," you say.

 "The young always ask too many questions," he opines, "that is there
 way.  But we do not expel them for it; we simply try to teach them."

 "Teach them what?" you ask suspiciously.

 "The answers to those questions that may be answered, and the futility
 of asking questions that may not." he replies.

>again
 "So you don't know anything about the young woman I met in the
 forest?" you ask.

 "That is right - I do not," he affirms, "Indeed, I can't believe you
 met anyone like that - or if you did, she must have been spinning you
 some right old tale!"

>again
 You've exhausted that topic for now.  Petroc is clearly sceptical of
 what Leela told you, and even of her existence.

>topics
 You could ask him about the planet, old Jeb, himself, the council of
 elders, meetings, market-days, the Great Gathering, the town, the
 Empire, technology, the ruined bridge, or the green house, tell him
 about the Federation, or Relda, or ask him for clothing.

>ask him about jeb
 "What exactly did this old Jeb character think he saw?" you ask.

 "Something in the sky," Petroc grunts, "at the dead of night, he says.
 He went out to check on a mare that was in foal, and says he saw
 something blotting out some stars.  Sounds to me like it was just a
 passing cloud if it was anything at all, but the old fool swears blind
 it was more like something floating down from heaven.  I ask you -
 he'll be saying it was the second coming next!"

>ask him about jeb
 "What else did Jeb say about this object he saw at night?" you want to
 know.

 "Well - he reckons what it was came down a little way to the north of
 his farm.  That would make it to the northwest of here, somewhere
 across the river running through the forest.  But that's just crazy
 nonsense, of course - there aint nothing there but trees and grass!"

>ask him about jeb
 "This thing that old Jeb says came down to the northwest, what could
 it have been?" you wonder.

 "Hell, I don't suppose it was anything," Petroc replies scornfully,
 "Like I said, he probably just saw a cloud after having a mite too
 much to drink.  I wouldn't have mentioned it at all except to warn you
 not to take no notice of it.  Old Jeb is such an addle-wit I'd not set
 much store by anything he said."

>ask him about jeb
 "So you haven't checked old Jeb's story out?" you ask.

 "Of course not," Petroc snaps, "No one else has mentioned anything
 strange, and I've better things to do than waste my time checking on
 drunken ghost stories - and so, I imagine, have you!"

>ask him about the Great Gathering.
 "What exactly is a Great Gathering?" you want to know.

 "It's when the Elders and anyone else who can come meet here once a
 year to discuss the affairs of our world," he explains.

>ask him about the Great Gathering.
 "What matters do you expect to discuss at the Great Gathering?" you
 ask.

 "How this year's harvest is doing, what needs to be stored for the
 winter, how to rotate next year's crops," he begins, "Oh - and I'll be
 making my annual appeal for help with getting the bridge repaired.
 And then of course there will be telling of the old tales, to remind
 ourselves why we are the way we are, and why we must never become like
 you."

>ask him about the Great Gathering.
 "Do you discuss the same sort of things at every Great Gathering?" you
 enquire.

 "Pretty much," he replies.

>ask him about the Great Gathering.
 He's already told you that a Great Gathering meets once a year and
 includes the Elders and anyone else able to come.  The same sort of
 things are discussed every year: how the harvest is doing, an appeal
 for the bridge to be repaired, and the telling of old tales.  There
 doesn't seem much else to say.

>ask him about the bridge
 "So what are you going to do about that ruined bridge?" you ask.

 "As I said, I'm trying to get my fellow Elders to agree on a repair
 plan," he reminds you, a little irritably.

>ask him about the bridge
 He's already told you he's trying to get his fellow Elders to agree on
 a repair plan; there's no need to irritate him by going on about it.

>ask him about technology
 "Your aversion to technology - is it some kind of religion?" you ask.

 "Not quite that, though no doubt it helps us be more in tune with life
 in a religious kind of way," he replies, "Our ancestors, the people
 who first settled this world, saw what technology did to people and
 figured that it just wasn't good for folks to live like that.  The
 hankering for ever better technology was just the hankering to own
 more, to get what you want right away without waiting for it, and to
 get ahead of everyone else - in a word, plain, naked greed.  Your
 technology doesn't make folks any happier, it just makes them nastier,
 and blind to the really important things in life."

>ask him about tech
 Petroc ponders your question for a moment, then shakes his head.

>ask him about technology
 "Surely you don't think technology is all bad," you protest, "I can't
 believe you don't use any.  Surely you must at least use ploughs in
 your farming, ovens to cook, looms for weaving cloth and that sort of
 thing."

 "To be sure," Petroc allows, "But we try to keep it as simple and
 basic as possible.  Of course we have the means of providing ourselves
 with food, clothing and shelter, but beyond such basic necessities,
 nothing more is needful."

>ask him about technology
 "Don't you find life very hard and dull, denying yourselves all modern
 luxuries and modern technology?" you wonder.

 "You forget, none of us have ever known such things, so we can't miss
 'em," he smiles gently, "we have what we have and we're content with
 that.  We don't starve or freeze, but more to the point we don't kill
 each other for greed or fight wars with ever more terrible weapons.
 We don't clamber over each other in some crazy race to prove who's
 best, who's cleverest, who's greediest and powerfulest.  And as for
 life being dull - no, we're too busy to find life dull.  Besides, in
 the long winter evenings there's always the tale-telling and
 music-making and dancing and feasting.  At least we make our own
 entertainment - the stories passed down from our ancestors tell of
 human zombies on your technological worlds staring at moving pictures
 on screens all day long - what kind of entertainment is that?  And
 what kind of life?  Well, you may think our life hard by your soft
 standards, but to me it seems the only kind of life worth living.  If
 you don't believe me, join us and find out for yourself - how about
 it?"

 (You could say yes, say no, ask him about the planet, old Jeb, the
 river, himself, the council of elders, meetings, market-days, the old
 tales, the town, the Empire, technology, the green house, or repairs,
 tell him about the Federation, or Relda, or ask him for clothing.)

>SAVE
>cf5
 Saved.

>yes
 You consider Petroc's offer for a moment, and then decide it's really
 rather attractive.  You only joined the Sovereign Legion because it's
 a tradition in your family, and, if you're honest with yourself, you
 realize that both service in the Legion and life in the Empire is all
 a weariness - especially with the prospect of war looming.  Perhaps
 what you really need is a fresh start away from all the complexities
 of life in the modern Moltinoran Empire.

 So, looking Petroc straight in the eye, you smile and reply, "Yes, in
 fact I was hoping you'd offer.  If you'll have me I'd like to join
 you."

 Petroc nods his approval, "You are wiser than you look - and yes, you
 are welcome.  Come, let me lead you to your new life."

 So you follow Petroc back to his farm, and the first thing you do is
 swap your smart Legion uniform for a crude peasant smock.  Then you
 spend the rest of your life learning to become a competent and
 contended farm labourer.  In time you marry a pretty farm girl, have
 two fine sons and a pretty daughter, and neither the Empire nor the
 Federation ever bothers you again.

 Sovereign Legion Office
 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your
 idea of civilization.  A large white desk, with a standard built-in
 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is
 next to the window overlooking the street to the north, while a
 staircase runs up against the south wall to a hatch in the ceiling.  A
 second door is set in the east wall, to the left of the eagle, while a
 large portrait of the Emperor hangs opposite.

 Petroc is standing here.

>ask him about market days
 "How often is there a market-day in town?" you ask.

 "About every ten days or so," he replies, "Less in winter, of course."

>ask him about market days
 "Do many people come when there's a market-day?" you wonder.

 "Depends what you mean by 'many'," he grunts.  "There don't seem to be
 as many coming as when I was a youngster, if that's what you mean, but
 there's still enough."

>ask him about market days
 "What sort of things are traded here in the market?" you enquire.

 "Farm produce, mainly," he tells you, "A few pots and pans and the
 like.  Nothing fancy, mind."

>ask him about market days
 "Do you use money in your markets, or barter?" you ask.

 "Money?" he asks, with a look of repulsion appropriate to the mention
 of some particularly disgusting vice, "We don't use money on Elysium.
 So I suppose it must be what you call 'barter'".

>ask him about market days
 "Does the market here meet everyone's needs?" you wonder.

 "I don't hear anyone complaining about it," he replies.

>ask him about market days
 There's really no more to say about markets.  He's told you that
 there's a market-day in town about every ten days or so, though less
 frequently in winter.  The markets use barter, not money, and trade
 mainly in farm produce and basic utensils.  Fewer people come to the
 markets than in Petroc's youth, but in his opinion the markets still
 meet everyone's needs.

>ask him about bartering
 "I have no intention of discussing that right now," he tells you.

>ask him about barter
 Petroc mumbles his answer so you can't make it out.

>ask him about the green house
 "Why is the inn closed?" you wonder.

 "Dry rot, wet rot, stairs getting too rickety," he shrugs, "Anyway,
 it's too unsafe for folks to use till it's been repaired."

>ask him about the green house
 "When's the Wheatsheaf likely to open again?" you wonder.

 "This year, next year, sometime, never," he replies vaguely, "It seems
 to be harder and harder to get anyone to do repairs these days."

>ask him about the green house
 You've plainly exhausted this topic: the Wheatsheaf is the town's only
 inn, but it's closed since it's badly in need of repairs which no one
 seems willing to carry out.

>ask him for clothing
 "The young woman I told you about needs some new clothes, where might
 I find some?" you enquire.

 "Do I look the sort of man who carries a spare set of women's clothes
 around?" he snorts, "Women make their own clothes on this world - you
 won't find them growing on trees!"

>topics
 You could ask him about the planet, old Jeb, the river, himself, the
 council of elders, meetings, the old tales, the town, the Empire,
 technology, or repairs, tell him about the Federation, or Relda, or
 ask him for clothing.

>ask him about the river
 "How do I get across the river?" you ask.

 "You're the one with all the clever technology - a mere river can't be
 a problem for you!"  Petroc replies sniffily.

>ask him about the river
 "How do I get across the river?" you ask.

 "You're the one with all the clever technology - a mere river can't be
 a problem for you!"  Petroc replies sniffily.

>ask him about the planet
 "So there's nothing else you need to tell me?" you ask.

 "Nothing," he insists, "We are quite capable of ordering our affairs
 without your help."

>ask him about himself
 "I trust I find you in good health?" you enquire politely.

 "I have nothing to complain of in that regard," he shrugs.

>ask him about himself
 "Is there anything the Empire can do for you?" you ask.

 "Yes - you can leave us alone," he grunts.

>ask him about himself
 You seem to have exhausted that topic.  You've ascertained that Petroc
 is the Chief Elder, that he's in good health, and that he'd much
 rather the Empire left his people alone.

>ask him about repairs
 "Why is it so difficult to get any repairs done round here?" you want
 to know.

 "Because no one cares any more," Petroc replies, his shoulders
 stooping dejectedly, "Not about the town, anyway.  These days it seems
 anyone with the necessary skills is too busy fixing up his own farm."

>ask him about repairs
 "Are you saying that you can't get any repairs done in this town?" you
 ask.

 Petroc lets out a heavy sigh.  "It seems to be getting pretty much
 that way," he admits.

>topics
 You could ask him about old Jeb, the council of elders, meetings, the
 old tales, the town, the Empire, technology, or repairs, tell him
 about the Federation, or Relda, or ask him for clothing.

>ask him about old tales
 "What sort of old tales do you tell at your Great Gathering?" you ask.

 "Oh, all sorts," he replies, "Why our ancestors left your corrupt
 society to come here, how they built this place, how we survived harsh
 winters and dry summers - and then there are all the cautionary tales,
 stories of how greed and pointless 'technological improvements' always
 lead to misery and impoverishment."

>ask him about old tales
 "What other stories do you tell?" you want to know.

 "Now look here, youngster," he replies, "you don't have time to listen
 to our tales, and I don't have time to tell them right now."

>ask him about how they built this place
 You quickly lose the thread of his long rambling reply, so by the time
 he reaches the end you haven't a clue what he actually said.

>ask him about old tales
 He's already indicated that he can't be bothered to tell you the old
 tales.  So far as you can tell from what he said, they appear to act
 as legitimation for Elysium's backwardness.

>ask him about jeb
 "Is there anything else you can tell me about old Jeb?"  you ask.

 "No, not really" he replies, "I mean, he's a decent enough farmer and
 all that, and he don't generally create any trouble, but he is such an
 addlepated old fool.  Like I said, you don't want to take any notice
 of him."

>ask him about meetings
 "So you don't have that many meetings here," you surmise.

 "We have enough," he shrugs.

>ask him about meetings
 He's already told you that the Elders meet in town once a month and
 that there's a Great Gathering once a year.  That seems to be about as
 much as he's prepared to say on the topic.

>ask him about the council
 "How many Elders are there?" you ask.

 "Twelve," he tells you, "We each take responsibility for one district,
 but once a month we come together to discuss matters of common
 concern."

>ask him about the council
 "What do the Elders do?" you inquire, "What is your function?"

 "To guide our people and preserve our ancestral ways," he replies, "In
 particular we preserve the memory of the worlds we left behind, the
 greed and oppression and misery that goes with 'technology' and
 'progress', so that each generation can be taught what we have escaped
 and why we must preserve our simple way of living."

>ask him about the council
 "Do the Elders have a judicial function?" you wonder.

 "We settle disputes, if that's what you mean," he nods, "And we
 discipline anyone who must be disciplined - but you must understand
 that there is very little crime on Elysium; our simple lifestyle
 simply doesn't give rise to the greed and envy that drives so much of
 the evildoing in your advanced technological 'civilization'."  He
 looks at you for a moment then asks, with a little smile, "Perhaps you
 would like to escape your oppressive lifetyle and join us?"

 (You could say yes, say no, tell him about the Federation, or Relda,
 ask him about the town, the Empire, technology, or repairs, or ask him
 for clothing.)

>no
 "No," you smile, "I think not."

 "I thought not," he replies.

>ask him about repairs
 "Would you like some help with the repairs needed here?" you offer,
 "I'm sure we could send a team of people to fix things up nicely for
 you."

 "No!" he replies fiercely, "We don't want any more of your imperial
 interference on this world than we can help!"

>ask him about town
 "Why is this town so deserted?" you ask him.

 "Because it's not a market-day or meeting-day," he tells you.

>ask him about town
 "Does no one live in this town permanently?" you wonder.

 "Nah," he shakes his head, "What would be the point?  Folks have got
 too much to do in their own places without loafing around here."

>ask him about town
 "Was this town always so - unoccupied?" you enquire, avoiding the word
 "run-down" just in time.

 "There used to be a few folks who stayed here more or less
 permanently, back in the old days," he replies, "but those days have
 gone, and now we just use the place for markets and meetings."

>ask him about town
 You've already pursued the topic of the town as far as you tactfully
 can.  It's obviously in decline, since people no longer live there and
 only come for markets and meetings.

>ask him about technology
 "What about medical technology?" you ask, "Surely you people get sick?
 Things must be pretty grim for you without the benefits of modern
 medicine!"

 "You folks are always coming out with that tired old argument," Petroc
 chuckles, "But from what the ancestors say about your world, it seems
 to me that it's your technology that causes half your illnesses in the
 first place.  You folks just don't get enough fresh air and exercise,
 let alone good, healthy, natural food.  That's why you need all that
 fancy technological medicine.  There's nothing a healthy lifestyle and
 the right herb can't cure here well enough - till a man's reached his
 allotted span."

>ask him about technology
 "So you really think your people are happy living the way they do,
 without all the benefits of modern technology?" you ask incredulously.

 "I don't think it; I know it," he assures you.  "If you don't believe
 me, you're mighty welcome to join us and find out for yourself; you
 look young enough not to have have been totally corrupted by
 technological ways yet.  So how about it, youngster?"

 (You could say yes, say no, tell him about the Federation, or Relda,
 ask him about the Empire, technology, or repairs, or ask him for
 clothing.)

>no
 "No," you smile, "I think not."

 "I thought not," he replies.

>ask petroc about herbs
 "I fail to see the relevance of that question," he complains.

>ask him about federation
 "What do you think about the Federation?" you ask.

 "Nothing I can be bothered to discuss with you right now!" he grunts.

>ask him about relda
 "I'd be interested in your views on Relda," you tell him.

 "Then you'll just have to be disappointed, since I have no interest in
 indulging your idle curiosity," he replies.

>ask him about repairs
 "So it's a real problem getting any repairs done here," you surmise.

 "You could say that," he concurs.

>ask him about repairs
 There's no need to rub it in: it's obviously difficult to get anything
 repaired round here, and equally obvious that Petroc doesn't want your
 help.

>topics
 You could tell him about the Federation, or Relda, ask him about the
 Empire, or technology, or ask him for clothing.

>ask him about federation
 "Tell me about the Federation," you say.

 "Aargh, don't waste my time, I've got better things to do than talk
 about that!" he snorts.

>ask him about empire
 "Tell me, Petroc," you ask, "How do your people actually feel about
 the Empire?"

 "My people?" he echoes, "Why, for the most part they hardly think
 about it at all.  It's not relevant to their lives - and that's the
 way we like it."

>ask him about empire
 "What do you feel about the Empire, Petroc," you want to know.

 "The more it leaves us alone the better I like it," he replies, "Or
 rather, the less I dislike it.  No good ever came of the Empire
 meddling in our affairs."

>ask him about empire
 "But don't you realize that your settlement was set up in imperial
 space, and that you only exist because we allow you to, and because we
 protect you from outside interference?" you ask.

 "I may only be an Elder of a people who no doubt seem very backward to
 you, young man, but I'm totally ignorant of such matters," he replies
 gruffly, "Our ancestors were a peaceful group of settlers minding our
 own business when your ancestors came along and claimed we were on
 your land, as the strong always bully the weak.  And as for
 'protecting' us - go search the forest and see for yourself what your
 imperial 'protection' is worth."

>ask him about forest
 "So what will I find in the forest?" you ask.

 "Go and see for yourself," he growls in reply.

>SAVE
>cf6
 Saved.

>man, goodbye
 "Well, I think that's about it, then; I needn't detain you any
 longer," you say.

 "You've already detained me quite long enough," Petroc concurs gruffy,
 "So I shall bid you good day."

 Petroc leaves through the street door.

>Close the door.
 Which door do you mean, the street door, or the bedroom door?

>street door
 The door closes with a sharp click, indicating that it has relocked

 Petroc goes inside the large wooden hall.

 Opening the drawer reveals a purple datatab.

 The console screen displays a recent report on the status of Elysium.

 The summary page tells you that the current population of the planet
 is a mere 11,345 (as of the latest count, last year), and that Elysium
 has the lowest GDP per head of any planet of the Empire by a very long
 way.  The population apparently peaked at around fifteen thousand
 about a century ago and has been declining slowly ever since (there's
 a link to a lengthy social-scientific analysis of this, but you're
 content with the summary, which suggests that the society has simply
 become too stagnant).  The prognosis is that within a century or two
 Elysian society will have become non-viable and the Empire will be
 able (and obliged) to move in with a fresh bunch of settlers and make
 something of the world (though this is not to be communicated to any
 of the current inhabitants) but in the meanwhile, the Elysians are to
 be left alone to decay as they wish, since there must be no repetition
 of past tragedies (there's a link to a file explaining this in more
 detail, but it turns out you don't have the security clearance to read
 it).  The summary ends with an instruction to all imperial personnel
 operating on Elysium to keep contact and interference to the bare
 minimum required to monitor the status of Elysian society and ensure
 no outside interference.

 her about yourself, old Jeb, Leela, the robot, the town, the Elder, or
 the receiving device.)

>tell soolin about elder
 "I've had my meeting with the Elder," you tell her, "He wasn't all
 that bothered about the Federation crisis, and he didn't have much to
 say about how things were going here, but he did mention something
 some old farmer said, and I think it might be worth looking into."

 "What was that, sir?"  Sublieutenant Soolin inquires.

 "Well, the Elder seemed inclined to dismiss it, and it could be
 rubbish, but it sounded like the old farmer saw something that could
 just possibly have been an unauthorised shuttle landing," you tell
 her.

 "If someone is making an unauthorised visit here, I suppose that's
 something you need to investigate, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin
 acknowledges dubiously.

 "Quite," you concur.

>tell soolin about jeb
 "I'm not sure how much credence I should give to the Elder's report of
 what the old farmer thought he saw, but maybe I should see if I can
 find out any more," you say.

 "Whatever you think, sir," she agrees.

>inventory
 You are carrying an ID card, a pair of safety pins, a crumpled piece

 The purple belt contains a drik.  Your right pocket contains a tiny
 black bug.

 Roof
 Although the roof is not that high up, it affords you a reasonably

 roof, at one end of which is a tall white flagpole with a white locker
 at its base and a flag flying from its top.  At the far end is an
 array of solar panels, while in between a narrow staircase leads back
 down through an open hatch.

 You see an old brown sack (which contains an apple, a lettuce, a small
 loaf of bread, two tomatoes, a pear, a carrot, a piece of cloth, and a

 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is

 East End of Town
 The north side of the street is occupied by a large wooden hall.  On
 the south side is a neat single-storey white building (directly south)
 next to a two-storey green house (to the southeast).  The street

>examine hall
 It's the largest building at the east end of the town, but only on
 Elysium would it look at all impressive.  It has something of the look
 of a run-down village hall, or a primitive parish church without a
 spire.  At some point in its history it was painted red, but the
 paintwork has long since grown shabby and faded.

 There's a faint cheesy smell from somewhere.

>go north
 Inside the Hall
 This seems to be a meeting hall of some sort, with rows of plain
 wooden benches facing a crude stage at the northern end.  It's unclear
 whether this place is intended for religious or secular purposes;
 quite possibly it does duty for both.  The overall effect is decidedly
 gloomy, even though a fair amount of sunlight steals in through the
 unglazed windows and the open doorway to the south.

 Petroc is pacing up and down on the stage.

 Obvious exits: South

 Petroc turns away from you.

>ask petroc about hall
 "Hello again!" you say.

 "Oh, it's you," he grunts.

 "What's the hall used for?" you wonder.

 "Meetings, mainly," he replies laconically.

>examine windows
 They're just unglazed rectangles high up in the walls, serving to let
 the light in but hardly to exclude cold draughts.

>examine benches
 The long wooden benches are about as basic as they can get, little
 more than planks on legs.

>examine stage
 A raised area a couple of metres deep occupies the northern end of the
 hall.

 Petroc is standing on the stage.

 Okay, you're now sitting on the benches.

 Petroc resumes pacing around the stage.

 Okay, you're now standing.

 Petroc clasps his hands together and peers out over the hall.

 "Pardon my bothering you, but I just wondered whether I might have
 another word," you say.

 "If you must," he sighs.

 Petroc drowns your question in a fit of coughing.

 Empire, or technology, or ask him for clothing.

 East End of Town
 The north side of the street is occupied by a large wooden hall.  On
 the south side is a neat single-storey white building (directly south)
 next to a two-storey green house (to the southeast).  The street

 it leaves the town, while to the west it runs back towards the town
 centre.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Southeast

>go east
 You set off down the narrow farm track for a few hundred metres, until
 you see what you take to be a distant farmhouse some way further off
 to the east.  Then you pause, remembering your orders tell you to
 leave the settlers alone (apart from the Elders you've come to meet),
 so after a few moments' hesitation you turn round and come back.

>go west
 Town Centre
 This is the centre of the town, such as it is.  The main street, if it
 can be called a street, runs east and west from here, crossing a track

 steps.

>go north
 Hillside above the Town
 The grassy hillside slopes gently down towards the small town below,
 which is surrounded by farmland and bordered by a river to the west.

 entered to the northwest.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West, Northwest

 Edge of the Forest
 The main north-south track runs wide and straight here.  The trees are

 Dappled light plays through the sparsely spaced trees that thin out
 even more towards the southeast, where the forest ends.  In principle
 you could walk in any direction amongst these autumnal trees, but one

 easily get lost, except that you know that the way back to the main

 Market Area
 This fenced-in area of a few dozen square metres looks like it might
 be used for a market, both from the rubbish that's been left lying
 around, and the impress in the muddy ground of what might be stalls or
 tables.  A small shed stands near the centre of the area.  Gaps in the
 fence allow egress to the south and southeast, as well as north along
 the bank of the river.

 West End of Town
 The muddy street from the centre of the town to the east ends at a
 ramshackle wooden bridge that has unfortunately fallen into a terminal
 state of disrepair, leaving no other means of crossing the river.  A
 large wooden barn stands immediately to the south, next to a pair of
 tumbledown shacks, while on the north side of the street is a rough
 enclosed area that looks like it's probably some sort of market.
 Behind the market the land climbs up towards the distant forest.

 Town Centre
 This is the centre of the town, such as it is.  The main street, if it
 can be called a street, runs east and west from here, crossing a track
 that runs north and south.  To the northwest is a market area,

 Hillside above the Town
 The grassy hillside slopes gently down towards the small town below,
 which is surrounded by farmland and bordered by a river to the west.

 up the slope to the north is the edge of the forest, which can also be
 entered to the northwest.

 Inside the Shuttle
 The inside of the shuttle is not exactly spacious; there's room for
 the pilot and three passengers, one beside the pilot and two behind.
 The seats are comfortable enough, but otherwise it's all pretty basic.
 There's not much in front of you except the forward window; the pilot
 has a bank of instruments.

 Sublieutenant Soolin is sitting in the pilot seat.

 Obvious exits: Out

 As you clamber into the flyer you sit yourself down on the front
 passenger seat, next to the pilot.

 "Hello, sir!"  Sublieutenant Soolin greets you, "Does this mean you're
 all done and ready to leave?"

>no
 "No, not yet," you reply, "I still have things to do here."

 "Very well," she sighs.

>ask her about river
 "What do you reckon about the river, sublieutenant?" you enquire.

 In reply she frowns, as if she doesn't quite see the point of your
 question.

>Soolin, fly
 "It's time to fly, sublieutenant," you announce.

 "Where do you want to go, sir?" she asks.

 (You could tell her to return to the ship, ask her about herself, or
 the Federation crisis, tell her to leave, or tell her about Leela, the
 robot, the town, the Elder, the receiving device, or the bug.)

>farm
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>soolin, fly to jeb
 Sublieutenant Soolin sees no to jeb.

>soolin, fly across river
 Sublieutenant Soolin sees no river.

>Soolin, fly to ship.
 Sublieutenant Soolin sees no to ship.

>Soolin, return to ship.
 "Let's go back to the ship," you say, "I've finished here."

 "Right you are, sir," she replies.

 Sublieutenant Soolin turns to the controls and starts up the shuttle.
 Within seconds the argoms cut in and the shuttle lifts effortlessly up
 into the air.  You glance down at the forest and the tiny town below
 for one last time, but they shrink rapidly out of sight as the shuttle
 speeds skywards towards the orbiting frigate.  For a moment, you
 wonder whether you'll ever see Elysium again, but then Sublieutenant
 Soolin starts chatting with you, and your thoughts turn to the more
 immediate future.

 Sovereign Legion Office
 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your

 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is
 next to the window overlooking the street to the north, while a

 Bedroom
 This small bedroom is presumably provided in case a visiting Legion
 officer needs to stay overnight, but there's not much here apart from
 a single bed hard against the wall, a small wardrobe, and a small
 chest of drawers.  There's a door to the west back into the office,
 and a tiny bathroom to the south.

 The middle drawer contains a fluffy pink towel.  The top drawer
 contains a duvet.

 Inside the wardrobe is a small domestic robot.

 Presumably it carries out the routine maintenance and cleaning in this

 You'd better not do that while the robot is still charging.

 There's a faint cheesy smell from somewhere.

 This seems to be a meeting hall of some sort, with rows of plain

 This is the centre of the town, such as it is.  The main street, if it
 can be called a street, runs east and west from here, crossing a track
 that runs north and south.  To the northwest is a market area,

 side) and a large wooden hall (on its north).

 Market Area
 This fenced-in area of a few dozen square metres looks like it might
 be used for a market, both from the rubbish that's been left lying
 around, and the impress in the muddy ground of what might be stalls or
 tables.  A small shed stands near the centre of the area, with a
 trestle table off to one side.  Gaps in the fence allow egress to the
 south and southeast, as well as north along the bank of the river.

 West End of Town
 The muddy street from the centre of the town to the east ends at a
 ramshackle wooden bridge that has unfortunately fallen into a terminal
 state of disrepair, leaving no other means of crossing the river.  A
 large wooden barn stands immediately to the south, next to a pair of
 tumbledown shacks, while on the north side of the street is a rough
 enclosed area that looks like it's probably some sort of market.
 Behind the market the land climbs up towards the distant forest.

 The loft is little more than a storage platform running the width of

 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your

 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is

 This seems to be a meeting hall of some sort, with rows of plain

 gloomy, even though a fair amount of sunlight steals in through the

 Which slot do you mean, the black cube slot, or the console slot?

>cube
 You see nothing unusual in the small slot.

 You've no reason to take it off; it's part of your uniform.

 The gold buckle is embossed with an imperial eagle and the letters I S
 L.

>enter ISL
 You're already in the sovereign legion office.

>examine portrait
 The portrait provides evidence that even on this insignificant world
 someone is taking regular care of the Legion office, since it's a
 portrait of Charles V, who ascended the throne only a few months ago.
 He's a man of about thirty, trying to look formal despite the twinkle
 in his eye, dressed in the traditional gold-trimmed purple cloak and
 golden laurel-wreath crown of his office.

>enter charles V
 That is not something you can enter.

>cloak
 The story doesn't understand that command.

 A purple cloak is draped over the shoulders of the man in the
 portrait.

 The imperial crown in the portrait was clearly modelled on that of
 ancient Romans.

 Bedroom
 This small bedroom is presumably provided in case a visiting Legion
 officer needs to stay overnight, but there's not much here apart from
 a single bed hard against the wall, a small wardrobe, and a small
 chest of drawers.  There's a door to the west back into the office,
 and a tiny bathroom to the south.

 The middle drawer contains a fluffy pink towel.

 Inside the wardrobe is a small domestic robot.

 The single bed is set hard against the wall.  It's nothing special but
 it looks comfortable enough.

 Which wall do you mean, the west wall, the east wall, the north wall,
 or the south wall?

>go west
 On the west wall is a small fitted wardrobe, next to the door leading
 back into the office.

>examine wardrobe
 It's a fitted wardrobe, inset into the west wall.  It's open.

 Inside the wardrobe is a small domestic robot.

>examine east wall
 The bed is against the east wall.

>examine north wall
 You see nothing unusual about it.

>examine south wall
 Through the south wall is the way into the bathroom.

>examine bathroom
 You pop your head into the bathroom, and note that it neatly contains
 all the essential facilities in the minimum of space, but since you
 don't want to wash or relieve yourself right now, there's nothing here
 you need, so you return to the bedroom.

>examine toilet
 That's in the bathroom.

>flush toilet
 The word "flush" is not necessary in this story.

>examine bug
 It's round and black and smaller than a pea, and could easily be
 mistaken for an innocuous piece of dirt. But you now know that it's a
 state-of-the-art listening device sensitive enough to pick up any
 conversation held above a whisper at a range of at least ten metres.

>push blue
 A short beep indicates that you have opened a communications link with
 your pilot.

 "Hello, do you read me?" you ask.

 "I read you, praefect," the pilot's voice replies.

 (You could ask her about herself, or the Federation crisis, or tell
 her about yourself, Leela, the robot, the town, the Elder, the
 receiving device, or the bug.)

>ask soolin about herself
 "Is everything okay back there, sublieutenant?" you ask.

 "No change, sir; all's well here," she reports.

>ask soolin about crisis
 "I don't think the Empire has faced a crisis this big in a quarter of
 a millenium," you remark.

 "Since the Border War, you mean, sir?" she replies, "But the
 Federation is much more powerful than the Free World League ever was!"

 "Quite," you agree grimly.

>ask soolin about crisis
 "Do you reckon this Federation crisis will be over with quickly,
 sublieutenant?" you ask.

 "I wish I could say I did, sir," she replies.

>ask soolin about crisis
 You seem to have exhausted that topic for now.

 You can smell the cheese.

>ask soolin about league
 "At least relations with the Free World League seem better at last,"
 you remark.

 "Thanks to the efforts of the Emperor, I understand, sir," she
 replies.

 "That's right - and not least thanks to the efforts of the Emperor
 when he was still a serving Legion officer," you add proudly.

 You could tell her about yourself, Leela, the robot, the town, the
 Elder, the receiving device, or the bug.

>tell soolin about leela
 "I came across a young woman in the forest," you tell her, "she seems
 in a bad way.  Apparently she's an outcast - the Elders have turned
 her out and left her to fend for herself.  She asked me to find some
 food and clothing for her."

 "Well, that's up to you, of course, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin
 replies, "But I didn't think you were sent here to play the Good
 Samaritan!"

>tell soolin about leela
 "I'm still wondering what to do about that young woman I met," you
 say.

 "That's your call, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin replies.

>tell soolin about robot
 "I found a robot in the Legion Office building with a Harcourt
 Research maintenance sticker on it," you inform her, "I didn't know
 Harcourt Research Engineers visited this world!"

 "I suppose if it's one of their robots, then one of their engineers
 would be the most logical person to maintain it, sir," she points out.

 "True," you concede, "But they're hardly a company I'd trust on this
 particular world."

 "Right now, they're hardy a company anyone would trust anywhere, sir!"
 she points out.

>tell soolin about robot
 "I'm still wondering about that robot, and the idea of Harcourt
 Research on Elysium," you say.

 "I doubt it's significant, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin replies, "One
 engineer making a routine maintenance visit hardly constitutes a
 corporate takeover!"

>tell soolin about robot
 It's already plain enough that she's not that impressed by your
 speculations about Harcourt Research, so there's no point repeating
 them.

>topics
 You could tell her about yourself, the town, the Elder, the receiving
 device, or the bug.

>tell soolin about bug
 "I've just had another thought about that bug, sublieutenant," you
 tell her, "I found a scratch on the inside of the parapet running
 round the Legion Office roof.  It looks as if it could have been made
 by some sort of grappling-hook.  So someone could have scaled up onto
 the roof and planted the bug in the pillow-case, knowing they'd then
 be able to listen into any conversations taking place in the building
 whether the pillow-case was left in the flag locker or taken back down
 to the bedroom."

 "I suppose that is a possibility, sir," she concurs.

>tell soolin about bug
 "I'm still concerned about this bug I found," you remark.

 "You have every right to be, sir," she agrees, "Bugging a Sovereign
 Legion building is a very serious matter."

>tell soolin about cube
 "So, sublieutenant," you say, "I've found a bug in the Legion building
 and a receiving device in the barn.  Someone's spying on us, that's
 for sure.  I wonder if could be Harcourt Research."

 "This is a serious matter, whoever it is, sir," she replies, "I
 imagine that means you'll need to poke around a bit more."

 "I've now done all I need to do with their Elder," you tell her, "He

 seem all that bothered by the Federation crisis."

 "Did you expect anything different, sir?" she asks.

 "Not really," you admit.

 "Not really," you admit.

>tell soolin about town
 "Well, I've now seen this town of theirs and I don't think much of
 it!" you tell her, "It's not even a decent hamlet!"

 "You weren't exactly led to expect it would be like Romnova, sir," she
 replies, referring to the imperial capital.

>ask soolin about romnova
 "Have you ever visited Romnova, sublieutenant?" you ask.

 "I can't say I have, sir," she admits.

 "You should some time," you tell her, "it's a great city."

 "So I've heard, sir," she concurs.

 You can smell the cheese.

>go west
 Sovereign Legion Office
 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your
 idea of civilization.  A large white desk, with a standard built-in
 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is
 next to the window overlooking the street to the north, while a
 staircase runs up against the south wall to a hatch in the ceiling.  A
 second door is set in the east wall, to the left of the eagle, while a
 large portrait of the Emperor hangs opposite.

>go north
 East End of Town
 The north side of the street is occupied by a large wooden hall.  On
 the south side is a neat single-storey white building (directly south)
 next to a two-storey green house (to the southeast).  The street
 continues eastwards but quickly peters out into a narrow farmtrack as
 it leaves the town, while to the west it runs back towards the town
 centre.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Southeast

>close door
 The door closes with a sharp click, indicating that it has relocked
 itself.

>go west
 Town Centre
 This is the centre of the town, such as it is.  The main street, if it
 can be called a street, runs east and west from here, crossing a track
 that runs north and south.  To the northwest is a market area,
 opposite a large barn on the south side of the street, while to the
 east the street runs between a small white building (on its south
 side) and a large wooden hall (on its north).

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Northwest

>go north
 Hillside above the Town
 The grassy hillside slopes gently down towards the small town below,
 which is surrounded by farmland and bordered by a river to the west.
 The centre of the town lies straight down the slope to the south. Just
 up the slope to the north is the edge of the forest, which can also be
 entered to the northwest.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West, Northwest

>go north
 Edge of the Forest
 The main north-south track runs wide and straight here.  The trees are
 more widely spaced, so that you could easily wander among them on
 either side of the main track.  To the south they become sparser
 still, indicating that the edge of the forest lies that way.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West

>go north
 Heart of the Forest
 Alien foliage clogs the ground between the trees that crowd around you
 on every side.  The main trail heads straight off to the north and
 snakes through the trees to the south.  You can't see any side trails
 as such, but there may be the odd gap in the trees through which you
 could pass.

 Obvious exits: North, South

>examine foliage
 Actually, you're not entirely sure how alien it is, that is whether
 it's indigenous to this planet or some imported (and possibly mutated)
 Earthish flora you're not familiar with.  But then, botany never was
 your strong point.  Whatever it is, the bluish-green stuff looks too
 thick to wade through.

 You can smell the cheese.

>examine gap
 Apart from the main path, the only gap through the trees that looks
 passable here is the one directly to the west.  It's pretty narrow,
 but you could just squeeze through it.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>go west
 You squeeze through the gap, and then blunder around in the
 undergrowth for a while before hitting on another path.

 Narrow Path
 You seem to have found your way onto a different path from the one you
 just left.  For one thing it looks narrower, and for another it leads
 west and southeast from here.  The trees also look different from the
 ones you saw before; there's a gap through them just to the east,
 through which you've just emerged.

 Obvious exits: East, West, Southeast

>go west
 Clearing
 It looks as if the forest is gradually encroaching on this clearing,
 with the line of trees advancing slowly but steadily towards its
 centre year by year.  Right now, it's still quite large, with a clear
 path running out to the east, and another to the west.  A closer
 examination reveals what looks like the rotting remains of several
 buildings, now heavily overgrown and scarcely jutting about ground
 level, apart from the remains of a white stone building, the walls of
 which are more or less still standing.  This building stands just to
 the south, while the clearing continues a short way to the north.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West

>go south
 Inside the Stone Building
 The single room inside the building is open to the sky and mostly full
 of rubble.  In the one corner that remains reasonably accessible, the
 southwest corner, a triangular light fitting remains near what would
 once have been the ceiling.  The doorless exit lies to the north.

 An old metal crate sits in the southwest corner.

 A battered cabinet lies half-buried under the rubble in the northeast
 corner of the room.

 Obvious exits: North

>examine crate
 The large metal crate was once painted dark green, and some of the
 paint remains between the patches of rust.  The dust on the floor
 round the crate looks as if it may have been recently disturbed.  It's
 closed.

>open crate
 Opening the metal crate reveals a mallet and some smelly rags.

>take mallet and rags
 mallet: Taken.
 smelly rags: Taken.

>open cabinet
 The rubble prevents you getting at the cabinet to open it.

>move rubble
 There's far too much rubble to shift it all, and the pieces of rubble
 covering the cabinet are too large to move.

 Most of it is buried under the rubble, but the parts you can make out
 are painted blue.  It's closed.

>hit rubble with mallet

 Grey dust covers the one strip of floor that isn't otherwise covered
 in rubble, but the dust towards the southern end of this strip looks

>stand on crate
 (first getting in the southwest corner, then closing the metal crate)
 When you stand on the crate you catch sight of something sitting on
 the light fitting.

>examine sw corner
 A broken light fitting is fixed high up - too high up to reach - in
 the southwest corner of the room.  On the light fitting is a small
 silver key.

 An old metal crate sits in the southwest corner.

 You are standing on the metal crate.

>take key

>examine strip
 Which strip do you mean, the piece of cloth, the narrow strip, the

 Although most of the floor is covered with rubble, a narrow strip
 running from the door to the southwest corner of the room is
 relatively rubble-free.

 Clearing
 The trees that surround this large clearing seem to be gradually
 encroaching upon it, though it will be a century or two yet before
 they finally overwhelm it.  For now, the overgrown remains of several
 buildings are still visible, with one solitary white stone building to
 the south still just about standing.  The clearing continues to the
 north, while paths lead out to east and west.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West

>go west
 You set off down the path to the west, and quickly arrive at the banks
 of a river.

 East Bank of River
 The path from the east comes to an abrupt end on the bank of a
 sluggish river.  A couple of rotting posts sticking out of the ground
 are all that remains of what may once have been a bridge, the former
 existence of which is also suggested by a path disappearing into the
 trees on the opposite bank.  It may once have been possible to walk
 south along the riverbank, but that direction has become so overgrown
 that this would be quite impossible now, and though you could walk a
 short distance north, it looks like the climb might quickly become too
 steep.

 Leela is bathing in the river.

 Leela waves at you and laughs gaily.

 You can smell the cheese.

 She's a young woman of about twenty standard Earth years of age.  She

 Leela swims a little closer to the shore.

>go north
 Just as you are about to go Leela swims to the bank and hauls herself
 out of the water, then stands before you naked, dripping and beaming.

 "Haven't you ever seen a naked woman before?" she laughs, seeing the
 startled expression on your face, "It's perfectly natural, you know -
 don't tell me you sophisticated offworlders have a problem with
 nudity!"  As you try not to blush, she continues, "But if it is a
 problem - well, I was so sure you would bring me some new clothes I
 threw the old ones away.  And I then managed to make myself some soap
 out of guba-bark and peka-leaves, and I thought I'd give myself a good
 wash.  So - you did bring me some food and clothes, didn't you?"

 "Yes, I've found something for you to wear and something for you to

 "Well, let me see then, show me!" she asks eagerly.

 Leela follows close behind you.  You set off down the path to the
 east, and continue straight on until the point where it starts to
 bend.

 Edge of the Forest
 The main north-south track runs wide and straight here.  The trees are
 more widely spaced, so that you could easily wander among them on
 either side of the main track.  To the south they become sparser
 still, indicating that the edge of the forest lies that way.

 Leela is standing naked in front of you.

 "Well, I hardly know what to say," you mutter.

 "How about a straight yes or no?" she suggests.

>go south
 "I can't follow you into the town," says Leela, "I daren't be spotted
 there.  I'll have to wait for you here."  She stands still and gives
 you a little wave as you walk away.  Leela blocks you path, "Hey!
 Don't try to walk away!" she protests, "I just asked you a question -
 do you find me attractive?"

 "Hello, you're back!"  Leela greets you.

>yes
 "Yes, I do, Leela," you tell her frankly, "In fact I think you're
 absolutely gorgeous!"

 "Why, thank you, kind sir!" she beams, "That's good, because you're
 not so bad yourself!"

>go south
 "I can't follow you into the town," says Leela, "I daren't be spotted

 Hillside above the Town
 The grassy hillside slopes gently down towards the small town below,
 which is surrounded by farmland and bordered by a river to the west.
 The centre of the town lies straight down the slope to the south. Just
 up the slope to the north is the edge of the forest, which can also be
 entered to the northwest.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West, Northwest

>go south
 You walk down the slope into the centre of the town.

 Town Centre
 This is the centre of the town, such as it is.  The main street, if it
 can be called a street, runs east and west from here, crossing a track
 that runs north and south.  To the northwest is a market area,
 opposite a large barn on the south side of the street, while to the
 east the street runs between a small white building (on its south
 side) and a large wooden hall (on its north).

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Northwest

>go south
 You've already discovered that there's nothing that way but farmland,
 and you're not meant to be trampling over settlers' farms.

>go east
 East End of Town
 The north side of the street is occupied by a large wooden hall.  On
 the south side is a neat single-storey white building (directly south)
 next to a two-storey green house (to the southeast).  The street
 continues eastwards but quickly peters out into a narrow farmtrack as
 it leaves the town, while to the west it runs back towards the town
 centre.

 Sovereign Legion Office
 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your
 idea of civilization.  A large white desk, with a standard built-in
 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is
 next to the window overlooking the street to the north, while a
 staircase runs up against the south wall to a hatch in the ceiling.  A
 second door is set in the east wall, to the left of the eagle, while a
 large portrait of the Emperor hangs opposite.

 Obvious exits: North, East, Up

>go east
 Bedroom
 This small bedroom is presumably provided in case a visiting Legion
 officer needs to stay overnight, but there's not much here apart from
 a single bed hard against the wall, a small wardrobe, and a small
 chest of drawers.  There's a door to the west back into the office,
 and a tiny bathroom to the south.

 The middle drawer contains a fluffy pink towel.

 Inside the wardrobe is a small domestic robot.

>give towel to Leela.
 Leela grabs the towel off you eagerly, saying, "Hey, thanks, this is
 just what I need!"

 She gives herself a good rubbing over with the towel from head to
 foot, and in less than a minute she's completely dry.

 You can smell the cheese.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>give sheet to Leela
 "I couldn't find any clothes, but I thought you might be able to make
 something out of this," you say, handing her the sheet.

 She takes the sheet and tries folding it and wrapping it round her,
 but each time she walks a few places, the sheet slips off again.

 "It's no good!" she laughs, "I can't make it stay on!  But I'll keep
 it anyway - perhaps I can tear a hole it in and slip it over my head,
 or perhaps we can come up with a way to fasten it."

 You can smell the cheese.

>give sheet to leela
 Leela already has that.

 "Now I'm dry I could really do with something to wear," Leela remarks.

>inventory
 You are carrying a pair of safety pins, a white pillowcase (which
 contains an old brown sack (which contains a fishing rod and a small
 black cube)), a small iron key, a purple datatab, a drik, a tiny black
 bug, an ID card, a duvet, a piece of cloth, a mallet, some smelly
 rags, and a small silver key.  You're wearing a purple belt and a
 white uniform.  Your right pocket contains a crumpled piece of paper.

 You can smell the cheese.

>give pins to leela
 "Here, I thought you could use these to pin the sheet round you
 somehow," you suggest, handing her the safety pins.

 After a couple of tries, Leela apparently works out how to operate the
 safety pins, then she folds the sheet and, with your help, manages to
 drape it round her and over one shoulder, pinning it together in a
 couple of places so that it stays in place.  Finally she does a little
 twirl to demonstrate her success - and the sheet still remains in
 place.

 "There, that's better!" she beams.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>examine leela
 She's a young woman of about twenty standard Earth years of age.  Now
 that she's cleaned up and clothed in something better than filthy
 rags, she looks a lot better than when you first saw her.  Indeed,
 she's a remarkably attractive young woman, with a beautifully formed
 oval face framed by a cascade of long dark hair.

 Leela is carrying a tomato, a carrot, a lettuce, an apple, a small
 wedge of cheese, and a fluffy pink towel, and she's wearing a sheet.

 "You have really been very good to me," Leela remarks, "You hardly
 know me, and you're obviously someone very important, and yet you've
 found the time to feed me and clothe me.  I'm very grateful, of
 course, but it's such a long time since anyone's been kind to me, and
 I feel - I feel more than gratitude.  But what can I possibly do for a
 great man like you in return?"

 You can smell the cheese.

 (You could offer to take her offworld, or ask her for a relationship.)

>offer to take her offworld
 "I could do more for you," you point out, "I could take you with me,
 offworld, and find you a new home in the Empire.  There doesn't seem
 to be much future for you here!"

 "Could you?" she asks, her eyes lighting up, "How?"

 "I have a shuttle waiting nearby - that's a kind of flying machine
 that can take us off this planet.  Come with me and I'll show you."

 "All right, then; whenever you're ready to leave, I'll come with you,"
 she declares.

>ask leela about jeb
 "Do you know anything about a fellow called old Jeb?" you ask.

 "Isn't he the old fellow who lives over...?" she suggests.

 "Over there, just across the river," you say.

 "That's right," she affirms.

>ask her for a relationship
 "Leela, can you give me a relationship, please?" you ask.

 "I'm not sure I care to!" she replies.

 Heart of the Forest
 Alien foliage clogs the ground between the trees that crowd around you
 on every side.  The main trail heads straight off to the north and
 snakes through the trees to the south.  You can't see any side trails
 as such, but apart from the main path, the only gap through the trees
 that looks passable here is the one directly to the west.  It's pretty
 narrow, but you could just squeeze through it.

 Leela enters the heart of the forest with you.

 You can smell the cheese.

 blunder around in the undergrowth for a while before hitting on
 another path.

 Narrow Path
 A narrow path, rather faint to the southeast but becoming clearer to

 possible to squeeze through the gap to the east.

 Clearing
 The trees that surround this large clearing seem to be gradually
 encroaching upon it, though it will be a century or two yet before
 they finally overwhelm it.  For now, the overgrown remains of several
 buildings are still visible, with one solitary white stone building to
 the south still just about standing.  The clearing continues to the
 north, while paths lead out to east and west.

 Leela enters the clearing with you.

 You can smell the cheese.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West

>go west
 Leela follows close behind you.  You set off down the path to the
 west, and quickly arrive at the banks of a river.

 East Bank of River
 The path from the east comes to an abrupt end on the bank of a
 sluggish river.  A couple of rotting posts sticking out of the ground
 are all that remains of what may once have been a bridge, the former
 existence of which is also suggested by a path disappearing into the
 trees on the opposite bank.  It may once have been possible to walk
 south along the riverbank, but that direction has become so overgrown
 that this would be quite impossible now, and though you could walk a
 short distance north, it looks like the climb might quickly become too
 steep.

 Leela reaches the east bank of the river with you.

 You can smell the cheese.

 Obvious exits: North, East

>go north
 You walk a short way north, but the path all too quickly starts to
 turn into a difficult rocky climb, and since it doesn't seem all that
 important to find what lies in that direction, you decide to retrace
 your steps.

 You can't walk on water and you don't fancy trying to wade or swim.

 it finally peters out among more sparsely-spaced trees.

 Thinning Forest
 Dappled light plays through the sparsely spaced trees that thin out
 even more towards the southeast, where the forest ends.  In principle
 you could walk in any direction amongst these autumnal trees, but one
 direction looks much the same as any other, so you could all too
 easily get lost, except that you know that the way back to the main
 path is to the east, and that there's another path to the northwest.

 Hillside above the Town
 The grassy hillside slopes gently down towards the small town below,
 which is surrounded by farmland and bordered by a river to the west.

 Inside the Hall
 This seems to be a meeting hall of some sort, with rows of plain
 wooden benches facing a crude stage at the northern end.  It's unclear
 whether this place is intended for religious or secular purposes;
 quite possibly it does duty for both.  The overall effect is decidedly
 gloomy, even though a fair amount of sunlight steals in through the
 unglazed windows and the open doorway to the south.

 Inside the Stone Building
 The single room inside the building is open to the sky and mostly full
 of rubble.  In the one corner that remains reasonably accessible, the
 southwest corner, a triangular light fitting remains near what would
 once have been the ceiling.  The doorless exit lies to the north.

 An old metal crate sits in the southwest corner.

 A battered cabinet lies half-buried under the rubble in the northeast
 corner of the room.

 but without success, "It's no good," she says, "I can't budge it!  I
 wonder what's down there!"

 Leela stands in the southwest corner.

 Darkened Cellar

 ladder leading back up, but the rest of this space is shrouded in
 gloom.

 There's a faint cheesy smell from somewhere.

 Obvious exits: Up

>push green
 The drik lights up.

 "Gosh, that's clever!"  Leela declares, "How did you manage that?"

 Cellar
 The cellar is about the same size as the room above, but in slightly
 better condition.  The walls have suffered from centuries of damp, so
 that little of the original white paint shows through the dark mould
 and damp stains.  The only things of any significance to have survived
 the ravages of the years are a tall metal cabinet in one corner and
 the ladder leading up to an open trapdoor in another.

 A large mattress lies on the floor in the middle of the room.

 A rubber raft, currenly deflated, lies on the floor.

 You see a dark green knapsack here.

 Leela is standing nearby.

 You can smell the cheese.

 Obvious exits: Up

 Leela walks round the cellar with an expression of considerable
 curiosity on her face.  "This place looks old, really old," she
 remarks, "I suppose it must have been part of the original building,
 all those generations ago."  She pauses, with a thoughtful expression
 on her face, "But some of this stuff must be newer than that, mustn't
 it?  Take this mattress, it looks almost new!  Wouldn't it have rotted
 away by now if it had been put here all those generations ago when the
 building upstairs was still standing?  How curious!  Hm, I think I'll
 give it a try."

 So saying, she lies down on the mattress, placing her hands behind her
 head.

 "Gosh, this is comfy!" she declares, "Much nicer than the scratchy old
 straw thing I had to use back home!  You want to know what I think?"

>kiss leela
 You kiss her fully on the lips, and she responds by wrapping her arms
 round your neck to give you a long passionate kiss in return.

 "I'll take it silence means consent, then," Leela announces.  "Well,
 what I think is this," she explains, "I reckon that building upstairs
 was originally built for use by the Empire, right?"

 "I reckon, so," you agree, "It looks like it was abandoned centuries
 ago, but it has the look of some sort of imperial office."

 "Right," she continues, "But the Empire is still interested in
 Elysium, isn't it?  Obviously, otherwise you wouldn't be here.  But
 maybe the Empire doesn't always want the Elders to know when they're
 checking up on us, so it uses this place as a secret base - that's why
 they kitted out this basement.  What do you think?"

 (You could agree, or disagree.)

>agree
 "I suppose that's the most plausible explanation," you frown, "Though
 this is the first I'd heard of the Empire carrying out clandestine
 operations here."

 "Obviously they don't tell you everything," she remarks, "As I
 understand it, the only people you imperial offworlders are ever meant
 to see here are the Elders; is that right?"

 "Yes," you nod, "But how did you know that?"

 "Because I never met anyone but an Elder who's ever spoken to an
 offworlder," she replies, "So that means the Elders get to control the
 way your people see this world, and what they think is going on here.
 Well, maybe it is just wishful thinking on my part, but I'd like to
 think that your people are not quite so easily duped.  But because
 there seems to be some kind of understanding that the only people your
 people are meant to meet on this world are the Elders - no doubt to
 spare the rest of us from offworld 'corruption' - the only way you
 people are ever going to learn how things really are here is by
 sending people to watch us in secret.  What do you think?"

 You can smell the cheese.

 (You could agree with her ideas, tell her that you suspect illegal
 settlers, blame Harcourt Research, or say you don't know.)

>hmm
 The word "hmm" is not necessary in this story.

>blame Harcourt
 "I'm wondering if it could be something to do with Harcourt Research,"
 you tell her, "They're a rapacious outfit, and I know at least one of
 their people has been on this world recently.  They might be
 interested in trying to suss this place out some more."

 "Who or what are Harcourt Research, and why do you suspect them?" she
 wants to know.

 (You could tell her about Harcourt Research, yourself, the town,
 Petroc, the small silver key, or the raft, say it's too complicated to
 explain, or ask her about herself, the elders, Elysium, her questions,
 the town, markets or meetings, old Jeb, the mallet, or the small
 silver key.)

>tell her about Harcourt
 "Harcourt Research is the biggest commercial organization in the
 Empire," you explain, "It's a big company doing business over lots and
 lots of planets.  Some people have been saying for a long time that
 it's grown too rich and powerful, especially as it's basically owned
 and controlled by one man, Charles Harcourt.  Anyway Harcourt, the
 man, is now in a lot of trouble, but his company is still operating,
 at least for now.  Some people say it's a bit ruthless in its pursuit
 of wealth and profits, so if it saw something here it thought it could
 use - well, it would be tempted to send someone to investigate, at
 least."

 "I'm not sure I understood all of that," she admits, "But I think I
 get the general picture: there's this big group of people who think
 Elysium might have something they want, and you think they might have
 sent someone along to see if it's actually worth taking.  Is that what
 you're saying?"

 "More or less, Leela" you nod.

 She frowns thoughtfully for a few moments, then remarks, "But if they
 did find something they wanted, they'd have to come back to get it,
 and if they had to come often the Empire would stop them, wouldn't it?
 I mean, offworlders aren't meant to come here that often, are they?"

>yes
 "Yes; someone from the Sovereign Legion calls every four months or
 so," you tell her, "But no one else, of course.  No one else is
 allowed to come here.  That's the agreement we made with you."

 "I see," she nods.

>examine raft
 The raft, which is currently deflated, is made of some dark green
 rubbery material.  The only marking is a small label bearing the
 manufacturer's name.  Attached to the raft are a small red handle and
 a small green handle.

 Leela yawns and then stands up again.  "Well, I can't lie around all
 day," she remarks, "Found anything else interesting down here?"

 You can smell the cheese.

>examine label
 The label on the raft reads "Relda Raft Corp. - Mark IV Inflatable"

>take raft
 Taken.

 Cellar
 The cellar is about the same size as the room above, but in slightly
 better condition.  The walls have suffered from centuries of damp, so
 that little of the original white paint shows through the dark mould
 and damp stains.  The only things of any significance to have survived
 the ravages of the years are a tall metal cabinet in one corner and
 the ladder leading up to an open trapdoor in another.

 A large mattress lies on the floor in the middle of the room.

 You see a dark green knapsack here.

 Leela is standing nearby.

 You can smell the cheese.

 Obvious exits: Up

>examine knapsack
 It looks reasonably new and of modern design.  There are no obvious
 identifying marks but it looks like it could be either standard
 military issue or the sort of thing sold in camping shops anywhere
 round the known galaxy, though the lack of any trademark makes it seem
 unlikely that this is a consumer item.  It's closed.

>SAVE
>cf11
 Saved.

>open it
 Opening the dark green knapsack reveals a ration pack, a small round
 mirror, and a small black comb.

>ration pack
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>examine mirror
 It's just a small round hand-mirror, in which you can see your face.
 Its casing is made of a rather tasteless shade of orange plastic, and
 there's a serial number stamped on the back.  A closer look at the
 casing reveals a narrow crack running round its rim, suggesting there
 may be some way to open it up.

>open mirror
 (first taking the small round mirror)
 You open the mirror casing so that the back folds over to face the
 front at an angle of about 45 degrees.

 You can smell the cheese.

>look in mirror
 You see your own reflection.  How fetching.

>examine serial number
 The serial number stamped on the back of the mirror is "IOHop80Advx".
 As reflected in the mirror it reads "xvbA08qoHOI".

>examine pack
 It's a small container labeled "Field Rations" It's closed.

>open it
 Opening the ration pack reveals three food bars.

>examine comb
 It's just an ordinary small black comb; but a closer inspection
 reveals a couple of long dark hairs attached to it.

>examine hairs
 There's only a couple of them, and they're very fine, so it's
 difficult to be precise about their colour, but they're both fairly
 long.

>leela
 That command can't be used right now.

>examine leela
 She's a young woman of about twenty standard Earth years of age.  Now
 that she's cleaned up and clothed in something better than filthy
 rags, she looks a lot better than when you first saw her.  Indeed,
 she's a remarkably attractive young woman, with a beautifully formed
 oval face framed by a cascade of long dark hair.

 Leela is carrying a tomato, a carrot, a lettuce, an apple, a small
 wedge of cheese, and a fluffy pink towel, and she's wearing a sheet.

>compare dark hair to leela's hair

 The floor under the mattress looks much the same as it does in the
 rest of the room.

>examine cabinet
 It looks old and battered enough to be part of the original
 furnishings, although it's still basically sound.  It's closed.

>open it
 A plain black jumpsuit hangs in the cabinet.

>examine jumpsuit
 It's a plain black jumpsuit of a modern cut, rather too small for you
 and probably made for a woman.  A closer inspection reveals that it
 has a single small pocket.

>look in jumpsuit
 (first opening the jumpsuit pocket)
 The jumpsuit pocket contains an orange datatab.

>take orange datatab
 Taken.

>ask leela about jumpsuit
 "And people say I ask too many questions," she replies.

>ask leela about leela
 "How long will you be an outcast for, Leela?" you inquire.

 "Goodness knows!" she replies, "This present bunch of Elders isn't in
 any hurry to take me back.  Maybe once they've all dropped dead their
 replacements will be more forgiving - but I'm not counting on it."

 You can smell the cheese.

>leela, wear jumpsuit
 "Leela, I'd like you to wear the black jumpsuit," you tell her.

 "I'm sure there are all sorts of things you'd like me to do,
 offworlder," she replies, "But not even an outcast farm-girl does
 everything she's asked to by a man she's only just met!"

>go up
 Leela follows you up the ladder.

 Inside the Stone Building (standing in the southwest corner)
 The single room inside the building is open to the sky and mostly full
 of rubble.  In the one corner that remains reasonably accessible, the
 southwest corner, a triangular light fitting remains near what would
 once have been the ceiling.  The doorless exit lies to the north.

 A battered cabinet lies half-buried under the rubble in the northeast
 corner of the room.

 An old metal crate sits by the wall, next to the trapdoor in the
 corner.

 Leela scrambles up through the trapdoor after you.

 You can smell the cheese.

 Leela gets out of the southwest corner.

 Leela follows close behind you.

 Clearing
 The trees that surround this large clearing seem to be gradually
 encroaching upon it, though it will be a century or two yet before
 they finally overwhelm it.  For now, the overgrown remains of several
 buildings are still visible, with one solitary white stone building to
 the south still just about standing.  The clearing continues to the
 north, while paths lead out to east and west.

 Leela enters the clearing with you.

 You can smell the cheese.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West

>go east
 Leela follows close behind you.  You set off down the path to the
 east, and continue straight on until the point where it starts to
 bend.

 Narrow Path
 A narrow path, rather faint to the southeast but becoming clearer to
 the west, bends through the trees at this point.  It may also be
 possible to squeeze through the gap to the east.

 Leela walks along the narrow path with you.

 You can smell the cheese.

 Leela follows close behind you.  You walk down the path some way until
 it finally peters out among more sparsely-spaced trees.

 Thinning Forest
 Dappled light plays through the sparsely spaced trees that thin out
 even more towards the southeast, where the forest ends.  In principle
 you could walk in any direction amongst these autumnal trees, but one
 direction looks much the same as any other, so you could all too
 easily get lost, except that you know that the way back to the main
 path is to the east, and that there's another path to the northwest.

 Leela walks into the thinning forest with you.

 "I can't follow you into the town," says Leela, "I daren't be spotted
 there.  I'll have to wait for you here."  She stands still and gives
 you a little wave as you walk away.

 Hillside above the Town
 The grassy hillside slopes gently down towards the small town below,
 which is surrounded by farmland and bordered by a river to the west.
 The centre of the town lies straight down the slope to the south. Just
 up the slope to the north is the edge of the forest, which can also be
 entered to the northwest.

 that runs north and south.  To the northwest is a market area,
 opposite a large barn on the south side of the street, while to the
 east the street runs between a small white building (on its south
 side) and a large wooden hall (on its north).

 Sovereign Legion Office
 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your
 idea of civilization.  A large white desk, with a standard built-in
 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is
 next to the window overlooking the street to the north, while a
 staircase runs up against the south wall to a hatch in the ceiling.  A
 second door is set in the east wall, to the left of the eagle, while a
 large portrait of the Emperor hangs opposite.

 Its casing is made of a rather tasteless shade of orange plastic, and
 there's a serial number stamped on the back.  The casing is currently

 "My initial survey of the small inhabited district of Elysium
 indicates that this world could well serve our interests in the event
 of war with the Empire.  The imperial authorities take a minimal
 interest in the inhabitants, and their allegiance to the Empire
 appears equally minimal.  Moreover, the inhabitants are unbelievably
 primitive in their lifestyle, and have no significant military
 capacity.  An invasion by a single company of our troops would suffice
 to conquer and hold this world.  The inhabitants could be forced into
 slave labour (see below) and also used as hostages against any attempt
 by imperial forces to retake the world.  Any slaughter of Elysians
 could then be represented as the consequence of a bungled imperial
 military operation - indications are that this would not be the
 Empire's first military blunder on Elysium.

 Elysium has no industry beyond the bare minimum required to support
 their primitive farming methods.  Nevertheless, its agricultural
 assets would be capable of sustaining a moderate-sized Federation
 force if placed under Federation management and equipped with modern
 machinery.  Increased productivity would allow us to employ the
 surplus native labour thereby created in munitions factories to supply
 our forces; needless to say we should have to set up such factories
 ourselves, but the natives, though primitive, do not seem unduly
 stupid and could certainly be trained to work in such factories.

 Such a scheme would enable us to sustain a sizeable fleet in the
 Elysium system indefinitely, apart from an imperial counter-attack.
 Holding an imperial world deep in imperial space may be of both
 strategic and propaganda value to us.

 Whether the capture of Elysium would in fact be strategically
 worthwhile is beyond my brief to determine.  My initial survey
 indicates that it would be tactically feasible.

 Two further items of intelligence need to be determined before my
 investigation is complete, however:
 (1) How often the Empire comes to check up on Elysium.
 (2) In what strength the Empire comes to check up on Elysium.

 Squadleader Anita Johnson, FFIS."

 "I found a datatab," you say, "in the pocket of a black jumpsuit I
 found in the basement of an old ruin in the forest."

 "Do you know what's on it, sir?"

 "Yes," you reply,"It's a report from a Federation agent working on
 Elysium, suggesting that it would be tactically feasible for the
 Federation to invade and use this planet as a base behind our lines in
 the event of war."

 "Goodness!"  Sublieutenant Soolin's voice declares.

>tell soolin about orange datatab
 "The existence of this datatab shows that there must be a Federation

 "I found this raft in the basement of the ruined building in the
 forest," you tell her, "According to the label it was manufactured by
 the Reldan Raft Corporation!"

 "That's very odd, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin opines, "Relda's a
 Federation world!"

 "Quite so, sublieutenant," you concur.

>tell soolin about mallet
 "I found a mallet in a ruined building in the forest," you tell her.
 "It looks like it's of offworld manufacture."

 "That's odd," she replies, "It would be interesting to know where it
 came from; I don't suppose there's a manufacturer's name on it
 anywhere?"

>examine mallet
 The handle has a rubber grip to enable you to get a firm hold, while
 the head is wood tipped with steel.

>examine grip
 Which grip do you mean, the drik handle, or the mallet handle?

>mallet
 The rubber grip is orange, and covers most of the handle.  A closer
 inspection of the end of the handle shows the words "Made on Paran"
 inscribed there.

>tell soolin about mallet
 "I've just taken another look at that mallet I found, the handle is
 stamped 'Made in Paran'!"

 "That's very suspicious, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin replies,
 "especially with that Reldan-manufactured raft as well.  That's two
 items of Federation manufacture you've found in the forest."

 "Quite, sublieutenant," you agree.

>tell soolin about hair
 "You have really nice-looking hair, sublieutenant," you tell her, "I

 "Don't you have anything better to discuss, sir?" she retorts, trying

>examine jumpsuit
 It's a plain black jumpsuit of a modern cut, rather too small for you
 and probably made for a woman.  A closer inspection reveals that it
 has a single small pocket.

>search it
 (first opening the jumpsuit pocket)
 The jumpsuit pocket contains an orange datatab.

>take orange
 (the orange datatab)
 Taken.

 You can smell the cheese.

>open sack
 Opening the dark green knapsack reveals a ration pack, a small round
 mirror, and a small black comb.

>examine comb
 It's just an ordinary small black comb; but a closer inspection
 reveals a couple of long dark hairs attached to it.

>examine hairs
 There's only a couple of them, and they're very fine, so it's
 difficult to be precise about their colour, but they're both fairly
 long.

>examine leela
 She's a young woman of about twenty standard Earth years of age.  Now
 that she's cleaned up and clothed in something better than filthy
 rags, she looks a lot better than when you first saw her.  Indeed,
 she's a remarkably attractive young woman, with a beautifully formed
 oval face framed by a cascade of long dark hair.

 Leela is carrying a tomato, a carrot, a lettuce, an apple, a small
 wedge of cheese, and a fluffy pink towel, and she's wearing a sheet.

>examine mirror
 It's just a small round hand-mirror, in which you can see your face.
 Its casing is made of a rather tasteless shade of orange plastic, and
 there's a serial number stamped on the back.  A closer look at the
 casing reveals a narrow crack running round its rim, suggesting there
 may be some way to open it up.

>open mirror
 (first taking the small round mirror from the dark green knapsack)
 You open the mirror casing so that the back folds over to face the
 front at an angle of about 45 degrees.

>examine serial number
 The serial number stamped on the back of the mirror is "IOHop80Advx".
 As reflected in the mirror it reads "xvbA08qoHOI".

 You see no leela in the small round mirror.

 Cellar
 The cellar is about the same size as the room above, but in slightly
 better condition.  The walls have suffered from centuries of damp, so
 that little of the original white paint shows through the dark mould
 and damp stains.  The only things of any significance to have survived
 the ravages of the years are a tall metal cabinet in one corner and
 the ladder leading up to an open trapdoor in another.

 A plain black jumpsuit hangs in the cabinet.

 A large mattress lies on the floor in the middle of the room.

 Leela is standing nearby.

 Inside the Stone Building (standing in the southwest corner)
 The single room inside the building is open to the sky and mostly full
 of rubble.  In the one corner that remains reasonably accessible, the
 southwest corner, a triangular light fitting remains near what would
 once have been the ceiling.  The doorless exit lies to the north.

 A battered cabinet lies half-buried under the rubble in the northeast
 corner of the room.

 An old metal crate sits by the wall, next to the trapdoor in the
 corner.

 Leela scrambles up through the trapdoor after you.

 Clearing
 The trees that surround this large clearing seem to be gradually
 encroaching upon it, though it will be a century or two yet before
 they finally overwhelm it.  For now, the overgrown remains of several
 buildings are still visible, with one solitary white stone building to
 the south still just about standing.  The clearing continues to the

 The handle has a rubber grip to enable you to get a firm hold, while
 the head is wood tipped with steel.

>handle
 (the rubber grip)
 The rubber grip is orange, and covers most of the handle.  A closer
 inspection of the end of the handle shows the words "Made on Paran"
 inscribed there.

>examine raft
 The raft, which is currently deflated, is made of some dark green
 rubbery material.  The only marking is a small label bearing the
 manufacturer's name.  Attached to the raft are a small red handle and
 a small green handle.

 The label on the raft reads "Relda Raft Corp. - Mark IV Inflatable"

 Sovereign Legion Office
 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your
 idea of civilization.  A large white desk, with a standard built-in
 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is
 next to the window overlooking the street to the north, while a
 staircase runs up against the south wall to a hatch in the ceiling.  A
 second door is set in the east wall, to the left of the eagle, while a
 large portrait of the Emperor hangs opposite.

 "My initial survey of the small inhabited district of Elysium
 indicates that this world could well serve our interests in the event
 of war with the Empire.  The imperial authorities take a minimal
 interest in the inhabitants, and their allegiance to the Empire
 appears equally minimal.  Moreover, the inhabitants are unbelievably
 primitive in their lifestyle, and have no significant military
 capacity.  An invasion by a single company of our troops would suffice
 to conquer and hold this world.  The inhabitants could be forced into
 slave labour (see below) and also used as hostages against any attempt
 by imperial forces to retake the world.  Any slaughter of Elysians
 could then be represented as the consequence of a bungled imperial
 military operation - indications are that this would not be the
 Empire's first military blunder on Elysium.

 Elysium has no industry beyond the bare minimum required to support
 their primitive farming methods.  Nevertheless, its agricultural
 assets would be capable of sustaining a moderate-sized Federation
 force if placed under Federation management and equipped with modern
 machinery.  Increased productivity would allow us to employ the
 surplus native labour thereby created in munitions factories to supply
 our forces; needless to say we should have to set up such factories
 ourselves, but the natives, though primitive, do not seem unduly
 stupid and could certainly be trained to work in such factories.

 Such a scheme would enable us to sustain a sizeable fleet in the
 Elysium system indefinitely, apart from an imperial counter-attack.
 Holding an imperial world deep in imperial space may be of both
 strategic and propaganda value to us.

 Whether the capture of Elysium would in fact be strategically
 worthwhile is beyond my brief to determine.  My initial survey
 indicates that it would be tactically feasible.

 Two further items of intelligence need to be determined before my
 investigation is complete, however:
 (1) How often the Empire comes to check up on Elysium.
 (2) In what strength the Empire comes to check up on Elysium.

 "Yes," you reply,"It's a report from a Federation agent working on

 Federation to invade and use this planet as a base behind our lines in
 the event of war."

 "Goodness!"  Sublieutenant Soolin's voice declares.

 the Reldan Raft Corporation!"

 "That's very odd, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin opines, "Relda's a

 close investigation.  A closer inspection of the mounds suggests that
 they could well be old graves, and including those that are starting

 over three dozen of them.  On one of the graves you can just make out

 It's battered and rusty, and obviously old.  It looks as if it was
 once green, and on the front you can just make out a very faded golden
 eagle.  It looks like it might have been an Imperial Marines helmet,
 but it's certainly not the current pattern.  If the helmet were in
 better condition, it would belong in a military museum.

>show helmet to leela
 "Have a look at this," you say, handing her the helmet.

 She takes it and looks at with evident distaste, before handing it
 back.  "What do you think it is?" she asks.

 "It's an Imperial Marines helmet, I reckon, but one of a very old
 pattern.  It must be centuries old," you tell her, taking it back from
 her.

 "So your soldiers were here," she remarks.

 the south still just about standing.  The clearing continues to the
 north, while paths lead out to east and west.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West

>go west
 You set off down the path to the west, and quickly arrive at the banks
 of a river.

 East Bank of River
 The path from the east comes to an abrupt end on the bank of a
 sluggish river.  A couple of rotting posts sticking out of the ground
 are all that remains of what may once have been a bridge, the former
 existence of which is also suggested by a path disappearing into the
 trees on the opposite bank.  It may once have been possible to walk
 south along the riverbank, but that direction has become so overgrown
 that this would be quite impossible now, and though you could walk a
 short distance north, it looks like the climb might quickly become too
 steep.

 West Bank of River
 There's a clear view up and down the river from here, and it seems you

 solitary wooden post sticking out of the ground is all that remains of
 what may once have been a bridge.

 The river contains an inflated rubber raft.

 It's a round post, about ten centimetres in diameter, broken off about
 half a metre from the ground.

>pull post
>push blue stud
 You manage to pull the post out of the ground.  Moving the solitary
 wooden post reveals a plastic bottle (which contains a bright green
 liquid) underneath.

 A short beep indicates that you have opened a communications link with
 your pilot.

 "Hello, do you read me?" you ask.

 "I read you, praefect," the pilot's voice replies.

 (You could tell her about yourself, the mallet, or the plastic bottle,
 or ask her about the Federation crisis.)

>tell soolin about graves
 "I've come across some old graves in a clearing in the forest," you
 say, "There must be dozens of them!" you say, "anyway, one of them
 still has a headstone.  Apparently it's for some chap called Mark
 Villiers who was an IPC subcenturion back in the twenty-eighth
 century."

 "Hang on a moment, sir," she replies.  After a brief pause she
 continues, "I've just checked the on-board datastore.  Apparently
 there was a Subcenturion Mark Villiers of the IPC who was stationed
 here from 2720.  It says he died here in 2722."

 "That matches the date on the tombstomb," you tell her.

 "Then it's obviously the same chap." you say.

>tell soolin about sign
 "I see, sir," she replies blandly.

>tell soolin about graves
 "Does your datastore say anything else about Villiers?" you ask.

 "Just standard details of an unremarkable service record," she
 replies, "Plus, date of birth: 4th April 2687; planet of birth:
 Logya."

 "Nothing about how or why he died?" you wonder.

 "No, sir," she replies, "It's strangely silent about that.  I wonder
 if it could be related to whatever it was that went so horribly wrong
 here way back when?"

 "I was wondering that too," you say.

>examine bottle
 It's a clear plastic bottle of the sort that would be quite
 unremarkable on any human-occupied world but here.  According to the
 label it contains "Magiclean All-In-One Conditioning Shampoo and Body
 Cleanser (manufactured by Stellarchem, a Harcourt Research Company)".
 It contains a bright green liquid.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>tell soolin about bottle
 "I found a bottle of Magiclean All-In-One Conditioning Shampoo and
 Body Cleanser just across the river, hidden under an old
 bridge-support," you tell her.

 "It's a popular brand, sir," she remarks, "I use it myself.  But if
 you found it by the river I'd guess that woman you met in the forest
 has been using it - in which case she can hardly be what she seems."

 "That's what's worrying me," you confess, "I suppose there could be
 some other explanation - another strange woman visiting the forest."

 "Soolin's razor, sir: strange women should not be multiplied beyond
 necessity," she replies pertly.

>tell soolin about leela
 "I'm still wondering what to do about that young woman I met," you
 say.

 "That's your call, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin replies.

 West Bank of River
 There's a clear view up and down the river from here, and it seems you
 could walk some way along the bank to north and south, while an
 overgrown path disappears off through the trees to the west.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West

>bye
 "Over and out," you say.

 "Over and out, sir," she confirms, just before the comms link goes
 dead.

>go south
 You walk downstream along the river bank for a couple of hundred
 metres or so until you reach a point where a stream joins the river
 from the west.  Since this makes progress further south impossible,
 you are forced to turn round and come back.

>go north
 You walk upstream by the river for a couple of hundred metres, but the
 ground becomes increasingly steep, until it reaches the point where
 you'd be climbing as much as walking.  At that point you decide it
 probably isn't worth the effort, so you turn back.

>go west
 You battle your way along the overgrown path for a dozen metres or so,
 then suddenly emerge into a field.

 Overgrown Field
 The path from the east emerges in an overgrown field bounded by forest
 to east and south, a stream to the west, and a slope rising to the
 north.  The most striking feature, however, is the strange green
 structure half-hidden next to the trees to the south.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, In

>examine structure
 It's hard to make out exactly what it is, since it's covered by a dark
 green tarpaulin.  Whatever it is it's about three metres long and
 stands about two metres high at its highest point.  If this was your
 homeworld you'd guess it was a piece of farm machinery covered up to
 protect it from the elements, but you don't expect to find such things
 on Elysium.  On the other hand it looks the wrong shape for a hayrick
 and a distinctly odd shape for a farm building.

>go south
 You wander a short distance into the forest, but it quickly becomes
 apparent that you can't get very far in any direction.  The stream
 that runs down the west side of the field bend round to the east
 through the forest to join the river a little south of where you
 crossed it, and thus bars progress further south, or in any other
 direction except back north into the field.  After satisfying yourself
 that there is nothing of interest hidden among the trees, you
 accordingly retrace your steps.

>look under tarp
 You see nothing unusual under the tarpaulin.

>move tarp
 It's too firmly tied down.

>untie tarp
 You unfasten three of the ties from their spikes; that should be
 enough.

>move tarp
 It's rather unwieldy to manhandle by yourself; besides, if all you
 want to do is to see what's inside, you could just crawl through the
 gap underneath it.

>in
 You crawl under the tarpaulin.

 Under the Tarpaulin (in the dark)
 You can't see much, but you're aware that a large object is taking up
 most of the space here.

 Obvious exits: Out

 Under the Tarpaulin
 Most of the space here is taken up with a large black object.
 Otherwise you are completely surrounded by the tarpaulin.

 Obvious exits: Out

>examine object
 Although it's a large object, nearly three metres long, it's quite
 small for what it is - a single-person shuttle (i.e. a craft for
 conveying someone between an orbiting spaceship and the planetary
 surface).  Apart from a cryptic sequence of tiny letters under the
 door, it is unmarked and painted black all over, suggesting a desire
 for stealth.  You can't immediately identify the model, but you don't
 think it's an imperial one.

 (Your score has just increased by three points.)

>examine letters
 (the tiny letters)
 The letters stencilled under the shuttle door are almost too tiny to
 make out.  By shining your drik directly at them you just manage to
 decipher them as AHAYWEH.

>open door
 It's locked, and you don't have the right key.

>unlock door with silver key
 That is not something you can unlock.

>unlock ship with silver key
 The ship that brought you to Elysium is in orbit round the planet; you
 can't see it from here.

>unlock door
 That is not something you can unlock.

>examine door
 Like the rest of the shuttle, it's black, with a cryptic sequence of
 tiny letters stencilled just underneath.

>push blue stud
 A short beep indicates that you have opened a communications link with
 your pilot.

 "Hello, do you read me?" you ask.

 "I read you, praefect," the pilot's voice replies.

 (You could tell her about yourself, old Jeb, the black shuttle, or the
 mallet, or ask her about the Federation crisis.)

>tell soolin about shuttle
 "I think I've just found how the spy who wrote the report I found on
 that orange datatab got here," you announce, "I've just found an
 unmarked black shuttle parked in the middle of a field - hidden under
 a green tarpaulin."

 "Gosh!"  Sublieutenant Soolin declares, "That does seem pretty
 suspicious; there's certainly no one else scheduled to be visiting
 this world, so it must be an illegal."

>tell soolin about shuttle
 "I'd say that black shuttle and that datatab together provide pretty
 conclusive evidence of Federation interference on this world," you
 remark.

 "It certainly looks that way, sir," she agrees.

 structure half-hidden next to the trees to the south.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, In

>examine stream
 It's just over a couple of metres wide at this point and flowing quite
 fast.  Upstream you can see it tumbling down a slope to the north,
 whereas a little way downstream it starts to bend round to the
 southeast.

>tie tarp to stakes
 The word "stakes" is not necessary in this story.

>tie tarp
 You refasten the tarpaulin to the spikes.

>go north
 You walk up the slope, and pause to take in the view.  Looking south
 you can see over part of the forest to what may be farmland beyond.
 So far as you can tell there's more farmland lying in the distance to
 north and west, while just a little way over to the east the river
 cuts through the forest.  You see no need to risk confrontation with
 the settlers by walking over their fields, so after spending a few
 more moments taking in the view, you walk back down the slope.

>go south
 You wander a short distance into the forest, but it quickly becomes
 apparent that you can't get very far in any direction.  The stream
 that runs down the west side of the field bend round to the east
 through the forest to join the river a little south of where you
 crossed it, and thus bars progress further south, or in any other
 direction except back north into the field.  After satisfying yourself
 that there is nothing of interest hidden among the trees, you
 accordingly retrace your steps.

>pull green handle
 There's a hiss of rushing air as the raft inflates.

>put raft in stream
 As you lower the raft into the stream, the current snatches it from
 your grasp and begans to carry it downstream.  You race after it and
 just manage to retrieve it from the water before it disappears out of
 sight.

>pull red handle
 There's a hiss of rushing air as the raft deflates.

>push blue stud
 A short beep indicates that you have opened a communications link with

>tell soolin about jeb
 "Presumably that black shuttle I just found was what the Elder told me
 the old farmer saw coming down out of the sky a couple of weeks back,"
 you say.

 "Presumably, sir," she agrees.

>tell soolin about mallet
 "I found this mallet in a ruined building in the forest," you tell
 her, "the handle is stamped 'Made in Paran'!"

 "That's very suspicious, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin replies,
 "especially with that Reldan-manufactured raft as well.  That's two
 items of Federation manufacture you've found in the forest."

 "Quite, sublieutenant," you agree.

>ask soolin about crisis
 "Is the navy ready for war with the Federation, do you think?" you
 ask.

 "Ready enough, sir," she replies, trying to sound brave, "We'll give a
 good account of ourselves, I'm sure of that."

>again
 You both know the implications of what you found on the orange
 datatab: the Federation really is thinking of going to war with the
 Empire.  But there's no point dwelling on it right now; it would be
 more constructive to finish what you came for.

 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is

 "I found a black shuttle across the river," you tell her, "I don't
 think it should be there - do you happen to know anything about it?"

 Leela frowns, looks away for a moment, and repeatedly clenches and
 unclenches her fists, as if trying to resolve a quandry.  Then at
 length she lets out a heavy sigh and turns back to you, her manner
 suddenly different, as if she has just grown older and taller.

 "Okay," she admits, "There's no point in keeping up this pretence, is
 there?  That's my shuttle you found, and I'm not an Elysian farm-girl,
 as I'm sure you realize by now.  But it's not as bad as you think,
 really it's not.  I'm not a - well, I'm an anthropologist from Earth."
 Before you can protest, she cuts you off with a gesture, saying, "Yes

 place in the known galaxy where I can study such a primitive culture
 in the field. so - what happens now?"

>ask leela why she lied before
 "Why did you lie to me before?" you ask.

 "Because I shouldn't be here, obviously," she shrugs, "I've been
 trying to learn about the natives by living like one of them, and I
 hoped I could get away with passing myself off as one, but obviously
 it didn't work.  So, as I said: what happens now?"

 (You could ask why she lied before, ask which university she's from,
 ask how long she's been here, say you don't believe her, or show her
 the orange datatab.)

>ask leela which university she's from
 "So, you're an Earthish anthropologist," you say, "Which university
 are you from?"

 "Cambridge," she replies, "Why, does it make a difference?  So, what
 now?  If I promise to be a good girl and go straight back there, will
 you let me go?"

 (You could ask why she lied before, ask which university she's from,
 ask how long she's been here, say you don't believe her, show her the
 orange datatab, let her go, or arrest her.)

>show datatab to leela
 Which datatab do you mean, the purple datatab, the black datatab, or
 the orange datatab?

>orange
 "So what's this, then?" you ask, showing the orange datatab, "I found
 it in the pocket of what is no doubt your jumpsuit."

 Leela stares down at the tab for a moment, then nods, "Right," she
 agrees, "Obviously that is my jumpsuit, and obviously that is my
 datatab.  Like I said, I'm an anthropologist; it contains my field
 notes.  May I have it back please?"

>tell leela about spy
 "I asked you if you'd let me have my datatab back," she reminds you,
 holding her hand out, "Will you give it to me, please?"

>no
 "Certainly not!" you reply, "I'm confiscating this as material
 evidence of your illegal activity on this planet."

 She lays a gentle hand on your arm, and sets her face in an equally
 gentle pleading look, "Please," she begs, "I haven't made a copy, and
 if you don't give it back to me, all my work here will have been
 wasted.  If I'm going to get into terrible trouble, at least don't let
 it be for nothing.  You can give it back to me, can't you?"

 You can smell the cheese.

>tell leela about bug
 "I take it from your attempt to change the subject that that's a 'no'
 then," she sighs, "So what happens now?"

 (You could ask why she lied before, ask which university she's from,

 about the orange datatab, let her go, or arrest her.)

 I really am, what are you going to do about it?"

>tell leela I don't believe her
 The story doesn't understand that command.  Please use ASK ACTOR ABOUT
 TOPIC (or just A TOPIC).

 "Look, I do know I'm the one in the wrong here, but it would be polite
 to answer my question," Leela insists, "What happens now?"

>say I don't believe her
 "I don't believe you," you say, "if you're an anthropologist on an
 illegal field trip, why in the galaxy did you accost me earlier on
 asking me to bring you food and clothing?  Showing yourself to a
 Legion officer like that is the last thing anyone here illegally would
 do!"

 "I didn't realize you were a Legion officer until it was too late,"
 she replies, "I just saw a figure moving through the trees - once I
 realized my mistake I just had to improvise as best I could.  Silly,
 really, I just dug myself into a deeper hole, didn't I?  So, what are
 you going to do about it?"

 (You could ask why she lied before, ask which university she's from,
 ask how long she's been here, say you don't believe her, tell her
 about the orange datatab, let her go, or arrest her.)

>arrest leela
 "I'm sorry, Leela, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to place you under
 arrest," you tell her, "We both know you shouldn't be here, and my
 duty is plain: I have to take you in for questioning."

 "Okay, I'll come quietly..." she assures you, spreading her hands in a
 gesture of surrender, and approaching as if to follow you back to your
 shuttle.  Then, suddenly, she leaps at you, her hands clutching at
 your throat.  "...after hell freezes over," she rasps, as her grip
 tightens on your windpipe.

 Leela makes a grab for your throat but you manage to throw her off.

 "Is that the best you can do?  You're a dead man!" she sneers.

 "Remember that young woman I told you about? I think she must be a
 Federation spy; she attacked me just now - I think she was trying to
 kill me - I suppose because she thinks I've found out too much.  I
 shot her with my drik and she's out cold."

 "Good heavens, sir!" cries Sublieutenant Soolin, "But why do you think
 she's a Federation spy?"

 "Well, sublieutenant," you say, "First, finding the bug in the
 pillow-case, second finding the receiver in the barn, third the fact
 that her old clothes were in the crate when she said she had thrown
 them away, fourth finding the maglock key so close to the trapdoor,
 fifth the Reldan-made raft, sixth the mallet made on Paran, seventh
 what the report on the orange datatab said, eighth the bottle of
 shampoo/cleansing lotion I found hidden by the river, near where she
 was bathing, ninth the black shuttle parked in the field across the
 river, tenth the recording of my bugged conversations, and finally the
 new maglock on the trapdoor."

 "A Federation spy on Elysium!" she declares, "Any chance you could get
 her aboard the shuttle?  We should take her back for questioning."

 The inside of the shuttle is not exactly spacious; there's room for
 the pilot and three passengers, one beside the pilot and two behind.
 The seats are comfortable enough, but otherwise it's all pretty basic.
 There's not much in front of you except the forward window; the pilot
 has a bank of instruments.

 Sublieutenant Soolin is sitting in the pilot seat.

 Obvious exits: Out Opening the passenger door, you first set Leela
 down on the rear seat.

 As you clamber into the flyer you sit yourself down on the front
 passenger seat, next to the pilot.

 "Yes, I'm all done here, let's go," you nod.

 Sublieutenant Soolin turns to the controls and starts up the shuttle.
 Within seconds the argoms cut in and the shuttle lifts effortlessly up
 into the air.  You glance down at the forest and the tiny town below
 for one last time, but they shrink rapidly out of sight as the shuttle
 speeds skywards towards the orbiting frigate.

 Once she has put the shuttle on autopilot, Sublieutenant Soolin turns
 to you and says, glancing at the figure lying on the back seat, "I
 wonder if she'll talk, sir?  I can't imagine it'll be too easy to
 persuade her to confess to being a spy!"

 "No, I suppose you're right, sublieutenant," you agree, "she's a
 cunning little vixen and she'll use every trick in the galaxy to
 protest her innocence!"

 For a moment, you wonder whether you'll ever see Elysium again, but
 then Sublieutenant Soolin starts chatting with you, and your thoughts
 turn to the more immediate future.

 Some Background to the Story

 The Elysium Enigma is set in the same universe as a series of novels
 I've been writing and re-writing for the last thirty years or so, and
 may well be for the next thirty, as my ideas change faster than my
 ability to produce something I'm satisfied with. This game does not
 directly intersect with the story-line of the novels, though it takes
 place at roughly the same time, and alludes to some of the same
 characters in passing.  And like the protagonist of the Elysium
 Enigma, the protagonist of my permanently-in-progress novels has a
 career in the Imperial Sovereign Legion.

 In this story universe the Moltinoran Empire came into being in the
 25th century as a result of a Centauran initiative to gain Moltinoran
 support against an aggressive neighbour.  By the thirtieth century the
 Empire has become the most powerful political grouping so far known to
 humankind.  Although far from perfect, it is basically a benign
 institution, with huge constitutional safeguards limiting the power of
 the Emperor and guaranteeing a great degree of autonomy to member
 worlds; even a cranky failing settlement like Elysium is largely
 allowed to go its own way.  By the late thirtieth century, however,
 the Empire has gained a rival almost equal in power, the (so-called)
 Free Trade Federation of Paran.  Although originally benign in intent,
 the Federation has been growing steadily more sinister, sliding slowly
 but steadily into tyranny.

 My series of novels follows the career of Simon Quiller, a young
 Legion officer (who later becomes something rather more than that)
 roughly speaking through the 2970s and on into the early 2980s, from
 the time that the truly sinister nature of the Federation starts to
 become clear (Simon Quiller is on Relda to witness the events Andrew
 Holt tells Petroc about), through a period of growing tension, until
 the situation erupts into open conflict, and the Empire is faced with
 the seemingly ghastly choice between fighting a war that could cost
 billions of lives or giving way to one of the nastiest tyrannies in
 human history.

 In this universe, Earth (along with a few other worlds) lies between
 the Empire and the Federation and tries, futilely, to play the role of
 benevolent neutral, refusing to recognize the real threat of the
 Federation threat until it is too late.  Unlike Andrew Holt, who was
 born of aristocratic stock in the heartlands of the Empire, Simon
 Quiller, the hero of my novels, was born on Earth of an Earthish
 mother and Moltinoran father, and starts out as something of an
 outsider in the Empire.

 Of course, after the novels get re-written a few more times, some of
 that may change, not least the role of Senator Charles Harcourt, whom
 I invented as a villain a long while back, but the nature of whose
 villainy I have yet to master...

 West Bank of River
 There's a clear view up and down the river from here, and it seems you
 could walk some way along the bank to north and south, while an

 Sovereign Legion Office
 This office is the about the only place on Elysium that resembles your
 idea of civilization.  A large white desk, with a standard built-in
 console, rests under the great golden eagle mounted on the east wall.
 Behind the desk sits a comfortable mock-leather chair, while a pair of
 smaller chairs, one red, the other white, are positioned in front of
 the desk, presumably for the benefit of visitors.  The main door is
 next to the window overlooking the street to the north, while a
 staircase runs up against the south wall to a hatch in the ceiling.  A
 second door is set in the east wall, to the left of the eagle, while a
 large portrait of the Emperor hangs opposite.

 The north side of the street is occupied by a large wooden hall.  On
 the south side is a neat single-storey white building (directly south)

 continues eastwards but quickly peters out into a narrow farmtrack as
 it leaves the town, while to the west it runs back towards the town
 centre.

 This seems to be a meeting hall of some sort, with rows of plain
 wooden benches facing a crude stage at the northern end.  It's unclear
 whether this place is intended for religious or secular purposes;
 quite possibly it does duty for both.  The overall effect is decidedly
 gloomy, even though a fair amount of sunlight steals in through the
 unglazed windows and the open doorway to the south.

>get book
 "What have you got there?"  Leela wants to know, as you pick up the
 diary "Do show me!"

>read book
 It appears to be the diary of one Subcenturion Mark Villiers, who
 served as the representative of the Imperial Police Corps on this
 planet in the early twenty-eighth century, about a quarter of a
 millenium ago, when Elysium was newly colonized.  It seems that
 Villiers was posted here to enforce a modicum of imperial law and
 order on the new settlement, but that the settlers proved as difficult
 back then as they have done ever since.

 As you flick over the pages you find a series of accounts of ongoing
 friction between the uncooperative Elders and the increasingly
 frustrated Villiers.  Some of the other natives seemed to have been
 reasonable enough, and as Villiers's account progresses it becomes
 clear that he was becoming increasingly friendly with one young woman
 in particular, but the Elders were consistently obstructive, insisting
 that the maintenance of law on Elysium was their job and theirs alone,
 and no business of the Empire.  Even when news of some petty crime did
 come Villiers's way, the Elders would frustrate every attempt the
 subcenturion made to investigate it.

 On the last few pages the tone becomes even darker.  Villiers
 apparently believed that someone - one of the settlers called Natasha
 with whom he had become quite friendly - had been murdered, and he was
 determined to bring the killer to justice.  The Elders proved
 particularly intransigent, denying that any crime had taken place that
 they weren't perfectly capable of taking care of.  It's clear from the
 diary that this made Villiers increasingly angry: if a murder had been
 committed it was clearly a matter for the imperial authorities, and
 all the settlers, Elders included, were duty-bound to co-operate.

 On the final page, the entry for July 14 2722, the diary concludes
 with the words, "I am now morally certain that Natasha was murdered,
 and I now have a pretty good idea where to find her body and the proof
 I need to bring her killers to justice.  Poor Natasha!  Always too
 much of a free spirit for this narrow little planet, and now she's
 paid the ultimate price for her broad-mindedness and her enquiring
 mind.  But I am determined to bring matters to a head, despite veiled
 threats from the Elders.

 And now, I'm just off to follow up my latest lead; I'll fill in the
 details on my return."

 But it seems Subcenturion Villiers never did return, for there his
 account ends.

 You can smell the cheese.

>show book to leela
 Leela takes the diary off you, and reads through it with a deepening
 frown.  "How sad!" she declares as she reaches the last page, "that
 poor Natasha - she sounds a bit like me, really - I wonder what the
 Elders did to her.  And Mark Villiers, the person who wrote this,
 that's the man whose grave we just found, isn't it?  So we know how he
 ended up.  I wonder if he found justice for Natasha first."

 Alien foliage clogs the ground between the trees that crowd around you
 on every side.  The main trail heads straight off to the north and
 snakes through the trees to the south.  You can't see any side trails
 as such, but apart from the main path, the only gap through the trees
 that looks passable here is the one directly to the west.  It's pretty
 narrow, but you could just squeeze through it.

 The dirt track runs a short way north up to a ridge, just beyond which

 Hollow
 This grassy hollow, about thirty metres across, looks like it might

 Edge of the Forest
 The main north-south track runs wide and straight here.  The trees are
 more widely spaced, so that you could easily wander among them on
 either side of the main track.  To the south they become sparser
 still, indicating that the edge of the forest lies that way.

 Thinning Forest
 Dappled light plays through the sparsely spaced trees that thin out
 even more towards the southeast, where the forest ends.  In principle
 you could walk in any direction amongst these autumnal trees, but one
 direction looks much the same as any other, so you could all too
 easily get lost, except that you know that the way back to the main
 path is to the east, and that there's another path to the northwest.

 "I can't follow you into the town," says Leela, "I daren't be spotted

 you a little wave as you walk away.

 Hillside above the Town
 The grassy hillside slopes gently down towards the small town below,
 which is surrounded by farmland and bordered by a river to the west.

 Inside the Shuttle
 The inside of the shuttle is not exactly spacious; there's room for
 the pilot and three passengers, one beside the pilot and two behind.
 The seats are comfortable enough, but otherwise it's all pretty basic.
 There's not much in front of you except the forward window; the pilot
 has a bank of instruments.

 Sublieutenant Soolin is sitting in the pilot seat.

 Obvious exits: Out

 As you clamber into the flyer you sit yourself down on the front
 passenger seat, next to the pilot.

 "Hello, sir!"  Sublieutenant Soolin greets you, "Does this mean you're
 all done and ready to leave?"

>show diary to soolin
 "Here, take a look at this," you say, handing her the diary.

 She takes the diary and reads through it rapidly, slowing down as she
 reaches the end.  Then she looks up at you with a worried frown as she
 hands it back.  "I wonder what happened to Villiers after that?" she
 asks.

>tell soolin about grave
 "None of the other graves seem to have been marked," you say.

 "Perhaps none of the other markers survived, sir," she suggests.

>tell soolin about helmet
 "I see, sir," she nods.

>show helmet to soolin
 Sublieutenant Soolin glances at the helmet without much interest.

>examine helmet
 It's battered and rusty, and obviously old.  It looks as if it was
 once green, and on the front you can just make out a very faded golden
 eagle.  It looks like it might have been an Imperial Marines helmet,
 but it's certainly not the current pattern.  If the helmet were in
 better condition, it would belong in a military museum.

>tell soolin about tombstone
 "I'm sure that's very interesting, sir," she replies, "but shouldn't
 you be finishing what you came here to do?"

>out

 "Goodbye, sir," Sublieutenant Soolin calls after you.

 Town Centre
 This is the centre of the town, such as it is.  The main street, if it
 can be called a street, runs east and west from here, crossing a track
 that runs north and south.  To the northwest is a market area,
 opposite a large barn on the south side of the street, while to the
 east the street runs between a small white building (on its south
 side) and a large wooden hall (on its north).

 it leaves the town, while to the west it runs back towards the town
 centre.

 Inside the Hall
 This seems to be a meeting hall of some sort, with rows of plain
 wooden benches facing a crude stage at the northern end.  It's unclear
 whether this place is intended for religious or secular purposes;
 quite possibly it does duty for both.  The overall effect is decidedly
 gloomy, even though a fair amount of sunlight steals in through the
 unglazed windows and the open doorway to the south.

 Petroc is pacing up and down on the stage.

 Petroc reaches the end of the stage and turns round.

>show diary to petroc
 "Excuse me," you say.

 "Now what?" he snaps.

 "I found this diary in the forest; I thought you might find it
 interesting," you tell him.

 Petroc hesitates for a moment, then takes the diary from you and reads
 it slowly.  At length, he looks up at you again, and remarks, "If
 you're as clever as you think you are, you should be able guess the
 rest.  This man Villiers poked his nose in where it wasn't welcome.
 He came to a sticky end.  Eventually your people sent someone else
 along to find out what had happened to him.  My ancestors believed
 justice had been done, but yours didn't, so they sent a gang of
 warriors here.  Things quickly got out of hand - some of our young men
 went along to the old town with sticks and stones to chase your
 warriors away, and your warriors retaliated with their weapons of
 terror.  It was a massacre, a terrible bloody massacre, so terrible
 that even your ancestors were ashamed of it.  Anyway, no one wanted
 the old town after that, it had too many bad memories for all of us,
 so we abandoned it, and rebuilt here - but still you wouldn't leave us
 alone."  He pauses, and looks at you with something like pity as he
 hands the diary back to you, "So now you know - all your great empire
 has done for us."

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 "Hello, you're back!"  Leela greets you.

>ask her about federation
 (Leela)
 "What's your view on the Federation?" you enquire.

 "I don't have a view on that," she replies, "How could I?  I know
 virtually nothing about it!".

 You can smell the cheese.

>topics
 You could tell her about yourself, the town, Petroc, the strange green
 structure, the black shuttle, the orange datatab, the plastic bottle,
 the small silver key, the raft, or the white shuttle, or ask her about
 herself, the elders, Elysium, her questions, the stories, the town,
 markets or meetings, old Jeb, the mallet, or the small silver key.

>ask her about the shuttle
 "I found a black shuttle across the river," you tell her, "I don't
 think it should be there - do you happen to know anything about it?"

 Leela frowns, looks away for a moment, and repeatedly clenches and
 unclenches her fists, as if trying to resolve a quandry.  Then at
 length she lets out a heavy sigh and turns back to you, her manner
 suddenly different, as if she has just grown older and taller.

 "Okay," she admits, "There's no point in keeping up this pretence, is
 there?  That's my shuttle you found, and I'm not an Elysian farm-girl,
 as I'm sure you realize by now.  But it's not as bad as you think,
 really it's not.  I'm not a - well, I'm an anthropologist from Earth."
 Before you can protest, she cuts you off with a gesture, saying, "Yes
 - I know - I have no business being here.  But this is about the only
 place in the known galaxy where I can study such a primitive culture
 in the field. so - what happens now?"

 You can smell the cheese.

 (You could ask why she lied before, ask which university she's from,
 ask how long she's been here, say you don't believe her, or show her
 the orange datatab.)

>SAVE
>cf19
 Saved.

>ask leela how long she's been here
 "How long have you been here, Leela?" you want to know.

 "Only a couple of weeks, praefect," she assures you, "Not long enough
 to do any harm to the natives, if that's what you're thinking.  In any
 case, that's the first rule of any anthropologist working in the field
 - don't interfere with the indigenous society you're meant to be
 studying.  So, does that mean I get off lightly?  You could just let
 me go, couldn't you?  So, how about it?"

 (You could ask why she lied before, ask which university she's from,
 ask how long she's been here, say you don't believe her, show her the
 orange datatab, let her go, or arrest her.)

>ask her how long she's been here
 "Are you sure you've only been here a couple of weeks?" you ask.

 "Quite sure," she assures you.

 You can smell the cheese.

 (You could ask why she lied before, ask which university she's from,
 ask how long she's been here, say you don't believe her, show her the
 orange datatab, let her go, or arrest her.)

>show orange datatab to leela
 "So what's this, then?" you ask, showing the orange datatab, "I found
 it in the pocket of what is no doubt your jumpsuit."

 Leela stares down at the tab for a moment, then nods, "Right," she
 agrees, "Obviously that is my jumpsuit, and obviously that is my
 datatab.  Like I said, I'm an anthropologist; it contains my field
 notes.  May I have it back please?"

>tell leela about orange datatab
 "I asked you if you'd let me have my datatab back," she reminds you,
 holding her hand out, "Will you give it to me, please?"

 You can smell the cheese.

>no
 "Certainly not!" you reply, "I'm confiscating this as material
 evidence of your illegal activity on this planet."

 She lays a gentle hand on your arm, and sets her face in an equally
 gentle pleading look, "Please," she begs, "I haven't made a copy, and
 if you don't give it back to me, all my work here will have been
 wasted.  If I'm going to get into terrible trouble, at least don't let
 it be for nothing.  You can give it back to me, can't you?"

>no
 "I'm afraid not," you reply, "It's my clear duty to hang on to it."

 "Very well," she sighs, "So what happens now?"

 (You could ask why she lied before, ask which university she's from,
 ask how long she's been here, say you don't believe her, tell her
 about the orange datatab, let her go, or arrest her.)

>tell her about orange datatab
 "You say this datatab contains your field notes," you say, "and so it
 does - but they aren't the field notes of an anthropologist, they're
 the field notes of a Federation spy called called Anita Johnson."

 "If you know that then you've obviously found a way to read them," she
 replies stonily, "in which case you know too much..."

 Without further warning she leaps at you, her hands clasping for your
 throat.

 Leela makes a grab for your throat but you manage to throw her off.

 "Is that the best you can do?  You're a dead man!" she sneers.

>undo
 Taking back one turn: "tell her about orange datatab".

 even more towards the southeast, where the forest ends.  In principle
 you could walk in any direction amongst these autumnal trees, but one
 direction looks much the same as any other, so you could all too
 easily get lost, except that you know that the way back to the main

 Leela is standing nearby.

 You can smell the cheese.

>let her go
 "All right, Leela, you can go," you tell her, "Just as long as you
 pack up and go at once, and promise never to return."

 "Oh, thank you!" she beams, "But are you sure?  I can go, just like
 that?  Really?"

>yes
 "Yes, you can go," you nod, "You don't seem to have done any real harm
 here, and what the Empire is really concerned about is preventing any
 unauthorized settlers staying, so if you go now, we'll say no more
 about it."

 "I'll go now," she nods, "And thanks, offworlder, you're a really
 decent guy."  So saying, she smiles at you and gives you a little peck
 on the cheek.

 You spend the next half hour or so helping her first to pack her
 belongings together and carry them back across the river to her
 shuttle, and then to dismantle and stow the tarpaulin.  Finally, you
 bid her farewell, and stand watching to make sure she does actually
 board the black shuttle, before retreating across the field to get out
 of the way for its take off.  The shuttle takes off a few seconds
 later, and you watch as it rises from the field, and then darts up
 into the sky faster than an eagle taking flight, until it is no more
 than a black dot you quickly lose sight of.

 Since Leela took her inflatable raft with her, you summon
 Sublieutenant Soolin to come and collect you in your shuttle, which
 lands in the field only a minute or two later.  Her astonished
 reaction at your clemency when you explain what's just happened does
 not bode well your superiors' reaction - or your future career.
