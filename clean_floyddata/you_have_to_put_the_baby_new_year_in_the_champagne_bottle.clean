 I was driving home when the storm front hit me. I have never seen such
 rainfall. I could barely see the headlights, and only flashes of
 lightning gave me brief glimpses of the road ahead so I could prevent
 the car from swerving off the road.

 The GPS lost the signal and at some point I must have taken a wrong
 turn, for I was soon in an unpaved road I wasn't familiar with. The
 tires skid on the dirt that was quickly turning into deeper and deeper
 mud, and I knew stopping now would most likely mean getting hopelessly
 stuck.

 The road ended in the yard of a large and old house. I was trying to
 turn the car around when it stopped in a puddle in the middle of the
 driveway.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mansion Courtyard, in the car</span>
 The mansion was old, built perhaps in the 19th century. It seemed to
 be relatively well-kept, not counting a few missing roof tiles, rusty
 rain gutters about to fall apart and the need for a new layer of
 paint.

 The GPS was still offline and the car was stuck in the muddy driveway.

 The front entrance was near, right outside the car.

>examine me

 I was not very happy about the situation, to put it mildly.

>examine gps

 The GPS unit said it didn't have a connection to any satellites.

>inventory

 I was carrying the business clothes (being worn) and a cell phone.

>examine car

 The car was hopelessly stuck. I needed a tow truck.

>inventory

 I was carrying the business clothes (being worn) and a cell phone.

>examine cell

 There was no reception.

>examine business clothes

 I was wearing straight pants and a short jacket.

>out

 I got out of the car and ran to the porch. The spurt couldn't have
 taken more than five seconds but I was already soaking wet from the
 pouring rain and my shoes dirty with mud.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Front Porch</span>
 The porch had a fairly large cover but it wasn't large enough to
 keep the rainfall out. The rain was still slashing against me and
 several times gusts of wind almost knocked me over.

 The front door was closed and I couldn't see a doorbell.

>knock on door

 At first there was no answer. I knocked again, and after a while a
 small older woman opened the door.

 "Yes, dear?"

 (I could have asked her about the mansion, herself, or using a phone;
 or told her about myself, the car or the storm.)

>kiss old woman

 I don't need to use the word "kiss".

>dance

 I don't need to use the word "dance".

>ask old woman about the mansion

 "I'm very sorry to come knocking at your door so unexpectedly. This is
 quite a mansion you have here. Are you the lady of the house?"

 "I am she," she replied briefly.

>ask woman about mansion

 "You rarely see houses like this,"

 She looked impatient. "Our home is not open for tourists, young lady."

 "Oh no, I didn't mean to imply..." I stuttered.

>again

 "You rarely see houses like this,"

 She looked impatient. "Our home is not open for tourists, young lady."

 "Oh no, I didn't mean to imply..." I stuttered.

>ask her about herself

 (assuming you meant the old woman)
 "My name is Lauren. Whom do I have the honour to address?"

 She had a puzzled look on her face. "Lauren? I don't think we know a
 Lauren."

>tell her about the car

 (assuming you meant the old woman)
 "Sorry to bother you at this hour, but the weather caught me off guard
 and my car is stuck in your driveway," I said.

 "I see," she said without changing expression.

>tell woman about phone

 The old woman didn't seem particularly interested in what I had to say
 about that.

>ask woman about phone

 "If you have a landline, I'd like to borrow your phone to call a tow
 truck or a taxi so I could get home. My cell phone has no reception
 here."

 She looked at me from head to toe and seemed to sharpen up. "Yes, I
 suppose we can't leave you there in the rain. Please do come in."

 She took a step back inside the mansion and held the door open for me.


>in


 <span class="floydstyle em">Living Room</span>
 The house looked like something out of a Jane Austen book. The
 furniture was antique, or at least very skillfully made replicas. The
 air was heavy and smelled of dust. It must had been a while since the
 room had been properly cleaned.
   There was a phone on a side table.

 The old woman sat down on one of the chairs. "Oh dear, you're quite
 wet," she said. "I wonder if..."

 She looked conflicted for a while. "Yes, Elizabeth's clothes should
 fit you. Perhaps you could go upstairs and change into something dry.
 It's the second door to the left."

>use phone

 I don't need to use the word "use".

>examine phone

 Which phone do you mean, the telephone or the cell phone?

>examine telephone

 Although the dark red colour of the landline phone matched the decor
 it still looked out of place here.

>call tow truck

 The landline was dead. Not even a dial tone.

>ask lady about phone

 "Please, dear, you're dripping water all over our carpet," she said.
 "Go upstairs and change and we'll talk."

>drip

 I don't need to use the word "drip".

>go up

 I walked up the creaking stairs.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Upstairs Hallway</span>
 The hallway was decorated with yellowing wallpaper and a carpet that
 had already seen its best days. I could have went in to the bedroom as
 the old lady had instructed or back down to the living room.

>examine wallpaper

 It wasn't important.

>examine carpet

 It wasn't important.

>enter bedroom

 I don't need to use the word "bedroom".

>in


 <span class="floydstyle em">Bedroom</span>
 The room seemed to belong to a teenaged girl, although it was very
 ascetic. There was a simple bed, a dressing table, and a bookshelf
 with assorted novels.
   A massive wardrobe was standing on the wall opposite the window.

>examine novels

 It wasn't important.

>examine bookshelf

 It wasn't important.

>look under bed

 It wasn't important.

>look at table

 It wasn't important.

>examine wardrobe

 The wardrobe looked massively heavy. It was made of thick, dark wood.

>look behind wardrobe

 I didn't find anything behind the wardrobe.

>look under wardobe

 I don't need to use the word "wardobe".

>look under wardrobe

 I didn't find anything under the wardrobe.

>push wardrobe

 I couldn't move the wardrobe.

>lie on bed

 It wasn't important.

>open wardrobe

 Opened.

 Hanging inside the wardrobe was a row of dresses.

>examine dresses

 It was almost as if no-one had opened the wardrobe in several decades.
 The dresses were all old-fashioned and conservative with subdued
 colors. They were dusty but otherwise clean.

>smell dresses


>touch dresses

 I don't need to use the word "touch".

>Put the dresses on the flesh.

 I don't need to use the word "flesh".

>wear dress

 I was not holding those.

>get dress

 I needed to take off the wet clothes first.

>remove clothes

 I got out of my soaked clothes. The wet fabric kept clinging to my
 skin and left me shivering.

>out

 I was certainly not about to wander around the mansion in my
 underwear.

>examine underwear

 I don't need to use the word "underwear".

>examine me

 Having dry clothes on helped a little, but not much.

>get dress

 I looked through the dresses in the wardrobe and picked a plain brown
 one that was the least obviously old-fashioned. I tried to brush most
 of the dust away and then put it on. I didn't feel comfortable wearing
 other people's socks so I decided to go barefoot.

 The dress fit me quite well, although it was perhaps a bit too big. I
 tried to force myself not to feel self-conscious and rather be happy
 to have something dry to wear.

>out


 <span class="floydstyle em">Upstairs Hallway</span>
 The hallway was decorated with yellowing wallpaper and a carpet that
 had already seen its best days. I could have went in to the bedroom as
 the old lady had instructed or back down to the living room.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle em">Living Room</span>
 The house looked like something out of a Jane Austen book. The
 furniture was antique, or at least very skillfully made replicas. The
 air was heavy and smelled of dust. It must had been a while since the
 room had been properly cleaned.
   The old woman was sitting on a chair, watching me.
   There was a phone on a side table.

 When I walked down the stairs it seemed like the old woman's gaze was
 glassy and she was looking through me.

 "Oh there you are, Elizabeth. Your father and I have missed you."

 Before I had time to say anything over my surprise, the lights went
 out. The woman walked carefully by the mantel, picked up a box of
 matches and started to light candles around the room. She passed one
 of the candles to me.

 "Could you be a dear and go see your father upstairs, Elizabeth? He
 always knew what to do in situations like this. He should be in the
 study. The door is right across the stairs, you remember that."

 (I could have asked her about Elizabeth, father, using the telephone,
 or electricity; or told her about myself.)

>tell her about myself

 (assuming you meant the old woman)
 "I'm not Elizabeth. Who's Elizabeth?"

 "Oh Elizabeth, stop fooling around," she replied with a weak smile.

>ask her about using the telephone

 (assuming you meant the old woman)
 "Can I use the telephone, please?"

 "Do you want to call your friends, Elizabeth? Although I think the
 weather has cut the phone lines."

>ask woman about Elizabeth

 "I'm not Elizabeth. Who's Elizabeth?"

 "Oh Elizabeth, stop fooling around," she replied with a weak smile.

>ask her about electricity

 (assuming you meant the old woman)
 "Do these power outages happen often?" I asked.

 "Oh, not very often, not at all," she said. "But it's all right, your
 father is prepared for everything."

>ask woman about father

 "I'm sorry, did you say my "father"?"

 "Don't worry, your father will know what to do," she just said.

>scream

 It was a desperate situation, but I managed to keep my emotions in
 check.

>cry

 I don't need to use the word "cry".

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle em">Upstairs Hallway</span>
 I was back upstairs, and the door leading inside the study was right
 in front of me.

>in

 The door was locked.

>examine door

 Study door looked just like I expected.

>knock on door

 I knocked on the door, and almost immediately an old man opened it. He
 was grey as ashes, just like the woman, but while she was lethargic,
 he was jitterish and full of energy.

 "Yes, what is it? Who are you? It doesn't matter, the power's out
 again and I'm at a very delicate phase right now. Be a sport and go
 downstairs to the cellar and turn on the diesel generator."

 Before I had time to say anything he slammed the door shut.

>again

 I knocked again, but there was no answer.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle em">Living Room</span>
 The house looked like something out of a Jane Austen book. The
 furniture was antique, or at least very skillfully made replicas. The
 air was heavy and smelled of dust. It must had been a while since the
 room had been properly cleaned.
   The old woman was sitting on a chair, watching me.
   There was a phone on a side table.

 "So, what did your father say?" the old woman said.

 "He said to turn on the generator. And he's not my father, lady.
 Where's the cellar?"

 She glanced at a door next to the staircase, which must lead down to
 the cellar. "You were always warned not to go to the cellar, weren't
 you, Elizabeth? Remember, when you were young?"

>kill lady

 Venting your frustrations on the old woman wouldn't have accomplished
 much.

>no

 Better start with a verb.

>remember being young

 I don't need to use the word "remember".

>ask her about cellar

 I don't need to use the word "cellar".

>say no

 I don't need to use the word "say".

>examine door

 I didn't see that.

>examine chair

 It wasn't important.

>push chair

 It wasn't important.

>import chair

 I don't need to use the word "import".

>examine lady

 The woman was small and frail, and her thin face was grey as dust. She
 was wearing an old-fashioned grey dress that the aristocracy would
 have worn a hundred years ago.
 .

>remove dress

 The dress wasn't quite my style, but I didn't have any options either.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle em">Cellar</span>
 The cellar had apparently been used as a wine cellar. The shelves
 were empty now. Water was trickling down to the floor but there didn't
 seem to be immediate danger of flooding.
   Otherwise the space was dominated by a large diesel generator.

>examine generator

 It looked similar to what my grandparents had in their farm, except
 this was much bigger. It was probably large enough to provide
 electricity to the whole mansion, and to the neighbouring houses as
 well.

>examine water

 It wasn't important.

>switch on generator

 I turned the generator on. After some coughing and wheezing its engine
 started running and lights flickered on in the cellar.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle em">Living Room</span>
 The house looked like something out of a Jane Austen book. The

 The lights were on in the living room, so I put the candle down on a
 table.

>use phone

>tell woman about father



 I couldn't take that.

>ask woman about electricity

 "Do these power outages happen often?" I asked.

 "Oh, not very often, not at all," she said. "But it's all right, your
 father is prepared for everything."


 I don't need to use the word "floyd".

>call for help

 The landline was dead. Not even a dial tone.


 "I'm sorry, did you say my "father"?"

 "Don't worry, your father will know what to do," she just said.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle em">Upstairs Hallway</span>
 I was back upstairs, and the door leading inside the study was right
 in front of me.

>in


 <span class="floydstyle em">Study</span>
 Bookshelves lined the walls, full of books that had titles in
 languages I didn't recognize. Behind a mahogany writing desk, filled
 with books, papers and parchments, sat an old man, frevently writing
 on a notepad or looking up something from the books.
   A curious machine was embedded in one of the walls.
   Heavy curtains covered the windows.
 The old man was sitting behind the desk, scribbling on a notepad.

 "It's you," he said as he noticed me. "Now who did you say you were
 again? You must excuse me, I'm very busy with the experiment.'"

 (I could ask him about the woman, Elizabeth, or the experiment; or
 tell him about the generator, myself, or the storm.)

>examine machine

 The machine was a jumbled mess of wood, iron, leather and brass. Pipes
 and wires were strewn across the contraption, connected to meters that
 didn't say anything meaningful.

>ask him about the woman

 (assuming you meant the old man)
 "Why is the woman downstairs insisting that I'm Elizabeth? Who is she
 anyway?"

 Suddenly he looked very melancholic. "Oh, Elizabeth... She was our
 daughter. She died too young, and my wife has been... ill ever since."
 He pauses to wipe his eye with a handkerchief. "But when we moved to
 this house and when I discovered this library, there's hope! We will
 soon be together again!"

>kill father

 Venting your frustrations on the old man wouldn't have accomplished
 much.

>ask him about machine

 (assuming you meant the old man)
 "Uh... what exactly are you doing here?" I asked carefully. There was
 obviously something not quite right here.

 "This, my lady, is how I will bring back my dear Elizabeth!" His eyes
 gleamed with crazy. "I found these books, and the incantations..."

>ask him about elizabeth

 (assuming you meant the old man)
 "I think your wife needs professional help," I said.

 "Help? She needs Elizabeth back!" he exclaimed. "I'm so close... so
 close..."

>SWING MOOD
>ask him about phone

 (assuming you meant the old man)
 Which exactly do you mean, the cell phone or using the phone?

>ask man about using the phone

 The old man didn't seem to know anything about that.

>tell him about the generator

 (assuming you meant the old man)
 "I managed to turn on the generator."

 "Yes, I noticed. Thank you," he replied.

>tell him about myself

 (assuming you meant the old man)
 "I'm here only by chance," I explained. "My car got stuck in the
 mud.."

 "Yes, yes," he interrupted. "As long as you don't bother my
 experiment, I don't really care."

>ask man for gratuity

 I don't need to use the word "gratuity".

>tell him about storm

 (assuming you meant the old man)
 "There's a huge storm outside! It... doesn't feel natural," I said.

 "I have no time for small talk about the weather young lady," he
 replied.

>bother experiment

 I don't need to use the word "bother".

>ask man about books

 The old man didn't seem to know anything about that.

>break machine

 Venting your frustrations on the contraption wouldn't have
 accomplished much.

>examine curtains

 The curtains were heavy and thick, blocking all light.

>open curtains

 I opened the heavy satin curtains and saw that they were covering not
 a window but glass doors to a balcony. Behind the doors was a view
 that on any other day would have been a magnificent sight. Only now I
 realised that the house was on a high hill that overlooked London
 which, at the moment, was in the midst of what seemed like a
 hurricane.

 Entire city blocks were on fire. There were no lights on in the city,
 only lightning and the fires revealed the horrifying scene.

 The clouds above the city were moving in disturbing patterns.
 Something was out there, about to emerge form the darkness.

 (I could tell the old man about London.)

>tell man about london

 "Look at what's happening to the city! Curse your damned experiments!"

 He raised his head to view the scene. He looked at London in disbelief
 and he seemed to experience a brief moment of sanity.

 "No... It's impossible! Did I write the wrong glyphs... or was the
 voltage too high? Or..."

 "What's happening here? What is this storm?"

 "I... all I wanted was to bring Elizabeth back... You mustn't judge
 me! Something has went terribly wrong," he cried.

 He rummaged through a box next to the apparatus and pulled out a small
 axe. "We must end this now! Here, take this hatchet and climb to the
 roof. I've set up an antenna there that broadcasts the subspatial
 messages. I can't stop it from here, you must cut down the antenna to
 make this right."

 "What? I don't..." I tried to protest, but he shoved the hatchet to
 me. "Go! Now!"

>examine hatchet

 The axe was small and slightly rusty, with ornate carvings in the
 blade.

>examine carvings

 I don't need to use the word "carvings".

>read books

 I couldn't do that with desk.

>hit machine with hatchet

 Venting your frustrations on the contraption wouldn't have
 accomplished much.

   A curious machine was embedded in one of the walls.
   A view of London is visible through the balcony door.

>open door

 I couldn't do that with balcony doors.

 I didn't see that.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Balcony</span>
 The balcony was made of white marble. Rain fell on it from the roof
 like from a waterfall.
   An iron ladder led up to the roof.

 Soon after closing the balcony doors behind me I heard a bang from
 inside the mansion.

 I climbed past the gutter and saw what must have been the antenna, a
 gnarled wooden staff, on top of the roof's ridge. The rain was pouring
 down in torrents and staying on the steps took all my effort.

 Clambering up to the antenna I glanced behind me and saw horrifying a
 dark mass was emerging from the storm clouds over London; it was
 larger than the city itself, and revealed more of itself every second
 as it descended from the skies. Even the light from lightning would
 not penetrate the total blackness of its form. Only its grotesque
 shape could be seen as a silhouette against the dark sky.

 An overwhelming sense of dread and despair overcame me. I screamed,
 screamed until my lungs were empty of air.

>scream

 And I did scream. I screamed my mind empty of thoughts that once were
 human but now claimed by the Devourer, the Destroyer, the god of
 Despair.

 I gazed upon the beast and visions of cities long dead filled my

 unaware of my presence.

 The vision faded away and was replaced by the monstrous being,
 revealing its horrifying face. As it devoured London, it devoured my
 sanity, and for a fleeting moment I wished for death before dementia
 claimed its victim.

 The GPS lost the signal and at some point I must have taken a wrong

 I struck the antenna with the axe once, twice, three times. It broke
 and fell down the roof, but it was naive to think it would have had
 any effect. Was it even the old man who had summoned the Devourer into
 this world?

 It mattered not: the damage was done, and nothing could stop the
 inevitable. I laughed at the foolishness of my efforts, I laughed when
 the rain swept me off the roof and into the merciful hands of Death.

 The caretaker grimaces. "A year since you visited, you say? Some
 hooligans smashed the mausoleum up a month back. Since then, well, I'm

 "Haunted?"

 The caretaker grimaces. "A year since you visited, you say? Some
 hooligans smashed the mausoleum up a month back. Since then, well, I'm
 the only one who'll go near it. And I don't care to stay long. See for
 yourself if you like, and I'll collect you in the morning."

 Poor Thurnley. No rest even in the tomb.

 Oof. Your head. You remember very little about last night, but
 apparently you had an extremely good time at the party.

 Judging from how dark the room is, you're guessing it's fairly late in
 the afternoon. But all you want to do is take care of your hangover
 and go home and hide from the world for the rest of the day.

 There is a mouse hole in the southeast corner of the room, next to the

 A Happy New Year's new Puzzle-Venture, from the brand new New Years
 brand by SoftSoft

 6/12N)

>about


 This puzzle-game is a SoftSoft production. SoftSoft, if you haven't
 heard of them before, is a company dedicated to bringing you the very
 best in game-wares. This particular game-ware is the latest in their
 illustrious "You Have to Put the Noun in the Other Noun" series,
 starting with "You Have to Put the Ball in the Cup" and continuing on
 from there. They have a variety of products and most of their
 interactive productions can be found at Glorious Trainwrecks
 ([<a href="http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com">LINK</A>]).

 Expert text adventurers can probably figure out the winning moves from
 the title, but if you are new to this sort of game, know that USE
 generally does not work in these games and you have to be carrying
 something to put it in something else. Also, please note the NEW YEARS
 FUN FACTS that pop up after every turn. There are about thirteen to
 fifteen of the suckers and they are an educational fun-feature that
 the whole family can enjoy!

 This game was coded and written by Molly G. Many of the New Years Fun
 Facts were written by posters on the Truth and Beauty Bombs forums
 (TaBB for short). Special thanks to posters Dezro, Kier, Just Gene,
 Daniel, Thorsby, and any other contributers to this micro-project that
 may have been forgotten or left out of the final game.

>examine baby


 Well, actually, it's really more of a Baby New Year <span class="floydstyle em">replica</span>.
 The real ones are much too expensive for our budget this year.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: New Year's Eve is the favorite holiday of actor
 Joseph Gordon-Levitt! His least favorite? Arbor Day!

>examine bottle


 A fancy bottle of champagne.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: New Years Eve was originally a pagan holiday
 celebrating the god of getting completely wasted. However it has been
 co-opted by Christianity and nowadays most people celebrate New Years
 to commemorate the birth of Jesus' brother Mesus.

>examine me


 You look great! Just concentrate on the game.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: In Japan, the traditional New Years treat is
 mochi, a cake made of rice paste. However, the secret ingredient isn't
 ground-up moon rabbits, as some may have you believe. Instead, it's
 actually Tang.

>jump


 Sorry, but that's not how you solve this new New Year adventure.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: The tradition of kissing the closest person come
 midnight was originally celebrated every night, until everyone just
 got really tired of the whole thing and abolished the practice outside
 New Years.

>take baby


 Taken.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: Dick Clark isn't actually dead! He sleeps beneath
 Times Square, until a New Year's Eve emergency awakens him from his
 slumber.

>drink champagne


 You can't actually have that! It's for the sake of the puzzle, stupid.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: Did you know that New Years often takes place on
 the first day of the year? It's true!

>kiss baby


 You can only do that to something animate.

>break baby


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: What do you think is the song most played on New
 Years? Auld Lang Syne right? You'd be wrong, though. It's actually
 Suzy Snowflake.

>examine baby


 Well, actually, it's really more of a Baby New Year <span class="floydstyle em">replica</span>.
 The real ones are much too expensive for our budget this year.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: In Scotland it is unlucky for a household if a
 woman is the first to enter on New Years. That is why nearly 90% of
 Scots women identify as genderqueer from Christmas to the Epiphany.

>break bottle


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: The Persian New Year is called Nowruz, sometimes
 transliterated as Nawruz.

>xyzzy


 Have you been hitting the sour juice a bit too hard? That's not how
 you solve this New Years puzzle.

 NEW YEARS FUN FACT: New Year's is a popular time to think about the
 future, and reminisce upon the past. That's why so many people
 celebrate it by drinking until they pass out!

>put baby in bottle


 You put the Baby New Year into the champagne bottle.

 Oh my gosh! You solved the puzzle! You're the greatest New Years
 partier ever! You are sooo cool! Like, the super coolest! I bet babes
 and/or studs swarm over you every New Years!

 C-can I touch you?

 You never blew up your parents house, Marsha.Why don't you start at

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden Area (Actually hell)</span>
 Paul's Parents were rather fond of this small pool. In their time, it
 wasn't filled with bubbling green acid, though. It is surrounded by
 some deck chair (made of bones). The eastern and western garden walls
 are overgrown with undergrowth, made of screaming faces, which is
 quite distracting. A glass door leads north to the kitchen. This
 wasn't necessary for the southern southern wall, which is quite high,
 because it borders on a Golf course (Well, it did on Earth. Who knows
 what horrors await you beyond? Well, Wally might).

 A three-headed Cerberus sits atop the southern wall. That's new.

 Wally floats around here.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

 "Hey Alex" says Uncle Wally. "How the hell have you been?"

  "What is this? Where am I?"

 "Hell, of course. You're gay, remember?"

 "You mean I'm not here because I was a sociopath and killed a lot of
 people for base motives?"

 "Could be. What do I know? I'm stuck here with you! It's my hell,
 too."

>ask wally about cerberus


 "So what's the deal here? Are we doomed to be here for all eternity?"
 "Wouldn't make much of a game now would it?" Wally points a thumb at
 the house. "You can get to purgatory if you face the darkest scenes
 from your past in the house."

 You roll your eyes. "What is this - Twine?"

 "C'mon, I thought gays like talking about their feelings."

 "I'm also a sociopath."

 "Sorry, humans are solely defined by their sexual orientation."

 "That's just sad."

>examine wally


 Paul's Uncle Wally, who bears a striking resemblance to Stalin with
 his "stache and soldier's jacket, stands here.. He gives you a
 patronizing smile. Sadly, he doesn't have the knife sticking from his
 back, as you wish he would.

>examine cerberus


 It's a three-headed monstrosity, though somewhat cute The leftmost
 head growls and looks rather smart, the middle head spits fire and
 looks rather dumb, the third will read Twilight at anyone who comes to
 close as a warning, before switching to YouTube comments.

 It bubbles most charmingly with venomous looking green acid.

 That's not something you can enter.

 "What keeps me from killing you, again?"

 "I'm your spirit guide for this!" Wally floats over to the door and
 unlocks it. Great, your Vergil is a total ass.

>talk to wally


 "My past sucks! Why don't I just stay here?"

 "You could, but there's nothing here to do except maybe grab a bone
 from the chairs and throw them at the Cerberus. He's gotten quite good
 at catching them, too."

>take bone


 You collect a single bone from one of the chairs. Sadly, it doesn't
 collapse.

>throw bone at cerberus


 (the bone at Cerberus)
 You toss the bone at Cerberus, and the middle, fire-breathing head
 catches it happily. The left head looks at it with contempt.

>take bone


 You collect a single bone from one of the chairs. Sadly, it doesn't
 collapse.

>go north


 (first opening the glass door)
 "Ah, remember how you broke your mothers favorite vase? How sad she
 was? Do you feel that - the first time your parents where disappointed
 in you? It wasn't the last time you disappointed them, was it? Do you
 think they'd still be disappointed in you? If only you could
 REASSEMBLE it, maybe you could make some peace with your past."

 "Yeah, my parents pretty much sucked."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The main feature of this room is the impressive glass door, which
 leads south, to the pool. All benches and counters are empty.

 The shards of a broken vase lie on the kitchen counter.

 Wally arrives from the south.

>examine vase


 Some of these look rather sharp.

>reassemble vase


 With tears in your eyes, you remember how angry mum was. Soon, you
 have reassembled the vase. You feel a little better.

>examine vase


 You see nothing special about Vase.

>talk to wally


 "Hey, if Paul's not here that means he's not death, right? Or he's
 gone to heaven. Both good news."

 "Yeah, my useless nephew escaped Mercury. He even took in that
 Venusian Warrior Woman from the last game. They share an apartment.
 But I don't think she's that good at cleaning. She'd need a real man
 to sort her out. Oh, yeah, and *mumble*

 "Ah, this room is highly symbolic. See, your living room was once a
 busy and bustling center of this house. But in your memories, it's
 stale and empty. I wonder what that symbolizes?"

 "Stuff a hyperlink in it. What's with the teddy?"

 "Maybe you need to reconnect to your childhood? Try hugging it or
 something."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living room</span>
 This is a spacious, cozy room. It once was busy and always kinda
 untidy. In hell, all that's left are the two couches, covered in white
 plastic wrapping.

 On one of the couches sits your old, childhood teddy bear.

 Wally arrives from the south.

>kick bear


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine bear


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine wrapping


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine teddy


 You used to love him, but that was a long time ago. After a while, he
 really got on your nerves and you switched to new toys and never
 looked back. You remember fondly how your violent tendencies first
 manifested around him.

>kick teddy


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>hit teddy


 As always in these games, you need something sharp!"

>hug teddy


 You gather up the old teddy in your arms. His furs still feels kinda
 prickly and artificial. It reminds you of the feather boa of a
 cross-dresser you used to date in high school. Wait, these aren't
 childhood memories at all. Abort, abort you quietly think to yourself.
 He had the nicest clothes, though. "Hey, hey" says Uncle Wally, "stop
 stroking that teddy like that!"
 With a sigh, you focus back on your childhood memories of your teddy.
 Good times. You feel a little better. The teddy disappears.

 Wally pats you on your back. "I feel like we've come a long way
 together, Alex. Now there is just one final step. You have to face
 what's possibly your worst memory."

 "Dying?"

 "No, the other one."

 "Almost being eaten by a kraken?"

 "No, your coming out, dammit!"

 "Oh yeah, that kinda sucked."

 "To forgive yourself, you have to forgive your dad. Why not give him a
 hug too, hm?"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cemetery</span>
 This looks like a cheap 50s movie set. There's a lot of fog in the
 background, and the rocks and plants look somewhat shi- er- shoddy.
 Two prominent gravestones frame  the scene.

 Your dad stands here, shotgun in the crook of his arm, watching your
 younger self dig.

 Your younger self, 17 or 18, stands here, digging his own grave. He
 seems unperturbed and even whistles a merry tune.

 Wally arrives from below.

 (your younger self)
 The scene is almost insubstantial. It's odd, you don't remember
 clearly what happened. Only that you escaped somehow. Maybe the things
 here can make you remember?

 You give your confused father a big old hug.

 "I'm sorry, Dad, I'm so sorry for everything I said and did..."

 He pats you on the back. "It's okay, son, it's okay. I'm so glad you
 came around to my point of view in the end."

 You hold him some more for an answer.

 "No, really, dad. You were right all... all along. I'll go to

 "Well, I can blow stuff up and that gives me confidence."

 Wally just shakes his head.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cemetery</span>
 This looks like a cheap 50s movie set. There's a lot of fog in the
 background, and the rocks and plants look somewhat shi- er- shoddy.
 Two prominent gravestones frame  the scene.

 Your dad stands here, shotgun in the crook of his arm, watching your
 younger self dig.

 Your younger self, 17 or 18, stands here, digging his own grave. He
 seems unperturbed and even whistles a merry tune.

 Wally arrives from below.

>examine dad


 Mum was accepting, but as he marched you on the field that day you had
 some small inkling he might be less than happy.

>come back


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>blow up dad


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>cut dad


 The scene is almost insubstantial. It's odd, you don't remember
 clearly what happened. Only that you escaped somehow.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   dynamite
   a shard
   a bone

>light dynamite


 This dangerous act would achieve little.

>take vesh


 You can't see any such thing.

>take gravestone


 Which do you mean, Vonathan Vask's gravestone or The gravestone of
 parser based IF?

>take vask


 You heave it high over your head!

>throw gravestone


 (Vonathan Vask's gravestone)
 The insubstantiality returns.

 Dropped.

 BONK!

 Patricide - never gets old, does it?

 Young you looks at you. "Hey, thanks man!"

 "Don't mention it."

 He narrows his eyes at you quizzically. "Hey, are you me from the
 future or something?"

 "Or something. It's really complicated."

 "It's really not!" shouts Wally from the background. "You're just a
 figment of his imagination, well not his, but this place's, well, a
 place obviously can't have an imagination, so er..."

 "Complicated. Moving along."

 "So, you're me at forty, eh?"

 "Thirty-five" you say, somewhat hurt. Maybe you should look at that
 skin cream Paul always wants you to wear. Once you're alive again,
 that is.

 "And is it worth it? All this trouble I mean?"

 Your play around with the wedding ring on your finger for a moment.
 "Sure. Just hang in there."

 Young you nods, then begins to fade, "Oh!" he says, slapping his
 forehead, "I nearly forgot! They key to the cart, it's in your heart!"

 "Thanks!" you say, slightly confused.

>open heart


 That's not something you can open.

 Wally floats around here.

>look in heart


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine heart


 You can't see it, it's inside your chest.

>take heart


 That seems to be a part of yourself.

>take key


 You can't see any such thing.

>cut heart


 You slice into your chest, and what do you know - the key *was* in
 your heart all along!

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 A small hallway, brightly lit by a row of burning human skulls. Dark
 wooden stairs lead upwards, and a doorframe opens east into the Living
 Room. A small door under the stairs lead into a storage closet.
 (Referred to by Paul only as "The Potter Room")

 Wally arrives from above.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living room</span>
 This is a spacious, cozy room. It once was busy and always kinda
 untidy. In hell, all that's left are the two couches, covered in white
 plastic wrapping.

 Wally arrives from the west.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The main feature of this room is the impressive glass door, which
 leads south, to the pool. All benches and counters are empty.

 Wally arrives from the north.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden Area (Actually hell)</span>
 Paul's Parents were rather fond of this small pool. In their time, it
 wasn't filled with bubbling green acid, though. It is surrounded by
 some deck chair (made of bones). The eastern and western garden walls
 are overgrown with undergrowth, made of screaming faces, which is
 quite distracting. A glass door leads north to the kitchen. This
 wasn't necessary for the southern southern wall, which is quite high,
 because it borders on a Golf course (Well, it did on Earth. Who knows
 what horrors await you beyond? Well, Wally might).

 A three-headed Cerberus sits atop the southern wall. That's getting
 old.

 Wally arrives from the north.

>push wally into pool


 You can't see any such thing.

 That would be less than courteous.

 The fire breathing head deftly catches the dynamite in its mouth! The
 left head gives him a condescending look before the whole hellhound
 explodes! Wally tries to dodge a huge chunk, but stumbles and falls,
 flailing, into the acid! He slowly dissolves, like all bigotry might
 do over time, hopefully.

 He bubbles something through mouthfuls of acid that sounds like :
 "I'll be back!"

 You can't go that way.

>climb wall


 You scramble over the wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Golf course</span>
 You are at the foot of a small, sloping hill, the lawn of human
 fingers neatly cut. You can go eastwards, uphill. The wall of Pauls
 garden is here.

 You can see Golf cart (closed) here.

>open cart


 It seems to be locked.

>open cart with key


 You unlock Golf cart.

>enter cart


 You can't get into the closed Golf cart.

>open cart


 You open Golf cart.

>kiss cart


 Keep your mind on the game.

>enter cart


 You get into Golf cart.

>drive e


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle i">Hilltop</span> (in Golf cart)
 You are on top of one of the innumberable volcanic mounds of the
 hellish golf course. Volcanic hills, where the souls of the damned are
 tortured, strech into infinity. The only interesting part seems to be
 a huge gate to the ne.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle i">At the Gate</span> (in Golf cart)
 There is a huge, golden gate before you. It is very securely locked
 with a huge padlock.

>examine padlock


 Hm, you'd wager that Wally had the only key to that gate. Looks like
 you'll be stuck in hell forever. (Hint : You aren't.)

>go north


 (first opening Golden Gate)
 You step on it and the golf cart speeds up to a breakneck 30 miles an
 hour! You crash through the gate easily, and speed along a foggy road
 towards a white light. A woman waves to you from the wayside eagerly.
 "STOP! COME BACK! I represent your mother issues!"


 But you can't stop, you're racing towards reincarnation, to maybe save
 your husband, and you step on it eagerly and then the white light
 surrounds you and ...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Above Paul</span>
 Paul's face is the size of Mount Rushmore, his eyes the size of tunnel
 openings, if tunnel openings came in a dreamy green.

 The world seems oddly  compoundy, and there's a buzzing in your ears.

 After a few moments of disorientation, you realize you are in a
 gargantuan plane cabin, or you are very small. For the latter theory
 speaks the fact that right before you, there's Paul, his face the size
 of Mount Rushmore, his eyes the size of tunnel openings, if tunnel
 openings came in a dreamy green.

 Right next to him sits a guy in a black suit with a thin, ginger
 moustache. That must be the assassin allright. You could fly over
 there, to the east, or fly down Paul.

>fly down Paul


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>SAVE
>cf7
 %% Enter a save filename to write:
 Ok.

>examine me


 You are a normal housefly! Must be all the bad karma you accumulated
 for killing dozens of people and lying about liking all Paul's nerd
 stuff.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Assassin's face</span>
 The guy has an evil face. He also doesn't seem to notice you.

>kill assassin


 You can't see any such thing.

>bite face


 You can't see any such thing.

>go down


 You see the Assassin lean over to Paul, and his hands moves over your
 husband's coffee for a moment. He says "Excuse me, can I borrow that
 in-flight manual for a moment?"

 "Sure" comes the voice of Paul, which sends a tingle down your spine,
 er , exoskeleton? Just as romantic.

 You hear a distinct *plink*. Then the assassin pulls back with the
 magazine.

>drink coffee


 You can't see any such thing.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Paul's Midsection</span>
 You can see that Paul still has that "Cheerleader of Dementia" shirt
 you got him. Stretches a bit now, though. Well, he always was a stress
 eater.

 Paul holds a coffee mug the size of a roundabout in his hands. Black,
 no sugar.

>drink coffee


 There's nothing suitable to drink here.

>enter mug


 You can't see any such thing.

>swim in coffee


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>enter coffee


 You dive headfirst into the coffee! Maybe you will be reborn as
 something more useful.

 Hope burns hotter than the coffee, hope that Paul will see you. He
 always drinks too fast and then get these cute hiccups.

 And as a white light surrounds you, you can see his gargantuan face
 above you, twisted into a grimace of disgust. "Ugh, a fly has drowned
 itself in my coffee." You see the assassin look over, gnashing his
 teeth. "That so?"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

>open eyes


 You can't see any such thing.

>go east


 You'll have to get out of the toilet bag first.

>examine me


 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

>yell


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>open bag


 You're most definitely not the fly anymore. As you look down at the
 paws with which you opened the bag just now, you realize you are the
 rat you and Paul rescued on Mercury in the last game.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Leg Area</span> (in the toilet bag)
 You can see Paul's feet here. He's wearing Chucks and has still not
 learned not to wear white socks.

>go east


 You'll have to get out of the toilet bag first.

>out


 You get out of the toilet bag.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Leg Area</span>
 You can see Paul's feet here. He's wearing Chucks and has still not
 learned not to wear white socks.

 Paul's toilet bag sits here. It looks very heavy when you're this
 small.

>look in bag


 The toilet bag is empty.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Leg Area (East)</span>
 You can see the assassins feet here. He wears black loafers with
 matching socks.

 The fearsome snake stares at you.

>bite snake


 The mercurian rat is not really a fighter. The constant diet of
 cheese, bacon and treats you got at Paul and -er- your home have done
 the rest. A pretty long thought, considering the snake just bit you
 and poisoned you to death.

 small.

>take bag


 Damn! Forgot to make it fixed in place. I wonder what else I forgot to
 make untakable.

 Taken.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Leg Area (East)</span>
 You can see the assassins feet here. He wears black loafers with
 matching socks.

 The fearsome snake stares at you.

>put snake in bag


 (first taking the snake)

 Hey, that isn't supposed to work!

 There!

 Now you only need to find a way to warn Paul not to open his bag
 before the landing. You really need to find a way to communicate.
 That's what your therapist always said, too.

 Then Paul's foot comes down and flattens the toilet bag accidentally.
 Ouch, poor snake. But before you can wonder, there is white light and
 ...

 <span class="floydstyle i">Row 54</span> (on the seat)
 This is a standard row of seats. Somebody (presumably your mother) is
 yapping on about something.

 Two rows up from you, you can see Paul and the Assassin, seated side
 by side.

>SAVE
>cf8
 %% Enter a save filename to write:
 Ok.

>examine me


 Hm, looks like you're now an 11-year old girl in a polkadot dress.
 You're not sure this is how reincarnation is supposed to work.

 Staring intently at them, you can see the assassin pull something that
 looks vaguely like a full-polymer Glock 7, caliber .308,  using
 octagonal polygonal rifling rather than the hexagonal shaped bores
 used for models in other chamberings. It has a 8 round magazine and is
 fitted with a full-plastic third party silencer, possibly made by
 Fischer-Dieskau.

>go east


 (first getting off the seat)
 You struggle against your seatbelt for a moment. "Ssshh" says your
 mum. "Don't make a fuss, dear."

 You'll have to get off the seat first.

 The assassin motions for Paul to get up, and he does so, sweat on his
 brow.

>open seatbelt


 You finally manage to unstrap the seat belt!

 They disappear towards the rear of the plane.

>go east


 (first getting off the seat)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aisle</span>
 You are in a long aisle of plane seats with people in them, all alike.
 You could go fore and find a blocked cockpit door with no way through,
 so spare us both the trouble and go aft.

>aft



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Row 38</span>
 You stand here next to Paul's seat. You can still smell his perfurme,
 but the memory doesn't work so well, because smell memory is really
 linked to brain chemistry, though your thoughts are in this girl's
 head, so it's a-okay, but you know, it lacks the punch.
 The seats are empty.

>look under seat


 Oh! There's Paul's toilet bag. Seems to contain some fluid. You take
 it with you, he'll probably need his tissues when he sees you again,
 that big cuddly crybaby. (You miss him a lot).

>aft



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cramped Room</span>
 Ugh! There's a door leading to the toilets, and a door leading to the
 cargo, into the fuselage. There are a lot of cupboards here for the
 board crew. One of them helpfully reads "Keys".

>open cupboards


 That's not something you can open.

>open keys


 You slide open the compartment, there is a terrible screeching of
 metal and you are buried under a heap of keys. Oh dear!

 You open the Key cupboard.

>take keys


 (a huge pile of keys)
 That would take time you don't have.

>count keys


 (a huge pile of keys)
 There are 69.105 of them! Oh no, how are you gonna sort through them
 in time? Before the assassin kills Paul, back in the cargo? You try to
 bite back some tears bravely.

 Suddenly, a man appears from the cabin. He has glasses, a moustache
 and a friendly face.


 "Mister can you help me? I need to find the key to the cargo and
 quick, my husb- er daddy is in there."

 "Oh, that's easy. He squats down and seems to sort through the keys in
 no time, before handing you the unique one. With a wink, he disappears
 back into the cabin.

>unlock door with key


 Which do you mean, the Cargo door or the toilet door?

>cargo


 (the unique key)
 You unlock the Cargo door.

>go west


 (first opening the toilet door)
 It is locked.

>open cargo door


 You slide the cargo door open far enough for you to slip through. At
 the other end of the bay, the assassin has just stepped back from the
 bay door, which is opening slowly. His gun aims in Paul's general
 direction, who stand stockstill, while the wind from the bay door
 tousles his hair. "Well, this is it" says the assassin, "no hard
 feelings, eh?"


 You open the Cargo door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cargo Hold</span>
 Here, towards the rear of the plane, the engines roar deafeningly,
 aided by the open cargo bay, through which the wind howls loudly.
 There are boxes strapped to the wall and ground, but not much else of
 interest here.

 Well, maybe apart from the golf cart, which is kind of prominent.

 Paul and the assassin stand here, facing each other near the cargo bay
 to the north.

 "So" says Paul, (who has some experience with stalling killers), "are
 you a fan of Harry Potter?"

>examine cart


 It seems to be the same make and model you used to drive into Paul's
 pool. Aw, fond memories. You wonder where Paul is taking it and why.
 It isn't even locked or anything, key in the ignition.
 At least, one of the back wheels is wedged.

 "Are you trying to play for time? Nobody's gonna save you."

>take wedge


 You pull with all your might, but it won't budge. Being an 11-year old
 girl sure has its downsides.

 "No, it's just that I'm up to the sixth book, and if you knew it you
 could tell me"
>push wedge


 It is fixed in place.

 "I don't know it"
 "Ah, too bad. Maybe I should've watched the movies."

 You give the wedge a quick but thorough oiling.

 "Maybe. I've heard they've cut out quite a bit."

>take wedge

 "Should've listened to the audio books. They're read by Jim Dale, I
 think."

>pull wedge


 It is fixed in place.

 "Are you sure, I thought it was that guy from QI."

>enter cart


 You get into Golf cart.

>go south


 The cart won't fit through the door.

>go north


 You sneak into the golf cart, turn the key and put it into gear.
 Before you, the assassin is getting impatient.

 "Any last words and all that jazz?"

 "Well", Paul swallows, "I once was a married man."

 "I won't put flowers on your wife's grave or anything like that."

 "HEY BUDDY" you shout, though it comes out as a shriek,
 "HETERONARMITIFY THIS!"

 Both Paul and him stare dumbfounded at you as you ram the cart
 against the assassin and topple him screaming into the blue abyss. For
 a frightful second, the cart slides towards the edge, but Paul graps
 you at the last moment. He holds you on his arm and stares at you in
 wonder. "You are a strange little girl, aren't you?"

 "I hope that cart didn't land on anyone" you say, because it's the
 sort of thing that Paul cares about. He carefully peers over the edge.
 "Oh well, it landed on the headquarter of the WBC." You both sigh in
 relief. "Can you let me down, I have something to tell you."

 "Sure." Paul carefully lets you down and pushes the close button on
 the cargo door. "So, um, Paul, it's me! Alex. I was reincarnated."

 Paul blinks.

 "I was the fly...and then for a moment our rat...and now I'm this
 girl."

 Paul blinks.

 "I know it sounds crazy!"

 "Do you think the author is aware of the unfortunate implications of
 this?"

 "Maybe he thinks everyone who thought of this as anything but a comedy
 setup is an asshole?"

 "Good point, dear." He squeezes your shoulder. "Glad to have you
 back." You nod bravely. There is a moment of bliss.


 "So tell me..." he begins, but at that moment the cabin door crashes
 open and the Sky Marshall storms in.

 "Is this girl your daughter, sir?"

 "Of course not" says Paul, hurt, "we're married."


 Both their faces falter at about the same time.
