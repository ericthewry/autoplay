 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.












 "Well done, Agent 10," said Sir Playfair Panchax, head of Mission HQ.
 "We knew you'd stop the Seven Deadly Fins. Good show! It's a shame they
 got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned
 it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real
 chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life
 apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite
 relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just
 to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for
 a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the
 payroll.

 Someone's coming. Good, it must be time for food. SPLATTO. A hand as
 big as a bus drops something hard right on your head. Understandably
 dazed, you flip over and, through a swirl of ant eggs, spot what hit
 you: a tacky plastic castle. It looks like a rush job. Sir Playfair
 must be in trouble. And you thought you were on vacation...

 Goldfish Bowl
 Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as
 highly trained as yourself. It looks like the pondweed is dangling from
 the gravel above your head. And the ant eggs, wow! Upside down they
 look, so, so much like, well, like exactly the same as if you were the
 right way up actually. Anyway, there's no need to get carried away. Sir
 Playfair has a message for you in the castle if you're not mistaken and
 he hates agents who are late.
>examine eggs

 It's a pity that ant eggs are all you've had to eat for the past week,
 otherwise they might look appetising.
>examine pondweed

 The pondweed makes a nice change from ant eggs, but you couldn't eat it
 all the time.
>flip

 I don't understand flip
>examine me

 You are a small, scaly fish, with fins and a natty little tail. Tres
 chic.
>examine castle

 Colours are sprayed on this tacky castle in a random fashion, as if it
 had been visited by a medieval graffiti artist with a belly full of
 mead and a nasty case of clinical depression. A large gateway leads
 inside.
>inventory

 Your mouth is empty.
 You get bored of swimming upside-down and turn over, deftly avoiding
 the first scoring point of the game.
 Goldfish Bowl
 The ant eggs have stopped swirling around and are now floating on the
 surface. Gravel fills the bottom of the bowl and some tasty looking
 pondweed you've been wanting to nibble for days is lying on it. You get
 a nasty feeling in your swim bladder about the castle, probably because
 Sir Playfair has so rudely interrupted your vacation.

 Castle
 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless
 with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom. To anyone else,
 the colours sprayed randomly on the wall would just be colours sprayed
 randomly on the wall. To a daring inter-dimensional espionage operative
 like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications
 across the dimensions. The only exit is out, back to the goldfish bowl.

 "Phffft! Phffft! Testing... Hello? Can you hear me? Agent 10?" You
 groan as Sir Playfair Panchax's voice rattles round your brain. "I'm
 sorry about this old chap," he continues, "I wouldn't disrupt your
 vacation unless it was necessary." He coughs. "It's bad news, I'm
 afraid; the Seven Deadly Fins again. Sabotage this time - on a planet
 full of fish! Beats me why they should pick on fish, but fish it is.
 They've stolen something important, a focus wheel I think, and
 dismantled it. We've got a fix on most places they've visited recently;
 you'll have to scout around and find the wheel. Your inter-dimensional
 warps will be ready in a few milliseconds. The back-room boys have some
 tricks up their sleeves if you get into trouble." The castle jolts and
 three warps and a glass box appear as Sir Playfair signs off. "Good
 luck and keep your eyes peeled. Panchax out."

 Your attention is drawn to a glass box resting in the middle of the

 A smooth warp, a jagged warp and a small warp are also clearly the
 boss's work.
>examine smooth warp

 The smooth warp looks the trendiest of all the warps. It must lead
 somewhere pretty cool.

 The glass box shows all the hallmarks of a rush assembly. There are
 loads of electrical components in it and yards and yards of wiring. You
 can only hope the back-room boys didn't economise on waterproofing.
 It is closed.

 The small warp is just big enough to swim through.
 The jagged warp looks important. It's jagged as well, but definitely
 important.
 The smooth warp looks the trendiest of all the warps. It must lead
 somewhere pretty cool.
>enter smooth warp

 Inter-dimensional travel hurts. A lot. Especially when you haven't done
 it for a while. You buck and roll through the journey, feeling very
 nauseous, then, with a small popping noise, take over a body with the
 aid of a customised host-parasite interface. Your host has arms and
 legs. Looks like trouble!

 Clearing
 It's stopped raining here at the moment, but the clouds overhead show
 that it could start again any minute. If they decide to burst, the tree
 stump in the centre of the clearing would probably fill up with water.
 Paths go south, southeast and east. In all other directions the
 undergrowth is too tangled to make any progress. Micky Blowtorch, your
 ex-colleague, now a crazed warp junkie, is lounging around the stump,
 looking suitably bemused.

 Micky Blowtorch was once Sir Playfair's best operative. Now a sad
 warp-junkie, he lives alone and has no contact with Mission HQ.
>examine me

 You are a tall human being with arms and legs. Somewhat surprisingly,
 you don't have any fishy traits at all. Look, you weren't really
 expecting to spend the whole game as a fish were you? Fish don't get to
 do anything exciting, so we cheated.
>talk to micky

 I don't understand talk

 I don't understand hallo Please try re-phrasing that.
>ask micky about warp

 "Let me at 'em," cries Micky enthusiastically. "There's nothing like a
 good warp to make the day worthwhile!"
>ask micky about fins

 Micky Blowtorch says, "A bunch of nutters. I mean, a real collection of
 fruitcakes. You might think I'm a few chips short of a butty, but these
 guys are the real thing. You look decent - my advice is never, ever
 tangle with them; they're more trouble than you can imagine."
>ask micky about focus wheel

 Micky Blowtorch says, "I talk to the trees. That's why they put me
 away."
>ask micky about micky

 Micky Blowtorch says, "There are more important things in life to
 consider. Did you know there are two simple rules for happiness? One,
 inherit a great deal of money. Two, don't spend it all at once."

 Micky Blowtorch says, "You think I'm mad, don't you? That's what they
 said at Mission HQ but they're wrong."

 Micky Blowtorch says, "I talk to the trees. That's why they put me

>ask micky about mission hq

 Micky Blowtorch says, "I'm not going back you know. I don't care what
 you say, I'm just not going back."
 BANG! Something explodes in the distance. But, as they say, 'out of
 sight, out of mind', so it's probably better not to worry about it.
>ask micky about explosion

 Micky Blowtorch says, "Well. It's sort of a loud banging noise, I
 think."
>tell micky to explode

 Micky Blowtorch says, "What would anyone want to go there for? That
 sounds really odd."
 Micky climbs out of the stump, scratches his backside and looks around.

 Micky Blowtorch says, "You think I'm mad, don't you? That's what they
 said at Mission HQ but they're wrong."
 Micky trudges off towards the wet forest.
>search stump

 You find nothing of interest.
>enter stump

 You are now sitting on the tree stump.

 Thud!
>search undergrowth

 You can't see any undergrowth here.

 Clearing (on the tree stump)
 It's stopped raining here at the moment, but the clouds overhead show
 that it could start again any minute. If they decide to burst, the tree
 stump in the centre of the clearing would probably fill up with water.
 Paths go south, southeast and east. In all other directions the
 undergrowth is too tangled to make any progress.

 You are on your feet.
 Micky arrives looking worried.
>ask micky about rain

 Micky Blowtorch says, "There are more important things in life to
 consider. Did you know there are two simple rules for happiness? One,
 inherit a great deal of money. Two, don't spend it all at once."
 "Something suspicious is going on," he says. "The only person who'd
 interfere with the parrot would be someone after the mould. That means
 Sir Playfair has got someone else on the trail. And that means... " His
 words become indecipherable.
>ask micky about playfair

 Micky Blowtorch says, "What do you know about the boss? Who's side are
 you on anyway?"
>ask micky about forest

 Micky Blowtorch says, "Please don't talk about the trees all the time.
 It gets so boring."

 Micky Blowtorch says, "There's something very fishy about a bird who
 goes round squawking 'Pieces of seven, pieces of nine.' It doesn't add
 up if you ask me."
>ask micky for money

 Micky Blowtorch says, "But I don't have any clams."

 There is no such mission.
>go south

 Dank Forest
 This part of the forest is horribly cold and damp, and brambles scratch
 and pull at you as you pass. To the north and south the undergrowth
 clears a little. The forest continues freely in all other directions.
>go south

 Charred Glade
 This unpleasant scene is clear evidence that the hand of man has set
 foot here. The trees have been damaged by fire, and, on closer
 inspection, you notice the entrance to a mine leading down.
>go down

 The Mine
 Experience tells you the mine is probably riddled with lurking nasties.
 Training tells you there's nothing to worry about. It's dark in there.
 You haven't got a light. Anyway, who's looking for trouble. You return
 to the glade.
 Charred Glade
>go up

 You can't go that way.
 Only north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west,
 northwest, down.
>go south

 Deeper Forest
 The forest gets deeper and darker here. The brambles seem to have a
 life of their own. They snatch at your clothes. Your efforts to get
 through are futile. You are forced back.

>go east

 Dim Forest
 The dense foliage blocks out nearly all the daylight here, with just a
 few patches peeking through. There are ways through the forest in every
 direction with the clearing to the west and a cool glade to the east.
>exits

 North, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest.
>go south

 Wet Forest
 Don't you hate the rain? Why is it raining much harder in this bit of
 the forest than anywhere else? Cold, grey and wet. Blurg! You can leave
 in any direction, but the undergrowth is too dense for you to see which
 way would be best.
 Micky arrives from the general direction of the clearing, looking
 extremely angry.
 "You," screams Micky. "You're the one who's destroyed my peace and
 quiet. I won't have it I tell you!" He slowly stands up and waves his
 fist at you. He slowly works himself into a rage. He slowly moves
 toward you. If you hadn't spent so much time worrying over the dreadful
 grammar, you might have seen him land the karate chop that broke your
 neck...

>enter smooth warp

 You swim through the smooth warp and leave the castle far behind.
 Travelling through the dimensions doesn't hurt so much this time, but
 entering the host-parasite interface is a bit tricky - it'll become
 easier with practice. Your host this time is another human. More hard
 work!

 Ok.
>go east

 Gloomy Forest
 The constant rainfall here is incredibly depressing. So depressing in
 fact, that if you weren't an alert inter-dimensional espionage
 operative with other things to think about, you'd get pretty miserable.
 The forest is impassable to the northeast, east and southeast, although
 to the north and south it seems to clear a bit.
>go north

 Cool Glade
 Drizzle is falling here, to be followed by sunny spells, and a few
 showers in northern regions later in the day. The outlook for tomorrow
 is anybody's guess, but if you'd like to leave this place, you can go
 south, west or southwest.
>go southwest

 You are in the middle of a dark forest. The dense bracken grabs at your
 feet as you walk. Brambles hinder your progress except towards a glade
 to the west.

 There is a cupboard and a bird cage sits on the floor here.

 The cupboard contains some tongs, a crucible and a hammer.
 B-A-N-G! An explosion triggers a reflex action. Faster than a speeding
 bullet, you cover your head and dive for the ground. Unfortunately,
 exploding parrots are much faster than speeding bullets (well, this one
 is anyway). The shock wave hits you while you're still in mid-air,
 disintegrating the host-parasite interface instantly. You get blown to
 kingdom come, or rather that tacky plastic castle in your goldfish

 Outside Smithy
 Soggy leaves hang limply from the trees here, and thick clouds drift
 slowly overhead. A battered blacksmith's forge lies to the east,
 shrouded on all sides by the trees of the forest.
>go north

 Gloomy Forest
 The constant rainfall here is incredibly depressing. So depressing in
 fact, that if you weren't an alert inter-dimensional espionage
 operative with other things to think about, you'd get pretty miserable.
 The forest is impassable to the northeast, east and southeast, although
 to the north and south it seems to clear a bit.
>go north

 Cool Glade
 Drizzle is falling here, to be followed by sunny spells, and a few
 showers in northern regions later in the day. The outlook for tomorrow
 is anybody's guess, but if you'd like to leave this place, you can go
 south, west or southwest.

 Charred Glade
 This unpleasant scene is clear evidence that the hand of man has set

 Some feathers are strewn about (almost enough to make a duvet).
>get feathers

 You have now got the feathers.

 The Mine
 Experience tells you the mine is probably riddled with lurking nasties.
 Training tells you there's nothing to worry about. It's dark in there.
 You haven't got a light. Anyway, who's looking for trouble. You return
 to the glade.

 Wet Forest
 Don't you hate the rain? Why is it raining much harder in this bit of
 the forest than anywhere else? Cold, grey and wet. Blurg! You can leave
 in any direction, but the undergrowth is too dense for you to see which
 way would be best.
 Outside Smithy
 Soggy leaves hang limply from the trees here, and thick clouds drift
 slowly overhead. A battered blacksmith's forge lies to the east,

 Smithy
 The smithy is dark and hot. The cherry-red glow of the fire is proof
 that someone has been using it quite recently. Curiously, the building
 has no windows and there is only the one exit, opposite a tool
 cupboard, to the west.
 There is a cupboard and a bird cage here.
 OK. I'm here!

 I don't understand birdcage
>examine cage

 The bird cage is made of cane or something very similar.
 It is open.

 As you hold the bird cage over the fire the intense heat makes you drop

 You have now got the tongs.
>hold cage with tongs

 You are now holding the bird cage with the tongs.
 Out of the corner of your eye you see a movement in the doorway. It's
 Micky and he seems even madder than usual.
 "You," screams Micky. "You're the one who's destroyed my peace and
 quiet. I won't have it I tell you!" He slowly stands up and waves his
 fist at you. He slowly works himself into a rage. He slowly moves
 toward you. If you hadn't spent so much time worrying over the dreadful
 grammar, you might have seen him land the karate chop that broke your
 neck...
 Castle
 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless
 with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom. To anyone else,
 the colours sprayed randomly on the wall would just be colours sprayed
 randomly on the wall. To a daring inter-dimensional espionage operative
 like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications
 across the dimensions. The only exit is out, back to the goldfish bowl.
 Your attention is drawn to a glass box resting in the middle of the
 room here, this looks like Panchax's work.
 A smooth warp, a jagged warp and a small warp are also clearly the
 boss's work.

 Clearing
 It's stopped raining here at the moment, but the clouds overhead show
 that it could start again any minute. If they decide to burst, the tree
 stump in the centre of the clearing would probably fill up with water.
 Paths go south, southeast and east. In all other directions the
 undergrowth is too tangled to make any progress. Micky Blowtorch, your
 ex-colleague, now a crazed warp junkie, is lounging around the stump,
 looking suitably bemused.

 Right at the bottom of the stump you spy a gold disc.
 Micky arrives looking worried.

 You can't reach the gold disc from here.
 "Get off my stump pea-brain" Micky shouts pushing you aside.
 "Something suspicious is going on," he says. "The only person who'd
 interfere with the parrot would be someone after the mould. That means
 Sir Playfair has got someone else on the trail. And that means... " His
 words become indecipherable.

 Micky Blowtorch says, "What do you know about the boss? Who's side are
 you on anyway?"

 "Hyahhhhhh," shouts Micky, adopting a kung fu position. "You have my
 disc but not for long." In the time it takes to blink, he whips the
 disc from your grasp and flings it in the stump. He explains that five

 ability to move with supernatural speed and precision. You decide the

 Wet Forest
 Don't you hate the rain? Why is it raining much harder in this bit of

 It's stopped raining here at the moment, but the clouds overhead show

 Surprised by the heat of the mould you drop it, splashing molten gold
 on your feet. Molten gold is hot. Very hot. Sufficiently hot to
 vapourise your skin and melt all the way down to the bone. Fortunately,
 you go into a state of shock before the really gruesome stuff starts,
 slipping out of the host-parasite interface like an expert. You reel

 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless

 Outside Smithy
 Soggy leaves hang limply from the trees here, and thick clouds drift
 slowly overhead. A battered blacksmith's forge lies to the east,
 shrouded on all sides by the trees of the forest.

 You are in the middle of a dark forest. The dense bracken grabs at your

 to the west.

 Dank Forest
 This part of the forest is horribly cold and damp, and brambles scratch
 and pull at you as you pass. To the north and south the undergrowth
 clears a little. The forest continues freely in all other directions.

 Dim Forest
 The dense foliage blocks out nearly all the daylight here, with just a
 few patches peeking through. There are ways through the forest in every

 Cool Glade
 Drizzle is falling here, to be followed by sunny spells, and a few

 As you take the ring, a well-aimed stone knocks it from your grasp. You
 hear a "Gweek" sound and see one of the Fins emerging from the bushes
 with an evil grin on his face. You dive for the ring, getting there a
 split second before him. As your fingers close round it, the world
 shimmers, sending you spiralling through the dimensions. With that you
 slap hard into the goldfish's body, leaving the ring to float
 effortlessly into the glass box. "Brilliant display Agent 10," says Sir
 Playfair, "I thought they had you that time. I'm sending you back to
 the bowl. Panchax out"

 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless

 the colours sprayed randomly on the wall would just be colours sprayed

 like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications
 across the dimensions. The only exit is out, back to the goldfish bowl.

 Plush Lounge
 Lounge areas in recording studios are usually for one purpose only, and
 that's to lull musicians into a false sense of the value of time.
 They'll sit in the comfortable sofa, drinking coffee and watching promo
 videos on the television here, all the while running up huge bills at
 the standard hourly rate. But they can afford it. Through a glass door
 to the north is an office. The only other exits are east and west.
 A waste bin is standing in the corner. Rod is loafing around, as tape
 ops are wont to do.
 An important-looking beetroot-faced producer enters the room behind
 you. "You," he shouts charmingly, "make some coffee or you're fired!"
 He strides out.
>watch television

 You can't see a watch here.
>turn on television

 The screen bursts into life showing the latest Seven Deadly Fins promo.
 Only one thing wrong - no sound. You twiddle a few knobs and jiggle a
 few leads, but nothing happens, so you turn it off to avoid being
 caught making a fool of yourself.
 The producer's voice booms from the distance, "Rod! What are you doing?
 I need a tape changing." "Coming," shouts Rod. "I'd better go," he
 says, rushing out, "it's best not to upset him."

 You are a tall human being with arms and legs. Somewhat surprisingly,

 It's night, dark, and cars are flashing past on this busy road with

 is in danger. You start to feel a bit odd, and reach out for the door
 to support you. Your head is spinning and you're finding it hard to
 concentrate. Just before you lose consciousness, you fling the door
 open and fall back inside the studio. Slamming the door behind you, you
 take a few deep breaths to recover.

 The fader setting is much too high for the host-parasite interface. A
 massive soundwave hits you like a locomotive. Your psyche is wrenched
 from its host and flung like so much chaff through the dimensions. You
 arrive back in the goldfish's body with a wet slap, and notice with a
 heavy sigh that you are back where you started, in the castle.
 Castle
 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless
 with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom. To anyone else,
 the colours sprayed randomly on the wall would just be colours sprayed

 like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications
 across the dimensions. The only exit is out, back to the goldfish bowl.

 It's really dark here, torch or no torch. What was that noise? It
 sounded pretty fierce. There it is again. It came from the east. No,

 The transept, at right angles to the nave, is in ruins. The fire to the

 Abbey
 Neglected over the centuries, only the shell of this abbey remains and
 even that is in a poor state of repair. Rubble is everywhere, except
 for a gap cleared in the middle, in which a fire is burning. You can go

 arch.
 Some hippies are sitting around the fire in squalor, twanging out some
 terrible guitar and drinking heavily.

 Ruined Nave
 As you survey this place, you wonder how such beauty could have been
 left to just rot. Depression hangs heavy on your heart, but not for
 long! Inter-dimensional espionage operatives aren't renowned for their
 sentimentality with regard to ruined naves, and, besides, you have jobs
 to meet, people to be and places to do. Southward from here, it's as

 The hippies all have greasy hair and dirty denims. The bad news is that
 they are the band you're travelling with. The worse news is that
 they're blind drunk. They are sitting around the fire in squalor,
 twanging out some terrible guitar and drinking heavily.
>ask hippies about fin

 The music stops and the hippies turn. The leader peers into the gloom,
 fondling the neck of his guitar. Then he spots you. "Get him boys," he
 shouts. Your cover blown, you try plan C2-A, colloquially known as
 'running for it'. However, C2-A requires that the host be attired in
 combat gear, not ridiculously flared jeans. Your legs get tangled and
 you fall. "Thought you'd get your hands on my grommet didn't you?" says
 the leader, standing over you, "well think again." The guitar hits you
 with a twang like the opening of "A Hard Day's Night" and your host
 passes out. The interface between you relaxes, warping you out through
 the dimensions, spinning and whirling and feeling sick. Then a goldfish
 approaches you at great speed. WHAP! That hurt.
 Castle
 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless

 like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications
 across the dimensions. The only exit is out, back to the goldfish bowl.

 You're about thirty feet above ground. It feels as if the world is

 mind. You feel that you have violated this place somehow.
 There is an ancient altar and a sarcophagus lid here.

 With the ceremonial cord tied to it, the gargoyle won't fit in the

 A number of unpleasant looking hippies emerge from who knows where.
 Seven of them to be precise. They are not happy. Truth to tell, they're
 extremely unhappy. A bottle of vodka sails through the air. It's not an
 offer of a drink, since it was aimed at your head. It connects. You
 disconnect from your host and spin through the dimensions towards your
 new host. Castle
 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless
 with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom. To anyone else,

 Not the best place to sleep. It's very cold and more than slightly

 Outside the abbey
 The ruined abbey stands before you, imposing even in such a state of

 and see the glow from a large fire. Westward leads back into the gloom.
 A poster is blowing about in the wind.

 The poster is a discarded advertisement for a concert by the Seven
 Deadly Fins.

 The poster has a psychedelic picture of purple and green goldfish
 swimming around the Seven Deadly Fins logo. The fish form the words,
 "No rules. No war. No profit." Underneath is scrawled, "The Fins are in

 The column has a niche in it, surrounded by an ornate carving. You
 wonder where it came from, and whether you could get one for your front
 garden. A chalice rests in the niche.
 A number of unpleasant looking hippies emerge from who knows where.
 Seven of them to be precise. They are not happy. Truth to tell, they're
 extremely unhappy. A bottle of vodka sails through the air. It's not an
 offer of a drink, since it was aimed at your head. It connects. You
 disconnect from your host and spin through the dimensions towards your
 new host. Castle
 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless
 with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom. To anyone else,
 the colours sprayed randomly on the wall would just be colours sprayed

 "Not so fast," says one of the hippies, obviously the leader and
 probably one of the Fins, "Hand over the grommet." You try to lodge an
 SOS with HQ. The leader holds out his hand and stares you in the eye.
 "Right," he yells, "hold him down boys." The hippies close in. The
 smell is terrible. Just when you wanted a hole to open up in the ground
 and swallow you, one does. Well almost. It's actually in the ceiling
 but it'll definitely do. The hippies stop in their tracks and stare at
 the hole. "Cor baby," says one, taking a puff, "that's really free."
 You dive for it. Out of the corner of your eye you spot a goldfish
 approaching at phenomenal speed. Too late to avoid it now. BLAM! The
 grommet falls from your grasp and into the glass box. "Sorry about the
 timing," says Sir Playfair's distorted voice, rolling and tumbling
 through the dimensions with you. "Excellent job. Well done. Keep up the
 good work. Panchax out."
 "Oh, sorry old sport," Sir Playfair's voice returns, "I forgot that you
 now had the focus wheel. Jolly well done. The back room boys have
 worked out what the Fins are up to. I'll tell you what it is after we
 open a warp into Hydropolis, the fish planet's capital. Intriguing eh?"
 The castle jolts and a large warp appears in the wall.
 "Well, this is the story: the Fins have set up a meteorological
 imbalance on the fish planet, causing water to evaporate. The fish
 scientists have devised a project to save their world but the Fins have
 sabotaged that too! You are to help them complete their project in the
 body of its leader, Dr. Roach. Good luck. Panchax out."

 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
 There is a fishton here.
>examine fishton

 Fishtons are really popular in Hydropolis at the moment. Most fish can
 only afford small apartments so these space saving beds are essential.
 You didn't get any instructions with it so it's really just a glorified
 sofa.
 The wall behind your fishton glows, revealing the face of the
 principal's secretary. "Good morning Dr. Roach," she says, "I'm sorry
 to call so early, I just want to confirm that the principal is
 expecting you at ten o'clock this morning. Goodbye." Her face fades
 out, leaving you with the annoying jingle of the Hydropolis
 Telecommunications Network: "HTN, HTN - With your friends you can talk,
 and you won't have to walk, HTN, HTN". Not the most auspicious start to
 a morning.

 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights

 There are two doors on this level of the apartment block - one to your

 With no security guard, no intercom and no doors, any old eel could

 Paddlington
 This is the up and coming place to live in Hydropolis. It's also one of
 the busiest, teaming with guppies. Your apartment block is to the north
 and the entrance to the underground station bearing the logo of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company stands to the east.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub greets you cheerfully.
>ask chub about pass

 Ernest Chub says, "Oh really sir. You flatter me with such a question.
 I'm not fit to provide an answer."
 "Oh well," says Ernest Chub suddenly. "I've got to go now. Bye!"
 Your colleague Ernest Chub goes east.
>go east

 Paddlington Station
 This station is busy. Commuters are flooding down the access funnel to
 the platform, almost overwhelming the guard checking their tickets. The
 ticket clerk, sitting behind a counter, looks quite scared by the mad
 rush too. You can get back to the street westward, but you'd be
 swimming against the tide of commuters.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub greets you cheerfully.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Paddlington.
>go north

 You wisely decide not to walk onto the tracks.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>time

 The time is 10:00
 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Barbellican. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.
>go south

 You try to push your way through to the doors, but can't quite make it
 in time.
 The train is so crowded that the doors just miss your tail when they
 close. The train rumbles into the tunnel with its heavy, sweating load.

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Pickerel. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.

 Pickerel Underground Station
 This station is teeming with guppies, nipping in and out of the access
 funnel which leads to the platform. A guard, looking rather bored with
 life, checks all their tickets. You can buy tickets from the ticket
 clerk, behind his counter close to the exit southeast.

 Plaza
 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a
 pub and to the west is a cinema. Is that enough? No? Well, you'll have
 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or
 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere
 else.
>go west

 It's a good job you have your Fisa card with you. A happy ticket clerk
 sells you a cinema ticket and you are shown to a seat. The film begins.
 It's Starfish Wars, the first part of the infamous Starfish Wars
 trilogy. You spend an entertaining hour watching various fish blaze
 their way across the galaxy, blasting things and generally having a
 whale of a time. You are most uplifted but disappointed when the
 closing credits run. The film ends, the curtains close and the lights
 come up. You rise from your seat and carefully throwing your ticket
 into a bin you return to the plaza.

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.

 Tuna Day's Music Shop
 The music shop is cluttered with amateur musicians, most of whom are
 playing versions of the ancient heavy metal hit "Smoke Underwater",
 very badly, on expensive instruments that they have no intention of

 Second Hand Shop
 This shop is run by a cool catfish of many talents, most of them
 illegal, who goes by the name of Steve. Steve is a fish who could sell
 stripes to tiger sharks, but would rather sell them his grandmother -
 if he hasn't already. The shop has a bad reputation. It normally sells
 "fins what have fallen off the back of a submarine" if you get my
 drift. The exit from this den of low morals and high prices is to the
 south. Steve catches your eye, and with a knowing wink suggests that
 you might like to buy a "somewhat fruity" film that came in yesterday.

 Fishtons are really popular in Hydropolis at the moment. Most fish can

 The radio case is the outer casing of an antique radio. There is a lot

>buy fishton with fisa

 "Rod," calls Steve, "come here and put the fishton in the van for
 delivery later on." Rod appears from a back room, gives you a knowing
 wink, and leaves with the goods safely in his charge.
 "It's all right I know your address," Steve says as you offer the
 information. He takes your credit card and partly fills in a sales slip
 which he informs you will be duly completed "Later" and returns the
 card to you with a supercilious "Thank you sir."

 like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications

 There are two doors on this level of the apartment block - one to your
 apartment and one to your new neighbour, Ernest Chub's. Beside each
 door is a handprint and an access shaft leads down to the lobby.
 As you arrive Simon Tench greets you cheerfully.
>go down

 You swim into the access shaft and down to the ground floor.
 Lobby
 With no security guard, no intercom and no doors, any old eel could
 slip in here and break into every apartment in the block. It's a wonder
 it hasn't happened yet! Mind you, it wouldn't be all bad. At least Dr.
 Roach could get some new furniture with the insurance money. The exit
 out to Paddlington is to the south and the access shaft leads up to the
 landing.
>go south

 Paddlington
 This is the up and coming place to live in Hydropolis. It's also one of
 the busiest, teaming with guppies. Your apartment block is to the north
 and the entrance to the underground station bearing the logo of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company stands to the east.
 An old fish swims up to you and asks for the price of a snifter. "Five
 clams," you tell him. He thanks you and swims away.
>go east

 A high speed police fish pulls up outside your apartment block. His
 flashing blue light and wailing siren make you feel decidedly uneasy.
 The host-parasite interface weakens momentarily and you catch a glimpse
 of the goldfish bowl. Then you regain control of Roach's body as the
 police fish zooms off.
 Paddlington Station
 This station is busy. Commuters are flooding down the access funnel to
 the platform, almost overwhelming the guard checking their tickets. The
 ticket clerk, sitting behind a counter, looks quite scared by the mad
 rush too. You can get back to the street westward, but you'd be
 swimming against the tide of commuters.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Paddlington.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.
>wait

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Barbellican. The

 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.

>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Battersea
 Battersea is a place of dreams. The station was built many years ago to
 encourage visits by tourists. Regular tours around the complex leave
 from the north. An access funnel, leading down is fished by a guard who
 is checking tickets, or would be if there were any to check but the
 ticket clerk hasn't sold any.
>go north

 "Welcome to Battersea Power Station." You are met by a tall tour guide,
 who appears to be chewing gum and reading notes off little cue cards.
 She takes you on a guided tour of the entire plant, filling your head
 with facts and figures about throughput, power consumption and blades.
 One thing that stuck in your mind was the interesting, but
 little-known, fact that Battersea is only the secondary power station
 for Hydropolis and is only used during peak demand and to power the
 underground system. After about half an hour, she returns you to the
 power station.
 Power Station
 The power station dwarfs almost anything you have ever seen. Guided
 tours leave from the north, so the citizens of Hydropolis can marvel at
 this fish-made wonder and the sophistication of their engineers. A
 steel door lies to the west near an important gauge and a large switch.
>examine gauge

 The important gauge shows the total electricity output of the Battersea
 sub-station. It is currently displaying a value of 100.
>examine switch

 The switch is just like those seen in fifties science-fiction movies,
 requiring both hands to turn it on or off. It controls the power supply
 to the whole of the tube system. At the moment it is on.
>turn off switch

 With great effort you manage to pull the switch. The light dims
 momentarily and the guppies on the guided tour scream until everything
 returns to normal. The important gauge shows a considerable drop in
 current.
>examine gauge

 The important gauge shows the total electricity output of the Battersea
 sub-station. It is currently displaying a value of 39.
>examine door

 The steel door opens automatically when the pressure from the turbines
 in the area to the west falls below danger levels. For safety reasons,
 it cannot be opened by hand.
 It is closed.
>go west

 The pressure door is closed to protect fish like you from swimming into
 the proximity of the fast moving blades which lie beyond. You may not
 appreciate this extra protection but I'm sure Dr. Roach is delighted.

 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go east

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
 A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad.
>examine statue

 The statue has the University motto, 'Scientia est bona' engraved
 underneath.
 A student sidles up to you. "We've got the principal," he whispers, "if
 you don't donate to rag week we'll let her go." You hastily decide to
 give them all your loose change, then realise you have none. They
 refuse to take your credit card and swim off, laughing.
>go east

 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the
 university. A corridor continues east, and a metal door blocks any
 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.
>go south

 The Principal's secretary glances up at you. "Oh dear. I'm sorry Dr.
 Roach but you're too late. The principal seemed most concerned by your
 absence and has taken you off The Project. Take a holiday, we'll
 contact you tomorrow." You are shown out.

 Enter saved game to load:
 Castle
 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless
 with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom. To anyone else,
 the colours sprayed randomly on the wall would just be colours sprayed
 randomly on the wall. To a daring inter-dimensional espionage operative
 like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications
 across the dimensions. The only exit is out, back to the goldfish bowl.
 Your attention is drawn to a glass box resting in the middle of the
 room here, this looks like Panchax's work.
 There is a large warp here.
>enter large warp

 You swim into the large warp and your body changes into a strange
 hybrid creature, half-man half-fish. This must be Dr. Roach.
 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
 There is a fishton here.
>examine shelf

 Dr. Roach bought the trendy black shelf from his favourite trendy black
 shelf shop.
 There is a fishofax on it.
 The wall behind your fishton glows, revealing the face of the
 principal's secretary. "Good morning Dr. Roach," she says, "I'm sorry
 to call so early, I just want to confirm that the principal is
 expecting you at ten o'clock this morning. Goodbye." Her face fades
 out, leaving you with the annoying jingle of the Hydropolis
 Telecommunications Network: "HTN, HTN - With your friends you can talk,
 and you won't have to walk, HTN, HTN". Not the most auspicious start to
 a morning.

 seems this talk about parasiting may not be speculation. We've received
 information that a junior member of your team has been 'taken over' and
 has sabotaged The Project. You don't need me to tell you that this
 could be disastrous for Hydropolis. Naturally, I've suspended everyone
 until further notice. You're the only one I can trust; I want you to
 investigate. I'm going to the government to inform them of the danger.
 I'm not evacuating, so don't worry. I'll be back tomorrow." She gets

 The protocopier is a large box with a slot on one side and a simple

 prototype Device. While it is indeed remarkable, the University
 authorities took a different view for two reasons: the protocopier used
 so much power that fuel bills reached record levels and secondly, it
 could only teleport in very small amounts of water. It was the downfall
 of Dr. Salmon; he was fired by the principal.

 Playfair have anything to do with it, it's going to save Hydropolis
 from water evaporation. It almost fills the room, looking like an

 Laboratory
 This lab is exceptionally clean. Dr. Roach must be remarkably
 fastidious. The water is constantly decontaminated and recycled to
 protect The Project equipment and your terminal from damage by grit,
 fluff and dirt. Exits are northeast, southeast and west through the
 metal door to the corridor.

 The metal door will not open to unauthorised persons. There is a slot
 next to it.
 It is closed.
>put card in slot

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the

 My worm, it's dark in this corridor. A metal door to the east prevents

 Corridor
 Windows line the north wall of this corridor which continues east and
 west. They look out onto the quad, and stream light on to an archway
 which leads south to the library.
 As you arrive Simon Tench greets you cheerfully.
 You notice several students loitering with intent. One of them produces
 a guitar and starts singing: "Come on feel my nose. The girls grab my
 clothes. Go why, why why any more." Oh no, he's started busking!
 Luckily the other students attack and carry him off before you hear too
 much.
>go west

 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the
 university. A corridor continues east, and a metal door blocks any
 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.
>put tatty in slot

 There is no such tatty.
>put tatty card in slot

 A student notices you trying to open the door and beckons you. "Dr.
 Salmon's the only one who's got an id card for the research wing," she
 says helpfully. "He's probably in town getting drunk as usual." She
 trudges off, muttering, "they should never have taken him off The
 Project."
>go west

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university

 Restaurant
 Bursting to the gills, this restaurant serves the finest plankton meals
 in Hydropolis. For the fabulously wealthy, gas-impregnated oils are on
 sale. They may not be as efficient as snifters, but they certainly put
 everyone else in their place! A waiter floats around near the exit to
 the north.

 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads
 to the platform. A ticket clerk sits behind a counter selling tickets
 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Opah University.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the

 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the
 access funnel which leads to the platform. The ticket counter stands in
 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.
>go northwest

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place

 This hardware shop contains everything for the fish with DIY leanings.
 If your DIY is leaning, this is were you can get the tools to mend it.
 If you require anything the assistant will only be too pleased to take
 your credit, if not your credit card. He may even give it back. You can
 leave the shop by swimming west. The assistant offers to sell you a
 black plastic bag.
 A hyperdriver and a screwdriver are for sale.
>examine hyperdriver

 The hyperdriver is a variant on the standard screwdriver, designed for
 removing lok screws.

>go west

 My, Plaice Street is busy! In the end you succeed in crossing.
 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub greets you cheerfully.
>examine chub

 Ernest Chub wants to be like you in every way. You're his hero and this
 leads to plenty of grovelling on his part. He really needs to get a
 life - of his own preferably, especially since he rented the apartment
 next door to you.
>ask chub about salmon

 Ernest Chub says, "The only good thing about Dr. Salmon's departure was
 that we now have a morally stable leader for the Project." He grins an
 obsequious grin. "He he was a brilliant man. It's a shame to see him
 wasting himself on snifters."
>ask chub about project

 Ernest Chub says, "You're the Project leader, Roach. You tell me."
>sniff gas

 Which one, the pink gas or the clear gas?
>pink

 As you inhale, someone kicks you in the gills. At least, that's what it
 feels like. Actually, you keel over backwards and swim upside down out
 of the pub, but you can't remember that. The drunk thought it was funny
 though. You do remember going round and round the tube network before
 you could get off at Paddlington. Coming up the access funnel was
 difficult, but, now that you're back in your apartment, the snifter has
 thankfully worn off, leaving you with a sore head. Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
 Oh, no! You've been burgled! I hope Dr. Roach was insured.

 As you arrive Bertie Bream greets you cheerfully.
>examine bertie

 Though extremely pedantic, Bertie Bream is a capable and valuable
 member of the team, able to spot tiny mistakes that most would consider
 irrelevant. He's also after your job.
 You notice a guppy flounder around for a bit and then swim off.
>ask bertie about project

 Bertie Bream says, "Basically 'project' is a transitive verb which can
 be used in many predicative clauses to convey meaning." Bertie smiles a
 smarmy smile and continues. "I'm sure that's sufficient detail for you
 Roach"
>ask bertie about salmon

 Bertie Bream says, "Let me see now, I would guess that drunk is the
 past participle of the verb to drink, though that doesn't mean too much
 to a fish. So we have borrowed the phrase to describe being under the
 influence of a snifter."
 "Oh well," says Bertie Bream suddenly. "I've got to go now. Bye!"
 Your colleague Bertie Bream goes north.

 Museum
 Visited by many fish over the course of a year, the museum is a great
 attraction. Maybe this is due to its unique collection of piscean
 relics, the greatest of which is the skeleton of the

 room. You can explore the museum in your own time by going north, east
 or west. You can return to the station by swimming south.

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.

 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads
 to the platform. A ticket clerk sits behind a counter selling tickets
 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Opah University.

 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.

 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the

 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.

 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.
>go north

 You dart across Dace Road while nobody's looking.
 Second Hand Shop
 This shop is run by a cool catfish of many talents, most of them
 illegal, who goes by the name of Steve. Steve is a fish who could sell
 stripes to tiger sharks, but would rather sell them his grandmother -
 if he hasn't already. The shop has a bad reputation. It normally sells
 "fins what have fallen off the back of a submarine" if you get my
 drift. The exit from this den of low morals and high prices is to the
 south. Steve catches your eye, and with a knowing wink suggests that
 you might like to buy a "somewhat fruity" film that came in yesterday.

 The music shop is cluttered with amateur musicians, most of whom are
 playing versions of the ancient heavy metal hit "Smoke Underwater",
 very badly, on expensive instruments that they have no intention of

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.

 Battersea is a place of dreams. The station was built many years ago to

 is checking tickets, or would be if there were any to check but the
 ticket clerk hasn't sold any.
>go north

 "Welcome to Battersea Power Station." You are met by a tall tour guide,
 who appears to be chewing gum and reading notes off little cue cards.
 She takes you on a guided tour of the entire plant, filling your head
 with facts and figures about throughput, power consumption and blades.
 One thing that stuck in your mind was the interesting, but
 little-known, fact that Battersea is only the secondary power station
 for Hydropolis and is only used during peak demand and to power the
 underground system. After about half an hour, she returns you to the
 power station.
 Power Station
 The power station dwarfs almost anything you have ever seen. Guided
 tours leave from the north, so the citizens of Hydropolis can marvel at
 this fish-made wonder and the sophistication of their engineers. A
 steel door lies to the west near an important gauge and a large switch.

 Museum
 Visited by many fish over the course of a year, the museum is a great
 attraction. Maybe this is due to its unique collection of piscean
 relics, the greatest of which is the skeleton of the

 room. You can explore the museum in your own time by going north, east
 or west. You can return to the station by swimming south.

 museum exhibits.

 The ingenious fish scientists have managed to produce materials so

 almost exactly the same way. Not entirely impressed, you swim back

 Plaza
 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a

 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.
>go south

 Tuna Day's Music Shop
 The music shop is cluttered with amateur musicians, most of whom are
 playing versions of the ancient heavy metal hit "Smoke Underwater",
 very badly, on expensive instruments that they have no intention of
 buying. An assistant is attempting to hide behind the counter. The
 hasty exit from this noisy place is north.
>examine music

 Don't be foolish! You can't examine music, it's ethereal.
>listen to music

 The noise sounds uncannily like "Smoke Underwater" but you're not sure
 as the 'musicians' can't quite get the hang of the opening.

 Second Hand Shop
 This shop is run by a cool catfish of many talents, most of them
 illegal, who goes by the name of Steve. Steve is a fish who could sell
 stripes to tiger sharks, but would rather sell them his grandmother -
 if he hasn't already. The shop has a bad reputation. It normally sells
 "fins what have fallen off the back of a submarine" if you get my
 drift. The exit from this den of low morals and high prices is to the
 south. Steve catches your eye, and with a knowing wink suggests that
 you might like to buy a "somewhat fruity" film that came in yesterday.
 You recognise the fishton.
 There is a radio case here.
>examine radio case

 The radio case is the outer casing of an antique radio. There is a lot
 of space inside where the radio bits used to be.
>buy film with fisa

 Steve charges the sum of 75 Clams to your Fisa account and passes the
 film to you.
 "I hope you enjoy it, sir," he smirks.
>enter radio case

 You can't go that way.
>get in radio case

 "Watch it," shouts Steve, "that's sold."
>in

 There is nothing to enter here.
>inventory

 You are carrying a fishofax, a tatty card, a travel pass, some dark

 You are wearing a watch.

 Are you talking to yourself again?
>examine fishofax

 The fishofax is a really useful item. Honest. It combines all the
 features of a diary and a wallet, for about four or five times the
 price.
 It is open.
 It contains a Fisa card.
>read fishofax

 "Principal, 10 o'clock. Don't be late" is written on today's diary page
 of your fishofax. You've also written your computer password with the
 letters jumbled up to confuse anyone who reads it. It says "EM".

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Hardware Shop
 This hardware shop contains everything for the fish with DIY leanings.
 If your DIY is leaning, this is were you can get the tools to mend it.
 If you require anything the assistant will only be too pleased to take
 your credit, if not your credit card. He may even give it back. You can
 leave the shop by swimming west.
 A screwdriver is for sale.

 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the
 access funnel which leads to the platform. The ticket counter stands in
 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Eelpout.
>wait

 Time passes.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Museum. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 "Mind the gap," shouts the guard. A pike stops the doors closing to
 allow his aggressive mates on then the train rushes off into the
 tunnel.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Museum Station
 This station is the oldest in Hydropolis. The decoration reflects more
 decadent times, when men were men, fish were fish and they got together
 to build underground stations. An exit leads north to the museum while
 a funnel leads down to the platform.
>go north

 Museum
 Visited by many fish over the course of a year, the museum is a great
 attraction. Maybe this is due to its unique collection of piscean
 relics, the greatest of which is the skeleton of the
 'Bloodyenormasaurus' which has pride of place in the centre of this
 room. You can explore the museum in your own time by going north, east
 or west. You can return to the station by swimming south.
>go northeast

 You can't go that way.
 Only north, east, south, west.

 Alarm Room
 White rooms always have a bad effect on you. If the authorities had had
 their way, your laboratory would have been white. But you were firm.
 You put your tail down and refused. This room is white, and you don't

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
 A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad.
>go north

 That was not the right thing to do. The flashing lights blaze into the
 host-parasite interface, stunning you for a moment. You just manage to
 stagger outside before the interface disintegrates completely. That was
 close!
>wear glasses

 You put on the dark glasses.
>go north

 Not entirely the right thing to do, I'm afraid. The thump-thump-thump
 of the bass gnaws steadily away at the host-parasite interface, making
 you feel decidedly uneasy. You lurch outside before it disintegrates
 completely.
>wear plugs

 You put on the ear-plugs. The ear plugs don't work too well. You can
 still work out what people say.
>go north

 The dark glasses and ear plugs provide just enough protection for the
 host-parasite interface from the flashing lights and heavy bass. You
 are completely safe. As long as you keep them on of course.
 Disco
 The university disco is open all day and every day during rag week. The
 students are having a wild and wacky sponsored bop-til-you-drop
 competition. They're having a whale of a time, pretending they're
 robots when the stroboscopic light is on and performing mindless
 synchronised dances to songs they'd normally only dance to if they were
 on holiday where no-one would remember them. You know it's all done for
 charity, but they look suspiciously like they're enjoying themselves.
 Some disco dancers are here.
>examine dancers

 The disco dancers are having a whale of a time dancing to the music,
 except the whales, who are forbidden to dance in such confined spaces.
>dance

 You boogie on down to the rhythm, strutting your funky groove in an
 alarming fashion. Still, it gets you noticed. When the record finishes,
 the students congratulate you on your 'uninhibited' style.
 Glancing towards the toilet you see a trout emerge, adjusting his
 flies.

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the
 door slides open smoothly and the card is returned to your waiting
 hand.
 Abruptly, everything starts heading towards a certain point,
 accompanied by a grotesque sucking noise. Before you have time to react
 you are surrounded by a blinding white light which rapidly expands to
 engulf the whole of Hydropolis. Then silence. You are nothing but a
 handful of minute particles floating in free space. "You blew that,
 didn't you?" Sir Playfair Panchax is clearly not amused. "We'll try and
 get you back to your bowl, but I've got some bad news. The Fins have
 located you. They're out for revenge. Keep your head old chap, this
 could be nasty. Panchax out." You are dumped back in the fishbowl.
 Goldfish Bowl
 A tingle runs up and down your scales here. It's definitely not your
 vacation bowl. True, it does have gravel, ant eggs and pondweed, but
 then so has every goldfish bowl. The difference is you can see out of
 this bowl and it doesn't have a tacky plastic castle. It looks like
 you're in a computer room of some kind, with terminals lining the
 walls.
 "You complete Halibut!" shouts Sir Playfair Panchax. He doesn't sound
 happy at all. "We warned you not to damage Dr. Roach's body. He was the
 only one who could save Hydropolis. The Fins have won and are out to
 get you. There is nothing we at Mission HQ can do." The good news is
 you've been sent back to the bowl. The bad news is that the dimensional
 warps have disappeared. It looks like you're in big trouble.

 Castle
 Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless
 with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom. To anyone else,
 the colours sprayed randomly on the wall would just be colours sprayed
 randomly on the wall. To a daring inter-dimensional espionage operative
 like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications
 across the dimensions. The only exit is out, back to the goldfish bowl.
 Your attention is drawn to a glass box resting in the middle of the
 room here, this looks like Panchax's work.
 There is a large warp here.
>enter large warp

 You swim into the large warp and your body changes into a strange
 hybrid creature, half-man half-fish. This must be Dr. Roach.
 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
 There is a fishton here.
>examine shelf

 Dr. Roach bought the trendy black shelf from his favourite trendy black
 shelf shop.
 There is a fishofax on it.
 The wall behind your fishton glows, revealing the face of the
 principal's secretary. "Good morning Dr. Roach," she says, "I'm sorry
 to call so early, I just want to confirm that the principal is
 expecting you at ten o'clock this morning. Goodbye." Her face fades
 out, leaving you with the annoying jingle of the Hydropolis
 Telecommunications Network: "HTN, HTN - With your friends you can talk,
 and you won't have to walk, HTN, HTN". Not the most auspicious start to
 a morning.

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.

 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from

 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.
>go south

 "Good morning Dr. Roach," says the principal's secretary, "have a seat.
 She won't be long." She finally arrives at ten minutes to ten. "Good
 morning Doctor," says the principal as she closes the door and takes a
 seat, "I'm sorry if this is inconvenient, but it is an emergency. It
 seems this talk about parasiting may not be speculation. We've received
 information that a junior member of your team has been 'taken over' and
 has sabotaged The Project. You don't need me to tell you that this
 could be disastrous for Hydropolis. Naturally, I've suspended everyone
 until further notice. You're the only one I can trust; I want you to
 investigate. I'm going to the government to inform them of the danger.
 I'm not evacuating, so don't worry. I'll be back tomorrow." She gets
 up. "Now please hurry doctor. There's not a second to lose." You walk
 back to the foyer together then go your separate ways.

 This lab is exceptionally clean. Dr. Roach must be remarkably

 After allowing time for someone to pass the door closes.

 Project Room
 Considering how important this place is for the future of all fishkind,
 you are stunned by how little has been done to make it look
 significant. A lick of paint, although distasteful for the fish licking
 it on, wouldn't have gone amiss. The only exit is southwest.
 The device almost fills the room, looking like an aquarium filled with
 multi-coloured gravel.
>examine device

 Dr. Roach certainly knows how to build impressive machines - this one
 nearly fills the project room. It looks a bit like a huge aquarium,
 filled to the brim with multi-coloured gravel and, if you and Sir
 Playfair have anything to do with it, it's going to save Hydropolis
 from water evaporation. It almost fills the room, looking like an

 Bertie Bream says, "Let me see now, I would guess that drunk is the
 past participle of the verb to drink, though that doesn't mean too much
 to a fish. So we have borrowed the phrase to describe being under the
 influence of a snifter."
>go west

 My, Plaice Street is busy! In the end you succeed in crossing.
 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 Your colleague Bertie Bream swims into view.

>give snifter to salmon

 The drunk takes the mask, holds it to his face and inhales deeply.
 After several deep breaths he returns the snifter to Steve."I needed
 that," he says, "I'd give you a token of my thanks, but I'm destitute."
>ask salmon about card

 Dr. Salmon lurches slightly. He reaches into his pocket and removes an
 id card a little like your own but in much better condition. Surprised
 at his find he hands it to you saying "fangs very very much".

 Research Wing
 This is where a lot of the groundwork for The Project was done by the
 famous Dr. Salmon. Unfortunately his work was shelved to make room for
 your endeavours, and anyway he sniffed far too much. You can swim up

 Water must be evaporating fast; the tower is only half full! You swim

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of

 Restaurant
 Bursting to the gills, this restaurant serves the finest plankton meals
 in Hydropolis. For the fabulously wealthy, gas-impregnated oils are on
 sale. They may not be as efficient as snifters, but they certainly put
 everyone else in their place! A waiter floats around near the exit to
 the north.
>order meal

 The waiter waves you away. "I'm afraid our facilities are all fully
 booked today. I can sell you a take-away sachet of plankton, if you're
 hungry sir."
>buy sachet

 With what?
>buy sachet with fisa

 "That will be 5 clams exactly sir." You type in your Fish Identity
 Number to authorise the debit. The assistant waits for authorisation
 then returns your card, together with the sachet.
>examine sachet

 The sachet is used by customers who wish to take their food away to eat
 at home.
 It is closed.
>open sachet

 You tear open the sachet. The plankton escapes and starts to slowly
 disperse in the water around you. You notice how the plankton deflects
 the light as it spreads. If you act quickly you should be able to eat
 it before it disperses completely.

 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern

 Museum Station
 This station is the oldest in Hydropolis. The decoration reflects more
 decadent times, when men were men, fish were fish and they got together
 to build underground stations. An exit leads north to the museum while
 a funnel leads down to the platform.
>go north

 Museum
 Visited by many fish over the course of a year, the museum is a great
 attraction. Maybe this is due to its unique collection of piscean
 relics, the greatest of which is the skeleton of the
 'Bloodyenormasaurus' which has pride of place in the centre of this
 room. You can explore the museum in your own time by going north, east
 or west. You can return to the station by swimming south.
>go north

 Alarm Room
 White rooms always have a bad effect on you. If the authorities had had
 their way, your laboratory would have been white. But you were firm.
 You put your tail down and refused. This room is white, and you don't
 like it. It leads north to the museum's finest exhibit and south back
 to the museum.
>open sachet

 You tear open the sachet. The plankton escapes and starts to slowly
 disperse in the water around you. You notice how the plankton deflects
 the light as it spreads. If you act quickly you should be able to eat
 it before it disperses completely. Your mouth drops open in amazement.
 In the spreading cloud of plankton is the glimmering of myriad light
 beams - clearly the museum alarm system. Ahem!
>go north

 You step past the now visible beams.
 Crystal Room
 This is the most beautiful room you've ever seen. There are no
 decorations, no features, no flaws, and yet the colours shift and swirl
 on every surface creating a hypnotic, soothing ambience. If you ever
 get the urge to leave, the exit is south.
 A crystal is the museum's star exhibit.

 The plankton is delicious, and soon gone. Bells, hooters and whistles
 sing out from all over the museum bringing guards rushing to the
 crystal room. You try to explain that it was an accident; that you just
 stumbled. On your way out you are interviewed by a guard. "You've
 stolen our crystal haven't you, you thief!" In a moment of weakness,
 which ruins any chance you had of completing the game, you confess and
 tearfully hand the crystal back to him, promising never to do anything
 so naughty again.

 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
 Oh, no! You've been burgled! I hope Dr. Roach was insured.

 Plaza
 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a
 pub and to the west is a cinema. Is that enough? No? Well, you'll have
 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or
 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere
 else.

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Bertie Bream and Ernest Chub greet you cheerfully.

 Suddenly, Bertie Bream gets very nervous and drags you away from the

 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads
 to the platform. A ticket clerk sits behind a counter selling tickets
 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Opah University.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>wait

 Time passes.
 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Angel. The doors
 slide open and the commuters swim in and out.
>wait

 The train is so crowded that the doors just miss your tail when they
 close. The train rumbles into the tunnel with its heavy, sweating load.

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Eelpout. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the
 access funnel which leads to the platform. The ticket counter stands in
 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.
>go northwest

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.
>go west

 Dace Road
 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station
 is to the south, west across Plaice Street is a pub, and east lies
 Shark Street.
>go west

 My, Plaice Street is busy! In the end you succeed in crossing.
 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.
>go north

 You dart across Dace Road while nobody's looking.
 Plaza
 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a
 pub and to the west is a cinema. Is that enough? No? Well, you'll have
 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or
 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere
 else.
>go north

 Clothing Shop
 Behind a counter stands an assistant, ready to sell you anything in the
 shop. Many racks are filled with exciting jackets, a fashionable
 accessory in Hydropolis at the moment. You can leave the shop by going
 south.
 A tie is for sale.
>buy tie with fisa

 "That will be 25 clams exactly sir." You type in your Fish Identity
 Number to authorise the debit. The assistant waits for authorisation
 then returns your card, together with the tie.

 Pickerel Underground Station
 This station is teeming with guppies, nipping in and out of the access
 funnel which leads to the platform. A guard, looking rather bored with
 life, checks all their tickets. You can buy tickets from the ticket
 clerk, behind his counter close to the exit southeast.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where

 Luckily the other students attack and carry him off before you hear too
 much.

 The dark glasses and ear plugs provide just enough protection for the
 host-parasite interface from the flashing lights and heavy bass. You
 are completely safe. As long as you keep them on of course. Bertie
 Bream follows you in."Aghhh!" Bertie Bream screams and rushes from the
 disco. You quickly follow, just in time to see his body convulsing.
 There is a popping noise as something escapes through a warp hole then
 Bertie Bream collapses. You slap his gills to bring him round. "What
 happened?" he says, standing up, "I can hardly remember anything. But I
 did something bad to The Project. Something about stream regulators,
 stream accelerators, stream regimentors." "Go on," you say, "It's
 terribly important." "I can't remember," he pleads, getting delirious,
 "it's not my fault, I really can't. I need a shower. I feel dirty." He
 rushes off before you can stop him.

 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the

 Store Room
 Even though Dr. Roach is very clean and tidy, the same cannot be said
 of the rest of the team. They've made this the messiest store room in
 the university. And it's always left for you to straighten things out.
 All the equipment and spares needed for The Project are usually stashed
 here, with a wallchart keeping track of what's in and out of stock. The
 only exit leads northwest.

 Considering how important this place is for the future of all fishkind,
 you are stunned by how little has been done to make it look

 it on, wouldn't have gone amiss. The only exit is southwest.
 The device almost fills the room, looking like an aquarium filled with
 multi-coloured gravel.
>examine aquarium

 I don't understand aquarium
>examine device

 Dr. Roach certainly knows how to build impressive machines - this one
 nearly fills the project room. It looks a bit like a huge aquarium,
 filled to the brim with multi-coloured gravel and, if you and Sir
 Playfair have anything to do with it, it's going to save Hydropolis
 from water evaporation. It almost fills the room, looking like an
 aquarium filled with multi-coloured gravel.

 Bertie Bream bangs on the door shouting, "Stop! Stop! Don't touch the
 Device - it's booby trapped." You rush over into the lab and over to
 the door, expecting some kind of trap. "Can you hear me Dr. Roach?" he
 asks desperately, "the Device is booby trapped. It's connected up to a
 computer game called Shutdown which is keeping the Lokscrew locked in
 place. The only way to free it is to stop Shutdown counting down, but I
 don't know how to; the parasite wrote the program. You'll have to log
 in as me; I can't quite remember my password though, I think it's
 'pondweed' but I'm not sure. The parasite could have deceived me. Did
 you get all that?" "Yes, thank you," you shout and he swims away
 saying, "Good luck Dr. Roach." You return to the project room and look
 with dismay upon the lok screw. Another booby trap! This is getting
 dangerous.

 Shutdown failed. The Project activated.
 Sensors detect Stream Regulator sabotaged. This will cause rapid water
 evaporation. Hydropolis in immediate danger. Red alert. Evacuate!
 Evacuate!

 All the water gets sucked towards the Device. You try swimming for it,
 but, with no water, that's more than a little difficult. Suddenly, the
 door caves in under pressure from water outside and a huge wave slams
 your puny body against the far wall. Laboratory (at the Project
 terminal)
 This lab is exceptionally clean. Dr. Roach must be remarkably
 fastidious. The water is constantly decontaminated and recycled to
 protect The Project equipment and your terminal from damage by grit,
 fluff and dirt. Exits are northeast, southeast and west through the
 metal door to the corridor.
 Goldfish Bowl
 A tingle runs up and down your scales here. It's definitely not your
 vacation bowl. True, it does have gravel, ant eggs and pondweed, but
 then so has every goldfish bowl. The difference is you can see out of
 this bowl and it doesn't have a tacky plastic castle. It looks like
 you're in a computer room of some kind, with terminals lining the
 walls.

 Project Room
 Considering how important this place is for the future of all fishkind,
 you are stunned by how little has been done to make it look
 significant. A lick of paint, although distasteful for the fish licking
 it on, wouldn't have gone amiss. The only exit is southwest.
 The device almost fills the room, looking like an aquarium filled with
 multi-coloured gravel.
>unscrew lok screw with hyperdriver

 The hyperdriver grips and turns the Lokscrew(TM) in that cunning way
 that only hyperdrivers can. The Lokscrew(TM) is easily removed.
>examine device

 Dr. Roach certainly knows how to build impressive machines - this one
 nearly fills the project room. It looks a bit like a huge aquarium,
 filled to the brim with multi-coloured gravel and, if you and Sir
 Playfair have anything to do with it, it's going to save Hydropolis
 from water evaporation. It almost fills the room, looking like an
 aquarium filled with multi-coloured gravel.
 It contains a stream accelerator.
>examine accelerator

 The stream accelerator accelerates particles gathered by the main
 Project machine.
>get accelerator

 You have now got the stream accelerator.
>go southwest

>se

 Store Room
 Even though Dr. Roach is very clean and tidy, the same cannot be said
 of the rest of the team. They've made this the messiest store room in
 the university. And it's always left for you to straighten things out.
 All the equipment and spares needed for The Project are usually stashed
 here, with a wallchart keeping track of what's in and out of stock. The
 only exit leads northwest.
 There is a protocopier here.
>examine wallchart

 The wallchart is an informal record of the equipment held in store for
 The Project.

>go west

 You smash your nose against the door.
>put tatty card in lsot

 I don't understand lsot
>put tatty card in slot

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the
 door slides open smoothly and the card is returned to your waiting
 hand.
>go west

 Corridor
 My worm, it's dark in this corridor. A metal door to the east prevents
 you from swimming directly into your laboratory and the corridor
 returns west.
 After allowing time for someone to pass the door closes.
>go west

 Corridor
 Windows line the north wall of this corridor which continues east and
 west. They look out onto the quad, and stream light on to an archway
 which leads south to the library.
 "On your marks, get set, GO!" Three pairs of students, tied together
 come rushing past you. It's a two-tail race, obviously a ploy to raise
 money for rag week. Then hordes of students swim by, rattling
 collecting tins. It's a good job they don't take Fisa. They swim off.
>go west

 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the
 university. A corridor continues east, and a metal door blocks any
 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.
>put new card in slot

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the
 door slides open smoothly and the card is returned to your waiting
 hand.
>go north

 Research Wing
 This is where a lot of the groundwork for The Project was done by the
 famous Dr. Salmon. Unfortunately his work was shelved to make room for
 your endeavours, and anyway he sniffed far too much. You can swim up
 into the tower from here or pass through the metal door with a slot
 beside it to the south.
 There is a crystal tuna here.
 After allowing time for someone to pass the door closes.
>put crystal in tuna

 The crystal is now inside the crystal tuna.
>close tuna

 The crystal tuna is now closed.
>open tuna

 The crystal tuna is now open.
>get crystal

 crystal, a film and a sachet.
 You are wearing a watch, some dark glasses and some ear-plugs.

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
 A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad.
>go west

 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads
 to the platform. A ticket clerk sits behind a counter selling tickets
 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Opah University.
>wait

 Time passes.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>wait

 Time passes.
 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Angel. The doors
 slide open and the commuters swim in and out.
>wait

 Time passes.
 The train is so crowded that the doors just miss your tail when they
 close. The train rumbles into the tunnel with its heavy, sweating load.
>wait

 Time passes.
 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Eelpout. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.

 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Eelpout.
 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the
 access funnel which leads to the platform. The ticket counter stands in
 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.
>go northwest

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.
>go west

 Dace Road
 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station
 is to the south, west across Plaice Street is a pub, and east lies
 Shark Street.
>go west

 My, Plaice Street is busy! In the end you succeed in crossing.
 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.
>ask drunk about photon bridge

 The drunk says, "I don't know anything about that."
>ask chub about case

 Ernest Chub says, "It's a lovely antique I found at the second hand
 shop. Buried under a pile of rubbish it was. The proprietor has no
 sense of value."
>ask chub about focus wheel

 Ernest Chub says, "The wheel is the product of your own stirling
 efforts sir, I'm sure you know all there is to know about it."
>ask chub about filter

 Ernest Chub says, "Your mind works in such an amazing way sir. I really
 don't know how you think of such things."
>ask tench about filter

 Simon Tench says, "Roachie baby, you're really on form. What a
 concept!"
>ask chub about bridge

 Ernest Chub says, "Your mind works in such an amazing way sir. I really
 don't know how you think of such things."
>ask chub about photon bridge

 Ernest Chub says, "The bridge is of so complex a design that I feel
 sure only you truly understand its workings."
>ask tench about photon bridge

 Simon Tench says, "The photon bridge? Too far out for me fish."
>ask salmon about photon bridge

 The drunk says, "I don't know anything about that."
>buy bridge

 You can't see a bridge here.
>ask chub about crystal

 Ernest Chub says, "It's not nearly as wonderful as you are Dr. Roach."

>examine film

 The film is an original copy of "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes". It's
 more of a vegetable video than a fruity film now you think about it.
>put accelerator in mask

 But Steve won't let you.
>put crystal in accelerator

 But the stream accelerator is not a container.
>open accelerator

 You can't do that to the stream accelerator.
>look at accelerator

 The stream accelerator accelerates particles gathered by the main
 Project machine.
>go north

 You dart across Dace Road while nobody's looking.
 Plaza
 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a
 pub and to the west is a cinema. Is that enough? No? Well, you'll have
 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or
 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere
 else.
>go north

 Clothing Shop
 Behind a counter stands an assistant, ready to sell you anything in the
 shop. Many racks are filled with exciting jackets, a fashionable
 accessory in Hydropolis at the moment. You can leave the shop by going
 south.

 As you step on the road, the cars all accelerate towards you, their
 drivers leaning over the steering wheels with fangs bared. You just
 avoid them by swimming as quick as you can to the safety of Dace Road.

 is to the south, west across Plaice Street is a pub, and east lies

 Second Hand Shop
 This shop is run by a cool catfish of many talents, most of them
 illegal, who goes by the name of Steve. Steve is a fish who could sell
 stripes to tiger sharks, but would rather sell them his grandmother -
 if he hasn't already. The shop has a bad reputation. It normally sells
 "fins what have fallen off the back of a submarine" if you get my
 drift. The exit from this den of low morals and high prices is to the
 south.
 You recognise the fishton.
 There is a radio case here.
>put crystal in case

 "Watch it," shouts Steve, "that's sold."
>buy fishton

 With what?
>buy fishton with fisa

 "Rod," calls Steve, "come here and put the fishton in the van for
 delivery later on." Rod appears from a back room, gives you a knowing
 wink, and leaves with the goods safely in his charge.
 "It's all right I know your address," Steve says as you offer the
 information. He takes your credit card and partly fills in a sales slip
 which he informs you will be duly completed "Later" and returns the
 card to you with a supercilious "Thank you sir."

 Abruptly, everything starts heading towards a certain point,
 accompanied by a grotesque sucking noise. Before you have time to react
 you are surrounded by a blinding white light which rapidly expands to
 engulf the whole of Hydropolis. Then silence. You are nothing but a
 handful of minute particles floating in free space. "You blew that,
 didn't you?" Sir Playfair Panchax is clearly not amused. "We'll try and
 get you back to your bowl, but I've got some bad news. The Fins have
 located you. They're out for revenge. Keep your head old chap, this
 could be nasty. Panchax out." You are dumped back in the fishbowl.

 you're in a computer room of some kind, with terminals lining the
 walls.
 "You complete Halibut!" shouts Sir Playfair Panchax. He doesn't sound
 happy at all. "We warned you not to damage Dr. Roach's body. He was the
 only one who could save Hydropolis. The Fins have won and are out to
 get you. There is nothing we at Mission HQ can do." The good news is
 you've been sent back to the bowl. The bad news is that the dimensional

 "Well done, Agent 10," said Sir Playfair Panchax, head of Mission HQ.
 "We knew you'd stop the Seven Deadly Fins. Good show! It's a shame they
 got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned
 it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real
 chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life
 apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite
 relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just
 to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for
 a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the
 payroll.

 FISH! - Version 1.10 - Copyright (C) 1988, 1990 Magnetic Scrolls Ltd.

 Someone's coming. Good, it must be time for food. SPLATTO. A hand as
 big as a bus drops something hard right on your head. Understandably
 dazed, you flip over and, through a swirl of ant eggs, spot what hit
 you: a tacky plastic castle. It looks like a rush job. Sir Playfair
 must be in trouble. And you thought you were on vacation...

 Goldfish Bowl
 Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as
 highly trained as yourself. It looks like the pondweed is dangling from
 the gravel above your head. And the ant eggs, wow! Upside down they
 look, so, so much like, well, like exactly the same as if you were the
 right way up actually. Anyway, there's no need to get carried away. Sir
 Playfair has a message for you in the castle if you're not mistaken and
 he hates agents who are late.

 Project notes
 For Project Members Eyes only:
 From - A. Roach
 Store notes: The Stream Regulator has been stolen. This is serious. The
 Project will fail if we don't replace it. At present, we haven't
 located any replacement components. Anyone who can find them will be a
 hero. Here's a list of what's needed:
 Filter.
 Photon bridge - Dr. Salmon worked on this, he may know its whereabouts.
 Focus wheel - stolen days ago.
 Tuned Crystal - There's an untuned one in the museum but they won't let
 us near it.
 We also need a case to keep everything stable.

 Laboratory
 This lab is exceptionally clean. Dr. Roach must be remarkably
 fastidious. The water is constantly decontaminated and recycled to
 protect The Project equipment and your terminal from damage by grit,
 fluff and dirt. Exits are northeast, southeast and west through the
 metal door to the corridor.
>examine metal door

 The metal door will not open to unauthorised persons. There is a slot
 next to it.
 It is closed.

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the
 door slides open smoothly and the card is returned to your waiting

 Store Room
 Even though Dr. Roach is very clean and tidy, the same cannot be said
 of the rest of the team. They've made this the messiest store room in
 the university. And it's always left for you to straighten things out.
 All the equipment and spares needed for The Project are usually stashed
 here, with a wallchart keeping track of what's in and out of stock. The
 only exit leads northwest.
 There is a protocopier here.
>examine protocopier

 The protocopier is a large box with a slot on one side and a simple
 on-off switch where you would expect one, built by Dr. Salmon as a
 prototype Device. While it is indeed remarkable, the University
 authorities took a different view for two reasons: the protocopier used
 so much power that fuel bills reached record levels and secondly, it
 could only teleport in very small amounts of water. It was the downfall
 of Dr. Salmon; he was fired by the principal.
>look in slot

 The slot contains nothing.
>turn on switch

 It is already!

 Abruptly, everything starts heading towards a certain point,
 accompanied by a grotesque sucking noise. Before you have time to react
 you are surrounded by a blinding white light which rapidly expands to
 engulf the whole of Hydropolis. Then silence. You are nothing but a
 handful of minute particles floating in free space. "You blew that,
 didn't you?" Sir Playfair Panchax is clearly not amused. "We'll try and
 get you back to your bowl, but I've got some bad news. The Fins have
 located you. They're out for revenge. Keep your head old chap, this
 could be nasty. Panchax out." You are dumped back in the fishbowl.
 Goldfish Bowl
 A tingle runs up and down your scales here. It's definitely not your
 vacation bowl. True, it does have gravel, ant eggs and pondweed, but
 then so has every goldfish bowl. The difference is you can see out of
 this bowl and it doesn't have a tacky plastic castle. It looks like
 you're in a computer room of some kind, with terminals lining the
 walls.
 "You complete Halibut!" shouts Sir Playfair Panchax. He doesn't sound
 happy at all. "We warned you not to damage Dr. Roach's body. He was the
 only one who could save Hydropolis. The Fins have won and are out to
 get you. There is nothing we at Mission HQ can do." The good news is
 you've been sent back to the bowl. The bad news is that the dimensional
 warps have disappeared. It looks like you're in big trouble.

 My worm, it's dark in this corridor. A metal door to the east prevents
 you from swimming directly into your laboratory and the corridor
 returns west.
 After allowing time for someone to pass the door closes.
>go west

 Corridor
 Windows line the north wall of this corridor which continues east and
 west. They look out onto the quad, and stream light on to an archway
 which leads south to the library.
>go west

 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the
 university. A corridor continues east, and a metal door blocks any
 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.
>go west

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
 A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad.
 "On your marks, get set, GO!" Three pairs of students, tied together
 come rushing past you. It's a two-tail race, obviously a ploy to raise
 money for rag week. Then hordes of students swim by, rattling
 collecting tins. It's a good job they don't take Fisa. They swim off.
>go west

 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads
 to the platform. A ticket clerk sits behind a counter selling tickets
 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Opah University.

 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>wait

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Angel. The doors

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the
 access funnel which leads to the platform. The ticket counter stands in
 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.
>go northwest

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.
>go west

 Dace Road
 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station
 is to the south, west across Plaice Street is a pub, and east lies
 Shark Street.
>go west

 My, Plaice Street is busy! In the end you succeed in crossing.
 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.

 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I

 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights

 Plaza
 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a
 pub and to the west is a cinema. Is that enough? No? Well, you'll have
 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or
 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere
 else.

 As you step on the road, the cars all accelerate towards you, their
 drivers leaning over the steering wheels with fangs bared. You just
 avoid them by swimming as quick as you can to the safety of Dace Road.

 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is

 to be, is to the west.
>go north

 You dart across Dace Road while nobody's looking.
 Second Hand Shop
 This shop is run by a cool catfish of many talents, most of them
 illegal, who goes by the name of Steve. Steve is a fish who could sell
 stripes to tiger sharks, but would rather sell them his grandmother -
 if he hasn't already. The shop has a bad reputation. It normally sells
 "fins what have fallen off the back of a submarine" if you get my
 drift. The exit from this den of low morals and high prices is to the
 south.
 You recognise the fishton.
 There is a radio case here.
>buy fishton with fisa

 "Rod," calls Steve, "come here and put the fishton in the van for
 delivery later on." Rod appears from a back room, gives you a knowing
 wink, and leaves with the goods safely in his charge.
 "It's all right I know your address," Steve says as you offer the
 information. He takes your credit card and partly fills in a sales slip
 which he informs you will be duly completed "Later" and returns the
 card to you with a supercilious "Thank you sir."

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.
>buy mask

 "That will be 5 clams, sir. I'll charge it to your Fisa account at
 once. Enjoy your sniff." says Steve as he hands you a mask.

 After several deep breaths he returns the snifter to Steve."I needed
 that," he says, "I'd give you a token of my thanks, but I'm destitute."
>ask salmon about photon bridge

 The drunk says, "I don't know anything about that."
>buy mask with fisa

 "That will be 5 clams, sir. I'll charge it to your Fisa account at

 "You're getting through the snifters quickly." adds Steve, "If you
 like, I can sell you a cylinder for only 99 clams."
>buy cylinder with fisa

 "That will be 99 clams, me old mate." says Steve. He gives you the
 cylinder and charges the purchase to your Fisa account. A drunk with
 his left arm in a sling lurches into you as you turn round from the
 bar, knocking the cylinder to the floor. "Sorry guv," he slurs, picking
 it up, "I'll get you another one."
 "It's one of the Fins! Stop him Agent 10," screams Sir Playfair in your
 brain as the drunk runs off with the cylinder. You swim frantically
 after him but he disappears. "Well, you really messed that up," Sir
 Playfair scolds. "The cylinder must be important otherwise they
 wouldn't have stolen it. Fortunately, the back room boys got a fix on
 him. He's somewhere in the dimensions. You'll have to go after him,
 Agent 10, and be careful this time." You hear him mumbling in the
 background then he curtly says, "A warp will open up in Dr. Roach's
 apartment. Use that. Panchax out." You should be more careful if you
 want to keep your job.

 There is a dark warp here.
>enter dark warp

 You slip through the dark warp into the whirling dimensions. "It's a
 strange place Agent 10," says Sir Playfair's voice in the back of your
 brain. "Those Fins have twisted the dimensions into some kind of
 labyrinth, but it isn't normal. The back room boys are busy trying to
 figure it out. All they can tell me is that the Fins have hidden the
 cylinder in a place where the only way out is up and that if you're
 left in a room with no exits you'll be stuck there until we can get you
 out, which may well be too late to save Hydropolis. You'll have to
 watch your step, Agent 10; we don't want to lose you, old boy. Good
 luck. Panchax out."

 "Well done old boy," says Sir Playfair as you slip back into the
 lounge, "I didn't think you'd make it. That should keep the Fins at bay
 for a while. Top hole. Panchax out." The dark warp swiftly fades.
 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.

>go south

 Landing
 There are two doors on this level of the apartment block - one to your
 apartment and one to your new neighbour, Ernest Chub's. Beside each
 door is a handprint and an access shaft leads down to the lobby.
>go down

 You swim into the access shaft and down to the ground floor.
 Lobby
 With no security guard, no intercom and no doors, any old eel could
 slip in here and break into every apartment in the block. It's a wonder
 it hasn't happened yet! Mind you, it wouldn't be all bad. At least Dr.
 Roach could get some new furniture with the insurance money. The exit
 out to Paddlington is to the south and the access shaft leads up to the
 landing.
>go south

 Paddlington
 This is the up and coming place to live in Hydropolis. It's also one of
 the busiest, teaming with guppies. Your apartment block is to the north
 and the entrance to the underground station bearing the logo of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company stands to the east.
>go east

 Paddlington Station
 This station is busy. Commuters are flooding down the access funnel to
 the platform, almost overwhelming the guard checking their tickets. The
 ticket clerk, sitting behind a counter, looks quite scared by the mad
 rush too. You can get back to the street westward, but you'd be
 swimming against the tide of commuters.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Paddlington.
>go north

 You wisely decide not to walk onto the tracks.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.
>go south

 You smash your nose against the door.
 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Barbellican. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.
>wait

 Time passes.
 "Mind the gap," shouts the guard. A pike stops the doors closing to
 allow his aggressive mates on then the train rushes off into the
 tunnel.
>wait

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Pickerel. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Pickerel Underground Station
 This station is teeming with guppies, nipping in and out of the access
 funnel which leads to the platform. A guard, looking rather bored with
 life, checks all their tickets. You can buy tickets from the ticket
 clerk, behind his counter close to the exit southeast.
>se

 Plaza
 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a
 pub and to the west is a cinema. Is that enough? No? Well, you'll have
 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or
 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere
 else.
>go south

 You dart across Dace Road while nobody's looking.
 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.
>give cylinder to salmon

 "Thank you," slurs the drunk as he takes the cylinder . The drunk plays
 with your thoughtful present. He unfortunately finds how to empty the
 cylinder. The gas escapes, all in one go. What a waste.
>undo

 [Previous turn undone.]
>buy mask with fisa

 "That will be 5 clams, sir. I'll charge it to your Fisa account at
 once. Enjoy your sniff." says Steve as he hands you a mask.
 You are carrying too much and the fishofax annoyingly falls to the
 ground.
>attach mask to cylinder

 You can't do that with the snifter.
>wear mask

 You put on the snifter. As you inhale, someone kicks you in the gills.
 At least, that's what it feels like. Actually, you keel over backwards
 and swim upside down out of the pub, but you can't remember that. The
 drunk thought it was funny though. You do remember going round and
 round the tube network before you could get off at Paddlington. Coming
 up the access funnel was difficult, but, now that you're back in your
 apartment, the snifter has thankfully worn off, leaving you with a sore
 head. Lounge

>go east

 My, Plaice Street is busy! In the end you succeed in crossing.
 Dace Road
 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station
 is to the south, west across Plaice Street is a pub, and east lies
 Shark Street.
>go east

 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.
>se

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the
 access funnel which leads to the platform. The ticket counter stands in
 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.

 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three

 Time passes.
 Abruptly, everything starts heading towards a certain point,
 accompanied by a grotesque sucking noise. Before you have time to react
 you are surrounded by a blinding white light which rapidly expands to
 engulf the whole of Hydropolis. Then silence. You are nothing but a
 handful of minute particles floating in free space. "You blew that,
 didn't you?" Sir Playfair Panchax is clearly not amused. "We'll try and
 get you back to your bowl, but I've got some bad news. The Fins have
 located you. They're out for revenge. Keep your head old chap, this
 could be nasty. Panchax out." You are dumped back in the fishbowl.
 Goldfish Bowl
 A tingle runs up and down your scales here. It's definitely not your
 vacation bowl. True, it does have gravel, ant eggs and pondweed, but
 then so has every goldfish bowl. The difference is you can see out of
 this bowl and it doesn't have a tacky plastic castle. It looks like
 you're in a computer room of some kind, with terminals lining the
 walls.
 "You complete Halibut!" shouts Sir Playfair Panchax. He doesn't sound
 happy at all. "We warned you not to damage Dr. Roach's body. He was the
 only one who could save Hydropolis. The Fins have won and are out to
 get you. There is nothing we at Mission HQ can do." The good news is
 you've been sent back to the bowl. The bad news is that the dimensional
 warps have disappeared. It looks like you're in big trouble.

 "Well done old boy," says Sir Playfair as you slip back into the
 lounge, "I didn't think you'd make it. That should keep the Fins at bay
 for a while. Top hole. Panchax out." The dark warp swiftly fades.
 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.

 Landing
 There are two doors on this level of the apartment block - one to your
 apartment and one to your new neighbour, Ernest Chub's. Beside each
 door is a handprint and an access shaft leads down to the lobby.
>go down

 You swim into the access shaft and down to the ground floor.
 Lobby
 With no security guard, no intercom and no doors, any old eel could
 slip in here and break into every apartment in the block. It's a wonder
 it hasn't happened yet! Mind you, it wouldn't be all bad. At least Dr.
 Roach could get some new furniture with the insurance money. The exit
 out to Paddlington is to the south and the access shaft leads up to the
 landing.
>go south

 Paddlington
 This is the up and coming place to live in Hydropolis. It's also one of
 the busiest, teaming with guppies. Your apartment block is to the north
 and the entrance to the underground station bearing the logo of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company stands to the east.
>go east

 Paddlington Station
 This station is busy. Commuters are flooding down the access funnel to
 the platform, almost overwhelming the guard checking their tickets. The
 ticket clerk, sitting behind a counter, looks quite scared by the mad
 rush too. You can get back to the street westward, but you'd be
 swimming against the tide of commuters.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Paddlington.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.
>wait

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Barbellican. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.

 Pickerel Underground Station
 This station is teeming with guppies, nipping in and out of the access
 funnel which leads to the platform. A guard, looking rather bored with
 life, checks all their tickets. You can buy tickets from the ticket
 clerk, behind his counter close to the exit southeast.

 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a
 pub and to the west is a cinema. Is that enough? No? Well, you'll have
 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or
 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere
 else.

 As you step on the road, the cars all accelerate towards you, their
 drivers leaning over the steering wheels with fangs bared. You just
 avoid them by swimming as quick as you can to the safety of Dace Road.

 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station
 is to the south, west across Plaice Street is a pub, and east lies
 Shark Street.

 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Hardware Shop
 This hardware shop contains everything for the fish with DIY leanings.
 If your DIY is leaning, this is were you can get the tools to mend it.
 If you require anything the assistant will only be too pleased to take
 your credit, if not your credit card. He may even give it back. You can
 leave the shop by swimming west. The assistant offers to sell you a
 black plastic bag.
>buy bag with fisa

 "That will be 2 clams exactly sir." You type in your Fish Identity
 Number to authorise the debit. The assistant waits for authorisation

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east.
 There is a stool here.

 Abruptly, everything starts heading towards a certain point,
 accompanied by a grotesque sucking noise. Before you have time to react
 you are surrounded by a blinding white light which rapidly expands to
 engulf the whole of Hydropolis. Then silence. You are nothing but a
 handful of minute particles floating in free space. "You blew that,
 didn't you?" Sir Playfair Panchax is clearly not amused. "We'll try and
 get you back to your bowl, but I've got some bad news. The Fins have
 located you. They're out for revenge. Keep your head old chap, this
 could be nasty. Panchax out." You are dumped back in the fishbowl.
 Goldfish Bowl
 A tingle runs up and down your scales here. It's definitely not your
 vacation bowl. True, it does have gravel, ant eggs and pondweed, but
 then so has every goldfish bowl. The difference is you can see out of
 this bowl and it doesn't have a tacky plastic castle. It looks like
 you're in a computer room of some kind, with terminals lining the
 walls.
 "You complete Halibut!" shouts Sir Playfair Panchax. He doesn't sound
 happy at all. "We warned you not to damage Dr. Roach's body. He was the
 only one who could save Hydropolis. The Fins have won and are out to
 get you. There is nothing we at Mission HQ can do." The good news is
 you've been sent back to the bowl. The bad news is that the dimensional
 warps have disappeared. It looks like you're in big trouble.

 The bowl rattles as someone strides over. "It's time for this little
 fish's last meal," says an ominous voice. Then the voice lowers and
 recites menacingly
 "And I am become death, destroyer of worlds."
 Suddenly, some ant eggs are dropped in.

 Suddenly, the ant eggs start dissipating a pale pink solution. Oh no!
 It's an inter-dimensional espionage operative's worst nightmare - the
 dreaded pink anti inter-dimensional espionage operative poison,
 guaranteed to kill not only an inter-dimensional espionage operative's
 host, but to trap him there for ever. To put it bluntly, the guarantee
 hasn't run out. The poison gags your gills. You'll never see Sir
 Playfair or Mission HQ again.

 "Well done, Agent 10," said Sir Playfair Panchax, head of Mission HQ.
 "We knew you'd stop the Seven Deadly Fins. Good show! It's a shame they
 got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned
 it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real
 chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life
 apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite
 relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just
 to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for
 a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the
 payroll.

 Someone's coming. Good, it must be time for food. SPLATTO. A hand as
 big as a bus drops something hard right on your head. Understandably
 dazed, you flip over and, through a swirl of ant eggs, spot what hit
 you: a tacky plastic castle. It looks like a rush job. Sir Playfair
 must be in trouble. And you thought you were on vacation...

 Goldfish Bowl
 Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as
 highly trained as yourself. It looks like the pondweed is dangling from
 the gravel above your head. And the ant eggs, wow! Upside down they
 look, so, so much like, well, like exactly the same as if you were the
 right way up actually. Anyway, there's no need to get carried away. Sir
 Playfair has a message for you in the castle if you're not mistaken and
 he hates agents who are late.

 wouldn't have stolen it. Fortunately, the back room boys got a fix on
 him. He's somewhere in the dimensions. You'll have to go after him,
 Agent 10, and be careful this time." You hear him mumbling in the

>wait

 Time passes.
 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Paddlington. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.
>go south

 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Paddlington.
 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Paddlington Station
 This station is busy. Commuters are flooding down the access funnel to
 the platform, almost overwhelming the guard checking their tickets. The
 ticket clerk, sitting behind a counter, looks quite scared by the mad
 rush too. You can get back to the street westward, but you'd be
 swimming against the tide of commuters.
>go northwest

 This fish has not been modified to swim through walls.
>go west

 Paddlington
 This is the up and coming place to live in Hydropolis. It's also one of
 the busiest, teaming with guppies. Your apartment block is to the north
 and the entrance to the underground station bearing the logo of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company stands to the east.
>go north

 Lobby
 With no security guard, no intercom and no doors, any old eel could
 slip in here and break into every apartment in the block. It's a wonder
 it hasn't happened yet! Mind you, it wouldn't be all bad. At least Dr.
 Roach could get some new furniture with the insurance money. The exit
 out to Paddlington is to the south and the access shaft leads up to the
 landing.
>go up

 You swim into the access shaft and up to the level of your apartment
 Landing
 There are two doors on this level of the apartment block - one to your
 apartment and one to your new neighbour, Ernest Chub's. Beside each
 door is a handprint and an access shaft leads down to the lobby.
>go north

 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
 There is a dark warp here.
>enter dark warp

 You slip through the dark warp into the whirling dimensions. "It's a
 strange place Agent 10," says Sir Playfair's voice in the back of your
 brain. "Those Fins have twisted the dimensions into some kind of
 labyrinth, but it isn't normal. The back room boys are busy trying to
 figure it out. All they can tell me is that the Fins have hidden the
 cylinder in a place where the only way out is up and that if you're
 left in a room with no exits you'll be stuck there until we can get you
 out, which may well be too late to save Hydropolis. You'll have to
 watch your step, Agent 10; we don't want to lose you, old boy. Good
 luck. Panchax out."

 "Well done old boy," says Sir Playfair as you slip back into the
 lounge, "I didn't think you'd make it. That should keep the Fins at bay
 for a while. Top hole. Panchax out." The dark warp swiftly fades.
 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
>inventory

 You are carrying a fishofax, a tatty card, a new card, a travel pass, a
 screwdriver, a hyperdriver, a crystal, a sachet and a cylinder.
 You are wearing a watch, some dark glasses and some ear-plugs.

 Sachet dropped.
>go south

 Landing
 There are two doors on this level of the apartment block - one to your
 apartment and one to your new neighbour, Ernest Chub's. Beside each
 door is a handprint and an access shaft leads down to the lobby.
>go down

 You swim into the access shaft and down to the ground floor.
 Lobby
 With no security guard, no intercom and no doors, any old eel could
 slip in here and break into every apartment in the block. It's a wonder
 it hasn't happened yet! Mind you, it wouldn't be all bad. At least Dr.
 Roach could get some new furniture with the insurance money. The exit
 out to Paddlington is to the south and the access shaft leads up to the
 landing.
>go south

 Paddlington
 This is the up and coming place to live in Hydropolis. It's also one of
 the busiest, teaming with guppies. Your apartment block is to the north
 and the entrance to the underground station bearing the logo of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company stands to the east.
>go east

 Paddlington Station
 This station is busy. Commuters are flooding down the access funnel to
 the platform, almost overwhelming the guard checking their tickets. The
 ticket clerk, sitting behind a counter, looks quite scared by the mad
 rush too. You can get back to the street westward, but you'd be
 swimming against the tide of commuters.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Paddlington.
>wait

 Time passes.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>wait

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Barbellican. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 "Mind the gap," shouts the guard. A pike stops the doors closing to
 allow his aggressive mates on then the train rushes off into the
 tunnel.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Pickerel Underground Station
 This station is teeming with guppies, nipping in and out of the access
 funnel which leads to the platform. A guard, looking rather bored with
 life, checks all their tickets. You can buy tickets from the ticket
 clerk, behind his counter close to the exit southeast.

 Plaza
 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown
 Hydropolis shopping precinct to be like? You expected shops? OK, I'll
 give you some shops. To the north is a clothing shop, to the south is a
 pub and to the west is a cinema. Is that enough? No? Well, you'll have
 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or
 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere
 else.
>se

 As you step on the road, the cars all accelerate towards you, their
 drivers leaning over the steering wheels with fangs bared. You just
 avoid them by swimming as quick as you can to the safety of Dace Road.
 Dace Road
 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station
 is to the south, west across Plaice Street is a pub, and east lies
 Shark Street.
>go east

 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.
>go east

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Hardware Shop
 This hardware shop contains everything for the fish with DIY leanings.
 If your DIY is leaning, this is were you can get the tools to mend it.
 If you require anything the assistant will only be too pleased to take
 your credit, if not your credit card. He may even give it back. You can
 leave the shop by swimming west. The assistant offers to sell you a
 black plastic bag.
>buy bag with fisa

 "That will be 2 clams exactly sir." You type in your Fish Identity
 Number to authorise the debit. The assistant waits for authorisation
 then returns your card, together with the bag.
 You are carrying too much and the fishofax annoyingly falls to the
 ground.

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.

 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads

 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go east

 "I've been standing here for ages," says Bertie Bream , "come on, let's
 go in."
 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
 A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad. Bertie
 Bream is here.

 Suddenly, Bertie Bream gets very nervous and drags you away from the
 entrance. "I can't go in without a tie," he says, "what will everyone
 think of me?" He starts shaking uncontrollably. "You'll have to get me
 one," he quivers, "I can't swim anywhere right now."

 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the
 university. A corridor continues east, and a metal door blocks any
 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.
>put new card in slot

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the
 door slides open smoothly and the card is returned to your waiting
 hand.
>go north

 Research Wing
 This is where a lot of the groundwork for The Project was done by the
 famous Dr. Salmon. Unfortunately his work was shelved to make room for
 your endeavours, and anyway he sniffed far too much. You can swim up
 into the tower from here or pass through the metal door with a slot
 beside it to the south.
 There is a crystal tuna here.
 After allowing time for someone to pass the door closes.
>go up

 Tower
 Water must be evaporating fast; the tower is only half full! You swim
 up and break the surface to take a look around. In the ceiling, high
 above through the air, is a trapdoor, but there seems no way of getting
 there. You dive quickly back underwater before your gills dry out.
>put bag on cylinder

 You can't do that to the cylinder.
>cylinder in bag

 Are you talking to yourself again?
>put cylinder in bag

 The cylinder is now inside the bag.
>open cylinder

 The bag inflates and you hold it tightly closed to prevent the gas
 escaping. You rise up through the tower. There is a loud bang as you
 pass through the trap door, opening it. The roof of the tower lies
 inches below you but you are drifting slowly upwards.
 Roof
 When there was a lot of water around, students came up here to watch
 the teeming city of Hydropolis. A railing around the edge of the roof
 was put here to prevent them being washed away by the deceptively
 strong overcurrent. Now the water has gone that has ceased to be a
 problem. The obvious exit is the trapdoor.
 There is a photon bridge and some railings here.
>SAVE

 Enter saved game to store:
>examine railings

 When there was more water in Hydropolis, students used to come up here
 to admire Hydropolis. Lots of them were swept over the edge by the
 overcurrent so some railings were kindly put up.
 This is fun isn't it? You've drifted even higher now. You are finding
 breathing a little difficult, however, but Hydropolis is stunning from
 this height.
>drop bag

 You let go of the bag and fall at an alarming pace. Roach is clearly
 disturbed, falling is not one of his greatest skills. With a sickening
 SPLAT you strike the surface, bursting like a balloon full of water

 Goldfish Bowl
 A tingle runs up and down your scales here. It's definitely not your
 vacation bowl. True, it does have gravel, ant eggs and pondweed, but
 then so has every goldfish bowl. The difference is you can see out of

 You let go of the bag and fall at an alarming pace. Roach is clearly

 SPLAT you strike the surface, bursting like a balloon full of water
 hitting a concrete floor. That was fun.

 Roof
 When there was a lot of water around, students came up here to watch
 the teeming city of Hydropolis. A railing around the edge of the roof
 was put here to prevent them being washed away by the deceptively
 strong overcurrent. Now the water has gone that has ceased to be a

 You squeeze through the trap door. Not a particularly good move, as
 there's nothing on the other side to support you. Oh well, falling is
 quite good fun. Until you hit the shallow water and slam into the floor
 that is. The host-parasite interface doesn't take too kindly to your
 scant regard for its delicacy and promptly disintegrates, sending you
 hurtling into the dimensions.

 You slide through the railings with your gills about to burst. Roach
 has never practiced falling before, it's a good job your training as an
 inter-dimensional espionage operative has given you the experience to
 be able to survive under such difficult circumstances. You hit the
 water below the tower making a dramatic entrance to Opah. Several of
 the students applaud your efforts.
 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
 A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad. Bertie
 Bream is here.
>go east

 "Please get me a tie. I'll wait here for you," says Bertie Bream .
 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the
 university. A corridor continues east, and a metal door blocks any
 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.

 You are carrying a fishofax, a tatty card, a new card, a travel pass, a
 hyperdriver, a crystal and a photon bridge.

 My worm, it's dark in this corridor. A metal door to the east prevents

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the
 door slides open smoothly and the card is returned to your waiting

 Laboratory
 This lab is exceptionally clean. Dr. Roach must be remarkably
 fastidious. The water is constantly decontaminated and recycled to
 protect The Project equipment and your terminal from damage by grit,
 fluff and dirt. Exits are northeast, southeast and west through the
 metal door to the corridor.
 After allowing time for someone to pass the door closes.

 Store Room
 Even though Dr. Roach is very clean and tidy, the same cannot be said
 of the rest of the team. They've made this the messiest store room in
 the university. And it's always left for you to straighten things out.
 All the equipment and spares needed for The Project are usually stashed
 here, with a wallchart keeping track of what's in and out of stock. The
 only exit leads northwest.
 There is a protocopier here.
>examine protocopier

 The protocopier is a large box with a slot on one side and a simple
 on-off switch where you would expect one, built by Dr. Salmon as a
 prototype Device. While it is indeed remarkable, the University
 authorities took a different view for two reasons: the protocopier used
 so much power that fuel bills reached record levels and secondly, it
 could only teleport in very small amounts of water. It was the downfall
 of Dr. Salmon; he was fired by the principal.

 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads
 to the platform. A ticket clerk sits behind a counter selling tickets
 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Opah University.

 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Angel. The doors

 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the
 access funnel which leads to the platform. The ticket counter stands in
 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.
>go northwest

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.

 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station

>go west

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 Abruptly, everything starts heading towards a certain point,
 accompanied by a grotesque sucking noise. Before you have time to react
 you are surrounded by a blinding white light which rapidly expands to
 engulf the whole of Hydropolis. Then silence. You are nothing but a
 handful of minute particles floating in free space. "You blew that,
 didn't you?" Sir Playfair Panchax is clearly not amused. "We'll try and
 get you back to your bowl, but I've got some bad news. The Fins have

 Abruptly, everything starts heading towards a certain point,
 accompanied by a grotesque sucking noise. Before you have time to react
 you are surrounded by a blinding white light which rapidly expands to
 engulf the whole of Hydropolis. Then silence. You are nothing but a
 handful of minute particles floating in free space. "You blew that,
 didn't you?" Sir Playfair Panchax is clearly not amused. "We'll try and
 get you back to your bowl, but I've got some bad news. The Fins have
 located you. They're out for revenge. Keep your head old chap, this
 could be nasty. Panchax out." You are dumped back in the fishbowl.
 Goldfish Bowl
 A tingle runs up and down your scales here. It's definitely not your
 vacation bowl. True, it does have gravel, ant eggs and pondweed, but
 then so has every goldfish bowl. The difference is you can see out of
 this bowl and it doesn't have a tacky plastic castle. It looks like
 you're in a computer room of some kind, with terminals lining the
 walls.
 "You complete Halibut!" shouts Sir Playfair Panchax. He doesn't sound
 happy at all. "We warned you not to damage Dr. Roach's body. He was the
 only one who could save Hydropolis. The Fins have won and are out to

 Battersea
 Battersea is a place of dreams. The station was built many years ago to
 encourage visits by tourists. Regular tours around the complex leave
 from the north. An access funnel, leading down is fished by a guard who
 is checking tickets, or would be if there were any to check but the
 ticket clerk hasn't sold any.
>go north

 "Welcome to Battersea Power Station." You are met by a tall tour guide,
 who appears to be chewing gum and reading notes off little cue cards.
 She takes you on a guided tour of the entire plant, filling your head
 with facts and figures about throughput, power consumption and blades.
 One thing that stuck in your mind was the interesting, but
 little-known, fact that Battersea is only the secondary power station
 for Hydropolis and is only used during peak demand and to power the
 underground system. After about half an hour, she returns you to the
 power station.
 Power Station
 The power station dwarfs almost anything you have ever seen. Guided
 tours leave from the north, so the citizens of Hydropolis can marvel at
 this fish-made wonder and the sophistication of their engineers. A
 steel door lies to the west near an important gauge and a large switch.
>examine door

 The steel door opens automatically when the pressure from the turbines
 in the area to the west falls below danger levels. For safety reasons,
 it cannot be opened by hand.
 It is closed.
>examine gauge

 The important gauge shows the total electricity output of the Battersea
 sub-station. It is currently displaying a value of 100.
>examine switch

 The switch is just like those seen in fifties science-fiction movies,
 requiring both hands to turn it on or off. It controls the power supply
 to the whole of the tube system. At the moment it is on.
>turn off switch

 With great effort you manage to pull the switch. The light dims
 momentarily and the guppies on the guided tour scream until everything
 returns to normal. The important gauge shows a considerable drop in
 current.
>go west

 The pressure door is closed to protect fish like you from swimming into
 the proximity of the fast moving blades which lie beyond. You may not
 appreciate this extra protection but I'm sure Dr. Roach is delighted.
 Abruptly, everything starts heading towards a certain point,
 accompanied by a grotesque sucking noise. Before you have time to react
 you are surrounded by a blinding white light which rapidly expands to

 Library
 Containing the sum total of fish knowledge, this library is the best in
 all Hydropolis. As fish only have small brains, it is on the smallish
 side, but students spend a lot of time here delving into what knowledge
 there is - even during rag week. The library's rarest book lies on a
 lectern close to the exit in the north wall.
 "On your marks, get set, GO!" Three pairs of students, tied together
 come rushing past you. It's a two-tail race, obviously a ploy to raise
 money for rag week. Then hordes of students swim by, rattling
 collecting tins. It's a good job they don't take Fisa. They swim off.

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting

 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown

 northwest to Pickerel Underground Station if you want to go somewhere

 Clothing Shop
 Behind a counter stands an assistant, ready to sell you anything in the

 Battersea
 Battersea is a place of dreams. The station was built many years ago to

 from the north. An access funnel, leading down is fished by a guard who
 is checking tickets, or would be if there were any to check but the
 ticket clerk hasn't sold any.

 "Welcome to Battersea Power Station." You are met by a tall tour guide,
 who appears to be chewing gum and reading notes off little cue cards.
 She takes you on a guided tour of the entire plant, filling your head
 with facts and figures about throughput, power consumption and blades.
 One thing that stuck in your mind was the interesting, but
 little-known, fact that Battersea is only the secondary power station
 for Hydropolis and is only used during peak demand and to power the
 underground system. After about half an hour, she returns you to the
 power station.
 Power Station
 The power station dwarfs almost anything you have ever seen. Guided
 tours leave from the north, so the citizens of Hydropolis can marvel at
 this fish-made wonder and the sophistication of their engineers. A
 steel door lies to the west near an important gauge and a large switch.

 Tunnel
 You'll have to be very careful in this tunnel; the sharp blades of a
 giant turbine are all around you. They aren't spinning but the turbine

 make up your mind quickly whether you're going to swim east back to the
 power station or further along the tunnel to the west.

 "It's one of the Fins! Stop him Agent 10," screams Sir Playfair in your
 brain as the drunk runs off with the cylinder. You swim frantically

 Playfair scolds. "The cylinder must be important otherwise they
 wouldn't have stolen it. Fortunately, the back room boys got a fix on
 him. He's somewhere in the dimensions. You'll have to go after him,
 Agent 10, and be careful this time." You hear him mumbling in the

 expecting you at ten o'clock this morning. Goodbye." Her face fades
 out, leaving you with the annoying jingle of the Hydropolis
 Telecommunications Network: "HTN, HTN - With your friends you can talk,
 and you won't have to walk, HTN, HTN". Not the most auspicious start to
 a morning.

 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
 Oh, no! You've been burgled! I hope Dr. Roach was insured.
 There is a travel pass here.

 A high speed police fish pulls up outside your apartment block. His

 The host-parasite interface weakens momentarily and you catch a glimpse

 police fish zooms off.
 Paddlington Station
 This station is busy. Commuters are flooding down the access funnel to
 the platform, almost overwhelming the guard checking their tickets. The
 ticket clerk, sitting behind a counter, looks quite scared by the mad
 rush too. You can get back to the street westward, but you'd be
 swimming against the tide of commuters.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Paddlington.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 Steve swims by at top speed.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train

 Noisy, dirty, fishy and grimy. Well, what did you expect a downtown

 Behind a counter stands an assistant, ready to sell you anything in the

 A tie is for sale.

 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.

 You dart across Dace Road while nobody's looking.
 Second Hand Shop
 This shop is run by a cool catfish of many talents, most of them
 illegal, who goes by the name of Steve. Steve is a fish who could sell
 stripes to tiger sharks, but would rather sell them his grandmother -
 if he hasn't already. The shop has a bad reputation. It normally sells
 "fins what have fallen off the back of a submarine" if you get my
 drift. The exit from this den of low morals and high prices is to the
 south. Steve catches your eye, and with a knowing wink suggests that
 you might like to buy a "somewhat fruity" film that came in yesterday.
 You recognise the fishton.
 There is a radio case here.
>buy fishton with fisa

 "Rod," calls Steve, "come here and put the fishton in the van for
 delivery later on." Rod appears from a back room, gives you a knowing
 wink, and leaves with the goods safely in his charge.
 "It's all right I know your address," Steve says as you offer the
 information. He takes your credit card and partly fills in a sales slip
 which he informs you will be duly completed "Later" and returns the

 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where

 We've received information that a junior member of your team has been
 'taken over' and has sabotaged The Project. You don't need me to tell
 you that this could be disastrous for Hydropolis. Naturally, I've
 suspended everyone until further notice. You're the only one I can
 trust; I want you to investigate. I'm going to the government to inform
 them of the danger. I'm not evacuating, so don't worry. I'll be back
 tomorrow." She gets up. "Now please hurry doctor. There's not a second
 to lose." You walk back to the foyer together then go your separate
 ways.

 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where

 Restaurant
 Bursting to the gills, this restaurant serves the finest plankton meals
 in Hydropolis. For the fabulously wealthy, gas-impregnated oils are on
 sale. They may not be as efficient as snifters, but they certainly put
 everyone else in their place! A waiter floats around near the exit to
 the north.

 This station is the oldest in Hydropolis. The decoration reflects more
 decadent times, when men were men, fish were fish and they got together
 to build underground stations. An exit leads north to the museum while
 a funnel leads down to the platform.
>go north

 Museum
 Visited by many fish over the course of a year, the museum is a great
 attraction. Maybe this is due to its unique collection of piscean
 relics, the greatest of which is the skeleton of the
 'Bloodyenormasaurus' which has pride of place in the centre of this
 room. You can explore the museum in your own time by going north, east
 or west. You can return to the station by swimming south.

 Alarm Room
 White rooms always have a bad effect on you. If the authorities had had
 their way, your laboratory would have been white. But you were firm.
 You put your tail down and refused. This room is white, and you don't
 like it. It leads north to the museum's finest exhibit and south back
 to the museum.
>open sachet

 You tear open the sachet. The plankton escapes and starts to slowly
 disperse in the water around you. You notice how the plankton deflects
 the light as it spreads. If you act quickly you should be able to eat
 it before it disperses completely. Your mouth drops open in amazement.
 In the spreading cloud of plankton is the glimmering of myriad light
 beams - clearly the museum alarm system. Ahem!
>go north

 You step past the now visible beams.
 Crystal Room
 This is the most beautiful room you've ever seen. There are no

 Battersea
 Battersea is a place of dreams. The station was built many years ago to
 encourage visits by tourists. Regular tours around the complex leave
 from the north. An access funnel, leading down is fished by a guard who
 is checking tickets, or would be if there were any to check but the
 ticket clerk hasn't sold any.
>go north

 "Welcome to Battersea Power Station." You are met by a tall tour guide,
 who appears to be chewing gum and reading notes off little cue cards.
 She takes you on a guided tour of the entire plant, filling your head
 with facts and figures about throughput, power consumption and blades.
 One thing that stuck in your mind was the interesting, but
 little-known, fact that Battersea is only the secondary power station
 for Hydropolis and is only used during peak demand and to power the
 underground system. After about half an hour, she returns you to the
 power station.
 Power Station
 The power station dwarfs almost anything you have ever seen. Guided
 tours leave from the north, so the citizens of Hydropolis can marvel at
 this fish-made wonder and the sophistication of their engineers. A
 steel door lies to the west near an important gauge and a large switch.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub greets you cheerfully.
>go west

 The pressure door is closed to protect fish like you from swimming into
 the proximity of the fast moving blades which lie beyond. You may not
 appreciate this extra protection but I'm sure Dr. Roach is delighted.

 With great effort you manage to pull the switch. The light dims
 momentarily and the guppies on the guided tour scream until everything
 returns to normal. The important gauge shows a considerable drop in
 current. Whoom! The pressure door opens.
>go west

 Tunnel
 You'll have to be very careful in this tunnel; the sharp blades of a
 giant turbine are all around you. They aren't spinning but the turbine
 could start up again at any moment so it's important not to panic. Just
 make up your mind quickly whether you're going to swim east back to the
 power station or further along the tunnel to the west.

 The tunnel curves upwards here through still, calm water, coming to a

 Shark Street.
>go northwest

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.

 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station

 Shark Street.
>go west

 My, Plaice Street is busy! In the end you succeed in crossing.
 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Bertie Bream and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.

 "Yes I've often wondered about those places," says Bertie, "so many
 possibilities for studies of fish behaviour. Seeing how far we've

 to go across Dace Road to the southeast if you want some more or

 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
 A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad.
>go east

 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the
 university. A corridor continues east, and a metal door blocks any
 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.
>go east

 Corridor
 Windows line the north wall of this corridor which continues east and
 west. They look out onto the quad, and stream light on to an archway

 Corridor
 My worm, it's dark in this corridor. A metal door to the east prevents
 you from swimming directly into your laboratory and the corridor

>put tatty card in slot

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the
 door slides open smoothly and the card is returned to your waiting
 hand.
>go east

 Laboratory
 This lab is exceptionally clean. Dr. Roach must be remarkably
 fastidious. The water is constantly decontaminated and recycled to
 protect The Project equipment and your terminal from damage by grit,
 fluff and dirt. Exits are northeast, southeast and west through the
 metal door to the corridor.
 There is a filter here.
 After allowing time for someone to pass the door closes.

 Project Room
 Considering how important this place is for the future of all fishkind,
 you are stunned by how little has been done to make it look
 significant. A lick of paint, although distasteful for the fish licking
 it on, wouldn't have gone amiss. The only exit is southwest.
 There is a hyperdriver and the device almost fills the room, looking
 like an aquarium filled with multi-coloured gravel here.

 Bertie Bream bangs on the door shouting, "Stop! Stop! Don't touch the
 Device - it's booby trapped." You rush over into the lab and over to
 the door, expecting some kind of trap. "Can you hear me Dr. Roach?" he
 asks desperately, "the Device is booby trapped. It's connected up to a
 computer game called Shutdown which is keeping the Lokscrew locked in
 place. The only way to free it is to stop Shutdown counting down, but I
 don't know how to; the parasite wrote the program. You'll have to log
 in as me; I can't quite remember my password though, I think it's
 'pondweed' but I'm not sure. The parasite could have deceived me. Did
 you get all that?" "Yes, thank you," you shout and he swims away
 saying, "Good luck Dr. Roach." You return to the project room and look
 with dismay upon the lok screw. Another booby trap! This is getting
 dangerous.

 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads
 to the platform. A ticket clerk sits behind a counter selling tickets
 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go down

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Opah University.
 You feel a gusting current from the tunnel as a train clatters into the
 station. The doors open and fish push and shove each other as they get
 on and off.
>go north

 You squeeze your way, sardine like, onto the train with the other
 commuters.
 Tube
 Always busy, the tube trains are packed solid with guppies. Rules have
 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 You notice a guppy flounder around for a bit and then swim off.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>wait

 Time passes.
 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Angel. The doors
 slide open and the commuters swim in and out.
>wait

 Time passes.
 The train is so crowded that the doors just miss your tail when they
 close. The train rumbles into the tunnel with its heavy, sweating load.
>wait

 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 "All aboard," shouts the guard. Some dolphins rush in where angelfish
 fear to tread. The doors close and the train accelerates out of the
 station.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Eelpout Underground Station
 In the ticket hall, commuters are busily swimming up and down the
 access funnel which leads to the platform. The ticket counter stands in
 the centre with a clerk behind it. Northwest an exit leads out onto
 Shark Street.
>go northwest

 The traffic on Shark Street is really busy but eventually you notice a
 small gap and swim hastily across.
 Shark Street
 This is the seedier part of town with shops to match, so watch who
 you're dealing with. South is a music shop, north is a second hand
 shop, across the road to the east is the hardware shop and southeast is
 the nearest underground station, Eelpout. Dace Road, a much safer place
 to be, is to the west.
>go west

 Dace Road
 You are swimming along the south side of Dace Road. The police station
 is to the south, west across Plaice Street is a pub, and east lies
 Shark Street.
>go west

 My, Plaice Street is busy! In the end you succeed in crossing.
 Pub
 The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
 bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
 against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
 from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
 brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
 customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
 "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
 or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
 looking cylinder is behind the bar.
 There is a stool here.
 As you arrive Ernest Chub and Simon Tench greet you cheerfully.
>buy cylinder

 With what?
>buy cylinder with fisa

 "That will be 99 clams, me old mate." says Steve. He gives you the
 cylinder and charges the purchase to your Fisa account. A drunk with
 his left arm in a sling lurches into you as you turn round from the
 bar, knocking the cylinder to the floor. "Sorry guv," he slurs, picking
 it up, "I'll get you another one."
 "It's one of the Fins! Stop him Agent 10," screams Sir Playfair in your
 brain as the drunk runs off with the cylinder. You swim frantically
 after him but he disappears. "Well, you really messed that up," Sir
 Playfair scolds. "The cylinder must be important otherwise they
 wouldn't have stolen it. Fortunately, the back room boys got a fix on
 him. He's somewhere in the dimensions. You'll have to go after him,
 Agent 10, and be careful this time." You hear him mumbling in the
 background then he curtly says, "A warp will open up in Dr. Roach's
 apartment. Use that. Panchax out." You should be more careful if you
 want to keep your job.

 Paddlington Station
 This station is busy. Commuters are flooding down the access funnel to
 the platform, almost overwhelming the guard checking their tickets. The
 ticket clerk, sitting behind a counter, looks quite scared by the mad
 rush too. You can get back to the street westward, but you'd be
 swimming against the tide of commuters.

 Paddlington
 This is the up and coming place to live in Hydropolis. It's also one of

 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company stands to the east.

 With no security guard, no intercom and no doors, any old eel could
 slip in here and break into every apartment in the block. It's a wonder

 Roach could get some new furniture with the insurance money. The exit
 out to Paddlington is to the south and the access shaft leads up to the

 Lounge
 Some would call this apartment small and pretentious, but with house
 prices in Hydropolis the way they are, small and pretentious was all
 Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
 - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
 style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
 am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
 are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
 and, most important, a door to get out.
 Oh, no! You've been burgled! I hope Dr. Roach was insured.

 You slip through the dark warp into the whirling dimensions. "It's a
 strange place Agent 10," says Sir Playfair's voice in the back of your
 brain. "Those Fins have twisted the dimensions into some kind of
 labyrinth, but it isn't normal. The back room boys are busy trying to
 figure it out. All they can tell me is that the Fins have hidden the
 cylinder in a place where the only way out is up and that if you're
 left in a room with no exits you'll be stuck there until we can get you
 out, which may well be too late to save Hydropolis. You'll have to
 watch your step, Agent 10; we don't want to lose you, old boy. Good
 luck. Panchax out."

 A lesser being would have no idea what's going on here. Their brains

 But, for a highly trained inter-dimensional espionage operative, who

 been passed strictly governing the number of fish allowed in each
 carriage but these are often disregarded, especially by sardines and
 pilchards.
 The last few fish, pilchards by the look of them, squeeze onto the
 train. "Mind the doors," shouts the guard as they close. The train
 clatters off into the tunnel.
>wait

 The train speeds through the tunnel then clatters into Barbellican. The
 doors slide open and the commuters swim in and out.

 The train is so crowded that the doors just miss your tail when they

 Platform
 The tracks, leading off into the dark tunnel, lie beyond the northern
 edge of the platform. Trains arrive quite frequently, once every three
 minutes on average, a fact not unnoticed by the section of the
 Hydropolis Underground Omnibus Company responsible for advertising. You
 can go up to ground level via the access funnel to Opah University.
 An underground train is here but looks likely to leave at any moment.
 The train is so crowded that the doors just miss your tail when they
 close. The train rumbles into the tunnel with its heavy, sweating load.
>go up

 You show your pass to the guard and go through.
 Opah Station
 Commuters are busily swimming up and down the access funnel which leads
 to the platform. A ticket clerk sits behind a counter selling tickets
 to fish who lack the simple foresight to buy a pass. You can leave the
 station through the exit to the east.
>go east

 Opah
 If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
 they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
 a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
 swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
 restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
 It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
 itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
 A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad.
>go east

 University Foyer
 The foyer is lined with ancient busts of important looking fish from
 the university's past, an ugly bunch of egg-headed reprobates if ever
 you saw some. West, an impressive arch will take you out of the
 university. A corridor continues east, and a metal door blocks any
 access to the north. The principal's office is to the south.
>put new card in slot

 The card fits neatly into the slot. After a few reassuring buzzes the
 door slides open smoothly and the card is returned to your waiting
 hand.
>go north

 Research Wing
 This is where a lot of the groundwork for The Project was done by the
 famous Dr. Salmon. Unfortunately his work was shelved to make room for
 your endeavours, and anyway he sniffed far too much. You can swim up
 into the tower from here or pass through the metal door with a slot
 beside it to the south.
 There is a crystal tuna here.
 After allowing time for someone to pass the door closes.
>go up

 Tower
 Water must be evaporating fast; the tower is only half full! You swim
 up and break the surface to take a look around. In the ceiling, high
 above through the air, is a trapdoor, but there seems no way of getting
 there. You dive quickly back underwater before your gills dry out.

 The bag inflates and you hold it tightly closed to prevent the gas

 pass through the trap door, opening it. The roof of the tower lies
 inches below you but you are drifting slowly upwards.
 Roof
 When there was a lot of water around, students came up here to watch
 the teeming city of Hydropolis. A railing around the edge of the roof
 was put here to prevent them being washed away by the deceptively
 strong overcurrent. Now the water has gone that has ceased to be a
 problem. The obvious exit is the trapdoor.
 There is a photon bridge and some railings here.
>drop bag

 You release the bag, and it floats gently up into the sky.

 You have now got the photon bridge.
>enter railings

 You slide through the railings with your gills about to burst. Roach
 has never practiced falling before, it's a good job your training as an
 inter-dimensional espionage operative has given you the experience to
 be able to survive under such difficult circumstances. You hit the
 water below the tower making a dramatic entrance to Opah. Several of
 the students applaud your efforts.

 My worm, it's dark in this corridor. A metal door to the east prevents

 There is a brass screw and a lok screw here.
 A student sidles up to you. "We've got the principal," he whispers, "if
 you don't donate to rag week we'll let her go." You hastily decide to
 give them all your loose change, then realise you have none. They
 refuse to take your credit card and swim off, laughing.

 This lab is exceptionally clean. Dr. Roach must be remarkably
 fastidious. The water is constantly decontaminated and recycled to
 protect The Project equipment and your terminal from damage by grit,
 fluff and dirt. Exits are northeast, southeast and west through the

 There is a glass box, a tuned crystal, a filter and a stream

 "We knew you'd stop the Seven Deadly Fins. Good show! It's a shame they
 got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned
 it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real
 chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life
 apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite
 relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just
 to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for
 a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the
 payroll.

 Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as

 six-shooter on his belt, ready to draw, standing thirty feet away and
 facing you.  Your body keeps screaming at you that you should still be

 SPUR
 A Western Misadventure by Kent Tessman (c) 1995-1997
 Written using the Hugo Compiler v2.5
 Release 9 04-27-99
 (New players should type "help".)

 Main Street
   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
 town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
 the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
 here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
 Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.

 Roy Heffer is standing in front of you, his right hand dangling over
 his holster, fingers twitching nervously.  Somewhere in the distance,
 someone strums an out-of-tune Spanish guitar.
