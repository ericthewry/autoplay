 Are you sure you want to quit? Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation,
 library version 0.9.0.








 Your very first night is over in your new house.  It still seems
 surreal that you are now the proud owner of this place.  It doesn't
 quite feel like home yet since you haven't been able to get your
 furniture.  However, you can't get the rental truck until tomorrow.
 Maybe today would be a good idea to explore those woods behind your
 house.  It'll be a good way to kill time until you can get properly
 moved in tomorrow.


 House of Dream of Moon
 An Interactive Collaboration by The IF Whispers Team
 Release 1 / Serial number 071204 / Inform 7 build 5J39 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/11N)
 Type "about" for more information.

 Master Bedroom (on the mattress)
 All that's unpacked in the room is your mattress with a sheet thrown
 over the top of it.  Your dresser is still in storage.  Windows look
 out to the north and west, and the closet lies to the south.  The
 hallway is to the east.

>about
 "House of Dream of Moon" is the third IF Whispers game, written
 consecutively by ten people who only got to see the part before theirs.
 It follows in the glorious footsteps of "The Corn Identity" and "An
 Escape to Remember", but shares nothing but the format and a few
 authors with those games.  Tom Blawgus was the moderator of this
 Whispers incarnation, and wrote the first section.  To see who wrote
 any given section, type "author" while playing that section.

>author
 Scene 1, "Going Exploring", was written by Tom Blawgus.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a house key
   Every Child's Almanac of Lunar Conspiracy

>read almanac
 Rather than start at the beginning of the Almanac, and having no
 curiosity in any specific entry in particular, you flip to a random
 page and begin reading at random:

 Just to make sure, you skim through the ontogeny section. Yeah, you
 were right. Not only is the metatarsal tubercule completely different,
 but larval Overlords are typically the size of small planets. Otherwise
 they're quite like tadpoles, though.

 Out of context, this may or may not make a whole lot of sense, but I
 suppose that's what you get for not looking up a specific entry.

>go south
 The closet's much too small to fit in.

>open closet
 You're not Mr. Fantastic.  You'll need to get up to reach the closet.

 Your vision goes blurry for a second, and a voice seems to be speaking
 to you right out of your brain.

 "Dave?  Dave?  Can you hear me?" says the voice.  "Hang on, we're
 trying to get you out of there."

>wake
 The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.

 The voice continues.  If you concentrate, you can just place the voice
 as Leslie's.  "Listen.  I think we can do this, but we need your help.
 We need to calibrate on this end with something you've held on that
 end.  Can you describe something you've picked up, or something you're
 holding?  Try telling me about it."

>stand
 You get off the mattress.

 Master Bedroom
 All that's unpacked in the room is your mattress with a sheet thrown
 over the top of it.  Your dresser is still in storage.  Windows look
 out to the north and west, and the closet lies to the south.  The
 hallway is to the east.

>describe almanac
 Ever since your youth, this book has been your dearest companion.
 Originally a slender mass-market paperback from Knockoff Press, it now
 bulges under the weight of your painfully cross-referenced annotations
 and additions. It largely deals with how the Atlanteans staged the moon
 landings in order to atrophy America's can-do attitude and defy the
 Cosmic Overlords, but has valuable information on many related topics.

>tell leslie about almanac
 "Aha!  Got it!  Analyzing now..."

 "Perfect!  OK, we've noted Every Child's Almanac of Lunar Conspiracy as
 characteristic of this section, which should help us get a bead on your
 location.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>open closet
 You open the closet, revealing a backpack and a swibble.

 "I really need that room," Leslie says again.  "We almost have a lock
 on your avatar."

 "OK, now we need to know where you are.  Can you tell me about one of
 the rooms you've visited in this section?"

>tell leslie about closet
 "Aha!  Got it!  Analyzing now..."

>examine swibble
 It's just a swibble.

>take all from closet
 backpack: Taken.
 swibble: You can't intefere with a swibble! It would be... well, you
 just can't.

>look up swibble in almanac

 "I really need that room," Leslie says again.  "We almost have a lock

>open backpack
 That's already open.

>xyzzy
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>eat swibble
 (first taking the swibble)
 You can't intefere with a swibble! It would be... well, you just can't.

>tell leslie about bedroom
 "Ah, perfect!  Analyzing the Master Bedroom now..."

 "Great, we have that room now.  That should help.  Re-calibrating..."

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine swibble
 It's just a swibble.

 Leslie pipes up again.  "OK!  I'm going to send you a detangler.  You
 should be able to use it to escape as-is, but if not, I can try sending
 you some attachments.  I've attuned it to your signal in the simulator,
 so it should stay with you.

 A strange beam of green light bathes you, then disappears.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   detangler base (with a trigger attached.)
   a backpack (open but empty)
   a house key
   Every Child's Almanac of Lunar Conspiracy

>examine detangler
 (the detangler base)
 Long and sleek, with various notches for extra attachments.  When it's
 working, you should be able to just fire it.  Attached to the base is a
 trigger.

>fire detangler
 (the detangler base)
 Taking a deep breath, you pull the trigger and shoot the detangler.
 Blue static washes over you and the Master Bedroom, but then
 dissipates.  And you're still in the same room as before.

 "Dave?  We caught a power surge in your location.  That wasn't... drat,
 the detangler didn't work, did it?  OK, we'll try again.  Let me send
 you the focuser; I think the area of effect was too wide."  You wait
 for the green light again.

 After a few moments, you hear cursing from inside your head.  "Um...
 Dave, I'm sorry, but the lock I had for your location is busted.
 You'll need to find your way somewhere else, and try again from there.
 Sorry about that.  I'll work on the focuser; you work on finding your
 way forward."

>look up leslie in almanac
 The Atlantean legends are unclear on whether this figure is meant to
 represent some sort of demon or monster, or if it is merely a human
 being who achieved both great power and great viillainy. Her exact name
 varies according to the source text: sometimes it is written as
 "Lisellyi" or "Leslea"; other sources refer to her as "L'Z'L", perhaps
 as a reference to the holy tetragrammaton. Some modern academics have
 taken to transliterating the name as "Leslie" or even "Lucille",
 although this is generally recognized as a sign of less serious
 scholarship.

>look
 Master Bedroom
 All that's unpacked in the room is your mattress with a sheet thrown
 over the top of it.  Your dresser is still in storage.  Windows look
 out to the north and west, and the closet lies to the south.  The
 hallway is to the east.

>take sheet
 Taken.

>examine mattress
 At least you were able to haul this here on the top of your car.  It
 would have been quite uncomfortable to sleep on the floor.

>wear sheet
 You can't wear that!

>look under mattress
 You find nothing of interest.

>take mattress
 That's hardly portable.

>examine fence
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine west window
 You look out the window and gaze upon your front lawn and the street
 beyond it.

>look under matress
 You find nothing of interest.

>go east

 Hallway
 Peeling paint greets you as you gaze down the hallway.  Once you get
 moved in and get your car back, a trip to the paint store is on your
 list of things to do.  The threadbare carpet leads you south, or you
 can step into your bedroom to the west.  The bathroom lies to the
 north, and there's a spare bedroom to the east.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>examine carpet
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east

 Spare Bedroom
 This is room is about as empty as your bedroom.  There are windows
 looking north and east, and there's a closet to the south.

>open closet
 Opening the closet reveals a flashlight.  The previous owners must have
 forgotten it when they moved out.

>who am i
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>take flashlight
 (putting Every Child's Almanac of Lunar Conspiracy into the backpack to
 make room)
 Taken.

>examine it
 A durable flashlight found in the spare room closet.

 The flashlight is currently switched off.

>l up me in almanac
 You discover nothing of interest in Every Child's Almanac of Lunar
 Conspiracy.

>how big is the backpack
 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>examine east window
 You look out the window and gaze into your back yard and the woods
 beyond.  You can also see the windows of the Sun Room and see a bit of
 the room itself.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>examine sun room
 You can't see any such thing.

>go west

 Hallway
 Peeling paint greets you as you gaze down the hallway.  Once you get

 can step into your bedroom to the west.  The bathroom lies to the
 north, and there's a spare bedroom to the east.

>go north

 Bathroom
 All the usual fixtures are here.  Unfortunately the water isn't turned
 on yet, so you can't use any of them.  It's on your ever-growing list
 of things to do after getting your stuff.

 You can see a surveillance camera here.

>examine camera
 It's the standard bathroom cam, same as in every other place you've
 ever lived.

>shoot camera
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>ask leslie about simulation
 "You were working on the simulator, but something went wrong and it
 started to interface with your brain directly.  Your own memories are
 now influencing the simulator in unpredictable ways, and the simulator
 is trying to keep up.  It's going to get weirder before it gets back to
 normal."

>look up Canada in almanac

 Conspiracy.

>look up conspiracy in almanac
 At the core of the web of lies the Atlanteans have woven: the supposed
 moon landings. It is a shadowy business; you have few answers, but many
 questions. Where did the billions invested in the space program go?
 What really lurks inside the fridge in the NASA headquarters break
 room? What fiendish plan are the Atlanteans concocting against the
 Cosmic Overlords? The answers can only lie in one place: the moon.

>take camera
 That's fixed in place.

>open camera
 That's not something you can open.

>hit it
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>go south

 Hallway
 Peeling paint greets you as you gaze down the hallway.  Once you get
 moved in and get your car back, a trip to the paint store is on your
 list of things to do.  The threadbare carpet leads you south, or you
 can step into your bedroom to the west.  The bathroom lies to the
 north, and there's a spare bedroom to the east.

>peel paint
 You can't see any such thing.

>go south

 Living Room
 Hardwood floors greet you and your steps echo as you walk around the
 room.  There is a window in the west wall looking out into the front
 yard.  The front door is to the west, and the kitchen lies to the east.

>go east

 Kitchen
 A small kitchen, perfect for one.  Cupboards line the north wall, and
 there's a refigerator in the corner next to the oven.  Oh, and there's
 also a kitchen sink.  You can walk west to the living room, or east
 down some steps into the sun room.

>open cupboards
 You open them one by one and find nothing in them.  Your dishes are
 still in storage.

>open fridge
 You open the refrigerator, revealing a water bottle.

>take bottle
 (putting the house key into the backpack to make room)
 Taken.

>examine bottle
 Just the thing to have along in case you get thirsty.

 The water bottle contains water.

>close fridge
 You close the refrigerator.

 Sun Room
 A vast open room at the back of the house with windows on all sides.  A
 door looking something like one you'd see on a barn leads outdoors,
 while the garage is to the southwest.  The kitchen is up some steps to
 the west.

>go southwest

 Garage
 Obviously this garage was built many years ago because there's no way
 the modern car would fit in it.  As a result, it becomes a convenient
 place to store your stuff when you get it out of storage.  The garage
 door lies to the east, but it's locked shut and the realtor forgot to
 give you the key to the padlock.  Another chore for you after moving
 in.

 You can see some cobwebs and some dead flies here.

 Leslie either can't help you with that, or doesn't understand what you
 mean.

>tell leslie about padlock
 "Dave, there's no time," Leslie replies. " You need to find an item you
 can hold and a new room or area to tell me about, or I won't be able to
 pull you out of the simulator.  If you can't find anything to hold, it
 might work to find something that can hold you, instead."

 Sun Room
 A vast open room at the back of the house with windows on all sides.  A

 while the garage is to the southwest.  The kitchen is up some steps to
 the west.

>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

 A giant door more than twice the size of any normal door allows access
 to the back yard beyond.

>open door
 You open the barn door.

>go east

 Back Yard
 A large carpet of green stretches all the way to the back of the
 property where the woods start.  The house is back to the west, and you
 can enter the woods to the east.

>close door
 You close the barn door.

>examine woods
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east
 With anticipation, trepidation and excitement, you enter the woods.

 Edge of the Woods
 Looking back through the trees, you can still make out your house.
 Looking forward, you see the vast wilderness surrounds you that is just
 begging to be explored.  A path meaders through the trees leading east.

 A Great Master stands by the path in watchful posture. You are
 awestruck. No one mentioned when you bought the house that you would be
 graced with such a blessing.

 The Great Master acknowldeges you with a wave of its foreclaw, and you
 hear its voice resonate in your head: GREETINGS, SOFT ONE. ACCESS TO
 THE WOODS IS RESTRICTED.

>examine great master
 Magnificent, benevolent, wise, and at least eight feet tall. To gaze on
 it is to be honored. Its carapace is brilliant green, its compound eyes
 are irridescent blue-red. It stands in the Ready Watcher pose, four
 legs on the ground, its great knifelike foreclaws crossed in front of
 its thorax.

>look up great master in almanac
 You discover nothing of interest in Every Child's Almanac of Lunar

 pull you out of the simulator.  If you can't find anything to hold, it
 might work to find something that can hold you, instead."

 More static, and you hear Leslie's voice again.  "You dropped off our
 old lock, so it looks like you've made it to a new section.  Tell us
 about something you've held and about a room you see, and I'll try to
 send a focuser.

>talk to master

 You can't see any such thing.

 Scene 2, "Introducing the Great Masters", was written by Carl
 Muckenhoupt.

 You can barely even articulate the thought.

 A neatly manicured lawn greets you and runs all the way to the

 to the east.

>go south

 Driveway
 The concrete is cracked but is still servicable to park your car.  The
 garage itself lies to the east, but there's no handle on this side of
 the garage door.  Add a trip to the hardware store to your list of
 things to do.

 A lesser mantid stands here, staring fascinated at the reflection of
 the sunlight reflected on the pavement by the rear view mirror.

 You can also see a car here.

>take mantid
 It skitters away at your approach.

>examine mantid
 A beautiful insectoid, related to the Great Masters, but not
 intelligent, and much smaller.  This one is barely the size of a dog.

>examine car
 Your trusty car that can get you places, except into the woods.

 The lesser mantid stridulates plaintively.

>give flies to mantid
 You kneel down and hold out the dead flies on your palm. The mantid
 approaches cautiously, then delicately picks up the flies in its
 mandibles one by one and crunches them down. It seems less skittish
 now.

>take mantid
 It nestles into your arms and leans against your shoulder, its
 chitinous spines gently pricking your skin.

 Your trusty car that can get you places, except into the woods.

 You place it on the ground in front of the Great Master, who places its
 foreclaws around its neck protectively. You hear the Great Master's
 voice in your head: WE THANK YOU FOR THE RETURN OF THE BELOVED. YOU ARE
 LOYAL, SOFT ONE.

 The lesser mantid uses a foreclaw to clean its large, soulful compopund
 eyes.

>tell leslie about mantid
 "Aha!  Got it!  Analyzing now..."

 "Perfect!  OK, we've noted the lesser mantid as characteristic of this
 section, which should help us get a bead on your location.

 "OK, can you tell us about one of the places you've visited from this

 "Great, we have that room now.  That should help.  Re-calibrating..."

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

 Another beam of green light hits you and your load feels a bit heavier.
 "There you go!" Leslie says.  "I've sent you another attachment that

 You are carrying:

     detangler base (with a trigger attached.)

 The Great Master casually snips off the lesser mantid's head, then
 picks up and eats its body.

>fire detangler
 (the detangler base)
 With the focuser attached, you pull the trigger once more.  Bright blue
 static pours out of it and crackles around your feet.  For a moment,
 the scene seems to shift... but then it dies out, and you're back to
 where you were before.

 "Not again!" Leslie complains.  "Let me check my readouts.  Hmm.  OK,
 maybe you just need more power.  If you can get to a new section and
 get me a lock there, I'll send you an extra power source.

>look
 Edge of the Woods
 Looking back through the trees, you can still make out your house.
 Looking forward, you see the vast wilderness surrounds you that is just
 begging to be explored.  A path meaders through the trees leading east.

 A Great Master stands by the path in watchful posture.

 You can also see a lesser mantid head here.

>ask master about beloved
 IT WILL STRAY NO MORE.

>get head
 Taken.

>examine head
 Well, you're sure it was justified.

>ask master about love
 LOVE IS SOMETIMES HARSH. WE DO WHAT WE MUST.

>eat master

 I don't suppose the Great Master would care for that.

>go east
 Fallen leaves crunch underfoot as you trundle exploritatively down the
 sun-dappled path. Fresh air, exercise, the beauty of nature: all is
 good. Until, quite suddenly, you get an uncanny feeling, like someone
 stepped on your grave.

 You can't put your finger on it at first. Then you notice that the
 small clearing you've stepped into is perfectly spherical, the trees
 bending around it and in some cases cut by an invisible field.  And you
 understand: this is a blast site. Unwholesome relic of the war, a zone
 of anti-life created by the humans' weapons when they tried to... to...

 You choke back tears. How could people have ever been so foolish?

 Blast Site
 There's a perfectly spherical gap in the forest here, thirty feet in
 diameter, where nothing can grow.  Tall maple and birch trees bend
 around this bubble of unlife.  Distant blackbirds call.

 A path has been hacked through the forest to the east, and you can see
 something to the northeast.

 In the fused earth at your feet, you see a hint of something yellow.

>eat head
 That's plainly inedible.

>give head to master
 You can only do that to something animate.

 Somewhere, a red-winged blackbird gives a throaty cry in defense of its
 tree.

>author
 Scene 3, "End of the World", was written by Ricardo Dague.

>dig
 The fused earth is too hard to dig in with your hands.

 Leslie says, "Looks like you've gotten to a new section.  I'll need
 another room and object to reestablish a lock.  After that, I can send
 you a power pack."

>tell leslie about clearing
 "Dave, there's no time," Leslie replies. " You need to find an item you
 can hold and a new room or area to tell me about, or I won't be able to
 pull you out of the simulator.  If you can't find anything to hold, it
 might work to find something that can hold you, instead."

 Trickling through the forest is a small, clear stream.

 Just to make sure, you skim through the ontogeny section. Yeah, you
 were right. Not only is the metatarsal tubercule completely different,
 but larval Overlords are typically the size of small planets. Otherwise
 they're quite like tadpoles, though.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Your very first night is over in your new house.  It still seems
 surreal that you are now the proud owner of this place.  It doesn't
 quite feel like home yet since you haven't been able to get your
 furniture.  However, you can't get the rental truck until tomorrow.
 Maybe today would be a good idea to explore those woods behind your
 house.  It'll be a good way to kill time until you can get properly
 moved in tomorrow.

 Master Bedroom (on the mattress)
 All that's unpacked in the room is your mattress with a sheet thrown
 over the top of it.  Your dresser is still in storage.  Windows look
 out to the north and west, and the closet lies to the south.  The
 hallway is to the east.

 You get off the mattress.

 All that's unpacked in the room is your mattress with a sheet thrown
 over the top of it.  Your dresser is still in storage.  Windows look
 out to the north and west, and the closet lies to the south.  The
 hallway is to the east.

>open closet
 You open the closet, revealing a backpack and a swibble.

>take backpack
 Taken.

>take sheet
 Taken.

 Your vision goes blurry for a second, and a voice seems to be speaking
 to you right out of your brain.

 "Dave?  Dave?  Can you hear me?" says the voice.  "Hang on, we're
 trying to get you out of there."

>go east

 Hallway
 Peeling paint greets you as you gaze down the hallway.  Once you get
 moved in and get your car back, a trip to the paint store is on your
 list of things to do.  The threadbare carpet leads you south, or you
 can step into your bedroom to the west.  The bathroom lies to the
 north, and there's a spare bedroom to the east.

 The voice continues.  If you concentrate, you can just place the voice
 as Leslie's.  "Listen.  I think we can do this, but we need your help.
 We need to calibrate on this end with something you've held on that
 end.  Can you describe something you've picked up, or something you're
 holding?  Try telling me about it."

>go east

 Spare Bedroom
 This is room is about as empty as your bedroom.  There are windows
 looking north and east, and there's a closet to the south.

>tell leslie about bedroom
 Which do you mean, the Master Bedroom, or the Spare Bedroom?

>master
 "Ah, perfect!  Analyzing the Master Bedroom now..."

 "Great, we have that room now.  That should help.  Re-calibrating..."

 "We still need an item you've picked up," Leslie tells you.

>tell leslie about almanac
 "Aha!  Got it!  Analyzing now..."

 "Perfect!  OK, we've noted Every Child's Almanac of Lunar Conspiracy as
 characteristic of this section, which should help us get a bead on your
 location.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>open closet
 Opening the closet reveals a flashlight.  The previous owners must have
 forgotten it when they moved out.

 Leslie pipes up again.  "OK!  I'm going to send you a detangler.  You
 should be able to use it to escape as-is, but if not, I can try sending
 you some attachments.  I've attuned it to your signal in the simulator,
 so it should stay with you.

 A strange beam of green light bathes you, then disappears.

>take flashlight
 (putting Every Child's Almanac of Lunar Conspiracy into the backpack to
 make room)
 Taken.

>fire detangler
 (the detangler base)
 Taking a deep breath, you pull the trigger and shoot the detangler.
 Blue static washes over you and the Spare Bedroom, but then dissipates.
 And you're still in the same room as before.

 "Dave?  We caught a power surge in your location.  That wasn't... drat,
 the detangler didn't work, did it?  OK, we'll try again.  Let me send
 you the focuser; I think the area of effect was too wide."  You wait
 for the green light again.

 After a few moments, you hear cursing from inside your head.  "Um...
 Dave, I'm sorry, but the lock I had for your location is busted.
 You'll need to find your way somewhere else, and try again from there.
 Sorry about that.  I'll work on the focuser; you work on finding your
 way forward."

>go west

 Peeling paint greets you as you gaze down the hallway.  Once you get

 Living Room
 Hardwood floors greet you and your steps echo as you walk around the

 yard.  The front door is to the west, and the kitchen lies to the east.

 Kitchen
 A small kitchen, perfect for one.  Cupboards line the north wall, and
 there's a refigerator in the corner next to the oven.  Oh, and there's
 also a kitchen sink.  You can walk west to the living room, or east
 down some steps into the sun room.

>open fridge
 You open the refrigerator, revealing a water bottle.

 Taken.

>close fridge
 You close the refrigerator.

>go east

 Sun Room
 A vast open room at the back of the house with windows on all sides.  A
 door looking something like one you'd see on a barn leads outdoors,
 while the garage is to the southwest.  The kitchen is up some steps to
 the west.

>open door
 You open the barn door.

>go southwest

 Garage
 Obviously this garage was built many years ago because there's no way
 the modern car would fit in it.  As a result, it becomes a convenient
 place to store your stuff when you get it out of storage.  The garage
 door lies to the east, but it's locked shut and the realtor forgot to
 give you the key to the padlock.  Another chore for you after moving
 in.

 You can see some cobwebs and some dead flies here.

>take all
 cobwebs: You obliterate the unclean thing.  Hopefully you can forget
 that your beautiful new home ever contained such inappropriate filth.
 dead flies: (putting the sheet into the backpack to make room)
 Taken. Ick.

 to the east.

>go west
 Today's not the day to explore the neighborhood.  Today's the day to
 explore the woods.

>go south

 Driveway
 The concrete is cracked but is still servicable to park your car.  The
 garage itself lies to the east, but there's no handle on this side of
 the garage door.  Add a trip to the hardware store to your list of
 things to do.

 A lesser mantid stands here, staring fascinated at the reflection of
 the sunlight reflected on the pavement by the rear view mirror.

 You can also see a car here.

>give flies to mantid
 You kneel down and hold out the dead flies on your palm. The mantid
 approaches cautiously, then delicately picks up the flies in its
 mandibles one by one and crunches them down. It seems less skittish
 now.

>save

 It nestles into your arms and leans against your shoulder, its

 Back Yard
 A large carpet of green stretches all the way to the back of the
 property where the woods start.  The house is back to the west, and you
 can enter the woods to the east.

>go east
 Are you going to leave your house open when you explore?

 The lesser mantid gently squeezes your arm in its powerful mandibles.

>close door
 You close the barn door.

>go east
 With anticipation, trepidation and excitement, you enter the woods.

 Edge of the Woods
 Looking back through the trees, you can still make out your house.
 Looking forward, you see the vast wilderness surrounds you that is just
 begging to be explored.  A path meaders through the trees leading east.

 A Great Master stands by the path in watchful posture. You are
 awestruck. No one mentioned when you bought the house that you would be
 graced with such a blessing.

 The Great Master acknowldeges you with a wave of its foreclaw, and you
 hear its voice resonate in your head: GREETINGS, SOFT ONE. ACCESS TO
 THE WOODS IS RESTRICTED.

>ask master about access
 THE WOODS HIDE A TERRIBLE THING. ACCESS IS PERMITTED ONLY TO THOSE OF
 ASSURED LOYALTY.

>ask master about loyalty
 A SERVICE IS REQUIRED. RESTORE THE BELOVED TO US.

>give mantid to master
 You place it on the ground in front of the Great Master, who places its
 foreclaws around its neck protectively. You hear the Great Master's
 voice in your head: WE THANK YOU FOR THE RETURN OF THE BELOVED. YOU ARE
 LOYAL, SOFT ONE.

 The lesser mantid stridulates plaintively.

 More static, and you hear Leslie's voice again.  "You dropped off our
 old lock, so it looks like you've made it to a new section.  Tell us
 about something you've held and about a room you see, and I'll try to
 send a focuser.

 Blast Site
 There's a perfectly spherical gap in the forest here, thirty feet in

 around this bubble of unlife.  Distant blackbirds call.

 A path has been hacked through the forest to the east, and you can see

 On the very edge of the blast radius, you can see older trees that were
 partly sheared away, and healed over. The newer growth simply bends
 around the dead zone, as if growing around a wall. Branches hang down
 to within several inches of the upper boundary.

>climb trees
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

 Leslie says, "Looks like you've gotten to a new section.  I'll need

>go southwest

 Blast Site
 There's a perfectly spherical gap in the forest here, thirty feet in
 diameter, where nothing can grow.  Tall maple and birch trees bend
 around this bubble of unlife.  Distant blackbirds call.

 A path has been hacked through the forest to the east, and you can see
 something to the northeast.

 In the fused earth at your feet, you see a hint of something yellow.

>kick fused
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>go east

 Path
 The forest presses around this narrow throughway leading west to east.

>go east

 Continuing the Path
 The path leads from the west to the southeast, where you sense
 something oddly sinister.

>se

 Near a Huge Device
 The trees have been cut back to make room for this tall device. Looking
 up at it, you see that it looks like...a phallus? Oh wait, it's a
 missile. Kind of the same thing, but instead of a little death there's
 great big death.

 A cheerful-looking man in a black two-piece suit and black horn-rimmed
 glasses stands nearby studying the huge device.

 You can also see some rope and a shovel here.

>take rope, shovel
 rope: The industrial-purpose rope far too heavy for you to lift.
 shovel: The man stops you, saying, "Here now, does that belong to you?"

>examine man
 This guy looks like an insurance salesman from the 50s!

 There's a pause, then he says, "Ah, lovely day, isn't it?"

>examine missile
 It's sixty feet tall and gleaming white! An American flag and skull and
 bones are painted on one side.

>author
 Scene 3, "End of the World", was written by Ricardo Dague.

>ask man about himself
 He says, "The name is McWiggy."

>ask man about american foreign policy
 There's a pause, then he says, "Ah, lovely day, isn't it?"

>ask mcwiggy about missile
 He says, "It's a fine, fine missile, isn't it? If you saw the blast
 site to the west, well, that was this fella's little brother's work!
 Did a beautiful job!"

>ask mcwiggy about blast site
 He says, "You didn't find anything alive there, did you?" His eyes
 twinkle behind the thick lenses. "If you did there'd be something
 seriously wrong! When one of our missiles land on something, it's
 completely gone!  In fact, if you did find anything alive there, I
 don't know what I'd do!"

 "No thank you," he says, patting his missile. "This here is all I need
 to be happy."

>punch prosser
 You can't see any such thing.

>go up
 You can't go that way.

>show tadpole to mcwiggy
 (first taking the tadpole)
 The mouth of the bottle is too narrow to stick your fingers in.

>show bottle to mcwiggy
>tell man about yellow
 He looks at it a bit nervously.  "Ew, life," he says.  "At least you
 didn't find that in the blast site!  That would be tragic."  He
 shudders.

 This provokes no reaction.

>ask mcwiggy about life
>take shovel
 He says, "Tut tut! Can't have any more life than necessary, can we?
 That's why I'm here."

 The man stops you, saying, "Here now, does that belong to you?"

>yes
 He grins. "Carry on, then!"

>get shovel
 You already have that.

>ask mcwiggy for shovel
 The cheerful man has better things to do.

 You dig for a few minutes, turning up an old helmet!

>examine helmet
 The standard army helmet is dirty and cracked. A strange green film is
 on the inside of it.

 You can't make out what it is.

 The water falls through the cracks in the helmet, but the tadpole is

 He stares at the item, his cheer quickly turning into horror. He says,
 "What is this?! If you found this helmet in the blast site, and the
 tadpole was in the helmet, then that means...something was left alive!
 The missile was a failure? I don't believe it! I refuse to believe it!"

 The man starts running in circles! He's lost his mind!

>take missile
 You can't, because suddenly the man runs at you, making you jump
 backwards! You land on the coil of rope!

 "So sorry," he says, and pulls out a something that looks like a large
 cellphone. "I know what to do now. If this missile is fired and
 destroys its target, then we'll know that the last failure was just a
 fluke, right?"

>hit man
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 The man says, "Level B checks clear! Begin firing sequence!" Then he
 notices you again, "I thought I told you to go! This is a holy launch
 and you have no right to be here!"

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>throw rope at man

 The industrial-purpose rope far too heavy for you to lift.

 The missile starts making a humming sound, and steam begins blowing out
 of the base. "It's about to fire!" he yells at you. "I guess there's no
 helping it, if you really need to stay. Bask in the glory with me!"

>bask
 What do you want to ask the upset man for?

>shoot detangler

 With some trepidation, you fire the detangler again, but nothing
 happens.

 Suddenly the missile roars and flame and smoke shoot out of the base.
 The heat is becoming unbearable! The man chortles madly. "Success!
 Success! Off you go to wreak havoc my boy!"

 As it lifts off you and the man and everything around are consumed in
 flame!

 Your very first night is over in your new house.  It still seems
 surreal that you are now the proud owner of this place.  It doesn't
 quite feel like home yet since you haven't been able to get your
 furniture.  However, you can't get the rental truck until tomorrow.
 Maybe today would be a good idea to explore those woods behind your
 house.  It'll be a good way to kill time until you can get properly
 moved in tomorrow.

>examine rope
 It's a coil of very large-diameter rope, maybe three inches. On one end
 is a hook.

 After pressing a few buttons, the man looks up at the missile. "System
 check is okay!" he says, then turns to you, "I suggest you leave. The
 blast from the rocket engine will kill everyone in this area!"

>tie hook to missile
 You throw it at the missile! It sticks on! The man yells at you, "You
 better not have scratched that!"

 The man says, "Level B checks clear! Begin firing sequence!" Then he
 notices you again, "I thought I told you to go! This is a holy launch
 and you have no right to be here!"

>pull rope
 Nothing obvious happens.

 The missile starts making a humming sound, and steam begins blowing out
 of the base. "It's about to fire!" he yells at you. "I guess there's no
 helping it, if you really need to stay. Bask in the glory with me!"

>climb rope
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

 Suddenly the missile roars and flame and smoke shoot out of the base.
 The heat is becoming unbearable! The man chortles madly. "Success!
 Success! Off you go to wreak havoc my boy!"

 It lifts off, with the hook, the rope, and yourself being pulled along!
 The man yells, "What do you think you're doing?! You altered the
 trajectory! It's going straight up!"

 As he falls away below, the man is waving his arms, "Hold your breath!
 Hold your breath!"

 The missile is roaring towards space, with you in tow! Air and clouds
 whip by you and the earth below is getting smaller and smaller.

 The missile will enter outer space in just a moment!

 You courageously continue holding your breath.

 Flying Through Space
 The missile is shooting toward the moon with you right behind! There's
 deathly silence here in outer space.

 You courageously continue holding your breath.

>scream

>examine moon
 It is great big and rock-colored!

 Terrifyingly, you fly along!

 You courageously continue holding your breath.

 They twinkle silently.

 Oh no, you're about to hit the moon!

 You courageously continue holding your breath.

>examine moon
 It is great big and rock-colored!

 With a huge crash, the rocket hits the moon! How you have survived, you
 don't know.

 Though stunned momentarily, you slowly open your eyes and stand up...

 Lunar Crater
 Wow you've landed on the moon! Gray, rocky, dusty, airless landscape
 stretches all around.

 A double line of suspicious footprints leads to the crater's center.

 Holding your breath is becoming difficult!

>follow footprints

>enter crater

 There does seem to be an easier climb to the north, however.

>go north

 Scenic Overlook
 You stand on the lip between two overlapping lunar craters; the one
 into which you crash-landed is dwarfed by the immense, ancient crater
 before you. Far below you on the crater floor, you can make out patches
 of green; beyond that, a sprawling silvery mass, many kilometres to the
 north, that can only be the secret Atlantean lunar base. First,
 however, you have to find some way of getting down this cliff.

>breathe
 You remember that the moon's supposed lack of atmosphere is, in fact,
 yet another scientific hoax. You hadn't realised how deeply the
 education system had planted lies in your psyche.

 You breathe out. Hahhhhh.

>examine footprints
 You look to the south, toward the crater in which you crash-landed.  In
 addition to your own tracks, a set of footprints reach a patch of
 smooth ground at the crater's centre, then double back.

>look up moon in almanac
 Why does the moon coincidentally look exactly the same size as the sun?
 Why did all ancient civilisations venerate a Moon deity? Why do the
 Freemasons have no lodges in Antarctica? If you're not convinced by
 now, there's clearly no hope for you.

 Leslie contacts you once more.  "Good job!  Another section.  Get me

 "Perfect!  OK, we've noted the crate of wine as characteristic of this
 section, which should help us get a bead on your location.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>take crate
 Even in lunar gravity, the crate is too heavy for a mere Earth-human to
 lift.

 "OK, can you tell us about one of the places you've visited from this
 section?" Leslie asks.

 "Dave, you already visited that room in the last section.  I need a new
 room for this section if I'm going to be able to lock on to your
 location properly."

>take wine bottle
 Glancing around to make sure you are unobserved, you snaffle a bottle
 of delicious wine.

>examine wine bottle
 (the delicious wine)
 A bottle of Wachawoomagoo Slope, a perfectly respectable if
 little-known pinot noir from the Ibn Battuta vinyards.

>tell leslie about moon
 "Dave, there's no time," Leslie replies. " You need to find an item you
 can hold and a new room or area to tell me about, or I won't be able to
 pull you out of the simulator.  If you can't find anything to hold, it
 might work to find something that can hold you, instead."

 "Ah, perfect!  Analyzing Scenic Overlook now..."

 "Great, we have that room now.  That should help.  Re-calibrating..."

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>tell leslie about wine bottle

 Another beam of green light hits you and your load feels a bit heavier.

>attach stabilizer to detangler
 (the detangler base)
 With a click and a pop, you permanently attach the stabilizer to the
 detangler base.

>fire detangler
 (the detangler base)
 Holding your breath and closing your eyes, you fire the detangler.
 Click.  You open your eyes.  You're still where you were before.  You
 pull the trigger again.  Click.  Nothing.  "Leslie?" you ask, "did
 something go wrong?  The detangler won't fire."

 "What?  Oh, no!  The power pack must be drained.  Grar; I'll send you a
 recharger.  I've used up the lock on this section, though; you'll have
 to go somewhere else and do it all again."  With a sigh, you pack the
 detangler away again.

 A sprawling silvery mass, yes.  And filled, no doubt, with treachery.

>jump
 The cliffs look too steep to climb easily. Even in lunar gravity, the
 fall could be fatal. Well... probably. You don't really feel brave
 enough to find out.

>examine green
 Tiny patches of green dot the otherwise harsh landscape far below.  If
 only you could find some way to explore that verdant Eden...

>drink wine
 Pulling the cork out with your teeth, you knock back the bottle with
 gusto, then lob the bottle into low orbit.

>examine d
 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>fly

 You peer over the side. It doesn't really look that dangerous. Still,
 it might be better if you were a little more lubricated first, or had
 some protection.

 Thanks to lunar gravity and the relaxing effects of pinot noir, you
 avoid being splattered like a ripe tomato. And would a true hero be
 slowed down by a fractured arm? Hardly!

 Lunar Vinyard
 Ah, the sun-kissed slopes of Jules Verne Crater, where the grape grows
 and the wallabies frolic. Presumably. You've yet to see any wallabies,
 but there are certainly grapevines aplenty.

 You can see a big craggy moon rock here.

 This is a pretty big moon rock - you could probably sit down on it and
 take a load off, except that its surface is pretty rough and craggy and
 it doesn't look all that comfortable.

>examine grapes
 You see nothing special about the grape vines.

 You get onto the big craggy moon rock.

 "OK, you've moved on.  You look for a room and object, and I'll get you
 a recharger."  Leslie sounds a bit haggard, but hopeful.

>take rock
 Uuuugh!  Nope, you can't lift it.

>take grapes
 That's hardly portable.

 Around the edge of a nearby trellis wanders a heretofore unseen wombat.

 Wait.  Wombat?!  Wombats don't exist.  They're like... wallabies.  And
 kangaroos.  And walaroos.  And Tasmanian devils.  And dingoes who eat
 babies.  They're all made up, mythical creatures from the fictional
 continent of Australia...

 You rub your eyes in disbelief, but when you look again, the wombat is
 still there.  Upon seeing you, he stops, cocks his head, then narrows
 his eyes and wrinkles his hairy snout.  He appears to be... snarling.
 It's all a bit of a farce, really - something so little and adorable as
 a wombat trying to look threatening.

 What was it you heard about Wombats, anyway?  They're herbivores...
 right?

 Deceptively adorable, these mythical creatures from the fictional
 continent of Australia are about a meter long, with a very short tail.
 A favorite prey of the Tasmanian devil (also mythical), wombats are
 generally thought to be shy herbivores.  Legend holds, however, that
 they possess sharp teeth and claws, can run at 40 km/hr, and have been
 known to kill the (equally mythical) dingo.  They have even been known
 to exist in vinyards.  That is, if they're actually real, which they're
 not.  But if they were  real, it would also be interesting to note that
 their scat is cubical.

 Before you can make a move, the deceptively adorable wombat leaps
 forward and tries to eviscerate you with his mighty digging claws!
 You're able to tear away from his vicious teeth just in time...

 You might want to keep track of how you're doing by diagnosing
 yourself.

 A weighty appendix, which constitutes about three-quarters of the

 continents as Atlantis, Lemuria, Mu and Australia. Despite their
 technical non-existence, cultural belief in them sustains their
 para-existence in the collective subconscious, better known as the
 moon.

 Before you can make a move, the deceptively adorable wombat sprints

 That was a pretty good hit, but it'll take more than that to put the
 little blighter in line.

 him in the side as he goes by!

 The wombat seems to have lost some of the spring in its step.

>backhand wombat

>hit wombat
 You take a short running kick at the wombat, and it connects!  The
 wombat goes flying!

 The wombat is doesn't look quite so agile anymore.  I think you could
 probably finish the little bugger off.

>hit wombat
 You put everything you have in a solid roundhouse kick, and the wombat
 shuffles away, yelping!

 That final blow proved to be too much for the wombat - it lies down,
 rolls over onto its back, its little furry feet wiggle for a few
 seconds, and then the marsupial goes limp.

 Looking down upon its adorable frame, you feel a twinge of remorse.
 "It was trying to kill me," you think to yourself.  "I had no choice
 but to strike..."  You feel a sudden, odd desire to pet the poor
 misguided creature.  As you reach out, however, the body starts to
 shimmer, then fade.  Soon, it is gone altogether.
>diagnose me








 You hear a whisper from behind you.  It says, "You have proven yourself
 worthy."

 You turn around to see a shimmering face suspended in the air at eye
 level.  It is the most beautiful face you have ever seen; being in its
 presence fills you with a mixture of both fear and awe.  "Are you...
 one of the Cosmic Overlords?" you stammer.

 The face smiles at you benevolently.  "Yes.  The marsupial was... a
 test.  It is difficult to bring oneself to strike such a fluffy,
 adorable creature.  Some are so entranced by its fluffiness that they
 can never bring themselves to attack it - even if it means their own
 death.  Through your skill and bravery in Wombat Combat, you have
 proven yourself worthy of our cause.  You will fight the Atlanteans,
 who in their perfidiousness will use many tricks in an attempt to stay
 your hand.  Do not fall victim to their beguiling ways.

 "But... I'm hurt.  How can I be of any use?" you whine.

 The Cosmic Overlord rolls its eyes, sighs heavily, and says to you,
 "Okay, we're not supposed to help you out this much, but just this once
 we will..."  There is a tingling sensation in your arm... you feel...
 fantastic.  And your arm seems to have healed.

 "Gee, thanks, Overlord.  Say, not to sound ungrateful or anything -
 because I'm certainly very grateful indeed - but... is there anyway you
 could help me get to the Atlantean Base?"

 The Overlord narrows its eyes at you.  "Okay, fine, but really, this is
 the last time we're helping you.
>examine overlord

 "Like, really."
>look








 There is a sudden, blinding flash of light, followed by... you're not
 sure what.  When you regain consciousness, you find yourself in an
 entirely different place.

 Outside Atlantean Base
 You find yourself lying on the ground outside the Atlantean Base.  You
 get up, dust yourself off, and begin to take in your surroundings.  The
 silvery walls of the base rise tall into the starry sky, and seem to
 stretch on endlessly in either direction.  Behind you, to the south,
 lies a vast, unwelcoming expanse of moonscape.

 You gaze up at the massive, silvery walls with a heavy heart - you
 don't see any way inside, at least not right off the bat.  Damn those
 Atlanteans and their treacherous ways.  They must have known you were
 coming, and built this giant wall just to thwart you!

 "No, Dave, we're losing you!" Leslie cries.  "Don't..." and then her
 voice is cut off.
 The detangler base disappears!
 The focuser disappears!
 The power pack disappears!
 The stabilizer disappears!

 Plain Silver Room
 The interior of the Atlantean's base is a great deal more hospitable

 this room are as shiny and silvery as the giant silvery wall was
 outside. A simple, unmarked doorway leads north.
 At last - you're on the brink of discovering what fate your parents

 that Aunt Bertha was your aunt by marriage and not by blood...

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Your very first night is over in your new house.  It still seems
 surreal that you are now the proud owner of this place.  It doesn't
 quite feel like home yet since you haven't been able to get your
 furniture.  However, you can't get the rental truck until tomorrow.
 Maybe today would be a good idea to explore those woods behind your
 house.  It'll be a good way to kill time until you can get properly
 moved in tomorrow.

 Deep Interior Room
 Even deeper still inside the Atlantean Base.  You're not sure any more
 if this means you're getting closer to finding your parents. Complex
 machinery hums deep within, and complex controls line every wall of
 this large, cavernous room.  The walls are still silvery, though.
 There does not appear to be any exit.

 A hairline fracture can be seen in the southeast wall, not even wide
 enough to put your fingernail inside.

>look up mom in almanac
 Your mother was a beautiful, amazing woman, as far as you can remember.
 Unfortunately, she was abducted by the Atlanteans when you were but a
 wee child, and you were sent to live with horrible Aunt Bertha.

>look up aunt bertha in almanac
 Aunt Bertha wasn't exactly your favorite aunt.  When you were forced to
 stay with her as a child, she told you horrible, terrible bedtime
 stories about small children being eviscerated by wallabies.

>look up wallabies in almanac
 Deceptively adorable, these mythical creatures from the fictional
 continent of Australia are smaller than their closely-related (though
 equally mythical) cousin, the kangaroo.  Seeing as how neither one
 exists, the dividing line between what constitutes a wallaby and what
 constitutes a kangaroo is somewhat arbitrary.  In general, a wallaby is
 smaller and stockier than a kangaroo, a kangaroo is generally larger
 and lankier than a wallaby, and a "wallaroo" is what you call a
 specimen if you can't bring yourself to otherwise pigeon-hole the
 creature.  In myth, wallabies, kangaroos, and wallaroos live in a
 variety of habitats, and one can never be entirely certain that any
 given area is safe from their kicking feet and sharpened claws.  They
 have even been known to exist in vinyards.

 The Atlanteans are notorious for the complexity of their machinery, and
 the controls for those machines are generally just as complex.  Whether
 through superstition or habit, however, their dislike of the number 14
 means that this setting is usually skipped for most controls, and if it
 is included, it is usually involved with some sort of fail-safe
 measure.

 Archive Lobby
 Dozens of pigeon holes line the walls, most of them filled with what
 could only be scrolls. The ceiling of the room is paneled with some
 kind of crystalline material; the panels glow softly, providing a
 gentle illumination.

 You can see the room filled with machinery through the crack to the
 northwest.

 One of the scrolls has been left lying here on the floor. It looks
 badly damaged.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>author
 Scene 8, "Mechanisms and More", was written by Admiral Jota.

>examine damaged scroll
 This scroll is in bad shape. Not only is the handle broken off and the
 material itself fraying at the edges, but there are two distinct sets
 of text inscribed on it: the original Atlantean text, which you can
 make neither head nor tail of, and then a separate message written over
 that in black marker -- and in your mother's handwriting!

>read scroll
 With black marker and in an uneven hand, someone -- apparently your
 mother, from the handwriting -- has scrawled this message: "Have we
 escaped from her voice? Maybe if we press on, go further in... If I did
 not have my husband and he I, then surely we would have both been
 driven mad by now. She calls herself Lucy, and she sends such confusing
 hullicinations. I fear that even my memories can no longer be trusted.
 She seems to want us to trust her, but I cannot understand why...
 Whoever you are, if you find this, you must resist her suggestions at
 all costs! I think. I honestly no longer know why... or even what is
 real anymore. It is as though everything is slipping away... No. I am
 certain we will find answers further on. Onward, always, onward,
 always, onward..." It trails off into a scrawl at that point.

>look up lucy in almanac
 The Atlantean legends are unclear on whether this figure is meant to
 represent some sort of demon or monster, or if it is merely a human
 being who achieved both great power and great viillainy. Her exact name
 varies according to the source text: sometimes it is written as
 "Lisellyi" or "Leslea"; other sources refer to her as "L'Z'L", perhaps
 as a reference to the holy tetragrammaton. Some modern academics have
 taken to transliterating the name as "Leslie" or even "Lucille",
 although this is generally recognized as a sign of less serious
 scholarship.

 Time has not been kind to this repository of information, and many of

 brightly-colored handles sticking out of their pigeon-holes, it would
 seem a fair number have survived.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the damaged scroll.

 This one is wedged tightly in its slot... That one is too fragile, and
 would probably crumble if you pulled too hard on it.. Ah, but here's
 one that you slide out easily. It seems to be decorated with colorful
 pictures.

 There may even be more loose ones, if you keep looking.

>search scrolls
 After a little more searching, you discover another scroll that can be
 safely removed: one with a distinctive silvery handle.

>read colorful scroll
 Most of the text on this scroll is in a dialect that's utterly
 indecipherable to you. However, it does feature several colorful
 diagrams, and you notice that the numerals they're labeled with look
 remarkably like modern ones. Most of the pictures seem to depict
 complicated mechanisms that you can't quite follow, although there does
 seem to be a definite progression of colors from light blue, through
 green and then yellow, finally leading up to a reddish-orange. The
 simplest diagram you can find is made of gemotric shapes: two
 equilateral triangles. The message next to the smaller one includes the
 numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The larger one has a similar caption, but with
 the numbers 5, 10, 15, and 20.

 This scroll contains some rather boring honorations to Atlantean
 doctors gone long before your grandparents were born. Your father has
 scribbled over this one in his distinctive, plain handwriting: "What
 can we do? Everything is so strange here, everything is locked, or
 dangerous...or worse. Those hallucinations, they are all to real? How
 shall I decide what's what? She, Lucy, stole my pet, hide it somewhere
 beneath the small chamber. How to free him?"

 -Is this a trick? You can't remember your parents having any pets.
 Must've been after you left, then.

 You check the rest of the pigeon holes, but don't find any more intact
 scrolls that can be easily removed.

 You can barely discern a faint, gentle humming under the floor.

 Spring Mechanism Room
 The machinery in here seems to be composed primarily of springs,
 interlocking gears, larger springs, large padded plates set up parallel

 even a few absurdly large springs. Conveniently, there seems to be some
 kind of control panel for it all right next to the entrance (which
 leads back south to the corridor).

 In the cage you see a penguin.

 The Troll's Cell
 This is some sort of makeshift cell. The walls are steel platings, with
 dents here and there as a fist or a head-ram may make. The stench of
 rotten flesh is almost unbearable and stems from a huge heap of
 half-eaten animals and bones in a corner. There is some writing on the
 wall, just above the grille.

 A weak red force field shimmers in the eastern doorway.

 An enormous troll sits in the corner of this room! Upon spotting you,
 she stands up and groans.

>diagnose penquin
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine troll
 A female Atlantean troll. She's tall and lean, but all there is to her
 seems to be muscle under a green skin covered with eczema and blains.
 Her head is small and round, with protruding veins and short, broken
 horns. She's covered in the remains of a silvery jumpsuit.

 The troll slowly moves towards you.

>ask troll about penguin
 There is no reply.

 She has almost reached you.

>read writing
 HAVE FUN! -Lucille

 As the troll bites off your head (mercifully quick and mumbling "I
 don't wanna do this Dave"), you think you can hear Lucy laugh
 somewhere, the sound somewhat muffled as your head sinks down the
 troll's throat.

 Your very first night is over in your new house.  It still seems
 surreal that you are now the proud owner of this place.  It doesn't
 quite feel like home yet since you haven't been able to get your
 furniture.  However, you can't get the rental truck until tomorrow.
 Maybe today would be a good idea to explore those woods behind your
 house.  It'll be a good way to kill time until you can get properly
 moved in tomorrow.

 Master Bedroom (on the mattress)
 All that's unpacked in the room is your mattress with a sheet thrown
 over the top of it.  Your dresser is still in storage.  Windows look
 out to the north and west, and the closet lies to the south.  The

 Deep Interior Room
 Even deeper still inside the Atlantean Base.   Complex machinery hums
 deep within, and complex controls line every wall of this large,
 cavernous room.  The walls are still silvery, though.  There does not
 appear to be any exit.

 A hairline fracture can be seen in the southeast wall, not even wide
 enough to put your fingernail inside.

 A-ha!  In an otherwise unremarkable corner is a dial with a 14 on it!

>turn dial to 14
 The machinery rumbles and roars as part by part of it screeches to a
 halt!  The room shudders and groans until you have to plug your ears
 from the noise.  Finally, the dust settles and everything is quiet.
 The dial seems to have come off in your hands, too.

 Archive Lobby
 Dozens of pigeon holes line the walls, most of them filled with what
 could only be scrolls. The ceiling of the room is paneled with some
 kind of crystalline material; the panels flicker erratically, lighting
 the room in fits and bursts. A corridor leads east.

 You can see the room filled with machinery through the crack to the
 northwest.

 One of the scrolls has been left lying here on the floor. It looks
 badly damaged.

>go east

 Long Corridor
 A long corridor leads east and west. To the west is the archive and
 lobby. To the east is a closed door made of some kind of greenish
 metal. Archways lead north and south.

 You realize that the rumbling you felt earlier hasn't stopped
 completely. Messing around with that machinery must have destabilized
 something deep within the complex, because you can still feel a
 vibration coming up through your feet.

>go east
 (first opening the metal door)
 At your touch, the door slides halfway open. Then it shudders, jerking
 back and forth for a few moments before slamming shut again. Whatever
 it is that powers the door seems to be malfunctioning.

 A long corridor leads east and west. To the west is the archive and

 metal. Archways lead north and south.

 The vibration in the floor suddenly gets much stronger. For a moment it
 feels as though everything is about to come down on your head, but then
 it subsides again to the same mild trembling it was before.

>go north

 Spring Mechanism Room
 The machinery in here seems to be composed primarily of springs,
 interlocking gears, larger springs, large padded plates set up parallel
 to the floor, even larger springs, some sort of piston-like things, and
 even a few absurdly large springs. Conveniently, there seems to be some
 kind of control panel for it all right next to the entrance (which
 leads back south to the corridor).

>go south

 Crystal Mechanism Room
 This room seems to exist soley to house an elaborate mechanism which is
 shaking dramatically. If you had to guess, you would say it looked like
 some kind of power generator -- although what kind of power it
 generates, you have no idea. A railing protects you from being injured
 by whatever it is. Or perhaps it prevents whatever it is from being
 damaged by you. An archway leads back north to the corridor.

 The shaking seems to be growing stronger.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The machinery starts shaking violently, as though the strain it's been
 under has become too great for it to handle. Just as it seems about to
 tear itself apart, all that energy is somehow shunted back into the
 ground, nearly knocking you off of your feet. After that, the
 shuddering seems to die back down to what it was before, and the
 crystals seem to have changed color.

>examine crystals
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine crystal
 Which do you mean, the large crystal, or the small crystal?

>examine large
 The large crystal is easily as tall as you are. Its surface is
 perfectly clear.

>examine small
 While much smaller than the large crystal, it's still rather larger
 than your head. Its surface is firey orange.

>turn dial to 4
 The machinery shifts and reconfigures itself in response. You
 immediately notice a significant dampening of the vibrations that
 you've been feeling ever since you entered this area. What was once a
 constant (if minor) trembling of the ground is now naught but a
 barely-perceptible hum.

 You discover nothing of interest in Every Child's Almanac of Lunar

 It tickles a bit, but you can slip through effortlessly.

 The penguin waddles straight towards the steel door and pecks at the

 The penguin waddles along.

>author
 Scene 10, "Puff of Smoke", was written by N. B. Horvath.

>examine novel
 This was one of your favorites as a child. It describes a nightmare
 world in which bodies are preserved after death. The hero fights to
 gain social acceptance for "cremation" and thus save the planet from
 being overrun by "cemeteries."

>examine door
 This door is square and made of steel. It has a viewscreen in the
 middle and a ridiciously small numberpad underneath it.

>examine portrait
 The portrait stares back at you with beady, tired eyes. XVIII isn't his

 Regal Hallway
 You are in a regally carpeted east-west hallway. At the east end, an
 urnstone door leads to the foyer, while a secret passageway leads
 south.

 The penguin waddles along.

>go east
 Before you can take a step toward the foyer, the penguin steps in front

 No way are you going in there. You are no match for a Koskos.

 The exterior of this machine is all orange and red stripes, apart from

 at those stripes, until finally you look away at a room that has

 Your father and a female assistant are standing outside of the
 contraption, clad in white coats, arguing heatedly over his insistence
 that she be a test subject. Ultimately she relents, giving him a
 desperate kiss and then walking into the device with head down and eyes
 squeezed shut.

 There is a single click, and then the entire structure shudders. You
 hear screams and thuds as the shaking continues for at least a minute.
 Then there is silence.

 The small receptacle is empty.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine button
 You see nothing special about the soft pushbutton.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   plain glass bottle (empty)
   a f-shaped key
   Every Child's Almanac of Lunar Conspiracy

>examine smoke
 The salmon-pink smoke is almost dissipated but manages to stay
 coherent.

>fill bottle with smoke
 It's just air.

>smell smoke
 The salmon-pink smoke is odorless, but it does seem to signify
 something.

>open bottle
 It takes a surprisingly strong effort to open the bottle. Finally it
 opens with a shhhhoop sound. In an instant, the salmon-pink smoke is
 drawn into the bottle with a whhhhhhhip; then it closes again with a
 ffffoomp.

 lab annex
 You are in a small annex to the large lab. This room is dominated by a
 mysterious chamber. The main lab is to the north and a closed wooden
 door is to the east.

 You can see a penguin and an empty cage here.

>open bottle
 The bottle is sealed shut, responding somehow to the presence of the
 salmon-pink smoke inside it.

>look up smoke in almanac
 You discover nothing of interest in Every Child's Almanac of Lunar
 Conspiracy.

>put bottle in chamber
 That can't contain things.

>examine chamber
 The mysterious chamber is like a miniature gazebo, a platform
 supporting four extensible metal posts with a little dome at the top.
 It's all made of metal, and it's all painted midnight black. A soft
 pushbutton and a small, bottle-shaped receptacle jut out from one edge
 of the platform.

>put bottle in receptacle
 You put the plain glass bottle (containing salmon-pink smoke) into the
 small receptacle.

>push button
 Muttering a short prayer to Fendit, you push the soft button.

 Something underneath the platform sucks the bottle down and out of
 sight. A low-pitched drone begins, then grows lower and louder. Soon
 your every bone is vibrating with the noise. Spots of light appear and
 disappear in the corner of your eye.

 The droning noise fades and is replaced by a rattling sound. The
 chamber shakes slightly.

>open chamber
 That's not something you can open.

 The rattling grows louder inside the chamber. The platform starts to
 glow.

 It's all made of metal, and it's all painted midnight black. A soft
 pushbutton and a small, bottle-shaped receptacle jut out from one edge
 of the platform.

 The rattle becomes an infernal thunder coming from underneath the
 shaking platform, as the glow spreads to the entire chamber.

 The thunder peaks, then dies down as the glow fades.
 A little pink-coated rat appears on top of the platform, then scurries
 away out of sight.

 The now-empty bottle pops back into the receptacle from within the
 chamber.

>go north

 science lab
 Your father's vast laboratory looks entirely different from when you
 last were in this house. A frightening contraption fills the west end
 of the room floor-to-ceiling. A teak desk sits along the east wall. The
 hallway lies to the north, the annex to the south, and the Taboo Room
 to the southeast.

 On the teak desk is a jagged-edge scroll.

 Taboo Room
 This is the room where your mother (also a scientist, who left under
 mysterious circumstances) worked on her most taboo project. This
 project not only violated the edicts of Grandfather XVIII, it stood in
 stark violation of the prohibition against time travel. Rumor had it
 that once the project was complete, anyone who prayed in the Taboo Room
 would trigger the creation of a spatio-temporal anchor, something that
 would alter the very fabric of reality. You were always a little
 curious about it.

 your father's bedroom
 Improbably, you are in your father's bedroom. It has been ransacked
 except for the portrait of Grandfather XVIII. A hallway lies to the
 east; the maintenance room, where you dispatched the troll, to the
 south.

 You can see a steel door and a science fiction novel here.

 You notice that a thin layer of sea-green smoke has gathered under the
 ceiling. It must have seeped in from the maintenance room.

>go south

 Maintenance room
 This is a small, almost featureless room. A plate sits next to the
 eastern doorway, and a huge metal door leads north.

 A weak red force field shimmers in the western doorway.

 You hear the roar of the troll, followed by the howl of the Koskos. The
 troll stomps off toward the hallway.  A moment later, you hear the
 terrible sound of Koskos-troll combat.

 Finally you hear a pitiful yowl, followed by a bang. Then silence
 returns to the house.

 It is now pitch dark in here!

 You are in the foyer of your childhood home. To your north is what

 died here and the other escaped.

>read quickpulp
 The quickpulp scroll contains a note to you from your father. It reads:

 Dear Dave,

 Having made it home first, I wish I had a happier Welcome Back to give
 to you. I'm afraid I did not treat your mother well, and you have seen
 how Lucille treated me far worse even than that. I have only now
 learned the extent of Lucy's cruelty. I pray that you can not only
 forgive but save me -- and save my beloved Rex, too. (I couldn't handle
 the "empty nest" after you left. So I added a new nest.) He is the only
 one who can unlock the doors. If you are reading this message, it means
 the worst has happened for me.

 Well, perhaps not entirely the worst. My experiments in wuolui have
 borne the most incredib
