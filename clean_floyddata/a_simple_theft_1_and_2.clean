    Many years ago, when the Iron Branch was passed down from king to
 king (instead of being a pile of rust in an overadorned urn), when
 dragons walked the earth (instead of flying about like the maniacs
 they are now), when Strongle was the God of Gods (instead of being,
 well, I think the polite term is 'deposed')...  back when all of that
 was taking place, magic had yet to be conquered by mere mortal man.

    What's that got to do with you, you ask?  Well, since you're an
 apprentice to one of those men who are trying to figure out how magic
 works, you get to do all the dirty deeds.  Apparently, Apaman, the
 loser you're apprenticed to, has gotten it into his head that the
 Hestron (one of the jewels in the Sceptre of Charlten, a symbol of the
 power of the Prince of Urf) is one of the keys to unlocking the
 secrets.

    He was kind enough to drag you to the Prince's castle, push you
 into the coal chute, and tell you not to bother coming out without the
 Hestron in your posession.

 Coal Cellar
    This cellar is dark -- mostly due to the coal dust which is
 everywhere.  A faint light comes through an open doorway to the north.

    You're startled briefly as the end of a rope pops out of the coal
 chute.  But you pause and check your inventory, making sure you still
 have the lockpick and the bag.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>inv
 I don't know the word "inv".

>inventory
 You have a lockpick and a bag.

>examine bag
 It's a small black bag.  Apaman made it very clear that you were to
 put the Hestron in this bag before bringing it out of the castle.

>open bag
 The bag is always open.

>oopen bag
 I don't know the word "oopen".

>examine pick
 It's your trusty lockpick.  Apaman said it would come in handy in the
 castle.

>take rope
 Apaman is at the other end of it and, right now, it's your only means
 of escape.  Those two facts taken together are enough for you to want
 to leave the rope right where it is.

>go north
 Dimly Lit Hallway
    This hallway runs east-west under the castle.  The only light comes
 from far to the east, where you can hear noises.  To the south is an
 open doorway through which the smell of coal seeps; to the west is
 nothing but inky darkness.
    You see a coal shovel here.

>take shovel
 Taken.

>search coal
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine shovel
 It's used for shovelling coal.

>shovel coal
 (with the coal shovel)
 I don't know how to dig in the coal shovel.

 Storage Room
    This room is piled high with various trinkets and whatnot that the
 kings of old (and of new) have gotten as gifts from visiting nobles.
 Of course they're worth fortunes, all.  But what good is a fortune to
 a king?
    A small door in the north wall catches your eye, however.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>take all
 I don't see what you're referring to.

>examine gifts
 Everything here is so incredibly valuable, you couldn't even guess as
 to its worth.

 Guard Room
    This room is rather small, considering it has to fit a table and
 chairs.  Eastward is a doorway, and a hallway stretches out to the
 west.
    A burly guard is here.
 The guard swings around towards you and draws his sword!

>examine guard
 A short, stout man.  He eyes you warily.  The guard brings his sword
 up, swings it down and slices you through!

 *** You have been sliced through. ***

 You start to step out into the main hallway.
    Unfortunately, the glint of your sword catches the eye of a passing
 guard.
    "Halt!"  he cries out.
    You drop the sword and start running away.  Unfortunately you're
 not faster than the arrow sent after you.

 Unforunately, the shovel gives your presence away.
    "Oy!  Coalboy!"  you hear someone shout.  You turn and look to see
 someone rushing towards you.  "Back in the cellar with ye," the guard
 says as he draws near.  Unceremoniously, he pushes you back down the
 stairs.

>go east
 You start to step out into the main hallway.  Corridor
    You try to blend into the shadows in what appears to be a major
 corridor in the castle.  If you're caught here, you'll surely be
 killed.  The doorway to the stairwell you came up through is off to
 the west.  From what your master Apaman told you, you need to go
 southeast from here to find the Magister of Keys' chambers.

>sneak
 I don't know the word "sneak".

>fire moss arrow
 I don't know the word "fire".

>hide
 I don't know the word "hide".

>se
 You make your way down the corridor, keeping to the shadows as much as
 possible until you find yourself arriving...

 Outside the Magister's Quarters
    The door to the south has got the Magister of Keys' emblem, a
 keyring, on.  It must be his door.  The corridor continues on to the
 southeast.

>examine emblem
 It's the blue and gold keyring, the symbol of the Magister of Keys.

>examine door
 It's closed and locked.

>examine lock
 It's closed and locked.

 Opened.

 It's open.

>l s
 I don't understand that sentence.

>go south
 Magister of Keys' Quarters
    Keys, keys everywhere and not a drop to drink.  Erm.  Anyway, the
 walls all seem completely covered with keys of all shapes and sizes.
 How are you to decide which is the one to the treasure vault?

>count keys
 I don't know the word "count".

>examine keys
 Hundreds and hundreds of keys line the entire room, keys of all shapes
 and sizes.  You gotcher big keys and your small keys, your red keys
 and your blue keys.  The only thing that seems even remotely distinct
 is the jeweled box.

>examine box
 This ornately jeweled box has a crystal pane with a beautiful
 decoration covering up the contents.

>examine decoration

 You fiddle with the lock on the box for a bit, but it doesn't yield to
 your ministrations.

>pick lock
 (with the lockpick)
 You can't pick that.

>take box
 Taken.

>search keys
 You spend a long time looking around at the various keys, but none of
 them looks like the right one.

>break box
 You'll have to tell me how to do that.

>examine decoration
 This ornately jeweled box has a crystal pane with a beautiful
 decoration covering up the contents.

>put box in bag
 Done.

>out
 Outside the Magister's Quarters
    The door to the south has got the Magister of Keys' emblem, a

 southeast.

 You'd best stick to your current plan, lest Apaman find out and
 perform nasty experiments on you.

 It's the blue and gold keyring, the symbol of the Magister of Keys.

>get keyring
 You can't have the Magister of Keys' emblem.

>get emblem
 You can't have the Magister of Keys' emblem.

 Corridor
    You try to blend into the shadows in what appears to be a major

 are down the corridor to the southeast.

 You lift up one end of the sword and smash it into the crystal pane.
 iCrash!  Shards fly everywhere, but the box's contents are now
 accessible.

>examine box
 This once ornate box has been unceremoniously smashed in by an
 assailant.  How unseemly.  In the box you can see a dull brass key.

>take key
 Taken.

>examine key
 It's completely nondescript.  Dull and scratched, it has seen many
 years of use.

    A small door in the north wall catches your eye, however.

>unlock door with key
 Unlocked.

>open door
 Opened.

>l n
 I don't understand that sentence.

>examine door
 You wonder what sort of things need to be locked away, given the
 extreme value which lies all around you.

>go north
 Private Vault
    You're in!  This is the prince's private vault.  Very few items are
 valuable enough to be horded away like this, the Hestron being one of
 them.  Along the northern wall is a shelf on which all the fancy items
 are stored.  To the south lies a doorway, and freedom.

>examine shelf
 On the shelf you see the Sceptre of Charlten, the Crown of Strongle,
 and the Cube of Dyosthenius.

>examine cube
 Not quite as old as the Crown of Strongle, this jewelled cube was
 commissioned by Teorlor Gayrge, eighth Prince of Urf, to commemorate
 the 20th anniversary of his wife's untimely passing.

>examine crown
 This was said to be given by Strongle himself to the first King of the
 Northlands.  One of the princes of Urf raided that King's castle and
 stole it, presumeably because of its history.  Certainly not for its
 beauty.  And now here it lies, on a dusty shelf in a hidden vault.

>examine sceptre
 Wow.  It's really the sceptre!  Diamonds and rubies adorn its side
 and, sitting proudly on top, is the actual Hestron.

>take sceptre
 You've already got your hands full.

>inventory
 You have a lockpick, a bag, a sword, a coal shovel, and a dull brass
 key.  The bag seems to contain a jeweled box.

>drop shovel
 Dropped.

>put lockpick in bag
 Done.

>take sceptre
 Taken.

>take crown
 You've already got your hands full.

>wear crown
 You can't wear the Crown of Strongle.

>wear crown

>examine crown
 This was said to be given by Strongle himself to the first King of the
 Northlands.  One of the princes of Urf raided that King's castle and
 stole it, presumeably because of its history.  Certainly not for its
 beauty.  And now here it is, in your greedy little hands.

>take hestron
 You pop the Hestron loose from the sceptre.

>examine hestron
 The Hestron is a huge diamond, about the size of your fist, and has
 swirls of red and aquamarine running through.  It's said that the day
 when Rinnor, the god-king, stole the sun and hid it in his mountain
 lair, the Hestron was formed from the sun's light trying to escape
 from underground.

>put hestron in bag
 Done.

>take crown
 You already have the Crown of Strongle!

>take cube
 You've already got your hands full.

>inventory
 You have a bag, the Sceptre of Charlten, and the Crown of Strongle.
 The bag seems to contain a jeweled box, a lockpick, and the Hestron.

>put crown in bag
 You can't fit that in the bag.

>examine bag
 It's a small black bag.  Apaman made it very clear that you were to
 put the Hestron in this bag before bringing it out of the castle.

>go south
 As you pass through the door alarm bells go off!  There must have been
 some magic guarding the Sceptre of Charlten!  Dozens of guards
 converge on you and hack you to pieces.

    Of course, the Magister of Keys' fate is no worse than yours,
 having allowed a common thief access to the Princes' private vault.
 But that fact is of little consolation to you now.

 *** You have been hacked to pieces. ***

>go up
 You climb up the rope.  Apaman is there ready to greet you.
    "Have you got it?"  he asks excitedly.
    Wordlessly, you place the small bag into his eager, outstretched
 hand.  Apaman reaches into the bag and pulls out a jeweled box.
 "What's this?"  Apaman asks.  "Why is this in the bag?"  He throws the
 jeweled box at you and reaches in again, pulling out a lockpick.
 Apaman grows angry.  "This is NOT a Game, stupid cob!"  He slaps you
 across the face.  Reaching in a third time, he pulls out the Hestron,
 at last.  Apaman growels at you, "That's the end of your trickster
 days, fool.  You are no longer my apprentice."  He turns and leaves
 you where you stand.

    Wordlessly, you place the small bag into his eager, outstretched

 Blinking once, twice in the moonlight, hardly daring to believe, he
 stares at it.  Finally, reality sets in and his gaze returns to you.
    "Let's go now," he says, gruffly.  He leads you back to the place
 you sarcastically call home.  You're not sure if the Hestron really is
 the key to unlocking magic like Apaman says, but you do feel a subtle
 difference in the way he's treating you.
    Could it be that he's beginning to show you the slightest hint of a
 modicum of respect?

 from far to the east, where you can hear noises.  To the south is an
 open doorway through which the smell of coal seeps; to the west is
 nothing but inky darkness.

>go south
 Coal Cellar
    This cellar is dark -- mostly due to the coal dust which is
 everywhere.  A faint light comes through an open doorway to the north.
 Dangling from the coal chute in the corner is a dirty rope.
    You see a sword and a jeweled box here.

>go up
 You climb up the rope.  Apaman is there ready to greet you.
    "Have you got it?"  he asks excitedly.
    Wordlessly, you place the Hestron into his eager, outstretched
 hand.  He blinks once, twice in the moonlight, hardly daring to
 believe.
    Finally, the reality of it set in and his gaze returns to you and
 your now grimy features.
    "Stupid Cob!"  he chasties you.  "I told you to keep the Hestron in
 the bag! You could have been caught.  Lucky for you that you weren't.
    "Let's go now," he says, gruffly.  He leads you back to the place
 you sarcastically call home.  You're not sure if the Hestron really is
 the key to unlocking magic like Apaman says, but you do feel a subtle
 difference in the way he's treating you.
    Could it be that he's beginning to show you the slightest hint of a
 modicum of respect?

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Many years ago, when the Iron Branch was passed down from king to king
 (instead of being a pile of rust in an overadorned urn), when dragons
 walked the earth (instead of flying about like the maniacs they are
 now), when Strongle was the God of Gods (instead of being, well, I
 think the polite term is "deposed")... back when all of that was
 taking place, magic had yet to be conquered by mere mortal man.

 What's that got to do with you, you ask?  Well, since you're an
 apprentice to one of those men who are trying to figure out how magic
 works, you get to do all the dirty deeds.

 A few weeks ago, Apaman (the loser you're apprenticed to) had sent you
 to recover the Hestron (one of the jewels in the Sceptre of Charlten).
 Despite your success on that mission, Apaman is not treating you any
 better.  Your best guess is that many of the Hestron's secrets remain
 hidden to him, and he's taking his frustrations out on the nearest
 convenient target.

 Now he's learnt about something that may help him unlock those
 secrets, and has sent you on another mission: to retrieve the sky rock
 from the north tower of Fossen Festning, a fortress built into the
 side of a mountain beside a large waterfall.  All you've brought with
 you is a dark cloak and an old grappling hook that Apaman was generous
 enough to loan to you.  All you need to bring out is the sky rock.

 Good luck with that.

 Beneath the North Tower
 A dark tower rises high above you, lit dimly in the cloud-obscured
 moonlight. The sound of a waterfall is nearby but somewhat muted by
 the high walls of the fortress. To your south is the main courtyard,
 and directly west of you is the face of the cliff into which the
 fortress was built.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a dark cloak (being worn)
   a grappling hook

>be the night
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine cliff
 Rising higher than the tower itself, the mountainside has been carved
 away here to make room for the fortress.  The marks from the builders'
 tools have not yet worn away, despite the age of this place.

>examine tower
 The tower is made of a bright, almost perfectly white, stone. The
 scant moonlight that filters through the thin clouds overhead allows
 you to just make out its shape.  Far above you is the lowest window in
 the tower, just wide enough for an archer to use.  There don't appear
 to be any entrances on this side, and it appears too dangerous, too
 well-lit, to walk around it to the north.

>listen waterfall
 I only understood you as far as wanting to listen.

>appreciate waterfall
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>drink water
 You can't see any such thing.

>use grappling hook on window
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine hook
 You're lucky that Apaman has let you have at least this much
 equipment, even if he wouldn't let you bring a sword or even a knife.
 It is attached to a modest length of rope.

>throw hook at window
 You expertly spin the hook on its rope, gathering momentum, and
 release! The hook noisily clatters against the side of the tower, well
 below the window, and falls with a thud to the ground.  The rope isn't
 long enough.  You gather it all back up and nervously look around for
 approaching guards.

>wait
 Time passes.

>shimmy up tower
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go south

 Central Courtyard
 Completely covered in cobblestones, the central courtyard is an
 enormous place, used for assembling the troops and greeting royalty.
 A large entryway is topped by an enormous stone arch.  It leads to the
 east where, hidden somewhere beyond the outer portcullis, Apaman
 awaits your return.  To the south and to the north rise the two
 watchtowers, and it is in the northern one that Apaman believes the
 star rock to be.  West is the entrance to the Festning itself, dug out
 of the rock of this mountain. Although you're hiding as best as you
 can in the shadows, it's dangerous to remain here long.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>again
 Time passes.

 You hear a shout come from somewhere high above you, but you couldn't
 make out any words.

>dance
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>sing
 As good as your voice is, at the moment you prefer not to draw too
 much attention to yourself.

 You hear someone running, but you can't tell which direction it's
 coming from, and you can't tell the direction it's moving.

>wait
 Time passes.

 A single guard emerges from the Festing entrance!  "Halt!" he shouts,
 running directly at you.

>cry
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine cloak
 You put this on before you came to the Festning, hoping mightily that
 it would help you blend into the shadows.

 The guard reaches you, and clonks you over the head.  You black out.
 By the time you black back in again, it's all over.



     *** You have been captured ***


 In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 25, in 13 turns.


 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?

>hit guard with shovel

 You make your best attempt to overcome the guard, but he is not
 impressed. Instead, he overcomes you.

 Beneath the North Tower
 A dark tower rises high above you, lit dimly in the cloud-obscured
 moonlight. The sound of a waterfall is nearby but somewhat muted by
 the high walls of the fortress. To your south is the main courtyard,
 and directly west of you is the face of the cliff into which the

>go south

 Central Courtyard
 Completely covered in cobblestones, the central courtyard is an
 enormous place, used for assembling the troops and greeting royalty.
 A large entryway is topped by an enormous stone arch.  It leads to the
 east where, hidden somewhere beyond the outer portcullis, Apaman
 awaits your return.  To the south and to the north rise the two
 watchtowers, and it is in the northern one that Apaman believes the
 star rock to be.  West is the entrance to the Festning itself, dug out
 of the rock of this mountain. Although you're hiding as best as you
 can in the shadows, it's dangerous to remain here long.

>go south
 Apaman was very clear: the star rock is in the top of the north tower,
 and nowhere near, in, over, under, behind, or around the south tower.
 He made you go over the points of the compass too many times for you
 to get it wrong now. "What's this?" he'd ask.  "East," you'd say. "And
 if I turn this way?" he'd ask. "South by southwest," you'd respond.
 And then you'd get smacked in the ear-hole for getting it wrong.

>go east
 Depart before you've acquired the star rock?  Apaman would... well,
 you're not sure what he would do, but it wouldn't be at all nice.

>go west
 Entering the fortress itself?  Now that would be foolish.

 You hear a shout come from somewhere high above you, but you couldn't
 make out any words.

>Always On My Mind.
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go north

 Beneath the North Tower
 A dark tower rises high above you, lit dimly in the cloud-obscured
 moonlight. The sound of a waterfall is nearby but somewhat muted by
 the high walls of the fortress. To your south is the main courtyard,
 and directly west of you is the face of the cliff into which the
 fortress was built.

>go north
 You start to make your way around and see the entrance to the tower,
 but you notice that someone else is in the shadows.  A guard, lying in
 wait, perhaps? You dare not chance it, and so you return.

>go down
 You can't go that way.

 You momentarily freeze as you hear a guard approaching. You spot a
 good shadow, trying to blend in, and the guard moves on to a different
 part of the Festning.

>examine rope
 A modest length of rope, tied firmly to a grappling hook.

>examine waterfall
 Although you can't see it, you can definitely hear the roar of the
 waterfall.  Its one advantage to you is that it's noisy enough to
 cover most mistakes a novice thief such as yourself would make.

>go north
 You start to make your way around and see the entrance to the tower,
 but you notice that someone else is in the shadows.  A guard, lying in
 wait, perhaps? You dare not chance it, and so you return.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>climb cliff
 You look up at the steep cliff face and try not to imagine what would
 happen if you fell down. You attempt to get a finger-hold on the
 cliff's face, but you don't get much more than a foot or two up the
 side before failing.  You jump back down, and the grappling hook
 thumps painfully against your bottom.

>throw hook at cliff
 You expertly spin the hook on its rope, gathering momentum, and
 release! The hook sails through the air and clanks against the side of
 the cliff.  It starts sliding down, but it catches on a small
 protrusion of rock!  The rope comes to a rest on the side of the
 cliff.

>climb rope
 Grabbing the end of the rope, you offer up a silent and very quick
 prayer. You pull the rope taut and make your way up the cliff's face.
 Upon reaching the top of the rope, you wriggle the grappling hook free
 of the cliff and look around.

 Cliff Face
 Too far down below is the ground.  The wind whips mercilessly up here,
 and the sound of the waterfall is slightly louder, though still
 somewhat muted. Although you can no longer see the archer slot, you're
 much closer to the top than you were before.  The peak of the tower is
 visible now, and you can see a ring of iron-barred windows around the
 top.

 You'd rather not jump down from this height.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>throw hook at windows
 You expertly spin the hook on its rope, gathering momentum, and
 release! The hook sails towards the windows, but stops far short of
 them.  The hook seems to pause in mid-air at the end of the rope
 before, to your horror, it falls slowly down and clanks loudly against
 the base of the cliff below you. Scraping and clunking, you drag the
 hook up along the cliff face until it's back in your hands.

>examine peak
 It looks like a conical hat on top of the tower.

>examine windows
 They encircle the top, just where the conical roof meets the walls of
 the tower. They were too far up to see from the ground level and,
 using your expert eye, you judge that they're too far for your
 grappling hook to reach even from here..

>hide
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine cliff
 Up here, the cliff is more natural, with protrusions and lumps.  It
 doesn't appear to be as carefully sculpted as it is down below.

>climb cliff
 Enough protrusions and bumps are on the cliff's face now that you can
 get a decent purchase on them. You climb higher beside the tower,
 although the cliff is curving away from it now as you approach the
 top.

 Near The Top
 You're almost level with the top of the tower now, although the cliff
 side has curved rather far away from it.  Although the side of the
 mountain isn't nearly level at this point, it has levelled off enough
 that trees are starting to find places to grow in the cracks and
 crevices.  Right beside you here is a particularly tall oak.

>examine tree
 Firmly rooted here is a large oak tree, hanging out over the cliff.

>climb oak
 You shimmy up the tree.

 Treetop
 Out here on a branch near the tower, the wind is brutal. One slip, and
 you'll fall to certain death. Far, far below is where you started, but
 you try not to think about that.

>examine tower
 The top of the tower has a conical roof, immediately below which the
 tower is ringed with iron-barred windows. You can't really reach the
 tower from here, but you should be close enough for that grappling
 hook.  You hope.

>think about death
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>throw hook at windows
 You expertly spin the hook on its rope, gathering momentum, and
 release. The hook clanks against the windows and catches!  You grab
 onto the rope with your hands, and grab onto the branch with your
 feet, and slowly pull yourself towards the tower.  Once you're within
 reach of the iron bars, you feel around them for a latch, releasing
 it.  One set of bars swings inwards, and you pull yourself through,
 letting go of the branch.

 Before closing the bars again, you retrieve your grappling hook.

 Top Floor
 This is a dim room and, from the smell of it, very dusty as well.  The
 only light comes in through the windows, casting a dull grey sheen
 across everything you see.  The room is sparsely appointed, with a cot
 along one wall and a small cupboard near it.  A wall divides the
 tower, turning this room into a semicircle, putting you in the half
 that faces to the west. There is a ring set into the floor, near to
 the western wall.

>examine cupboard
 (the small cupboard)
 A small wooden cupboard sits beside the cot.

>open cupboard
 (the small cupboard)
 You open the small cupboard.

>examine cupboard
 (the small cupboard)
 A small wooden cupboard sits beside the cot.

>search cupboard
 (the small cupboard)
 The small cupboard is empty.

 You hear a noise!  It's coming from somewhere below you.

>examine ring
 The ring appears to be attached to a trap door.

 You slip into a shadow, remaining as still as can be.

>sing
 You daren't do anything at the moment.

 You see the trap door slowly open upwards. A person's head pokes up
 through the opening.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The figure pulls itself up into the room and looks around cautiously.

>examine figure
 With the black clothing this person is wearing, it's hard to discern
 anything, really.  Other than, y'know, being all human-shaped and
 stuff.

 You freeze in place as you watch the figure glide quietly through the
 room feeling along the wall.  Suddenly, it stops, taps gently on one
 of the stones in the wall, and wiggles it free.  It's the star rock!
 Oh no.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The black-clad figure runs lightly to the trap door and drops through,
 closing it quietly behind.

>undo

 [Previous turn undone.]

>SAVE
>cf1

>hit figure
 The figure jumps with fright.  It turns to look at you, and you just
 make out a wild-eyed expression before the figure swirls to the trap
 door and disappears below.

 You let out a breath, only just now noticing you had been holding it
 in.

>look

 along one wall and a small cupboard near it.  A wall divides the

>tap wall
 That figure took a rock out of the wall, and you'd bet your last
 generic monetary unit that that was the rock you were looking for.

>search cot
 There is nothing on the cot.

>look under cot
 You find nothing of interest.

>go down
 You slip through the trap door. That thieving thief!  Without that
 rock, you're really in for it with Apaman.  You're not sure you'll
 live long enough to experience the full extent of his wrath. He warned
 you about guards, but not about another thief.

 In any case, it's not an easy task, getting to the bottom of the
 tower. You manage to avoid the guards somehow using your cleverness,
 the cloak, and some convenient nooks and crannies.

 Guard Room
 You're on the ground floor of the north tower now, and this is clearly
 meant to be where men and women prepare for guard duty.  Bunk beds
 line the northern wall, and assorted weaponry hangs on the south wall.
 The staircase you came down is on the far wall, and you see the exit
 to the tower to the east.

>examine weaponry
 For use by the guards only - these would only slow you down anyway.

>take axe
 You can't see any such thing.

>take glaive
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine weapons

>we're robbing old mother hubbard apparently.

 It was difficult enough trying to get down past all those guards, and
 you want to do it again?  Talk about living dangerously...

>go east
 You start to exit the tower, when suddenly you feel yourself grabbed
 from behind! You are spun around and slammed against the wall. "So,
 following me, are you?" the black-clad figure whispers. "I'll teach
 you to follow me." You feel the heat from this person's body, the hot
 breath in your face, and the smell... a fragrance of some kind?

>flirt with thief
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kiss thief
 Moving your head forward, you surprise your opponent by stealing a
 kiss!  Twisting free, you swing with your foot to knock the person
 off-balance and, with an elbow to the neck, you've incapacitated your
 opponent, who rolls across the floor and comes to a stop by one of the
 walls.

>search thief
 You see something in one of the person's pockets, and extract it.
 It's the star rock!

 You take it.

 Your nemesis lies crumpled near a wall.  The blackness of the clothing
 that this person is wearing makes it hard to see in the dim light.

>examine rock
 It's about two inches in diameter and looks like an ordinary rock, but
 feels much rougher than an ordinary rock does.

>kiss thief
 Keep your mind on the game.

 That could prove to be fatal.  To you, that is, not to this person
 here.

>tie her up
 I didn't understand that sentence.

 You're fairly certain you can sneak out of here before that thief
 wakes up.

 Northern Courtyard
 Although this is a much smaller courtyard than the main one by the
 entrance, it is still large enough to assemble quite a few troops.
 Normally, this place would be bustling with activity, but this late at
 night most everyone is asleep. You can head back into the tower to the
 west, or go around the tower to the south.

>go south

 Beneath the North Tower
 A dark tower rises high above you, lit dimly in the cloud-obscured
 moonlight. The sound of a waterfall is nearby but somewhat muted by
 the high walls of the fortress. To your south is the main courtyard,
 and directly west of you is the face of the cliff into which the
 fortress was built.

>go south

 Central Courtyard
 Completely covered in cobblestones, the central courtyard is an
 enormous place, used for assembling the troops and greeting royalty.
 A large entryway is topped by an enormous stone arch.  It leads to the
 east where, hidden somewhere beyond the outer portcullis, Apaman
 awaits your return.  To the south and to the north rise the two
 watchtowers, and it is in the northern one that Apaman believes the
 star rock to be.  West is the entrance to the Festning itself, dug out
 of the rock of this mountain. Although you're hiding as best as you
 can in the shadows, it's dangerous to remain here long.

>go east
 You sneak out under the portcullis, drawing absolutely no attention to
 yourself.  Apaman is there, ready to greet you.

 "Have you got it?" he asks excitedly.

 Wordlessly, you place the star rock into his eager, outstretched hand.
 Blinking once, twice in the moonlight, hardly daring to believe, he
 stares at it.  Finally, reality sets in and his gaze returns to you.

 "Let's go now," he says, gruffly.  He leads you back to the place you
 sarcastically call home.  You're not sure if the star rock really is
 the key to unlocking the Hestron like Apaman says, but you do feel a
 subtle difference in the way he's treating you.

 Could it be that he's beginning to show you a modicum of respect?

>credits
 In addition to all the hard work done by Graham Nelson, Emily Short,
 and countless others for Inform 7, I also wish to thank to Jon Ingold
 for his Far Away extension.

 A big betatesting thank you goes to Marius M?ller, Dan Shiovitz,
 Admiral Jota, and a grammarian who wishes to remain anonymous. Without
 their input and helpful suggestions, this game would have been an
 unpolished mess.

 I would also like to thank my wife, Julie, for being awesome.

>Let's go to the courtyard?
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go down
 You slip through the trap door. Precious star rock in hand, you race
 your way down to the bottom of the tower.  This is easier than you had
 anticipated as there are far fewer guards than Apaman had led you to
 believe.

 In any case, it's not an easy task, getting to the bottom of the
 tower. You manage to avoid the guards somehow using your cleverness,
 the cloak, and some convenient nooks and crannies.

 Guard Room
 You're on the ground floor of the north tower now, and this is clearly
 meant to be where men and women prepare for guard duty.  Bunk beds
 line the northern wall, and assorted weaponry hangs on the south wall.
 The staircase you came down is on the far wall, and you see the exit
 to the tower to the east.

 You can see an unconscious black-clad figure here.

>go east
 You're fairly certain you can sneak out of here before that thief
 wakes up.

 Northern Courtyard
 Although this is a much smaller courtyard than the main one by the
 entrance, it is still large enough to assemble quite a few troops.
 Normally, this place would be bustling with activity, but this late at
 night most everyone is asleep. You can head back into the tower to the
 west, or go around the tower to the south.
