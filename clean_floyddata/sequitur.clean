 Detective Cochone is being tortured by a dancing bear. The small toy
 bobs on the desk, its cymbals crashing out an eardrum-tearing beat
 that shouldn't be possible for such tiny plates of gold-colored tin.
 Cochone's head pounds in sympathy. Even the walls of Jenny's office
 seem to shake. With a sour expression, Cochone turns away from the
 cacophony.

 "Okay, so you don't like Happy Jack," Jenny says as the bear stops
 clapping. Seated in her wheelchair in front of the only other desk in
 the office, Jenny frowns in mock disappointment. "Somebody has a bad
 case of the mubble fubbles."

 "The morning has been a bit rough," Cochone says. "I think I'm coming
 down with something."

 "Well, I hope you are well enough to listen to some music. I need a
 soundtrack to my day. Do you want to choose a song?"

 Cochone rubs his eyes and sighs.

 Jenny jumps in before he can proceed. "This is going to happen, Chief,
 whether you want to participate or not. So, are you going to pick a
 song?"

 "Oh, come on," Jenny says. "It's not like I am going to ask you to
 choose Eminem or Pitbull or anything like that."

 Jenny must see something in Cochone's eyes. Or maybe it's his blanched
 face. "We need to get on with this," she says. "I'll handle it."

 "Just do me  a favor and keep the volume down."

 Jenny turns the laptop back to face her. "Let's see. I'm sure you like
 <span class="floydstyle em">The Animals,</span> so we'll add lots of them. We also need
 something modern." She considers. "We'll take solid gold synth from
 <span class="floydstyle em">The Golden Filter</span>. And a little French culture wouldn't hurt.
 Jacques Dutronc. And to help lighten the mood , we'll add 'Hot Dog.'
 She taps some keys on the laptop, and "Venus and Serena" begins to
 play. She nods at the computer behind Cochone. "Let's get to work.
 Open the <span class="floydstyle em">Sequitur</span> program."

 Cochone clicks on the icon, and The <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur</span> program opens,

 *** <span class="floydstyle em">Sequitur</span> is working ... <span class="floydstyle em">Sequitur</span> is designed for
 you to put tracks in the Sequence in temporal order. This particular
 case has 15 tracks, so two sequences should be established: one with
 ten tracks and the other with five. Something will tell you when the
 sequence of events for either of these is set sensibly and, when you
 do realize it, we should know what to do next. Usually solving the
 long chain is sufficient to continue. Only by sequencing both chains,
 however,  will we be able to see the whole story.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Sequitur Commands and Brief Guide</span>

 CLEAR SEQUENCE [or PLAYLIST]: removes all the tracks
 second noun isn't specified, the track will be removed from the
 Sequence
 specified slot up to and including the track in the second specified
 slot
 EXAMINE or X [a track or slot]: plays the track or the track which is
 in the slot
 EXXAMINE or X TRACKS or SEQUENCE or PLAYLIST: lists all the tracks,
 the tracks in the Sequence, or the tracks in the playlist,
 respectively
 slot or, if the slot contains a track,  first shift the tracks right
 if there is an empty slot available. If no slots are available to the
 right but there is an empty slot to the left, the tracks shift
 backward. If the Sequence is already full, the track in the last slot
 is lost; u can also put a track number first or second or third, etc.
 PLAY TRACKS or PLAYLIST or SEQUENCE: plays all the tracks in whatever
 you specified; "tracks" will play all the unslotted tracks
 PLAY or P [a track]: accepts track names or numbers
 unslotted tracks plays tracks that are not in the Sequence in their
 number order
 PLAY TRACKS or SEQUENCE or PLAYLIST RANDOMLY: if "tracks" is
 specified, all the tracks not in the Sequence will play  randomly
 RENAME [a track]
 track or track in the specified slot forward or backward the specified
 number along the Sequence if there are empty sklots to fill; if an
 empty slot is specified, the specified number of slots forward or back
 will be emptied; it will seperate tracks  if the specified track is
 next to another track

 SHUFFLE PLAYLIST or SEQUENCE: rearranges the tracks but doesn't play
 them
 SUMMARIZE [a track]: allows you to write a brief description of the
 track; if you play a track with a summary and summaries is switched
 on, your description will be printed, instead of playing the track
 SWITCH SUMMARIES or SWITCH ON or OFF SUMMARIES: When summaries are
 switched on, your descriptions of the tracks will be printed. When
 they're off, the tracks play normally
 the tracks in the Sequence; the track is placed in the new position,
 either filling it or replacing the previous track it held

 You can also record notes by typing WRITE," read them with READ
 NOTES," and clear the notebook with CLEAR NOTEBOOK."

 Other commands: CREDITS, HELP, QUIT, REOPEN, RESTART, and SAVE.

 ASK JENNY FOR HINTS if you want her advice, or ASK JENNY FOR an
 OPINION if you want her to show you how she would fit all the tracks
 into the Sequence. You can also just TALK TO JENNY anytime.

 "Cute, Jenny," Cochone says. "Including yourself in there like that."

 Jenny giggles. "That's why I'm here. I'm usually good for a little
 chat."

 "Right." Cochone nods then coughs.

 Some men laugh from down the hall.

 "So, can you tell me a little bit about the case you're working on?"
 Jenny says.  "It's that house in the bayou?"

 "Right." Cochone sighs. "At about 7:00 Thursday night a guy, Mr.
 Mayer, was walking his weiner dog on the outskirts of the Belle
 Bayou."

 "Was his name Oscar? The dog. It was a daschund, right?"

 "Right. He finds a young woman. Twentysomething. She is barely
 conscious. She points into the trees. Passes out. Mayer sees some
 smoke. He calls emergency. They search the area. Turns out there's a
 house there with a fire in the basement and two burned bodies. Two
 more people are found dead. Shot. All young, your age. There is also a
 lot of recording equipment, and some cell phones. We spend all day in
 and around the house gathering it all up for your little pet project.
 And today I'm hoping it will talk because right now the woman is in a
 coma, and we don't even know who any of them are."

 Jenny's smile finally fades. "Well, I'm sure we'll figure it out."

 "It doesn't look good for the woman. Five-to-one says she won't make
 it."

 Jenny's eyes widen. "I, I don't like taking chances." She frowns.
 "Especially when it involves someone's life."

 Cochone shrugs. "She lives or dies either way."

 Arms crossed, Jenny glances at the computer. "Maybe you should get
 back to work. Ask me for help when you need it." She emphasizes the
 "when."

 Cochone turns back to the desk.

 Stephen Cochone scrambled out of bed this morning, rushing to the
 toilet to vomit. That was actually a good thing; he slept through the
 alarm, but he still had time for a quick shower and a splash of
 cologne. He was going to work with a young woman today, after all.

 If it wasn't for Jenny, he would have probably called in sick. His
 queasy stomach has settled, but his head pounds, and he has difficulty
 focusing his itchy eyes. This type of wake-up call was supposed to
 have ended when he had graduated from college and swore off the booze.
 That was the year his father, a vice cop, drove head-on into a truck,
 killing himself and his wife, Stephen's mother. They had just stumbled
 away from their wedding anniversary celebration at the bar where,
 twenty years previous, Stephen's father had stuffed dollar bills in
 his future wife's g-string. Perhaps alcohol abstinence has prevented
 some of the physical decline associated with age and detective work in
 a large city; Stephen looks generally the same as he did during his
 college years, with a few creases around the eyes and gray hairs that
 appeared during and after the divorce, when his ex decided to take his
 daughters to New York with her.

 Cochone's legs begin to ache, and he shifts in his seat to releive the
 pressure.

 Lieutenant Jayne appears in the doorway. He glances down at the stain
 on Cochone's crotch. "Everything okay in here?"

 Jenny's lips curl up. She whispers, "He's had a little accident."

 "What?" Cochone says, turning away from the computer screen.

 "He's doing great so far," Jenny continues, grinning.

 "Thanks, teach," Cochone says.

 "Come on, Steve, we all know how you are with electronics. Your watch
 runs backward. Which is why you're here on this beautiful Saturday
 morning. The bayou case is perfet to test out the new software. If you
 can learn it ..."

 "Anybody can," Cochone says. "Right. And Lady Gaga here is gonna help
 me?"

 "Miss Lincks helped develop the program," Nigel says. "She can teach
 computer tech to chimps."

 "Chimps are pretty smart," Cochone says.

 "Yeah, but I don't think we'll need a million of you with a million
 computers to write Shakespeare," Jenny says. "Or figure this out."

 "Shakespeare?" Cochone says.

 "Geeze," Jenny says. "Is it too late to get a monkey in here?"

 "I have faith in you, Jenny," Nigel says. "I'm going to get some
 lunch. You two want anything?"

 Jenny shakes her head. "No thank you."

 "Woof!. Woof-woof!"

 "Excuse me," Jenny says then takes her cell from her desk.

 "Yeah," Cochone says to Nigel. "I'll take two."

 "Okay. I'll be back soon." Nigel leaves.

 Cochone sighs, settles back, then looks at the computer monitor.

 "I didn't sign up for breaking and entering," a man with a face so
 full of metal piercings that he could have kissed a live grenade
 says. He rams a tripod leg between wood boards and the side of the
 house at his feet. He pulls the tool, and two boards separate from the
 clapboard with a loud crack.

 A murder of blackbirds caw and fly off.

 "I told you, nobody owns this place," a man with a "Meat is Murder"
 t-shirt  says, sliding a knife into his pants. "Neo was right. These
 planks have rotted."

 Shrapnel and Veggie free the remaining boards.

 The video stutters, blacks out.

 The footage starts again. An enclosed counter fronted by clear glass
 sits in the feeble light cast by the window beside it. A pipe snakes
 from the top of the fumehood and attaches to the wall.

 "Wow," a man says. The camera swings around and catches Veggie
 standing over another counter, its length swallowed in the gloom of
 the basement. Veggie's flashlight beam glides along its black surface,
 picking out bottles, a digital weigh scale, flasks, and a sink. It
 comes to rest on a humming refrigerator.

 "What's that smell?" Veggie says.  "Sulfur?"

 "Maybe this was a mistake, Salt." A woman's voice, the camera
 operator. "Argo?"

 The camera finds Argo pointing his flashlight over boxes in a corner.

 The video goes black and when the footage starts again, Argo is
 starting up some stairs with Salt behind him. A tall figure emerges
 from behind them. Its eyes are large and bulging. It throws a cloud of
 glittering powder into their faces. Both men collapse gasping and
 coughing onto the floor. The camera dips as its operator begins to
 sway.  She hacks and sputters.

 Argo twitches, trapped by seizure. The figure, whose face is covered
 by a gas mask, bends down and places a bag over Salt's head.

 The camera turns to the stairs. The video fades and goes black.

 Cochone hears ringing in his ears.

 Jenny grins at Cochone and bobs her head as she listens to her cell.
 Her bracelet, which is on the arm holding the phone, has slid down
 toward her elbow . Her cane leans against the wall and next to the
 window, which looks out into the quiet hallway.

 Jenny is stuck in a wheelchair that is a bit too small for her lanky
 body. Cochone has pieced together parts of her story from other cops.
 She hasn't always needed the wheels and cane. She had walked the beat
 when she joined the force, but her career path had veered off course
 after her drunken boyfriend found her in his house with another guy.
 His response was bone shattering. Jenny was smart enough to leave Mr.
 Fists and join the IT department, advancing it into the 21st century
 with innovation that would make NASA envious.

 Cochone thinks that she doesn't look like a computer geek. She is
 slim, and she wears a stylish sleeveless shirt and skirt, which shows
 off most of her tanned legs. Her hair also exudes fashion and flash:
 long, copper, and curled at the bottom. And there's her rack, too. But
 she isn't pretty. Her facial features are pinched, and her lips are
 reddened to a shade that even vice cops would consider excessive.

 Cochone coughs.

 The screen is black, but voices are audible.

 "We have enough now." A man with a French accent. "We can burn this
 place. Leave nothing." It is safest."

 "No." A woman. "My mother. She needs this house."

 "We must burn the basement at least. Nobody can find your work. Marco
 will take their van. We'll take the boat."

 Floorboards creak. Footsteps. The woman, "You should see a doctor.
 That hand looks terrible."

 "Non." Another man's voice. French. "I hate hospitals."

 Footsteps pound down the stairs. A third man. French. "She ran away."

 "We need to hurry then," the first man says. "We'll need to move out
 the stockpile this weekend."

 The sound stops, and the video ends.

 Closeup of a door. Somebody bangs on it from the other side. A woman
 wheezes and gasps.

 The camera shakes. It swings around to a window with a potted flower
 on its sill. The camera drops to waist height. The camera operator
 slides the window open.

 The door bursts open. A scream. The camera shakes and whirls around.

 The camera captures a black man pointing a Glock pistol. Unnoticed by
 the man, a Japanese girl in a white shirt and skirt is standing just
 inside the door.

 The gun clicks. "Merde!" The guy says.

 The girl offers a slight smile, and she nods at the camera.

 The camera operator grunts and wheezes. She throws herself out the
 window. She slams into the ground. The video goes black, but the
 woman's panting can be heard.

 The side of the house appears with the man at the open window. He
 points his Glock down at the camera operator, but nothing happens. He
 slams the pistol against the window frame.

 The woman rises, wheezing and coughing. After a few wobbly steps, she
 stumbles through the trees. She steadies herself with an arm against a
 trunk, and the camera is lifted. She pokes at some buttons, crying.
 She falls. The video stops.

 "Bye," Jenny says, then louder, "You're off to a good start."

 Cochone turns to face her. <span class="floydstyle em">Does she ever stop smiling?</span> He
 wonders. "So far, so good."

 The backyard of the house from a high vantage point. The camera looks
 down over a birdbath next to several overhanging ash trees and a
 fountain with two sculptured figures at its center. The ornaments cast
 westward shadows.

 The footage is speeded up. The bushes rustle, and a fox races across
 the lawn. Wind jostles the leaves of those trees with branches
 sprouting into the open space of the yard. Occasionally some leaves
 break free and sail onto the grass or into the fountain and birdbath.

 The shadows in the yard eventually disappear as the footage continues
 to its end.

 "There's a first time for everything," the man replies.

 "That birdbath was full of water. It hasn't rained in weeks. And it

 *** <span class="floydstyle em">Sequitur</span> is working ... <span class="floydstyle i">Track 7 Kitchen</span>

 The camera frames a spacious foyer and wide staircase, which ascends
 to a second floor lined with doors. A man, the camera operator,
 coughs. Floorboards creak as the camera turns left into a sitting room
 furnished with decades-old sofas and chairs, floral cushions attached
 to wood frames and armrests. An empty fireplace is set in the far
 wall. The muted sunlight, filtered by a yellowed shear over a large
 window, highlights dust. Everywhere.

 The camera operator coughs again and clears his throat. Excited
 chatter behind him. Something bangs to the floor.

 The camera returns to the foyer and finds a music keyboard and guitar
 by the door. It continues into a dining room with a long table
 surrounded by chairs, then it enters a  kitchen. It focuses on a
 refrigerator. The camera operator pulls it open. It's empty. The
 camera finds a sink set into the cracked countertop. The camera
 operator turns the taps, producing only a squeaking sound.

 A chair scrapes the floor. "What did you expect?" A man's voice. "This
 place is abandoned, right?"

 The camera swings around. Argo is sitting at the table. "By the way,
 thanks for the help unloading," he says.

 "I'm here to shoot, Argo. Music is your department. This place is
 great," the camera operator says. "Just like I told you."

 Argo shrugs.

 "C'mon this is the one that puts <span class="floydstyle em">Chien chaud, Chat Froid</span> on
 the charts. Billboard." He sings, "Cover of the <span class="floydstyle em">Rolling</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Stone.</span> 'White Phosphorous' is gonna explode. Forget gold, baby,
 platinum."

 A door slams and floorboards creak. "Hey." Female voice. A woman with
 short blue hair  rushes over to Argo and flops onto his lap. Smiling,
 she wraps an arm around his shoulders.

 The video stops.

 The camera tramples through bush. It finds a dead rabbit with white
 eyes. Zoom in. Maggots squirm in the eye sockets. "Ugh," a woman says,
 obviously the camera operator.

 The camera continues to roam, picking out a few dead blackbirds and
 squirrel. "Wow," the same high-pitched voice says, more to herself
 than anyone else. "What happened here?"

 She focuses on a branch at eye level. Its leaves twingle with gold
 flecks that catch the sun. The camera pans over wilting flowers of
 Spanish moss and monkey flower.

 "I gotta piss."

 The camera whirls around to the white clapboard side of the house
 where Blue is standing, a boarded-up window beside her slim legs. A
 man wearing a <span class="floydstyle em">Pink Floyd</span> shirt  walks into frame and
 addresses Blue, who frowns at him. "Already? We just got here. You'll
 have to go in there." Pink gestures toward the camera. "This place
 doesn't have plumbing."

 Blue scowls. "Okay, but turn that camera off. I don't want any chance
 there'll be some 'whoopsie' footage of me taking a leak."

 The camera is carried down a flight of stairs toward Pink, who is
 closing the front door. "Nickell." A woman's voice. "Did you see a
 girl come down here?"

 The camera steadies on Nickell. He runs a hand through his thick black
 hair. "No, but I was outside setting up. I could have missed her.
 Somebody lives here?"

 "We're not sure," the woman says.

 The camera whirls away and enters the dining room then the kitchen.
 Salt twists the knob of a door in the far wall.

 "What's up, Salt?" Another woman says.

 Salt turns around. "The door is locked. I bet this goes downstairs.
 I'd like to get down there." He sits at the table and Argo joins him.
 Blue walks into frame, tosses a ring onto the table, and continues to
 the door. She twists the knob.

 "Let me have your phone, Argo," Salt says. He extends a hand to Argo.
 "Research."

 Blue looks into the camera. "Are you thinking what I'm thinking,
 Xeno?" She gestures at the door behind her. "Give me your phone for a
 sec."

 "I don't have a 'key' app on that thing, Neo," a woman says as she
 hands over the camera.

 "I want to check something," Neo says, then the video stops.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Audio track</span>

 Excerpts from highlighted sound bites.

 00:42 — Birds chatter and insects buzz. The cawing of blackbirds,
 distant. Their cries crescendo and fade out.

 51:02 — Faint buzz of a boat motor. It eventually drowns all other
 sound. Footsteps stomp along the wood planks of a dock. The motor
 dies.

 "Combien?" A man's voice. French.

 "She wasn't sure." Another man, French accent. "Three. Maybe even four
 or five."

 "Merde." A third French man.

 01:09 — Footsteps along the dock. Water sloshes against the boat.
 Feet
 clomp away.

 01:41 — The faint sound of a vehicle engine.

 02:38 — "We don't need to come back," one of the French men says.
 "It's probably not safe for you either."

 A boat engine revs.

 "Let her go," the man says. "Go home to her family. Live happy. And
 rich. Your husband would be proud."

 The boat drives away.

 Someone knocks at the office door. Nigel appears at Cochone's
 shoulder. "Well, I don't see any smoke pouring from the motherboard,"
 Nigel says.

 "Right," Cochone says. "Marie Curie here must be rubbing off on me."

 "Indeed," Nigel says, "I didn't even think you knew who Curie was."

 "Sure I do. She invented that Indian spice."

 Jenny giggles. Nigel places a box and a can of cola on the desk.

 "Keep rubbing, Jenny," Nigel says. "Maybe something will stick
 eventually." Nigel leaves.

 Cochone regards the hot dogs smothered with mustard, relish, and
 pickles. He turns around. "You want a bite?"

 Jenny reaches into a small bag that hangs from her chair. "No thank
 you. I'm fine." She places a bagel and a bottle of water on her desk.

 "That's healthy. Are you one of those people who won't eat anything
 that farts?" Cochone bites off the tail of one of the hot dogs.

 "Actually I am."

 "Right. Well, I don't want to know what's in this, okay?"

 "You don't want to know my sister found a vein in one?"

 "Yeah. Some girls don't like wieners with big veins. There's so much
 stuff on these that I can't even tell if I'm eatin' the cow's tits."

 "Cows don't have 'tits.'"

 "You haven't seen my ex's mother."

 "Pig."

 "Hey, I'm a Cochone. There's an 'e' at the end." Cochone takes another
 bite of the hot dog, mustard dripping onto his hand. "Mmmm. That's
 good booby."

 Jenny giggles and shakes her head.

 Cochone wipes his hand on a napkin and returns to the computer.

 A girl with long black hair stares out a window, the sun in the east
 sky falling on a potted yellow flower beside her.

 A woman with short gold hair and pointed features  approaches the girl
 and stops at the foot of a bed.

 The girl turns around. She is Asian, mid-to-late teens, and wearing  a
 plain white shirt and a skirt. Her large eyes shift from Foxy to the
 camera, her expression unchanging and flat.

 "We're so sorry." The voice female, the camera operator. "We thought
 this place was empty. I'm Neo, and she is Xeno."

 The girl stares into the camera.

 "What's your name?" Xeno says.

 The girl turns to Foxy and hesitates. "Kiku," she says, quiet and
 accented.

 "Do you live here?" Xeno says.

 Kiku nods and looks down.

 "Are your parents here?" Xeno says.

 Silence.

 "Your mother?" The camera operator says. "Your Father?"

 "Hey." A man's voice.

 Kiku's head snaps away from the camera to stare beyond it. Her eyes
 widen. She rushes past the camera, which swings around to catch her
 disappearing out the door.

 The video stutters. Fades out, clicks on.

 Argo is standing beside the door. "Who's she?" He says.

 "We don't know," Xeno says. "She didn't seem to speak English well."

 The camera follows Argo over to several books on a shelf. "<span class="floydstyle em">Makura</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">No Soshi?</span> Argo says. "If she doesn't, then why does she have
 <span class="floydstyle em">Twilight</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">The Hunger Games</span>?"

 The video stutters and stops.

 <span class="floydstyle em">So the girl we found alive is Xeno,</span> Cochone thinks.

 The camera focuses on Argo, who  is sitting on a bed with a Roland
 keyboard on his lap. "You don't find it weird that this bed is made?"
 Argo says. He lays the keyboard onto the mattress.

 "Don't worry about it. I checked this place out. Nobody seems to know
 much about it, but nobody owns it, man. There's nobody here. We're
 in-and-out in a few hours, anyway.

 The video stops.

 Excerpts from scanned copies of two handwritten pages taken from the
 nightstand:

 October 23, 1968
 I am worried about Kiku. All girls get hurt, but she doesn't heal
 good. I try to help her by telling the men that she's sick and can't
 work. They don't listen. I am teaching her English. She also wants to
 learn to read <span class="floydstyle em">Makura No Soshi,</span> which her mother read to her
 and she brought with her.

 May 4, 1969
 I begged to take Kiku to Mont Helene's so she can have her baby . They
 wouldn't let me. I tried to save her. Poor Kiku was too young maybe,
 too weak. Father Baptiste let me bury her at St. Maria. Thank God her
 baby survived. I took her to the hospital to make her safe. I just
 leave her there. I will leave this place. I will help Kiku's daughter

 Cochone bites into a hot dog, wipes his mouth and fingers with a
 napkin, drinks from the can, and returns to work.

 Some men laugh from down the hall.

 "Marie Curie was a Polish chemist, you know," Jenny says. "She
 discovered radium and polonium. There's an element named after her and
 her husband. Curium."

 "Right. I can read Wikipedia, too."

 "I didn't need to look that up."

 "Did you also know that Pierre was mowed down in the street, died, and
 Marie shacked up with one of his students who she was bangin'?"

 *** <span class="floydstyle em">Sequitur</span> is working ... <span class="floydstyle i">Track 13 Fight</span>

 A closeup of Neo. Her face scrunches, and the camera shakes. "C'mon
 you stupid thing. Work." Floorboards moan. Neo looks up. The phone is
 cast aside, but its eye peeks from a crook in the floral-patterned
 sofa. It captures Xeno gasping and coughing in the hall.

 Neo rushes to Xeno and helps her into the sunlit room. "Xeno? What's
 wrong?"

 Xeno sputters, bends over.

 Neo turns to face the window and disappears from view. "Xeno? There's
 some men coming." She reappears  at Xeno's side.

 The view stutters, scrambles, goes black.

 Audio only. Xeno sucks air. A thud.

 The camera flicks on. A woman — fortyish and tall — is standing
 over
 Xeno and Neo, who huddle together on the floor, oblivious. The woman
 hauls Neo to her feet and pulls her toward the camera. Neo twists, but
 she can't free her arms. "Who? Let me." Neo continues to struggle. The
 woman shifts her stance, flashing a yellow flower tattoo on her arm.

 Xeno, having regained some control over her breathing, gets to her
 feet. She looks left, darts away to her right.

 Crackle. Black.

 The video returns. Neo shakes and cries next to the camera. A black
 man points a Glock pistol at her. Suddenly he is knocked away, the gun
 falling.

 Nickell holding an oar. He goes fuzzy, and the image disappears.

 Thump. A woman screaming.

 A gloved hand appears and punches at something on the floor, fist
 bloodier with every swing. Deep breaths, then the gloved hand pushes
 off the cushion in front of the camera. One of the fingers of the
 glove is shredded. The man hefts himself to his feet. He turns,
 revealing the Glock. Two shots at the body on the floor.

 Neo, in hysterics, is thrown onto the sofa. Two shots.

 Visual and audio cut out.

 *** <span class="floydstyle em">Sequitur</span> is working ... <span class="floydstyle i">Track 14 Squirrel Trap</span>

 The video starts with a closeup of Neo. She stares into the camera,
 her eyes a shade of blue lighter than that of her hair. She pulls the
 camera away from her face. "Seems to work okay out here."

 The camera turns to Nickell, who is sitting propped up against a
 cypress and snarfing down a submarine sandwich. Behind him, the
 sluggish Mississippi River caresses the posts of several dilapitated
 docks.

 "I hope —" Nickell says, but Neo interrupts him.

 "Sshh!"

 A furry head peers out at the camera from a bush to the left of
 Nickell. The camera pans over to the animal, its fluffy tail twitching
 against its twiggy camouflage.

 "Quiet," Neo says. "I've got a great idea."

 Nickell says something that sounds like "Two in ten minutes. That's
 good."

 "Shut up and be quiet. This will be a cool shot if it works."

 The camera jiggles across some trees and away from the animal. Neo's
 hand places a strawberry on the grass, then the camera descends to
 ground level and focuses on the fruit center screen.

 Minutes pass with the occasional twitter and call from some birds.
 Then, a squirrel enters the frame. It scurries awkwardly over to the
 strawberry, nose twitching. Its black fur is speckled with gold dust.
 The squirrel snatches up the bait and scampers off, dragging one
 hindleg through the grass.

 "It worked!" Neo shrieks. The camera is pulled from the ground.
 "Gotcha my pretty. Salt will love this."

 "Let's take a look," Nickell says.

 Neo swings open a door and steps out into bright sunlight. Nickell
 follows her as she walks passed a van, footfalls crunching gravel.
 Birds respond with their own loud calls. The camera joins the two then
 scans some ash trees as if searching for them. It circles back round
 to catch Neo and Nickell disappearing around a corner of the house.
 The footage jiggles as the camera follows the pair, its operator
 breathing hard.

 The shaky camera settles on a large clearing crowded by trees and
 bush. Two black squirrels drink from the birdbath.

 Zoom in. A hindleg of one of the squirrels hangs limply over the side
 of the bowl.

 "Are you getting this, Xeno?" Neo says.

 The squirrels leap from the bowl and scamper up a nearby tree, their
 tails jittering. The camera swings around and pulls out.

 Neo rushes over to the large fountain centered in the yard. "Whoa!"
 She steps back and stares at three sculpted figures. "Is that his ...
 Thing?"

 Nickell saunters up next to her. "Yep. And those are hers, and those
 are hers."

 The camera tightens in on the three naked figures: a man standing in
 the middle of the basin with one girl kneeling  at one side and
 another girl standing on the other, their hands caressing his body.

 "They look a bit young, don't you think?" Neo says. "Kind of gross.
 It's not like an innocent little boy peeing, that's for sure."

 Nickell continues to study the girls. He turns away and looks at the
 camera. "Why don't you turn that off. Maybe we should look around a
 bit. Get an idea of what's here. We don't need everything. This is
 supposed to be like reality tv, remember? It doesn't need to be real."

 The video goes black.

 The camera tramples through bush. It finds a dead rabbit with white
 eyes. Zoom in. Maggots squirm in the eye sockets. "Ugh," a woman says,
 obviously the camera operator.

 The camera continues to roam, picking out a few dead blackbirds and
 squirrel. "Wow," the same high-pitched voice says, more to herself
 than anyone else. "What happened here?"

 She focuses on a branch at eye level. Its leaves twingle with gold
 flecks that catch the sun. The camera pans over wilting flowers of
 Spanish moss and monkey flower.

 "I gotta piss."

 The camera whirls around to the white clapboard side of the house
 where Neo is standing, a boarded-up window beside her slim legs.
 Nickell walks into frame and addresses Neo, who frowns at him.
 "Already? We just got here. You'll have to go in there." Nickell
 gestures toward the camera. "This place doesn't have plumbing."

 wheezes and gasps.

 The camera shakes. It swings around to the window with the potted
 flower on its sill. The camera drops to waist height. The camera
 operator slides the window open.

 The door bursts open. A scream. The camera shakes and whirls around.

 The camera captures a black man pointing a Glock pistol. Unnoticed by
 the man, Kiku is standing just inside the door.

 The gun clicks. "Merde!" The guy says.

 Kiku offers a slight smile, and she nods at the camera.

 The camera operator grunts and wheezes. She throws herself out the
 window. She slams into the ground. The video goes black, but the
 woman's panting can be heard.

 The side of the house appears with the man at the open window. He
 points his Glock down at the camera operator, but nothing happens. He
 slams the pistol against the window frame.

 The woman rises, wheezing and coughing. After a few wobbly steps, she
 stumbles through the trees. She steadies herself with an arm against a
 trunk, and the camera is lifted. She pokes at some buttons, crying.
 She falls. The video stops.

 "I didn't sign up for breaking and entering," Argo says. He rams a
 tripod leg between wood boards and the side of the house at his feet.
 He pulls the tool, and two boards separate from the clapboard with a
 loud crack.

 A murder of blackbirds caw and fly off.

 "I told you, nobody owns this place," Salt says, sliding a knife into
 his pants. "Neo was right. These planks have rotted."

 Argo and Salt free the remaining boards.

 The video stutters, blacks out.

 The footage starts again. An enclosed counter fronted by clear glass
 sits in the feeble light cast by the window beside it. A pipe snakes
 from the top of the fumehood and attaches to the wall.

 "Wow," a man says. The camera swings around and catches Salt standing
 over another counter, its length swallowed in the gloom of the
 basement. Salt's flashlight beam glides along its black surface,
 picking out bottles, a digital weigh scale, flasks, and a sink. It
 comes to rest on a humming refrigerator.

 "What's that smell?" Salt says.  "Sulfur?"

 "Maybe this was a mistake, Salt." A woman's voice, the camera
 operator. "Argo?"

 The camera finds Argo pointing his flashlight over boxes in a corner.

 The video goes black and when the footage starts again, Argo is
 starting up some stairs with Salt behind him. The figure wearing the
 gas mask emerges from behind them. It throws a cloud of glittering
 powder into their faces. Both men collapse gasping and coughing onto
 the floor. The camera dips as its operator begins to sway.  She hacks
 and sputters.

 Argo twitches, trapped by seizure. The figuredraped in darkness bends
 down and places a bag over Salt's head.

 The camera turns to the stairs. The video fades and goes black.

 The camera tramples through bush. It finds a dead rabbit with white
 eyes. Zoom in. Maggots squirm in the eye sockets. "Ugh," a woman says,
 obviously the camera operator.

 The camera continues to roam, picking out a few dead blackbirds and
 squirrel. "Wow," the same high-pitched voice says, more to herself
 than anyone else. "What happened here?"

 She focuses on a branch at eye level. Its leaves twingle with gold
 flecks that catch the sun. The camera pans over wilting flowers of
 Spanish moss and monkey flower.

 "I gotta piss."

 The camera whirls around to the white clapboard side of the house
 where Neo is standing, a boarded-up window beside her slim legs.
 Nickell walks into frame and addresses Neo, who frowns at him.
 "Already? We just got here. You'll have to go in there." Nickell
 gestures toward the camera. "This place doesn't have plumbing."

 Neo scowls. "Okay, but turn that camera off. I don't want any chance
 there'll be some 'whoopsie' footage of me taking a leak."

 The camera is carried down a flight of stairs toward Nickell, who is
 closing the front door. "Nickell." A woman's voice. "Did you see a
 girl come down here?"

 The camera steadies on Nickell. He runs a hand through his thick black
 hair. "No, but I was outside setting up. I could have missed her.
 Somebody lives here?"

 "We're not sure," the woman says.

 The camera whirls away and enters the dining room then the kitchen.
 Salt twists the knob of a door in the far wall.

 "What's up, Salt?" Another woman says.

 Salt turns around. "The door is locked. I bet this goes downstairs.
 I'd like to get down there." He sits at the table and Argo joins him.
 Neo walks into frame, tosses a ring onto the table, and continues to
 the door. She twists the knob.

 "Let me have your phone, Argo," Salt says. He extends a hand to Argo.
 "Research."

 Neo looks into the camera. "Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Xeno?"
 She gestures at the door behind her. "Give me your phone for a sec."

 "I don't have a 'key' app on that thing, Neo," a woman says as she
 hands over the camera.

 "I want to check something," Neo says, then the video stops.

 A girl with long black hair stares out a window, the sun in the east
 sky falling on a potted yellow flower beside her.

 Xeno approaches the girl and stops at the foot of a bed.

 The girl turns around. She is Asian, mid-to-late teens, and wearing  a
 plain white shirt and a skirt. Her large eyes shift from Xeno to the
 camera, her expression unchanging and flat.

 "We're so sorry." The voice female, the camera operator. "We thought
 this place was empty. I'm Neo, and she is Xeno."

 The girl stares into the camera.

 "What's your name?" Xeno says.

 The girl turns to Xeno and hesitates. "Kiku," she says, quiet and
 accented.

 "Do you live here?" Xeno says.

 Kiku nods and looks down.

 "Are your parents here?" Xeno says.

 Silence.

 "Your mother?" The camera operator says. "Your Father?"

 "Hey." A man's voice.

 Kiku's head snaps away from the camera to stare beyond it. Her eyes
 widen. She rushes past the camera, which swings around to catch her
 disappearing out the door.

 The video stutters. Fades out, clicks on.

 Argo is standing beside the door. "Who's she?" He says.

 "We don't know," Xeno says. "She didn't seem to speak English well."

 The camera follows Argo over to several books on a shelf. "<span class="floydstyle em">Makura</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">No Soshi?</span> Argo says. "If she doesn't, then why does she have
 <span class="floydstyle em">Twilight</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">The Hunger Games</span>?"

 The video stutters and stops.

 The camera focuses on Argo, who  is sitting on a bed with a Roland
 keyboard on his lap. "You don't find it weird that this bed is made?"
 Argo says. He lays the keyboard onto the mattress.

 "Don't worry about it. I checked this place out. Nobody seems to know
 much about it, but nobody owns it, man. There's nobody here. We're
 in-and-out in a few hours, anyway.

 The video stops.

 Excerpts from scanned copies of two handwritten pages taken from the
 nightstand:

 October 23, 1968
 I am worried about Kiku. All girls get hurt, but she doesn't heal
 good. I try to help her by telling the men that she's sick and can't
 work. They don't listen. I am teaching her English. She also wants to
 learn to read <span class="floydstyle em">Makura No Soshi,</span> which her mother read to her
 and she brought with her.

 May 4, 1969
 I begged to take Kiku to Mont Helene's so she can have her baby . They
 wouldn't let me. I tried to save her. Poor Kiku was too young maybe,
 too weak. Father Baptiste let me bury her at St. Maria. Thank God her
 baby survived. I took her to the hospital to make her safe. I just
 leave her there. I will leave this place. I will help Kiku's daughter
 find a home.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Audio track</span>

 Excerpts from highlighted sound bites.

 00:42 — Birds chatter and insects buzz. The cawing of blackbirds,
 distant. Their cries crescendo and fade out.

 51:02 — Faint buzz of a boat motor. It eventually drowns all other
 sound. Footsteps stomp along the wood planks of a dock. The motor
 dies.

 "Combien?" A man's voice. French.

 "She wasn't sure." Another man, French accent. "Three. Maybe even four
 or five."

 "Merde." A third French man.

 01:09 — Footsteps along the dock. Water sloshes against the boat.
 Feet
 clomp away.

 01:41 — The faint sound of a vehicle engine.

 02:38 — "We don't need to come back," one of the French men says.
 "It's probably not safe for you either."

 A boat engine revs.

 "Let her go," the man says. "Go home to her family. Live happy. And
 rich. Your husband would be proud."

 The boat drives away.

 "What's the story with the bracelet?" Cochone says. "Are those dogs?"

 Jenny sighs. "Yeah. The three pieces are the dogs I've had." She lifts
 part of the bracelet. "There's Burton, the Lab I had in high school."
 She shifts her finger over to the middle charm. "The small one is
 Hilton. He died of cancer when I joined the Force." She caresses the
 last and largest. "Then there's Chas. He's my Great Dane."

 "Must be hard walking that brute."

 "Not really. Like the breed in general, he's lazy. And when he wants
 to go, I can just take him to a park and let him go. More boys I
 meet." She smiles. "The more I love my dog."

 "Is there any chance you won't need that chair?" Cochone says.

 "Maybe. If I just keep working at it. Part of the problem is balance.
 You know what happened, right? My ex-boyfriend got really drunk and
 came back to my apartment and found me with his friend Chris. We were
 just talking. He was there to see Eric. But when he left, Eric threw
 me against the wall and down the stairs. And he didn't stop there."
 Jenny looks down. "Thing is, he had reason to be jealous. Chris and I
 were talking about how it would work between us. But it didn't."

 "So where is your ex?"

 "He got out of prison a couple of years ago."

 "Ten-to-one says you lose the chair in a year."

 The screen is black, but voices are audible.

 "We have enough now." A man with a French accent. "We can burn this
 place. Leave nothing." It is safest."

 "No." A woman. "My mother. She needs this house."

 "We must burn the basement at least. Nobody can find your work. Marco
 will take their van. We'll take the boat."

 Floorboards creak. Footsteps. The woman, "You should see a doctor.
 That hand looks terrible."

 "Non." Another man's voice. French. "I hate hospitals."

 Footsteps pound down the stairs. A third man. French. "She ran away."

 "We need to hurry then," the first man says. "We'll need to move out

 "Great!" Jenny says with the widest smile she's had all afternoon.
 "I'll get him." She stands and reaches for her cane.

 "Watch it," Cochone says, rising to help her. "Are you sure you're
 okay?"

 "Yes." Jenny stabilizes herself with the cane.

 Cochone wobbles, steps back, and places a hand on the handle of
 Jenny's wheelchair.

 "Whoa," Jenny says. "Are you okay? Excitement too much?"

 Cochone falls into the wheelchair. "Yeah. I'll wait here." He
 struggles for breath.

 Jenny frowns. "I'll be right back." She hobbles into the hall.

 "What was that, Jenny?" Cochone mumbles as his lungs chase oxygen.

 Nigel appears. He is saying something. "I said, 'are you okay?'"

 "Sure," Cochone says. Straightening, he tries to stand, but he teeters
 and falls back into the chair. "Just push me over to the desk, and
 I'll show you what we have."

 Nigel pushes Cochone up to the desk. Jenny watches with concern.

 Jenny and Nigel remain silent as Cochone clicks through the
 ten-segment sequence.

 "Okay," Nigel says. "We're going to get you some medical attention.
 But based on what we've seen, we don't have a lot of time. What do you

 Cochone slumps. His head slams against the desk.

 The songs I had to choose from for the 2014 ShuffleComp:

 Courtney Barnett "Avant Gardener"
 Yosi Horikawa "Wandering"
 Jacques Dutronc "Il Est Cinq Heures Paris S'eveille"
 The Animals "House of the Rising Sun"
 Super Furry Animals "Venus and Serena"
 Chris Powell "Hot Dog"
 The Golden Filter "Solid Gold"
 Red Fang "Wires"


 Several months before ShuffleComp came along in April 2014, I was
 wondering how a work of interactive fiction could be based on the
 found footage genre of filmmaking. I wasn't planning on entering the
 competition, because I was afraid I couldn't develop and implement a
 game within the time alotted. But, a few days before the playlists
 were to be submitted, I thought about how a game could be constructed
 like a CD, with individual tracks making up a whole album. The
 interface could be much like a CD player. Then I realized this fit
 well with my found footage idea, and <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur</span> followed from
 there.

 Of the songs on the playlist I received, "House of the Rising Sun" and
 "Solid Gold" had the greatest influence on <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur.</span> The
 Asian brothel and Cochone's gambling were inspired by The Animals'
 song, as was the prison (which some music critics think is the real
 "House of the Rising Sun"). The band name, The Animals, also inspired
 the naming of the main characters, and Jenny's dogs are named after
 members of the band. Because of "Solid Gold," i added the
 chemical/alchemical aspect of the story. References are made
 throughout the game to elements — the names of the band members are
 abbreviated names for the noble gases argon, neon, and xenon, for
 example. "Hot Dog" and, to a lesser extent, "Il Est Cinq Heures Paris
 S'eveille" also influenced <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur</span>. Most obviously,
 Cochone's favorite food, the name of the band, and the vegetarian
 references were inspired by the former, and the Fench element was
 included because of the latter. This is just a sample of how these
 songs shaped the game; you'll likely find other similarities.

 I chose these songs based on listening to them, not on their videos.
 Only after <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur</span> was being developed did I go through the
 videos. As it turns out, those for "Wandering" and "Wires" share some
 themes with the game, but these similarities are coincidental. I
 enjoyed all of the songs on my playlist — six of the eight were new
 to
 me. Listen to all of them then turn on the radio. After all, the word
 "music" is derived from the Greek "muse."

 Cochone glances at Jenny. Her fingers dance over the laptop, her
 bracelet jiggling around one wrist . Her lunch, a bagel, is sitting on
 the desk behind her. Her cane leans against the wall and next to the
 window, which looks out into the quiet hallway.

 Jenny is stuck in a wheelchair that is a bit too small for her lanky
 body. Cochone has pieced together parts of her story from other cops.
 She hasn't always needed the wheels and cane. She had walked the beat
 when she joined the force, but her career path had veered off course
 after her drunken boyfriend found her in his house with another guy.
 His response was bone shattering. Jenny was smart enough to leave Mr.
 Fists and join the IT department, advancing it into the 21st century
 with innovation that would make NASA envious.

 Cochone thinks that she doesn't look like a computer geek. She is
 slim, and she wears a stylish sleeveless shirt and skirt, which shows
 off most of her tanned legs. Her hair also exudes fashion and flash:
 long, copper, and curled at the bottom. And there's her rack, too. But
 she isn't pretty. Her facial features are pinched, and her lips are
 reddened to a shade that even vice cops would consider excessive.

>examine cane
 —

 Cochone glances at Jenny. Her fingers dance over the laptop, her
 bracelet jiggling around one wrist . Her lunch, a bagel, is sitting on
 the desk behind her. Her cane leans against the wall and next to the
 window, which looks out into the quiet hallway.

 Jenny is stuck in a wheelchair that is a bit too small for her lanky
 body. Cochone has pieced together parts of her story from other cops.
 She hasn't always needed the wheels and cane. She had walked the beat
 when she joined the force, but her career path had veered off course
 after her drunken boyfriend found her in his house with another guy.
 His response was bone shattering. Jenny was smart enough to leave Mr.
 Fists and join the IT department, advancing it into the 21st century
 with innovation that would make NASA envious.

 Cochone thinks that she doesn't look like a computer geek. She is
 slim, and she wears a stylish sleeveless shirt and skirt, which shows
 off most of her tanned legs. Her hair also exudes fashion and flash:
 long, copper, and curled at the bottom. And there's her rack, too. But
 she isn't pretty. Her facial features are pinched, and her lips are
 reddened to a shade that even vice cops would consider excessive.

 Cochone rotates his chair around to face Jenny. "I have it. Let's get
 Nigel in here." He coughs.

 "Great!" Jenny says with the widest smile she's had all afternoon.
 "I'll get him." She stands and reaches for her cane.

 "Watch it," Cochone says, rising to help her. "Are you sure you're
 okay?"

 "Yes." Jenny stabilizes herself with the cane.

 Cochone wobbles, steps back, and places a hand on the handle of
 Jenny's wheelchair.

 "Whoa," Jenny says. "Are you okay? Excitement too much?"

 Cochone falls into the wheelchair. "Yeah. I'll wait here." He
 struggles for breath.

 Jenny frowns. "I'll be right back." She hobbles into the hall.

 "What was that, Jenny?" Cochone mumbles as his lungs chase oxygen.

 Nigel appears. He is saying something. "I said, 'are you okay?'"

 "Sure," Cochone says. Straightening, he tries to stand, but he teeters
 and falls back into the chair. "Just push me over to the desk, and
 I'll show you what we have."

 Nigel pushes Cochone up to the desk. Jenny watches with concern.

 Jenny and Nigel remain silent as Cochone clicks through the
 ten-segment  and short sequences.

 "Okay," Nigel says. "We're going to get you some medical attention.
 But based on what we've seen, we don't have a lot of time. What do you
 think we should do now?"

 Cochone struggles with his thoughts.

 Cochone tries to concentrate, to move.

 "Just relax, Steve," Nigel says. "Take a break if you need to. Has he
 been like this all afternoon, Jenny?"

 "He seemed a little sick when he got here this morning," Jenny says.
 "But he wasn't this bad."

 Cochone slumps. His head slams against the desk.

 Jenny gasps.

 Cochone feels hands on his shoulders. Whispering. " ... Steve to the
 hospital ... " Nigel's voice.

 " ... Go with him ... " Jenny now. " ... Let you know ... "

 Cochone blacks out.

>whole story

 The members of <span class="floydstyle em">Chien Chaud, Chat Froid</span> and the video
 producers arrive at the ostensibly abandoned house to shoot video for
 their latest album ("Kitchen"). The gang then splits up; Neo, Nickell,
 and Xeno explore outside ("Backyard" and "Dead Zone") while Argo and
 Salt scout the rooms for somewhere to set up their equipment
 ("Diary"). Neo and Xeno find Kiku ("Chrysanthemum") while Nickell
 places a camera outside to record the backyard ("Time Lapse"). Argo,
 Neo, and Xeno pass Nickell, who is entering the house, on their way to
 see Salt in the kitchen ("Locked Door"). Salt investigates the ring
 (which Neo found while urinating in the trees) and the diary contents
 ("Google"). Neo and Nickell decide to eat outside, where the latter
 sets up his audio recorder ("Sound Test"), and Neo discovers the
 injured squirrel has been exposed to the gold powder ("Squirrel
 Trap"). Despite exposure, the squirrel seems healthy.

 Salt convinces Argo and Xeno to break into the basement through the
 boarded-up windows, and they are attacked by Kiku's daughter
 ("Basement"). The startled blackbirds are caught by the audio
 recorder, which also picks up the arrival of the terrorists, Nickell
 retrieving the oar, and Kiku's daughter leaving in the boat with one
 of the terrorists ("Diary"). Neo has already returned to the house and
 tries to help Xeno, but the terrorists arrive ("Fight"). Xeno escapes,
 but Neo and Nickell are killed. Xeno runs up to Kiku's room where Kiku
 helps her escape out the window ("Escape"). The terrorists and Kiku's
 daughter decide to burn the laboratory before leaving ("Torching").
