    What sucks, about being the pro agent for a sociopathic defensive
 tackle like Tavarian Pittman, is the never-ending, ulcer-inducing,
 cloud of dark dread that seems to follow him and those that associate
 with him.  Tavarian is a chiseled 6'4", 313lb athletic monster -- he
 can run the 40 yard dash in 4.33 seconds, and can throw opposing
 players around the football field with ease.  While playing, he is a
 whirling dervish of rage.  Unfortunately, Tavarian displays that same
 kind of restraint in everyday life.

    Four months ago, he celebrated winning an award at the Nokia Sugar
 Bowl by crashing an off-campus party and proceeded to get roaring drunk
 with his friends.  It was a theme party -- a pre-med student hosting it
 had a cadaver on display as the party's centerpiece.  After drinking
 himself into an almost criminal level of intoxication, Tavarian and his
 friends started throwing the corpse around the house as if it were an
 old softball.  Tavarian punched a hole through the back of the thing's
 neck and started a ventriloquist act in extremely poor taste.

    An attending film studies student had brought his camcorder with him
 and recorded the entire thing.

    It made national headlines: Tavarian was called out by sports
 writers everywhere, denounced as an archdemon, and the summation of
 What's Wrong With Collegiate Sports.  His nickname soon became 'The
 Ripper' when one beat writer wondered if his next act was in writing
 "Dear Boss" letters to the local paper. Tavarian had already declared
 for the NFL Pro Draft, so he had no option of returning to school and
 laying low until the incident blew over.  He was likely to go
 completely undrafted, as no professional team could afford the PR hit
 they would take by selecting him.

    You'd been trying to make it on your own as a sports agent for a
 while now.  You love the independence of being your own boss, you'd
 always loved sports and you wanted to be able to provide an affluent
 living for your wife and the baby that was on the way... but it hasn't
 been easy.  Becoming successful on your own has been a complete
 Catch-22 -- you need to sign a high-profile client in order to make any
 real money, but no normal athlete wants to risk being your first big
 contract.

    Tavarian was looking for an agent when you met him while scouting a
 winter baseball game a few months back.  You had managed to win a huge
 arbitration case for the backup shortstop on the Red Sox -- no small
 prize, considering the perennial all-star he plays behind -- and you
 started to generate whispers that perhaps you had a talent for working
 miracles.  Tavarian, who was in need of one, introduced both himself
 and his girlfriend Theresa during the game.  You in turn introduced
 your wife, Charlise.  Both girls were five months pregnant with their
 first child and they completely hit it off.  Charlise practically sold
 you herself, painting a glorious picture of how hard you work and what
 a good soul you are -- essentially depicting you in the kind, glowing
 terms that she sees you with everyday.

    Tavarian expressed to you his desire to turn his life around and get
 drafted by an NFL team in April, and ultimately hired you that day.
 Since then you have been working the circuit, trying to bend the ear of
 the 32 NFL general managers.  It hasn't been easy -- being away from
 your wife for most of the time has been excruciating, really -- and it
 didn't help when Tavarian spent a night in jail after going berserk on
 some pizza delivery guy while Theresa was visiting her parents... but
 with a calming influence around him 24/7 ever since, there have been no
 other problems.

    Really, he doesn't seem to be the psychotic harbinger of death that
 the media has painted him out to be.  Not when you really get to know
 him.

 Golf Course
    You're on the golf course with the general manager of the New
 England Patriots.  The meeting is going well, so far, but your mind is
 really with Charlise, who is now nine months pregnant and due any day
 now.  Funnily enough, even in your semi-distracted state, this is the
 first team you've made progress with.  It's a good fit -- they see you
 as a local boy who can be trusted, and they have some serious defensive
 issues they could solve with Pittman.  The Patriots are picking
 twenty-third, and have a history of not being overly concerned with
 drafting or signing guys with... well, with some question marks.
 Katzenmoyer, Peter, Meggett, Mowatt -- it's not exactly like
 quarterback Donny Osmond handing off to halfback Marie.  If you can
 just convince them to meet Tavarian... then, provided he just acts like
 himself, he's at least got the opportunity to charm them.  Maybe they
 don't take him in the first round, but even if he is taken in the
 second or third it would be a great day for him, *considering* and all,
 and a major success for yourself.

 Dan Fonda, the general manager of the Patriots, is here with you.  He's
 up two strokes on you, but is heading for a triple-bogey on this hole.
 The other two guys in the foursome -- director of Player Development
 Terry O'Hare and current player Bucky Johnson, are a dozen strokes
 behind you two.  You can probably get it into the cup in two strokes
 from here, and win the match outright.  Or, should you slice, hook or
 just outright shank it, you'll ensure that Fonda wins.  He seems
 earnest and sincere, and the kind of guy who wouldn't catch on if you
 let him win.  But then, he might be the kind of guy who doesn't respect
 someone who can't "beat" him on the greens.  Just which you're not sure
 of, yet.

>win
 I don't know the word "win".

>learn how to play golf
 I don't know the word "learn".

>examine me
 Your name is Kieron Scott.  You are an agent within the field of
 professional sports, and just starting out with your own business.  You
 are in your late twenties, are about 5'10", 175lbs and have blue eyes
 and black hair.

>inventory
 You have a pitching wedge.

>examine wedge
 Your pitching wedge.  True, sturdy, and faithful.  You had messed
 around with graphite clubs before, and still use them occasionally, but
 when the pressure's on, you want Old Faithful at your side.

>examine ball
 Titleist, #3.

>hit ball toward hole
 I don't know the word "toward".

>examine dan
 Dan Fonda is a former cornerback who worked his way into the NFL by
 putting in hard time in every league he could find until he could get a
 look -- the XFL, the Canadian Football League, Arena ball, and some
 Soviet Prison Conference that he doesn't talk about that much.  A few
 years past his playing days, he's kept himself in excellent physical
 shape, and seems to have stepped right out of an old 'Dockers'
 commercial.  You suspect that he's receptive to bringing in a player
 like Tavarian, who has a few strikes against him, because he's had to
 scrape his way to the top himself.

>hit ball
 You swing the club, and sure enough, your aim is sweet.  You land the
 ball onto the green and manage to sink it in on the next putt.

 "Good work," beams Dan.  "It's been a long time since I've had any
 competition, especially playing with these two clowns," he gestures
 over to Terry and Bucky.

 "Yeah, you watch out, Fonda, I get this kink out of my swing and I'm
 all over you," says Bucky.

 "You had eight mulligans, Bucky," says Dan.  "You've been discarding
 more balls than the guy who does the neutering over at the local vet."

 "Ouch," says Terry.  Ouch, indeed.

 Country Club Parking Lot
    Finding your car in the parking lot isn't extremely difficult -- as
 it's not a Lexus, Porsche or BMW, 99% of the cars are eliminated right
 away.  Of the two remaining cars, the jet-black Hummer with a woofer
 completely taking up all available space past the front seats belongs
 to Bucky, and the 95 Neon is yours.  (Hey, at least it's the two door
 version with the big engine, and not some wood-grained station wagon
 that would garner nothing but looks of disdain and sympathy from the
 other golfers.)  You head over toward it in order to put your clubs
 away.

 "Say, Kieron," says Dan, "Why don't you come over to the club house
 with us.  We could talk some things over regarding Pittman and the
 draft."

>examine bucky
 I don't see any bucky here.

>examine neon
 Your Neon has served you well -- no headgasket problems yet.  The
 interior is a little noisy, but overcome with its decent stereo system.

>turn on stereo
 I don't see any stereo here.

>enter neon
 You can't enter your car while carrying your clubs!

>open trunk
 Opened.

 "Tell you what," says Dan, "I'm going over to the club house -- meet us
 there for lunch."

 Dan then heads south, over toward the club house.

>put clubs in trunk
 You put the clubs away and then shut the trunk.

>enter car
 You open the car door and get in.

 Inside your car
    Chrysler did some good work with the early model Neons -- although
 there isn't much room in the backseats, and the dash, save for your
 built-in cell phone, is kind of spartan, it's plenty comfortable and
 extremely responsive.  Overall, it kind of moves like a slot car.

>turn on stereo
 I don't see any stereo here.

>turn on radio
 The car hasn't been started.

>close door
 It's already closed.

>turn on car
 I don't know how to turn your car on.

>turn ignition
 I don't know the word "ignition".

>examine key
 I don't know the word "key".

>start car
 Before starting the car, you decide to run over to the club house and
 tell Dan that you can't stay for lunch.

 "Dan," you say, "I'd love to be able to stay and chat.  Thing is, my
 wife is due any moment now.  I've really got to drop by and check up
 real quick, in case something happened and she was unable to reach me
 with the phone.  It's odd -- she should have called by now.  Tell you
 what, though, why don't I meet you and Terry for a couple beers
 tonight, provided she doesn't go into labor?  I've got a presentation I
 can give that will explain just why I honestly believe that Tavarian
 has shaped up, and what he can do for your club."

 "No problem," says Dan.  "You've got my number, right?  Sounds like a
 plan."

 You've actually got no presentation in mind, but you pretty much know
 what you want to say -- it's just a matter of turning it into a format
 that Microsoft Powerpoint can understand.  But hey, living life on the
 edge like this is what being an agent is all about.

 You say good-bye to both Terry and Bucky and head back toward your car.

 You place the key into the ignition and give it a turn -- the car fires
 up without a problem.  (You get a wistful, longing glance from the guy
 next to you trying to start his MGB, but ignore it.)

 Your favorite radio station is apparently in the middle of an
 eight-minute marathon of Third Party Microsoft Certification
 commercials, so you change over to NPR.

 Turning out of the country club and heading home, things are pretty
 slow-going. As it turns out, according to the radio, somebody snapped
 today and is waving a gun at people a few dozen miles down the freeway.

>You don't need to turn the car on, *I* do
>drive

 The traffic is still something awful up ahead.

>get out of car
 Always trying to get yourself on Fox's 'World's Most Suicidal Drivers,'
 aren't you Kieron?

 You try to drive, but can't get very far because of the backlog of
 cars.

>change channel
 I don't know the word "channel".

>change radio
 I don't know how to change the radio.

 Hm... looks like the congestion of cars is starting to thin a little...

 It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to call Charlise and let her know
 you're going to be a little late.  She might have heard about the
 lunatic on the highway and might be, rightfully so, a bit concerned.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

 The traffic jam has almost completely dispersed.

>call wife
 The phone rings eight times and the answering machine picks up.
 Usually the both of you leave a rather detailed message for one another
 when leaving the house, so she's probably napping or something.

 A police cruiser goes screaming past you in the breakdown lane.

 You put the car into gear and drive home.

 You pull into the garage, close the garage door and get out of the car.

 Garage
    You are in your garage.  It's technically a two-car garage, but as
 you only have one automobile, you've got a lot of floorspace designated
 for various tools and around-the-house equipment.  To the east is the
 laundry room door.  The garage door has been closed behind you.

 You hear a buzzing sound coming from the laundry room.

>examine tools
 The tools and equipment aren't important.

>examine tools
 The tools and equipment aren't important.

>go east
 (Opening the laundry door)
 Laundry room
    Sometimes, when you've started to take for granted what an absolute
 treasure you have as a wife, she goes and pulls a stunt like this and
 raises the bar.  Even though her water could break at any moment now,
 she still managed to haul down a few of those bulky sweaters you like
 lounging about in from the top of your closet, and place them into the
 dryer.  After all, warm equals sanitary, safe, and clean.  Bringing
 down one of them is considerate, sure.  But four or five?  So you can
 pick one out specifically?  That's above and beyond the call of duty,
 alright.

>examine sweater
 The sweaters are in the dryer.

>open dryer
 You open and turn off the dryer, and place the sweaters on top of it.

>take sweater
 Which sweater do you mean, the knitted sweater, the Red Sox jersey, the
 UCONN sweatshirt, the Scottish knit, or the wool sweater?

>examine knitted
 You'd always suspected that your weren't your aunt's favorite, and this
 crimson-and-fluorescent oversized monstrosity she gave to you two
 Christmases ago was the smoking gun as to why.

 Your dog scratches at the hallway door.

>examine sox
 #5 NOMAR!  MVP!

>examine uconn
 It was a gift from a few years ago when they were doing that
 inexplicable 'The Team That Makes You Go Hmm' slogan phase.  You're no
 scholar, but neither a stranger to lore and letters.  But you can
 perceive no sense there as to why *that* was their slogan.

>examine scottish
 This was a gift from Charlise when she went visiting her ancestors in
 Glasgow a few years back.  It's really held up well over the years, and
 you get all sentimental thinking of what a great value it was just by
 looking at it.

>examine wool
 Okay, you don't wear this out in public much, but Charlise digs it, so
 what can you do.

 You hear your dog Watson barking in another room.

>take scottish
 Taken.

>wear scottish
 You put it on and quickly remove it -- you're a bit warm after being in
 the sun all day.

>look
 Laundry room
    You're within your Laundry Room -- it's a close-quartered little
 thing that links your house's hallway, which is to the north, with the
 garage.  There's a washer and dryer here.
    Sitting on the dryer is a knitted sweater, a Red Sox jersey, a UCONN
 sweatshirt, and a wool sweater.

>open washer
 Done.

 You hear your dog Watson barking in another room.

>look in washer
 There is nothing in the washing machine.

>look in dryer
 There is nothing in the dryer.

>go north
 (Opening the hallway door)
 Hallway
    A few pictures line the hallway, but it's otherwise sparse.  Your
 living room, kitchen, and bedrooms are further down the hall to the
 north.

 Your dog Watson runs to your feet.

>pet dog
 The beagle wags his tail at you happily, and returns to his puttering
 around.

>examine dog
 Watson is a faithful and handsome young beagle, with brown eyes and tan
 and white fur.

>give sweater to dog
 The beagle rejects the offer.

>take dog
 You pick up the beagle and pat him on the head a couple of times.  He
 licks your face and then you gently put him down.

>pet dog
 The beagle wags his tail at you happily, and returns to his puttering
 around.

>examine pictures
 Charlise has a knack for decorating, they complement the hallway
 nicely.

>look

    A few pictures line the hallway, but it's otherwise sparse.  Your
 living room, kitchen, and bedrooms are further down the hall to the
 north.
    Your beagle is here, puttering around.

>go north
 Hallway
    You're about halfway down your hallway.  To the west is your living
 room.  The bedrooms and kitchen are further north, down the hall.

 Watson runs past your feet down the hallway and disappears into the
 living room, barking and yelping for your attention.

>go west
 Living Room
    You enter your living room and automatically take a whiff of the
 room's scent -- the smell of your new leather couch isn't so new that
 you don't notice it yet.  It cost you almost the entire commission you
 made when you got Artero Gueterrez a six-month minor league contract
 with the Toledo Mud Hens, but both you and Charlise had earmarked this
 one for years.  (Good kid, that Artero, but couldn't hit a curveball in
 an airless vacuum.)

 The room is laid out with the couch in front of your television and
 stereo speakers.  A couple of Charlise's frescos hang from the walls,
 and you've started to add stucco to the ceiling.  A couple of your
 golfing trophies adorn the shelves near the phone, and a signed
 Garciaparra bat is also hanging up, encased in a plastic preservation
 shell.

 Watson's over in front of the couch, sniffing and snorting at
 something.

 Your main front window has a long crack running through it.

 The auxiliary window to the right of that one is completely shattered.
 Glass from it has sprayed out onto your floor, definitely smashed from
 something or somebody on the outside.
    Your beagle is here, puttering around near the couch.

>examine couch
 After years of sitting and sleeping on a second-hand couch that your
 older brother gave you from his college years, you were happy to have
 this nice leather one.  There are claw marks in the carpet near the
 edge of the sofa -- it appears as if Watson has been trying to get at
 something.

>examine glass
 The shards of glass are almost everywhere.

>examine carpet
 It's hunter green and in good shape, save for the shattered glass and
 claw marks near the sofa.

>look under carpet
 The carpet isn't important.

>look under couch
 You find a baseball, which you promptly pick up.

>examine baseball
 It's not one of yours... it's apparently what was thrown through your
 front window.  There's some writing on it, in a flowery cursive text,
 not completely unlike an autograph.

>read writing
 Upon closer inspection, it's not an autograph at all.  You make out the
 words, slowly, but it says:

 NO TIME TO SQUEAL KIERON

>look
 Living Room
    Something -- a baseball, a rock, a human fist -- tried getting into
 your house earlier.  Glass is strewn all about your floor from your
 (former) right front window.

 Exits lead north to your kitchen and east to the hallway.
    Your beagle is here, puttering around near the couch.

>squeal
 There is no time.

>show ball to dog
 The beagle isn't impressed.

>clean up glass
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>throw ball
 It would be simpler to just drop the baseball.

>take glass
 That would hurt, though.

>search couch
 There's nothing on the couch.

>look

    Your beagle is here, puttering around near the couch.

>go north
 Kitchen
    Pots, pans, chairs, tables -- and your wife laid out on the floor,
 not moving, in a puddle of... something.

 Watson enters the kitchen sheepishly.

>examine wife
 She's breathing.  You try to wake her up, gently.  You go to move her
 head away from the side of the counter and notice her hair stuck to it
 in some kind of paste or something.

>examine paste
 It's blood from the side of her head.

>call 911
 I don't know how to call the number 911.

>search wife
 There's nothing in your wife.

>look

    Pots, pans, chairs, tables -- but none of that matters right now.
    Charlise is here, unconscious or asleep on the floor.
    Your beagle is here, puttering around.

>panic
 I don't know the word "panic".

>cry
 I don't know the word "cry".

>xyzzy
 Sorcery in that manner seems to fail you.

>help wife
 You clear her hair away from the side of the counter.  It looks like
 you might have pulled a little too hard, though, because the pain wakes
 her up.

 "Ow!" says Charlise.

 Not leaving anything to chance, you run into the living room and dial
 911, asking for an ambulance -- you then sprint back to be with your
 wife.

>talk to charlise
 "Are you okay?  Honey?"  You don't want to shake her or anything -- but
 if you have to, is that okay?  Maybe, though?  You can't remember what
 you're supposed to do if this comes up, even though that girl from the
 breathing classes covered this.

 Charlise doesn't really respond -- she's still groggy from the fall.

>look
 Kitchen
    Pots, pans, chairs, tables -- but none of that matters right now.
    Charlise is here, still woozy from the fall.
    Your beagle is here, puttering around.

>examine chair
 I don't see any chair here.

>help charlise
 There is no more blood to clean.

>take wife
 You pick her up and carry her outside the house.  The ambulance comes
 quickly and whisks you both away.

 LDR Room
    The LDR (labor, deliver, recovery) Room is a warm, yet somewhat
 generic, setting designed to provide for the comfort of each patient,
 newborn, and family member throughout the birthing process.  The decor
 is straight out of Disney Corp's idea of pregnant bliss:  azure walls
 covered with the occasional sunflower, well-polished teak furniture, an
 antique rocking chair.  The fetal monitor and other assorted scanning
 equipment seem almost out of place here.

 "What happened?" you ask Charlise.

 Charlise struggles for a bit to remember.  "Watson was barking at
 something...  I was in the bedroom...  I don't know what happened, I
 think I slipped or something... oh, God, Kieron, this doesn't feel
 right at all..."

 The nurse arrives from the hall.

>talk to nurse
 "What's up -- is she going to be okay, is the baby -- "

 "Just one sec," she says, "I'll find out in just a bit."

 The nurse begins hooking up the various monitors to Charlise.

 The nurse introduces herself and begins checking on your wife.

>talk to charlise
 "Hey, chin up, kid" you say.  She gives you a questioning look,
 something that effectively says Why are you talking to me like you're
 coaching a tee-ball team?

 The nurse puts a belly band on your wife.

>examine belly band
 The belly band is wrapped around your wife's belly.

 The nurse patiently waits for the fetal monitor to give a reading.

>examine monitor
 It looks like a 17" monitor running some kind of proprietary birthing
 software.

 The nurse is reviewing the monitor strip.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The nurse is studying the fetal monitor with a concerned look.

>squeal
 There is no time.

 The nurse's face goes white.  She moves over toward the intercom.

 "Paging Dr. McKinney, I need you in LDR 14 STAT, paging Dr. McKinney,
 LDR 14 STAT!"

>hold wife's hand
 I don't know the word "wife's".

>wait
 Time passes...

 The nurse takes your wife's blood pressure and checks her heart rate.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The nurse continues to study the fetal monitor strip.

>hug wife
 It's difficult to get your arms around her, but you do the best you
 can.

 The nurse takes your wife's temperature.

>talk to wife
 "Look, I'll give your parents and your sister a call after this," you
 say.  "Is your sister still living in Colorado?"

 "I think she just recently moved toward the desert," says Charlise.

 The doctor arrives from the hall.  He takes a look at the monitors, and
 does a very poor job of attempting to conceal an expression of horror.

 "Let's get her over to the operating room," he says.

 Outside the Operating Room
    Charlise was brought into the Operating Room, but you were told to
 stay outside.  You're not sure if she's okay, if the baby is okay, or
 what is going on in there, but you have to find out.
    There is an orderly here, sitting at the end of a long metal bench.

>talk to orderly
 "Hey, look man...  that's my wife in there.  Can't you let me in?"

 The orderly shakes his head in the negative.  "I'm sorry -- can't do
 it."

>punch orderly
 The orderly punches you back, and then lets the confrontation drop.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 Outside the Operating Room
    The OR Hall is a big, empty room with aqua tiles and a bench to sit
 upon.  There is a door that leads into the operating room itself.  To
 the right of the long metal bench is an intercom.  The orderly won't
 let you in, though.

 The intercom is a smallish box that is used as a means of paging other

 A janitor arrives from the hall.  He goes over toward the intercom and
 speaks something into it.

 As he heads down the hallway, he stops to chat with the orderly.

 "Hey, Jimmy," says the janitor.  "How are you?"

 "Good, good," says the orderly.  "I think I finally have this flu beat.
 And you?"

 "Oh...  just dandy.  Nice weather we're having, isn't it?"  says the
 janitor.

 "Yes, quite comfortable," agrees the orderly.  "Unseasonably warm,
 even."

 "Did you hear about that mess on the highway?" asks the janitor.

 "Actually, I did.  Weird for someone just to lose it that way, wouldn't
 you say?"

 The orderly lets out a low whistle.

 The conversation subsides and the janitor continues down the hallway,
 disappearing into a utility closet.

>examine closet
 I don't know the word "closet".

>examine orderly
 He is a friendly chap, determined to not let you pass him.  The word
 "ROGERS" is on his nametag.

 You try and engage in some small talk, but fail miserably.

 "Whoops," says the orderly.  "I'll be right back."

 (Opening the OR door)
 Operating Room
    The Operating Room is fairly dark, save for the operating table
 illuminated by the strong lights that Charlise is on.  There is a
 doctor and nurse here working by her table.

 "How did he get in here?"  asks the nurse.

>judo chop nurse
 I don't know the word "judo".

>talk to nurse
 "I just want to know what's going on," you say to the nurse.

 "The doctor is attempting a c-section.  Stand over there, and be quiet,

 know."

 "I'm not sure what it is, right yet," she says.

 You overhear a bit of the conversation between the doctor and his
 assistants.  It doesn't sound good, it doesn't sound like the baby made
 it...

>save baby
 Please specify the name of the game to save in double quotes, for
 example, SAVE "GAME1".

 Dr.  McKinney comes over to you.  "Mr. Scott, I'm sorry..." he begins.

 The words slough off your ears, you stare off, in disbelief...

 "Charlise is going to make a full recovery, but the baby, we
 couldn't... she didn't make it."

 Gone?  Like that?  But why, for what reason...

 Your knees buckle briefly, and you fall to the ground.  You need to get
 up, you know that you need to get up, 'she'?  A baby girl, your baby
 girl, gone, you imagine your wife's eventual tears, that she has yet to
 find this out, you have to be there for her, buck up, get it together,
 but everything your hear and see meshes into a horrible cacophony...

 "You can't possibly want another one."

 But Mother, I can!

 "Oh, you *are* the fickle one, aren't you, Sweet Pea?"

 O, I'm dainty!

 "If I can not put up a reasoned, well-thought out resistance as to why
 we should not be waddling our way over to the refrigerator and
 consuming yet another batch of old-fashioned brined dill pickles, then
 how on earth am I going to have the parental confidence to tackle such
 inevitable topics like The Truth Behind Santa Claus, Braces & Social
 Ostracization, and The Senior Prom?"

 .  .  .

 "Exactly.  Although there is no manual, per se, on any of this, I'm
 fairly confident that brazenly conforming to your every wish and desire
 is probably the wrong way to tackle parenting."

 "Though...  they *would* be quite tasty."

 Bedroom, on the comfy chair
    Inexplicable vegetable cravings aside, this room leaves you quite
 content for the moment.  You're curled up in what you and Kieron call
 'the comfy chair', reading one of the Dean Koontz novels you missed in
 hardcover.  Being 39 weeks pregnant, you've had ample time to catch up
 on your reading.

 Your bedroom is paneled with a kind of faux wooden interior, to kind of
 make it look like the inside of a log cabin.  To your left is your bed,
 and just beyond that is a dresser.
    Your beagle is here, puttering around.

>examine watson
 Watson is a faithful and handsome young beagle, with brown eyes and tan
 and white fur.

>pet dog
 The beagle wags his tail at you happily, and returns to his puttering
 around.

>examine dresser
 The dresser complements the other furniture nicely.

 Watson's ears perk up, and he leaves to the hallway.

 You feel the baby squirm about... and find yourself talking to her, for
 just a bit.

 "The first time he came home from work, after we got back from our
 honeymoon... he was drenched in sweat after having beaten some kid ten
 years younger than him in basketball.  The kid eventually signed with
 one of the larger branches, No Limit, or something like that.  Kieron
 came in with that sad, exhausted look on his face... I think he knew at
 that point that he wasn't going to sign him.  I was fussing over this
 one painting -- trying to get colored lighting for it, before the paint
 congealed -- and he dropped his briefcase on the floor and said 'I
 think one of us needs a hug.'  I turned, looked over toward him,
 somewhat slightly confused.  After a beat he said, 'It's not you is it?
 Ah, ah right... must be *me* then.'"

 "And that's how it began, married life.  You never really prepare
 yourself for that moment.  You can read all the articles you want on
 the subject, but you don't know... when that critical moment comes...
 if you'll be looking at the rest of your life with someone who is
 really just a stranger.  Or someone who will remain just as fresh,
 funny, and driven as the day you met him."

 "I took the next day.  To commence with the props, I mean.  And we've
 traded off and on like that ever since.  And on those days where he
 utterly failed to get a signature on a deal he was assured was a 'lock'
 and on those days when my greens and oranges have turned to blue and
 red, we've sounded off to each other, individually and in concert.  And
 I hope, sure, that one day you'll feel this -- get this -- as well,
 Sweet Pea."

>talk to baby
 You recall a few verses that you had been reading earlier before, some
 nonsense nursery rhymes, really:

 "He thought he saw an Elephant,
 That practised on a fife:
 He looked again, and found it was
 A letter from his wife.
 'At length I realise,' he said,
 'The bitterness of Life!'"

 "He thought he saw a Rattlesnake
 That questioned him in Greek:
 He looked again, and found it was
 The Middle of Next Week.
 'The one thing I regret,' he said,
 'Is that it cannot speak!'"

>open dresser
 You're preoccupied with food for the moment and decide to not go
 looking through your dresser.

 Watson starts barking.

>look

 Oof!  You're not too sure about the feasibility of that.  Maybe in a
 bit.

 You hear a crash -- it sounds like one of the windows in your living

 You can hear Watson barking.

 Ah, almost there.  Trivial tasks have really become grand gestures
 lately for you.

 Okay, you're no longer on the comfy chair.

 Another enormously hectic day at the Saint Columbia Veteran's Hospital,
 but hectic in a good way -- there's a palatable energy in the air with
 the recent flood of newborns and the successful bypass surgery of a
 minor (although, incredibly talented and quite gracious) celebrity
 having been recently completed.

 Your friend -- and fellow nurse -- Jessica has been talking up a
 double-blind date that the two of you are to be going on this weekend,
 which will at least be interesting if nothing else.  Last time the two
 of you tried this, she found a couple guys from an Internet Go Server.
 While they were definitely amusing, (and definitely available) they
 were a little too preoccupied with moving stones around a monitor
 screen.

 Trying to get them out of the house again proved to be almost
 excruciatingly difficult.  So Jess has things planned with some other
 guys she met over Relay Chat.

 "They are into something," Jess said, "called Magic: The Gathering.
 See?  That implies that they are into social get-togethers and
 gatherings.  It's all been taken care of.  Plus, they sent me gifs of
 themselves and they have that David Copperfield meets Harry Houdini
 thing going on, as all magicians do.  Trust me!"

 Well, you seem to recall something about that being a card game, but
 why not give her the benefit of the doubt?  It's good to get out and
 mix things up socially again, especially since the last creep you dated
 finally got the message and stopped coming around the hospital.

 You can't help but notice the clock -- 1:17pm.  Still another thirteen
 minutes left of this break.  Excellent.

 Break Room
    You're inside one of the many break rooms here at the Hospital, just
 recharging with some apple chips and a bottle of Evian before heading
 back to your shift.

 The door leading out of the break room is to the west.

>eat apple chips
 You eat some apple chips.

>drink water
 You drink the water.  Very refreshing.

>again
 You drink the water.  Very refreshing.

 Your friend Jessica pops her head into the room for a moment.

 "Sarah, it's Freddie," she says.  Freddie.  Your ex-boyfriend.  He
 hadn't come to work in order to stalk you for almost two weeks now.  It
 would be too soon if he held out for two more centuries.  "I tried to
 tell him that you weren't working today, but he says that he saw your
 car.  Do you want me to -- "

 "No, it's okay," you say.  You've tried being nice.  You've tried being
 stern.  You've tried to gently break the news to him that you no longer
 wish to see him, and you've told him point blank to his face.  Enough
 is enough.  It's time to start being a complete bitch -- anything to
 let him know you're serious.

 Jen gives you a thumbs-up sign and wishes you luck.  She leaves the
 room and goes toward the reception area.

>go west
 (Opening the door)
 Reception Area
    This is where the patients' guests and loved ones congregate before
 entering the rest of the hospital and the individual rooms.
    Freddie is here, looking grim.

 "Thank God you're here," he says.  "I have something to say to you,
 please, just hear me out."  He can't help instinctively giving you a
 visual once-over; must be the uniform.

>examine freddie
 Freddie's about 5'9", and 150 pounds.  He's very handsome on the
 outside, in a young-Robert-Redford way, but just not someone you want
 to be around because of what he's like on the inside.  He's a bit of an
 aspiring inventor, and tinkers around with electronics but has no real
 formal education and gets frustrated easily.  He's obsessed with a girl
 being around while he works away at one of his many poorly-conceived
 mechanical devices, but then goes into total ignore mode once you -- or
 one of his other previous girlfriends -- comes over.  And you stopped
 being That Girl somewhere between age 14 and 15.  Also, when things
 start to go wrong with one of his projects he swears like a blue-faced
 sailor.  And he gets *mean*.  Etcetera, etcetera.  It just got
 pointless to be around him.

 "I was working on the refrigeration unit -- you know, the one I was
 telling you about before," he says, as he brings a hand up to brush his
 fair hair out of his face.  "And I knew, really, that I had to have you
 back.  I have a poem for you.  Can I -- is this okay?"

>talk to freddie
 "This really is not the time, Freddie.  Listen, I don't want you coming
 here any more.  Do you understand?"  "Please," he says.  "Just listen.
 Hear me."

 Freddie pulls out a piece of paper.

>hit freddie
 Probably best not to do that, he'd interpret it to mean that you still
 want his bod.

 Freddie clears his throat and continues.

 "And if I say to you tomorrow," Freddie says, in a very bad British
 falsetto, "Take my hand, child, come with me.  It's to a castle I will
 take you, Where what's to be, they say will be."  He looks up briefly.
 You try to remember where that is from.

 "Catch the wind, see us spin,` he continues, "Sail away, leave today,
 Way up high in the sky."

 "But the wind won't blow, You really shouldn't go, It only goes to show
 That you will be mine By takin' our time.  Oooh, oooooh....."

>kiss freddie
 You'd hate to give him the wrong idea -- besides, he's really pissed
 you off by coming down here.

 Freddie licks his lips and continues singing.

 "And if you say to me tomorrow, Oh what fun it all would be, Then
 what's to stop us, pretty baby, But What Is And What Should Never Be."

 He looks up at you with puppy-dog eyes.  As if reading the lyrics --
 badly -- to an old Led Zeppelin song is somehow going to instantly
 change the fact that he's a mite desperate oil-covered stalker without
 a hint of real social charm?

>wait
 Time passes...

>talk to freddie
 "What on earth was that, Freddie?"

 "It was 'What Is And What Should Never Be' from Zep's second album.  I
 -- "

 "I know what it was.  You had to come down here, and interrupt my break
 for that?  You simply had to state that, hm?  What on earth does that
 even mean, anyway?  'You will be mine by taking our time'?  Is that
 what you think?  How can I put this into words you'll understand -- Go
 away.  Leave me alone, and never speak to me again.  Am I getting
 through to you?"

 "But -- "

 "Apparently not.  Look, I'll put this into words that you can
 understand."  You clear your voice and start singing a quick impression
 of the Led Zeppelin song called "D''yer Mak'er."  "Go, go, go, go, go!"

 Freddie digs through his jacket.

>talk to freddie
 You start to speak, but he cuts you off in mid sentence.

 Freddie shows you a gun, briefly.

 "See this, bitch?  I'm going to make you sorry you ever met me."

 Freddie puts the gun away and storms out of the hospital.

 A moment later, your name comes up on the intercom.

 "Sarah Thompson, please report to LDR 14, Sarah Thompson, LDR 14."

 The LDR -- the labor, delivery, and recovery room -- is just north of
 the reception area.

>follow freddie
 I don't see any freddie here.

>go north
 You enter the LDR Room, one of many here at the hospital -- a bit of
 oversentimental tedium designed to keep the expectant couples thinking
 pleasant thoughts, and introduce yourself to the patient and husband.

 "Hi, I'm -- "

 "Sarah, right," says the man, "I know.  Look, I am really concerned
 about my wife here, can you --"

 "You bet, don't worry.  I will take a look and see what's up."  You
 suspect that everything will probably be okay -- it was just a nasty
 shock to her head, not a gunshot wound to the belly or anything, but
 you feel the need to play it cool in case something is the matter.

 You hook the belly band up to the woman and turn on the various
 monitors.

 "So, do you follow the Red Sox?"  you ask the husband, in an attempt to
 liven his mood a bit and get him thinking of another kind of tragedy.

 "Yeah, a little -- hopefully this'll be the year," says the husband.
 "I mean, we get Garrett back, we have new management..."

 You take a look at the monitor strip.  Things do not look good, but you
 continue to play your poker face.

 "New management, right?"  you say absent-mindedly.  "Wait, wasn't that
 one guy who those crazies put out on a stake and -- "

 "Well, yeah, Duquette, the GM.  Kind of a shame seeing him on fire like
 that, but I guess we New England denizens can only go so many centuries
 without burning witches and heretics at -- "

 You study the fetal monitor.

 Everything makes sudden, horrible sense.

 Something -- the umbilical? -- is wrapped around the baby's neck.

 Your face goes white.  The husband stops in mid-sentence.

 After getting to the intercom, you send out a page:

 "Dr. McKinney, I need you in LDR 14 STAT, paging Dr. McKinney, LDR 14
 STAT!"

 The husband looks confused and alarmed, but you have work to do.  You
 take his wife's blood pressure, temperature and heart rate.

 "We're going to need to get to the OR," you tell the husband, softly.

 Dr. McKinney does his best to save the little girl.  The poor baby had
 a nucal cord -- they're just so damn hard to predict.  You head over to
 the OR table to see if CPR can save a life, but before you arrive, you
 stop dead in your tracks as you watch the father's face fill with
 horror.

 You overhear a bit of the conversation between the doctor and his
 assistants.  It doesn't sound good, it doesn't sound like the baby made
 it...

 The doctor shakes his head and leaves the operating table.  You can
 tell from the manner in which he carries himself that the baby didn't
 make it.

 He passes you, just a shell of his regular self.  This is the first
 time you've seen him like this -- he's usually a bastion of security
 and success.

 Dr. McKinney goes to break the news to Kieron, the woman's husband.

 You leave the Operating Room.  You wander back over to the break room
 to pick up your stuff.  Jessica meets you half-way there.

 "Did you hear yet?"  she says.  "Freddie's on the news.  They've got a
 camera on him.  Over on channel 5."

 "I don't really want to hear about Freddie right now," you say.

 "What's wrong?"

 "The baby, the baby from LDR 14, you know, that couple?"

 "Oh, yeah."

 "The baby died.  Dr. McKinney just -- well, I just got back."

 "That's so sad," says Jessica.  She pauses a couple of respectful
 beats.  "Let's go get some lunch."

 The shrieking squeals of the damned bring you back into a hazy
 consciousness.  As you begin to soak in the unbearable ambiance around,
 you attempt to shake off your rising awareness for a few moments more
 of self-ignorance.

 Your jailer enters from the palpable darkness; all business this
 morn(?).  It checks the integrity of your shackles, in a horrible
 pantomime of surface world care.  Where does it expect you to go?
 Where does it suspect you will scurry to?  His actions relating to
 internal security only bring forth a dull hope into your mind, a hope
 that he will torture away without expression.

 Hell
    Being damned for all eternity, this is your 'home'.  This particular
 cell of yours has no real name or identifiable markings.  You can't
 even recall if you've always been in this particular station, or some
 other any longer.  It appears to be a claustrophobic, hollowed-out cave
 within the heart of an active volcano.  If you strain, you can make out
 passageways to other caves, but turning your head to the side is often
 prohibitively painful.
    A brawny, sinewy Cacofiend stands before you, prepping you for the
 punishment you are about to receive.

>examine cacofiend
 The Cacofiend is eight or nine feet tall, proportionally wide, and
 enormously muscular.  Its skin appears to be a kind of unearthly,
 fire-charred, thick crimson hide.  Its face is grotesque, misshapen --
 with caking and protruding horns screaming out from its skull, angry
 daggers for eyes, a rotting, bulbous nose... it's incapable of bearing
 personal malice, and carries itself like a mindless automation.

 The Cacofiend digs its nails into your flesh, right into the little
 divot above your breastbone.  You squirm, to no avail.

>talk to cacofiend
 You begin to speak but the cacofiend screams for your silence -- you
 quickly comply.

 The Cacofiend rips the skin of your chest, exposing your ribcage,
 stomach and various entrails.  One of your intestines slithers down to
 the hot floor.

>wait

 Something's beeping.

 The Cacofiend looks over toward your right for the source of the
 beeping.

 It sounds like a pager.  Well, the parts that don't sound like souls

 The Cacofiend hands you the pager.

 "It's for you..." he says with a shrug.

 Your Office
    You never thought of yourself having some sort of 'God' complex, so
 awakening from a dream where you were being burned alive in hell,
 purgatory or whatever is easily brushed off with a swig of Mr. Pibb and
 a couple moments to simply compose yourself.  You're on a hot streak
 now, anyway -- after successfully delivering quintuplets for that rock
 star two days ago (the lead singer for -- what was that band's name?
 -- Scatbag or something, you think) you got the admiration of not only
 every Gen X-er on the staff, but your daughter as well, for delivering
 the offspring of "the voice of her generation".  But impending fame has
 its ups and downs -- while you're due to be interviewed by Salon.com
 for saving the woman's life, it looks like your interviewer... will be
 Au James Wagner.

 You win some, you lose some.

>examine pager
 From the extension, it looks like you're needed STAT in LDR 14.

 You let out a loud gassy burp; that Mr. Pibb was really carbonated.

>save baby
 I don't see any baby here.

>go up
 You can exit the office by going north.

>go north
 You exit the office and rush over to the LDR.  You're updated by the
 nurse and quickly head over to mom.  You take a look at the monitors,
 and do a very poor job of attempting to conceal an expression of
 horror.  You turn toward the nurse.

 "Let's get her over to the operating room," you say.

 Operating Room
    The Operating Room is fairly dark, save for the operating table
 illuminated by the strong lights that the patient is on.  The nurse
 updates you on the woman's condition.

 Before you is the patient's belly, prep'd for the C-Section.

>examine woman
 The patient is draped and ready for the C-Section.

>inventory
 You have a scalpel.

 A small burp escapes from your mouth, definitely Mr. Pibb.  Thankfully,
 the nurse didn't hear it.

>operate
 (the patient)
 (with the scalpel)
 You make a low transverse incision, and cut through the layers of
 muscle.  You can now see the baby.

>examine baby
 You notice the baby girl has a nucal cord.  You try to reduce it by
 slipping the umbilical cord over the baby's head, but it's too tight.

>cut cord
 (with the scalpel)
 You double clamp the cord and cut it in the middle.

>give cpr
 I don't know the word "cpr".

>take baby
 The OR door swings open and somebody enters the room.  The nurse rushes
 over to him and has a quick conversation -- he takes a few steps back
 and watches intently.

 You reach in and extract the head.  The nurse suctions the head and
 nose, getting the amniotic fluid out of the airway.  You then deliver
 the shoulders and the baby slides out -- it doesn't make a sound.  You
 hand the baby girl to waiting pediatrician where they attempt CPR.
 After several minutes of frantic resuscitation, the baby stirs for a
 moment, a split-second so short that you wonder if it existed at all.
 They continue to attempt to revive her, but she collapses further.
 It's as if something more than a simple umbilical cord has taken her
 life...

 You see the worry and sweat pouring off the baby's father.  This won't
 be easy... it never has been before.

 Alley
    A filthy place, mongrels and predators scurry and skulk about the
 edges of your vision, seemingly self-satisfied in their hidden snark
 just beyond your focus.

 The alley wall behind you rises until it seems that you shall never
 grow tall enough to surpass it.  It melts away in its own acclivity,
 merging into a starless night.  Walls to both sides reflect a build of
 age and accompanying deterioration.  Your skin crawls with the
 sensations of spying from some things, some group of denizens choosing
 themselves to be, as of yet, unrevealed.

 Fogging spoils your far sight to the west, while it reveals your sole
 path for this continued evening venture.

 Alley
    Before you is the door to a home, a crumbling dwelling lost in the
 alley.  The air here is thick, as if you are uncomfortably supporting
 it and propping it up.  The glow of a gas streetlight throws flickery
 shadows upon the lone window of the slum apartment.  The alleyway
 street is still quite sticky here, and each footstep concludes in
 release from an audible 'glop.'

 The alley continues into further fog to the west and east and to the
 north is the rotting apartment.

 The occasional chirp of a nearby salesman can be heard to the west.

>listen to salesman
 I don't see any salesman here.

>examine door
 The door appears withered, yet is locked from within quite forcibly.

 A bit of light escapes from the door underneath.

 You hear a cry from behind the door!

 A woman's voice, struggling: "O... Murder!"

 Further sounds of thrashing emote from within.  You hear something wet
 and sticky strike the other side of the door and fall.

>knock on door
 You knock on the door.  Eerie silence.

 A wiry, black rat wriggles its way out from underneath the door and
 scurries away to the alley to the west.

>examine rat
 The rat has scurried far away by now.

 The occasional chirp of a nearby salesman can be heard to the west.

>follow rat
 The rat has scurried far away by now.

>go west
 The alley opens into a thicker white fog.

 Alley
    You are at the western edge of what was once a filthy, urban alley.
 It has morphed into a quieter, nigh angelic scene.  Thick clouds have
 touched down and billow endlessly, within continual waves defined by
 their own soft motion.  The alleyway stretches away until it, seemingly
 hundreds of yards away, bubbles away into the night into an
 effervescent rise of environmental content.
    A man stands nearby, smiling vacantly, shifting his weight from foot
 to foot.

>examine man
 His inherent, learned honesty betrays any possibility of The Ruse.

 "Hello, little one," he says.  "My name is John."

 "They are quite delightful," says John.  "Not much call for them

 John bends his brittle frame over, to speak to you eye-to-eye.

 "Do you know what this is?  What's contained within?  Alright.  I'll
 tell you.  But where to begin?  I can see you have no coin or copper,
 but I'll presume your credit's good.  It can be our little secret, if
 we like, and I definitely suspect, even... that we should."

 John brings down the potion and hands it to you.

 "Something wonderful is sure to happen, usually your prayers will be
 answered in kind.  Just be certain of your intentions and faith, for if
 you react with a curse or a whine, these wares of mine are liable... to
 get all mixed up!"

>examine potion
 The potion looks quite pure, no suspended particles of any kind.

 It is purple.

 Alley
    You are at the western edge of what was once a filthy, urban alley.
 It has morphed into a quieter, nigh angelic scene.  Thick clouds have
 touched down and billow endlessly, within continual waves defined by
 their own soft motion.  The alleyway stretches away until it, seemingly
 hundreds of yards away, bubbles away into the night into an
 effervescent rise of environmental content.
    A man stands nearby, smiling vacantly, shifting his weight from foot
 to foot.

>drink purple
 Gulp!

 The thick white fog dissipates and you wander back to...

 Alley
    Before you is the door to a home, a crumbling dwelling lost in the
 alley.  The air here is thick, as if you are uncomfortably supporting
 it and propping it up.  The glow of a gas streetlight throws flickery
 shadows upon the lone window of the slum apartment.  The alleyway
 street is still quite sticky here, and each footstep concludes in
 release from an audible 'glop.'

 The alley continues into further fog to the west and east and to the
 north is the rotting apartment.

>drink purple
 Gulp!

>pray
 The apartment grows before your very eyes!

 You are momentarily disoriented and the beaker slips out of your tiny
 hands, shattering on the ground.

 There is four inches of space in between the bottom edge of the door
 and the road.  You peer as best you can into the apartment itself and
 see little, save for the motions of one in light footwear skirting
 around a positioned bed.

 You knock on the door.  Eerie silence.

>pray
 You shrink further.  It seems like you are three, perhaps three and a

>go north
 Being quite small in size, you run under the door and into the
 apartment...

 Apartment
    You are within a cramped apartment, no greater than 12 feet square.
 Directly across from the front door is a fireplace, full of deep soot
 and organs.  To your right is a compact board table, adjacent to a bed
 propped approximately one foot high by a secondary, mildewey mattress.

 A human-sized, upright Hare breaks from ripping the intestines of a
 bound, human woman and carefully peers at your entrance.

 The woman moans -- a strained wail -- her head slumped over and eyes
 appearing dead.

>examine hare
 He is wearing a glossy top hat, a mirrored monocle over his left eye,
 and a swashbuckler's vest.  His nose twitches irregularly, as if a
 symptom of a spastic, involuntary syndrome.  His white fur is stained
 crimson in splashes, where the woman's blood and flesh has splattered
 and soaked into it.

 The hare rips away a purplish, engorged organ and some fleshy, meaty
 sections of the woman's stomach.  He hurls these parts at the left
 wall, splashing her blood everywhere and he does so with meticulous
 strain and patience.

 The woman cries forth with cursing, swearing, and explicatives that you
 have never, ever heard before in your life.

>kill hare
 You are much too small and insignificant to hurt the Hare.

 The Hare snaps off a piece of intestine and throws it at you!

 The intestine shifts into an ugly garden snake mid-flight, and snares
 itself around your neck!

 The woman's eyes close, a terrible wheeze of air leaves her esophagus.

>pray
 Nothing happens.

 The Hare snaps the neck of the woman.

>cry
 I don't know the word "cry".

>examine fireplace
 The fireplace is filled with organs, sweat, blood and soot.  Looking
 within it, it appears to get lighter at the other end, not darker.

 The Hare squats down and enters the fireplace.  It leaps once, and
 appears to have left the apartment completely.

>squeal
 There is no time.

 "Sing another song for me, sweetie, and I shall certainly return myself
 to sleep and slumber," says the snake.

>enter fireplace
 You make your way into the fireplace.

 Apartment, in the fireplace
    The fireplace is filled with organs, sweat, blood and soot.  Looking
 up, it appears to get lighter at the other end, not darker.

 You have nothing sharp enough to cut the snake with.

 The snake flashes briefly animate for a moment to tighten its grip.
 "Snug, isn't it, my lovely?"  he whispers before quieting once again.

>sing
 What do you want to sing to?

>look

 The snake flashes animate once more, and begins to join your song.  In
 between slurred humming, he says, "I understand, you know, your clever,
 clever ruse.  Really!  I do!  But, my love, I am no savage beast to be
 beaten with a song.  I feel our love can't quite continue like this for
 very long.  For I am your special friend this eve, and I am very, very

 Directly across from the front door is a fireplace, full of deep soot

 There is a prostitute here, tied up, shredded and destitute.

>search soot

>ask snake about snake
 The snake just hisses...

>search organs
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine prostitute
 She is a wisp of a woman, approximately 5'7" and slight of build.  She
 is laying in tattered clothes on a stinking mattress, her hands and
 left leg bound to the apartment walls with thick chain.  She has been
 viciously ripped from just below her neck straight down toward her
 pelvis, Her internal organs are scattered about her gaping chest
 cavity, although some have leaked over to the bed and others smear the
 walls, slowly crawling down to the floor.  Her long blonde hair is
 matted with blood and pulp into the sheets upon her bed, and she seems
 unable to focus, articulate her horror, or die.

>ask snake about hare

 The snake chortles deeply and tightens itself slightly around your
 neck.  Though as small as yourself, it frustrates all attempts at
 discovery, exploration, and conversation.

>curse
 "Ahh..." breathes the snake, "deliciousss...!"

 You have grown a little larger.

>enter fireplace
 You make your way into the fireplace.

 Apartment, in the fireplace
    The fireplace is filled with organs, sweat, blood and soot.  Looking

 You have grown a little larger.

 You have grown much larger, and are almost full size.

>curse
 "Now this is most comfortable, sweeeetieeee....!"  The snake breathes
 up close against your ear.

 You are now your natural size.

 The snake tightens its grip around your neck once more.  "Not too tight
 just yet, I hope," he mutters.  The snake returns, quickly, to its
 pseudo-slumber.

>go up
 You are not tall enough.

>curse
 You grow again, past the container of the fireplace itself and you find
 yourself within a reserved, quiet study...

 Study
    This is a long, open drawing room evidently used for study and soft
 research.  A rich, teak desk sits in solitude, equidistant from the
 west wall (upon which hangs a set of somber oil paintings) and the east
 wall (almost completely defined by stained glass).  Near the desk is
 Rumford fireplace, the same portal from which you arrived.  Toward the
 far wall is an ornament stand, and wire stairs that lead up to an
 in-house second level and black door.

>inventory
 You have a snake (wrapped around your neck).

>examine stand
 The ornament stand is right before a door that leads, presumably,
 outside.  It has two legs, sits two feet high and two feet across.  The
 tabletop has been buffed and polished to a satiny sheen.

 On the ornament stand is a battle scene.

>examine scene
 A tiny, yet exquisitely detailed figurine made up of several different
 autonomous pieces that, together, depicts a swordsman brandishing a
 steel blade against several cornered beasties.

>examine blade
 It is about the length of the swordsman's torso.  The sword would
 appear to be detachable.

 It is terribly small.

 You choke, suddenly!  The snake arises for mere moments, to simply
 increase the pressure around your neck.

>go west
 (opening the door first)
 Fog, of makeup you have seen before, spills out from the locale beyond
 and into yours.  A slavering roar splits your eardrums -- a terrible
 gyre and gimble that nearly knocks you down!

 Emerging from the clouded beyond is a single monstrosity, a grotesque
 jabberwock with jaws that bite and claws that catch!  Its beady,
 squinty eyes ooze thick pus as it contorts its vision in order to find
 you.  The beast now blocks your path.

 You are too small in size to cause any damage.

 The jabberwock gives you a once over... but the beast displays no
 intelligent cunning whatsoever.

 Forest path
    The Hare witnesses your emergence and blitzes down the path, three
 steps for every one of yours.  Sufficiently in the lead, he pauses for
 a moment and produces a shiny timepiece from one of the pockets of his
 leather vest.  Wiping its brow (and streaking crusts of haemoglobin
 everywhere!) the Hare does a backflip and gives you a wave.  Though a
 vial drops from its half-jacket, it fails to notice and immediately
 continues its sprint until the path meets with the horizon.  You are
 centered within a dark forest path.  The lit, full moon provides more
 than ample light with which to comport yourself in your usual angelic
 sway.

 The plant-life and vegetation all carry a healthy glow around them,
 they grow thick amongst each other, intertwining to prevent passage in
 all directions except those that please them.  You spot a vial at the
 edge of the forest path.

 The path seems to lead in all directions, yet none appear inviting.

>take vial

>examine vial
 Inside the vial is fermented pickle juice and a half-kidney.

>drink vial

>examine plant

>climb plant
 I don't know how to climb the vegetation and plant life.

>go north
 You follow the forest path a ways, it winds about, and eventually leads
 to a clearing...

 Clearing
    Fine, powdery dust and shards make up a solid foundation for this
 out-of-the-way little vortex in the forest.  The clearing is in the
 shape of an oval, and twenty yards across.  Two creatures bicker back
 and forth.  They are little more than giant heads with distended, ugly
 feet attached to them.

 "I'll devour you, Oaf!" says one.  "I'll munch upon that ugly face,
 bite by tantalizing bite and you shall witness it all, for the last
 morsel will be that pinched, sickly eye!"

 "Not before I, Roaf!" exclaims the other one.  "You may bark and wheeze
 in your misguided, pathetic attempts to frighten, but I shall skewer
 you into meaty, tasty strips and use that ridiculous eyewear to magnify
 the light and heat them!"

>examine oaf
 He is a flighty, wavy head, bright in tone, with wavy auburn hair and a
 lone, suspicious eyeball.  Two mangled, twisted feet poke out from
 neath his chin.  He possesses no torso, arms or legs.

 "Oh, why look, Roaf!" exclaims Oaf.  "A little girl has wandered into
 our little stead!  Why hello there, little one!  Would you care to stay
 for a meal?"

 "You're ruining it, you great, stupid Oaf!" screeches Roaf.  "A
 mindless, blue-skinned deafened mute could see through your terrible
 ruse!"

>examine eyeball
 I don't know the word "eyeball".

>examine roaf
 He is a darkened, malformed head, shadowed in tint, with fuzzy black
 hair and oversized eyewear.  Two mangled, twisted feet poke out from
 neath his chin.  He possesses no torso, arms, or legs.

 "Why surely her daddy has yet to inform her of the seductive stylings
 of strangers," says Oaf.  "Besides, she has a nasty little pusher
 around her neck. Her time runs negative toward forward!"

 "Oh no, praytell," states Roaf.  "I have it on positively smashing
 authority that her daddy knows all about you and I, my witless and
 quite stupid chum!  He truckles up to them like a suckling leech,
 pulling away their spirit and cares!"

>talk to roaf
 "It is a difficult path at first," says Roaf, "but I will make it all
 worthwhile."

 "Are your fatted lobes growing larger, Roafie old boy?" asks Oaf.
 "They look positively delectable.  I think I would enjoy chewing them
 like flavoured rubber for the better part of the upcoming fortnight.
 Or perhaps basted in a rich creme sauce!"

 "Mind your manners, you," mutters Roaf, while staring you up and down.
 Saliva glistens and drips off his teeth, and he grins a positively...
 Cheshire grin!  "I think it would be best if we let the hopeless little
 venger choose."

 "Choose what, Roaf?" asks Oaf.  "Surely you mustn't let fair play get
 in the way.  Not now, not ever!  What ever do you mean?"

 "All I mean is that I ache for the completed set," says Roaf.  "Don't
 you see?  It is this way in which I may have it all."  He refuses to
 look at anyone or anything but you.  "Go ahead, my light-hearted
 friend," whispers Roaf.  "Choose the loser of the game."

>examine vial
 Inside the vial is fermented pickle juice and a half-kidney.

>inventory

 Roaf looks at you in anticipation.

>SAVE

 Saved.

>choose roa

>choose roaf
 Roaf gasps!

 Oaf pounces, with quickness like a cobra, onto Roaf and begins savagely
 tearing away his features.  Roaf kicks, flails, rolls...  anything to
 scatter and free himself.  Oaf snares the eyewear with his teeth and
 crunches them into powdered dust.

 Roaf's horrible howls cause you to drop to your knees and cover your
 ears.  Rather than watch the consumption, you bury your head until the
 wailing and screaming stops.

 With the return of the forest's eerie silence, you look up again.  Oaf
 chews on something with excessive pantomime, before meeting eyes with
 you and spitting a wad of flesh onto the ground.

 Oaf wanders off the way you came before finally disappearing.

 "Delightful," muses Roaf.

 Roaf thrusts himself over toward Oaf and knocks him into the ground.
 He strikes, quick as a cobra, and sits atop him, his teeth gnawing and
 biting away chunks of Oaf's face.  He rips shredded specks of skin and
 flesh and spits them out to one side.

 Oaf howls, a cry more of defeated agony than that of rage or directed
 anger.

 Roaf finishes his meal.  Ultimately, not a scrap of Oaf remains.

 His hunger unsatiated, he then jumps on you and continues to enjoy his
 repast.

 Clearing
    Before you is a brick wall that extends into perilous overgrowth.
 The wall is several times your height and quite impassable.  There is a
 small table set before the wall itself.

 You notice a single meter-high creature swinging back and forth on a
 brass bell that emerges from the top two layers of the wall.

>examine table
 On the table are numerous stones, with single-digit numbers upon most
 of them.

>examine creature
 It is an animate, swinging egg.  A completely blank face, it has four
 impossible limbs arranged like that of a person's, and is clad in fuzzy
 jams.

 The egg speaks:

 "I thought I saw a little girl
 Free from the black murder:
 I looked again and found it was
 Covered in filthy burr.
 Have we have met once before my child?
 How old ja say joo were?"

 The creature holds out one of its hands.  The other holds tightly to
 the bell, and it continues to swing back and forth.

>take seven
 Taken.

 "I think," says the snake, "that I'd like to play a quick game.  I'll
 swallow my own tail!"  The snake gets tighter around your neck, but
 makes a show of failing to bite its end.  "Oh, sorry, my lovely.  I'll
 just have to get closer, later!"

 The snake returns to its sleep once more.

>give seven to creature
 "I thought I saw a little girl,
 Upon her final day.
 Eager to play my riddles and
 Friendly all the way.
 And though we'd never met, your age
 Is what you'll never say!"

 The egg releases its handhold on the bell!

 The egg tumbles toward you, and knocks you down!

 The egg hops back up into the air and with a somersault and twist,
 grabs the bell once again.

 He then promptly eats the seven stone.

>ring bell

 The egg drops the stone and it lands on the small table.

 Taken.

>give blank to creature
 The egg speaks:

 "My heart, my heart, oh hateful day!
 You've never said before!
 Your age is quite foreign to me,
 Quite clever, mi amour.
 And though we've never met, my heart
 Just leaps upon the floor!"

 The creature shifts violently to one side and rings the bell.  The
 sounding of it sends a audial wave that knocks you back into tumbles
 for several meters.

 As you slowly right yourself you see the egg cracked open with a
 beating heart left behind, and that the wall has been broken into
 crumbly bits, allowing passage.

>examine heart
 The heart is about the size of two of your fists.  It beats slowly, to
 a steady, hollow beat.

>take heart
 Taken.

>examine wall
 I don't see any wall here.

>go north
 You climb passed the fallen bricks and enter the plains beyond it.

 The Close Edge of the Plane
    The forest ends on this side of the wall.  Grassy, lushy plains,
 spread from feathered jade slip beneath your toes.  Once more, a
 brilliant fog cuts off your view of the horizon.  Fifteen meters east
 of the ruins of the once-brick wall (and in the middle of the plains)
 is a sandy circle.

 You can see and hear the Hare here, he mumbles and meeps in spastic
 seizures, tossing a killing knife from hand to hand.  He is far away
 from you, however, and shows no signs of getting closer.  The snake
 becomes animate once again.  It buzzes in your ear.

>examine circle
 It appears to be a flattened sphere of sand.

 There is nothing in the circle.

 The snake whispers into your ear:

 "Do you see him, little one?  I think he wants to make a trade.  There
 are three fleshy artifacts that you have encountered, and no I am not
 one.  But do not feel inclined to play his game, all you have to do is
 take me to him, together.  For together we can stop this charade!"

>examine hare
 He is wearing a glossy top hat, a mirrored monocle over his left eye,
 and a swashbuckler's vest.  His nose twitches irregularly, as if a
 symptom of a spastic, involuntary syndrome.  His white fur is stained
 crimson in splashes, where the woman's blood and flesh has splattered
 and soaked into it.

>enter circle
 "You're not going to make this trade, are you?" meekly queries the
 hateful snake.

 Sandy Circle
    This is naught but a flattened sphere of sand, free from foul
 contaminates.

 There is nothing in the circle.

 The Hare spies you and tugs upon its ear!

 The Hare spies you and beats upon its chest!

 The Hare spies you and chortles while holding its sides!

>SAVE

>give heart to hare
 It's too far away.

 The Hare spies you and tugs upon its ear!

 The Hare spies you and beats upon its chest!

 stone, and a heart.

 The Hare spies you and chortles while holding its sides!

>drop heart and vial
 heart:  Dropped.
 vial:  Dropped.

 The Hare leaps from the other side of the plains, and into the circle
 with you!

 The Hare sniffs and collects the items in the circle.  It holds them
 within its hands, and regards you with a cruel, guttural sounding.

 "I laughed myself into fits over that foul juwess.  The last job, well,
 was nice and clean but not this one (I love it, so.)  Where to find a
 Christmas box, then?  I suppose I will have to give you a running start
 as I fit myself the box instead."

 The Hare drops the killing knife.

 The snake twists its head until it is in your vision.  It does not look
 very content.

>take knife
 As you pick up the knife, the snake coils in fear.

 "No!"  hisses the snake, "Together we can be so much stronger!"  The
 snake tightens itself around you.  "Besides, fat lot of good that will
 do!"

 The Hare rips apart the earlobe and sets each piece within his furry
 ears.

>kill snake
 (with the killing knife)
 The snake squeals in an icy indelight!

 You cut the snake to pieces with the killing knife.  You find your
 breathing to be much less constricted.

 The Hare rips open a bit of its flesh, right above the hip, and inserts
 the kidney.

>examine snake
 I don't see any snake here.

>look
 Sandy Circle
    This is naught but a flattened sphere of sand, free from foul
 contaminates.

 The Hare swallows the heart!

>wait
 Time passes...

 The Hare catches up to you, finally, and holds you within its grasp.

 Without turning you around, he speaks softly into your ear...

 "Was not that jolly a scare, eh?  I laughed myself into fits over that
 woman, for I have got a jolly lot of false whiskers and fur in my own
 black bag.  The last job was nice and clean -- I carried away three
 parts of her (conundrum try to find what parts, lo I guess you did).

 I am going to do another on Friday & shall give the johnnies and dons a
 running on and about once more..."

 Its break is hot, it reeks of salted iron, of strong scented sweat.

 Struggles result in only further pressing, and you pass out... and that
 is for the best, for now.

 Sandy Circle
    This is naught but a flattened sphere of sand, free from foul

>go north
 You run, far away from the Hare!

 The eyes of the Hare contract, then immediately bug out in ecstasy.

 "Run, run, run!" it says!  "For now I'm going... to feast on you!"

 The Far End of the Plane
    Twisting through fog, you come to the beginnings of a cavern -- an
 approachable Portal through a rocky hill.  You can enter the cavern to
 the north.

 You look back to see the Hare spin round, as if looking for you.  He
 then freezes; shocked that you are no longer here.

 The Hare is chasing you.

>go north
 You enter the Portal and walk through a very slight, open chasm.  After
 a few feet of this, the Portal opens up and you find yourself within a
 gaping, endlessly high, foul cavern.  Stalagmites rise from the cave's
 floor, but you can see no corresponding rocky growths from above --
 whatever ceiling that is available is shrouded in shimmering light and
 silky vapour.

 The exit is to the north, on the other side of the Portal, that you can
 plainly see.

 Sixty-four squares, arranged in a flat 8 by 8 grid with an alternating
 black and white color scheme are in your way, covering the ground
 between entrance and exit.  You see that a fair number of them -- at
 least a dozen -- are occupied by unmoving figures before more fog
 descends upon you.

 You pause for just a moment and hear echoes of the Hare's voice.

 The Hare is begging you -- desperately pleading with you -- from far
 away to please, please share a square.

 Black Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is black.

 Paths lead east and west.

 To the north is an inanimate render of a warrior footsman.

 The Hare rushes at you, from far away, but is knocked down by something
 in the fog!

>go north
 Footsman's Square

 There does not seem to be enough space for both you and the footsman on
 the square.  The footsman moves in flashes -- you see static images in
 a strobe effect of it attempting to move backwards, and to the side,
 but it cannot.

 Out of desperation for its own self, the footsman buries its pike into
 your chest.  You fall into a crumpled, broken heap upon the slick tile.

 You spot the Hare, for just a moment, but he is far behind you.

>go east
 Black Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is black.

 Paths lead north, east and west.

 The Hare twitches loudly -- you pinpoint his location, and he is far
 away.

>go north
 Fog concealing the Portal to the far side shifts for a moment.
 Fragments of images play upon the revealed backdrop.  A timeslash of
 your father arriving home, removing his tie -- up only for a moment.
 It cuts away to your mother mixing paint.  Your parents meet, embrace.
 Your father paints a red clown's nose upon your mother, she letters,
 slowly, 'MINE' upon your father's body, a clever smirk upon her lips...
 you see them laugh, you see them simply enjoying the company of one
 another and play before the fog returns anew and all images fade.

 White Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is white.

 Paths lead north, east and south.

 To the west is an inanimate render of a warrior footsman.

 The Hare mewls just for a bit, but long enough for you to place his
 position... and it is not very close.

>go north
 You see a static scene in the swirling fog -- your father striking a
 small projectile straight on.  The fog morphs to a second, animated,
 scene: a ball ripping through the heart of a foul beast.

 You can hear the Hare yell in pain to the south, and turn to look
 briefly back.

 You are unable to find the Hare, and returning your view to the north,
 you see that the fog is no longer forming moving pictures.

 Black Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is black.

 Paths lead north, south, east and west.

 The Hare brushes away fog in an attempt to find you.  He is several
 squares away.

>go north
 Appearing directly before you is a phantom of your mother, no more than
 a shimmering curtain of light.  Her eyes are cast downwards to her
 belly, where you still grow.

 "You can't possibly want another one," she says softly.

 BUT MOTHER I CAN!

 The scene resets, it plays again.

 "You can't possibly want another one," she says softly.

 I'M NOT A BUTCHER!

 The scene resets one final time, and again it plays.

 "You can't possibly want another one," she says softly.

 CUT, IN HARE TOMB!  CUT, IN HARE TOMB!

 The words struggle to find audience, none seems apparent.

 The phantom of light switches quickly into the ether, the nothingness.

 White Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is white.

 Paths lead west and south.

 To the north is an inanimate render of a warrior footsman.

 A towering, foreboding castle is to the east.

 The Hare pops up from the fog for a moment, luckily he is nowhere near
 you.

>go east
 The Castle's Square

 The castle topples!

 The castle falls upon you, crushing you underneath tons of thick,
 horrible stone!

 Paths lead north, south, east and west.

 You hear nothing, now, out of the ordinary.

>go north
 The white squares (all but yours) rise up from the floor.  Fog smears
 upon the tiles to form depth, and you see a the slight outline of a
 snowing man.  The tiles shift to form the symbol for a 'heart' before
 violently falling back where they were, upon the ground.

 White Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is white.

 The Hare has apparently lost your trail.

>go north
 A pretty, spectacled nurse, seemingly whole and real, arrives from
 behind and places two fingers against the pulse in your neck.  Alarmed,
 she runs away to the north, rapidly shunting herself into and out of
 your reality...

 Black Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is black.

 Paths lead north, east and south.

 Shimmering, majestic light sprays outwards in a rainbow of colors from
 the statue of the cruel overlord to the west.

 Everything seems still.  Not too still... no, simply a perfect,
 tranquil still.

>go west
 King's Square

 The lion comes to life.

 He gently picks you up and places you ontop of his broad shoulders.
 With a powerful, musical keen he shakes away the exterior to the
 cavern.  Various other statues crumble into dust.  He begins a slight
 trot -- on air itself! -- and carries you up, into the air, through
 swirling, purple clouds, into a kingdom only of love, free from any
 kind of want.

 And it is all you ever know.

 Shimmering, majestic light sprays outwards in a rainbow of colors from

>go north
 The fog is brighter, now.  It forms grayscaled sights of a man, a
 healer, at least a decade older than your own father, bringing down a
 terrible demon with a wave of his hands... he fells wave after wave of
 similar horrors in what seems no time at all before dropping dead as he
 first locks eyes with a biting, clawing, fatted jabberwocky...

 White Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is white.

 Paths lead south, east and west.

 To the north is a mild statue, depicting a sneering, bookish,
 fundamentalist.

 You sniff the air, for just a trace of the Hare... but detect nothing.

>go north
 Overlord's Square

 You attempt to enter the square that the overlord has already claimed.

 The statue makes no sound.  It does not engage in motion.  Nothing
 supernatural happens in the least.

 ... which does nothing to alleviate the shock of your death.

 Shimmering, majestic light sprays outwards in a rainbow of colors from

 You cannot see the Hare, but you can detect his scent -- he is not
 particularly far away, of course, but he did just seem to get closer.

>go north
 And you feel so close!  And your body feels so warm, your blood so full
 of vibrant life!  And the fog draws back like a commanded curtain;
 seven and six men are revealed!  And they wave their hands in menacing
 manner, so aloof of this world.

 Three earthly organs make up their sacrifice -- a scanned ultrasound in
 the center of their circle.  One holds a gleaming, leathered sphere of
 his own, scratching notes upon it, as a chanting jack builds from the
 others into a gushing crescendo.

 The orb is cast from their circle, and the fog is gone forever.

 The Portal is now before you, one step to the north.

 White Square
    You have moved onto a square.  It is white.

 Paths lead north, west and south.

 To the east is an inanimate render of a warrior footsman.

 The Hare spots you!  He's coming closer!

>go north
 Far Side of the Portal
    You take the final step off the layer of tiles and onto the far
 Portal side.

 The Hare begins to wail:  a shivering, desperate keen fueled by its
 horrible capacity for the hunt.  It has failed, it has lost.  It begins
 tearing fur from its body in thick clumps and patches, throwing them
 helter-skelter around the tiles, until the craggy flesh beneath is
 revealed.

 With a moaning sound of 'o' it hunches over, falls to one knee, and
 sets a sliding hand out in a vain attempt to keep itself from knocking
 against the polished tile... it collapses and makes no further
 movement.

 The Portal continues here, into nothingness.

>go north
 You float about in that direction for a little bit, but are drawn
 against your will to this very spot.

 You take leave and jump yourself into the Portal.  You feel a light

 Operating Room

 "She's going to -- I think that, yes..." says the Doctor.

 The nurse adjusts her frames and peers onto the operating table.  "Oh,
 my, look at her neck -- "

 "It just split, I barely touched it with the scalpel," whispers the
 Doctor.  "Never quite... well, fortunate, nonetheless."  He gently
 brings the baby up and lifts away the umbilical cord.  He motions over
 to you.

 You break out of your stunned stupor and shamble over to the operating
 table.

 "Mr. Scott," says the Doctor, "I think that both your wife and the baby
 are going to be alright after all..."  He seems temporarily distant to
 you, what with his deep sweating and cool demeanor.

 "Everything is... everything is okay?" you ask.

 "Kieron -- it's Kieron, correct?"  You nod.  "I have to say it was
 touch and go there for a while, I wasn't particularly optimistic..."
 his voice softens to a near mumble, as he studies one edge of the
 umbilical cord.  "And it certainly wasn't a break, I don't think, it
 was so smooth if so, and..." the doctor sees you fretting again and
 displays a hearty, genuine smile.

 "Congratulations," he says.  "It's a girl."

 You cradle your still-unconscious wife in your arms with your little
 baby girl by her side for just a moment before the nurse begs you away
 so that Charlise can get her stitches.  Charlise is going to be so
 happy when she recovers, you think.

 You look upon your daughter, Tessa Elizabeth Scott, seven pounds six
 ounces.  Has her mother's eyes alright, and a few stringy wisps of
 yellow hair.  And right before she, too, is whisked away so they can
 ensure that she is going to be alright, you swear to yourself that in
 between catches of newfound tears you see her sigh contentedly for what
 seems like ever, smile knowingly and let out a tiny, ecstatic squeal.

 Clearing
    Fine, powdery dust and shards make up a solid foundation for this
 out-of-the-way little vortex in the forest.  The clearing is in the
 shape of an oval, and twenty yards across.
    Roaf and Oaf are waddling about.

>choose oaf
 "Delightful," muses Roaf.

 Roaf thrusts himself over toward Oaf and knocks him into the ground.
 He strikes, quick as a cobra, and sits atop him, his teeth gnawing and
 biting away chunks of Oaf's face.  He rips shredded specks of skin and
 flesh and spits them out to one side.

 Oaf howls, a cry more of defeated agony than that of rage or directed
 anger.

 Roaf finishes his meal.  Ultimately, not a scrap of Oaf remains.

 His hunger unsatiated, he then jumps on you and continues to enjoy his
 repast.

 Alley
    A filthy place, mongrels and predators scurry and skulk about the
 edges of your vision, seemingly self-satisfied in their hidden snark
 just beyond your focus.

 The alley wall behind you rises until it seems that you shall never
 grow tall enough to surpass it.  It melts away in its own acclivity,
 merging into a starless night.  Walls to both sides reflect a build of
 age and accompanying deterioration.  Your skin crawls with the
 sensations of spying from some things, some group of denizens choosing
 themselves to be, as of yet, unrevealed.

 Fogging spoils your far sight to the west, while it reveals your sole
 path for this continued evening venture.
