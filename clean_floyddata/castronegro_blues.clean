 You listen to the dame on the other end of the phone as she finishes
 her plight.  "My brother has gone missing.  I want you to find him."
 You promised yourself a vacation, but this broad sounds a bit dishy.
 Maybe one more case before your vacation won't be too much of a
 bother. . .

 This is your office.  It's not that tidy, but it <span class="floydstyle em">is</span>
 presentable.  You have a desk, its accompanying chair, and a file
 cabinet.  A large window looks out onto the city.  Across the office
 from the window is your office door; to the south.  A second chair is
 set for clients on the other side of the desk.  The only luxury you've
 allowed yourself is an old phonograph that you've set up in the

 On the desk are an ashtray and a telephone.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hello Sailor!" Sung by Ella Dietrich</span>

 There is a knock on the door but the knocker doesn't wait for an
 answer.  The door opens and a beautiful woman walks in.  "Thank you
 for seeing me, detective."  You invite her to sit and she does.

>ask her about her

 I'm not sure what "her" refers to.

>ask woman about her

 "I don't know much about her."

>ask woman about woman

 "I don't know much about woman."

 Claudine Lane begins telling you about her case.  "My brother, David,
 has gone missing in Silver City, New Mexico."

>examine woman

 She is classy, blonde, and stacked like a brick shit-house.

 Claudine continues, "David had been staying in Albuquerque for some
 time.  He planned to visit a small town called Castronegro to
 investigate some strange rumors he had gotten from local Apaches."

>ask woman about apaches

 "David was in contact with the local Apaches in New Mexico.  He was a
 scholar of ancient lore and rituals.  It was rumors he got from them
 that lead him to try to get to Castronegro, but for what reason, I
 don't know."

 Looking out the window, Ms. Lane continues, "In his letters, he was
 excited about something he called <span class="floydstyle em">reverse evolution</span> and the
 occult."

>ask woman abask woman l

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>ask woman about reverse evolution

 "I have no idea what David meant by that phrase."

 Claudine goes on, "On the way to Castronegro, he planned to stay for a
 couple of weeks in Silver City, to see a friend of his named Adam
 Little."

>ask woman about little

 "I don't know him.  I just know he was a colleague of David's.
 Perhaps more can be found out about him in Silver City."

 Claudine Lane tells you, "I will pay your expenses to travel to New
 Mexico to find my brother.  You were referred to me by Mrs. Timmons.
 She said you brought her closure regarding her son, Brian."

 You agree, of course, and Claudine leaves some papers on your desk and
 walks out of your office.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Dead Cattle Puzzle Continues</span><span class="floydstyle em">  In the most recent chapter of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the continuing mystery of the New Mexican cattle killings, rancher</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Charles Dexter lost 92 cattle between the 8th and 19th of September</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">here on his ranch by the isolated town of Castronegro.  This has been</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the largest single loss ever attributed to the unseen "Cattle</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Butchers".</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">The cattle were found scattered across Mr. Dexter's ranch, all</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">with their tongues bodily torn out and frequently other signs of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">violence.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mr. Dexter has been so affected by this grim occurrence that he</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">has sold his ranch and moved to Europe.  Before leaving, he stated, "I</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">have a mighty good notion as to who's been slaughtering my herd.  I am</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">not a cowardly man, but I have no desire at all to mess with them.  I</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">am leaving this place for good."  Mr. Dexter went on to say that his</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">move had been planned for some months, but the recent catastrophe</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">spurred him to move immediately.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">For the last two years, occasional mysterious cattle mutilations</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">have been occurring on the local ranches, but generally no more than</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">one or two cows have been killed in a month.  This newest occurrence</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sheriff's Office</span>
 This is a sheriff's office that almost harkens back to the style of
 the Old West.  Doors to offices are in each wall except the south wall
 which is the door back outside.  A counter sits facing the south door.

 Behind the counter, a sour-faced seargent eyes you guardedly.

>talk to seargent

 "You wanna talk to the sherf?"
>yes
 "You wanna talk to the sherf?"

 The seargent knocks on one of the office doors and the sheriff comes
 out.

 The sheriff eyes you up, clearly annoyed.  "What is it I can help you
 with?  I'm busier than a hooker on a cowboy's birthday."

>tell him about casual misogyny

 "Interesting."

 You explain that you are investigating the disappearances, having been
 hired by David Lane's sister.  "Yeah, we do believe foul play was
 involved.", he says.

>TELL HIM THAT I KILLED THEM ALL

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>ask sheriff about foul play

 "Pay attention, boy, I'm talking to you."

 The sheriff continues, "We found tracks in the dust outside Lane's
 window at the boarding house.  This was after his disappearance
 a'course."

>wait

 Time passes.

 The sheriff says "One pair of prints were shoes of the same size as
 Lane's; another pair were thick boots with a cross imprint on the
 heels; a third and final pair of prints were large bare footprints."

>ask him about his own boots

 "Pay attention, boy, I'm talking to you."

 The sheriff paces around as he continues to tell you what the police
 know, "Neighbors of Lane reported seeing two strange characters
 loitering on Hyde street all day on September 17th.  Both had dark
 hair, bad teeth, sallow complexions, and were dressed in ill-fitting
 coarse clothing.  One wore a pair of heavy leather boots."

>wait

 Time passes.

 You ask about the other missing persons, Dr. William Godfrey and
 Joaquin Vilheila-Pereira.  The sheriff consults some notes by the
 counter.

>wait

 Time passes.

 He tells you what the Silver City police know, "Dr. Godfrey traveled
 to Silver City three times during the two months before his
 disappearance, each time with a fortnight layover.

>wait

 Time passes.

 "The last time he stopped over at a friend's house the night before he
 left, and his friends saw him to the station in the morning,
 confirming his departure."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "However, he did not arrive in Albuquerque that night.  His landlady
 called the police two days later."

>wait

 Time passes.

 You ask about the final missing person, Joaquin Vilheila-Pereira.  The
 sheriff doesn't have much to say, "All of his belongings from the
 hotel he was stayin" at were taken by his family.  He was remembered
 as being a furtive young man with a pale complexion, bright green
 eyes, and black hair.  His things were picked up by his uncle, Philip
 Vilheila-Pareira, a tall man, mid 30s, green eyes and black hair."

>wait

 Time passes.

 The sheriff looks at you sternly, "Anything else?  No?  Good.", and
 with that, he walks back into his office.

 There are several articles bundled in the scrapbook, all dealing with
 the town of Castronegro and all dating back over thirty years.  The
 articles report the mysterious disappearance of infants from the
 Castronegro area.  At first, these disappearances were attributed to
 the still-unpacified Apaches nearby, but gradually the vanishings were
 just left as a mystery.  One other article tells the story of the
 disappearance of a Castronegro man visiting Albuquerque in 1892; a
 case similar to that of Joaquin Vileila-Pareia.  The other articles
 are dated 1890, 1898, 1902, and 1918.  In the 1898 article, a
 Castronegro man named Bernardo Diaz is named as a prime suspect, but
 there is no information as to whether or not he was ever arrested.

 The final article seems to be just general information about
 Castronegro.  It reads as follows:

 <span class="floydstyle em">Castronegro is a small New Mexican town, located about 40 miles</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">north of Silver City.  It was founded in 1680 by a wealthy Spanish</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">nobleman named Bernardo de Diaz.  He led his family and another</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">family, the Vilheila-Pareiras, there from Spain.  The town's original</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">name was Agua Blanca, changed later to Castronegro early in the 18th</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">centry, for an unknown reason.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">In 1728, during the Inquisition's suppression of Madrid</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Freemasonry, many Spanish refugees fled to Castronegro.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Castronegro is much as it was when first founded over 200 years</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">ago.  It has a population of about 600, and the town's only tie with</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the outisde world is the weekly bus from Silver City, as phone lines</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">have not yet been installed.  It is a scenic example of Spanish</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bus Stop</span>
 As the bus driver drops you off at the edge of this sleepy town, he
 points to the north to a largish building built upon a foothill about
 a half mile from town.  He tells you it is Casa de Diaz and inside is
 the reason this town has so few visitors.  The man who lives there is
 Bernardo Diaz VI, a direct descendant of Bernardo de Diaz who founded
 the original town.  He tells you that Bernardo doesn't care for
 strangers and then the bus driver drives off.

 This is the only bus stop in town and it sits at the town's edge.  To
 the west, the road leads out of town and to the east is the rest of
 Castronegro.  To the south is the Herrera Hotel; its sign dangling
 lazily from the door like a warm dog's gonad.

 You can see a sign here.

 This is the lobby where the front desk greets the guest.  A lounge is
 to the east and stairs lead upward to the rooms.  A door is set into
 the west wall.

 You casually make conversation in order to ask if, as the hotel
 manager, he's heard of David Lane or even the other two missing

 Thank you for playing <span class="floydstyle em">Castronegro Blues</span>.  This game is based
 on the scenario <span class="floydstyle em">The Secret of Castronegro</span> by Sandy Petersen
 and Mark Pettigrew for the Call of Cthulhu(tm) RPG by Chaosium Inc.
 The cover photograph is by Drew Medina.  My playtesters were Syman
 Weed & Geoff "mostly useless" Moore, but any mistakes or issues you
 encounter are, of course, solely the fault of all the pot I smoked
 while implementing this game.  Also, please type "help" for more
 information!  Have fun!

>help

 Thank you for playing <span class="floydstyle em">Castronegro Blues</span>.  There are a small
 handul of new actions available in this game.  To shoot a person (or
 horrid nethercreature, for example), simply type "shoot {thing}", but
 be sure you have your revolver handy!  You can also "break
 {something}" which attempts to break something with your bare hands.
 You can also try "break {something} with {something else}", if you
 think you need to do so.  You're a detective so be sure to "talk to
 {person}" whenever you want information.  As a secondary tactic, you
 can "ask {person} about {something}", but "talk to" is most important
 in this game.  Finally, you may want to "show {something} to
 {someone}" if you think it will get you what you need.

 Also type "credits" for more information!  Have fun!

 It is easy to find the same history of Castronegro that you found in
 the archive in Silver City, but in this library, you find a history
 from before the town was settled.

 Much is conjecture, and there are few real facts, but you read about a
 tribe of Native Americans evidently unrelated to the nearby Apaches,
 Comanches, Zuni, and Navajo, which dwelt in the area until a few
 decades before the Spanish arrival.

 This tribe raised at least one stone monolith and the names of their
 gods were retained for hundred of years by the nieghboring tribed as a
 curse.  These gods were called Niurab and Yohoso.

 Evidently, the tribe was wiped out by the Navajo around 1650.  The
 tribe left behind few relics, but a few of their stones can still be
 found in the rough hills around Castronegro.
 found in the rough hills around Castronegro.You also find a family
 lineage history of Castronegro.  The most interesting parts here are
 the family trees of the de Diaz and Vilheila-Pareira families, which
 can be traced back to the original settlement in 1680.

 Although other families have arrived since, it is evident that the
 Diaz and Vilheila-Pareira population makes up about one third of the
 town's inhabitants.
 town's inhabitants.

 Then, you read something interesting.  It seems that every forty
 years, from 1730 on, a new Bernardo Diaz is listed as being born (e.g.
 Bernardo Diaz II was born in 1731, Bernardo III was born in 1769,
 Bernardo IV in 1812, Bernardo V in 1850, and the current Bernardo VI
 in 1891).

 About twenty years after each new Bernardo was born, his predecessor
 died.  The current Bernardo Diaz would be a little over thirty years
 old.  The former Bernardo Diaz died in 1910.
 old.  The former Bernardo Diaz died in 1910.Finally, you find two
 gruesome reports.  One is a listing of missing infants reported over
 the last 100 years in Castronegro and nearby towns.  Containing much
 hearsay, it states that at least 200 infants are reported as
 disappearing.  This does not take into account any unreported
 children, as from Native families.

 The final report is on cattle deaths.  Cattle killings started within
 the last six years and have continued at the rate of  one or two cows
 per month for every large spread in southwest New Mexico, except for
 Charles Dexter; mentioned in the article Claudine Lane gave you.

 the west, the road leads out of town and to the east is the rest of
 Castronegro.  To the south is the Herrera Hotel; its sign dangling
 lazily from the door like a warm dog's gonad.

 You can see a sign here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 The Herrera Hotel is the only place to stay in Castronegro.  It is an
 old adobe building, at least a hundred years old, with two stories.
 This is the lobby where the front desk greets the guest.  A lounge is
 to the east and stairs lead upward to the rooms.  A door is set into
 the west wall.

 Tidying the place, (in a futile attempt at atmosphere) is the hotel's
 owner, Juan Herrera.

 This is the town's speakeasy.  The casual atmosphere makes you wonder
 if any law enforcement has ever cared to swing into Castronegro.  A
 lazy overhead fan does nothing to stir the still air in here which
 smells of stale beer and body odor.  The door back to the street is
 east.  A radio sits in the corner.

 Tending bar is the owner, Gilberto Diaz.

 James Whitlock sits in the shadows, drunk.

 Crackling through static on the radio, you hear, "A tornado in Lorain,
 Ohio has killed 78 people. . ."

 Gilberto wipes down the tables.

>talk to gilberto

 Maybe you should ask or tell about more specific topics.

 Crackling through static on the radio, you hear, "German serial killer
 Fritz Haarmann has been sentenced to death. . ."

 Gilberto wipes down the bar.

>ask gilberto about vault

 "I don't know much about vault."

 Crackling through static on the radio, you hear, "A Soviet-backed coup
 attempt has failed in Estonia. . ."

 Gilberto eyes you blankly.

>ask gilberto about farms

 "I don't know much about farms."

 Crackling through static on the radio, you hear, "Nellie Taylor Ross
 of Wyoming has been elected as the U.S.'s first woman governor. . ."

 Gilberto pours another drink for James.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Chapel</span>
 Inside the chapel, it is eerie and silent.  It seems that the locals
 do not frequent it much.  The door to the street outside is to the

 In the center of this chamber is a rather horrible statue carved from
 basalt.

 Reading in the back of the chapel is Father Alonso Vilheila-Pareira.

 You can also see Liana Farnham, Grover Cotterell and Clarinda Fisch

 Liana adjusts her wig.

 Clarinda eyes you flirtatiously.

 "That doesn't look like an ordinary sickle.  In fact, I've heard of
 enchanted sickles around these parts that can not only break bones,

 sight is very bad.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 The Herrera Hotel is the only place to stay in Castronegro.  It is an
 old adobe building, at least a hundred years old, with two stories.
 This is the lobby where the front desk greets the guest.  A lounge is
 to the east and stairs lead upward to the rooms.  A door is set into
 the west wall.

 Organizing some paperwork (in a futile attempt at professionalism) is
 the hotel's owner, Juan Herrera.

 Crackling through static on the radio, you hear, "German serial killer

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vilheila-Pareira Tobacco Shop</span>
 This is a small store run by Philip Vilheila-Pereira, the uncle of
 Joaquin Vilheila-Pereira, one of the missing persons.  Barrels of
 tobacco are the only furnishings in this place.  The door to the
 street is to the southwest.

 Keeping watch over his store is Philip himself.  He eyes you
 cautiously.

 You can also see Orion Skinner and Tate Walczak here.

 Philip eyes you suspiciously.

 Orion Skinner goes southwest.

 Tate checks a map and looks around, confused.

>examine barrels

 There are about a dozen barrels of pure tobacco here.

 Philip sticks his head into a barrel and breathes deeply the tobacco
 fumes.

 Tate scratches his head.

>search barrels

 You make a motion as if examining the fine strains of tobacco, but you
 really take a good search around and inside the barrels as best you
 can.

 Sure enough, you find a crude wooden pipe which you deftly pocket.

 Philip inspects his wares.

 Tate scratches his head.

>examine pipe

 It is a simple, functional pipe carved hastily from a small chunk of
 wood.  It appears to have been used at least a few times.  It smells
 of tobacco.

 Philip looks around his establishment, clearly pleased with himself.

 Tate looks to the north.

>show pipe to philip

 Philip mumbles something about not being able to find his pipe.

 Casa De Diaz, the home of Bernardo Diaz VI, is to the north.  The
 front door; an iron grate.  The house is a stone horror but seems to
 once have been influenced greatly by Spanish architecture.  However,
 the place is in bad disrepair; as if it's been abandoned for some

 What passes for a town park can be reached to the south.  You can also
 see the chapel in that direction.  One of the roads that lead out of
 town, into the hills, is to the north.  You can cross the street to
 the southwest.

 The sound of a bus engine can be heard in the distance.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Road to the Hills</span>
 This is a dusty road that leads south to Castronegro and north into
 the hills.  The sun's heat causes you to sweat furiously here.

 Vultures circle above you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steep Hill</span>
 The road through the hills meanders north to south here, but a steep
 hill exists to the northwest wherein a vault door hides a half-buried
 mausoleum.

 Strange noises echo around you.

 You can't go that way.

 Vultures circle above you.

 Dust swirls about and gets into your eyes.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Hills</span>
 This road winds through the hills.  Thankfully, there is some shade
 among these badlands.  The path leads both northeast and south.

 The sun beats down on you despite the season.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden de Diaz</span>
 This once was a garden, but now everything is dust and decay.  The
 flowerpots hold only dirt and dead vines cover almost everything.
 Casa De Diaz, the home of Bernardo Diaz VI, is to the north.  The
 front door; an iron grate.  The house is a stone horror but seems to
 once have been influenced greatly by Spanish architecture.  However,
 the place is in bad disrepair; as if it's been abandoned for some
 years or even decades.  The path through the hills and back to
 Castronegro lies to the southwest.

 A chill wind blows; the only sign of winter you've felt here.

>go north

 The sun sets as you enter Casa de Diaz.

 (first opening the iron door)
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance Hall</span>
 This is a central area connecting most of the ground floor rooms.  It
 is carpeted with a ratty, old rug; evidently of Oriental design.  The
 walls are decorated with portraits of various prominent Diaz and
 Vilheila-Pareira family members.  Doors lead north, south, east, and
 west, and the hall continues to the northwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Downstairs Hall</span>
 This is deep within the bowels of Casa de Diaz.  The hall stretches to
 the southeast.  Doors sit in the northeast, east, and south walls and
 a doorway leads open to the north.  A narrow staircase leads upwards.
 Everything is covered with a thick layer of dust.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upstairs Hall</span>
 This is a dark, dusty hall upstairs in Casa de Diaz.  Doors lead west
 and south.  Rickety stairs lead back down to the first floor from
 here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guest Bedroom</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 This may very well be the sleeping chamber of Bernardo Diaz VI; for
 you can't imagine who else would call this bedroom his.  A large,
 canopied bed dominates the room and a dresser is squeezed in as well.
 The door is to the north.

 The dining table is a large wooden monstrosity and the tablecloth is
 purple velvet.  This room is, obviously, the dining room, however, it
 is also the only room on this floor that appears to recently have been
 used.  The tracks in the dust lead around the table and to the door in

 It is a portrait of Bernardo de Diaz. . .or is it one of his

 a deformed rat or marmoset seemingly whispering in his ear.  The

 which, even when your meager flashlight beam is turned away, seems to
 gleam or flash with a dim light of its own.

 "Don't look at me quizically.", you tell him, "David Lane disappeared
 and I'm sure as shit your little cult has something to do with it."

>ask diaz about lane

 "I don't know much about lane."

 Bernardo rolls his eyes and smiles, telling you all you need to know:
 David Lane is dead at the hands of the cult of Castronegro.

>ask diaz about cult

 "I don't know much about cult."

>shoot diaz

 With what, idiot?  You're not holding your revolver.

>search contraptions

 The only thing you spy of immediate use is a cigar lighter which you
 quickly pocket.

>take revolver

 (putting the train ticket into the trenchcoat to make room)
 You're carrying too many things already.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a cigar lighter
   a silver chalice
   a lab key
   a skeleton key
   the broken spectacles
   a black robe (being worn)
   a flashlight (providing light)
   a fedora (being worn)
   a set of clothes (being worn)

>drop skeleton key

 Dropped.

>take revolver

 You take the revolver from the trenchcoat.

>shoot diaz

 You fire several shots at the cult leader but the slugs bounce off his
 skin as if it were enchanted with magical armor.  Bernardo simply
 laughs at you.

>use lighten on diaz

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>use lighter on diaz

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>burn diaz

 This dangerous act would achieve little.

>switch lighter on

 You switch the cigar lighter on.

 A meager flame emits from your cigar lighter but it's not enough by

>attack diaz with sickle

 (first taking the sickle)
 (putting the broken spectacles into the trenchcoat to make room)
 You move to attack the cult leader but he swiftly moves out of your
 way.  As you stumble forward from your clumsy lunge, he sinks a
 ceremonial dagger deep into your back.

 Standing among the other odd things is Bernardo Diaz VI.  Or is it the
