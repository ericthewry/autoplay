 You feel as though you've been staring hard at something for a long
 time, yet have suddenly gotten lost.

 Your eyes are weary, and your legs are stiff.

 Not remembering how you arrived here, near a large park on the river
 Seine, you nevertheless decide to take in the scenery and explore a
 bit.

 La Seine
 A short text adventure by Derek Sutcliffe
 Release 1 / Serial number 090320 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Pr?s du parc
 You're standing on a gently sloping hill near a popular Parisian park.
 To the north you can see lots of people enjoying the summer day. Those
 without parasols sit in the shade of beautiful green trees, and in
 light of the way you're feeling, you might want to follow their lead.
 It's slightly after noon and the sun is beating down on you.

 A discarded newspaper lies at your feet.

>examine me
 You're you. Just an innocent tourist trying to broaden your horizons.

>xyzzy
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take newspaper
 Taken.

>examine it
 Your French isn't great, but even you notice that something is strange
 about the paper. Aha, there it is. "La Presse - dimanche 20 juillet
 1884." Yeah, it's pretty old. From the various headings, you can tell
 there are articles on neo-impressionism, champagne, and optometry.
 Unfortunately, your grammar doesn't match your stunning ability to
 recognize simple cognates, so you're unable to read the articles
 themselves.
>read newspaper

 It's all Greek to you. Er, French.

>examine me
 You're you. Just an innocent tourist trying to broaden your horizons.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a newspaper

>go north

 Avec le singe
 It's nice and shady here. An upper-class Frenchwoman and her male
 companion (complete with monocle, top hat, and riding crop) are
 standing here, staring off to the west. The river does look nice, but
 the persistence of their gaze is unnerving. You can see a woman
 knitting to the west and a girl holding a bouquet to the north.

 A small brown dog is here, terrorizing a skinny little monkey on a
 leash. The monkey's owners don't seem to notice.

 A speckled brown dog wearing a pink bow. Its owner doesn't seem to be

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine woman
 She has a parasol and a pet monkey on a leash. Also, she has a big,
 round butt. It can't be real. She must be using... Uh, what's it
 called... A bustle? Anyway, her dress has wiring in it that makes her
 butt look huge.

 You find nothing of interest.

 You achieve nothing by this.

 PETA wouldn't be happy with you. Try punishing it a little less
 severely.

 The guy looks really stuck-up.

 You give it a swift whack with the newspaper. It's looking pretty
 obedient now.

 I don't suppose the small monkey would care for that.

>talk to woman
 Hm. Doesn't seem interested in talking to you.

>talk to monkey
 You can't talk to animals.

>go west

 Avec la tricoteuse
 A woman sits here knitting a delicate white garment. She appears to be
 accompanied by a mustached man with a top hat and cane who looks
 across the river. Nearby a boatman smokes a pipe and stares out into
 the Seine as well. An unoccupied grassy patch of land lies to the
 north, and to the east you spot an aristocratic couple with a monkey.

 The woman continues to knit here.

 A black dog is here, behind the knitting woman, chewing something.

>examine dog
 You peer closely at the spotty black dog. A pink hat is in his mouth.
 He looks like a rather docile breed, and the knitting woman seems to
 be its owner.

>talk to woman
 Hm. Doesn't seem interested in talking to you.

>talk to boatman
 Hm. Doesn't seem interested in talking to you.

>hit dog with newspaper
 Is that really necessary?

>take hat
 You play a little tug-of-war with the dog before it gives up the hat.
 The dog returns to sniffing grass around the park. Probably looking
 for a place to wee.

>examine hat
 The hat's made of a light pink or lavender fabric, and has two poof
 balls strung to it on either side. It looks like the same material the
 woman nearby was knitting with, albeit a different color.

>wear hat
 You put on the hat.

>examine garment
 You can't see any such thing.

>remove it
 You take off the hat.

>give hat to woman
 The knitting woman looks up from her current task and smiles at you,
 piecing together what must have transpired. "Merci beaucoup. Ce
 chien..." She wags a finger at the dog and returns her hat to its
 proper position at her side.

 Avec un papillon
 There's not much here besides grass. A nice view of the Seine lies to
 your west. There's an obnoxious bugler to the north, and you don't
 like the idea of hearing his warbling tune at a higher volume. Thus,
 you can only go east or south from here.

 A butterfly flaps its spotted wings silently in the air several feet
 off the ground.

 A small bunch of white-flecked flowers grows here.

>get butterfly
 Darn. Though it barely seems to move, it flutters swiftly away each
 time you reach out for it.

 butterfly: Darn. Though it barely seems to move, it flutters swiftly
 away each time you reach out for it.

>examine trees
 They're very tall and slender, with speckled green leaves.

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a bunch of flowers
   a newspaper

 Remarkably still, you could probably grab it right out of the air.

>examine flowers
 This bunch would add to a bouquet nicely, though the flowers look
 rather like plain white dots on their own.

 Darn. Though it barely seems to move, it flutters swiftly away each
 time you reach out for it.

 The butterfly is unimpressed.

 Parmi les fleurs
 There's a girl here, about thirteen years old, arranging flowers.
 There's a finished bouquet next to her, and her mother (or aunt, or
 whatever) sits nearby, gazing at the Seine. Exits are north, toward a
 little girl and her mother, south, where an aristocratic couple walk a
 pet monkey, and west, toward an open field.

>examine girl
 The girl looks at her tiny clump of flowers, arranging and rearranging
 the stems. She doesn't seem to like it much, and it certainly doesn't
 live up to the one by her side.

 Parisians: You'd like to bring this piece of art back with you, but

 Hm. Doesn't seem interested in talking to you.

>examine bouquet
 There's a pretty bouquet of flowers laid here by the girl, but some of
 the buds seem faded. They look fresh-picked, but certain colors just
 have a dingy hue.

 The flower girl is unimpressed.

>give flowers to girl
 She takes the flowers and adds them to her current bunch, smiling.
 "Zank you. Ze yellow..." She pauses, glancing at both her bouquet and
 the grass in the park. "Ze yellow is, how you say, fading..." The girl
 looks appreciatively at the white adornments to her project.

 Devant la petite fille dans blanc
 There's a little girl here, holding her mother's hand. Other people
 are to the north, but there's nothing interesting in that direction,
 so you can only return south from here.

>talk to mother
 Hm. Doesn't seem interested in talking to you.

 About five years old, wearing a white hat and white dress. The little
 girl in white stares at you intently, as if she wants to talk to you.

 You begin to speak to the little girl. "Um..."

 She looks up at you with a blank stare. "Hello. We are grateful for
 your help."

 "Oh," you stammer, "you speak English."

 "Yes," she says, without changing expression.

 "You're just a little kid, though. Don't you live here in Paris? Is
 one of your parents from England or America?"

 "I have learned English from the passers-by who stop to discuss and
 comment amongst themselves. I am always watching. Some others here are
 not so motivated."

 You look around a little. "What do you mean, passers-by? That doesn't
 make any sense. Here in the park, you mean? You learned English from
 tourists? That's impres-"

 "No, in the gallery. Chicago."

 The name of the city sounds familiar. "You mean you live in Chicago?"

 "In America for eighty-four years. In Chicago for seventy-six of
 them."

 "Whaaat? You've got some imagination, kid." You start walking away.

 "Wait," she says. "I am telling you the truth. All you see is merely a
 scene painted one hundred and twenty-five years ago, by a great
 artist. This place is La Grande Jatte, as seen over a century ago by
 Georges Seurat."

 You begin to protest, but now that the thought has been planted into
 your brain, you can't shake it off. Everything's seemed so restricted,
 so static. Things barely move, and everything's got the same texture
 to it. Speckled, spotted, dotted. It's all pointillism. Then you turn
 and stare at the girl's face.

 There's no definition to it. It's just a splotch of color. Her two
 blue eyes are blobs of oil paint. How could you not see this before?

 You have to get out of here.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>get out of here
 I only understood you as far as wanting to get outside.

 A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte

 Georges Seurat, 1884-1886

 Oil on canvas

 207.6 cm x 308 cm (81.7 in x 121.25 in)

>examine painting
 A pet monkey on a leash watches a brown dog at his owner's side. A
 black dog sniffs the grass near a knitting woman, who is busily
 working her needles. A girl clasps a small bouquet of flowers with an
 expression both cheerful and forlorn. And a little girl in white
 stares back at you from the very center of the painting.

 Yes. At this distance, all seems to be in order.

 When I decided to enter EnvComp, I had no idea what setting I was
 going to use. But I thought about it for a while, and knew I wanted a
 slightly deceptive one. A setting the player wouldn't identify
 correctly right away. It was hard to think of a situation like that,
 and eventually I settled on the player being stuck in a painting. It
 seemed like a unique, exciting setting.

 I'm not actually a huge art lover or anything. I determined which
 painting I was going to use by searching the internet for "famous
 paintings," and then picking the first one I recognized. I remembered
 seeing a reproduction of Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of
 La Grande Jatte in my dentist's office when I was a kid. Anyway, I had
 to research its name, author, and history to write the game, because I
 knew very little about it at first.

 I tried to drop as many hints in the painting world as possible,
 hoping that someone familiar with some aspect of the work (its
 characters, its pointillism, its setting, its author, etc.) may think
 to try escaping from it without having to solve any puzzles at all.
 Which is very possible, although the commands available for doing so
 vary depending how many points you have.

 The puzzles were simple to make. The plot, however, was difficult to
 flesh out. Some cultures think that being photographed steals part of
 your soul. Who's to say that the subject of a portrait or landscape
 isn't somehow imbued in the canvas? Somehow, the player character
 enters the dreamlike territory of the painting itself (Maybe it's a
 special ability?) either without realizing it or without remembering
 it. He then wanders about, setting things right in the painting, until
 the little girl in white, the most knowledgeable 'soul' there, tells
 this character.

 The npcs aren't very fleshed out, but my convenient excuse is that
 most of them are literally two-dimensional painting characters, ones
 who have no wish to interact with an outsider anyway. The animals, and
 the few people that do respond to the character, are simply special
 cases.

 Thanks for playing my first game.

 Version 6 - Developed with TADS 3

 [Type 'About' if this is your first time playing.
 Type 'Credits' to see who made this possible.]

 Tree Hollow Village
 This village - your home since birth - sprawls across and up the sides
 of the tree hollow.  Spittle cottages, fungal fields and twig
 farmhouses are set among the knotted wood on all sides, even clinging
 to the roof high above.

 From here you could head in to the Queen's chamber, or out to the
 sunlit world beyond the hollow.

 Close by, a group of your sisters tend to a herd.

>about
 Dead Like Ants is a small game intended for David Fisher's EnvComp -
 an IF competition focusing on unique environments.

 The main directions you'll be using in this game are IN, OUT,
 WIDDERSHINS and SUNWISE (those last two you can abbreviate to W and
 S).  If you're not sure which directions you can move in, type EXITS.
 Similarly, type TOPICS if you're not sure what you can talk about.
 Type INSTRUCTIONS for a more comprehensive list of commands.

 And here's a little pointer: don't think you've lost just because bad
 things happen.

>examine sisters
 Slender, long-limbed women, a lot like yourself, though of all
 different ages.  They wear red overalls.

 eagerly through the air.

>in
 Queen's Chamber
 Not opulent, as you might expect, but twilit and homely.  Simple,
 finely crafted lamps cast a warm glow over the phloem walls.

 Cots line one side of the chamber, each holding a formless, swaddled
 bundle.

 The Queen, your mother, sits elegantly upon her throne.  She meets
 your eye and beckons to you.

>talk to queen
 You clear your throat and curtsy.  "Hello, your highness."

 The Queen smiles benevolently.  "My favourite daughter.  I have a very
 special task for you."

 (You could ask her about the task, her wings, herself, or your
 brothers.)

>ask her about herself
 "You've worked for the village for so many years," you begin, "so
>a task
 selflessly-"

 The Queen stops you with a hand.  "Hush now.  It's you, my daughters,
 who have worked the hardest and most selflessly.  And none more so
 than you in particular."

 You blush at that, though you're certain it's not true.

 You curtsy again nervously.  "What could I possibly do for her
 majesty?"

 The Queen smiles at your enthusiasm, perhaps a little sadly.  "Every
 spring," she says, "five dangerous creatures come to the tree and
 threaten this village.  So I send one of my daughters to negotiate
 with them, and each year they give us no trouble.  This spring, I want
 you to be that daughter."

 You curtsy again from sheer surprise.  "Your majesty!  I would be
 honoured!"

>a creatures
 "What are these five creatures like?" you ask.  "Where will I find
 them?"

 "You'll find them in each of the tree's nearest five branches," the
 Queen says.  "They may seem scary compared to your sisters, but
 they're only up to a little mischief.  Try to help them in any way
 they require."

>a wings
 You stare at the Queen's wings, uncertain how to raise the topic.

 "I wasn't born with them," she says, picking up on your interest.  "I
 earned them by fulfilling a task for my own mother, long ago.  Who
 knows - perhaps when you get back from the outside there will be a
 pair waiting just for you."

 You blush bright red.  You'd love to have a pair of wings like those.

>a queen
 "You've worked for the village for so many years," you begin, "so
 selflessly-"

 The Queen stops you with a hand.  "Hush now.  It's you, my daughters,
 who have worked the hardest and most selflessly.  And none more so
 than you in particular."

 You blush at that, though you're certain it's not true.

>brothers
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>a brothers
 "How are my brothers?" you ask, carefully.

 The Queen sighs.  "They are at... a difficult age.  But in time they
 will mature and come into their own."

 She smiles at the little bundles, and you feel a sharp pang of
 jealousy.

>topics
 You could ask her about the task, her wings, the five creatures,
 herself, or your brothers.

>out
 You curtsy before you leave.

 "Good luck," the Queen says, "my favourite daughter."

 Tree Hollow Village
 This village - your home since birth - sprawls across and up the sides
 of the tree hollow.  Spittle cottages, fungal fields and twig
 farmhouses are set among the knotted wood on all sides, even clinging
 to the roof high above.

 From here you could head in to the Queen's chamber, or out to the
 sunlit world beyond the hollow.

 Close by, a group of your sisters tend to a herd.

>out
 Bejewelled Branch
 The fertile brown bark of the tree stretches in all directions: up
 into the blue sky, down to the exotic green jungle, and curving around
 on itself both sunwise and widdershins.

 The entrance to the Tree Hollow Village is set into the bark here.
 Just below it, a sturdy old branch stretches out into the distance,
 splitting into three smaller branches.  Suspended magically between
 the three branch-tips is a pulsating whorl of bright colour.

 One of your sisters lies curled up in the furrowed bark, dead.

>examine sister
 Little more than a dried out husk now, she must have passed on some
 time ago.

>eat her
 Your sister does not appear to be edible.

>exits all
 The list of exits will now be shown in both the status line and in
 each room description.

>examine whorl
 Your faceted eyes struggle to make it out in any detail.  A spiral of
 flickering colour seems to dance in time with the wind.

>touch whorl
 The whorl of colour is too far away.

>go down
 This tree is a huge enough world in itself.  Leaving it seems
 pointlessly suicidal.

>go up
 Highest Branch
 You cover your mouth and swear.  Holy shit.

 Your eyes have never been that good over long distances, and this has
 got to be the longest distance you've ever seen.  The green jungle
 stretches off to the horizon - something you had always thought a myth
 - where a jumble of strange shapes seem frozen in the act of rearing
 up into the sky.

 Tall, green-topped structures stand in a great cluster around the tree
 that you call home.  They can't be other trees, surely?

 Obvious exits: Down

>examine shapes
 You haven't the faintest clue what they might be.  All you can tell is
 that they're enormous, and so far away that you find it difficult to
 conceive of the distance.

>examine horizon
 Stunning.  Confusing to look at.  Do the land and sky stretch on
 forever in parallel?  Do they meet at the horizon?  Or is it something
 else even harder to understand?

>fly
 The word "fly" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points
 out an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your
 next command.)

 It's the strangest thing, but neither you nor any of your sisters can
 get all your feet off the ground at the same time.

 Branch Tip, Beneath the Rainbow Net
 Someone has stretched a vast net from the tip of this branch to the
 tips of two others high overhead - an impressive feat, to say the
 least.  Flurries of blossom sail past on the wind, catching in the net
 and painting it bright, quivering colours.

 A solitary black figure stands in the centre of the net above.

 Obvious exits: Up, In

>examine blossom
 Hundreds of colourful petals float past on the wind.  Those that have
 become trapped in the net above tremble in the breeze.

>examine net
 Exactly what purpose it serves, beyond collecting blossom, you can't
 ascertain.

>go up
 You set your feet on the net.  You have a natural aptitude for walking
 at all angles, but it helps that the net happens to be quite sticky.

 Centre of the Rainbow Net
 From here, thin threads of silk extend in every direction, weaving a
 circular net in the air that catches delicate petals of blossom.  The
 net seems remarkably sturdy, for something so insubstantial, and
 you're confident you can get down from here with ease.

 A tall, pale widow stands in the centre of the net, watching her
 threads with keen interest.

 Obvious exits: Down

>examine widow
 A tall, pale woman: slender and long-limbed, clothed in a flowing
 black dress.  There's an icy, elegant beauty to her that almost takes
 your breath away.

 Her eight eyes watch the world from behind a black lace veil that
 stops just above her voluptuous red lips.

>talk to woman
 "Um," you begin, "excuse me..."

 The widow turns to face you and smiles broadly.  "One of the Queen's
 little darlings!  What a pleasure to meet you."

 She leans forwards to kiss you and, surprised, you step back.

 "You poor creature," she says.  "You needn't be frightened of me.  I'm
 just a lovelorn woman with a penchant for bright blossom."

 (You could ask her about her husband, kissing, the net, the Queen, or
 the tree.)

>a blossom
 "And to think," the widow interrupts, smiling, "that your pretty
 little head has so many words in it."

>a net
 "This net is quite a feat of engineering," you say, hoping to talk
 shop.

 "Darling," the widow says, "all I know is that it lets me catch some
 colourful blossom to ameliorate my view.  The construction nous seems
 to come quite effortlessly to me, and I prefer not to think about it
 too deeply."

>a woman
 The widow seems poised to answer when she frowns suddenly.  "When is
 tea time, by the way?  One mustn't skip too many a meal, you know."

>a widow
 The widow rolls her eyes as you try and speak.  "But of course,
 darling."

>a husband
 You're not sure exactly how to ask, not sure you even want to ask, but
 the words come spilling out anyway.  "Are you... okay?  All alone out
 here.  Has your husband been...  Has it been long?"

 The widow offers you the most beautiful smile.  "Aren't you just a
 delight?  I could eat you up.  Darling, there have been plenty of men
 in my time.  Most steal in at the end of the day when I'm tired and in
 need of company.  When I wake up the morning after, they're long gone.
 Simple creatures really, easily pleased."

 A sad look comes over her.  "But then there are some like precious
 jewels - bright and full of character.  You want to keep them around
 forever, close by where they bring joy into your heart.  And you do,
 for a while.  But then one day you wake up covered in blood, and who
 knows what has happened, and you can't even bring yourself to eat for
 a week."

 You listen with wide eyes.  True love is a lot more frightening than
 you realised.

 The widow covers her face with a black-gloved hand and composes
 herself.  "But better to have loved and lost, I think."

>a queen
 "Do you know of my mother, the Queen?" you ask.

 The widow waves the suggestion away with a delicate movement.  "But of
 course, darling.  You can't beat good breeding."

 She looks at you then, and winks.

>wink
 The word "wink" is not necessary in this story.

>topics
 You could ask her about her husband, kissing, the net, the Queen, or
 the tree.

>a tree
 "What do you know about this tree?" you ask.

 The widow smiles.  "I came here blown on the wind, my net and I.  A
 colourful place, don't you think?  Though I do tend to keep to my
 corner of it."

>a kissing
 "I'm very sorry that I flinched," you say meekly.  "It's just that
 only my sisters have ever..."

 "Oh, think nothing of it," she quips.  "But in polite society it is
 quite normal for ladies to kiss on meeting."

 You nod, uncertain what to say.  You're not all that sure you qualify
 as a lady - nor that you even want to.

 As if she knows what you're thinking, the widow leans forward and
 touches a black-gloved finger to her lips, smiling warmly as you
 blush.

>kiss widow
 This is so unlike your work in the village.  Blushing, you lean
 towards the widow, and plant a hesitant kiss on her soft lips.  A
 strange thrill runs through you, your lips tingling, almost numb.  You
 shiver.

 "There," the widow says.  "That wasn't so hard, was it?"

 The numbness becomes more pronounced, spreading to your cheeks and
 down your throat.  You shiver again.

 "Poor darling," the widow says soothingly, "you look so cold.  Let me
 wrap you in this blanket..."

 The numbness has spread across your whole body, your vision is closing
 in.  You barely notice as you are wrapped in something smooth and
 warm.

 ***YOU WERE EATEN***

 The Queen smiles at your enthusiasm, perhaps a little sadly.  "Every
 spring," she says, "five dangerous creatures come to the tree and
 threaten my nest.  So I send one of my daughters to negotiate with
 them, and each year they give us no trouble.  This spring, I want you
 to be that daughter."

 You curtsy again from sheer surprise.  "Your majesty!  I would be
 honoured!"

 Queen's Chamber
 Not opulent, as you might expect, but twilit and homely.  Simple,
 finely crafted lamps cast a warm glow over the phloem walls.

 Cots line one side of the chamber, each holding a formless, swaddled
 bundle.

 The Queen, your mother, sits elegantly upon her throne.

 Tree Hollow Village
 This village - your home since birth - sprawls across and up the sides
 of the tree hollow.  Spittle cottages, fungal fields and twig
 farmhouses are set among the knotted wood on all sides, even clinging
 to the roof high above.

 From here you could head in to the Queen's chamber, or out to the
 sunlit world beyond the hollow.

 Close by, a group of your sisters tend to a herd.

 Obvious exits: In, Out

 Bejewelled Branch
 The fertile brown bark of the tree stretches in all directions: up
 into the blue sky, down to the exotic green jungle, and curving around
 on itself both sunwise and widdershins.

 The entrance to the Tree Hollow Village is set into the bark here.
 Just below it, a sturdy old branch stretches out into the distance,
 splitting into three smaller branches.  Suspended magically between
 the three branch-tips is a pulsating whorl of bright colour.

 One of your sisters lies curled up in the furrowed bark, dead.

 Obvious exits: Up, Down, In, Out, Sunwise, Widdershins

 Branch Tip, Beneath the Rainbow Net
 Someone has stretched a vast net from the tip of this branch to the
 tips of two others high overhead - an impressive feat, to say the
 least.  Flurries of blossom sail past on the wind, catching in the net
 and painting it bright, quivering colours.

 Obvious exits: Up, In

>go up
 You set your feet on the net.  You have a natural aptitude for walking
 at all angles, but it helps that the net happens to be quite sticky.

 Centre of the Rainbow Net
 From here, thin threads of silk extend in every direction, weaving a
 circular net in the air that catches delicate petals of blossom.  The
 net seems remarkably sturdy, for something so insubstantial, and
 you're confident you can get down from here with ease.

 A large silk bundle has been tied to the centre of the net.

 Obvious exits: Down

 Forest of Blossom
 The fertile brown bark of the tree stretches in all directions: up
 into the blue sky, down to the exotic green jungle, and curving around
 on itself both sunwise and widdershins.

 A thin, young branch sprouts from the bark at your feet, rapidly
 dividing into a forest of smaller twigs, each decorated with thick,
 colourful blossom.

 Highest Branch
 You cover your mouth and swear.  Holy shit.

 Your eyes have never been that good over long distances, and this has
 got to be the longest distance you've ever seen.  The green jungle
 stretches off to the horizon - something you had always thought a myth
 - where a jumble of strange shapes seem frozen in the act of rearing
 up into the sky.

 Tall, green-topped structures stand in a great cluster around the tree
 that you call home.  They can't be other trees, surely?

 Blossom Glade
 This peaceful clearing is surrounded on all sides by wiry twigs
 bearing blossom.  At its centre, a stubby knot spirals out of the
 youthful bark, its top glazed over with amber.

 A long-haired artist stands at his easel - paintbrush and palette in
 hand.

 Obvious exits: In

 The artist turns to offer you a warm smile.  "Aha!  Just what this
 scene was missing: a model."

>examine artist
 A young man, though still a fair bit older than yourself.  His
 features have a refined gentleness to them, and he moves with a
 leisurely grace.

 The artist is carrying a paintbrush and a palette, and he's wearing a
 little black dress and a red cloak.

>talk to artist
 You inch closer to the artist, uncertain how to begin.

 "Relax," he says.  "I don't bite."

 (You could ask him about the Queen, the tree, the painting, his cloak,
 or art.)

>examine painting
 It's clearly supposed to be a painting of the view in front of the
 artist, but your engineer's eye easily picks out numerous
 inaccuracies.  The colours are too bright, the blossom too vague, the
 sky too blue.  And yet, for all that, it seems almost more real than
 the scene itself.

 The centre of the canvas is blank and untouched.

 The artist leans towards you.  "It really needs something interesting
 to go in the middle, doesn't it?  Something sitting on that knot of
 bark..."

>a painting
 "What are you painting?" you ask.

 The artist waves his hand in front of him.  "This.  It's beautiful
 you'll agree, but it needs a focal point...  A conscious presence.
 Something for the viewer to identify with."

>a art
 "Is this... all that you do?" you ask, trying not to sound either
 disapproving or envious.

 The artist seems to understand what you mean.  "Don't be fooled: it's
 a pretty frugal life I have to live.  But I don't mind so much.  As
 everything slips through your fingers like sand, I think it's
 rewarding to try and catch hold of a few grains and hold them up to
 the light."

 You just smile and nod.

>a cloak
 "I like your cloak," you say.

 The artist looks over his shoulders.  "Well, it keeps my wings dry."

>a wings
 "You have wings?" you ask, trying not to stare.

 He pushes his cloak back slightly, and you get a glimpse of thin,
 shiny membranes.  "They're very precious to me.  I don't think I could
 survive without being able to take flight."

 You bite your lip.  Maybe, if you finish this task for the Queen...

>a queen
 "Do you know of my mother, the Queen?" you ask.

 "I've corresponded with her, yes," the artist says quietly.  "It's
 easy to criticise leaders for making harsh decisions, but I suppose we
 might well do the same in their place."

>a tree
 "What do you know about this tree?" you ask.

 The artist smiles.  "A beautiful world, replete with inspiration.
 Every spring I find myself compelled to visit ."

>examine knot
 Just the right height for sitting on.

>a model
 You look at the artist and try to form your question.  "I don't...
 what does your painting need?"

 The artist winks.  "It really needs something interesting to go in the
 middle, doesn't it?  Perhaps something sitting on that knot of
 bark..."

>sit on knot
 You sit on the smooth amber atop the knotted bark, feeling rather
 self-conscious.  One of a thousand sisters, you've never been the
 centre of attention before.

 "That expression," the artist says.  "Whatever it is, don't change
 it."

 And with that, he begins to paint you.

>sneeze
 The word "sneeze" is not necessary in this story.

>change expression
 You attempt a smile.  It feels kind of strange.

 The artist bites his paintbrush in alarm.  "No, no...  Your expression
 is just perfect as it is."

 You relax your face, and the artist sighs with relief.

 It's not easy to sit still like this, feeling the artist's eyes on
 you, wondering how you'll appear in the end result.  But it's not like
 you've never had to bear hardships before, so you sit through it.

 "Don't change your expression," the artist chides.

>wait
 As you sit in the sun, surrounded by colour, you watch the artist's
 brush flowing over the canvas.  Idly you wonder if you could ever take
 up painting as a hobby.  You're sure you might be able to cadge the
 supplies together, especially if you succeed in your task, but could
 you really teach yourself?

 "There," the artist says, "all done.  Stand up and come over here."

>stand
 You stand up awkwardly.

 The artist smiles and gestures at the canvas.  "Go on," he says, "take
 a good look."

>examine painting
 Taking pride of place in the canvas, surrounded by colourful blossom,
 is your likeness: sitting uneasily, and smiling in a most peculiar
 way.  Undeniably you, and not any of your sisters.

 "So?" the artist asks.  "What do you think?"

 (You could gasp, gawp, or praise.)

>praise
 "It's amazing!" you gush.  "Most of my sisters can't even recognise
 me, but this...  Thank you so much!"

 The artist sniffs and wipes his cheeks with his delicate hands.  You
 realise that he's crying.  "It means a lot to me that you like it.
 I'm actually going to give it to your mother.  It's part of our
 arrangement."

 "What arrangement?" you ask, only half interested, still looking in
 awe at the canvas.

 "I have to eat," the artist says.  "Not often, but more than I'd like.
 I'm very sorry."

 He reaches into his cloak and retrieves a small, snub-nosed revolver.
 You're still smiling, quizzically.  It almost doesn't make sense to
 you.

 Without realising it, you die happy.

 Graveyard of Shells
 The fertile brown bark of the tree stretches in all directions: up

 This thick branch is dotted with dozens of coiled grey shells - most
 of them broken or shattered to some degree.

 wonder how exactly so many of them came to be in such a state of

>out
 Path to the Spiral House
 Gargantuan broken shells cast a cold shadow over this narrow path as
 it winds between them.  Conspicuous among the ruin is a single intact
 shell, spiral and grey, with a smart wooden door set into its opening.

 A knotted piece of rope hangs beside the door, dangling over a brass
 plaque.

 Obvious exits: In

>read plaque
 By Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen

 A very finely constructed piece of rope - not much use for practical
 work, but certainly nice to look at.  It's been knotted in a way that
 suggests pulling on it.

>pull it
 You pull the rope.  Somewhere inside the house, a bell rings.

 The door is answered by a smartly dressed gentleman with no arms or
 legs.  "Ah yes," he says.  "You're expected.  Please, come right in."

 He leads you inside, up some stairs, around a corner and down a slope.

 Curved Parlour
 The floor and ceiling of this room are both curved, and you're not
 entirely sure which way up you are.  Antique chairs and a coffee table
 are stuck to the carpet with discreet blobs of tree sap.  Bookcases
 line the walls like the slats of a folding fan.

 On the coffee table are a jar of sauce and a rotary telephone.

 A limbless aristocrat stands here, balanced on his tail.

 Obvious exits: Down

 "Good thing you turned up, what?" the aristocrat says.  "There might
 be something you can help me with."

>examine bookcases
 Lining a curved room with huge bookcases is the kind of inspired but
 futile feat of engineering that you're always both impressed by and
 derisive of.  The books seem kind of interesting, though.

 Your eye's also drawn to a framed photograph sitting on the shelves.

>examine photograph
 The photograph seems to be of a portly old gent with no arms or legs.
 Limblessness aside, though, he's clearly no close relative of the
 aristocrat.

 "Ah yes," the aristocrat says, "the old owner of this place.  Still a
 few things of his around, you know."

>a Cornu Aspersa
 (asking the aristocrat)
 "So, the former owner of this house..." you begin.

 "Yes," the aristocrat says, "an upstanding man of the legal
 profession.  A good friend of mine, don'cha know, if troubled at
 times.  A tough trial can be murder, my good girl, and even the best
 counsel may find himself getting eaten alive by his opponent."

>read books
 It would be a bit rude to stand in the aristocrat's house reading his
 books.

>topics
 You could ask him about help, the Queen, the spiral house, his arms
 and legs, or the tree.

>a arms and legs
 "Do you get on all right living by yourself?" you ask.

 "You mean with no arms and legs?" the aristocrat says.  "They're
 entirely worthless appendages anyway.  All one needs is a good strong
 body and a nice set of gnashers."

 He opens his mouth for you to observe his rows of big, sharp teeth.

 "Of course," he goes on, "that doesn't stop people from assuming that
 one does have arms and legs, and thereby adding needless obstacles to
 one's life."

 He glances at the jar of sauce.

>examine jar
 The label recommends serving with escargot, whatever that is.  It's
 closed.

 The aristocrat clears his throat.

>open it
 You don't want to just up and open this jar uninvited.

>a jar
 "How can I help you?" you ask.

 The aristocrat looks embarrassed.  "I'm afraid that for all the
 vaunted consumer choice of this age, they just don't make jars that
 one can open without hands - without opposable thumbs even.  If you
 would be so gracious, young madam, I would be extremely pleased if you
 could open this jar of sauce for me."

 Open the jar.  Right.  If your sisters spoke like this, nothing would
 ever get done.

>open jar
 Opening a jar of sauce.  Seems like an easy enough task.  You take the
 jar in both hands and grip it firmly, twisting the lid in an
 anti-clockwise motion.  The jar opens.

 "Excellent," the aristocrat says.  "Most excellent indeed.  I'll dine
 well over the coming weeks, though she could have sent a less scrawny
 specimen."

 Your heart skips a beat.  Does he mean-?

 The aristocrat head butts you, and everything goes black.

 She raises her head and wipes her dainty nose on her wrist.  "Does
 everything look all right?  I was flying over that pool and my hat
 fell in.  Now I can't get it back because if my wings get wet I'll
 drown."

 (You could ask her about the pointed hat, her wings, the mirror pool,
 the Queen, the tree, or swimming.)

 A delicate waif of a girl, crying into her tiny hands.  Your heart
 breaks for her.  Her dainty wings glitter with rainbow light.

 understandable."

 The damsel sniffs.  "Only that I can't ever do it.  It can't be that
 hard if you don't have wings, though.  Just move your arms like this
 and kick your feet."

 She waves her arms and legs about convulsively.  You try to pay close
 attention.

>swim
 (in the mirror pool)
 You wade out into the water until it's up to your armpits and then try
 kicking and splashing to move.  It doesn't work.  You just end up face
 down, making a lot of noise and trying to only breathe in when your
 head is above water.

 With a melodious giggle, something lands on your back.  Delicate hands
 take tight hold of your hair, and push your face down into the pool.
 Thrumming wings beat into the water, throwing up stronger splashes
 than your feeble attempts to struggle.  As the life starts to leave
 you, a set of small, but very sharp teeth close around the back of
 your neck.

 splitting into three smaller branches.  Suspended magically between
 the three branch-tips is a pulsating whorl of bright colour.

 One of your sisters lies curled up in the furrowed bark, dead.

 Obvious exits: Up, Down, In, Out, Sunwise, Widdershins

>w.w.w
 You walk widdershins around the tree trunk, stopping when you
 encounter the next branch growing out from its bark.

 Graveyard of Shells
 This thick branch is dotted with dozens of coiled grey shells - most
 of them broken or shattered to some degree.

 Obvious exits: Up, Out, Sunwise, Widdershins

 Split Branch
 The base of this branch has partially split through, and some strange
 shimmering mirror is wedged between the two halves.

 Obvious exits: Up, Out, Sunwise, Widdershins

 Rotten Branch
 The fertile brown bark of the tree stretches in all directions: up
 into the blue sky, down to the exotic green jungle, and curving around
 on itself both sunwise and widdershins.

 The branch here writhes out from the trunk as if racked with agony.
 Its cracked bark and gnarled flesh sprout bizarre clusters of twisted
 fungi.

 Obvious exits: Up, Out, Sunwise, Widdershins

>out
 Fungal Bloom
 Strange, asymmetrical fungi sprout out from within this branch,
 splitting the bark and corrupting its offshoots into weird, bloated
 shapes.  One particularly corpulent mushroom bulges out of the bark
 beneath a tall, healthy twig.

 The twig ends in a bright green leaf.

 An enormous knight towers over the area, clad in black armour.  It
 shows only the vaguest interest in the soft white baby lying at its
 feet.

 Obvious exits: In

 The baby reaches out vainly towards the leaf.

>examine baby
 Enormous.  Pale.  Soft.  Its mouth a gaping black hole.

 It reminds you painfully of your brothers.  Only much, much bigger.

 The baby reaches out for the leaf and wails in frustration.

>examine knight
 A giant of a person, covered from head to toe in thick black plate
 mail.  Its helmet sports a ridiculous pair of curved horns.

 The baby emits a high, keening wail.  You cover your ears.

>talk to knight
 The knight does not respond.  Deep inside that ridiculous helmet, it's
 possible that the knight can't even hear you.

 The baby looks at you as if it's not really sure what to make of you.

>talk to baby
 The baby just gurgles stupidly.

>examine helmet
 The smooth faceplate of the knight's helmet has only the slightest of
 slits to see through.  Ridiculous horns curve up from the helmet and
 into the sky.

>examine horns
 From down here it's difficult to say how far the horns extend upwards,
 but they must add a least an extra head to the knight's height.

>examine leaf
 It would look rather delicious, if you were much of a leaf eater.

 The baby reaches out for the leaf and wails in frustration.

>eat it
 You've never been much of one for eating leaves.

>get it
 The leaf is tantalisingly out of reach.

 The baby emits a high, keening wail.  You cover your ears.

>climb horns
 That is not something you can climb.

 The knight shifts slightly on its feet.

>look
 Fungal Bloom
 Strange, asymmetrical fungi sprout out from within this branch,
 splitting the bark and corrupting its offshoots into weird, bloated
 shapes.  One particularly corpulent mushroom bulges out of the bark
 beneath a tall, healthy twig.

 The twig ends in a bright green leaf.

 An enormous knight towers over the area, clad in black armour.  It
 shows only the vaguest interest in the soft white baby lying at its
 feet.

 Obvious exits: In

 The baby stretches out a fat-fingered hand towards the leaf.

>examine mushroom
 It looks like it must be swollen with rotten ooze.  But it could
 probably take your weight.

 The baby looks at you as if it's not really sure what to make of you.

>climb on mushroom
 Okay, you're now standing on the mushroom.

>eat it
 The mushroom does not appear to be edible.

 The baby reaches out vainly towards the leaf.

>get leaf
 You stand on tiptoe and grasp the fresh green leaf in your hands.
 With one tug, it separates from its twig, and you fall forwards,
 towards the baby.  It catches you in its fat fingers.

 You smile, holding out the leaf triumphantly.

 The baby pulls you towards its gaping mouth.  Wait, this wasn't what
 you-

 ***YOU WERE EATEN***

 It's done.  For another year, the village is safe.  Now come the
 spring festivities, the rejoicing and singing.

 Queen's Chamber (sitting on the throne)
 Not as nice as your mother's place, but you've made yourself
 comfortable here.  Simple, finely crafted lamps cast a warm glow over
 the phloem walls.

 Cots line one side of the chamber, each holding a formless, swaddled
 bundle.

 One of your daughters leans a framed painting against the wall and
 curtsies, before leaving hurriedly.

 Sounds of merriment and raised voices carry into the chamber from
 outside.

>examine bundles
 Innocent and helpless.  Little darlings.

>examine painting
 A bright, expressionistic portrayal of one of your daughters - you've
 no idea which one.  She's smiling in the most peculiar way.  There's
 something about this painting, some portent or emotion that you can
 almost but not quite grasp.  But then, there always is, and it's
 always different.

 You'll leave the painting out, for now, to remind you - as you're sure
 he wanted it to.  And then you'll have it stowed away with the others.

 Sounds of merriment and raised voices carry into the chamber from
 outside.

>examine me
 Not young any more, but still elegant and beautiful.  Your wings are
 as breathtaking at ever.

>out
 (off of the throne)
 You stand up from your throne.  Your daughters will be waiting for you
 outside, eager to celebrate the renewal of the seasons.

 Sounds of merriment and raised voices carry into the chamber from
 outside.

>out
 You step serenely out of your chamber, into the village.  A thousand
 of your daughters await you, cheering happily, waiting for you to
 begin the spring festival.  Blissfully ignorant.

 You raise your hand in salute, and spread your wings.

>amusing
 Have you tried:

 Tasting all of the different characters?  Tasting yourself?  Singing,
 dancing, crying, jumping or screaming as the Queen or one of her
 daughters?  Typing 'god save the queen'?  Getting up while the artist
 paints you and/or trying to sneak a peak at the unfinished portrait?
 Sitting on the damsel's twig... while she's still sitting on it?
 Asking the aristocrat about Cornu Aspersa?  Sitting on the
 aristocrat's carpet?  Rocking in the aristocrat's rocking chair?
 Rocking elsewhere?Examining your surroundings while in conversation
 with the more talkative characters?  And finally, have you tried
 typing 'xyzzy'?

>afterword
 I'm sure all sorts of meanings can be read into this game, but really
 I just tried to write a human story about being an ant.  The
 inhabitants of the tree hollow all wear red because they're red ants.

 The widow isn't supposed to be any kind of spider in particular, and
 certainly not an actual black widow.  It's my understanding that the
 chief problem any male spider has while attempting to procreate
 involves approaching a female spider in her web without appearing to
 be edible - which, of course, he actually is.  I'm sure that some
 females are easier to get close to than others.

 You may have noticed that the only character in this game with a name
 is the late Cornu Aspersa Esq.  His name is the Latin term for a
 common snail, in case you didn't already know.

 This game owes something of a debt to Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis
 Carroll and Anna Anthropy's In The Woods.

 Taking back one turn: "out".

 Queen's Chamber
 Not as nice as your mother's place, but you've made yourself
 comfortable here.  Simple, finely crafted lamps cast a warm glow over
 the phloem walls.

 Cots line one side of the chamber, each holding a formless, swaddled

>god save the queen
 She ain't no human being!

>xyzzy
 Unbidden, some ancient instinctual meme crawls up from your
 subconscious.  Your lips dance of their own accord.  "Xyzzy," you say.

 You begin to twitch and shudder, your tiny brain cartwheeling into an
 ouroboros of self-referential insanity.  "Xyzzy," you repeat.
 "Xyzzy."

 You don't even notice as your legs give way and you collapse to the
 ground.  Your senses have closed in, your mind shut down.  And all
 that is left... is xyzzy.

 (Your score has just decreased by twenty points.)

 *** GAME OVER ***

 In 127 moves, you have scored -14 of a possible 6 points.  This makes
 you a xyzzy.
