 You've wandered away from Honey and Grandpa picking blackberries.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bear Creek</span>
 an interactive fiction
 by Wes Modes

 You were sure that this was a better spot than where you've been
 picking all morning. But here too, the biggest ripest berries seem to
 be just out of reach. You pick a few ripe berries and drop them in
 your pail. Under the pine trees, the air smells good.

 Looking around: The clearing where Honey and Grandpa have been picking
 is just down the hill from here.

 The sunlight comes slanting through the trees in the morning light.
 The air is still crisp in the shade with the early promise of a hot
 midsummer day.

>about

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>inventory

 You are carrying a pail, inside which is a bunch of ripe berries.

>examine berries

 You've picked a big bunch of blackberries. Looking at them, you notice
 that the color goes from deep red to deepest black.  A couple of these
 berries are kind of too ripe and look like little raisins.

>eat berry

 You eat a few of the berries. Delicious.

>pick berries

 You stretch and manage to pick a few ripe blackberries. You drop the
 berries into your pail.

 The song "Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds", begins playing on the nearby
 radio.

>examine radio

 You can't see any such thing.

>listen

 You hear the nearby radio playing "Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds". And
 Honey and Grandpa are talking nearby.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lost in the Brambles</span>
 This spot, a little ways from where Honey and Grandpa are picking, has
 some good berries. Under the pine trees, the air smells good.

 Looking around: The clearing where Honey and Grandpa have been picking

 The sunlight comes slanting through the trees in the morning light.

 You hear a dog barking in the distance across the river.

>examine trees

 Pine trees fringe the tangle of berry brambles.

>examine me

 What's to say? You are eight and a half, and you are going into 4th
 grade in the fall. And you like watching the Wonderful World of Disney
 on Sunday night and Bowling for Dollars with your grandpa.

 You hear a dog barking in the distance across the river.

 On the nearby radio, a new song begins: "Before the Next Teardrop
 Falls" by Freddy Fender, a good one.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blackberry Clearing</span>
 The water churgles in the nearby creek but you can't see it through
 the forest of blackberry brambles all around you. Every summer since
 you were little, you pick blackberries with your Honey and Grandpa
 down along Bear Creak. This is a pleasant clearing carpeted with
 stubbly grass under a sycamore tree. There are paths and clearings
 beaten down among the brambles that allow you to squeeze in to get the
 ripest berries. There is a big bucket in the middle of the clearing.
 Grandpa's shirt and Honey's portable transistor radio are on the bank
 under the tree playing music.

 Looking around, you see places you can go: Along the path and down the
 creek, there's a tangle of blackberry bushes. Up the hill is the
 blackberry brambles where you've been picking for a while.

 Honey and Grandpa are here picking berries.

 "Hey hi, Bud," Grandpa says.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You get a funny, sad feeling out of nowhere, that this is the last</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">time you will pick berries with Honey and Grandpa.</span>

>examine honey

 She's stern with a sneaky smile. Sometimes you think you hate Honey.
 Though, thinking about it, you remember how when you stayed the summer
 at Honey and Grandpa's house, she taught you to make pots on the
 potter's wheel. And how she took you for a ride on the motorcycle. You
 know she loves you, but why does she have to be so mean sometimes?

 You hear a dog barking in the distance across the river.

>examine grandpa

 Grandpa is, well, Grandpa. He's not tall. He's not fat. He has a bald
 spot right on top of his head like a little hat. He's like a bull,
 kind of, but skinnier and wears a warm plaid shirt. Today he's in a
 t-shirt, but usually. He smells good, like cigarettes and that stuff
 he puts on his face when he shaves.

 While you are looking, he sees you and smiles.

>smile

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine radio

 Honey's little portable transistor radio is sitting on the bank beside
 grandpa's shirt under the tree. You've always been fascinated by it,
 as much by its perfect cube shape and woodgrain finish as anything.
 The tiny volume knob is missing, but there is a piece of something
 that looks like wax or plastic jammed in its place. The radio is on
 and is tuned to a station playing pop music.

 You hear Honey's radio playing a new song: "How Sweet It Is To Be
 Loved By You," one of your favorites.

>examine bucket

 There's a big bucket that Honey and Grandpa have been putting their
 berries into, about a quarter full.

 You hear a dog barking in the distance across the river.

>kick bucket

 A glance from Honey and you get the message that you better not.

 Honey and Grandpa continue their conversation: "Have you heard from
 Nick about this summer? Is he planning a visit or are we just left
 guessing?" Grandpa asks Honey.

 "Nothing. Not a word," Honey says.

>talk to honey

 "Hello, kiddo," Honey says.

 "You're tuneless whistling again," Honey says to Grandpa. You hadn't
 even noticed any whistling.


>talk to grandpa

 "Well hi, Whistle Britches," Grandpa says.

 After a DJ break, Honey's radio's playing "You're No Good" by Linda
 Ronstadt, a good one.

 "Did you call Rachel?" Honey asks Grandpa. "Sounded like she wanted to
 talk to her dad."

>ask honey about rachel

 "Don't worry about your mom," Honey says, "She'll be fine. Why don't
 you go over and help your grandpa some."

>ask grandpa about nick

 "Your dad? Well," Grandpa says, "you know, he and I always got along
 fine. I think he's a good guy, but I don't like that he doesn't see
 much of you."

>ask grandpa about mom

 Grandpa didn't seem to hear you.

 Grandpa pauses for a minute from his berry picking and lights a
 cigarette and smokes for a bit.

 "Well, Noodle, your dad is what he is, I guess," Grandpa says, "I
 think he loves you but doesn't always know how to show it."

>ask grandpa about rachel

 The song "Pick Up the Pieces", begins playing on Honey's radio.

 "Your mom? What's on your mind, Tootsie Roll?" Grandpa looks serious,
 "Don't worry about her. She can take care of herself. Your mama will
 always love you more than anything in the whole world."

>ask rachel about nick

 You can't see any such thing.

>ask honey about nick

 "Your mom's just gone to work things out with your step-dad." Grandpa
 forces a smile, "You watch, she'll be back in a jiffy. She should be
 home tomorrow. But she'll be okay."

 "Did you get a birthday card from him this year? No? Surprise! I
 didn't think so," Honey says angrily. Is she mad at you? Or mad at
 your dad? But why?

>whistle

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>help grandpa

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>ask grandpa about love

 Grandpa is still talking.

 "Your mama will be just fine," Grandpa says.

 "We haven't heard from him this whole year. I guess no visit with your
 dad this summer," Honey says with a grim smile.

>ask grandpa about berries

 "How you doing, JoJo?" Grandpa pats your head. "You helping your Honey
 and grandpa make blackberry jam?"

 "I think it takes more than being at the right place at the right time
 to be a father," Honey says, and after a moment, "Sorry, sweetie, I'm
 not mad at you. I'm mad about grown up stuff."

>take bucket

 That's going to be pretty heavy. Better leave it for Grandpa to carry.

 After a DJ break, Honey's radio's playing "Rhinestone Cowboy," a song
 you really like.

 "I'm done waiting for him to step up and be your father," Honey says.

>inventory

 You are carrying a pail, inside which is a bunch of ripe berries.

>pour pail into bucket

 You empty the bunch of ripe berries from the pail into the big bucket.

 "I'll call her tonight, see how she is," Grandpa says to Honey.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lost in the Brambles</span>
 This spot, a little ways from where Honey and Grandpa are picking, has
 some good berries. Under the pine trees, the air smells good.

 Looking around: The clearing where Honey and Grandpa have been picking
 is just down the hill from here.

 The sunlight comes slanting through the trees in the morning light.
 The air is still crisp in the shade with the early promise of a hot
 midsummer day.

>pick berries

 You notice some ripe ones down near your knees and grab a bunch of
 ripe blackberries. You drop the berries into your pail.

 On the nearby radio, a new song begins: "Never Can Say Goodbye".

 You hear Honey and Grandpa talking.

>again

 By working on tiptoes, you are just able to pick a few  ripe
 blackberries. You drop the berries into your pail which is about half
 full.

>again

 You notice some ripe ones down near your knees and grab a bunch of
 ripe blackberries. You drop the berries into the pail which is getting
 close to full.

>again

 By working on tiptoes, you are just able to pick a few  ripe
 blackberries. You carefully put these blackberries in the pail which
 is now heaping.

 You hear Honey and Grandpa talking.

>go down

 With your heaping full pail, you imagine tripping and blackberries
 going everywhere and getting in trouble.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blackberry Clearing</span>
 You are near the creek, but it can't be seen through the blackberry
 brambles. This is a pleasant clearing carpeted with stubbly grass
 under a sycamore tree. There are paths and clearings beaten down among
 the brambles that allow you to squeeze in to get the ripest berries.
 There is a big bucket in the middle of the clearing. Grandpa's shirt
 and Honey's portable transistor radio are on the bank under the tree
 playing music.

 Along the path and down the creek, there's a tangle of blackberry
 bushes. Up the hill is the blackberry brambles where you've been
 picking for a while.

 Honey and Grandpa are here picking berries.

 You hear Honey's radio playing a new song: "Shining Star".

>pour pail into bucket

 You empty the bunch of ripe berries from the pail into the big bucket.

>examine bucket

 There's a big bucket that Honey and Grandpa have been putting their
 berries into, about a quarter full.

 You wander a little distance away, but close enough that you can still
 hear. "I do not like the way he treats, ah, the little one. At all."
 Grampa says.

>go down

 Honey notices as you go past.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blackberry Tangle</span>
 There are paths through the brambles, a maze with tantalizing fruit.
 Although this area is mostly picked since you and Honey and Grandpa
 came this way when you started picking this morning. You can still
 find some ripe berries though.

 Through the blackberry tangle, there's a trail going down along the
 creek shaded by lush green willow trees. Back the way you came is the
 clearing where Honey and Grandpa have been picking.

 You hear Honey and Grandpa talking.

>take berries

 You stretch and manage to pick a few ripe blackberries. You drop the
 berries into your pail.

 On the nearby radio, a new song begins: "My Eyes Adored You" by
 Frankie Valli, a good one.

 You hear Honey and Grandpa talking.

>go down

 Ever vigilant, Honey looks down the trail and sees you wandering.

 "Hey, why don't you stay here with us? Don't you want to help your
 Honey and grandpa?" You reluctantly head back to the clearing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blackberry Clearing</span>

 "Did you ask about the arm?" Honey asks Grandpa, glancing in your
 direction.

>take berries
>examine arm

 By working on tiptoes, you are just able to pick a few  ripe
 blackberries. You drop the berries into your pail which is about half
 full.

 Grandpa pauses for a minute from his berry picking and wipes his
 forehead with his handkerchief and rests against a tree.


 Looking carefully, you can see marks on your arm where your step-dad
 grabbed you, and it's still a little tender

 "I did ask about the arm, but I didn't find out anything," Grandpa
 says, looking over at you. "To think that asshole, pardon my French,
 might have..." Grandpa just shakes his head.

>rub arm

 You achieve nothing by this.

 You hear Honey's radio playing a new song: "Mandy," one you like to
 sing to.

 ""I don't put anything past him when he's been drinking," Honey says
 to Grandpa. "Yeah, he's a charmer. What were you thinking, Rachel?"

>take berries

 You notice some ripe ones down near your knees and grab a bunch of
 ripe blackberries. You drop the berries into the pail which is getting
 close to full.

 "Hey, sweetie," Honey calls to you. "When you go with grandpa to take
 the bucket to the trailer, can you ask Mary about lunch?"


>again

 By working on tiptoes, you are just able to pick a few  ripe
 blackberries. You carefully put these blackberries in the pail which
 is now heaping. That should be enough to satisfy Honey.

 Even though you love picking blackberries -- and you certainly love
 blackberry jam, blackberry pie, blackberry and cream, or just eating
 fresh blackberries -- you've been picking berries all morning. You
 must have picked a <span class="floydstyle em">million</span> pails already. And you want to see
 if the red ants ate the dead cricket you put near their hole. Oh, and
 you want to see if you can find a lucky penny. And you may even wanna
 swim.


 You should probably dump the berries in Honey and Grandpa's bucket.

>go north

 Your full pail is making you nervous.

 You could never remember which way was which, and without your
 Explorer Scout compass it's more useful to use landmarks to navigate
 anyway.

>go up

 You are concentrating so hard on your full pail, your hands start to
 shake and a ripe berry tumbles off into the dirt.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lost in the Brambles</span>

 "Hm, good question, Peanut," Grandpa shrugs.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blackberry Trail</span>
 This is a trail running roughly parallel the creek with tall
 blackberry brambles on either side. In one place, there are Willows
 hanging down over the trail that tickle the back of your neck as you
 duck under them.

 It looks like the trail used to continue further on down the creek on
 this side, but is now hidden by underbrush -- though you could try to
 follow the lost trail. Farther on down the creek, the trail turns to
 cross an overgrown stone bridge. In the other direction, up the path,
 is the tangle of blackberry bushes.

>examine underbrush

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine lost trail

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine bridge

>trail

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go trail

 You're not sure exactly how to get there. You take a quick look around
 you: It looks like the trail used to continue further on down the
 creek on this side, but is now hidden by underbrush -- though you
 could try to follow the lost trail. Farther on down the creek, the
 trail turns to cross an overgrown stone bridge. In the other
 direction, up the path, is the tangle of blackberry bushes.

>go lost trail

 You follow the trail on this side of the creek until it is lost, then
 bushwhack for a little bit, before returning discouraged. Perhaps it
 is a trail, but there are definitely easier ways to go for now. Still
 you wonder where it goes.

>go bridge

 You glance one more time at the old overgrown creek trail before
 crossing the bridge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stone Bridge</span>
 The trail crosses an old stone bridge -- an excellent place to sit on
 a sunny day -- from which you can look down into Bear Creek. Movement
 in the sparkling water and the old mossy bridge catch your eye. You
 follow water skeeters darting about.

 On one side of the bridge, the path turns out into a dirt road that
 runs down along the creek. On the other side, the blackberry trail
 goes up the creek back toward the berry picking spot. You can also get
 in the creek or go to a grassy bank from here.

 On a distant radio, a new song begins: "Feel Like Makin" Love".

>examine movement

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine skeeters

 In places, the creek seems like just a trickle, then other places it
 is as wide as a river. Here, it is broad and shallow as it goes under
 the bridge. There are bright stars twinkling on the water with pebbles
 and tiny minnows below. It smells like wet rocks.

 A branch floats by, catching for a moment on the bottom, and then
 continues on.

 A dog barking can be plainly heard from across the river.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stone Bridge</span>
 The road may have crossed the creek over an old stone bridge at one
 time but is now just a narrow trail. From here you can peer down into
 Bear Creek. Movement in the sparkling water and the old mossy bridge
 catch your eye. You catch a glimmering flash in the depths near a
 boulder.

 On one side of the bridge, the path turns out into a dirt road that
 runs down along the creek. On the other side, the blackberry trail

 You watch two leaves swirl by on the current.

 The song "Black Water", begins playing on a faint radio.

>take flash

 You reach for them, but they drift on down the river.

>examine bridge

 The trail goes over the old bridge that was probably part of some old
 road. The stones of the old bridge are covered with moss. Horsetails
 and ferns are growing at the shady base of the bridge.

 On a distant radio, a new song begins: "Sister Golden Hair".

 Silly, you can't pick that.

 A dog barking can be plainly heard from across the river.

 catch your eye. Little minnows are swimming about in the shallows.

 A dog barking can be plainly heard from across the river.

 You hear a far-away radio playing a new song: "Another Somebody Done
 Somebody Wrong Song," a good one.

>go road

 (first getting off the grassy bank)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dirt Road</span>
 The trail over the stone bridge turns into a dirt road here which
 slopes gently upward running along the creek.. The old creekside road
 is seldom used now and in poor condition with deep ruts and sandy
 areas. Nowadays it is only used by people walking down to Bear Creek
 from the highway, fishermen and berry pickers mostly. Here, someone's
 field backs up to the road and is separated by a chain link fence. The
 field is a mass of tall weeds and old junk cars.

 The old dirt road continues on uphill for a long stretch running
 parallel to the creek downstream. Back toward the old stone bridge,
 the road narrows to a ragged trail as it crosses the bridge.

 There's a dog behind the fence, alternately digging and barking.

 <span class="floydstyle em">This dog makes you suddenly queasy, though you couldn't have known</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">then what part it would play in what happened.</span>

>kill dog

 You're pretty scared of this furiously barking animal, and don't want
 to get too close.

 The dog is trying to dig underneath the fence. It's doing pretty good
 with its escape attempt already. When it sees you, it barks furiously
 and launches itself against the chain link.

>examine dog

 Kind of a yellowish medium dog with pointy ears. You don't know what
 kind. It's not a german shepherd or a doberman but it looks mean like
 that. Some kind of guard dog maybe. It reminds you of Uncle Buddy's
 dog that mom was taking care of and how when you tried to feed it and
 get the spoon, it bit you.

 It makes you queasy. But there's something about this dog.

 Is that grandpa calling you?

>give berries to dog

 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory

 You are carrying a pail. Looking carefully, you can see marks on your
 arm where your step-dad grabbed you, and it's still a little tender.

 You think you hear your Grandpa calling you

>give pail to dog

 The dog perks up its ears as you approach. The dog extends its nose
 cautiously to sniff the pail and wanders away disinterested.

 The dog is alternately digging and barking up a storm.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long stretch</span>
 This is a really long stretch of the dirt road. You can see the heat
 shimmering off of the ground. Grass grows up through the middle of the
 road, and deep rocky ruts suggest it hasn't been used as anything but
 river access for hikers and fishermen in a long time. The long road is
 alternately shaded by pines and exposed to the scorching sun. The air
 smells hot with a particular piney fragrance that always reminds you
 of the foothills of the Sierras.

 At one place along this long stretch, there is a trail zigzagging down
 the bank toward the swimming hole. Otherwise the dirt road goes on for
 a ways along the creek downstream until it crosses the railroad
 tracks. Back the other way is the end of the dirt road and the stone
 bridge.

 Along the road, in a clear stretch on the uphill side of the road, is
 an impressively tall pine tree that you've climbed before.

 That sounds like Grandpa calling you.

>examine tree

 There is a hugely tall pine tree here. Grandpa said it was called Doug
 Fir (not fur like a dog, but fir, which is a kind of pine tree). The
 tree is on the uphill side of the road below a low bluff. The branches
 are almost low enough to climb which you've done a couple of times but
 never all the way to the top.

 From over by the blackberry clearing, you think grandpa's calling.

>climb tree

 You jump to reach the lowest branch and hang there struggling for a
 few moments before dropping back to the ground frustrated.

 You <span class="floydstyle em">know</span> you've climbed this tree before and you were
 probably smaller then too. Maybe you should try again?

 A dog barking can be heard somewhere down the road.

>climb tree

>climb tree
 This time, you get a leg up and hang there like a monkey, but can't
 quite get up on the lowest branch. You drop down when your arms start
 shaking.

 You pretty sure you've climbed this tree before. Was it this one?

 A dog barking can be heard somewhere down the road.


 Using the rise on the uphill side of the tree, you are able to get a
 hold of a branch and swing your leg over, dangling precariously for a
 few moments, before pulling yourself upright. After that, the tree is
 pretty easy to climb. Although you've now got sap all over your hands.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Halfway Up</span>
 You're about halfway up the tree, really pretty high. The branches
 definitely get thinner higher up. But here the branches are about as
 big around as your leg and you are sitting on a particularly sturdy
 one. In fact, you're feeling pretty comfortable up here. You make a
 monkey yell to tell the other monkeys you are now the ruler of the
 forest.

 Looking around, it's hard to see much of anything, although you can
 see the dog still trying to tunnel under the fence through the thick
 branches. It looks like the view is much better higher up.

>climb

 Should you go any higher? You notice that the branches definitely thin
 out near the top of the tree.

>climb

 You work your way higher into the pine tree, the branches are thinner
 but still seem pretty stable and--

 SNAP!

 --down you go!

 Miraculously, you catch yourself going down! But not before clobbering
 yourself in the ribs pretty hard. It knocks the wind out of you and
 for a few minutes, you can't even say "Ow." You've fallen back to
 where you were a second ago. Do you dare try again?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Halfway Up</span>

 You think you hear your Grandpa calling you

>climb

 This time you work your way around to the sunny side of the tree where
 the branches are a little bit thicker. You test each branch a little
 and keep a hold of another branch before committing your weight. In
 this way, you slowly make your way up to the top.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of the Pine Tree</span>
 This is very close to the very top. You are holding on to the narrow
 trunk of the tree. You can feel it sway in the faint breeze. It is
 slightly cooler up here. Looking around, you can see the <span class="floydstyle em">whole</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">world</span>.

 In the distance, you can see the mountains, brown and green, edged
 with trees all the way around, and not just Bear Creek below you, but
 the river a ways over there. And out that way is town, barely visible
 through trees.  And the forest stretching out endlessly in every
 direction.

 The railroad tracks which wind gently from one direction pass almost
 beneath you and disappear in gentle S-curves in the other direction.
 You can see the trailer park and that might be Honey and Grandpa's
 trailer. Everything looks so small, like looking at an ant hill. A
 giddy feeling pushes up out of you, and you can't stop laughing.


 That sounds like Grandpa calling you.

>laugh

 You chuckle heartily.

 You think you hear your Grandpa calling you

 Looking down, you get a sudden crazy urge to leap into space. You

 You sing a little bit of one of your favorite songs, "Kung Fu
 Fighting", but you only know the chorus.

 From over by the blackberry clearing, you think grandpa's calling.

>climb

 You can't go that way.

>go down

 You carefully work your way down from the top, avoiding the thinner
 branches.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Halfway Up</span>
 You're about halfway up the tree, really pretty high. The branches
 definitely get thinner higher up. But here the branches are about as

>go down

 You work your way down the tree, dropping the last few feet to the
 ground.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long stretch</span>
 This is a really long stretch of the dirt road. You can see the heat
 shimmering off of the ground. Grass grows up through the middle of the
 road, and deep rocky ruts suggest it hasn't been used as anything but
 river access for hikers and fishermen in a long time. The long road is
 alternately shaded by pines and exposed to the scorching sun. The air
 smells hot with a particular piney fragrance that always reminds you
 of the foothills of the Sierras.

 At one place along this long stretch, there is a trail zigzagging down
 the bank toward the swimming hole. Otherwise the dirt road goes on for
 a ways along the creek downstream until it crosses the railroad
 tracks. Back the other way is the end of the dirt road and the stone
 bridge.

 Along the road, in a clear stretch on the uphill side of the road, is
 an impressively tall pine tree that you've climbed before.

 You think you hear your Grandpa calling you

 You're not sure exactly how to get there. You take a quick look around
 you: At one place along this long stretch, there is a trail zigzagging

>go down

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>go swimming hole

 As you step out of the oppressive heat, the cool shade is a welcome
 relief.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Swimming hole</span>
 Down a long wooded trail that zigs down the bank, you emerge from the
 thick woods, and the trees open up to the sky. The swimming hole lies
 before you, a deep pool carved out of and surrounded by smooth granite
 rocks. It is big enough that you can swim like they taught you at the
 YWCA from one end to the other, and deep enough to dive off the rocks.

 It is possible to walk along the rocky shore downstream to another
 spot along the creek. Back up the trail leads through the woods back
 to the dirt road.

 There is a floating length of log here, bobbing around at the edges of
 the swimming hole.

 You can also see a deep pool here.

 The creek tumbles down some big granite rocks here and forms a deep
 pool. You can't see the bottom. And that makes you anxious.

 You look around again to see if you are alone. The path from the dirt
 road is deep forest and there is no one else at the swimming hole. So
 you carefully strip down to your skivvies, folding your clothes on the
 rocks.

>swim

 You stand at the edge of the rocks curling your toes over the edge.
 You hesitate before jumping in. At the count of three. One. Two.

 Two and a half.

  Two and three quarters.

 THREE!

 You jump in feet first and plummet straight down, the world of air and
 trees and clouds receding far above. You go down down down letting
 yourself fall slowly until you feel a jolt as your feet bump the rocks
 at the bottom of the pool.

 In the moment before you run out of air, you look up at an enchanted
 underwater world. Fingers of sunlight flicker through the green
 twilight. Even the very water around you shimmers before your eyes.

 You push off the bottom and return to the surface with a gasp of
 delicious air and climb back up on the rocks. You feel courageous.
 When you get out of the water, you dry quickly in the warm air.

 You put on your clothes.

 You'd probably fall in the water immediately.

 Here the creek broadens out a little and, except for a place in the
 middle where the current is swift, there are big stones, boulders
 really, scattered about in the river.

 The shoreline ends at a steep bank further downstream, though it looks
 like you might be able to cross the creek on the boulders in
 midstream. You can also go back along the rocks upstream.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Something about the crossing makes you nervous like watching a</span>

 Using the rise on the uphill side of the tree, you are able to get a

 few moments, before pulling yourself upright. After that, the tree is
 pretty easy to climb.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern Pacific Tracks</span>
 Railroad tracks cross the old dirt road here in a small rise. The
 tracks run alongside the trailer park fence in one direction and into
 a tunnel of green in the other. As you cross the tracks, you see a
 sign that says "Property of Southern Pacific." Your grandpa sometimes
 takes you down here to watch the train go by. He taught you the name
 of all the cars and used to work on the railroad.

 Across the tracks and through an open gate is the trailer park. Back
 the other way is the long dirt road gently sloping down along the
 creek.

 Hey, there's the penny you lost when you came here with Grandpa to
 make train pennies!

 You can also see a mound of rock here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Picnic Area</span>
 At the back of the trailer park, there is a scraggly little picnic
 area with a patchy lawn that smells like mowed grass. A little cluster
 of tall trees is against the back fence.

 Along the road, is the rest of the trailer park starting with D Loop.
 Through the back gate are the train tracks.

 There is an impressive red ant hill near the picnic table. Red ants
 are your sworn enemies. They're the ones who started the war, not you.
 A bunch of them ganged up and bit you, and all you were doing was
 trying to put them in a bottle for your ant colony. There is a drop of
 something on the pavement that the ants are very interested in.

>examine drop

 You see nothing special about the drop of something on the pavement.

>examine ants

 The ants wander about purposefully, though you can't tell exactly what
 they are up to. Near the trees, a bunch of big red ants are eating the
 remains of a huge Jerusalem cricket. Gross.

>examine cricket

 This huge translucent brown bug is totally gross when it is alive, so
 now that it is half smashed, half decayed and swarming with red ants,
 it is indescribably disgusting. You are totally fascinated.

>take cricket

 That's hardly portable.

>take ants

 They're hardly portable.

>inventory

 You are carrying a rock, a penny, and a pail. And your hands are
 spotted with pine pitch, your ribs still ache, and your arm hurts a
 little. You are going to get in such big trouble.

>examine ant hill

 This ant hill rises up higher than the top of your sneakers. Some of
 the red ants are scouting about individually.

>kick ant hill

 You crush a few of the nearby ants with your foot. Take that!

 The red ants are running everywhere.

 You get a lurching feeling as a police car pulls slowly through the
 trailer park. You are pulled along in its wake by curiosity. The
 police car stops in D Loop and so do you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">D Loop</span>

 The Sheriff's car -- you realize it's the Sheriff since it says so
 right on the door -- stops in front of the Cat Lady's trailer. You
 take a step back.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The Sheriff leans out the window toward the Cat Lady: "How you doing
 Sharon? Things okay around here?" The Sheriff flicks his eyes over at
 you, and you will yourself to be invisible.

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Well, pretty good, Bill. I can't complain," the Cat Lady tells the
 Sheriff. Then a frown crosses her face, "Oh except Oliver has an
 abscess. I have to take him to the kitty doctor next week."

>tell sheriff about arm

 The Sheriff looks your way, but seems to ignore what you said.

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Well what I came to ask," the Sheriff says to the Cat Lady, "Has he
 been bothering you any?" He looks back toward C Loop. "When I drove
 up, I saw him over there. Has he been leaving you alone?"

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Oh, he hasn't so much as looked in my direction," the Cat Lady says
 to the Sheriff.

 "That's good," the Sheriff says. "I just wanted to check in with you.
 Will you tell me if you have more problems?""

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Dearie, you're a sweet man to check in on me," the Cat Lady puts her
 hand on the Sheriff's arm and he almost smiles.

 He pats her hand, "You take care of yourself Sharon, and make sure you
 call me if you have any problems." He talks briefly on his radio and
 then drives off, a little too fast for inside the trailer park. The
 Cat Lady unwinds the hose and continues watering her garden.

>examine lady

 She has a name, but you never can remember it, especially since both
 your mom and Honey call her the crazy cat lady behind her back. Is it
 Sharon? Shannon? And that's not all they call her. Honey says she is a
 crazy old B-I-T-C-H. But she's always been nice to you. Her makeup is
 a little bit too thick and she seems to wear a bathrobe at all hours,
 but you can see how she used to be pretty when she was young.

 "Oh, hello, dearie," the Cat Lady says, "So good to see you. Out for
 an adventure today?"

 Oh dogs, they absolutely terrorize my babies. Just the other day,
 several of my kitties had to defend their very lives from a ferocious
 doggy that someone brought in to the park on a leash. It served that
 bad dog right and he had to be taken to the vet.

>ask lady about cats

 "Oh my babies," the Cat Lady says, clasping her hands to her chest,
 "Joseph and I couldn't have children, but I always had a kitty. Then
 after Joseph was gone, I found a tiny scrawny yellow tabby kitten
 starving and mewling at my door one afternoon."

>again

 The Cat Lady is still going on.

 "I fed this little tabby cat and loved him. For a while, I didn't
 think he'd make it, but now he's my best friend in the whole world,"
 the Cat Lady says ruffling the head of the yellow tabby.

>examine tabby

 He is striped yellow and white like a tiger. A small one.

 "A few years ago, I found a one-eyed mama cat heavy with kittens
 living under my porch. She wouldn't let me get near her at first," a
 frown crosses her face, "Actually, she still won't let me touch her,
 but she had a whole litter of beautiful kittens, that I've fed and
 taken care of."

>wait

 Time passes.

 The Cat Lady looks at some of the cats running around, "I'm not sure
 where some of these darling kitties came from, but I love them, every
 one."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Won't you come in for a moment?" the Cat Lady gestures at her
 trailer, "I just love guests. And I do so enjoy talking to you."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cat Lady's Trailer</span>
 The first thing you notice is the smell of cat pee and rotten fish.
 Rose-tinted light comes slanting through the dingy ruffled curtains.
 The Cat Lady's Trailer is full of lace doilies, porcelain figurines,
 and most of all cats -- sitting, lying, prowling, and meowing. The
 little figures catch your eye.

 There are cats everywhere. The trailer is filled with cats of every
 size, color, and condition, many still pretty wild. Cats recline,
 stroll, and argue on every chair, couch, and table in her house.

>examine figures

 The house is full of this stuff. Especially little porcelain figurines
 of cats. On little shelves, in glass cabinets, everywhere. You notice
 one that looks exactly like Mika.

>examine mika

 It looks just like your cat Mika. It's white and black with all the
 spots in the right place. It even has Mika's one droopy ear.

 The Cat Lady comes into the trailer and sees you, "Hi, sweetheart."
 The tabby cat follows through the cat door.

 "Oh, how I love visitors. And you are such a dear heart," the Cat Lady
 says, looking at you in a way that makes you nervous. "I know! I know!
 Tea time! Let's have a little tea party." She clasps her hands to her
 chest.

>yes

 You need to specify who you want to speak to.

 "Oh, honey, won't you sit down?" the Cat Lady says, pointing at the
 half-buried kitchen table. "I'll get the tea ready." She bustles
 around at the sink, in her cupboards, and with the tea things.

 <span class="floydstyle em">A sudden thought: What if you are here talking to the Cat Lady and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">something happens to your Grandpa or Honey? Or worse, your mom? You</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">struggle to think about something else.</span>

>sit

 Where do you want to sit? There's a few choices: what was formerly a
 loveseat and Cat Lady's kitchen table.

 "Please, dearie, sit down." The Cat Lady fills the teapot from a
 kettle that she didn't bother to heat.

 "I love a tea party, don't you?" the Cat Lady asks, but leaves you no
 time to answer. "Tell me about your life, dear. What adventures have
 you had since we talked last?"

>sit on table

 You make yourself comfortable at the Cat Lady's kitchen table.

 You think you hear the morning train blowing its whistle way off in
 the hills.

 The Cat Lady fills your cup and her own from the teapot. "I'm terribly
 sorry, sweetheart, I don't have tea biscuits. I'm out right now," she
 looks accusingly at a particularly fat cat lying on a chair. "Sam got
 into the cupboard and ate every last one." You wonder that the cat can
 jump up on anything, let alone get into the cupboard.

>tell lady about adventure

 "Oh yes, dearie, I can see it now!" the Cat Lady says.
>tell lady about arm

 "How delightful!" the Cat Lady says as she gently removes a kitten
 trying to climb her like a tree.

>examine sam

 There are cats everywhere. The trailer is filled with cats of every
 size, color, and condition, many still pretty wild. Cats recline,
 stroll, and argue on every chair, couch, and table in her house.

 "Is your grandmother still mad at me?" the Cat Lady asks."She's been
 angry at me for years. Ever since I spoke up about her and Joseph's
 friendship." The Cat Lady is lost in thought.

>ask lady about joseph

 The Cat Lady looks wistful for a moment, "When my Joseph was alive..."
 and she just kind of drifts off and doesn't finish.

 One of a pile of kittens lazing in the sun falls off the ottoman.

>take kitten

 The Cat Lady's cats are nearly feral. That's a good way to lose an eye
 or a finger.

 You hear a train whistle in the distance.

 The Cat Lady looks serious. "Are things going okay with your new
 step-dad? Is that going okay?"

>no

 "Oh?" the Cat Lady frowns.

 A yellow kitten brushes up against your leg, but then darts off when
 you bend to pet it.

>give berry to lady

 "Oh, Bill's a nice man. He checks on me at least once a week," the Cat
 Lady says.

 "I didn't know your dad, honey, but I heard he was a very charming
 man," the Cat Lady says.

>ask lady about rachel

 "Your mom, sweetheart, you better treat her like an angel, because she
 is. You know she came and brought me soup when I had pneumonia? And
 went to the store and got me medicines.

 You hear the morning train whistle, loud and close, as it hits the
 crossing.

>ask lady about honey

 The Cat Lady looks a little uncomfortable, "Your grandmother is very
 beautiful," she says after a moment.

>ask lady about grandpa

 "Your grandfather is such a nice man," the Cat Lady says. "Just the
 other day, he helped me get Zoey out of the neighbor's tree."

 A stripey gray tomcat takes a growling swipe at a fluffy
 tortoise-shell.

>ask lady about me

 "Well honey, you are the sweetest child and my very favorite
 neighbor," the Cat Lady says patting you on the head affectionately.

 The tabby grooms itself carefully.

 The Cat Lady gestures at your cup, "Do you like your tea?" she asks.

>drink tea

 You bring the tiny teacup to your lips and drain it in a sip or two.
 The tea is lukewarm and watery, but okay.

 The Cat Lady re-fills both of your cups with more tepid tea.

 The Cat Lady leans toward you. "Tell me about your explorations. What
 about the train tracks?"

>throw rock at cat

 That seems like a really terrible idea. You think better of it.

 "Is your grandmother still mad at me?" the Cat Lady asks."She's been
 angry at me for years. Ever since I spoke up about her and Joseph's

 "Oh?" the Cat Lady frowns.

 The yellow tabby scratches its ear.

>leave

 You get off the Cat Lady's kitchen table.

 "Oh dear, it's been so nice talking to you. I can see you have to go,"
 the Cat Lady hugs you and pinches your cheek gently which makes you
 squirm. "You are growing so big. And so... such a lovely child," she
 says looking you up and down, embarrassing you.

 The D Loop of the trailer park is pretty much like the B and C Loops.
 Rows of trailers on either side, many fringed with teeny tiny gardens
 of flowers and shrubs. The most noteworthy thing on this loop is the
 Cat Lady's trailer, painted bright pink and white with an outrageously
 overflowing flower garden out in front.

 You can go to the C Loop on the way to Honey and Grandpa's trailer. Or
 you can go back to the picnic area at the back of the trailer park.

 Lee's trailer, though it looks pretty much like every other one.

 You can go to B Loop where Honey and Grandpa's trailer is, or you can
 go back to D Loop.

 Lee is sitting on a lawn chair in his empty carport, chain smoking.
 You think maybe Lee is your mom's age, but looks much older, like he's
 already lived a lot. He has long dirty blond hair pulled back in an
 untidy ponytail. He's wearing a tanktop and green army pants. Honey
 tells you to stay clear of him, but he always says hi to you politely
 and might be the only person you know who calls you by your name.

 "Hey, Jody," Lee says, "How you doin'?".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lee's Trailer</span>
 Lee's trailer is empty. Or nearly so. It looks like he moved in
 yesterday, but you know he's been here for a long time. Where is his
 furniture? There is a small table with a single chair. A tiny black
 and white TV on a crate. And that's about it.

>examine tv

 This is a tiny portable black and white set with a giant channel
 changer and bent rabbit ears propped on a crate.

 The TV is currently switched off.

 Lee comes in stubbing out his cigarette in an ashtray and says, "Hey,
 Jody."

 "So what's up in your world?" Lee asks. "Anything good? Oh, I have
 something for you."

 Lee is fumbling around in a drawer.

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Hey, make yourself comfortable," Lee says. "Mi casa, es su casa. That
 means 'My home is your home.' Do you want anything? A drink or
 anything?"

 It makes you freaked out to think of drinking or eating in Lee's
 trailer. You can smell a little alcohol on his breath like your
 step-dad.

 Lee is fumbling around in a drawer.

>ask jody for drink

 You does not respond.

 "Okay, so last time we were talking about my job. The one at the
 machine shop," Lee says. "I don't work there anymore, but I still have
 a friend who does, a guy who was in my unit."

 Lee is still looking for something.

>wait

 Time passes.

 "I told my friend that you really liked the ball bearing I gave you,"
 Lee is still fumbling in a drawer.

 "I told him you liked how shiny and heavy it was. And so,"  Lee seems
 to find what he's looking for and puts it behind his back. "He gave me
 this."

 He holds out a solid cube about the size of your hand. Not as shiny as
 the ball bearing, but with a beautiful metal sheen.  You want to hold
 it in your hand and feel its weight. You put out your hand and, for a
 moment, are scared Lee is going to snatch it back.

 But Lee puts the cube in your hand with a smile. It's heavier even
 than it appears.

>examine cube

 This is a solid metal cube about the size of your hand. It has very
 slightly rounded edges. Not as shiny as a ball bearing, but it's
 really pretty. It's considerably heavier than it appears.

 Lee watches you with evident enjoyment as you check out the gift.
 Suddenly you remember that you got in trouble for the ball bearing and
 your mom told you to give it back. And you didn't. Because you thought
 it would hurt Lee's feelings.

 <span class="floydstyle em">What will happen if your mom discovers this? You determine to hide</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the cube and not let her find out.</span>.

 You start to thank Lee, but he looks embarrassed even before you say
 it and cuts you off. "I wonder what's on the tube," He turns to the
 television and starts fiddling with the rabbit ears.

>throw rock at lee

 That seems like a really terrible idea. You think better of it.

 Lee switches the TV on.

 The little black and white TV is playing The Big Valley. This show is
 kind of like mom's soap operas, but in the wild west. There's a
 gunfight in the street and a girl in a saloon and some other stuff.

 "There's never anything really on. Don't know why I bother," Lee says.
 "Feel free to find something that you like."

>change channel

 You change the TV to channel 7.

 Guiding Light is on. At least this soap opera isn't in a hospital.
 It's a court room instead. But the people are still doing the same
 things, yelling at each other and crying and stuff.

>again

 You change the TV channel all the way around from 7 to 2, skipping 9
 since nothing is ever on.

 One Life to Live is on. There's a lady talking to a guy who doesn't
 know who he is or where he is.

>again

 You change the TV from channel 2 to channel 4.

 The Brady Bunch is on. You know this one. Bobby writes a book report
 about his hero Jesse James. Then in a dream, Bobby and the rest of the
 family are on a train, all dressed up old timey when Jesse James robs
 the train and shoots the family. Weird.

 Lee's TV is still playing The Brady Bunch.

>ask lee about cat lady

 Lee glances toward D Loop. "I don't have nothin' to say about that
 lady," Lee says, "but don't even get me started on her cats."

>ask lee about cats

 "Honestly, I don't mind cats. I like them really," Lee says, taking a
 long drag off of his cigarette. "They're independent. They're smart.
 They're survivors. They're only interested in people as long as they
 feed them." Lee glances toward D Loop.

>ask lee about rachel

 Lee is still talking.

 The Brady Bunch is still blaring on Lee's TV.

 "But over there," Lee says, "That's not a lady who loves cats. That's
 a lady who collects things. And it happens to be cats.

>ask lee about rachel

 Lee still has more to say.

 The Brady Bunch is on Lee's little TV.

 Lee is angry and stubs out his cigarette in a coffee can. "They're
 living things, man! They need to be loved. And petted. And each one
 needs a name and to be cared for and to feel unique in the whole
 world." He wipes his eyes angrily.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The Brady Bunch is still blaring on Lee's TV.

 "Sorry, I get carried away," Lee says. "I really like cats."

>ask lee about rachel

 "I know your mom. Rachel," Lee says seriously. "She's good people. I
 get people up in my face all the time. People avoiding me. Your mom,
 she smiles nicely at me and tells me hello.

 After a moment, he says, "I think you're pretty lucky. To have a mom
 like that."

>ask lee about nick

 "Yeah, I definitely don't know your dad," Lee says. "Is he around
 much? Do you see him ever?"

 Lee's TV is still playing The Brady Bunch.

>ask lee about step-dad

 "I don't know your step-dad, man," Lee says, "I heard him yelling at
 your mom once, but I'm in no position to criticize."

 The Brady Bunch is still blaring on Lee's TV.

>ask lee about mary

 "She seems like a pretty nice old lady," Lee says.

 Lee's TV is still playing The Brady Bunch.

>ask lee about me

 "What's to tell?" Lee asks. "You are one badass little trooper who
 ain't gonna let nothing get you down. Nah, you got 'em licked, believe
 me."

 The Brady Bunch is on Lee's little TV.

>ask lee about honey

 "I got nothing to say about your grandma," Lee says.

>ask lee about grandpa

 "I don't know your grandpa that well, but he's always cool to me," Lee
 says.

 The Brady Bunch is still blaring on Lee's TV.

 You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

 The Brady Bunch is on Lee's little TV.

 Lee's trailer is empty. Or nearly so.  There is a small table with a
 single chair. A tiny black and white TV on a crate. And that's about
 it.

 Lee is watching TV.

>out

 You give a wave to Lee as you go.

 "Alright, drop by any time, Jody," Lee says. "You take care of
 yourself. And don't let the assholes get you down," he adds with a
 wink.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">C Loop</span>
 C Loop is pretty much like B and D Loops. Rows of trailers on either
 side, all different colors. The most noteworthy thing on this loop for
 you is Lee's trailer, though it looks pretty much like every other
 one.

 You can go to B Loop where Honey and Grandpa's trailer is, or you can
 go back to D Loop.

>go b loop


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">B Loop</span>
 B Loop is just like C and D Loops, except Honey and Grandpa's trailer
 is right here, and if you say it really really fast -- B Loop B Loop B

 either side, some with big old cars, some not. Other than your
 grandparent's trailer, there's nothing really interesting here. Well,
 except for your bike.

 You can go in to Honey and Grandpa's trailer of course. Or you can go

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Honey and Grandpa's Trailer</span>
 This trailer feels comfy to you, as much home as your real home with
 your mom. Honey and Grandpa have lived here as long as you remember.
 All these things are touchstones of familiarity, the floral-patterned
 couch on which you and Grandpa cuddle and watch Bowling for Dollars,
 the big TV, even the brown carpeting with its mottled pattern that
 looks like lichen on rocks.

 Today all the windows are steamed up. Fragrant steam wafts from the
 kitchen. Occasionally, you hear the rattle of jars and lids being
 washed and set out.

 Your Aunt Mary is looming over the stove in the kitchen, stirring a
 huge vat of blackberry jam.

 "Oh hullo, dear," says your Aunt Mary, stacking jam jars and lids in
 the dish drainer.

>examine mary

 This is your Aunt Mary, or actually your Great Aunt Mary since she is
 your Grandma Honey's sister. She is a huge woman and wears an old lady
 dress with flowers and a checked apron. She is stirring the pot of
 blackberry jam continuously and staring into space.

>examine jam

 The pot of blackberry jam is bubbling blackly on low heat like the La
 Brea Tar Pits -- but better smelling. Aunt Mary is staring off into
 space and stirring the pot continuously. There are jam jars and lids
 set out ready to receive the jam when it is ready. Generally, Aunt
 Mary shoos you away when she is making jam.

>ask mary about lee

 "Who? Oh, Lee. Well, that young man, I can tell he's had a troubled
 life," she says. "You probably want to talk to your grandmother before
 talking to him. Though he's always been decent to me."

 Aunt Mary pauses for a moment from her jam making to talk to you, "You
 know your grandpa may need some company if he's bringing that bucket
 up here."

>ask mary about cats

 "Uh huh," Aunt Mary says distractedly.

 "Also, when you go down to the creek, ask your Grandpa and Grandma
 about lunch," Aunt Mary says. "I can make some sandwiches to send down
 with you."

>ask mary about lunch

 "Later we'll make some lunch for you and your Honey and grandpa," she
 says.

 "Why don't you hustle down to the creek and help your grandpa," Aunt
 Mary says and goes back to stirring the jam.

>go creek

 You hear a dog barking in the distance on the other side of the
 tracks.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">D Loop</span>
 The D Loop of the trailer park is pretty much like the B and C Loops.
 Rows of trailers on either side, many fringed with teeny tiny gardens
 of flowers and shrubs. The most noteworthy thing on this loop is the
 Cat Lady's trailer, painted bright pink and white with an outrageously
 overflowing flower garden out in front.

 You can go to the C Loop on the way to Honey and Grandpa's trailer. Or
 you can go back to the picnic area at the back of the trailer park.

 The Cat Lady is out in front of her trailer watering her tiny,
 overflowing garden. She is still wearing her bathrobe or a dress that
 looks like a bathrobe. There is a yellow tabby cat rubbing against her
 legs.

 You hear a dog barking in the distance on the other side of the
 tracks.

>again


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Picnic Area</span>
 At the back of the trailer park, there is a scraggly little picnic
 area with a patchy lawn that smells like mowed grass. A little cluster
 of tall trees is against the back fence.

 Along the road, is the rest of the trailer park starting with D Loop.
 Through the back gate are the train tracks.

 There is an impressive red ant hill near the picnic table. Two ants
 are working together to carry a seed that is bigger than both of them
 put together.

>again


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern Pacific Tracks</span>
 Railroad tracks cross the old dirt road here in a small rise. The
 tracks run alongside the trailer park fence in one direction and into
 a tunnel of green in the other. As you cross the tracks, you see a
 sign that says "Property of Southern Pacific."

 Across the tracks and through an open gate is the trailer park. Back
 the other way is the long dirt road gently sloping down along the
 creek.

 You can see a mound of rock here.

>again


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long stretch</span>
 This is a really long stretch of the dirt road. You can see the heat
 shimmering off of the ground. Grass grows up through the middle of the
 road, and deep rocky ruts suggest it hasn't been used as anything but
 river access for hikers and fishermen in a long time. The long road is
 alternately shaded by pines and exposed to the scorching sun. The air
 smells hot with a particular piney fragrance that always reminds you
 of the foothills of the Sierras.

 At one place along this long stretch, there is a trail zigzagging down
 the bank toward the swimming hole. Otherwise the dirt road goes on for
 a ways along the creek downstream until it crosses the railroad
 tracks. Back the other way is the end of the dirt road and the stone
 bridge.

 Along the road, in a clear stretch on the uphill side of the road, is
 an impressively tall pine tree that you've climbed before.

>again

 As you step out of the oppressive heat, the cool shade is a welcome
 relief.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Swimming hole</span>
 Down a long wooded trail that zigs down the bank, you emerge from the
 thick woods, and the trees open up to the sky. The swimming hole lies
 before you, a deep pool carved out of and surrounded by smooth granite
 rocks. It is big enough that you can swim like they taught you at the
 YWCA from one end to the other, and deep enough to dive off the rocks.

 It is possible to walk along the rocky shore downstream to another
 spot along the creek. Back up the trail leads through the woods back
 to the dirt road.

 There is a floating length of log here, bobbing around at the edges of
 the swimming hole.

 You can also see a deep pool here.

 From over by the blackberry clearing, you think grandpa's calling.

>go up

 As you step out of the shaded trail, the heat is like a physical force
 that pushes against you.

 Is that grandpa calling you?

>go bridge


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dirt Road</span>
 The dirt road slopes down as it runs along the creek before turning
 into a trail over the stone bridge. The old creekside road is seldom
 used now and in poor condition with deep ruts and sandy areas.
 Nowadays it is only used by people walking down to Bear Creek from the
 highway, fishermen and berry pickers mostly. Here, someone's field
 backs up to the road and is separated by a chain link fence. The field
 is a mass of tall weeds and old junk cars.

 The old dirt road continues on uphill for a long stretch running
 parallel to the creek downstream. Back toward the old stone bridge,
 the road narrows to a ragged trail as it crosses the bridge.

 There's a dog behind the fence, alternately digging and barking.

>throw rock at dog

 The dog barely dodges the rock, then erupts into a furious storm of
 barking.

 The dog is making a racket.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stone Bridge</span>
 The road may have crossed the creek over an old stone bridge at one
 time but is now just a narrow trail. From here you can peer down into
 Bear Creek. Movement in the sparkling water and the old mossy bridge
 catch your eye. You watch two leaves swirl by on the current.

 On one side of the bridge, the path turns out into a dirt road that
 runs down along the creek. On the other side, the blackberry trail
 goes up the creek back toward the berry picking spot. You can also get
 in the creek or go to a grassy bank from here.

 A dog barking can be plainly heard from across the river.

>go blackberry trail


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blackberry Trail</span>
 This is a trail running roughly parallel the creek with tall
 blackberry brambles on either side. In one place, there are Willows
 hanging down over the trail that tickle the back of your neck as you
 duck under them.

 It looks like the trail used to continue further on down the creek on
 this side, but is now hidden by underbrush -- though you could try to
 follow the lost trail. Farther on down the creek, the trail turns to
 cross an overgrown stone bridge. In the other direction, up the path,
 is the tangle of blackberry bushes.

 You hear grandpa calling you from the blackberry clearing.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blackberry Tangle</span>
 There are paths through the brambles, a maze with tantalizing fruit.
 Although this area is mostly picked since you and Honey and Grandpa
 came this way when you started picking this morning. You can still
 find some ripe berries though.

 Through the blackberry tangle, there's a trail going down along the
 creek shaded by lush green willow trees. Back the way you came is the
 clearing where Honey and Grandpa have been picking.

 Grandpa's calling you

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blackberry Clearing</span>
 You are near the creek, but it can't be seen through the blackberry
 brambles. This is a pleasant clearing carpeted with stubbly grass
 under a sycamore tree. There are paths and clearings beaten down among
 the brambles that allow you to squeeze in to get the ripest berries.
 There is a big bucket in the middle of the clearing. Grandpa's shirt
 and Honey's portable transistor radio are on the bank under the tree
 playing music.

 Along the path and down the creek, there's a tangle of blackberry
 bushes. Up the hill is the blackberry brambles where you've been
 picking for a while.

 Honey and Grandpa are here picking berries.

 The song "Lonely People" by America, one of your favorites, begins
 playing on Honey's radio.

 "Hey, Monkey," Grandpa says looking at you, "I'm gonna take this
 bucket of berries up to your Aunt Mary. You gonna help your old
 grandpa?"

>yes

 Grandpa nods.

>take bucket

 That's going to be pretty heavy. Better leave it for Grandpa to carry.

 "Okay, I'm headed back to the house, Ragamuffin. Why don't ya come
 with me?" Grandpa says. He picks up the big bucket with one hand that
 you probably couldn't even budge, and heads off down the trail toward
 the bridge.

>follow


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lost in the Brambles</span>
 This spot, a little ways from where Honey and Grandpa are picking, has
 some good berries. Under the pine trees, the air smells good.

 Looking around: The clearing where Honey and Grandpa have been picking
 is just down the hill from here.

 The sunlight comes slanting through the trees in the morning light.
 The air is still crisp in the shade with the early promise of a hot
 midsummer day.

 "She's your Honey's older sister. Did you know your Honey had twelve
 brothers and sisters. Let's see, you know Uncle Charley and Aunt Ethel

 After a DJ break, the nearby radio's playing "One of These Nights".

 quiet and keeps mostly to himself. I heard from your Aunt Mary that he
 was in Vietnam."

>ask grandpa about cat lady

 from your Honey and your mom. They're bad influences on you and I
 can't wait to tell them," he says with a smile.

 "I hope you don't call her that to her face," he says seriously.
 "Though she's a nice old lady and probably wouldn't even care."

>ask grandpa about cat sharon

 Grandpa is still talking.

 "Sharon's a nice old lady who's had a hard life. You be nice to her,
 Ragamuffin," Grandpa says.

>ask grandpa about Vietnam

 "War is not a lot of fun, I can tell you that," Grandpa says. "Even
 though I didn't see a lot of action in dubya-dubya-two like a lot of
 guys, it was a pretty brutal, mean time. Even for people like your
 Honey who were helping out here at home."

 On the nearby radio, a new song begins: "Wasted Days and Wasted
 Nights".

>ask grandpa about step-dad

 "Mark? He seemed like a nice enough guy when I met him, but..."
 Grandpa looks like he's going to get mad at you, "he better start

 have to answer to me. That's all I have to say."

 Grandpa catches up to you as you head toward B Loop.  "Alright, Speedy
 Gonzolas," Grandpa says, smiling.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Honey and Grandpa's Trailer</span>
 This trailer feels comfy to you, as much home as your real home with
 your mom. Honey and Grandpa have lived here as long as you remember.
 All of the familiar stuff, the couch and the TV are here.

 Today all the windows are steamed up. Fragrant steam wafts from the
 kitchen. Occasionally, you hear the rattle of jars and lids being
 washed and set out.

 Your Aunt Mary is looming over the stove in the kitchen, stirring a
 huge vat of blackberry jam.

 Grandpa catches up to you and comes into the trailer hauling the big
 bucket.  "Ah, to be young again," Grandpa says, smiling.

 "Mornin", Mary," Grandpa says as he comes in.

 "How's the berry picking?" Mary asks.

>examine jars

 Jars and lids and pots and pans and paraffin and tongs and boiling
 water. Who knew making jam was so complicated?

 "Pretty good," Grandpa says, gesturing at the bucket, "We got a whole
 bucketfull for you. Old Whistle Britches here, picked most of these
 and ate twice as many more." Grandpa winks at you.

 Grandpa helps your Aunt Mary pour the bucket of berries slowly into
 several giant pots with a series of juicy plops.

>wait

 Time passes.

 Your grandpa gets a big glass of water from the sink and drinks it.

 Aunt Mary turns to you, "Sweetheart, Can I get your help making
 lunch?"

>no

 "Oh, you don't say," Mary says vaguely, testing the jam by letting it
 run off the edge of a spoon.

>make lunch

 Aunt Mary already has you working on the assembly line making tuna
 sandwiches.

>tell mary about may day

 "Uh huh," Aunt Mary says distractedly, plopping paraffin into a double
 boiler to melt.

>ask grandpa about lunch

 "Isn't it just about lunch time?" your grandpa smiles. "You know me,
 you can set your watch to my stomach."

 Your Aunt Mary recruits you to help make lunch, getting out cans of
 Chicken of the Sea, Miracle Whip, and Wonder Bread.

>examine tuna

 Several cans of Chicken of the Sea, Miracle Whip, and Wonder Bread are
 out for making tuna sandwiches.

 "I better hustle back," Grandpa says, "before Ellie needs the bucket."
 Grandpa turns to you on his way out, "See you down there, Monkey."
 Grandpa heads out the door.

 Your Aunt Mary has you on the assembly line constructing tuna fish
 sandwiches and putting them in sandwich bags.

>take lunch

 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory

 You are carrying a metal cube, a rock, a penny, and a pail. And your
 hands are spotted with pine pitch, your ribs still ache, and your arm
 hurts a little. You are going to get in such big trouble.

 You pack all the sandwiches up in a brown paper bag, and Aunt Mary
 puts away the sandwich makin's. "Okay, you take those sandwiches down
 to your grandparents. All those blackberries they're picking. It's
 hungry work." Aunt Mary smiles.

>take bag

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Picnic Area</span>
 At the back of the trailer park, there is a scraggly little picnic
 area with a patchy lawn that smells like mowed grass. A little cluster
 of tall trees is against the back fence.

 Along the road, is the rest of the trailer park starting with D Loop.
 Through the back gate are the train tracks.

 There is an impressive red ant hill near the picnic table. Some of the
 ants have formed a line up the legs of the picnic table. Maybe they've
 found the remains of a picnic.

>examine ants

 The ants wander about purposefully, though you can't tell exactly what
 they are up to. There is a drop of something on the pavement that the
 ants are very interested in.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern Pacific Tracks</span>
 Railroad tracks cross the old dirt road here in a small rise. The
 tracks run alongside the trailer park fence in one direction and into
 a tunnel of green in the other. As you cross the tracks, you see a
 sign that says "Property of Southern Pacific."

 Across the tracks and through an open gate is the trailer park. Back
 the other way is the long dirt road gently sloping down along the
 creek.

 You can see a mound of rock here.

>go bridge


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long stretch</span>
 This is a really long stretch of the dirt road. You can see the heat
 shimmering off of the ground. Grass grows up through the middle of the
 road, and deep rocky ruts suggest it hasn't been used as anything but
 river access for hikers and fishermen in a long time. The long road is
 alternately shaded by pines and exposed to the scorching sun. The air
 smells hot with a particular piney fragrance that always reminds you
 of the foothills of the Sierras.

 At one place along this long stretch, there is a trail zigzagging down
 the bank toward the swimming hole. Otherwise the dirt road goes on for
 a ways along the creek downstream until it crosses the railroad
 tracks. Back the other way is the end of the dirt road and the stone
 bridge.

 Along the road, in a clear stretch on the uphill side of the road, is
 an impressively tall pine tree that you've climbed before.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Something is different. The hairs on your arm and the back of your</span>

 You can still hear the dog barking, of course.

 A dog barking can be heard somewhere down the road.

>go bridge


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dirt Road</span>
 The dirt road slopes down as it runs along the creek before turning
 into a trail over the stone bridge. The old creekside road is seldom
 used now and in poor condition with deep ruts and sandy areas.
 Nowadays it is only used by people walking down to Bear Creek from the
 highway, fishermen and berry pickers mostly. Here, someone's field
 backs up to the road and is separated by a chain link fence. The field
 is a mass of tall weeds and old junk cars.

 The old dirt road continues on uphill for a long stretch running
 parallel to the creek downstream. Back toward the old stone bridge,
 the road narrows to a ragged trail as it crosses the bridge.

 The dog is wandering in the road.

 The dog succeeded in tunneling under the fence and is now loose. It is
 sniffing the bushes alongside the dirt road. When it sees you, it
 stands in the road and growls.

 Kind of a yellowish medium dog with pointy ears. You don't know what
 kind. It's not a german shepherd or a doberman but it looks mean like
 that. Some kind of guard dog maybe.

 Looking more carefully, you notice that it has prominent teats. So
 it's a girl dog. Maybe she's pregnant or was. You are pleased with
 yourself for noticing. You know about this stuff because of Mika who

>go swimming hole

 As you step out of the oppressive heat, the cool shade is a welcome
 relief.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Swimming hole</span>
 Down a long wooded trail that zigs down the bank, you emerge from the
 thick woods, and the trees open up to the sky. The swimming hole lies
 before you, a deep pool carved out of and surrounded by smooth granite
 rocks. It is big enough that you can swim like they taught you at the
 YWCA from one end to the other, and deep enough to dive off the rocks.

 It is possible to walk along the rocky shore downstream to another
 spot along the creek. Back up the trail leads through the woods back
 to the dirt road.

 There is a floating length of log here, bobbing around at the edges of
 the swimming hole.

 You can also see a deep pool here.

>take log

 Too heavy.

 The sun is slanting down golden. Gnats are drifting in and out of the
 sunshine in sparkling clouds.

 You carefully navigate the rocky bank, making your way downstream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossing</span>
 Here the creek broadens out a little and, except for a place in the

 The shoreline ends at a steep bank further downstream, though it looks
 like you might be able to cross the creek on the boulders in
 midstream. You can also go back along the rocks upstream.

 You can go to B Loop where Honey and Grandpa's trailer is, or you can
 go back to D Loop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lee's Trailer</span>
 Lee's trailer is empty. Or nearly so.  There is a small table with a
 single chair. A tiny black and white TV on a crate. And that's about
 it.

 After a bunch of commercials, Another World is on. This is another
 soap opera that you don't know, not one of your mom's.

>examine table

 Like the rest of Lee's trailer, the table is mostly empty. On the
 table, a newspaper and a coffee mug.

>examine mug

 The mug has some kind of blue and yellow coat of arms on it, and says
 underneath in fancy letters "Brave and True." There is nothing in
 Lee's coffee mug except gross.

 The train whistle screams as it hits the crossing.

>take mug

 Your manners suggest that it is better to leave Lee's coffee cup
 alone.

>read newspaper

 This is the local newspaper. Usually when grandpa reads the newspaper
 or Honey does the crossword, you ask for the comics. An article on the
 front page catches your eye.

 Lee's TV is still playing Another World.

>read article

 Among the articles about a disaster in China (some dam broke and
 killed a lot of people), bombings in England, some stuff about
 Vietnam, and lots and lots of boring politics, there is a cool article
 about the Viking space probe! The first space ship to the surface of
 Mars! Will they find water? Martian people? (Unlikely. The orbital
 probes didn't see any sign of a Martian civilization.) There is a
 photo and a diagram of the Viking lander on page 3 and you memorize
 all the parts.

 You spend a few minutes thinking about being an explorer on the
 Martian surface, where you'd weigh less than half of what you do on
 Earth and would be able to jump high in the air like a superhero. If
 you could do that here, you would leap out of the trailer park, up
 into the top of the big pine tree.

>take newspaper

 Taken.

>examine chair

 Like the rest of Lee's trailer, the table is mostly empty. On the
 table, a coffee mug.

 Another World is still blaring on Lee's TV.

>exit


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">C Loop</span>
 C Loop is pretty much like B and D Loops. Rows of trailers on either
 side, all different colors. The most noteworthy thing on this loop for
 you is Lee's trailer, though it looks pretty much like every other
 one.

 You can go to B Loop where Honey and Grandpa's trailer is, or you can
 go back to D Loop.

>go swimming hole


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">D Loop</span>
 The D Loop of the trailer park is pretty much like the B and C Loops.
 Rows of trailers on either side, many fringed with teeny tiny gardens
 of flowers and shrubs. The most noteworthy thing on this loop is the
 Cat Lady's trailer, painted bright pink and white with an outrageously
 overflowing flower garden out in front.

 You can go to the C Loop on the way to Honey and Grandpa's trailer. Or
 you can go back to the picnic area at the back of the trailer park.

 The Cat Lady is out in front of her trailer watering her tiny,
 overflowing garden. She is absently humming to herself. There is a
 yellow tabby cat rubbing against her legs.

 The tabby grooms itself carefully.

>ask lady about creek

 "Well, I don't know, honey," the Cat Lady says.

 You hear a dog barking in the distance on the other side of the
 tracks.

>go swimming hole


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Picnic Area</span>
 At the back of the trailer park, there is a scraggly little picnic
 area with a patchy lawn that smells like mowed grass. A little cluster
 of tall trees is against the back fence.

 Along the road, is the rest of the trailer park starting with D Loop.
 Through the back gate are the train tracks.

 There is an impressive red ant hill near the picnic table. Two ants
 are working together to carry a seed that is bigger than both of them
 put together.

>examine seed

 You see nothing special about the seed.

>go swimming hole


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern Pacific Tracks</span>
 Railroad tracks cross the old dirt road here in a small rise. The
 tracks run alongside the trailer park fence in one direction and into
 a tunnel of green in the other. As you cross the tracks, you see a
 sign that says "Property of Southern Pacific."

 Across the tracks and through an open gate is the trailer park. Back
 the other way is the long dirt road gently sloping down along the
 creek.

 You can see a mound of rock here.

>take rock

 You pick up one of the rocks.

 A dog barking can be heard a ways down the road.

>take rock

 You pick up one of the rocks.

 A dog barking can be heard a ways down the road.

>inventory

 You are carrying three rocks, a newspaper, a tuna sandwich, a brown
 paper bag, inside which are two tuna sandwiches, a metal cube, a
 penny, and a pail. And your hands are spotted with pine pitch, your
 ribs still ache, and your arm hurts a little. You are going to get in
 such big trouble.

>take all

 tuna sandwich: Taken.

 A dog barking can be heard a ways down the road.

>take mound

 You pick up one of the rocks.

>take all rocks

 You pick up one of the rocks.

>go swimming hole


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long stretch</span>
 This is a really long stretch of the dirt road. You can see the heat
 shimmering off of the ground. Grass grows up through the middle of the
 road, and deep rocky ruts suggest it hasn't been used as anything but
 river access for hikers and fishermen in a long time. The long road is
 alternately shaded by pines and exposed to the scorching sun. The air
 smells hot with a particular piney fragrance that always reminds you
 of the foothills of the Sierras.

 At one place along this long stretch, there is a trail zigzagging down
 the bank toward the swimming hole. Otherwise the dirt road goes on for
 a ways along the creek downstream until it crosses the railroad
 tracks. Back the other way is the end of the dirt road and the stone
 bridge.

 Along the road, in a clear stretch on the uphill side of the road, is
 an impressively tall pine tree that you've climbed before.

 A dog barking can be heard somewhere down the road.

>go swimming hole

 As you step out of the oppressive heat, the cool shade is a welcome
 relief.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Swimming hole</span>
 Down a long wooded trail that zigs down the bank, you emerge from the
 thick woods, and the trees open up to the sky. The swimming hole lies
 before you, a deep pool carved out of and surrounded by smooth granite
 rocks. It is big enough that you can swim like they taught you at the
 YWCA from one end to the other, and deep enough to dive off the rocks.

 It is possible to walk along the rocky shore downstream to another
 spot along the creek. Back up the trail leads through the woods back
 to the dirt road.

 You can see a deep pool here.

>go swimming hole

 You look around again to see if you are alone. The path from the dirt
 road is deep forest and there is no one else at the swimming hole. So
 you carefully strip down to your skivvies, folding your clothes on the
 rocks. You leap in! Cold! But you get used to it, and it feels good.
 Actually, it feels great, as you swim around for a bit. When you get
 out of the water, you stand in the cool shade, and you get a sudden
 chill.
>take all

 tennis shoes: Taken.
 clothes: Taken.
 tuna sandwich: Taken.

>go downstream

 You leisurely gather your stuff and pull your clothes back on.

 You carefully navigate the rocky bank, making your way downstream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossing</span>
 Here the creek broadens out a little and, except for a place in the
 middle where the current is swift, there are big stones, boulders
 really, scattered about in the river.

 The shoreline ends at a steep bank further downstream, though it looks
 like you might be able to cross the creek on the boulders in
 midstream. You can also go back along the rocks upstream.

 A log has floated down the creek and is wedged between the boulders in
 the middle of the creek.

>go boulders

 You are able to hop from boulder to boulder until you get to the
 middle where there is a sizable gab and a swift current. You balance
 unsteadily on the driftwood bobbing in the current until you can hop
 to the nearest boulder on the other side.

 For a moment, it looks like your efforts might dislodge the drifting
 log and send it downstream. It totters unsteadily at the edge of the
 swift current before settling back against the boulders on either side
 of the gap.


 You made it across the creek.

 You look back at your precarious bridge. You can't believe you made it
 over the rocks and over that piece of driftwood! Yeah! Heck with that
 stupid dog.

 Now you can make it back to Grandpa and Honey. This is the other side
 of the river, an area you've never been, but you think it connects
 with the overgrown blackberry trail. it's darker here and a little
 cooler. The woods look kind of scary on this side, and it makes you
 anxious. But you remind yourself that trees are just trees, there is
 nothing to be afraid of in the woods.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Other Shore</span>
 You are on the far side of the creek where trees come right down to
 the water. A wooded trail goes into the forest.

 The creek here curves around in a funny way, but you're pretty sure
 that this trail is the same as the overgrown part of blackberry trail.
 That was this way, right? This trail is darker and more wooded, but it
 looks like it gets lighter up ahead. Back the way you came, you can
 get most of the way across the creek by hopping from boulder to
 boulder.

 A log has floated down the creek and is wedged in the boulders in the
 middle of the creek.

>go trail


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wooded Trail</span>
 You are on a wooded trail going back toward Honey and Grandpa's
 blackberry picking spot. You think. You're pretty sure. You hear the
 creek over there on your left. Or is that another little stream?

 Best to keep going to the blackberry trail. It should connect up here
 in a bit. You look back the way you came. You could always go back
 across the creek. But then there's the dog.

>go blackberry trail


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Woods</span>
 You are no longer sure where you are. The woods look familiar and
 altogether strange. It's difficult to get your bearings.

 Here there is a bright patch in the woods.

 Whew, in the distance you can just make out a giant fern. You can see
 trails leading into the woods, but you are no longer sure which one
 takes you back to either the other shore or to the blackberry trail.

>examine patch

 This is a bright patch in the woods with darker woods all around.

>examine fern

 You can't see any such thing.

>go fern

 You follow an uncertain path through the wood.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Woods</span>
 You are not completely certain which way to go. The woods look
 familiar and altogether strange. It's difficult to get your bearings.

 Here there is a giant fern.

 Okay, that looks familiar, just over there a huge madrone tree.

 Finally, your underwear is drying out.

>go tree

 They're not something you can enter.

>go madrone tree

 You bushwhack your way through the underbrush.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Woods</span>
 You are confused. The woods look familiar and altogether strange. It's
 difficult to get your bearings.

 Here there is a huge madrone tree.

 In the distance, there is a broad trail.

>climb madrone

 This is no time for that. You are feeling desperate to find your way
 back to your Honey and Grandpa. You fight back tears and push on.

 The afternoon shadows are lengthening and it is slowly getting on
 toward evening. You should be home by now. Honey and Grandpa will be
 worried. You fight back a brief wave of misery and trudge on.

 But it's no use. Part of the time you are pretty sure you are going in
 circles. The rest of the time you are scared you are getting lost
 deeper in the forest.

 For a while there, you felt you were close to finding your way back,
 but now everything looks completely unfamiliar -- and to be honest, a
 bit sinister. Like the forest is trying to <span class="floydstyle em">keep</span> you here, to
 lead you astray, lead you deeper into the woods. The trees lean in
 toward you. The underbrush grabs as your clothing.

 But no, that's stupid. You fight back panic. It's nobody's fault but
 your own. You should have been more careful, more observant. A good
 explorer scout would never get lost like this. Stupid stupid stupid,
 you berate yourself.

 Again, you think about your Honey and Grandpa at home. The smell of
 blackberry jam cooking. Watching TV on the floor with your grandpa.
 And your mom.  It's all too much.

 You have to admit it: You are hopelessly lost.

 You sit down right where you are and sob miserably.




 When your tears subside a little, you can't help thinking about the
 way the light sparkled under the water, how the Cat Lady, Sharon,
 seems so lonely even with all her cats, how the dog looked as she
 tried to squirm under the fence, how Lee is not so bad and maybe is
 your new friend, and how tiny everything looked from the top of the
 tallest tree in the world.

 You take stock of yourself: You are tired and miserable and scared.
 And your hands are spotted with pine pitch, your ribs still ache, and
 your arm hurts a little. You are going to get in such big trouble. But
 you are also perceptive, brave, resourceful, sweet, persistent, and
 unafraid. Maybe it will be okay.
