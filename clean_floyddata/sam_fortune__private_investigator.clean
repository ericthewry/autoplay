 Tonight's drama: The Case of the Missing Playboy!

 Sponsored by Muskrat Cigarettes.

 Folks, do you know that four out of five doctors recommend Muskrat
 Cigarettes for their patients who smoke? It's true! That's because
 Muskrat Cigarettes have been clinically proven to taste better, smoke
 smoother, and improve respiratory health! So the next time you crave a
 good smoke, choose Muskrat Cigarettes! You'll be glad you did.

 And now for Act I of tonight's drama....

 It was an afternoon much like any other afternoon. I was alone in my
 office. It seems I was always alone.

 Business had been slow. I was reduced to practicing my witty banter
 with my friends Jack and Daniel. Unfortunately for me, they weren't
 very much for conversation. We'd been conversing just long enough that
 I was beginning to feel that my banter really WAS witty. But not so
 much that I was beginning to think they'd talk back.

 Sam's Office
 You are Sam Fortune, a private investigator who, at the moment, has
 very little to investigate. Your office is on the fifth floor of a
 crummy old office building in the lower east side.

 There is a single dingy window in the west wall, directly opposite the
 only door.

 The sun streaming throught the Venetian blinds traces bars across the
 desk that sits in the middle of the room.  Bars like the bars of a
 prison cell.

 On the wooden desk are a bottle of whiskey and a telephone.

 A battered old filing cabinet stands in the corner.

 An old desk chair sits behind the desk.

 A plain guest chair is strategically placed in front of the desk.

>examine me
 Sam Fortune, private investigator and all American sap, is a pretty
 nice specimen if you do say so yourself. Six feet tall with broad
 shoulders and a jaw that could have been cut from a block of stone.
 It's no wonder that the dames go for you. If you were a dame, you would
 too.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>look through window
 Peering through the filthy grime reveals very little. Just the same old
 lonely street in the same old lonely part of town.

>examine bottle
 Tennessee's finest. Comfort in a bottle.

>exits
 The obvious exits are east and outside.

 (Use EXITS ON to enable the status line exit lister and EXITS OFF to
 turn it off.)

>examine desk
 (the wooden desk)
 It's a very plain wooden desk with a single shabby drawer. Someday
 perhaps you'll be able to afford mahogany.

>open drawer
 (the desk drawer)
 It's locked. Now if only you could remember where you put that key.

>remember key
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>think about key
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>look under desk
 (the wooden desk)
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine cabinet
 (the filing cabinet)
 The filing cabinet stands in the corner of the office. It has two
 drawers: a top drawer, and (you guessed it, pal) a bottom drawer. This
 is where you keep all your important files. In other words, it's mostly
 empty.

>open top drawer
 You open the top drawer of the filing cabinet, revealing some file
 folders marked A to M.

>examine folder k
 You see several file folders marked A to M in nearly alphabetical
 order.

 Thumbing to the file marked "K" you look inside and retrieve a small
 key which you place in your pocket.

>unlock drawer with key
 (the desk drawer with the small key)
 You unlock the desk drawer.

>open drawer
 (the desk drawer)
 You open the desk drawer, revealing a revolver.

>examine revolver
 Your best friend. It's just a shame that you don't actually have any
 bullets. Still, it's amazing how people can react to the mere sight of
 a heater.

>take it
 Just as soon as you pick up the revolver there is a quiet rap at the
 door.  You quickly put the revolver in your pocket.

 "Yeah. Come on in. The door's unlocked."

 The door opens and in walks a tall redhead with a knockout figure in
 the kind of outfit that shouts class.

 "Are you Sam Fortune?"

 "That's what it says on my birth certificate, doll. And just who might
 you be?"

 "My name is Irene Scarlet."

 "It's a pleasure, sweetheart. Why don't you have a seat?"

 "Thank you, Mr. Fortune."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>SAVE
>cf1

>give seat to woman
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine irene
 Irene Scarlet is quite a dish. Her red hair cascades about her
 shoulders in gentle waves. She wears a fashionably cut dress which
 shows off her delicious figure in a most delightful way.

>sit on desk chair
 You get onto the desk chair.

>close door
 That's already closed.

>ask irene about irene
 [Use TALK TO to interact with characters.]

>talk to irene
 Turning to Irene you say, "Hello there."

 She gives you one of those looks that makes you think she likes what
 she sees.

 Self-consciously you slide the bottle inside the desk drawer before
 getting down to business.

 [1] Ask her to have dinner with you.
 [2] Ask her what she wants.

>1
 "So, sweetheart, I hope I'm not being too forward but perhaps sometime
 you and I could get together over a nice hot meal. You interested?"

 Irene smiles just a little and says, "Perhaps some other time, Mr.
 Fortune, but just now I'm afraid that I'm here on business."

 [1] Ask her what she wants.

>1
 "So what brings a nice up-class dame like you to my little office?"

 "You're a private investigator aren't you?"

 "That's what it says on my license."

 "Well, I was hoping that I might use your services. You see, a friend
 of mine has gone missing."

 [1] Ask Irene about herself.
 [2] Ask about her friend.
 [3] Tell Irene your rates.

>1
 "So tell me a little about yourself. How do you fit into this picture."

 "Well, Mr. Fortune, my father is James Scarlet, the founder of Scarlet
 Herring, one of the more successful fishing operations in this town."

 "Oh THAT Irene Scarlet!"

 "Yes. That Irene Scarlet. Anyway, I've been friends with Bob for a very
 long time and when he didn't show up for our lunch appointment today I
 got worried. That's why I came to see you."

 [1] Ask about her friend.
 [2] Tell Irene your rates.

>1
 "Well, Red, tell me about this missing friend of yours."

 "His name is Bob Watterson. He and I go way back. He's one of the local
 society set. Anyway, we were out dancing at the Top Cat Club last night
 with some of our friends. Toward the end of the evening it looked as if
 something was bothering him but he wouldn't say what it was. I didn't
 think much of it until today. We had agreed to meet for lunch but,"
 stifling the merest hint of a sob, "but he never showed up!

 "Oh, Sam, I know you think I'm probably being silly but I'm worried
 about him. He never misses a lunch date and I'm just sure something has
 heppend to him. Say you'll help me find him."

 [1] Ask if she's gone to the police.
 [2] Tell Irene your rates.
 [3] Agree to take the case.
 [4] Decline the case.

>2
 "I charge $25 a day plus expenses. But I don't suppose that would be a
 problem for a dame like you."

 Irene says rather gravely, "No. That will be fine."

 [1] Ask if she's gone to the police.
 [2] Agree to take the case.
 [3] Decline the case.

>1
 "So, sister, something's puzzling me. Why come to me? Why not just go
 to the cops?"

 "Well, Mr. Fortune, first of all, it's only been a few hours and I was
 afraid that they wouldn't take me seriously with him only being missing
 for such a short time."

 "Yeah, I guess that figures. Go on."

 "And I was hoping to keep this kind of quiet. My family gets enough
 exposure as it is. That's what comes from having money. If I were to go
 to the police, well, I was afraid that the papers might catch wind of
 it."

 "And you'd find your name plastered all over the society pages...
 again."

 "Precisely."

 [1] Agree to take the case.
 [2] Decline the case.

>2
 After considering the matter you decide that you'd rather not get mixed
 up in all of this. "No dice, Red. I'm afraid that I'm just too busy to
 get mixed up with the upper crust these days. You see, I'm strictly a
 meat and potatoes kind of guy and all that champagne and caviar just
 doesn't agree with me. So if you'll kindly close the door on your way
 out, I'll return to my business."

 Irene looks shocked and for a minute a look of panic crosses her face
 before she...

 Your mother reaches over and switches off the radio. "I think that's
 enough radio for today. It's bed time and besides, all of that junk
 just rots your brain anyway."

 [2] Decline the case.

 "Sure, sweetheart. Don't worry, kid. I'll find him. You run along and
 I'll be in touch."

 Irene gets up and says "Thank you so much, Mr. Fortune." before giving
 you a small wad of bills for expenses and telling you her phone number.
 Then she gracefully heads for the door. On her way out she pauses and
 looks over her shoulder for a second, giving you a brief look at her
 misty blue eyes. Then, she closes the door and she's gone.

 "Well, Sam," you say to yourself. "Looks like you're gonna be dining at
 the Top Cat Club tonight."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   expense money
   a revolver

>open bottom drawer
 You open the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet, revealing some file
 folders marked N to Z.

>examine folder t
 You see a handful of file folders marked N to Z in mostly alphabetical
 order.

 You thumb through a few of the folders but nothing really catches your
 interest at the moment. Perhaps if you knew what you were looking for
 this would yield better results.

>examine folder s
 You see a handful of file folders marked N to Z in mostly alphabetical
 order.

 You thumb idly through a few of the folders before deciding that there
 really isn't anything helpful to your current situation.

 You thumb through a few of the folders but nothing really catches your

 You discover nothing of interest in the file folders marked A to M.

 marked N to Z?

>go north
 You had better leave those there. It took you nearly a full day the
 last time you had to sort them and you'd hate to have to do it again.

>phone Top Cat Club
 I only understood you as far as wanting to phone the top drawer of the
 filing cabinet.

>phone club
 You can't see any such thing.

>take phone
 Picking up the telephone you pause to consider your options.

 [1] Call Clancy at the 21st precinct.
 [2] Call the Times.
 [3] Call Irene.
 [4] Call the Top Cat Club.
 [5] Hang up.

>4
 You pick up the reciever and ask the operator to connect you to the Top

 d'. "Ziz is zee Top Cat Club. Can eye help you, monsieur?"

 [1] Ask when they're open.

 I left my office, walked down the four flights of stairs, headed
 outside and hailed a cab. I figured that if I wanted to get to the
 bottom of this, I'd need to go to where it all started.

 A few minutes later, the cab pulled up in front of a gleaming white
 high-rise building with one of those awnings over the revolving door.
 You know the kind. The kind that makes it seem like you're walking into
 the snout of an extremely large anteater. I took the elevator up to the
 15th floor and found myself standing outside the entrance to Tony
 Gabriele's famous Top Cat Club, the most upscale dinner club in town.

 It was time to earn my daily bread.

 [This might be a good time to save your game.]

 Top Cat Club Lobby
 The waiting area is done up in the art deco style, all white and
 silver. Beside the club entrance is a lectern where the ma?tre d' is
 greeting customers and checking reservations. On the lectern is a round
 white logo with the silhouette of a cat wearing a top hat. Peeking
 through the crowd, it's clear that the joint is jumpin' tonight.

 When you're ready to leave, the elevator awaits you to the south. The
 club itself is to the north.

 You can see some customers, the ma?tre d' and a lectern here.

 [1] Ask for a table.
 [2] Ask about Bob Watterson.
 [3] Say goodbye.

 You step in close and speak quietly so as not to be overheard.

 "I'm looking for a man named Bob Watterson. Do you know him?"

 "Oui, monsieur. I know 'im very well. 'e comes 'ere most frequently."

 [1] Ask for a table.
 [2] Ask when he saw him last.

 Top Cat Club
 You have to admit that this place is pretty swank. Like the lobby, it's
 all done up in art deco white and gleaming silver. The cavernous room
 is filled with tables, which in turn are filled with the
 upper-crustiest crumbs in this crummy city. There are so many tuxedos
 it looks like a penguin convention, and enough feathers to defrock a
 flock of ostriches.

 The central focus of the club is the dance floor, just south of the
 stage, which fills the entire north wall of the room. There is a small
 backstage door in the north wall, just to the side of the stage. A guy
 about the size of Mt. Rushmore guards the door.

 The bar is to the east. The lobby is south.

 You can see the backstage door, the stage, some customers, some tables,
 some dancers and a guard here.

 Someone at one of the far tables sings Happy Birthday.

 You hear the sound of someone opening the backstage door.

 The band stops playing and the bandleader steps up to the microphone.

 "Ladies and gentlemen. Once again, the Top Cat Club is proud to present
 the star of our show, Miss Ginger Andrews!"

 The crowd erupts into applause, the lights go down, a spotlight
 illuminates the stage door and the most stunning blonde you have ever
 seen steps into the light, sashays over to center stage and proceeds to
 make love to the microphone.

>examine ginger
 Wow! What a dish! Ginger Andrews is perhaps the most stunning blond you
 have ever seen. She stands about five foot seven and every inch a
 woman.  She wears a glittering backless dress with a plunging neckline
 that barely conceals an ample bosom. Her blue eyes are dazzling. And
 her shapely legs... Wow!

 Ginger's voice is heavenly as she sings a number from the Hit Parade.

>examine guard
 This guy looks like someone cross-bred a gorilla with a pit bull.

 Ginger holds every man spellbound as she reaches the climax of a
 devilishly provocative number.

>examine bartender
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine customers
 The place is packed with tuxedo wearing men and glittering women.

 Brother, that Ginger dame can really sing.

>examine backstage door
 You see nothing special about the backstage door.

 Ginger brings the crowd to tears with a steamy love song.

 When Ginger's act comes to a close the spotlight goes out, the audience
 applauds, the house lights go back up, and Ginger begins working the
 room, moving from one fat-cat to another. It's very clear what every
 man in the room wants and she's all too happy to dangle it in front of
 them without giving them any of it.

>talk to customers
 You strike up a conversation with some of the customers and try to
 steer it towards your missing man but it soon becomes apparent that
 this line is getting you nowhere. These guys aren't regulars.

 All eyes are on Ginger as she passes between the tables.

>talk to ginger
 Prying Ginger away from her adoring public you flash her what you hope
 is your most charming smile and say, "Hello there, beautiful. My name
 is Sam. Got a minute?"

 Ginger looks you over and says "Why not? Shoot, tough guy. What's on
 your mind? I mean besides that."

 [1] Compliment her singing.
 [2] Compliment her looks.
 [3] Ask her out.
 [4] Ask her about Bob.
 [5] Say goodbye.

 The band plays something from the Hit Parade.

>1
 "You have a very healthy set of lungs there, baby. Where'd you learn to
 sing like that?"

 "Sunday school, Sam. Sunday school."

 "Well you obviously had a first rate teacher."

 "That's very kind of you to say so, Sam."

 [1] Compliment her looks.
 [2] Ask her out.
 [3] Ask her about Bob.
 [4] Say goodbye.

 Someone in the back of the club laughs loudly.

>1
 "Baby, you are some piece of work. With a face like yours, I bet you
 have to circle the wagons whenever you so much as step outside."

 She smiles and says, "Flattery will get you everywhere, mister. You
 aren't so bad yourself."

 [1] Ask her out.
 [2] Ask her about Bob.
 [3] Say goodbye.

 One of the couples in the club starts to argue but it quickly passes.

>2
 "Hey, sweetheart, I'm looking for a friend of mine. His name's Bob
 Watterson. You know him?"

 "Who Bobby? Sure, I know him." She looks a little put off. You can't
 tell if it's because she's upset that you're not talking about her or
 if it's because she doesn't want to discuss her relationship with Bob.

 "Seen him around?"

 "Not for a while. Hey, I barely know the guy. Let's talk about you
 instead."

 You let her steer the conversation back around to your favorite topic
 for a while: Sam Fortune. It's plain that she's an expert when it comes
 to stroking a man's ego.

 [1] Ask her out.
 [2] Say goodbye.

 Someone from the crowd bumps into you and apologizes before continuing
 on.

>1
 "What time do you get off? How about you and me go somewhere for a
 drink?"

 "I'd like that, Sam, but tonight's bad for me. Come by tomorrow and ask
 me again will ya?"

 "Sure, kid. You bet."

 [1] Say goodbye.

 There is a brief lull in the music and the dancers return to their
 seats before the music starts and more take their places.

>1
 "See you around sweetheart."

 "Oh I'm sure you will, Sam. At least I certainly hope so."

 Ginger flashes a brilliant smile at a portly man who is old enough to
 be her father. It looks like he'll go home happy.

>enter backstage
 You can't, since the backstage door is in the way.

 Every man in the room watches as Ginger moves to another table.

>open backstage
 Man-mountain over there doesn't say a word, but he doesn't let you open
 the door either. If you want to get backstage, you'll have to somehow
 get rid of the guard.

 A customer laughs at one of Ginger's jokes.

>examine tables
 It looks like business is booming. Not a single table remains vacant.

 Ginger briefly dances with one of the customers before returning him to
 his previous partner.

>talk to guard
 You attempt to start a conversation with the guard but it quickly
 becomes obvious that conversation isn't his forte.

 Ginger's jewelry sparkles as she passes one of the stage lights.

>go east

 Bar Area
 On the east side of the club, set back from the main area, is the bar
 area. It's almost as crowded as the rest of the joint but there's still
 enough room for you to slide up next to the bar.

 You can see the stage, some customers, a bar (on which is a nut bowl
 (in which are lots of beer nuts)) and the bartender here.

 Ginger pauses to chat with a customer.

>get beer nuts
 You grab a handful of nuts from the bowl.

 Ginger's jewelry sparkles as she passes one of the stage lights.

>talk to bartender
 "Hi friend. Name's Jack. What can I get you?"

 [1] Ask for a drink.
 [2] Ask about Bob Watterson.
 [3] Ask about Tony.
 [4] Say goodbye.

 The band is playing some up-tempo dance number.

>1
 You consider asking Jack for a drink but then you think better of it.
 The last time you drank on the job you nearly wound up taking out a
 reservation in the city morgue.

 [1] Ask about Bob Watterson.
 [2] Ask about Tony.
 [3] Say goodbye.

 Someone from the crowd bumps into you and apologizes before continuing
 on.

>1
 "I'm looking for a guy named Bob Watterson. Ever heard of him?"

 "Yeah. Sure. I know him. Real snooty society guy right?"

 "That's the one."

 [1] Ask when he saw him last.
 [2] Ask if he knows anything about him.
 [3] Ask about Tony.
 [4] Say goodbye.

 One of the couples in the club starts to argue but it quickly passes.

>1
 "When did you see him last?"

 "He was here last night. He's here a lot actually. He bought a river of
 drinks for Ginger."

 [1] Ask if he knows anything about him.
 [2] Ask about Ginger.
 [3] Ask about Tony.
 [4] Say goodbye.

 The band plays something from the Hit Parade.

>1
 "What do you know about him?"

 "I see him a lot. He hangs around with the society set. Irene Scarlett
 and her friends."

 "So I hear. Can you tell me any details? Do you know where he lives?
 What he does?"

 "I think he has a penthouse apartment downtown somewhere. I don't think
 he does much of anything other than spend his old man's money."

 "You know who his 'old man' is?"

 "Naw. I just assumed he had one."

 "Yeah. Don't we all? Thanks, Jack."

 [1] Ask about Ginger.
 [2] Ask about Tony.
 [3] Say goodbye.

 There is a brief lull in the music and the dancers return to their
 seats before the music starts and more take their places.

>1
 "So what's the story with this Ginger dame?"

 "Quite the looker isn't she?"

 "Yeah. But can you tell me what she was doing with Bob last night?"

 "Other than accepting the drinks he bought her?"

 "Well, for instance, are they an item?"

 "What? Ginger and that guy? That'll be the day. Perhaps he thought so
 but I don't think she ever did."

 [1] Ask about Tony.
 [2] Say goodbye.

 Someone in the back of the club laughs loudly.

>1
 "So you been working here long?"

 "A few months."

 "Like it?"

 "Yeah. It's alright. It pays well and I get to enjoy the floor show
 every night. I can't complain."

 "This place is owned by Tony Gabriele isn't it? I hear he's a nice guy
 to work for. That true?"

 "Sure. Mr. Gabriele is good people. I don't care what anybody says. He
 might be a little peculiar but he takes care of his own. But look,
 Mack, what's it to you?"

 "Just curious. Who knows? I might want to work for him someday myself."

 "You thinking of taking up bar tending?"

 "Naw. Don't worry, Jack. You're job's safe."

 [1] Ask what he means by peculiar.
 [2] Say goodbye.

 The band is playing some up-tempo dance number.

>1
 "When you say Tony's peculiar, just what do you mean?"

 "Hey. You're gettin' awful nosey. Ain'tcha?"

 "I'm just naturally curious is all."

 "Well Mr. Gabriele don't like people meddling in his private affairs.
 If you get any more nosey, I'm liable to get fired and you're liable to
 get worse."

 "Okay. I get the hint. No need to get sore. Let's talk about something
 else then."

 [1] Make with the small talk.
 [2] Say goodbye.

 Someone at one of the far tables sings Happy Birthday.

>1
 "Busy night tonight."

 "Yeah. Ginger really packs 'em in."

 You go on like that for another minute or two before running out of
 pleasantries.

 [1] Say goodbye.

 Someone in the back of the club laughs loudly.

 "Thanks, Jack."

 "Don't mention it."

 Ginger pauses to chat with a customer.

>talk to ginger
 Prying Ginger away from her adoring public you flash her what you hope
 is your most charming smile and say, "Hello there, beautiful. Got a
 minute?"

 Ginger looks you over and says "Why not? Shoot, tough guy. What's on
 your mind? I mean besides that."

 [1] Say goodbye.

 The band plays something from the Hit Parade.

 "See you around sweetheart."

 "Oh I'm sure you will, Sam. At least I certainly hope so."

 Ginger briefly dances with one of the customers before returning him to
 his previous partner.

 In the nut bowl are some beer nuts.

 All eyes are on Ginger as she passes between the tables.

 (the beer nuts)
 Hard, round, and saltier than a sailor. These things are designed for
 one purpose only: to make you wish you had ordered a drink instead.

 A customer laughs at one of Ginger's jokes.

 cracked just enough that you might be able to get a peek inside. The

 Top Cat Club
 You can see the backstage door, the stage, some customers, Ginger
 Andrews, some tables, some dancers and a guard here.

 You step through the door and right into the back of the guard. He is
 none too happy to see you and pushes you back into the manager's office
 where three more thugs are waiting.

 "I caught this guy nosin' 'round backstage, boss. Whatdya want I should
 do wit 'im?"

 "Thank you, Rocky. You may leave him with us and return to your post."

 "Duh. OK Boss."

 The boss pulls out a .38 and points it at your chest while one of the
 other thugs grabs your arms from behind.

 The one with the gun says, "Well look what we have here boys."

 The one holding your arms says, "Looks like a spy, boss."

 The thin one with a face like a weasel says, "And look what I found in
 his pocket, boss." He holds your gun.

 "Mickey Boy, I think you better take Mr. Nosey for a ride."

 Soon you find yourself shoved in the back of a black sedan. Some
 fifteen minutes later you find yourself on a dark pier being fitted for
 a new pair of cement overshoes. They're a little tight but it doesn't
 matter. You won't notice them for long.

 Just then your mother reaches over and shuts off the radio. "Honestly,
 Junior. I don't know why you bother filling your head with all those
 silly detective stories. Now get off to bed."

 Top Cat Club
 You have to admit that this place is pretty swank. Like the lobby, it's
 all done up in art deco white and gleaming silver. The cavernous room
 is filled with tables, which in turn are filled with the
 upper-crustiest crumbs in this crummy city. There are so many tuxedos
 it looks like a penguin convention, and enough feathers to defrock a
 flock of ostriches.

 The central focus of the club is the dance floor, just south of the
 stage, which fills the entire north wall of the room. There is a small
 backstage door in the north wall, just to the side of the stage. A guy
 about the size of Mt. Rushmore guards the door.

 The bar is to the east. The lobby is south.

 You can see the backstage door, the stage, some customers, Ginger
 Andrews, some tables, some dancers and a guard here.

>talk to ginger
 Prying Ginger away from her adoring public you flash her what you hope

 "So, are you sure that you barely knew Bob Watterson?"

 She gives you a slightly annoyed look and says, "That's what I said.
 Isn't it?"

 "It's just that I happen to know that he was in your dressing room last
 night."

 Now you have her attention, "Really? And how would you know that?"

 "Never mind how. I know. And now he's gone missing and I thought since
 you were the last one I know who might have seen him perhaps you could
 help me out. You want to tell me about it?"

 A brief flash of anger crosses her face for just a second before she
 smiles at you all innocent like and says, "Alright, Sam. Sure. Bob came
 backstage after the show last night and we had a few laughs. He invited
 me over to his place after closing time. I went to meet him but when I
 rang, nobody answered the bell. I assumed I'd been stood up and went
 home."

 "Him? Stand up a dish like you? Oh, honey, I don't think that's likely.
 Tell me, where is this apartment of his?"

 "It's the penthouse at the Luxor building on the corner of 5th and
 Main."

 "Thanks, sweetheart. You've been a help."

 "Any time, Sam. Let me know if there's ever anything else, anything at
 all, that I can help you with."

 You think to yourself that perhaps it's time to check out Bobby's digs.

 Things were finally starting to get interesting. I still didn't know
 where this guy was but at least now I had some leads. Ginger said that
 she was supposed to meet him at his apartment and there was no way that
 I was about to believe that a mug like Bob Watterson was going to
 deliberately miss a date with a dame like Ginger Andrews. Clearly
 something must have happened to him. Perhaps I could find some clues at
 his penthouse.

 I rode the elevator back down to the street, hailed a cab and soon
 found myself at the corner of 5th and Main. It's a lovely part of town
 for lovely people. I took a few more steps and I was standing in the
 lobby of the Luxor Apartments, home of one Robert Watterson III.

 [This might be a good time to save your game.]

 Luxor Apartments Lobby
 The lobby of the Luxor Apartments is very posh but mostly empty,
 especially at this late hour. Interesting. It seems like every upscale
 establishment has a thing for chrome and the color white these days.
 Why is that? You wonder.

 The exit to the street is to the south. A door blocks your way north.

 You can see a front door and an intercom here.

>SAVE
>cf6
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine intercom
 The intercom is a panel set into the wall with a microphone and speaker
 and a row of four buttons: one for each tenant. It looks like there
 must be only one tenant on each of the four floors above the lobby
 because there are only four buttons. They're predictably numbered 2, 3,
 4, and 5. You remember that Bob's apartment is the penthouse. His must
 be button 5.

>push 5
 You push button 5 and wait for a response.

 No one answers. Bob must not be home.

>push 4
 You push button 4 and wait for a response.

 You have to push the button a couple of times before an old lady's
 voice crackles through the speaker. It sounds like you woke her up.
 "Who is it?"

 "It's me, granny. Can you buzz me in?"

 "Do I know you? Come back tomorrow."

>push 4
 You push button 4 and wait for a response.

 "I don't care who you are, you're not coming up at this hour.  Now
 please young man, go away before I call the police."

>push 3
 You push button 3 and wait for a response.

 You don't have to wait long. "Yeah? Whatdya want?"

 "It's me", you reply, "Buzz me in, will ya?"

 "Sure."

 There is a loud buzzing sound as the front door is unlocked and you
 push it open.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>enter door

 Ground Floor Entry
 This small hallway runs north from the front door and ends in a pair of
 elevator doors.

 You can see a front door, some elevator doors and an elevator call
 button here.

>push button
 You push the button and after a while the doors open.

 The buzzing stops and a soft click announces that the front door is
 locked again.

>enter elevator
 (the elevator doors)

 Luxor Apartments Elevator
 The elevator is clean and plush with a single set of doors along the
 south wall. Why can't your office be this nice?

 A small stool stands in the corner, next to the control panel. Usually
 the operator would sit there but it's so late that he's probably gone
 home.

 You can also see a control panel here.

>examine stool
 It's a simple wooden stool for the elevator operator to sit on.

>look under stool
 You find nothing of interest.

>get stool

>examine panel
 The elevator control panel looks simple enough that even a dope like
 you could use it. It's got five buttons marked Floor 1 through Floor 5
 on it.

>push 5
 You push the fifth floor button and the doors close.

 A few seconds later they open again.


>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>go south

 Penthouse Entry
 You're in a small, tastefully decorated entry room flanked by the
 elevator to the north and an apartment to the south.

 You can see some elevator doors (open), an elevator call button and Bob
 Watterson's front door here.

 It's a nice door but you don't notice anything special about it.

>open it
 You open the door. It's strange that he should leave it unlocked.

>go south

 Living Room
 Nice digs! Bob sure knows how to live. The living room is large and
 very tastefully decorated. Through an alcove to the west you can see a
 dining room. To the east must be the bed room. Going south, opposite
 the front door, will take you to some sort of an open garden area.

 A long, plush couch sits along one of the walls.

 A very large painting graces the wall across from the couch.

 A tropical fish tank sits underneath the painting.

 Beside the couch on a little end table is a radio.

 You can also see Bob Watterson's front door here.

>examine radio
 This is a very attractive tabletop model in a walnut frame.

 The radio is currently switched off.

>turn it on

 it's a nude portrait done in the cubist style.

 clean. You can't help but wonder if he has a maid.

 Anyway, there's a large window on the east wall which leads to the fire
 escape. The living room is to the west.

 The bed is along the south wall. It's one of those nice mahogany
 sled-style beds. King-size.

 Dining Room
 This room is big enough to hold quite the little soiree. Like
 everything else in this place, it's clean and expensive.

 The kitchen lies to the south and the living room is back to the east.

 In the middle of the room is a large oval dining table.

 You can also see six dining room chairs here.

>examine table
 It's a big table and it's pretty nice and all, but other than that it's
 rather uninteresting.

>examine chairs
 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine chair
 The dining room chairs are very nice. They match the table.

>go south

 Kitchen
 A well appointed kitchen is the hallmark of civilization. You can't
 remember who said that. Perhaps you just made it up yourself. Anyway,
 Bob's kitchen is neat, and clean, and almost empty. You're guessing
 that he eats out a lot.

 Along the west wall stands a large white refrigerator, happily humming
 to itself.

 Beside the fridge, running along the rest of the length of the wall, is
 a marble counter.

 On the marble counter is a knife block (in which are five knives).

 In the counter is a large marble sink.

>examine knife block
 It's a wooden block with slots for holding six knives. At the moment
 there are five knives in the knife block.

 Beside the Pool
 One of the fringe benefits of having a penthouse apartment is that part
 of your living space can be out doors. The south-eastern corner of
 Bob's apartment is devoted to a rooftop garden and swimming pool
 surrounded on all sides by a high brick wall. The setting is all quite
 nice but the thing that immediately attracts your attention is the
 stiff floating in the middle of the pool.

 On the south side of the pool, attached to the wall is a pool net.

 You can also see a swimming pool (in which are some water and a dead
 man) here.

>examine dead guy
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine dead man
 You see a dead man floating face down in the pool. A knife is sticking

 Fire Escape
 Standing in the chill night air on the fire escape, you can see all the
 way to the center of town. It's quite a view.

 The streets below are illuminated by red and blue flashing lights.
 Looks like the cops have the place surrounded.

 Hmm. The sirens have stopped. Perhaps they were going somewhere else.

>go down
 You rush down the fire escape but unfortunately, the cops are at the
 bottom waiting for you.

 There is a brief struggle as the cops surround you. By the time it's
 over, a few cops are sporting shiners and you've become intimate with a
 pair of handcuffs.

 The cops toss you in the back of a squad car and haul you downtown.

 After a brief stay as a guest of the local tax payers, you're brought
 up on charges. The rap is murder.

 You argue that you were set up but even Clancy can't help you now.

 "Come on, Clancy. You know me. You don't think that I did this do you?"

 "It doesn't matter what I'm thinking, Sam. That's for a jury to
 decide."

 Those words don't bring much comfort. Short odds are on a jury's being
 all too happy to believe that you did it, considering you were found
 sharing a room with a freshly stabbed corpse.

 "Off to bed, Junior" your mother says as she turns off the radio.

 "But ma! I need to know how Sam's going to get out of this one! Can't I
 please stay up a little longer?"

 "Sorry. You have school in the morning. You'll just have to ask your
 friends about it in the morning."

 surrounded on all sides by a high brick wall. The setting is all quite
 nice but the thing that immediately attracts your attention is the
 stiff floating in the middle of the pool.

 On the south side of the pool, attached to the wall is a pool net.

 You can also see a swimming pool (in which are some water and a dead
 man) here.

>examine man
 You see a dead man floating face down in the pool. A knife is sticking
 out of his back. It looks like he hasn't been here for very long. He's
 wearing a belt, a pair of pants and a dress shirt

>examine knife
 It looks like a kitchen carving knife. There's blood all over it.

>get net
 Taken.

>get body with net
 Using the pool net you fish the body out of the pool.

 The body is much too heavy to carry.

>get belt
 Taken.

>remove shirt
 (first taking the dress shirt)
 You'll have to remove the knife first if you want to get his shirt off.

>examine brick wall
 The wall surrounds the pool on the south and east sides, the sides that
 aren't blocked by the apartment itself. It's pretty high. Apparently
 Bob likes his privacy.

>get knife
 You pull the bloody knife out of his back, putting your fingerprints
 all over it in the process.

>undo
 Beside the Pool
 [Previous turn undone.]

>climb wall
 It's far to high for you to reach. Perhaps if you had something to
 stand on.

>examine pants
 Dress slacks. There's a back pocket.

>look in pocket
 (the back pocket)
 In the back pocket are a brass key and a wallet.

>get wallet
 Taken.

>get key

 Taken.

 Which do you mean, the brass key or the small key?

 Robert Watterson III. It's him all right.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 Dropped.

 In the distance, you can hear the sound of sirens.

>stand on stool
 You get onto the stool.

 The sirens seem to be getting louder.

>climb wall
 You can just barely reach.

 (getting off the stool)
 You climb up onto the top of the wall and look around. The view is
 fantastic from up here. It's marred only by the high tension wire that
 runs from the roof of Bob's apartment, passing over your head and
 descending to the roof of the building to the east.  From up here on
 the wall, it's just low enough for you to reach.

 No, you're sure of it now. The cops seem to be surrounding the
 building! Well, Sam, it looks like you've been set up!

>climb wire
 Try sliding down the wire instead.

 You'd better find a way out of here before they find you with Mr.
 Congeniality here.

>slide down wire
 Sliding down that wire with your bare hands looks like it would be
 pretty painful. Perhaps you could try sliding down the wire with
 something.

 Hmm. The sirens have stopped. Perhaps they were going somewhere else.

>slide down wire with belt

 I looped Bob's belt over the high tension wire and slid down to the
 roof of the adjacent building.

 It was just in the nick of time too. I could hear the cops running
 through the apartment behind me. "He's not here, Sarge. But there's the
 body. I guess that tip-off was on the level!"

 One thing was certain. I didn't need to continue looking for Robert
 Watterson III. He wasn't missing any more. Although I supposed someone
 might be missing him.

 What had I gotten myself mixed up in? The cops showing up just then was
 entirely too convenient. Somebody wanted me out of the picture and they
 wanted it bad. But who? I tried to make it all add up but so far all it
 added up to was a lot of question marks.


 Folks, that's the end of Act I of tonight's drama: the Case of the
 Missing Playboy.

 In a minute, we'll continue with Act II but first...

 Are you looking for the finest experience in smoking pleasure? Then you
 really owe it to yourself to try Muskrat Cigarettes. You see, four out
 of five doctors recommend Muskrat Cigarettes. That's because Muskrat
 Cigarettes are smoother, better tasting, and better for you! Indeed,
 recent studies suggest that smoking just one pack of Muskrat Cigarettes
 a day can improve respiratory vitality and provide you with more pep!
 So the next time you crave a fine smoke, reach for Muskrat Cigarettes.
 You'll be glad you did because remember:

 Nothing smokes like a Muskrat!

 And now: we bring you Act II of tonight's thrilling adventure of Sam
 Fortune and The Case of the Missing Playboy!

 I slipped down the fire escape of the adjoining building and darted
 through the darkened streets.

 I had to learn what was going on. I'd been set up, that much was clear,
 and while I wasn't sure who was responsible, I had some pretty good
 ideas.

 I decided to head back to my office for some more information. I knew
 that it was risky, what with every cop in the city out looking for me,
 but I had to chance it. I figured I could get what I needed and then
 get out before they wised up. I should have a little time before
 Clancy's pals came looking for me.

 My first order of business? I had to make a few phone calls.

 [This might be a good time to save your game.]

 Sam's Office
 Your office is on the fifth floor of a crummy old office building in
 the lower east side.

 There is a single dingy window in the west wall, directly opposite the
 only door.

 The sun streaming throught the Venetian blinds traces bars across the
 desk that sits in the middle of the room.  Bars like the bars of a
 prison cell.

 On the wooden desk is a telephone.

 A battered old filing cabinet stands in the corner.

 An old desk chair sits behind the desk.

 A plain guest chair is strategically placed in front of the desk.

 [4] Hang up.

 John Olsen's a friend of yours. He works the society desk at the Times.
 It's very late but you're betting he's still there after putting to bed
 the morning edition. Turns out your hunch was right.

 "What's stewing, Sammy?"

 [1] Ask about Irene.
 [2] Ask about Mr. Scarlet.
 [3] Ask about Bob Watterson.
 [4] Ask about the Top Cat Club.
 [5] Ask what he knows about Ginger.
 [6] Ask about recent police activity.
 [7] Chat with John for a while.
 [8] Hang up.

 "John, what can you tell me about Irene Scarlet?"

 "Irene Scarlet! The most fashionable belle at the ball. She is the
 queen of the society set. She carries herself with the grace of a movie
 star and she mingles with all of the most fashionable men about town.
 She's been keeping me in print for some time now. Is there something
 about her that I should know?"

 "Now, now, Johnny boy. Don't get over excited. I'm just asking."

 "Well, if you're running around with Miss Scarlet then you're in pretty
 rarified air. Her daddy's..."

 "Yeah, yeah. Her daddy's a millionaire."

 "Right. And what's his is hers, if you know what I mean. I only wish
 that she'd give us more to print about her than just who she was seen
 with where and when. The girl's as squeaky clean as the girl next door.
 More's the pity."

 "Well I hope I don't disappoint you when I say that's good news.
 Thanks, John. You've been swell."

 [1] Ask about Mr. Scarlet.
 [2] Ask about Bob Watterson.
 [3] Ask about the Top Cat Club.
 [4] Ask what he knows about Ginger.

 "What about Daddy Scarlet? What can you tell me about him?"

 "Well I'm sure you already know that he's made millions in fish."

 "Yes. But is there any dirt on the guy?"

 "No. He keeps pretty clean. The only thing fishy about him is his fish.
 His wife passed on several years back and he's devoted to his daughter.
 I hate to admit it but they actually seem to be a very nice family.
 Believe me, Sam. I haven't found even the hint of a scandal and it
 isn't for lack of trying."

 "Thanks again, John."

 [1] Ask about Bob Watterson.
 [2] Ask about the Top Cat Club.
 [3] Ask what he knows about Ginger.
 [4] Ask about recent police activity.
 [5] Chat with John for a while.

 "Hey, what about a guy named Bob Watterson. What do you know about
 him?"

 "Robert Watterson III. He's one of the society set. He spends money
 like it's his birthright, which it probably is. We see him a lot in the
 company of one Miss Irene Scarlet."

 "So they're an item are they?"

 "Could be. You know you never can really be sure with these society
 types. They tend to flirt with everyone and when they get really close
 to someone they tend to like to hide it from people like me."

 "Yeah, I can understand that."

 "Hey! Was that a crack?"

 "What else can you tell me about him?"

 "Not much really. He doesn't seem to have a job or anything. Just
 money. He's been buzzing around the society crowd with the other drones
 for several years now but nobody's really sure where he came from."

 "Well thanks, John."

 "Sure thing."

 [2] Ask what he knows about Ginger.
 [3] Ask about recent police activity.

 "What do you know about the Top Cat Club?"

 "The Top Cat Club. Center for overpriced entertainment catering to the
 rich and privileged."

 "Quite the popular spot, I'm given to understand. But I already knew
 that. Tell me something I don't already know."

 "Well, rumor has it that the owner, one Mr. Tony Gabriele, has ties to
 organized crime. Nothing's been proven of course but it seems pretty
 likely. I'm told that the police have been watching the place pretty
 heavy these days."

 "Now that is interesting. Can you tell me anything about Mr. Gabriele?"

 "Just that he's a very sharp dresser and he never goes anywhere without
 a couple of goons. I wouldn't get mixed up with him if I were you, Sam.
 People who do seem to wind up regretting it."

 "Yeah. Thanks for the tip, John."

 "The singer at the Top Cat Club?"

 up here. Since she's been here, every sugar daddy in town's been trying
 to hook up with her."

 "Any succeed?"

 "Johnny, I need you to tell me everything you know about Tony
 Gabriele."

 "Alright. Well you know he runs the Top Cat Club."

 "Yeah. Go on."

 "Well, he's also suspected of being connected with organized crime.
 Seems a lot of known mobsters like to visit the Top Cat Club whenever
 they're in town. The cops have been trying to connect him with
 operations in Chicago, Atlantic City, and a few other east coast towns.
 So far, they've been without luck, but they think it's only a matter of
 time before he slips up."

 "Yeah. That fits the picture, Johnny. What about legit business
 concerns?"

 "Well there's the club of course. And he also has a small warehouse on
 Pier 27 where he does some importing from the old country. He started
 the Top Cat Club with money he made through his import business."

 "Apparently some guy got bumped off and the cops got a tip-off about
 the killer. Seems they let him get away though because the radio's been

 down in his pool with a kitchen knife jammed into his backbone."

 they'd show up just as I was on the scene. Made it all nice and easy
 for them to jump to the wrong conclusions."

 "How can I help?"

 [1] Tell the cops I didn't do it.
 [2] Tell the cops I was with you.

 "Call the cops and tell them I didn't do it. Tell them that if they'll

 You're still not sure if you can trust Irene. After all, she got you
 mixed up in this and for all you know she could have been the one who
 set you up. Still, she seems on the level and you don't see as it
 matters much anyway. So you dial Irene's number. It rings a few times
 and eventually you're rewarded with the sound of her sleepy voice on
 the other end. "Hello?"

 "Hiya, Red.  It's Sam."

 [1] Tell her Bob's Dead.

 "Listen, doll, I've got some bad news. I found Bob Watterson."

 "But, Sam! That's wonderful!"

 "No. No it isn't. I'm afraid that he's dead."

 "Dead? Oh no, Sam! There must be some mistake!"

 "No mistake, sweetheart. I just got done not speaking with him. He was
 quite incommunicado."

 Irene starts crying and it's only with difficulty that she manages to
 say, "Oh, Sam! This is terrible! What happened?"

 "I'm afraid that someone killed him."

 "He was murdered?" Still sobbing. "But who would do such a thing? Bob
 never hurt anybody!"

 "I was kind of hoping that you could tell me.

 "Listen, sweetheart. I can't go into this over the phone but we need to
 talk. We have to meet somewhere so we can sort this out. I don't think
 we have much time."

 "Sure, Sam. Anything you say."

 "We have to be careful though. I've got half the city police force out
 looking for me, and whoever bumped off that friend of yours is probably
 after me as well. So we need to meet somewhere where we can be safe."

 "Where did you have in mind?"

 "We need somewhere where we can be sure that we're not overheard, but
 it's got to be somewhere public, somewhere where there'll be witnesses
 so someone will think twice before making a play for us. What's more,
 it's gotta be open at this late hour. Say! I've got it. The railway
 station! Meet me on the center platform in fifteen minutes."

 "Sure, Sam, I'll be there."

 [1] Tell him I didn't do it.
 [2] Ask him to call off the manhunt.

 "Now listen, Clancy. You know I didn't kill that guy. Right?"

 "Oh I don't know. Saints preserve us, Sam! We've got your fingerprints
 all over that apartment."

 "But surely you can't believe it!"

 "I must admit that I was rather shocked to hear you were implicated,
 Sam. You've always been a little lax with the law but you've never
 stepped over the line this far."

 "So call off your boys, Clancy. I was framed! Somebody set me up."

 "Sure you was, Sam. Now why don't you just come down to the precinct
 and tell me all of the details."

 "No dice, Clancy. You know I can't do that. Just give me 24 hours and
 I'll get your killer for you."

 "You know I can't..."

 "I gotta go, Clancy, but I'll be in touch. But remember, just 24
 hours."

 Your business concluded, you make for the door but upon opening it, you
 find yourself face to face with two rough looking thugs.

 "Well look who we have here, Mickey Boy!" says the one with the weasely
 face.

 "It looks like a rat, Flynn."

 "Pity he isn't caught in some trap somewhere. Isn't it?"

 "Heh. Yeah."

 You step back into the room as the two thugs burst in.  As you silently
 plan your next move, it occurs to you that you've heard these two
 voices before, through a door backstage of the Top Cat Club.

>talk to thugs
 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to mickey
 I don't think you're going to be able to talk your way out of this one,
 Sam.

 Mickey Boy says, "You know? The boss doesn't like it when people nose
 around in his affairs." Then he drives the point home with a swift
 punch to your gut that leaves your gasping for wind.
>punch mickey
 You hit Mickey Boy with your fist but he shrugs it off.

 Mickey Boy says, "When we're through with you, you'll wish you'd stayed
 in your office, gumshoe." He follows this with a lunge which you only
 barely avoid.
>hit mickey with whiskey
 You smash Mickey Boy with the bottle of whiskey and lay him out flat.

 Weasel Face Flynn says, That's a pretty face you have there. It'd be a
 shame if anything were to happen to it." Then he takes a swing at your
 face and nearly breaks your jaw. You nearly stagger to the ground
 before regaining your feet.
>shoot gun at flynn
 I only understood you as far as wanting to shoot the revolver.

>shoot flynn
 That's really rather pointless since you don't have any bullets.

 Weasel Face Flynn punches you in the solar-plexus, knocking the wind
 out of you. "Had enough yet?" he asks.
>hit flynn with stool
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a bottle of whiskey
   a brass key
   a wallet (open)
     an ID card

 Weasel Face Flynn says, "Don't know when to quit, do you?" Then he
 punches you in the kidneys, knocking you against the filing cabinet.
>hit flynn with gun
 You pummel Weasel Face Flynn with the revolver and lay him out flat.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 Sam Fortune, private investigator and all American sap, is a pretty

 Weasel Face Flynn is aptly named. He's a thin guy with a face like...
 well, you know. When he's not stretched out on the floor, he nervously
 shifts from one leg to the other as his eyes rapidly dart to and fro,
 which only serves to enhance the mustelidae family resemblance.

>search mickey
 Mickey Boy is the larger of Tony's errand boys. He's about six feet
 tall and well over 200 pounds. Not the sort you want to meet in a dark
 alley, or a deserted office building for that matter.

 Please press SPACE to continue.








 My encounter with Mickey Boy and Weasel Face Flynn made it pretty clear
 that Tony Gabriele was up to something.  I still wasn't sure what it
 was but by now I was pretty sure that Irene had nothing to do with it.

 Once again, I ducked down the stairs and headed out into the dark,
 lonely streets. It was well past midnight now and the streets were
 mostly deserted. I didn't dare risk grabbing a cab; instead I walked
 the few blocks to the train station to keep my appointment with Irene.
 Along the way I had to duck into a couple of alleys to avoid the
 occasional copper. The last thing I needed was for some flatfoot beat
 cop to earn a promotion on my account tonight.

 It wasn't long before I found myself in front of the station. Now all I
 had to do was slip inside, get to the center platform and keep my
 rendezvous with Irene.

 [This might be a good time to save your game.]

 Outside the Train Station
 The city train station is a big, imposing structure made by big men,
 designed to impress upon all the supremacy and majesty of the railroad.

 Southern Waiting Area
 You are standing on the south side of the cavernous room that makes up
 the main waiting area of the train station. During the day, passengers
 would fill this room with activity but at this hour it is mostly empty.
 You can see the room stretching out in front of you to the north. Far
 to the north you can just make out the set of stairs that descend to
 the platforms. Behind you, to the south, is the doorway that leads back
 outside.

 You can see one of the city's finest patrolling the room.  As long as
 you stay here near the entrance, you can probably avoid his gaze but
 you'll need to find some way to cross the room without attracting his
 attention.

 The policeman is patrolling the north end of the waiting area for now
 but it appears that he'll soon be heading your way.  It's probably best
 to wait here until you've learned his movements.

 You're halfway across the waiting area. There is a small gift shop to

 see the stairs to the platforms. An equal distance to the south, you
 can see the main entrance.

 You can see a policeman here.

 You turn up your collar and try to slip past the policeman but since
 you're nearly the only person in the station, he immediately moves
 toward you. You turn away but he chases after you and soon it becomes a
 foot race.

 Desperately, you dodge and weave but he blows his whistle and soon
 there are cops coming from all directions.

 There is a brief struggle as the cops surround you. By the time it's
 over, they've added assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest to
 your growing list of charges.

 The cops toss you in the back of a squad car and take you downtown.

 After a brief stay in the city slammer, you're brought up on murder
 charges.

 You try to convince Clancy to help you but the best that he can do is
 recommend a good lawyer.

 "Time for bed, Junior" your mother says as she turns off the radio.

 "But, ma! They just arrested Sam! Can't I please stay up a little

 "Sorry. You have school in the morning. You'll just have to ask your

 The waiting area is back to the east.

 In the corner of the gift shop is a magazine rack.

 On the magazine rack are a copy of Living Magazine and a copy of the
 Morning Edition News.

 On a shelf you can see one of those toy monkeys that dances and bangs
 its cymbals together when it's turned on.

 A snow globe with a model of the train station sits on one of the
 shelves.

 The policeman is patrolling the north end of the waiting area.

 The cover story of this issue is devoted to the European relief effort.
 I'm sure it's an interesting article but you really don't have time to
 read it right now.

 The policeman is crossing the center of the waiting area, heading
 south.

>read morning
 The headline is about president Truman's effort to promote the
 formation of some international organization called the United Nations.
 Below that is a brief story about the murder of Robert Watterson III.
 Most alarming is a police sketch of the chief suspect. They didn't
 quite capture your rugged jaw line correctly! You're going to have to
 have some words with Clancy's artist.

 The policeman is crossing the center of the waiting area, heading

 A model of the city train station sits inside a glass globe. Tiny
 snowflakes drift lazily around the globe whenever you shake it.
 Suspended above the station are the words "Wish You Were Here".

 The policeman is crossing the center of the waiting area, heading

>shake globe
 You give the globe a vigorous shake and little tiny snowflakes begin
 swirling around the little building. It's rather pretty really. It's
 not very useful though.

 Central Waiting Area
 The policeman arrives from the south.

 You turn up your collar and turn your back to the policeman as he
 arrives in the hopes that he wont recognize you but it's no good. He
 immediately recognizes you and blows his whistle.  Soon there are cops
 arriving from all directions.

 There is a brief struggle as the cops surround you. By the time it's
 over, they've added assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest to
 your growing list of charges.

 The cops toss you in the back of a squad car and take you downtown.

 After a brief stay in the city slammer, you're brought up on murder
 charges.

 You try to convince Clancy to help you but the best that he can do is
 recommend a good lawyer.

 "Time for bed, Junior" your mother says as she turns off the radio.

 "But, ma! They just arrested Sam! Can't I please stay up a little
 longer and hear how get gets out of it?"

 "Sorry. You have school in the morning. You'll just have to ask your
 friends about it at school tomorrow."

 Lower Level of the Train Station
 The lower level of the train station is a large space which opens on to
 three platforms.  Directly in front of you, to the north, is the
 central platform, to the north east is the east platform, and to the
 north west is the west platform.  Naturally, there are train tracks
 running between the platforms.

 There are numerous pillars supporting the high arched ceiling.

 The stairs that lead back to the waiting area are behind you, to the
 south.

 You can barely make out a figure on the central platform which you hope
 must be Irene.

 Between you and the central platform stands a policeman. You can only
 assume that he's looking for you.

 You are standing on the central platform, with tracks on either side of

 You can see Irene Scarlet here.

 The monkey is making a terrible racket.

>talk to irene
 Irene is lovelier than ever, her silky red hair cascading over her dark
 mink coat. You could fall for a dame like this in a big way! But you
 gather your thoughts and force yourself to focus on business. "Hello
 again, sweetheart."

 As she turns to face you, you can see that she's been crying.

 "Oh, Sam! What's going on? First you tell me Bobby's dead and now you
 ask me to meet you here, what does it all mean?"

 [1] Comfort Irene.
 [2] Tell her about Bob and Ginger.
 [3] Tell her about Mickey Boy and Weasel Face Flynn.

 "Irene, were you aware that Bob had a thing for Ginger Andrews?"

 "I had suspected as much but he never actually told me so."

 "Did you love him, Irene?"

 "We weren't in love if that's what you mean. But I loved him like a

 "You said before that something had upset Bob that night. Do you know
 what it was?"

 "No, Sam. I don't know."

 "I know he was backstage with Ginger for part of that evening. Do you
 think Ginger might have had something to do with it?"

 "Now that you mention it, I think it might have been. He was away from
 the group for a while and when he came back he was upset. Perhaps she
 said something to him to make him upset."

 "Yes, that or perhaps he overheard something he shouldn't have."

 [1] Comfort Irene.
 [2] Tell her about Mickey Boy and Weasel Face Flynn.
 [3] Ask what she knows about Tony.

 The monkey is making a terrible racket.

>3
 "What do you know about Tony Gabriele?"

 "Nothing, Sam. I didn't even know his name before tonight."

 "Well, he's a mob boss and I think that Bob accidentally overheard
 something that could have got him into a lot of hot water."

 [1] Comfort Irene.
 [2] Tell her about Mickey Boy and Weasel Face Flynn.
 [3] Tell her about Tony's warehouse.

 The monkey is making a terrible racket.

 "I hear that Tony has a warehouse down on Pier 27. I think that I'm
 going to have to check it out. There has to be something there that
 will pin this rap on Tony."

 "Oh, Sam! Be careful!"

 "Don't worry, sweetheart. I will. But listen, Red, do me a favor."

 "Anything, Sam."

 "I need to you give me about a half an hour. Then I need you to go to
 the cops and tell them that something's fishy at Tony's warehouse. That
 should give me enough time to case the joint. Even if I don't find
 anything, it probably wouldn't hurt to have the cops show up there
 tonight."

 "But what will I tell them?"

 [2] Tell her to tell the cops that you're there.
 [3] Tell her to report a burglary.

 I think he knows I was backstage earlier tonight. He must think that I
 overheard something I shouldn't have."

 "But how would he know that?"

 "Ginger must have told him. She's the only one who could have known I
 was back there. Even you didn't know that. They must have been
 discussing whatever they're up to while I was back there. Come to think
 of it, I'm sure I heard bits and snatches of it. He must think that I
 heard more than I actually did."

 "Sure, sweetheart. You be careful too. See you after the dust settles."

 Irene turned and left me standing alone on the platform. I waited a few
 minutes before sneaking out of the station by following one of the
 tracks.

 It didn't take me too long to walk the few blocks to Pier 27. It took
 even less time to find Tony's warehouse.

 I wasn't sure exactly what I would find but I was pretty certain that
 it wouldn't be canned herring.

 [This might be a good time to save your game.]

 Pier 27
 The pier is nearly pitch black at this early hour. In fact, the only
 light that you can see is coming from a high window in the warehouse in
 front of you. It looks like somebody must be home.

 Tony's warehouse is directly in front of you to the north. There is a
 dark alley to the northeast.

 A small sign beside the large metal warehouse door reads, "Gabriele
 Imports."

 I beg your pardon?

>SAVE
>cf11
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine warehouse
 (Gabriele Imports)
 Tony's warehouse is a large, utilitarian building that hangs on the
 side of the pier, allowing goods to be transferred by truck on one side
 and boat on the other.

>go northeast

 Dark Alley
 This narrow, dark alley runs beside the warehouse. Along the north side
 of the alley is a railing that overlooks the harbor. From the railing
 you can see a dock behind the warehouse.

 You can see several dark figures on the dock unloading crates from a
 boat that sits almost directly below you. You quietly hide in the
 shadows while the figures finish unloading the crates and after a few
 minutes they move inside the warehouse.

 A ladder leads from a gap in the railing at the end of the alley down
 to the water. The bottom of the ladder is only a step away from the
 boat.

>examine crates
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine boat
 The boat is almost directly below you. You could easily reach it by
 climbing down the ladder.

>go down

 Boat
 You are in a small power boat which is tied up to the dock behind the
 warehouse.  You can reach the dock by going west.

 A ladder leads from a gap in the railing at the end of the alley down
 to the water. The bottom of the ladder is only a step away from the
 boat.

 A small toolbox sits under one of the seats in the boat.

>examine toolbox
 You can't see inside, since the toolbox is closed.

>get it
 Taken.

>open it
 You open the toolbox, revealing a wrench, a hammer and a screwdriver.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a toolbox (open)
     a wrench
     a hammer
     a screwdriver
   a bottle of whiskey
   a brass key
   a wallet (open)
     an ID card
   expense money
   a revolver
   a small key

>examine ladder
 The ladder descends several feet from the edge of the alley above down
 to the water below.  The boat bumps up against it as it sways with the
 tide.

>get ladder
 That's fixed in place.

>go west

 Dock
 The dock extends from the back of the warehouse down to the water
 level. The warehouse is to the south. A boat is tied up to the east.
 The inside of the warehouse is dimly visible through the open wooden
 door.

>go south

 Warehouse Interior
 The large warehouse is filled with crates and boxes. There is a large
 metal door to the south that leads to the pier and a large door to the
 north that leads to the dock. There is also a smaller door to the west
 that appears to lead to a small office.

 Along one wall of the warehouse you can see a stack of crates that you
 recognize as the crates that were just recently being unloaded from the
 boat.

 From the next room you see a flickering shadow.

>examine crates
 You can't see inside, since the crates are closed.

 From the next room you hear muffled voices.

>open crates
 The crates are nailed shut. You try to pry off the top with your bare
 hands but your grip isn't strong enough for that.

 From the next room you hear elevated voices arguing.

>listen
 You listen closely and you hear a voice coming from the next room say,
 "Did you get everything unloaded from the boat?"

 "Yeah, boss. We got it all."

>listen
 You listen closely and you hear, "What are we going to do about that
 detective, boss?"

 "If we find him, you're going to kill him, Mickey Boy."

>listen
 You listen closely and you hear, "Good thing Ginger tipped you off to
 those two. Right, boss?"

 "And yet that detective is still making trouble, isn't he Weasel?
 Thanks to your incompetence."

 "Don't worry, boss. We'll get him."

 "You'd better."

>open crate with hammer
 (first taking the hammer)
 You loosen a few nails with the hammer and manage to pry off one of the
 lids.

 Pulling off the lid you find some tightly wrapped packages containing a
 substance which appears to be narcotics.

 It looks like Tony has been using his warehouse as a front for a drug
 smuggling operation.

 From the next room you hear movement.

 You think to yourself that Irene should have gone to the cops by now.
 With luck they should be arriving any minute. You might as well just
 hang around and wait for them at this point.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go west
 Don't go, Sam. It's probably best for you to just wait here until the
 cops arrive.

 From the next room you see a flickering shadow.

 Is that a car you hear or are you just imagining it?

>open metal door
 You walk boldly right up to the warehouse door and pull it open.
 Unfortunately, opening a large metal door makes an awful lot of noise,
 something which is particularly noticeable at this late hour. No sooner
 do you open the door when three men wearing dark suits and packing heat
 emerge from the nearby office.  You immediately recognize two of them
 as your friends Mickey Boy and Weasel Face Flynn. You assume the third
 must be Mr. Gabriele himself.

 Tony points a .38 at you and says, "Mr. Fortune, I grow tired of this
 little game you've been playing. I would have thought that by now you
 would have learned not to go where you are not wanted."

 "Yeah, well, I've never been too good at that."

 "That's really too bad. Mickey Boy, Flynn, take Mr. Fortune for a ride
 in the boat. I've had enough of his meddling."

 "Sure, boss."

 Before you have time to react, Mickey Boy clubs the back of your head
 with his pistol and you drop like a sack of beans.

 It's a pity that Sam wasn't awake for that early morning boat ride into
 the middle of the harbor. The sunrise that morning was particularly
 impressive. Unfortunately, the anchor tied to his feet and the water in
 his lungs made sure that he would never see it.


 Ladies and gentlemen. That concludes tonight's episode of Sam Fortune -
 Private Investigator, sponsored by Muskrat Cigarettes.

 Tune in next week for our brand new series...

 Your mother clicks off the radio as you stare with your mouth open in
 disbelief.

 "I don't understand, ma! How could they kill off Sam? He can't die!"

 "Now, Junior. It's just a radio program. Perhaps the ratings weren't

 I heard the sound of the large metal warehouse door being opened.  Tony
 and his two thugs come running out of the office only to find five
 large policemen waiting for them.  It didn't take but a moment for them
 to realize that they were outnumbered. The jig was up.

 I stepped out of the shadows and said, "Officers, I'm glad to see you.
 I think you'll want to take a look at what's in those crates over
 there. I think you'll discover that Mr. Gabriele and his stooges here
 have just received a large supply of narcotics. The other night Bob
 Watterson overheard them discussing this shipment and he must have been
 foolish enough to mention it to Ginger Andrews. She told Tony and he
 decided that they needed to shut him up. When I started digging around,
 they saw an opportunity to get rid of him permanently and pin it on
 me."

 Suddenly a dark shape with flowing red hair ran into the warehouse and
 threw her arms around me.

 "Sam! You're OK!"

 "Yeah, sweetheart. I'm just swell. You did good. You and Clancy's boys
 showed up just in time."

 I bent over and gave Irene a long passionate kiss.

 "Baby, we make a pretty good team. What say we blow this joint and go
 find somewhere to get better acquainted?"

 "Yes, Sam. I think I'd like that very much."


 Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes Act 2 of tonight's drama: The Case
 of the Missing Playboy.

 Sam Fortune: Private Investigator will return next week with an all new
 adventure but right now, stay tuned for Little Miss Abbey which will be

 Nice digs! Bob sure knows how to live. The living room is large and

 A long, plush couch sits along one of the walls.

 A very large painting graces the wall across from the couch.

 Outside the Train Station
 The city train station is a big, imposing structure made by big men,

 The columned behemoth of a building lies to the north, the gigantic
 entrance perched atop a short but magnificent flight of stairs like the
 entrance to some Greek temple.

>go north

 Southern Waiting Area
 You are standing on the south side of the cavernous room that makes up
 the main waiting area of the train station. During the day, passengers
 would fill this room with activity but at this hour it is mostly empty.
 You can see the room stretching out in front of you to the north. Far
 to the north you can just make out the set of stairs that descend to
 the platforms. Behind you, to the south, is the doorway that leads back
 outside.

 You can see one of the city's finest patrolling the room.  As long as
 you stay here near the entrance, you can probably avoid his gaze but
 you'll need to find some way to cross the room without attracting his
 attention.

 The policeman is patrolling the north end of the waiting area for now
 but it appears that he'll soon be heading your way.  It's probably best
 to wait here until you've learned his movements.

>go north

 Central Waiting Area
 You're halfway across the waiting area. There is a small gift shop to
 the west and some ticket windows to the east. Far to the north, you can
 see the stairs to the platforms. An equal distance to the south, you
 can see the main entrance.

 The policeman arrives from the north.

 You turn up your collar and turn your back to the policeman as he
 arrives in the hopes that he wont recognize you but it's no good. He
 immediately recognizes you and blows his whistle.  Soon there are cops
 arriving from all directions.

 There is a brief struggle as the cops surround you. By the time it's
 over, they've added assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest to
 your growing list of charges.

 The cops toss you in the back of a squad car and take you downtown.

 After a brief stay in the city slammer, you're brought up on murder
 charges.

 You try to convince Clancy to help you but the best that he can do is
 recommend a good lawyer.

 "Time for bed, Junior" your mother says as she turns off the radio.

 "But, ma! They just arrested Sam! Can't I please stay up a little

 Central Waiting Area
 You're halfway across the waiting area. There is a small gift shop to
 the west and some ticket windows to the east. Far to the north, you can
 see the stairs to the platforms. An equal distance to the south, you
 can see the main entrance.

 You can see a policeman here.

 You turn up your collar and try to slip past the policeman but since
 you're nearly the only person in the station, he immediately moves
 toward you. You turn away but he chases after you and soon it becomes a
 foot race.

 Desperately, you dodge and weave but he blows his whistle and soon
 there are cops coming from all directions.

 There is a brief struggle as the cops surround you. By the time it's
 over, they've added assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest to
 your growing list of charges.

 The cops toss you in the back of a squad car and take you downtown.

 After a brief stay in the city slammer, you're brought up on murder
 charges.

 You try to convince Clancy to help you but the best that he can do is
 recommend a good lawyer.

 "Time for bed, Junior" your mother says as she turns off the radio.

 "But, ma! They just arrested Sam! Can't I please stay up a little
 longer and hear how get gets out of it?"

 "Sorry. You have school in the morning. You'll just have to ask your
 friends about it at school tomorrow."

 Gift Shop
 This is a small gift shop that sells various items to waiting
 travelers. Curiously, the shopkeeper seems to have stepped out.
 There's no one here.

 The waiting area is back to the east.

 In the corner of the gift shop is a magazine rack.

 On the magazine rack are a copy of Living Magazine and a copy of the
 Morning Edition News.

 On a shelf you can see one of those toy monkeys that dances and bangs
 its cymbals together when it's turned on.

 A snow globe with a model of the train station sits on one of the
 shelves.

 Northern Waiting Area
 You are standing on the north side of the waiting area. Far to the
 south, across the huge room, you can see the entrance to the building.
 Below you, to the north, you can see the stairs that descend down to
 the platforms.

 The policeman is patrolling the south end of the waiting area.

 Stairs to the Lower Level
 You're standing at the top of the flight of stairs leading down to the
 platforms.

 To the south, you can see the whole of the waiting area. You're well
 concealed so there is no fear of being spotted by the policeman who is
 patrolling there. Down and to the north, you can just make out part of
 the lower level of the train station.

 The policeman is crossing the center of the waiting area, heading

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 Lower Level of the Train Station
 The lower level of the train station is a large space which opens on to
 three platforms.  Directly in front of you, to the north, is the
 central platform, to the north east is the east platform, and to the
 north west is the west platform.  Naturally, there are train tracks
 running between the platforms.

 There are numerous pillars supporting the high arched ceiling.

 The stairs that lead back to the waiting area are behind you, to the
 south.

 You can barely make out a figure on the central platform which you hope
 must be Irene.

 Between you and the central platform stands a policeman. You can only
 assume that he's looking for you.

>drop monkey
 Dropped.

>turn on monkey
 You switch on the toy monkey, slide it across the floor and duck behind
 a pillar.

 The policeman sees the toy monkey and moves to investigate. Now's your
 chance Sam!

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>sleep with monkey
 Ary you crazy Sam? He's distracted! Now's you chance! Don't spoil it!

 The monkey is making a terrible racket.

>go north

 Central Platform
 You are standing on the central platform, with tracks on either side of
 you leading north into the darkness.  Behind you, to the south, you can
 see the policeman examining the monkey with a puzzled look on his face.

 You can see Irene Scarlet here.

 The monkey is making a terrible racket.

>sleep with irene
 Are you deliberately trying to get us into trouble with the FCC?

 The monkey is making a terrible racket.
