    The hiking trip across Europe has been a wonderful experience for
 two recent college graduates like yourself and your friend Carolyn.
 From the mansions of England to the beaches of Greece, you've walked in
 the footsteps of the Crusaders and seen sights that few Americans have
 ever seen.

    Carolyn had wanted to skip the Central European nation of Rylvania.
 "Why bother?"  she'd said.  "There's nothing but farmers there, and
 creepy old castles - nothing we haven't seen already.  The Rylvanians
 are still living in the last century."

    That, you'd insisted, was exactly why Rylvania was a must-see.  The
 country was an intact piece of living history, a real treasure in this
 modern age.

    If only you hadn't insisted!  As night fell, as you approached a
 small farming village in search of a quaint inn to spend the night, the
 howling began.  A scant hundred yards from the village, and it
 happened...the wolves appeared from the black forest around you and
 attacked.  Big, black wolves that leaped for Carolyn's throat before
 you could shout a warning, led by a great gray-black animal that easily
 stood four feet at the shoulder.  Carolyn fell to the rocky path, blood
 gushing from her neck as the wolves faded back into the trees,
 unwilling, for some unknown reason, to press their attack.

    If she dies, it will be your fault.  You curse the darkening sky as
 you cradle Carolyn's head, knowing that you have little time to find
 help.  Perhaps in the village up the road to the north -

 Winding Path

    The main road is a north-south trail - little more than a dirt path
 - winding through a black, dismal forest.  To the north, through the
 trees, you can barely make out the lights of a small Rylvanian village.
 The sun has just set and dark trees hang over the path, forming a
 mazelike net overhead.  The path is well trodden and easy to walk on.

    Carolyn, your close friend from college, lies motionless on the
 path, blood flowing freely from a gaping, jagged wound in her throat
 and chest.  She's making faint gurgling sounds and just barely
 breathing.

 You'd better not move Carolyn without professional medical help.

>go north
 Path Fork

    You are standing at a fork in the path, just outside a village.  To
 the west the trees thin out slightly, while to the east they disappear
 entirely, becoming an impassable swamp.  Branches of the path run north
 and northeast.  To the north you can see several buildings.  The track
 runs south as well, back into the forest.

>go north
 Outside Inn

    You are standing outside a wooden inn at the west end of a small
 Rylvanian village.  Flickering light streams from an open window, and a
 sign hangs above the doorway.  The inn has seen better days - it's
 run-down and falling apart, and could use a good coat of paint.  A path
 runs south, out of town, and more buildings are down the street to the
 east.  To the west is more of the black forest.  The inn is to the
 north.

 In gothic script the sign reads "The Devil's Cup."

>go north
 Common Room

    The inn is well-lit, less shabby on the inside than on the out.  A
 warming fire burns in the hearth.  Several townsfolk are seated around
 a table, talking quietly, and a thin old man stands behind the bar.
 The townsfolk and the barman look up as you enter, suspicious of
 strangers - as are all Rylvanians - but soon the patrons turn back to
 their conversation and the barman returns to polishing glasses.  The
 exit from the inn is south, and an open doorway behind the bar leads
 west.

    A tarot deck is sitting on the table.

    Some of the townsfolk turn and nod briefly at you before continuing
 their conversation.

    The old barman regards you silently.

    You catch a fragment of conversation.  "...written on the trees..."

>tell barman about Carolyn
 The bartender shakes his head and points at his mouth.  "Foreigner!"
 one of the patrons shouts at you.  "Old Henri is mute!  He cannot speak
 to you."  The customer smiles.  "But he knows what you need, if you
 have the money.'

    You catch a fragment of conversation.  "...written on the trees..."

 The bartender looks at the check, then smiles and shakes his head,
 passing the check back to you.

    "They walk tonight," one of the customers whispers.

>tell patrons about wolves
 The customers eye you suspiciously.  "Yes.  The wolves roam the woods.
 The old woodcutter that lives out there might know more about them."

    You catch a fragment of conversation.  "...the doctor knows..."

 One of the customers glances up at you.  "Yes, we have a doctor.  He
 lives further down, on this side of the street."  He jerks his thumb to
 the east, then falls quiet for a long moment.  "I don't know if you
 want him as your doctor, Foreigner.  He is a strange man."

    "They walk every night," a customer snaps, drinking heavily from a
 stone flagon.  "Every bloody night.  Our village is cursed."

 Village Road West

    You are walking on a road through the center of the village.  The
 street is quiet and empty; most of the local populace has already
 turned in for the night.  Silence weighs heavily on the town, and the
 air is cold and leaden.  To the north is a small square wooden
 building.  The door to the building is open. To the south is an open
 field.  The road continues to the east and west, and a branch runs
 southwest as well - toward the black forest.

>go east
 Village Road East

    You are near the eastern outskirts of the village.  To the south is
 a stately old church, weathered and in a state of disrepair.  The
 entrance to the church stands open.  To the north a narrow track runs
 along the side of the small wooden building you passed to the west.
 The road continues west and also runs northeast, out of town and
 through the moors.

 Doctor's Office

    You are inside a small office which appears to belong to the local
 doctor.  It's small and dark, but clean.  A chair and a desk are the
 only furniture.  The exit is south, back through the doorway.  One
 small window in the east wall looks out on an alley.  Hanging on the
 wall is a framed diploma.  The door stands open, and the window is
 closed.

    A middle-aged man is here.  "Hello," he says pleasantly.  "I am
 Doctor Trolovitch."

>tell doctor about Carolyn
 The doctor nods hurriedly.  "Yes, of course.  I can help.  Take me to
 her, and I'll do all I can."

    Doctor Trolovitch waits, staring at you expectantly.

    Doctor Trolovitch checks the door to his office, making sure it's

    You are standing outside a wooden inn at the west end of a small
 Rylvanian village.  Flickering light streams from an open window, and a

    Doctor Trolovitch follows you.

>go west
 Black Forest

    You are lost among the twisted, gnarled trees of the black forest.
 The trees close in around you and the air is damp and cold.  Somewhere
 off in the distance a lone wolf howls.  Owls hoot, and a faint
 scrabbling under the leaves hints of tiny creatures of the night,
 searching for food.  You can travel in almost all directions.

    Doctor Trolovitch follows you.

    Doctor Trolovitch follows you, looking around.  "Is this where you
 claim your friend to be?"  he says irritably.  "I see no patient."  He
 shakes his head.  "I would think one of your age would be beyond these
 childish pranks."  He turns and walks back toward town without a word,
 leaving you to wonder what could have happened to Carolyn.

>go south
 Inside Church

    You are in the main hall of the village church.  To the north is the
 exit to the village road.  Pews, facing south, line both sides of the
 center aisle.  A brass basin sits atop a stone pillar near the north
 exit.  An altar is at the far end of the room, near a low passage which
 leads south to another part of the church.  Moonlight streams through
 the stained glass windows, bathing the wooden pews in a ghostly glow.

    The brass basin seems to contain some holy water.

>examine pews
 The pews are hard wooden benches.  They face south, toward the altar.

>look under pews
 There's nothing, not even some leftover chewing gum.

>examine windows
 The stained glass windows are typical Rylvanian church design.  Most
 portray Saint William of Irdopest, the patron saint of Rylvanians.  A
 few show more typical Christian scenes - the Christ child, Jesus on the
 cross, and so forth.  They're quite pretty, but hard to see in the pale
 light.

>go south
 Church Vestry

    You are behind the altar in the church, in a small chamber that
 serves, judging from the hooks on the walls, as the church's vestry.
 Other than the hooks, the chamber is empty now.  To the north is the
 main part of the church.  An open doorway leads out of the church to
 the east, and beyond, you can see the town graveyard.  A ladder leads
 up into darkness.

    A cloak is hanging on the wall hooks.

 The water looks normal to you.  You're not a religious expert, so if
 you take the water from the basin, it probably loses any special
 properties it might have.

 You can't move the stone altar.

>go up
 Belfry

    You are standing in the church belfry, a tiny tower above the
 vestry.  Far above you, shrouded in cobwebs and gloom, you can just
 make out a large bell attached to the roof.  Dangling from the bell is
 a thin iron chain.  Pale light filters in through narrow windows in the
 stone walls, and a chilling breeze whips through the tower.  The only
 exit is down the ladder, back to the vestry.

    You see a flyswatter here.

>take all
 flyswatter:  Taken.

>pull chain
 You pull on the chain and ring the bell.  A deep tone resounds through
 the tower, shaking the church to its very foundations.  A few bats fly
 out of the bell, shrieking angrily.  For a moment, they appear to be
 diving at you, but then they swerve and dart out one of the narrow
 windows.

>again
 You pull on the chain and ring the bell.  A deep tone resounds through
 the tower, shaking the church to its very foundations.

>climb chain
 You grab the chain and try to hoist yourself up.  Far overhead, the
 bell rings loudly, shaking the walls of the belfry as you try to climb
 the iron links.  Unfortunately, the chain is too thin to climb; you
 can't seem to get a good grip on it.

 Graveyard South

    You are at the southern end of the church graveyard.  Some
 headstones are shrouded in low-lying fog, while others are partially
 hidden by the long grass. It's obvious that the graveyard, like the
 church itself, hasn't been taken care of for some time.  A few old
 stunted trees mark the boundaries to the south and east.  To the west
 is a side entrance to the old church, and further to the north, you can
 see more headstones and an old mausoleum.

>read the trees
 I don't know how to read the trees.

>read stones
 You push aside the grasses and read the names on some of the
 gravestones:

    "Elijah Vilovitch 1745-1795"

    "Tomis Rasarivin 1760-1782"

    "Maryana Olgrisson 1747-1770"


>go north
 Graveyard North

    You are at the north end of the graveyard.  To the west is the old
 church; an entrance is further along the wall to the south.  To the
 north is an ancient iron fence some twelve feet tall.  To the east is
 an ancient mausoleum, with a few words etched in the stone above the
 entrance.  Several gravestones are scattered amongst the weeds here.

>read mausoleum
 I don't know how to read the mausoleum.

>examine weeds
 The weeds are stunted and dying.  They cling to life around the
 scattered graves.

>open mausoleum
 You grunt and strain, but can't open the mausoleum gate.  It seems to
 be locked.

 It's a twelve foot tall fence, made of wrought iron.  It bars passage

>go north
 Alleyway

    You're standing next to a small wooden building to the west.
 There's a small window on this side, but otherwise the building's wall
 is featureless and uninteresting.  To the north and northeast are
 impassable moors and swamps, and to the south is the main road.  The
 alley is littered with trash and debris.

>search trash
 It's just typical alley litter - paper and the like.  You find a
 leaflet lying amidst the debris, which you take.

>go northeast
    You walk out of town, heading out into the moors.  Your mind wanders
 to Carolyn, and the recent strange turn of events.  Where could she
 have gone?  Is she dead?  Can you still save her?  Where did Doctor
 Trolovitch go?

    The moors are dark and cold.  A light rain is falling and the
 rumblings of far-distant thunder reach your ears.  A flash of
 lightning, and suddenly, she is there.  Carolyn - dressed in a white
 robe, standing before you on the fog-covered fen!  Stunned, you run
 toward her, calling her name.  She smiles, arms outstretched, reaching
 for you.  And then you are there, hugging her, crying - and noticing
 how cold she is, how pale - how very dead.  Her mouth opens in a jagged
 smile.  Cold, bone-white pointed teeth reach for your neck.  You cry
 out as her canines puncture your throat - and go limp as your lifeblood
 pumps into her mouth.  The world turns black -



    You dream.

    The dreams are endless and horrifying.  You are alive, then dead,
 then floating in a formless void, then somehow alive again - but not
 alive.  You have changed - you can tell.  You are no longer human.  You
 struggle out of blackness and find yourself enclosed in wood -


>knock
 What do you want to knock on?

 Nothing happens.

    A gnawing hunger is wracking your body.  An icy chill grasps your
 stomach.

    Somewhere far above you, you hear faint scraping.

 You push open the coffin lid.  A man leaps back from your newly-opened

    A man in priest's robes is cowering beside the headstones.

 hands and gaze into his eyes.  He's beautiful, and the throbbing pulse
 in his neck is somehow hypnotic.  You bend in for a closer look - and
 sever his jugular with newly-sharp canines, feeling his hot blood on
 your tongue, feeling it wash over your throat in a sensual orgy of
 smells and tastes.  The priest grows limp in your arms and soon you let
 him fall, dead.  You have killed for the first time - but your chilling
 hunger is sated.

 *** Your score has just gone up.  ***

 Graveyard North

    You are at the north end of the graveyard.  To the west is the old
 church; an entrance is further along the wall to the south.  To the
 north is an ancient iron fence some twelve feet tall.  To the east is
 an ancient mausoleum, with a few words etched in the stone above the
 entrance.  Several gravestones are scattered amongst the weeds here.

    One grave has been dug up, and at the bottom of the hole is an open
 coffin.

    You see a dead man here.

>search man
 The man's throat has been torn open - a ghastly, gruesome sight.  He's
 been totally drained of blood.  His broken body lies beside the open
 grave.  From his clothing, you surmise that he was a Catholic priest.
 Perhaps you should bury him.

>put man in grave
 Which grave do you mean, the hole, or the gravestones?

>hole
 I don't know how to put anything into the hole.

>put man in hole
 I don't know how to put anything into the hole.

>bury man
 Somehow, you don't feel quite right about burying the priest in your
 grave; you feel you might need the coffin again.  You dig a shallow
 grave in a shadowy corner of the graveyard and roll the priest into it,
 pulling bits of sod and leaves over the body.

>look

>go south
 Graveyard South

    You are at the southern end of the church graveyard.  Some
 headstones are shrouded in low-lying fog, while others are partially
 hidden by the long grass. It's obvious that the graveyard, like the
 church itself, hasn't been taken care of for some time.  A few old
 stunted trees mark the boundaries to the south and east.  To the west
 is a side entrance to the old church, and further to the north, you can
 see more headstones and an old mausoleum.

>go west
 You approach the church door, but suddenly, a strange pain seizes your
 gut.  You double over in agony, and are forced to stop.

>go north

 You easily scale the fence and head toward the moors.

 Moor Path

    You are walking along a lightly-travelled path that wends its way
 through the dark, misty moors of Rylvania.  The trail curves here,
 continuing to the southwest and the northwest.  The rain is picking up
 now, and the thunder and lightning are getting closer.  South of here
 is the church graveyard, covered with a blanket of fog and mist.  To
 the north, you hear the sounds of rushing water, but I wouldn't stray
 from the path if I were you - the bogs are deadly.  The village is back
 to the southwest.

>fly
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>turn into a bat
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>become bat
 I don't know the word "become".

>examine me
 Your skin is pale and cold to the touch, your canines are long and
 pointy, and you feel very strange.  You seem to have become a vampire.

>go northwest
 Moor Crossroads

    You are standing at a fork in the path through the moors.  To the
 east a short path slopes down to the river, while another track
 continues through the fens to the west.  To the southeast, the road
 heads back through the moors toward the village.  To the northwest the
 way becomes drier and the terrain begins to rise - the path in that
 direction leads up the side of a low hill.  There's a tall signpost
 here.

    Sitting on top of the signpost is a raven, preening its feathers.

>examine sign
 The signpost has three signs.  One points northwest and reads "Gloomfen
 Castle."  The second points southeast and reads "Gloomfen Village."
 The third points west and reads "Deadly Moors - Be careful!"  There's a
 large raven sitting atop the post.  It eyes you suspiciously.

>examine raven
 It's a large black raven, a bird of ill-omen.  It gives you the chills,
 but appears to be quite harmless.

>ask raven about raven
 Surely, you can't think the raven knows anything about it!

>talk to the raven
 Please refer to your manual and/or README file for the proper syntax to
 use when talking to people or objects.

>ask raven about moors

>pet raven
 Touching the raven doesn't seem to have any effect.

>go west
 Moor Clearing

    The road from town ends here in a clearing, a dry spot in the
 endless bogs and moors.  To the north you can see a rocky hill, atop
 which is a dark stone castle shrouded in mist.  The only safe path
 through the bogs leads east, back toward the crossroads.  A faded Gypsy
 tent sewn from once-bright colorful cloth stands to the west, its flap
 open.  Stuck in the ground near the tent is a wooden sign.

>read sign

>SAVE

>go west
 Inside Tent

    Moonlight filters through the thin cloth, bathing the dim interior
 of the tent in subtle shades of blue, green, and red.  The interior of
 the tent is empty save for a low table.  The exit is to the east.

    There's a wizened old woman here, pacing the tent and muttering to
 herself.  She looks up as you enter, and frowns.  "Well?  What do you
 want?"

>ask her about my fortune
 I don't know the word "fortune".

>ask her about the truth
 I don't know the word "truth".

    The road from town ends here in a clearing, a dry spot in the
 endless bogs and moors.  To the north you can see a rocky hill, atop
 which is a dark stone castle shrouded in mist.  The only safe path
 through the bogs leads east, back toward the crossroads.  A faded Gypsy

>go northwest
 Rocky Trail

    The terrain is rockier here than further down toward the village,
 and the land slopes gently upward to the north.  Further north, up a
 mountain, you see the stark stone towers of Castle Gloomfen, the
 ancestral home of the Von Rhistoven family.  The trail runs from the
 north to the southeast.  Other directions appear too rocky for easy
 travel.

>go north
 Edge of Gorge

    You're standing on the edge of a rocky gorge, which is to the north.
 The bottom is lost somewhere deep in the mists, but far below, you can
 hear water crashing on the rocks.  The trail ends at the edge of the
 gorge.  A thick rope spans the chasm, vanishing into the swirling fog.
 The trail leads back down the hill to the south.

>go north
 You put one foot on the rope, but it's just too slippery.  If you try
 to cross you'll plunge to your death.

 River Bank

    You're standing on the bank of a slow muddy river.  There's nothing
 but more bogs and swamp on the other side.  A dank mist drifts low
 across the rolling waters, dancing across the rippling rapids and
 lightly caressing the riverbank. The ground is muddy and soft here;
 your feet sink into the black earth.  Reeds wave gently in the cool
 night breeze.  A winding path leads across solid ground back to the
 west.

 The dying reeds bend gently in the chilling breezes.

>go southwest
 Village Road East

    You are near the eastern outskirts of the village.  To the south is
 a stately old church, weathered and in a state of disrepair.  The
 entrance to the church stands open.  To the north a narrow track runs
 along the side of the small wooden building you passed to the west.
 The road continues west and also runs northeast, out of town and
 through the moors.

    The night is alive now; you can't believe you didn't notice before
 how bright the stars were, how the shadows on the ground contrast
 sharply with the bright village lights around you.  Your senses are at
 a peak, and you feel flushed with dark purpose.

    The smell of hot blood beckons you to the north.  You can almost
 sense the man's thoughts - and they're not thoughts that you're happy
 to share.  Whoever lurks to the north has a sinister motive; he's a
 thief, and he's killed before himself.

>go north
 Alleyway

    You're standing next to a small wooden building to the west.
 There's a small window on this side, but otherwise the building's wall
 is featureless and uninteresting.  To the north and northeast are
 impassable moors and swamps, and to the south is the main road.  The
 alley is littered with trash and debris.

    A sinister-looking man is lurking near the window, fiddling with the
 shutters.  He glances in your direction as you approach, his eyes
 narrowing, trying to spot you in the gloom.  "Who's there?"  he
 whispers.  When you fail to respond, he turns back to the closed
 window, trying to see how it opens.  You can taste his hot blood,
 drifting to your newly-sensitive nostrils on the brisk winds that blow
 off the moors.

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

>watch man
 I don't know the word "watch".

>eat man
    Emerging from the shadows, you pounce on the hapless thief.  He
 cries out only once - and then, your teeth find his neck.  Slowly,
 savoring the warm flavors, you lap the blood from the gaping wound.
 The thief begins to grow limp in your grasp, his face pale.  Suddenly,
 with a last burst of strength, he tears away from your grasp and runs
 out onto the moors, screaming.  Your prey has escaped, but the
 all-consuming hunger tearing your guts is sated - for the moment.

>look in window
 The window's shutters are closed.  You can't see a thing.

 The road continues west and also runs northeast, out of town and

>go west
 Village Road West

    You are walking on a road through the center of the village.  The
 street is quiet and empty; most of the local populace has already
 turned in for the night.  Silence weighs heavily on the town, and the
 air is cold and leaden.  To the north is a small square wooden
 building.  The door to the building is closed.  To the south is an open
 field.  The road continues to the east and west, and a branch runs
 southwest as well - toward the black forest.

>go north
 The door is closed.

>knock
 What do you want to knock on?

>door
 Nothing happens.

>examine building
 The building is just north of the road.  It looks like an office of
 some kind.  Like most of the buildings in the village, it's made of
 wood with a fieldstone foundation.

>open door
 It seems to be latched from the other side.

 Outside Inn

    You are standing outside a wooden inn at the west end of a small
 Rylvanian village.  Flickering light streams from an open window, and a
 sign hangs above the doorway.  The inn has seen better days - it's
 run-down and falling apart, and could use a good coat of paint.  A path
 runs south, out of town, and more buildings are down the street to the
 east.  To the west is more of the black forest.  The inn is to the
 north.

    With heightened senses, you hear the townsfolk muttering inside the
 inn.  You sense their fear, their terror of the creatures they believe
 stalk the night.  The smell of their blood, hot and sweet, drifts on
 the cool night breezes.

    Everything is new and fresh.  The fluttering light from inside the
 inn seems to dance with a new intensity.  Though it's clear you
 wouldn't be able to see in total darkness, your vision is sharper than
 it's ever been.  New sensations scream for attention, and every pore in
 your body is tingling.

>go west
 Black Forest

    You are lost among the twisted, gnarled trees of the black forest.
 The trees close in around you and the air is damp and cold.  Somewhere
 off in the distance a lone wolf howls.  Owls hoot, and a faint
 scrabbling under the leaves hints of tiny creatures of the night,
 searching for food.  You can travel in almost all directions.

    The woods seem to call your name; your heart is racing.  You can
 sense life all around you - the quiet stalking of predators, the
 mindless fear of the prey, even the gentle grace of dying trees.
 Scents wash over you, and your nostrils flare involuntarily.  Even
 though your sharpened vision tells you the trees are dying, no forest
 has ever seemed so alive.

>read trees
 I don't know how to read the trees.

    Without warning, a lone wolf appears from the trees and meets your
 gaze with yellow eyes.  Strangely you feel no fear - only a strange
 mastery over the creature.  You can even hear the beast's thoughts - "I
 serve you."  Before you can find a way to respond, the wolf melts away
 into the dark wood.

>go south
 Open Field

    You're standing on a knoll, an open field a bit higher than the
 surrounding terrain.  Tall grasses gently sway in the cool night
 breezes.  Below you to the north you see the winking lights of Gloomfen
 Village and far in the distance, up a rocky mist-shrouded mountain, you
 can just make out a sinister-looking stone castle.  To the south and
 west are the black Rylvanian forests.  To the east is a crumbling stone
 church and - perhaps a half-mile away - a winding river.  The only
 clear track leads north, back down to the village.

    There's a ragged old man lying on the ground.  He looks up at you
 through bleary eyes.  "Charity for a poor fellow, kind sir?"  he
 wheezes.

    A group of bar patrons spring to their feet as you enter the

 day, back from the grave!" The patrons leap to their feet, their faces
 masks of fear.  They leap for you and throw you to the ground, shouting
 and cursing, holding crosses in your face.  You throw one off, then a
 second, but four still hold you, just barely able to keep you
 restrained.  One raises a wooden stake above your heart and brings it
 down, touching your chest.  Another grasps a hammer -
