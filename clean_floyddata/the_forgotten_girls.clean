 You and your friend Pari have been digging out an escape tunnel.
 Yesterday she told you that it was ready and that she would come get
 you right after dinner. Unfortunately, it's already night and she's
 half an hour late, which is worrying you very much. Even worse, Nikhil
 probably isn't planning to leave for at least a few hours, and by then
 you doubt you'll have any chance.

 (The following story was written for Vanderbilt University's 2012
 Commons Reading Competition. It was inspired by "Half the Sky: Turning
 Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide" by Nicholas Kristof
 and Sheryl WuDunn.)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Forgotten Girls</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by Brent H.
 Release 1 / Serial number 120817 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 The room is small, musky, and windowless. A single light bulb is
 hanging overhead, controlled by a light switch.  A bed is pushed in
 the corner, leaving only a little room for standing. The walls are
 made of solid gray concrete and are colored by various stains you'd
 rather not speak of. There is one hole in the wall for electricity. A
 wooden door separates this room from the hallway to the north.

 On the bed is Nikhil Varma.

 You can also see a plastic fan here.

>examine nikhil


 An Indian man whom you judge to be about twenty-five years old. He
 appears to be reasonably fit, fairly healthy, and a despicable
 monster.

 (Try to "examine" everything. You can get a lot of clues from that. It
 can also be abbreviated "x", as in "x bed".)

>examine stains


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>examine walls


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>examine me


 You are a thin, yet fairly tall, fourteen-year-old Indian girl. You
 consider yourself to be only of average prettiness, however, which is
 fortunate here, as beauty is almost a curse.

 (To see a description of the room, just type "look". This description
 will tend to change depending on what's in the room at the time.)

>examine plastic fan


 A generic white fan about half a meter high, consisting of four fairly
 sharp blades. It is placed here more for the comfort of the customers
 than for yours. A cord connects it to the hole in the wall. There is a
 white cover to protect the blades.

 The plastic fan is currently switched on.

 (To talk to someone, just "mention" a subject while in the same room
 as someone else. This can be abbreviated "m", as in "m love". In
 addition, you can "think" in order to show a list of important
 possible subjects to mention.)

>think


 You are currently talking about: whatever comes to mind.

 You might want to mention: the building, love, marriage, prostitution,
 the girls, sex, you, and Nikhil.

 (To check what you're holding, type "inventory" or "i".)

>mention building


 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

 "Yeah, this place is kind of run down, but there's a really nice
 selection here. It's a little far from where I live, but I think it's
 worth it."

 (For a short list of useful verbs implemented in this story, type
 "verbs". For a list of other implemented verbs, which might spoil
 certain puzzles, type "other verbs".)

>m prostitution


 Nikhil considers prostitution for a second.

 "How else would I pass ten years of my life?"

 (If you need more help, just type "help". In that menu is also a list
 of hints.)

>mention nikhil


 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

 "I'm a good man, I think, and I'm well on the track to success. I'm
 not sure there's any need to be more specific."

>m me


 Nikhil considers you for a second.

 "You look perfectly fine, even if you're not the best here. I do like
 how much taller you are than other girls your age, though. You're more
 adjusted to my body size."

>examine nikhil


 An Indian man whom you judge to be about twenty-five years old. He
 appears to be reasonably fit, fairly healthy, and a despicable
 monster.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 The room is small, musky, and windowless. A single light bulb is
 hanging overhead, controlled by a light switch.  A bed is pushed in
 the corner, leaving only a little room for standing. The walls are
 made of solid gray concrete and are colored by various stains you'd
 rather not speak of. There is one hole in the wall for electricity. A
 wooden door separates this room from the hallway to the north.

 On the bed is Nikhil Varma.

 You can also see a plastic fan here.

>go north


 (first opening the wooden door)
 Nikhil says, "Hey, what are you trying to do? I paid for this time, so
 stop wasting it."

 If you want to leave, you'll probably have to be a little more
 surreptitious.

>examine hole


 A small centimeter-wide hole has been roughly drilled into the wall so
 that the light bulb and fan can get electricity. You often dream about
 escaping through it.

>turn fan off


 (the plastic fan off)
 You flip the switch near the bottom of the fan, and it sputters to a
 halt.

 Nikhil says "Hey, turn that back on! I'm already too hot." You
 grimace, thinking that he is, in fact, not.

>mention nikhil


 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

 "I guess I chose you today because I haven't had you yet. Many of the
 better-looking ones were already taken as well."

>building


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>mention building


 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

 "If I had designed this building, I definitely would have made it more
 open. People with claustrophobia could never come here."

>again


 You're already talking about that.

 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

>wait


 Time passes.

>talk about nikhil


 You see no reason to mention that.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 The room is small, musky, and windowless. A single light bulb is
 hanging overhead, controlled by a light switch.  A bed is pushed in
 the corner, leaving only a little room for standing. The walls are

 wooden door separates this room from the hallway to the north.

 On the bed is Nikhil Varma.

 You can also see a plastic fan here.

>mention nikhil


 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

 "Yes, I find this building to be extremely old and depressing, but I'm
 willing to accept it."

>m nikhil


 You're already talking about that.

 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

>think


 You are currently talking about: himself.

 You might want to mention: the building, love, marriage, prostitution,
 the girls, sex, you, and Nikhil.

>mention marriage


 Nikhil considers marriage for a second.

 "Yes, I certainly want to be able to meet a woman soon who is worthy
 of being my wife."

>m love


 Nikhil considers love for a second.

 "Ah, love is a great thing. It is the most noble of all emotions. A
 man and a woman are truly great when they so choose to be."

>m marriage


 Nikhil considers marriage for a second.

 "Love can lead to marriage or the other way around. Of course, one
 never knows which at first."

>wait


 Time passes.

>examine bed


 Perhaps your least favorite place in the world. It is essentially a
 large mattress set on the ground, perhaps half a meter high.

 On the bed is Nikhil Varma.

>m marriage


 You're already talking about that.

 Nikhil considers marriage for a second.

>again


 You're already talking about that.

 Nikhil considers marriage for a second.

>look under mattress


 You find nothing of interest.

>open door


 Nikhil says, "Hey, what are you trying to do? I paid for this time, so
 stop wasting it."

 If you want to leave, you'll probably have to be a little more
 surreptitious.

>m building


 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

 "No, this is a terrible place to have a wedding. It's too dark and
 everything's too enclosed. That is what you mean, right?"

>think


 You are currently talking about: the house.

 You might want to mention: the building, love, marriage, prostitution,
 the girls, sex, you, and Nikhil.

>m nikhil


 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

>m marriage


 Nikhil considers marriage for a second.

 "I want to be married by the time I'm thirty, but I'm willing to wait
 if I can't find the right woman."

>m girls


 Nikhil considers the girls here for a second.

 "I don't know where they get these girls from, but most of them are
 pretty impressive."

>m building


 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

 "This is not the best place for them to work, really. Still, I'm sure
 that it's the best the owners can afford."

>m prostitution

>m you

 Nikhil considers prostitution for a second.

 "Yes, I know what this place is for. Maybe it could branch out a
 little, though, maybe add a restaurant."



 You see no reason to mention that.

>m building


 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

 "I've heard that prostitution is the world's oldest profession. It
 must have been so open back then. Now we're forced into cramped houses
 if we want to satisfy ourselves."

>m marriage


 Nikhil considers marriage for a second.

 "Looking for a wife here is probably the worst thing I can do. They
 have been tainted by other men, of course, but even if they weren't,
 only the poor girls end up here anyway."

>examine switch


 A small plastic light switch turns the light on and off.

 The light switch is currently switched on.

>m nikhil


 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

 "I'm not married yet, of course, but I definitely hope to be some day.
 My wife will be beautiful, loyal, and hardworking."

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a dress (being worn)

>m love


 Nikhil considers love for a second.

 "There was a girl I knew who I once thought I loved. She and her
 family disappeared one day, and I have never seen them since. Maybe
 they moved because of poverty, or maybe she became engaged to another
 man. I have no idea."

>m you


 You see no reason to mention that.

>m nikhil


 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

 "I really must meet someone someday who I love. The world would be so
 much brighter."

>turn off light


 (the light bulb)
 Nikhil shouts at you, "No, leave that on! I want to be able to see
 you."

>examine bulb


 (the light bulb)
 A bare yet surprisingly bright bulb dangling from the ceiling is the
 only source of light in the room. A power cable running along the
 ceiling is connected to a hole in the wall. Another cable connects it
 to a light switch by the door.

>unplug bulb


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine cable


 A thin black rubber cable attached to the light bulb. You can tell
 that it's already fraying at the hole in the wall.

>break cable


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>m prostitution


 Nikhil considers prostitution for a second.

 "If you mean that I should try becoming a prostitute, I'd really
 rather not. The demand is probably pretty low as well. That is what
 you mean, right?"

>pull cable


 Nothing obvious happens.

>m building


 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

>think


 You are currently talking about: the house.

 You might want to mention: the building, love, marriage, prostitution,
 the girls, sex, you, and Nikhil.

>m me


 Nikhil considers you for a second.

 "Yes, I guess it must not be comfortable working here all day. Still,
 we all have to make a living somehow."

 You refrain from stating that you don't actually get any of the money.

>prostitution


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>m prostitution


 Nikhil considers prostitution for a second.

 "I do wonder how you came to be in this state. Actually, don't tell
 me. That'll take too long."

>m me


 Nikhil considers you for a second.

 "I can plainly see what you are. Everyone can plainly see what you
 are."

>m nikhil


 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

>m prostitution


 Nikhil considers prostitution for a second.

>m me


 Nikhil considers you for a second.

>think


 You are currently talking about: you.

 You might want to mention: the building, love, marriage, prostitution,
 the girls, sex, you, and Nikhil.

>m girls


 Nikhil considers the girls here for a second.

 "I imagine that in your field of work you have little time for
 recreation with those other girls. Still, it's just something you have
 to accept."

>m love


 Nikhil considers love for a second.

 "Every girl is in love with the idea of love. I would say most men are
 too."

>m prostitution


 Nikhil considers prostitution for a second.

 "Yes, I've heard that some prostitutes fall in love with their
 clients. Ah, all those broken dreams."

>m girls


 Nikhil considers the girls here for a second.

 "I wonder how these girls will live the rest of their lives. They
 certainly cannot survive by themselves for long."

>m nikhil


 Nikhil considers himself for a second.

 "I've been to a few other places in the past few years, but I admit
 that the girls here are probably the best selection I've seen."

>m building


 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 The room is small, musky, and windowless. A single light bulb is
 hanging overhead, controlled by a light switch.  A bed is pushed in
 the corner, leaving only a little room for standing. The walls are
 made of solid gray concrete and are colored by various stains you'd
 rather not speak of. There is one hole in the wall for electricity. A
 wooden door separates this room from the hallway to the north.

 On the bed is Nikhil Varma.

 You can also see a plastic fan here.

>examine bed


 Perhaps your least favorite place in the world. It is essentially a
 large mattress set on the ground, perhaps half a meter high.

 On the bed is Nikhil Varma.

>move bed


 It is fixed in place.

 A wooden door with cracked, peeling, green paint in random splotches.

>look in hole


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine wire


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>examine cable


 A thin black rubber cable attached to the light bulb. You can tell
 that it's already fraying at the hole in the wall.

>kick nikhil in the nuts


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>m sex


 Nikhil considers sex for a second.

 "I'm a fan of it, personally."

>think


 You are currently talking about: sex.

 You might want to mention: the building, love, marriage, prostitution,
 the girls, sex, you, and Nikhil.

>m me


 Nikhil considers you for a second.

 "Yeah, sure, we might as well get started soon."

>m building


 Nikhil considers the house for a second.

 "If you had to enter this business, couldn't you have picked a better
 place to do so?"

 No, you think. You couldn't have.

>m me


 Nikhil considers you for a second.

>verbs


 Important verbs:
 examine (x) _
 look
 inventory (i)
 mention (m) _
 think
 take/drop _
 open/close _
 get in/get out _
 n/e/w/s/ne/se/sw/nw

 Note that these are not the only implemented verbs, just the most
 commonly used.

>m sex


 Nikhil considers sex for a second.

 "The woman up front said that you were pretty good at this, but of
 course everyone always oversells their products."

>girls


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>m girls


 Nikhil considers the girls here for a second.

 "It does bother me sometimes to think of the other guys who have been
 in all you girls, but I can generally block that image out."

>kiss him


 You move near him and take his head into your hands. He pulls you
 close and kisses you. "Not bad," he says, "but let's just get right
 down to it."

>get in bed


 You get onto the bed.

 On the bed you can see Nikhil Varma.

>take eyes


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>have sex


 (with the plastic fan)
 You should probably limit yourself to only having sex with animate
 objects.

>hit him with fan


 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit Nikhil Varma.

>have sex with Nikhil


 Nikhil pulls you closer and proceeds not to let you go for hours.
 Despite what else you may say about him, he certainly has incredible
 stamina. Of course, by the time you actually have any chance to leave,
 it's already too late to.



     <span class="floydstyle i">*** What did you expect? ***</span>



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the
 last command?
>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine fan


 (the plastic fan)
 A generic white fan about half a meter high, consisting of four fairly
 sharp blades. It is placed here more for the comfort of the customers
 than for yours. A cord connects it to the hole in the wall. There is a
 white cover to protect the blades.

 The plastic fan is currently switched off.

>take fan


 (the plastic fan)
 Taken.

>remove cover


 (first taking the fan cover)
 You position yourself between Nikhil and the fan so that he can't see
 it. Then you carefully pry the cover off of the fan, leaving the
 blades exposed.

 You're not wearing that.

>examine wires


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>examine blades


 Four fairly sharp blades are connected to the center of the fan.

>take blade


 That seems to be a part of the plastic fan.

>hit nikhil with fan


 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit Nikhil Varma.

>put penis in fan blades

>touch nikhil with fan

 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.



 I only understood you as far as wanting to touch Nikhil Varma.

>turn on fan

>verbs

 (the plastic fan)
 You flip the switch, and the fan whirs to life.

 Nikhil says "Good. Now stop messing with it."

 examine (x) _
 look
 inventory (i)
 mention (m) _
 think
 take/drop _
 open/close _

 n/e/w/s/ne/se/sw/nw

 Note that these are not the only implemented verbs, just the most

>attack


 (the plastic fan)
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>hit nikhil


 You're not that dumb. He could easily defeat you with almost no
 effort.

>touch fan


 (the plastic fan)
 You feel nothing unexpected.

>m fan


 You see no reason to mention that.

>examine fan


 (the plastic fan)
 A generic white fan about half a meter high, consisting of four fairly
 sharp blades. It is placed here more for the comfort of the customers
 than for yours. A cord connects it to the hole in the wall. You have
 removed the cover.

 The plastic fan is currently switched on.

>lick fan


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine cover


 A slightly damaged white cage used to protect errant fingers from the
 fan blades. The fan cover is never tightly attached and has in fact
 fallen off at least four times in the past year. You have managed to
 take it off.

>cut nihil


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>examine cord


 A white rubber cord connected to the fan on one side and a hole in the
 wall on the other.

>cut nikhil


 Cutting him up would achieve little.

>wear cover


 You place the cover on your head, forming a makeshift helmet.

>examine cord


 A white rubber cord connected to the fan on one side and a hole in the
 wall on the other.

>examine black


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>examine cable


 A thin black rubber cable attached to the light bulb. You can tell
 that it's already fraying at the hole in the wall.

>cut cable with fan


 (the plastic fan)
 You carefully bring the fan blades perpendicularly to the fraying at
 the edge of the wall.

 Nikhil asks, "Hey, why are you messing with that fan back there?"

 You lie and tell him that the cover has fallen off, so you're trying
 to fix it. As you're explaining, the fan blades finally manage to cut
 through enough of the wire to break the connection, and so the light
 bulb quickly fizzles out.

 It is now pitch dark in here!

>open door


 You open the wooden door.

>out


 You get off the bed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

 Fortunately for you, Nikhil hasn't realized what's happened, so he
 says "Oh, great, the light bulb has burned out now? Go out and get
 your owner to change it. I will get what I paid for!"

>out


 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

 "Of all the times to happen..." grumbles Nikhil.

 You should probably leave before Nikhil gets suspicious. Just go
 north. (You can also type "n", while "e", "w", and "s" will work for
 the other directions. Combinations like "sw" may also be used
 occasionally.)

>go north


 The fan's attached to the wall. You need to drop it first.

 "I'm not going to have time to come here again for another two weeks,"
 Nikhil continues to complain.

  Come on, this is the perfect chance.

>drop fan


 (the plastic fan)
 Dropped.

 "And I've got to be back home in just two hours," Nikhil says.

 Seriously, you need all the time you can get.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway is narrow and looks essentially the same as your room in
 all basic respects, with the same drab walls and poor lighting. Small
 rooms like yours line the wall on both sides. East leads to Pari's
 room and west heads to the main room where the customers are.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Hallway</span>
 The hallway is the same uniform gray all along, and you can see doors
 stretching all the way further east, leading eventually to the
 outside. Pari's room is south of here. The hallway in front of your
 room is to the west.

 A door down the hallway on the odd-numbered side opens, as a man
 leading a girl exit their room and head to the front. You step aside
 to allow them to pass.

>go south


 (first opening Pari's door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pari's Room</span>
 The room looks almost exactly the same as yours. A key difference is
 that this room is lighted. A key similarity is that Pari is not in
 either. A door leads north to the hallway.

>examine me


 You are a thin, yet fairly tall, fourteen-year-old Indian girl. You
 consider yourself to be only of average prettiness, however, which is
 fortunate here, as beauty is almost a curse.

>inventory


 You don't have time to waste here.

>hide under bed


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>search bed


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pari's Room</span>
 The room looks almost exactly the same as yours. A key difference is
 that this room is lighted. A key similarity is that Pari is not in

 to.

>push switch


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Hallway</span>
 The hallway is the same uniform gray all along, and you can see doors
 stretching all the way further east, leading eventually to the
 outside. Pari's room is south of here. The hallway in front of your
 room is to the west.

 A door down the hallway on the even-numbered side opens, as a man
 leading a girl exit their room and head to the front. You step aside
 to allow them to pass.

>go east


 A girl who you think is called Navya comes over from the west. She
 quietly says, "I've been asked to collect all the girls who are done
 working for the day. There's going to be a demonstration soon."

 You suddenly begin to suspect the worst. "Here, follow me," she says,
 heading west and north to the dining room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The dining room is simply what you call the collection of tables here
 where the girls come to eat. However, it is fairly large, so it is
 often used as a meeting room as well. Tables and chairs have been
 pushed to the edges of the room for the demonstration. A cupboard
 stands in the corner. South leads to the hallway.

 You can see a table (on which are Pari, some ropes, a wooden stick, an
 iron rod, and a purse (closed)), Mother Avni Singh, Akshay Singh,
 Arnav Singh, Aditi Singh, the family dog, some girls, a cupboard
 (closed), and the rice cooker (closed) here.

 Navya heads out to search for others, shutting the door behind her.

 Mother Singh hits Pari's right leg. Pari lets out a faint whimper.

>examine dog


 By far your favorite member of the family. A large mutt, he is kept by
 the Singhs partly for sentimental value and partly for his ability to
 intimidate customers who refuse to pay or leave quickly enough.

 Mother Singh hits Pari's right arm. Pari lets out a faint whimper.

>examine pari


 Pari is fairly tall for a 16-year-old, and thus she is one of the
 stronger girls here. Because you often talk to her at night through
 the hole in the wall, she is your closest friend.

 Pari is carrying:
   Pari's dress (being worn)

 Mother Singh hits Pari's right arm. Pari lets out a faint whimper.

 Mother Singh shouts, "Well, girl, you thought you could get away with
 this? Everyone, watch closely and see what happens to those who rebel
 against me."

>release the dog


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine girls


 A large ring of girls has surrounded the table on which Pari is bound.
 Their attention is wholly focused on her, so you are able to sneak
 around without either them or Mother Singh noticing.

 Mother Singh hits Pari's right leg.

>open purse


 That might be a bit too obvious.

 Mother Singh hits Pari's right arm. Pari lets out a faint whimper.

>get purse


 That might be a bit too obvious.

 Suddenly, Nikhil's head pops into the room as he opens the door and
 peers in. You quickly duck down behind the mass of girls.

 Nikhil stares at Pari and asks Mother Singh, "What are you doing now?"

 Mother Singh answers, "We're just punishing her a bit. She tried to
 steal some money from us." You cringe inwardly. Based on your past
 experience, if that was the crime, Pari is about to be crippled, if
 not dead. You have to save her.

>open cupboard


 You open the cupboard, revealing a can opener and a can of beans.

 Nikhil considers the answer before saying, "Well, why are you making
 all the other girls watch this?"

 Mother Singh says, "We need to teach these girls not to disobey us.
 Everybody here does this. Now, excuse me, but what are you here for?"

>open rice


 You sneak over to the rice cooker by hiding behind the girls.

 You open the rice cooker, revealing cooked rice.

 Nikhil hesitates before saying, "Well, I need a new light bulb for my
 room. I sent my girl out to get someone to fix the problem, but she
 still hasn't returned." You crouch down further.

 Mother Singh says, "Interesting. I have no idea where she is, but we
 happen to be out of light bulbs at the moment. However, I can send my
 son out with you to the city to get some new ones. Akshay, my boy, go
 help him."

>take rice


 (cooked rice)
 You don't see any use for a handful of rice. Besides, you don't have
 anything to grab or carry it with.

 Nikhil and Akshay walk out of the room, Akshay having an obvious look
 of displeasure on his face at being forced to miss this.

 One of the girls asks, "Should I close the door, Mother Singh?"

 She replies, "No, no one else is going to come anymore. Besides, it's
 hot in here and I'm already breaking a sweat."

 Mother Singh says to Pari, "Alright, now that we've softened you up a
 bit, it's time to start going a little harder." She picks up the
 wooden stick.

>examine iron rod


 A metal rod about the same length as the stick. It is only used in the
 worst cases. You are very worried now.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's right leg with a stick. Pari lets
 out a short cry.

>take can


 (the can of beans)
 Taken.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's left arm with a stick.

>open can


 (the can of beans)
 You use the can opener to open the can of beans. Then you quickly dart
 out of the way so you are not seen, leaving the can on the ground.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's left leg with a stick. Pari lets
 out a short cry.

>put beans in rice cooker


 (the can of beans in the rice cooker)
 (first taking the can of beans)

 No, not yet.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's right arm with a stick.

 The dog cautiously weaves its way through the mass of girls, enticed
 by the smell of the beans. You wave it over and gesture at it to eat.
 It eagerly complies, sticking its muzzle inside the can. The sound of
 the dog eating gets Mother Singh's attention, and she turns toward the
 dog.

 Mother Singh shouts, "Who left a can of beans open on the floor?
 Alright, Arnav, go out and walk the dog for an hour or two. I
 certainly do not want him making this place smell." Arnav slowly walks
 out with the dog, obviously annoyed at being assigned this chore.

>turn on rice cooker


 That's not something you can switch.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's right leg with a stick.

>examine girls


 A large ring of girls has surrounded the table on which Pari is bound.
 Their attention is wholly focused on her, so you are able to sneak
 around without either them or Mother Singh noticing.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's left leg with a stick. Pari lets
 out a short cry.

>spill rice


 (cooked rice)
 You tilt over the rice cooker and some of the dry grains escape,
 forming a small heap of spilled rice on the ground. You quickly move
 away from there so that you won't be suspected. The noise of the
 grains falling is loud enough for Mother Singh to turn towards it.

 She shouts, "Aditi, go out to the closet and get the broom so you can
 sweep this up." Aditi complies, heading out.

 Aditi returns and quickly sweeps the rice up into a dustpan. She then
 leaves to dump it in the outside refuse pile. Putting the broom back
 in the closet, she returns to continue watching.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's right arm with a stick. Pari lets
 out a short cry.

 She is older than Arnav and younger than Akshay, but beyond that you
 have little idea of her age. She is as cruel as her mother is.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's right leg with a stick.

>examine iron


 A metal rod about the same length as the stick. It is only used in the
 worst cases. You are very worried now.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's left arm with a stick. Pari lets
 out a short cry.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The dining room is simply what you call the collection of tables here
 where the girls come to eat. However, it is fairly large, so it is
 often used as a meeting room as well. Tables and chairs have been
 pushed to the edges of the room for the demonstration. A cupboard
 stands in the corner. South leads to the hallway.

 You can see a can of beans (in which are some brown beans), a table
 (on which are Pari, some ropes, an iron rod, and a purse (closed)),
 Mother Avni Singh, Aditi Singh, some girls, a cupboard (empty), and
 the rice cooker (in which is cooked rice) here.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's left leg with a stick. Pari lets

 The rice cooker is already here.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's right arm with a stick. Pari lets

>examine cooker


 A large steel rice cooker enclosed within a wooden cover. It is far
 too large for its legs, however, and in the common cases where it is
 accidentally spilled, someone always has to waste time cleaning it up.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's right leg with a stick. Pari lets
 out a short cry.

 Mother Singh quickly strikes Pari's right leg with a stick. Pari lets

 grains falling is loud enough for Mother Singh to turn towards it.

 She shouts, "Aditi, go out to the closet and get the broom so you can
 sweep this up." Aditi complies, heading out.

 Aditi runs back in, shouting that the broom has been broken. Mother
 Singh says, "What! Who has done this? The broom was fine earlier; has
 someone damaged it on purpose? Oh, we shall get to the bottom of this
 mystery once I have finished with this girl! Meanwhile, go into town
 and tell your brother to pick up a new broom as well." Aditi quickly
 dashes out to follow her mother's orders, and you inwardly celebrate
 at having another family member out of the way.

 Now Mother Singh, having worked up a sweat, picks up the metal rod.
 She laughs and says, "Okay, my girl, prepare for some real pain now."

 Mother Singh aims a sharp blow with the metal rod at Pari's stomach.
 Pari tries hard not to scream, only letting out a short "Oof."

>okay


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>hit singh


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 Mother Singh aims a sharp blow with the metal rod at Pari's leg.
 "Urgh...", groans Pari as she reels from the blow.

 Mother Singh shouts out, "Someone get me a book of matches for later."
 The girls stare nervously at each other for a minute, until one of
 them takes a chair, pushes it in front of the cabinet, and stands on
 it so she can reach on top of the cabinet. She fishes around for a
 little bit, finding two books of matches. Then she gets down, pushes
 the chair in the corner, and gives both to Mother Singh, who says, "I
 only need one. She's not going to last that long," The girl shudders a
 bit before throwing one book back into the cupboard, as Mother Singh
 places the other in an imperceptible fold in her dress.

>take purse


 That might be a bit too obvious.

 Mother Singh aims a sharp blow with the metal rod at Pari's arm.
 "Arghhh!", she shouts, tears glistening in her eyes.

 first or anything.

 "Arghhh!", she shouts, tears glistening in her eyes.

 A middle-aged woman who runs the place, she is warm and inviting to
 the customers, but cruel to everyone else. She always seems even more
 vicious when her husband is out at the bars, as he probably is now.

 A dirt clearing with a fence to the south. Sometimes you come out here
 in the middle of night for fresh air. The front gate is to the
 northwest.

 In the blue car you can see a car key.

 The inside of the car has a faint scent that you can't place but still
 repulses you. The seats are covered with some brown cloth, and the
 seatbelts are the same color despite being made of some different
 substance.

>turn on car


 (the blue car)
 That's not something you can switch.

>turn key


 (the car key)
 Nothing obvious happens.

>turn ignition


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred

>start car

>drive


 To drive, just move normally while in a vehicle.

>go north


 You push the gas pedal as hard as you can, ramming the car into the
 front wall. The bricks fly apart, as the car folds inward at the front
 with a gigantic crunching sound. The force of the impact almost throws
 you out the front window, but your seatbelt protects you. You quickly
 stagger out, assessing the damage. A large hole is now in the wall
 between the main room and the clearing. One of the guards runs over to
 investigate, but by that point you have already snuck around him in
 the darkness back to the front door. Then Mother Singh screams and
 runs into the main room, and as the others girls trickle in, you weave
 behind them while they stare in horror at the car. Finally, you make
 it back into the dining room, practically collapsing in exhaustion.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The dining room is simply what you call the collection of tables here
 where the girls come to eat. However, it is fairly large, so it is
 often used as a meeting room as well. Tables and chairs have been
 pushed to the edges of the room for the demonstration. A cupboard
 stands in the corner. South leads to the hallway.

 You can see spilled rice, a table (on which are a wooden stick, Pari,
 and some ropes), a cupboard (empty), and the rice cooker (in which is
 cooked rice) here.

>take knife


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred

>cut rope


 You need something sharp with which to cut the ropes.

>examine can opener


 A metal can opener with a plastic handle. It has surely done more than
 its fair share of work over the years.

     some brown beans
   a can opener
   a fan cover (being worn)

>examine pari


 Pari is fairly tall for a 16-year-old, and thus she is one of the
 stronger girls here. Because you often talk to her at night through
 the hole in the wall, she is your closest friend.

 Pari is carrying:
   Pari's dress (being worn)

 You don't want anyone to know you're here. Secrecy is your only weapon

 A small alley leads to a dead end to the west, as a wooden fence
 blocks your way. East is the main street.

 You can see Pari, a trash can (empty), and a balcony here.

 The guard continues running towards you.

>hide


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>wait


 Time passes.

 The guard checks the dumpster first and discovers both of you trying
 to hide inside. "Did you really think I'd be stupid enough not to
 check this place?" says the guard. He takes you both by the arms, but
 no matter how much you struggle, you can't escape. Within ten minutes,
 you both are back in the building. Within twenty, you both are tied to
 the tables. Within an hour, you both are in a freshly-shoveled pit in
 the backyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Main Street</span>
 This is the largest street in the town, threading straight through the
 center. There's an old street sign nearby that probably states the
 name of the road. West leads back to the building, while north leads
 farther into the city.

 You can see Pari here.

>think


 You are currently talking about: whatever comes to mind.

 You might want to mention: the building, love, marriage, prostitution,
 the girls, sex, you, and Pari.

>m pari


 Pari considers herself for a second.

 "I'm not sure what there is so say about me that you don't already
 know."

>m the girls
>m girls


 Pari considers the girls here for a second.

 "The girls are all nice people. I just wish I had gotten to know them
 all better."



 You're already talking about that.

 Pari considers the girls here for a second.

>m building


 Pari considers the house for a second.

 "It was a horrible place. Everything was dirty and cramped, and either
 too dark or too bright. I would easily die before going back there."

>m me


 Pari considers you for a second.

 "You're a good friend. I don't know how long I would have survived if
 I hadn't been able to look forward to our conversations."

>Pari, we could go back and get to know the girls better if you'd like

 LIKE

 There is no reply.

>m me


 You're already talking about that.

 Pari considers you for a second.

>me pari


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>m pari


 Pari considers herself for a second.

 "You've been my closest tie to humanity. Thank you so much."

>examine sign


 An old wooden post with a piece of metal stuck on top, which has some
 writing on it, but you can't read anyway.

>examine metal


 That is either not here, not visible, or does not need to be referred
 to.

>break sign


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>go north


 Suddenly, you see the short guard running here from the north. They
 have apparently already started searching for you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Middle Main Street</span>
 The streets are mostly deserted at this hour, but the stars are bright
 enough to guide you. The road continues farther north and south. West
 is an alley.

 You can see a short guard here.

 Pari arrives from the south.

>go north


 The guard catches up to you, knocking you both down with a few swift
 blows of his rifle butt. Before you can get up again, he's captured
 you both by the arms, and his grip is too strong to resist. Within ten
 minutes, you both are back in the building. Within twenty, you both
 are tied to the tables. Within an hour, you both are in a
 freshly-shoveled pit in the backyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Alley</span>
 A small alley leads to a dead end to the west, as a wooden fence
 blocks your way. East is the main street.

 You can see a dumpster, a trash can (empty), and a balcony here.

 Pari arrives from the east.

>go up


 You and Pari quickly clamber up the balcony, flattening yourselves
 against the floor so that you are invisible.

 <span class="floydstyle i">West Alley</span> (on the balcony)
 A small alley leads to a dead end to the west, as a wooden fence
 blocks your way. East is the main street.

 You can see a dumpster and a trash can (empty) here.

 On the balcony you can see Pari.

 The guard continues running towards you.

>go west


 It's really not the best idea to move right now.

 The guard rummages through the dumpster, searching among the trash.

>examine balcony


 A small overhang on the side of the building has a ladder heading up
 to it.

 On the balcony is Pari.

 The guard kicks the trash can, feeling whether it might be
 suspiciously heavy.

>go up


 It's really not the best idea to move right now.

 The guard runs around the alley, searching for anything that would
 reveal where you were.

>wait


 Time passes.

 Eventually, the guard gives up, muttering that he can't climb over the
 fence like he's assumed the two of you have. He walks off back into
 the street, and soon he is gone from view.

 You get off the balcony.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Alley</span>
 A small alley leads to a dead end to the west, as a wooden fence
 blocks your way. East is the main street.

 You can see a dumpster, a trash can (empty), and a balcony (on which
 is Pari) here.

>examine can


 (the can of beans)
 A large can of brown beans that often supplements your dinner.

 In the can of beans are some brown beans.

>examine trash


 (the trash can)
 A small metal trash can that has no trash in it, probably because it
 happens to be next to a dumpster for some reason.

>push can


 (the can of beans)
 Nothing obvious happens.

>push trash


 (the trash can)
 It is fixed in place.

>climb trash


 (the trash can)
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>examine fence


 A tall, wooden fence cuts the alley in half. It's surprisingly new, as
 you can't see any easy way to get over it.

>climb fence


 There aren't any handholds, and you spend a few desperate seconds
 clawing at it before giving up.

>climb dumpster


 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>get on trash can


 You jump into the trash can, but there's no room for Pari. She
 stumbles around, looking for somewhere to hide.

 <span class="floydstyle i">West Alley</span> (in the trash can)

 Jumping around randomly seems to be a good way to attract a lot of
 unnecessary negative attention to yourself.

>jump west


 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>go down


 You get off the balcony.

 is an alley.

 Pari arrives from the west.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Main Street</span>
 Although you probably haven't traveled that far into the city, this
 large road has already terminated. It leads south down the street and
 north to the police station.

 Pari arrives from the south.

>look n


 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Police Station</span>
 The police station in your imagination was always more impressive: the
 real one looks like almost every other building in the city. The exit
 is to the south.

 You can see a policeman here.

 You rush up to the policeman and start telling him about all that's
 happened to you. It takes you almost half an hour to get through your
 story, with him nodding pleasantly the entire time.

>think


 You are currently talking about: herself.

 You might want to mention: nothing.

 "That's a very sad story, little girl. I don't know what to say about
 it. Still, it's not a very good idea to just run away from them," he
 says.

>m prostitutin


 A glare from the policeman freezes you into inaction.

 "You're not going to give us back to them, are you?", Pari asks
 nervously, "Right? You're just joking, right?"

>m police


 A glare from the policeman freezes you into inaction.

 "No, no," he says, "from what I understand, they would just kill you.
 And how would that help me? I mean, they haven't really been paying us
 too well recently anyway, so I see no reason to."

>wait


 Time passes.

 "Actually, I do have a friend who lives further south of here. He
 might require some girls who are experienced in your field of work,"
 he says.

 You bolt first, but the policeman is too fast, and easily manages to
 pin you down, maneuvering to block the doorway so Pari can't get out
 either. Then he calls out to the back of the police station, and some
 other men come rushing out from a back door. One of them grabs her by
 the arms as well before she can even try to run.

 "Now then, we do have a small room in the very back," the policeman
 says to you, "and I think I deserve some kind of reward for getting
 you a new job..."

 "This story is not just fiction. Millions of girls around the world
 are held in similar, if not worse, conditions. As Nicholas Kristof and
 Sheryl WuDunn write, "Our own estimate is that there are 3 million
 women and girls (and a very small number of boys) worldwide who can be
 fairly termed enslaved in the sex trade" (10).

 And forced prostitution is not the only problem they face, as women
 are discriminated against all over the world in many ways, like
 politics, medical care, and employment. They are thought of as lesser
 than men, as a necessary evil only good for babies and housework.
 Things must change, but of course, knowledge is the first step on that
 path. To that end, I heavily suggest reading "Half the Sky" by Kristof
 and WuDunn or visiting their website at
 [<a href="http://www.halftheskymovement.org/">LINK</A>] They'll get you started.
