 Today is October 31st, 1987. Your friends have invited you to join
 them for a night of camping and partying. The campsite is around a two
 hour drive from where you live now. You aren't sure who the property
 belongs to, but it's not far from where Fred Murks' grandmother lived.
 You, Fred, and another friend of yours named Steve Dirks had made the
 site as kids before she died a couple of years later from pneumonia.
 You haven't been back since then. It was at least a cool place to go
 when you were too young to be smoking cigarettes because no one ever
 bothered you out there.

 Your friends are bringing the camping equipment, food, and beer. It
 should be a fun night. Supposedly some girls were going to be showing
 up as well, but we'll see about that.

 You come around one last tight curve and see Fred's car parked on the
 side of the road. It's probably safe to assume that they have already
 gathered their stuff and went to set up camp. You park nearby, and
 then feel the chilly air of the Fall afternoon as you step out of your
 car and lock the door...

 You are standing by the road that brought you here. A large mountain
 looms on the other side of it. You can barely make out the faint white
 noise of rushing water coming far from the southeast. To the west of
 you is a clearing in the briers which provides an entrance to the
 woods.

 You can see a green car and a blue car here.

>about


 Hallow Eve is my first work of interactive fiction. Release 1 of it
 placed last in the Spring Thing 2011 competition. This release was
 created to address many issues and bugs pointed out by critics. Some
 story text has been changed or added to correct grammar and to make
 things a bit more solid and enjoyable for the player. However, the
 pulp of the story has not been changed. This game does contain "strong
 language" and the subject matter may not be for everyone.

 Please see the ReadMe.txt file included in the .zip file for more
 information on Hallow Eve. Thank you for playing.

>examine blue car


 Your blue car is here. It's plain little Japanese model, but it gets
 you where you need to go. The only complaint with it you have is that
 there's no lock on the gas cap. On a recent trip to the city, someone
 stole all of your fuel.

 In the blue car is a can of WD-50.

>examine green car


 Fred's car is about ten years old and is the size of a boat. He
 painted it himself with a bright speckled green that would usually be
 seen on a carnival ride rather than an automobile.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roadside</span>
 You are standing by the road that brought you here. A large mountain
 looms on the other side of it. You can barely make out the faint white
 noise of rushing water coming far from the southeast. To the west of
 you is a clearing in the briers which provides an entrance to the
 woods.

 You can see a pink jeep (closed and empty), a green car and a blue car
 (empty) here.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wooded Trail</span>
 You are on the beginning of a dirt trail in the woods that leads
 north. A clearing in the briers to the east will take back to the
 road.

>examine woods


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine briers


 You can't see any such thing.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Campsite</span>
 You are standing in the campsite that you and Fred made years ago. A
 large dome-shaped tent sits on the dirt. A nice fire blazes in the
 firepit. Most of the leaves have been cleared out of this roughly 50 x
 50 foot area. The trail which brought you here continues north. The
 path to the road is south of here.

 You can see Rachel, Brenda, Lola, Steve, Fred and a picnic table (on
 which are a battery-powered lantern and a Styrofoam cooler) here.

 You approach as Steve and Fred are putting the finishing touches on
 the tent. Fred turns to see you approaching and says "Hey man! You
 made it! Awesome! Have a beer, man!"

 You smile while you observe the area around you. Everything is here
 just as you remember it.

>drink beer


 You open the cooler and grab a beer. After drinking it, you discard
 the can and feel more relaxed.

>recycle can


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kick can


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine rachel


 Rachel Fuss is shortest of the three girls. In your opinion, she is
 also of shortest in the looks department. Her hair is cut
 shoulder-length, and she only teases her bangs to about half the
 height of Brenda's. She is wearing a terribly-designed sweatshirt that
 is a mess of buttons and stripes.

 The sun is beginning to set, casting long shadows from the trees
 around you.

>examine rachel's sweatshirt


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine brenda


 Brenda Bender is a tall, skinny and generally attractive girl. Her
 overly hair-sprayed, bleach-blond hairdo is accented by a large poof
 of bangs, which resembles a crab attacking her forehead.

>examine lola


 Lola Lotta is a big girl with strikingly beautiful and piercing green
 eyes, highlighted by her dark eye make-up. She's wearing plaid pants
 and a black t-shirt for a band named "The Disease", from under which a
 bit of her pale-skinned belly is exposed.

 Steve lights another cigarette, and says "Dude, this music sucks."

 Rachel says "Gee, sorry Steve. I don't have any heavy metal punk
 crap."

>examine steve


 Steve Dirks is a friend of yours that you made in middle school. His
 family moved to your neighborhood from up north. He sports denim jean
 pants, a jean jacket riddled in patches from various punk bands,
 combat boots and a mohawk, dyed green. Tall and slim with piercing
 blue eyes, he has always been a hit with the girls despite his
 rebellious appearance.

 After a while, Lola giggles to herself a bit, and asks "So, who knows
 some good ghost stories?" Fred proudly exclaims "I do!", and grabs
 another beer as he begins to tell the story he's told you and Steve a
 hundred times...

>examine fred


 Fred Murks is wearing overalls and a baseball hat, which is on his
 head backwards. He's a large guy of roughly 350 pounds, and has been a
 friend of yours since Kindergarten.

 Fred says "An old gem <span class="floydstyle i">mine</span> is near here, and a bad accident
 happened there in the 1890s. They had been doing some blasting with
 dynamite to open it up more, and the mine had gotten pretty unstable
 from that. The mine ended up collapsing on a couple of dudes working
 in there. Some people said it probably killed them instantly, but
 others say that they were trapped in there a really long time before
 they died."

 "Anyway, the mining company tried to open the mine again after that,
 but it never really came back. I talked to people who had relatives
 that worked there, and they said it was haunted! They would hear
 voices and shit in there, man!"

 Fred looks around a bit, lowers his voice, and says "They say that you
 can still hear the sound of the miners crying for help..."

 Lola says "Creepy! See, I heard that there's a haunted <span class="floydstyle i">house</span>
 somewhere around here. A real haunted house. A doctor lived there and
 he got in a bunch of trouble for malpractice or something."

 Brenda says "I heard about that! The Pane house! Doctor Pane!"

 Rachel gives Brenda a "shhh!" and a mean look.

>take lantern


 Taken.

 Lola says "I heard that after he couldn't work as a doctor anymore, he
 locked himself up in one room of the house for a month with some of
 his scientific equipment. His wife kept hearing and smelling weird
 things from the room and every day she would bang on the door and beg
 him to come out."

 Steve says "Damn! I never heard about all this! Did he ever come out?"

 Lola's mouth gently curves into a mischievous grin as she says "Oh
 yeah, he came out. And when he did, he was completely insane. He
 murdered his wife, and when the police got there, they found her
 laying on the floor of the kitchen with her skull cut open and part of
 her brain missing."

 Brenda and Rachel gasp.

 Lola says "They never did find Doctor Pane though. He was supposed to
 have a son, but they never found him either. I always thought it would
 be kind of cool to check out that house, but I have no idea exactly
 where it was. Just somewhere around here in these mountains. It's
 probably been bulldozed or burned down by now anyway."

>examine lantern


 A battery-powered lantern.

 Everyone sits around in awkward silence for a bit, presumably both
 deep in thought and a bit freaked out after the round of ghost story
 sharing.

 Out of nowhere Fred blurts out "Anyone else getting hungry?"

 Lola perks up "Hehe! Yeah, actually I am!"

 "Cool." says Fred. "I just got to run to my car real quick to grab the
 tin foil and stuff."

>examine table


 A wooden picnic table is here. Last year, everyone played <span class="floydstyle em">Tunnels</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">& Trouble-Makers</span> on this table a lot more than actually ate at
 it.

 On the picnic table is a Styrofoam cooler.

 When fred begins to walk to his car, Brenda yells "Hey! I want to go
 check out the river first, before it gets too dark!" Then, she
 stumbles to her feet.

 Rachel says "I don't want to walk over to that stupid river. It's
 freezing."

 Before Brenda can respond, Fred hastily turns around and volunteers to
 walk with her down to the river.

 Fred and Brenda walk off to the north.

 You spend the next fifteen minutes just hanging out at the campsite,
 watching the fire burn and having another beer.

>examine cooler


 A cheap, Styrofoam cooler commonly sold in gas stations and grocery
 stores. It contains the ice and beer you bought on the way here.

 Night falls. Darkness surrounds all you can see beyond the light of
 the campfire.

>wait


 Time passes.

 Much to the disgust of Rachel, Steve and Lola seem to be getting more
 and more flirtatious with one another. Steve is pinching and grabbing
 at Lola, which she accepts with smiles and giggles.

 Rachel says "Get a damn room you two! Jeez!"

 They laugh a bit at Rachel's protest, and Steve says "Do you wanna go
 out for a walk in the woods Lola?" He turns to you shrugs. He says
 "You can come too if you want to, dude."

 Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe Rachel will cool off or get
 bored and leave. Either one works for you.

>flirt with rachel


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kiss rachel


 Rachel says "Fucking perve! Get off of me! You are so not my type!"

 After that awkward situation, you can't help but wonder what in the
 world Rachel's "type" could be...

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Campsite</span>
 You are standing in the campsite that you and Fred made years ago. A
 large dome-shaped tent sits on the dirt. A nice fire blazes in the
 firepit. Most of the leaves have been cleared out of this roughly 50 x
 50 foot area. The trail which brought you here continues north. The
 path to the road is south of here.

 You can see Rachel, Lola, Steve and a picnic table (on which is a
 Styrofoam cooler) here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

 You are following Lola and Steve.

 Steve says "This trail goes deeper into the woods but it ends soon."

>turn on lantern


 You switch the battery-powered lantern on.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wooded Trail</span>
 You are walking along a dirt trail in the woods that goes south, and
 starts to fade towards the northwest.

 You can vaguely hear the sound of running water from the southeast.

 You can see Lola and Steve here.

 You are following Lola and Steve.

 Lola says "Are you sure we should keep going, Steve?"

 Steve replies "Of course, baby! We never explored all of these woods
 when we were kids, but I always found our way back."

>se


 You are following Steve and Lola right now.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Woods</span>
 You are walking in very deep woods. So deep in fact, that every
 direction looks the same. Some boulders form an overhang over a deep,
 muddy hole here.

 You can see Lola and Steve here.

 You are following Lola and Steve.

 Steve grabs Lola's hand and says "Watch out, don't fall into the pit!"

 Lola pauses for a few seconds to look down into the muddy hole. "How
 deep is it?" she asks.

 "About twelve feet or so." says Steve. "We crawled down into it a
 couple of times. There's this weird cool draft of air you can feel
 coming blowing out of a crack in the rock down there, even in the
 summer time! Maybe we'll come back here tomorrow and I'll show you.
 There's a little junkyard close to here too that we would find some
 rad stuff in sometimes. Let's keep walking a little more."

 You remember the "junkyard" being nothing more than a pile of random
 stuff in a ditch to the southwest of here. There was new junk just
 about every week dumped there, some of it being cool stuff (to a kid)
 like worn-out tools or broken electronics. However, it doesn't look
 like Steve is interested in going that direction tonight.

>wait


 Time passes.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Woods</span>
 You are walking in very deep woods. So deep in fact, that every
 direction looks the same.

 You can see Lola and Steve here.

 You are following Lola and Steve.

 "Snap!" The three of you all jump in shock due to a random sound from
 within the woods that sounds like a branch breaking.

 Lola clutches Steve tightly and he turns to look at you while
 chuckling.

 "Let's turn back, Steve." Lola says.

 Steve replies "Oh come on baby, it was just a squirrel or something.
 Let's go just a little bit further before we turn back."

>wait


 Time passes.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Base of the Hill</span>
 A very tall and steep hill is ahead of you. Steps that are mostly
 covered in leaves have been made with flat stones which lead up the
 hill. You can see a house up the stairs from here. The trail splits
 back to the south and southwest.

 You can see Lola and Steve here.

 You are following Lola and Steve.

 Steve turns to you and asks "Dude, I've never seen these stairs
 before. Do you remember this?"

 You think about it briefly, then shake your head. This whole situation
 is beginning to make you feel a bit nervous, though you can't help but
 also feel like this is a bit fun.

>wait


 Time passes.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of the Dark House</span>
 You are standing in front of an old, dark house that lies to the
 north. It looks to be two stories. You can't see any lights on inside
 from here. The wooden exterior of the house has been painted a dull,
 reddish brown. You can walk around northwest or the northeast to get
 to the sides of the house. Rustic steps made of stone lead down
 towards deeper woods.

 You can see Lola, Steve and a Jack-O-Lantern (lit) here.

 You are following Lola and Steve.

 Lola points to the north and says "Look! A house! They've got a
 jack-o-lantern lit up and everything! That's kind of weird. I wouldn't
 think that they get many trick-or-treaters out here."

 Steve says "I don't know. Maybe they've got kids or something. We
 should probably go talk to them for a minute. Because you know this
 might be their property we're camping on. I don't want them to get
 pissed off at us."

 Lola says "Do you think so, baby? I don't know. Well, yeah. You're
 probably right."

 Steve takes Lola's hand and they walk together onto the porch. Steve
 puts another cigarette in his mouth and knocks on the front door while
 dropping his lighter onto the porch and cursing in a futile attempt to
 retrieve it.

 The door creaks open. Lola leans her head in slightly. "Hello?" she
 says. "Wow, hehe, that's big bucket of candy..." She moves just past
 the threshold of the door, and Steve follows.

 "Hello?" you hear him say within.

 Suddenly, the door slams shut!

>open door


 It seems to be locked.

 You hear Lola screaming and you run to the porch of the house in
 panic. The door won't open. From beyond it, you hear Lola yell "What
 is it Steve?! What is that thing?!" You hear Steve yell "Oh god!",
 followed by lots of loud banging noises. Then... unnerving silence.

 You hear the door emit an audible click.

>open door


 You open the large door.

>enter house


 That's not something you can enter.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You are standing in the foyer of the dark house. There are doorways to
 the east and to the north. You can exit the house through the doorway
 to the south. Stairs lead up to a second level.

 A ghostly skeletal hand creeps out of the black curtain which is
 shortly followed by a long arm, draped in black cloth. A hooded skull
 then emerges. What stands before you now is some tall and strange
 skeletal spectre that you can't explain. You are stunned to see this
 macabre entity, but it shows no sign of seeing you. Perhaps due to a
 lack of eyeballs.

 It then walks to the center of the room and stands there, and slowly
 points to a large plastic cauldron filled with assorted candies
 sitting on the floor by the front door. You are in a state of
 disbelief. What the hell is going on here?

>eat candy


 (first taking Candy)
 It looks like it's been tampered with. You've heard enough urban
 legends about razor blades and poison put into candy by lunatics than
 to risk eating it.

>examine spectre


 This skeletal spectre cloaked in black must be nearly seven feet tall!
 The only features beneath the cloak you can see are his emotionless,
 skull face and his awkwardly long, boney hands.

>shake hands


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 You are standing in a dirty and dusty kitchen. Filth and miscellaneous
 bones of unknown creatures litter the area. Despite the many signs of
 neglect, it does appear that the room has been used recently used due
 to clean smears in the dust on some surfaces here.

 You see a chalk outline of a person on the floor, and in the center of
 it is a huge blood stain.

 You can see a kitchen counter (on which is a butcher knife) here.

>examine stain


 This blood stain is dark and old.

>outline


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine outline


 The outline is quite faded, but still visible.

>examine knife


 A long, sharp-looking butcher knife.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You are standing in the foyer of the dark house. There are doorways to
 the east and to the north. You can exit the house through the doorway
 to the south. Stairs lead up to a second level.

 You can see a skeletal spectre here.

>go north


 The skeletal spectre blocks the path, and slowly shakes his finger at
 you.

 The skeletal spectre blocks the path, and slowly shakes his finger at
 you.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of the Dark House</span>
 You are standing in front of an old, dark house that lies to the
 north. It looks to be two stories. You can't see any lights on inside
 from here. The wooden exterior of the house has been painted a dull,
 reddish brown. You can walk around northwest or the northeast to get
 to the sides of the house. Rustic steps made of stone lead down
 towards deeper woods.

 You can see a lighter and a Jack-O-Lantern (lit) here.

>take lighter


 Taken.

>take jack-o-lantern


 You have no need for that.

>examine jack-o-lantern


 A scary-looking Jack-O-Lantern. A small flame illuminates the carved
 pumpkin from inside; producing a faint, yellow light.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Side of the Dark House</span>
 You are standing on the west side of the house. All of the windows you
 can see here are boarded up. The backyard of the house is to the
 northeast. You can also head back to the front of the house to the
 southeast.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graveyard</span>
 You are in a small graveyard at the rear of the dark house which
 contains about twenty tombstones. All of the tombstones look very old.
 One of the graves looks recently disturbed. Exits are to the southeast
 and southwest. There is also what looks like the entrance to a cellar
 to the south.

 Something catches your attention over by the graves...

 You see the ground by the disturbed grave move, and out of it slowly
 rises the rotting head of a human corpse. Chunks of dirt are falling
 from its face, along with maggots and worms. The corpse then rises
 completely from the grave, and begins walking towards you.

>examine corpse


 An animated, rotting corpse. Maggots are crawling around in its
 eye-sockets.

>se


 You run full speed away from the animated corpse. Horrible thoughts
 racing through your mind are spotted with memories of an old black and
 white zombie movie you saw when you were younger. Most importantly the
 methods of destroying the creatures; bullets to their brains and a
 showering firebombs. You really wish you had a gun or a Malotov
 cocktail right about now.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Side of the Dark House</span>
 You are standing on the east side of the house. All of the windows you
 can see here are boarded up. The backyard of the house is to the
 northwest. You can also head back to the front of the house to the
 southwest.

 There is a large, gnarled tree here.

>examine tree


 The tree is close to the house, and large branches are over-hanging
 the roof.

>climb tree


 Try "up" or "down" instead.

>go up


 You easily climb up the tree and drop from an over-hanging branch onto
 the roof.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roof of the Dark House</span>
 You are standing on the roof of the house. A few branches of a large
 tree reach near the edge of the roof, providing a way back down. From
 here you can see a second-story window to the southwest, that is level
 to the roof you are standing on. The window is closed and dark inside.

>open window


 It's stuck!

>spray window


 What do you want to spray the window with?

>spray window with can


 You spray the cracks of the window with WD-50 liberally. You've used
 up the last of the WD-50, so you toss the can into the woods.

>open window


 The well-lubricated window now moves with a little effort.

 You open the window.

>enter


 You must supply a noun.

>enter window



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Children's Bedroom</span>
 You are in what appears to be a bedroom which belongs to a child. The
 wallpaper is covered in pictures of clowns and circus events. There's
 some graffiti on one wall written in crayon. There is an awful smell
 present here.

 You see a couple of marbles scattered here. A blue door is to the
 east, or you can go out through the window to the northeast.

 You can see a blue door, marbles and a dirty blanket here.

>examine marbles


 A few assorted marbles of different shapes and colors.

>examine blanket


 This blanket is small and must have belonged to a child. It must have
 been here for quite a while. it looks very dry despite being heavily
 stained.

>take all


 marbles: Taken.
 dirty blanket: Spots of the dirty blanket look very soiled, so you
 refrain from taking it. Only scraps of it would possibly be of any
 use.

>drop marbles


 You drop the marbles onto the smooth floor, and they begin rolling to
 the other side of the room. The skeletal spectre lunges forward as if
 to catch them, but ends up performing a short and clumsy dance before
 he falls into a heap of bones and cloth on the floor.

 Then, you think you hear a child whisper "Thank you." behind you. You
 turn around to look, but no one is there. You then turn back around to
 face the center of the room, and notice that the heap of bones and
 cloth has disappeared.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living Room Lab</span>
 As you walk into the room, you immediately notice an old man in a lab
 coat here. He tending to some sort of large, boxy piece of metal
 equipment filled with dials and other mechanisms. He slowly turns his
 head to look at you...

 The first thing you notice is his eyes. They look glazed over, as if
 blinded somehow. The ultra-violet light in the room bouncing off them
 gives them a milky green hue. Can he even see you? He is supported by
 large and complex metal braces on both of his legs. He must be very
 old. You stand there for what seems like an eternity of silence. Then,
 he takes a long breath and opens his mouth.

 "How did you get in here?" he says in a weary and raspy voice.

 "Who are you?"

 You tell him your name, and ask for his. His eyes open wide as he says
 "I'm Doctor Pane!"

 A feeling of dread overwhelms you.

 You can see Doctor Pane and a strange machine here.

>examine doctor


 You see an old man in a lab coat. Random strands of straw-like white
 hair are scattered on his head. The ambient ultra-violet light in the
 room gives and eerie green tone to his glazed eyes. He appears very
 feeble; both of his legs are braced with some sort large, complex
 braces made of metal.

>examine braces


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine machine


 There is a large, noisy machine in the far corner of the room. There
 are large tubes coming out of the machine which stretch through the
 ceiling above. At the base of each tube is some sort of bellows;
 continuously pulsing up and down.

 There are numerous dials and meters on this machine which you do not
 understand. However, a large switch to one side of the machine catches
 your eye.

>flip switch


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine switch


 A large, metal switch. A yellow and black striped decal borders it.

 Some large equipment lies in one corner, connected to large tubs of an

 You can see Doctor Pane and a strange machine here.

>ask doctor about machine


 There is no reply.



 Doctor Pane says "Oh, so you're with them? I should have known.
 Stupid, young fools. You're all doomed. You will become feces of the
 mass. Consumed. Just like the rest. Worthless, mortal worms!"

>kick doctor's braces


 That's not a verb I recognise.



 Doctor Pane gives you a partly toothless smile and says "You are
 probably wondered how I did it, aren't you? You've heard the legends.
 Maybe you're another stupid authority who's come here to root me out!
 I bet you wonder how I'm even here. Do you? ..wonder how I'm even
 alive and standing here? I have secrets. I've worked my whole life for
 them and given everything I have to know. You will know nothing. You
 deserve nothing and you will never know!

 path to the road is south of here.

 You can see Fred, Rachel and a picnic table (on which is a Styrofoam
 cooler) here.

 Fred comes running up to you, looking very concerned about something
 and visibly out of breath.

 "Have y'all seen Brenda?! No?! What the fuck?! She's gone man! Just
 disappeared! I walked her down to the river and things were just fine.
 We were talking and stuff. I looked away for a minute to check out
 this old canoe laying out there, then I thought I heard a splash or
 something and turned around to see what it was. I turn around.. she's
 not there!"

 "I called her name and looked around for a while... all I saw was a
 bra that looks almost new and probably around her size. It's got to be
 hers. It was laying on a rock by the river! Maybe she fell in? She was
 really drunk, man."

 Fred tries to catch his breath. Fred says "What the hell should we do?
 I guess one of us could drive back to town and get some help, but that
 will take too long if she's about to drown or something. Maybe you
 could take that canoe down the river some and look for her? Shit. I
 don't know. It looked like it was in decent shape, but I'm too damn
 big to get in it. I'd sink that little thing. I know I would. It's up
 to you. I'm just going to wait here.

 Rachel says "Well, this sucks. I'm getting the hell out of here. Screw
 you guys. Someone walk me to my jeep."

 Fred says "I'm not going anywhere. I'm waiting for Brenda."

 Rachel puts her hands on her hips and looks at you. She says "It's
 only a few feet to my jeep. Besides, if she fell in the river I think
 that she would be towards that end of it anyway. Come on."

 Grudgingly, you walk rachel to the road...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roadside</span>
 You are standing by the road that brought you here. A large mountain
 looms on the other side of it. You can barely make out the faint white
 noise of rushing water coming far from the southeast. To the west of
 you is a clearing in the briers which provides an entrance to the
 woods.

 You can see a pink jeep (closed and empty), a green car and a blue car
 (empty) here.

 You see Rachel Fuss going to her pink jeep, looking thoroughly
 pissed-off. Just as she reaches to unlock her door, a swift and
 shadowy form with what looks like giant, tattered wings of a bat
 swoops down from a tree top and lands between her and the vehicle.
 Rachel lets out a blood curdling scream that is cut short by the
 shadowy creature's claws slitting her neck from one side to the other.

 The scream becomes a sickening gurgle, and blood begins to spray in
 all directions from her throat. The creature opens its mouth. It's a
 gaping orifice of numerous long fangs, and he practically inhales the
 blood. Rachel makes a desperate attempt to grasp the wound with her
 hands. It is too late. She falls over dead, smearing blood down the
 side of the jeep.

 While observing this horrid scene, you barely notice Rachel's murderer
 swiftly leap into the tree-tops and disappear.

 Rachel Fuss lies dead. The cause of her death is evident; blood loss
 due to a massive gash in her neck.

 You slam the flat rock into the chains, focusing on the cut you made
 with the hacksaw. The link breaks the rest of the way through, and the
 chains fall to the ground.

 You toss the rock aside.

>open gate


 You open the iron gate.

 Brenda steps out of the cave, and gives you a wet hug. "Thank you! Now
 let's get out of here!"

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mouth of the Mine</span>
 The inside of this cave is very damp. A stream fills the the area with
 the sound of trickling water and you are standing on the muddy bank of
 it. The abandoned mine entrance lies to the east, and the cave
 continues to the west. The rock walls in this area are fairly dry.

 You can see an iron gate and Brenda here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Mine Entrance</span>
 You are standing outside of what looks to be an old, abandoned mine
 entrance. A creek flows out of the large mouth of a cave to the west,
 and into the river to the east. Random rocks are scattered all along
 the sides of the creek. There's a small wooden shack off to the side
 of the entrance.

 You can see Brenda and a canoe (empty) here.

>push canoe


 Nothing obvious happens.



 You get into the canoe, and Brenda gets in with you.



 The plaque basically says:

 TO USE THE CANOE:
 "LAUNCH" (to get into the water)
 OR
 "LAND" (to get out)

 "USE OF LIFE JACKETS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED FOR SAFETY"


>launch canoe


 I only understood you as far as wanting to launch.

 The canoe floats further down the river.

 <span class="floydstyle i">The Brown River</span> (in the canoe)
 You are floating on the Brown River. The strong current is pulling you
 south, river at a quick pace. You hear a very loud sound of rushing
 water further down the river.

 In the canoe you can see Brenda.

>examine brenda


 Brenda Bender is in hysterics and is naked from the waist up and
 covered in dirt and bruises. She is also wet from head to toe, and
 shivering.

 The canoe floats further down the river.

 <span class="floydstyle i">The Brown River</span> (in the canoe)
 You are floating on the Brown River. The strong current is pulling you
 south down the river at a very fast pace. The sound of rushing water

 catching a glimpse of what looks to be severe whitewater rapids ahead
 to the south.

 In the canoe you can see Brenda.

 You step out of the canoe, and so does Brenda.

>remove clothes


 You don't think getting naked right here or right now would be a good

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roadside</span>
 You are standing by the road that brought you here. A large mountain
 looms on the other side of it. You can barely make out the faint white
 noise of rushing water coming far from the southeast. To the west of
 you is a clearing in the briers which provides an entrance to the
 woods.

 You can see Brenda, bloody keys, Rachel's body, a pink jeep (closed
 and empty), a green car and a blue car (empty) here.

 Brenda notices Rachel's bloody body laying by the pink jeep. She
 screams, "Oh god! Rachel! Rachel! No!" and cries.

>dance


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>search rachel


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine rachel


 Rachel Fuss lies dead. The cause of her death is evident; blood loss
 due to a massive gash in her neck.

>take keys


 You don't really want to touch them. Besides, you have your own car.

>open blue car


 That's already open.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wooded Trail</span>
 You are on the beginning of a dirt trail in the woods that leads
 north. A clearing in the briers to the east will take back to the
 road.

 You can see Brenda here.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Campsite</span>
 You are standing in the campsite that you and Fred made years ago. A
 large dome-shaped tent sits on the dirt. A nice fire blazes in the
 firepit. Most of the leaves have been cleared out of this roughly 50 x
 50 foot area. The trail which brought you here continues north. The
 path to the road is south of here.

 You can see Brenda, Fred and a picnic table (on which is a Styrofoam
 cooler) here.

 Fred sees you and Brenda Bender approaching the campsite..

 "Brenda! Man! What happened?" Fred says.

 Brenda grabs Fred and says "Get me out of here! You've got to get me
 away!"

 Fred turns to you and says "Thanks, man. I'm going to get her home and
 call the cops. Are you going to try to look for Steve and his girl? I
 don't know, man. Maybe you should go too. I took a look at Rachel
 while you were gone. Something really messed up is going on, man! I'm
 out of here!"

 Fred starts to shake your hand, then grabs your shoulder and says
 "Just be careful, man."

 Fred and Brenda take off running full-stride to Freds car.

 A matter of seconds later, you hear Fred's tires burning the road as
 he drives off.

 in the white light of your battery-powered lantern. The sound of
 running water is much louder here. While there is no actual waterfall
 present in this deeper part of the cave, one wall of the room
 resembles a beautiful, cascading waterfall.

 You see the remains of what looks like were two miners here, leaned
 against the cave wall in a sitting position. The only exit from this
 area is to the southeast by swimming through a narrow opening.

 You think you are hearing voices here.

 You can see a tape recorder and a narrow crack in the cave wall here.

 back to the south and southwest.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of the Dark House</span>
 You are standing in front of an old, dark house that lies to the

 There is a large, gnarled tree here.



 You easily climb up the tree and drop from an over-hanging branch onto
 the roof.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roof of the Dark House</span>
 You are standing on the roof of the house. A few branches of a large
 tree reach near the edge of the roof, providing a way back down. From
 here you can see a second-story window to the southwest, that is level
 to the roof you are standing on. The window is open and dark inside.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Children's Bedroom</span>
 You are in what appears to be a bedroom which belongs to a child. The
 wallpaper is covered in pictures of clowns and circus events. There's
 some graffiti on one wall written in crayon. There is an awful smell
 present here.

 You see a couple of marbles scattered here. A blue door is to the
 east, or you can go out through the window to the northeast.

 You can see a blue door and a dirty blanket here.



 You have to specify what you want to cut it with.



 You cut away a bit of cloth from the outside of the blanket with the
 hacksaw.



 You are carrying:
   a rubber hose
   a sharp tent stake
   a bottle (in which is gasoline)
   a lighter
   a butcher knife
   clothes (being worn)

 You put the wad of cloth into the bottle (in which is gasoline).

 Now that the bottle is filled with gasoline and the mouth of it is
 stuffed with a wad of cloth, you have produced a Molotov cocktail.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roof of the Dark House</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graveyard</span>
 You are in a small graveyard at the rear of the dark house which
 contains about twenty tombstones. All of the tombstones look very old.
 One of the graves looks recently disturbed. Exits are to the southeast

 to the south.

 You can see a walking corpse here.



 You can't see any such thing.

>light molotov


 Try "detonate" instead.

>detonate molotov


 You ignite the Molotov cocktail with the lighter. You had better get
 away from it soon.

>throw molotov at corpse


 You throw the Molotov cocktail at the corpse. The glass of the bottle
 breaks instantly on your target, unleashing flaming gasoline. You see
 the corpse go up in flames while flailing at the air for a few
 seconds. Then it falls to the ground, smoldering.

>examine vampire


 You see what must be a vampire or someone in a very convincing
 costume. It is wearing a tattered black cape and a disintegrating
 fancy, black suit. Translucent skin stretches over its bald head and
 clawed hands. Its eyes are bloodshot to the point of almost being
 black. Its mouth is slightly open, revealing not the familiar set of
 long canines seen in the movies, but a grotesque maw completely filled
 with long, razor-sharp teeth.

 It seems to be asleep with its eyes open.

 You go over to Lola and begin cutting her ropes. She starts wiggling
 in her ropes and her eyes get wide. You turn to look behind you to see
 the vampire rise sharply from the coffin, as stiff as the boards it
 was made from; like the arm of a clock without any gears. The
 grotesque monstrosity swiftly slays you mercilessly as Lola watches in
 horror.

 You plunge the sharp stake into the chest of the vampire. Its mouth
 opens and its arms reach towards the ceiling suddenly, causing you to
 jump back.

 You watch as the vampire quickly decays and turns to dust in a matter
 of seconds.

>cut ropes with knife


 You cut Lola free from the ropes with the butcher knife.

 Lola wiggles out of the remaining ropes and pulls the gag out of her
 mouth. She opens her mouth as if to speak, but nothing more than a few

 Doctor Pane says "They were my best patients. So many head traumas. So
 many fixes to be made. I'm sure they were probably the ones that ran
 their mouths to the authorities. I never cared about the gem-mining
 business. Uranium! That's what I really wanted them bring me.

 reddish brown. You can walk around northwest or the northeast to get
 to the sides of the house. Rustic steps made of stone lead down
 towards deeper woods.

 You can see Steve, Lola and a Jack-O-Lantern (lit) here.

 Lola screams "Steve!" she says. "Baby! I thought you were dead! They
 got me too!"

 Steve says "We're OK. Have.. every.. thank friend uh.."

 Lola says "Oh god, Steve. What did they do to you?"

 Lola looks at you and says "I've got to get Steve out of here! I'll
 grab Rachel's keys and take her jeep. I'm OK to drive. I'll drive him
 to the hospital. You should come too."

 Lola and Steve walk off towards the trail.



 You can't go that way.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Base of the Hill</span>
 A very tall and steep hill is ahead of you. Steps that are mostly
 covered in leaves have been made with flat stones which lead up the
 hill. You can see a house up the stairs from here. The trail splits
 back to the south and southwest.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Woods</span>

 You are walking in very deep woods. So deep in fact, that every

 that you recognize as the way back towards the campground.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wooded Trail</span>
 You are walking along a dirt trail in the woods that goes south, and
 starts to fade towards the northwest.

 You can vaguely hear the sound of running water from the southeast.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wooded Trail</span>
 You are walking along a dirt trail in the woods that goes north and
 south.

 You can vaguely hear the sound of running water from the east.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Campsite</span>
 You are standing in the campsite that you and Fred made years ago. A
 large dome-shaped tent sits on the dirt. A nice fire blazes in the
 firepit. Most of the leaves have been cleared out of this roughly 50 x
 50 foot area. The trail which brought you here continues north. The
 path to the road is south of here.

 You can see a picnic table (on which is a Styrofoam cooler) here.



 You can't go that way.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wooded Trail</span>
 You are on the beginning of a dirt trail in the woods that leads
 north. A clearing in the briers to the east will take back to the
 road.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roadside</span>
 You are standing by the road that brought you here. A large mountain
 looms on the other side of it. You can barely make out the faint white
 noise of rushing water coming far from the southeast. To the west of
 you is a clearing in the briers which provides an entrance to the
 woods.

 You can see Rachel's body and a blue car (empty) here.



 You get into the blue car.



 <span class="floydstyle i">Roadside</span> (in the blue car)
 The inside of your car is relatively clean. You are sitting in the
 drivers seat, and the ignition to the car is in front of you.

 You can see Rachel's body here.



 If you do that, you will start the car and drive away. Are you sure?

 (Answer "yes" or "no")



 You start your car and drive home. Many thoughts and questions go
 through your mind along the way. Some of the nights events were so
 bizarre that you question if they were even real, despite having just
 experienced them. Lola and Steve made it safely to the hospital. Fred
 and Brenda ended up going to Fred's house, where they called the
 police. You decide to drive straight to the sheriff's office. They
 have a lot of questions for you. Afterwards, they tell you go home for
 the night and get some sleep. The next morning, there is a knock on
 the door. It's the sheriff.

 "Are you sure you are telling me the whole truth?" he asks. "Why?
 Well, because parts of your story don't add up, that's why. We checked
 out that old house near where you were all getting wasted, and it's
 empty! Totally vacant. Now, why don't you come on in and tell me what
 really happened out there."

 You are all investigated over the next couple of weeks for the murder
 of Rachel Fuss, but fortunately the authorities are unable to link
 anything connecting any of you to the crime.

 You know what happened that night. Perhaps nothing was found in the
 house because Doctor Pane somehow went to the other side; the dark
 dimension which he spent his entire life connecting to this reality.
 You take pride in thinking that he is now a servant of his own hell
 that you and all of your friends have escaped.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of the Dark House</span>
 You are standing in front of an old, dark house that lies to the
 north. It looks to be two stories. You can't see any lights on inside
 from here. The wooden exterior of the house has been painted a dull,
 reddish brown. You can walk around northwest or the northeast to get

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Landing</span>
 This is the second floor of the house.The hall goes north and west,
 with doors at each end. A stairway leads back down to the foyer.

 You can see a blue door and a metal door here.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Evil Mass</span>
 This room is completely consumed by some grotesque mass of tissues and
 organs of varied sizes. The whole room is filled with hearts,
 eyeballs, jaws, lungs, intestines, and muscles. Long appendages are
 drooping placidly from the walls.

 Strange symbols resembling altered pentagrams and writing in a
 language you do not understand have been painted over the entire
 floor.

 You can see a metal door here.



 You ignite the stick of dynamite with the lighter. You had better get
 away from it soon.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Landing</span>

 sleep. Two days later, there is a knock on the door. It's the sheriff.

 "I just wanted to tell you that we found the house you told us about.
 I never would have believed it, but everything you told us was true.
 That crazy old doctor even tried to attack us when we got there, but
 he's in custody now." The sheriff takes a look around, as if he's
 making sure no one else is within an earshot.

 "What do you think really happened out there?" he asks. "You know,
 just between you and me. The FBI has already taken over the case, and
 they aren't telling us anything."

 No one but the sheriff and your friends that you rescued would believe
 your wild tales about what happened on Halloween night of 1987. You
 have sealed off what must have been some gateway to some other hellish
 dimension, slayed a vampire, disposed of an undead corpse and rescued
 all your surviving friends. You have shown great cunning to do
 everything you could to accomplish this and ensure that Doctor Pane
 will no longer be a threat to anyone.
