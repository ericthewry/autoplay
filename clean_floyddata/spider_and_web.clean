 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and
 grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The
 mountains were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is
 crusted with squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still
 flashes of its historic charm. You've seen spires above the streets --
 tiny green parks below tenements -- hidden jewels of fountains beyond
 walls. Any bland alley can conceal balconies wrought into iron gardens,
 fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers nurtured by who knows who.

 This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty
 brick, and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the
 courtesy of a handle. Maybe you should call it a day.

 End of Alley
 It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in
 three directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash. (Your
 guidebook warned you: the police are as efficient about litter laws as
 about everything else they do.) You can retreat to the south.

 A plain metal door faces you to the east, near the alley's end. It's
 firmly shut.

>examine door
 It's a naked sheet of metal, a foot taller than you, as wide as your
 outstretched arms. No handle, no keyhole, no label, no sign. No obvious
 way to open it at all, unless the black plate embedded beside it will
 serve.

 You are carrying nothing of importance.

>examine plate
 A featureless, dull black rectangle is embedded in the bricks beside
 the door. It's about the width of your palm. No fool could doubt the
 plate has something to do with opening the door, but it doesn't bear a
 clue about how to do it.

>push plate
 Nothing happens.

>knock on plate
 There is no response.

>knock on door
 You scrape your knuckles without result. There isn't even any sound;
 it's like knocking on the side of a mountain.

 The walls are brownish brick, not recently washed. They stretch at
 least two stories above you.

>climb wall
 The bricks are narrowly mortared. There's not a bit of hold to grasp.

 Mouth of Alley
 You're in the entrance of a narrow brick alley, which runs further in
 to the north. To the south a broad street courses by, congested with
 traffic and bicycles, although none of them seem to notice you.

>go south
 You leave door and alley behind, and set off to see what else this fine
 city might hold.

 Interrogation Chamber (imprisoned in the chair)
 You blink away sharp edges of memory, and the dim walls slowly emerge
 into your sight once again. Dark metal walls and air uncomfortably
 cool. And cool metal bands around your wrists and feet and forehead.

 He leans forward over his desk, through the glow of his monitors and
 controls. Impatience tightens his face.

 "Don't be absurd," he says. "You're no more a sightseer than the Old
 Tree in Capitol Square; and if you'd had enough sense to walk away from
 that door, you wouldn't be here. You don't and you didn't and are; we
 caught you. And you're going to start by telling me how you got through
 that door. Do you understand me?"

>yes
>no
 The man nods briefly -- a man satisfied with the least important
 detail. He touches a control. Once again, a faint whine begins to drill

 "This is tedious," the man says. "Of course you didn't walk up and
 stand there rattling the door like a nightclump. Nor did you blow
 through the keyhole." Clenched knuckles rap on the desk, tension at
 odds with his patient tone. "Nor, I add, did you break into this place
 barehanded and bare naked. You had something which opened that door,
 and you used it. Was it this?"

 His fist opens abruptly. Something rod-shaped gleams silver in his
 palm.

>examine rod
 It's your lockpick, yes. A silver rod the size of your ring finger,
 splayed at one end into a flat disc of conductor-web matrix. You can't
 make out, from this distance, whether it's undamaged.

>no
 "No? But this is yours. A guard found it inside, just before we caught
 you, and it's nothing of ours. So don't pretend you didn't carry it
 in."

 woven gleam of conductor-web matrix.

 "Naturally not. I look forward to examining the others. Not," he adds,
 "that they did you good in the end."

 There is no reply.

 He raises an eyebrow. "Embarrassed? Clever tricks or no, it was still
 one of you and all of us, and we're not that weak. Are we." A sharp
 look from those eyes. "Let's continue. You entered the complex..."

 White Junction
 You stand lightly in a bare tiled corridor, white tiles and cold white
 walls. The ceiling is acoustical panelling divided by illuminated
 strips of plastic. The hall runs north and east, with a branch curving
 away to the southeast.

>examine tiles
 The floor is featureless white tile.

>go north

 Corner At Doors
 The hallway runs both east and south from here. There's a featureless
 metal door to the west, which is closed; a more normal one stands
 closed to the north.

 One of the ceiling panels is missing, leaving a rectangular gap above
 you.

 The hole is about two feet by three. Through it, you can see the actual
 concrete ceiling, a few inches above the acoustical panelling.

 and you concentrate on holding on. Your feet swing gently a foot above
 the floor.

 Uh! A sharp edge is digging into one finger. You shift your grasp
 hastily, but a few drops of blood smear across the hole's lip.

 few inches high; but it spreads out around you into darkness.

 A small package, wrapped in cloth, is sitting on the panelling, just a
 few inches from your face.

 You move your hands a bit, one at a time, to ease the strain.

>about
 Spider And Web is copyright 1997-8 by Andrew Plotkin. It may be copied,
 distributed, and played freely.

 For acknowledgements and credits, please type "credits".

 An introductory note: To simplify the problem of dialogue in
 interactive fiction, the "tell" and "ask" commands are not used in this
 game. Your conversational options are limited to "yes," "no," and
 saying nothing at all. Trust me -- this isn't as big a deal as it
 sounds.

 Also, after some consideration, I have decided not to implement body
 parts -- head, arms, legs, hands -- as separate objects. If you feel a
 desire to refer to yourself, "me" will suffice.

 It is possible to make a fatal mistake in this game, but you will
 immediately know you have done so. You can always "undo" after death,
 and then fix the mistake. Therefore, the game is best played straight
 through. Accept any non-fatal mistakes that you may make; you will have
 a second chance. If you back up and replay each scene for maximum
 efficiency, avoiding all mistakes, certain aspects of the game will be
 lost.

 However -- you will eventually reach a point where things become
 dangerous. You'll know when. Beyond that, you're playing for keeps and
 heartbeats count. Save early and often.

 Do not expect Spider And Web to be anything like So Far or A Change in
 the Weather. It's not. In a certain sense, this is my first
 conventional game. In another sense, it's the strangest game I know,
 and understanding what's happening is entirely your problem.

 This game is free. But if you feel like sending me money, I won't
 refuse. If you feel like sending me comments or bug reports, I'll be
 ecstatic. As of the beginning of 1998, I am at

 the north, and a closed metal door to the south. You can see that the
 east hall reaches a dead end a short distance away.

 The lockpick is clinging to the black plate by the door.

 The footsteps move out of a branch corridor to the north -- a trio of
 guards, still heading this way. You dodge back out of their line of
 view, flattening yourself inside the west side of the tee.

 The lockpick's status dot is sliding towards green.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You hear the guards coming closer.

 The lockpick's status dot is sliding towards green.

 The lockpick's status dot fades to pure green, and flicks steady blue.

 The metal door slides open. To the north, the footfalls of the guards
 cease, startled by this apparition. Then they begin again -- hurrying.

>go south
 You hurl yourself towards the open door, snatching at the lockpick as
 you go by. Nearly -- but your fingers close wrong, and the silver rod
 clatters to the floor behind you as you dive over the threshold. The
 door slides closed; you are left in quiet dark.

 A moment later, the door slides open again. A surprising number of
 pulse guns are aimed through it, all at you.

 Impatience is plain between his eyes, now. "Yes, you had time to get
 inside. But the door, did you notice, would have come open in full view
 of Mobile Three? You did notice, in truth, that's what you showed me."

 He shakes his head. "But Three says they didn't see you at all, and
 they certainly didn't see you fooling around with that door, and they
 certainly didn't enact that tableau at the end. With the guns." He
 seems particularly disgusted with that touch, for some reason. "Is it,
 what, you just enjoy a dramatic scene?"

 "Spare me." He touches a control.

 "Very neat. Behind the backs of the guards, and leave them to mumble

 "There's nowhere else," says the man, almost patiently. "I assumed
 Security was later, because the lab is your primary objective. Was, to
 say." His voice slows, again contemplative, unsettling to you. "Your
 story is predictable. Did you expect that?"

 "There is tension, but the flow is clear. The hero will extract the
 secret plans and escape; I wouldn't believe you if you said anything
 else. Except, of course, you didn't escape."

 He is still seated, but his eyes are the eyes of a man pacing. "This
 isn't a story. Do you have any imagination? Do you realize what this
 technology will be used for?" He seems as astonished at the outburst as
 you.

>say no
 "Naturally. You were sent for, and so you came." That must be a quote.
 "Implications are someone else's job. 'Clean War.' No troops, no
 civilian blood. One man at a time, slipped into an office or a palace,
 beyond any hope of wall or guard. Or not even a man -- a grenade, a
 canister of gas. The end," wryly -- "of security. I'd be out of a job."
 His eyes are distant, and again you feel that you are the least
 important thing in the room.

 "Bad enough if we get it first. We'll take you apart, or just threaten
 to. Harsh but quick. It would be over, we'd have won. But if your
 people get it too, if you'd gotten out with the data, do you
 realize...?"

>say no
 "Of course you don't. You just march. But see... Knives at each other's
 throats. How long could that last? Two years, five. Eventually it would
 be too tempting, some premier or on-commander who poses too much
 immediate threat." Somehow his eyes are holding yours. "Then it would
 be literal knives at each other's literal cursed throats. Whole
 governments beheaded overnight. Same for anyone who tries to move up,
 take charge. It wouldn't end. Could you swear, honestly, that anyone
 left on your side wouldn't keep using it on anyone left on our side?
 Senate-men? Troops? Farmers?"

 Outside Laboratory
 The corridor from the east ends here, and a single door looms to the

 even more money on secrets than on simple guns."

 budget schedules."

 He passes that off with a tense wave. "It's frustrating. You say you
 haven't thought about this technology. It could put our footprints on
 the moons. We could walk to other stars as easily as to the bathhouse.
 Oceans and mountains wouldn't be walls..." Again he is watching you
 intently.

 "That, I think, is what our masters are afraid of. They'll face death
 before living without walls. You, is that why you're here? Why you're
 willing to unchain a war of assassination?"

>say no
 "Then why... no. Business first." He takes a breath, and calms.

 "You left the lab without using your explosive. You came back to

 Security Storage Room
 This narrow room is lined with steel lockers. There is a plain table at
 the south end, and the doorway to the north exits to the corridor. All
 the lockers are closed.

 On the table is a pen.

 The timer's blue dial flashes once, and the indicator flashes to 1. The
 scrambler's status dot goes green, and an almost inaudible whine begins
 within it.

 The harsh buzz continues. Within moments you also hear footsteps
 hurrying towards you.

>examine web
 Which do you mean, the metal-scan web or the bands of body-scan web?

>examine body
 Just inside each of the three doorways, on the ceilings of the three
 rooms, you see a glittering band of scan-web. The web's narrow spacing
 indicates a tight scan -- capable of picking up resonance signals off
 even a naked human body.

>examine metal
 Which do you mean, the metal-scan web or the things in the room to the

 briefly, as you have been doing, but traces nonetheless. We have since
 analyzed every sequence of the scan-web data. The results are quite
 precise; you used the scrambler four times. Four blips, on and off, you
 understand. So your story, in which you used it seven times, is not
 possible. Besides, I doubt you would have used the device
 unnecessarily. Standing around flipping it on and off, or dashing
 through a room for a cursory glance, would not be worth the risk to
 you."

 He shrugs. "We can play guessing-games all afternoon; but matters would
 go faster if you stuck to the facts."

 Security Storage Room
 This narrow room is lined with steel lockers. There is a plain table at
 the south end, and the doorway to the north exits to the corridor. All
 the lockers are closed.

 On the table is a pen.

 Security Office
 Dark wood panelling surrounds you, a refuge from the harsh white
 visible to the west. A massive mahogany desk sits in one corner. The
 rest of the room is mostly metal cabinets, but a few sketches take
 their share of wall, and a bookcase stands by the desk.

 Interrogation Chamber (imprisoned in the chair)
 You blink away memory. The dim room comes again into focus, and the man
 behind the desk.

 "And away you went." He considers. "You were searching the storage room
 for your lockpick, of course. I'm afraid I had it at the time.
 ...Although whoever left the pen lying out is due a reprimand. Sloppy,
 and you provided an excellent demonstration of why." His smile is, for
 the first time, self-satisfied. It's more frightening even than you
 expected -- but quickly gone.

 "And you entered my office looking for... what? I'm sure it wasn't my
 artwork -- that's still there, and petty vandalism is beneath you in
 any case. What, then? Passcodes, keys, open drawers and indiscretions?"

>say nothing
 "I'm not at all sorry to have disappointed you. I am good at my job,
 and I am careful, which is the same thought. If you could have caught
 me loose, caught me blind or far-eyed, you might have succeeded. You
 did not." And there is a brief silence.

 "What am I to make of you? You are endlessly inventive in your lies, if
 less subtle than brazen; you flex like grass, sometimes stubborn as
 stone, sometimes easy with your answers. You have striven to keep this
 session calm, and I do not think it was out of fear of my anger. Your
 eyes never, never waver from mine."

 He leans back in his own chair, bearing your gaze. "I have tried to
 treat you as an equal, a companion in our work. That is technique, of
 course; we both know that. But it is also sincere. And I think you have
 taken it in that faith. We are faces reflected in the mirror of our
 countries' border. I think you understand that." He nods.

 "You do see that much. You may not be brilliant -- you make mistakes --
 but you are determined. You hold that strength to what you believe, and
 in that you are not so different from me."

 He shrugs, and offers a smile as honest as you have seen. "Well? Have I
 done well? It is my job to know everything about you, after all."

>say yes
 He bows in place, both palms open. "I am delighted."

 And then he reaches again for his controls. "But we are nearly done.
 You have only a few more seconds; and you have yet to show me what
 becomes of your mysterious cloth-wrapped package."

 This bare stretch of hallway angles from the northwest to the east;

 You throw yourself to a halt, nearly stumbling, as you hear footsteps

 The hallway ends in a blank white wall. A metal door stands closed to

 A discarded filing cabinet is standing by the wall. The drawers are

 It's not yet time.

 The door snaps open suddenly, and the uniformed figure of a guard
 begins to step through. "No, what's frustrating is that you can't tell
 us what's in that blood-cursed lab," he is saying, back over his
 shoulder.

 Then he sees you. He fumbles for his pulse gun.

 You feint, and then jab the pen into the guard's shoulder, as hard as

 But then he shivers, once, and slides to the ground, and remains there.

 showing off all this time. And without the package, you understand, the
 one you found in my corridor ceiling. I am very curious to know what

 The pulse-guns to the north begins crackling. You dive for cover behind

 Interrogation Chamber (imprisoned in the chair)
 You blink away memory. The dim room comes again into focus, and the man
 behind the desk.

 The man breathes out slowly; his eyes are soft with realization. "The
 ventilation duct. The ventilation duct."

 Still staring past you, he thumbs a switch on his desk. "Mobile Eight?"
 he says to the air. "Get down to the hallway where our friend was
 captured--" There is a muffled interruption. "Yes, I know you have. You
 missed a leaf. Open up ventilation grille M-2 and search inside. There
 should be a number of microelectronic tools inside, and a small bundle
 wrapped in cloth. Report to me immediately." He flicks the connection
 closed.

 The man spreads his hands apologetically. "I must look like a great
 fool," he says to you.

>yes
 He chuckles. "Well, I can plead an excuse; we rebuilt our ventilation
 system from the ground up, less than half a year ago. It's fenced and
 webbed and wired so that a grain of sand couldn't sneak through -- but
 only at the external intakes and the junctions. We never thought to
 check for an object cached just inside a vent. We never thought it
 would be a danger."

 He shrugs. "And it wasn't a danger, in fact, was it?"

>say no
 "No. We got you; you didn't get into the lab, much less get out
 afterwards. You moved a package from one hiding place to another. I
 still can't see--"

 A flashing light interrupts him. The man touches it, and nods. "I'll
 see soon. They're bringing it in."

>say no
 The man absently waves you to silence.

 A chime sounds. The man pounces on his controls, and then gestures
 impatiently towards the doorway.

 A guard enters. She gives you only a brief professional glance.
 Approaching the desk, she lays out a handful of small items.

 The man nods, dismissing her without a thought, and then stares. "This
 was all? Where's the package?"

 "With'?" asks the guard, puzzled.

 "Never mind. Go." His eyes are blazing on you as the guard slips out
 the doorway. "You. You have lied to me, and I am tired of it. I have
 had enough."

 There is no reply.

>say can i go now
 There is no reply.

 "You have not told me where the package really is."

 For acknowledgements and credits, please type "credits".

 An introductory note: To simplify the problem of dialogue in
 interactive fiction, the "tell" and "ask" commands are not used in this
 game. Your conversational options are limited to "yes," "no," and
 saying nothing at all. Trust me -- this isn't as big a deal as it
 sounds.

 Also, after some consideration, I have decided not to implement body
 parts -- head, arms, legs, hands -- as separate objects. If you feel a
 desire to refer to yourself, "me" will suffice.

 It is possible to make a fatal mistake in this game, but you will
 immediately know you have done so. You can always "undo" after death,
 and then fix the mistake. Therefore, the game is best played straight
 through. Accept any non-fatal mistakes that you may make; you will have
 a second chance. If you back up and replay each scene for maximum
 efficiency, avoiding all mistakes, certain aspects of the game will be
 lost.

 However -- you will eventually reach a point where things become
 dangerous. You'll know when. Beyond that, you're playing for keeps and
 heartbeats count. Save early and often.

 Do not expect Spider And Web to be anything like So Far or A Change in
 the Weather. It's not. In a certain sense, this is my first
 conventional game. In another sense, it's the strangest game I know,
 and understanding what's happening is entirely your problem.

 This game is free. But if you feel like sending me money, I won't
 refuse. If you feel like sending me comments or bug reports, I'll be
 ecstatic. As of the beginning of 1998, I am at

 His finger stabs down.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and
 grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The
 mountains were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is
 crusted with squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still
 flashes of its historic charm. You've seen spires above the streets --
 tiny green parks below tenements -- hidden jewels of fountains beyond
 walls. Any bland alley can conceal balconies wrought into iron
 gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers nurtured by who knows
 who.

 This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty
 brick, and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the
 courtesy of a handle. Maybe you should call it a day.

 End of Alley
 It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in
 three directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash. (Your
 guidebook warned you: the police are as efficient about litter laws as
 about everything else they do.) You can retreat to the south.

 A plain metal door faces you to the east, near the alley's end. It's
 firmly shut.

 Interrogation Chamber
 You are in a dim room, bounded by metal walls. A scarred pedestal
 stands empty where the chair was; facing it is an instrument-covered
 desk. Otherwise the room is sterile. The bright hallway waits to the
 south.

 The man is stretched on the floor, dazed and unmoving. The lines of
 his face are merely age, now.

 Scraps of metal lie around the pedestal, still visibly decaying.

 Your legs are beginning to itch fiercely.

>go south
 You step gingerly under the scan-web band. Silence. You recall, with
 some relief, that the man failed to turn it back on after the guard
 left.

 Security Annex
 This is the end of a short hallway, which runs southwest back to the
 main corridor. Three large doorways open to the north, east, and
 south.

>go southwest

 Angle Branch
 The corridor runs north and south, like every other hallway in this
 place. A short hallway branches off to the northeast. To the west is a
 blank metal door, with attendant black plate beside it.

>go south

 The white corridor runs east to west here, with a branch leading off
 to the north, and a closed metal door to the south. You can see that
 the east hall reaches a dead end a short distance away.

>go east

 Dead End South
 The corridor ends here, blank, with a single steel door on the north
 wall. The door is closed.

 The itch in your legs is nearly unbearable.

 The itching is slowly fading.

>get pick
 The pick comes free with a faint magnetic snap.

 The door begins to slide shut as soon as the pick loses its link.

>go north
 You slide hastily through the closing door. This time, you are careful
 to keep a firm grip on your lockpick.

 Wiring Closet
 You have barely room to spread your arms; this tiny square chamber is
 lined with cables, pipes, wires, and junction nodes. The only exit is
 the closing door to the south, which has a small white pad beside it.

 Resting on one of the larger junction nodes is a blast tab (connected
 to a radio module).

 The door closes completely.

>examine blast tab
 It's a small purple cube, which contains enough stabilized gel to blow
 a foot-wide hole in approximately anything. There's a minus link on
 one edge, which is connected to a radio module.

>examine radio
 It's a small purple box with a short antenna on one side, and a plus
 link on the other. The link is connected to a blast tab.

>inventory
 You are carrying a lockpick, a pen, a toolcase (which is open but
 empty), a pushbutton, a toggle switch, a scan scrambler (connected to
 a timer), a minilamp, a key transmitter and a voice transmitter.

>disconnect radio
 You disconnect the blast tab, and take the radio module as it turns
 black again. The key transmitter turns black as well.

 The itching is slowly fading.

>attach button to blast
 You connect the pushbutton to the blast tab. The pushbutton turns
 purple to confirm the match.

>push button
 Crack! You jerk back your finger as the blast tab goes off, shattering
 the junction node.

 The lights die, leaving you in stifling blind darkness.

 Darkness

 After several seconds, the lighting strips return to life, but they
 are very dim and pulsate unevenly. You find barely enough light to
 pick silhouettes out of the gloom. And the silence is oppressive. You
 realize that the constant hiss of ventilation died with the lights,
 and it has not returned.

 Wiring Closet (in dimness)
 You have barely room to spread your arms; this tiny square chamber is
 lined with cables, pipes, wires, and junction nodes. The only exit is
 the closed door to the south, which has a small white pad beside it.

 The largest junction node is a shattered ruin.

>touch white pad
 Nothing happens. You stare at the door in some embarrassment; of
 course it won't open without power.

 You sit down calmly to wait. It isn't too long before the guards come
 with crowbars to investigate the problem.

>go north

 Corner At Doors (in dimness)
 The hallway runs both east and south from here. There's a featureless

 closed to the north.

 One of the ceiling panels is missing, leaving a rectangular gap above
 you.

 the floor.

 Corridor Boundary (in dimness)
 The corridor angles here, and crosses a boundary of some sort as it
 does. A few strides down the southeast branch, a dotted red line
 crosses the floor. You can retreat from the boundary to the west.

 You're about to run out of options -- the intersection to the
 southeast is occupied. The guards there are not moving. They're
 watching in both directions, with their backs to a closed metal door.
 They don't seem to have seen you; you slide deeper into the shadows
 nonetheless.

>shoot guards
 (with the gun)
 You smile in the darkness.

 Two of the guards are unconscious in as many heartbeats. You shift
 your gun, straining for a better target among the shadows, and fire
 again. A third figure jerks and collapses. Then pulses are raining up
 the corridor at you, and you flatten yourself into cover.

>se

 Sharp Corner (in dimness)
 The corridor cuts around a sharp angle, from the northwest to the
 north. To the south, in the end wall, is the standard featureless
 metal door; it is closed.

 Three guards are standing in the angle, with three more motionless on
 the floor.

 You hit the corner at a dead run. The remaining guards break and fall
 aside, trying to aim and roll for cover simultaneously.

>go north

 Lab Junction (in dimness)
 The white corridor runs south and east from here, with a wide branch
 curving northwest towards the laboratory.

 You can see brighter light shining around the curve to the northwest.

 You tear up the hall, chased by pulse-fire.

 You freeze; there is movement up the corridor, to the south. It sounds
 like yet another group of guards, moving slowly but steadily in the
 darkness.

>go northwest
 The hallway curves west until it reaches the black door.

 Outside Laboratory
 The corridor from the east ends here, and a single door looms to the
 west. It's no larger than the doors you've seen elsewhere; but it
 somehow looks... heavy. Unyielding. Reinforcing struts cross the
 door's face, and the surface is sheathed with some black coating.

 The end of the hallway is still well-lit.

 You spin around, ready for pursuit, but no one appears.

>put rod on plate
 The pick locks itself rigidly to the black plate by the door. Its
 status dot flashes to yellow.

 You hear a voice from around the curve: "Wait."

>wait
 Time passes.

 You hear a startled "What?" from the southeast.

 The lockpick's status dot is sliding towards green.

 Your legs still itch. Just a bit.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Voices drift up the hall. "It's only one..." "...armed, took down
 nearly..." There appears to be some little debate.

 The lockpick's status dot is sliding towards green.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Look then, we'll get a pulse grenade, is that...?"

 The lockpick's status dot fades to pure green, and flicks steady blue.

 There is a hollow clunk somewhere. A moment later, the door swings
 towards you. The scent of ozone brushes through the doorway.

>get rod
 The pick comes free with a faint magnetic snap.

 The door begins to swing shut as soon as the pick loses its link.

 "Fine." "Fine then." "...Fine." Some of the guards sound a bit peeved.

>go west
 You duck through the closing door, keeping the lockpick firmly in
 hand.

 The Laboratory
 There is no question what this place is. The room is high, brightly
 lit -- this part of the building must have its own power supply -- and
 filled with arcane, half-built, and unlabelled machinery. The heavy
 door stands open to the east; there is a small white pad and an access
 panel beside it.

 At the center of the chaos, and its focus, is a great silver platform
 which is wrapped in a glittering cage of scan-web. A control console
 stands next to it. Cables run out across the floor, from the platform
 to the console, from the console to the walls, and tangle around a low
 cabinet off to one side.

 Much paper and clutter rests on a long wooden table against one wall.
 The table also supports a notably large black device. By the other
 wall is a clear space ringed with red, with some sort of mat inside
 it. A steel cube sits on the mat.

 The door booms shut.

>open panel
 You pull the panel open, revealing a layer of subcircuitry.

>shoot circuitry
 (with the gun)
 The layer of subcircuitry showers a corona of sparks. Blue light
 crackles along the subcircuit paths.

>save
>tangle2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine table
 There is a long wooden table against one wall. It is covered with
 astonishing piles of paper -- scraps, notes, diagrams, all spread
 unevenly around in varying stages of sortedness and immediacy.

 At one end of the table is a notable black device.

>examine papers
 You quickly sort through the papers, as best you can from your
 briefing lectures. In a few moments, you have piled up a single stack
 of the most critical diagrams, tables, formulae, and notes. Everything
 else is left scattered across the table in more disarray than when you
 started.

 While sorting, you discovered a logic plate buried under a spread of
 scribbled diagrams.

>examine plate
 It's a logic plate like most, though fairly large -- wider than your
 two spread hands. Circuit paths are dimly visible inside the smoky
 resin, and the edges sparkle with link bands.

 You hear voices outside. "Well?"

>get plate
 Taken.

>get papers
 (the stack of important papers)
 Taken.

 "The lock circuitry is knotted," comes a mumble from outside the door.
 "...must have done something..."

>read papers
 (the stack of important papers)
 You have no notion what any of it means, but it all matches the
 profile you were given of material relevant to the work done here.

 "We've got shock grenades. Should we blast?" There is a pause, and
 someone replies, "No, wait on that. Whatever's in the lab, the tech
 crowd will burst themselves if we fill it full of shrapnel."

>examine device
 The black device doesn't have the half-built, rigged quality of the
 other machinery nearby. It is curved, polished, and sleek. It has
 faired vents along the top. There is a round alcove in its front,
 which contains a glass pot. The only control is a tiny black switch.

>get pot
 Taken.

 A voice says, "Someone ask around for a gas cutter."

>examine pot
 It's a fat glass pot with a spout and a close-fitting lid, which
 leaves the spout open. There is a wooden handle on one side. The pot
 is empty; but the inside bottom surface seems to be crusted with some
 burnt substance.

>smell pot
 It smells faintly burnt.

>put papers in alcove
 (the stack of important papers in the notable device)
 You put the stack of important papers into the notable device.

 "Got anywhere with the lock?" you hear. There is an irritated mutter
 in reply.

>push tiny
 The tiny switch begins to glow red as you turn it on.

>open cabinet
 Opened. The cabinet is stuffed with blocks of subcircuitry and nests
 of ribbon-wiring. There is a gap at one point, however, as if a single
 logic plate had been removed.

>put plate in cabinet
 You slide the logic plate into the gap in the cabinet.

 The stack of important papers is yellowing with the heat.

>close cabinet
 You close the cabinet.

 "One of the techs thinks there's a cutter in South Storage," someone
 reports.

 Smoke begins to curl from the stack of important papers.

>wait
 Time passes.

 A corner of the stack of important papers flares alight.

>get papers
 (the stack of important papers)
 Taken.

 The stack of important papers is burning brightly now.

>put all on table
 stack of important papers: Done.
 glass pot: Done.

 minilamp: Done.

 voice transmitter: Done.

 "Right, bring that over here."

 The stack of important papers has set one of the other papers on the
 table alight.

>examine console
 There is a free-standing console next to the cage, facing it, with a
 view off to the side of the padded mat. On the console are two
 buttons, a grey oval of contact-pad substrate, a small rectangular
 display above the oval, and a readout strip. Hand-written labels are
 marked by each control.

 The readout strip says, "Shut down for logic adjustment."

 You hear a faint pop from the other side of the door. It is followed
 by vicious swearing.

 More of the papers on the table are burning now.

 Half of the stack of important papers has burned away.

>push upper
 There is a faint hum, and the display lights with a brightly colored
 waveform. The console readout blinks; it now says, "Ready."

 "I bet their equipment never fails just when it's needed," someone
 mutters.

>examine display
 The display shows a complex waveform. Several different components
 slice across the rectangle, like a rainbow of mountain ranges. You
 haven't the least understanding of what they mean.

 The flames on the table spread.

>push oval
 As the pressure on the oval moves, the waveform on the display mutates
 -- wave components slide up or down, shift color, change frequency.
 You cannot interpret the result... but a leap into the dark must be
 better than staying here.

 The stack of important papers is nearly consumed in flame.

>open flap
 You peel the flap of web away from its magnetic seals; it hangs open.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You catch, "...could be doing in there?" "Cursed if I know. They don't
 tell me what kind of toys they play with."

 With a hiss, fire leaps to another pile of paper. Most of the papers
 on the table are now aflame.

 The stack of important papers is submerged in the greater fire.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Got it!" you hear. The door does not move. "Or, perhaps not," the
 voice continues irritably.

 The surface of the table is a sheet of fire, in-swept and pulled high
 in the center.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The flames crackle.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Understand, it's been too long. Are there any explosives, things of
 that sort in there?" Someone farther away replies, "No, not that we've
 been told of."

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The wall above the table is beginning to catch. You can feel heat
 shining on your skin.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You hear running footsteps outside. "Found another one!" Someone
 exhales in relief.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 There is a tight hiss from outside. "There it runs," someone says.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Keep it steady, understand. We only need a hole big enough to fire
 through."

 The table itself is burning hotly now.

>push lower
 The hum intensifies, coming from all around you.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 5. Note: scan-web coverage not yet complete."

 "Look at the power readout. Something's going on in there," comes a
 worried mutter from outside. A louder voice calls, "Has the cursed
 Chief finished his cursed nap yet?"

>enter platform
 You step through the open flap and onto the platform.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 4. Note: scan-web coverage not yet complete."

 "Yes, he cursed has." The tone is dry and amused, but the familiar
 voice chills you. "What's the situation?"

 Flames are crawling up the wall. Smoke is thick across the ceiling --
 fortunately, high enough that you are still below it.

>close flap
 You pull the flap back against its seals, closing yourself in the
 cage.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 3."

 "It's under control, with'," someone says calmly. "The target is
 trapped in the lab. We're bringing up a cutter."

>wait
 Time passes.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 2."

 There is a choking sound. "Trapped in the-- in--" In all the hours you
 spent in his chair, you never heard that voice lost for words.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 1."

 "There's only one entrance, with-commander. We're standing in front of
 it," the voice continues, a little nervously now. "The walls are armor
 plate underneath. The ventilation system is secure. We haven't been
 briefed on any explosive or cutting equipment in the lab inventory.
 There's simply nowhere to go."

>cackle
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Nowhere..." the familiar voice begins, and there is a terrible
 silence.

 Then, "Blast it down," he says, very quietly. And screams, "BLAST IT!"

 But a light is pouring out around you, a sourceless glow that seems to
 shine straight through solidity, as if metal and plastic were starlit
 ice. The light builds and builds...

 Beyond the light you see the door burst open, with a distant,
 dreamlike roar. The lucent faces that crowd through seem to move in
 slow motion. Their guns are firing, but the pulses are frozen in
 space. You can see their eyes slide across you, the cage around you,
 the light -- the flames that are devouring everything that you leave
 behind.

 Then the world vanishes. Blackness slaps into you with a silent snap.

 "Nowhere," the familiar voice begins, but someone interrupts: "The

 "All right," the man continues after a moment. "All right. Blast the
 door down. Now, please."

 Orders, apparently, are orders. There is a deafening roar; the door
 tears into flying shards of metal. A hail of pulse-gun fire follows
 the blast in. You don't stand a moment's chance.

 heavy door stands closed to the east; there is a small white pad and
 an access panel beside it.

 At the center of the chaos, and its focus, is a great silver platform
 which is wrapped in a glittering cage of scan-web. A control console
 stands next to it. Cables run out across the floor, from the platform

 Much paper and clutter rests on a long wooden table against one wall.
 The table also supports a notably large black device. By the other

 The readout strip says, "Shut down for logic adjustment."

 "The lock circuitry is knotted," comes a mumble from outside the door.

 "We've got shock grenades. Should we blast?" There is a pause, and
 someone replies, "No, wait on that. Whatever's in the lab, the tech

 Scribbled between the grey oval and the display is the phrase
 "Destination waveform." The upper button says "Ready," and the lower
 button is labelled "Light the fire."

>open cabinet
 Opened. The cabinet is stuffed with blocks of subcircuitry and nests
 of ribbon-wiring. There is a gap at one point, however, as if a single
 logic plate had been removed.

 A voice says, "Someone ask around for a gas cutter."

 toolcase (which is open but empty), a toggle switch, a scan scrambler
 (connected to a timer), a minilamp, a key transmitter and a voice
 transmitter.

 "Nowhere..." the familiar voice begins, and there is a terrible
 silence.

 Then, "Blast it down," he says, very quietly. And screams, "BLAST IT!"

 But a light is pouring out around you, a sourceless glow that seems to
 shine straight through solidity, as if metal and plastic were starlit
 ice. The light builds and builds...

 Beyond the light you see the door burst open, with a distant,
 dreamlike roar. The lucent faces that crowd through seem to move in
 slow motion. Their guns are firing, but the pulses are frozen in
 space. You can see their eyes slide across you, the cage around you,
 the light.

 Then the world vanishes. Blackness slaps into you with a silent snap.

>restore
>tangle3
 Enter saved game to load: Ok.

>put papers on platform
 (the stack of important papers on the platform)
 You put the stack of important papers into the cage.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 4. Note: scan-web coverage not yet complete."

 "Yes, he cursed has." The tone is dry and amused, but the familiar
 voice chills you. "What's the situation?"

>close flap
 You push the flap back against its seals.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 3."

 "It's under control, with'," someone says calmly. "The target is
 trapped in the lab. We're bringing up a cutter."

>wait
 Time passes.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 2."

 There is a choking sound. "Trapped in the-- in--" In all the hours you
 spent in his chair, you never heard that voice lost for words.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 1."

 "There's only one entrance, with-commander. We're standing in front of
 it," the voice continues, a little nervously now. "The walls are armor
 plate underneath. The ventilation system is secure. We haven't been
 briefed on any explosive or cutting equipment in the lab inventory.
 There's simply nowhere to go."

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Nowhere..." the familiar voice begins, and there is a terrible
 silence.

 Then, "Blast it down," he says, very quietly. And screams, "BLAST IT!"

 But a light is pouring out of the scan-web cage, a sourceless glow
 that seems to shine straight through solidity, as if metal and plastic
 were starlit ice. The light builds and builds...

 ...and vanishes with a silent snap. The stack of important papers
 vanishes as well, leaving the cage empty.

 You shake your head in slow wonder. Unfortunately, a moment later, the
 guards outside recall you to yourself. There is a deafening roar; the
 door tears into flying shards of metal. A hail of pulse-gun fire
 follows the blast in. You don't stand a moment's chance.

 "Yes, he cursed has." The tone is dry and amused, but the familiar

>enter platform
 You step through the open flap and onto the platform.

 The console readout blinks; it now says, "Accumulators charging: pulse
 in 3. Note: scan-web coverage not yet complete."

 "It's under control, with'," someone says calmly. "The target is
 trapped in the lab. We're bringing up a cutter."

 You pull the flap back against its seals, closing yourself in the
 cage.
