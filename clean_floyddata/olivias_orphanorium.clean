 When young the orphan is commonly sent to an asylum, where by
 careful cultivation of its rudimentary sense of locality it is taught
 to know its place. It is then instructed in the arts of dependence and
 servitude and eventually turned loose to prey upon the world as a
 bootblack or scullery maid. -- Bierce
 You have always dreamed of becoming an orphanmaster, and now you are
 finally getting to live your dream! Can you rise to the challenge and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Junior House</span>
 Here are housed the younger children, from the age of weaning to about
 six years old (though with most of them, age is merely a rough guess).
 Formerly a lumber-room, its ceilings are oppressively low. The Middle
 House is to the north.

 In one corner, piled up into a small mountain, are the many volumes of
 Polychromatic Lung's Fairy Tales.

 Bart, Griselda and Miasmine are housed here.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Olivia's Orphanorium</span> was written for Cover Stories, a
 minicomp in which artists supplied pieces of cover art, after which
 authors each chose a cover and wrote an appropriate game. The games
 were coded in three weeks, plus a two-week testing period.

 The cover image was selected by Rowan Lipkovits, from Google's LIFE
 magazine photo archive; it is dated May 22, 1886, was taken by Wallace
 G. Levison in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and depicts one Isabel Harter,
 who is unlikely to have been an orphan.

 First published over a hundred years ago, Lung's Fairy Tales come in a
 variety of coloured covers, sturdy enough to resist chewing. These
 appear to form the complete set, and to be mostly first editions;
 signed bookplates indicate that they were donated to the Waifs and
 Strays Trust by the author.

 Skimming briefly through a few of the Tales, you are shocked at how
 gruesomely inappropriate they are for children; clearly these predate
 the more pure-minded Revised Edition. You shudder to think what
 schemes they might put into a child's head.

 The Government, firm in its belief that the private sector is
 best-equipped to reduce waste and deliver results, will pay you a
 stipend for each orphan and a further bonus for each child placed in a
 gainful profession. Since the Government wisely abhors handouts and
 rewarding failure, you will receive no funds for orphans escaped,
 deceased, or who upon their majority have failed to become productive
 citizens, ensuring their descent into vice. These are assumed to be
 the natural fates of the orphan, however, and will incur no penalty.

 For further reading, consider the entries on <span class="floydstyle i">discipline, vigour,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">looks, morale</span>.

>read discipline

 You can't see any such thing.

>look up discipline in manual

 Virtually all orphans have an unnatural want of <span class="floydstyle i">discipline</span>.
 Instilling discipline and a sense of the value of hard work is
 essential if they are ever to become productive members of society,
 and should be your highest priority. Your orphans must be made to
 understand that discipline is not just an abstract noun; it is is an
 active verb.


 (in Athaliah Hertford's Manual of Childcare):
 A crucial quality that most orphans lack is <span class="floydstyle i">vigour</span>. Orphans are
 by inclination lazy and weak, but this can be remedied with a firm
 hand. A robust orphan can earn you good money on treadmills, and may
 get a position doing menial hard labour -- laundries, the infantry,
 and the like. Never forget, however, that a strong, healthy orphan is
 better-equipped to escape.

>ask bart about himself

 Children are impervious to sense and reason. Your interactions with
 them must be kept simple, emphatic and unambiguous, as if you were
 training a dancing-bear or particularly stupid dolphin. They respond
 well to DISCIPLINE, may be tidied up by SCRUBBING, and should be kept
 occupied by ASSIGNING them to workstations.

>read about looks

 (in Athaliah Hertford's Manual of Childcare):
 Of no small importance in this fallen world are <span class="floydstyle i">looks</span>. Most
 orphans will resemble a diseased turnip no matter how much you SCRUB
 them, but a few may become presentable enough to earn posts as
 housemaids or footmen. A particularly angelic orphan might even be
 adopted by a respectable family, which is the best racket of all; but
 such happy providence is not to be relied upon.

>read about morale

 (in Athaliah Hertford's Manual of Childcare):
 Orphans are an ungrateful, unhealthy lot and may undergo a lack of
 mental and physical <span class="floydstyle i">morale</span>; this makes them prone to
 mischievious acts, such as escaping and dying of malnutrition. Be
 firm, and remember that without you they have no hope of any kind of
 true happiness.

 best-lit and airiest of the wards, its walls are decorated with
 inspiring murals. The Middle House lies to the south.

 features and somewhat blank expressions, enthusiastically applying
 themselves to various forms of wholesome industry. The jobs depicted

 would find gainful employment as cycle-rickshaw pilots, a dream dashed

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Middle House</span>
 This ward is the home of children aged between six and twelve. A
 series of oddly-shaped rooms produced by ill-considered renovations,
 it's difficult to heat, the lighting is bad and there are far too many
 blind corners and hideaways. The Junior House lies south and the
 Senior north.

 Lloyd and Lynn are housed here.

 Randall is busily occupied with the ancient tricycles.


 You can't see any such thing.


 Behold: Randall Sharp, son of a deserter and a vacuous exotic dancer.
 His discipline is poor, his vigour bad, his appearance bad and his
 morale poor.

 This is Lynn Cotter, brat of a cuckold and a slovenly doxy.
 Her discipline is bad, her vigour poor, her appearance bad and her
 morale poor.

 You are graced by the presence of Lloyd Anderson, offspring of a
 shittenly bagpipe-player and a Sicilian safe-cracker.
 His discipline is bad, his vigour poor, his appearance bad and his
 morale poor.


 You seize Lloyd, pinch his cheeks until they take on a healthy red
 colour, and scrub him all over with turpentine and a pumice-stone.
 This accomplished, you deliver a short lecture on the spiritual and
 bacterial dangers of filthiness. Hopefully the lesson is learned; his
 looks are now poor.


 You apply some well-deserved discipline to Lloyd Anderson. His
 discipline is now bad.


 Lloyd Anderson, son of a shittenly bagpipe-player and a Sicilian
 safe-cracker.
 His discipline is poor, his vigour bad, his appearance poor and his
 morale poor. And this is what you have to work with.


 You command Lloyd Anderson to occupy himself with the ancient
 tricycles. He obediently complies.


 You apply some well-deserved discipline to Lynn Cotter. Her discipline
 is now bad.

 An official Ministry courier delivers a large brown-paper package.
 Within is a doorstop of a book: the famed industry catalogue
 Fobberfish of Hackney's. There is a cover letter from Mr. Fobberfish
 himself, congratulating you on your appointment, expressing pleasure
 at the prospect of working together and solidarity as a
 fellow-contracter, drawing your attention to the superior,
 competitively-priced products supplied by his humble business, and
 suggesting that they might be brought into fruitful conjunction with
 your Ministry funds.

>examine catalogue

 A respected specialist catering to the orphan management trade,
 Fobberfish of Hackney provides a wide variety of goods at virtually
 affordable rates. Bowing to the decadence of the age, this
 once-respectable publication now features many vain luxuries that you
 can safely ignore, such as fair-trade gruel, artisanal wildflower
 soap, and smallpox vaccines. The few items of real utility have been
 circled in red pen:

 Ruritanian Mastiffs (400 coins)
 The Box (300 coins)
 Atherton's Ergonomic Treadmill (400 coins)
 My First Delousing Bath (350 coins)
 Spinal Corrective Corsets (450 coins)
 Dr. Pranger's Lithium Water (700 coins)
 triple-barred windows (350 coins)
 The Harvest of Sin (700 coins)

 (in Fobberfish of Hackney's catalogue):
 Much-beloved Christian artist Stowey Downard's previous works include
 <span class="floydstyle em">Chartists: Vanguard of Lucifer</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">Whorish Shame</span> and
 the fifty-panel series <span class="floydstyle em">Christ's Vengeance</span>. Now he has been
 inspired to create his most morally instructive work yet, <span class="floydstyle em">The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Harvest of Sin</span>, a series of 35 anatomical diagrams depicting the
 shocking consequences of pre-marital flirting. Highly scientific
 lithographs illuminate the diseased body's foulness in unflinching
 detail, and may be depended upon to foster a healthsome disgust of the
 sexual acts. Do not, in moral timorousness, shrink from letting your
 child know where sin must lead: order <span class="floydstyle em">The Harvest of Sin</span>
 today.

>read about water

 (in Fobberfish of Hackney's catalogue):
 The world-renowned Dr. Pranger has discovered that pathological and
 criminal behaviours are rooted in patterns of thought established in
 childhood. Attempts to improve society will inevitably fail,
 therefore, without a bold application of behavioural pharmacology from
 earliest youth, particularly in those classes that produce the
 overwhelming mass of the criminal and insane. His patented Lithium
 Formula, added to the drinking-water of your orphanage, juvenile
 prison, refugee camp or poor-house, is the necessary first step to a
 brighter future.


 Lynn Cotter, daughter of a cuckold and a slovenly doxy.
 Her discipline is poor, her vigour poor, her appearance bad and her
 morale poor.


 You command Lynn Cotter to occupy herself with the ancient tricycles.
 She obediently complies.


 Randall Sharp, son of a deserter and a vacuous exotic dancer.
 His discipline is poor, his vigour bad, his appearance poor and his
 morale bad. It is difficult to remember that he was formed by God.

 Lynn Cotter, daughter of a cuckold and a slovenly doxy.
 Her discipline is poor, her vigour poor, her appearance bad and her

 her Creator.

 Lloyd Anderson, progeny of a shittenly bagpipe-player and a Sicilian
 safe-cracker.
 His discipline is bad, his vigour poor, his appearance poor and his
 morale poor.

>read about bath

 (in Fobberfish of Hackney's catalogue):
 My First Delousing Bath introduces the young child to the painful,
 demeaning concept of personal hygiene. With regular use, it is
 guaranteed to remove all but the most deeply-embedded skin parasites.


 You assign Randall, Lynn and Lloyd to the ancient tricycles.


 Thus far, zero orphans have passed through your hands, of whom zero
 have made anything of themselves. Your treasury has 112 coins.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Junior House</span>
 Here are housed the younger children, from the age of weaning to about
 six years old. Formerly a lumber-room, its ceilings are oppressively
 low. The Middle House is to the north.

 In one corner, piled up into a small mountain, are the many volumes of
 Polychromatic Lung's Fairy Tales.

 Griselda and Miasmine are housed here.


 You flog off Polychromatic Lung's Fairy Tales for the knock-down price
 of 350 coins, cash in hand.

>read about treadmill

 (in Fobberfish of Hackney's catalogue):
 Atherton's Ergonomic Treadmill produces a negligible quantity of
 electrical power, but (more importantly) its persistent use
 strengthens the thighs, calves and buttocks of older children, while
 teaching them the value of a hard day's work.


 What you do outside work hours and the Orphanorium is not the concern
 of this story. <span class="floydstyle em">(The Middle House is to the north.)</span>


 Griselda Grimwig, daughter of a hog-grease hawker and a Salopian
 landlady.
 Her discipline is poor, her vigour bad, her appearance poor and her

 Miasmine Grimes, secret daughter of an unwashed goat-butcher and a
 joyless seamstress.
 Her discipline is bad, her vigour awful, her appearance poor and her
 morale poor.


 You reluctantly part with 350 coins, mail in your order, and in due
 course receive delivery of My First Delousing Bath; it is installed in
 the Junior House.


 You assign Griselda and Miasmine to My First Delousing Bath.


 My First Delousing Bath has brightened Griselda Grimwig's looks, which

 You receive a government stipend of 60 for the feeding and care of

 most of it going on food.
 Your profligate meal plans have borne fruit: Lloyd Anderson has gained
 vigour, and Miasmine Grimes, Randall Sharp and Lynn Cotter have
 improved their morale.


 Griselda Grimwig, daughter of a hog-grease hawker and a Salopian
 landlady.
 Her discipline is mediocre, her vigour poor, her appearance mediocre
 and her morale mediocre. She is a drain on the character of this

 joyless seamstress.
 Her discipline is poor, her vigour awful, her appearance mediocre and

 Sheltered by the guardian wings of the Orphanorium, it is unlikely
 that Bart Blunkett had encountered the works of Fariq Nasty before
 this campaign. In the lax moral environment of the outside world,
 however, the Ladies' Auxiliary was unable to protect him. With
 animalistic cunning and impulse control, he managed to elude his
 guardians, sneak into a Tympanic Five event, and the tale's end can
 scarcely be imagined. If he has not already had his organs plucked
 forth and flung wetly before the altar of Astarte, he is doubtless
 cavorting like a latter-day satyr in a marihuana-smogged omnibus.
 Infamy! infamy!

 The Ladies' Auxiliary, desperately embarrassed, pays you rather more
 compensation than is strictly necessary, with the understanding that
 regarding this matter you will shut your pie-hole henceforth.

 A new task: <span class="floydstyle i">Little Hands</span>
 An engine in the local textile mill has suffered a catastrophic
 blockage, and none of the mill-workers are small enough to wriggle
 inside its workings to unclog it. While child labour laws forbid the
 mill from employing minors, there is a certain degree of ambiguity
 about whether it can <span class="floydstyle em">contract</span> them. If you can lend them a
 particularly small orphan to crawl about in machinery for a few hours,
 the foreman is willing to extend a little cash. <span class="floydstyle em">(Use RECRUIT on a</span>

 (in Fobberfish of Hackney's catalogue):
 Since time immemorial, orphans have taken advantage of their loose

 single and double. Against the triple bar, however, their imagination
 revolts. The triple-barred window is an iron-clad, welded, reinforced
 assurance against escape.

 series of oddly-shaped rooms produced by ill-considered renovations,
 it's difficult to heat, the lighting is bad and there are far too many
 blind corners and hideaways. The Junior House lies south and the
 Senior north.

 The aroma of dark beer saturates the building.

 Griselda is housed here.

 Lynn is busily occupied with the ancient tricycles.

>examine all

 Griselda Grimwig, brat of a hog-grease hawker and a Salopian landlady.
 Her discipline is mediocre, her vigour poor, her appearance mediocre
 and her morale mediocre.

 Lynn Cotter, brat of a cuckold and a slovenly doxy.
 Her discipline is poor, her vigour adequate, her appearance poor and
 her morale poor. You dread to imagine her future.

>discipline griselda

 You apply some well-deserved discipline to Griselda Grimwig. Her
 discipline is now mediocre.

>assign griselda to tricycles

 You command Griselda Grimwig to occupy herself with the ancient
 tricycles. She obediently complies.

>unassign lynn

>discipline lynn

 Enough for today: there are regulations about excessive corporal
 punishment. Besides, if you thrash every child continually, they'll
 grow leathery and insensate.

 A respected specialist catering to the orphan management trade,
 Fobberfish of Hackney provides a wide variety of goods at virtually
 affordable rates. Bowing to the decadence of the age, this
 once-respectable publication now features many vain luxuries that you
 can safely ignore, such as fair-trade gruel, artisanal wildflower
 soap, and smallpox vaccines. The few items of real utility have been
 circled in red pen:

 Ruritanian Mastiffs (400 coins)
 The Box (300 coins)
 Atherton's Ergonomic Treadmill (400 coins)
 Spinal Corrective Corsets (450 coins)
 Dr. Pranger's Lithium Water (700 coins)
 triple-barred windows (350 coins)
 The Harvest of Sin (700 coins)

>order box

 Your profligate meal plans have borne fruit: Griselda Grimwig has

 Nettie Burrow has grown up a little, and been transferred to the

 The Orphanorium has been entrusted with three more children: Frank
 Trundle is old enough for the Middle House, while Lexie Rudge and
 Abstinence Rostigraben will go to the Junior.

 While not particularly graphic in its depiction, this game is
 centrally about the institutional mistreatment of children, in which
 the player character is instrumental. That considered, do you wish to
 continue?
>yes

 When young the orphan is commonly sent to an asylum, where by
 careful cultivation of its rudimentary sense of locality it is taught
 to know its place. It is then instructed in the arts of dependence and
 servitude and eventually turned loose to prey upon the world as a
 bootblack or scullery maid. -- Bierce

 Her discipline is bad, her vigour poor, her appearance bad and her

 This is Dick Kennedy, regrettable son of a bellhop and a ball-breaking
 garbage-sifter.
 His discipline is poor, his vigour poor, his appearance mediocre and

 Frank Trundle, whelp of a conniving scabrous arsonist and a scrawny
 third-rate dungcart driver.
 His discipline is mediocre, his vigour poor, his appearance bad and

 Nettie Burrow, daughter of a guttersnipe and a screever.
 Her discipline is mediocre, her vigour awful, her appearance mediocre

 You are graced by the presence of Annie Whittle, child of an Armenian
 New Jersey pimp and a deranged decadent barmaid.
 Her discipline is bad, her vigour poor, her appearance poor and her

>scrub annie

 You seize Annie, pinch her cheeks until they take on a healthy red
 colour, and apply a rough brush to those parts of her person that she
 has neglected to keep to a hygienic standard. This accomplished, you
 deliver a short lecture on the spiritual and bacterial dangers of
 filthiness. Hopefully the lesson is learned; her looks are now poor.

 Her discipline is awful, her vigour poor, her appearance bad and her

 and a diseased informer.
 Her discipline is adequate, her vigour bad, her appearance poor and

 Bianca Bloggs, discarded product of a wandering outlaw and a hideous

 Her discipline is bad, her vigour awful, her appearance bad and her

 octoroon ingenue.
 Her discipline is poor, her vigour awful, her appearance poor and her

 His discipline is awful, his vigour mediocre, his appearance awful and

 A new task: <span class="floydstyle i">Torchbearer</span>
 Senator Hoofey dearly loves to cruise leafy avenues in his Escalade.
 To do so in appropriate style requires a full formal escort, including
 a small child with a flaming torch to run ahead and announce his
 passage. Little is required of this child except the ability to run in
 a straight line without expiring, and the pragmatic requirement that
 they be both cheap and legal. A shady aide has raised the possibility
 of transferring guardianship for a small consideration, if a suitable
 child can be found. <span class="floydstyle em">(Use RECRUIT on a suitable orphan.)</span>

 This ward is the home of children aged between six and twelve. A

 Miasmine Grimes, daughter of an unwashed goat-butcher and a joyless
 seamstress.
 Her discipline is mediocre, her vigour poor, her appearance adequate
 and her morale poor.

 Abstinence Rostigraben, daughter of a deserter and a vacuous exotic
 dancer.
 Her discipline is mediocre, her vigour abysmal, her appearance poor
 and her morale mediocre. This is totally unacceptable.

 Paige Cruft, unnecessary daughter of a miserable consumptive hunchback
 and a diseased informer.
 Her discipline is mediocre, her vigour awful, her appearance adequate
 and her morale poor.

 This is Dick Kennedy, unfortunate son of a bellhop and a ball-breaking
 garbage-sifter.
 His discipline is mediocre, his vigour mediocre, his appearance
 mediocre and his morale poor. If families of good stock do not take
 their responsibilities seriously, his kind will inherit the earth in a
 few short generations.

 Nettie Burrow, progeny of a guttersnipe and a screever.
 Her discipline is mediocre, her vigour poor, her appearance poor and
 her morale mediocre. This is totally unacceptable.

 Annie Whittle, regrettable daughter of an Armenian New Jersey pimp and
 a deranged decadent barmaid.

 A new task: <span class="floydstyle i">Path to the Nest of Spiders</span>
 Ever since Slophouse & Sons started sourcing gruel ingredients from
 Ruritania, you have occasionally found a Ruritanian Misanthrope spider
 lurking at the bottom of a box of dehydrated oat-scrapings. Now,
 however, it seems that one has escaped and started to breed. The bite
 of the Ruritanian Misanthrope is not usually fatal, but the necrosis
 it causes is both painful and unsightly. Unless you want an
 establishment full of blotchy, keening orphans, you had better search
 for the nest and deal with it.

 Aha! There has surely been a nest here not too long ago: empty egg
 casings, thick froths of web, the husks of infant spiders devoured by
 their siblings. Alas, it's here no longer. But the exodus was not
 covert: a trail leads you to an old bricked-up chimney flue, spidery
 holes punctuating its rotten mortar.

>search chimney

 There's not much you can do while it's all bricked up.

>take bricks

 That's hardly portable.

 Soft moaning would suggest that Dick Kennedy has been attacked by a
 Ruritanian Misanthrope spider.

>open bricks

 The mortar crumbles easily under the slightest impact, and you are
 able to tear down half the wall with your bare hands. Out tumble
 several mummified pigeons, a great deal of soot and brick dust, and a
 scattering of panicked spiders that are instantly stomped upon by
 gleeful orphans. The chimney's jagged mouth is revealed, ominous wisps
 of web leading up into darkness.

 A howl of agony would suggest that Paige Cruft has been bitten by a
 Ruritanian Misanthrope spider.

 Two children up a chimney at once might seem more efficient, but only

 A penetrating wail would suggest that Jill has been bitten by a
 Ruritanian Misanthrope spider.

 In a sudden explosion of soot and insecticide fumes, Red emerges from
 the fireplace. He is rather horribly bitten and has inhaled a
 considerable quantity of soot, neurotoxins and spider legs, but his
 triumph over the spiders is undeniable. The orphans give up a ragged
 cheer, Red gets a double helping of gruel at supper, a man is called
 in to brick up the chimney, and life in the Orphanorium returns to
 normal.

 largest, best-lit and airiest of the wards, its walls are decorated
 with inspiring murals. The Middle House lies to the south.

 Atherton's Ergonomic Treadmill stands grimly against one wall.

 Lexie and Paige are housed here.

>assign all to treadmill

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Middle House</span>
 This ward is the home of children aged between six and twelve. A
 series of oddly-shaped rooms produced by ill-considered renovations,
 it's difficult to heat, the lighting is bad and there are far too many
 blind corners and hideaways. The Junior House lies south and the
 Senior north.

 Liddy, Deedee, Prudence and Dick are housed here.

 Modesty is spending some time in The Box.

 Bianca is busily occupied with the ancient tricycles.

>unassign modesty

 You allow Modesty Schmeer to take a break.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Junior House</span>
 Here are housed the younger children, from the age of weaning to about
 six years old. Formerly a lumber-room, its ceilings are oppressively
 low. The Middle House is to the north.

 From an obscure corner, My First Delousing Bath gives off
 sanitary-smelling vapours.

 Betty, Candice, Sharon, Tug and Becky are housed here.

 Tawny is spending some time in The Box.

>unassign tawny

 You allow Tawny Raskolnikov to take a break.

>assign all to bath

 You assign Tawny, Betty, Candice, Tug, Becky and Sharon to My First
 Delousing Bath.

>examine all

 Tawny Raskolnikov, daughter of a hog-grease hawker and a Salopian
 landlady.
 Her discipline is bad, her vigour poor, her appearance bad and her
 morale bad. She must apply herself and try to please her keepers and
 her Creator.

 Betty Scound, unfortunate whelp of a conniving scabrous arsonist and a
 scrawny third-rate dungcart driver.
 Her discipline is abysmal, her vigour poor, her appearance poor and
 her morale poor. She is a drain on the character of this
 establishment.

 You are graced by the presence of Candice Knoxville, daughter of a
 deadbeat hunchback and an adulteress.
 Her discipline is bad, her vigour poor, her appearance bad and her
 morale mediocre. She is a perpetual disappointment.

 Tug Good, unhappy whelp of an odious witless dealer in anatomically
 instructive text adventures and an illiterate Scouse customs agent.
 His discipline is poor, his vigour poor, his appearance poor and his
 morale poor.

 Becky Baffle, discarded daughter of a bourgeois soap-dodger and a
 rouge-caked feminist scullery-maid.
 Her discipline is mediocre, her vigour bad, her appearance poor and
 her morale poor.

 Sharon Trotter, brat of a slimy bisexual creator of unseemly
 unauthorised sequels and a craven brewer.
 Her discipline is bad, her vigour poor, her appearance bad and her
 morale poor. Yet Jesus loves her, as if He had not suffered enough.

>discipline betty

 You apply some well-deserved discipline to Betty Scound. Her
 discipline is now bad.

 series of oddly-shaped rooms produced by ill-considered renovations,
 it's difficult to heat, the lighting is bad and there are far too many

 The Box is installed in a remote sub-basement, but the way to it is
 well-known to the miscreant and lolligagger.

 Liddy, Deedee, Prudence, Modesty and Dick are housed here.

 Bianca is busily occupied with the ancient tricycles.

>scrub modesty

 You seize Modesty, spit-wash her grimy little face with your
 second-best handkerchief, and make her walk around with a book on her
 head. This accomplished, you deliver a short lecture on the spiritual
 and bacterial dangers of filthiness. Hopefully the lesson is learned;
 her looks are now poor.

>assign liddy to box

 Stern but fair, you condemn Liddy Hodges to The Box until further
 notice. She folds herself into one of its compartments, and you lock
 the door.

>assign dee dee to box

 You can't see any such thing.

>assign dee to box

>assign deedee to box

 To show that discipline must be upheld, you condemn Deedee Dobson to
 The Box until further notice. She folds herself into one of its

 You command Modesty Schmeer to occupy herself with the ancient
 tricycles. She obediently complies.

 Lexie Rudge has fabricated a surviving relative and escaped! Out in
 the harsh world children are exposed to all manner of sinful
 influences, so you are not surprised when, later, you receive reports
 that she is shamefully employed as a slovenly trull.

 You receive a government stipend of 130 for the feeding and care of
 your orphans; and pay out 39 coins on necessary care and maintenance,
 most of it going on food.
 Your profligate meal plans have borne fruit: Prudence Grady has gained
 vigour, and Deedee Dobson and Becky Baffle have improved their morale.

 A generous patron, impressed by Paige Cruft's ingrained servility and
 coltish grace, has offered her employment as a cosmetics salesgirl.
 For your success as an educator, the Government awards you a bonus of
 50 coins.

 Becky Baffle has been moved to the Middle House, being of sufficient
 age. Modesty Schmeer is ready for the Senior.

 You have been awarded custody of four orphans of Junior House age:
 Peony Maquereau, Boris Nettle, Beau Gomper and Nevada Froome.
