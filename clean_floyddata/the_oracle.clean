 The drums of war have beaten long throughout the land of your
 forefathers.  At night, the fiendish glow of enemy campfires has shone
 orange and horrible on the horizon for as many years as you can recall.
 The warriors of your land have battled long and valiantly against the
 demon hordes pressing relentlessly forward, assailing your
 ever-diminishing borders.  The fight has been mighty, but the strength
 of your people has begun to wane.  Only a few of the warriors remain to
 lead the rag-tag brigades of youthful peasants into battle.

 The council of elders has seen that it is not long before the invaders
 will breach the skirmish lines and plunder the farms and villages of
 your homeland.  The council has decreed that after centuries of
 silence, the voice of the great oracle must be heard once more if this
 horrible foe is to be repelled.

 Barely old enough to follow the warriors into battle, you were filled
 with great pride when you were selected as the messenger who would be
 sent to beg the great oracle for her counsel.  The elders summoned you
 into the great hall, admonishing you to stay on the old path leading
 into the high mountains.  After precious few other words of
 instruction, they sent you on your way.

 For many days now, you have trod the ancient trail, winding higher and
 higher into the rugged peaks of the Black Mountains.  Cold, hungry and
 alone, you somehow sense that you are nearing the oracle's hiding place
 deep within the great mountain.  At last, the crumbling path fades away
 at the foot of a vast wall of solid rock

 The Oracle
 Version 1.5 by Brandon Allen

 Cliff Base
    The greatest peak of the Black Mountains rises sharply before you;
 an impenetrable dagger of dark granite jutting high into the clouds
 above.  You stand at the base of an immense cliff, where a deep alcove
 has been chiseled from the living rock.  It almost appears to be the
 yawning mouth of a great, black cave.  As you stand at its entrance you
 can see steps cut from the jagged stone, leading southward into the
 bowels of the mountain.

>examine cliff
 The great mountain soars high above you, its lofty peak disappearing
 into the clouds overhead.  Before you, a great cliff rises abruptly,
 stretching far up the mountain's northern face.  At the very foot of
 the cliff, a deep alcove has been hollowed out.

>examine me
 You are tall for your seventeen years, despite your meager existence on
 the farm.  The tattered clothes of a peasant adorn your lanky frame.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>examine cave
 The alcove is quite large, and you cannot see from here how deeply the
 stairway delves into the vast wall of stone.

>enter cave
 Empty Stairway
    The stone steps continue southward, descending deeper into the
 mountain.  Here, the steps are less well defined.  The previously
 smooth stone is littered with rubble that has fallen into the stairway
 over the centuries.  The echoing sound of dripping water fills this
 place with a sense of dampness and cold.  Less light penetrates from
 the entrance far above and it is becoming more difficult to negotiate
 the slippery stones.

>examine stones
 The boulders, like the rest of this dark passage, are mottled granite.

>examine steps
 Behind you the stone steps climb steeply upward, as if yearning for the
 pale daylight that spills in through the entrance above.  Downward,
 they quickly decay into an irregular slope of boulders.

>examine rubble
 I don't see any rubble here.

>go south
 Cavern
    You are in a great, damp cavern, carved from hard granite by the
 incessant fingers of rainwater trickling down through the heart of the
 great mountain.  Along the cavern's western wall, a small stream
 emerges from a crevice in the solid rock.  The stream splashes downward
 over the tumble of stones that make up the cavern's floor until it
 vanishes beneath an iron door.  The door is set in a small hollow where
 the southernmost extremity of the cavern's roof dips down toward the
 jagged floor.  Against the western wall is a pile of loose shale that
 seems incongruent with the larger stones that make up the balance of
 the cavern's floor.

 As you crawl deeper into the dark cavern, you notice that the amulet
 hanging about your neck begins to glow with a wan, greenish light.  It
 seems to grow brighter as the fading light from above dwindles to
 darkness.  The amulet provides you with just enough illumination to see
 by.

>inventory
 You have a golden amulet (being worn).

>examine amulet
 It is the golden amulet the council of elders gave you as you set out
 on your journey.  It is quite finely made, probably well beyond the
 skills of the smithies of your land, it must have come from some
 far-off place.

 The council commanded you sternly to wear it at all times.  One of the
 most grizzled and ancient of the elders seized your shoulder in an iron
 grip, his tangled, silver brow knitted in a grim glare.  He told you
 that the amulet was necessary to summon the oracle from her hiding
 place.  "When all is prepared," he growled, "cast the amulet into the
 heart of the mountain."

>drink stream
 The stream's water is clear, cold and delicious.

>examine stream
 The stream emerges from a crevice in the wall and splashes southward
 through the cavern where it disappears beneath the iron door.

>examine rubble
 I don't see any rubble here.

>examine shale
 Heaped against the western wall is a loose pile of stone shards.

>search it
 You rummage through the jagged flakes of rock, the sharp edges biting
 into your bare hands.  Hidden just below the surface, you uncover a
 rusted iron chain.  It is threaded between the stones as if it had been
 intentionally concealed.

>examine chain
 The chain is about the thickness of you thumb, and is crusted with
 brown-red rust.

>examine door
 The door has been beaten from a single, great slab of iron.  It is as
 tall as a man, and almost equally wide.  Its hinges are set in the
 solid stone of the cavern's walls.  It is locked with a great padlock
 which has rusted terribly over the centuries.

>open door
 It's locked.

>pull chain
 You pull at the chain, drawing a portion of its length out from between
 the boulders that make up the cavern's floor.  One end appears to be
 fastened to the very stone that forms this chamber.  The other end is
 attached to something that rests, concealed, in the stream.  It feels
 as though another sturdy tug on the chain would free it from its hiding
 place.

>pull chain
 You pull again at the rusted chain.  A long metal box hauls out of the
 stream and clatters to a rest on one of the stones.

>examine box
 The box is constructed from thick copper plates bound together with
 iron straps and rivets.  It is narrow, perhaps a hand's breadth across,
 and if stood on end it would probably reach waist height.  The iron
 chain is fastened to a sturdy padeye, riveted to the box at one end.

>open box
 The metal box creaks open.  Resting within is a great sword, badly
 rusted and decayed.

>examine sword
 The sword was once a beautiful weapon, but centuries of immersion in
 the stream have nearly destroyed it.  Its once brilliant blade is now
 pitted with rust.  The leather binding of its grip has long since
 disintegrated.  You wonder at how such an exquisite treasure came to
 rest in this cavern.  It must have been hidden ages ago as an offering
 to the great oracle.

>get it
 Taken.

 [Your score has increased.]

>clean sword
 The rusted sword looks a bit cleaner now.

>hit padlock with sword
 You deal the padlock a mighty blow with the ancient sword.  The padlock
 beats against the great door with a resonant clang.  The force of the
 blow sends a painful jolt through your hands and arms.  The lock is
 badly damaged and appears almost ready to fall apart, but the rusted
 metal still holds the great door shut.

>lick it
 I don't know the word "lick".

>hit padlock with sword
 You deal the padlock a mighty blow with the ancient sword.  The
 padlock's hasp cracks in two and the door's latch swings open.

>open door
 You push against the door's cold metal with all your strength, but the
 ancient hinges, caked with rust, hold fast.

 Then with a crack, the hinges break free and the great door grinds open
 with an ear-splitting creak.

 the larger stones that make up the balance of the cavern's floor.  A
 rusted iron chain has been exposed among these shards of rock.  The
 chain snakes across the uneven floor and attatches to a long metal box.

>go south
 Stone Altar
    This space was hollowed out of the solid stone of the mountain,
 chisel-marks from the ancient laborers can still be seen on its rough
 hewn walls.  The room is slightly oval shaped with a squat, stone altar
 set on the floor at its southernmost end.  A metal chime, heavily
 corroded after centuries of neglect, hangs from a stand mounted at one
 of its ends.  A rivulet of clear water splashes into the room through a
 doorway that enters from the north.  The stream flows placidly down the
 room's length and disappears through an iron grate set in the floor
 just in front of the altar.

 An open archway exits eastward.

>examine alta
 I don't know the word "alta".

>examine altar
 The altar is a waist-high, rectangular block of rough-hewn stone.  Its
 top and sides are dotted and streaked with mineral stains from the
 water dripping incessantly upon it.  Three interlocking rings are
 carved into its front- perhaps a mystical symbol of some kind.  A metal
 chime, caked with filth and corrosion, is suspended above the altar at
 one end.

>examine rings
 The altar is a waist-high, rectangular block of rough-hewn stone.  Its
 top and sides are dotted and streaked with mineral stains from the
 water dripping incessantly upon it.  Three interlocking rings are
 carved into its front- perhaps a mystical symbol of some kind.  A metal
 chime, caked with filth and corrosion, is suspended above the altar at
 one end.

>examine chime
 The chime is a section of metal pipe, perhaps the length of your
 forearm.  It is crusted with a heavy beard of blue-green scale.

>examine grate
 The stream disappears down through this heavy, moss-covered, iron grate
 set firmly into the stone floor.

>open grate
 The grate is solidly fixed to the stone floor.

>ring chime
 The chime rings out, its tone is sharp, clear and of quite high pitch.

>examine grate
 The stream disappears down through this heavy, moss-covered, iron grate
 set firmly into the stone floor.

>hit chime
 The chime rings out.  Again the note is clear and bright, but it seems
 to be of a distinctly lower pitch than before.

>hit chime
 The chime rings out with a low, throaty tone, surprisingly clear for
 its apparent decay.

 Incredibly, fine lines seem to etch themselves into the altar's smooth
 top.  The lines join to form a rectangle which includes almost all of
 the altar's upper surface.  The stone within the rectangle suddenly
 vanishes revealing a wide chimney leading down, directly through the
 altar, into darkness.  A few grains of sand, which have crumbled away
 from the altar's surface, spill down into the chimney and disappear.

 As quickly as they appeared, the chimney and the lines in the stone
 vanish, leaving the altar exactly as it was before.

 You feel the stone vaporize beneath you followed by the terrifying,
 sickening sensation of falling.  Blackness surrounds you, and you
 continue to fall.

 With a crash that sounds like a clap of thunder, you plunge into a
 frigid, underground lake.  You are stung with icy cold as the water
 quickly soaks your clothing.  You break the surface gasping and
 sputtering, fighting to keep your breath.

 Flooded Chamber, Surface of Water
    You are treading water in a large chamber that has been almost
 completely flooded by a waterfall that crashes down from somewhere high
 above you in the darkness.

 You are on the open lake.  Dark water surrounds you on all sides.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Saved.

>go east
 You swim eastward.

 Flooded Chamber, Surface of Water
    You are near the chamber's eastern wall.  The damp stone continues
 into darkness toward the north and south.  Oddly there seems to be a
 faint undertow here.  The dark water seems to be tugging you softly
 down, beneath its black surface.

>go down
 You draw in a deep breath and dive below the surface of the ice-cold
 water.

 Flooded Chamber, Underwater
    You are near the chamber's eastern wall.  The stone wall continues
 to the north and south.  A submerged passageway opens toward the east.
 You notice a gentle current flowing past you into the dark opening.

>go east
 You swim eastward into the dark passageway.  The force of the current
 grows stronger and stronger until it sweeps you helplessly along.  In
 the darkness you scrape against the uneven stone walls and are pounded
 mercilessly into submerged boulders.  Your lungs burn with the desire
 for breath, but the cold water refuses to release you from its icy
 grip.  Consciousness begins to slip away from you.  The roaring, black
 water and jagged stones are fading into warm, gray oblivion...

 You are slammed back into wakefulness when your body is hurled over the
 precipice of a subterranean waterfall and spilled into an underground
 river flowing swiftly beneath the great mountain.  The river's dark
 channel is not completely submerged, and your head breaks the surface.
 Frantically, you draw in gasping lungfuls of air.

 After being swept along for some distance, the river's course turns
 suddenly.  You are pushed over a cluster of submerged stones near the
 rocky bank.  The great sword at your side somehow catches between the
 stones, stopping you dead in the raging current.  Fighting against the
 power of the river, you grasp hold of the slippery stones and work
 yourself free.  You scrabble along toward the river's edge and finally
 haul yourself out of the freezing water.  You find yourself in another
 great, subterranean chamber.

 [Your score has increased.]

 Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into
 darkness southward.  The underground river rushes past at the hall's
 northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
 near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  A great
 iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and forms a rusty pile on the
 floor.

 The Oracle
 Beta Version 1.4 by Brandon Allen
 Another fine product from Allen MegaCorp (2000)

>examine waterwheel
 The ancient waterwheel is constructed from oaken beams fastened
 together with thick iron nails.  It is far larger than the waterwheels
 you have seen used to grind grain at home; it is as tall as eight or
 ten men.  The bottom of the wheel dips down into a narrow channel cut
 in the chamber's stone floor.  At the head of the channel is a
 flow-control gate, which is closed, allowing only a trickle of water to
 leak past.  The wheel can rotate on a massive axle fashioned from the
 trunk of an ancient and mighty oak.  The axle extends outward beyond
 the wheel's mounting and some holes have been bored through the tough
 wood there.

>open gate
 You raise the gate along its track and water spills into the sluice,
 filling the waterwheel's scoops.  After a moment, the force of the
 flowing water builds, and with a low, groaning creak, the great wheel
 begins to turn.

>close gate
 You force the gate down into the rushing water, interrupting the flow
 through the sluice.  Once the water ceases flowing, the great wheel
 comes to a stuttering halt.

>attach chain to wheel
 I don't know how to attach the heavy iron chain.

>examine chain
 It is an exceptionally stout piece of ironmongery.  Its heavy links are
 large enough that it would be difficult to wrap both hands around one
 of them.  The chain reaches down from the ceiling, high above, and
 rests in a rusted pile on the floor.

>get chain
 You grasp the chain's free end and heft it, a feat requiring
 considerable strength.

>put it on wheel
 You can't put the heavy iron chain anywhere.

>examine wheel
 The ancient waterwheel is constructed from oaken beams fastened

>put chain in hole
 Which hole do you mean, the large hole, or the small hole?

>large
 You thread the free end of the iron chain into the large hole bored
 through the great axle.

>open gate
 You raise the gate along its track and water spills into the sluice,
 filling the waterwheel's scoops.  After a moment, the force of the
 flowing water builds, and with a low, groaning creak, the great wheel
 begins to turn.  The rotation of the axle allows the iron chain to slip
 out of the large hole and it falls to the floor with a clank.

 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  River water
 flows swiftly through the channel and turns the great wheel.  A great
 iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and forms a rusty pile on the
 floor.

>examine small hole
 The hole is round, approximately two fingerbreadths in width and is
 bored completely through the oaken beam.

>examine beam
 The great waterwheel is rotating on this massive beam of oak.  At one
 end of the axle, where it overhangs the wheel's mounts, two holes have
 been bored through:  a large hole perhaps twice as broad as your hand
 and a smaller hole, drilled perpendicular to the larger one, so that
 the two holes meet at their midpoints.

>put chain in large hole
 You can't do that while the waterwheel is turning.

>close gate
 You force the gate down into the rushing water, interrupting the flow
 through the sluice.  Once the water ceases flowing, the great wheel
 comes to a stuttering halt.

>put chain in large hole
 You thread the free end of the iron chain into the large hole bored
 through the great axle.

>put sword in small hole
 The rusted sword doesn't fit in the smaller hole.

>get chain
 You slide the end of the great chain from the axle's larger hole.

 where you are holding its free end.

>go south
 (Dropping the iron chain.)
 Great Hall, Middle
    You are somewhere near the middle of the great hall.  The giant
 chamber extends onward into darkness toward the north and south.  The
 crashing din of the underground river reverberates off the blank stone
 walls.  The noise sounds as though it is coming from the north.  An
 iron trapdoor has been set in the chamber's floor here.

>open trapdoor
 You pull at the trapdoor, but the ancient screw holds it fast.

>examine trapdoor
 The trapdoor is a rusted plate of iron set in the chamber's floor.  It
 is closed, and held fast by a large screw.

>unscrew screw with sword
 The rusted sword does not engage the screw properly.

>unscrew screw
 The screw is set flush with the trapdoor's surface, and you are unable
 to turn it with your fingers.

>go south
 Great Hall, Southern End
    This is the southern end of the great hall which continues into
 darkness northward.  The rumbling hiss of the underground river echoes
 faintly off the blank stone walls.  A giant, rough-hewn block of stone
 rests against the southern wall.

>examine stone
 It is a huge slab of solid granite, the height of three or four men.
 It appears to be cut from the same stone as that which forms this hall.
 The block is not so well finished, however.  Its surface is rough and
 uneven, bearing deep chisel marks, and cupped pockets where large
 flakes of stone were chipped away.

>examine pocket
 The marks of ancient tools cover this towering stone.  They are often
 deep enough to grasp like handholds.

>climb stone
 You scramble up the block's rough surface and haul yourself onto its
 broad top.

 Great Hall, On Top of Stone
    You are atop the great stone resting against the hall's southern
 wall.  A great iron chain extends down from somewhere above and is
 fastened to a huge iron hasp fixed in the center of the stone's top.
 From this height, the pale light shining from your amulet barely
 illuminates the hall's floor far below you.  A narrow passageway,
 previously hidden from view, has been carved into the southern wall.
 It was clearly an afterthought to the great hall's excavation.  It was
 probably added decades, if not centuries later.  The passage leads
 southward.
    You see a rusted metal rod here.

>get rod
 Taken.

>examine rod
 The rod is about as long as your forearm.  It appears to be hammered
 from iron and its surface is quite rusted and pitted.  One of its ends
 is bent into a small hook.

>go south
 Burial Chamber
    You are in a burial chamber of some kind.  A holy man of antiquity
 has had himself laid to rest near the great oracle's hiding place in
 the heart of the mountain.  The chamber is littered with the crumbling
 remains of the finery he was adorned with at burial.  The air,
 moistened by the flowing river, has destroyed the once opulent treasure
 over the centuries.  A stone sarcophagus, decorated with intricate
 carvings, rests along the eastern wall.  A narrow passageway leads out
 northward.

>examine sarcophagus
 It is carved from white marble, streaked with veins of pink and gray.
 Its lid is intricately carved with mystical symbols and characters,
 none of which are familiar to you.  In the center of the lid, a small
 rectangular notch has been carved.  It appears to be much deeper than
 the other decorations.

>examine notch
 It is a small, rectangular recess cut into the stone lid.

>put rod in notch
 The metal rod will not fit into the notch.

 You raise the gate along its track and water spills into the sluice,

 flowing water builds, and with a low, groaning creak, the great wheel
 begins to turn.  The iron chain is wound, clanking and scraping, onto
 the axle by the waterwheel's rotation.  The chain draws tight and the
 waterwheel's speed slows considerably. The wheel continues to turn
 however, drawing more chain down from some hidden place in the ceiling.
 The great chain is gradually wound around the great oaken axle as
 though it were a giant spool of thread.  A loud, grinding sound echoes
 from the southern end of the hall.  Finally, the chain stops feeding
 down from the ceiling and the wheel creaks to a halt.  The water in the
 sluice splashes noisily past the motionless wheel.

>go south
 As you leave, the unsupported flow-control gate slips shut, cutting off
 the flow of water past the waterwheel.  Once the water ceases flowing,
 the great wheel creaks and shudders to a halt.  The iron chain wrapped
 around the wheel's axle is drawn back up into the ceiling and the wheel
 begins to turn in reverse, splashing water onto the floor and walls.
 Again you hear the grinding sound coming from the southern end of the
 hall.  The distant grinding terminates with a resonating thump and the
 great chain falls slack.  The loops of chain wound around the axle
 tumble noisily onto the floor.

 The gate is a flat sheet of rusted, moss-covered metal mounted in an
 iron track which is set into the riverbank.  The track allows the gate

 waterwheel.  At present, the gate is open, and water rushes through the
 sluice.

>put sword in track
 You are unable to get the rusted sword to fit into the track.  Perhaps
 if you put something under the gate instead...

>put sword under gate
 You plunge the sword down into the flowing water, its point catches
 against the channel's stone bottom.  You tuck the sword's hilt under
 the gate's lower edge. The arrangement holds, keeping the gate fully
 open.

    This is the southern end of the great hall which continues into

 It is a cavity in the rock wall, perhaps the size of a man's fist.  Its

 Silent Hall
    This is a great, empty chamber.  The floor is covered with fine sand
 which muffles the sound of your footsteps.  The sound of your movements

 Hall of the Cherubim
    Along the northern wall of this great hall stand three massive
 bronze cherubim, each at least the height of three men.  Their mighty
 wings are swept forward, covering their respectfully downturned faces.
 The powerful arms of each statue are extended forward:  the first grips
 the axle of a bronze wheel suspended between his clenched fists; the
 second holds a brass censer; the third cups a copper sphere in his
 upturned palms.  The three seem to be bowing deferentially toward an
 ornate archway leading southward.  Another archway leads back to the
 west.  A ceremonial chest sits in the southeastern corner.

>examine cherubim
 The cherubim are giant bronze statues of powerful winged men.  They
 stand against the northern end of the hall.  The first grips the axle
 of a bronze wheel suspended between his clenched fists, the second
 holds a brass censer, the third cups a copper sphere in his upturned
 palms.

>examine sphere
 The sphere is made from polished copper.  Its surface is etched with
 mystical symbols.  You recognize them as constellations that can be
 seen in the night sky.  A small bronze arrow, an indicator of some
 sort, points toward one of the constellations on the sphere's surface.
 It points to the greater bruin.

>examine chest
 It is a large wooden chest overlaid with lustrous gold leaf.  Twinkling
 gemstones are set in each corner of its heavy lid.  It is apparent that
 this chest contained items of sacral nature, used in ceremonial rites.
 Three interlocking circles adorn its front and a shiny brass chime is
 suspended from one of its ends.

>examine censer
 The censer is a large brass jar with ornate fenestrations cut in its
 sides to allow the smoke of ritual incense to escape.  It appears as
 though it has not been used for centuries.  The censer's lid is closed.

>hit chime
 The chime rings out with a low, throaty tone that reverberates through
 the chamber.

 Incredibly, fine lines seem to etch themselves into the chest's smooth
 top.  The lines join to form a rectangle which includes almost all of
 the chest's lid.  The wood within the rectangle suddenly vanishes and
 you can see the chest's interior.  You see that the chest contains a
 ceremonial sceptre and a block of incense.

 As quickly as it happened, the chest's lid reconstitutes itself, and
 all is exactly as it was before.

>stand on chest

 You feel the chest's lid vaporize beneath you and with a jarring thump,
 you fall within.

 Inside Chest
    You find yourself curled up uncomfortably within the ceremonial
 chest.  Its interior is lined with deep red cedar whose odor you can
 still barely detect, despite its great antiquity.  From within, you can
 see that the chest is held shut with a sturdy latch.
    You see a ceremonial sceptre and a block of incense here.

>get all
 ceremonial sceptre:  Taken.
 block of incense:  Taken.

>open latch
 I don't know how to open the latch.

>examine latch
 It is a large mechanism, enclosed within a brass cowl.  A stout bolt
 extends down from the cowl and locks under a heavy loop of iron mounted
 to the chest's bottom.  You realize that it would be impossible to open
 this chest from the outside.  On the back of the cowling, a raised
 metal stud protrudes conspicuously.

>push stud
 The stud sinks smoothly into the cowl as you press it.  You hear a
 faint click and the latch mechanism springs suddenly to life.  Whirring
 merrily, the bolt is drawn up beneath the cowl.  The latch clacks and
 rattles a few times, then another bolt extends from the cowl's upper
 surface and pushes the chest's lid open.  The lid raises smoothly until
 it is fully opened.  Seeing your chance for freedom, you climb out.
 The lid silently swings closed behind you.  You hear faint whirring and
 clicking noises coming from inside the chest for a moment, then all is
 quiet once more.

 Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into

 northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
 near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  River water
 flows swiftly through the channel and splashes noisily past the
 stationary wheel.  A great iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and
 is wound tightly around the wheel's great axle.

 the great wheel creaks and shudders to a halt.  The iron chain wrapped
 around the wheel's axle is drawn back up into the ceiling and the wheel
 begins to turn in reverse, splashing water onto the floor and walls.
 Again you hear the grinding sound coming from the southern end of the
 hall.  The distant grinding terminates with a resonating thump and the
 great chain falls slack.  The loops of chain wound around the axle
 tumble noisily onto the floor.

 From this height, the pale light shining from your amulet barely
 illuminates the hall's floor far below you.  A narrow passageway,

 Burial Chamber
    You are in a burial chamber of some kind.  A holy man of antiquity
 has had himself laid to rest near the great oracle's hiding place in
 the heart of the mountain.  The chamber is littered with the crumbling
 remains of the finery he was adorned with at burial.  The air,
 moistened by the flowing river, has destroyed the once opulent treasure
 over the centuries.  A stone sarcophagus, decorated with intricate
 carvings, rests along the eastern wall.  A narrow passageway leads out
 northward.

>put stone in notch
 The smooth, blue stone slips easily into the notch.  You hear a muffled
 clacking sound somewhere within the sarcophagus.

>open sarcophagus
 The stone lid raises easily, revealing the disintigrated remains of the
 sarcophagus' occupant.  The desiccated corpse is draped with yellowed
 linen sheets that crumble like burned paper.  Resting in the general
 region of the neck is a heavy gold torque.

>enter river
 You leap into the raging river's churning waters and are swept away by
 the powerful current.  Just downstream from the great hall, a small
 grotto has formed where the river has eroded away the solid stone.  You
 make a futile attempt to swim toward the grotto, but the current is far
 too swift.  Your battle to keep your head above the churning surface
 ends suddenly when you strike your skull sharply against a submerged
 rock, and all becomes black...

 You awaken suddenly, your head hammering with pain.  You have no idea
 where you are, but you are no longer buffetted by the icy river and
 your clothing is dry. You have no clear recollection of how you arrived
 in this place, but you seem to remember a sudden flash of daylight...
 an arm reaching down, plucking you out of the water, dragging you back
 into darkness...  a grim, bearded face looking down upon you -
 unmoving...  tunnels, passages, twisting, turning, climbing...

 Stone Altar
    This space was hollowed out of the solid stone of the mountain,
 chisel-marks from the ancient laborers can still be seen on its rough
 hewn walls.  The room is slightly oval shaped with a squat, stone altar

 corroded after centuries of neglect, hangs from a stand mounted at one

 just in front of the altar.

 An open archway exits eastward.
    Sitting on the stone altar is a rusted sword.

 Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into
 darkness southward.  The underground river rushes past at the hall's
 northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
 near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  A great
 iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and attatches to the
 waterwheel's axle.

>get chain
 Which chain do you mean, the tiny, brass chain, or the heavy iron
 chain?

>put iron chain in large hole
 The great chain has been threaded through the large hole and completely
 occludes it.

>put rod in hole
 Which hole do you mean, the large hole, or the small hole?

>small
 The metal rod has already been inserted into the small hole, occluding
 it completely.

>open gate
 You raise the gate along its track and water spills into the sluice,
 filling the waterwheel's scoops.  After a moment, the force of the
 flowing water builds, and with a low, groaning creak, the great wheel
 begins to turn.  The iron chain is wound, clanking and scraping, onto
 the axle by the waterwheel's rotation.  The chain draws tight and the
 waterwheel's speed slows considerably. The wheel continues to turn
 however, drawing more chain down from some hidden place in the ceiling.
 The great chain is gradually wound around the great oaken axle as
 though it were a giant spool of thread.  A loud, grinding sound echoes
 from the southern end of the hall.  Finally, the chain stops feeding
 down from the ceiling and the wheel creaks to a halt.  The water in the
 sluice splashes noisily past the motionless wheel.

>put sword under gate
 You plunge the sword down into the flowing water, its point catches
 against the channel's stone bottom.  You tuck the sword's hilt under
 the gate's lower edge. The arrangement holds, keeping the gate fully
 open.

>go south
 Great Hall, Middle
    You are somewhere near the middle of the great hall.  The giant
 chamber extends onward into darkness toward the north and south.  The
 crashing din of the underground river reverberates off the blank stone
 walls.  The noise sounds as though it is coming from the north.  An
 iron trapdoor has been set in the chamber's floor here.

>go south
 Great Hall, Southern End
    This is the southern end of the great hall which continues into
 darkness northward.  The rumbling hiss of the underground river echoes
 faintly off the blank stone walls.  A huge block of granite is
 suspended near the ceiling directly above an open doorway which leads
 southward.  Immediately in front of the doorway, a rectangular patch of
 the stone floor is dark with moisture.

>go south
 Spiral Staircase, Top
    This is the upper landing of a great spiral staircase that winds its
 way downward into darkness.  Its broad steps have been chopped from the
 living rock.  An open archway leads northward.

>go down
 Spiral Staircase, Middle
    You are somewhere near the middle of the great spiral staircase deep
 under the mountain.  A small hole has been bored into the wall here.
 The steps wind their way upward and downward.

>go down
 Spiral Staircase, Bottom
    This is the lower landing of the great spiral staircase which twists
 upward into darkness.  An open archway leads eastward.

>go east
 Silent Hall
    This is a great, empty chamber.  The floor is covered with fine sand
 which muffles the sound of your footsteps.  The sound of your movements
 no longer echoes off the stone walls as it has previously, giving this
 area an almost solemn nuance.  Open archways exit to the east and west.

>go east
 Silent Chamber
    This small chamber is floored with clean, soft sand.  An open

>go east
 Hall of the Cherubim
    Along the northern wall of this great hall stand three massive
 bronze cherubim, each at least the height of three men.  Their mighty
 wings are swept forward, covering their respectfully downturned faces.
 The powerful arms of each statue are extended forward:  the first grips
 the axle of a bronze wheel suspended between his clenched fists; the
 second holds a brass censer; the third cups a copper sphere in his
 upturned palms.  The three seem to be bowing deferentially toward an
 ornate archway leading southward.  Another archway leads back to the
 west.  A ceremonial chest sits in the southeastern corner.
    The brass censer seems to contain a block of incense.

>tickle cherub
 I don't know the word "tickle".

>SAVE
>cf4
 Saved.

>examine tinderbox
 It is an open-topped box made of tarnished brass, little enough to fit
 easily in one hand.  A small, soot-stained cup is situated at its
 bottom, beneath a chip of stone mounted on the box's upper edge.
 Dangling from a delicate brass chain is a small square of metal.  The
 box's base encloses a tiny drawer which is closed.

>open drawer
 Opening the tiny drawer reveals a wad of floss.

>get floss
 As you tear a pinch of the floss away, the tiny drawer snaps firmly
 shut.

>put floss in cup
 Done.

>examine chip
 I don't know the word "chip".

>examine stone
 The gray stone is mounted to the box's upper edge.  It has been chipped
 into a rectangular shape, and appears to be flint.

>examine metal
 It is made from what appears to be steel, judging from the rust that
 covers it. Its edges have been scraped and nicked.

>chirp
 I don't know the word "chirp".

>hit flint with metal
 You strike the stone firmly with the square of metal, a shower of
 sparks flashes down upon the cup.  The wad of floss within the cup
 begins to smoulder and emit a thin wisp of smoke, then a tiny finger of
 orange flame leaps up from the burning floss.

 [Your score has increased.]

>light incense
 You'll have to open the brass censer first.

>open censer
 The censer's lid swings open.

 A tiny, orange lick of flame flickers up from within the tinderbox.

>light incense
 The incense begins to glow with heat, and a bit of delicious-smelling
 smoke slithers up from it.  The sweet smoke begins to roll lazily out
 of the censer's fenestrations and wafts up toward the ceiling.  You
 hear a distant click coming from somewhere behind the wheel-bearing
 cherub.

 A tiny, orange lick of flame flickers up from within the tinderbox.

>turn wheel
 You turn the great wheel, it spins easily.  As it spins, you notice a
 scraping sound coming from beyond the southern archway.  After a few
 rotations, the wheel comes to a sudden halt.  You hear a muffled clack
 coming from somewhere behind the sphere-bearing cherub.

 Having entirely consumed the wad of floss, the tiny flame leaping up
 from the tinderbox winks out suddenly, and sends up a fine wisp of
 smoke.

>turn sphere
 The sphere rolls smoothly in the cherub's cupped hands.  As it turns, a
 metallic creaking echoes from the chamber southward.  The sphere clicks
 suddenly to a solid stop.  The arrow now points toward a different
 constellation:  the hydra.

>go south
 The Well
    The walls of this chamber are black, as if coated with thick soot.
 A faint haze of scented smoke billows in through the archway, filling
 the chamber with a sweet odor.  A polished, copper mirror, easily as
 tall as yourself, stands atop a massive stone dais near the center of
 the room.  The dais seems to have slid further back into the chamber,
 revealing a large, open well where the massive stone structure had
 been.  Stylized diagrams of what appear to be constellations have been
 carved into the chamber's floor and walls.  They form a line extending
 from the center of the well's northern edge, across the floor, and up
 to the top of the chamber's northern wall.  The mirror is mounted at
 its middle so that its reflective surface can tilt forward or back.
 Presently, the mirror is angled toward the hydra etched on the northern
 wall, just above eye level.

>examine diagrams
 I don't know the word "diagrams".

>examine hydra
 I don't know the word "hydra".

>examine well
 It is a large, round hole cut in the chamber's floor.  A border of
 mystic runes ring its edge.  Its yawning, black depths open before you.

>examine runes

>go down
 You can't go that way.

>enter hole
 I don't know how to enter the well.

>examine amulet
 It is the golden amulet the council of elders gave you as you set out
 on your journey.  It is quite finely made, probably well beyond the
 skills of the smithies of your land, it must have come from some
 far-off place.

>look in well
 The well is far deeper than the light from your amulet will penetrate,
 and you see only blackness.

>examine i
 I don't understand that sentence.

>examine me
 You are tall for your seventeen years, despite your meager existence on
 the farm.  The tattered clothes of a peasant adorn your lanky frame.
 About your neck hangs a brilliantly crafted golden amulet.

>examine amulet
 It is the golden amulet the council of elders gave you as you set out

>drop amulet in well
 The amulet falls into the depths of the well, illuminating its stone
 sides as it plummets downward.  Eventually, the amulet's glow dwindles
 to a tiny pinpoint and finally, it winks out entirely.  You find
 yourself in total darkness.

 The blackness seems to close in upon you, choking the breath from your
 lungs.  Your heart hammers wildly in your chest.  The fear of dying,
 cold and alone deep in the bowels of the earth, suddenly grips you and
 holds you in its icy claws.

 An intensely bright beam of brilliant, white light suddenly blasts
 upward from within the well, and reflects off the mirror's polished
 surface.  The reflected beam of light illuminates the diagram of the
 hydra etched on the northern wall, just above eye level.  The beam
 rests there for a moment then disappears, leaving you again in total
 darkness.

 The sphere is made from polished copper.  Its surface is etched with

>go north
 Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into
 darkness southward.  The underground river rushes past at the hall's
 northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
 near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  River water
 flows swiftly through the channel and splashes noisily past the
 stationary wheel.  A great iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and
 is wound tightly around the wheel's great axle.

>get sword
 Taken.

>enter river
 As you leave, the unsupported flow-control gate slips shut, cutting off
 the flow of water past the waterwheel.  Once the water ceases flowing,
 the great wheel creaks and shudders to a halt.  The iron chain wrapped
 around the wheel's axle is drawn back up into the ceiling and the wheel
 begins to turn in reverse, splashing water onto the floor and walls.
 Again you hear the grinding sound coming from the southern end of the
 hall.  The distant grinding terminates with a resonating thump and the
 great chain falls slack.  The loops of chain wound around the axle
 tumble noisily onto the floor.

 You leap into the raging river's churning waters and are swept away by
 the powerful current.  Just downstream from the great hall, a small
 grotto has formed where the river has eroded away the solid stone.  You
 make a futile attempt to swim toward the grotto, but the current is far
 too swift.  Your battle to keep your head above the churning surface
 ends suddenly when you strike your skull sharply against a submerged
 rock, and all becomes black...

 You awaken suddenly, your head hammering with pain.  You have no idea
 where you are, but you are no longer buffetted by the icy river and
 your clothing is dry. You have no clear recollection of how you arrived
 in this place, but you seem to remember a sudden flash of daylight...
 an arm reaching down, plucking you out of the water, dragging you back
 into darkness...  a grim, bearded face looking down upon you -
 unmoving...  tunnels, passages, twisting, turning, climbing...

 Stone Altar
    This space was hollowed out of the solid stone of the mountain,
 chisel-marks from the ancient laborers can still be seen on its rough
 hewn walls.  The room is slightly oval shaped with a squat, stone altar
 set on the floor at its southernmost end.  A metal chime, heavily
 corroded after centuries of neglect, hangs from a stand mounted at one
 of its ends.  A rivulet of clear water splashes into the room through a
 doorway that enters from the north.  The stream flows placidly down the
 room's length and disappears through an iron grate set in the floor
 just in front of the altar.

 An open archway exits eastward.
    Sitting on the stone altar is a rusted sword.

 Landing
    This is the landing of a narrow flight of stairs climbing sharply

 the walls, evidence of the great antiquity of this place.  An open
 archway leads westward.

>go north
 On The Stairs, Rubble
    The stairs climb for a short distance, terminating abruptly where a
 jumble of boulders has collapsed into the narrow stairway, sealing it
 off completely.

>examine boulders
 The boulders are the same mottled granite that forms the entire
 mountain.  As you look more closely, you notice that rather than having
 fallen randomly into the stairway, the stones have been carefully laid
 in place.

>move boulders
 You push at the boulders with all your strength.  Eventually, you
 succeed in dislodging one of them perhaps a fingerwidth.  The entire
 pile creaks and grinds as if it were barely stable under its own
 tremendous weight.

>move boulders
 You grasp one of the great stones and begin to wriggle it from its
 place.

 With a sound like a clap of thunder, the wall of stones topples down,
 crushing you to death instantly.

 As you pass through the archway, a sudden rush of cold wind brushes
 past from behind you.  You feel the stone beneath your feet tremble as
 a deafening roar blasts from the stairway as if the entire mountain
 were collapsing upon itself. In an instant you realize what is
 happening, The wall of boulders...

 You are barely able to leap clear as an avalanche of stone pours down
 the stairway.  The thunderous noise subsides after a moment and a thick
 cloud of choking dust rolls out through the archway.

    This space was hollowed out of the solid stone of the mountain,
 chisel-marks from the ancient laborers can still be seen on its rough
 hewn walls.  The room is slightly oval shaped with a squat, stone altar
 set on the floor at its southernmost end.  A metal chime, heavily
 corroded after centuries of neglect, hangs from a stand mounted at one
 of its ends.  A rivulet of clear water splashes into the room through a
 doorway that enters from the north.  The stream flows placidly down the
 room's length and disappears through an iron grate set in the floor
 just in front of the altar.

 An open archway exits eastward.

 A recent rockslide has entirely covered the stairs in stony rubble.
 Amazingly, the stairway is still passable, though it appears difficult
 going.

 On The Stairs, Rubble
    The stairs are littered with great boulders, but a passable opening

 Small Chamber
    This is a low chamber that must have served as some sort of
 preparation room for supplicants who came seeking audience with the
 oracle - a place to wash, and don ceremonial robes before attempting to
 summon her.  The worm-eaten remains of a small wooden table litter the
 floor along the northern wall.  An ancient washbasin is mounted in the
 north-eastern corner.

 The narrow stairway leads downward.

 Incredibly, fine lines seem to etch themselves into the altar's smooth
 top.  The lines join to form a rectangle which includes almost all of
 the altar's upper surface.  The stone within the rectangle suddenly
 vanishes revealing a wide chimney leading down, directly through the
 altar, into darkness.

 You feel the stone vaporize beneath you followed by the terrifying,
 sickening sensation of falling.  Blackness surrounds you, and you
 continue to fall.

 With a crash that sounds like a clap of thunder, you plunge into a
 frigid, underground lake.  You are stung with icy cold as the water
 quickly soaks your clothing.  You break the surface gasping and
 sputtering, fighting to keep your breath.

 southward.

>go south
 You haul yourself out of the frigid water into the alcove.  You shiver
 violently in the cold, damp air, rubbing your numb hands over your
 aching, near-frozen limbs.  Gradually you notice that the amulet is
 glowing brighter than it did before.  It seems to be growing warmer as
 well.  Soon the amulet has filled the entire alcove with a pleasant
 warmth, and sensation creeps slowly back into your body.  The heat then
 dwindles, and the amulet's glow returns to its previous glimmer.

 You swim upward, breaking the surface and gasping for air.

 Flooded Chamber, Surface of Water
    You are on the open lake.  Dark water surrounds you on all sides.

>go down
 You draw in a deep breath and dive below the surface of the ice-cold

 Flooded Chamber, Underwater
    You are in open water.  Darkness envelops you completely, making the
 biting chill of the water seem even more pronounced.  Beneath you in
 the darkness, you notice a tiny, winking flash of light.  It is there
 for a moment then disappears.

>go down
 You swim deeper into the depths of the ice-cold water.

 Flooded Chamber, Deep Underwater
    On the pool's sandy floor a large mound of decaying debris has
 collected.  There are objects of all descriptions piled here as though
 they had been poured down from above.  The scarce bits of untarnished
 metal and unbroken glass among the refuse flash and wink at you,
 reflecting the amulet's pale glow.
    Atop the mound you see a ruby.

 The icy water has drawn away so much of your body's heat that you are
 almost unable to move.  You know that you must get out of the water
 soon.

 Flooded Chamber, Surface of Water
    You are near the chamber's southern wall.  A small recess has been
 carved out of the damp stone, just above the water line.  The recess
 appears to form a dry refuge from the icy water.  It lies directly
 southward.

>go south
 You haul yourself out of the frigid water into the alcove.  You stand,
 shivering violently for some time.  Again the amulet glows with
 pleasant heat and you are eventually warmed.

 Beside Pool
    This is a small, dry alcove beside the great, dark pool of water.
 The light from your amulet is reflected off of the black surface of the
 water in small flickers as tiny waves lap against the chamber's walls.

>examine ruby
 It is a large gemstone of deep blood red.  Its facets shimmer and flash
 as you look upon it.

 In a total of 426 turns, you have achieved a score of 55 points out of

>go north
 You jump back into the icy water with an echoing splash.

 Flooded Chamber, Surface of Water
    You are treading water in a large chamber that has been almost
 completely flooded by a waterfall that crashes down from somewhere high
 above you in the darkness.

 You are near the chamber's southern wall.  A small recess has been
 carved out of the damp stone, just above the water line.  The recess
 appears to form a dry refuge from the icy water.  It lies directly
 southward.

>go east
 You swim eastward.

 Flooded Chamber, Surface of Water
    You are in the southeastern corner of the chamber.  Small waves lap
 against the dark stone walls.

>go north
 You swim northward.

 Flooded Chamber, Surface of Water
    You are near the chamber's eastern wall.  The damp stone continues
 into darkness toward the north and south.  The icy water seems to be
 flowing gently northward.

>go down
 You draw in a deep breath and dive below the surface of the ice-cold
 water.

 Flooded Chamber, Underwater
    You are near the chamber's eastern wall.  The remains of a large
 mural adorn the otherwise blank stone.  Once brilliant paint and
 plaster is slowly being washed away, but the image remains discernible.
 It depicts the legend of your people which tells of the great wizard
 who came from his shining city among the stars.  The wizard brought
 knowledge and magic to your people.  The mural shows the mighty
 sorcerer descending from the sky bearing a book of learning and a
 magical sceptre.

 The water is incredibly cold, you can feel your arms and legs growing
 numb.

>go north
 You swim northward.

 Flooded Chamber, Underwater
    You are near the chamber's eastern wall.  The stone wall continues
 to the north and south.  A submerged passageway opens toward the east.
 You notice a gentle current flowing past you into the dark opening.

>go east
 You swim eastward into the dark passageway.  The force of the current
 grows stronger and stronger until it sweeps you helplessly along.  In
 the darkness you scrape against the uneven stone walls and are pounded
 mercilessly into submerged boulders.  Your lungs burn with the desire
 for breath, but the cold water refuses to release you from its icy
 grip.  Consciousness begins to slip away from you.  The roaring, black
 water and jagged stones are fading into warm, gray oblivion...

 You are slammed back into wakefulness when your body is hurled over the
 precipice of a subterranean waterfall and spilled into an underground
 river flowing swiftly beneath the great mountain.  The river's dark
 channel is not completely submerged, and your head breaks the surface.
 Frantically, you draw in gasping lungfuls of air.

 After being swept along for some distance, the river's course turns
 suddenly.  You are pushed over a cluster of submerged stones near the
 rocky bank.  The great sword at your side somehow catches between the
 stones, stopping you dead in the raging current.  Fighting against the
 power of the river, you grasp hold of the slippery stones and work
 yourself free.  You scrabble along toward the river's edge and finally
 haul yourself out of the freezing water.  You find yourself in another
 great, subterranean chamber.

 Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into
 darkness southward.  The underground river rushes past at the hall's
 northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
 near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  A great
 iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and attatches to the
 waterwheel's axle.

>go south
 Great Hall, Middle
    You are somewhere near the middle of the great hall.  The giant
 chamber extends onward into darkness toward the north and south.  The
 crashing din of the underground river reverberates off the blank stone
 walls.  The noise sounds as though it is coming from the north.  An
 iron trapdoor has been set in the chamber's floor here.

>unscrew screw with coin
 The screw turns, squeaking dryly, through a few rotations then snaps in
 two.  Its upper half clatters across the iron door.

>get screw
 Taken.

>inventory
 You have a golden amulet (being worn), a ceremonial sceptre, a brass
 tinderbox, a gold torque (being worn), a rusted sword, a gold coin, a
 ruby, and a broken iron screw.

>examine broken
 I don't know the word "broken".

>examine screw
 It is the rusty, upper half of a large iron screw.  It appears that its
 ancient has metal twisted in two.

>open trapdoor
 You swing the trapdoor open on its squealing hinges, and let it fall
 onto the stone floor with a loud clang.  Beneath the door a dark
 passage leads downward.

>go down
 Barrow
    This is a small hollow carved into the great chamber's floor.  The
 stone of its walls is rough and unfinished.  An opening in the roof
 leads upward, and a tiny tunnel extends away from the barrow eastward.

>go east
 Narrow Tunnel
    You are crawling on hands and knees through a tiny fault piercing
 the great mountain.  The tunnel extends away from you eastward and
 westward.

>go east
 Narrow Tunnel
    Icy-cold water oozes from the tunnel's solid stone walls here.
 Frigid rivulets run down your back as you disturb heavy droplets that
 form along the low roof.  The tunnel extends eastward and westward.

>go east
 Narrow Tunnel
    The cramped tunnel continues on eastward and westward.  A faint
 breeze brushes past you, cool and fresh.  It seems to be blowing from
 the east.

>go east
 You crawl further eastward along the tunnel.  Suddenly, you are blinded
 for a moment by a brilliant flash of light far down the tunnel, ahead
 of you.  It is there for a moment, then gone again.  You crane forward,
 trying to pierce the tunnel's black depths with your eyes...  but you
 see nothing.  After a moment you continue on, and there it is again!
 But rather than a tiny flash, a glowing beam of light shines down the
 tunnel toward you.  You shade your eyes with your hands, squinting
 against the stinging brightness.

 As your eyes grow accustomed to the light, you realize that what you
 are seeing is sunlight!  You force yourself quickly forward, eager to
 breathe the air above ground again.

 Balcony
    You stand on a narrow balcony carved into a dizzyingly high wall of
 rock.  Just below you, the great river, having coursed through the
 mountain's darkest depths, spills jubilantly over the cliff's edge with
 a parting hiss, and plunges into the great valley far below.  An
 incredible landscape sprawls out before you.  Thick forests stretch
 away into the distance, carpeting rolling hills that climb gradually
 toward another range of mighty peaks which you can just make out,
 purple-gray in the mid-day haze.  The river, having finally tumbled
 down from its great height, bends southward, winds its way into the
 dense trees and disappears.

 A life-size statue of an armed watchman sits pensively at the far right
 end of the balcony.  The dreary blackness of the tunnel's dark opening
 leads back into the mountain, westward.

>examine river
 The river, flowing dark an cold from the depths of the great mountain,
 pours over the cliff casting up a fine mist as it departs; a parting
 token of joy at once again seeing the light of the sun and the deep
 blue of the sky.  In the valley far below flashes and sparkles gaily as
 it splashes its way toward the vast forest.  Here and there between the
 mighty trees you catch a twinkle of light reflected from its surface.

>examine forest
 The vast forest, deep and dark, creeps eagerly over the cascading hills
 that tumble down from the distant mountains.  A standing mist hangs
 sluggishly among its lofty boughs, giving the mighty branches a
 shifting, almost lifelike appearance.

>examine sky
 I don't see any sky here.

>examine mist
 I don't know the word "mist".

>examine statue
 The stone watchman sits upon a low shelf of rock, his unmoving gaze
 directed forever at the river as it disappears over the cliff's edge.
 The statue is incredibly lifelike, to the least details of his long
 beard and tattered coat of mail.  It looks almost as tough an ancient
 warrior sat himself upon this stony seat ages ago, and remained there
 until he became part of the great mountain himself.  A tall lance
 stands ready at his side.

>examine lance
 The watchman's stone spear is tall and straight, with a long, sharp
 head.  His thick fingers seem to grip its shaft tightly.

>get lance
 You reach across the watchman's broad chest to take the lance from his
 stony hand.

 Quick as a flash his free left hand snaps upward toward your throat,
 seizing the golden amulet about your neck.  You scarcely dare breathe
 as his stone eyes scrape slowly downward to study it carefully.  After
 a long moment he releases you from his grip.
    "At last, you've come," he says, his voice slow and deliberate, as
 though speaking is a talent he seldom uses.  The words grate from his
 expressionless lips with the sound of millstones grinding against one
 another.

    "A hundred, hundred moons have waxed and waned since last I had
 company on my watch.  Welcome you are, friend."  His eyes roll slowly
 back toward the river and he resumes his silent vigil.

>ask watchman about river
    "The great river," says the watchman, raising his hand in a stiff
 gesture toward the flowing water, "flows freely from this sacred
 mountain into the eastern lands."  He pauses, "I keep my watch here,
 and bid her farewell as she departs on her journey."

>ask watchman about oracle
    "She is wise," the watchman says softly, his voice seeming somehow
 more human.  "She has hidden within this mountain since the dawning of
 the world."  His tone grows distinctly sad, "But the sun of Her time is
 low on the horizon, and soon she will pass from this world."
    " Your arrival," he says, his stone eyes boring into you, "is the
 last of the prophecies.  Her time is close at hand."

>ask man about amulet
 I don't know the word "man".

>ask watchman about amulet
    "Ancient and powerful it is," he replies, "Forged when the world was
 new.  Keep it well."

>ask watchman about wizard
 I don't know the word "wizard".

>ask watchman about torque
    The watchman is silent for a long time, then he rocks slightly on
 his stony perch as though he were laughing to himself.

>ask watchman about watchman
 The watchman's stony face seems to attempt a slight frown,
    "I know not," he says.

>ask watchman about himself
 I don't know the word "himself".

>ask watchman about lance
 The watchman continues his vigil in silence.

>ask watchman about waterwheel
    "The great wheel," croaks the watchman, his voice trailing away as
 though he were deep in thought.

    "The great wheel," he says at last, "raises the stone.  It opens the
 passage leading down to Her chambers."

>ask watchman about bruin
 I don't know the word "bruin".

>ask watchman about constellation
 I don't know the word "constellation".

>ask watchman about ruby
    "I can recall no ruby," replies the watchman.

>ask watchman about sceptre
    "Ah, yes,"he says slowly.  "The sceptre of the claw.  Helpful it is,
 for grasping the unreachable."

>ask watchman about sarcophagus
    "Axaktor he was," says the watchman, he raises his eyebrows and nods
 his head as though remembering an old friend, "a great wizard he was.
 A great wizard he is still!"

 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  A great
 iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and attatches to the
 waterwheel's axle.

>lift gate
 You raise the gate along its track and water spills into the sluice,
 filling the waterwheel's scoops.  After a moment, the force of the
 flowing water builds, and with a low, groaning creak, the great wheel
 begins to turn.  The iron chain is wound, clanking and scraping, onto
 the axle by the waterwheel's rotation.  The chain draws tight and the
 waterwheel's speed slows considerably. The wheel continues to turn
 however, drawing more chain down from some hidden place in the ceiling.
 The great chain is gradually wound around the great oaken axle as
 though it were a giant spool of thread.  A loud, grinding sound echoes
 from the southern end of the hall.  Finally, the chain stops feeding
 down from the ceiling and the wheel creaks to a halt.  The water in the
 sluice splashes noisily past the motionless wheel.

>put sword under gate
 You plunge the sword down into the flowing water, its point catches
 against the channel's stone bottom.  You tuck the sword's hilt under
 the gate's lower edge. The arrangement holds, keeping the gate fully
 open.

 the stone floor is dark with moisture.

 Hall of the Cherubim
    Along the northern wall of this great hall stand three massive
 bronze cherubim, each at least the height of three men.  Their mighty
 wings are swept forward, covering their respectfully downturned faces.
 The powerful arms of each statue are extended forward:  the first grips
 the axle of a bronze wheel suspended between his clenched fists; the
 second holds a brass censer from which pungent, sweet-smelling smoke
 escapes, filling the chamber with an aromatic, bluish haze; the third
 cups a copper sphere in his upturned palms.  The three seem to be
 bowing deferentially toward an ornate archway leading southward.
 Another archway leads back to the west.  A ceremonial chest sits in the
 southeastern corner.
    The brass censer seems to contain a burning block of incense.

>turn sphere

 turn in reverse, splashing water onto the floor and walls.  Again you
 hear the grinding sound coming from the southern end of the hall.  The
 distant grinding terminates with a resonating thump and the great chain
 falls slack.  The loops of chain wound around the axle tumble noisily
 onto the floor.

 The sphere is made from polished copper.  Its surface is etched with
 mystical symbols.  You recognize them as constellations that can be
 seen in the night sky.  A small bronze arrow, an indicator of some
 sort, points toward one of the constellations on the sphere's surface.
 It points to the lesser bruin.

>go south
 The Well
    The walls of this chamber are black, as if coated with thick soot.
 A faint haze of scented smoke billows in through the archway, filling
 the chamber with a sweet odor.  A polished, copper mirror, easily as
 tall as yourself, stands atop a massive stone dais near the center of
 the room.  The dais seems to have slid further back into the chamber,
 revealing a large, open well where the massive stone structure had
 been.  Stylized diagrams of what appear to be constellations have been
 carved into the chamber's floor and walls.  They form a line extending
 from the center of the well's northern edge, across the floor, and up
 to the top of the chamber's northern wall.  The mirror is mounted at
 its middle so that its reflective surface can tilt forward or back.
 Presently, the mirror is angled toward the lesser bruin etched on the
 floor, midway between the well and the northern wall.

>put amulet in hole
 The amulet falls into the depths of the well, illuminating its stone
 sides as it plummets downward.  Eventually, the amulet's glow dwindles
 to a tiny pinpoint and finally, it winks out entirely.  You find
 yourself in total darkness.

 The blackness seems to close in upon you, choking the breath from your
 lungs.  Your heart hammers wildly in your chest.  The fear of dying,
 cold and alone deep in the bowels of the earth, suddenly grips you and
 holds you in its icy claws.

 An intensely bright beam of brilliant, white light suddenly blasts
 upward from within the well, and reflects off the mirror's polished
 surface.  The reflected beam of light illuminates the diagram of the
 lesser bruin etched on the floor, midway between the well and the
 northern wall.

 The blinding light slowly begins to change.  It becomes a softer, blue
 color, streaked here and there with rays of gold and red.  The beam of
 light illuminates the haze of sweet-smelling smoke that has drifted
 into the chamber from the north.  The billowing smoke seems to gather
 in upon itself, as though it were attracted to the beautiful light by
 some unseen force.  The smoke begins to swirl and churn within the beam
 of light, casting weird, sinuous shadows about the room.  It coalesces
 further into a tiny thunderstorm of brilliant color and flashing light.

 You notice a low, humming sound that fills the chamber, echoing wildly
 off the dark stone walls.  The humming becomes a loud whirring as the
 iridescent colors flash faster and faster.  The whirring increases to a
 near deafening roar.  The cloud of smoke thrums and pulses with
 blinding bursts of intensely colored light.  You clap your hands over
 your ears, attempting vainly to shut out the thunderous din, but it is
 of no use.  The tumult of sound and explosion of light seem ready to
 rend the very stone walls with their fury.

 With an incredibly powerful thump that vibrates you to the bone, all
 falls silent and the maelstrom of light calms to a steady glow.  Within
 the cloud of smoke, a beautiful, feminine face appears.  You draw in a
 sharp breath as you finally behold the oracle.

 It is a face of delicate beauty and timeless wisdom.  It is a face that
 has seen the birth of the world, and bears the weighty knowledge of the
 hour of its death.  The oracle regards you contemplatively for a
 moment.

    "You have travelled far to see me," her silken voice rolls forth
 like a wave crashing on some distant shore.  It is a voice of wonder,
 of horror.  It is the voice of dreams fulfilled.

    "I have watched the plight of your people, I know the great peril
 that lies before them..."  Her voice trails away like the falling of
 autumn leaves.

    "I have not the power to deliver your people from this plight."  She
 says with an expression of pensive sorrow.  "A new age is opening in
 the world, and the age past must fade away; along with it, my power in
 the world fades as well.  Already, you have seen the signs of this
 changing.  Mankind no longer seeks out the wisdom of the great ones.
 He has learned for himself the secrets of magic and science.  Flames at
 the altars to the gods burn no longer.  The gifts which the immortals
 once bestowed upon man, he will now obtain for himself.  Our time has
 come to a close."

 A wooden staff appears on the floor before the oracle.  "Take this,"
 she says softly, her voice beginning to fade, "I cannot deliver your
 homeland, but with this gift you can set yourselves free."

 The wondrous face hangs in the air for a long moment, the features
 growing less distinct as the cloud of smoke gradually diffuses.  The
 beam of light dwindles away and finally disappears completely.

 With a lumbering, scraping sound a doorway opens in the southern wall
 and a flood of sunlight pours into the chamber.

>get staff
 Taken.

>examine staff
 The staff is as tall as yourself with a sturdy grip at its center.  It
 tapers gracefully to a point at both ends, and both ends are notched to
 receive the sinew string which hangs loosely from one of them.  It is a
 bow, but a bow unlike any you have ever seen before.  Its thick limbs
 are far stronger than the bows your people have used for ages to hunt
 with.  This bow could easily hurl an arrow over incredible distances
 and pierce even the most impenetrable of armor.  As you contemplate the
 oracle's gift, it becomes clear that this bow is indeed the answer that
 you seek.

>look
 The Well
    The walls of this chamber are black, as if coated with thick soot.
 A faint haze of scented smoke billows in through the archway, filling
 the chamber with a sweet odor.  A polished, copper mirror, easily as
 tall as yourself, stands atop a massive stone dais near the center of
 the room.  The dais seems to have slid further back into the chamber,
 revealing a large, open well where the massive stone structure had
 been.  Stylized diagrams of what appear to be constellations have been
 carved into the chamber's floor and walls.  They form a line extending
 from the center of the well's northern edge, across the floor, and up
 to the top of the chamber's northern wall.  The mirror is mounted at
 its middle so that its reflective surface can tilt forward or back.
 Presently, the mirror is angled toward the lesser bruin etched on the
 floor, midway between the well and the northern wall.An open doorway
 leads southward, into sunlight.

>go south
 You step through the doorway into the brilliant glow of the midday sun,
 and find yourself on a rock-strewn ridge just above the trail which led
 you to the oracle's cave.  Carrying the oracle's gift, you eagerly
 begin the long journey home.

 Over the next few months, the tide of the battle turns in favor of your
 people. Working night and day, hundreds of the great bows are fashioned
 and distributed.  Arrows by the thousands are made, tipped with iron
 points.  Led by groups of archers, your dwindling forces become
 invincible.  Able to rain death upon the invaders from across the
 battlefield, the enemy is quickly brought to its knees.  Peace returns
 to your people.

 Years roll by, and your notoriety among the people refuses to fade.
 You are respected, revered, even feared by many.  You are known to all

 The drums of war have beaten long throughout the land of your
 forefathers.  At night, the fiendish glow of enemy campfires has shone
 orange and horrible on the horizon for as many years as you can recall.
 The warriors of your land have battled long and valiantly against the
 demon hordes pressing relentlessly forward, assailing your
 ever-diminishing borders.  The fight has been mighty, but the strength
 of your people has begun to wane.  Only a few of the warriors remain to
 lead the rag-tag brigades of youthful peasants into battle.

 The council of elders has seen that it is not long before the invaders
 will breach the skirmish lines and plunder the farms and villages of
 your homeland.  The council has decreed that after centuries of
 silence, the voice of the great oracle must be heard once more if this
 horrible foe is to be repelled.

 Barely old enough to follow the warriors into battle, you were filled
 with great pride when you were selected as the messenger who would be
 sent to beg the great oracle for her counsel.  The elders summoned you
 into the great hall, admonishing you to stay on the old path leading
 into the high mountains.  After precious few other words of
 instruction, they sent you on your way.

 For many days now, you have trod the ancient trail, winding higher and
 higher into the rugged peaks of the Black Mountains.  Cold, hungry and
 alone, you somehow sense that you are nearing the oracle's hiding place
 deep within the great mountain.  At last, the crumbling path fades away
 at the foot of a vast wall of solid rock

 Cliff Base
    The greatest peak of the Black Mountains rises sharply before you;
 an impenetrable dagger of dark granite jutting high into the clouds
 above.  You stand at the base of an immense cliff, where a deep alcove
 has been chiseled from the living rock.  It almost appears to be the
 yawning mouth of a great, black cave.  As you stand at its entrance you
 can see steps cut from the jagged stone, leading southward into the
 bowels of the mountain.

 Hall of the Cherubim
    Along the northern wall of this great hall stand three massive
 bronze cherubim, each at least the height of three men.  Their mighty
 wings are swept forward, covering their respectfully downturned faces.
 The powerful arms of each statue are extended forward:  the first grips
 the axle of a bronze wheel suspended between his clenched fists; the
 second holds a brass censer from which pungent, sweet-smelling smoke
 escapes, filling the chamber with an aromatic, bluish haze; the third
 cups a copper sphere in his upturned palms.  The three seem to be
 bowing deferentially toward an ornate archway leading southward.
 Another archway leads back to the west.  A ceremonial chest sits in the
 southeastern corner.
    The brass censer seems to contain a burning block of incense.

 Silent Chamber
    This small chamber is floored with clean, soft sand.  An open
 archway leads westward.  To the east a grand, ornately decorated arch
 leads into a chamber beyond.

>go west
 Silent Hall
    This is a great, empty chamber.  The floor is covered with fine sand
 which muffles the sound of your footsteps.  The sound of your movements
 no longer echoes off the stone walls as it has previously, giving this
 area an almost solemn nuance.  Open archways exit to the east and west.

>go west
 Spiral Staircase, Bottom
    This is the lower landing of the great spiral staircase which twists
 upward into darkness.  An open archway leads eastward.

>go up
 Spiral Staircase, Middle
    You are somewhere near the middle of the great spiral staircase deep
 under the mountain.  A small hole has been bored into the wall here.
 The steps wind their way upward and downward.

>go up
 Spiral Staircase, Top
    This is the upper landing of a great spiral staircase that winds its
 way downward into darkness.  Its broad steps have been chopped from the
 living rock.  An open archway leads northward.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go north
 Great Hall, Southern End
    This is the southern end of the great hall which continues into
 darkness northward.  The rumbling hiss of the underground river echoes
 faintly off the blank stone walls.  A huge block of granite is
 suspended near the ceiling directly above an open doorway which leads
 southward.  Immediately in front of the doorway, a rectangular patch of
 the stone floor is dark with moisture.

>go north
 Great Hall, Middle
    You are somewhere near the middle of the great hall.  The giant
 chamber extends onward into darkness toward the north and south.  The
 crashing din of the underground river reverberates off the blank stone
 walls.  The noise sounds as though it is coming from the north.  An
 iron trapdoor has been set in the chamber's floor here.

>go north
 Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into
 darkness southward.  The underground river rushes past at the hall's
 northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
 near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  River water
 flows swiftly through the channel and splashes noisily past the
 stationary wheel.  A great iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and
 is wound tightly around the wheel's great axle.

>get sword
 Taken.

>enter river
 As you leave, the unsupported flow-control gate slips shut, cutting off
 the flow of water past the waterwheel.  Once the water ceases flowing,
 the great wheel creaks and shudders to a halt.  The iron chain wrapped
 around the wheel's axle is drawn back up into the ceiling and the wheel
 begins to turn in reverse, splashing water onto the floor and walls.
 Again you hear the grinding sound coming from the southern end of the
 hall.  The distant grinding terminates with a resonating thump and the
 great chain falls slack.  The loops of chain wound around the axle
 tumble noisily onto the floor.

 You leap into the raging river's churning waters and are swept away by
 the powerful current.  Just downstream from the great hall, a small
 grotto has formed where the river has eroded away the solid stone.  You
 make a futile attempt to swim toward the grotto, but the current is far
 too swift.  Your battle to keep your head above the churning surface
 ends suddenly when you strike your skull sharply against a submerged
 rock, and all becomes black...

 You awaken suddenly, your head hammering with pain.  You have no idea
 where you are, but you are no longer buffetted by the icy river and
 your clothing is dry. You have no clear recollection of how you arrived
 in this place, but you seem to remember a sudden flash of daylight...
 an arm reaching down, plucking you out of the water, dragging you back
 into darkness...  a grim, bearded face looking down upon you -
 unmoving...  tunnels, passages, twisting, turning, climbing...

 Stone Altar
    This space was hollowed out of the solid stone of the mountain,
 chisel-marks from the ancient laborers can still be seen on its rough
 hewn walls.  The room is slightly oval shaped with a squat, stone altar
 set on the floor at its southernmost end.  A metal chime, heavily
 corroded after centuries of neglect, hangs from a stand mounted at one
 of its ends.  A rivulet of clear water splashes into the room through a
 doorway that enters from the north.  The stream flows placidly down the
 room's length and disappears through an iron grate set in the floor
 just in front of the altar.

 An open archway exits eastward.
    Sitting on the stone altar is a rusted sword.

>get altar
 You can't have the stone altar.

>get sword

>stand on altar
 You are now perched atop the stone altar.

>ring chime
 The chime rings out, its tone is sharp, clear and of quite high pitch.

>ring chime
 The chime rings out.  Again the note is clear and bright, but it seems
 to be of a distinctly lower pitch than before.

>ring chime
 The chime rings out with a low, throaty tone, surprisingly clear for
 its apparent decay.

 Incredibly, fine lines seem to etch themselves into the altar's smooth
 top.  The lines join to form a rectangle which includes almost all of
 the altar's upper surface.  The stone within the rectangle suddenly
 vanishes revealing a wide chimney leading down, directly through the
 altar, into darkness.

 You feel the stone vaporize beneath you followed by the terrifying,
 sickening sensation of falling.  Blackness surrounds you, and you
 continue to fall.

 With a crash that sounds like a clap of thunder, you plunge into a
 frigid, underground lake.  You are stung with icy cold as the water
 quickly soaks your clothing.  You break the surface gasping and
 sputtering, fighting to keep your breath.

 Flooded Chamber, Surface of Water
    You are treading water in a large chamber that has been almost
 completely flooded by a waterfall that crashes down from somewhere high
 above you in the darkness.

 You are on the open lake.  Dark water surrounds you on all sides.

 You haul yourself out of the frigid water into the alcove.  You stand,
 shivering violently for some time.  Again the amulet glows with
 pleasant heat and you are eventually warmed.

 of the creation of the world's many canyons.  A great and horrible
 dragon is shown raking his massive claws through the earth, leaving
 behind vast furrows through which the mighty rivers begin to flow.

    You are near the chamber's eastern wall.  The stone wall continues

 You notice a gentle current flowing past you into the dark opening.

>go east
 You swim eastward into the dark passageway.  The force of the current
 grows stronger and stronger until it sweeps you helplessly along.  In
 the darkness you scrape against the uneven stone walls and are pounded
 mercilessly into submerged boulders.  Your lungs burn with the desire
 for breath, but the cold water refuses to release you from its icy
 grip.  Consciousness begins to slip away from you.  The roaring, black
 water and jagged stones are fading into warm, gray oblivion...

 You are slammed back into wakefulness when your body is hurled over the
 precipice of a subterranean waterfall and spilled into an underground
 river flowing swiftly beneath the great mountain.  The river's dark
 channel is not completely submerged, and your head breaks the surface.
 Frantically, you draw in gasping lungfuls of air.

 After being swept along for some distance, the river's course turns
 suddenly.  You are pushed over a cluster of submerged stones near the
 rocky bank.  The great sword at your side somehow catches between the
 stones, stopping you dead in the raging current.  Fighting against the
 power of the river, you grasp hold of the slippery stones and work
 yourself free.  You scrabble along toward the river's edge and finally
 haul yourself out of the freezing water.  You find yourself in another
 great, subterranean chamber.

 Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into
 darkness southward.  The underground river rushes past at the hall's
 northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
 near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  A great
 iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and attatches to the
 waterwheel's axle.

>f e
 I don't know the word "f".

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>open gate
 You raise the gate along its track and water spills into the sluice,
 filling the waterwheel's scoops.  After a moment, the force of the
 flowing water builds, and with a low, groaning creak, the great wheel
 begins to turn.  The iron chain is wound, clanking and scraping, onto
 the axle by the waterwheel's rotation.  The chain draws tight and the
 waterwheel's speed slows considerably. The wheel continues to turn
 however, drawing more chain down from some hidden place in the ceiling.
 The great chain is gradually wound around the great oaken axle as
 though it were a giant spool of thread.  A loud, grinding sound echoes
 from the southern end of the hall.  Finally, the chain stops feeding
 down from the ceiling and the wheel creaks to a halt.  The water in the
 sluice splashes noisily past the motionless wheel.

>put sword under gate
 You plunge the sword down into the flowing water, its point catches
 against the channel's stone bottom.  You tuck the sword's hilt under
 the gate's lower edge. The arrangement holds, keeping the gate fully
 open.

>turn wheel
 You grasp one of the mighty oaken beams and try with all your might to
 move the great wheel.  It refuses to move at all.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>f n
 I don't know the word "f".

>go north
 You leap into the raging river's churning waters and are swept away by
 the powerful current.  Just downstream from the great hall, a small
 grotto has formed where the river has eroded away the solid stone.  You
 make a futile attempt to swim toward the grotto, but the current is far
 too swift.  Your body is pummelled brutally.  Several times your head
 is cracked sharply against one of the many submerged boulders strewn
 along the river bed.  Were it not for the proud silver helm you wear,
 these blows surely would be fatal.

 You are spilled once more over the crest of an underground waterfall
 and your body is caught in a whirlpool.  The incredible force of the
 twisting water sucking you down, deeper and deeper into the black
 depths.  Consciousness slips quickly away, as the breath is squeezed
 from your lungs...

 You awaken suddenly, your head hammering with pain.  You have no idea
 where you are, but you are no longer buffetted by the icy river and
 your clothing is dry. You have no clear recollection of how you arrived

 you from being dragged further downstream.  Fighting to keep your head

 eroded away the solid stone.  You flail about in the water, gradually
 working your way toward it.

 You haul yourself out of the river and into the damp, moss-lined
 alcove.

 Grotto
    You are in a small grotto carved out of the stone where the river
 sweeps sharply northward.  Soft green moss lines the walls.  A large
 bronze wheel is mounted on the grotto's rear wall.  The river rages

 almost deafening.  The great iron chain (which you are holding) dangles
 into the swirling torrent.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

 It is mounted on a shaft which extends through the grotto's eastern

 hand, and turn it.  The wheel yields with a stiff, grating sensation
 which becomes progressively smoother as you turn it further.  It spins
 through several rotations and comes to a sudden stop.

>go north
 You plunge back into the river, gripping the chain tightly.  The
 current buffets you wildly as you clamber up the slippery links.
 Nearly exhausted, you pull yourself up the rocky bank and out of the
 water.Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into

 quite certain it wasn't there earlier.

>examine curtains
 The silken curtains were once a deep, shimmering blue color.  The
 ravages of time have reduced them to slate gray rags that hang
 sorrowfully on the walls.

>go west
 Great Hall, Northern End
    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into
 darkness southward.  The underground river rushes past at the hall's
 northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
 near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
 the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  A great
 iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and forms a rusty pile on the
 floor.

 A doorway seems to have opened in the hall's eastern wall.  You are
 quite certain it wasn't there earlier.

>inventory
 You have a golden amulet (being worn), a ceremonial sceptre, a brass
 tinderbox, a gold torque (being worn), a gold coin, a ruby, a broken
 iron screw, a silver helm (being worn), a rusted sword, a rusted metal
 rod, and a milky-white crystal.

>score
 In a total of 557 turns, you have achieved a score of 70 points out of
 a possible 90.

>put iron chain in large hole
 You thread the free end of the iron chain into the large hole bored
 through the great axle.

>put rod in hole
 You slide the metal rod into the smaller hole until the hooked end
 rests against the axle.

>raise gate
 You raise the gate along its track and water spills into the sluice,
 filling the waterwheel's scoops.  After a moment, the force of the
 flowing water builds, and with a low, groaning creak, the great wheel
 begins to turn.  The iron chain is wound, clanking and scraping, onto
 the axle by the waterwheel's rotation.  The chain draws tight and the
 waterwheel's speed slows considerably. The wheel continues to turn
 however, drawing more chain down from some hidden place in the ceiling.
 The great chain is gradually wound around the great oaken axle as
 though it were a giant spool of thread.  A loud, grinding sound echoes
 from the southern end of the hall.  Finally, the chain stops feeding
 down from the ceiling and the wheel creaks to a halt.  The water in the
 sluice splashes noisily past the motionless wheel.

>put sword under gate
 You plunge the sword down into the flowing water, its point catches
 against the channel's stone bottom.  You tuck the sword's hilt under
 the gate's lower edge. The arrangement holds, keeping the gate fully
 open.

>go south
 Great Hall, Middle
    You are somewhere near the middle of the great hall.  The giant
 chamber extends onward into darkness toward the north and south.  The
 crashing din of the underground river reverberates off the blank stone
 walls.  The noise sounds as though it is coming from the north.  An
 iron trapdoor has been set in the chamber's floor here.

>go south
 Great Hall, Southern End
    This is the southern end of the great hall which continues into
 darkness northward.  The rumbling hiss of the underground river echoes
 faintly off the blank stone walls.  A huge block of granite is
 suspended near the ceiling directly above an open doorway which leads
 southward.  Immediately in front of the doorway, a rectangular patch of
 the stone floor is dark with moisture.

>go south
 Spiral Staircase, Top
    This is the upper landing of a great spiral staircase that winds its
 way downward into darkness.  Its broad steps have been chopped from the
 living rock.  An open archway leads northward.

>go down
 Spiral Staircase, Middle
    You are somewhere near the middle of the great spiral staircase deep
 under the mountain.  A small hole has been bored into the wall here.
 The steps wind their way upward and downward.

>go down
 Spiral Staircase, Bottom
    This is the lower landing of the great spiral staircase which twists
 upward into darkness.  An open archway leads eastward.

>go east
 Silent Hall
    This is a great, empty chamber.  The floor is covered with fine sand
 which muffles the sound of your footsteps.  The sound of your movements
 no longer echoes off the stone walls as it has previously, giving this
 area an almost solemn nuance.  Open archways exit to the east and west.

>go east
 Silent Chamber
    This small chamber is floored with clean, soft sand.  An open
 archway leads westward.  To the east a grand, ornately decorated arch
 leads into a chamber beyond.

>go east
 Hall of the Cherubim
    Along the northern wall of this great hall stand three massive
 bronze cherubim, each at least the height of three men.  Their mighty
 wings are swept forward, covering their respectfully downturned faces.
 The powerful arms of each statue are extended forward:  the first grips
 the axle of a bronze wheel suspended between his clenched fists; the
 second holds a brass censer from which pungent, sweet-smelling smoke
 escapes, filling the chamber with an aromatic, bluish haze; the third
 cups a copper sphere in his upturned palms.  The three seem to be
 bowing deferentially toward an ornate archway leading southward.
 Another archway leads back to the west.  A ceremonial chest sits in the
 southeastern corner.
    The brass censer seems to contain a burning block of incense.

>examine sphere
 The sphere is made from polished copper.  Its surface is etched with
 mystical symbols.  You recognize them as constellations that can be
 seen in the night sky.  A small bronze arrow, an indicator of some
 sort, points toward one of the constellations on the sphere's surface.
 It points to the lesser bruin.

>go south
 The Well
    The walls of this chamber are black, as if coated with thick soot.
 A faint haze of scented smoke billows in through the archway, filling
 the chamber with a sweet odor.  A polished, copper mirror, easily as
 tall as yourself, stands atop a massive stone dais near the center of
 the room.  The dais seems to have slid further back into the chamber,
 revealing a large, open well where the massive stone structure had
 been.  Stylized diagrams of what appear to be constellations have been
 carved into the chamber's floor and walls.  They form a line extending
 from the center of the well's northern edge, across the floor, and up
 to the top of the chamber's northern wall.  The mirror is mounted at
 its middle so that its reflective surface can tilt forward or back.
 Presently, the mirror is angled toward the lesser bruin etched on the
 floor, midway between the well and the northern wall.

>put amulet in well
 The amulet falls into the depths of the well, illuminating its stone
 sides as it plummets downward.  Eventually, the amulet's glow dwindles
 to a tiny pinpoint and finally, it winks out entirely.  You find
 yourself in total darkness.

 The blackness seems to close in upon you, choking the breath from your
 lungs.  Your heart hammers wildly in your chest.  The fear of dying,
 cold and alone deep in the bowels of the earth, suddenly grips you and
 holds you in its icy claws.

 An intensely bright beam of brilliant, white light suddenly blasts
 upward from within the well, and reflects off the mirror's polished
 surface.  The reflected beam of light illuminates the diagram of the
 lesser bruin etched on the floor, midway between the well and the
 northern wall.

 The blinding light slowly begins to change.  It becomes a softer, blue
 color, streaked here and there with rays of gold and red.  The beam of
 light illuminates the haze of sweet-smelling smoke that has drifted
 into the chamber from the north.  The billowing smoke seems to gather
 in upon itself, as though it were attracted to the beautiful light by
 some unseen force.  The smoke begins to swirl and churn within the beam
 of light, casting weird, sinuous shadows about the room.  It coalesces
 further into a tiny thunderstorm of brilliant color and flashing light.

 You notice a low, humming sound that fills the chamber, echoing wildly
 off the dark stone walls.  The humming becomes a loud whirring as the
 iridescent colors flash faster and faster.  The whirring increases to a
 near deafening roar.  The cloud of smoke thrums and pulses with
 blinding bursts of intensely colored light.  You clap your hands over
 your ears, attempting vainly to shut out the thunderous din, but it is
 of no use.  The tumult of sound and explosion of light seem ready to
 rend the very stone walls with their fury.

 With an incredibly powerful thump that vibrates you to the bone, all
 falls silent and the maelstrom of light calms to a steady glow.  Within
 the cloud of smoke, a beautiful, feminine face appears.  You draw in a
 sharp breath as you finally behold the oracle.

 It is a face of delicate beauty and timeless wisdom.  It is a face that
 has seen the birth of the world, and bears the weighty knowledge of the
 hour of its death.  The oracle regards you contemplatively for a
 moment.

    "You have travelled far to see me," her silken voice rolls forth
 like a wave crashing on some distant shore.  It is a voice of wonder,
 of horror.  It is the voice of dreams fulfilled.

    "I have watched the plight of your people, I know the great peril
 that lies before them..."  Her voice trails away like the falling of
 autumn leaves.

    "I have not the power to deliver your people from this plight."  She
 says with an expression of pensive sorrow.  "A new age is opening in
 the world, and the age past must fade away; along with it, my power in
 the world fades as well.  Already, you have seen the signs of this
 changing.  Mankind no longer seeks out the wisdom of the great ones.
 He has learned for himself the secrets of magic and science.  Flames at
 the altars to the gods burn no longer.  The gifts which the immortals
 once bestowed upon man, he will now obtain for himself.  Our time has
 come to a close."

 A wooden staff appears on the floor before the oracle.  "Take this,"
 she says softly, her voice beginning to fade, "I cannot deliver your
 homeland, but with this gift you can set yourselves free."

 The wondrous face hangs in the air for a long moment, the features
 growing less distinct as the cloud of smoke gradually diffuses.  The
 beam of light dwindles away and finally disappears completely.

 With a lumbering, scraping sound a doorway opens in the southern wall
 and a flood of sunlight pours into the chamber.
