 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.

 The desert sand squirms beneath your feet, alive with mutant
 nanomachines.  Sheriff Clayton has Elias.  He's hanging him at noon.

 It looks like you're going to have to shoot some people.

 Gun Mute
 An IF shoot-em-up by C.E.J.  Pacian
 Version 5 - Developed with TADS 3

 [Type 'About' if this is your first time playing.
 Type 'Credits' to learn who's responsible for this drivel.]

 Radiation Plains
 Rolling dunes stretch in every direction, ending in a distant horizon
 broken only by a few low, jagged mountains.  A small pile of sticks
 burns here, sending a thin trail of black smoke into the ruddy dawn
 sky.

 A pot of some strange green fluid sits bubbling on the fire.

 The plainswoman sits meditatively by the fire, her spear resting
 across her lap.

>examine me
 You're Mute Lawton.  A devilishly handsome cowboy with windswept black
 hair and roguish stubble.  Lean and tall, your tanned body is taut
 with cool, calculated strength.

 You're topless and barefoot, wearing nothing but a pair of dust-caked
 black jeans and your holster.

 Far in the distance, you can just make out something uttering a low,
 metallic howl.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing, and are wearing a pair of dusty black jeans
 and a gun belt (which contains a six shooter and numerous bullets).

 The plainswoman leans forward to sniff the concoction brewing on the
 fire.  She sits back again shortly after, apparently unsatisfied.

>listen
 You hear nothing out of the ordinary.

>examine plainswoman
 A woman with straight black hair and a stony stare.  Her long, slender
 limbs are coiled with ropy muscle.  Otherwise completely naked, her
 body is caked in a layer of sun-hardened mud.

 The plainswoman is carrying a spear.

 The wind picks up briefly, cooling your skin.

 limbs are coiled with ropy muscle.  Otherwise completely naked, her
 body is caked in a layer of sun-hardened mud.

 The plainswoman is carrying a spear.

 The plainswoman leans forward once more to sniff the strange liquid.
 This time she smiles and gestures to the pot.

 "Drink," she tells you.


>examine pot
 The small, battered metal pot contains a thick green fluid that
 bubbles in an eerily slow fashion.

>about
 Gun Mute is intended as an Interactive Fiction shoot-em-up.  Each
 location presents you with a simple puzzle which you must solve before
 you can progress to the next location and, in contrast to the Inform
 parser's famous default response, violence usually is the answer.

 You'll find that there are only two directions to move in: FORWARDS or
 F; BACKWARDS or B.  Other useful, non-standard commands include:

    DRAW
    SHOOT CLAW-HAND HANK
    TAKE COVER BEHIND TRACTOR
    WAVE TO PLAINSWOMAN
    POINT AT SPEAR
    NOD
    SHAKE HEAD

 Note that in most locations, simply typing 'take cover' or 'duck' will
 automatically move you behind any available cover.  A complete list of
 the twenty-odd natural language commands you'll need to complete the
 game can be found by typing 'instructions'.

 I would finally like to add that I'm a pacifist, and this game is in
 no way intended to encourage you to solve real life problems with a
 six shooter.

 Hugses,
    Pacian

>instructions
 Gun Mute is much simpler than your typical work of IF, and you'll be
 able to progress through the game using only the commands listed below
 in the right ways and at the right times.

 To move through the various locations you will need to refer to only
 two directions: forwards, towards the end of the game; or backwards
 through those areas you've already beaten.

    FORWARDS    or  F
    BACKWARDS   or  B

 Although this is a shoot-em-up, to figure out what to shoot and why,
 you'll need to look around and examine your environment:

    LOOK AROUND or  L
    EXAMINE POT or  X POT

 The only useful item you'll need on your journey is your trusty six
 shooter.  It starts in your holster, so you'll need to draw it before
 facing danger.

    TAKE GUN or DRAW

 Your gun is good for one thing:

    SHOOT FRED

 Naturally, your six shooter only holds six rounds:

    RELOAD

 At times you may find calm in the eye of the storm, and wish to
 present a more peaceful appearance.

    PUT GUN IN HOLSTER or HOLSTER GUN

 You're far from bulletproof, so when the bullets are flying, it can be
 a good idea to get your head down.

    TAKE COVER BEHIND ROCK

 It's not always obvious what you can take cover behind, so simply
 typing TAKE COVER will always either move you behind cover (if there's
 only one obvious place to do so) or give you an informative answer
 about what cover is available.

 Get out from behind that rock by typing:

    STAND

 Sometimes, the only sane action is to do nothing.

    WAIT or Z

 What are you carrying, anyway?

    INVENTORY or I

 As a rough cowboy, you're naturally fond of your fluids.

    DRINK BEER

 Beneath a violent facade, beats a tender heart.

    KISS ELIAS

 Is there something where it shouldn't be?

    REMOVE SPLINTER

 Some people may want to communicate with you, despite your apparent
 unpopularity.

    WAVE TO PLAINSWOMAN
    POINT AT SPEAR
    NOD
    SHAKE HEAD

 A number of other commands common to IF have been implemented, but are
 not necessary to progress and may not function as you expect (obvious
 example: taking items).  Some will still provide informative or
 amusing answers though, so experiment if you want.

 You're not expected to play the whole game in one sitting.  Typing
 SAVE will open a dialogue that will allow you to save your progress in
 a file.  Typing RESTORE will allow you to load such a file.  On a
 smaller scale, if you stick your head above the parapet at the wrong
 moment, you can type UNDO to turn back time to before the last action.

 Typing HINT will open up the murky and immoral world of puzzle
 spoilers, if you find yourself getting stuck.

 Finally, when you get bored you can close the window or type:

    QUIT

>smell liquid
 You've got out of the habit of smelling random things.  You're often
 unpleasantly surprised.

>examine speak
 The word "speak" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points
 out an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your
 next command.)

>examine spear
 Pointy sticks have come along way of late.  This particular example
 has a lightweight polycarbonate shaft and a tip that glimmers with an
 incandescent plasma fire.  You townsfolk have little time for the old
 ways of science though, and you'd happily take your reliable six
 shooter over something that probably has an arrogant computerised mind
 of its own.

>look
 Radiation Plains

 broken only by a few low, jagged mountains.  A small pile of sticks
 burns here, sending a thin trail of black smoke into the ruddy dawn
 sky.

 A pot of some strange green fluid sits bubbling on the fire.

 The plainswoman sits meditatively by the fire, her spear resting
 across her lap.

>ask woman about fluid
 There's a reason they call you Mute Lawton.

>point to spear
 You point at the spear.

 "A fine weapon," the plainswoman says, "far superior to your crude
 firearm."

 Something grey and amorphous squirms up between your toes.  You step
 to the side.

>examine amorphous
 The word "amorphous" is not necessary in this story.

>point to pot
 You point at the pot of strange green fluid.

 The plainswoman adopts a serious expression.  "It is the highest
 aspiration to see one's consciousness join the Atmospheric Network,
 and the greatest magnanimity that they deign to help those of us still
 in physical form."

 You squint as a cloud of airborne dust passes by.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Saved.

>drink
 (the pot of strange green fluid)
 You bring the pot to your lips and gulp down the bubbling green
 liquid.  It smells foul, and it's burning hot.  The roof of your mouth
 tingles unpleasantly as you set the pot back down on the fire.

 The plainswoman studies you carefully as you grimace, the tingling in
 the roof of your mouth seeming to spread upwards, into your brain,
 dancing psychedelically before your eyes.  And then arcane symbols
 rise through the white noise oppressing your mind: ++GPS UPLINK
 VERIFIED++TEMPORARY THERMOBOT NETWORK++SEARCHING FOR USER...++USER
 LOCATED++CREATING INSTINCTUAL IMPRINT++CLOSING CONNECTION++THANK YOU
 FOR USING GPSNET++

 The vision fades.  Gradually you become aware of your surroundings
 again, the plainswoman watching you with mild concern.

 "You find the one you fear for?" she asks.

 You nod.  Yes, you know where he is now.  The way ahead is now
 obvious.

 Rocky Hill
 From the peak of this rocky hill you can see the town you once called
 home sprawl out over the landscape ahead.  Ramshackle iron and wood
 buildings are almost piled on top of one another, clustering around
 the shattered concrete dome of the old reactor.

 coated in sickly weeds.

 Corral
 You're at the entrance to a street of low wooden buildings and
 corrugated iron shacks.  A small corral encircles part of the dusty
 ground here, home to a single broken robot and a trough of stagnant
 water.

 Vicious Sue faces you with one hand on her six shooter, smirking.

 Claw-Hand Hank stands by the water trough, legs apart, his one good
 hand ready to draw.

 "Well, well, well," Sue says, looking you over.  "Look who it ain't.
 Sheriff said you'd be through here.  But me, I didn't think you were
 quite so stupid."

 Hank spits out a wad of tobacco and chuckles, fingering the buckle of
 his gun belt with his good hand.

>SAVE

>examine robot
 Once some sort of multi-legged farming machine, it now disintegrates
 into the ground, rubber hoses and shattered circuit boards visible
 through its corroded sides.

 Hank bares his half-rotten teeth in a leering smile.

>take cover
 There's no cover here.

 Hank's good hand twitches slightly.

>examine sue
 A hawkish woman in jeans and a close-fitting jacket.  Her vulturine
 eyes peer out from beneath the rim of her stetson, flitting between
 your face and your hands.

 Hank touches his fingertip to the handle of his gun, then draws it
 back again uncertainly.

>examine trough
 A shallow metal container, stained with mould and filled with putrid
 green water.

 Sue catches your eye and smiles evilly.

>examine robot

 Hank unconsciously squints his left eye as he stares at you.

>draw
 You whip your gun out of its holster in a single fluid motion.

 Vicious Sue and Claw-Hand Hank go for their guns.  Sue has drawn her
 six shooter in a flash, but Hank fumbles with his holster.

>shoot sue
 You fire at Vicious Sue, hitting her square in the stomach.  She
 freezes for a moment, as if unsure what's happened, and then falls to
 the ground.

 Hank finally manages to draw his gun.  He takes careful aim at you,
 squinting his left eye.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>shoot hank
 You shoot Claw-Hand Hank in the face.  His head jerks back with a puff
 of splintered teeth and he collapses into the water trough.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 (your six shooter)
 You quickly empty the spent casings from your six shooter and replace
 them with live bullets.

>holster
 (your six shooter)
 You slip your six shooter back into its holster.

>search sue
 There's nothing unusual in Vicious Sue.

>search hank
 There's nothing unusual in Claw-Hand Hank.

 Saloon Front
 This narrow, dusty street ends in a slat-fronted building bearing the
 name Rowdy Juanita's Saloon.  A broken-down tractor rests here, its
 dismantled engine spilling out onto the ground.

 Deputy Gene stands in front of the saloon, brandishing a
 double-barrelled shotgun.

 "If you're planning on rescuing Elias," Gene snarls, "you're gonna
 have to shoot your way through the whole damn town.  I'd turn back now
 if you don't want to end up sleeping in a pine box with a tombstone
 pillow!"

 Gene takes careful aim at you with his shotgun, about to fire...

>take cover
 You can't have that; it's part of the broken-down tractor.

 With a powerful report, Gene fires.  The buckshot blast catches you
 square in the chest.  The last thing you see is the pink mist that was
 your lungs only an instant earlier.

 *** GAME OVER ***

 In 40 moves, you have scored 3 of a possible 20 points.  This makes

 Gene breaks open the shotgun.  Two smoking cartridge cases are ejected
 from the breach.

 Okay, you're now standing.

 Gene slots two new shells into his shotgun and closes the breech.  He
 takes careful aim at you once more.

>shoot gene
 You and Gene both fire at the same time.  And your bodies hit the dirt
 within a few seconds of one another.

 Saloon
 Rowdy Juanita's Saloon is a homely place, and mostly clean.  A shady
 refuge from the wasteland sun, a shaft of harsh light shines in
 through the doorway, enveloping countless dancing motes of dust in its
 glare.  A multitude of round tables are dotted around the carefully
 polished bar, and sturdy wooden beams criss-cross the high ceiling.

 Rowdy Juanita stands behind the bar, a six shooter in each of her
 upper set of hands, a third being reloaded by her lower arms.

 "Hi Mute," Juanita says cheerfully.  "Watch out!  The sheriff
 reprogrammed me to shoot you on sight!"

 And with that she starts firing wildly with both guns, wood
 splintering and glass shattering around the bar.

 "It's a good thing I can't shoot worth a damn," Juanita says.  "You
 should be safe as long as you don't get too close to me."

>shoot Juanita.
 You'll have to draw your gun first.

 "By the way," Juanita says, "When you find the sheriff, be sure to
 blow the crap out of him for me."

>draw
 You whip your gun out of its holster in a single fluid motion.

 "I'm really sorry about this," Juanita says.  "Believe me, the last
 thing I want to do is to shoot up my own bar."

>shoot juanita
 You don't want to shoot Juanita.  She's always been nice to you, and
 it's not her fault if she's been reprogrammed to blow your brains out.

 A whisky bottle on a nearby table explodes as a bullet hits it.  "Damn

>examine beams
 The ceiling is criss-crossed with thick wooden beams.  Suspended among
 the beams you see a chandelier.

 A bullet strikes the leg of a table, causing it to collapse
 explosively.  Juanita sighs.  "Fixing all this is gonna cost me."

>shoot chandelier
 You take careful aim at the rope anchoring the chandelier to the
 ceiling, and fire.  For a second it seems to hang suspended in thin
 air.  And then it drops down on Juanita with a terrifying crash.  You
 race over to her, worried that you've done her permanent damage.

 Pinned beneath the chandelier, her weapons scattered across the bar,
 Juanita looks up at you and offers a vinyl-lipped smile.  "Nice work,
 Mute.  Now get moving and stop that execution!"

 Train Station
 You're on a simple wooden platform next to the train tracks that run
 through the town.  Standing on thick tripod legs, a water tower casts
 its shadow over you, ready to supply coolant to nuclear-powered
 locomotives.  The only train in sight, however, is a single open
 railroad car, a gyro-controlled, multi-barrelled turret anchored to it
 with fat iron bolts.

 Gatling Gun Fiona sits at the controls of the turret, staring at you
 with fierce, emerald green eyes.

 "I been waiting for you!"  Fiona says, shouting over the whine of the
 turret's motors.  "I'm gonna make you into Swiss Cheese!"

>shoot tower
 It doesn't look like that would achieve much.

 With the earth-shuddering sound of screaming servos, the turret turns

 With the shriek of metal on metal, the spinning barrels suddenly come

 "Gods damn it!"  Fiona screams.  She looks down at the stationary
 barrels, which are glowing dull red and emitting noxious black smoke.
 "Hang on a moment," she tells you, almost apologetically, "I'll get
 back to killing you in a jiffy..."

 Fiona looks down at the turret's control panel and begins pressing
 buttons.

 It's difficult to see from this angle, but you're sure it has all
 sorts of neat buttons.

 The large chemical tank behind Fiona begins to tremble and groan.  She
 takes hold of the controls again and grins.

 With a tremendous hiss of steam, the hoses emerging from the tank
 douse the barrels in some sort of liquid.  When the steam has cleared,
 the barrels are no longer glowing.

 You're on a simple wooden platform next to the train tracks that run
 through the town.  Standing on thick tripod legs, a water tower casts
 its shadow over you, ready to supply coolant to nuclear-powered
 locomotives.  The only train in sight, however, is a single open
 railroad car, a gyro-controlled, multi-barrelled turret anchored to it
 with fat iron bolts.

 Gatling Gun Fiona sits at the controls of the turret, staring at you
 with fierce, emerald green eyes.

>hide under car
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>hide in car
 You can't take cover behind that.


 "Back in business!"  Fiona growls, as the barrels begin to spin back
 up to speed.

>hide
 (behind the water tower's legs)
 Okay, you're now taking cover behind the water tower's legs.

 With a sound like thunder splitting a mountain in two, Fiona's huge
 turret explodes into action.  Bullets strike the water tower's legs
 with frightening power, but the sturdy metal seems to withstand the
 onslaught.

>examine platform
 Better than standing on dirt as wait for a train.  Must make it easier
 to board as well.

 Fiona clings to the controls as the turret judders with the recoil of
 its own insane firepower.

>examine platform
 Better than standing on dirt as wait for a train.  Must make it easier
 to board as well.

 Bullets whip either side of you in a terrifying stream of sparks,
 ricocheting off of the water tower and kicking up a thick cloud of
 dust.

 A flat bed of metal on wheels, sitting on the train tracks.  It would
 have to be towed by a locomotive to actually get anywhere.

 The railroad car is currently home to a gyro-controlled,
 multi-barrelled turret.

 With the shriek of metal on metal, the spinning barrels suddenly come
 to a juddering halt.

 "Gods damn it!"  Fiona screams.  She looks down at the stationary
 barrels, which are glowing dull red and emitting noxious black smoke.
 "Hang on a moment," she tells you, almost apologetically, "I'll get
 back to killing you in a jiffy..."

 Fiona looks down at the turret's control panel and begins pressing
 buttons.

>examine tank
 A fat metal cylinder is mounted on the train carriage behind the
 turret.  A number of colourful warning signs are plastered to its
 sides.

 The large chemical tank behind Fiona begins to tremble and groan.  She
 takes hold of the controls again and grins.

 With a tremendous hiss of steam, the hoses emerging from the tank
 douse the barrels in some sort of liquid.  When the steam has cleared,
 the barrels are no longer glowing.

>read signs
 "Warning!  Extremely cold!  Handle with care!  Danger of severe
 injury!"


 "Back in business!"  Fiona growls, as the barrels begin to spin back
 up to speed.

>examine hoses
 Thick, rubbery hoses, covered in a pale frost.  They're connected to a
 valve on the cylinder and disappear somewhere under the turret.

 With a sound like thunder splitting a mountain in two, Fiona's huge
 turret explodes into action.  Bullets strike the water tower's legs
 with frightening power, but the sturdy metal seems to withstand the
 onslaught.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The barrels of the turret are a blur as they spit hundreds of rounds
 of high calibre ammunition at you.

>examine tower
 It's difficult to get a sense of what it looks like from up so close.
 You just get an impression of something large and metal blotting out a
 big chunk of the sky.

 The water tower's thick legs look like they could offer good cover
 from the turret.

 You can feel the staggering noise of the turret firing as it seems to
 rattle the whole desert.

>wait

 And then the tank starts spurting a huge stream of coolant out of its
 side, up into the air and very far from the red hot gun barrels.
 Fiona spins round to watch this with wide-eyes, and then turns back to
 face you with a terrified, placating smile.  "Let's talk about this
 like reasonable human beings," she says, standing up from the turret's
 control seat and holding up her empty hands.

 And then she jumps off of the turret, hitting the ground running.
 She's disappeared before you're even sure how to react.

 Church of Wrathzor
 Between cold stone walls, orderly rows of wooden pews face the pulpit
 ahead.  Vengeful angels peer down on the absent congregation from
 lofty stained-glass windows.

 Reverend Gun-Arm Joe stands in the pulpit.

 "We thought we'd never see you again, child," the reverend says.  His
 voice is quiet, but it echoes profoundly through the expanse of the
 church.  "Let us speak as equals.  Allow me to show you the path to
 happiness through peace.  Please, my son, put away your weapon."

>holster
 (your six shooter)
 You slip your six shooter back into its holster.

 "Now," Reverend Joe says, "allow me to show you the true peace
 delivered by the Hand of Wrathzor..."

 He holds his right arm out to the side as something inside it seems to
 whir and click.  In a single smooth, mechanical motion, the preacher's
 arm splits in two, divulging a sleek, nickel-plated machinegun.  He
 aims his arm at you, bracing himself against the pulpit.  "May
 Wrathzor have mercy on your soul," he intones, solemnly.

>hide
 (behind the pews)
 Okay, you're now taking cover behind the pews.

 Reverend Joe's machinegun arm spits out gunfire to a deafening
 staccato rhythm that rattles harshly against the stone walls.  Bullets
 rip through the pews, cracking and splintering the wood.  You throw
 your arms over your head defensively.

 "There is no point hiding, my son," the reverend booms, "for it is
 Wrathzor's judgement that you die, and you cannot hide from Him."

>draw
 You whip your gun out of its holster in a single fluid motion.

 The powerful recoil of the reverend's gun arm sends his aim climbing

 stone out of the ceiling.

 Okay, you're now standing.

 The reverend stops firing for a moment to regain his footing.

 blocking your path with her enormous metallic form.

 April's distorted voice booms from the metallic grill she has for a

 April raises her great metal fist into the air, blotting out the sun.

 A towering metal figure, topped with a transparent brain jar, her
 right fist obscenely huge.  She totters on stilt-like mechanical legs.
 A bright yellow symbol adorns her chest.

 April's shoulder clunks loudly, letting out bursts of steam.

 regains her footing in a slow and ungainly motion.

 April booms with laughter.  "A squishy meat-bag like you is no threat

 Undertaker's
 A dark little office.  The bright sunlight shining through the window
 casts a perfect square of light on the polished floor, as if it were
 too timid to wander away from a straight line.  Coffins stand in rows
 against one wall, funereal garbs against the other.

 Solemn Gertrude is here, in a black suit and top hat.

 When she sees you arrive, Gertrude stands up from her chair by the
 window and unrolls her tape measure.

 A tall, thin woman with almost albinic pale skin.  She wears a close
 fitting, jet-black suit and a shiny top hat.  Her movements are small
 and carefully calculated.  You remember Gertrude as being the one
 person in town more quiet than you.

 Gertrude steps lightly on one end of the tape measure, and holds it up
 to measure your height.

 The word "tape" is not necessary in this story.

 The word "measure" is not necessary in this story.

 A rather intimidating piece of headwear, really.

 Gertrude measures you across the shoulders.

>point to coffin
 You point at the coffins.

 Gertrude doesn't seem to notice.

 Gertrude quickly pulls out a notepad to jot down your measurements.

    1 point for trapping Juanita beneath the chandelier
    1 point for kissing Juanita
    1 point for scaring off Gatling Gun Fiona
    1 point for getting measured for your coffin

 You point at the funereal garbs.

 Gertrude doesn't seem to notice.

 Gertrude stands moderately far away from you and studies the floor.

 The word "notepad" is not necessary in this story.

>take hat
 You don't need to weigh yourself down with anything other than your
 trusty six shooter.

 Gertrude redirects her attention to the ceiling.

>look in coffin
 There's nothing unusual in the coffins.

 You catch Gertrude looking at you.  She turns her head sharply.

>examine ceiling
 You see nothing unusual about it.

 "Mute..."  Gertrude says, her voice almost a whisper.  "No, never
 mind."

>point to coffin
 You point at the coffins.

 Gertrude doesn't seem to notice.

 Gertrude opens her mouth and then closes it again shortly after.

>point to me
 You point at yourself.

 Gertrude doesn't seem to notice.

 Gertrude steps over to you, looking down at her feet.  "Mute, I know
 that... you must have passed Fiona to get this far.  I was just
 wondering, well, is she okay?"

>nod
 You nod your head.

 Gertrude remains absolutely impassive for quite a while.  Slowly but
 surely, though, her lips start to form a smile.  "Okay," she says, so
 quietly you have to strain to hear her.  "I'm glad."

 As you leave, Gertrude clears her throat - a soft sound a little like
 someone hitting a cloud with a ball of cotton wool.  "G-G-Good luck,"
 she stammers.  "If I see you again, I hope it's not in... a
 professional capacity."

 And then she unexpectedly races forward and throws her arms around
 your neck, her hands cold against your bare skin.  "Kill him," she
 whispers into your ear as she hugs you tightly.  "Don't hesitate to
 kill the sheriff.  If there has to be someone with a gun walking
 around the town shooting people, I want it to be you.  I trust you."

 She starts to let you go, blushing bright red.  You grab her roughly
 and kiss her on the cheek, your stubble scratching her pale skin.  She
 laughs with a shy happiness.

 You turn away from her and head out into the street.  The sun is high
 overhead.  It's almost time.

 Back Street
 This narrow, cramped back street twists and winds fitfully towards the
 town centre, and your goal.  A bare market stall stands here
 unattended.  A simple wooden cart blocks up the road.  A table sits
 here, ready to receive customers to a small restaurant nearby.  A
 small neglected garden is surrounded by a tall wooden fence.  In the
 garden, a sickly tree seems to have died long ago from dehydration.

 Gun-Run Raoul stands here, ready to draw.

 "Mute!"  Raoul calls out.  "Don't try and come any closer.  You know
 I'm the fastest draw in the wastelands, and I'd hate to have to riddle
 an otherwise decent citizen such as yourself full of bullet-holes."

>SAVE

>examine raoul
 A dusky, unshaven man with a multitude of guns and bullets strapped to
 his body.  He's smiling mirthlessly, a sad glimmer to his eye.

 "Hermano," Raoul pleads, "there's no bad blood between us.  Leave town
 while you still can."

>examine cart
 Two wheels and a large wooden bucket.  Nothing special, certainly, but
 it must do a pretty good job of carting things around.

 "Last chance, hermano," Raoul says, his hands slowly moving towards
 the many weapons he carries.  "Get out of here!"

>undo
 Taking back one turn: "x cart".

 You'll have to be a little more specific here.  You can take cover
 behind: The market stall.  The cart.  The restaurant table.  The
 wooden fence.  The sickly tree.

 "Last chance, hermano," Raoul says, his hands slowly moving towards
 the many weapons he carries.  "Get out of here!"

>hide behind sickly tree
 Okay, you're now taking cover behind the sickly tree.

 In a flash, Raoul has drawn a pair of six shooters.  He fires both in
 a rapid blur, a hail of bullets disintegrating the sickly tree.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Raoul's six shooters click empty.  He tosses them aside and pulls a
 lever-action rifle from over his shoulder.  He loads and fires the gun
 with inhuman efficiency, his hands a blur.  The high calibre bullets
 send you flying.  You're already dead by the time you land.

 You take careful aim at Raoul and squeeze the trigger.  Before you
 actually fire, however, Raoul has drawn his gun and shot you three
 times.  You drop your six shooter and stagger about a bit, too
 surprised to actually die right away.

 "Sorry Mute," Raoul says softly.

 Your legs give out and you collapse to the ground.

 utterly destroy the cart you're taking cover behind.

>hide behind fence
 Okay, you're now taking cover behind the wooden fence.

 Raoul tosses the rifle aside and pulls a sawn-off shotgun from a thigh

 you're taking cover behind explodes in a shower of splinters.

>hide behind table
 Okay, you're now taking cover behind the restaurant table.

 Raoul tosses the sawn-off shotgun aside and pulls an antique machine
 pistol from the back of his belt.  He fires indiscriminately, blowing

>hide behind tree
 Okay, you're now taking cover behind the sickly tree.

 You shoot the sheriff, the bullet tearing right through his chest
 explosively.  He lets out a yelp of pain and staggers briefly, before

 "Damn you, Mute!" the sheriff screams, "you want shooting?  I'll give
 you shooting!"

 Clayton whirls round, draws his six shooter and takes aim at Elias.

>shoot noose
 You put a bullet right through the rope dangling from the gallows.
 The noose falls slack around Elias' neck.

 The sheriff fires, his bullet striking Elias right through the heart.
 The man you love looks at you, one hand held out into the blood

 No!  You let your gun fall from your hands.

 He aims his six shooter at you and fires.  Still reeling from his
 gunshot wound, the sheriff misses by a hair's breadth, the bullet
 whipping past your bare arm.

>shoot sheriff
 You send a second bullet ripping through the sheriff's body.  He
 clutches his heart, blood gushing freely from his chest.  "You've
 killed me, Mute, but that ain't enough to stop me!"

 The sheriff fires, but his hands are shaking and his knees seem weak.
 The shot goes wide.

>shoot sheriff
 You blast sheriff Clayton again.  He falls to his hands and knees,
 struggling to keep his gun trained on you.  "Long as you're dead," he
 rasps, blood dripping down his chin, "I can rest easy in the
 hereafter!"

 The sheriff fires, discharging his gun impotently into the dirt.

 Under the Gallows
 You're in the shade beneath the gallows.  The air is deathly cold.

 Elias lies on the ground here, unconscious.

>kiss Elias.
 You kneel down next to Elias, gently touching his cheek to turn his
 head.  He doesn't have any visible injuries.  As you run your fingers
 through his hair he winces, stirring slightly, but doesn't wake.
 Slowly, you lean down, touching your lips to his.

 Elias opens his eyes and smiles.  "Mute," he whispers.  "I knew you'd
 save me."

 Lifeless Park
 The sun is low and red on the horizon, disappearing behind the
 buildings of the town.  The town looks about the same as ever, perhaps
 a little more run-down in some ways.  But the sheriff has been gone
 some time now.  Perhaps it's just you, but an oppressive air seems to
 have lifted.  People loiter on the streets, talking and bartering, the
 diseased slum-dwellers have been cleared out and moved to the new
 hospice.  It's still not much of a civilisation.  But it will do.

 The corpses of about a dozen mutant zomboids are laid out on the bone
 dry ground of the park.  Gun-Run Raoul watches over them, looking for
 any sign that they may not truly be dead.

 Gatling Gun Fiona and Solemn Gertrude stand nearby, chatting idly.

 Elias is close by your side.

>point to fiona
 You point at Gatling Gun Fiona.

 "She's growing on me," Elias says.  "Very, very slowly."

 "Oh, she's such a sweetheart," Elias says.  "Go kill some more people
 so she has something to do."

 Raoul rubs his unshaven jaw.

>point to raoul
 You point at Gun-Run Raoul.

 "He's done a lot for the town, hasn't he?"  Elias says.  "But I'm not
 about to go running to him the next time there's a noose around my
 neck."

 Fiona absently fingers the action of her machinegun.

>point to zomboids
 You point at the mutant zomboids.

 Elias pulls a face.  "Are you sure they're dead now?"

 Fiona playfully pokes Gertrude in the ribs.

>examine fiona
 Fiona stands by Raoul, a machinegun propped up in the dirt next to
 her.  Her gaze repeatedly wanders from the mutant zomboids towards
 Solemn Gertrude.

 Gertrude laughs shyly.

>point to me

 Elias leans over to kiss you on the cheek.

 Raoul prods one of the mutant zomboids with the barrel of his rifle.

 You're pretty sure they're dead for real this time.

 Fiona absently fingers the action of her machinegun.

>examine gertrude
 Solemn Gertrude stands by Fiona, looking down at the ground as she
 twists the tip of her shoe into the dirt.

 Raoul prods one of the mutant zomboids with the barrel of his rifle.

>examine me
 You're Mute Lawton.  A devilishly handsome cowboy with windswept black
 hair and roguish stubble.  Lean and tall, your tanned body is taut
 with cool, calculated strength.

 You're smartly dressed in a black suit and a three-quarter length
 overcoat.  A black stetson keeps the sun out of your eyes.

 Fiona playfully pokes Gertrude in the ribs.

>kiss elias
 You draw Elias closer and kiss him on the lips.  He folds easily into
 your embrace.

 Slender, dark haired, quite tall.  He regards you with kind, hazel
 eyes.

 Rowdy Juanita's Saloon
 Rowdy Juanita's Saloon is a homely place, and meticulously clean.  A
 shady refuge from the wasteland sun, a shaft of ruddy twilight shines
 in through the doorway, enveloping countless dancing motes of dust in
 its glare.  A multitude of round tables are dotted around the
 carefully polished bar, and sturdy wooden beams criss-cross the high
 ceiling.

 The former-execution bot trundles around behind the bar, a wash cloth
 in its single claw-like hand, while Rowdy Juanita is hard at work
 tending to the needs of her many customers.

 Elias is close by your side.

 "Well, if it isn't my two favourite patrons," Juanita exclaims.  "Your
 drinks are on the house."

 You see no drink here.

>point at bot
 You point at the execution bot.

 Elias sighs.  "I avoid him whenever I get the chance.  He's nice
 enough, but still..."

>take wine
 As she sees you raising your glass, Juanita heads over to you,
 brandishing a small capsule of machine oil.  "A toast," she says.  "To
 love."

 Elias meets your eye.  "What do you think?" he asks.  "To love?"

>nod
 You nod your head.

 Elias smiles and slips his arm in yours.  "To love, then," he says.

 "To love," Juanita repeats, her vinyl lips forming a wide smile.

 The three of you raise your glasses.

 Rowdy Juanita's Saloon
 Rowdy Juanita's Saloon is a homely place, and meticulously clean.  A
 shady refuge from the wasteland sun, a shaft of ruddy twilight shines
 in through the doorway, enveloping countless dancing motes of dust in
 its glare.  A multitude of round tables are dotted around the
 carefully polished bar, and sturdy wooden beams criss-cross the high
 ceiling.

 The former-execution bot trundles around behind the bar, a wash cloth
 in its single claw-like hand, while Rowdy Juanita stands nearby, a
 glass of machine oil in her hand.

 Elias is close by your side.

>shake
 What do you want to wake?

>no
 You must be more specific about whom you want to talk to.

 "To love," Elias says, slipping his arm in yours.

 "To love," Juanita repeats, her vinyl lips forming a wide smile.

 The three of you raise your glasses.

 *** THE END ***

 As she sees you raising your glass, Juanita heads over to you,
 brandishing a small capsule of machine oil.  "A toast," she says.  "To

 Elias meets your eye.  "What do you think?" he asks.  "To love?"

 You shake your head.

 Elias cottons on immediately.  "No," he says to Juanita.  "A toast to
 the dead.  Especially those we wanted dead.  May they stay that way,
 and rest in peace."

 Juanita smiles.  "How noble.  Okay: to the dead."

 Saloon
 Rowdy Juanita's Saloon is a homely place, and mostly clean.  A shady
 refuge from the wasteland sun, a shaft of harsh light shines in
 through the doorway, enveloping countless dancing motes of dust in its
 glare.  A multitude of round tables are dotted around the carefully
 polished bar, and sturdy wooden beams criss-cross the high ceiling.

 The floor is littered with splinters of wood and broken glass.

 A tattered and broken chandelier is propped up against the bar.

 Rowdy Juanita is lying half over the bar, trapped beneath a heavy
 chandelier.

>reprogram juanita
 The word "reprogram" is not necessary in this story.

>examine juanita
 Originally intended as a utilitarian synthetic wife for lonely
 wasteland farmers, Juanita is half farm machine, half sexbot.  Her
 figure has curvy, art deco proportions, while her four hydraulic arms
 can plough a whole field in minutes.

 Juanita is completely pinned down by a fallen chandelier.  Up close
 you can now see that a program crystal has been inserted into a port
 in the back of her head.

>program juanita
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>examine crystal
 A thin, translucent shard of nanoscale computer memory.

 "Do you see something that doesn't belong?"  Juanita asks.

>take crystal
 You take hold of the program crystal and pull it out of Juanita's head
 socket.

 Juanita sighs with relief.  "Ah, I feel much better now."

 She wedges her upper arms against the the bar and they begin to emit a
 low, hydraulic hiss.  "Don't worry about me," she says.  "I'll be out
 of here in no time.  Go save Elias!"

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)
