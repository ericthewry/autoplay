 Geez, mom really hacks you off sometimes.  I mean, making you do dishes
 while that new show "Captain Dangerous" is on.  Last week, Cap'n was
 having to fight off the slavering hordes of Gamma Proxima Epsilon
 Centauri Five B, and he and his side-kick Billy Bob had used up the
 last of their ammo keeping the zombie mind troopers at bay.  The evil
 over-leader had just shown up with his mucilage-ray when the show
 ended.

 And you're stuck cleaning the Pfaltzgraff while Cap'n and Billy Bob
 fight for their lives.

 Life's not fair when you're eight.

 Kitchen
    You've spent many an hour at the kitchen sink, elbow-deep in suds,
 staring out the window.  Add this hour to the total, thanks to mom and
 her speech about familial responsibility.  At least she isn't making
 you wipe down the cabinets again.  A dismayingly large stack of dirty
 plates towers on one side of the sink, balanced by a much smaller stack
 of clean plates on the other side.  Next to the east doorway is the
 avocado-green refrigerator your family has owned forever.

>wash dishes
 You pull, freeing the top plate from the gummy, foody stack with a wet
 slurping sound.  One quick dip in the suds, one quick rinse from the
 faucet, and you toss the plate on the "clean" stack.  The clean stack,
 in return, shimmies a bit.  You keep piling slick clean dishes on that
 stack and, chances are, you'll soon have dish pieces on your hands.

>examine window
 The window may have been clear once, but your mom's gleeful use of oil
 while cooking has added a dirty yellow glaze, making it hard to see
 through.

>clean window
 Eww, gross.  That oil'd coat your hands more or less permanently.

>examine fridge
 Everything in the kitchen used to be the same pukey-green color as the
 fridge.  Thankfully, all that other stuff was replaced.  Too bad the
 fridge still works, or you wouldn't ever have to see that color again.
 Mom has covered up as much of the fridge as she could with some of your
 artwork from class.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>open fridge
 Nuh-uh.  You mess around in there and you won't get to see Captain
 Dangerous' adventures for the rest of your life, maybe longer.

>examine artwork
 Just some stuff you drew for class.  No big deal.  Though you did get
 an A+ on the big blue swirly one.

>examine sink
 The discolored porcelain sink is filled with suds.  To its right is a
 stack of dirty dishes; to its left, a stack of clean dishes.

>examine cupboard
 I never learned the word "cupboard" in school.

>put away clean dishes
 I never learned the word "away" in school.

>wash dishes
 You pull, freeing the top plate from the gummy, foody stack with a wet
 slurping sound.  One quick dip in the suds, one quick rinse from the
 faucet, and you toss the plate on the "clean" stack.

>again
 You pull, freeing the top plate from the gummy, foody stack with a wet
 slurping sound.  One quick dip in the suds, one quick rinse from the
 faucet, and you toss the plate on the "clean" stack.

>again
 You pull, freeing the top plate from the gummy, foody stack with a wet
 slurping sound.  One quick dip in the suds, one quick rinse from the
 faucet, and you toss the plate on the "clean" stack.  As you do, the
 clean stack of dishes wobbles for a moment before settling down.  You
 could probably get that stack dancing if you wanted.

 A gleam out the window, a faux star, grows brighter and brighter.  You
 pull yourself up on the edge of the sink, soaking your elbows.  The
 gleam is a glow, is a streak, is a flame which is rocketing into your
 backyard and WHAM onto the ground.  You reflexively blink, the flash
 brighter than the one on that camera dad lugs around everywhere.  When
 you can see again, there is a silvery ship in the backyard.

 A ship!  Oh man oh man, it must be a spaceship!  From outer space!
 Maybe from Gamma Proxima Epsilon Centauri Five B!  Forget the
 dishes--this is way too cool to ignore.

 Kitchen
    You've spent many an hour at the kitchen sink, elbow-deep in suds,
 staring out the window, ignoring the ugly appliances and dirty
 cabinets.  A dismayingly large stack of dirty plates towers on one side
 of the sink, balanced by a much smaller stack of clean plates on the
 other side.  Next to the east doorway is the avocado-green refrigerator
 your family has owned forever.

>go east
 Hallway
    A short hall lined with dark wood panelling.  It connects the
 kitchen, to the west, with the living room, to the east.  The backyard
 is north of here.

>go north
 Backyard
    Normally the backyard is boring, but not tonight!  Tonight the lawn
 has been crisped by the arrival of the silvery ship.  It sits there,
 gleaming under the bright backyard lights your dad installed a while
 back.  Its shadow stretches across the brick patio and Weber grill.
 Your house is to the south.

>examine ship
 It's much, much cooler close up.  The surface is all crinkly and
 silvery.  The top and bottom are flat; the sides angle out, then back
 in, and are ruffled.  On its back are two bumper stickers.

>examine stickers
 left bumper sticker:  The left sticker reads, "Speed Kills!  .55c Saves
 Lives."
 right bumper sticker:  The right bumper sticker reads, "My Other Saucer
 Is A Porsche."

 Backyard
    Normally the backyard is boring, but not tonight!  Tonight the lawn
 has been crisped by the arrival of the silvery ship.  It sits there,
 gleaming under the bright backyard lights your dad installed a while
 back.  Its shadow stretches across the brick patio and Weber grill.
 Your house is to the south.

 With the sound of a thousand cats yowling a thousand different songs, a
 piece of the saucer lowers, forming a ramp.  For a few seconds, the
 only things coming out of the ship are gouts of white gas which quickly
 dissipate.

 Then the aliens step forth.

 Full of might and majesty, two shapes drift down the ramp and onto the
 zoysia grass.  One is purple and cylindrical, with several tentacles
 dangling.  The other is green and much more blobby, though he too is
 be-tentacled.

 The purple alien squints for a moment at the bright lights, then
 produces a small box with a rotating antenna on it.  He punches some
 buttons on the box.  It responds with bleeps and blips.  The purple one
 nods and puts the box away.  "Scan for life signs in immediate vicinity
 complete.  Two adults, one child, no tabloid reporters found."

 "Good," the green one says.  "We now must--" He stops, staring right at
 you.  You blink.

 "Zigurt," the purple alien says to the green one.  His voice is thick
 with worry.

 "Shh," the green alien replies.  "I am cogitating."

 "Ziiiiiguuurt," the purple alien whines.

 "Shh!"

 "But ZIIiiIIiiIIiiguuuurt, the child can see us!  Why is that?"  The
 purple alien turns to the green one, filling the air with his flailing
 tentacles.  "You said the neurotron would prevent our detection.  You
 said that this would be a slight wind, that this would be without
 difficulty!"

 "Silence, Floban."  The purple alien falls quiet.  "We will unravel
 this conundrum in due time.  For now, I have closed the child's avenue
 of retreat."  You spin around--sure enough, a curtain of energy has
 sprung up between you and your house.

>enter ship
 The aliens move to block you.

 The two aliens begin whispering back and forth.  "Obviously the child
 is the Ambassador Plenipotentiary for this planet."

 "A child?"

 "Certainly.  The Zufans' intelligence, while fearful in their young,
 diminishes with age.  All of their civil servants are children.  Why
 not with Terrans?  Have you not seen the their `sit-coms,' in which the
 children are all-knowing and their elders impotent fools?"

 "Fine, fine, fine.  But can the child understand us?"  Zigurt responds
 by displaying a plain metal rod.  "Ah, yes.  I had forgotten of the
 translator."

>talk to aliens
 I never learned the word "talk" in school.

>Zigurt, hell
 I never learned the word "hell" in school.

>Zigurt, hello
 "Kindly hold your tongue until we have decided your fate."

 Zigurt makes a sound like that of gravel being crushed underfoot.
 "Floban, would this not be an opportune time to present our demands to
 the Ambassador?"

 Floban looks hurt.  "I was preparing the list mentally," he says
 truculently.  "There is no need for you to clear your esophageal
 passages at me.

 "Human child!"  The latter is directed at you, making you jump.  Floban
 moves forward, looming ominously.  "We are here on behalf of all
 spacefaring races who must cope with the mess your species is making.
 Must you shout your news across all radio frequencies?"

 "Mmm, Floban," says Zigurt.

 "Must I hear of your puny world wars?  Must I deal with the endless
 chatter of a semi-sentient race?  Must you flood the universe with your
 `top-ten lists' and `buzz clips'?"

 "What about our demands, Floban?"

 "Must I sully the tips of my tentacles by dipping them in the muck of
 this world?  Must I stop your stupid, stupid development of Solarnite?
 Must I spend more time on a backwards planet, educating the--"

 "FLOBAN!  FOOD!"

 Floban winces.  "Not so loud," he hisses to Zigurt.  "One moment,
 please, Ambassador," he says to you as he rolls back to Zigurt.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Zigurt and Floban have a hurried, whispered discussion.  Finally,
 Zigurt moves closer to you.  "Our trip has been a long one, and we are
 in need of sustenance.  You will bring us rock salt, so that we might
 de-hydrate."

 "And some Ho-Hos," Floban interjects hopefully.

 Zigurt glares at Floban.  Finally, grudgingly, he adds, "And some
 Ho-Hos.  You will--"

 "And a memento!"  says Floban.

 This silence lasts longer than the previous one.  Slowly Zigurt swivels
 around to stare at Floban.  "A...memento?"  he asks.

 "Oh, my, yes!  The preliminary scan--" he waves around the small box
 you saw before, "--showed a high concentration of mementos somewhere
 within the domicile.  We should obtain...one to...add..."  Floban's
 words trail off under Zigurt's glare.

 Zigurt sighs before turning back to you.  "Bring us rock salt, some
 Ho-Hos," he pauses and glares again at Floban, who ducks his head, "and
 a memento.  You will bring them to our skrrbtz..."  Zigurt frowns,
 shakes the translator.  "Enter our fzzgt..."  His frown is deeper this
 time.  "Our gblzzt..."  He waves his tentacles, distressed.
 "`Universal translator' my anterior appendage!" he shouts.

 "Please, not so loud!"  Floban brings out an open white bottle and pops
 a pill from it.  "I am experiencing a horrendous headache.  If you
 would but wait a moment."  From somewhere he finds a large book, which
 he consults.  "The word you want is `sheep'."

 Zigurt pauses, rolling the strange word around in his mouth, tasting
 its sounds.  "Bring the rock salt, Ho-Hos, and memento to our sheep.
 We will wait."

>examine grill
 Roundish, red, with three legs and wheels.  Occasionally dad uses it to
 flash-burn meat into flaky, charcoal lumps.

 Zigurt and Floban drift back up the ramp.  When they are near the top,
 they stop.  "Oh, and tell your world governments' spacefarers to clean
 up after themselves in orbit," Zigurt says.

 "Yeah, especially that Mir."

 Zigurt negligently waves a tentacle, making the curtain of energy
 vanish, and the two aliens disappear into their ship.

>open grill
 No thanks.  Last time dad cooked something in it, it almost exploded
 from all the lighter fluid.  If you open it and get soot all over you,
 you'll probably have to clean it.

>go south
 Hallway
    A short hall lined with dark wood panelling.  It connects the
 kitchen, to the west, with the living room, to the east.  The backyard
 is north of here.

>go east
 Lived-in Room
    The living room is the rumpled center of your home.  Comfy floral
 furniture, a few shelves filled with knick-knacks, a window, two
 parents, and a TV.  The hallway to the kitchen is west, and the
 unimportant rest of your home (mentioned here merely for the sake of
 completeness) is south.
    Mom is here, knitting away.
    Dad is slowly going through today's paper.

 Mom says, "You better be done with those dishes, kid," and smiles.

>examine knick-knacks
 Collectibles out the wazoo.  Well, out the shelves.  Hummel figurines,
 Franklin Mint plates, even a bunch of plastic smurfs.  One entire shelf
 is filled with Precious Moments dolls, all of them staring at you with
 wide eyes, exuding eerie cuteness.

>take all
 I don't see what you're referring to.

>take doll
 Mom glances at you.  "Leave that stuff alone, kid."

>take smurf
 Mom glances at you.  "Leave that stuff alone, kid."

    Dad is slowly going through today's paper.

>go south
 That part of your house is so unimportant right now that it hasn't been
 implemented.  Don't you read the long descriptions of rooms?

>examine dad
 Dad is poring over the paper, reading and re-reading every article,
 occasionally circling misspellings and misprints.

>examine mom
 She's relaxing, quietly knitting to pass the time.

 You hear your dad rustling his newspaper.  When you look over at him,
 you see that he's crumpled part of it into a saucer-like shape.  Mom
 sees it too; she says, "Dad?  Whatcha got?"

 "I...I don't know," he answers, "but...it means something."

 "Oh, hush," mom scolds him.  "That doesn't mean anything."

 Dad thinks, then sends the paper saucer flying towards the trash.  "I
 guess you're right," he says before he starts reading again.

>take paper saucer
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>look in trash
 I never learned the word "trash" in school.

>examine paper saucer
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine trash
 I never learned the word "trash" in school.

>examine saucer
 I don't see no--I mean any--saucer here.

>examine tv
 The TV sits there, completely silent.  It's not natural, I tell you.
 Behind that blank screen the adventures of Captain Dangerous and Billy
 Bob are going on, and you're missing them!

>ask mom about ho-hos
 Mom sighs.  "I wish we could afford Ho-hos.  But you know how expensive
 brand-name snack cakes are."

>ask dad about rock salt
 Mom says, "Don't pester your dad with questions while he's reading."

>ask mom about rock salt
 "In the kitchen cabinets, like always," mom tells you.

>ask mom about memento
 "Not now, kid."

>tell mom about ship
 Your dad grunts as he rises from his chair.  "Okay, kid, let's take a
 look."  He gazes out the window for a moment, then sits heavily back
 down in his chair, shaking his head at your mom.

 "Oh, kid," mom says laughingly.  "I know you don't want to wash dishes,
 but we all have to do our part.  All three of us have familial
 responsibilities.  Now get back in there."  She gives you a playful
 swat on the butt.

 of the sink, balanced by a much smaller stack of clean plates on the
 other side.  Next to the east doorway is the avocado-green refrigerator
 your family has owned forever.

>examine cabinets
 Closed pressboard cabinets.  From time to time, mom makes you sponge
 them down to remove the oily residue that builds up on them.

>open cabinets
 Opening the cabinets reveals a can of rock salt, a box of generic
 cupcakes, and some other stuff.

>take rock salt
 Taken.

>examine cupcakes
 That Hostess stuff is too expensive--all mom will buy you are these
 cheap knock-offs.

 Silvery Hallway
    The silvery hallway splits into five branches, like the inside of
 some mutant cauliflower.  The branches lead north, northeast,
 northwest, southeast, and southwest.  Behind you, the ramp flops out
 onto the backyard.  A strange metal plate is attached to the wall by
 the ramp.

>examine plate
 The plate is shinier than the rest of the surrounding wall, as if
 rubbed by countless tentacles (tentacli?).

 A whispering of voices runs lightly through your mind, then fades away
 when you stop touching the plate.

    Curving control consoles, all just taller than you, line the
 underneath of the viewport.  There are no chairs, no creature
 comforts--just austere controls and an exit to the south.

>go northeast
 Slumber Chamber
    The room is several degrees colder than the hallway to the
 southwest, a chill which leaves your breath diaphanous in front of you.
 Ovoids the size of small couches lie scattered about.

>examine ovoids
 The ovoids must be sleep pods, given their frosted windows and
 sleep-podish appearance.

>get in pod
 Good luck getting in the sleep pods while they're closed.

>open pod
 The pods open reluctantly and with a hiss.

>get in pod
 Gingerly you lower yourself into a pod.  You have to wiggle around a
 bit before you're comfortable, but soon enough you're settled.

 All that shifting and squirming must have started the pod's lid to
 closing, though.  You look up just as the lid snicks into place.

 You thump your fists against the lid, hard at first, then weaker and
 weaker as the gas filling the pod puts you to sleep.

 * * * * *

 You blink away the crusty sleep which fills your eyes.  Above you,
 Zigurt and Floban peer at you in surprise.

 "Ambassador!"  Zigurt says as he helps you out of the pod.  "We had no
 idea you were on board with us!"

 "But what a wonderful happenstance!"  Floban says.  "We cannot return
 you to your world, since the V'lvxnlxiaforming of Terra is nearly
 complete."  He looks sad for a moment, pausing in sympathy.  "But!"  he
 says, brightening, "The nobles of V'lvxnlxia will no doubt find you
 amusing, and suffer you to live."

 "Say, Floban."  Floban turns to look at Zigurt, who is now holding a
 small barrel organ.  "If you can learn to play this instrument, no
 doubt the Ambassador's performances will be more entertaining."

 "Splendid!"

 Rec Room
    The rec room is surprisingly empty, its only features a slanted
 ledge on one wall and a counter jutting from another.  Across from the
 ledge is the southeast exit.
    Sitting on the low-slung counter is a white bottle, a universal
 translator, and a large book.  The slanted ledge seems to contain a
 road atlas.
    Zigurt is carefully poring over the atlas.
    Floban stands next to Zigurt, watching him and the maps.

 Floban nods in your direction.  "Ambassador," he says.

    Zigurt is carefully poring over the atlas.
    Floban stands next to Zigurt, watching him and the maps.

>examine bottle
 The white bottle is about three inches tall.  Its lid has been removed.
 The inside of the bottle is crammed full of white pills.

>examine road atlas
 The atlas lies open to a map of the USA.

>examine book
 Large and, strangely enough, bound in leather.  Stamped on its cover
 are the words, "To Serve Man."  Someone has made a feeble attempt to
 obliterate "Serve" and replace it with "Understand".

 Zigurt traces some routes on the atlas with one tentacle.  "We shall
 follow this `Interstate' until it reaches Washington, D.C., at which
 point we will meet with the leader of this country," he says to Floban.

 "Oh, capital!"  Floban replies.

>examine bottle
 The white bottle is about three inches tall.  Its lid has been removed.
 The inside of the bottle is crammed full of white pills.

>examine pills
 Little.  White.  Similar.

 Floban massages his forehead with one tentacle, picking up the white
 bottle with another.  He sticks a third tentacle into the bottle.  When
 he pulls it back out, a pill is stuck to the end of it.  He pops the
 pill in his mouth, then puts the bottle back on the counter.

>take pill
 "Winners don't use drugs."
        --This message brought to you by the director of the FBI.

>take bottle
 A tentacle darts out, thumping your hand and making it sting.  "That is
 not polite," Floban says.

>give cupcakes to floban
 Floban takes the box from you, looking at it.  "Redi-Snak(TM) Chokolate
 Snak Kakes?"  He sighs.  "I suppose they will do."

 "Now we need rock salt and a memento.  If you would, please, run along
 now."  Floban, meanwhile, has wolfed down two or three cupcakes,
 leaving his face smeared with chocolate which he tries to lick off with
 a large blue tongue.  "You are such a mess," Zigurt tells him as they
 turn back to the atlas.

>give rock salt to floban
 "Is it salt?"  Floban asks eagerly.  When he spies the box, he claps
 several tentacles together happily while scooping up some crystals with
 another.  "Wonn-ful," he says around a mouthful of salt.  Zigurt upends
 the box and fills his maw.  The contented sound of crunching fills the
 air.

 "Aww we need now is the memento," Zigurt announces, peppering you with
 some bits of salt.  "Wun awong and fwetch them."  Zigurt and Floban
 turn back to the atlas, munching happily.

 Zigurt says, "The fractured nature of this planet never ceases to amaze
 me.  Compare the size of this `China' nation to `Luxembourg'.  The
 disparity is overwhelming."

 "Indeed."

>ask zigurt about memento
 "You are quite the nosy child."

>examine translator
 The universal translator is a metallic silver rod about the length of
 your forearm and almost as thick around.  It is currently turned on.
 There is a button on its side labelled in an alien script.

>examine button
 A button on the side of the universal translator.

 Floban massages his forehead with one tentacle, picking up the white
 bottle with another.  He sticks a third tentacle into the bottle.  When

 pill in his mouth, then puts the bottle back on the counter.

 Ship's Hold
    In sharp contrast to what you've seen of the rest of the ship, this
 room is filthy.  Junk piles up in corners, spilling out over the floor,
 claiming most of the room.  It's as if Zigurt and Floban had thrown
 every bauble which had ever caught their eye into this room without
 regard for order or the boundaries of good taste.  Indeed, most things
 you see lie squarely on the far side of tasteful.  Somewhere in the
 midst of the junk is the northwest exit.

>examine junk
 The amount of junk thrown down here is astounding.  There's no telling
 what you could find with a bit of work.

 A hollow stick filled with beads and capped at both ends.  When turned,
 the beads slide down the stick and make a sound that is kinda like the
 sound of falling rain.

 The stress ball is quite deformed from people squeezing it.

 The King, captured in all his glory by a simple piece of mounted
 velvet.  Stunning.

 You have a salad shooter, a red lid, a velvet Elvis, a rain stick, a

 The salad shooter might once have chopped up vegetables and more for a
 mighty fine salad, but someone has removed all of its blades, rendering
 it useless.

    Floban stands next to Zigurt, watching him and the maps.

>put red lid on white bottle
 A tentacle darts out, thumping your hand vigorously.  "Most definitely
 do not do that," Floban says while you rub your smarting hand.

 Floban waves away the velvet Elvis.  "Your trinkets are of no concern
 right now," he tells you.

 Silvery Hallway
    The silvery hallway splits into five branches, like the inside of
 some mutant cauliflower.  The branches lead north, northeast,
 northwest, southeast, and southwest.  Behind you, the ramp flops out
 onto the backyard.  A strange metal plate is attached to the wall by
 the ramp.

 Examination Room
    Stark.  Metal.  An examination table fills the center of the room.
 Above it crouch various tools on metal appendages, extended like the
 legs of some insect.  Along one wall is a control panel.  The exit is
 to the northeast.

>examine probe
 I never learned the word "probe" in school.

 The panel is low enough that you can see a dizzying array of levers,
 knobs, and switches, but you can't see any labels, if there are any.

 You can begin to guess at some of the tools' functions--the
 brightly-shining light is familiar, reminding you of visits to the
 dentist.  Other tools, however, are too strange for your puny Earth
 brain.

 You flip a switch at random.  The table shudders, as if trying to do

 surface, and retracts once more.

 You yank on a lever.  There is a loud keening sound as a laser beam

 the middle of the table before shutting off again.

 You yank on a lever.  An energy field flicks into brief existence

 Silvery Hallway

 northwest, southeast, and southwest.  Behind you, the ramp flops out
 onto the backyard.  A strange metal plate is attached to the wall by
 the ramp.

>push plate
 You feel the odd sensation of a thousand whispery filaments drawn
 lightly across your mind.  The smell of oranges fills your nose, and a
 voice in your head says, Non-V'lvxnlxian intelligence detected.
 Attempting to render information in comprehensible manner.  The voice
 goes away for a moment, then returns.  It has changed, and is now oddly
 familiar.  "Contacting host www.aliencomputer.com...done."  Symbols and
 colors fill your vision, all incomprehensible.  Then everything goes
 dark for a moment.








 Welcome to Scout 3LZ, a representative of the glorious V'lvxnlxian
 empire!


 Scout 3LZ is one of the newer, faster Cuppa model scout ships.  It
 incorporates new technology from the Waveparticle Duality Consortium.
 As a result, Cuppa model scouts boast an extremely short transit time
 between solar systems and high atmospheric maneuverability.

 Scout 3LZ carries a crew of two: Zigurt and Floban.  Both are native
 V'lvxnlxians, and both have had long and illustrious careers with the
 Corps.  They are currently enjoying their tour through one of the
 lesser-explored arms of the galaxy, though they hope to find potential
 colony sites soon.


 What kind of colony sites does the Corps look for?  Corps personnel are
 experienced planetologists who have an eye for comfort.  They report on
 only the best planets, ones which are within 98% of V'lvxnlxia norms.
 Though many different biospheres are acceptable, planets with dry
 climates and dim suns are a must.


 Corps personnel are also skilled negotiators and diplomats, in case a
 potential colony planet possesses a native race.  A certain amount of
 intelligence is welcome in natives, as smarter natives are more capable
 of following orders.  However, should a native population be found to
 possess intelligence above a 5.9 on the L'xlvnxl scale, the planet may
 require a quick bio-scrubbing.


 For your convenience while on-board, a temporary overlay map of the
 ship will be downloaded and installed.  For visitors who are unable to
 handle a fully interactive overlay map, a hardcopy will be created for
 them.








 When you can see normally again, you find that you now possess a map of
 the ship.

>examine map
 The map shows the innards of the spaceship.  According to it, the
 bridge lies to the north of the silver hallway, the rec room is
 northwest of the hallway, the slumber chamber is northeast, the exam
 room is southwest, and the hold is southeast from the hallway.

>go south
 Backyard
    Normally the backyard is boring, but not tonight!  Tonight the lawn
 has been crisped by the arrival of the silvery ship.  It sits there,
 ramp down, gleaming under the bright backyard lights your dad installed
 a while back.  Its shadow stretches across the brick patio and Weber
 grill.  Your house is to the south.

 Lived-in Room
    The living room is the rumpled center of your home.  Comfy floral
 furniture, a few shelves filled with knick-knacks, a window, two
 parents, and a TV.  The hallway to the kitchen is west, and the
 unimportant rest of your home (mentioned here merely for the sake of
 completeness) is south.
    Mom is here, knitting away.
    Dad is slowly going through today's paper.

 Kitchen
    You've spent many an hour at the kitchen sink, elbow-deep in suds,
 staring out the window, ignoring the ugly appliances and dirty
 cabinets.  A dismayingly large stack of dirty plates towers on one side
 of the sink, balanced by a much smaller stack of clean plates on the
 other side.  Next to the east doorway is the avocado-green refrigerator
 your family has owned forever.
    The cabinets seems to contain some other stuff.

>hit dishes
 Which dishes do you mean, the stack of clean dishes, or the stack of
 dirty dishes?

>dirty
 Temper, temper.

>push dirty dishes
 Those dirty dishes are way too stuck together for you to be able to
 move them around like that.

>push clean dishes
 You poke at the stack of clean dishes, which begins to sway back and
 forth, back and forth.  You'd think they'd stop, but your house is
 always shaking just the tiniest bit, and that must help keep them
 moving.  They'll probably hit the ground before too much longer.

>open grill
 No thanks.  Last time dad cooked something in it, it almost exploded
 from all the lighter fluid.  If you open it and get soot all over you,
 you'll probably have to clean it.

>turn on grill
 Seeing as how that involves matches and burning and, most importantly,
 opening the grill, you're better off giving this plan a miss.

 Dad spent one summer putting it in.  He got the bricks from an old
 house, so they were covered in mortar.  He offered you ten cents a
 brick to scrape the mortar off--yeah, like you wanted to spend your
 vacation working for the Man.  The Weber is on one side of the patio, a
 free-standing faucet on the other.

>attach hose to faucet
 You screw one end of the hose onto the faucet.

 You turn on the faucet with a twist.  Water begins gushing from the far
 end of the hose.

 You send a jet of water towards the ship.  The water beads on the skin
 of the ship, then rolls down onto the ground.

 It's much, much cooler close up.  The surface is all crinkly and
 silvery.  The top and bottom are flat; the sides angle out, then back
 in, and are ruffled.  On its back are two bumper stickers.  Its ramp
 lies open like a big silver tongue; you can enter to the north.

>examine lights
 Your dad's always adding this and that to the house, trying to improve
 it.  A while back, he added these lights to the backyard, presumably
 because he wanted to show the mosquitos where to gather.  The current
 control for the lights is mounted below them.

>examine control
 It's just a knob to control how bright the lights get.  Right now it's
 turned counterclockwise.

>turn knob
 You can turn the knob clockwise or counterclockwise.

>turn knob clockwise
 You twist the current control all the way clockwise.  The lights
 brighten to the point that the backyard is more lit up than it is
 during the day.

 It's too far away.

 Backyard
    Normally the backyard is boring, but not tonight!  Tonight the lawn

 grill.  Your house is to the south.

>go south
 Not until you either drop the hose or you detach it from the faucet.

>drop hose
 Dropped.

 You are startled to see Zigurt come down the ramp, squinting and wiping
 away tears.  Floban follows him, waving his tentacles about madly.
 "What did I tell you?  The light out here has become unbearable.  How
 do you expect me to concentrate on our plans with the sound of so many
 photons bombarding our ship's repulso-field?"

 "Your point is taken," Zigurt replies thoughtfully.  He brings out a
 large ray gun, complete with flanges and doohickeys.  He braces its
 barrel against one tentacle and fires at the lights.  With a FZOOM! a
 shower of sparks falls from a nearby tree.

 In response, Zigurt clears his throat and wipes his tearing eyes once
 more.  "Somewhat...tricky..."  he mutters, taking aim once more.
 FZOOM! and more sparks fly from the tree, followed by a very put-out
 flock of nesting birds.

 Zigurt is drawing a bead on the lights once more when something hits
 one of them and breaks it with a quiet tinkle.  In the reduced glare,
 both you and Zigurt turn to look at Floban, who has dropped a
 tentaclefull of medium-sized rocks.  "Not for nothing was I on the
 All-Solar team at the Academy," he says with a touch of pride.

 "Indeed," says Zigurt as both cautiously detour around the
 water-spewing hose and re-enter the ship.

    Dad is slowly going through today's paper.
    Mom is walking down the hall towards the living room.

 Mom looks at you angrily.  You duck your head and scuffle one foot
 against the floor.  "You know better than to run away and hide when
 you've done something wrong," she says.  You turn beet red.  "To your
 room, kid."  When she talks to you in that tone of voice, you know
 better than to disobey.  Up the stairs you go, to await your eventual
 punishment.

 Of course, none of this matters much since the world ends some hours
 later.
