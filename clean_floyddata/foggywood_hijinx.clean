 Poor Uncle Foggy.  He was the best guardian any kid could ever ask for.
 After your parents died in that freak waterbed accident, Uncle Foggy
 practically raised you and your twin sister Winnie.  You grew up in his
 home full of wacky inventions - practical jokes for all occasions.
 Uncle Foggy was a prankster, no two ways about it.  It's only been a
 couple of years since you and Winnie left for college.  Since then
 you've spoken far too infrequently.  When you last spoke, Uncle Foggy
 rambled on and on about some ultimate practical joke, but you had a
 class on gallinaceous theology to get to.

 You and Winnie pull in to Foggywood Estate in your beaten-up coupe.
 The white picket gate swings quietly shut behind you as you kill the
 engine.  Unfortunately your relatives, the Barnevelders from Rhode
 Island, have also just arrived.  Uncle Orpington and Aunt Lamona are
 just climbing out of their gleaming black sedan, while your cousin
 'Red' sits in his ridiculous monster truck and leans on the horn, which
 blares an ear splitting rendition of 'La Cucharacha.'

 Not a very auspicious way to kick off the reading of Uncle Foggy's
 will, is it?

 Front Lawn
 Uncle Foggy's front lawn teeters just on the border of ill-kempt,
 though no one specific flaw draws attention.  The three vehicles parked
 on the lawn fail to aid its appearance.  Uncle Foggy's home, Foggywood
 Manor, lies to the north, while the gate through which you entered
 rests back to the south.  Though you can't see it over the hedges, you
 know that beyond the gate and across the road lies the ramshackle cabin
 that Uncle Foggy called his lab.

 The Barnevelders are here, standing by the front door with you and
 Winnie.

>fhtest
 Saved.

 Restored.

 Front Lawn
 Uncle Foggy's front lawn teeters just on the border of ill-kempt,
 though no one specific flaw draws attention.  The three vehicles parked
 on the lawn fail to aid its appearance.  Uncle Foggy's home, Foggywood
 Manor, lies to the north, while the gate through which you entered
 rests back to the south.  Though you can't see it over the hedges, you
 know that beyond the gate and across the road lies the ramshackle cabin
 that Uncle Foggy called his lab.

 The Barnevelders are here, standing by the front door with you and
 Winnie.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

 The Barnevelders glare haughtily at you and Winnie as you all wait for
 admittance to Uncle Foggy's house.  Not a word passes between the two
 factions. So far as you know, the Barnevelders have never even visited
 Foggywood before.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

 None too soon, the front door is opened, revealing Mr.  Dorkings, Uncle
 Foggy's solicitor.  A dour man in black who rarely smiles, you've never
 quite trusted Dorkings.

 "Mm," is all Dorkings has to say in greeting.  "You've all arrived.
 Good.  We can begin right away.  Please follow me."

>examine winnie
 Your sister Wyandotte 'Winnie' Langshan has been your steady companion
 since birth.  The two of you have never been separated, and share an
 almost psychic bond.

 You and your relatives dutifully troop into the house after Dorkings.

 Foyer
 Uncle Foggy's foyer is tastefully decorated, even if the blue hen
 wallpaper does seem a bit queer.  Passages from the foyer lead off in
 many directions, but your only business here today is in the study to
 the east.  The walls are adorned with glossy photos taken around Uncle
 Foggy's favorite travel destination.  Nailed to a chest-high post is a
 stuffed bird, eternally caught in its morning salutation to the sun.

 The Barnevelders are here, waiting to be admitted into the study with
 you and Winnie.

 "We will be adjourning in the study for the reading of...  " He breaks
 off in mid-sentence and cocks his head towards the study.  You listen
 carefully, and hear what sounds like polite applause.  Dorkings turns
 back to all of you and says, "Mm.  Please wait here while I ensure that
 all is in readiness," before disappearing into the study.

 Odd, you think.  Knowing Dorkings, he would have checked and double
 checked everything long before your arrival.

>examine dorkings
 I don't see any dorkings here.

>examine photos
 Lush photos of the Sun Pyramid taken around Chi-chen Itza.  Uncle Foggy
 claimed to have held great admiration for the builders of the pyramid.

 After a brief moment you hear rising voices.  Well, one voice anyway.
 Dorkings' tone never rises or falls, but the other voice sounds like...

 Mrs.  Faverolles, the cook, storms out of the study, slamming the door
 against the wall.  You can see from her complexion that she's at full
 broil.  Ignoring your party, she whirls around and hurls a string of
 incomprehensible French epithets towards the study, waving a sauce
 spattered spoon in one hammy fist.  Her other hand clenches a saucepan
 full of some rich burgundy sauce.

>examine sauce
 It's full of some rich, burgundy colored sauce.

 Mrs.  Faverolles storms off toward the kitchen, still raging.  Once the
 noise of her passage has quieted, Dorkings gestures your party into the
 study.

 You and your relatives shuffle inside and take seats at opposite sides
 of the room.  You and Winnie fill out the love seat, while the
 Barnevelders perch like chicken hawks on the matching sofa.

 Study
 Light from the outside streams in through the closed window,
 illuminating Uncle Foggy's comfortably cluttered study.  It's full of
 interesting odds and ends, not the least of which is the trophy mounted
 on the wall above the desk.  Many were the times that you and Winnie
 would climb the bookshelves in search of written treasure, and then
 spread out by the fireplace with your latest finds.  For more dexterous
 pleasures, there was the carton of assorted works in progress Uncle
 Foggy usually kept beneath his desk.  If nothing else appealed,
 sneaking maraschino cherries from the bar was always good for a few
 giggles.

 The Barnevelders are here, seated on the couch across from you and
 Winnie, while Mr.  Dorkings stands beside the desk.

 You notice that an integrated television/video player has been set up
 on Uncle Foggy's desk, about where Uncle Foggy would be if he were
 presiding.

>examine bird
 I don't see any bird here.

>examine trophy
 The Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending) is an enormous, furry buffalo
 head with thick horns mounted as far apart as a broad man's shoulders.
 As you know, it rests on a tightly coiled spring, and launches forward
 at the touch of a button hidden on the desk.  Uncle Foggy favored using
 the device on unsolicited salesmen and IRS auditors.  He would seat
 them before the desk, wait until they were deeply engrossed in
 business, and then...  SPROI-OI-OING!  The huge head would lunge
 towards them at high velocity while Uncle Foggy screamed, "It's still
 alive!  Run!  For the love of God, RUN!"  Then he'd cackle hysterically
 as they tripped over themselves in their rush for the door.  Needless
 to say, victims of this prank rarely returned.

 "Just a moment more.  Mm," says Dorkings, as he turns to the
 television.  Your mind wanders, and you find yourself focusing on the
 Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending) mounted on the wall behind Uncle
 Foggy's desk.  It was one of Uncle Foggy's funniest inventions, a
 terrific source of amusement.  Well, for everyone but the unlucky
 victims, anyway.

>examine dorkings
 Dorkings was Uncle Foggy's solicitor.  A dour man in black who rarely
 smiles, you've never quite trusted him.

 "Mm, here we are."  Dorkings steps aside as the television springs to
 life.  And there on the screen, real as life but only half as dead, is
 Uncle Foggy.

 "Greetin's, family," begins your deceased uncle.  "Ah suppose, Ah say,
 Ah suppose you're all wondering why Ah've gathered you here today."
 Uncle Foggy pauses for an expectant moment, while the Barnevelders
 glare dispassionately.  Winnie rolls her eyes, though at Uncle Foggy or
 the Barnevelders, you're not sure.  "Haw haw!  It's a joke, son!  Ah
 made a funny!  Get it?  Ah'm too fast for you!  Gotta keep up, son!"

>press button
 You can't reach that from the love seat.

>get up
 It would be disrespectful to go wandering before the reading is over.

 "As you all know, Ah've made, Ah say, Ah've made a bunch of dough -
 that's SAWbucks, boy - off my inventions.  Now Ah've gotta figure out
 who gets it."  Uncle Foggy stares out of the screen for a moment before
 continuing.  "Well Ah won't do it, y'hear!  Never was any good at this
 family stuff, and Ah'm not going to start playing favorites now.
 Instead, Ah'm leavin' it, Ah say, Ah'm leavin' it up to you all!"  You
 and Winnie and the Barnevelders exchange quizzical glances, but no one
 speaks.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Uncle Foggy rolls on.  "What Ah propose, Ah say what Ah PROPOSE is a
 challenge. And the ones who best know me and my ways, well, they're
 gonna come out ahead."

 Uncle Orpington leaps angrily to his feet and shouts, "What new
 foolishness is this!"  Aunt Lamona spears him with a withering glance,
 and he reluctantly reseats himself.

 "Now Orpy, by now Ah expect you're gettin' pretty riled up," says Uncle
 Foggy with frightening prescience.  "Well them's the breaks!  The
 breaks, Ah say!  Maybe if you'd ever taken favor on my work, things'd
 be different now."

>listen
 You hear nothing out of the ordinary.

 "Contest goes like, Ah say, contest goes like this!  Ah've scattered
 ten of my inventions around, Ah say, all 'round my estate.  Dorkings
 here will give you all a list.  The one o' you who finds the most
 number of things on the list gets it, Ah say gets it ALL!  The house,
 the money, and most importantly...  Dorkings?  Ain't you ready yet,
 suh?"

 "Ah, mm.  Yes."  Dorkings retrieves a black shammy sack from the desk
 and loosens the cord binding it shut.  Reaching inside, he pulls out a
 matte black pyramidal object with a small switch at its apex.  You jerk
 instinctively as Dorkings fumbles with the strange object.  Everything
 slows as you watch it tumble to the ground with inexplicable dread.  It
 lands on the shag rug with a faint but sickening 'click.'

 Suddenly the world seems larger.  You look to Winnie for help only to
 find...  a chicken!  Staring back at you is a perfectly normal white
 crested hen!  You look around.  Oh, no.  Where once stood Mr.  Dorkings
 and your relations, now you see only chickens.  A long moment of
 stunned silence follows, as the room's occupants glance around
 nervously at each other.

 The silence is broken by Uncle Foggy's booming voice.  "You got it yet
 Dorkings?  Good.  Now, what you got here is my latest invention.  The
 ultimate, Ah say, the ULTIMATE practical joke!  Great at parties!
 It'll make a million, if my name isn't Fogarth Barnevelder!  And the
 one of you all to bring back the most items on my list, gets it!  And
 that's, Ah say, that's IT!  Dorkings, you can stop this consarned thing
 any time now.  My, Ah say, my job here is done."

 As the implications of the situation sink in, there is a sudden tidal
 swell of panic.  Someone - Aunt Lamona?  Cousin Red?  - leaps from
 their perch and sets up a dreadful squawking.  Soon, the room is full
 of squawking, screaching birds running in panicked circles, feathers
 flying everywhere.

>examine carton
 The greasy, worn carton was Uncle Foggy's hobby box - full of spare
 bits and pieces and small works in progress.  The grubby flaps are
 closed, hiding whatever stray parts Uncle Foggy left behind.

 The cacophany is broken by a sudden click as loud as the hammer of a
 revolver.  Uncle Foggy's tape rolls to a stop and automatically starts
 rewinding.  With the tape's feed gone, the television reverts to
 receiving broadcast signal.  All eyes focus on the television as a
 recognizeable human figure appears, a woman in an apron standing behind
 a counter covered with neatly placed cooking utensils.

 "Thank you, Charles," says Julia Childs.  "Now that our burgundy sauce
 is chilling and the hen's organs have been removed, we can proceed to
 stewing the guts and gizzards."  Suddenly your attention is drawn to a
 furious pounding at the study door.  Oh no - it must be the cook
 wanting to watch her program!

 "SQUAWK!"  The panic renews with increased fury as your crazed
 relatives hurl themselves in shrieking clouds of feathers at every
 surface in the room.  Well, it looks like its up to you and Winnie to
 figure out how to reverse Uncle Foggy's joke.

 On the television, Julia Childs is busy shoving her entire forearm up
 some poor chicken's posterior.  How humiliating!

>open carton
 You can't reach the carton from the love seat.

 Red - at least you think it's Red - clambers up onto the sofa and crows
 at the top of his scrawny little lungs.

 You hop down out of the love seat and flutter to the study floor.

 A gutteral French accent beyond the door can only be Mrs.  Faverolles
 cursing Dorkings for chasing her out of the study during her program.

>open carton
 Opening the carton reveals the Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending).

 Uncle Orpington pecks at the carpet as if looking for worms.

>examine hedge helpers
 The Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) extend a gardener's reach while
 trimming tall hedges.  They clamp on to the shoulders at one end, and
 end in a pair of articulated rubber hands at the other.  The hands
 operate a second pair of shears, mimicking the operator's own hands,
 doubling both his reach and his efficiency.

 The Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) are another of Uncle Foggy's
 inventions.  Being the recluse he was, he liked his hedges TALL.

 Cousin Red mistakenly runs into Aunt Lamona - she raises a great squawk
 and pecks Red viciously in return.

>examine list
 I don't know the word "list".

>take helpers
 You snatch an end of the Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) up in your beak.
 Though quite bulky, they're light enough that you can drag them around
 single...  er...  beakedly.

 "I've never tasted human flesh," says Julia, "but I hear it tastes just
 like Chicken!  Doesn't THAT make you want to pat your tummies and say
 yummy yummy, viewers?"

 Study, on the floor
 Light from the outside streams in through the closed window,
 illuminating Uncle Foggy's comfortably cluttered study.  It's full of
 interesting odds and ends, not the least of which is the trophy mounted
 on the wall above the desk.  Many were the times that you and Winnie
 would climb the bookshelves in search of written treasure, and then
 spread out by the fireplace with your latest finds.  For more dexterous
 pleasures, there was the carton of assorted works in progress Uncle
 Foggy usually kept beneath his desk.  If nothing else appealed,
 sneaking maraschino cherries from the bar was always good for a few
 giggles.

 The room is filled with chickens, running in crazy circles and bounding
 off the furniture and each other.  Resting off to one side of the room
 is Uncle Foggy's ultimate practical joke.

 On the television, an audience member asks Julia if she uses free range
 chickens.  "Free range!"  she shouts cheerfully.  "Gas range is more
 like it!"

 Uncle Foggy's desk is a great monolith of mahogany, with drawers of all
 sizes and shapes on virtually every face.  Even though Uncle Foggy did
 most of his work in his lab, the desk's surface is still scarred from
 his constant tinkering.  As you know, Uncle Foggy usually kept a carton
 of assorted parts beneath the desk for idle moments.  Sitting on the
 center of the desk is a television set.  At one corner, you see Uncle
 Foggy's Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon Dispenser (pat.  pending).

 Your eye is inevitably drawn to the massive Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.
 pending) hanging heavily far up on on the wall overhead which, as you
 know, is activated by a hidden button on the desk.

 Uncle Orpington pecks at the carpet as if looking for worms.

>examine pyramid
 Uncle Foggy's Super Funky Chickenizer (pat.  pending) is a matte black
 pyramid with a small switch at its apex.  You dearly hope Uncle Foggy
 left his development notes, or a reversion device, in his lab across
 the road.

 On the television, Julia Childs is hacking the limbs off some
 unfortunate fowl with a butcher's knife the size of Bayonne, New
 Jersey.

>examine dispenser
 Uncle Foggy often liked to make elaborate balloon animals for favored
 visitors, and the Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon Dispenser (pat.
 pending) is another of his inventions.  It's in the shape of a small
 elephant statuette with raised trunk.  Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal
 Balloons (pat.  pending) are dispensed from the elephant's open mouth.
 Yank out one and another takes its place.

 "Once we're done with our coq au vin," says Julia Childs, "we'll move
 on to a lovely chicken divan recipe."

>take balloon
 You can't reach the Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon (pat.  pending)
 from the floor.

 On the television, Julia Childs sneaks a sip of sherry from a bottle
 beneath the counter.  You hear the word 'cirrhosis' shouted from among
 the audience, to which Julia responds "Oh, pish tosh.  There's nothing
 wrong with MY liver that a little CHICKEN liver won't cure!"

>press button
 You can't reach the hidden button from the floor.

 The terrible pounding resumes briefly as Mrs.  Faverolles makes another
 attempt at the door.

>go up
 You flap your wings edgily, glancing from desk to sill to shelves to
 bar, looking for something to hop up onto.

 A gutteral French accent beyond the door can only be Mrs.  Faverolles
 cursing Dorkings for chasing her out of the study during her program.

>get on desk
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the desk.

 The terrible pounding resumes briefly as Mrs.  Faverolles makes another
 attempt at the door.

>press button
 The Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending) zooms off the wall with a
 resounding SPROI-OI-OING.  Cousin Red, standing in the center of the
 room, leaps with bulging eyes from the path of the charging trophy.
 The trophy jerks to a sudden stop about three feet off the ground, in
 front of the desk.  A moment later, the head snaps back to the wall.

 On the television, Julia Childs leans out into her audience and asks
 conspiratorially, "Do you folks know why the chicken crossed the road?"
 After a moment she answers, "Because it was hauled across in a
 butcher's cart, of course!"  Her joke is met by silence from the
 audience, prompting her to respond cheerily with "Well!  THAT joke sure
 laid an egg!"

>get on bar
 You can't reach that from the desk.

>examine desk
 Uncle Foggy's desk is a great monolith of mahogany, with drawers of all
 sizes and shapes on virtually every face.  Even though Uncle Foggy did
 most of his work in his lab, the desk's surface is still scarred from
 his constant tinkering.  As you know, Uncle Foggy usually kept a carton
 of assorted parts beneath the desk for idle moments.  Sitting on the
 center of the desk is a television set.  At one corner, you see Uncle
 Foggy's Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon Dispenser (pat.  pending).

 Your eye is inevitably drawn to the massive Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.
 pending) hanging heavily far up on on the wall overhead which, as you
 know, is activated by a hidden button on the desk.

 "Thanks for tuning in," says Julia Childs.  "I know you'll just LOVE
 our all day long chicken recipe-athon!"

>go down
 You hop down off of the desk and flutter to the study floor.

 On the television, Julia Childs mercilessly pounds the carcass of some
 poor disemboweled fowl with a - gulp - meat tenderizer.

>get on bar
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the bar.

 On the television, Julia Childs is hacking the limbs off some
 unfortunate fowl with a butcher's knife the size of Bayonne, New
 Jersey.

>examine bar
 Though not a habitual drinker, Uncle Foggy always kept a stocked bar.
 As kids, you and Winnie often had fun sneaking olives and maraschino
 cherries.  However, it looks like all of the condiments, along with the
 booze and glasses, have been locked away.

 Lying on the surface of the bar is one of Uncle Foggy's Rainbow Wacky
 Straws (pat.  pending).

 On the television, Julia Childs coughs up a mouthful of feathers.  "Oh,
 dear!"  she exlaims.  "Excuse me!"

>examine straws
 I don't know the word "straws".

>examine straws
 I don't know the word "straws".

>examine straw
 Another of Uncle Foggy's inventions, the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.
 pending) was developed with you and Winnie in mind.  It's a ludicrously
 long flexible straw that randomly changes the color of liquids that
 pass through it.  You and Winnie used to enjoy drinking Shirley Temples
 from across the room, watching as the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.
 pending) turned the drink from cherry cola red to lime rickey green to
 tang orange.

 "Thanks for tuning in," says Julia Childs.  "I know you'll just LOVE
 our all day long chicken recipe-athon!"

>take straw
 You can only carry one thing at a time in your beak.

 The terrible pounding resumes briefly as Mrs.  Faverolles makes another
 attempt at the door.

>examine shelf
 Tall wooden shelves tower over Uncle Foggy's desk on either side,
 drawing attention to the Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending), mounted
 prominently on the wall between them.  The shelves are crammed with
 books of all ages and subjects, though there's probably little on them
 that hasn't been read by you or Winnie.

 "You know," says Julia as she strips the flesh off some poor dead bird,
 "the thing I like about these Purdue chickens is how nice and easily
 the skins slide off.  I guess it's true what they say.  It really DOES
 take a tough man to make a tender chicken."  Julia's audience laughs
 politely.

>examine window
 A plain, white-framed, four-panel window that looks out on the front
 lawn.  There's a small knot, about the diameter of your fingertip (the
 kind you used to have) at the base of the frame where it meets the
 sill.

 "I once killed a chicken just to watch it die," says Julia Childs.

>examine knot
 It's a small knot just at the very bottom of the frame, about large
 enough to allow a pencil or a pinky finger between the frame and the
 sill.

 Uncle Orpington pulls a long strand of fiber from the carpet.  Cousin
 Red jealously tries to snatch it away, and a tug-of-war ensues.

>stick beak in knot
 I don't know the word "beak".

>peck at knot
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>drop helpers
 Dropped.

 On the television, Julia Childs mercilessly pounds the carcass of some
 poor disemboweled fowl with a - gulp - meat tenderizer.

>take straw
 You snatch the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.  pending) up in your beak like
 a long wriggly worm.

 On the television, Julia Childs sneaks a sip of sherry from a bottle
 beneath the counter.  You hear the word 'cirrhosis' shouted from among
 the audience, to which Julia responds "Oh, pish tosh.  There's nothing
 wrong with MY liver that a little CHICKEN liver won't cure!"

>put straw in knot
 You can't reach that from the bar.

>get on sill
 You can't reach that from the bar.

>go down
 You hop down off of the bar and flutter to the study floor.

 On the television, Julia Childs leans out into her audience and asks
 conspiratorially, "Do you folks know why the chicken crossed the road?"
 After a moment she answers, "Because it was hauled across in a
 butcher's cart, of course!"  Her joke is met by silence from the
 audience, prompting her to respond cheerily with "Well!  THAT joke sure
 laid an egg!"

>get on sill
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the windowsill.

 On the television, Julia Childs is busy shoving her entire forearm up
 some poor chicken's posterior.  How humiliating!

>push knot
 Pushing the knot doesn't do anything.

 "I once killed a chicken just to watch it die," says Julia Childs.

>put straw in knot
 You slide one end of the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.  pending) into the
 knot in the frame.  Unfortunately, it's a loose fit, and the Rainbow
 Wacky Straw (pat.  pending) slides out.

 "You know," says Julia as she strips the flesh off some poor dead bird,
 "the thing I like about these Purdue chickens is how nice and easily
 the skins slide off.  I guess it's true what they say.  It really DOES
 take a tough man to make a tender chicken."  Julia's audience laughs
 politely.

>open window
 It's far too heavy too open by chicken power alone, so you motion
 Winnie over, slam your chicken-twin power-rings together and squawk,
 "Chicken-Twin Power ACTIVATE!"

 Or not.

 (Hint:  that's the puzzle, doofus.)

 Uncle Orpington pecks at the carpet as if looking for worms.

>go down
 You hop down off of the windowsill and flutter to the study floor.

 On the television, Julia Childs cracks an egg into a bowl, whips it
 into a light batter, and then drops eviscerated chicken parts into it.
 "Well," says Julia, "I guess that answers the question of which came
 first!"

>get on shelves
 You slowly, laboriously climb the bookshelf, one shelf at a time, claw
 over beak over claw.  Eventually you reach the top.  You look around
 and find yourself at a level with the Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.
 pending).

 "I've never tasted human flesh," says Julia, "but I hear it tastes just
 like Chicken!  Doesn't THAT make you want to pat your tummies and say
 yummy yummy, viewers?"

>examine buffalo
 The Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending) is an enormous, furry buffalo
 head with thick horns mounted as far apart as a broad man's shoulders.
 As you know, it rests on a tightly coiled spring, and launches forward
 at the touch of a button hidden on the desk.  Uncle Foggy favored using
 the device on unsolicited salesmen and IRS auditors.  He would seat
 them before the desk, wait until they were deeply engrossed in
 business, and then...  SPROI-OI-OING!  The huge head would lunge
 towards them at high velocity while Uncle Foggy screamed, "It's still
 alive!  Run!  For the love of God, RUN!"  Then he'd cackle hysterically
 as they tripped over themselves in their rush for the door.  Needless
 to say, victims of this prank rarely returned.

 A gutteral French accent beyond the door can only be Mrs.  Faverolles
 cursing Dorkings for chasing her out of the study during her program.

>get on buffalo
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.
 pending).

 On the television, Julia Childs drops one of the hens she is preparing.
 "Oh, too bad," she says, "Looks like that little chicky flew the coop!"

>winnie, get on desk
 You let out an unintelligible squawk, failing to communicate your
 order.

 Cousin Red mistakenly runs into Aunt Lamona - she raises a great squawk
 and pecks Red viciously in return.

>examine balloon
 The Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon (pat.  pending), a long, thin
 balloon of the variety used to make balloon animals, is another of
 Uncle Foggy's inventions.  Uncle Foggy was endlessly fond of making
 balloon animals for guests, but equally frustrated at their short
 life-span and tendancy to burst.  So he took vulcanization a step
 further with Uncle Foggy's Foggyized Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon
 Rubber (pat.  pending)!

 "I've never tasted human flesh," says Julia, "but I hear it tastes just
 like Chicken!  Doesn't THAT make you want to pat your tummies and say
 yummy yummy, viewers?"

>examine drawer
 Drawers of all sizes and shape fill Uncle Foggy's desk.

 On the television, Julia Childs sneaks a sip of sherry from a bottle
 beneath the counter.  You hear the word 'cirrhosis' shouted from among
 the audience, to which Julia responds "Oh, pish tosh.  There's nothing
 wrong with MY liver that a little CHICKEN liver won't cure!"

>open drawer
 You can't reach the drawers from the Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.
 pending).

 On the television, Julia Childs coughs up a mouthful of feathers.  "Oh,
 dear!"  she exlaims.  "Excuse me!"

>go down
 You hop down off of the Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending) and flutter
 to the study floor.

 A gutteral French accent beyond the door can only be Mrs.  Faverolles
 cursing Dorkings for chasing her out of the study during her program.

>get on desk
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the desk.

 "Once we're done with our coq au vin," says Julia Childs, "we'll move
 on to a lovely chicken divan recipe."

>open draw
 I don't know the word "draw".

>open drawer
 Your new body hasn't got the power to open the heavy wooden drawers.

 On the television, Julia Childs cracks an egg into a bowl, whips it
 into a light batter, and then drops eviscerated chicken parts into it.
 "Well," says Julia, "I guess that answers the question of which came
 first!"

 I don't know the word "ballon".

>take balloon
 You can only carry one thing at a time in your beak.

 On the television, Julia Childs drops one of the hens she is preparing.
 "Oh, too bad," she says, "Looks like that little chicky flew the coop!"

>drop straw
 The Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.  pending) slides off the desk to the
 study floor.

 Uncle Orpington pulls a long strand of fiber from the carpet.  Cousin
 Red jealously tries to snatch it away, and a tug-of-war ensues.

>take balloon
 You grab hold of the long, stringy Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon
 (pat.  pending) with your beak and pull until it flaps free of the
 Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon Dispenser (pat.  pending).  You
 discover that it is the last one in the dispenser, something that
 leaves you with a queer sense of melancholy.

 On the television, Julia Childs mercilessly pounds the carcass of some
 poor disemboweled fowl with a - gulp - meat tenderizer.

>tie balloon to drawer
 I don't know the word "tie".

>put balloon in knot
 You can't reach that from the desk.

>put straw in balloon
 You can't reach the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.  pending) from the desk.

 On the television, Julia Childs is hacking the limbs off some
 unfortunate fowl with a butcher's knife the size of Bayonne, New
 Jersey.

>go down
 You hop down off of the desk and flutter to the study floor.

 Red - at least you think it's Red - clambers up onto the sofa and crows
 at the top of his scrawny little lungs.

>put straw in balloon
 You slide the mouth of the Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon (pat.
 pending) over the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.  pending).

 "Later on the program," says Julia Childs, "I'll show you how to feed a
 family of four even if your man is bringing home chicken feed!"

>get on sill
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the windowsill.

 The formerly dour Mr.  Dorkings makes for a peculiar sight as he
 rebounds off your uncle's desk, leaving a trail of black feathers.

>put balloon in knot
 You cram the balloon-covered end of the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.
 pending) into the knot, then, gripping it with your beak, shove the
 Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon (pat.  pending) as far into the knot
 as you can.

 Cousin Red mistakenly runs into Aunt Lamona - she raises a great squawk
 and pecks Red viciously in return.

>inflate baloon
 I don't know the word "baloon".

>inflate balloon
 You have no lips and you must blow.

 On the television, Julia Childs leans out into her audience and asks
 conspiratorially, "Do you folks know why the chicken crossed the road?"
 After a moment she answers, "Because it was hauled across in a
 butcher's cart, of course!"  Her joke is met by silence from the
 audience, prompting her to respond cheerily with "Well!  THAT joke sure
 laid an egg!"

 I don't understand that sentence.

 Study, on the windowsill
 Light from the outside streams in through the closed window,
 illuminating Uncle Foggy's comfortably cluttered study.  It's full of
 interesting odds and ends, not the least of which is the trophy mounted
 on the wall above the desk.  Many were the times that you and Winnie
 would climb the bookshelves in search of written treasure, and then
 spread out by the fireplace with your latest finds.  For more dexterous
 pleasures, there was the carton of assorted works in progress Uncle
 Foggy usually kept beneath his desk.  If nothing else appealed,
 sneaking maraschino cherries from the bar was always good for a few
 giggles.

 The room is filled with chickens, running in crazy circles and bounding
 off the furniture and each other.  Resting off to one side of the room
 is Uncle Foggy's ultimate practical joke.  Sitting on the bar is the
 Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending).

 On the television, Julia Childs sneaks a sip of sherry from a bottle
 beneath the counter.  You hear the word 'cirrhosis' shouted from among
 the audience, to which Julia responds "Oh, pish tosh.  There's nothing
 wrong with MY liver that a little CHICKEN liver won't cure!"

 You and Winnie used to spend many cold days bundled up by the charming
 old brick fireplace, with good books and hot chocolate, the latter
 preferably drunken through one of Uncle Foggy's Wacky Rainbow Straws
 (pat.  pending).  Standing to one side of the fireplace is an
 assortment of brass pokers and an old bellows.

 Uncle Orpington pecks at the carpet as if looking for worms.

 You hop down off of the windowsill and flutter to the study floor.

 On the television, Julia Childs sneaks a sip of sherry from a bottle
 beneath the counter.  You hear the word 'cirrhosis' shouted from among
 the audience, to which Julia responds "Oh, pish tosh.  There's nothing
 wrong with MY liver that a little CHICKEN liver won't cure!"

 Realizing that you can't use the bellows in its current position, you
 try to topple it from its upright position by the fireplace.  It
 budges, but just barely.  Winnie, comprehending your efforts, lends a
 beak to assist.  Working together, you manage to pull the bellows down
 to the ground and drag it to the center of the room.

 "I once killed a chicken just to watch it die," says Julia Childs.

 Winnie gives you a light peck as if to say "Don't be a little chicken
 shit.  I'm not helping you move that again."

 On the television, Julia Childs cracks an egg into a bowl, whips it
 into a light batter, and then drops eviscerated chicken parts into it.
 "Well," says Julia, "I guess that answers the question of which came
 first!"

>put straw in bellows
 You hold the straw firmly in beak and cram it as far into the tube of
 the bellows as it will go.  The straw fits snugly inside the tube,
 forming a solid connection.

 "Later today," says Julia Childs, "we'll be demonstrating how to
 perform emergency liver transplant surgery on your house pets using
 chicken liver!"

>get on desk
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the desk.

 Uncle Orpington pulls a long strand of fiber from the carpet.  Cousin
 Red jealously tries to snatch it away, and a tug-of-war ensues.

 Another of Uncle Foggy's inventions, the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.
 pending) was developed with you and Winnie in mind.  It's a ludicrously
 long flexible straw that randomly changes the color of liquids that
 pass through it.  You and Winnie used to enjoy drinking Shirley Temples
 from across the room, watching as the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.
 pending) turned the drink from cherry cola red to lime rickey green to
 tang orange.

 One end of the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.  pending) is inserted into the
 bellows, while the other is inserted into the Super-Bendy
 Balloon-Animal Balloon (pat.  pending) and crammed into the knot in the
 window.

 On the television, Julia Childs leans out into her audience and asks
 conspiratorially, "Do you folks know why the chicken crossed the road?"
 After a moment she answers, "Because it was hauled across in a
 butcher's cart, of course!"  Her joke is met by silence from the
 audience, prompting her to respond cheerily with "Well!  THAT joke sure
 laid an egg!"

>push button
 The Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending) zooms off the wall with a
 resounding SPROI-OI-OING.  The trophy jerks to a sudden stop about
 three feet off the ground, in front of the desk, and just above the
 bellows lying in the middle of the room.  Aunt Lamona, standing near
 the bellows, leaps with bulging eyes from the path of the charging
 trophy.  A moment later, the head snaps back to the wall.

 As much as you would love to end Ms.  Childs' depredations, the
 television seems to be chicken-proof.

 A gutteral French accent beyond the door can only be Mrs.  Faverolles
 cursing Dorkings for chasing her out of the study during her program.

 You can't reach the bellows from the desk.

 "Later today," says Julia Childs, "we'll be demonstrating how to
 perform emergency liver transplant surgery on your house pets using

>get on bellows
 I don't know how to get on the bellows.

 On the television, Julia Childs coughs up a mouthful of feathers.  "Oh,
 dear!"  she exlaims.  "Excuse me!"

>get on sill

 Uncle Orpington pulls a long strand of fiber from the carpet.  Cousin
 Red jealously tries to snatch it away, and a tug-of-war ensues.

 I don't know how to jump the bellows.

 The terrible pounding resumes briefly as Mrs.  Faverolles makes another
 attempt at the door.

>pump bellows
 I don't know the word "pump".

 It's an ordinary bellows, lying in the middle of the room in front of
 Uncle Foggy's desk.  Two bits of tapered wood are joined by an
 accordion-like sleeve. Pulling the handle out fills it with air;
 squeezing them together expels the air.  You and Winnie used to use
 enjoy using this particular bellows to inflate Uncle Foggy's
 Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloons (pat.  pending).

 Attached to the tube of the bellows is one of Uncle Foggy's Rainbow
 Wacky Straws (pat.  pending).

 On the television, Julia Childs cracks an egg into a bowl, whips it

 Winnie gives you a light peck as if to say "Don't be a little chicken
 shit.  I'm not helping you move that again."

 Uncle Orpington pecks at the carpet as if looking for worms.

>squeeze bellows
 As a chicken, you don't have the muscle (or the hands, for that matter)
 to squeeze the bellows.  Oh, if only you had hands again!

 "You know," says Julia as she strips the flesh off some poor dead bird,
 "the thing I like about these Purdue chickens is how nice and easily
 the skins slide off.  I guess it's true what they say.  It really DOES
 take a tough man to make a tender chicken."  Julia's audience laughs
 politely.

 I don't recognize that sentence.

 There are words after your command I couldn't use.

>get on bar
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the bar.

 Uncle Orpington pecks at the carpet as if looking for worms.

>take helper
 You snatch an end of the Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) up in your beak.
 Though quite bulky, they're light enough that you can drag them around
 single...  er...  beakedly.

 On the television, Julia Childs is busy shoving her entire forearm up
 some poor chicken's posterior.  How humiliating!

>go down
 You hop down off of the bar and flutter to the study floor.

 On the television, Julia Childs mercilessly pounds the carcass of some
 poor disemboweled fowl with a - gulp - meat tenderizer.

>examine helper
 The Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) extend a gardener's reach while
 trimming tall hedges.  They clamp on to the shoulders at one end, and
 end in a pair of articulated rubber hands at the other.  The hands
 operate a second pair of shears, mimicking the operator's own hands,
 doubling both his reach and his efficiency.

 The Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) are another of Uncle Foggy's
 inventions.  Being the recluse he was, he liked his hedges TALL.

 "On next week's program," says Julia Childs, "I'll be showing you how
 to make chicken-fried chicken!"

>clamp bellows
 I don't know the word "clamp".

 Done.

 Red - at least you think it's Red - clambers up onto the sofa and crows

 On the television, an audience member asks Julia if she uses free range
 chickens.  "Free range!"  she shouts cheerfully.  "Gas range is more
 like it!"

 Dorkings was a dour looking man in black.  Now he's a dour looking
 black chicken.  And those beady eyes don't make him look any more
 trustworthy.

 On the television, Julia Childs coughs up a mouthful of feathers.  "Oh,
 dear!"  she exlaims.  "Excuse me!"

>get on shelf
 With one of the light-weight Hedge Helper (pat.  pending) hands
 clutched in your beak, you attempt to climb the tall bookshelf, without
 much progress.  Winnie, seeing your plan, beaks down on the other hand
 and mounts alongside you.  Between you both, you're able, slowly,
 laboriously, to climb the bookshelves with the Hedge Helpers (pat.
 pending).  At last you reach the top, even with the Buffalo-On-A-Spring
 (pat.  pending).

 Aunt Lamona and Uncle Orpington - at least you think they're Aunt
 Lamona and Uncle Orpington - slam into each other at full tilt and
 knock each other onto the floor.

>get on trophy
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.
 pending).

 On the television, Julia Childs mercilessly pounds the carcass of some
 poor disemboweled fowl with a - gulp - meat tenderizer.

>put helpers on trophy
 There's no good surface on the head itself, but you might be able to
 mount the Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) on the trophy's horns.

 A gutteral French accent beyond the door can only be Mrs.  Faverolles
 cursing Dorkings for chasing her out of the study during her program.

>put helpers on horn
 With Winnie's help, you mount the the Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) on
 the horns of the the Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending).

 On the television, Julia Childs invites an audience member up to assist
 her.  The volunteer hesitates at reaching into the chicken's cavity,
 prompting Julia to ask "What're you...  chicken?"  Julia laughs
 hysterically at her own joke, accompanied by a smattering of applause
 from the audience.

>go down

 to the study floor.

 "On next week's program," says Julia Childs, "I'll be showing you how

>press button
 The Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending) zooms off the wall with a
 resounding SPROI-OI-OING, the Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending) bouncing
 crazily behind.  Cousin Red, standing near the bellows, leaps with
 bulging eyes from the path of the charging trophy just in time to avoid
 the whipping Hedge Helpers (pat.  pending), which latch onto the
 bellows and give it a good solid squeeze.  The bellows BOOFS as the air
 is forced out of it and through the Rainbow Wacky Straw (pat.
 pending), then into the attached Super-Bendy Balloon-Animal Balloon
 (pat.  pending), which fills with air, slowly raising the window a
 scant chicken's height as it swells.  Winnie, seeing your intent, hops
 onto the windowsill and steps on the mouth of the Super-Bendy
 Balloon-Animal Balloon (pat.  pending) to prevent the air escaping it.
 A moment later, the head snaps back to the wall, the Hedge Helpers
 (pat.  pending) whipping insanely behind.  The bellows slowly returns
 to its original position as air rushes back into it.

 On the television, Julia Childs coughs up a mouthful of feathers.  "Oh,

 Winnie sees you headed on a course to pull down the Hedge Helpers (pat.

 think about it, egg head.  We've got to get out of here!"

 "Once we're done with our coq au vin," says Julia Childs, "we'll move
 on to a lovely chicken divan recipe."

>out

 "Thanks for tuning in," says Julia Childs.  "I know you'll just LOVE
 our all day long chicken recipe-athon!"

>go through window
 You flounce through the window, Winnie close behind.  You've just
 reached the outside sill when behind you, a thunderous din begins at
 the door.  The door cracks open to reveal the terrible figure of Mrs.
 Faverolles!  She stands beneath the lintel brandishing the mucous-white
 corpse of a dead fowl in one hand and a great cleaver in the other.
 All is still as she and your relatives regard each other with silent
 amazement.  The tableau is broken as Julia Childs show cuts to a
 commercial and an announcer's voice screams "FUNNY CAR AND MONSTER
 TRUCK RALLY SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAAAAY!!!"  Mrs.  Faverolles slams the
 door behind her and wades into the room swinging her bloody cleaver to
 the sound of manic laughter on the television.  The feathers fly as
 your relatives carom around the room like chickens with their heads cut
 off.  You and Winnie watch in horror until the Super-Bendy
 Balloon-Animal Balloon (pat.  pending) beneath the window finally
 bursts, sending the window speeding shut and throwing the two of you
 from your perch on the sill.  You flutter to the ground, no worse for
 wear.

 Front Lawn
 Uncle Foggy's front lawn teeters just on the border of ill-kempt,
 though no one specific flaw draws attention.  The three vehicles parked
 on the lawn fail to aid its appearance.  Uncle Foggy's home, Foggywood
 Manor, lies to the north, while the gate through which you entered
 rests back to the south.  Though you can't see it over the hedges, you
 know that beyond the gate and across the road lies the ramshackle cabin
 that Uncle Foggy called his lab.

 Winnie is here with you, eagerly waiting for your next move.

>peck winnie
 Tempting, but not helpful.

>go south
 You head for the swinging gate, left conveniently ajar, and squeeze
 through to the other side.  It looks like an easy trip across the road
 to Uncle Foggie's lab.  But just as you're about to set foot on the
 road, a streak of copper catches your eye.  It's a fox!  You turn tail
 and run back through the gate, just in time to bump into Winnie coming
 out.  The two of you rebound off each other, confusing your sense of
 direction.  With a growing sense of urgency you rush at the gate again,
 and manage to squeeze through just as a sharp claw swipes at your tail
 feathers.  The gate bangs shut behind you, startling the fox away for
 the moment.  Then it slowly creaks open again.

>go south
 Not with that fox hanging around out there!  You're going to have to
 find another way to cross that road.

>look

 Winnie is here with you, eagerly waiting for your next move.

>examine vehicles
 Your worn out coupe looks pretty shoddy compared to the gleaming lustre
 of the Barnevelder's massive sedan, to say nothing of Red's gargantuan,
 brilliantly painted truck.

>examine sedan
 Your Uncle Orpington's Oldsmobuick is a beetle black sedan of late
 vintage.  It looks big and mean, fit for running down small animals and
 old ladies on the highway.

>examine coupe
 Your car is a beaten-up, anonymous-looking two door coupe.  It reminds
 you of one of Uncle Foggy's favorite jokes:  Why has a chicken coop got
 only two doors?  Because if it had four it'd be a chicken sedan!

>examine truck
 Your cousin Red's monster truck is a masterpiece of modern automotive
 engineering.  Its brightly colored chassis hovers nearly five feet off
 the ground, suspended by enormous black tires big enough to feed an
 entire tribe of African pygmies through three rainy seasons.  A
 galvanized metal stair extends down from the driver's side door,
 without which tiny Red could never have tamed the monster.  Apparently
 Red left the roof at home, as the cab is open to the air.  Red has
 obnoxiously parked the truck facing forward right in front of the gate,
 which forced you to drive around him when you entered.

>enter truck
 Followed by Winnie, you hop up the metal steps and flutter over the
 door into the cab of Red's truck.  It is with incredible relief that
 you find Red's car keys hanging from the ignition.  You've never driven
 a truck like this - let alone while wearing a chicken's body - but the
 ignition, gear stick and gas pedal look like a good place to start.

>turn key
 You turn the keys with your beak, and the monster truck roars to life!

>examine stick
 Cousin Red's gear shift has an eight-ball mounted on the knob.

>shift gear
 You and Winnie together both jump on the gear shift, your combined
 weight just barely enough to slide it into gear.

>jump on gas
 Fearing that even your combined weight may not be enough, you and
 Winnie jump together onto the gas pedal.  The truck lurches into
 motion!  Rear wheels pealing, it bursts forward, crashing through the
 front gate and across the road, baby!  At the far side, the truck hits
 a deep pothole that jolts you and Winnie into the air, giving you a
 perfect view as the truck slams into one sagging wall of Uncle Foggy's
 ramshackle lab.  The impact flattens you into the windshield, as debris
 from the crumbling wall crashes down upon you.

 When the dust finally settles, you and Winnie clamber dizzily out of
 the truck. Uncle Foggy's lab is a shambles.  Shelves have collapsed,
 spilling their contents everywhere.  The entire structure looks as
 though it may fall down at any moment.  But there, posted on a
 relatively stable section of wall, is a diagram outlining the process
 of Uncle Foggy's Super Funky Chickenizer (pat.  pending).  Below it, on
 a sturdy bench, is a small white pyramid - clearly the mate to the
 device that got you into this mess.

>examine diagram
 It seems to outline the process of Uncle Foggy's Super Funky
 Chickenizer (pat.  pending).

>examine pyramid
 This must be the reversion device for Uncle Foggy's Super Funky
 Chickenizer (pat.  pending).  It's a white matte pyramid with a small
 switch at its apex.

>use device
 I don't know the word "use".

>press switch
 You can't reach the device from the lab floor.

>read diagram
 I don't know how to read the diagram.

>get on bench
 Wings flapping, you leap up on to the bench.

 It seems to outline the process of Uncle Foggy's Super Funky
 Chickenizer (pat.  pending).

>press switch
 The switch flips over with a hollow 'click'...  and suddenly, the world
 seems smaller.











 Much later, you and Winnie sit down to a sumptuous dinner prepared by
 Mrs.  Faverolles.  You're both able to laugh over the day's events from
 the comfortable safety of Uncle Foggy's expansive dining room.

    "What a day!"  you exclaim to Winnie between mouthfuls.
    "I know," she says, sipping a glass of wine.  "I thought we would
 never find a way to revert to our old selves."
    "Too bad about the Barnevelders missing their chance to participate
 in the scavenger hunt."
    "Oh, yes," nods Winnie.
    "So.  How are you finding the chicken?"  you ask, changing the
 subject.
    "Mm, it's a big stringy for my tastes."  says Winnie, chewing a
 mouthful of food.
    "Really?  Mine's quite tender."
    "Well, you know what they say," says Winnie.
    "What's that?"  you inquire.

    "It's all relative!"
