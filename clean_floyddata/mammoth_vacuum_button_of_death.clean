 Dear Blogreaders,
  last time I told you how I and my husband Paul went by yacht to the
 island of St. Lincoln (quite near Voodoo Island), to deliver the corpse
 of his late uncle Wally. Well, as you might imagine, it all ended with
 the yacht being eaten by a demon-possessed kraken. So there I was,
 confused, and sinking into the lightless depths, not in the least
 expecting that this might be...

 Shapeless Void
 You are in a shapeless void. Oh no. This is one of those games.

 Before you lingers the unfathomable, nine-armed monstrosity of the
 giant kraken!

>fathom the kraken
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>ask Kraken about it's feelings
 There is no reply.

>examine kraken
 Pretty much what's in his intial appearance.

>pet kraken
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

 Well, nice, not one item survived from the first game. Looks like you
 have only your sharp wit to guide you.

 The kraken attacks you and you discover that, not only is he tall as a
 small house (you know, the one you downgraded to after the recession),
 but also has far more arms than you. Think of all the bonuses he'd get
 in D&D. Yes. Ouch.

>wake up
 The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.

>examine paul

>go up

 Ocean Surface
 There are a lot of blocked exits, but the island to the southeast looks
 promising. There's a crumpled figure on the bach. Paul!

>examine paul
 You can't see any such thing.

>se
 You stumble upon the beach, warm water lapping at your soaked khakis.
 The figure is indeed Paul. You kneel beside him and gently turn him
 over. He looks a little worse for wear, but still very much alive. You
 put a hand on his heart and feel it flutter. Better do some
 mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, just to be sure. As you come back up,
 having checked if his tongue is okay in the process, some shadows fall
 upon you.
 You look up and see yourself surrounded by a group of well-armed
 sharkmen. Mensharks? You are aware of neither the scientific
 possibility of there being a tribe of undiscovered sharkmen, nor the
 politically correct term for them.
  As you  sit there, gaping at them, quite aware you are staring,
 another person comes from their lines. It's a creature in a robe with
 tentacles for a face, but her commanding voice is clearly female:
 "Get the cute one. Kill the other."
  Having no illusions about your looks, you get ready to take a few of
 them with you. So you stand up and read your wit. A group of them, lead
 by the tentacle-faced lady, leave with an unconscious Paul carried
 between them.
 There is a moment of silence, with only the lapping of the  waves as
 sound. You never knew there could be uncomfortable silence with a bunch
 of people about to kill you, but there you have it. Finally you realize
 they're looking behind you, and as you turn, one swipe from the kraken
 hurls you screaming into the air.

 Hurling
 Down -island, up- clouds, no, down - clouds, up - island - oh no
 wait...

>examine paul
 You can't see any such thing.

>look
 You are hurling screaming through the air!

 You land in a treetop with a thud. Luckily your fall was broken by the
 thick canopy of leaves.

 Top of Tree
 You are in the top of some tropical tree.

 A liana is hanging from the tree.

 A lemon grows from a branch here.

>examine liana
 You see nothing special about the Liana.

>examine lemon
 It's a lemon. A fruit. You know a few of those.



 You hear noises from the northwest. Must be some guards around the
 front of the base. "So, Jim, did you ever regret becoming a sharkman in
 Dr. FrenesiÃ©'s army?"
 "Well, it somewhat limits your social circles, but c'mon, I'm a real
 sharkman! A furries wet dream."
 "You're a furry, man? I had no idea!"
 "What was that sound?"

>take lemon
 Taken.



 "It came from the beach."
 "Should we check it out?"
 "Looks like it's coming our wa- Oh my God!"
 "CONTAIN THE KRAKEN!"
  There's gunfire.

>take all
 There are none at all available!

>pull liana
 It is fixed in place.



 There's a horrible screeching of metal as the front gate realizes it
 isn't kraken-proof. Looks like the beast has managed to get into the
 base. Should be a good distraction.

>examine liana
 You see nothing special about the Liana.

>climb liana
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>go down

 Side of Secret Base
 Besides you looms the wall of some sort of Secret Base, seemingly build
 in the shape of a volcano. A worn path leads northward towards some
 sort of main gate, but you can't really see due to undergrowth.

 An air vent grating is in the wall. It's fastened somewhat loosely.
 Lousy handiworks. Must be hard to get good craftsmen on Voodoo Island.

 some scars.

 Besides you looms the wall of some sort of Secret Base, seemingly build

 sort of main gate, but you can't really see due to undergrowth.You can
 enter the air vent to the northwest.

 You can see a galvanized nail here.

>get nail
 Taken.

 It's a galvanized nail with a zinc covering. Must be from the broken
 grating, which, oddly, isn't implemented.

 You stick the nail into the lemon.

>enter grate

>go northwest

 Air duct
 It's terribly hot and dusty in here. Looks like you can crawl towards
 the northeast, where there's a junction. You can't detect any security
 measures so far.


 "So", this is Paul voice, relayed to you through some tricks of
 acoustic and dramaturgy, from somewhere deep within this hellish place,
 "is it hard being a female supervillian?"


>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>no
 That was a rhetorical question.


 "Well, y'know, I have no problem with all the torturing of the
 innocent, holding whole countries hostage and the logistics of an
 indoor piranha pool are grim, but managable - but my mother was very
 hard on me when I told her she wouldn't have grandchildren."

>go northeast

 Duct Junction
 You can crawl to the west, or further to the northeast, where there's
 another junction. The way back out is sw.


 "Because of your demanding job?"
 "No, when I crossed my DNA with squid DNA to show everyone at the
 institute, I became infertile."
 "Oh."

>go west

 Above the cell
 You look down through a grating, easily openable from this side, into a
 cell.


 "Well", Alex starts up again, ever so helpful, "How about adoption?"
 "You know, you got me there, in a certain way, I think I never really
 wanted children. I find this life of death and destruction, and
 unethical science quite fullfilling."

>open grating
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cell
 You can't see any such thing.

>go down

 cell
 Metal bars leading through an unremarkable hallway, a cot, a toilet,
 nice classic IF design like that.

 Why, there's the skeleton of the famous adventurer Conathan Cask here!


 "Sure, why not. So, er, speaking of unethical science, what exactly are
 your plans with me? Do you want to turn me into a shark man?"
 "No, far better."

>search skeleton
 You found a scrap of paper on the skeleton, and a copper coin.


 "Bet...Better?"
 "Yeah, but it would spoil the surprise!"
 A pause.
 "Aren't you the least bit mad I killed you husband?"
 "Paul? You haven't killed Paul. You think an army of shark men can stop
 him? He fought dictators, aliens and Dagon cultists to save me."
 "So, he is some kind of badass?"
 "He once killer someone, -spoiler alert - jvgu n phcpnxr."
 Dr. Frenesie whistles softly.
 You smile grimly. Yeah, that was a cool move.

>examine coin
 As you touch the coin, you remember two things, 1) Seeing  No country
 for old men  in the cinema with Paul (he didn't like it) 2) some school
 experiment. Something about electricity.


 "So, Alex, how did you guys end up here, anyway?"
 "Well, you see, Paul killed my Uncle Wally."
 "He did WHAT?"
 "Yeah, he has this adorbale sociopathic streak."
 "Oh-okay..."


>put coin in lemon
 You stick the coin into the lemon.


 "Then, a year later, when his body was discovered, we wanted to get him
 buried at St. Lincoln."
 "That's only a few miles from here. Lovely place. They have some good
 bars. You should go there, if you escape my deadly clutches one day."
 "We were planning to, actually."
 "Be sure to try their cocktails. They mix a mean Singapore Sling."
 "Thanks. I'd write that down, but you have me tied to this chair."


>examine lemon
 It's a lemon. A fruit. You know a few of those.You've stuck a
 galvanized nail and a copper coin into it.


 "So" Alex starts up again. "You realize that Paul will kill you without
 batting an eye - and if he does that, it's only to aim whatever weapon
 he happened to find?"
 "Sure, that's a risk you have to deal with, daily, as a supervillian.
 I'm quite aware of that."

>read paper
 Hm, it has a strange email address on it. Something about ice cream.


 "Aren't you the least bit scared?"
 "Aren't you?"

>examine cot
 You can not sleep on it, and neither is something hidden inside or
 underneath it.

>examine toilet
 You can neither pee in it, nor flush it, nor take the water from it.

 Above the Cryo chamber
 Yeah, that.

>go down

 Cryo chamber
 Not unsurprinsgly, it's pretty cold here. All the walls are covered
 with complicated equipment, screens, keyboards, readouts.

 The heart of this room is a cryo pod, standing on 4 blocks of cement to
 allow the air to circulate beneath it. 3 huge power cables lead from it
 into into the wall.

>examine cables
 After examining the power cables for a moment, you realize that the
 cool blue pulsing light actually goes from the pod to the wall, meaning
 that the base isn't powering the pod - the pod is powering the base.

>examine pod
 In the cryo pod is Elvis.

>examine blocks
 You can't see any such thing.

>open pod
 There are some magnetic locks, and you don't feel like opening it
 anyway. This probably needs some complicated procedure you're unaware
 of.

>examine elvis
 Holy Moses! All those conspiracy theorists where right - Elvis IS
 alive! But in cryo sleep. So all those sightings were still hoaxes.
  And personally, you'd rather have found Jim Morrison.

 is powered by Elvis' sheer awesomeness.
 Huh! You note a small button reading "UNFREEZE"

>push unfreeze

 Machines begin to hum and whine, and the readout changes.
 One of the machines begins to rumble, and something bonks you on the

 This is a huge hangar, painted a lively grey, stacked to the ceiling

 guards.

 Imagine this as sneak scene from an FPS - sticking to the shadows, one

 around and fight the controls, and die over and over again. And now
 imagine a smooth cutscene, showing this, you, like a only slightly
 lighter shadow among all the others, unseen, unheard, a whisper in the
 wind. The truth is somewhere in the middle. You arrive at the laptop.

 You sit before an unremarkable box.

 A laptop sits on it!

 You blew your chance for a deus ex machina. Sooner or later the kraken

>send email

>write email
 You write an email to the strange address you found on Conathan Casks
 corpse, basically saying: "HELP!"
 At that moment, the laptop powers down. You can't be sure if it was
 sent or not. Than you notice the eerie quiet. And you look up -
 And above you towers the huge, monstrous form of the kraken, its red
 eyes burning with demon possession. So that's how it'll end. You try to
 steady yourself, mentally preparing to fast forward through the boring
 bits when your life flashes before your eyes.

 Then a golden crack opens in reality, right next to the kraken. A
 figure steps through it, more of a stroll really, but he's hard to see
 due to the intense white light behind him. You cover your eyes, but the
 kraken turns its massive form around to face this new foe. But it is no
 foe- the figure has one hand in its pocket. You glimpse a football
 jersey behind the golden illumination - holy crap, it's Robb Sherwin!
 He pulls the kraken on one tentacles, and the creature bows down to
 him. "Hey buddy! I know a place for creatures like you. Come with me
 and visit my friend Vest, he'll help you." The kraken nods it's head
 and follows Robb into the golden crack, but not before punching a hole
 into the wall, followed by a meaningful look towards you.
 "Robb!" you shout, "how can I ever thank you?" He turns around, and his
 wise eyes judge you for a moment, "No problem, buddy. No fucking
 problem." He gives you a fingergun and is gone. You straighten up. You
 feel like a better person already.

 Hangar

 there's a huge hole in the eastern wall.

 FrenesiÃ©s Lair
 This is a tastefully decoreated lair. Bookshelves on the walls, lush
 red carpet, impressive murals on the walls, depicting the development
 of Dr. FrenesiÃ©s genetic experiments. Behind the desk, the room opens
 up towards a rocket silo. Paul is visible through an open bulkhead.
 He's tied to a zero-g chair.

 Dr. Frenesie seems to be stunned from the recent, redecoration and
 waves a futuristic gun in your general direction.

 "No, Alex!" screams Paul, "it's a trap..."
  But you have already noted that Dr. Frenesie isn't as stunned as she
 seems, and with a quick flick of the wrist, you throw your sharp wit
 and hit her somewhere in the tentacled mass of her face. She sprays ink
 everyhwere and slumps onto the desk. You grin at Paul. "See, darling,
 absolutely no..."
 "...door." The ground gives way, and you fall, screaming.

 be as damaged as you hoped, and throws it back at you. Impaled by your
 own wit, the last thing you hear is Paul screaming your name.

 press a hidden remote and this rocket will launch, sending your husband
 off to my secret base on Mercury, where he will be transformed into a
 genetic mixture of human and Mercury Man, called a ... Mercury Man.
 Dammit! PR hasn't gotten back to me about that name."
 "ALEX! She is bluffing!" You blast FrenesiÃ© with the energy ray, and
 she topples over her desk.
 There is a hissing of starting rocket engines.
 Paul screams : "You idiot! I meant about being a single mom!" You have
 to watch helplessly (hence a non-interactive cutscene) as the door
 closes on Paul and soon, the rocket is launched into space. The gun
 clutters from your lifeless hand. He's gone. Gone to Mercury. And no
 chance to get him back.

 With tear filled eyes, you turn towards the desk, where Dr. FrenesiÃ© is
 rising again, a smoking hole in her belly. She has a smaller, but still
 futuristic gun in her hand.
 "You thought you could kill me? ME? Do you have any idea who I am?"
 There is a voice behind you, one that millions recognize instantly:
 "(You're) The Devil in disguise." The energy gun flashes again, and you
 are pretty sure Frenesie can't repair that damage to her face.
 Elvis puts a heavy hand on your shoulder, and together you stare up at
 the skylight.
  "I need to get him back, man" you whisper hoarsely.
 "A little less conversation, a little more action."

 Mammoth Vacuum Button of Death


 Lovely Meadow
 I am sitting on a red and black checkered blanket in the middle of a
 beautiful meadow. A giant (i.e. the size of your ugly gut) cake waits
 infront of me. For no explainable reason whatsoever, a note has been
 left on the cake. It reads 'THERE WILL BE CAKE, SO YOU SHOULD EAT IT.
 From Father'. Blatant Portal (TM) reference aside, I reckon 'Father' is
 onto something. Any excuse to eat cake right?

 from highschool called 'TOM' took your sisters virginity).
 Wait...WHAT'S HAPPENING!?!? Oh...I'm just waking up...
 Solitary Cell
 I'm in my cell. The same cell I've been in for 8 years. My semen-soaked
 sheets lay strewn over the cold concrete floor. Years of food trays are
 stacked in the corner. To the north I can see the bane of my existence.
 THE DOOR. Metal. Cold. Featureless (apart from the tiny keyhole). Void
 of personality (much like your wife). Ugly (refer to previous). My main
 road-block to freedom.

 Utterly Pointless Hallway
 Seriously? Why do they even put these hallways in games? It's simply a
 bore to trudge through lengths of non-descript hall. I don't see why
 the game creator didn't just make the cell connect straight to the
 guard station, which, if you're wondering is north of here. No, there's
 no other way to go, because I've only got two hours to make this damn
 game, and can't start throwing in rooms willy-nilly with no regard
 whatsoever to my semi self-imposed time restraints. So make your damn
 choice. You can either go south, and wallow in self-pity in your
 pathetic little cell, or GO NORTH TO ENTER THE GUARD STATION.

 Guard Station
 A guard sits infront of a row of buttons, of which one is clearly
 labelled in bigger-than-your-penis letters saying 'UNLOCK'. A metal
 door sits to the west, with a sign saying 'EXIT' above it. I can tell
 it's locked. The important doors/exits are always locked in games like
 this. Looks like I'll need to solve some kind of nonsensical puzzle to
 open it, unless I kill myself out of frustration at the incredibly
 impossible-without-a-walkthrough difficulty first. I guess I could
 always start by talking to the guard?

 standard against which all other parties in the forthcoming year are
 judged. So far, this one has been holding up quite well. You won at all

   "Party Arty" was written for both the Hugo Comp and The Penultimate
 New Year's Speed IF. It was written on December 29th and 30th of 2011.

   It's basically a game idea I had for last year's New Year's comp, but
 I didn't have time to execute it back then. Now it's written. I hope
 you enjoy it!

 By the Snack Table                              New Year's Eve, Nearly
 Midnight
   The dining room has been converted into Snack Central. A buffet table
 is completely adorned with every kind of finger food imagineable.

 Sticking upright out of the center of the plate is the most perfect
 nacho you have ever seen.

>examine nacho
 This nacho, half-covered in delectable cheese like its own golden
 helmet of Mambrino, looks tastier than any nacho you have ever seen
 before.

>take nacho
 You grab at the perfect nacho, but the nacho is lodged pretty well into
 the plate's coagulated cheese. Looks like it'll take to take a proper
 yank.

>yank nacho
 Driven by some inner force, you clasp your fingers around the nacho.
 The two seem made for one another. You pull. Nothing happens. You
 strain harder. The nacho gives a little, and then....

 [APPRECIATE THE INTENSITY OF THE MOMENT AND PRESS A KEY]








 The lights darken momentarily, as if afflicted by a power surge. When
 your vision clears, you are somewhere else completely.

 By A Cave                                  Circumcision of Christ Eve,
 Compline
   A path leads up to this cave. A multitude of stars shine down.

   A wizened figure with an unkempt beard is here. You take him to be
 Merlin, the legendary wizard.

   A rock is here.

 Merlin addresses you:
   "Arthur, you have proven yourself a worthy champion in the face of
 adversity. I must ask you to retrieve an item of great importance from
 a room upstairs in this house. I cannot assist except to lend you three
 powers that you will have to use to your advantage.

   [1] "Whoa, did you send me back in time?"
   [2] "An object of great importance?"
   [3] "Three powers, you say?"
   [4] "I thought you aged in reverse!"

>1
   "Whoa, did you send me back in time?"

   Merlin says, "I did! Pretty cool, huh? Don't worry; you'll be sent
 back soon enough."

 You consider your other options.

   [1] "An object of great importance?"
   [2] "Three powers, you say?"
   [3] "I thought you aged in reverse!"

>4
>2
   "Three powers, you say?"

   "Unfortunately, magic isn't what it once was. In the good old days,
 I'd give you the power to turn into all sorts of animals. A turtle,
 even! Can you imagine that? A turtle! I no longer have that kind of
 power to share, but I can augment you in other ways. Just use the magic
 command 'DUR' followed by the trait you wish:

 DUR WIT - command great conversational skill
 DUR BRAWN - gain great strength
 DUR TINY - become smaller in stature
 DUR NORMAL - go back to normal traits

   If you forget which powers are available to you, try the 'POWERS'
 command!"

   "'Dur,' huh? I can remember that," you say.

 You consider your other options.

   [1] "An object of great importance?"
   [2] "I thought you aged in reverse!"

>2
   "I thought you aged in reverse!"

   Merlin answers, "Geez, it's not like this game is canon!"

 You consider your other options.

   [1] "An object of great importance?"

>1
   "An object of great importance?"

   Merlin says, "Sinister forces prevent me from telling you what the
 object is, but you will know it when you see it."

   Merlin continues. "When you have retrieved the item, go to where the
 snack table rests. There, you will find the item's rightful place!"

 The room goes dark once more. When your vision clears, Merlin is gone
 and you are back at the party!

   The dining room has been converted into Snack Central. A buffet table

   To the north is the living room, which has been converted into a

 Living Room                                     New Year's Eve, Nearly
 Midnight
   The room is packed with moving bodies. It's kind of like the dance
 scene in Matrix Reloaded except without the weighty sense of
 disappointment. South leads to the dining room, and north heads to a
 staircase.

   A ton of people are dancing, dancing, dancing.

>dance
 You cut the rug for a little while.

>examine people
 Wow, these cats have some moves.

>stop dancing
 You don't need to use the word "dancing."

>talk to people
 The party goers are listening.

 You feel your conversational skills becoming all brilliant-like.

 It is impossible to make any headway, what with all of the dancers in
 your way.

>dur brawn
 You feel your conversational skills going to hell again. You feel the
 strength of a thousand men surging through you.

>go north
 With your extra strength, you could seriously hurt someone.

>dur tiny
 You feel your strength diminishing to mortal levels. You feel yourself
 becoming smaller, until everything around you looks much larger.

>dance
 You cut the rug for a little while.

>go north
 Being so small, it is easy for you to evade the moving bodies, at the
 price of seeing a lot of feet and butts. You make it to the other side.

 Bottom of Stairs                                New Year's Eve, Nearly
 Midnight
   Going up will take you to the second floor while heading south leads
 back to the living room.

   Travel up the stairs is blocked by a cordon.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>examine cordon
 This is one of those barriers you see at parties where a ribbon cordons
 off a stairwell or room that the hosts don't want people entering. This
 one is held up feebly by tape on its sides. A handwritten sign attached
 to it kindly asks that guests remain downstairs.

>dur brawn
 You feel your height growing to its normal size. You feel the strength
 of a thousand men surging through you.

>go up
 With strength ripping through you, you tear through the tape and its
 implied restrictions. A beast such as yourself cannot be contained. You
 continue on your way!

 Midway Up the Stairs                            New Year's Eve, Nearly

   This is just a place, halfway up the stairs. You know.

>go up

 Upstairs Hallway                                New Year's Eve, Nearly
 Midnight
   Doors head off in several directions. A staircase leads down.

   Some guy is standing around up here, guarding the good house
 bathroom.

 He notices you. He says, "Hey guy. You know, you really shouldn't be up
 here."

   [1] "Um..."
   [2] "Er..."
   [3] "Duh..."
   [4] "...Huh"

>dur wit

   "Um..."

 Unable to elequently articulate anything, you turn around and head back
 to the stairs.

 The dude notices you again. He says, "C'mon, buddy. You shouldn't be
 here."

   [1] "How appropriate. You talk like a cow. "
   [2] "Even BEFORE I smell your breath?"
   [3] "So you got that job as janitor, after all."
   [4] "There are no words for how disgusting you are."

>3
   "So you got that job as janitor, after all."

 Dumbfounded by your brilliance, the guy looks at you for a moment
 before departing down the stairs. Presumably, he left to get
 reinforcements, but you probably have managed to buy yourself some
 time.

   Moreso than any other door in this hallway, your attention is drawn
 to an exit to the east which leads to some kind of study.

>go east

 Study                                           New Year's Eve, Nearly
 Midnight
   This is a fancy study. Leather chair, oak desk, ornate globe- you
 name it.

 Despite the study's classy appearance, a model car sits in a place of
 honor on a display shelf. Seriously, you just can't make collecting
 classy.

>examine car
 This is a model of the Excalibur automobile, a roadster built in
 Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that was styled after the 1928 Mercedes-Benz SSK.
 You don't see many of these around.

 Huh, looks like all of the dancers have emptied out of the living room.

 Living Room                                     New Year's Eve, Nearly

   You can't help but wonder where everyone went. Exits lie north and
 south.

 Dining Room                                     New Year's Eve, Nearly

   Huh, the patio doors to the south are now open. It seems that
 somebody rolled the buffet table out there. Guess it had wheels!

   To the north is the now-empty living room.

>go south

 Patio                                           New Year's Eve, Nearly

   Seems the party migrated outside for an impromptu fireworks display.
 It is surprisingly comfortable out here. Lots of stars out tonight,
 too.

   Everyone is milling around, waiting for the fireworks.

   A little pond also complements the patio. You bet the fireworks will
 look cool reflected in its water.

>examine table
 The snack table looks just like you would expect.

 Sitting on the snack table is a plate of nachos.

>examine pond
 Supposedly, this is supposed to be a koi pond, but you've never
 actually seen any fish in it so you have your doubts.

>put car on table
 There's no room on the snack table.

>get plate
 You can't take that.

>put car on plate

>put car in nachos

>dur brawn

>look in pond
 The koi pond is empty.

>push table
 That would not help the present situation.

>put car in pond
 Giving a shout of glee, you throw the Excalibur into the koi pond.
 There is a stunned silence from everyone, but the moment passes and
 everybody goes back to partying. You decide to finally eat your perfect
 nacho just as the fireworks start. Your eyes shine with the wisdom of
 the ages!

 Your friends will remember this New Year's Eve party as the one where
 you got so drunk that you crawled through the crowded dance floor and
 just generally made a nuisance of yourself, but you will always
 remember it as the year you helped out a nice wizard. Plus, for a pool
 that's only a foot and a half deep, they never did find that model car
 you threw in! Destiny!

 Of course, this game tried to pay a quick and silly homage to Bob
 Bate's Arthur. The gameplay doesn't go as deep as one would like, but
 as it was, this took a dumb amount of time to code. I had a hard time
 decided what kind of object I wanted Arthur to retrieve. I eventually
 settled for the model car when it was one of the first things to turn
 up when I did some Googling for odd Excalibur items.

 As it happens, the West Allis plant where many were built was just
 around the corner of where I grew up, although I didn't realize the
 significance of it until years later. In that respect, that tidbit is a
 shoutout to my youth.

 I threw in the Man of La Mancha jokes just because "Party Arty" didn't
 seem like a title that could stand on its own. I hate to break it to
 you, but this game doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Anyhow, I hope
 you enjoyed my silly game. Of course, it's not as clever or complex as
 it could be. If anybody wants to rewrite it, go ahead!

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 It's December 26th. Your family has all gone home. Your apartment is a
 disaster. You have an eggnog hangover. You need to get ready for work.
 Too bad the Mouse King has parked himself in front of your closet.

 Post-Christmas Letdown
 A Holiday Headache by E. Joyce
 Release 1 / Serial number 111231 / Inform 7 build 6F95 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Bedroom
 The room is small, but serviceable. The walls are devoid of any posters
 or pictures - you keep meaning to put some up, but you never get around
 to it. It still looks lived-in, though, which is a polite way of saying
 it's a mess. The door of your closet doesn't quite open all the way
 because of the way the bed is positioned, but what can you do? There
 was nowhere else to put it.

 The door to the living room and kitchen area is to the west.

 The Mouse King stands at the foot of your bed, in front of the closet,
 with his sword raised.

 You can also see your mother's shoes and a gift box (in which are some
 expensive headphones) here.

>examine mouse king
 Some stupid giant rodent that stands on its - or rather, his - hind
 legs and has a tiny golden crown perched on his head. He brandishes a
 sword, and his beady eyes glitter unpleasantly. You wonder if he's the
 one who's been getting into your kitchen cabinets and chewing on the
 contents.

>examine shoes
 Your mother subscribes to the "clean out closet; gift-wrap what you
 find" school of gift-giving. These shoes are the latest result of that.
 They are bright red, rhinestone-encrusted, and very heavy, with pointy
 heels that must be at least five inches high. More weapon than shoe,
 really.

>hug mouse king
 Keep your mind on the game.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>get shoes
 Taken.

>attack king with shoes
 With power and precision borne of years of weekend amateur softball
 games (or at least as much of that power and precision as you can
 muster right now), you hurl your mother's shoes at the Mouse King.

 The shoes hit the Mouse King square in the head. He screeches horribly,
 then flees out the bedroom window.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go into closet
 That's not something you can enter.

>enter closet
 That's not something you can enter.

>examine closet
 What is there to say? It's a closet, it looks pretty much like a door
 in the wall. Until you open it, at which point it looks like an ungodly
 mess.

>open cloest
 You can't see any such thing.

>open closet
 You open the closet, revealing a t-shirt and a pair of jeans.

>examine t-shirt
 It reads, "I Killed My Father And All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt".
 It's the only thing around that's clean. Lucky you work in a call
 center and they don't bother so much about dress code.

>examine jeans
 They're practically prehistoric - did you buy these things in high
 school? Oh well, they still fit and they don't have any holes in them.
 Good enough for government work, as your mother would probably say.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>remove underwear
 What would be the point of that? You don't have time to shower, anyway.

 Don't you wish you could.

>examine box
 A nice box patterned with pine trees and snowflakes.

 In the gift box are some expensive headphones.

>get headphones
 Taken.

>put on jeans
 You put on the pair of jeans.

>examine headphones
 Your brother bought them for you, little knowing that you sold your MP3
 player in order to buy him some fancy peripheral for his game console.
 (Come to think of it, he seemed less enthused about that than you
 expected. Funny.)  So you've got no use for them now. They are very
 nice headphones, though.

>wear t-shirt
 You put on the t-shirt.

 There, now you look... well, semi-presentable. You still feel like
 shit, though. You could use some coffee.

 Living Room and Kitchen
 A waist-high counter separates the kitchen at the north end of the room
 from what you charitably think of as the living room. In the living
 room part is a blue couch, a battered old coffee table, and a small
 Christmas tree which leans drunkenly to one side; the only other
 decoration is a calendar hanging on one wall. The kitchen, meanwhile,
 contains all the usual kitchen stuff, of which the only thing that
 interests you right now is the coffee maker.

 To the east is the door to your bedroom; your bathroom is west, and the
 front door is south.

 A sprig of mistletoe hangs overhead.

 A sweater lies on the floor.

 The Norse God Baldr is in your kitchen using your coffee machine. And
 it looks like he's only making enough for one person. How rude - though
 it's nothing to using someone else's kitchen without asking in the
 first place. Point is, you can't get your coffee fix while he's hogging
 the machine, dammit. You'll have to make him go away somehow.

 Baldr goes through your cabinets, apparently looking for the mugs.

>score
 You have so far scored 2 out of a possible 7, in 28 turns.

>wear shoes
 They don't look comfortable, and besides, you're pretty sure that old
 Mrs. Sedutto downstairs will flip out if you start clunking around in
 these things.

 Baldr goes through your cabinets, apparently looking for the mugs.

>get mistletoe
 It's a little too high for you to reach.

 Baldr frowns impatiently at the coffee-maker.

>stand under mistletoe
 I only understood you as far as wanting to stand.

>drop box
 Dropped.

 Baldr goes through your cabinets, apparently looking for the mugs.

>examine mistletoe
 Your aunt insisted on putting it up, as if to rub your nose in the fact
 that you were the oldest person there without anyone present to kiss.
 (Well, your cousin Dave technically didn't have anyone either, but
 while it's too bad that his boyfriend couldn't make it, that's not
 quite the same as not having one at all.) You spent all night
 studiously avoiding it so as not to be reminded of this.

 Baldr frowns impatiently at the coffee-maker.

>stand on box
 That's not something you can stand on.

 Baldr stares blankly for a while, like he's forgotten what he was
 doing. Maybe he's not a morning person. Which would be sort of ironic.

>examine baldr
 He is really handsome. Like, really amazingly handsome, so much that he
 seems to be glowing - no, wait, he actually is glowing. Sheesh,
 deities. Anyway, it's been longer than you really like to think about
 since you last had a hot guy making coffee in your kitchen, but if you
 remember right Baldr's married, so you don't think you should read too
 much into this.

 Baldr goes through your cabinets, apparently looking for the mugs.

>jump
 Feeling a bit vindictive and wanting to take your bad mood out on
 somebody, you jump up and down repeatedly, as hard as you can. Moments
 later, a muffled sound of Italian yelling comes from downstairs. You
 feel a bit bad, afterwards - Mrs. Sedutto is kinda crotchety, yes, but
 she mostly doesn't bother you unless you bother her.

 Baldr goes through your cabinets, apparently looking for the mugs.

 your family came over and no one's even thrown up on it in almost a
 year.

 Baldr frowns impatiently at the coffee-maker.

 Baldr goes through your cabinets, apparently looking for the mugs.

>examine sweater
 A Christmas present from your aunt. It is a color you can only describe
 as chartreuse (well, or "bright yellowy-green" but "chartreuse" is
 snappier). Furthermore, it is about five sizes too big for you, which
 you can't help wondering whether your aunt is trying to tell you
 something. Like that you're fat. Which you're not. Point is, it's a
 hideous sweater.

 Baldr lounges casually against the counter. You try not to stare.

>wear sweater
 You put on the sweater.

 Baldr frowns impatiently at the coffee-maker.

 Remembering your Ragnarok prophecies (you knew that all those books of
 mythology weren't a waste of time!), you wave the mistletoe menacingly
 in Baldr's face. He goes pale - well, paler than he was to begin with -
 and flinches away from it, then shimmers and vanishes. Probably some
 kind of god teleportation thing. Oh well, you have access to the coffee
 machine now, and that's what really matters here.

 Living Room and Kitchen (on the blue couch)
 A waist-high counter separates the kitchen at the north end of the room
 from what you charitably think of as the living room. In the living
 room part is a blue couch, a battered old coffee table, and a small
 Christmas tree which leans drunkenly to one side; the only other
 decoration is a calendar hanging on one wall. The kitchen, meanwhile,
 contains all the usual kitchen stuff, of which the only thing that
 interests you right now is the coffee maker.

 To the east is the door to your bedroom; your bathroom is west, and the
 front door is south.

>go west
 (first getting off the blue couch)

 bathroom
 All this shiny white tile under fluorescent lighting kind of hurts your
 eyes and makes your headache worse. Anyway, this bathroom is equipped
 with all the normal bathroom stuff - toilet, sink, mirror, shower.

 Tiny Tim sits on your sink, looking up at you with big, soulful eyes.
 "Happy Christmas, and God bless you," he says.

 "I'd like to brush my teeth," you say wearily.

 "Of course," says Tiny Tim, "only..."

 "Only what?" you say. "Come on, get on with it."

 "Only, you see, I haven't any Christmas presents for my dear family,
 and while of course the true spirit of the season requires no present,
 only love and-"

 "I said get on with it," you snap. You have no patience right now for
 the ramblings of characters written by authors who were paid by the
 word.

 "Well, all right, I'd like a present," he says. You have the feeling
 he's not going to leave until you find him something.

 On the sink is your toothbrush.

>give shoes to tim
 You hand Tiny Tim your mother's shoes; he regards them dubiously.
 "Well," he says, "I suppose my dear mother will like it."

 He hops off the sink and hobbles away to wherever Dickens characters go
 when they're not needed. You breathe a sigh of relief and get on with
 your tooth-brushing.

 The rest of your morning routine proves uneventful, and you even manage
 to get to work on time - if only just. Which is great, because you're
 really, really not sure how you'd explain why you were late.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Christmas Eve! You tell Bob to go home early; tidy up a little, and
 lock up the office shortly after four. You look on the old brass plate,
 which still reads "Scrooge & Marley", probably for the last time.

 After visiting the engravers to pick up your package, you spend a few
 hours simply walking the busy streets, soaking in the happy
 anticipation all around. Then a simple, but magnificent, dinner at
 Kettners and a gentle stroll home. Time for bed.

 Three More Visitors
 A Speed-IF Melodrama for New Year
 by Paul Stanley

 Release 1 (2011-12-30)
 Inform v6.32 / Platypus release 4+

 Courtyard
 Not everyone is complimentary about this courtyard, or the house whose
 front door you now face. "A gloomy set of rooms" it has been called.
 But it has been your home these many years; it was the site, a decade
 past to this very day, of the great visions that changed your life
 forever. And so here you stay, and here you expect to end your days.
 The door is north.

>examine me
 Others might call you elderly -- though you feel, especially at this
 time of year, sprightly and young. A respectable, respected, much-loved
 pillar of this great city. "Good old Ebenezer", they say. "There is a
 man who knows how to celebrate Christmas".

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a door key
   a package

>xyzzy
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>about
 Written for the 2011 New Year Speed IF (though in far more than the
 customary two hours). The brief was to include some, none or all, of
 the following: your mum's shoes, Italians, a tanning bed, a copy of
 Doom III, the colour chartreuse, Tiny Tim (preferably as a foe), the
 smell of your evil twin, an e-peen hammer (whatever that may be), and a
 shirt which says "I killed my father and all I got was this lousy
 t-shirt". More or less loosely, all of them are in here somewhere.

 I spent more time than is customarily required for Speed-IF; I
 selfishly wanted a chance to play with Platypus, and I hope the result
 is not too ragged.

 For assistance and testing, thanks to Zachary and Benedict. For
 patience, thanks to Daniel. For the essential software, thanks to
 Graham Nelson (for Inform 6 and the Designer's Manual, 4th edition,
 from which I shamelessly borrowed where necessary), Anson Turner, for
 the Platypus library and Charles Dickens, for "A Christmas Carol" (from
 which I have more shamelessly borrowed).

>examine key
 A brass door key.

>examine package
 You picked it up from the engravers earlier. The package is about six
 inches wide, and eight inches long, wrapped in brown paper and tied
 with string. The label on it reads "E Scrooge Esq, to await
 collection". It's rather heavy.

 Whisps of frosty mist nuzzle into the corners of the yard.

>open package
 You know what it contains, and you don't want to spoil the surprise for
 Bob.

 The door is north.

>examine house
 A huge old house. Your late partner, Jacob Marley lived here until he
 died, and you have lived here ever since. You keep a small suite of
 rooms on the first floor, having given the rest over to your nephew and
 his family -- but they are out of town visiting your brother for
 Christmas. They begged you to go with them, but you have your own
 plans: you always visit the Cratchits for Christmas, and this year you
 have a most particular reason to keep that appointment.

 You catch a strange, sweet smell, carried on the mist.

>smell
 A cold mist licks around the courtyard, smelling of damp and smoke --
 and some other scent too, a sickly, cloying smell that you cannot quite
 place.

>go north
 (opening the door)
 (unlocking the door)
 As you push the door open and enter, you stop for a moment to look at
 the knocker. Who knows why, for you see it every day -- morning and
 evening, and it is unremarkable enough. But you can't forget how, on
 this very evening a decade ago, you saw it transformed into the very
 image of your late partner Jacob Marley: the first of the very strange
 and disconcerting events of that wonderfully disconcerting night.

 So you glance at the knocker now, and you are shocked to see it, again,
 assume a once-familiar appearance. But this time the face is not
 Marley's, but almost your own, though one you have not seen for twenty,
 even thirty, years. It is the face of your brother, Mordecai.

 Shivering slightly (whether from the cold, or the disconcerting
 behaviour of your door knocker, you could not say) you go through the
 door, light the candle that stands ready on the hall table, lock the
 door carefully behind you and climb the wide staircase to your chamber.

 Bedroom
 A leopard never quite changes its spots, and your bedroom is still
 plain by most standards, but that is how you like it. Nevertheless, you
 allow yourself a few hints of comfort if not luxury. The heavy green
 brocade curtains are closed. Your table has a few papers on it. Your
 bed is ready for you. The door, leading east, is closed.

>examine papers
 The papers are scattered on the table. You really should talk to
 Lucinda about cleaning up -- since she has been walking out with the
 Jameson boy she has become quite distracted.The only one of any moment
 is the letter you received this morning from your attorneys.

>open curtains
 You open the curtains, revealing a window.

 Jarboe & Bungay
 45 New Square
 Lincoln's Inn

 23rd December 1853

 My Dear Mr Scrooge,

 As presently drawn, your will leaves your whole estate to your
 brothers, and their issue. In practical terms, that means to your
 nephew and (if he still lives) your brother Mordecai.

 We understand that you wish to amend the provisions of your will. Mr
 Robert Cratchit is to become a partner in the firm of Scrooge & Marley,
 and he is to inherit the partnership absolutely, the rest of your
 estate passing to your nephew.

 We have accordingly prepared a revised will and partnership deed. If
 you would be good enough to raise the matter with Mr Cratchit, we look
 forward to seeing you on the twenty-seventh of this month, at our
 offices, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, where the documents can be
 executed.

 I beg to remain, Sir, your obedient and humble servant,

 Wm Jarboe.

>examine window
 The glass is lightly glazed with frost, but you can just see through it
 into the darkened yard.

 Late as it is, you think you hear footsteps outside the window.

>take letter
 You take the letter.

 You can definitely hear voices: indistinct, but it sounds like an old
 man and a young man.

>listen to window
 You hear low voices in the yard, though it's hard to make out most of
 what they say.

 Outside the window, a coarse, sly old voice. "You lad, where are you
 going?"

>examine window
 The glass is lightly glazed with frost, but you can just see through it
 into the darkened yard.

 It's hard to make out more than a few words: something about "Mr
 Scrooge" and "the compliments of the season".

>listen
 You hear low voices in the yard, though it's hard to make out most of
 what they say.

 The older man says something, but you can't make it out.

>look

 Bedroom
 The heavy green brocade curtains are open. Your table has a few papers
 on it. Your bed is ready for you. The door, leading east, is closed.

 The younger voice is raised indignantly, and you catch a few words --
 "mistaken ... kind gentleman". Suddenly you recognise the voice: It is
 Bob Cratchit's son, Tiny Tim.

>listen to voices
 You can't see any such thing.

>open door
 You open the bedroom door.

>sleep
 You wouldn't be able to sleep with this queer conversation going on
 outside.

 The old man is talking: "... grasping ... miserly ... I have found him
 out ..."

>listen
 You hear low voices in the yard, though it's hard to make out most of
 what they say.

 The old man is talks, low and secretive. You can make out few words --
 "Jarboe" perhaps and "visit". How can he know about Mr Jarboe's visit
 to you?

>open window
 You open the window slowly and carefully, hoping not to be noticed. You
 can hear the voices in the yard better now.

 Tiny Tim's voice, quite clear: "Yes, Sir, I know that he visited, for
 my father told me of his visit."

>listen
 You hear the voices in the yard, still talking.

 "Now, my boy, you must be more careful. He told you that he visited,
 but I wager you he did not tell you the purpose of that visit. I wager
 you that.

>shiver
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>again
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>listen
 You hear the voices in the yard, still talking.

 "Indeed he did not, and we all wondered what it might be!"

>listen
 You hear the voices in the yard, still talking.

 "Well, I can tell you. He intends to sell his business. Lock, stock,
 and barrel. Hook, line, and sinker. Every contract, every note, every
 bill drawn on London and every bill drawn on Petersburg. All to be sold
 to a consortium -- that is to say to a bunch, young man -- to a bunch
 of Italians from Leghorn. A bunch of Italians who will show your father
 the door soon as you can say 'Merry Christmas'."

>wait
 Time passes.

 Young Tim's voice, clear as a bell: "Is there nothing that can be done
 to stop him?"

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Ah, my lad. Now I knew that you were a smart boy. An intelligent young
 man. A young man with his head screwed on. Of course there's something
 that can be done."

>sit on bed
 You get into the bed.

 The old man reaches his hand into his pocket, and hands something to
 Tim Cratchit.

>jump
 You jump on the spot.

 "That little bottle is a remarkable concoction. A miracle of science,
 young man. The work of the great Doctor Faustus from Berlin. A drop of
 this in a man's drink will drive out the spirit of miserliness, and
 drive in the spirit of Christmas. If you could slip it into his drink
 tomorrow, the problem will be solved."

>examine bottle
 The bottle is no more than an inch or two long, and contains a greenish
 liquid -- the colour of chartreuse.

 "Very well, Sir," you hear the Cratchit boy say, "I will do it."

>stand
 You get out of the bed.

 Bedroom
 The heavy green brocade curtains are open. Your table has a few papers
 on it. Your bed is ready for you. The door is open to the east.

 "Now you be sure that Mr Scrooge doesn't see it, my boy. He's as sly as
 a rat, and he'll know directly what it is and not take the bait. Let
 this be our little secret."

>read bottle
 The glass bottle is outside. Just watch and listen.

 "You'll thank me for this, my boy, This will be our little secret. And
 in time you will thank me for it. Indeed, my lad, you will."

 The voices fade.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You feel very tired. It is time to go to sleep.

>sleep
 You blow out the candle, and get into bed then settle down to go to
 sleep.


 [Press Any Key]








 You wake with a start. What is it that woke you? Perhaps only the
 church bell, chiming ... one ... two ... three-quarters ... no, the
 hour. One o'clock. You sit up in bed, alert as a cat before a
 mousehole.

>look

 Bedroom (in the bed)
 The heavy green brocade curtains are open. Your table has a few papers
 on it and a number of other objects besides. The door, leading east, is
 closed.

 The door creaks open, and light -- as of a giant candle -- floods the
 room. And there, on the threshold, he stands. A spirit you have not
 seen for ten years, and yet familiar to you: the Ghost of Christmas
 Past.

>talk to ghost
 "I know you, spirit," you say. "I remember you."

 "I am the spirit of Christmas past. Your past!"

>wait
 Time passes.

>talk to ghost
 "What is it you have come to show me?" you ask.

 "I am here to show you a beginning," says the ghost. "We are going to
 trace a noxious river to its poisoned source."

>talk to ghost
 "What must I do, then?"

 "Just walk through the door."

 "What? I can tell you what is outside the door: nothing but my own
 staircase, up which I climbed not much more than an hour ago!"

 "So you may think," the spirit says enigmatically. "But you might be
 surprised."

>again
 The spirit stays silent, and merely gestures towards the door.

 The spirit gestures towards the door.

>go south
 (getting out of bed)
 You can't go that way. The door is east.

 The spirit gestures towards the door.

>go east
 The spirit ushers you through the door. But you feel yourself changed,
 diminished somehow. And instead of the staircase, you find yourself in
 a quite different place -- a room once just as well-known, but which
 you have not thought about these many years.

 Parlour
 Your mother's parlour, a cosy little room, spotlessly clean and
 smelling of wax and lavender. Sunlight is splashing bright patterns on
 the rug. Your mother is resting on her chaise longue.

 A wooden box lies on the rug.

 Your mother has kicked off her shoes, which lie beside the sofa.

>examine box
 A wooden box, about as long as your arm, and half as wide. There are
 letters burned into it. Because you are your mother's clever boy, you
 can read those letters. "E. PEEN: TOYMAKER". Your mother has given this
 box to you for Christmas, because you have been good all year. The box
 is closed.

>examine shoes
 Your mother's brown leather walking shoes.

>take shoes
 You take your mother's shoes.

>wear shoes
 Although it can hardly be said that they fit well, it gives you a
 remarkable sense of confidence to walk in your mother's shoes. You feel
 unaccountably stronger, faster, fleeter of foot.

>open box
 You open the wooden box, revealing your toy hammer, your wooden peg and
 your wooden saw.

>get hammer, peg and saw
 You take the wooden saw, the wooden peg and the toy hammer.

>examine saw, peg and hammer
 A tiny saw, made of wood. Not much good for cutting, of course -- but
 you can pretend to cut things. Today you have already pretended to cut
 a tree, your mother's plants, a table leg and your sister's arm.

 The door opens, and a boy -- dressed just as you are in a sailor suit
 -- comes in: your twin brother, Mordecai.
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine mordecai
 To a superficial glance -- or indeed, to even the most penetrating
 inspection by anyone other than your family -- there is no difference
 whatever between you and Mordecai. Not physically; but morally, in
 spirit, as souls -- you could not be more different.

 Mordecai comes over. "I want that hammer, Ben," he says. "Give it to me
 now!"

>smell mordecai
 You smell nothing unexpected.

>hit mordecai with hammer
 You know there is no point. Mordecai is your twin, but he is stronger
 than you, and faster than you, and more resolute than you.

 Mordecai grabs the hammer from you. "Mine!" he says.

 "No, Mordecai, it is mine. Mother gave it to me. I have been a good boy
 all year. You have not."

 "Good boys get given presents. Bad boys take them!"

>wake mom
 You can't see any such thing.

>wake mother
 You should let her sleep. She needs to rest.

 Mordecai advances towards you with his hammer held high. "Now I have
 taken this," he says, "you must give me all your toys. You must do as I
 say or I will beat you and smash you, you vile boy." As he says those
 words "vile boy" he sounds just like Father. That is just what Father
 always says.

>give saw to mordecai
 Mordecai takes the wooden saw with an acquisitive glint in his eye.
 "Mine now!" he giggles.

 Mordecai brings the hammer crashing down on your head, with a crack.
 For a moment you feel nothing. Then you find yourself on the floor.
 Your face is sticky, and your mouth tastes of sweet iron. Your brother,
 as usual, has made himself scarce.

>remove mordecai's left leg with a bit
 You can't see any such thing.

>look

 Parlour
 Your mother's parlour, a cosy little room, spotlessly clean and
 smelling of wax and lavender. Sunlight is splashing bright patterns on
 the rug. Your mother is resting on her chaise longue.

 A wooden box lies on the rug.

 Your mother stirs, and wakes. She looks down at you, and shrieks. "What
 on earth has happened, little Ben?" she says. "What have you done? Your
 face is covered in blood!"

>tell mother about mordecai
 To converse in this game, use TALK TO [PERSON] (though in certain
 special situations, when you are asked a specific question, YES and NO
 could be useful).

>talk to mother
 You sob.

 Your mother gathers you up in her arms. You feel her tears mixing with
 yours, and with the blood that covers your face. You turn to kiss her.
 As your lips touch her cheek she seems to liquify, like wax at a candle
 wick. And with her everything in the room seems to liquify too: chaise,
 rug, toys, all pouring away, until there is just you, and the spirit,
 in an empty room.

 Parlour
 Still, apparently, your mother's parlour -- or at least a room its
 size, and its shape, and with its window and door; but sadly altered.
 Dust and shadows have spread themselves thickly on every surface, and
 crept into every corner. The furniture is gone -- the floor bare apart
 from the rug, which incongruously remains. The door is west.

 The ghost of Christmas past stands in the middle of the room.

>talk to mum
 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to ghost
 "What has happened? Where has my mother gone?"

 "You have grown up, Ebenezer. The world is a little colder, emptier.
 You are on your own."

>again
 "Why, then, are we still here?"

 "We are tracing the evil to its source," the spirit says. "A little
 childhood bullying is hardly evil; but that was not the end of it for
 Mordecai, was it?"

 And you shake your head, because you know he is right.

>again
 Ths spirit simply watches you in silence.

>get all
 There are none at all available!

>say no
 You mutter to yourself.

 The spirit gestures towards the door. "Some things are best left in the
 past," he says. "I wish I could show you happier moments; for there
 were many happier moments, were there not? But tonight my task is to
 warn. Let us go!"

>score
 There is no score in this game.

>go door
 That's not a place you have been.

>exit

 As you step towards the door, you feel the room you are leaving
 dissolve into shadow, and the spirit with it. No way back now. You must
 return (you know it) to the present -- or at least to some possible
 version of the present. You are half expecting the sight that next
 meets your eyes ...

 Bedroom
 Your room is transformed. The ceiling is hung with great boughs of
 holly, the berries glistening in the light of hundreds of candles. All
 around the room are piles of wonderful food: hams, great roasts, gilded
 turkies, piles of sugar plums and oranges, chocolates and candy-canes.
 A vast table is set with a white damask cloth, laden with dishes. In
 the midst of this a man with a deep green robe and a vast beard
 reclines on your bed, his head surrounded by a garland of ivy: the
 ghost of Christmas present.

 The ghost of Christmas present lounges on your bed, bathed in brilliant
 sunlight from the canopy.

>talk to ghost
 "I recognise you, spirit," you say. "You are the Ghost of Christmas
 Past. I remember meeting you -- ten years ago now, and the good you did
 me then."

 "Not I," replies the giant, "for I can be here just one Christmastide,
 and never again; but one of my brothers no doubt."

>examine giant
 A giant of a man, with ruddy cheeks, chestnut curls and an auburn
 beard. He's wearing a green velvet robe, trimmed with ermine.

>examine food
 Everything is set as if for a feast; it all looks quite delicious.

>eat
 (the bed)
 (taking the bed)
 The bed is fixed in place.

>eat food
 Somehow you hand passes straight through, and yet your soul seems
 nourished.

 "Spiritual food brings spiritual sustenance," the Ghost says.
 "Tomorrow, my dear Ebenezer, you can eat your fill."

>talk to ghost
 "Why are you here? I am a changed man. There's not a man in London more
 devoted to you than I am. I have no further need of your help."

 "So you might think," the spirit replies. "But you do need my help
 tonight: not to save you, this time, from yourself; but to save you,
 and others, from harm."

 The spirit beckons you towards his robe.

>examine robe
 A giant of a man, with ruddy cheeks, chestnut curls and an auburn
 beard. He's wearing a green velvet robe, trimmed with ermine.

>talk to ghost
 "What sort of harm, spirit? And what should I do?"

 "I will show you," says the Ghost. "Touch my robe, and I will show
 you."

>touch robe
 As your hand brushes the spirit's robe, he takes you firmly by the
 hand. He opens the window, and, safe in his firm grasp you are launched
 headlong into the air.

 You soar over tightly-packed streets through a grey London dawn.

 A street in Camden
 Frost glistens on the flagstones, and on the identical doorsteps of the
 identical houses in this neatly nondescript street. You stand outside
 number 17. Cast iron railings surround a basement area, painted black
 like every other house; a neat front door and whitened step. It is the
 house where your clerk, Bob Cratchit, lives with his family. The great
 City lies to the south. Steps lead down to the basement area.

 Someone has dropped a sixpenny piece on the ground.

>examine piece
 A silver sixpence.

>take piece
 You take the sixpence.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a sixpence

>examine me
 You feel strange, pinched, dreary and angry. You seem to be wearing a
 shabby coat and a shabby hat (not at all in your usual style) and a
 strange smell lingers about you.

>smell me
 You smell odd: a sickly sweetness -- like meat that has started to turn
 -- lingers about your person.

>examine hat
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine coat

 Basement yard
 Like so many London houses, Bob Cratchit's is set half-down into the
 ground, with a dingy basement yard with space to store coal, and ash,
 and rubbish. Overlooking this dreary scene is the window of what you
 know is the kitchen, although it's so covered in thick frost that you
 can't see anything through it at the moment.

 The spirit stands just behind you.

>stand behind spirit
 I only understood you as far as wanting to stand.

>rub window
 You rub at the frost. It burns your hands, but you manage to clear a
 small area, through which you can peep.

 a small area that you have rubbed clear.

>look through window
 You look into the Cratchits' kitchen. It is set for Christmas, with
 various delicacies arrayed on the table. Beyond it is a door through
 which you can see into the back parlour.

 As you watch, you see a young man come in. It is Tiny Tim.

 Tim ladles two generous helpings of the punch into pewter mugs, and
 carries them through to the room beyond.

>examine cratchit
 Which do you mean, Bob Cratchit,  or Tiny Tim?

>examine men
 Certainly you, come round no doubt to wish Bob the compliments of the
 season and to have a glass of wine and some lunch with him.

 The two men in the parlour raise their mugs. Oddly you have a
 premonition of what is to follow. More oddly still, instead of willing
 yourself to drop the mug on the floor, or throw it in the fire, you
 find yourself hoping that you will drink it. You find yourself taking
 positive pleasure in what you know will be a disaster. It is as if you
 are not yourself. As if you are a second version of yourself, and wish
 yourself harm.

>examine men
 Certainly you, come round no doubt to wish Bob the compliments of the
 season and to have a glass of wine and some lunch with him.

 The draught takes its effect. You and Bob look to be in excruciating
 agony. You grasp at your throats, tear at your collars and neckscarves,
 as the fatal liquid tears at your bowels. And yet you, Ebenezer
 Scrooge, watch your own death-pangs not merely dispassionately, but
 with positive delight.

>examine men
 A terrible sight -- and yet, for some reason, strangely compelling to
 you.

 You and Bob lie quite still now. Anyone who knows death could say,
 instantly, that you are both quite dead. And watching this you feel not
 (as you should, as you know you should) horrified at your own demise
 and at the painful death of a beloved friend, but elated.

 You can't see any such thing.

 special situations, when you are asked a specific question, YES and NO

>enter window
 That's not something you can enter.

 Above you, you hear the front door open then slam shut. A limping step
 works its way down to the street; you hear the tapping of a crutch as
 the steps recede.

>look inside
 (the frosty window)
 Mrs Cratchit's tidy kitchen is empty. Beyond it you can see into the
 back parlour. Two corpses lie there: your own, and Bob Cratchit's.

 The steps fade into the distance.

>examine me
 You feel strange, pinched, dreary and angry. You seem to be wearing a
 shabby coat and a shabby hat (not at all in your usual style) and a
 strange smell lingers about you.

 The spirit reaches towards you and touches you. As he does so you watch
 his arm shrivel, his robe darken. Before long you find yourself looking
 at a different ghost altogether -- a loose grey robe with a great cowl,
 which completely obscures the features of whoever, or whatever, is
 within. Only two piercing dark eyes, unblinking, give assurance (no,
 not so much assurance, "warrant" then) that the figure is more than a
 great empty sack. The ghost of Christmas future leans on a long,
 slender staff of bone or ivory, gripping it with a talon-like gloved
 hand.

 A street in Limehouse
 Dusk is falling on the tightly-packed warehouses, taverns and
 doss-houses of Limehouse. To the south you can hear the gentle slapping
 of the river, the creaking of wet timber on piers and jetties. In this
 insalubrious alley, windows are either boarded or broken, or caked with
 dirt. To the west is an open doorway hung with red and gold lanterns,
 and painted with a dragon.

 You are aware of the shade as a dim presence beside you.

 The man is Chinese. He's dressed in a sailor's fashion in cotton duck
 trousers and a rough shirt. He is muscular, self-possessed. He's
 reading a magazine.

>examine magazine
 A copy of Doom, issue III. A popular magazine, which contains lurid
 accounts of horrible murders and railway accidents, and even more lurid
 ghost stories. The man appears to have been engrossed in an account of
 a mining explosion. There is a picture (very fanciful, to your way of
 thinking) of a canary being lowered in a cage to see if there is gas in
 the mine.

>talk to chinaman
 "What is this place?" you ask.

 The attendant looks at you suspiciously, and puts his magazine aside.
 "Who's asking? This is a private residence; the private residence of Mr
 Chu. Mr Chu is having a party for a few friends." You do not believe
 him.

 "I'm not a magistrate," you say.

 now remember) you still have the coin you found outside Bob Cratchit's

 "Don't waste my time, Sir, with gossip. If you want to go in, go in. If

 Inside an opium den
 A cavernous room, full of nooks and crannies, lit only by a brazier and
 a few oil lamps. All around the room people are lying. A thick, sickly
 smoke hangs over them, rising from the long opium pipes that each is
 smoking. A deep, stupefying torpor pervades everything. Time slowed to
 a crawl, reality replaced with phantoms and visions: the addicts are
 here, but not here; half alive in the half light.

 You are aware of the shade as a dim presence beside you.

>examine addicts
 Most of them seem to be deeply asleep. Occasionally they stir
 themselves, or mutter, or wake briefly to take deep breaths of the long
 pipes that lie beside them. Amidst them all, there is a face that, to
 your horror, you recognise. Beside the filthy mattress, not just a pipe
 but a crutch. And upon it, emaciated, filthy, Tiny Tim.

>examine tim
 Tiny Tim is still small, but he has aged terribly. His hair is thin and
 greasy. He skin is sallow, and hangs off him. His eyes -- once so
 bright and hopeful -- are glazed. He lies, wearing nothing but a filthy
 shirt much too big for him, on a filthy mattress, with a pipe
 smouldering beside him

>wake tim
 He wakes up, and looks at you as if he has seen a ghost. "Have you
 come," he says, "for revenge!

 Tim looks at you in terror and shame. "How am I cursed for my terrible
 deeds," he says. "You and my father! Both dead! And by my hand!"

>talk to tim
 "But why did you do it?" you ask.

 "You have to believe me, whatever spirit or creature you are, I did not
 do it out of malice, but out of ignorance. A man -- now, curse him, my
 tormentor, beguiled me to do it. How I wish I had not; but I did it in
 the hope only of helping my father."

 ignorance, and not out of evil."

 "But yet I did it," he says, "and it cannot be undone. So here I try to
 forget a little, and wait for kind death to bring a forgetfulness that
 will never pass."

 The spirit reaches a hand towards you -- not so much a hand, as a claw
 -- little more than bones in a dark glove. It wraps you in its cloak,
 which smells like earth and mould. The earth begins to fill your mouth.
 You choke; you wake. The spirit shrinks, and hardens, and you find
 yourself staring at -- nothing more sinister than your own bedpost.

 Jarboe & Bungay
 45 New Square
 Lincoln's Inn

 23rd December 1853

 My Dear Mr Scrooge,

 As presently drawn, your will leaves your whole estate to your
 brothers, and their issue. In practical terms, that means to your
 nephew and (if he still lives) your brother Mordecai.

 We understand that you wish to amend the provisions of your will. Mr
 Robert Cratchit is to become a partner in the firm of Scrooge & Marley,
 and he is to inherit the partnership absolutely, the rest of your
 estate passing to your nephew.

 We have accordingly prepared a revised will and partnership deed. If
 you would be good enough to raise the matter with Mr Cratchit, we look
 forward to seeing you on the twenty-seventh of this month, at our
 offices, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, where the documents can be
 executed.

 I beg to remain, Sir, your obedient and humble servant,

 Wm Jarboe.

>get all
 But the table is fixed in place.

>time
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory

>get package,key,candle,letter
 You take the letter, the candle, the door key and the package.

>examine package
 You picked it up from the engravers yesterday. The package is about six
 inches wide, and eight inches long, wrapped in brown paper and tied
 with string. The label on it reads "E Scrooge Esq, to await
 collection". It's rather heavy.

 The yard is bright underneath the Christmas sun.

 On Christmas morning! Certainly not. You must be up and about and on
 your way to Bob's.

>go east
 You leave your room, and head down the staircase, out of the front
 door, picking up a Christmas card that has been delivered while you
 were asleep, and off towards Camden, where you are bidden to celebrate
 the day with the Cratchits.

 Smithfield
 Smithfield Market is uncharacteristically quiet this morning, though
 the debris everywhere bears testament to the busy day that was had here
 yesterday, as all the sides of beef and pork, all the hams, all the
 geese and turkeys and ducks that London required to celebrate the day
 were carted around by the porters. Now there are just families in their
 best clothes, walking to church, or back from church, or off the the
 bakehouse with their roasts ready for the oven. The City itself lies to
 the south, but your way is to the north, up through Clerkenwell towards
 King's cross.

 Some way ahead of you is a man who seems vaguely familiar.

>examine man
 It's hard to say from this distance, but he is definitely wearing an
 astrakhan coat, with a low hat pulled down low over his head. He seems
 to be heading north.

 Cratchit"

>go north

 King's Cross
 You cannot accustom yourself to Mr Brunel's vast railway terminus. It
 is a hideously plain construction, as if some vast mill had crept here
 from Manchester or Huddersfield or Bradford and sat itself down on the
 edge of the City, like a charmless squatter.

 You are no fuddy-duddy; but it astonishes you to think that young
 people take for granted the ability to make in just hours journeys that
 used to take days. Your first trip to London, as a young apprentice,
 was partly by horse, partly on foot. It took you four days; now you
 could complete it in three hours. Today, however, for once, it is
 silent; just a few people like you hurrying to luncheon appointments.

 Your way lies to the west of the station.

 The man you saw in Smithfield is still ahead of you, and heading west
 himself.

 You can see a man here.

>examine man
 It's hard to say from this distance, but he is definitely wearing an
 Astrakhan coat, with a low hat pulled down low over his head, and you
 are more and more certain that it is Mordecai. He is walking west.

>examine terminus
 A brand new looking yellow-brick barn, already stained with soot,
 London terminus of the Great Western Railway.

>go northeast
 You need to head west, since the clock on the station already tells you
 that you are some quarter of an hour behind yourself. By railway time!

 A street in Saint Pancras
 The journey to Cratchit's is a Grand Tour of Railway Station
 architecture, and here we pass from Yorkshire Monolithic to the
 Classical. Euston Arch stands ahead, guarding the Euston Railway
 Terminus. Sooty, dirty, under this thin winter English sun it looks
 nothing at all like you imagine the Parthenon to be (when -- and it is
 rarely indeed -- you give any thought to such things); or rather it
 looks quite exactly and forlornly like some exotic Greek goddess
 transported in her indecent shift to spend the winter in the London
 sleet. Opposite it the goddess's older sister, St Pancras New Church,
 shivers just as uncomfortably. Your way lies north now, towards Camden
 and Bob Cratchit's house.

 The suspicious man in the astrakhan coat is still in sight. He does
 not, as by now you half expected him to, head north, but disappears
 into an alley to the northeast.

>examine house
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine arch
 A moment of misanthropic delight seizes you as you look at the great
 thing, dumped down like a great exotic beast in the middle of the
 London suburbs. What can they have been thinking, those men of business
 -- directors of the Railway Company -- to have commissioned and paid
 for it? You have not bought any shares in any railway companies, and
 you do not intend to do so, if this is how they would waste your money.

>examine church
 You do not hold with these odd temples. Spires and towers, in the old
 style, homely and undesigned -- that is how churches should be. And
 although you have shed, these last ten years, many of your old habits,
 you cannot help feeling a pang of disgust at the wastefulness of the
 money spent on something so unnecessarily ugly -- so unnecessary,
 period. You allow yourself (under your breath) a brief "Bah, humbug!"

>go northwest
 You can't go that way.

>go northeast

 Alleyway, near St Pancras
 Jerry-built tenements close in all sides of this blind alley. Here,
 there is no sign of Christmas cheer; just grimy windows, unwashed
 doorsteps, scraps and trash thrown anywhere in the street. You can see
 nobody at all; the place is quite deserted. The only way out is
 southwest.

>examine trash
 The detritus of London life.

>examine windows
 This is an awful looking district. You shudder to think what depravity
 lurks within the high yellow-grey houses.

 Cratchit's house.

>go north

 A street in Camden
 The flagstones are covered in frost, and on the identical doorsteps of
 the identical houses in this neatly nondescript street. You stand
 outside number 17. Cast iron railings surround a basement area, painted
 black like every other house; a neat front door and whitened step. It
 is the house where your clerk, Bob Cratchit, lives with his family. The
 great City lies to the south. Steps lead down to the basement area.

 Someone has dropped a sixpenny piece on the ground.

>get sixpenny
 You take the sixpence.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a candle
   a Christmas card
   a door key
   a letter
   a package
   a sixpence

>go down
 Down to the basement? But why? You are a guest, and a gentleman, and
 the front door is the door for you.

>knock
 (the door)
 The door opens, and Bob Cratchit opens it. "Merry Christmas, Mr
 Scrooge", he says. "You must be half frozen. Come in and warm by the
 fire downstairs." He leads you through a tidy hall, down some
 precipitous steps and into the back parlour. "Come and join me in a
 glass of punch, Sir," he says.


 The Cratchits' back parlour
 There is, of course, a front parlour; but it is more or less kept for
 weddings, christenings, funerals and the reception of grand, august,
 unfamiliar and official visitors. But you are an old friend, for whom
 the cosy back parlour will do much better.

 A bright, clear fire burns in the grate. Mrs Cratchit has followed the
 latest fashion, and a fir tree decorated with ribbons, tinsel, sugared
 almonds and paper snowflakes stands in one corner of the room.

 Mrs Cratchit's canary is in a cage in one corner of the room.

 Bob stands before the hearth.

>examine canary
 The little yellow bird is hopping around from perch to perch.

 "He's a queer little chap," says Bob, "and he's Mrs Cratchit's pride
 and joy. He gets up to all sorts of tricks. Would you believe it, he
 even likes a drop of sherry now and then, or a morsel of brandy. Mrs
 Cratchit will put it on her finger, and he just hops over and takes
 it."

 Mrs Cratchit's canary is in a cage in one corner of the room.

 Bob stands before the hearth.

 "Well now," says Bob, "let us have some punch to warm us while we wait
 for the ladies to return with lunch. Tim! Tim! Will you fetch us two
 glasses of claret cup from the bowl in the kitchen? And one for
 yourself if you care to join us."

 From the kitchen you hear Tim's reply, "Of course, father. I'll bring
 you some directly."

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Mrs Cratchit and the girls (or at least such of them as are not
 already married and at home with their husbands) are across the road
 visiting a friend. I'm sure they will be back soon, and dinner won't be
 long in the making," Bob explains.

>examine tree
 You have heard about these trees -- seen them in engravings in the
 papers, too -- but never seen one. Perhaps you are getting old, but the
 impression it leaves on you is not good. It is rather a short tree --
 hardly more than a sapling -- and it droops disconsolately in the heat
 of the fire. The decorations on it are pretty enough; but you cannot
 help preferring the more rough-and-ready decorations of your childhood
 (the mistletoe, the boughs of holly and wreaths of ivy) over this
 glittering teutonic import.

 Tim comes in, bearing two cups of claret cup in pewter tankards. He
 hands one to you, and one to his father.

>examine hearth
 Bob has heaped up a good warm coal fire in the black iron grate. It is
 burning hot and clear.

 Bob raises his mug. "A Merry Christmas, Mr Scrooge. And many more like
 them. Your very good health, Sir!"

>give punch to canary
 (your punch to the canary)
 You put a drop of punch on you finger and hold it through the bars. The
 little bird flutters down, and takes a drop. The effect is almost
 instantaneous. The bird shrieks, and falls over, stone dead.

 Bob looks concerned. "Oh my goodness me," he says, "what on earth is
 Mrs Cratchit going to say. I simply cannot understand it, the poor
 little thing is generally fond of a drop or two. What can have done
 it."

 Tim is even more anxious. "Oh Sir!" he says. "Do not drink a drop of
 that punch. I did not mean any harm, I swear; I only did what I thought
 best. I meant to hurt nobody."

 The whole story comes out then. How Tim met a stranger, who told him
 that by putting a drop of a strange, green liquid in the punch he would
 prevent disaster befalling his family; how he did as he was told,
 expecting nothing but good to come of it.

 And so the story ends. Bob becomes a partner in the firm; Tim is saved
 from a life of addiction and misery. And Mordecai? Well, who knows. You
 like to think that he saw his plan fail. You would like to think that
 he repented and reformed; but whatever his fate, at least ...

 6/12N)

 Smokey Garage (on the steel chair)
 You are tied hands and feet to this cold chair, a pool of water
 freezing under you. A thin layer of smoke dances on the floor.

 You always knew you were going to die, sooner or later. What you hoped
 for, though, was that your pants weren't the only thing you worn.

 Three scugnizzi are looking at you, inexpressive smiles on their faces.

 Rudolph Mancini is here, cleaning his nails with a knife.

>examine me
 You're carrying nothing. You are wearing your pants.

 "You know, I'm not the kind of Vito Corleone", says Rudolph Mancini. He
 keeps picking at his nails with the knife, avoiding eye contact. "I'm
 really not into Vito Corleone's methods."

 You feel a bit relieved.

>examine scugnizzi
 Johnny, Tony and Zachary. Their suits cost more than your car. They
 wear all the same model of sunglasses. Their faces have been cut in the
 same places. It's sad those butt-mushes are the last things you will be
 seeing.

 "I'm more of the Micheal type, you know."

 Something cold drops in your stomach.

 "All those loyalties, the Honor -- with the capital H --, the Family...
 I found those being just a loss of time. And money."

>examine pants
 Your most beloved light-blue boxers. On them, white dolphins jump
 cheerful.

 "One has to come to terms with the fact that, sooner or later, if you
 don't keep your dogs well chained... well, they tend to bite you. Do
 you get it?"

 As he lifts his face from the knife and its carving, you feel your
 balls retracting, like the head of a slug. Mancini sends a glance at
 Tony, the bigger of his scugnizzi, and another bucketful of gelid water
 splashes on your head and torso.
 This time, it takes you almost a minute to recover.

 The pool at your feet is becoming the more and more solid.

>examine dolphins
 Your most beloved light-blue boxers. On them, white dolphins jump
 cheerful.

 "You are not going to get a cold, do you?"

 You stare at Mancini's eyes, finally turned at you. You try to hold the
 shivers.

 "Cause that would spoil all the fun, you know. You dying of a goddamn
 cold." A burst of laughter, copycatted by the three scugnizzi. "Let's
 get back to the point. You understand what I'm trying to make clear,
 here?"

 You silently nod.

>talk to mancini
 It's lecture time.

 "That door. Man, there were not many rules, weren't they? You did open
 that door, did you?"

 Another glance to the sidekicks, and another splash of water. Then,
 Zachary leaves and comes back, what it looks like a big, portable radio
 in his left hand. On the right one, two electrical wires dangle like
 hangmen.

 You feel your sight begin to blur.

 Then, it all goes black.

 of this corridor. The wallpaper is old and scratched, pieces of it
 ripped aside like thorn skin. The place is very different from the rest

 The spacious abode is filled by light coming from the ample windows.

 Narrow Gangway
 A multitude of tiny portraits, pictures and drawings hangs on the walls
 of this corridor. The wallpaper is old and scratched, pieces of it
 ripped aside like thorn skin. The place is very different from the rest
 of the affluent mansion.

 A door leaves the house to the north, while two more open to the west
 and south. A staircase climbs upstairs to the second floor.

 Another small, wooden door stands at the side of the stairs, leading
 downstairs.

 Kitchen
 A small room, no space left for a table or anything. Just a stove, the
 burners and a sink.

 A dumbwaiter cuts an empty rectangle in the east wall.

 On the counter beside the burners sits a bowl of fresh fruit.

 Grandma Elisella is here, tending to the kitchen.

 The sight of the old lady still gives you mixed feelings after all
 these years. You have been one of the Mancinis for a long time, as long
 as you can recall. Still, her frigid glance is something you can't
 quite digest. She has always had that way of making you feel a lesser
 part of the brood. Like being adopted was a sort of handicap.

>examine fruit
 Oranges and apples, mostly.

>take fruit
 Taken.

>examine woman
 A very old woman, Elisella is Rudolph and Gianni's mother. Once her
 husband Fortunato has died, she ended up in the kitchen, where she
 passes the days alongside garlic and olive oil. You can't tell how much
 of her fate was her to choose rather than imposed by her sons.

>examine dumbwaiter
 There is only a button, on which an arrow points downwards. You wonder
 where does this go to.

 You're carrying a bowl of fruit, a copy of Doom III and a gun. You are
 wearing a pair of trousers and a worn shirt.

>put gun in dumbwaiter

>put apple in dumbwaiter
 You send the fruits downstairs, and wait.

 A minute later, the bowl returns, empty. A strong curiosity about where
 it has been fills you, as you grab it.

 A door leaves the house to the north, while two more open to the west

 Another small, wooden door stands at the side of the stairs, leading
 downstairs.

>go down
 You still tremble at the thought of what Don Mancini would do of you if
 he caught you down there... but the curiosity is too much. You open the
 door and dive into darkness.

 (first opening the door to the cellars)
 Cellars
 A damp underground room, stone-paved and stone-walled.

 A few steps upwards, and there stands the wooden door.

 A bulky, metal door stands on the eastern wall, held by strong hinges
 like those of a castle's drawbridge.

 A mumbling of sorts comes from behind the bulky door.

>listen
 It is a woman's -- or rather a girl's -- voice, coming from behind the
 door.

>listen to voice
 It is a woman's -- or rather a girl's -- voice, coming from behind the
 door.

>talk to the bulky
 You knock at the door and a tiny voice comes from beyond it. "Who's
 there? Zachary?"

 You clear your throat. "Who are you?" you ask, hesitantly.

 "Zachary? Please would you let me out? Please. I know you are a good
 person..."

 For a long minute you look at the door, speechless. Then: "I'm no Zach.
 My name is Cesco. Francesco Mancini. Who are you?"

 The person at the other side of the door, her soft voice still muted by
 the hulking door, comes rattling at it. "Francesco!" She cries.
 "Please, lemme outta here. Please! I did harm no one!"

 "Who are you?" you insist. Then, the girl starts to cry. "Hey madam",
 you comfort her, "don't cry. There's no need. You are safe here... I
 think--."

 Then, the obvious strikes you. "Have you been... have you been...
 taken?"

 It is funny how you fail in giving things their right name, after all
 this time in the Mob. The girl's been kidnapped, that's what it is. She
 speaks again, this time her voice seems more resolute. "I know a thing.
 Go where Zachary and the rest of the goons hold their accounts. You
 must have a place like that, in this house of horrors. Go there and
 look for a safe, or a drawer. Somewhere where Zachary keeps a blue
 notebook. You will find your answers there. Go."

 You stand by the door, still speechless. An image of the secret diary
 of the older scugnizzo forms in your head. The studio upstairs: that's
 where he keeps it. "I'll do", you say. Then, as you are about to leave
 the cellars, the same question jumps from your mouth, this time a
 little less vigorously. "Who... are you?"

 "I'm your cousin, Cesco. I'm Hellen."

 A shiver so dense you could cut it with a knife takes hold of you as
 you run through the stairs and out of here.

 Another small, wooden door stands at the side of the stairs, leading

>go up
 You climb the stairs two steps at a time, resolute in discovering more
 about the girl in the basement.

 Corridor
 One room interests you, on this floor. The studio, where Don Mancini
 uses to deal with his affairs and his minions, opens to the south.
 Stairways descend to the ground floor.

 It seems no one is in the house, at the moment. All is silent.

>go south

 Studio
 A vast room, mainly surrounded by bookshelves. All of the furniture is
 a mix of old and new, different styles mixing in a showcase-like
 pout-pourri. A massive chartreuse bureau catches you attention, his
 lower drawer left slightly open.

>examine drawer
 In the bottom drawer is a blue notebook.

>take notebook
 Taken.

>read notebook
 Inside the notebook you find some photos, depicting the most renowned
 adversaries of Rudolph Mancini. One of the pictures is clutched to a
 paper sheet. You recognize Zachary's handwriting.

 "Took the girl. Bossed Benelli. He didn't want to lay down. Had to lay
 him down. Put the girl in the cell. Asked Father. Said he will look up
 on it. Another 'sister'?".

 You stroll through the pages. On the very last one, another note bears
 a number, handwritten by Rudy himself: "4876".

>examine bureau
 It's gigantic proportions well suit Mancini's outstanding ego. The
 bottom drawer is open.

>examine furniture
 This room must have been designed by a fool or a madman. Or by one with
 a gargantuan Ego.

>examine bookshelves
 A ton of books, all fiction. Stephen King alongside Umberto Eco and --
 although it looks like a bad joke -- all Mario Puzo's. On the shelves
 even some of the fairy tales you used to read when a boy, like "Your
 Mum's Shoes", "My Enemy Tiny Tim" and "The Smell of my Evil Twin".

 Living Room
 The spacious abode is filled by light coming from the ample windows.
 Sofas and armchairs rest like kids around a fire, looking at the short
 table between them. A large fireplace dominates the northern wall.

 The wall-mounted Family's safe decors a square yard on the west wall.

>type 4876 on touchpad
 You type the number on the touchpad, and the safe unlocks and opens.

>examine safe
 A touchpad is the only visible detail on its surface. As far as you
 know, a four-digit code is required to open it. The safe is open,
 revealing a photo album and a large iron key.

 In the safe are a photo album and a large iron key.

>take album
 Taken.

>take key
 Taken.

>examine album
 You slowly turn each page of the album.

 The first are no more than ancient daguerrotypes of the Italian town
 from which the Mancinis came, more than one hundred years ago. Funny
 looking women wearing full black dresses and men in a hat. Then, as the
 pages go by, the pictures become younger and more vivid. Around the
 middle of the tome, you scout Rudolph Mancini with his family, a shot
 taken in the Fifties, all lined up like soldiers during the gathering
 -- he had personal records, somehow. Those go on for a few turnings of
 the page.

 Almost at the end, the photos change abruptly.

 These don't belong here. Other families. Some of the pictures are torn,
 other crippled. One, a shoot from the Eighties, is bloodstained and it
 catches your attention. It depicts a family you've seen many times,
 over the years. The Benellis. One branch of the family, the one
 spreading from Vittorio, the big one. He's brother to Vincente, the one
 Zachary must have put to rest these days. You stare at the pic, and a
 whole new world opens before you, while the old one opens below.

 The little kid, on a three wheeler. His eyes. That uncomfortable flock,
 which never stood where it should. And that t-shirt, with Pagliacci on
 it, the famous clown.

 "Hey, Clown", you hear Tony and Johnny call you, in your head. And all
 of a sudden, darkness enters the room.

 Hellen's voice comes from behind the bulky door, muted by its weight.

 A bulky, metal door stands on the eastern wall, held by strong hinges
 like those of a castle's drawbridge.

>unlock bulky door with key
 You unlock the bulky door.

>open bulky door
 You open the door. It gives with a nasty squeak. Halfway through its
 course it slams wide open, the young woman behind pushing it with all
 her strength.

 "Cesco!" she shouts, as she sees you. "I knew you were not dead. I knew
 God would answer my plea!"

 That said, she hugs you, trembling frantically. You let her do it, then
 slowly recede, looking into her eyes. "What has happened," you ask.
 "And why do you say you are my cousin?"

 "Because you are, Cesco." The last of the pictures in the album you
 found in the safe flashes in front of you. You can't fool yourself
 anymore. "I thought they killed you. How did they keep you secret, all
 these years?"

 "I was... in the house," you blush. Yes: for the last fourteen years,
 you were allowed to leave the mansion only once, and that was for
 taking your First Eucharist. That was going to be Hellen's same fate,
 if only you decided to stay upstairs, where you were supposed to stay.

 "Let's leave," you murmur, before grabbing Hellen by an arm and start
 rushing to the stairs. All my life, you think. I've been a convict all
 my goddamn life.

 You are still repeating the same thought, over and over, when you run
 through the corridors of the mansion. The same thought when you bang
 the front door and bathe in the winter's light.

 The same thought when Zachary, who was waiting for you outside, point
 his gun to your face. More than two hours later, it's still the same
 thought that accompanies you in your last, living day.
>look








 Smokey Garage (on the steel chair)
 You are tied hands and feet to this cold chair, a pool of water
 freezing under you. A thin layer of smoke dances on the floor.

 Three scugnizzi are looking at you, inexpressive smiles on their faces.

 Rudolph Mancini is here, cleaning his nails with a knife.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "That door. Man, there were not many rules, weren't they? You did open
>smile
 that door, did you?"

 Another glance to the sidekicks, and another splash of water. Then,
 Zachary leaves and comes back, what it looks like a big, portable radio
 in his left hand. On the right one, two electrical wires dangle like
 hangmen.

 You feel your sight begin to blur.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to man
 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to zachary
 You are bound by two nice chains.

 "Zach, teach him."

 The older of the scugnizzi sends a whiplash smile, then moves in your
 direction. He drops the device near you and starts it. A soundful
 engine begins roaring.

 That will mute my screams, you find yourself thinking.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Zach smiles again and then sticks one of the wires into your left
 nipple. You hardly suffocate a scream.

 Real pain has yet to come. You close your eyes.

>inventory
 You're carrying nothing. You are wearing your pants.

 The second wire is plugged on your other nipple. A whitening noise
 fills your ears and eyes as the electrical storm passes through you. It
 never ends: the holy daggers of the tempest cut through you for ages.

 You resist how much you can, then the screaming starts.

 You are about to surrender to the night when the wire is removed. It
 takes you a full minute to recover. When you are fully awake, you
 notice a small river of blood dripping from your left breastplate.

>l blood
 You can't see any such thing.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "So, son. You got something to say?" Mancini is teasing at you, the
 knife back into its cravings. You are about to ask if that will be what
 he will use to kill you, when a smile widens in your face. The
 scugnizzi rest speechless.

 "Yes," you say. "I've read a book recently. It was titled 'Silence of
 the Gods'. Do you know it?"

 Mancini formal smile disappears.

 "Talks about these superhumans who go around saving the world, you
 know. There is a paragraph, in the book, I really loved. It says: 'The
 Gods are not mute. If you can't hear their voice, it's because they
 spend a lot of time thinking'. Do you know what this means? It took
 some time, but in the end I think I got it."

 Zachary lifts the wires and sends a glance at Mancini. "Guess he needs
 one more, whaddaya think, padre?".

 "It means," you go on, "that if something has been working for a very
 long time, it doesn't mean it will work forever. Do you understand?"

 "I'm not following you," Mancini replies. His voice is stale.

 "You will, soon enough."

 It's in that very second that the door is crushed and four men enter
 the garage. Zach and Tony turn around just in time to see two bullets
 each piercing their skull. Johnny tries the other side, but to no
 avail: One hits him in the leg and the next explodes into his chest
 like a carnival cracker. Mancini turns slowly and gets to face an old
 man, maybe in his seventies.

 "You have killed my sons," the old man whispers, and in less than a
 second you recognize him. He was in the pic you found in the album.
 He's father to Vincente and Vittorio Benelli, and grandfather to
 Hellen. He is your grandfather. "I ain't lettin ya kill my grandsons,
 also."

 Behind him, you scout the fragile, yet stubborn form of Hellen. She is
 smiling, although her smile looks a bit cold. She winks to you, and in
 that wink you finally read an infinite levity.

 The Gods have listened, you think, smiling. They have listened and
 answered.



 And -- as you read in that book -- once the Gods have spoken, they have
 spoken.

 And their answer is ultimate.
