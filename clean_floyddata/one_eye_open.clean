 One Eye Open
 An Interactive Nightmare by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine
 Release 1 / Serial number 100929 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)


 After only ten days, you're becoming surprisingly comfortable with
 life as a Corona Corporation guinea pig.  It helps that your routine
 is so reliable - meals, exercise, rest, and sleep are clearly arranged
 on a schedule hanging beside the white clock in your room.  As for the
 tests - well, you've grown used to the sight of your blood in a sample
 vial, and the rest is mostly paperwork.  Personality tests, aptitude
 tests, intelligence tests, psychological tests, Rorschach and the MMPI
 and even kinetic family drawing... you're starting to worry that
 they'll run out of tests by the end of the month.

 Although 7:30 PM is always the day's last test, you never leave your
 room alone, so you were still watching American Beauty when Dr. Marnie
 Ephart knocked at the door.  "Oh, you're almost to the end!" she said
 brightly, seeing the screen.  "I can wait until you're through."

 "No, that's fine."  You hit PAUSE to freeze Angela in mid-motion as
 you got up from the couch.  "I've seen it before."  Last Monday,
 actually.  The video collection isn't that good, and, considering what
 they're paying you, it's a pity Corona couldn't invest in a few more
 options.  It's hard to complain, though; the staff is friendly, the
 tests aren't hard, and the salary is great.

 During the day, Raymond, Best, or one of the scientists might be
 around, but at night, it's usually just the two of you, and the hall
 you cross now is deserted.  You accompany her through the antechamber
 and into the main testing chamber.  By now, you're used to being
 watched from behind one-way glass, but the observational room is fully
 lit today, and you can easily see inside.

 "Back in a moment," Dr. Ephart says cheerfully.  "See you on the other
 side!"


 Test Chamber, Corona Labs
 In the center of the room, a single black office chair sits in front
 of a broad, heavy desk.  The desk and chair are familiar, but the
 wireless keypad sitting on the desk is new.  There are five large
 white buttons on the keypad, each displaying a different symbol in
 broad black strokes.  The symbols are a circle, a cross, a set of
 three wavy lines, a square, and a five-pointed star.  As always, you
 are quite aware of the cameras watching you from above.

 To the west, a windowless door separates the testing room from the
 antechamber outside.

 The familiar black office chair sits invitingly nearby.

 Through the thick pane of glass, you can see the curved desk in the
 observational room.


>sit in chair

 Through the thick pane of glass, you see Dr. Ephart come into the
 observational room carrying a stack of cards and a notebook.  She
 waves to you in friendly fashion, sets her notebook on the desk, and
 sits down before pressing the intercom button.

 "This is a different kind of test," Dr. Ephart explains.  "I have
 twenty-five cards here, each of which shows one of the symbols on your
 keypad."  She holds up five cards and fans them so you can see the
 circle, cross, wavy lines, square, and five-pointed star.  "I'm going
 to draw one of these cards and concentrate on the shape.  I want you
 to concentrate, to really focus your mind, and try to pick the same
 symbol that I do.  After you've decided on your symbol, press it on
 the keypad.  We'll do five of these."

 Dr. Ephart shuffles her cards together and draws the first card.  She
 holds the card up with its back to you.

>concentrate on card
 blue loops and a line drawing of a building.

 As you concentrate on the deck of cards, you get a dull headache.  For
 a moment, you think you see the cross superimposed on the back of the
 card, but then it is gone.

 nods unconsciously as she tucks her card back in the deck.

 Dr. Ephart shuffles her cards together and draws the second card.  She
 holds the card up with its back to you.

 at the front of the card.  You see the five-pointed star on the card.

 Dr. Ephart tilts her head to one side as she takes note of your
 response.

 Dr. Ephart shuffles her cards together and draws the third card.  She
 holds the card up with its back to you.

 and look at the card.  You clearly see the wavy lines on the back of
 the card before it swims out of sight.

 Ephart's lips curve slightly up as she writes something in her
 notebook.

 Dr. Ephart shuffles her cards together and draws the fourth card.  She
 holds the card up with its back to you.

>concentrate on card
 Staring at the card, you sense that Dr. Ephart's card is the cross.

>press cross

 your brain.  There's no doubt: that's her card.

>press star
 Dr. Ephart breaks into a broad smile.

 Dr. Ephart picks up the deck of cards again.  She smiles at you and
 presses the intercom switch.  "You did great - thank you!  I'll be
 back in just a moment."

>look
 Two cameras watch the heavy desk from above with unwinking red eyes.
 The desk currently has a wireless keypad on it.

 To the west, a windowless door separates the testing room from the
 antechamber outside.

 Through the thick pane of glass, you can see the blue notebook and the
 curved desk in the observational room.

>examine blue notebook
 Unsurprisingly, you've never gotten even a peek at the inside.

>inventory

 The door to the testing chamber rattles briefly before Dr. Ephart
 enters.  The doctor gives you her warm, customary smile as she sets a
 manila folder in front of you.  "I've placed a photograph in this
 folder," she says, tapping the folder.  "Please study it closely and
 learn as much as you can about the scene.  I'll be back shortly, and
 I'll have some questions for you when I return."

 Taking the keypad, Dr. Ephart departs, leaving you alone with the
 closed folder.

 The warped 4x5 photograph shows the three-quarter profile of a teenage

 spots the book she leans over.  The fingers of her right hand are
 crooked into claws, tearing at the beige wood of the desk.

 The extremely warped 4x5 photograph shows the image of someone, face

 Something's happened to the photograph - there are dull yellow spots
 marring its surface, like it's been damaged with some kind of
 chemical.  Past those spots, you can make out the image of a young man

 head as he struggles.  He clutches two handfuls of torn, bloodstained
 pages, but one gloved hand is prying the fingers of his right hand

 There are no hangings on the dull off-white walls, but a fake palm

 there's a simple chair, which looks like a refugee from some
 grade-school classroom.  There's absolutely nothing else in this
 spartan antechamber.

 A windowless door separates the antechamber from the testing room

 The antechamber is nearly as spartan as the test chamber itself. The
 walls, painted a dull off-white, are bare of hangings.  A simple chair
 squats in the corner like a grade-school refugee.  The only decoration
 in the room is a straggly ficus tree, which sprawls in the opposite
 corner from the chair.

  He screams at night.
  Ian says that he's had these nightmares as long as he can remember,
 that it's fine and everything is normal. I really want to believe him,
 but the last few days have been different. I've seen him tossing and
 turning, but now he screams. Says things. His eyes are open, but he
 can't see or hear me.
  Are they doing something to him? I'm not supposed to ask about why
 he's here. I've been sort of hoping that he would tell me something,
 but he doesn't even like to talk about the nightmares. All I can hear
 are the things he says when he's asleep, strangled bits of words.
 "Teeth. Dark. Coming for me."
  I wish I could do something for him. Anything.

 Hall End
 This is not the hallway you expected.  The far wall is the correct
 distance away, and the ceiling is the correct height, but the walls
 are painted a dull, sterile white instead of the light blue-green that
 you associate with Corona Labs, and long banks of fluorescent lights
 cast everything into an unexpectedly harsh light.  Your room should be
 through the metal door across the hall to the west, but in light of
 the other changes, it's easy to doubt that it's yours.  A small brass
 sign identifies it as Room 320.

 A windowless door leads east into the testing room's antechamber.

 A piece of unlined paper leans face-down against the west wall, just
 slightly to the left of the door.

 Oh god, want to write better but so sick.
 I don't know what happened.
 A psychic spike - has to be. Nauseating.
 What happened? Echoes of ... Cross. Dr. Yehuda.
 Is Theo hurt? Dead? Did he hurt Ian?
 Something has pushed Ian over the edge. I think we've all made a
 terrible mistake.
 I've got to get it together. Theo left a bottle of pills on his desk
 -- the label says "Sandepam". I'm going to carry it with me. I don't
 know what it does, but if I have to face Ian, I need whatever edge
 Theo might have found.
 I can't believe it's come to this. Something awful is about to happen.

>go west

 As you step across the threshold, you freeze at the grisly sight
 beyond.

 Room 320
 A broad ivory spike protrudes from the floor and pierces the ceiling,
 transfixing the corpse of a slender, dark-haired woman on the way.
 Her blood stands starkly red against the dull white tile and walls.
 The room's furnishings - a hospital bed, a bookshelf, a dresser - have
 been smashed into a still-recognizable pile of twisted metal and wood
 on the west side of the room.  Thousands of pieces of shredded paper,
 none much larger than a fingernail, cover the floor near the wreckage
 and shiver in the slight breath from the broken window.  The only exit
 is to the east.

  I just saw a man die. He was standing in a shadow and a mouth came
 out and bit him in half.
  I feel numb and awful and I'm so scared. I don't know where Ian is
 and I'm afraid that he's going to be hurt or killed. I don't know why
 he isn't in his room.
  I have to help him and protect him. I'll wait for him here and he'll
 come back, and we can be together and I'll stop the awful things from
 hurting him.
  Please Ian come back. I will be here waiting until you come back.
  I love you.

 Hall End
 Long banks of fluorescent lights cast sharp shadows along the
 half-familiar, half-unfamiliar hallway, which continues off to the

 walls.  A strange, unpleasant odor hangs in the air and stings your
 nostrils.  The door to Room 320 is across the hall to the west.

 A windowless door leads east into the testing room's antechamber.

 Cold fluorescent lights pace the ceiling from north to south and lead

 Bathroom, Mt Airy Hospital
 The single fluorescent light in the bathroom flickers rapidly like a
 strobe. On the other side of the room, a bloodied corpse seems to be
 partially buried in the toilet, folded in half. Near the toilet is a
 sink, above which is a mirror marred by a spiderweb crack. The light's
 strobe effect gives the room a surreal, filmlike quality.  Behind you,
 to the west, a door leads back into the hallway.

 trepidation, you stick your head partway into the laundry chute and
 are met by a gust of fetid breath-like wind. You clench your teeth,
 hold your breath and dive headfirst into the chute. You think, for a
 moment, that the teeth are gone; as you begin the high-speed slide
 into the darkness nothing impedes your progress.

 Your relief is short-lived. You feel an all-consuming, wrenching pain
 in your stomach and back, like being caught in free-fall by a dozen
 knives. Your hands reach out blindly, but the smooth metal you expect
 to find is gone, replaced by what feels like wet, spongy flesh. The
 fangs release you briefly, only to close even harder. The sickening
 crunch reverberates through your body.

 The teeth release and bite you once more, and you feel the sudden
 numbness of a severed spine. Everything goes black.


 Press any key to continue.








 Consciousness returns.  You muzzily realize that you are gazing at the
 ceiling of the Corona Labs test chamber just before the door slams
 open.  Dr. Shaunessy, the neurologist, hurries into the room.  Dr.
 Ephart follows close enough behind to step on his heels.  "How many
 fingers do you see?" Dr. Shaunessy asks, kneeling down beside you, and
 Dr. Ephart rests light fingers on your wrist to take your pulse.  In
 short order, they conclude that you suffered a vasovagal syncope and
 struck your head in the fall.

 You try to talk to the doctors, but your words are confused and
 disjointed.  Your gaze drags across the fallen photograph,
 half-shadowed by the folder above it, and you see the gaunt young man
 screaming.  You can't find the words to make them understand.  Though
 you can nearly stand on your own, the doctors firmly escort you from
 the room and off to bed.

 Dr. Shaunessy leaves, but Dr. Ephart stays with you as the sedatives
 take hold.  "Don't worry," she says, resting a gentle hand on your
 shoulder.  "Everything will be all right."


            Six days later, the past repeats itself in Corona Labs.
                             No one escapes alive.

 you that the hallway has grown a mouthful of fangs.  Proceeding north

 There's a keycard reader beside the sliding door.

 The glimmer of glass greets your eye as you enter this shadowed room.
 Running through the layout of the facility in your mind, you realize
 that you're now standing in the observational room, though the
 furnishings have changed from your memory.  For instance, the gutted
 corpse is definitely new.

 Observational Room, Mt Airy Hospital
 A broad pane of one-way glass separates this room from the testing
 chamber beyond.  The lights are off in this room, cloaking everything
 in shadow, but you can still see enough to navigate past the
 rectangular table, the chairs, and the filing cabinet tucked into one
 corner.  Your view of the observational room is somewhat blocked by
 the gutted corpse sprawled across the table.

 A door to your north leads back to the hallway.

 Through the thick pane of glass, you can see a gaunt young man huddled
 in the far corner of the test chamber.

>examine man
 A gaunt young man huddles on an office chair in the far corner of the
 room, clothed only in a pair of navy sweatpants.  He is slumped
 forward in a hunch, the outline of his spine standing sharply against
 the skin of his emaciated back.  His face is obscured by a mass of
 messy, tangled brown hair.

 You feel drawn to the young man.  The feeling vibrates between empathy
 and sympathy.  You can all-too-easily imagine the slight chill of the
 air against his bare back, the way his elbows dig into his knees, and
 the slight ache of his spine from the unnatural posture.  You can
 imagine how he sits, alone, listening to the emptiness which is not
 empty enough - the emptiness that is filled with too many thoughts,
 fears, dreams.  He shifts position slightly and raises a hand to his
 hidden face.  You feel the way he drags his fingernails down his

 Flirting with the idea of blindness, as his nails trail over his
 closed eyelid, or disfigurement, as they trail over his cheek.

 He has the answers you seek.  The knowledge thumps home like a bullet
 thumping into flesh - not hurting, not yet - only a solid impact like
 nothing else in the world.

 Then, suddenly, you think you see the young man's head snap up, but
 your vision immediately bursts with a nausea-inducing green light that
 blots everything else out.  You are overcome with dizziness.  Images
 of death, terror and madness fill your brain, swelling it, pressing
 against your skull.  Reaching out to destroy everything around you,
 you are a whirlwind of insane destructive force.  You see images of
 teeth, mouths, throats, closing in to devour you, and you fight
 against them with everything you are....

 You fall back into yourself with an involuntary scream.  Your skin is
 covered in cold sweat.  After a few moments, your heart rate and
 breathing return to normal, though it takes some time before you stop
 shaking.  You have been Ian McMoneagle, and his mind is a hell.

 The gaunt young man still sits, huddled into himself, immobile.
 You're still not sure whether he ever moved at all.

 paper from beneath its shoulder so that you can pick it up.

 The table is small, and the blood on the table is still fairly slick.
 Unbalanced, the corpse suddenly starts to slide off the edge, and you
 fail to arrest its movement in time.  With a startlingly loud thump,
 the corpse hits the ground.

    I am upset with the Director.
    While I am well aware that our hospital is under-funded and that we
 should take sources of revenue wherever we can find them, renting out
 our space to private companies performing procedures that we cannot
 oversee makes me feel rather like a hotel manager. Moreover, I have
 enough duties to see to without having to carry out the blind and deaf
 duty of being the Corona Corporation's liaison. Couldn't we have one
 of our administrators do that? A secretary, perhaps? My medical
 expertise certainly does not come into play, as I am not allowed to
 see the experimentation, nor interview the patient. If he is indeed a
 patient.
    The lead researcher is friendly enough, but I've not been able to
 get a private word with him since the corporate auditor showed up. I
 swear, he looks more like a Secret Service agent than a medical
 professional, and he seems to be everywhere.
    I only want to know what's going on. And barring that, I'd frankly
 rather not have anything to do with the Corona Corporation. This is

 Plain, windowless doors labelled neatly with small brass signs lead
 off to the north and south.  At the east end of the hallway, a large,
 lurid orange biohazard symbol marks a door of a different design.
 This door is a sliding door instead of a regular door, and it has a
 small, wire-reinforced window.

 There's a keycard reader beside the sliding door.

 Cold fluorescent lights pace the ceiling from north to south and lead
 off east along the T intersection.  To the west, a pair of metal
 elevator doors sits silently closed.  There's a call button beside the
 elevator and a floor indicator above the call button.

 A building map is posted on the wall.

>go north
 Hallway, Mt Airy Hospital
 Partway down this hall, the fluorescent lights have sputtered out,
 leaving the way north cloaked in darkness.  A long, slow breeze flows
 from the south past you, reaching towards the deep shadow to the
 north.  Before the light fails, there's a bathroom door in the dull
 white wall to the east and a laundry chute to the west.

 gutted corpse feetfirst into the laundry chute.  It falls partway down
 before the laundry chute's teeth snap closed.  There's a hideous
 crunching sound, accompanied by the flash of bloodstained teeth in the
 gloom.

 The gutted corpse is gone.  The teeth slowly curve in an unmistakable
 smile.  Then, they melt into the sides of the laundry chute and vanish
 from view, leaving only smeared blood on the stainless steel tunnel to
 document the carnage.

 There's no sign of the piece of paper any more, either.

 some awkward experimentation, you realize that you'll have to go in
 headfirst.  You put both arms in, shield your face with your arms, and
 wriggle into the chute.  You slide rapidly down through the narrow
 darkness until the chute abruptly ends.  For one heartstopping moment,
 you plummet through space, but you land safely in something soft.  A
 quiet, papery crunch accompanies your landing.

 Laundry, Mt Airy Hospital (in the laundry bin)
  Crumpled white sheets fill an enormous laundry bin underneath the
 chute's entrance - a great relief, since those sheets were dense
 enough to competently break your fall.  You're currently inside the
 laundry bin, but you can see the rest of the room well enough.  There
 is no mistaking the purpose of this room.  Industrial washers and
 dryers line the walls of this room.  The room stinks of offal, blood
 and bleach all at the same time.  On the east wall, a large sink made
 of heavy-duty steel sits, but its long faucet is bent at a peculiar
 angle and it is missing both handles.  A particularly large laundry
 machine looms at the end of the row.

 The giant laundry machine is running, filling the room with ominous
 sound and vibration.

 An open door leads south out of the room.

 A sheet of typewriter paper is lying on the sheets, looking only a bit
 worse for its misadventures (including having you land on it).  It
 looks like the one that you knocked free from the laundry chute.

 Unofficial log, April 2, 3:10 pm
    Day one with the Corona Corporation! The intrepid doctor embarks on
 a real adventure; hardly the first of his career but certainly the
 most extraordinary.
    I always considered my interest in the paranormal purely academic.
 No matter what a man has seen or believes, bringing such beliefs and
 experiences into the professional arena is a dangerous prospect. Being
 approached to pursue such things -- for a very tidy sum, no less! --
 is not something I ever expected to see in my resume ... but here I
 am.
    My team is eclectic, which I suppose is to be expected. Dr.
 Atwater, slated to be my assistant overseer (and the previous man who
 held my current title), has a closed-minded cynicism matched only by
 his impressive credentials. Miss Elaine Buchanan, on the other hand,
 is not only a believer but actually considers herself a psychic. The
 company evidently agrees, since she is effectively our lead
 subject-seeker, spending her days poring over newspaper articles,
 tabloids and television programs.
    It is difficult not to find the entire outfit somewhat difficult to
 take seriously, but this is my chance to see what is really behind the
 closed door of the human mind. I find myself very nervous and excited.

 The inside of the machine is not, as you expected, a metal cylinder,

 glistening cilia, like the ones lining the inside of an intestine from

 wriggling with life.  Sitting in the tube is a skeleton, complete but
 with its flesh eaten cleanly away. The skeleton is wearing a clean,

 through the protection of the lab coat and lift it.  Thankfully,
 enough ligaments and tendons and so forth remain on the skeleton to
 maintain its cohesion as you pull it out, and you are able to extract
 it from the machine without breaking it.  You lay the skeleton down on

 May 1st, 1978

    Well, things are clearly getting exciting for our guests from
 Corona Labs.
    I'm not sure what's different, but I've heard signs of a struggle
 from McMoneagle's room during the day. Nurse Kim reports that his
 sleeping at night has been disruptive and suspects that his nightmares
 are more intense than when he first arrived. I want to know more, but
 obviously none of the Corona employees are telling me anything at all.
 As always, Cross watches me whenever I'm near their annex.
    Something very suspicious is going on. They're experimenting on
 that young man, and it's obviously not anything safe. Be it on their
 heads if he dies, or becomes violent. They'd better be able to contain
 it, or we are going to come down on them as hard as the law allows. I
 swear it.
    Yehuda has seemed the most concerned of the lot of them, and has
 mentioned to me that he may need to requisition "a few medications"
 from me in the near future. Truth be told, I hope he does so. That
 might give me some insight to just what in heaven's name they're
 doing.

 A single incandescent bulb behind a metal cage provides harsh yet

 tantalizingly close.

 Through the grayness, you see that the room is hideously spattered
 with gore, particularly the wall behind the boiler.  Amid the less
 recognizable chunks, you spot a bloodsoaked leather dress shoe, a
 cracked cell phone, and a shredded lab coat.

 Your vision clears and the roaring fades.  The blood, the
 half-identified body parts, the shoe - all have vanished.

 It's a metal box containing a pristine, solid steel fire axe.  The
 glass on the front shows the words, "In case of emergency, break
 glass."  With what, a fire axe?

 In the metal box is a fire axe.

>examine pipes
 of which lead to the large boiler in the center of the room.

>touch pipes
 pipe groans, a sound that resonates not only through the boiler room,
 but through your bones and your skull.  Your fingers slacken....

 As your outer eyes close, your inner eye opens.  Dimly, you perceive
 your body rebounding from the pipes to crumple on the floor, but
 you're not there any more.

 Press any key to continue.








 Fleeting impressions flash through your awareness.  It's hard to
 orient yourself.  You're running - banging helplessly at an elevator
 button that doesn't respond - turning desperately down the hall.
 Fleeing down a set of stairs.  Thoughts pelt past with the same speed
 as your running footsteps, rasp through you like your hard-stolen
 breaths.  Grasping for inner purchase, you come up with a name:

 Leon Shaunessy.

 With the name comes identity:

 Neurologist, Corona Laboratories, Mount Airy division.  Father of two,
 divorcee of one, lover of good scotch and handwritten letters and
 speedcubing.  Probably the world's leading expert in the effects of
 Naegleria splendens, though it doesn't mean a good goddamned thing
 now....

 His perceptions are yours, his thoughts rush through you, and his fear
 contaminates you as he runs down the hall, stumbles through the door,
 and slams it shut.  You look and see:

 Boiler Room
 Until today, you had never visited the facility's boiler room.  A
 single incandescent bulb behind a metal cage provides a harsh yet
 inadequate light, and a maze of large pipes runs along the ceiling.
 Most of the pipes lead to a large boiler that squats in front of you,
 easily taking up three quarters of the small room's real estate.  In
 the rear of the room, an oversized exhaust fan with wide blades stands
 unmoving.

 A loud, electronic buzz permeates this room.

 The door to the east is closed, but there's no lock.  You've got to
 bar it somehow.

>search pipes

 You think you hear something outside the door, and your strained
 nerves shriek.  If the door isn't barred, the horrors could come
 straight in after you.  You can't possibly hold the door shut with
 muscle power alone.

>examine pipes
 Two red pipes run parallel to the door.  A pipe that seems to be loose
 from the rest of the framework is wedged in the fan at the room's
 south side.

 Your heart is beating so fast it could burst.  You urgently need to
 block the door somehow.

>take pipe
 You grab the loose length of pipe and pull hard on it.  After a few
 tries, you hear a groaning noise, and the pipe suddenly breaks free.
 You stumble backward with the pipe.  The fan blades, now loose, resume
 their rotation, turning in a slow circle.  The buzzing in the room
 stops, becoming a low hum instead.  Something about the humming
 resonates through your mind, dizzying you....

 In the moment of your dizziness, Leon moves with no prompting.  Heart
 pounding, he slides the metal pipe behind the pair of red pipes,
 resting it on the pipe bend and the door's handle.  The door is
 effectively barred shut.

 The fan's rotation gently increases in speed, causing a breeze to waft
 through the room.

>bar door with pipe

>examine fan
 with blades about a foot wide.  While the room may get hot because of
 the boiler, the fan seems a bit larger than is necessary.  The fan is
 currently spinning.

 The fan continues to turn. Your hair moves in the strengthening
 breeze.

>inventory
 carrying a Samsung cell phone.  In sum, you have absolutely nothing of
 use.

 The fan's rotation picks up speed, causing the breeze to increase in
 intensity. You brush hair from your face.

>examine badge
 physical locks.  This is your badge, complete with a rather august
 photo, which allows you to open any doors in the secure Corona area of
 the Corona building.

 Of course, you're not exactly in the secure Corona area now, nor would
 you want to be (he remembers the jointed, steel-legged spider
 crouching to fit through a doorway, blood streaking its legs to half
 their height - then pushes the idea sharply out of his mind).

 The hum of the fan's motor has become increasingly loud, and it shows
 no indication of stopping.  Dust is dragged from the ground and sucked
 through the fan.

 Some internal alarm rouses you, and you struggle for identity.  This
 is not you.  Leon Shaunessy is not you..

>examine cell phone

 The Samsung cell phone is currently switched on.

 The fan's blades are now a blur.  It's getting harder to breathe in
 here.  The pipe rattles in the door, drawn, like all loose objects,
 toward the fan.

 He's going to die.  You can feel his death coming.

>get pipe
 You don't dare take the loose pipe away; it's the only thing
 separating you from the nightmare outside.

 As the fan's speed continues to increase, you find it difficult to
 maintain your footing.  You realize with despair that the horror has
 found you after all, and tricked you into trapping yourself with it.

 Not you.  This isn't your death - it's his.

 You struggle your way to the door and grasp the length of loose pipe,
 trying to remove it from the door and make it out of this wind tunnel.
 Just as you grab the pipe, the suction becomes too powerful.  Your
 shoes lift from the ground and you find yourelf holding onto the pipe
 for dear life as the fan cuts a deadly whirlwhind behind you.

>get pipe
 Leon doesn't respond to your suggestion.  He's too busy clinging to
 the pipe.

 After a few seconds, his grip, slick with nervous sweat, begins to
 fail.  His fingers lose their strength.  Suddenly he is torn free, his
 body falling sideways through the air for a few long moments before
 striking the fan.  The powerful blades churn Leon Shaunessy's body
 into a paste, spraying the wall behind with gore.

 In the instant before death, you rip your consciousness free of his.
 Leon Shaunessy is dead, but you are still alive.

 Press any key to continue.

  I knew it! I was right about him!
  Ian is consistently testing better than any other subject we've put
 through the paces. His score with the Zener cards is consistently over
 50% and he's shown some promise with psychometry. Dr. Atwater says
 that it's all within the limits of random chance, of course. That man
 would, presented with a UFO, write it off as a trendy new model of
 Chevette.
  We still have some testing to do to determine Ian's psychological
 resilience and mental strength. There is some concern about his
 chronic nightmares and emotional difficulties, but I honestly think
 that one comes from the other. It's not uncommon for psychics to have
 problems like these.
  If everything checks out, it should be about a week before he's
 introduced to the symbiont. I have a lot of faith, but it still makes
 me nervous. No one's survived it. If I don't trust my instincts, I
 have no reason to believe that Ian will be an exception.
  Nothing to do but wait and see.

  This diary has seen a lot of angry words from me and a lot of them
 have been related to my being declared an "inadequate" test subject
 for Corona. I have the ability. I have the will. I've never been able
 to understand what they meant when the Corona techs said I had an
 "inadequate psychological profile" to be a carrier for the Project's
 symbiont.
  Since being hired, though, I'm starting to see an ugly truth: My
 inadequacy may have saved my life.
  This thing is killing people. It hasn't even been a year since I was
 placed as Dr. Atwater's assistant and we've seen twelve deaths.
 Twelve.
  Presumably all of these people had stronger minds than me, if they
 were taken into the program. But days after they're declared suitable
 and given the symbiont, they end up tagged, bagged and shelved. Would
 that have happened to me?
  No, I'm better off where I am. And I have to have faith. I believe in
 the researchers behind the symbiont, believe in Mr. Schuyler because
 he believes in us. Believes that I'm the only person who can find him.
  I'll find the one soon.

 of the noise, first grabbing for the wall and then for the railing.

 As your outer eyes close, your inner eye opens.  Dimly, you feel your
 grip slacken, and the railing falls away.  Your shoulder and back hit
 the elevator floor, but you're not there any more.

 Press any key to continue.








 You reorient slowly.  You're still in an elevator, but you recognize
 this place - it's the elevator at Corona Labs.  You and Dr. Ephart
 rode this elevator she escorted you into the building on your first
 day.

 Strange thoughts tick past, rattling sharply like stone striking
 stone.  Grasping for inner purchase, you come up with a name:

 Tobias Ensfield.  I am Dr. Tobias Ensfield.

 And with the name comes identity:

 Graduate of Warren Alpert Medical School.  Protegee of Edward
 Dartmouth.  Ex-employee of Dartmouth Industries.  Life Master in the
 United States Chess Federation.  Rayjay Farley's mentor and master.
 Microbiologist, Corona Labs.

 And with identity comes anger, and with anger comes sharp and
 immediate fear, but the full scope of Tobias Ensfield's consciousness
 is too overwhelming to process.  The foreign thoughts tick swiftly
 past and away as you reorient on the outside world.  Ensfield's mind
 adds sharp edges to everything.  Your surroundings:

 You remember Elizabeth saying she was going down for a coffee.  She
 always takes the stairs - will she be downstairs, or upstairs?  The
 chivalrous man in you wants her to be downstairs, far away, but the
 coward wants her to be upstairs.  There's a weird core of strength in
 the girl, and maybe she can take care of herself better than anyone
 else.  If so, maybe she'll take care of Rayjay.

 be then?

 Not that you can do much in the lab except point and instruct.  That's

 It's not you.  You're not the one dying.

 The elevator stops.

 A fine trickle of blood seeps from one of his ears, strangely

 The elevator doors slide open.  Beyond the doors, the ground floor
 hallway is a half-obscured hell of crackling electricity.  Amid the
 leaping sparks are bodies every bit as hideous as Camille deVries's.

 And then the noise is blessedly gone.

 The hospital's cafeteria is not very large, but it's still enough to
 seat a few dozen people at a time.  Rows of rectangular tables covered
 in wood veneer are surrounded by a gauntlet of cheap chairs made of
 metal and molded plastic.  The ceiling is higher here than elsewhere
 in the hospital; the fluorescent lights hang down, surrounded by a
 maze of exposed pipe running through the room.  A gap in the wall to

 grayness clouds your vision.

 Through the grayness, you see a tall black woman contorted into a
 protective fetal position.  Although her arms are shielding her face,
 you recognize the beaded braids and lab smock of "Best" Ife, one of
 the techs from your Corona Labs.  Her skin is horribly blistered, and
 it hangs loosely on her slim-boned body.  In places, the flesh has
 split to reveal the cooked muscle below.

 The fever fades, and your vision clears.  Mercifully, the corpse is
 gone.

 It's an old-style snack vending machine.  A small window near the top
 displays a few snacks, doomed to forever be display products only.
 The rest of the machine's surface displays an abstract design
 featuring several loops and a drawing of a building.   The design
 seems familiar to you.   Bizarrely, the vending machine lacks a keypad
 and any means of inserting money; you have no idea how anyone is
 supposed to get snacks out of it.   A plastic flap conceals the lower
 compartment where the snacks are supposed to come out.

  Ian is suffering a lot, and he says that his headaches are worse than
 ever. I knew that this would be a part of it, but things are going to
 be difficult for all of us until his mind adjusts to the symbiont. I'm
 confident that it will.
  In the meantime, it's a bit difficult not to be a bit unsettled by
 the intensity of his nightmares. I don't think I would even know about
 them if it weren't a set part of our counseling sessions. He's very
 reluctant to talk about them, and refused to do so until I reminded
 him that failing to do so might hamper testing.
  There's a common theme to his nighttime ordeals. Imagery involving
 teeth, internal organs, and being trapped in a moist, wet space are
 showing up over and over again. I've got to assume that Ian is
 obsessed with being eaten.
  I can't help but wonder if he witnessed something awful when he was
 little, but he gets very upset when questioned about the possible
 source of the nightmares. Maybe I'll ask again once his mind has
 recovered a bit.
  Nervous but hopeful!

  There will never be anything I can do to make up for the sins I have
 committed. Blinding myself to the danger of this experimentation, as
 tied to it as I was, is a pure product of my own ambition and
 bitterness at having been rejected. I should have known long ago.
  Now it is only because of that connection that I am alive and
 everyone else is dead.
  I know where he is and where his nightmares are. I can stay alive
 while I find out what I need to do to beat him.
  No matter what else happens, I have to try. Even if it kills me. I

 Raymond Pearce, M.D.
 Assistant Director, Mt. Airy Hospital
 May 8th, 1978

  Well!
    Dr. Yehuda has come to requisition supplies as he said he might,
 but I daresay I expected the man to be more composed when he did so.
    He was wild-eyed when he came to my office, with the air of a
 fugitive who had just escaped a pursuer. It was therefore somewhat
 less of a surprise when he asked that I not report the requisition to
 Mr. Cross. Much as I would have liked to use the information as a
 bargaining chip, I am inclined to be more lenient to Dr. Yehuda as
 opposed to Cross, not to mention the fact that any requisition at all
 would give me information that I didn't have before.
    Though suspicious, I therefore consented.
    Dr. Yehuda asked for a dose of liquid tyramine for synthesis, as
 well as a drug that contained diazepam, benzodiazepenes, and beta
 blockers. Concerning the tyramine, I knew that the hospital had only
 one supply of the stuff suitable for the lab, and that went by the
 brand name Vanemine. We also had a cocktail matching the doctor's
 second request, which sold under the brand name Sandepam. I assured
 him that both would be made available to him.
    As soon as I was clear of the Doctor, I began researching his
 choices, starting with the most specific and targeted. Given its
 specific chemical cocktail, Sandepam is primarily kept as a treatment
 for a potentially fatal adrenergic storm. While there are a lot of
 causes of such a condition, an overdose of tyramine is one. I can
 assume, then, that the relationship between the drugs is causal. So
 why would he need tyramine in the first place? I have trouble
 believing that Corona has hired out an annex to research some kind of
 advanced "cheese effect."
    Given the secretive and dangerous air about the project combined
 with a need for high levels of a potentially life-threatening
 norepinephrine, I can only assume that they are playing with
 McMoneagle's brain. Are they trying to create a supersoldier? An
 advanced neurotoxin?
    This is too dangerous. I've got to get to the bottom of it, even if
 it puts my position in danger.

 fanged jaws and pulsating sphincters.  Hideous, amorphous creatures
 spawn within seconds, only to be devoured messily seconds later.  The
 air is thick with the smell of feces, bile and death.  A rusty iron
 portcullis directly behind the doors, glistening with blood, does
 little to hide the horrors but mercifully separates you from stepping

 This windowless room smells of cigarette smoke and less savory things,

 Alice's Diary, 4/17/78

  I know it's totally unprofessional, but I can't help but think that
 the patient in room 320 is really interesting.
  I don't know much about him. He's in an annex that's being used by an
 outside corporation for a secret project or something. I'm not even
 really supposed to talk to him, but ...
  Well, he looks so sad. He hasn't gone home in a week and a half and
 he'll be here for even longer than that, and he's got to be really
 lonely. They can't expect me to come through the room and give him
 food and change his linens and keep my mouth clamped shut the whole
 time. That's not fair to him and it's not fair to me either.
  More than food and linens and medication, what a patient like that
 needs right now is a friendly face and light conversation if he
 happens to be up late. That's not a crime, is it?
  And I've gotta admit ... he's kind of cute.

 Consciousness returns.  You muzzily realize that you are gazing at the
 ceiling of the Corona Labs test chamber just before the door slams
 open.  Dr. Shaunessy, the neurologist, hurries into the room.  Dr.
 Ephart follows close enough behind to step on his heels.  "How many
 fingers do you see?" Dr. Shaunessy asks, kneeling down beside you, and
 Dr. Ephart rests light fingers on your wrist to take your pulse.  In
 short order, they conclude that you suffered a vasovagal syncope and
 struck your head in the fall.

 You try to talk to the doctors, but your words are confused and
 disjointed.  Your gaze drags across the fallen photograph,
 half-shadowed by the folder above it, and you see the gaunt young man
 screaming.  You can't find the words to make them understand.  Though
 you can nearly stand on your own, the doctors firmly escort you from
 the room and off to bed.

 Dr. Shaunessy leaves, but Dr. Ephart stays with you as the sedatives
 take hold.  "Don't worry," she says, resting a gentle hand on your
 shoulder.  "Everything will be all right."

 Unofficial log, April 15, 11:00 am
    I suppose someone must have listened to Elaine's assertion that
 this test subject was different from the rest, since we've just gained
 a new member of the team.
    This was not a pleasant cup of chicory to down first thing in the
 morning. Don't get me wrong -- I would love, more than anything, to
 welcome Simon Cross to our ranks, and G-d knows that we could stand to
 gain another team member. Of all of the positions we had open prior to
 today, however, I'm not sure I ever would have counted "Company Spook"
 among them.
    Perhaps I am being unfair, but it is my opinion that hypnotizing
 yourself into believing that a knife is a rolling pin will not prevent
 you from needing stitches after trying to make bread dough. Cross's
 official title is "auditor." He claims that he is here to oversee
 Corona's professional interests in the Project, and I don't doubt him
 one bit. Cross oozes "professional interests." He brushes his teeth
 with it, or he wouldn't be able to give me that sharkish grin.
    Still, we are bedfellows now. There's nothing to do but see to it
 that he is comfortable ... and bored.

 S.C. - Entry 1978-05-12-0230

 Doctor, Doctor, Doctor.
 I know that you're not used to people sifting through your notes, but
 you should know by now that you are out of your element. I'm sure that
 you have a private diary that I won't find, but keeping crib notes of
 your experiments on the side is simply not a very good survival
 technique.
 Tyramine? Diazepam? Dead samples of the symbiont? I may not be a
 doctor, Doctor, but I am not a fool and I am in a facility chock full
 of useful texts.
 "Curing" Ian will not save him, and your attempt has sealed your fate.
 This is bigger than you or me, Doctor. We are but tiny satellites
 floating in the corona of the sun. Dive too deep and you will burn
 away.
 You have dived too deep, Doctor. Now I must burn you.

>cut hand with bonesaw

 You grasp the corpse by the wrist.  You set the edge of the bonesaw
 against the edge of the hand where its fingers begin, and set your
 teeth for an unpleasant task.  You brace your shoulder and begin
 sawing the fingers at the joint, easily slicing through the first
 layers of flesh and grating against the hardened muscle.  After a few
 moments of nauseating work, you feel the grate of bone beneath the
 saw.  You set your back into a few more passes, trying to neither see
 nor hear the flesh shredding under the bonesaw.

 At last you are rewarded for your gruesome work: the pistol clatters
 to the ground amid curled, severed fingers.

 Unfortunately, you do not anticipate the sudden success.  The weight
 of your shoulder throws the saw forward, driving it solidly into the
 side of the metal table and bending it nearly in half.  You discard
 the ruined bonesaw.

 Unofficial log, May 6th, 8:00pm
    Ian's test was strange today.
    As I've said in my notes, Ian is showing a great deal of promise in
 remote viewing. He's able to come up with at least one salient, unique
 detail about anything he is asked to see.  Over the past day or two,
 his "scrying" has been strikingly accurate, including not only
 corroborating details but also an understanding of the situations he
 has been asked to view.
    Today's trial, though, has left me with a nasty sense of
 foreboding.  Dr. Atwater had just excused himself to make a run to the
 convenience store, so I proposed to Ian that he perform a viewing on
 the doctor.  I was initially merely disappointed when Ian described an
 office within the facility, indicating guesswork on Ian's part.  After
 that, the boy became seriously agitated, babbling about being in
 danger.  He dissolved into a panic attack and spoke very fast. It was
 hard to understand him, but he seemed to be saying that Cross and Dr.
 Atwater were "out to get him," claiming that "they want to terminate
 me."
    I did my best to placate the poor boy, but he was having none of
 it.  By the look in his eyes, he seemed to be caught in the vision and
 unable to escape it.  After a few minutes, I saw no recourse but to
 tranquilize him and have him moved back to his room under supervision.
 Once awake, he was very paranoid, still believing firmly that Cross
 and Dr. Atwater were conspiring to end his life.  By my estimation,
 this must have been his nightmares bleeding over into his visions,
 tainting them with the paranoia of being chased on a nightly basis.
 It's possible that Ian's abilities interpreted Dr. Atwater's departure
 from the facility as abandonment, termination. It's the best that I
 can guess.
    There is a part of me that believes that I should have put all of
 this into the official report.  Instead, I used the most generic terms
 I could.  Panic attack.  Adverse effects.  Unexpected delusions.
    Why not the truth, Theo?  You are a Doctor and an employee of
 Corona.  They don't pay you to omit details.
    The truth is ... by now, I trust Ian's abilities more than I trust
 Dr. Atwater's belief in the project.  When Ian told me that Dr.
 Atwater wanted him to die, well, it was very difficult not to believe
 him.
    Where is this project going, and why are we in a handbasket?

 middle-aged man.  Although he was stacked face down, his head is
 turned to the side, away from his grisly companion, so you can see
 that his face looks tired but kindly.  The neat bullet-wound between
 the corpse's eyes has dried, but the messy exit wound in the back
 glistens with still-drying blood.  Behind a thick pair of black-rimmed
 glasses, the skin around his eyes shows clear laugh lines.

 Lightning fast, one of the fleshy tentacles wraps around you with
 crushing force.  You set your heels and lean back against the pull of
 the tentacle, but you are unable to maintain your footing.  With a
 sudden jerk, the fleshy muscle jerks you forward and you stumble
 directly into the mass of pulsating flesh.  You hit the stuff
 face-first, and you can feel it wrap around you as soon as you touch
 it.  You attempt to scream, but the noise is cut off as something warm
 and soft expands down your throat.  Deprived of air, you can only
 struggle helplessly as you feel your flesh begin to prickle.  Every
 contact point between your body and the mass of flesh begins to burn,
 almost as though you are being digested....


 Press any key to continue.








 Consciousness returns.  You muzzily realize that you are gazing at the
 ceiling of the Corona Labs test chamber just before the door slams
 open.  Dr. Shaunessy, the neurologist, hurries into the room.  Dr.
 Ephart follows close enough behind to step on his heels.  "How many
 fingers do you see?" Dr. Shaunessy asks, kneeling down beside you, and
 Dr. Ephart rests light fingers on your wrist to take your pulse.  In
 short order, they conclude that you suffered a vasovagal syncope and
 struck your head in the fall.

 You try to talk to the doctors, but your words are confused and
 disjointed.  Your gaze drags across the fallen photograph,
 half-shadowed by the folder above it, and you see the gaunt young man

 you can nearly stand on your own, the doctors firmly escort you from

 Dr. Shaunessy leaves, but Dr. Ephart stays with you as the sedatives
 take hold.  "Don't worry," she says, resting a gentle hand on your
 shoulder.  "Everything will be all right."

 The corner of a white piece of paper is visible beneath the door.

 A wet sliding noise emanates from the morgue, starting quiet but
 getting louder by the second.

 of what appears to be raw red muscle. It is filling the morgue and
 rapidly approaching the autopsy room.

>take white paper

 That's not really feasible.

 The opening to the morgue fills now with pulsating red flesh, pouring
 over the sides of the door like a sideways drain overflowing with
 sludge, all the while making a ghastly wet sliding noise.  In the
 center of the mass, a pale bubble forms.  It appears at first to be a
 blister, but its features define until you recognize a face - that of
 Dr. Yehuda. The face's expression is wracked with pain; it lets out an
 anguished sound as the mass of flesh pushes its way into the room.

 "I didn't know! I'm so sorry!" the face moans.

>shoot face
 You raise your pistol toward the face-blister and pull the trigger.
 With a deafening report, the gun kicks in your hand.  A spray of white
 liquid splatters from the face's forehead where the bullet lands.  The
 white liquid runs in rivulets down the front of the face as it
 contorts in even further agony.

 "God, why?" the face moans. "Why did I die?"

 The mass of bloody flesh begins to retract, pulling away from the
 walls and leaving a glistening red trail as it goes.  Steam billows
 from the flesh as the white liquid runs onto it and burns it away.
 The face begins to lose coherency, melting as it cries.

 "My only sin was ignorance," the dissolving face murmurs. "Please
 forgive me my part in this."

 After a minute, the mass has retreated entirely into the morgue.
 Through the door, you see it retract back to the center of the room,
 curl into a small ball, and collapse into a small pile of ash with a
 peculiar clinking sound.

 After several seconds of empty silence, you hear a click from the door

 off east along the T intersection.  To the west, a pair of metal
 elevator doors sits silently closed.  There's a call button beside the
 elevator and a floor indicator above the call button.

 A building map is posted on the wall.

 Room 322, Mt Airy Hospital
 While spacious, this office is surprisingly austere.  The office is
 clearly separated into two sides.  On the west side, a large but
 inexpensive-looking metal desk is festooned with decorations; a
 calendar covers its center, while several photos are proudly displayed
 with their faces to the door.  The desk on the east side is a standing
 oak desk, precisely arranged and nearly bare.  All of the decoration
 on that side of the room is on the walls, an array of diplomas and
 commendations.  An office chair stands in front of each desk.

 Only a single object dares to split the room: a wall-mounted
 television displaying half of a grainy black-and-white picture.

 To your south, a door leads back to the hallway.

 Below the television, there is a wall button with a typewritten sign
 taped next to it.

 A piece of unlined paper lies face-down on the floor, half in and half
 out of the oak desk's shadow.

  I've found him!

 It's hard not to doubt myself. I've written about candidates before. I
 believed in each and every one of them. They all had that spark, that
 brilliant glint of possibility. It shone in them like a tiny sun. How
 could I not believe? And with each failure it became harder to believe
 in myself.

  But he's different, McMoneagle. Ian. A skinny boy from the suburbs of
 Olney with nothing spectacular about him but chronic nightmares,
 headaches, and emotional problems. But that sun, his sun. So much
 brighter than any I've seen.

  Dr. Atwater is of course convinced that he'll fail just like all the
 others, and refuses to refer to him even by his first name since we
 picked him up. Even Dr. Yehuda is cautious, given our track record. I
 have to convince him, both of them.

  He's the one. He's our hope.

 currently-displayed month is May of 1978.  While notes are scrawled on
 the calendar, little are of any use; most are for day-to-day
 activities centered around someone named "Ian".  Several other names
 are mentioned: "Atwater", "Elaine", and occasionally "Pearce".  A
 quick page-flip reveals that little is filled out for future months in
 the calendar.  Whoever was using this lived in the moment, or at least

 One Eye Open
 An Interactive Nightmare by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine
 Release 1 / Serial number 100929 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)


 After only ten days, you're becoming surprisingly comfortable with
 life as a Corona Corporation guinea pig.  It helps that your routine
 is so reliable - meals, exercise, rest, and sleep are clearly arranged
 on a schedule hanging beside the white clock in your room.  As for the
 tests - well, you've grown used to the sight of your blood in a sample
 vial, and the rest is mostly paperwork.  Personality tests, aptitude
 tests, intelligence tests, psychological tests, Rorschach and the MMPI
 and even kinetic family drawing... you're starting to worry that
 they'll run out of tests by the end of the month.

 Although 7:30 PM is always the day's last test, you never leave your
 room alone, so you were still watching American Beauty when Dr. Marnie
 Ephart knocked at the door.  "Oh, you're almost to the end!" she said
 brightly, seeing the screen.  "I can wait until you're through."

 "No, that's fine."  You hit PAUSE to freeze Angela in mid-motion as
 you got up from the couch.  "I've seen it before."  Last Monday,
 actually.  The video collection isn't that good, and, considering what
 they're paying you, it's a pity Corona couldn't invest in a few more
 options.  It's hard to complain, though; the staff is friendly, the
 tests aren't hard, and the salary is great.

 During the day, Raymond, Best, or one of the scientists might be
 around, but at night, it's usually just the two of you, and the hall
 you cross now is deserted.  You accompany her through the antechamber
 and into the main testing chamber.  By now, you're used to being
 watched from behind one-way glass, but the observational room is fully
 lit today, and you can easily see inside.

 "Back in a moment," Dr. Ephart says cheerfully.  "See you on the other
 side!"


 Test Chamber, Corona Labs
 In the center of the room, a single black office chair sits in front
 of a broad, heavy desk.  The desk and chair are familiar, but the
 wireless keypad sitting on the desk is new.  There are five large
 white buttons on the keypad, each displaying a different symbol in
 broad black strokes.  The symbols are a circle, a cross, a set of
 three wavy lines, a square, and a five-pointed star.  As always, you
 are quite aware of the cameras watching you from above.

 To the west, a windowless door separates the testing room from the
 antechamber outside.

 The familiar black office chair sits invitingly nearby.

 Through the thick pane of glass, you can see the curved desk in the
 observational room.

 Unofficial log, May 11th, 11:30 am

    I can't believe that I didn't do more digging when I first signed
 on with this G-d damned company. A little bit of snooping would have
 saved me a world of horror.  While I knew that Ian was not the first
 subject of Corona's experiments, what I did not know was exactly how
 the others had been deemed unsuitable.  I wonder if "Reacted poorly to
 the symbiont" managed to make it onto their epitaphs, or whether it
 was scrawled in the margins of a toe tag.  Knowing what I have learned
 about Corona, I would be surprised if they lent even that much dignity
 to their "lab rats."

    The cherry on the proverbial sundae: their very best metric of
 success, the sign that they are on the right track: the death of a
 researcher at the hands of a psychic test subject, purposefully hopped
 up on a potentially fatal brain-eating symbiont.

    This has to stop.

    I am working on an inoculation against the symbiont.  The fact that
 Ian survived it is a good sign that his own psychic ability might be
 enough to withstand its death. The theory is as follows:

    I need a sample of the symbiont, dead, just as for a standard
 vaccine.  This should be easy; Atwater indicated to me in April that
 the symbiont died in response to standard chemicals, so long as it
 wasn't already in a living being's system.  A dose of the vaccine
 would be enough to kill the symbiont itself, but its bond with Ian's
 mind will be harder to break.  With this in mind, a very strong dose
 of tyramine will give him the adrenal spike he needs to break that
 psychic link.

    He'll need almost immediately to take a strong dose of medicine to
 stave off an adrenergic storm; that amount of tyramine would be fatal
 to anyone, even a psychic of his stature.  With that in mind, I have
 requisitioned a drug with enough levels of diazepam, benzodiazepenes
 and beta blockers.  If he takes them in turn, it'll be hell on his
 system ... but he will live and the symbiont won't.

    I have the diazepam formula. I just hope I can get ahold of the
 tyramine-fortified vaccine before that spook, Cross, realizes what I'm
 up to.

    - Theo Yehuda

 Below, you find a recipe detailing the creation of a vaccine.  It
 requires a sample of contaminated blood, "Vnmne", formaldehyde, and
 "Hrtmn for dilut", all combined in precise measurements and directly
 injected into the subject.

 No wonder Dr. Yehuda preferred to type his notes - his handwriting was
 abysmal.

 unexpectedly, producing a doubled world.  You receive the impression
 of its former owner - a mind both exhausted and determined, with a
 deep underlying current of kindness.  The kindness is a strength; the
 kindness is a weakness.

 You... bastard.  The thought is heavy with sorrow.  Has it really come
 to this?  Is there nothing I can do?

 And then, in a sudden moment of decision, he fakes a cough and
 secretly puts the key in his mouth.  He's about to swallow it (the
 worst pill he's ever taken) just to rob Cross of a little convenience,
 the one spit-in-the-eye moment that he never managed before he was a
 walking dead man.

 The bullet smashes through his mind and takes the decision away, but
 as the corpse of Theo Yehuda collapses, gravity quietly wedges the key
 into his throat.  If he dies a failure, at least he didn't hand his
 secrets over like a slave.  At least he did that much for Ian.

 From the desk of Dr. Edward Atwater, M.D., Ph.D.
 April 3rd, 1978
    Not a day passes by that I fail to be astonished by how willing
 Corona is to throw their money away. Such tremendous cost of research!
 Such lucrative pay for the staff! Such reparations to the families of
 the dead!
    This project has killed fifteen fools who believed themselves to be
 psychic. I would painstakingly run them through personality tests, IQ
 tests, psychological profiles. They would pass muster or fail, and
 those who failed would be turned away. The poor fools who pass receive
 the treatment that will inevitably kill them. I'm not sure that
 they've even told the new project head, Yehuda, how many subjects have
 died thanks to the "symbiont."
    Symbiont. Pah. I'm no microbiologist, but I recognize the symptoms
 of a parasite when I see one, and this one has killed everyone that
 it's been fed to. The thing dies like any other microorganism when
 exposed to formaldehyde in the lab as when creating a vaccine, but
 once it's in the body there's no cure. The little beasts go straight
 to the brain, the subject goes mad and then dies in an out-of-control
 adrenergic storm that even a near-lethal dose of diazepam won't stop.
    And now we're looking for another one. At this rate, we'll never
 get the contract -- at the very least, someone needs to live through
 the damn infection.

 Assistant Director, Mt. Airy Hospital
 May 12th, 1978
    I don't know what kind of disaster they've uncovered but it's
 happening right now and it's in my hospital.
    They're all running around like they're possessed. The subject,
 McMoneagle, went tearing past me less than a half hour ago. It's more
 energy than I've ever seen him display. He went down the stairs, not a
 doctor or escort in sight. I should have followed, but something gave
 me this unearthly fear. Ridiculous, but it's hard not to fall prey to
 the mysticism that's surrounded this whole absurd affair.
    Minutes later, I heard screaming, like the kind in the giant
 monster pictures my nephew is so damn fond of. I couldn't tell where
 it was from. Now there's something strange going on in the wet lab,
 something obscuring the window in there.
    It's now or never. I have a terrible feeling about all this, but I
 have to find out what the hell they've been doing before we're all run
 out of the building.

 Consciousness returns.  You muzzily realize that you are gazing at the
 ceiling of the Corona Labs test chamber just before the door slams
 open.  Dr. Shaunessy, the neurologist, hurries into the room.  Dr.
 Ephart follows close enough behind to step on his heels.  "How many
 fingers do you see?" Dr. Shaunessy asks, kneeling down beside you, and
 Dr. Ephart rests light fingers on your wrist to take your pulse.  In
 short order, they conclude that you suffered a vasovagal syncope and
 struck your head in the fall.

 You try to talk to the doctors, but your words are confused and
 disjointed.  Your gaze drags across the fallen photograph,
 half-shadowed by the folder above it, and you see the gaunt young man
 screaming.  You can't find the words to make them understand.  Though
 you can nearly stand on your own, the doctors firmly escort you from
 the room and off to bed.

 Dr. Shaunessy leaves, but Dr. Ephart stays with you as the sedatives
 take hold.  "Don't worry," she says, resting a gentle hand on your
 shoulder.  "Everything will be all right."


            Six days later, the past repeats itself in Corona Labs.

 While spacious, this office is surprisingly austere.  The office is
 clearly separated into two sides.  On the west side, a large but
 inexpensive-looking metal desk is festooned with decorations; a
 calendar covers its center, while several photos are proudly displayed
 with their faces to the door.  The desk on the east side is a standing
 oak desk, precisely arranged and nearly bare.  All of the decoration
 on that side of the room is on the walls, an array of diplomas and
 commendations.  An office chair stands in front of each desk.

 Only a single object dares to split the room: a wall-mounted
 television displaying half of a grainy black-and-white picture.

 To your south, a door leads back to the hallway.

 Below the television, there is a wall button with a typewritten sign
 taped next to it.

>go south
 Side Hall, Mt Airy Hospital
 The off-white walls and dull, stain-resistant tiles of this hallway
 match those of the main hall to the west.  Windowless doors marked
 with small brass signs branch off to the north and south.

>go west
 Hall Intersection, Mt Airy Hospital
 Cold fluorescent lights pace the ceiling from north to south and lead
 off east along the T intersection.  To the west, a pair of metal
 elevator doors sits silently closed.  There's a call button beside the
 elevator and a floor indicator above the call button.

 There's a large white butterfly flitting back and forth near the
 ceiling.

 A building map is posted on the wall.

>examine butterfly
 nothing more than folded paper.  Still, its wings beat like a real
 butterfly's wings against the slight breeze in the hallway, and it
 dances through the air with careless, casual grace.

 There seems to be something written on the butterfly, but you can't
 make out the words from here.

>take butterfly

 carefully to the ground.  Then, you untuck your notes from your armpit
 and fish out the Corona Labs keycard with minimal damage done.

 The paper butterfly traces a lazy spiral through the air before coming
 to rest on the dull white tile.  Its diamond-shaped wings flex,
 unflex, and then unfold.  The corners and edges pull apart from one
 another like some sort of magical puzzle box.

 The transformation is complete.  The butterfly is gone, and only a
 small piece of unlined paper remains.

 Alice's Diary, 5/6/78
  Today must have been different for Ian. When I came in, he greeted me
 with a plea to keep him company and keep him awake. I was glad to be
 able to help, so we talked late into the night.
  It feels like he's putting a lot of trust in me, even though he
 doesn't like to talk about his nightmares or his past. He seems to be
 afraid of himself, and said over and over that he didn't want to hurt
 anybody. He's afraid, he says, and he doesn't want to hurt anybody. It
 was hard not to laugh at the notion of Ian hurting anybody. He
 wouldn't -- couldn't -- hurt a fly.
  He really didn't want to fall asleep, but eventually he just couldn't
 stay up any longer. I tucked him in and tried to make him as
 comfortable as I could for when the nightmares came.
  I think I'm developing feelings for Ian. His eyes are so expressive
 and he feels for other people so keenly. Unprofessional or not, Ian's
 a really special person and I hope Corona's able to cure him of
 whatever it is that he's got. I wish I could do something for him.
 Protect him from his demons.
  In the meantime, I'll just do the one thing that it seems like only I
 can do:
  Care.

 Hallway, Mt Airy Hospital
 Partway down this hall, the fluorescent lights have sputtered out,
 leaving the way north cloaked in darkness.  A long, slow breeze flows
 from the south past you, reaching towards the deep shadow to the
 north.  Before the light fails, there's a bathroom door in the dull
 white wall to the east and a laundry chute to the west.

 The sterile breeze flowing north slowly stops and then reverses.  A
 long wave of bad-smelling air pushes toward you from the dense
 darkness down the hallway.

 slide headfirst down the laundry chute.  The fast, exhilarating, and
 death-free ride ends with a heartstopping plummet through space and a
 faceful of soiled sheets.  They're soft enough for you to land safely,
 but still pretty disgusting.

 Laundry, Mt Airy Hospital (in the laundry bin)
  Crumpled white sheets fill an enormous laundry bin underneath the
 chute's entrance - a great relief, since those sheets were dense
 enough to competently break your fall.  You're currently inside the
 laundry bin, but you can see the rest of the room well enough.  There
 is no mistaking the purpose of this room.  Industrial washers and
 dryers line the walls of this room.  The room stinks of offal, blood
 and bleach all at the same time.  On the east wall, a large sink made
 of heavy-duty steel sits, but its long faucet is bent at a peculiar
 angle and it is missing both handles.  A particularly large laundry
 machine looms at the end of the row.

 An open door leads south out of the room.

 There's a human skeleton lying on the tiled floor.  It's wearing a
 very clean lab coat.

 In the laundry bin you can see a hazard-suited figure.

 Side Hall End, Mt Airy Hospital
 Plain, windowless doors labelled neatly with small brass signs lead
 off to the north and south.  At the east end of the hallway, a large,
 lurid orange biohazard symbol marks a door of a different design.
 This door is a sliding door instead of a regular door, and it has a
 small, wire-reinforced window.

 Several curving, sharp pieces of glass and small pieces of metal
 litter the floor.

 There's a keycard reader beside the sliding door.

>go east

 You swipe your keycard through the keycard reader.  After a moment,
 the door emits a loud click and the airlock door slides open.

 Biohazard Airlock, Mt Airy Hospital
 You stand in a small room lit by a low red light.  It is immaculately
 clean and nearly featureless.  Two hooks are mounted on the wall; what
 appears to be a shredded environment suit hangs from one of them.
 Overhead, a set of red lamps shines down on you, mounted next to four
 spray nozzles.  A sliding door with a small wire-reinforced window
 leads back to the hallway to your west.  Another door stands to the
 east, a small opaque window set in it.

 Three large buttons, one marked "ENTRY", one marked "EXIT", and one
 marked "DECONTAMINATE", glow faintly from a wall recess.

 You can also see a typewriter key, a small-caliber pistol, a small
 brass key, a ridged key and some severed fingers here.

 You clamber awkwardly into the suit.  It takes you several minutes to

 sleeves without having to zip it up first, but after some struggling
 you are completely suited up.  You check all of the airtight zippers
 and make sure that the filter is letting you breathe properly.  You
 feel clumsy and big, but you should be protected from all but the most
 minute contaminants.  Unless the suit tears, of course.

 several of the nozzles overhead spray white foam over you and your
 surroundings.  The foam is followed immediately by several jets of
 clear liquid, which hit with staggering force.  After you are sluiced
 down, the nozzles spray a fine mist into the air, which immediately
 begins to smell of chlorine.

 After about twenty seconds, the nozzles shut off.

>wait

>push entry
 You push the button marked "ENTRY".  The internal airlock door emits a
 loud click and then slides open with a soft hiss.

 As the door slides open, you are immediately sprayed by a reddish
 liquid, which splatters against the surface of your suit.  Upon wiping
 off your faceplate with a suited arm, you see that an amorphous red
 substance is now oozing into the airlock through the partly open door.

 You flinch back from the vista beyond, where a strange, churning red
 substance has devoured almost an entire room.  Before, when you looked
 into the faceplate of the prone figure's environmental suit, you saw a
 seething red hell that consumed one man.  That was the microcosm; this
 door contains the same red hell in macrocosm.

 Biohazard Lab, Mt Airy Hospital
 This room seems to have been the subject of some kind of massive
 biological explosion. Some kind of glistening, mealy red substance
 similar to ground meat is splattered all over the floor, walls and
 ceiling in large patches. The substance seems to have a life of its
 own, pulsing and undulating in great colonies. Large piles of it merge
 and separate.

 The room itself seems to have been some kind of biological
 experimentation laboratory. You can see a large sink along one wall,
 with nozzles for a bunsen burner mounted next to it. While most of the
 counters are covered with the disgusting red substance, one table is
 mostly untouched thanks to an overhanging edge.

 On the table is a measuring pipette, fixed in place above a wooden
 test tube rack.  There's also a small lab refrigerator branded with a
 biohazard symbol.

 From the desk of Dr. Edward Atwater, M.D., Ph.D.
 April 25th, 1978
    I'll be damned, they're really buying it. McMoneagle's due to be
 dosed within the next few days.
    I am not a completely heartless man. It is a popular conceit in
 this office, and I suppose I cannot blame anyone for thinking so. But
 I have been here for years, now, and overseen the snuffing out of over
 a dozen lives. With each death I hope to the godless heavens that
 Corona will see the depth of its mistake, realize that experimenting
 with a lethal parasite and calling it a symbiont will not make wishes
 come true. If we want to join the Project it will only be through
 methodical chicanery, not methodical murder.
    What do they want of me? To become McMoneagle's friend, like
 "kindly old Doc Yehuda?" To have faith in the absence of reason, like
 "Crazy 'Lainey?" I dread to think of how crushed they will be when the
 young man's brain floods itself with chemicals. I will be the only
 staff member in his right mind.

  I know it's totally unprofessional, but I can't help but think that

  I don't know much about him. He's in an annex that's being used by an
 outside corporation for a secret project or something. I'm not even
 really supposed to talk to him, but ...
  Well, he looks so sad. He hasn't gone home in a week and a half and
 he'll be here for even longer than that, and he's got to be really
 lonely. They can't expect me to come through the room and give him
 food and change his linens and keep my mouth clamped shut the whole
 time. That's not fair to him and it's not fair to me either.
  More than food and linens and medication, what a patient like that
 needs right now is a friendly face and light conversation if he
 happens to be up late. That's not a crime, is it?
  And I've gotta admit ... he's kind of cute.

 but the last few days have been different. I've seen him tossing and

  Are they doing something to him? I'm not supposed to ask about why
 he's here. I've been sort of hoping that he would tell me something,
 but he doesn't even like to talk about the nightmares. All I can hear
 are the things he says when he's asleep, strangled bits of words.

 off east along the T intersection.  To the west, a pair of metal
 elevator doors sits silently closed.  There's a call button beside the

 Hall End, Mt Airy Hospital
 Long banks of fluorescent lights cast sharp shadows along the
 half-familiar, half-unfamiliar hallway, which continues off to the
 north.  The tiled floor is only a shade darker than the dull off-white
 walls.  A strange, unpleasant odor hangs in the air and stings your
 nostrils.  The door to Room 320 is across the hall to the west.

 A windowless door leads east into the testing room's antechamber.

>go west
 Room 320, Mt Airy Hospital
 A broad ivory spike protrudes from the floor and pierces the ceiling,
 transfixing the corpse of a slender, dark-haired woman on the way.
 Her blood stands starkly red against the dull white tile and walls.
 The room's furnishings - a hospital bed, a bookshelf, a dresser - have
 been smashed into a still-recognizable pile of twisted metal and wood
 on the west side of the room.  Thousands of pieces of shredded paper,
 none much larger than a fingernail, cover the floor near the wreckage
 and shiver in the slight breath from the broken window.  The only exit
 is to the east.

>examine alice
 The woman impaled on the white spike is dressed as you imagine a nurse
 might have been in the seventies, with a button-down skirt that must
 once have been clean white.  Her face, frozen in a look of wide-eyed
 shock, indicates asian-american heritage and youth.

 You go briefly and quickly through the dead nurse's pockets, but you
 find nothing of interest.

 Room 322, Mt Airy Hospital
 While spacious, this office is surprisingly austere.  The office is
 clearly separated into two sides.  On the west side, a large but
 inexpensive-looking metal desk is festooned with decorations; a
 calendar covers its center, while several photos are proudly displayed
 with their faces to the door.  The desk on the east side is a standing
 oak desk, precisely arranged and nearly bare.  All of the decoration
 on that side of the room is on the walls, an array of diplomas and
 commendations.  An office chair stands in front of each desk.

 Only a single object dares to split the room: a wall-mounted
 television displaying half of a grainy black-and-white picture.

 To your south, a door leads back to the hallway.

 Below the television, there is a wall button with a typewritten sign
 taped next to it.

>read sign
 without a remote supervisor. The subject is to be released by the
 remote supervisor at the signal of the local supervisor. This button
 will unlock the door for fifteen seconds, at which time a local buzzer

>examine tv
 The screen seems to be split into two halves, but one half is
 completely dark.  The other shows a familiar sight: the testing
 chamber.  A skinny young man is hunched on a chair in the corner of
 the room, next to the table.  A timestamp shows in blocky white font
 on the bottom of the monitor:  MAY 12 1978 20:02.

 Elevator, Mt Airy Hospital
 The elevator is just big enough to fit the length of a standard
 hospital gurney and not much else.  Unlike the dull white walls of the
 rest of the hall, the elevator's interior is crafted with burnished
 steel.  The fluorescent lights above shine through a thick metal
 grate.

 There are floor buttons for B through 4 on the control panel.  There
 is also a button marked "Alarm" and a key switch marked "Fire".

 Boiler Room, Mt Airy Hospital
 A single incandescent bulb behind a metal cage provides harsh yet
 inadequate light to this room.  A maze of large pipes runs along the
 ceiling.  Most of said pipes lead to a large boiler that squats in
 front of you, easily taking up three quarters of the small room's real
 estate.  A door to the north leads back to the hallway.

 A metal box is mounted on the wall, about the right size for a fire
 axe.  The glass on the front is broken, and the broken glass is strewn
 near the foot of the box.  You see no fire axe anywhere nearby.

 Autopsy Room, Mt Airy Hospital
 The air here is thin with an astringent, chemical smell that makes you

 walls of the room, with a pair of sinks in the middle of each.  Every
 surface you see is immaculate save for the metal table in the center
 of the room.  On it, a corpse in a cut-up suit has been laid in a
 spread-eagled position, with dozens of surgical tools protruding from
 its dissected torso.  Flaps of skin from the corpse's torso stretch
 towards the ceiling, suspended by thin pieces of surgical thread.

 Unofficial log, April 15, 11:00 am
    I suppose someone must have listened to Elaine's assertion that
 this test subject was different from the rest, since we've just gained
 a new member of the team.
    This was not a pleasant cup of chicory to down first thing in the
 morning. Don't get me wrong -- I would love, more than anything, to
 welcome Simon Cross to our ranks, and G-d knows that we could stand to
 gain another team member. Of all of the positions we had open prior to
 today, however, I'm not sure I ever would have counted "Company Spook"
 among them.
    Perhaps I am being unfair, but it is my opinion that hypnotizing
 yourself into believing that a knife is a rolling pin will not prevent
 you from needing stitches after trying to make bread dough. Cross's
 official title is "auditor." He claims that he is here to oversee
 Corona's professional interests in the Project, and I don't doubt him
 one bit. Cross oozes "professional interests." He brushes his teeth
 with it, or he wouldn't be able to give me that sharkish grin.
    Still, we are bedfellows now. There's nothing to do but see to it
 that he is comfortable ... and bored.

 Morgue, Mt Airy Hospital
 The astringent smell is even stronger in the morgue than in the
 autopsy room.  The single working fluorescent light here flickers
 slightly, giving your movement a cinematic cast to it.  The east wall
 of the morgue is lined with large drawers for corpse storage, like a
 giant, morbid filing cabinet.  Along the north wall is a counter with
 a large industrial sink.  Nearby, a hospital gurney squats at an odd
 angle, one of its wheels bent sharply to the side. There is a spatter
 of dried blood on the drawers, marring the otherwise spartan
 cleanliness of the area.  The doors beneath the large counter stand
 open, exposing steel pipes and a wastebasket.

 A heavy glass door to the west leads back to the autopsy room.

 Laundry, Mt Airy Hospital
 There is no mistaking the purpose of this room.  Industrial washers
 and dryers line the walls of this room, and three canvas-walled carts
 filled with dirty linens squat awaiting their purpose.  The room
 stinks of offal, blood and bleach all at the same time.  On the east
 wall, a large sink made of heavy-duty steel sits, but its long faucet
 is bent at a peculiar angle and it is missing both handles.  A
 particularly large laundry machine looms at the end of the row.

 An open door leads south out of the room.

 There's a human skeleton lying on the tiled floor.  It's wearing a
 very clean lab coat.

 You can also see a laundry bin (in which is a heap of soiled sheets)
 here.

>put coat in machine
 You drop the bloodstained lab coat into the cilia-filled tube of the

 The overhead lights are shattered to the north and south, leaving this
 solitary space brightly lit in the white-walled hallway.  Looking to
 the south, you can glimpse the dim squares of light that are the

 doors are to the west.

 There is a handwritten menu taped below the placard.

>go east
 Cafeteria, Mt Airy Hospital
 The hospital's cafeteria is not very large, but it's still enough to
 seat a few dozen people at a time.  Rows of rectangular tables covered
 in wood veneer are surrounded by a gauntlet of cheap chairs made of
 metal and molded plastic.  The ceiling is higher here than elsewhere
 in the hospital; the fluorescent lights hang down, surrounded by a
 maze of exposed pipe running through the room.  A gap in the wall to
 the east looks into a strange fleshy tube, and below it, a set of
 metal rails is mounted on the wall, suitable for resting a tray on.

 the way your ribs collide with a rectangular table and the way your
 body collapses to the floor, but you're not there any more.

>undo
 Press any key to continue.








 You reorient slowly.  You're still in a cafeteria, but you recognize
 this place - surrounded by the cheerful bustle of chatty office
 workers from elsewhere in the building, you sat here and drank tea
 with Dr. Ephart.

 Your awareness doubles - you remember drinking tea with Dr. Ephart
 after signing your guinea pig contract, but there's an echo in your
 mind, the echo of tens or hundreds of other snacks and meals grabbed
 quickly in this room, either alone or with others.  These thoughts
 aren't yours, but they strike and dissolve upon your own thoughts like
 falling raindrops, shifting them subtly with every touch.  Grasping
 for inner purchase, you come up with a name:

 Abeni - no, Elizabeth, Elizabeth "Best" - Ife.

 And with the name comes identity:

 I said my name was Elizabeth, and they called me Betsy, then Bets.
 When Marlene's kid garbled it to Best, I kept it - that was perfect!
 I'll be the best they've ever seen.  A lab tech now, but that's just
 the start.  I'm as good as anyone else in Corona, and if they really
 just care about skill - well, this is the way in and the way up.  Even
 for a woman.  Even for a foreigner.  To hell with their prejudices.

 Her thoughts are inflicted strangely - there's a lilt to them, a sway.
 You realize that she isn't really thinking in English, but you seem to
 be translating it well enough.  Still, focusing on her mind is like
 staring into a driving rainstorm - it blinds you and dazes you with
 its force.  You shift your focus outward and see:

 Break Room
 Only a few hours ago, the room was bustling with people from the
 building's various offices, but now it's completely empty save for you
 and the furniture.  The room is large enough to be a cafeteria, but
 apart from a dozen or so cafeteria tables, it isn't furnished like
 one.  The room bears only a small kitchenette with a fridge,
 microwave, sink, and a tabletop espresso machine.

 The exit to the hallway is opposite the kitchenette, to the west.

 hair is braided back with a set of gold and blue beads.

 A loud noise like a gunshot erupts from the espresso machine, and you
 flinch back from it.  A powerful blast of vapor issues from the
 espresso machine's nozzle, shattering the demitasse into tiny shards.
 Menacing steam begins to leak from other crevices in the device.

>go west
 the door violently bursts, spraying hot water vapor across the
 entrance. You are trapped inside the cafeteria.

 Unprompted, the microwave lights up, turning on.  The bowl inside
 slowly rotates.

>turn off microwave

 The bowl in the microwave begins to bubble over with overheated
 liquid.

>break microwave

 The microwave fills with steam. You begin to hear strange noises from
 the pipes above you.

 Caught in the power of Best's mind, strung out on her confusion and
 alarm, you fight to preserve your thoughts.  You are not Best Ife,
 Elizabeth Ife, Abeni Ife - you are yourself.  This isn't you.

>turn on sink

 The microwave suddenly bursts open, billowing clouds of hot steam.  As
 if on cue, you hear a deafening report from the back of the
 refrigerator and see steam jet out from behind it.

 She's going to die.  You can feel her death coming.

>open satchel

 A groaning noise comes from above.

 But this isn't you.  This isn't how you die.

>look in satchel

 In the white satchel are a Richard Feynman biography and a large red
 paperback.

 With a hideous shriek, the maze of pipes above you explodes, issuing a
 wave of superheated water vapor.  You cannot escape the steam as it
 fills the room.  Best gasps for breath as she is bathed in burning
 moisture.

 Not you.  Not you!

>read paperback
 You're out of time.

 Best stumbles toward the exit, but not fast enough.  She collapses to
 the ground, unable to take a breath, literally boiling alive. As she
 tumbles to the floor, her blurring vision documents the way her skin
 peels away against the edge of a tile, and her ravaged nerves report
 the fiery sensation all the way up her arm.  She covers her head with
 her arms and succumbs to the loss of her senses.

 Not you.

 Your mind flees from hers, and Abeni Elizabeth Ife dies alone in a
 watery hell.

 The hospital's cafeteria is not very large, but it's still enough to
 seat a few dozen people at a time.  Rows of rectangular tables covered
 in wood veneer are surrounded by a gauntlet of cheap chairs made of
 metal and molded plastic.  The ceiling is higher here than elsewhere
 in the hospital; the fluorescent lights hang down, surrounded by a

 A single incandescent bulb behind a metal cage provides harsh yet

 A metal box is mounted on the wall, about the right size for a fire

 your mind reels strangely.  It seems like the hiss is as much within
 your head as outside it, and you feel very peculiar.  The room twists
 sideways....

 As your outer eyes close, your inner eye opens.  Dimly, you perceive
 the way your ribs collide with a rectangular table and the way your
 body collapses to the floor, but you're not there any more.

 Press any key to continue.








 You reorient slowly.  You're still in a cafeteria, but you recognize
 this place - surrounded by the cheerful bustle of chatty office
 workers from elsewhere in the building, you sat here and drank tea
 with Dr. Ephart.

 Your awareness doubles - you remember drinking tea with Dr. Ephart
 after signing your guinea pig contract, but there's an echo in your
 mind, the echo of tens or hundreds of other snacks and meals grabbed
 quickly in this room, either alone or with others.  These thoughts
 aren't yours, but they strike and dissolve upon your own thoughts like
 falling raindrops, shifting them subtly with every touch.  Grasping
 for inner purchase, you come up with a name:

 Abeni - no, Elizabeth, Elizabeth "Best" - Ife.

 And with the name comes identity:

 I said my name was Elizabeth, and they called me Betsy, then Bets.
 When Marlene's kid garbled it to Best, I kept it - that was perfect!
 I'll be the best they've ever seen.  A lab tech now, but that's just
 the start.  I'm as good as anyone else in Corona, and if they really
 just care about skill - well, this is the way in and the way up.  Even
 for a woman.  Even for a foreigner.  To hell with their prejudices.

 Her thoughts are inflicted strangely - there's a lilt to them, a sway.
 You realize that she isn't really thinking in English, but you seem to
 be translating it well enough.  Still, focusing on her mind is like
 staring into a driving rainstorm - it blinds you and dazes you with
 its force.  You shift your focus outward and see:

 Break Room
 Only a few hours ago, the room was bustling with people from the
 building's various offices, but now it's completely empty save for you
 and the furniture.  The room is large enough to be a cafeteria, but
 apart from a dozen or so cafeteria tables, it isn't furnished like
 one.  The room bears only a small kitchenette with a fridge,
 microwave, sink, and a tabletop espresso machine.

 The exit to the hallway is opposite the kitchenette, to the west.

 Best needs espresso, badly!

 amazement, you loved it.  You need to give this one back and get your
 own copy.  It's called Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!  For a
 physicist, Richard Feynman got up to some absolutely crazy shit -
 playing the bongos, going to Japan and Brazil, sending puzzle letters
 with his wife to dodge the government censors, and so on.

 You even had the chance to try out one of his stunts.  After reading
 about how he cracked all the locks at Los Alamos, you went wandering
 around the building in search of locks to try his techniques on, and
 you went into a whole bunch of filing cabinets with no one the wiser.
 You also found this great old desk hidden in the basement with a safe
 bolted onto it.  That was totally weird!  You managed to get it open,
 and there were even some papers inside....

 That's been bothering you, a bit - because the papers in there were
 old, but they talked about a set of experiments that sounded very
 familiar.  There's no way anyone else could know about Naegleria
 splendens, is there?  You passed them over to Dr. Ephart - she'll
 figure out what to do from here.

 Where is your mind going?  You must need that espresso very badly!

 Something inside you (not Best, but you) snaps shut like a clamshell,
 preserving that moment and that memory.  It might be important....

 but... maybe you should lay back on the caffeine a little.  People
 joke about how wired you get.  But you like the feeling - being up and
 high and confident and capable.  Having the world melt away in a
 headache is much less fun.

 You turn away from the espresso machine and start toward the hallway,
 but you're interrupted by a strange noise.  Looking back, you see that
 the steam wand of the espresso machine has started spewing vapor.
 That's extremely weird.

 The steam wand of the espresso machine continues to spew hot vapor.

>wait

 A loud noise like a gunshot erupts from the espresso machine, and you
 flinch back from it.  A powerful blast of vapor issues from the
 espresso machine's nozzle, shattering the demitasse into tiny shards.
 Menacing steam begins to leak from other crevices in the device.

>wait

 Unprompted, the microwave lights up, turning on.  The bowl inside
 slowly rotates.

>wait

 The bowl in the microwave begins to bubble over with overheated
 liquid.

>wait

 The microwave fills with steam. You begin to hear strange noises from
 the pipes above you.

 Caught in the power of Best's mind, strung out on her confusion and
 alarm, you fight to preserve your thoughts.  You are not Best Ife,
 Elizabeth Ife, Abeni Ife - you are yourself.  This isn't you.

>wait

 The microwave suddenly bursts open, billowing clouds of hot steam.  As
 if on cue, you hear a deafening report from the back of the
 refrigerator and see steam jet out from behind it.

 She's going to die.  You can feel her death coming.

>wait

 A groaning noise comes from above.  Looking up, you discover a maze of
 pipes wending over the ceiling and down the walls - pipes that, Best
 thinks dazedly, almost certainly weren't there at lunchtime.

 But this isn't you.  This isn't how you die.

>wait

 With a hideous shriek, the maze of pipes above you explodes, issuing a
 wave of superheated water vapor.  You cannot escape the steam as it
 fills the room.  Best gasps for breath as she is bathed in burning
 moisture.

 Not you.  Not you!

>read paperback
 You're out of time.

 Best stumbles toward the exit, but not fast enough.  She collapses to
 the ground, unable to take a breath, literally boiling alive. As she
 tumbles to the floor, her blurring vision documents the way her skin
 peels away against the edge of a tile, and her ravaged nerves report
 the fiery sensation all the way up her arm.  She covers her head with
 her arms and succumbs to the loss of her senses.

 Not you.

 Your mind flees from hers, and Abeni Elizabeth Ife dies alone in a
 watery hell.

 Room 322, Mt Airy Hospital
 While spacious, this office is surprisingly austere.  The office is
 clearly separated into two sides.  On the west side, a large but
 inexpensive-looking metal desk is festooned with decorations; a
 calendar covers its center, while several photos are proudly displayed
 with their faces to the door.  The desk on the east side is a standing
 oak desk, precisely arranged and nearly bare.  All of the decoration
 on that side of the room is on the walls, an array of diplomas and
 commendations.  An office chair stands in front of each desk.

 Only a single object dares to split the room: a wall-mounted
 television displaying half of a grainy black-and-white picture.

 To your south, a door leads back to the hallway.

 Resting your fingers on the dial for a moment, you close your eyes and
 call up Best's memory.

 The room was shadowed and full of dust.  How long since anyone had
 been down there?  Since you'd picked the lock to get into the room in
 the first place, probably pretty long, but you were so bored, and
 exploring was fun.

 The safe was a surprise.  What a weird old desk, with the safe bolted
 onto its leg!  You tried to open it, but it was still locked.  You
 leaned into it just a bit, and you started turning the dial slowly,
 feeling the numbers shift under your fingers.  You recognized the
 little shift in friction when it came - "you don't have to sandpaper
 your fingertips", Feynman wrote, and he was right.  It was amazing - a
 small success, a minor exploration, but perfect all the same.

 Releasing the memory, you open your eyes.  The safe opens under your

 Hall End, Mt Airy Hospital
 The air here has an acrid, biological tang to it that reminds you of
 little so much as fresh vomit. The nauseating stench is aided by a
 hot, humid breeze, which seems to oscillate through the hallway. The
 hallway itself continues to the east, but you cannot see far; the only
 functioning light is the one directly above you, and the hall quickly
 fades into an impenetrable darkness.

 A gray door to your north is clearly marked by a large pictographic

 the door along the edge of the hallway.

 water better than the touch of flesh - yet something about that, the

 from its brief owner.

 S.C. - Entry 1978-04-15-1400

 Mr. Schuyler was right; there is entirely too much humanity in this
 project.
 Only Atwater displays even the remotest scrap of professional
 detachment, which he manages to keep entirely useless through the
 judicious application of insecurity and megalomania. Yehuda, while
 observant and quick-thinking, is entirely too compassionate and will
 be doddering before his time, should he live so long. Buchanan, no
 matter how much faith Mr. Schuyler has in her abilities, is little
 more than a hippie who lacked the good graces to be born in the
 correct decade.
 I have no doubt that my presence has their dander up. I will never be
 able to oil my smile so much that it would not arouse their collective
 suspicion. But that's of no consequence. They know their jobs, shaken
 nerves will not deter them, and this is precisely as it should be.
 Should they do their jobs, mine will be boring and that is ideal.
 I am, of course, prepared for the alternative.

 S.C. - Entry 1978-05-07-0400

 "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy."
 Atwater spoke to me about the possibility of terminating McMoneagle.
 It is true and observable that Ian has suffered more severe effects
 than any of the previous test recipients had before their brains
 succumbed to the symbiont's side effects. Since Atwater has never had
 faith in the possible success of the project, psychotic reactions hold
 no hope for him. He would just as soon destroy the subject and move to
 the next.
 What I did not know upon this meeting is that Atwater had given an
 innocuous excuse to Yehuda concerning his absence from the test -- a
 trip to the store. This rendered him an adequate target for a remote
 viewing session, by Yehuda's reckoning. Ian "overheard" Atwater's
 conversation with me and became overwrought.
 When he went to sleep, his psychic abilities manifested, somehow
 dealing severe trauma to Atwater's heart. By the time the doctor was
 taken to the hospital, he was already dead.
 While I was notified almost immediately, this is going to be
 incredibly inconvenient to keep quiet and controlled. Elaine should be
 easy to manipulate; her faith in the project will ensure her loyalty.
 Yehuda will be another matter. I will speak to him directly, but even
 then I will need to keep an eye on the man. He has too much humanity
 to be a good Doctor.
 I realize that it is my job to babysit the ignorant, but that does not
 keep it from being infuriating.

 "LOOK UP [topic] IN FILES".]

 In the black filing cabinet, you see a set of files relating to
 employee records.

>look up yehuda in black cabinet
 for Yehuda, Theodore.

 Dr. Yehuda's file contains mainly research on him and his work in the
 study of neuroscience.  A few performance reviews from other offices
 are in the file, which you're not entirely certain is legal.  The
 paperwork pertinent to Corona, Inc indicates that the doctor signed on
 with Corona in early April, 1978, immediately assuming a position as
 the head of the project.  One of the reports has holes cut out of it.
 You suspect that there may be information missing from the report.

 You put the file back where you found it.

>look up elaine in black cabinet
 for Buchanan, Elaine Geraldine.

 It takes you a few moments to parse the disparate and heavily censored
 information in the file, but you are eventually able to make sense of
 it.  It seems as though she was originally an applicant for an
 Institute that was doing contract work for some kind of government
 Project.  The name of both project and institute have been excised
 from all documents where they are mentioned, clipped out with
 scissors.  Elaine was rejected by the Institute as unsuitable, and
 headhunted by Corona not a week later, judging by her interview notes.
 Her recruitment took place sometime in 1977, before April.  Since
 then, it appears that Elaine has acted as some kind of scout, seeking
 out suitable test patients and doing field research.

 You put the file back where you found it.

>look up ian in black cabinet
 for McMoneagle, Ian.

  Ian's file is one of the thickest in the cabinet, filled with past
 medical reports and research.  Ian was born on October 30th, 1955 in
 Olney, Maryland to John McMoneagle, a general store manager, and Olive
 McMoneagle. Judging by the neatly-organized and annotated transcripts,
 Ian was very bright but did poorly in school due to depressive
 behavior.  A few reports of incidents illustrate that Ian was a
 frequent victim of bullying, and even the teachers and administration
 of his schools found his behavior off-putting.  His medical records
 indicate a history of chronic headaches and nightmares.  Ian was
 recruited as a test subject for Corona Laboratories in mid-April of
 1978.

 You put the file back where you found it.

>look up alice in black cabinet
 for Kim, Alice.

 Its contents reveal that Alice is a nurse at Mt. Airy, and she has
 been working for the hospital for about six months.  Alice was born on
 May 14, 1955, in Wheaton, Maryland, to Seung and Mary Kim.  While
 there isn't much more specific information about Alice, her
 performance review indicates that while Alice "sometimes lacks
 procedural knowledge," she is a patient favorite, known for her
 "bright and cheerful outlook", and people note that she "never seems
 to have a bad day."

 You put the file back where you found it.

 A single sheet of paper lies in the folder. In its center, a simple
 message has been typed in a bold serif font: "This space intentionally
 left blank."

 You put the file back where you found it.

>look up atwater in black cabinet
 for Atwater, Edward.

 The files indicate that Dr. Atwater had a solid career in medicine for
 about 30 years before signing on with Corona Labs in 1977.  Dr.
 Atwater was initially the lead physician in charge of Corona's project
 here at Mt. Airy Hospital, but about a month ago he stepped down from
 that role to be replaced by Dr. Yehuda.  The reason for this is not
 explicitly stated in the file, and you can't help but feel that there
 may be some information purposefully left out.

 You put the file back where you found it.

>look up pearce in black cabinet
 for Pearce, Raymond, MD.

 The folder is thick with files, mainly reports, commendations and
 reviews.  Near the front and the back you find some basic information:
 Dr. Pearce was born on October 15th, 1915, in Northwest Washington,
 DC.  There isn't much about his personal life, but it appears that the
 Doctor's progression through the hospital's ranks was gradual and
 measured; his most recent promotion was two years ago, to the position
 of the hospital's assistant director.  Nothing else that you find is
 of value.

 Side Hall End, Mt Airy Hospital
 Plain, windowless doors labelled neatly with small brass signs lead

 lurid orange biohazard symbol marks a door of a different design.
 This door is a sliding door instead of a regular door, and it has a
 small, wire-reinforced window.

 Several curving, sharp pieces of glass and small pieces of metal
 litter the floor.

 There's a keycard reader beside the sliding door.

 You swipe your keycard through the keycard reader.  After a moment,
 the door emits a loud click and the airlock door slides open.

 Biohazard Airlock, Mt Airy Hospital
 You stand in a small room lit by a low red light.  It is immaculately
 clean and nearly featureless.  Two hooks are mounted on the wall; what
 appears to be a shredded environment suit hangs from one of them.
 Overhead, a set of red lamps shines down on you, mounted next to four
 spray nozzles.  A sliding door with a small wire-reinforced window
 leads back to the hallway to your west.  Another door stands to the
 east, a small opaque window set in it.

 Three large buttons, one marked "ENTRY", one marked "EXIT", and one
 marked "DECONTAMINATE", glow faintly from a wall recess.

>examine suit
 It's a thin white hazard suit. While not very durable, a combination
 of a charcoal air filter and an airtight fiber weave should serve to
 protect the wearer from most environmental hazards.

 You pick up the clean hazard suit.

 You clamber awkwardly into the suit.  It takes you several minutes to
 figure out how to get your hands into the gloves at the end of the
 sleeves without having to zip it up first, but after some struggling
 you are completely suited up.  You check all of the airtight zippers
 and make sure that the filter is letting you breathe properly.  You
 feel clumsy and big, but you should be protected from all but the most
 minute contaminants.  Unless the suit tears, of course.

 As the door slides open, you are immediately sprayed by a reddish
 liquid, which splatters against the surface of your suit.  Upon wiping
 off your faceplate with a suited arm, you see that an amorphous red
 substance is now oozing into the airlock through the partly open door.

 You flinch back from the vista beyond, where a strange, churning red
 substance has devoured almost an entire room.  Before, when you looked
 into the faceplate of the prone figure's environmental suit, you saw a
 seething red hell that consumed one man.  That was the microcosm; this
 door contains the same red hell in macrocosm.

 Biohazard Lab, Mt Airy Hospital
 This room seems to have been the subject of some kind of massive
 biological explosion. Some kind of glistening, mealy red substance
 similar to ground meat is splattered all over the floor, walls and
 ceiling in large patches. The substance seems to have a life of its
 own, pulsing and undulating in great colonies. Large piles of it merge
 and separate.

 The room itself seems to have been some kind of biological
 experimentation laboratory. You can see a large sink along one wall,
 with nozzles for a bunsen burner mounted next to it. While most of the
 counters are covered with the disgusting red substance, one table is
 mostly untouched thanks to an overhanging edge.

 On the table is a measuring pipette, fixed in place above a wooden
 test tube rack.  There's also a small lab refrigerator branded with a
 biohazard symbol.

 From the desk of Dr. Edward Atwater, M.D., Ph.D.
 April 25th, 1978
    I'll be damned, they're really buying it. McMoneagle's due to be
 dosed within the next few days.
    I am not a completely heartless man. It is a popular conceit in
 this office, and I suppose I cannot blame anyone for thinking so. But
 I have been here for years, now, and overseen the snuffing out of over
 a dozen lives. With each death I hope to the godless heavens that
 Corona will see the depth of its mistake, realize that experimenting
 with a lethal parasite and calling it a symbiont will not make wishes
 come true. If we want to join the Project it will only be through
 methodical chicanery, not methodical murder.
    What do they want of me? To become McMoneagle's friend, like
 "kindly old Doc Yehuda?" To have faith in the absence of reason, like
 "Crazy 'Lainey?" I dread to think of how crushed they will be when the
 young man's brain floods itself with chemicals. I will be the only
 staff member in his right mind.
    I am not a monster. I am a doctor. To hell with anyone who doesn't
 understand that.

 Room 322, Mt Airy Hospital
 While spacious, this office is surprisingly austere.  The office is
 clearly separated into two sides.  On the west side, a large but
 inexpensive-looking metal desk is festooned with decorations; a
 calendar covers its center, while several photos are proudly displayed
 with their faces to the door.  The desk on the east side is a standing
 oak desk, precisely arranged and nearly bare.  All of the decoration
 on that side of the room is on the walls, an array of diplomas and
 commendations.  An office chair stands in front of each desk.

 Only a single object dares to split the room: a wall-mounted
 television displaying half of a grainy black-and-white picture.

 To your south, a door leads back to the hallway.

 Below the television, there is a wall button with a typewritten sign

 To the southwest, muffled by the walls, you hear a strident buzzer,
 and the noise of high heels suddenly echoes down the hallway from that
 direction.  The footsteps pause, and you hear the sound of a door
 opening.

 In the security monitor, you see the young man jerk his head upward
 suddenly.  This is your first good look at his face, and his features
 are gaunt, his eyes sunken and haunted.  He slowly gets to his feet
 and walks out of the range of the security camera.

 Hall End, Mt Airy Hospital
 Long banks of fluorescent lights cast sharp shadows along the
 half-familiar, half-unfamiliar hallway, which continues off to the
 north.  The tiled floor is only a shade darker than the dull off-white
 walls.  A strange, unpleasant odor hangs in the air and stings your
 nostrils.  The door to Room 320 is across the hall to the west.

 A windowless door leads east into the testing room's antechamber.

 The strident buzzer continues to sound.

>go east
 Antechamber, Mt Airy Hospital
 Your last visit to this room was your last breath of normalcy; now,
 the madness has spread even here.  A pile of shattered bones, gore and
 viscera lies in a wide cone, sprayed toward the door through which you
 entered.  Blood drips from the walls and ceiling in the shape of that
 same cone, pelting you with a gentle crimson rain.  The most complete
 part of the remains is a single high-heeled shoe, which lies just in
 front of the pile.  The ficus tree that previously stood in the corner
 now lies on its side, its leaves glistening with blood.  Its pot, now
 cracked, lies on its side in a pile of blood-drenched topsoil.

 A metal fire axe lies on the far side of the floor.

 your ears, but on your mind.  The world warps strangely around you,

 The door slams shut behind you with tremendous force.

 Test Chamber, Mt Airy Hospital
 While you are not entirely sure what you expected to find, you are
 halted in your tracks nonetheless.  The floor of the test chamber is
 littered with glittering shards of reflective glass.  The one-way
 mirror between the test chamber and the observation room is opaque,
 but it pushes outward in the center to form a pair of jagged,
 irregular halves like a pair of jaws.  From the hips up, Ian
 McMoneagle is trapped in the grip of those jaws, his face twisted into
 a mask of pain.  The mirror's halves grind against muscle and bone,
 tearing him apart as they draw him in.  And yet he lives....

 Ian McMoneagle looks you in the face with wide, terrified eyes, his
 bloody bangs obscuring his gaze but not reducing its weight.  He opens
 his mouth and screams in guilty agony.

 The mirror pulls Ian in more deeply.  The hideous cracking sound that
 follows is almost surely his pelvis.

 screams stop, and he stares at the bones.

 Following his gaze, you see that the fingerbones are gone.  What lies
 on the ground is a set of twelve six-sided game dice, each one showing
 a single pip facing upward.  Six sets of snake eyes stare up at you
 and Ian.  You stare back.

 The room vibrates for a few seconds, and then reality shatters.  You
 both shatter with it.

 Press any key to continue.








 A darkened office. The orange light of dusk spilling through venetian
 blinds, laying bright stripes on the dark wood of an expensive luxury
 desk.

 With a satisfying clatter, six dice bounce across the surface of the
 desk, coming to rest with assorted results: 6 6 2 6 3 1.  The man who
 threw them, a middle-aged man with a face craggier than his age should
 allow, wears Brylcreemed black hair, a power suit, and the receiver of
 an office telephone held firmly to the side of his head.

 "No, John, let me tell YOU something," he says. "The Schuyler family
 didn't get to be where it is because we refused to take risks.  This
 stuff is the real deal, and whoever pulls it off first is going to be
 set for generations."

 He grabs three of the dice, leaving the three that show sixes.  With
 an offhand gesture, he tosses them again.  One of the three comes up a
 six.  "Look, this Buchanan broad is too hippy dippy for the Institute,
 but she's the real deal and she'll do anything for a break.  They want
 to look legit, fine, but they won't land the project.  We will."

 He picks up one of the unlucky dice, then the other.  He pauses for a
 moment, listening to the phone, then laughs.  "Well, John, I imagine
 she'll go nuts after a little while, but if you're not willing to
 squeeze an orange hard enough, you'll never get a glass of juice.
 Well, all right John.  Talk to you later."

 The man hangs up the phone, then throws the final two dice one last
 time.  Both come up sixes.  He leans back in his chair and smiles.

 "Heh-heh," he says. "Yahtzee."

 Then, he puts five dice back in the game box and one die in his
 pocket, and he saunters off to dinner.

 Something in the stump of his throat moves. Widening the throat,
 something emerges from his windpipe: a single veiny eyeball supported
 on a pink, pulsating stalk.  It swivels to stare at you.

 The mirror continues to chew at Ian, drawing him into its surface with
 razor-sharp shard-teeth.

>hit eyeball
 And from deep inside the headless body, there comes a dreadful
 keening....

 The mirror begins to bubble, like a photograph exposed to flame.
 Great silver blisters form in its surface, and the blisters slowly
 turn white from front to back.  Only a few heartbeats pass before the
 entire mirror is comprised of large white mounds.  Then, all at once,
 a black spot with a dark green iris appears at the center of each
 mound, and they all swivel to stare directly at you.  The surface of
 the mirror, now perfectly still, has become a wall of eyes.  The
 combined gaze bores savagely into you as the body of Ian McMoneagle
 collapses at your feet.

 Paralyzed, you stare back, completely unable to move.

 You wake up with a start in your room.

 You awaken in your bed surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar faces -
 Dr. Shaunessy, the neurologist; Rayjay Farley and Best Ife, the lab
 techs; the wheelchair-bound Dr. Ensfield, previously familiar to you
 only at a distance; a slim, chestnut-haired woman with a cool gray
 gaze, utterly unknown to you.  Dr. Ephart is missing.

 Dr. Shaunessy has a closed eye on his forehead.  So does Rayjay.  So
 does Best.  They all do.

 You open your mouth to say something, but the noise that comes out is
 scarcely more coherent than a frightened blubber.  Dr. Shaunessy opens
 his mouth, but all that you can hear is a bizarre echoing noise that
 bounces around the inside of your head like an over-loud metro
 announcement in an empty station.  You try to speak again, but the
 noise you make sounds like nothing you could ever produce.

 Concerned, the team surrounds you, staring down.  You shrink down into
 your pillow, looking fearfully from third eye to closed third eye.
 The eyes are going to open.  You can feel it.  You can sense it.  You
 shrink back with terror - and then you shriek with it, clawing for
 escape.

 Best and Rayjay grab your arms, lightning quick.  It's all too much -
 pinned down, you faint away.

 Your fitful consciousness leads the doctors to strap you down to your
 own bed.  You flit in and out of restless sleep, beset by nightmares
 that stalk you through the waking world with just as much confidence
 as the sleeping world.  You feel the eyeballs in the walls; you feel
 the chewing in your mind.  Ian's keening echoes in your manacles.
 Simon Cross tears off his fingers and leaves them in your water glass.
 Best's warm smile turns into a frozen stare and then a full-throated
 scream of horror when the eyeballs ripple open on her right arm.

 Best flees your room, still screaming, and you don't know what happens
 after that.  Don't you?  You don't.

 Press any key to continue.








 You'd like to think you don't.  But you do.  You know how Best pats at
 her arm and pushes at the deformity and tries to close it, hide it,
 lock it away somehow, sobbing helplessly, hating herself for the
 breakdown even as she breaks down.  The eyelashes flutter against her
 fingertips, and she screams in pain when she pokes the iris
 accidentally.

 She can't hide and the other doctors find her, but when she looks at
 them, they recoil from her - from themselves - from the walls - and
 they can see what you see.  They see the third eyes, tightly shut; the
 eyes in the walls, staring and open; the lines of typewritten text
 that headless Ian, keening in despair, draws around them like a noose.

 Elaine Buchanan stands at your bedside, stroking your hair as they
 die.  Her handwriting covers the walls and she writes straight through
 the eyeballs without stopping.  Sclera drips from her fingers as
 topsoil drips from her shoulders.

 There's nothing you can do.  It's out and you can't keep it in.
 There's nothing at all that you can do.....

 from an unknown source.  You fight to understand.  You were
 unconscious for three days, he tells you, after collapsing during a
 memory test.  The project will continue if you feel up for it after a
 few days of rest, but right now everyone's going to take it easy.

 You want to know where Dr. Ephart went.  Dr. Shaughnessy says that she
 was transferred to another project because she adjusted your
 medication doses inappropriately, contributing to your attack.  In the
 corner, the chestnut-haired woman with the bullet eyes stares at you.
 It all seems wrong, wrong.  Everyone is alive and dead.  Walking
 around one moment, shambling with fatal wounds the next.

 Nightmares plague you that night - Dr. Ephart, confused and
 protesting, gunned down by the chestnut-haired woman; Dr. Ensfield
 screaming and covering his ears in an elevator shaft; Rayjay Farley
 staring into static as the static takes him apart.  And Ian.  Over and

 McMoneagle, wild with fear and guilt, being devoured by the walls.

 But you can't stop it now.

 Your protestations turn to abjurations.  Your abjurations turn to
 ravings.  You must make them listen, and your efforts become more
 violent; you plead, you cry, you lose control, you scream and rave.
 It is not long before the youngest and strongest of the staff, Rayjay
 and Best, strap you to your bed with sad, worried eyes.

 But straps will only hold you down while you're still harmless.

 Once it gets out
 they'll all die.

 Just like you saw.


           Three days later, your dreams come to life in Corona Labs.
                             No one escapes alive.

 screaming suddenly goes from a muted, ignorable presence to a
 hammering agony on your ears.

 The screaming from inside the test chamber hammers down, not only on
 your ears, but on your mind.  The world warps strangely around you,
 and, quite abruptly, you are somewhere else.

 The door slams shut behind you with tremendous force.

 Test Chamber, Mt Airy Hospital
 While you are not entirely sure what you expected to find, you are
 halted in your tracks nonetheless.  The floor of the test chamber is
 littered with glittering shards of reflective glass.  The one-way
 mirror between the test chamber and the observation room is opaque,
 but it pushes outward in the center to form a pair of jagged,
 irregular halves like a pair of jaws.  From the hips up, Ian
 McMoneagle is trapped in the grip of those jaws, his face twisted into
 a mask of pain.  The mirror's halves grind against muscle and bone,
 tearing him apart as they draw him in.  And yet he lives....

 Ian McMoneagle looks you in the face with wide, terrified eyes, his
 bloody bangs obscuring his gaze but not reducing its weight.  He opens
 his mouth and screams in guilty agony.

 The mirror pulls Ian in more deeply.  The hideous cracking sound that
 follows is almost surely his pelvis.

 home.  The solution enters his body, and his screams, for just a
 moment, are stilled.

 You watch him anxiously for some sign of change as you withdraw the
 needle, but nothing obvious happens.  The mirror bites down again, and
 his screams renew.

 The mirror continues to chew at Ian, drawing him into its surface with
 razor-sharp shard-teeth.

 You twist off the lid of the Sandepam and hesitate over the pills for

 little bit less sharp.  If only you'd found these a little earlier in
 the nightmare.

 stained with what must be his own blood.  The lower half of his body
 is hidden by the glass jaws that are chewing him up from the bottom to
 the top.

 With the sound of glass grinding against glass, the mirror-glass draws
 Ian all the way in and shuts its uneven jaws.  There is a brief and
 terrible silence before the mirror shatters cataclysmically.

 Shards of glass fly past you, shredding your skin and muscle.  You
 feel tiny pieces piercing your eyes, driving into your brain, flaying
 you alive.  You stumble and fall onto a floor covered in razor-sharp
 pieces.  There is no mercy; as you twitch in spasmodic anguish, lanced
 repeatedly through the cerebrum and cerebellum, everything goes
 dark....

 Consciousness returns.  You muzzily realize that you are gazing at the
 ceiling of the Corona Labs test chamber just before the door slams
 open.  Dr. Shaunessy, the neurologist, hurries into the room.  Dr.
 Ephart follows close enough behind to step on his heels.  "How many
 fingers do you see?" Dr. Shaunessy asks, kneeling down beside you, and
 Dr. Ephart rests light fingers on your wrist to take your pulse.  In
 short order, they conclude that you suffered a vasovagal syncope and
 struck your head in the fall.

 You try to talk to the doctors, but your words are confused and
 disjointed.  Your gaze drags across the fallen photograph,
 half-shadowed by the folder above it, and you see the gaunt young man
 screaming.  You can't find the words to make them understand.  Though
 you can nearly stand on your own, the doctors firmly escort you from
 the room and off to bed.

 Dr. Shaunessy leaves, but Dr. Ephart stays with you as the sedatives
 take hold.  "Don't worry," she says, resting a gentle hand on your
 shoulder.  "Everything will be all right."

 Your last visit to this room was your last breath of normalcy; now,
 the madness has spread even here.  A pile of shattered bones, gore and
 viscera lies in a wide cone, sprayed toward the door through which you
 entered.  Blood drips from the walls and ceiling in the shape of that
 same cone, pelting you with a gentle crimson rain.  The most complete
 part of the remains is a single high-heeled shoe, which lies just in
 front of the pile.  The ficus tree that previously stood in the corner
 now lies on its side, its leaves glistening with blood.  Its pot, now
 cracked, lies on its side in a pile of blood-drenched topsoil.

 You blink awake slowly in your room at modern-day Corona Labs.  Your
 third eye seems to flicker open before your real ones do; you find
 yourself unconsciously probing the room.  There are people here, and
 they are familiar to you.  They are alive.  They are your team.  You
 blink your way to bleary-eyed consciousness and turn your head
 slightly to look at them.

 There they all are, gathered in a ring at the foot of your bed: Dr.
 Shaunessy, the neurologist; Best Ife, the lab tech; the
 wheelchair-bound Dr. Ensfield, previously familiar to you only at a
 distance, with his assistant Rayjay Farley; and Dr. Ephart.   Their
 attention is focused on Dr. Shaunessy, who is reporting from a
 clipboard that he taps occasionally with a pen.  Dr. Ensfield nods
 rhythmically as his colleague speaks.

 "... will definitely survive, and will probably wake up soon, having
 stabilized naturally from the spike.  There isn't anything we could
 do, but it seems as though the problem cleared up on its own."

 Unnoticed, you open your mouth and work your jaw for a moment.  It
 feels like a long time since you spoke to anyone.  Dr. Ensfield says,
 "But at this time, we can't verify any activity whatsoever from the N.
 splendens culture."

 "That's because it's dead," you say.

 Press any key to continue.








 The group turns to you as one, surprise in every eye.  "Look who's
 awake!" Dr. Ephart says fondly, breaking into a wide grin.  Her
 expression sobers, then, as she comes to you. "You gave us quite a
 fright, passing out for days like that.  But Dr. Ensfield informs us
 that you took care of the problem all on your own, so good going
 there."

 "We'll let Ms. deVries know that the patient is awake," Dr. Ensfield
 says.

 "And discourage her from visiting," Rayjay adds.

 Dr. Shaughnessy looks at you with calculating eyes. "I'm gonna assume
 you've had some weird dreams," he says to you carefully, tapping the
 pen in his hand against his lab coat.  "Your REM was pretty crazy -
 for days.  So were your EEG readings.  I'm gonna assume you've had
 some weird dreams -"

 Because we all had some weird dreams.  But he doesn't say it.

 You nod, and he nods.  He says, "I'm not sure what happened with you
 or how much you know, but I've been consulting with Dr. Ensfield, and
 we should talk."

 "But not now," Dr. Ephart says. "What we need now is a moment of
 calm."

 Dr. Shaughnessy nods and walks out of the room, following Rayjay and
 Dr. Ensfield.

 Press any key to continue.








 But not everyone leaves.  Best folds her arms and leans her slender
 frame against the door.  Dr. Ephart drags a chair next to your bed and
 lowers herself into it.  She looks at you, her eyes showing concern
 and a certain degree of assessment.

 "I'm sorry, kiddo," she says, patting your arm. "I never really knew
 how deep this rabbit hole goes.  If I had, I might have made some of
 my choices differently."

 You place a hand over hers.

 "You've figured some things out with that killer brain of yours,
 haven't you," she asks.  You wince at the adjective, but nod.  "I
 thought so," she says.  "I had a... funny feeling."  Dream.

 She continues.  "I don't know what you've figured out exactly, but I
 need you to be careful.  The company's sent a representative, and Best
 figured out that she's cased everybody's office.  If we'd been writing
 down some of the things we've figured out in the past few days, we
 could be in real trouble."

 She fixes you with a steady gaze.  You return it, your eyes locked on
 hers.  Something passes between you, and you both nod at once.

 "We've got a lot to talk about," she says. "I'm going to sleep with
 one eye open until we get this all sorted out."

 Marnie pats your hand once more, then stands.  She turns and nods to
 Best, who walks out into the hallway, looks left and right, then moves
 out of sight of the doorway.  Marnie walks over to the television,
 leans down, and presses a button on the VCR, then the TV.  The ending
 of American Beauty comes on.  She walks out of the room, giving a
 small wave to you as she goes.

 Press any key to continue.








 You lean back and close your eyes, trying to settle your jangling
 nerves and come to terms with... everything.  As you think things
 over, the movie comes to a close.  Lester Burnham speaks from the
 screen.  His voice flows over you like water over stone as he delivers
 his final speech. As he reflects on the last moments of his "stupid
 little life," you think on the most recent events in yours.

 You smile quietly.  You're seeing things differently too, now, and so
 is Marnie Ephart. Your lives, no matter how stupid or little, are
 going to take a different direction.

 You'll start on that path when you wake up.

 hear Dr. Ensfield's cry for someone to use the paddles, Best coming
 forward with the paddles in her hands.

 The paddles flare across your chest.  Electricity.  Your heart tries
 to start - and fails.  Your synapses spark and jitter.

 Your mind does not fade.  But as electricity snaps through you, your
 awareness is torn backward across the planes of reality, a psychic
 rope ripped painfully down through twenty years of history.

 You see Best retreating with the paddles in her hands, hear Dr.

 You lie unconscious for three days and then rise sharply into
 wakefulness.  You press buttons on a wireless keypad; Dr. Ephart holds
 up the matching cards in response.  You leave the test chamber
 backward; you watch red rose petals dance upward on the television
 screen.

 You watch yourself retreat from the blue-walled rooms of Corona.  Now
 you've never been there.  The teams mills about briefly in your
 absence, consulting and debating, before it dissolves to the wind.

 plumbers, the electricians, the stonemasons - they destroy.  They pull
 paint from the walls and wires from the ceilings and coat everything

 For years, the scorched and ruined carcass stands.  Your mind whispers
 with melancholy voices, but they're all backward, shattered,
 bewildering.  You understand none of it.

 And then men come again - dressed differently, this time, men in suits
 and sunglasses and briefcases.  They bring corpse after corpse into
 the building, each more mutilated than the last, and they leave the
 corpses.  Walking backward, they retreat into sunlight.

 On the third floor of the building, shattered silver reforms into a
 pane of one-way glass.  Seconds later, the mirror regurgitates a young
 man's corpse, and the corpse comes to life.  Nightmare swirls through
 the building - acid, jaws, darkness and madness, something too
 inconstant and awful for your mind to embrace - and where the
 nightmare goes, dead men and women leap up alive and flee backward
 through their mortal days.

 And there - with the building half-gutted, corpses springing to life
 around you - there is where you die again, hot cheek against the floor
 with the Vanemine raging through your bloodstream.

 consciousness stretches backward and forward across twenty years.

 One Eye Open
 An Interactive Nightmare by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine
 Release 1 / Serial number 100929 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)


 After only ten days, you're becoming surprisingly comfortable with
 life as a Corona Corporation guinea pig.  It helps that your routine
 is so reliable - meals, exercise, rest, and sleep are clearly arranged
 on a schedule hanging beside the white clock in your room.  As for the
 tests - well, you've grown used to the sight of your blood in a sample
 vial, and the rest is mostly paperwork.  Personality tests, aptitude
 tests, intelligence tests, psychological tests, Rorschach and the MMPI
 and even kinetic family drawing... you're starting to worry that
 they'll run out of tests by the end of the month.

 Although 7:30 PM is always the day's last test, you never leave your
 room alone, so you were still watching American Beauty when Dr. Marnie
 Ephart knocked at the door.  "Oh, you're almost to the end!" she said
 brightly, seeing the screen.  "I can wait until you're through."

 "No, that's fine."  You hit PAUSE to freeze Angela in mid-motion as
 you got up from the couch.  "I've seen it before."  Last Monday,
 actually.  The video collection isn't that good, and, considering what
 they're paying you, it's a pity Corona couldn't invest in a few more
 options.  It's hard to complain, though; the staff is friendly, the
 tests aren't hard, and the salary is great.

 During the day, Raymond, Best, or one of the scientists might be
 around, but at night, it's usually just the two of you, and the hall
 you cross now is deserted.  You accompany her through the antechamber
 and into the main testing chamber.  By now, you're used to being
 watched from behind one-way glass, but the observational room is fully
 lit today, and you can easily see inside.

 "Back in a moment," Dr. Ephart says cheerfully.  "See you on the other
 side!"


 Test Chamber, Corona Labs
 In the center of the room, a single black office chair sits in front
 of a broad, heavy desk.  The desk and chair are familiar, but the
 wireless keypad sitting on the desk is new.  There are five large
 white buttons on the keypad, each displaying a different symbol in
 broad black strokes.  The symbols are a circle, a cross, a set of
 three wavy lines, a square, and a five-pointed star.  As always, you
 are quite aware of the cameras watching you from above.

 To the west, a windowless door separates the testing room from the
 antechamber outside.

 The familiar black office chair sits invitingly nearby.

 Through the thick pane of glass, you can see the curved desk in the
 observational room.

>y

 Through the thick pane of glass, you see Dr. Ephart come into the
 observational room carrying a stack of cards and a notebook.  She
 waves to you in friendly fashion, sets her notebook on the desk, and
 sits down before pressing the intercom button.

 "This is a different kind of test," Dr. Ephart explains.  "I have
 twenty-five cards here, each of which shows one of the symbols on your
 keypad."  She holds up five cards and fans them so you can see the
 circle, cross, wavy lines, square, and five-pointed star.  "I'm going
 to draw one of these cards and concentrate on the shape.  I want you
 to concentrate, to really focus your mind, and try to pick the same
 symbol that I do.  After you've decided on your symbol, press it on
 the keypad.  We'll do five of these."

 Dr. Ephart shuffles her cards together and draws the first card.  She
 holds the card up with its back to you.

 needle, but nothing obvious happens.  The mirror bites down again, and
 his screams renew.

 The mirror continues to chew at Ian, drawing him into its surface with
 razor-sharp shard-teeth.

>open bottle
 solution?

>pill
>go north
 leave the pills in their container until you decide to take them.

 Ian's anguished screams gargle into weak bubbles as the mirror bites
 into his chest, and, surely, his lungs.

>restore

>inject me
 briefly consider what a bad idea this is.  Before you have time to
 talk yourself out of it, you push the needle into your vein and press
 down the plunger.  The solution burns like fire ants racing into your
 body.

 Immediately, you feel light-headed, and you think your heart might be
 beating faster although only a few seconds have passed.

>open pill bottle
>y
 You twist off the lid of the Sandepam and hesitate over the pills for
 a moment before swallowing two.

 After a moment, you feel a numb, calm sensation come over you.  Your
 senses are slightly dulled, but the terror of your situation seems a
 little bit less sharp.  If only you'd found these a little earlier in
 the nightmare.

 Your heartbeat becomes labored and fast, and you can feel its sharp,
 heavy thud shaking your chest. Your breathing increases in speed as
 your vision fades toward white.  You fall to your knees, losing
 strength in your limbs and feeling in your extremities.

>wait

 After what seems like an eternity of agonized arrhythmia, the
 Sandepam's effect begins to counter that of the cure.  Your heartbeat
 becomes more subtle, regular, slow.  Your breathing, too, begins to
 return to normal. While your eyes still feel wired open, the white
 fuzz around the edge of your vision begins to recede.

 You feel decidedly unwell - nauseated and manic at the same time.  But
 you don't think you're going to die.  Not for this reason, at least.

>go east
 that was preventing sound from leaving the test chamber.  The sound of
 screaming suddenly goes from a muted, ignorable presence to a
 hammering agony on your ears.

 The screaming from inside the test chamber hammers down, not only on
 your ears, but on your mind.  The world warps strangely around you,
 and, quite abruptly, you are somewhere else.

 The door slams shut behind you with tremendous force.

 Test Chamber, Mt Airy Hospital
 While you are not entirely sure what you expected to find, you are
 halted in your tracks nonetheless.  The floor of the test chamber is
 littered with glittering shards of reflective glass.  The one-way
 mirror between the test chamber and the observation room is opaque,
 but it pushes outward in the center to form a pair of jagged,
 irregular halves like a pair of jaws.  From the hips up, Ian
 McMoneagle is trapped in the grip of those jaws, his face twisted into
 a mask of pain.  The mirror's halves grind against muscle and bone,
 tearing him apart as they draw him in.  And yet he lives....

 Ian McMoneagle looks you in the face with wide, terrified eyes, his
 bloody bangs obscuring his gaze but not reducing its weight.  He opens
 his mouth and screams in guilty agony.

 The mirror pulls Ian in more deeply.  The hideous cracking sound that
 follows is almost surely his pelvis.

>drop bones
 hand, then toss them onto the ground in front of Ian.  At once, his
 screams stop, and he stares at the bones.

 Following his gaze, you see that the fingerbones are gone.  What lies
 on the ground is a set of twelve six-sided game dice, each one showing
 a single pip facing upward.  Six sets of snake eyes stare up at you
 and Ian.  You stare back.

 The room vibrates for a few seconds, and then reality shatters.  You
 both shatter with it.

 Press any key to continue.








 A darkened office. The orange light of dusk spilling through venetian
 blinds, laying bright stripes on the dark wood of an expensive luxury
 desk.

 With a satisfying clatter, six dice bounce across the surface of the
 desk, coming to rest with assorted results: 6 6 2 6 3 1.  The man who
 threw them, a middle-aged man with a face craggier than his age should
 allow, wears Brylcreemed black hair, a power suit, and the receiver of
 an office telephone held firmly to the side of his head.

 "No, John, let me tell YOU something," he says. "The Schuyler family
 didn't get to be where it is because we refused to take risks.  This
 stuff is the real deal, and whoever pulls it off first is going to be
 set for generations."

 He grabs three of the dice, leaving the three that show sixes.  With
 an offhand gesture, he tosses them again.  One of the three comes up a
 six.  "Look, this Buchanan broad is too hippy dippy for the Institute,
 but she's the real deal and she'll do anything for a break.  They want
 to look legit, fine, but they won't land the project.  We will."

 He picks up one of the unlucky dice, then the other.  He pauses for a
 moment, listening to the phone, then laughs.  "Well, John, I imagine
 she'll go nuts after a little while, but if you're not willing to
 squeeze an orange hard enough, you'll never get a glass of juice.
 Well, all right John.  Talk to you later."

 The man hangs up the phone, then throws the final two dice one last
 time.  Both come up sixes.  He leans back in his chair and smiles.

 "Heh-heh," he says. "Yahtzee."

 Then, he puts five dice back in the game box and one die in his
 pocket, and he saunters off to dinner.
