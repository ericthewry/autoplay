 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 I do not have a name, but I think that someday soon I will. I have
 heard Him talk many times of other things that have names, things like
 Mom, Dad, Emily, Stuart, God. So I think I will have a name someday
 soon, although I do not know how I get a name. Is it something I have
 to do? Is there somewhere I have to go? All I know is that for now, He
 calls me just one thing: Cat.

 Soft Place
 You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
 ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
 when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
 soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
 space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
 milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
 of that again.

 He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
 know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
 There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
 name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
 away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
 must be related, because you both are called Cat.

 You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
 lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
 be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
 Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

 [If this is your first time playing, type "ABOUT".]



>examine me
 You look at yourself and see your black fur from head to toe. You feel
 that your tail is a little long for you, but you haven't seen many
 other cats. Maybe that is normal. You are small, but you know you will
 get bigger someday, and someday you will have a name.
>about

 the household. Explore your world by using relative directions
 (forward, back, left, and right). Use jump to to jump to things higher
 or lower than you are. Make sure that the game window is wide enough
 to display Score and Turns on the right side. For more information
 about the game, and how to play interactive fiction games in general,
 type HELP. For hints, type HINTS. Enjoy!

 Your Place
 Your Place surrounds the soft place. It's much bigger and it is soft
 on your feet, but not as soft as the soft place. You can run around
 here but the three ows stop you. Nothing has changed from this morning
 when He left -- the food dish, the water bowl, the sandbox, and the
 ledge are in their same places and they smell the same. The most
 interesting thing, though, is the mow. It's wide open in front of you
 and smells from outside are rushing in.

>f

 New Hall
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out to your right and to your left taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- images sweep over you of Him, others
 like Him, a world filled with flying things and grass, clean scents
 and many others that you've never smelled before. Faintly, you also
 detect a sweet yet salty wild smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>score
 You have so far scored 0 out of a possible 20, in 4 turns.

 You can go to your right and to your left down the hall, and behind
 you back to your place.

>r

 Midway Hall
 You are halfway down the hall, up to a good speed when you see
 something that compels you to stop and look. Here two mows face each
 other -- one that is not completely solid and one that doesn't reach
 the floor. The non-solid mow has slats from the top to the bottom,
 like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful fresh
 smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only there
 were something soft enough to sleep on.  Mmrrow. You can't help
 yourself and rub lazily against it. It feels good. The solid mow on
 the opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>push moo
 You don't see any such thing here.

>push mow
 What do you want to push: the solid mow or the slatted mow?

>slatted
 It's much too large and heavy for you to move it.

>examine slatted
 It is a mow, but you're not sure how He moves it, because there is no
 blob of metal halfway up. It's not solid, like other mows are, and you
 can see fluffy colored things beyond; an almost-dizzying sleepy fresh
 smell comes from beyond it.

>smell slatted
 The sleepy fresh smell comes from beyond the mow. It's so good that it
 almost makes you dizzy.

>r
 You can go behind you back to New Hall and in front of you to the end
 of the hall.

>f
 You are up to a good speed before you notice the ow coming at you. You
 come to a butt-burning halt. Youch!

 End Hall
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one
 to your right has sun filtering in through slats that make you want to
 rest in its warm spaces and play with the shadows. The room to your
 left is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.
 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

>r

 Sun Room
 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the
 window on the far side of the room. Shadows and light play across the
 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

>examine short
 This is shortest box. It is held closed by a brown stripe, and you can
 easily jump up to it from the floor.

>jump on short
 You leap up to the box and then look around, surveying your new
 surroundings.

>examine me
 You look at yourself and see your black fur from head to toe. You feel
 that your tail is a little long for you, but you haven't seen many
 other cats. Maybe that is normal. You are small, but you know you will

 You're not sure how. The box is held together with a stripe that keeps
 it shut everywhere.

 What do you want to pull: brown stripe or green stripe?

>jump on short
 You move your head up and down a few times, judging the distance, and
 then decide to go for it. You feel a few moments of glorious
 weightlessness and then you settle on the box with a gentle "thump".

 Bathroom
 This room is darker than the others, and a whole plethora of scents
 rush out to find you. You take a moment perched on the threshold to
 decipher what they all mean. The first smell smells like He does
 sometimes -- like growing things, like the outside. It's too strong
 for you and it causes your nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next
 strongest smell is a fresh, clean smell that must be some kind of
 water. You know by the third smell that this is His place, because He
 has marked it. Mixed in with that territorial odor are lesser notes
 that smell like all sorts of yummy things. You're so glad he marked
 the area so you'd know where they are! It's odd, though. You look
 around but don't see a litterbox anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see what looks like a very long water
 bowl. It has sides so you can jump up on it and take look inside. It
 smells like that water smell. Opposite it is a fat water bowl, where
 the territorial smell and the yummy smells come from. You could jump
 up on it, too. Right beside you are wooden boxes, and on top of them
 is a tall dark window.

  Wait! There's something in the window. Your hackles rise and your fur
 poofs out. It's another cat, the same size as you!

>jump on long bowl
 You don't see any such thing here.

>hiss
 You let out a bloodcurdling meow of warning, but she doesn't respond.
 Her mouth moves, but no sound comes out.

>touch cat
 You're too far away to do much of anything.

>f
 You can go behind you or out to leave the room.

>jump
 You jump a foot into the air just for fun.

>look
 Bathroom
 The hallway light provides the only light in this dark room. Your eyes
 adjust and your nose comes alive with the many different scents
 inside. The first smell smells like He does sometimes -- like growing
 things, like the outside. It's too strong for you and it causes your
 nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next strongest smell is a fresh,

  The other cat mimics your motions, her eyes fixed on you. You'll have
 to respond to her challenge somehow.

>jump on toilet
 (the toilet)
 With feline agility, you leap up to the deep water bowl.

 Toilet Rim
 You are halfway between the dark window and the floor, perched on the
 fat water bowl. It's not soft, but it is fairly slick. The wonderful
 smells rise up from the hollow center, down in the water. You see
 above you a wide ledge that runs underneath the window. You could
 easily jump to it, or jump down to the bathroom floor.

 The house settles and creaks, giving you a start.

>jump on ledge
 With amazing grace, you land on the space above the handles with a
 solid "whump".

 Bathroom Counter
 You barely notice the rest of the surface except for the sink, which
 smells like his breath and some sort of plant. The dark window takes
 up the entire wall and inside there is another cat! Her fur is poofed
 out just like yours and her green eyes stare back at you in challenge.

>hit cat
 You can't quite reach her. She seems to be on the other side of the
 window. She can't quite reach you, either.

 The house settles and creaks, giving you a start.

 You hear a faint ring coming from somewhere from somewhere far away.

>meow
 You warn her off, but she doesn't reply. She must be unable to speak.

 You hear a faint ring coming from elsewhere.

>open window
 You try, but nothing interesting happens.

 You hear a faint ring coming from elsewhere.

>wave at cat
 You don't see any such thing here.

>wave
 You don't know how to do that.

 You hear a faint ring coming from elsewhere.

>smell cat
 You lean your nose in to smell her and she does the exact same thing.
 Then you realize what seemed so strange about all of this: you never
 once smelled her. How can she have no scent and no voice? What sort of
 cat is that? You realize, too, that she only does what you do. If you
 stop, she stops; if you groom yourself, she grooms herself; if you
 blink, she blinks. She does whatever you do because she is you,
 somehow. Only not you and only in the dark window. It's weird, but
 you're glad you're not a human and have to deal with such
 complexities.

 You hear a faint ring coming from elsewhere.

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

>go down
 You can jump down, back to the bathroom, or you can jump to the fat
 water bowl.

>jump down
 You raise and lower your head a few times, estimating the distance. On
 a whim, you decide to go for it and you jump down. It takes you a
 moment to get your breath back.

  You see your reflection peeking down at you from the window, green
 eyes glowing in the dark.

>jump on tub
 You're a bit hesitant to jump where you can't see, so you jump up on
 the surrounding ledge instead.

 Tub Edge
 You are perched uncomfortably on the narrow ledge around the  tub. The
 surface beneath you is hard and damp, and that clean water smell comes
 from all around you. You can either enter the tub, or jump down back
 into the bathroom.

>get down
 You can jump down to the bathroom floor, or you can enter the tub.

>enter tub
 Inside Tub
 You walk around inside the tub and notice, strangely, that this place
 smells like His paws. Does He stand up in it? It looks long enough for
 him to lie down in it. The water smell saturates the area, and you
 know that this place must usually be wet. Right now it is only damp.
 He calls this place "tub".

>enter tub
 You're already in it!

 You scramble back up on the narrow side.

>examine boxes
 They are wooden things taller than you are and they puff out a little.
 Where they puff out, you smell His hands, and past that, harsh,
 artificial smells that you don't like. "Why would he need such
 bad-smelling things," you wonder.

 You're not thirsty, but you can't pass this opportunity up -- the
 smells are too interesting. Carefully you lower yourself into the
 toilet and take ten deep laps of the water. Then you pull yourself
 back up on the rim and luxuriate in the taste of tea, yogurt, and
 submarine sandwiches. You're thankful again that He was so kind to
 mark the area so that you'd know to find it.

 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the

 New Hall
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out behind you and in front of you taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to
 investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild
 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

 You can go behind you and in front of you down the hall, and to your
 left back to your place.

>b

 Midway Hall
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the
 bottom, like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful
 fresh smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only
 there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the
 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>full score
 You don't know how to do that. [For a list of common verbs, type HELP,
 or try using a different verb.]

 End Hall
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one
 to your right has sun filtering in through slats that make you want to
 rest in its warm spaces and play with the shadows. The room to your
 left is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.
 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

>r

 Sun Room
 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the
 window on the far side of the room. Shadows and light play across the
 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

>b

 End Hall
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one

 water. The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and

>f

 Bathroom
 The hallway light provides the only light in this dark room. Your eyes
 adjust and your nose comes alive with the many different scents
 inside. The first smell smells like He does sometimes -- like growing
 things, like the outside. It's too strong for you and it causes your
 nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next strongest smell is a fresh,
 clean smell that must be some kind of water. You know by the third
 smell that this is His place, because He has marked it. Mixed in with
 that territorial odor are lesser notes that smell like all sorts of
 yummy things. You're so glad he marked the area so you'd know where
 they are! It's odd, though. You look around but don't see a litterbox
 anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see the tub. It has sides so you can
 jump up on it and take look inside. It smells like that water smell.
 Opposite it is a fat water bowl, where the territorial smell and the
 yummy smells come from. You could jump up on it, too. Right beside you
 are wooden boxes, and on top of them is a tall dark window.

  You see your reflection peeking down at you from the window, green
 eyes glowing in the dark.

 You feel more relaxed.

 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out behind you and in front of you taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest

 Gated Hall
 The hall from behind you ends here at a soft ow about half as tall as
 an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can see
 through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than Him,
 on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat has
 left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress in front of you.

>examine gate
 It is a tall stringy ow. Through it, you can see the shiny place
 beyond. It is marked with a welcome message from Goodcat/Badcat whom
 suggests that getting past it is difficult.

>climb gate
 You bound to the gate, spring upwards, and latch your claws into the
 material. Then, putting one paw in front of another, you climb up to
 the top of the gate and leap gracefully down. You turn and look behind
 you, your tail crooked, feeling proud of yourself.

 Edge of Kitchen
 Just to your right, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads in front of you, but behind you
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress behind you.

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

>examine plant
 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine bowl

>examine carpet
 It is a light brownish color. You smell around and take several
 minutes to soak up the knowledge of who ate what, where they were
 going, and how they were feeling. The knowledge makes you feel quite
 important, as if you had discovered the key to understanding what
 happens around here.

 The house settles and creaks, giving you a start.

>go up
 You can go to your right, to your left, in front of you, or climb the
 gate to go behind you.

 Kitchen
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors. Goodcat/Badcat is in this room; his scent is strong. You
 whip your head around but don't see him anywhere. Is he waiting to
 pounce you? You continue looking around carefully.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor is a
 large brown circle held up by four legs. Underneath it are two smaller
 versions, with one pulled away from the other. You wind your way
 around these things and quickly smell what their names are. The large
 thing is called a table. The smaller things are called chairs (one is
 His and the other is guest). The names seem strong, but dull. You hope
 He doesn't name you any of those names.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

>eat plant
 You don't see any such thing here.

>jump on table
 That's too far away. You ponder jumping to something closer instead.

 You agilely leap upwards into the chair.

 You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
 surface.

 Brown Table
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now. You also realize
 the names of the two objects on the table, and your interest is
 piqued.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

>examine phone
 A curvy thing on a square thing that He uses for talking to people
 when they are not here. You're not sure how that works, but you know
 by sniffing it that that's what He does. Goodcat/Badcat says that it
 can be annoyingly loud.
>examine remote
 A black bar about half as long as you are, filled with a lot of
 buttons. It's obviously made for hands like His as the buttons are too
 small for you to push individually.

>push remote
 Nothing obvious happens.

>push buttons
 You don't see any such thing here.

>take remote
 You take it into your mouth, but you're barely able to keep a good
 grip on it. You're not sure you could do anything besides walking.

>drop remote
 Dropped.

>take phone
 That's too heavy or big to carry in your mouth and you need all four
 paws to walk with.

>push phone
 Nothing obvious happens.

>push phone off table
 You don't see any such thing here.

>chew phone
 You don't know how to do that. [For a list of common verbs, type HELP,

>examine fridge
 Brr! It's cold, but it smells like all kinds of yummy things. He calls
 this "fridge". Goodcat/Badcat agrees with your assessment, so you
 naturally rub against it to add your opinion officially to his.

 The phone right next to you suddenly starts Ringing VeRy LOUDLY. You
 almost involuntarily leap off the table in surprise.

>touch phone
 You brush your whiskers by it, but nothing amazing happens.

 The phone rings right beside you. It's loud!

>hit phone
 You attack the phone, trying to Make The Ringing Stop. You smack the
 curvy part with your paw and send it flying. The ringing stops! But
 then you hear a concerned female voice talking out of it. It's saying
 some kind of greeting.

 A concerned female voice speaks from the phone right beside you.

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

>meow
 You say "Meowr?" to let the voice know that you are here and want to
 know what's going on. The voice asks you a question that you don't
 understand, laughs, and then says some other things, and finally it
 says "goodbye". You know then it will go away and it does.

 An artificial voice from the phone repeats itself with strange quiet
 parts between.

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

 His chair is nearby.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

 A horrible grating sound comes from the phone on the table!

>open fridge
 You claw at what seems to be the weakest point of the cold box, but
 you can't get it open.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

 Countertop
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place.  It makes you feel
 powerful and important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and
 had a few cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer
 and not so narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump
 up to the metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of
 Goodcat/Badcat. He is near.

 What do you want to examine: Ftop or the fridge?

 You see nothing special about Ftop.

 Refrigerator Top
 On top of this cold metal cube, you find what you've been expecting
 the whole time: Goodcat/Badcat. He is a refined grey cat with black
 stripes who sits with his body perpendicular to yours, his head facing
 you. He has two large yellow eyes and seems unaffected by your
 arrival, as though he had been expecting you.

 You can see Goodcat/Badcat here.

>examine goodcat
 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine cat
 You look at him and you feel his eyes staring a hole through yours. He
 seems angry; you feel decidedly nervous.

>purr
 You only do that when you are talking to Him. That's the fun part.
 When He gets back, you let out all the purrs you have saved up the
 whole day.

>smell cat
 You approach him but at the last moment, back off. His fierce stare
 seems to shout, "How dare you approach when we have not properly
 greeted one another yet!"

>meow
 You're not sure how you talk with another cat, after all, your only
 memories are hazy and indistinct ones of your littermates and mom. So
 you try talking to Goodcat/Badcat like you were talking to Him. You
 let out a curious "Meowr". His eyes fix upon you.

 Refrigerator Top
 You are on top of the cold metal cube, better known as "refrigerator"
 and "Goodcat/Badcat's lair". Strangely, it is not cold here, but
 fairly cozy with the faint smell of food. You can see why he chose

 Looking back on it, you realize that this was one of those things that
 would have never worked out. You pounced him and he responded with a
 bloodcurdling hiss and a swift paw that sent you flying right off the
 vibrating metal box. You landed on the ledge below and backed away
 just in time to avoid him jumping on you. Fear and adrenaline ran
 through your veins and you jumped, jumped, and ran like your tail was
 on fire. Now you're on the other side of that stringy ow, catching
 your breath, the image of him turning away with a refined departing
 spit echoing in your ears. His departing words were, "And don't come
 back!"

 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

 Midway Hall
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the
 bottom, like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful
 fresh smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only
 there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the
 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He

 Sun Room
 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the
 window on the far side of the room. Shadows and light play across the
 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

>jump on short
 You leap up to the box and then look around, surveying your new
 surroundings.

>nap
 You lie down and curl yourself into a little ball. You squinch your
 eyelids shut and feel your limbs go slack. As the haze of sleep comes
 over you, before you know it, you are somewhere else entirely.

 Palace (in a catnap) (on the golden oval)
 Here, the sun shines in from above to form a golden oval in the center
 of a stone dais. Around you are furry and soft places, but none as
 soft as the golden oval, which is why you're relaxing upon it. On one
 side is a milkfall where milk falls down over squares and all you have
 to do is turn your head to one side to drink. On the other side is a
 waterfall of clear and cool water. As you wait, smaller cats wearing
 bells and silly red-and-green clothes over their fur nose delicate
 trays up to you to eat, should you care to. It is early morning in
 this wonderful palace, where you are the Queen.

 On the delicate trays are choice meats.

>drink milk
 You incline your head ever-so-slightly and take a refreshing drink,
 making sure to lick your mouth daintily afterwards.

>eat meat
 As you're not particularly hungry, you nibble several different
 offerings distractedly, enjoying the various tastes and textures.

 With a sudden "bang" the dream world disappears and your eyes flit
 open. You hear His voice, talking to Goodcat/Badcat. You stretch and
 lazily mewl to let him know you are here.

 He discovers you and then picks you up. He is surprised, and then
 kind. He pets you over and over again, chuckling at some of the things
 you have done. "I suppose I will have to name you now," he says. He
 holds you high in the air and then triumphantly christens you, "Merry.
 Yes, that's the perfect name for you." You nuzzle your face into his
 arms, turning the name around and around in your mind. Merry. It's a
 good name, well, as good as humans get at these things, you think. You
 beam up at Him as He carries you.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 I do not have a name, but I think that someday soon I will. I have
 heard Him talk many times of other things that have names, things like
 Mom, Dad, Emily, Stuart, God. So I think I will have a name someday
 soon, although I do not know how I get a name. Is it something I have
 to do? Is there somewhere I have to go? All I know is that for now, He
 calls me just one thing: Cat.

 A slice-of-life adventure from a feline perspective,  by Poster

 Soft Place
 You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
 ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
 when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
 soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
 space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
 milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
 of that again.

 He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
 know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
 There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
 name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
 away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
 must be related, because you both are called Cat.

 You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
 lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
 be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
 Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

 [If this is your first time playing, type "ABOUT".]

 Your Place
 Your Place surrounds the soft place. It's much bigger and it is soft
 on your feet, but not as soft as the soft place. You can run around
 here but the three ows stop you. Nothing has changed from this morning
 when He left -- the food dish, the water bowl, the sandbox, and the
 ledge are in their same places and they smell the same. The most
 interesting thing, though, is the mow. It's wide open in front of you
 and smells from outside are rushing in.

>examine food
 It looks like a lot of little claws, but it is softer and tastes
 salty. You're not hungry, though, because you've already eaten.

>examine sandbox
 It's a tough box filled with sand that's just right for taking care of
 wastes.

 New Hall
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out to your right and to your left taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- images sweep over you of Him, others
 like Him, a world filled with flying things and grass, clean scents
 and many others that you've never smelled before. Faintly, you also
 detect a sweet yet salty wild smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>r

 Midway Hall
 You are halfway down the hall, up to a good speed when you see
 something that compels you to stop and look. Here two mows face each
 other -- one that is not completely solid and one that doesn't reach
 the floor. The non-solid mow has slats from the top to the bottom,
 like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful fresh
 smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only there
 were something soft enough to sleep on.  Mmrrow. You can't help
 yourself and rub lazily against it. It feels good. The solid mow on
 the opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>examine solid
 It's a large mow (like they all are) with a metal handle about
 half-way up. It doesn't reach the floor, and  underneath it is a white
 thing. Beyond it is his lair.

>examine white thing
 You can't get your nose close enough to really tell much about it,
 except that it's a covering for His paws and it smells like it.

>examine sock
 You can't get your nose close enough to really tell much about it,
 except that it's a covering for His paws and it smells like it.

>examine metal handle
 You don't see any such thing here.

>pull sock
 You reach out for it and snag it in your claws; surprised, you pull
 back and pull it out into the room. You smell it more carefully and
 know that He put this on his paw two suns ago, had circular meat-bread
 for dinner, and generally felt happy. You remember that day. The
 covering itself is soft and yet stretchy. He calls this "sock". You
 look at it curiously, trying to understand why He needs a covering for
 his paws.

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

>look under door
 You see something that must be an enormous bed, coverings for his

 move around.

 Only He can do that. You're too small, at least right now. Who knows
 how big you'll get?

>push door
 It's much too large and heavy for you to move it.

>scratch door
 You claw it to no effect.

>meow
 You mew. Nothing happens and you feel faintly disappointed.

>smell under door

>hiss
 You remember your mother telling you to use that tone of voice only
 when you really had to. Fortunately, this is not one of those times.

>examine keyhole
 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine slats
 It is a mow, but you're not sure how He moves it, because there is no
 blob of metal halfway up. It's not solid, like other mows are, and you
 can see fluffy colored things beyond; an almost-dizzying sleepy fresh
 smell comes from beyond it.

>move slats
 It's much too large and heavy for you to move it.

>paw slats
 You try for a few moments, but don't make any appreciable impact.

>squeeze throuh slats
 You don't see any such thing here.

>rub sock
 You idly rub against it and let the world know that you were here.

>climb slats
 You claw frantically at the mow but don't manage to get very far up.

 The house settles and creaks, giving you a start.

>f
 You are up to a good speed before you notice the ow coming at you. You
 come to a butt-burning halt. Youch!

 End Hall
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one
 to your right has sun filtering in through slats that make you want to
 rest in its warm spaces and play with the shadows. The room to your
 left is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.
 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

>b
 You turn to face behind you and bound away.

 Midway Hall
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the

 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from

 Gated Hall
 The hall from behind you ends here at a soft ow about half as tall as
 an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can see
 through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than Him,
 on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat has
 left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress in front of you.

>climb gate
 You bound to the gate, spring upwards, and latch your claws into the
 material. Then, putting one paw in front of another, you climb up to
 the top of the gate and leap gracefully down. You turn and look behind
 you, your tail crooked, feeling proud of yourself.

 Edge of Kitchen
 Just to your right, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads in front of you, but behind you
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 Kitchen
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors. Goodcat/Badcat is in this room; his scent is strong. You
 whip your head around but don't see him anywhere. Is he waiting to
 pounce you? You continue looking around carefully.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor is a
 large brown circle held up by four legs. Underneath it are two smaller
 versions, with one pulled away from the other. You wind your way
 around these things and quickly smell what their names are. The large
 thing is called a table. The smaller things are called chairs (one is
 His and the other is guest). The names seem strong, but dull. You hope
 He doesn't name you any of those names.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

>jump up
 You must name something more substantial.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

>jump on table
 That's too far away. You ponder jumping to something closer instead.

>jump on chair
 What do you want to jump on: the guest chair or His chair?

>guest
 You don't think you'll make it, but you go for it anyways. YOW! You
 bop your head on the underside of the table and spend a few moments
 wincing away the pain.

>jump on table
 You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
 surface.

 Brown Table
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now. You also realize
 the names of the two objects on the table, and your interest is
 piqued.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

>jump on counter
 That doesn't look far away. You take a quick look and with a little
 jump you land safely on the countertop.

 Countertop
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place.  It makes you feel
 powerful and important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and
 had a few cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer
 and not so narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump
 up to the metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of
 Goodcat/Badcat. He is near.

>jump on top
>jump on ftop
 You leap up to the top with the greatest of ease.

 Refrigerator Top
 On top of this cold metal cube, you find what you've been expecting
 the whole time: Goodcat/Badcat. He is a refined grey cat with black
 stripes who sits with his body perpendicular to yours, his head facing
 you. He has two large yellow eyes and seems unaffected by your
 arrival, as though he had been expecting you.

 You can see Goodcat/Badcat here.

>give sock to cat
 Goodcat/Badcat sniffs the air and then sniffs the sock, taking his
 time to inhale all of its scents. He looks thoughtful for a moment and
 then rubs you, pressing into your fur one of his secrets. Fascinated,
 you ponder all the fun you'll have when you chew off a piece of
 meat-bread and leave it behind the vibrating box for twenty suns so
 that you too can have a smelly play toy!

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

>smell cat
 You approach him but at the last moment, back off. His fierce stare
 seems to shout, "How dare you approach when we have not properly
 greeted one another yet!"

>rub cat
 You approach him but at the last moment, back off. His fierce stare
 seems to shout, "How dare you approach when we have not properly
 greeted one another yet!"

>talk to cat
 You're not sure how you talk with another cat, after all, your only
 memories are hazy and indistinct ones of your littermates and mom. So
 you try talking to Goodcat/Badcat like you were talking to Him. You
 let out a curious "Meowr". His eyes fix upon you.

 Suddenly a loud ringing sound comes from the table and it startles you
 a foot into the air.

>cat, hi
 There is no reply.

 The phone on the table nearby rings, and it's loud!

>say hello to cat
 There is no reply.

 A curvy thing on a square thing that He uses for talking to people
 when they are not here. You're not sure how that works, but you know

 can be annoyingly loud.

 Bathroom
 This room is darker than the others, and a whole plethora of scents
 rush out to find you. You take a moment perched on the threshold to
 decipher what they all mean. The first smell smells like He does
 sometimes -- like growing things, like the outside. It's too strong
 for you and it causes your nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next
 strongest smell is a fresh, clean smell that must be some kind of
 water. You know by the third smell that this is His place, because He
 has marked it. Mixed in with that territorial odor are lesser notes
 that smell like all sorts of yummy things. You're so glad he marked
 the area so you'd know where they are! It's odd, though. You look
 around but don't see a litterbox anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see what looks like a very long water
 bowl. It has sides so you can jump up on it and take look inside. It
 smells like that water smell. Opposite it is a giant white chair that
 is hollow in the middle, where the territorial smell and the yummy
 smells come from. You could jump up on it, too. Right beside you are
 wooden boxes, and on top of them is a tall dark window.

  Wait! There's something in the window. Your hackles rise and your fur
 poofs out. It's another cat, the same size as you!

>jump on toilet
 (the toilet)
 With feline agility, you leap up to the deep water bowl.

 Toilet Rim
 You are halfway between the dark window and the floor, perched on the
 white chair. It's not soft, but it is fairly slick. The wonderful
 smells rise up from the hollow center, down in the water. You see
 above you a wide ledge that runs underneath the window. You could
 easily jump to it, or jump down to the bathroom floor.

>drink water
 You're not thirsty, but you can't pass this opportunity up -- the
 smells are too interesting. Carefully you lower yourself into the
 toilet and take ten deep laps of the water. Then you pull yourself
 back up on the rim and luxuriate in the taste of tea, yogurt, and
 submarine sandwiches. You're thankful again that He was so kind to
 mark the area so that you'd know to find it.

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

>jump down
 You jump down to the tiled floor below with matchless ease.

 Bathroom
 The hallway light provides the only light in this dark room. Your eyes
 adjust and your nose comes alive with the many different scents
 inside. The first smell smells like He does sometimes -- like growing
 things, like the outside. It's too strong for you and it causes your
 nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next strongest smell is a fresh,
 clean smell that must be some kind of water. You know by the third
 smell that this is His place, because He has marked it. Mixed in with
 that territorial odor are lesser notes that smell like all sorts of
 yummy things. You're so glad he marked the area so you'd know where
 they are! It's odd, though. You look around but don't see a litterbox
 anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see what looks like a very long water
 bowl. It has sides so you can jump up on it and take look inside. It
 smells like that water smell. Opposite it is a giant white chair that
 is hollow in the middle, where the territorial smell and the yummy
 smells come from. You could jump up on it, too. Right beside you are
 wooden boxes, and on top of them is a tall dark window.

  The other cat mimics your motions, her eyes fixed on you. You'll have
 to respond to her challenge somehow.

>jump on tub
 You're a bit hesitant to jump where you can't see, so you jump up on
 the surrounding ledge instead.

 Tub Edge
 You are perched uncomfortably on the narrow ledge around the  tub. The
 surface beneath you is hard and damp, and that clean water smell comes
 from all around you. You can either enter the tub, or jump down back
 into the bathroom.

>jump down
 You jump down with a faint "oof".

>jump on toilet
 (the toilet)
 With feline agility, you leap up to the deep water bowl.

 Toilet Rim
 You are halfway between the dark window and the floor, perched on the
 white chair. It's not soft, but it is fairly slick. The wonderful
 smells rise up from the hollow center, down in the water. You see
 above you a wide ledge that runs underneath the window. You could
 easily jump to it, or jump down to the bathroom floor.

>jump on ledge
 With amazing grace, you land on the space above the handles with a
 solid "whump".

 Bathroom Counter
 You barely notice the rest of the surface except for the sink, which
 smells like his breath and some sort of plant. The dark window takes
 up the entire wall and inside there is another cat! Her fur is poofed
 out just like yours and her green eyes stare back at you in challenge.

>blink
 You don't know how to do that. [For a list of common verbs, type HELP,
 or try using a different verb.]

>paw cat
 You can't quite reach her. She seems to be on the other side of the
 window. She can't quite reach you, either.

>stare at cat
 You stare at her until you can't stare any more, but when you blink,
 she blinks at exactly the same time!

>groom me
 You feel clean and smell like yourself. You don't see the need to
 groom yourself right now.

>groom cat
>meow
 You let out a bloodcurdling meow of warning, but she doesn't respond.
 Her mouth moves, but no sound comes out.

>hit cat
 You can't quite reach her. She seems to be on the other side of the
 window. She can't quite reach you, either.

>smell cat
 You lean your nose in to smell her and she does the exact same thing.
 Then you realize what seemed so strange about all of this: you never
 once smelled her. How can she have no scent and no voice? What sort of
 cat is that? You realize, too, that she only does what you do. If you
 stop, she stops; if you groom yourself, she grooms herself; if you
 blink, she blinks. She does whatever you do because she is you,
 somehow. Only not you and only in the dark window. It's weird, but
 you're glad you're not a human and have to deal with such
 complexities.

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

>examine sink
 It's a bowl that's part of the ledge. It's damp, empty, and smells of
 his breath and some sort of fresh plant.

>jump down
 You raise and lower your head a few times, estimating the distance. On
 a whim, you decide to go for it and you jump down. It takes you a
 moment to get your breath back.

 is a tall dark window.

  You see your reflection peeking down at you from the window, green
 eyes glowing in the dark.

>back
 You feel more relaxed.

 End Hall
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one
 in front of you has sun filtering in through slats that make you want
 to rest in its warm spaces and play with the shadows. The room behind
 you is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.
 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

>f

 Sun Room
 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the
 window on the far side of the room. Shadows and light play across the
 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

>b

 End Hall

 of you is dark and presents several different smells relating to

>r
 You can go to your left down the hall, in front of you to the dark
 room, or behind you to the sunny room.

>look
 You turn to face to your left and bound away.

 Midway Hall
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the
 bottom, like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful
 fresh smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only
 there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the
 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>f

 New Hall
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out behind you and in front of you taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to
 investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild
 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>f

 Gated Hall
 The hall from behind you ends here at a soft ow about half as tall as
 an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can see
 through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than Him,
 on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat has
 left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress in front of you.

>climb gate
 You clamber over the gate again, quickly, but unfortunately not
 silently.

 Edge of Kitchen
 Just to your right, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads in front of you, but behind you
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress behind you.

>r

 Kitchen
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor the
 brown table towers over you. The guest chair sits underneath it, and
 His chair is nearby.

>jump on his
 You agilely leap upwards into the chair.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

>jump on table
 You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
 surface.

 Brown Table
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

>jump on counter
 That doesn't look far away. You take a quick look and with a little
 jump you land safely on the countertop.

 Countertop
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place. Only the
 refrigerator top gives a better view. It makes you feel powerful and
 important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and had a few
 cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer and not so
 narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump up to the
 metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of Goodcat/Badcat.
 He is near.

>jump on ftop
 You leap up to the top with the greatest of ease.

 Refrigerator Top
 You are on top of the cold metal cube, better known as "refrigerator"
 and "Goodcat/Badcat's lair". Strangely, it is not cold here, but
 fairly cozy with the faint smell of food. You can see why he chose
 this location for a lair. You think you'd probably have done the same.

 You can see Goodcat/Badcat here.

 Goodcat/Badcat seems to be considering your actions carefully.

>stare at cat
 He draws back and gives you a withering look as though you had the
 manners of a canine.

>stare next to cat
 You don't see any such thing here.

>stare at wall
 You don't see any such thing here.

>watch cat
 You look at him and you feel his eyes staring a hole through yours. He
 seems angry; you feel decidedly nervous.

>look behind cat
 You don't see any such thing here.

 Time passes.

 (the kitchen floor)
 It's shiny and smooth, but it gives you just enough to grip on. You
 skid occasionally when you stop suddenly, but you don't glide.

>push cat
 That would be less than courteous.

>kiss cat
 You can't do what He does, because your mouth is not shaped like His.

>lick cat
 He draws back and gives you a withering look as though you had the

 You jump down and land on the countertop with a noticeable "thud".

 You span the distance with a soft jump and skid to a stop on the
 table.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

 The phone right next to you suddenly starts Ringing VeRy LOUDLY. You
 almost involuntarily leap off the table in surprise.

>get remote
 You already have the sock in your mouth!

 The phone rings right beside you. It's loud!

>hit phone
 You attack the phone, trying to Make The Ringing Stop. You smack the
 curvy part with your paw and send it flying. The ringing stops! But
 then you hear a concerned female voice talking out of it. It's saying
 some kind of greeting.

 A concerned female voice speaks from the phone right beside you.

 You feel like you have achieved something particularly kittenish.

>meow
 You say "Meowr?" to let the voice know that you are here and want to
 know what's going on. The voice asks you a question that you don't
 understand, laughs, and then says some other things, and finally it
 says "goodbye". You know then it will go away and it does.

 An artificial voice from the phone repeats itself with strange quiet
 parts between.

>drop sock
 He studiously ignores you.

 A horrible grating sound comes out of the phone on the table!
 Goodcat/Badcat makes a disgusted face and his baleful eyes blame you.

>take sock
 You already have the sock in your mouth!

>give sock to cat
 He studiously ignores you.

 The awful grating sound stops and the phone is silent once again.
 Goodcat/Badcat exhales loudly and fixes you with an expression that
 clearly communicates, "Let's not do that again, shall we?" You feel
 embarrassed but relieved.

>inventory
 You are carrying:

 You take it into your mouth, but you're barely able to keep a good

>jump down
 After a few moments of weightless falling and the rude impact, you are
 once again walking around on the shiny floor.

 Kitchen
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box

 Tiled Door
 The carpet ends here at a mow like the one that leads out of your
 place. You're not sure how He manages to open these things, but He
 must be strong. This mow looks a lot like the shiny floor, actually;
 it looks like it is made up of different tiles, all different colors.
 Sniffing the edges, you realize that it is a gateway to the outside.
 Images of grass, bright sunshine, concern, danger, and burden roll
 over you and you think that the outside is a fearful but wonderful
 place, and amazingly large. You also smell a distinctively female
 scent, like flowers, but far too strong; yet it is similar to Him. It
 is the scent of his littermate, the one he calls "sister" and "Emily".

 Den
 This is a comfortable room that also has strange things in it. The
 carpet gets very thick and comfortable in the middle of the room and
 it changes colors too.  A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed,
 but it is so large that it must be for Him) touches the hall and
 beyond it is a wide cloth bed. They look soft and you can't wait to
 get your paws on them. Far away is a mow through which you can see the
 outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish. Near
 the plant there is a large black shiny square and a frozen bug on top
 of it, and beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by some
 kind of stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that
 makes you feel relaxed and at home. You can't wait to smell each thing
 and find out how it got here and what Goodcat/Badcat has to say.

>smell tv
 The square has a scent history that tells you about the people that
 made it, but they are all far away. He doesn't often touch it and
 Goodcat/Badcat indicates that this is useful for distracting other
 humans.

>press button
 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine remote
 A black bar about half as long as you are, filled with a lot of
 buttons. It's obviously made for hands like His as the buttons are too
 small for you to push individually.

>push buttons
 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine tv
 It's a large black square, although it's also pretty shiny. You're too
 far away to note much else.

>jump on tv
 You jump on it for a moment, but quickly tire of the one-sided play.

>examine ball
 It's a curiously large bumpy ball with some kind of wooden stick
>smell ball
 You try to reach it, but it's too high up. Maybe if you were in the
 narrow bed.

>jump on bed
 What do you want to jump on: the sofa or the love seat?

>narrow
 You jump on the smaller springy-soft bed (this is a "love seat") and
 luxuriate in how it feels on your paws. You sniff around. There are
 several stories here, but they are simple ones. This place is one of
 Goodcat/Badcat's favorites. He was here earlier in the day and was
 feeling gassy. He thinks he shouldn't have eaten that crunchy thing he
 found under the tall vibrating box. There is that smell of Emily,
 again! She was visiting yesterday and was concerned that He had no
 offspring. She seems to think that He is too immature. You immediately
 think ill of her and want to show Her that He does have offspring --
 you!

>examine ball
 It's a curiously large bumpy ball with some kind of wooden stick
 holding it up. You sniff it and smell its papery, dusty kind of smell
 that reminds you of old things. It was put together with a lot of care
 and attention by men who wear lenses in front of their eyes.

>jump on ball
 You jump on it for a moment, but quickly tire of the one-sided play.

>smell ball
 The globe smells like Him, as He has touched it many times, and you
 can tell that He longs to go to faraway places. The globe also smells
 like the forest and some kind of paper made from trees. The forest is
 not right outside, but it is one near to here.
>turn ball
 [You can turn around, or you can turn left or right.]

>push ball
 It is fixed in place.

>paw globe
 You paw it but nothing amazing happens.

>spin globe
 You don't know how to do that. [For a list of common verbs, type HELP,
 or try using a different verb.]

>rub globe
 You idly rub against it and let the world know that you were here.

 From right outside, you hear what sounds like a storm -- a rumbling,
 grumbling, coughing sound. You look around for somewhere to hide, but
 before you can find a place, it's over. Then you hear a slamming like
 the mow when He leaves and right before He sees you. Is He coming
 back?
>look
 You can only go behind you.

 Without visiting the large soft bed? You promise yourself that you

 You hear some kind of metallic scratching sound and then you see the
 mow in the tiled area open. There He is! He shuts the mow, puts down
 His bag and greets Goodcat/Badcat. You meow energetically to let him
 know that you are here.

 He discovers you and picks you up. He strokes kindly you as He walks
 through the house, laughing at all the things you have done. "You are
 quite the little explorer, aren't you?" he asks. You purr. "That
 effort deserves nothing less than a name!" He holds you high in the
 air and then triumphantly christens you, "Isabella. Yes, Isabella is
 your name." You nuzzle your face into his arms, turning the name
 around and around in your mind. Isabella. It's a good name, well, as
 good as humans get at these things, you think. You beam up at Him as
 He carries you.

 I do not have a name, but I think that someday soon I will. I have
 heard Him talk many times of other things that have names, things like
 Mom, Dad, Emily, Stuart, God. So I think I will have a name someday
 soon, although I do not know how I get a name. Is it something I have
 to do? Is there somewhere I have to go? All I know is that for now, He
 calls me just one thing: Cat.

 Release 2 / Serial number 110524 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Soft Place</span>
 You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
 ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
 when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
 soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
 space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
 milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
 of that again.

 He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
 know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
 There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
 name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
 away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
 must be related, because you both are called Cat.

 You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
 lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
 be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
 Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

 [If this is your first time playing, type "ABOUT".]

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Place</span>
 Your Place surrounds the soft place. It's much bigger and it is soft
 on your feet, but not as soft as the soft place. You can run around
 here but the three ows stop you. Nothing has changed from this morning
 when He left -- the food dish, the water bowl, the sandbox, and the
 ledge are in their same places and they smell the same. The most
 interesting thing, though, is the mow. It's wide open in front of you
 and smells from outside are rushing in.

>smell


 You smell nothing particularly interesting.

>run


 You'll have to say which relative direction to go in (left, right,
 forward, back).You must supply a noun.

>forward



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">New Hall</span>
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out to your right and to your left taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- images sweep over you of Him, others
 like Him, a world filled with flying things and grass, clean scents
 and many others that you've never smelled before. Faintly, you also
 detect a sweet yet salty wild smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>examine ows


 They smell new and are dabbed with white. They run pretty far to your
 right and a shorter distance to your left.

>smell them


 I'm not sure what "them" refers to.

>smell ows


 You smell nothing particularly interesting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Hall</span>
 You are halfway down the hall, up to a good speed when you see
 something that compels you to stop and look. Here two mows face each
 other -- one that is not completely solid and one that doesn't reach
 the floor. The non-solid mow has slats from the top to the bottom,
 like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful fresh
 smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only there
 were something soft enough to sleep on.  Mmrrow. You can't help
 yourself and rub lazily against it. It feels good. The solid mow on
 the opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>examine mow


 What do you want to examine: the solid mow or the slatted mow?

>solid


 It's a large mow (like they all are) with a metal handle about
 half-way up. It doesn't reach the floor, and  underneath it is a white
 thing. Beyond it is his lair.

>examine white thing


 You can't get your nose close enough to really tell much about it,
 except that it's a covering for His paws and it smells like it.

>examine solid

>paw thing


 You don't see any such thing here.

>pull white thing


 You reach out for it and snag it in your claws; surprised, you pull
 back and pull it out into the room. You smell it more carefully and
 know that He put this on his paw two suns ago, had circular meat-bread
 for dinner, and generally felt happy. You remember that day. The
 covering itself is soft and yet stretchy. He calls this "sock". You
 look at it curiously, trying to understand why He needs a covering for
 his paws.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gated Hall</span>
 The hall from behind you ends here at a soft ow about half as tall as
 an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can see
 through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than Him,
 on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat has
 left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress in front of you.

>smell gate


 It is marked with a welcome message from Goodcat/Badcat whom suggests
 that getting past it is difficult.

 You are up to a good speed before you notice the ow coming at you. You
 come to a butt-burning halt. Youch!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End Hall</span>
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one
 to your right has sun filtering in through slats that make you want to
 rest in its warm spaces and play with the shadows. The room to your
 left is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.
 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 This room is darker than the others, and a whole plethora of scents
 rush out to find you. You take a moment perched on the threshold to
 decipher what they all mean. The first smell smells like He does
 sometimes -- like growing things, like the outside. It's too strong
 for you and it causes your nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next
 strongest smell is a fresh, clean smell that must be some kind of
 water. You know by the third smell that this is His place, because He
 has marked it. Mixed in with that territorial odor are lesser notes
 that smell like all sorts of yummy things. You're so glad he marked
 the area so you'd know where they are! It's odd, though. You look
 around but don't see a litterbox anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see what looks like a very long water
 bowl. It has sides so you can jump up on it and take look inside. It
 smells like that water smell. Opposite it is a fat water bowl, where
 the territorial smell and the yummy smells come from. You could jump
 up on it, too. Right beside you are wooden boxes, and on top of them
 is a tall dark window.

 Wait! There's something in the window. Your hackles rise and your fur
 poofs out. It's another cat, the same size as you!

>jump on bowl


 With feline agility, you leap up to the deep water bowl.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Toilet Rim</span>
 You are halfway between the dark window and the floor, perched on the
 fat water bowl. It's not soft, but it is fairly slick. The wonderful
 smells rise up from the hollow center, down in the water. You see
 above you a wide ledge that runs underneath the window. You could
 easily jump to it, or jump down to the bathroom floor.

>drink water


 You're not thirsty, but you can't pass this opportunity up -- the
 smells are too interesting. Carefully you lower yourself into the
 toilet and take ten deep laps of the water. Then you pull yourself
 back up on the rim and luxuriate in the taste of tea, yogurt, and
 submarine sandwiches. You're thankful again that He was so kind to
 mark the area so that you'd know to find it.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

>jump on ledge


 With amazing grace, you land on the space above the handles with a
 solid "whump".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom Counter</span>
 You barely notice the rest of the surface except for the sink, which
 smells like his breath and some sort of plant. The dark window takes
 up the entire wall and inside there is another cat! Her fur is poofed
 out just like yours and her green eyes stare back at you in challenge.

>hiss


 You let out a bloodcurdling meow of warning, but she doesn't respond.
 Her mouth moves, but no sound comes out.

>smell mirror


 You lean your nose in to smell her and she does the exact same thing.
 Then you realize what seemed so strange about all of this: you never
 once smelled her. How can she have no scent and no voice? What sort of
 cat is that? You realize, too, that she only does what you do. If you
 stop, she stops; if you groom yourself, she grooms herself; if you
 blink, she blinks. She does whatever you do because she is you,
 somehow. Only not you and only in the dark window. It's weird, but
 you're glad you're not a human and have to deal with such
 complexities.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

>go down


 You can jump down, back to the bathroom, or you can jump to the fat
 water bowl.

>jump down


 You raise and lower your head a few times, estimating the distance. On
 a whim, you decide to go for it and you jump down. It takes you a
 moment to get your breath back.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 The hallway light provides the only light in this dark room. Your eyes
 adjust and your nose comes alive with the many different scents
 inside. The first smell smells like He does sometimes -- like growing
 things, like the outside. It's too strong for you and it causes your
 nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next strongest smell is a fresh,
 clean smell that must be some kind of water. You know by the third

 is a tall dark window.

 You see your reflection peeking down at you from the window, green
 eyes glowing in the dark.

 You feel more relaxed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End Hall</span>

 in front of you has sun filtering in through slats that make you want

 you is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the
 window on the far side of the room. Shadows and light play across the
 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

>examine short


 This is shortest box. It is held closed by a brown stripe, and you can
 easily jump up to it from the floor.

>examine tall


 You're too far away from it. Maybe if you were on it, you could do
 that.

>jump on short


 You leap up to the box and then look around, surveying your new
 surroundings.

>examine stripe


 What do you want to examine: brown stripe or green stripe?

>brown


 You don't see how.

>pull brown stripe


 You don't see how.

>go down


 You jump artfully to the floor and land on all four paws.

 left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get

 The tall stringy gate bars progress in front of you.

>climb gate


 You bound to the gate, spring upwards, and latch your claws into the
 material. Then, putting one paw in front of another, you climb up to
 the top of the gate and leap gracefully down. You turn and look behind
 you, your tail crooked, feeling proud of yourself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>
 Just to your right, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads in front of you, but behind you
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Den</span>
 This is a comfortable room that also has strange things in it. The
 carpet gets very thick and comfortable in the middle of the room and
 it changes colors too.  A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed,
 but it is so large that it must be for Him) touches the hall and
 beyond it is a wide cloth bed. They look soft and you can't wait to
 get your paws on them. Far away is a mow through which you can see the
 outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish. Near
 the plant there is a large black shiny square and a frozen bug on top
 of it, and beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by some
 kind of stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that
 makes you feel relaxed and at home. You can't wait to smell each thing
 and find out how it got here and what Goodcat/Badcat has to say.

>jump on narrow


 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine bed


 What do you want to examine: the sofa or the love seat?

>examine seat


 You see nothing special about the love seat.

>examine sofa


 You see nothing special about the sofa.

>jump on sofa


 You jump up on the large springy-soft bed (what they call a "sofa")
 and love how it feels on your paws -- so soft! You sniff around and
 are startled by all the big cats that have sat here and their stories.
 It takes you several sniffs to make them all out. Apparently He sits
 here when he is tired; He sat here yesterday. He also sat here two
 days ago (the day of the big noise) with Barry, and they talked about
 far-away places. Barry wants to romance his broodmate, but won't tell
 Him. Then there is the scent of an older big cat, who must be very
 wise, because he gives knowledge to others all day. He seems to be
 related to Him, but you're not clear how. He's not a mother or a
 littermate.

>smell sofa


 You smell nothing particularly interesting.

>examine plant


 It looks like a rather large plant sitting in a bowl of dark dirt. It
 has a lot of green leaves and it reaches almost as high as the black
 square!

>examine square


 It's a large black square, although it's also pretty shiny. When you
 walk by it, you see something blurry moving inside it, but you can't
 smell what it is. The square has a scent history that tells you about
 the people that made it, but they are all far away. He doesn't often
 touch it and Goodcat/Badcat indicates that this is useful for
 distracting other humans.
>eat plant


 That doesn't smell like something you'd like to eat.

>claw plant


 You claw it to no effect.

>examine dish


 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine bowl


 You don't see any such thing here.

>jump on plant


 You jump on it for a moment, but quickly tire of the one-sided play.

>chew plant


 You don't know how to do that. [For a list of common verbs, type HELP,
 or try using a different verb.]

>poop in dirt


 I only understood you as far as wanting to poop.

>poop


 You can't even imagine how much trouble you'd get into if you did
 that. Besides, you've already gone in the sandbox this morning.

>score


 You have so far scored 4 out of a possible 20, in 56 turns.

>go down


 You spring down to the floor.

>jump on seat


 You jump on the smaller springy-soft bed (this is a "love seat") and
 luxuriate in how it feels on your paws. You sniff around. There are
 several stories here, but they are simple ones. This place is one of
 Goodcat/Badcat's favorites. He was here earlier in the day and was
 feeling gassy. He thinks he shouldn't have eaten that crunchy thing he
 found under the tall vibrating box. There is the scent left by His
 littermate; She was visiting yesterday and was concerned that He had
 no offspring. She seems to think that He is too immature. You
 immediately think ill of her and want to show Her that He does have
 offspring -- you!

>claw seat


 You claw it to no effect.

>examine globe


 It's a curiously large bumpy ball with some kind of wooden stick
 holding it up. You sniff it and smell its papery, dusty kind of smell
 that reminds you of old things. It was put together with a lot of care
 and attention by men who wear lenses in front of their eyes.

>rub it


 You idly rub against it and let the world know that you were here.

 Suddenly a loud ringing sound comes from somewhere nearby and it
 startles you a foot into the air.

>go down


 You spring down to the floor.

 You hear a ringing sound. It's pretty loud, and it's coming from
 nearby.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors. Goodcat/Badcat is in this room; his scent is strong. You
 whip your head around but don't see him anywhere. Is he waiting to
 pounce you? You continue looking around carefully.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor is a
 large brown circle held up by four legs. Underneath it are two smaller
 versions, with one pulled away from the other. You wind your way
 around these things and quickly smell what their names are. The large
 thing is called a table. The smaller things are called chairs (one is
 His and the other is guest). The names seem strong, but dull. You hope
 He doesn't name you any of those names.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

 The phone on the table nearby rings, and it's loud!

>jump on his chair


 You agilely leap upwards into the chair.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

 The phone on the table nearby rings, and it's loud!

>jump on table


 You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
 surface.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brown Table</span>
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now. You also realize
 the names of the two objects on the table, and your interest is
 piqued.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

 The phone rings right beside you. It's loud!

 Suddenly but thankfully, the phone stops ringing.

 pounce you? You continue looking around carefully.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor is a
 large brown circle held up by four legs. Underneath it are two smaller
 versions, with one pulled away from the other. You wind your way
 around these things and quickly smell what their names are. The large
 thing is called a table. The smaller things are called chairs (one is
 His and the other is guest). The names seem strong, but dull. You hope
 He doesn't name you any of those names.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

 The phone on the table nearby rings, and it's loud!

>jump on his chair


 You agilely leap upwards into the chair.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

>jump on table


 You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
 surface.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brown Table</span>
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now. You also realize
 the names of the two objects on the table, and your interest is
 piqued.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

 The phone rings right beside you. It's loud!

>attack phone


 You attack the phone, trying to Make The Ringing Stop. You smack the
 curvy part with your paw and send it flying. The ringing stops! But
 then you hear a concerned female voice talking out of it. It's saying
 some kind of greeting.

 A concerned female voice speaks from the phone right beside you.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

>mew


 You say "Meowr?" to let the voice know that you are here and want to
 know what's going on. The voice asks you a question that you don't
 understand, laughs, and then says some other things, and finally it
 says "goodbye". You know then it will go away and it does.

 An artificial voice from the phone repeats itself with strange quiet
 parts between.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

>sniff phone


 It smells like His hands, because He holds it often. It also smells
 like His breath, because He talks into it. You find out that it was
 made far away and sent here on something that travels across water and
 that inside, it is delicate.

 An artificial voice from the phone repeats itself with strange quiet
 parts between.

>jump on ledge


 That doesn't look far away. You take a quick look and with a little
 jump you land safely on the countertop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countertop</span>
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place.  It makes you feel
 powerful and important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and
 had a few cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer
 and not so narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump
 up to the metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of
 Goodcat/Badcat. He is near.

 An artificial voice from the phone on the table repeats itself with
 strange quiet parts between.

>jump on ftop


 You leap up to the top with the greatest of ease.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Refrigerator Top</span>
 On top of this cold metal cube, you find what you've been expecting
 the whole time: Goodcat/Badcat. He is a refined grey cat with black
 stripes who sits with his body perpendicular to yours, his head facing
 you. He has two large yellow eyes and seems unaffected by your
 arrival, as though he had been expecting you.

 You can see Goodcat/Badcat here.

 An artificial voice from the phone on the table repeats itself with
 strange quiet parts between.

>show sock to cat


 Goodcat/Badcat is unimpressed.

 A horrible grating sound comes out of the phone on the table!
 Goodcat/Badcat makes a disgusted face and his baleful eyes blame you.

>give sock to cat


 Goodcat/Badcat sniffs the air and then sniffs the sock, taking his
 time to inhale all of its scents. He looks thoughtful for a moment and
 then rubs you, pressing into your fur one of his secrets. Fascinated,
 you ponder all the fun you'll have when you chew off a piece of
 meat-bread and leave it behind the vibrating box for twenty suns so
 that you too can have a smelly play toy!

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

>rub cat


 You approach him but at the last moment, back off. His fierce stare
 seems to shout, "How dare you approach when we have not properly
 greeted one another yet!"

 The awful grating sound stops and the phone is silent once again.
 Goodcat/Badcat exhales loudly and fixes you with an expression that
 clearly communicates, "Let's not do that again, shall we?" You feel
 embarrassed but relieved.

>jump on ledge


 You jump down and land on the countertop with a noticeable "thud".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countertop</span>
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place. Only the
 refrigerator top gives a better view. It makes you feel powerful and

 narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump up to the

>jump down


 You look down hesitantly at the floor. That's too far away!

>jump on table


 You span the distance with a soft jump and skid to a stop on the
 table.

>jump down


 After a few moments of weightless falling and the rude impact, you are
 once again walking around on the shiny floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor the
 brown table towers over you. The guest chair sits underneath it, and
 His chair is nearby.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

>examine fridge


 Brr! It's cold, but it smells like all kinds of yummy things. He calls
 this "fridge". Goodcat/Badcat agrees with your assessment, so you
 naturally rub against it to add your opinion officially to his.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

>look under it

 One of them smells more like water than food, and the other smells

 Both of them have parts that stick out that look like you could walk

 Goodcat/Badcat indicates that these are interesting only when open,
 but the hot-smelling one hurts.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>
 Just behind you, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads to your right, but to your left
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress to your left.

>examine carpet


 It is a light brownish color. You smell around and take several
 minutes to soak up the knowledge of who ate what, where they were
 going, and how they were feeling. The knowledge makes you feel quite
 important, as if you had discovered the key to understanding what
 happens around here.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Den</span>
 This is a comfortable room that also has strange things in it. The
 carpet gets very thick and comfortable in the middle of the room and
 it changes colors too.  A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed,
 but it is so large that it must be for Him) touches the hall and
 beyond it is a wide cloth bed. Far away is a mow through which you can
 see the outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish.
 Near the plant there is a large black shiny square and a frozen bug on
 top of it, and beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by
 some kind of stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that
 makes you feel relaxed and at home.

>examine water dish


 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine plant


 It looks like a rather large plant sitting in a bowl of dark dirt. It
 has a lot of green leaves and it reaches almost as high as the black
 square! The plant smells woodsy and growing, but not like something
 you'd like to eat. It is growing from a bowl of dirt that strikes you
 as perfect for playing in.

>smell it

 You jump on it for a moment, but quickly tire of the one-sided play.

 Digging would be better, you think.

>dig it


 It seemed like such a great idea, but after a few moments of digging
 in the soil, you find nothing in it and have soil all over your paws.
 It's such a gross feeling that you try to shake it off. Dirt goes
 flying all around the plant, but some of it stays on your paws. Maybe
 if you walked around it would just come off. You really don't want to
 lick it off unless you absolutely have to.

 As you climb the gate up one side and down the other, that disgusting
 dirt shakes loose in the process. With a few licks here and there,
 you're as clean as ever. You're pleased as punch.

 You clamber over the gate again, quickly, but not silently.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gated Hall</span>
 The hall from in front of you ends here at a soft ow about half as
 tall as an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can
 see through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than
 Him, on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat
 has left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were

 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to
 investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild
 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Hall</span>
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the

 there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the
 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from

 it looks like it is made up of different tiles, all different colors.
 Sniffing the edges, you realize that it is a gateway to the outside.
 Images of grass, bright sunshine, concern, danger, and burden roll
 over you and you think that the outside is a fearful but wonderful
 place, and amazingly large. You smell Her scent again, like flowers
 but far too strong. It fills you with a fierce passion; she should

 You can see Goodcat/Badcat here.

 Dropped.

 You feel clean and smell like yourself. You don't see the need to

>jump on cat


 You jump on it for a moment, but quickly tire of the one-sided play.

>hit cat


 Looking back on it, you realize that this was one of those things that
 would have never worked out. You pounced him and he responded with a
 bloodcurdling hiss and a swift paw that sent you flying right off the
 vibrating metal box. You landed on the ledge below and backed away
 just in time to avoid him jumping on you. Fear and adrenaline ran
 through your veins and you jumped, jumped, and ran like your tail was
 on fire. Now you're on the other side of that stringy ow, catching
 your breath, the image of him turning away with a refined departing
 spit echoing in your ears. His departing words were, "And don't come
 back!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gated Hall</span>
 The hall from to your right ends here at a soft ow about half as tall
 as an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can see
 through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than Him,
 on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat has
 left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 You're not sure how you talk with another cat, after all, your only

 you try talking to Goodcat/Badcat like you were talking to Him. You

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countertop</span>
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place. Only the
 refrigerator top gives a better view. It makes you feel powerful and
 important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and had a few
 cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer and not so
 narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump up to the
 metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of Goodcat/Badcat.
 He is near.

>jump on table


 You span the distance with a soft jump and skid to a stop on the
 table.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brown Table</span>
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now.

 You can see a phone here.

>jump down


 After a few moments of weightless falling and the rude impact, you are
 once again walking around on the shiny floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor the
 brown table towers over you. The guest chair sits underneath it, and
 His chair is nearby.

 You can see a sock here.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

>claw fridge


 You claw it to no effect.

>examine table


 In the middle of the the floor is a large brown circle held up by four
 legs, called the table. It is made out of wood, but it also smells of
 various oils and you get some idea of the men who crafted it.
 Goodcat/Badcat has left his scent upon the legs, identifying the table
 as his territory. He seems to have been impatiently waiting most of
 the time, hoping for Him to drop some tasty food.

>rub table


 You swirl around two of the legs to add your scent flourish. Now He
 will know you have been here. The thought fills you with a secret
 delight.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>
 Just behind you, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads to your right, but to your left
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress to your left.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Den</span>
 This is a comfortable room that also has strange things in it. The
 carpet gets very thick and comfortable in the middle of the room and
 it changes colors too.  A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed,
 but it is so large that it must be for Him) touches the hall and
 beyond it is a wide cloth bed. Far away is a mow through which you can
 see the outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish.
 Near the plant there is a large black shiny square and a frozen bug on
 top of it, and beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by
 some kind of stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that
 makes you feel relaxed and at home.

>dig dirt


 It seemed like such a great idea, but after a few moments of digging
 in the soil, you find nothing in it and have soil all over your paws.
 It's such a gross feeling that you try to shake it off. Dirt goes
 flying all around the plant, but some of it stays on your paws. Maybe
 if you walked around it would just come off. You really don't want to
 lick it off unless you absolutely have to.

 As you climb the gate up one side and down the other, that disgusting

 you're as clean as ever. You're pleased as punch.

 You clamber over the gate again, quickly, but not silently.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gated Hall</span>
 The hall from in front of you ends here at a soft ow about half as
 tall as an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can
 see through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than
 Him, on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat
 has left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">New Hall</span>
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out in front of you and behind you taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to
 investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild
 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Hall</span>
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the
 bottom, like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful
 fresh smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only
 there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the
 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

 smell comes from beyond it.

 The hallway light provides the only light in this dark room. Your eyes
 adjust and your nose comes alive with the many different scents
 inside. The first smell smells like He does sometimes -- like growing
 things, like the outside. It's too strong for you and it causes your
 nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next strongest smell is a fresh,
 clean smell that must be some kind of water. You know by the third
 smell that this is His place, because He has marked it. Mixed in with
 that territorial odor are lesser notes that smell like all sorts of
 yummy things. You're so glad he marked the area so you'd know where
 they are! It's odd, though. You look around but don't see a litterbox
 anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see what looks like a very long water
 bowl. It has sides so you can jump up on it and take look inside. It
 smells like that water smell. Opposite it is a giant white chair that
 is hollow in the middle, where the territorial smell and the yummy
 smells come from. You could jump up on it, too. Right beside you are
 wooden boxes, and on top of them is a tall dark window.

 You see your reflection peeking down at you from the window, green
 eyes glowing in the dark.

>jump on tub


 You're a bit hesitant to jump where you can't see, so you jump up on
 the surrounding ledge instead.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tub Edge</span>

 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the

 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

 then decide to go for it. You feel a few moments of glorious
 weightlessness and then you settle on the box with a gentle "thump".

 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">New Hall</span>
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out behind you and in front of you taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to
 investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild
 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gated Hall</span>
 The hall from behind you ends here at a soft ow about half as tall as
 an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can see
 through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than Him,
 on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat has
 left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress in front of you.

>look


 You can go behind you back to New Hall, or you can climb the gate.

>climb gate


 You clamber over the gate again, quickly, but unfortunately not
 silently.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>
 Just to your right, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads in front of you, but behind you
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress behind you.

>r



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor the
 brown table towers over you. The guest chair sits underneath it, and
 His chair is nearby.

>jump on his chair


 You agilely leap upwards into the chair.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

>jump on table


 You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
 surface.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brown Table</span>
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

>get remote


 You already have the sock in your mouth!

>drop sok


 You don't see any such thing here.

>drop sock


 Dropped.

>get remote


 You take it into your mouth, but you're barely able to keep a good
 grip on it. You're not sure you could do anything besides walking.

>jump on ledge


 That doesn't look far away. You take a quick look and with a little
 jump you land safely on the countertop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countertop</span>
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place. Only the
 refrigerator top gives a better view. It makes you feel powerful and
 important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and had a few
 cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer and not so
 narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump up to the
 metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of Goodcat/Badcat.
 He is near.

>jump on ftop


 You leap up to the top with the greatest of ease.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Refrigerator Top</span>
 You are on top of the cold metal cube, better known as "refrigerator"
 and "Goodcat/Badcat's lair". Strangely, it is not cold here, but
 fairly cozy with the faint smell of food. You can see why he chose
 this location for a lair. You think you'd probably have done the same.

 You can see Goodcat/Badcat here.

>drop remote


 Dropped.

>nap


 You're exploring! No time for napping now.

>jump down


 You lean down the side and take a half-jump the rest of the way down.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countertop</span>
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place. Only the

 You span the distance with a soft jump and skid to a stop on the
 table.

 After a few moments of weightless falling and the rude impact, you are
 once again walking around on the shiny floor.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

 left, right, forwards, and backwards.]

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>
 Just behind you, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads to your right, but to your left
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress to your left.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Den</span>
 This is a comfortable room that also has strange things in it. The
 carpet gets very thick and comfortable in the middle of the room and
 it changes colors too. It even has tiny decorative brown paw prints
 across it. A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed, but it is so
 large that it must be for Him) touches the hall and beyond it is a
 wide cloth bed. Far away is a mow through which you can see the
 outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish. In the
 dirt scattered around the plant, you see several small paw prints. You
 grimace. Why did He put that nasty thing there? Near the plant there
 is a large black shiny square and a frozen bug on top of it, and
 beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by some kind of
 stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that makes you
 feel relaxed and at home.

>jump on sofa


 You jump up on it once more, glad to be in a soft space around the
 smells of your people.

>nap


 You're exploring! No time for napping now.

>curl up


 You don't know how to do that. [For a list of common verbs, type HELP,

 You paw it but nothing amazing happens.

 You can go in front of you, behind you, to your left, or climb the

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tiled Door</span>
 The carpet ends here at a mow like the one that leads out of your
 place. You're not sure how He manages to open these things, but He
 must be strong. This mow looks a lot like the shiny floor, actually;
 it looks like it is made up of different tiles, all different colors.
 Sniffing the edges, you realize that it is a gateway to the outside.
 Images of grass, bright sunshine, concern, danger, and burden roll
 over you and you think that the outside is a fearful but wonderful
 place, and amazingly large. You smell Her scent again, like flowers
 but far too strong. It fills you with a fierce passion; she should
 know that you live here!

>examine tiles


 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine floor


 It is a light brownish color that has dirty pawprints on it. You smell
 around and take several minutes to soak up the knowledge of who ate
 what, where they were going, and how they were feeling. The knowledge
 makes you feel quite important, as if you had discovered the key to
 understanding what happens around here.

>look


 There's only one way out: to return the way you came by going behind
 you.

>b


 You turn to face behind you and bound away.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress in front of you.

 From right outside, you hear what sounds like a storm -- a rumbling,
 grumbling, coughing sound. You look around for somewhere to hide, but
 before you can find a place, it's over. Then you hear a slamming like
 the mow when He leaves and right before He sees you. Is He coming
 back?

 You hear a mow open from far away and then hear it shut; His voice is
 next, as He greets Goodcat/Badcat. You meow energetically to let him
 know you are here.

 He discovers you and picks you up. He strokes kindly you as He walks
 through the house, laughing at all the things you have done. "You are
 quite the little explorer, aren't you?" he asks. You purr. "That
 effort deserves nothing less than a name!" He holds you high in the
 air and then triumphantly christens you, "Isabella. Yes, Isabella is
 your name." You nuzzle your face into his arms, turning the name
 around and around in your mind. Isabella. It's a good name, well, as
 good as humans get at these things, you think. You beam up at Him as
 He carries you.

 I do not have a name, but I think that someday soon I will. I have
 heard Him talk many times of other things that have names, things like
 Mom, Dad, Emily, Stuart, God. So I think I will have a name someday
 soon, although I do not know how I get a name. Is it something I have
 to do? Is there somewhere I have to go? All I know is that for now, He
 calls me just one thing: Cat.

 A slice-of-life adventure from a feline perspective,  by Poster
 Release 2 / Serial number 110524 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Soft Place</span>
 You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
 ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
 when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
 soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
 space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
 milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
 of that again.

 He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
 know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
 There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
 name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
 away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
 must be related, because you both are called Cat.

 You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
 lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
 be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
 Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

 [If this is your first time playing, type "ABOUT".]



>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Place</span>
 Your Place surrounds the soft place. It's much bigger and it is soft
 on your feet, but not as soft as the soft place. You can run around
 here but the three ows stop you. Nothing has changed from this morning
 when He left -- the food dish, the water bowl, the sandbox, and the
 ledge are in their same places and they smell the same. The most
 interesting thing, though, is the mow. It's wide open in front of you
 and smells from outside are rushing in.

>examine dish


 It's a small dish with food in it.

>eat food


 (first taking the cat food)
 Your mother raised you to not play with your food unless you were
 hungry enough to eat (or drink) it. You can feel her teeth picking you
 up by the scruff of the neck even now.

>examine bowl


 It's a small solid bowl with water in it.

>drink water


 You're not thirsty right now.

>examine litterbox


 It's a tough box filled with sand that's just right for taking care of
 wastes.

>enter box


 You don't see any such thing here.

>enter litterbox


 Fortunately, you've already gone this morning.

>dig sand


 You don't see any such thing here.

>dig litterbox


 You don't think you can dig that.

>look


 You can go behind you or in front of you, though in front of you seems
 a lot more interesting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">New Hall</span>
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out to your right and to your left taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- images sweep over you of Him, others
 like Him, a world filled with flying things and grass, clean scents
 and many others that you've never smelled before. Faintly, you also
 detect a sweet yet salty wild smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>f


 You can go to your right and to your left down the hall, and behind
 you back to your place.

>r



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Hall</span>
 You are halfway down the hall, up to a good speed when you see
 something that compels you to stop and look. Here two mows face each
 other -- one that is not completely solid and one that doesn't reach
 the floor. The non-solid mow has slats from the top to the bottom,
 like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful fresh
 smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only there
 were something soft enough to sleep on.  Mmrrow. You can't help
 yourself and rub lazily against it. It feels good. The solid mow on
 the opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>r


 You can go behind you back to New Hall and in front of you to the end
 of the hall.

>look through slatted


 You find nothing of interest.

>f


 You are up to a good speed before you notice the ow coming at you. You
 come to a butt-burning halt. Youch!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End Hall</span>
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one
 to your right has sun filtering in through slats that make you want to
 rest in its warm spaces and play with the shadows. The room to your
 left is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.
 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

>f


 You can go behind you down the hall, to your left to the dark room, or
 to your right to the sunny room.

>r



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the
 window on the far side of the room. Shadows and light play across the
 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

 You can go behind you or out to leave the room.

>climb gate


 You bound to the gate, spring upwards, and latch your claws into the
 material. Then, putting one paw in front of another, you climb up to
 the top of the gate and leap gracefully down. You turn and look behind
 you, your tail crooked, feeling proud of yourself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors. Goodcat/Badcat is in this room; his scent is strong. You
 whip your head around but don't see him anywhere. Is he waiting to
 pounce you? You continue looking around carefully.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor is a
 large brown circle held up by four legs. Underneath it are two smaller
 versions, with one pulled away from the other. You wind your way
 around these things and quickly smell what their names are. The large
 thing is called a table. The smaller things are called chairs (one is
 His and the other is guest). The names seem strong, but dull. You hope
 He doesn't name you any of those names.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

 From here you can go behind you and you can jump to His chair.

 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you

 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large

 used for eating food, but there is no food here now. You also realize
 the names of the two objects on the table, and your interest is
 piqued.

 New Cat is a ethereal, Romantic, wistful, slice-of-life game told from
 the eyes of the new cat in the household, who as yet does not have a
 name.

 Directions are: forward, back(ward), left, right, up, and down. Most
 rooms will tell you where the exits are, and if you're in a room with
 only one way out, OUT works as well. Other new verbs of note are rub
 (against), scratch, bat, paw, jump to, jump over, jump down, meow
 (talk), and lick.

 The point of the game is to explore the new world that is yours. The
 game ends when your master returns.

 Score represents experience, and not all experiences are pleasant. You

 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor the
 brown table towers over you. The guest chair sits underneath it, and
 His chair is nearby.

 Are you sure you want to restart?

 I do not have a name, but I think that someday soon I will. I have
 heard Him talk many times of other things that have names, things like
 Mom, Dad, Emily, Stuart, God. So I think I will have a name someday
 soon, although I do not know how I get a name. Is it something I have
 to do? Is there somewhere I have to go? All I know is that for now, He
 calls me just one thing: Cat.

 A slice-of-life adventure from a feline perspective,  by Poster
 Release 2 / Serial number 110524 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Soft Place</span>
 You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
 ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
 when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
 soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
 space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
 milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
 of that again.

 He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
 know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
 There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
 name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
 away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
 must be related, because you both are called Cat.

 You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
 lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
 be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
 Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

 [If this is your first time playing, type "ABOUT".]



>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Place</span>
 Your Place surrounds the soft place. It's much bigger and it is soft
 on your feet, but not as soft as the soft place. You can run around
 here but the three ows stop you. Nothing has changed from this morning
 when He left -- the food dish, the water bowl, the sandbox, and the
 ledge are in their same places and they smell the same. The most
 interesting thing, though, is the mow. It's wide open in front of you
 and smells from outside are rushing in.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">New Hall</span>
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out to your right and to your left taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- images sweep over you of Him, others
 like Him, a world filled with flying things and grass, clean scents
 and many others that you've never smelled before. Faintly, you also
 detect a sweet yet salty wild smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>r



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Hall</span>
 You are halfway down the hall, up to a good speed when you see
 something that compels you to stop and look. Here two mows face each
 other -- one that is not completely solid and one that doesn't reach
 the floor. The non-solid mow has slats from the top to the bottom,
 like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful fresh
 smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only there
 were something soft enough to sleep on.  Mmrrow. You can't help
 yourself and rub lazily against it. It feels good. The solid mow on
 the opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>examine solid


 It's a large mow (like they all are) with a metal handle about
 half-way up. It doesn't reach the floor, and  underneath it is a white
 thing. Beyond it is his lair.

>examine white thing


 You can't get your nose close enough to really tell much about it,
 except that it's a covering for His paws and it smells like it.

>get sock


 You reach out for it and snag it in your claws; surprised, you pull
 back and pull it out into the room. You smell it more carefully and
 know that He put this on his paw two suns ago, had circular meat-bread
 for dinner, and generally felt happy. You remember that day. The
 covering itself is soft and yet stretchy. He calls this "sock". You
 look at it curiously, trying to understand why He needs a covering for
 his paws.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

>get it


 You take it in your mouth.

>r


 You can go behind you back to New Hall and in front of you to the end
 of the hall.

>f


 You are up to a good speed before you notice the ow coming at you. You
 come to a butt-burning halt. Youch!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End Hall</span>
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one
 to your right has sun filtering in through slats that make you want to
 rest in its warm spaces and play with the shadows. The room to your
 left is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.
 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

 The house settles and creaks, giving you a start.

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 This room is darker than the others, and a whole plethora of scents
 rush out to find you. You take a moment perched on the threshold to
 decipher what they all mean. The first smell smells like He does
 sometimes -- like growing things, like the outside. It's too strong
 for you and it causes your nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next
 strongest smell is a fresh, clean smell that must be some kind of
 water. You know by the third smell that this is His place, because He
 has marked it. Mixed in with that territorial odor are lesser notes
 that smell like all sorts of yummy things. You're so glad he marked
 the area so you'd know where they are! It's odd, though. You look
 around but don't see a litterbox anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see what looks like a very long water
 bowl. It has sides so you can jump up on it and take look inside. It
 smells like that water smell. Opposite it is a fat water bowl, where
 the territorial smell and the yummy smells come from. You could jump
 up on it, too. Right beside you are wooden boxes, and on top of them
 is a tall dark window.

 Wait! There's something in the window. Your hackles rise and your fur
 poofs out. It's another cat, the same size as you!

>jump on ledge


 You try and miss in one glorious mess.

>jump on toilet


 (the toilet)
 With feline agility, you leap up to the deep water bowl.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Toilet Rim</span>
 You are halfway between the dark window and the floor, perched on the
 fat water bowl. It's not soft, but it is fairly slick. The wonderful
 smells rise up from the hollow center, down in the water. You see
 above you a wide ledge that runs underneath the window. You could
 easily jump to it, or jump down to the bathroom floor.

>lick water


 You're not thirsty, but you can't pass this opportunity up -- the
 smells are too interesting. Carefully you lower yourself into the
 toilet and take ten deep laps of the water. Then you pull yourself
 back up on the rim and luxuriate in the taste of tea, yogurt, and
 submarine sandwiches. You're thankful again that He was so kind to
 mark the area so that you'd know to find it.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

>jump on ledge


 With amazing grace, you land on the space above the handles with a
 solid "whump".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom Counter</span>
 You barely notice the rest of the surface except for the sink, which
 smells like his breath and some sort of plant. The dark window takes
 up the entire wall and inside there is another cat! Her fur is poofed
 out just like yours and her green eyes stare back at you in challenge.

>sniff cat


 You lean your nose in to smell her and she does the exact same thing.
 Then you realize what seemed so strange about all of this: you never
 once smelled her. How can she have no scent ? What sort of cat is
 that? You realize, too, that she only does what you do. If you stop,
 she stops; if you groom yourself, she grooms herself; if you blink,
 she blinks. She does whatever you do because she is you, somehow. Only
 not you and only in the dark window. It's weird, but you're glad
 you're not a human and have to deal with such complexities.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

>jump on tub


 Not from here. It's too far away!

>jump down


 You raise and lower your head a few times, estimating the distance. On
 a whim, you decide to go for it and you jump down. It takes you a
 moment to get your breath back.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 The hallway light provides the only light in this dark room. Your eyes
 adjust and your nose comes alive with the many different scents
 inside. The first smell smells like He does sometimes -- like growing
 things, like the outside. It's too strong for you and it causes your
 nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next strongest smell is a fresh,
 clean smell that must be some kind of water. You know by the third

 You see your reflection peeking down at you from the window, green
 eyes glowing in the dark.

>jump on tub


 You're a bit hesitant to jump where you can't see, so you jump up on
 the surrounding ledge instead.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tub Edge</span>
 You are perched uncomfortably on the narrow ledge around the  tub. The
 surface beneath you is hard and damp, and that clean water smell comes
 from all around you. You can either enter the tub, or jump down back
 into the bathroom.

>enter tub


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside Tub</span>
 You walk around inside the tub and notice, strangely, that this place
 smells like His paws. Does He stand up in it? It looks long enough for
 him to lie down in it. The water smell saturates the area, and you
 know that this place must usually be wet. Right now it is only damp.
 He calls this place "tub".

>climb tub


 Jumping to it is much more kittenish.

>out


 You bound out.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tub Edge</span>
 You are perched uncomfortably on the narrow ledge around the  tub. The

 you is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.

 You can go to your right down the hall, behind you to the dark room,
 or in front of you to the sunny room.

 You turn to face to your right and bound away.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Hall</span>
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the
 bottom, like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful
 fresh smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only
 there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the
 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He

 stretched out behind you and in front of you taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest

 your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to
 investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild
 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gated Hall</span>
 The hall from behind you ends here at a soft ow about half as tall as
 an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can see
 through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than Him,
 on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat has
 left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress in front of you.

>climb gate


 You bound to the gate, spring upwards, and latch your claws into the
 material. Then, putting one paw in front of another, you climb up to
 the top of the gate and leap gracefully down. You turn and look behind
 you, your tail crooked, feeling proud of yourself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>
 Just to your right, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads in front of you, but behind you
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress behind you.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Den</span>
 This is a comfortable room that also has strange things in it. The
 carpet gets very thick and comfortable in the middle of the room and
 it changes colors too.  A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed,
 but it is so large that it must be for Him) touches the hall and
 beyond it is a wide cloth bed. They look soft and you can't wait to
 get your paws on them. Far away is a mow through which you can see the
 outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish. Near
 the plant there is a large black shiny square and a frozen bug on top
 of it, and beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by some
 kind of stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that
 makes you feel relaxed and at home. You can't wait to smell each thing
 and find out how it got here and what Goodcat/Badcat has to say.

>dig dirt


 It seemed like such a great idea, but after a few moments of digging
 in the soil, you find nothing in it and have soil all over your paws.
 It's such a gross feeling that you try to shake it off. Dirt goes
 flying all around the plant, but some of it stays on your paws. Maybe
 if you walked around it would just come off. You really don't want to
 lick it off unless you absolutely have to.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You feel like you have achieved something particularly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">kittenish.</span>

 Without exploring those two large and soft beds? You promise yourself
 that when you get done with this important task, you will get your
 paws on them.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>
 Just in front of you, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the
 large shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors. Goodcat/Badcat is in this room; his scent is strong. You
 whip your head around but don't see him anywhere. Is he waiting to
 pounce you? You continue looking around carefully.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor is a
 large brown circle held up by four legs. Underneath it are two smaller
 versions, with one pulled away from the other. You wind your way
 around these things and quickly smell what their names are. The large
 thing is called a table. The smaller things are called chairs (one is
 His and the other is guest). The names seem strong, but dull. You hope
 He doesn't name you any of those names.

>jump on chair


 What do you want to jump on: the guest chair or His chair?

>his


 You agilely leap upwards into the chair.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

>jump on table


 You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
 surface.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brown Table</span>
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now. You also realize
 the names of the two objects on the table, and your interest is
 piqued.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

 That doesn't look far away. You take a quick look and with a little
 jump you land safely on the countertop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countertop</span>
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place.  It makes you feel
 powerful and important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and
 had a few cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer
 and not so narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump
 up to the metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of
 Goodcat/Badcat. He is near.

>jump on ftop


 You leap up to the top with the greatest of ease.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Refrigerator Top</span>
 On top of this cold metal cube, you find what you've been expecting
 the whole time: Goodcat/Badcat. He is a refined grey cat with black
 stripes who sits with his body perpendicular to yours, his head facing
 you. He has two large yellow eyes and seems unaffected by your
 arrival, as though he had been expecting you.

 You can see Goodcat/Badcat here.

>give sock to cat


 Goodcat/Badcat sniffs the air and then sniffs the sock, taking his
 time to inhale all of its scents. He looks thoughtful for a moment and
 then rubs you, pressing into your fur one of his secrets. Fascinated,
 you ponder all the fun you'll have when you chew off a piece of
 meat-bread and leave it behind the vibrating box for twenty suns so
 that you too can have a smelly play toy!

 With a mew of disgust, you sit down and clean the nasty dirt from all
 your paws. It takes you some time, but at last you're clean.

 narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump up to the
 metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of Goodcat/Badcat.

 You span the distance with a soft jump and skid to a stop on the

>hit phone


 You rear up and pounce the phone with a particularly vicious
 sideswipe. Result: the phone is now separated into two parts, the
 curvy part and the boxy part. They are joined by a cord. None of this
 seems particularly interesting in itself, but you do derive some
 satisfaction in observing the prey after it has been rendered
 helpless.

 An artificial voice from the phone repeats itself with strange quiet
 parts between.

 across it. A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed, but it is so

 wide cloth bed. Far away is a mow through which you can see the
 outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish. In the
 dirt scattered around the plant, you see several small paw prints. You
 grimace. Why did He put that nasty thing there? Near the plant there
 is a large black shiny square and a frozen bug on top of it, and
 beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by some kind of
 stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that makes you
 feel relaxed and at home.

>jump on seat


 You jump on the smaller springy-soft bed (this is a "love seat") and
 luxuriate in how it feels on your paws. You sniff around. There are
 several stories here, but they are simple ones. This place is one of
 Goodcat/Badcat's favorites. He was here earlier in the day and was
 feeling gassy. He thinks he shouldn't have eaten that crunchy thing he
 found under the tall vibrating box. There is the scent left by His
 littermate; She was visiting yesterday and was concerned that He had
 no offspring. She seems to think that He is too immature. You
 immediately think ill of her and want to show Her that He does have
 offspring -- you!

>bat globe


 You bat at it and the ball turns, making a curious whirring sound. You
 bat at it again and it moves a little faster. You go at it with both
 paws until it can't move any faster and then you get bored. You look
 at the ball sideways, catching your breath and wonder if He will
 notice that the ball is now in a different position than it was
 before.

>jump on sofa


 You jump up on the large springy-soft bed (what they call a "sofa")
 and love how it feels on your paws -- so soft! You sniff around and
 are startled by all the big cats that have sat here and their stories.
 It takes you several sniffs to make them all out. Apparently He sits
 here when he is tired; He sat here yesterday. He also sat here two
 days ago (the day of the big noise) with Barry, and they talked about
 far-away places. Barry wants to romance his broodmate, but won't tell
 Him. Then there is the scent of an older big cat, who must be very
 wise, because he gives knowledge to others all day. He seems to be
 related to Him, but you're not clear how. He's not a mother or a
 littermate.

 large shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally
 large things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square
 water bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads to your left, but to your
 right is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor the
 brown table towers over you. The guest chair sits underneath it, and
 His chair is nearby.

>jump on his chair


 You agilely leap upwards into the chair.

 You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby.

>jump on table


 You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
 surface.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brown Table</span>
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now.

 You can see a phone and a remote here.

>bat remote


 Surprisingly, it's not very heavy. You bat it back and forth and with
 a powerful swipe, you send it off the table and it hits the floor
 below with a loud "smack". Then, in the next room over, the big black
 square flickers to life. You hear sounds and people talking; images
 flicker back and forth across its surface. From up above,
 Goodcat/Badcat meows despairingly. "Oh dear. Now you've done it," he
 says.

 The black square lets out someone who is talking but in a very flowing
 kind of way and high up enough that it catches your attention. Then
 you realize she isn't saying anything important.

 curvy part with your paw and send it flying. The ringing stops! But
 then you hear a concerned female voice talking out of it. It's saying

 This is a comfortable room that also has strange things in it. The
 carpet gets very thick and comfortable in the middle of the room and
 it changes colors too. It even has tiny decorative brown paw prints
 across it. A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed, but it is so
 large that it must be for Him) touches the hall and beyond it is a
 wide cloth bed. Far away is a mow through which you can see the
 outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish. In the
 dirt scattered around the plant, you see several small paw prints. You
 grimace. Why did He put that nasty thing there? Near the plant there
 is a black square flashing with images and voices and a frozen bug on
 top of it, and beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by
 some kind of stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that
 makes you feel relaxed and at home.

>examine tv


 It's a large black square, although it's pretty shiny. It flickers
 with all kinds of images, some of which are people doing things; it
 also talks with the voices of various people. You're not at all sure
 how the different people fit inside there. The voices just keep
 talking like you aren't there and the images don't seem to be related.
 It's too overpowering to be real and after a minute or two, you lose
 interest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gated Hall</span>
 The hall from in front of you ends here at a soft ow about half as
 tall as an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can
 see through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than
 Him, on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat
 has left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">New Hall</span>
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out in front of you and behind you taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to
 investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild
 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

 You smell nothing particularly interesting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Hall</span>
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the
 bottom, like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful
 fresh smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only
 there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the
 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the
 window on the far side of the room. Shadows and light play across the
 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

>examine short


 This is shortest box. It is held closed by a brown stripe, and you can
 easily jump up to it from the floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 The hallway light provides the only light in this dark room. Your eyes
 adjust and your nose comes alive with the many different scents
 inside. The first smell smells like He does sometimes -- like growing
 things, like the outside. It's too strong for you and it causes your
 nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next strongest smell is a fresh,
 clean smell that must be some kind of water. You know by the third
 smell that this is His place, because He has marked it. Mixed in with
 that territorial odor are lesser notes that smell like all sorts of
 yummy things. You're so glad he marked the area so you'd know where
 they are! It's odd, though. You look around but don't see a litterbox
 anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see the tub. It has sides so you can
 jump up on it and take look inside. It smells like that water smell.
 Opposite it is a giant white chair that is hollow in the middle, where
 the territorial smell and the yummy smells come from. You could jump
 up on it, too. Right beside you are wooden boxes, and on top of them
 is a tall dark window.

 You see your reflection peeking down at you from the window, green
 eyes glowing in the dark.

 just in time to avoid him jumping on you. Fear and adrenaline ran
 through your veins and you jumped, jumped, and ran like your tail was

>jump down


 You lean down the side and take a half-jump the rest of the way down.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countertop</span>
 From up here, you can see the entire shiny place. Only the
 refrigerator top gives a better view. It makes you feel powerful and
 important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and had a few
 cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer and not so
 narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump up to the
 metal box. The most distinctive smell is the scent of Goodcat/Badcat.
 He is near.

 The black square lets out someone who is talking but in a very flowing
 kind of way and high up enough that it catches your attention. Then
 you realize she isn't saying anything important.

>jump on table


 You span the distance with a soft jump and skid to a stop on the
 table.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brown Table</span>
 This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
 as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
 definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
 tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
 things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
 could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
 room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
 and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
 used for eating food, but there is no food here now.

 You can see a phone here.

 The black square lets out someone who is talking but in a very flowing
 kind of way and high up enough that it catches your attention. Then
 you realize she isn't saying anything important.

>jump down


 After a few moments of weightless falling and the rude impact, you are
 once again walking around on the shiny floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can
 skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box
 is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell
 like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a
 fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this
 is indoors.

 Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a
 pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's
 wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor the
 brown table towers over you. The guest chair sits underneath it, and
 His chair is nearby.

 You can see a remote here.

 You hear the sound of a cat scratching itself and know that it must be
 Goodcat/Badcat.

 From the black square you hear lots of people shouting and catch a
 flicker of images out of the corner of your eye.

>bat remote


 You bat the remote and send it flying across the floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Edge of Kitchen</span>
 Just behind you, the shiny and slippery floor begins and the large
 shiny things sit. The opposite way, you see softer but equally large
 things, but also a plant that sits in what looks like a square water
 bowl. The carpet is soft and it leads to your right, but to your left
 is the stringy ow that you'll have to climb to get over.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress to your left.

 You hear several different scary sounds and then people talking,
 seriously.

>climb gate


 You clamber over the gate again, quickly, but not silently.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gated Hall</span>
 The hall from in front of you ends here at a soft ow about half as
 tall as an ordinary ow. This ow is made of crossed strings and you can
 see through it; beyond are shiny tall metal boxes, almost taller than
 Him, on a shiny floor. You instinctively sniff the ow. Goodcat/Badcat
 has left a scent message that welcomes you to his world if you can get
 over the ow. He calls it something rather impolite.

 The tall stringy gate bars progress behind you.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">New Hall</span>
 This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were
 stretched out in front of you and behind you taller than He is. The
 scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of
 them did. The ows are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest
 of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in
 your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to
 investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild
 smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>examine floor


 It smells wild -- images sweep over you of Him, others like Him, a
 world filled with flying things and grass, clean scents and many
 others that you've never smelled before. Faintly, you also detect a
 sweet yet salty wild smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Hall</span>
 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the
 bottom, like what is on the window in your place. It has a wonderful
 fresh smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only
 there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the
 opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from
 between it and the floor. You would know it anywhere -- it is Him. He
 is not here, but beyond is surely His lair.

>push slatted


 It's much too large and heavy for you to move it.

>bat slatted


 You try for a few moments, but don't make any appreciable impact.

>bat slats


 You try for a few moments, but don't make any appreciable impact.

>examine slats


 It is a mow, but you're not sure how He moves it, because there is no
 blob of metal halfway up. It's not solid, like other mows are, and you
 can see fluffy colored things beyond; an almost-dizzying sleepy fresh
 smell comes from beyond it.

>examine fluffy things


 You don't see any such thing here.

>f



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End Hall</span>
 The long room ends here at an ow with one room on either side. The one
 to your right has sun filtering in through slats that make you want to
 rest in its warm spaces and play with the shadows. The room to your
 left is dark and presents several different smells relating to water.
 The ows seem really tall here and you feel fenced in and nervous.

>examine slats


 You don't see any such thing here.

>r



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sun Room</span>
 The air is warm here, and light spills in across the room from the
 window on the far side of the room. Shadows and light play across the
 floor in hypnotizing patterns, threatening to lull you to sleep.
 Scattered across the room are brown boxes, arranged in no particular
 order, some of which are very tall. You get the feeling that the boxes
 were just moved here and that the room wasn't built too long ago: the
 whole place smells new.

 You can see a short box, a tall box and a towering box here.

>bat boxes


 Choose a particular box.

>bat short


 You bat it but nothing amazing happens.

 You can go behind you or out to leave the room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 The hallway light provides the only light in this dark room. Your eyes
 adjust and your nose comes alive with the many different scents
 inside. The first smell smells like He does sometimes -- like growing
 things, like the outside. It's too strong for you and it causes your
 nose to wrinkle involuntarily. The next strongest smell is a fresh,
 clean smell that must be some kind of water. You know by the third
 smell that this is His place, because He has marked it. Mixed in with
 that territorial odor are lesser notes that smell like all sorts of
 yummy things. You're so glad he marked the area so you'd know where
 they are! It's odd, though. You look around but don't see a litterbox
 anywhere.

 Instead, off to the right you see the tub. It has sides so you can
 jump up on it and take look inside. It smells like that water smell.
 Opposite it is a giant white chair that is hollow in the middle, where
 the territorial smell and the yummy smells come from. You could jump
 up on it, too. Right beside you are wooden boxes, and on top of them
 is a tall dark window.

 You see your reflection peeking down at you from the window, green
 eyes glowing in the dark.

>jump on toilet


 (the toilet)
 With feline agility, you leap up to the hollow chair.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Toilet Rim</span>
 You are halfway between the dark window and the floor, perched on the
 white chair. It's not soft, but it is fairly slick. The wonderful
 smells rise up from the hollow center, down in the water. You see
 above you a wide ledge that runs underneath the window. You could
 easily jump to it, or jump down to the bathroom floor.

>bat ledge


 You bat it but nothing amazing happens.

>jump in toilet


 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump inside.

>enter toilet


 (the toilet)
 Jumping to it is much more kittenish.

>jump on ledge


 With amazing grace, you land on the space above the handles with a
 solid "whump".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom Counter</span>
 The surface here is smooth and there is a bowl in the middle called a
 sink. You know this because the scent of his hands have left the word
 around it. The sink smells like his breath and some sort of plant. On
 the far side is a cabinet without a handle. You don't know how he gets
 it open. In the dark window that takes up the whole wall is your
 reflection, doing whatever you do but in reverse.

>examine sink


 It's a bowl that's part of the ledge. It's damp, empty, and smells of
 his breath and some sort of fresh plant.

>examine cabinet


 (the bccabinet)
 You see nothing special about the bccabinet.

>open it


 That's not something you can open.

>examine mirror


 You look in the window, but see nothing interesting besides your
 reflection. The mirror itself smells faintly acidic.
>bat reflection


 You're quite through with playing with your reflection.

>bat sink


 You bat it but nothing amazing happens.

>enter sink


 You squinch up your eyes. You could fit in there, but there's a silver
 thing going over the top that you just don't trust.

>examine silver


 You don't see any such thing here.

>examine silver thing

 You jump down to the tiled floor below with matchless ease.

 You turn to face to your right and bound away.

 Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tiled Door</span>
 The carpet ends here at a mow like the one that leads out of your
 place. You're not sure how He manages to open these things, but He
 must be strong. This mow looks a lot like the shiny floor, actually;
 it looks like it is made up of different tiles, all different colors.
 Sniffing the edges, you realize that it is a gateway to the outside.
 Images of grass, bright sunshine, concern, danger, and burden roll
 over you and you think that the outside is a fearful but wonderful
 place, and amazingly large. You smell Her scent again, like flowers
 but far too strong. It fills you with a fierce passion; she should
 know that you live here!

 From the black square you hear lots of people shouting and catch a
 flicker of images out of the corner of your eye.

 back?

 You hear a mow open from far away and then hear it shut; His voice is
 next, as He greets Goodcat/Badcat. You meow energetically to let him

 He discovers you and picks you up. He strokes kindly you as He walks
 through the house, laughing at all the things you have done. He seems
 quite surprised at the TV being on. "You are quite the little
 explorer, aren't you?" he asks. You purr. "That effort deserves
 nothing less than a name!" He holds you high in the air and then
 triumphantly christens you, "Isabella. Yes, Isabella is your name."
 You nuzzle your face into his arms, turning the name around and around
 in your mind. Isabella. It's a good name, well, as good as humans get
 at these things, you think. You beam up at Him as He carries you.
