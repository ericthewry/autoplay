 An interactive exploration by Hanon Ondricek
 Release 1 / Serial number 140928 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Entrance</span>
 You park the van at the location at the end of the GPS arrow and shut
 off the ignition.  This must be the place.  There's nothing else like
 it around for miles.

 You slide your way down from the warmth of the driver's seat and slam
 the door, shrugging your coat around you securely against the chill of
 the late afternoon sunset.

 Nothing but the highest bluish-gray roof tiles of the Thorne estate
 peers at the outside world above the overgrowth of trees surrounding
 the manor.  Also, a ten-foot wall of roughly-mortared red bricks
 topped with ornamental iron spikes surrounds the property,
 establishing the border in castle-like fashion.

 Two square brick columns border the entryway, each topped with a
 wrought-iron gaslight cage, taking up area about the size of a phone
 booth on each side and spaced far enough apart that a double-hitched
 carriage could be driven through into the courtyard.

 A sturdily-arched wooden gate (a recent addition to replace the
 original rickety iron and discourage scofflaws from invading the
 property and wrecking the place) enters the property to the north.

 Your van is parked here in the closest parking space.

>examine me

 As a photographer, you're not accustomed to focusing your eye inward.
 You look attractive enough in your standard bio picture taken in a
 mirror with your face mostly concealed by your old giant 35mm and its
 flash.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a property key
   your coat (being worn)

>examine key

 (the property key)
 It's a flat, mass-produced door key that unlocks the outer gate.  You
 were given this in case the second unit crew finished up and split
 before you got there.  You had to make the two-hour drive up from the
 small wedding that kept you away for most of today.

>examine house

 Okay, so if you drew it out on paper from above: the brick wall would
 be a big square.  The covered colonnade borders the south, east, and
 west sides.  The courtyard is the center of the square.  Another
 smaller square on the upper left corner of the courtyard turned at a
 45 degree diagonal to become a diamond is the central structure of the
 house where the front door is, and wings of the house form a right
 angle from that on the northern and western sides of the big square.

 Outside the colonnade but connecting through it on the east if you
 drove through the colonnade from the south and turned right through it
 again is a stable building.  If you turned left from the courtyard,
 you'd drive through the colonnade and under the west wing into what
 was purportedly another stable converted more recently into a garage
 hidden behind the manor.

 You were late to the briefing where they tape the host that doesn't
 actually come on set. You aren't actually in the shots as the host
 points out rooms with the highest <span class="floydstyle em">hotspot</span> activity, but you
 do remember the blueprints on a whiteboard.

>examine coat

 (your coat)
 It's very warm and comfortable wool with a handy pocket you used to
 keep full of extra film.

>examine pocket

 In the coat pocket are some van keys.

>examine van keys

 Two of the same key to the van.  The production company let you drive
 it to the wedding today because you're so awesome.

>enter van

 (your van)
 Are you ready to leave?
>no
 Are you ready to leave?


 You give the van a reassuring pat, knowing it will be here later.

>pat van

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>dance

 You bell-kick for a brief moment.

>xyzzy

 A hollow voice says, "Fool..."

>look

>examine bricks

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine f x spikes

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine spikes

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine gate

 It's much newer than the rest of the property.  Only one slightly
 angular graffiti tag mars the boards.

>examine tag

 It says <span class="floydstyle em">suck S</span> in angular white spray paint strokes.

>suck S

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>open gate

 You open the wooden gate.

>enter

 You step through the gate, realizing that you don't have your camera
 with you.  You can always make clicky shutter noises with your mouth
 and mime taking pictures, you suppose.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Peristyle</span>
 Just inside the manor property, you find yourself sheltered by the
 roof over the southern colonnade of a peristyle that surrounds an
 overgrown courtyard on three sides.  The outer wall is closed in by
 bricks, and iron gatework prevents entry to the courtyard between the
 inner columns holding up the edge of the roof.

 The colonnade leads east and west over crooked slate tiles.

 Two square brick columns border the entryway, each topped with a
 wrought-iron gaslight cage, taking up area about the size of a phone
 booth on each side and spaced far enough apart that a double-hitched
 carriage could be driven through into the courtyard.

 The gate leading back outside to your van stands to the south.

 The huge, wrought-iron gates that would lead north into the courtyard
 are overgrown by vines the size of a man's arm, which have lifted them
 crooked slightly off their hinges.

 A folksy, jigsawed sign points east, which is to your right.

>examine sign

 The sign is white letters on a blue background in a style you'd call
 "theme park saloon".  Most of the paint is flaking off.  In defiance
 of the elements, it still legibly reads <span class="floydstyle em">House Tour Entrance</span>.
 Then there's a circle like a clock face, declaring <span class="floydstyle em">Next</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Tour...</span>
 It looks as if there used to be hands that could be set to indicate
 tour times, but they're not anywhere to be seen.  You guess that no
 tours are scheduled today.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pergola</span>
 The colonnade here turns a corner to the left under a stone pergola
 with domed roof held up by columns.  From here, through the bars to
 the northwest, the manor is framed from the front perfectly,
 architecturally symmetrical on both sides if not for the uneven
 pattern of vines climbing the walls.

 The front entrance to the property is west, and visitors entering the
 tour would be shepherded into the stable building by low fences
 through the dim archway to the north.

 You can see a domed roof here.

>examine van

 (your van)
 Though you'd rather drive something a little flashier, it comes in
 useful for hauling equipment to your photography gigs.  As soon as
 you're done here, you plan to get in this vehicle with your equipment,
 drive home, and go to sleep.  You'll show your pictures to Morgan
 tomorrow, and then you can take some time off.

>open van

 (your van)
 You open your van, revealing your equipment bag.

>take bag

 Taken.

>examine bag

 Built for your specific type of camera, the bag costs almost as much
 as one of the lenses.

>examine camera

 You can't see any such thing.

>open bag

 You open your equipment bag, revealing your camera, a spare battery
 and a charger.

>examine camera

 It's a dazzling piece of equipment you acquired a month ago that takes
 stunning digital photos without film.  There is a screen which allows
 you to REVIEW specific captured images instantly.  Besides looking at
 the screen, you've learned SHOOT (SOMETHING) and RECALL (SOMETHING)
 are the most  efficient, although sometimes you go old-school and
 PHOTOGRAPH (SOMETHING).  In a pinch, TAKE PICTURE OF (SOMETHING) will
 do if you're not concerned about clumsy.

 The kids these days like to call a photographic image a PIC but
 everyone likes to experiment.  There is a compartment that holds a
 rechargable battery.  There is smart flash that only fires when it's
 too dark for a picture (although you swear it eats the battery).  And
 finally, there is a handy strap so you can wear it around your neck.

>examine wear camera

 You can't see any such thing.

>wear camera

 (first taking your camera)
 You're carrying too many things already.

>examine strap

 You see nothing special about the strap.

>drop bag

 Dropped.

 The sun touches the horizon, casting some amazing golden hour pink
 light on the structure of the mansion.

>wear camera

 (first taking your camera)
 You loop the camera strap over your head and let it hang.

>take all

 spare battery: Taken.
 main battery: You're carrying too many things already.
 your equipment bag: You're carrying too many things already.
 charger: You're carrying too many things already.
 van keys: You're carrying too many things already.

>put keys in pocket

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>lock van with van key

 (your van with the van keys)
 (first taking the van keys)
 You drove for at least ten miles without seeing a car, and it's a good
 quarter mile drive to the estate entrance.  Nobody is coming up here
 to gank your travel mug.  The van will be safe here.

 The sun sinks below the horizon, sending the sky to indigo with a
 black tatter of cloud nudging a three-quarter moon.

 through the dim archway to the north.

 You can see a domed roof here.

>examine bars

 A fence of spiked iron bars surrounds the courtyard everywhere between
 the supporting columns of the peristyle.

>examine dome

 The interior of the roof dome over the pergola contains a rotting wood
 lattice which supports some still-living white roses.

>examine roses

 They must have been meant to grow here, and with the rampant
 overgrowth are maintaining themselves in the pergola.

>take roses

 You reach up and pluck a beautiful bloom.  You're about to bring it to
 your nose to inhale the scent when you hear a scuttling sound.  You
 hurl the flower away the moment you see a glossy black spider emerge
 from inside.  You shudder and brush your hands off, suddenly feeling
 like you have cobwebs all over your skin.

>examine spider

 You can't see any such thing.

>take rose

 Hell, no.

>examine vines

 The courtyard has pretty much overgrown itself and part of front of
 the house between the stone columns and onto the roof.  Vines, and
 branches and brambles and leaves tangle in attempt to retake the
 architecture.

>examine lattice

 The interior of the roof dome over the pergola contains a rotting wood
 lattice which supports some still-living white roses.

 You notice an upper story window with light glowing behind it.  As
 immediately as you notice, the light turns off.   The second unit crew
 must still be here.  You wonder what alternate location they found for
 their van.  Probably closer to the actual front door than you parked.

>examine fences

 A fence of spiked iron bars surrounds the courtyard everywhere between
 the supporting columns of the peristyle.

>examine columns

 Stone columns hold up the peristyle roof on the inner courtyard side.
 The outer side is a brick wall that holds up the roof with spaced
 short columns to leave a gap.  Tall columns also hold up the roof over
 the walkways along the front wings of the house.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Visitor Entrance</span>
 The front half of the barn has been modernized with track lighting and
 an information and ticket counter.  In the past, visitors would pay to
 take a tour and then assemble in the stable to the north.  The way out
 of the visitor center is to the south.

 You notice a framed map behind the counter.

 A squiggle of 1980s track lighting and some ceiling fans are suspended
 above from the rafters in an attempt to brighten and modernize the
 Visitor Entrance.

 A W-shaped information desk is positioned in the corner.

>examine map

 It's mounted on the wall behind the counter so it's difficult to see
 any detail.

 You hear a phone ringing in here somewhere.  Behind the counter most
 likely.

>answer phone

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine counter

 The surface is worn in a couple places.

 On the blue formica countertop is a tours cancelled sign.

 An answering machine picks up:  <span class="floydstyle em">You have reached the offices of</span>

>examine desk

 It's a dark blue formica counter with a heavy base of light wood.  A

 Since the ends of the W-shaped desk has been shoved against a wall,
 you have to climb over it to check out the other side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ticket Counter</span>
 You are inside the W-shaped ticket counter in the visitor's entrance.

 Several weathered informational posters are affixed to the walls of
 the stable.

>examine posters

 The only one where the paper has not blistered and faded too much to
 be readable says "DID YOU KNOW - The vertical wooden dowels on a

 running along the entire wing of the house bordering the north edge of
 the courtyard.  There is also a narrow opening to the east leading to
 a hidden garden, and the stables are to the south.

 A chirping riot of crickets sings from everywhere in the courtyard.

>examine crickets

 Crickets are very <span class="floydstyle em">elusive</span>.  You can hear them more readily
 than see them.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hidden Statue Garden</span>
 This ruined, jungly garden was probably once a nice place to sip tea
 in the afternoon.  Now it's overgrown and contains very little space
 as weeds and vines have taken over, filling most of the space.
 Several stone tableaux and statues tilt at various angle knee-deep in
 the vegetation.  The only way out is back to the west.

 You can see a sundial, Jack and Jill, Little Miss Muffet and Little Bo
 Peep here.

>examine sundial

 It's toppled over.  There shall be no solar timekeeping to-day.

>fix sundial

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine jack

 A stone tableau of a well on a hill and two doomed aquarian thieves.

>examine peep

 Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep, and - newsflash:  She is apparently
 also seeking her missing head.

>examine muffet

 You guess it's a statue of Little Miss Muffet from the the curds and
 the whey and the horrified expression and the dais she sits on which
 is carved like a spiderweb.  You don't see the spider though.

>get sundial

 The sundial is made of stone and probably weighs several hundred
 pounds.  I mean, you work out, but that's a little hardcore.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Elevated Window Passage</span>
 This high walkway extends the length of the entire east wing of the

 statues stand out of the way of passers-by opposite columns choked
 with thick vines and foliage spilling off of the roof that mostly
 blocks the view of the courtyard.  The manor entryway is west, and and
 the tile walkway eventually drops off down a set of stone steps to the
 east.

 Marble statues reside in recessed niches between four windows along
 the front of the house: a soldier, a male statue and a female statue.

>examine soldier

 The middle statue is an upright, uniformed soldier with a flat cap and
 a bayonet resting on his shoulder.  He looks out over the courtyard
 with a blank stare.

>examine male

 A nude male statue in a walking pose is in the niche on the left.  The
 physique is flawless and all the parts are there save for his head.

>examine female

 A graceful nude female statue occupies the niche to the right of the
 soldier.  Unlike Venus de Milo, she has arms, but is unfortunately
 also headless.

>examine vines

 The courtyard has pretty much overgrown itself and part of front of
 the house between the stone columns and onto the roof.  Vines, and
 branches and brambles and leaves tangle in attempt to retake the
 architecture.

>examine windows

 Tall, curtained windows, each with six or eight panes of glass
 interrupt the stone faces of the house at intervals along the north
 and west wings on the second and third stories.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entryway</span>
 On a regular-sized house, this would be the front porch.  At this
 grand scale, the mosaic tile expanse is sheltered by a roof
 two-stories above you (technically the third story of the house) and a
 false front wall to the southeast containing the enormous wooden
 batwing doors that are visible from the courtyard and would, if
 opened, allow access to the stairs leading down into it.  Above the
 front door is an expansive (for its time) grid of leaded glass panes
 which would allow some light from the round window above the false
 front to pass to the interior.

 Second floor walkways lead out of the porch structure to the east and
 west before some tall curtained windows.

 The dark front doors to the manor lead in to the northwest.

 A doorbell is mounted to the left side of the front door.

 walkway turns to the right where it leads under the shelter of the
 roof between the false front entryway of the house and the actual
 front door.

 A somewhat more recently built access ramp of bleached, deckweathered
 gray boards ambles at a shallow grade up to the level of the second

 makes sense they didn't even bother to put in a working gate when they

 down at you from the side walls, hung on flocked green wallpaper with
 wainscotting at the bottom.

 The high-angle, bluish-bright moonlight through the windows over the

 Even though the hallway is pretty wide, it's hard to examine an
 individtual portrait straight on without standing right in front of
 it.

 The closet door squeals enthusiastically.  Wow.  So it's going to be
 one of those de rigueur creaking door gigs.  You wonder if every
 similarly creaky door in this place could use an similarly identical
 squirt of oil.  You can imagine that Aaron guy on second unit was here
 earlier with the handheld digital recorder opening and closing the
 closet door for at least thirty minutes.

 You open the closet door, revealing a scribbled note, a tiny plastic
 flashlight and a script.

 PARANORMAL INVESTIGATIONS - Ep. 304 - Thorne Manor

 STOCK SHOT - FLYING OVER TREES

 NARRATOR: Deep in the overgrown woods, far from any marked road, and
 nowhere near human habitation is a place.  You won't find it on any
 satellite photos, nor on any printed maps.  The community of Evermoor
 is a small scenic suburb near the ocean.  But if you ask them about
 the old Thorne Estate, chances are they visited as a child, or know
 the legend about the place.

 EXT. WIDE - CREW APPROACHING LOCATION

 Standard approach from van.

 CREW: (ad-lib conversation based on research.)

 (2ND UNIT) CAMERA: ZIPS IN ONE MOTION - HIGH SPEED FROM OPENING FRONT
 DOOR UP STAIRS

 (2ND UNIT) CLOSE ANGLE ON:  Painting of Rose (top of stairs)

 NARRATOR:  Rose Thorne.  Daughter of Jonathon and Emily Thorne.  Could
 she be the dark spectre that haunts the house?


 TREVOR: Wow, she's a babe.

  TIFFANY: Don't be disrespectful, Trevor.

  BRIANNE: According to the legend, she died a virgin.

  TREVOR: Bogus!

  TIFFANY: Trevor!

  DEVON: Hey, you guys, look over here!

 It goes on.  The usual crappy half-scripted reality investigation/true
 crime schlock, all following a very standard template.

 found this the most comfortable spot to lounge in as some of their

 charger right next to that ugly chair.  Perfect.

 The tiny flashlight flickers.

 Darkness presses in around you, and walls slide away disorientingly in

 into anything.  Your mind reels just a bit; you know you moved your
 hand, but there is no expected visual feedback.

 You remember once during a power outage in your apartment that you
 managed to use your camera as a light source in the dark.

 played in a "parlour".

 The entryway of the manor is a wide, two-story hallway that slopes
 slightly up towards the beginning of a grand staircase to the
 northwest. At least a dozen tall portraits of various ancestors peer
 down at you from the side walls, hung on flocked green wallpaper with
 wainscotting at the bottom.

 The high-angle, bluish-bright moonlight through the windows over the
 front door casts a circular spill of light with wagon-spoke shadows on
 the gallery floor that climbs partially up the narrow walls to just
 touch the bottom of the centermost paintings.

 The front door is to the southeast.

 A narrow door like a coat closet is partially concealed by a drapery
 near the front door.

 A modern plastic light switch is tucked subtly into a corner, blending
 in under the wallpaper.

>switch switch

 You switch the foyer light switch on.

 often where younger boys and girls could entertain themselves away

 played in a "parlour".

 PARANORMAL INVESTIGATIONS - Ep. 304 - Thorne Manor

 STOCK SHOT - FLYING OVER TREES

 NARRATOR: Deep in the overgrown woods, far from any marked road, and
 nowhere near human habitation is a place.  You won't find it on any
 satellite photos, nor on any printed maps.  The community of Evermoor
 is a small scenic suburb near the ocean.  But if you ask them about
 the old Thorne Estate, chances are they visited as a child, or know
 the legend about the place.

 EXT. WIDE - CREW APPROACHING LOCATION

 Standard approach from van.

 CREW: (ad-lib conversation based on research.)

 (2ND UNIT) CAMERA: ZIPS IN ONE MOTION - HIGH SPEED FROM OPENING FRONT
 DOOR UP STAIRS

 (2ND UNIT) CLOSE ANGLE ON:  Painting of Rose (top of stairs)

 NARRATOR:  Rose Thorne.  Daughter of Jonathon and Emily Thorne.  Could
 she be the dark spectre that haunts the house?


 TREVOR: Wow, she's a babe.

  TIFFANY: Don't be disrespectful, Trevor.

  BRIANNE: According to the legend, she died a virgin.

  TREVOR: Bogus!

  TIFFANY: Trevor!

  DEVON: Hey, you guys, look over here!

 There's more, but you don't care to read it all.

 unintelligibly about microphones and clunking things around.  Then,

 have eventually if they saved the file of it.

 silhouette at the end of a ghostly green hallway aiming a flashlight
 at the viewer, causing a smoky lens-flare and the words "Paranormal
 Investigations" to appear in crunky shadow letters (this is animated
 in the actual show).  In the foreground gloom of the hallway closest
 to the edges,  various wisps and tentacles and creatures on the walls,
 floor, and ceiling squirm and slither and skitter, closing in with a
 menacing sense of purpose toward the interloper in the background.

 You carefully feel for each rickety stair with your foot...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cellar</span>
 The crumbling brick walls of the cellar press in and down, holding up
 coal-blackened floor joists criscrossed with wire that doesn't quite
 look up to code.  Part of the floor is severely cracked and uneven
 cement, and the rest is bare dirt.  Thousands of crickets have
 therefore taken up residence, and occasionally out of the corner of
 your eye you notice a tiny brown body pinging into the air when it
 thinks you're not looking.

 A metal pole directly at the bottom of the stairs has a fusebox
 mounted on it.

 A portrait whose frame is smashed in pieces lies partially against one
 wall.

 You can also see a male statue and a bare bulb (providing light) here.

 This portrait of a heavily jowled man is either stashed down here

 Frederick Hately-Bowles, you presume, Rose's second fiancee, likely
 died before his portrait was finished.

 You presume the outer ones on the left and the right are the parents
 of the younger male in the center who you recognize from the episode

 ballroom.  A raised glass ceiling lit from within, a recessed and

 floor-to-ceiling gilt mirrors along with tall windows and permanently
 open glass doors leading to the conservatory to the north make this

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bottom of Stairs</span>
 The grand staircase sweeps up to northwest from here, presided over by
 a large portrait of a woman prominently displayed on the opposite wall
 at the top.  The front door can be accessed through the gallery to the
 southeast, and corridors to each respective wing of the house lead
 south and east.

 A chandelier hovers subtly above, high enough to light the two story
 chamber.

 The high-angle, bluish-bright moonlight through the windows over the
 front door casts a circular spill of light with wagon-spoke shadows on
 the gallery floor that climbs partially up the narrow walls to just
 touch the bottom of the centermost paintings.

 You climb the stairs, gliding your fingers up the smooth bannister
 rail.

 staircase.

 There's an electrical outlet on the wall here that your charger is
 currently plugged into.

 You can also see an ugly chair (on which is a charger (empty)), a
 fancy writing desk (on which is a computer) and an antique table lamp
 (providing light) here.

>take main battery

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine charger

 This is a portable camera battery charger that can charge both
 batteries at the same time.  A small red light glows happily,
 indicating it is powered.
