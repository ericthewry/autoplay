 Unbelievable.  This could very well be it.  The big score.

 Every scavenger dreams of that one discovery that will grant riches
 beyond the dreams of avarice.  Every scavenger envisions walking into
 the hidden chamber of some pre-war military compound or corporate R&D
 facility and finding the forgotten secrets of humanity's genius.  Of
 course, you can count the number of times it's happened on one hand.
 While everyone in your line of work wishes for it, no one really
 expects it to happen.  That included you.

 Until you found the scrap of paper, that is.

 Howe Street, Arcadia
 The few street lights that still work on this run down section of road
 do little to dispel the everpresent gloom of the city.  Even in the
 middle of the day the sun is barely more than a faint glow in the thick
 clouds above.  The street itself is ancient crumbling asphalt; they
 simply don't maintain the roads this far from the city core.  This one
 heads north, back towards your meager home, and south, out of the city.
 A cross street leads east towards CyTek Corporation's main compound,
 and a small merchant shop you know well sits among derelict buildings
 to the west.

 Welcome to the main help menu!  This menu contains what we hope is
 useful information on playing interactive fiction.  There are several
 sections of assistance available.

 Another special feature that the game supports on many computer systems
 is called "review mode."  The game remembers text as it "scrolls" off
 the screen; by invoking recall mode, you can go back and look at text
 that is no longer visible on the screen.  On most systems, review mode
 is activated by pressing the PAGE UP key.

 Once in review mode, the status line that is normally at the top of the
 screen will be replaced by the review mode help line.  This line shows
 the keystrokes you use to view previous screenfuls of text, and also
 shows you the key that exits review mode and resumes normal game play
 (this is generally the game key that you used to activate review mode).

 While in review mode, your screen becomes a window onto the text that
 the game has stored away.  When you first activate review mode, you are
 looking at the very bottom of this text, which is the screenful of text
 that was just displayed.  Use the up and down cursor-arrow keys to move
 the window up and down.  Pressing the up cursor-arrow key moves the
 window up one line, showing you one line of text that has scrolled off
 the screen.  Most systems also provide keys to move up and down by a
 full screenful (also called a "page.")

 To resume game play, press the same key that you used to activate
 review mode.

 The number of screenfuls of text that the game stores away for review
 depends on how much text is actually on each screen, since the game has
 a limit on the number of characters it can store, not on the number of
 lines.  Normally, more than twenty of the most recent screens of text
 are saved and available for review at any given time.

 The game understands several special commands that you can use to
 control the game.  You can use these commands at any prompt.

    About the game

 ABOUT:  Displays whatever information the author thought necessary to
 give about the game, such as its history, influences, what the author
 was wearing when he/she wrote it, etc.

 CREDITS:  Show a list of the people that developed this game.

 HELP:  You're looking at it.

 HINT:  Some games will include an automated hint system to help guide
 you through the trickier parts.

 VERSION:  Shows you the current version of the game.

    Command related

 AGAIN or G:  Repeats your last command.  If your last input line was
 composed of several commands, only the last command on the line is
 repeated.

 OOPS:  Allows you to correct the spelling of a word in the last
 command.  You can use OOPS when the game displays this complaint:  "I
 type OOPS followed by the corrected spelling of the misspelled word.
 You can only type one word after OOPS, so this command doesn't allow
 you to correct certain types of errors, such as when you run two words
 together without a space.

 UNDO:  Take back the last command.  This can be used multiple times to
 take back a series of commands in sequence.  The number of commands
 that you can undo at any given time varies, but you can generally undo
 over a hundred commands.

 WAIT or Z:  Causes game time to pass.  When the game is waiting for you
 to type command, no game time passes; you can use this command to wait
 for something to happen.

    In-game information

 DIAGNOSE:  Displays information about your player character's health.

 INVENTORY or I:  Shows the list of items your player character is
 carrying.

 LOOK or L:  Shows the full description of your location.

 TERSE:  Tells the game to only show the full description of a location
 the first time you enter it.  Later visits to that room will only
 display the short description.  Of course, you can get a full
 description at any time by typing LOOK.  This is the default mode for
 most games.

 VERBOSE:  Tells the game to show you the full description of a location
 every time you enter it, whether or not you have seen the description
 before.

    Score related

 SCORE:  Shows you your current score, the maximum possible score, and
 the number of turns you have taken so far.

 FULL:  Lists all of the points you've earned so far and how you earned
 them.

 NOTIFY:  Tells the game whether you want to be notified of score
 changes when they happen.  When the game starts, NOTIFY is turned on,
 so you will see a message whenever you do something that changes your
 score.  If you'd prefer not to see these messages, type NOTIFY.  (If
 you later change your mind, typing NOTIFY again will turn notification
 back on.)

    Game state control

 QUIT:  Stops the game, and returns you to your operating system.

 RESTART:  Starts the game over from the beginning.

 RESTORE:  Restores a position previously saved with the SAVE command.

 SAVE:  Stores the current state of the game in a disk file, so that you
 can come back to the same place later (with the RESTORE command).

 SCRIPT:  Starts writing everything you see on the screen (your commands
 and the game's responses) to a disk file.  The game will ask you for a
 filename to be used for the transcript; you should select a filename
 that does not yet exist on your disk, because if you use an existing
 filename, data in the file will be destroyed.  Use the UNSCRIPT command
 to stop making the transcript.

 UNSCRIPT:  Turns off the transcript being made with the SCRIPT command.

 The only pieces of the message that you've been able to make out so far

 You'd probably be able to get a little more with a highly detailed
 scan, but you don't have the necessary equipment and you simply can't
 entrust this information to anyone else.

>examine counter
 Your basic 22nd century Geiger counter, this one from Rabisi
 Corporation.  This device counts radioactive particles as they pass
 through its detector, determining the overall level of radioactivity in
 an area.  No scavenger would last long out in the wastes without one of
 these.  Like all modern Geiger counters, this one has a directional
 indicator display, alerting you to nearby dangerous levels of
 radiation.  It's currently off.

>examine pack
 This is your trusty survival pack.  You've been carrying it for years.
 Sure, the leather is worn thin in a few spots, and yeah, some of the
 seams have been re-sewn two or three times, but you just can't bring
 yourself to replace it.  It's full of the travel rations you expect to
 need on your journey.  The pack is currently closed.

>open pack
 Opening the survival pack reveals your travel rations.

>examine rations
 These are fairly typical travel rations.  They mainly consist of freeze
 dried meat, hard tack biscuits, and something claiming to be cheese (a
 dubious assertion); all individually wrapped to give them a shelf life
 of several years.  The rations are also quite tasteless, with a texture
 somewhere between cardboard and asphalt.  Still, they do keep you
 alive.  You should have all you need for your trip, and then some.

>go west
 Charlie's Shop
 It's not the selection that keeps bringing you back.  It's just the
 convenient location.  Plus you and Charlie have known each other for a
 few years now so he gives you a bit of a discount.  He can usually be
 counted on to have what you need.  The store itself is fairly small,
 just a single room.  Charlie leans against a glass countertop that
 doubles as a display case, flipping through one of the Arcadia
 newspapers with a bored expression on his face.

 The display case contains a hand grenade, a rifle, a silenced pistol,
 some radiation pills, a GPS unit, and a laser gun.

 Charlie nods in your direction.  "Welcome back."

>charlie, hello
 Charlie replies, "Guess you're stocking up on another trip out?  Well,
 take a look around.  Ain't got much this week, but still, the stuff I
 got is good."

>ask charlie about grenade
 "Nice grenade?"

 "Yeah, that's a doozy there.  M81 fragmentation grenade, complete with
 150 grams of high explosives designed to hurl hundreds of tungsten ball
 bearings in all directions.  If you throw one of these babies, you'd
 better be behind something tough or in the next county.  Price is $220
 if you want it."

 "Got any details on that GPS unit?"

 "I'm sure you've used a GPS before, right?  Got to, in your line of
 work.  Leads you to preprogrammed coordinates, and lets you save
 locations into memory.  I know the $500 price is a little steep, but
 it's hard to find working pre-war models nowadays and the corps don't
 make them as well.  This particular one is a Pathfinder model 2200."

>examine gps
 This is a GPS unit:  a hand-held device that uses the global
 positioning system from before the war.  It's accurate to within
 several yards.  Very useful to scavengers such as yourself.  You lost
 your last one in a card game.  Oops.  Cost:  $500.

>examine laser gun
 The laser gun is a bulky-looking pistol with a plastic housing of green
 and dark gray camouflage.  On top of the cylindrical barrel is a thin
 holographic sight.  The side of the gun, next to a stylized V, bears
 the text:  "Vortex Model 17".  There's a small tag attached to the grip
 with the word "SOLD!"  written on it.

>inventory
 You have a scrap of paper, a Geiger counter, a flashlight, and a
 survival pack (being worn).  The survival pack contains your travel
 rations.

 You are currently carrying $900.

>ask charlie about laser
 "Tell me about that laser."

 Charlie taps the glass of the counter above it.  "Nice, huh?  Expensive
 too.  For a pistol, anyway.  The, uh..."  he peers at the laser,
 "Vortex Model 17.  It's a pretty nice piece of hardware.  Rugged as all
 hell.  They specifically designed it as a street weapon.  Nice pop-up
 holographic sight too.  Anyway, I hate to tell you, but it's already
 sold.  Guy came in and bought it this morning.  He's coming by later
 tonight to pick it up.  Sorry."

>take laser
 You'll have to open the display case first.

>examine pills
 Anti-radiation pills.  A vital necessity for any scavenger who's
 feeling bold enough to explore radiated areas.  This packet of pills
 contains several doses, each of which will protect the user from lethal
 radiation for about 20 minutes. However, you know that the pills work
 as a preventative measure:  not a cure.  There are 12 pills left.  The
 box has a price tag of $200.

>examine rifle
 A Ruger Mini-14 semiautomatic rifle.  A pretty handy little carbine, or
 so you've heard.  Your last rifle, lost on your last trek around the
 Urktel mountains, wasn't nearly this nice.  This rifle has a price tag
 on it for $1000.

>examine silenced
 From the markings on it, it's a SIG P239 semiautomatic handgun in 9mm.
 It has a dark matte finish to it and a short cylinder attached to the
 barrel that you recognize as a silencer.  Price is listed as $300.

>ask charlie about discount
 "You gonna give me that discount, Charlie?"

 Charlie nods.  "Oh, yeah, knock off the usual five percent."

 [Your score has just gone up by 1 point.]

 You have a scrap of paper, a Geiger counter, a flashlight, and a
 survival pack (being worn).  The survival pack contains your travel
 rations.

 You are currently carrying $900.

>examine charlie
 Charlie's dressed in drab, simple clothing.  A pair of coveralls and a
 grimy yellow shirt.  There's a touch of gray in his short brown hair.
 He's currently reading up on some local events.

>look

 The display case contains a hand grenade, a rifle, a silenced pistol,
 some radiation pills, a GPS unit, and a laser gun.

>ask charlie about pills
 "Tell me about the radiation pills."

 "I'm sure you're familiar with these by now.  Each dose will give you
 about twenty minutes of protection from dangerous doses of radiation.
 Cost:  $190."

>ask charlie about gps
 "Got any details on that GPS unit?"

 "I'm sure you've used a GPS before, right?  Got to, in your line of
 work.  Leads you to preprogrammed coordinates, and lets you save
 locations into memory.  I know the $475 price is a little steep, but
 it's hard to find working pre-war models nowadays and the corps don't
 make them as well.  This particular one is a Pathfinder model 2200."

>ask charlie about pistol
 "What's this pistol?"

 Charlie nods at you.  "A SIG P239.  Nice, huh?  Good and compact.
 Holds eight 9mm rounds.  Pretty reliable too.  Nice thing about this
 one is that it comes with not only a silencer, but a set of night
 sights too.  Gonna set you back $285 if you want it."  He shrugs
 apologetically.  "It's fully loaded, but that's all the ammo for it
 I've got."

>show paper to charlie
 Which paper do you mean, the scrap of paper, or the newspaper?

>scrap
 You'd rather not.

>examine newspaper
 One of the city rags.  They're pretty much all the same, only
 difference is which corp prints it.  Charlie's arm is covering some of
 it, but most of it is visible if you want to read it.

>read newspaper
 You glance down at the paper Charlie's reading.  "The Daily Events -
 Mar.  12, 2160" it says at the top.  This is the Vortex Incorporated
 daily paper.  "Raiders Strike City Fringe" reads the main headline.
 Scanning down the page, you look at some of the other headlines:
 "Violent Criminal Ring Broken Up By Arcadian Security" "Unknown
 Assailants Infiltrate CyTek Compound" "Cowardly Assassin Kills Security
 Commissioner" The rest of the print is too small and too far away to
 read upside down.

 Which paper do you mean, the scrap of paper, or the newspaper?

 Charlie mutters, "Buy something or don't.  Just don't give me orders,
 okay?"

>ask charlie about newspaper
 You ask, "What's going on in the world?"

 Charlie mutters, "Same shit, different day."

>ask charlie about cytek
 "What do you think of the corps?"

 "Criminals," he mutters crossly.  "Everyone knows it.  They just go by
 the moniker 'corporation' to appear legitimate.  It's just organized
 crime.  The city council is just their puppet government."

>ask charlie about selling
 I don't know the word "selling".

>ask charlie about sell
 I don't understand that sentence.

>sell flashlight to charlie
 Charlie shakes his head.  "I'm not buying any new merchandise until the
 end of the month.  Sorry."

>buy gps
 (from Charlie)
 You hand over the cash to Charlie and he removes the GPS unit from the
 display case.  "Just remember, there's no warranty on that."

 [Your score has just gone up by 1 point.]

>buy newspaper

 Charlie isn't selling that.

>examine grenade
 An M81 fragmentation grenade, according to the white lettering on the
 side.  Must pack quite a punch.  It has a pin at the top holding tight
 the "spoon", or safety lever.  When the pin is pulled and the grenade
 dropped or thrown, the safety lever separates from the grenade and its
 fuse is armed.  A price tag indicates $220.

>examine pills
 Anti-radiation pills.  A vital necessity for any scavenger who's
 feeling bold enough to explore radiated areas.  This packet of pills
 contains several doses, each of which will protect the user from lethal

 clouds above.  The street itself is ancient crumbling asphalt; they
 simply don't maintain the roads this far from the city core.  This one
 heads north, back towards your meager home, and south, out of the city.
 A cross street leads east towards CyTek Corporation's main compound,
 and a small merchant shop you know well sits among derelict buildings
 to the west.

>go east
 Maybe when you have something to offer the corporation.  Until then,
 it's probably a good idea just to leave it be.

>examine gps
 This is a GPS unit:  a hand-held device that uses the global
 positioning system from before the war.  It's accurate to within
 several yards.  Very useful to scavengers such as yourself.  You lost

>turn on gps
 You won't need to use it until you begin your journey.

>begin journey
 I don't know the word "begin".

>go north
 You can't head back now; your journey is just beginning.

>go south
 South Gate
 The high cement wall of Arcadia stretches as far as you can see to the
 east and west.  Directly south of you, at the end of the street, lies
 the massive gate that leads out of the city and into the wasteland.
 This entrance stays guarded at all times; the familiar shapes of
 armor-clad Enforcers are visible in the lookout posts above and the
 squat bunkers on either side the street.  Howe Street draws a dark path
 in the opposite direction, further into the city.

>turn on geiger counter
 Okay, the Geiger counter is now switched on.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

 There are almost a dozen of the well-armed, well-armored members of the
 Arcadia Security Force.  Four are located atop the walls, inside of the
 elevated outposts.  These Enforcers, you've been told, are armed with
 powerful long-range rifles, either conventional or the new laser
 versions.  The rest of the men are manning the two squat bunkers that
 flank Howe Street as it approaches the city's south gate.  This group
 is more heavily armed, with autolasers, pulse rifles, automatic
 shotguns, and tripod-mounted machine guns.  The Enforcers here are
 tasked with keeping watch on the areas both inside and outside of the
 south gate.

 South Gate
 The high cement wall of Arcadia stretches as far as you can see to the
 east and west.  Directly south of you, at the end of the street, lies
 the massive gate that leads out of the city and into the wasteland.
 This entrance stays guarded at all times; the familiar shapes of
 armor-clad Enforcers are visible in the lookout posts above and the
 squat bunkers on either side the street.  Howe Street draws a dark path
 in the opposite direction, further into the city.

>go south

 Shifting your pack, you approach the massive gate.  As the Enforcers
 swing open the door, you take your last breath of city air for the
 foreseeable future and head out on your way.

 The journey takes you several days east of Arcadia, across the blasted
 plains of the wasteland.  It likely would have been shorter except for
 the wide detours around radioactive hot-spots exposed by your Geiger
 counter.  But finally, with the help of your global positioning system,
 you arrive at the coordinates specified on the scrap of paper.  It's
 about midnight when you arrive at...








 Clearing
 Flashlight held out as a ward against the darkness, you step through a
 break in the scrub and take a look around.  Browned vegetation
 encircles this patch of flat dusty ground.  Scraggly brush and thickets
 wave slowly in the glow of your flashlight.  The rustling of branches
 is the only sound you hear; the area seems eerily devoid of any other
 noise, even crickets.  Though you can make your way east and south,
 thorny brambles impede your movement in most other directions.  Behind
 you, the break in the scrub leads west back towards Arcadia.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

>go east
 Faded Path
 This grassy walkway winds through the thick dry underbrush and trees,
 coming in from the north and changing directions several times before
 straightening out and continuing to the southeast.  This area too is
 eerily quiet, without even the usual chirping of nocturnal insects.
 Large bushes line the path, struggling to survive in this harsh
 landscape.  To the southeast, you can make out a bright, flickering
 light from what appears to be a campfire.

 Your Geiger counter chitters quietly.

 From the direction of the campfire, you hear a man's gruff voice shout
 out, "Who's out there?  I can see your light.  I'll start shooting if
 you don't answer me!"

>man, hello
 You shout out to the distant man...  and are greeted with a hail of
 gunfire!  Bullets slam into the ground and trees around you, narrowly
 missing your fragile self.  Whoever's out there doesn't appear too
 friendly.

 Another series of gunshots erupts from the southeast.  Bullets whiz by
 you, throwing up showers of dirt and chips of bark.

 I don't know how to get on the bush.

 You hear footsteps approaching from the southeast!

 for a bright, flickering light to the southeast.

 You hear footsteps approaching from the southeast!

>hide
 It's too dark to see.

>go east
 You stumble around in the dark, and don't get anywhere.

 A scruffy-looking man enters the area, searching the area with an
 electric lantern and a large rifle.

 "Shit!"  the guard shouts as he sees you in the light of his lantern,
 bringing up his automatic rifle and firing in your direction.  The
 bullets tear through you and you're dead before you hit the ground.

 an unkempt man carrying a large rifle.  Without a word he fires.  The
 world spins and goes dark.

 Faded Path, behind the bush
 This grassy walkway winds through the thick dry underbrush and trees,
 coming in from the north and changing directions several times before
 straightening out and continuing to the southeast.  This area too is
 eerily quiet, without even the usual chirping of nocturnal insects.
 Large bushes line the path, struggling to survive in this harsh

 light from what appears to be a campfire.

 A dingy guard scans the area attentively.

 A scruffy-looking man enters the area, searching the area with an
 electric lantern and a large rifle.

 The illumination from his lantern shows an unshaved man of about
 average height.  He appears to be wearing a pair of raggedy jeans,
 boots, and a patchwork coat of alternating colors.  You think you
 recognize them as raider markings.  His left hand helps support the
 large rifle he carries while also holding onto the handle of his
 electric lamp.

 The man frowns and scratches his head as he peers around the area.  "I

 Base Entrance
 At first glance, this might look like a normal clearing in the brush.
 Tall grass fills in the open space between the taller vegetation,
 broken only by a path leading northwest.  However, the wide
 concrete-lined chasm leading down into the ground is a clear indication
 that this clearing was, at least initially, the result of human labor.
 The opening is square, with a series of cement steps leading down to
 the south, ending at a metal-framed doorway.  The concrete surface
 extends for several feet around the entryway in a wide rectangle.  On
 the edge of this short plateau, directly in front of the stairs, is a
 small campfire and, beside it, a bedroll.

 On the ground you can see a lantern.

 A dingy guard scans the area attentively.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

 "Shit!"  the guard shouts as he sees you in the light of the campfire,
 bringing up his automatic rifle and firing in your direction.  The
 bullets tear through you and you're dead before you hit the ground.

 Clearing
 Browned vegetation encircles this patch of flat dusty ground.  Scraggly
 brush and thickets wave slowly in the glow of your flashlight.  The
 rustling of branches is the only sound you hear; the area seems eerily
 devoid of any other noise, even crickets.  Though you can make your way
 east and south, thorny brambles impede your movement in most other
 directions.  An opening to the west leads back towards Arcadia.

 Crumbling Building
 You find yourself inside one of the largest structures in this quiet
 village.  It may have been some kind of town hall or meeting area, as
 it consists of a single large room.  Huge gaping holes not only in the
 floor, ceiling, and south wall indicate the quality of workmanship.
 Time and the elements will eventually bring the entire building down.
 It appears to have been cleared of everything except for rotting
 furniture and various other pieces of debris.  A single crooked doorway
 leads east.

>search debris
 You rummage through rotting cushions and peer underneath furniture.
 Nothing is revealed.

>examine gps
 This is a GPS unit:  a hand-held device that uses the global
 positioning system from before the war.  It's accurate to within
 several yards.  Very useful to scavengers such as yourself.  You lost
 your last one in a card game.  Oops.  According to this, the clearing
 you arrived at matched the coordinates from the scrap of paper.

>examine furniture
 Bits of chairs, tables, benches.  Nothing useful.

 North End of Village
 The main north-south road of this gloomy hamlet ends here at a tangle
 of underbrush to the north.  The tiny houses here look downright eerie
 in the cascading glow of your flashlight.  To your west is the largest
 structure of the village, a wide one-story lodge that looks to be
 collapsing under its own weight.

 Lying in the middle of the road are a pair of human skeletons, their
 bones scattered across the ground.  The ground around them appears
 nearly black in your electric light.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

>examine skeletons
 There are strips of sinew and flesh hanging from some of the bones.
 One of the skeletons is visibly larger in stature than the other, and
 the larger body has a near perfect hole in the front of its skull.  A
 closer look at the bones reveals that most are covered with gouges and
 scratches that look suspiciously like bite marks.  Several of the bones
 have been dragged away from the main cluster.  As you move your
 flashlight among the carnage, something glints in the illumination.

>examine glint
 Turns out it's nothing more than a quartz crystal hanging from a
 leather cord.  It sparkles nicely, but you wouldn't get more than a
 couple bucks for it at the Arcadia market.

 The buildings are fairly crude structures, even by the standards of an

 door.  The road from the west curves north here, leading to the rest of
 the village.  While the town looks deserted, there is sign of recent
 activity here.  Tracks of some kind break up the relatively smooth
 surface of the road.

 A sound from the east causes you to spin about and aim your flashlight
 in that direction.  From between two of the buildings, a pair of
 emaciated coyotes slink into the street, their eyes glowing in the beam
 of your light.  They immediately turn their attention towards you.

 The coyotes continue to advance, and you see flakes of foam falling
 from their rancid mouths.

>go east
 The snarling coyotes block your way.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

 The coyotes are almost on top of you!

>go west
 Edge of Village
 You're standing on the west edge of a small village made up of decaying
 wooden buildings.  Most are little more than one room shacks.  Every
 window is dark and no noise reaches your straining ears.  The crooked
 structures to the south don't look particularly inviting, but no less
 than the gaping hole in the wall of a large building to your north.
 The clearing where you first arrived lies to the west.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

>go east
 Center of Village
 The heart of this deserted village holds no more sign of human life
 than its border.  Your flashlight spills over irregular buildings of
 poor craftsmanship and even poorer materials.  A collection of shanties
 lies to your south, and to your east is a single shack with a closed
 door.  The road from the west curves north here, leading to the rest of
 the village.  While the town looks deserted, there is sign of recent
 activity here.  Tracks of some kind break up the relatively smooth
 surface of the road.

 There is a pair of coyotes here, eyeing you hungrily.

>drop survival pack
 (Taking off the survival pack first)
 Dropped.

 You hear a deep growling coming from the coyotes as they slowly make
 their way towards you.

 You're not carrying the survival pack.

 Browned vegetation encircles this patch of flat dusty ground.  Scraggly
 brush and thickets wave slowly in the glow of your flashlight.  The

 Saved.

 Faded Path
 This grassy walkway winds through the thick dry underbrush and trees,
 coming in from the north and changing directions several times before
 straightening out and continuing to the southeast.  This area too is
 eerily quiet, without even the usual chirping of nocturnal insects.
 Large bushes line the path, struggling to survive in this harsh
 landscape.  To the southeast, you can make out a bright, flickering
 light from what appears to be a campfire.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

 From the direction of the campfire, you hear a man's gruff voice shout

 The hand grenade sails throw the air to the southeast.  Almost
 immediately, a burst of gun fire originating from that direction tears
 into your unprotected body.

 First Floor Hallway
 Once pristine stainless steel has become soiled by the dirty boots of
 countless pedestrians.  Before the war, this hall was almost certainly
 kept immaculately clean as a necessary process of this research
 facility.  However, new occupants have been less than fastidious in
 keeping it in its original condition.  The metal grating beneath your
 feet is discolored and encrusted with dried mud.  White walls sport
 numerous scuff marks, gouges and, in several places, lewd and explicit
 graffiti.  The hallway continues east and west, with an exit north and
 a door to the south.  That door, you notice, has a number of variations
 on "out of order" scribbled across its surface.  On the wall beside it
 is a small panel.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

 [Your score has just gone up by 1 point.]

>examine panel
 The panel is built into the southern wall, right beside the security
 door.  It's a smooth plastic rectangle that juts out from the surface
 of the wall about a half inch.  The majority of its area is taken up by
 an oddly dark scanner grid.  You've seen these before, they're designed
 to react with security badges with embedded microchips.  When the badge
 is touched to the grid, the chip is activated and the user's identity
 is read.  Below the grid is a numeric keypad which is dark.  In each of
 the right two corners is a single screw, and you see a pair of hinges
 along the left side.

>unscrew panel

 than its border.  Your flashlight spills over irregular buildings of
 poor craftsmanship and even poorer materials.  A collection of shanties
 lies to your south, and to your east is a single shack with a closed
 door.  The road from the west curves north here, leading to the rest of
 the village.  While the town looks deserted, there is sign of recent
 activity here.  Tracks of some kind break up the relatively smooth
 surface of the road.

 There is a pair of coyotes here, eyeing you hungrily.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

 Dropped.  The grenade arms as its safety lever goes flying.

 You hear a deep growling coming from the coyotes as they slowly make
 their way towards you.

 Edge of Village
 You're standing on the west edge of a small village made up of decaying
 wooden buildings.  Most are little more than one room shacks.  Every
 window is dark and no noise reaches your straining ears.  The crooked
 structures to the south don't look particularly inviting, but no less
 than the gaping hole in the wall of a large building to your north.
 The clearing where you first arrived lies to the west.

 Among the clods of dirt, you see a pair of coyote corpses.

 It appears that there's been an explosion in this area.  There's a
 small crater in the ground, surrounded by blackened scorch marks that
 radiate outwards.

 (Opening the shack door)
 Battered Shack
 The cramped confines of this shack leave little room for movement.
 Walls of bug-chewed wood and a roof of warped planks are the only thing
 between you and the cloudy night sky.  The shack itself contains little
 of notice besides the pungent odor of ammonia.  A few amorphous lumps
 of wood, stone, and other less identifiable materials lie scattered
 about.  A pile of discarded boards leans against the wall in one corner
 of the room.  The door to the west leads out into the street.

 Discarded on the ground you find a small plastic tub.

 Your Geiger counter chitters quietly.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be

>examine tub
 It appears to be a small tub, maybe three inches in diameter, made of
 yellowish-orange plastic.  Whatever lettering was on the side or lid
 has long since worn away.  The tub is currently closed.

>open tub
 Opening the small plastic tub reveals a lump of clay.

 There's a quiet thud from the corner of the shack, followed by a
 whispered, "Ow!"

 Pieces of lumber in various sizes and shapes.  This shack may have
 served as a storage shed for the village's construction materials.  The
 large pile is stacked in one corner of the shack, leaning against the
 wall.  There is a considerable pocket of deep shadow behind the boards.

 You hear a faint rustling noise coming from behind the boards.  It
 lasts for only a brief moment and then all is quiet again.

 You angle the boards away from the wall to peer behind them.  With a
 sudden cry, a small figure scrambles out from behind them.  The
 diminutive shape dashes across the shack and huddles in the opposite
 corner.  You turn the beam of your flashlight toward it and see that it
 is an emaciated little girl, covered in grime.

>examine clay
 A lump of clay, probably the kind used in sealing gaps between wooden
 planks.  Kinda squishy.

 The little girl seems too afraid of you to respond.

 You unwrap one of the small packages and hand it to her.  Tentatively
 she leans forward and accepts it, quickly pulling back.  She takes a
 tiny bite...  and a huge grin spreads across her face.  She wolfs the
 remainder down.

 "What's your name, little girl?"  you ask.

 "Iona," the little girl whispers.  You smile at her and she smiles
 back.  She doesn't seem quite so afraid of you anymore.

 "Where are you from?"

 She blinks, confused.  "Here."

 "Were you born here?"  Iona merely shrugs.

 "The coyotes have been after you?"

 "Yes, the doggies are very mean.  I think they want to eat me."

>tell iona about coyotes
 Iona simply looks up at you with wide eyes.

 Iona simply looks up at you with wide eyes.

>ask iona about parents
 "Where is your family?"

 Iona's eyes well up with tears.  "Dead," she says in a barely audible
 whisper.  "The bad men killed them.  They killed everyone."  Tears
 leave muddy tracks as they run down her face.

>ask iona about bad men
 "What can you tell me about the raiders?"

 Iona wipes her hand across her nose.  "The bad men came...  a bunch of
 days ago.  They moved into the base near here.  Then they killed
 everyone."  She starts to cry.  "They had guns and knives and everyone
 was screaming and there was blood everywhere...."  She sobs, unable to
 continue.

>comfort iona
 You lean down and embrace Iona.  She hugs you back tightly.

>ask iona about base
 "What do you know about this base that's nearby?"

 "It's a building under the ground," Iona says.  "That's where the bad
 men live. My parents couldn't open the door, but the bad men could when
 they came.  Then they came here and...."  She swallows, then continues.
 "There's a bad man guarding the door, but I think I know a secret way."

 "You know a secret way into the base?"

 Iona nods.  "I found it.  I was playing and I found it.  In the bushes.
 I can show you where it is.  But...  I lost my dolly and I can't reach
 it.  Can you get it for me?  I miss it so much."  She blinks back
 tears.

>ask iona about family

 Iona's eyes well up with tears.  "Dead," she says in a barely audible
 whisper.  "The bad men killed them.  They killed everyone."  Tears
 leave muddy tracks as they run down her face.

 Iona hums tunelessly.

 "Where is your doll?"

 "I dropped it.  I was in the building and the doggies came and scared
 me and I dropped it down in the hole.  I can't reach it and the ladder
 is broken.  It's too far down.  Will you get it for me?"

 Iona scratches her head.

>go north
 North End of Village
 The main north-south road of this gloomy hamlet ends here at a tangle
 of underbrush to the north.  The tiny houses here look downright eerie
 in the cascading glow of your flashlight.  To your west is the largest
 structure of the village, a wide one-story lodge that looks to be
 collapsing under its own weight.

 Lying in the middle of the road are a pair of human skeletons, their
 bones scattered across the ground.  The ground around them appears
 nearly black in your electric light.

 Iona follows close behind.  She seems to position herself so that you
 stand between her and the skeletons.

 There are strips of sinew and flesh hanging from some of the bones.
 One of the skeletons is visibly larger in stature than the other, and
 the larger body has a near perfect hole in the front of its skull.  A
 closer look at the bones reveals that most are covered with gouges and
 scratches that look suspiciously like bite marks.  Several of the bones
 have been dragged away from the main cluster.

>bury skeletons
 I don't know the word "bury".

 You can't find anything else of value amidst the pair of skeletons.

 Crumbling Building
 You find yourself inside one of the largest structures in this quiet
 village.  It may have been some kind of town hall or meeting area, as
 it consists of a single large room.  Huge gaping holes not only in the
 floor, ceiling, and south wall indicate the quality of workmanship.
 Time and the elements will eventually bring the entire building down.
 It appears to have been cleared of everything except for rotting
 furniture and various other pieces of debris.  A single crooked doorway
 leads east.

 Iona follows close behind.

 Iona looks down into the basement.  "I'm not going down there," she
 whispers, her face pale with fear.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

 You carefully lower yourself down into the basement.

 Collapsed Basement
 This wouldn't be your first choice for a final resting place.  But
 clearly not everyone has the luxury of making that decision for
 themselves.  Among the split and crumbling timbers that litter the
 floor of this basement lie perhaps a dozen dead bodies.  It's hard to
 tell for certain because the corpses are stacked in a large pile in a
 corner of the room, the body parts jumbled together like a macabre
 jigsaw puzzle.  The scent of decay is nearly overwhelming.  The
 splinters of wood scattered across the ground only enhance the aura of
 past violence.  Only a single chair seems to have survived the mayhem.

 A discarded rag doll lies among the carnage.

 leads you back to the clearing.

 Clearing
 Browned vegetation encircles this patch of flat dusty ground.  Scraggly
 brush and thickets wave slowly in the glow of your flashlight.  The
 rustling of branches is the only sound you hear; the area seems eerily
 devoid of any other noise, even crickets.  Though you can make your way
 east and south, thorny brambles impede your movement in most other
 directions.  An opening to the west leads back towards Arcadia.

 Iona is standing close beside you.  She smiles broadly.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly

 Iona leads you over to the brambles.  "Down here," she says, getting
 down on her hands and knees.  As you do the same, she points to a
 well-hidden gap in the brambles to the southwest.  "Back there.  You
 can crawl to the secret way in."  Giggling, she stands up.  She skips
 back to the shack, hugging her rag doll close and waving to you.

 You manage to crawl along the trail through the brambles with only
 minor scratches.

 Hidden Path
 This is the end of a very convoluted and twisted path through several
 hundred feet of frighteningly thorny briar patch.  The track is
 extremely difficult to see, especially at night, and you know you never
 would have found your way without help.  It heads back into the thicket
 to your northeast, the only footpath leading from this small open field
 among the brambles.  In the middle of the small clearing is a square
 metal structure, about two feet long on each side and protruding a
 couple of inches from the ground.  This box is topped by a metal
 grating held on by rusty latches.

 Iona follows close behind.

 Iona looks down into the air vent.  "I'm not going down there," she
 whispers, her face pale with fear.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

>examine latches
 It appears to be the top end of some sort of chimney or air vent.
 About two feet long on each side, it's constructed out of sheet metal.
 A metal grating is attached to the top by a set of rusty hinges.  If
 there was originally a lock on it, it's long since disintegrated.

>unscrew latches
 You see no way to do that.

>go down
 You lower yourself carefully into the shaft and squirm along as it
 turns horizontal.  After several feet of crawling, the duct turns
 vertical again.  Shimmying along its length, you drop down into the
 room beneath.

 Closet
 Your standard storage closet, complete with your standard ugly
 government regulation metal shelving units.  This one appears to see
 little use, as the few worn boxes sitting on the shelves are pretty
 much empty.  In the high ceiling above, you can see the dark shape of a
 vent shaft.  Hanging across the room, suspended by shelves, is a metal
 pole.  A single door leads east into the hall.

 Hanging from the pole is a frayed jacket.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly

 tub contains a lump of clay.

 You are currently carrying $26.

 Once pristine stainless steel has become soiled by the dirty boots of

 numerous scuff marks, gouges and, in several places, lewd and explicit
 graffiti.  The hallway continues east and west, with an exit north and
 a door to the south.  That door, you notice, has a number of variations
 on "out of order" scribbled across its surface.  On the wall beside it
 is a small panel.

 Your Geiger counter chitters quietly.

>go west
 First Floor Hallway West
 The metal grating that serves for a floor is mostly undisturbed, with
 only the occasional muddy footprint heading in from the east.  Messages
 are scrawled on the wall in ink, paint, and a few other unidentified
 substances.  Three doors are available here, one in each wall.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

>go north
 That door appears to have been jammed shut for years.

 The automated door opens to let you pass.

 Abandoned Office
 Very little remains in this dimly lit office and the dust you've
 stirred up suggests it hasn't seen any real use in quite some time.
 The massive wooden desk in the corner, except for a few dust-free
 outlines, is layered in a thick coating of the stuff.  Beyond it,
 nothing has been left in the room:  not even a chair.  The door to the
 north is the only exit.

 Your Geiger counter chitters quietly.

>examine desk
 This is a bulky office desk built from some kind of dark hardwood.  Its
 appearance is particularly ugly and utilitarian.  The top is covered
 with dust except for a few outlines of items that have probably been
 recently removed.  The left side consists of a large sliding drawer and
 the desk's very short legs keep it only about an inch off the floor.

>examine outlines
 The outlines in the dust merely reveal the shapes of objects that used
 to reside upon this table.  Nothing more.

>open drawer
 You slide the desk drawer open and find it empty.

>look under desk
 You peer under the desk and see the glint of something metallic.
 Unfortunately, the desk is too low to the ground to reach it.

 Searching the top of the desk, you find nothing except dust.  The

 something metallic.  Unfortunately, the desk is too low to the ground

 It's difficult to tell what it is, even with your flashlight.  All you
 can see is the glinting of light off of some metallic object.

 Your arm is too large to fit under the desk.

>top desk
 I don't know the word "top".

>push glint with pole
 That would just push it closer to the wall.

>tip desk
 I don't know the word "tip".

 There's no way you're moving this monster of a desk.

>get glint with pole
 You crouch down and try to snag the metallic object under the desk with
 the metal pole.  You can't seem to catch it, though, and after a minute
 you give up.

>inventory
 You have a scrap of paper, a survival pack (being worn), some radiation
 pills, a flashlight (providing light), a necklace (being worn), a
 grenade pin, a small plastic tub, a screwdriver, a frayed jacket (being
 worn), a circuit breaker, and a metal pole.

 The survival pack contains your travel rations, a Geiger counter, and a
 GPS unit.  The small plastic tub contains a lump of clay.

 You are currently carrying $26.

>put clay on pole
 You attempt to stick the lump of clay to the end of the pole, but it
 keeps sliding off.

>get flint with screwdriver
 I don't know the word "flint".

>get glint with screwdriver
 I don't see how that would help.

>examine screwdriver
 Much of the metal on the screwdriver shaft is pitted and rusted.  The
 handle, what there is of it, is wrapped in a ragged black tape.

>remove tape
 You realize that fiddling with the ragged black tape isn't necessary.

>examine tape
 The handle of the screwdriver is wound in a ragged black tape.

 First Floor Hallway East
 The hallway widens out slightly, expanding several feet to create
 alcoves to the north and south before constricting again after a span

 featureless door.  Muddy prints indicates that a regular stream of foot
 traffic passes along this east-west corridor.  More graffiti adorns
 these walls, and there's a tall wooden bookcase against one wall,
 partially concealing the northern alcove.  From the east comes a din of
 numerous voices.

                    Jones is 1 ugly bastard
    BRING ON THE WIMIN!!!!

        Keep an open mind...  bash your brains out

 Over the sound of voices to the east, you can just make out what sounds
 like footsteps and voices approaching the hall.

>go north
 You slip past the bookcase into the northern alcove.  From this
 location, you are almost completely hidden from the hallway.

 From behind the bookcase, you hear what sounds like two men enter the
 room.

>listen
 It sounds like there are two men in the hall.

 "Boss is pissed," you hear a voice say.

 "Yeah?"  a second voice replies.  "Why's that?"

>listen
 It sounds like there are two men in the hall.

 The first voice says, "He thinks Jones is working to take over.  Boss
 changed the password early."

 "Oh?  What is it now?"

 "Mutant."

>listen
 It sounds like there are two men in the hall.

 There's a pause.  "Is it true?"  the second voice asks.  "Is Jones?"

 "I doubt it," says the first voice.  "He's just been...."  The voices
 trail off as the men move out of earshot.

>look
 First Floor Hallway East, in the north alcove
 The hallway widens out slightly, expanding several feet to create
 alcoves to the north and south before constricting again after a span

 featureless door.  Muddy prints indicates that a regular stream of foot
 traffic passes along this east-west corridor.  More graffiti adorns
 these walls, and there's a tall wooden bookcase against one wall,
 partially concealing the northern alcove.  From the east comes a din of
 numerous voices.

>examine bookcase
 Reaches about six feet tall and spans around three feet across.  The
 wood is extremely old, and probably has only survived this long because
 it's been in the dry, sterile air of the base.  Most of the shelves are
 missing, possibly used for firewood.  The majority of the backing still
 remains, however, obscuring the view of the northern alcove from the
 hall.

>go south
 You step out from behind the bookcase, back into the hallway.

>search bookcase
 You find nothing of interest.

 Barracks
 Whatever purpose this room originally served, it now functions as a
 massive brigand encampment.  There are about three dozen makeshift beds
 spread across the blue tile floor, and jumbled piles of personal
 possessions scattered about. The raiders, a large crowd of dirty,
 unpleasant-looking men, are each dressed in similar colors of red and
 green and all appear to be armed.  The men are engaged in all manner of
 activities, from games of skill to maintaining weapons to eating to
 gambling.  Embedded in the western wall, beside one of the bunks, is a
 lone metal panel of brushed stainless steel.  The doorway west leads
 back into the hallway, while a second exit lies to the south.

 Hanging from the stainless steel panel is a map and a note being held
 on by a kitchen magnet.

>read note
 The note reads:

 Okay, maggots, this is the last time I'm gonna tell you.  You don't
 bother me unless it is something important.  Otherwise you talk to Ertz
 or Randall.  The next person to bother me without a very good reason
 ends up in a shallow grave next to Sulz.

 Those of you that can read, make sure the rest of the troops understand
 this.

 Randall managed to scrounge up a pack of explosives on his last trip
 out.  If we can't get that damn door open any other way, we'll blast
 the fucking thing.

 Remember:  the wasteland belongs to us.

 Boss

 With a knife, a raider tries to slice a cut in the wall.  He examines
 the wall with a puzzled look as his weapon fails to make even a mark.

>examine map
 It appears to be an old, faded map of the countryside.  After all your
 travels, you do have a certain familiarity with the terrain.  The
 location of Arcadia is marked in red, as is the location of this base.

 You are roughly jostled by a careless raider as he walks by.  "Watch
 where you're going," he snarls at you.

>take magnet
 Taken.  The papers being held by the magnet flutter to the floor.

 A group of the men begin arguing with several others about the proper
 way to scalp a person:  some of the men insist that the best way is to
 start at the front and the others disagree.

>examine magnet
 A small black disc, about an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch
 thick.

 A small crowd forms around a raider holding up a yellowed girly
 magazine.  The men hoot and grunt at the centerfold.

>take map
>examine panel
 Taken.

 The metal panel is a stainless steel rectangle, about a foot wide and a
 foot-and-a-half tall.  It's set into the wall, completely flush against
 the surface, about four feet off the floor.  There's nothing on the
 stainless steel panel.

 Several of the men begin playing a raucous game of cards.

>take paper
 You already have the scrap of paper!

>take note
 Taken.

 A group of raiders clear off a makeshift table.  Two of them sit at
 opposite ends and begin arm wrestling.  The rest of the men crowd
 around the two challengers, yelling and cheering.

>take note
 You already have the note!

 A handful of rifle cartridges drops to the floor and the rounds scatter
 across the room.  The man who dropped them swears as he chases after
 them.  A couple of the other raiders snort and laugh.

>open panel
 If the stainless steel panel opens, it's not clear how.

>examine bunks
 Rather filthy.  But then, you've slept on worse.

 One of the men begins bragging loudly about how many villagers he
 killed.  The rest of the raiders appear unimpressed by his boasts.

>examine guards
 I don't see any guards here.

>get cartridges
 I don't know the word "cartridges".

>go south
 Conference Room
 From the looks of it, the original purpose of this large room was to
 hold meetings and briefings.  However, the large table and office
 chairs are in desperate need of maintenance and the once white walls
 now sport an impressive array of scuffs, gouges, and puncture marks.
 The doorway to the north leads back into the barracks and the western
 door has one of the more intact chairs sitting beside it, almost
 blocking the way.

 Sitting in the one good chair is a raider guard whose attention is
 focused on you.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

>examine guard
 A little less scruffy than the rest of the raiders, but not by much.
 He's wearing a brown leather jacket, torn in a couple of places, with
 the same green and red bands as the rest of the raiders.  The raider is
 sitting in the chair beside the door, a mean looking black submachine
 gun cradled in his hands.  His feet are propped up on the table in the
 center of the room.  Dangling from a cord around the man's neck is what
 appears to be a yellow-tinted glass prism that refracts and reflects
 the light in the room.

>guard, I'm here to relieve you
 I don't know the word "i'm".

>examine prism
 It very much resembles a yellow-tinted glass prism that refracts and
 reflects the light in the room.  Datacubes like this were the standard
 portable digital storage medium before the war.  This one has leather
 cord fastened to it, so it can be worn around the neck.

 "That's an interesting medallion you're wearing."

 The raider guard looks down.  "Yeah.  I take it off when we go on a
 raid.  Reflections can give our position away.  But otherwise I think
 it looks good on me.  But I'm always looking if you are interested in
 trading."

>ask about trading
 (the raider guard)
 "Interested in trading me that prism?"

 The guard nods.  "Sure, if you've got anything worth it."

>show necklace to guard
 You lift the quartz crystal necklace up and show it to the guard.  He
 raises an eyebrow, then fingers the prism hanging around his neck.
 "Hey, wow, that's pretty nice.  A lot better than this old thing here.
 Let me know if you're interested in a trade."  He raises an eyebrow.

>give necklace to guard
 The guard nods and hands you the prism in exchange for the quartz
 crystal necklace.  He loops the leather strap around his neck and holds
 the crystal in front of his face, marveling at its sparkle.

>ask guard about gun
 Which gun do you mean, the rifle, the silenced pistol, the laser gun,
 or the submachine gun?

>ask guard about submachine gun
 "Where'd you get that gun?"

 He peers at you suspiciously.  "That's a perk of rank.  It'll take you
 a long time to earn something this good."

>ask guard about door
 Which door do you mean, the west door, or the security door?

>examine man's jacket
 I don't see any man's jacket here.

>ask guard about west door
 "What's behind this door?"

 "That's the boss's office.  That's where he meets with people.  The
 room behind that is his own personal room."

 prong runs out of the wall and dangles loosely in the air.

>put circuit breaker in socket
 That won't fit.

>show badge to sensor
 Oddly enough, you get no response.

>examine socket
 The socket is nothing more than a metal-encircled hole in the panel's
 interior. It is about an eighth of an inch in diameter.

>examine circuit breaker
 A small, thin block of plastic with a switch on the front and metal
 tabs on the back.  A circuit breaker, you know, fits into an electrical
 breaker box in order to complete the electrical circuit and allow power
 to flow.  In the event of an electrical overload, it switches itself
 off.  The breaker is currently switched off.

>examine panel
 The panel is built into the southern wall, right beside the security
 door.  It's a smooth plastic rectangle that juts out from the surface
 of the wall about a half inch.  The majority of its area is taken up by
 a brightly illuminated scanner grid.  You've seen these before, they're
 designed to react with security badges with embedded microchips.  When
 the badge is touched to the grid, the chip is activated and the user's
 identity is read.  Below the grid is a numeric keypad with glowing
 number keys.  In each of the right two corners is a single screw, and
 you see a pair of hinges along the left side.  The panel is currently
 open.  On the inside back of the panel, there is a metal-lined socket.
 A bundle of wires ending in a metal prong runs out of the wall and into
 the socket.

 Known him for years, so he trusts me, ya know?  Doesn't trust all the
 new recruits, so he has me stand guard here.  Doesn't trust all the

 Security Station
 You are standing in a small square room, about ten feet across.  You
 notice a distinct lack of the grime and squalor that has been so
 evident in the rest of the facility.  The large metal desk in the
 southeast corner appears to be reasonably clean and in good condition,
 as does the office chair before it.  Mounted on the south wall are a
 number of small screens, each labeled with a number.  All of them are
 dark.  Attached to the desk is a small computer console, consisting of
 monitor and keyboard.  Two doors lead out:  the east door towards the
 conference room and a second one heading to the west.  Both are closed.

 Resting in the corner you spot a grenade launcher.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

>examine grenade launcher
 A formidable looking weapon.  Built mostly from black plastic and
 steel.  The muzzle seems so wide you could practically fall into it.
 You notice that the grip seems to have some kind of electronic sensor
 on it.

>examine screens
 All of the security screens are dark.

 There is some kind of faintly glowing grid along the backstrap of the
 grenade launcher's grip.  You're not sure exactly what it is.  Some
 kind of sensor, perhaps?

>examine computer
 This appears to be a simple single-purpose computer.  It's a keyboard
 and monitor combined into a single unit, mounted onto a tabletop.  The

    SECURITY LOGS

 2060-08-25     Corporal Jacob
    A civilian penetrated the base perimeter before being spotted by a
 passing tech and reported to security.  Colonel Miles has had
 Lieutenant Leach reassigned for this failure in security.

 2060-09-20     Sergeant Herbert
    A company of renegade troops passing nearby caught sight of the base
 perimeter and advanced on the base.  The 83rd Armored engaged them and
 drove them back, but took heavy casualties.

 2060-10-11     Sergeant Herbert
    Official word's come in that another base in NM has fallen to the
 rebels.  Rumors have it that their base commander went over to the
 other side.  The Colonel has ordered now that speech even somewhat
 sympathetic to the rebel cause is grounds for court martial and
 immediate execution for treason.

 2060-10-20     Major Tuco
    The owrd just came ocver the radio.  Edgar gave THE ORDER.  oh god I
 camn't bleieve this oh god oh god oh god

 2060-12-09     Captain Ramirez
    We're out of food and supplies.  Major Tuco has vanished.  Colonel
 Miles is dead.  Private Robinson went crazy when the Colonel refused to
 discuss the idea of leaving the base.  Shot him right in front of
 everyone.  The others killed her right after she did it.  Now we have
 no choice.  We hve to leave and see if there's anything left.  Can
 there be?  Can there be anything left?  Anyone alive?  The radio's been
 dead since it all happened.  We will be too if we don't leave soon.
 Mother of God.

 Conference Room
 From the looks of it, the original purpose of this large room was to
 hold meetings and briefings.  However, the large table and office
 chairs are in desperate need of maintenance and the once white walls
 now sport an impressive array of scuffs, gouges, and puncture marks.
 The doorway to the north leads back into the barracks and the western
 door has one of the more intact chairs sitting beside it, almost
 blocking the way.

 Sitting in the one good chair is a raider guard whose attention is
 focused on you.

 "Fucking thief!"  the raider guard shouts as he turns his gun toward
 you and pulls the trigger.  As you fall to the ground, the grenade
 launcher slips from your grasp and clatters to the floor.

 southeast corner appears to be reasonably clean and in good condition,
 as does the office chair before it.  Mounted on the south wall are a

 dark.  Attached to the desk is a small computer console, consisting of
 monitor and keyboard.  Two doors lead out:  the east door towards the
 conference room and a second one heading to the west.  Both are closed.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly

>go north
 Barracks
 Whatever purpose this room originally served, it now functions as a
 massive brigand encampment.  There are about three dozen makeshift beds
 spread across the blue tile floor, and jumbled piles of personal
 possessions scattered about. The raiders, a large crowd of dirty,
 unpleasant-looking men, are each dressed in similar colors of red and
 green and all appear to be armed.  The men are engaged in all manner of
 activities, from games of skill to maintaining weapons to eating to
 gambling.  Embedded in the western wall, beside one of the bunks, is a
 lone metal panel of brushed stainless steel.  The doorway west leads
 back into the hallway, while a second exit lies to the south.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

>go west
 First Floor Hallway East
 The hallway widens out slightly, expanding several feet to create
 alcoves to the north and south before constricting again after a span
 of several strides.  At the far end of each alcove is smooth,
 featureless door.  Muddy prints indicates that a regular stream of foot
 traffic passes along this east-west corridor.  More graffiti adorns
 these walls, and there's a tall wooden bookcase against one wall,
 partially concealing the northern alcove.  From the east comes a din of
 numerous voices.

>go west
 First Floor Hallway
 Once pristine stainless steel has become soiled by the dirty boots of
 countless pedestrians.  Before the war, this hall was almost certainly
 kept immaculately clean as a necessary process of this research
 facility.  However, new occupants have been less than fastidious in
 keeping it in its original condition.  The metal grating beneath your
 feet is discolored and encrusted with dried mud.  White walls sport
 numerous scuff marks, gouges and, in several places, lewd and explicit
 graffiti.  The hallway continues east and west, with an exit north and
 a door to the south.  That door, you notice, has a number of variations
 on "out of order" scribbled across its surface.  On the wall beside it
 is a small panel.

>touch panel with badge
 You touch the security badge to the scanning grid.  The keys on the
 keypad become lit.

>type 38823 on keypad
 The door slides open, revealing a stairway to the south.

>go south
 Top of Stairs
 You are standing on a landing at the top of a flight of steps that runs
 down to the south.  To the north is a steel sliding door, with a button
 on the wall beside it, and a brightly illuminated lamp above.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

 The door slides shut.

>press button
 You hit the button and the door slides open.

>examine lamp
 The lamp is a simple dome light, set in the wall above the door.

 The door slides shut.

>go south
 Second Floor Hallway
 Unlike the first floor hallway, this corridor is coated with a thick
 layer of dust, not grime and dried mud.  Still, the basic structure is
 the same.  The floor is a grating of bright metal that glitters beneath
 your footprints in the dust and ivory walls frame this hallway that
 leads east and west.  Directly to the north is a flight of steps
 leading upwards to the first floor.  The security door in the south
 wall is very similar to the one you encountered above, including the
 panel embedded into the wall beside it.  The overhead fluorescents on
 this floor are distinctly dark.

>examine panel
 The panel is built into the southern wall, right beside the security
 door.  It's a smooth plastic rectangle that juts out from the surface
 of the wall about a half inch.  The majority of its area is taken up by
 an oddly dark scanner grid.  You've seen these before; they're designed
 to react with security badges with embedded microchips.  When the badge
 is touched to the grid, the chip is activated and the user's identity
 is read.  Below the grid is a numeric keypad which is dark.  In each of
 the right two corners is a single screw, and you see a pair of hinges
 along the left side.

>touch panel with badge
 You touch the security badge to the scanning grid but nothing happens.

>unscrew panel
 These screws are stripped beyond repair.

>go west
 Electrical Room
 Plastic and metal electrical conduits press in on you from every side
 in this narrow room.  It seems to be the hub for all power distribution
 at least for this level of the facility, possibly for the entire base.
 There are a number of transformers in the back of the room, some power
 meters spliced into several of the conduits, and a small breaker box in
 one corner.  The only exit leads east.

 In one corner of the room, you notice an aluminum ladder.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

>examine breaker box
 The breaker box is a metal-framed box of dull gray built to control the
 flow of electricity through circuit breakers.  The front is hinged and
 swings open to access the internals.  The breaker box is currently
 closed.

>open box
 The breaker box swings open, revealing a row of empty slots.

>examine slots
 The breaker box is a metal-framed box of dull gray built to control the
 flow of electricity through circuit breakers.  The front is hinged and
 swings open to access the internals.  The breaker box is currently
 open, showing ribbons of metal behind a row of empty slots.

>put circuit breaker in box
 You slide the circuit breaker into the breaker box and switch it on.
 Almost immediately, the overhead lights begin to glow.  In a moment,
 they are at full strength.

>examine ladder
 A basic aluminum A-frame folding ladder.  This particular one opens up
 to a height of about six feet.  The ladder is currently closed.

 Second Floor Hallway
 Unlike the first floor hallway, this corridor is coated with a thick
 layer of dust, not grime and dried mud.  Still, the basic structure is
 the same.  The floor is a grating of bright metal that glitters beneath
 your footprints in the dust and ivory walls frame this hallway that

 wall is very similar to the one you encountered above, including the
 panel embedded into the wall beside it.  The room is filled with the
 hum of the overhead fluorescents.

 You don't recall ever seeing a floor like this and you aren't sure what
 the original purpose was.  The gaps in the grating are small, no more
 than a quarter of an inch wide.  If there's a subflooring underneath,
 you can't tell how far beneath it is.

 I don't know the word "gaps".

>go east
 Outside Commissary
 The east-west hallway ends here at a sturdy sliding door.  Stenciled
 across its surface is the word "COMMISSARY" in white block letters.  In
 the wall beside it is a small window and a button.  Other than that,
 this end of the hallway is similar to the rest of the corridor.
 Overhead, the string of fluorescent lights, interrupted only by an air
 conditioning vent, hum as they illuminate the room.

>examine window
 A small square window, about a foot wide, but blocked by a wide mesh
 wire screen.

 I don't know the word "scren".

 Commissary
 You see a room that was probably once a busy storage center, but is now
 little more than an empty room.  Though the numerous shelves remain,
 their contents were probably removed several decades before you were
 born.  Against the back wall a lonely control console remains the only
 other feature inside this room.  Up above, the fluorescent lights are
 brightly glowing.  In the midst of the overhead lights is an open
 ceiling panel.

 On the ground you see a radiation suit.  Sitting on the control console
 is a water bottle.

 Your Geiger counter chitters quietly.

>examine suit
 A full body suit with a tinted plexiglass mask and respiratory filters.
 The suit is made out of some kind of shiny fabric you can't immediately
 identify.  While it has an almost mirror-like surface, it's also very
 flexible.

>examine geiger
 Your basic 22nd century Geiger counter, this one from Rabisi

 Power Plant
 Every molecule of your body seems to vibrate in tune with the great
 turbines of the fusion generator that sits before you.  What you can
 see of it is an imposing edifice, slightly curved as if you are seeing
 one small section of a very large ring.  Massive pipes and conduits
 link to the power plant from numerous angles, connecting at multiple
 points on its surface.  Anchored to the ground beside the fusion
 generator is a console with controls and several small screens.  You
 also spot a gray breaker box nestled among one bundle of wires.  To the
 east is an open doorway, and south of this room is a corridor shrouded
 in vapor.  The overhead fluorescents on this floor are distinctly dark.

 Your Geiger counter is shrieking a blare of static and a piercing alarm
 bell.  A glance at the indicator reveals a red arrow pointing south.

>examine console
 This large control console is fastened to the floor right in front of
 the fusion generator.  Along the left side are a number of screens,
 displaying information about the status of the power plant.  To the
 right of these are a series of switches and buttons, only a few of
 which are clearly labeled.  At the top is a red button marked "CYCLE",
 followed by a white one with "START UP" written beside it.  Below them,
 a black button labeled "SHUTDOWN", a blue one marked "VENT", and a
 green button indicated as "SHUNT".  The rest of the controls are beyond
 your comprehension.

>examine breaker
 The breaker box is a metal-framed box of dull gray built to control the
 flow of electricity through circuit breakers.  The front is hinged and
 swings open to access the internals.  The breaker box is currently

 You wedge the metal pole into the door, preventing it from closing.

 The door at the top of the stairs bangs against the metal pole laying
 in its track, but stays open.

 Second Floor Hallway
 Unlike the first floor hallway, this corridor is coated with a thick
 layer of dust, not grime and dried mud.  Still, the basic structure is
 the same.  The floor is a grating of bright metal that glitters beneath
 your footprints in the dust and ivory walls frame this hallway that
 leads east and west.  Directly to the north is a flight of steps
 leading upwards to the first floor.  The security door in the south
 wall is very similar to the one you encountered above, including the
 panel embedded into the wall beside it.  The room is filled with the
 hum of the overhead fluorescents.

 The door to the south has been blocked open by a metal pole in its
 track.

>go west
 Electrical Room
 Plastic and metal electrical conduits press in on you from every side
 in this narrow room.  It seems to be the hub for all power distribution
 at least for this level of the facility, possibly for the entire base.
 There are a number of transformers in the back of the room, some power
 meters spliced into several of the conduits, and a small breaker box in
 one corner.  The only exit leads east.

 The breaker box contains a circuit breaker.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

 Top of Stairs
 You are standing on a landing at the top of a flight of steps that runs

 The door to the north has been blocked open by a metal pole in its

 Third Floor Hallway
 Here the walls, floor, and even the air all seem to be permeated by a
 deep, resonating hum.  A faint odor also catches your attention:  the
 scent of ozone laced with a hint of something burning.  The hall,
 however, doesn't appear to contain anything out of the ordinary.
 Beside the stairway to the north that leads up to a security door,
 there are automated doors to the east and south, plus an entryway to
 the west.  The overhead fluorescents on this floor are distinctly dark.

>go west
 Power Plant
 Every molecule of your body seems to vibrate in tune with the great
 turbines of the fusion generator that sits before you.  What you can
 see of it is an imposing edifice, slightly curved as if you are seeing
 one small section of a very large ring.  Massive pipes and conduits
 link to the power plant from numerous angles, connecting at multiple
 points on its surface.  Anchored to the ground beside the fusion
 generator is a console with controls and several small screens.  You
 also spot a gray breaker box nestled among one bundle of wires.  To the
 east is an open doorway, and south of this room is a corridor shrouded
 in vapor.  The overhead fluorescents on this floor are distinctly dark.

 Your Geiger counter is shrieking a blare of static and a piercing alarm
 bell.  A glance at the indicator reveals a red arrow pointing south.

>put breaker in box
 You slide the circuit breaker into the breaker box and switch it on.
 Almost immediately, the overhead lights begin to glow.  In a moment,
 they are at full strength.

 Steamy Passage
 Several of the thick pipes from the power plant run through this brief
 north-south hallway.  Three of them appear to have developed cracks
 over the years, as they are swathed in clouds of steam that trail
 upwards and disappear into a vent on the ceiling.  Fortunately, none of
 the steam completely obstructs movement to either the doorway to your

 The Geiger counter is alive with noise.  The combination of static and

 Even after decades of disuse, this room is still astonishingly free of
 dust.  Stainless steel countertops gleam in the muted glow of the
 overhead lights.  Four white solid-block tables, their surfaces made
 from some kind of synthetic material, occupy most of the space in this
 room.  Each of them has a deck of unfamiliar electronic equipment
 attached to the top, plus a pair of tall modular chairs.  An imposing
 silvery vault door makes up most of the eastern wall.  Whatever else
 may have been in this room has since been cleared out, except for a gas
 storage tank near the automated entrance.

 Sitting on one of the tables is a heavy wrench.

 A very large steel cylinder, measuring about five feet high and a foot
 in diameter.  At the top of the tank is a regulator valve designed to
 control the flow of gas.  It looks particularly corroded.  The surface
 of the tank is green paint, peeling in several places.  A large sign is
 affixed to the front of the tank, a diamond with red edges and the word
 "FLAMMABLE" written in block letters.

 A chrome-plated wrench about a eighteen inches long.  It looks rather

 Way out of your league.  Well, most of it, anyway.  You do notice one
 particularly simple piece of equipment:  a log player.

>examine player
 A fairly basic piece of electronics.  It has a square receptacle, about
 an inch wide, on the top for inserting datacubes.  Beside it is a
 button marked 'Play' and another button marked 'Stop'.  Within the
 receptacle you see a green datacube.

>press play
 A male voice from the log player greets you:  "Doctor Kevin Rock,
 personal log, fourteenth cube.

 "November eighteenth.  Situation's only getting worse.  This is sure
 something they didn't cover in all my psych classes.  How exactly are
 people supposed to react to the possible end of the world?  What use is
 anything I say?  The Colonel seems to be holding up well, but I'd say
 he's also in denial over the food and supplies situation.  A lot of
 good keeping everyone nice and orderly is going to be when my stomach
 is digesting itself."

 Time passes...

 The voice continues:  "November twenty-third.  I caught one of the damn
 grunts fooling around with the prototype.  Who gave these fucking
 idiots the access code anyway?  I imagine it's only going to get worse,
 too, what with all of us cooped up in here.  But this nonsense has got
 to stop.  What we've made here, it's...  it's not something...  I don't
 know.  It was like a wondrous miracle, but all seems so pointless now.
 It can't feed us.  It can't protect us from radiation.  But maybe it'll
 do some good...  some day.  I'm going to just lock the vault and change
 the code.  I'll give it to Colleen, in case she wants to continue to
 work.  Keep her mind busy.  I'll need to make it something she'll
 remember though.  She's been understandably preoccupied lately.  Maybe
 her birthday."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The man goes on:  "December first.  Does that jackass Miles really
 expect things to magically change?  We have a limited supply of food.
 It is running out.  What's he waiting for, deus ex machina?  The
 nearest town is...  was?  Is about a day's walk from here, maybe a
 little longer.  We should send someone, or a group, out there, armed,
 in suits.  See what we can barter or...  scavenge, if it's as bad out
 there as they say.  But he refuses to listen.  Just tells us to hold
 tight.  Fucking military."

>wait

 The log player beeps and then falls silent.

>take green cube

>put yellow cube in player
 Done.

>press play
 You hear a trembling female voice come from the log player:  "The
 personal log of Doctor Colleen Hill, cube twelve.

 "October twenty-first.  Colonel Miles ordered the top two floors
 evacuated during all of this...  insanity.  Lord Christ, I can't
 believe it came to this. Major Tuco said he believed it was probably
 all over already, since nuclear war isn't something that can really
 drag on.  Is it?  How long will we be safe down here?  No one seems to
 know.  Some of the soldiers say that all military facilities like this
 are designed to provide years of comfortable living in the event of
 such a 'contingency'.  This is not a contingency!  It's the death of
 the whole damn world!"  The speaker pauses and takes a breath.  "In any
 event, the problem is that no one was exactly expecting this.  Maybe we
 could stay down here for years, if the base was fully stocked.  Problem
 is, no one was anticipating a nuclear war this month."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The tingly sensation seems to be lessening.

 The speaker continues:  "October twenty-eighth.  No contact on the
 radio for over a week.  Everyone believes the bombs have stopped, but
 does it matter?  The world is poison now.  Still, the base life support
 systems seem up to the task and we've all returned to the first two
 floors.  No one's gone outside though.  We were told that this new
 self-maintaining reactor design might well last over a hundred years
 without maintenance.  As long as no one screws up and shunts the
 plasma."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The tingly sensation has faded completely.

 The female voice goes on:  "November second.  Not much of a
 celebration.  Supplies are low and rationed, so a party was out of the
 question.  Bobby stuck a candle in a dinner roll and wished me a happy
 birthday.  It was a sweet gesture, though didn't really do much to
 cheer me up for long."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The voice begins again:  "November thirteenth.  Radio's still got
 nothing but static.  Fredericks, Lee, and James suited up and went
 above ground.  Fredericks says all of the vehicles are gone and that
 the soldiers who were trapped outside when the base went on lock down
 must have taken them and fled.  Can they still be alive up there?  Lee
 says the radiation level is dangerously high, but can't be sure how
 long it'll stay that way.  Maybe for the next ten thousand years?"

>wait
 Time passes...

 The female voice continues, the strain clearly evident:  "December
 eighth.  We're all falling apart.  There's no food left and Tonya
 finally went over the edge today.  My God, she shot the Colonel right
 in front of everyone!  There were just these deafening booms and
 Colonel Miles just collapsed and there was all this blood, he was just
 bleeding so much."  She draws a shaky breath.  "Then before I think
 even Tonya realized what she'd done, Bobby and Walsh shot her dead too.
 The Major went absolutely white, though I don't know if it was because
 of the murder or that he's now in charge."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The speaker again, this time in a flat and emotionless voice:
 "December ninth. We're leaving.  The Captain decided, since the Major
 is gone.  No one knows where he went.  Lince thinks Tuco went topside
 and shot himself with his pistol, though so far no one has gone to
 check.  I guess we'll find out soon enough.  We've emptied the
 commissary of nearly everything.  Everything except for Tuco's rad
 suit.  Corporal Wilson did some radiation checks this morning and found
 that levels were low enough to allow travel.  To where?  I don't know.
 Maybe Tuco had the right idea."

>wait
 Time passes...
 The log player beeps and then falls silent.

>examine vault
 A fairly large door of brightly polished steel.  Formidable in
 appearance, it looks quite secure.  On the left side is a numeric
 keypad and on the right side are the door's large discolored hinges.
 The door is currently closed.

 odd new guy.  Only, we haven't had any new recruits for over two
 months."  A quick look over your shoulder reveals a huge form standing
 in front of the sliding glass doors. The figure is at least seven feet
 tall with a massive, imposing build.  Only after a moment do you
 realize that this superhuman shape is in truth a man clad in a suit of
 military combat armor, a grenade launcher in his hand.  "You have done
 me one favor, though," the titan continues in the voice of the
 wasteland itself.  "I've been meaning to get down into these lower
 levels for a while and you kindly made it easier.  You're still going
 to have to die."

 You turn and dash towards the open vault door.  "Not so fast," the

 you unto an untimely end.

 "Arcadia and its thieves," the raider boss growls.  "Coming out here
 and stealing what's rightfully ours?  You must have some kind of death
 wish."  As his left fist shakes in your direction, his other hand
 angles the grenade launcher up in your direction.

>open valve
 The gas tank's regulator valve seems frozen shut.

 The armored behemoth takes a step forward.  "I hope you don't mind if I
 enjoy the moment.  This is the first time I've gotten the chance to
 kill one of you fuckers myself."

>open valve with wrench
 I don't know how to open the regulator valve.

 The leader continues:  "And after I take care of you, we're moving on

 enjoying every minute of it.  These pathetic wretches out here in the
 waste don't have shit worth stealing.  Your little city, I've heard,

>hit valve with wrench
 You can't get close enough with the raider standing there beside it.

 "But first," the man says, "I'm going to finish you off."  Bringing the
 grenade launcher up to his shoulder, he fires off a single explosive
 shell in your direction.

 Your aim goes a little high, knocking the regulator off of the top of

 Containment Vault
 The air is still.  Even the vibrations from the ancient fusion reactor
 can't seem to penetrate the hush of this metal vault.  In the very
 center of the small room stands a sort of pedestal, reaching about
 waist high, with a circular surface approximately two feet in diameter.

 Sitting on the pedestal is an odd-looking helmet.

>examine pedestal
 The pedestal is made of a smooth metal and is perfectly round.  Its
 base is slightly wider than the top surface.  Scorch marks radiate
 outwards from the center of the pedestal's surface.

 Judging by the overall shape and contours, it sure looks like a helmet.
 Just not like anything you've ever seen before.  On the inside, there
 are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of tiny little black circles laid across
 a surface of very smooth bright gray plastic.  Each of these circles
 has little specks of silver inside that catch and sparkle in the light.
 On the outside is a chaos of integrated circuits, wires, and thin
 plastic tubes.  They twist and coil among each other in convoluted
 patterns across the entire surface of this bizarre headgear.  You can
 find no recognizable power switch.

 once in place, there are a few faint beeps followed by a quiet
 whirring.  You don't notice anything else happen, however.

 You don't hear anything.

 There's a throbbing deep inside your skull, building to a peak and then
 slowly subsiding.  Your vision swims and you place a hand against a
 wall to steady yourself.

 Okay, you're now sitting on the ground.

 Slowly, you become aware of strange sensation, unlike anything you've
 ever experienced before.  Amidst your swirling emotions, you feel a
 sense of anger building.  Rage.  Hatred.  Loathing.  The bizarre thing
 is how detached you find yourself from this bubble of seething
 animosity floating within your consciousness.  You shudder as a wave of
 nausea overtakes you.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Focusing on the ball of rage adrift within your psyche, you come to the
 sudden realization that the sensation isn't internal at all.  You look
 upwards and gape.  The wrathful emotions emanate from above.  And as
 you blink in shock, information streams into your mind like a
 unstoppable tidal wave.  Names and images.  The ceiling before you is
 overlaid with the scene of two raiders arguing, one of them stalking
 away and the other left seething.  It loops, going faster and faster
 before fading away.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Now your consciousness seems to expand.  More oily recesses of emotion,
 thought, and knowledge slip into your growing perception.  Just when
 the terrible flood of awareness seems about to overwhelm you, it dies
 down to a dull and manageable array of distant auras just on the
 fringes of your mind.  To your amazement, you find that by
 concentrating on a particular shard of emotion, you are able to
 actually scan the thoughts of a single raider.  Feelings, images, and
 words slither like slimy worms through your brain.

 The idea that you've discovered a device to read minds from a distance
 leaves you stunned.  The possibilities dance in your mind, a dizzying
 galaxy of futures.  For now, though, the only thing you know for sure
 is that it's time to leave this place.

>read iona

>remove helmet
 Okay, you're no longer wearing the odd-looking helmet.

>read jones
 I don't see any jones here.

>wear helmet
 As you place the strange device upon your head, it activates with a few
 beeps and the same gentle whirring.  Slowly, the distant motes of
 consciousness dance into your awareness, raging tempests of emotion and
 thought.

 You have a scrap of paper, a survival pack (being worn), a flashlight
 (providing light), a grenade pin, a map, a note, an aluminum ladder, an
 odd-looking helmet (being worn), and a radiation suit (being worn).
 The survival pack contains your travel rations, a Geiger counter, a GPS
 unit, a water bottle, some radiation pills, a small plastic tub, a
 screwdriver, a security badge, a frayed jacket, a heavy wrench, and a
 green datacube.

 You are currently carrying $26.

 Containment Vault
 The air is still.  Even the vibrations from the ancient fusion reactor
 can't seem to penetrate the hush of this metal vault.  In the very
 center of the small room stands a sort of pedestal, reaching about
 waist high, with a circular surface approximately two feet in diameter.

>go west
 Laboratory
 Even after decades of disuse, this room is still astonishingly free of
 dust.  Stainless steel countertops gleam in the muted glow of the
 overhead lights.  Four white solid-block tables, their surfaces made
 from some kind of synthetic material, occupy most of the space in this
 room.  Each of them has a deck of unfamiliar electronic equipment
 attached to the top, plus a pair of tall modular chairs.  A large area
 of scorched metal and plastic marks the location of a large explosion.
 An open vault door makes up most of the eastern wall.  Whatever else
 may have been in this room has since been cleared out.

 The log player contains a yellow datacube.

 The mangled remains of the bandit leader lie beside the sliding doors.

 Your Geiger counter is shrieking a blare of static and a piercing alarm
 bell.  A glance at the indicator reveals a red arrow pointing west.

>eat pill
 You swallow one of the radiation pills.  You immediately feel a tingly
 sensation spread throughout your body.

>take wrench

>go west
 The sliding doors open as you approach them, allowing you to enter the
 hall.

 Steamy Passage
 Several of the thick pipes from the power plant run through this brief
 north-south hallway.  Three of them appear to have developed cracks
 over the years, as they are swathed in clouds of steam that trail
 upwards and disappear into a vent on the ceiling.  Fortunately, none of
 the steam completely obstructs movement to either the doorway to your
 north or the automated sliding doors to the east.

 The Geiger counter is alive with noise.  The combination of static and
 its deafening alarm are nearly deafening.  The display has flashing red
 arrows pointing in all directions.

 Okay, you're now standing on the aluminum ladder.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

 Power Plant
 Every molecule of your body seems to vibrate in tune with the great
 turbines of the fusion generator that sits before you.  What you can
 see of it is an imposing edifice, slightly curved as if you are seeing
 one small section of a very large ring.  Massive pipes and conduits
 link to the power plant from numerous angles, connecting at multiple
 points on its surface.  Anchored to the ground beside the fusion
 generator is a console with controls and several small screens.  You
 also spot a gray breaker box nestled among one bundle of wires.  To the
 east is an open doorway, and south of this room is a corridor shrouded
 in vapor.  The room is filled with the grotesque bluish glow of the
 overhead fluorescents.

 The breaker box contains a circuit breaker.

 This large control console is fastened to the floor right in front of
 the fusion generator.  Along the left side are a number of screens,
 displaying information about the status of the power plant.  To the

 which are clearly labeled.  At the top is a red button marked "CYCLE",
 followed by a white one with "START UP" written beside it.  Below them,
 a black button labeled "SHUTDOWN", a blue one marked "VENT", and a
 green button indicated as "SHUNT".  The rest of the controls are beyond
 your comprehension.

>go east
 Third Floor Hallway
 Here the walls, floor, and even the air all seem to be permeated by a
 deep, resonating hum.  A faint odor also catches your attention:  the
 scent of ozone laced with a hint of something burning.  The hall,
 however, doesn't appear to contain anything out of the ordinary.
 Beside the stairway to the north that leads up to a security door,
 there are automated doors to the east and south, plus an entryway to
 the west.  The room is filled with the grotesque bluish glow of the
 overhead fluorescents.

>examine screen
 This fusion generator has been running for over a hundred years, though
 it doesn't look like it will last much longer.  You're no nuclear
 physicist, but judging by these warnings in big red letters, the lack
 of regular maintenance has taken its toll on the mechanisms of the
 plant.  While the fuel reservoirs are still in the green, the coolant
 levels are practically empty, there are an alarming number of shorted
 circuits across the facility, and the electromagnetic bottle containing
 the superheated plasma is on the verge of collapsing.  However, the
 readings don't give you any indication of when a failure might occur.

 The tingly sensation seems to be lessening.

 As soon as you bush the button, the vibrations in the room begin to
 subside.  Then as quickly as they started to fade, the vibrations
 return and you can't help but notice that they are increasing in
 intensity.  In fact, the oscillations become so violent that you can
 barely keep to your feet.  As several pipes burst open under the
 stress, spraying out superheated jets of gas, you try to scramble out
 of the room.  Unfortunately, a pipe directly above you splits open,
 washing you in a violently corrosive substance.  You survive just long
 enough to discover an entirely new definition of pain.

 your footprints in the dust and ivory walls frame this hallway that
 leads east and west.  Directly to the north is a flight of steps
 leading upwards to the first floor.  The security door in the south
 wall is very similar to the one you encountered above, including the

 keeping it in its original condition.  The metal grating beneath your

 numerous scuff marks, gouges and, in several places, lewd and explicit
 graffiti.  The hallway continues east and west, with an exit north and
 a door to the south.  That door, you notice, has a number of variations

 Base Entrance
 At first glance, this might look like a normal clearing in the brush.
 Tall grass fills in the open space between the taller vegetation,
 broken only by a path leading northwest.  However, the wide
 concrete-lined chasm leading down into the ground is a clear indication
 that this clearing was, at least initially, the result of human labor.
 The opening is square, with a series of cement steps leading down to
 the south, ending at a metal-framed doorway.  The concrete surface
 extends for several feet around the entryway in a wide rectangle.  On
 the edge of this short plateau, directly in front of the stairs, is a
 small campfire and, beside it, a bedroll.

 On the ground you can see a lantern.

 Large bushes line the path, struggling to survive in this harsh

 east and south, thorny brambles impede your movement in most other

 numerous scuff marks, gouges and, in several places, lewd and explicit
 graffiti.  The hallway continues east and west, with an exit north and
 a door to the south.  That door, you notice, has a number of variations
 on "out of order" scribbled across its surface.  On the wall beside it
 is a small panel.

 The door to the south appears to have been blasted open.  The thick
 steel is buckled and scorched.

 Whirling red lights and warning alarms fill the corridor.  Confused and
 directionless raiders run through the halls, searching vainly for the
 cause.  You seem to go completely unnoticed.

 This room reeks of panic and confusion.

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be
 concerned about.

>go north
 Base Entrance
 At first glance, this might look like a normal clearing in the brush.
 Tall grass fills in the open space between the taller vegetation,
 broken only by a path leading northwest.  However, the wide
 concrete-lined chasm leading down into the ground is a clear indication
 that this clearing was, at least initially, the result of human labor.
 The opening is square, with a series of cement steps leading down to
 the south, ending at a metal-framed doorway.  The concrete surface
 extends for several feet around the entryway in a wide rectangle.  On
 the edge of this short plateau, directly in front of the stairs, is a
 small campfire and, beside it, a bedroll.

 On the ground you can see a lantern.

>take lantern
 Taken.

>go north
 You can head along the path to the northwest or down the steps to the
 south.

>go northwest
 Faded Path
 This grassy walkway winds through the thick dry underbrush and trees,
 coming in from the north and changing directions several times before
 straightening out and continuing to the southeast.  This area too is
 eerily quiet, without even the usual chirping of nocturnal insects.
 Large bushes line the path, struggling to survive in this harsh
 landscape.  To the southeast, you can make out a bright, flickering
 light from what appears to be a campfire.

>go north
 Clearing
 Browned vegetation encircles this patch of flat dusty ground.  Scraggly
 brush and thickets wave slowly in the glow of your flashlight.  The
 rustling of branches is the only sound you hear; the area seems eerily
 devoid of any other noise, even crickets.  Though you can make your way
 east and south, thorny brambles impede your movement in most other
 directions.  An opening to the west leads back towards Arcadia, and a
 small gap leads southwest through the thickets.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

>go southwest
 You manage to crawl along the trail through the brambles with only
 minor scratches.

 Hidden Path
 This is the end of a very convoluted and twisted path through several
 hundred feet of frighteningly thorny briar patch.  The track is
 extremely difficult to see, especially at night, and you know you never
 would have found your way without help.  It heads back into the thicket
 to your northeast, the only footpath leading from this small open field
 among the brambles.  In the middle of the small clearing is a square
 metal structure, about two feet long on each side and protruding a
 couple of inches from the ground.  This box is topped by a metal
 grating held on by rusty latches.

 Iona is standing close beside you.  She smiles broadly.

 Like an unexpected cool breeze cutting through a stifling desert heat,
 pure and innocent emotions roll over you from the little girl.  You
 feel curiosity and loneliness mixed with confusion and fear.

 Your Geiger counter chitters quietly.

>iona, follow me
 Iona bites her lip and looks at you for a moment, then takes your hand.

 In a total of 561 turns, you have achieved a score of 11 points out of

 You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be

 Iona pokes you in the leg and grins when you look down at her.

>go west
 You hurriedly begin the arduous journey back home, Iona in tow.  You
 are amazed to find that she hardly slows you down.  She obviously comes
 from tough stock.  The helmet you keep tucked safely within your
 survival pack.  Moving as quickly as you can, you rush from the base in
 search of shelter.  When you come across a series of cliffs you waste
 no time in taking refuge behind them.  And not a moment too soon.  The
 sky erupts in dazzling light, followed quickly by thunderous shockwave.
 A brilliant mushroom cloud rises up over the location of the research
 facility as its reactor goes critical.  The two of you spend several
 hours in the shadow, then make your way towards the awaiting city of
 Arcadia.

 [Your score has just gone up by 1 point.]

 The return trip takes slightly longer than the first leg of the
 journey, though you soon find yourself gazing upon the Cyclopean
 structures of your home city.  The guards scrutinize yourself and young
 Iona, but within no time you find yourself once again walking Arcadia's
 decaying streets.








 South Gate
 The high cement wall of Arcadia stretches as far as you can see to the
 east and west.  Directly south of you, at the end of the street, lies
 the massive gate that leads out of the city and into the wasteland.
 This entrance stays guarded at all times; the familiar shapes of
 armor-clad Enforcers are visible in the lookout posts above and the
 squat bunkers on either side the street.  Howe Street draws a dark path
 in the opposite direction, further into the city.

 Iona is standing close beside you.  She smiles broadly.

 A brief burst of noise comes from your Geiger counter but it quickly
 falls silent again.

>go north
 Howe Street, Arcadia
 The few street lights that still work on this run down section of road
 do little to dispel the everpresent gloom of the city.  Even in the
 middle of the day the sun is barely more than a faint glow in the thick
 clouds above.  The street itself is ancient crumbling asphalt; they
 simply don't maintain the roads this far from the city core.  This one
 heads north, back towards your meager home, and south, out of the city.
 A cross street leads east towards CyTek Corporation's main compound,
 and a small merchant shop you know well sits among derelict buildings
 to the west.

 Iona follows close behind.

>go north
 Your journey has come full circle, now with your final decision made.
 The technology of a century past will remain in your hands.  You and
 Iona return to your meager dwelling, where you place the helmet on the
 bed, and simply stare at it.  Your mission was a success, and though
 you did not find the riches you'd hoped by selling the device to a
 corporation, you begin to believe that maybe, just maybe, you'll be
 able to do better on your own:  just you and your newly adopted
 daughter Iona.  You aren't sure what comes next, but the one thing you
 are sure about is that your life as a scavenger is over.

>go east
 With some trepidation, you head down the cross street towards CyTek,
 Iona trailing closely behind you.  The process is familiar to you and
 every other scavenger.  The pitch.  The demonstration.  The
 negotiation.  And, finally, the sale.  The only real difference this
 time is the expression of shock on the agent's face...  and the size of
 the purse.  With some effort, you put out of your mind thoughts of what
 exactly CyTek plans to do with the technology you've delivered to them.
 That's none of your concern, is it?  All you know is that with this
 money, Iona and yourself will live quite comfortably for some time.

>notes

 As I stated in my readme file, Scavenger grew out of an idea for a
 short story I had.  The game itself was not meant to be particularly
 focused on any one particular style, but a mix of puzzles, exploration,
 and atmosphere.  I began working on the game in September of 2002 while
 waiting for the release of the 2002 IF Competition games.  Most of the
 code was finished by November, and the next several months were spent
 polishing and reacting to the input from testers.

 The Infocom game that probably made the biggest impression on me in my
 youth was Planetfall, which probably comes as no surprise now that
 you've played Scavenger.  There are likely more parallels than even I
 realize.

 As I play through various "modern" IF from the past 10 years, I'm
 learning how some ideas repeat themselves.  While playing the well-made
 game "Babel", I was rather sadly surprised to find a
 block-door-with-pole puzzle nearly identical to my own, and at a point
 where my game was effectively finished.  Not relishing the thought of
 rewriting of one of the few major puzzles, I decided to simply leave it
 (and the Babel-ish corroded door hinges) in and throw myself on the
 mercy of the court.  Great minds think alike and all that, right?
 Ironically, I then found a review of "Babel" that criticized it for
 duplicating a central idea found in the game "Delusions".  I guess it's
 just the nature of the beast.  There are so many amateur works of
 interactive fiction now floating around the internet that no author can
 be expected to have played them all.  I'm sure as I play though the
 archive of games I'll come across one that's pretty much identical to
 the idea for my next game, forcing me to smash my computer with a
 crowbar.  Ah well.

 Unbelievable.  This could very well be it.  The big score.

 Every scavenger dreams of that one discovery that will grant riches
 beyond the dreams of avarice.  Every scavenger envisions walking into
 the hidden chamber of some pre-war military compound or corporate R&D
 facility and finding the forgotten secrets of humanity's genius.  Of
 course, you can count the number of times it's happened on one hand.
 While everyone in your line of work wishes for it, no one really
 expects it to happen.  That included you.

 Until you found the scrap of paper, that is.

 Charlie's Shop
 It's not the selection that keeps bringing you back.  It's just the
 convenient location.  Plus you and Charlie have known each other for a
 few years now so he gives you a bit of a discount.  He can usually be
 counted on to have what you need.  The store itself is fairly small,
 just a single room.  Charlie leans against a glass countertop that
 doubles as a display case, flipping through one of the Arcadia
 newspapers with a bored expression on his face.

 The display case contains a hand grenade, a rifle, a silenced pistol,
 some radiation pills, a GPS unit, and a laser gun.

 Charlie nods in your direction.  "Welcome back."

 You weren't really expecting anything, were you?  It just doesn't fit

 Oh come on, don't tell me you're disappointed.  I know, I know, you
 were expecting some hilarious little blip, or the Spanish Inquisition,
 or something. Well, no, not the Spanish Inquisition, because no one
 ever expects them.  But I'm sitting here as I write this, watching
 television and stuffing barbeque potato chips into my mouth, and
 absolutely nothing humorous is coming to mind.  So...  hey, maybe next

 at you.

>shoot charlie with rifle
 You hesitate, realizing that such a course of action may not be
 entirely wise.

>shoot charlie with rifle
 Charlie's look of surprise is quickly replaced by a grimace of pain as
 the bullet tears into him.  He falls back behind the case, and you hear
 a distinct 'click!'  as he disappears from view.  Suddenly a wall of
 iron bars falls across the doorway, accompanied by a deafening alarm.

>throw grenade e
 You can't throw the hand grenade in that direction.

>go south
 South Gate
 The high cement wall of Arcadia stretches as far as you can see to the
 east and west.  Directly south of you, at the end of the street, lies
 the massive gate that leads out of the city and into the wasteland.
 This entrance stays guarded at all times; the familiar shapes of
 armor-clad Enforcers are visible in the lookout posts above and the
 squat bunkers on either side the street.  Howe Street draws a dark path
 in the opposite direction, further into the city.

>throw grenade at enforcers
 The hand grenade lands on the ground near The Enforcers.  The grenade
 arms as its safety lever goes flying.

 Those bright flashes coming from the openings in the bunkers can only
 be muzzle flashes.  The thunderous weapon reports seem oddly distant,
 though, as you crumple to the ground.

>put pin in grenade
 You put the pin back into the grenade, making it again safe to release.

>oh well
 I don't know the word "oh".

>shoot me
 What do you want to shoot it with?

>shoot me with rifle
 Waves of despair overcome you.  You'll never succeed, you're a failure,
 nobody loves you, everybody hates you, etc.  You place the end of the
 short barrel into your mouth and pull the trigger.

>go north
 Howe Street, Arcadia
 The few street lights that still work on this run down section of road
 do little to dispel the everpresent gloom of the city.  Even in the
 middle of the day the sun is barely more than a faint glow in the thick
 clouds above.  The street itself is ancient crumbling asphalt; they
 simply don't maintain the roads this far from the city core.  This one
 heads north, back towards your meager home, and south, out of the city.
 A cross street leads east towards CyTek Corporation's main compound,
 and a small merchant shop you know well sits among derelict buildings
 to the west.

 You yank the pin out of the grenade.
