 Aotearoa can make use of emphasized keywords to indicate objects you
 can interact with. It is recommended that your interpreter program
 correctly displays them with some form of emphasis, although it is not
 strictly required. Type a number below to cycle through display options

 Polynesian Character Display Test:   *+ LM jk

 If the characters above are vowels with horizontal lines over them,
 your interpreter can properly display the special letters in this
 story. If not, you will need to change your interpreter's font to one
 that supports Polynesian characters. If you know your font already
 supports such characters, you may need to consider switching to an
 alternative interpreter.

 Interpreters known to function correctly with Aotearoa include (but are
 not limited to):

 Gargoyle (the 2009-08-25 build or newer)
 Zoom 1.1.4 or newer
 Filfre 0.987 or newer
 Quixe 1.0.2 or newer (using the CSS provided at
 [<A HREF="http://www.wigdahl.net/Aotearoa">LINK</A>] or the IFComp website)
 Other browsers based on Glulxe 0.4.4 or newer or Git 1.2.4 or newer
 should work as well.

 Fonts known to render well include (but, again, are not limited to):

 Linux Libertine (free for download and recommended if you have it)
 Georgia
 Palatino Linotype
 Times New Roman

 Known issues: The older, 2009-08-25 build of Gargoyle, out of the box,
 defaults to the Charter BT font, which is known to not support
 Polynesian characters. This can be fixed by changing the font settings
 in the garglk.ini configuration file to point to a font (such as one of
 the ones above) that does support the characters. The newest (2010.1)
 build of Gargoyle does not have this problem as it uses Linux Libertine
 by default.  And although Filfre supports the proper characters out of
 the box, it doesn't render them correctly. Regardless of the
 interpreter you use, you may need to configure it for best appearance.

 The waka floats in the deep ocean, the sun motionless and searing in
 the clear sky. Mui, the trickster, casts his fishing line into the
 depths of the ocean, tied to his magic hook made from a human jawbone.
 Almost immediately the hook catches, and he pulls up an enormous fish
 that somehow becomes, as you watch, an entire continent. On that new
 continent magnificent dinosaurs -- taniwha -- prowl the dark forests.
 Volcanoes dim the sky with smoke and stain the air with the stench of
 sulfur, but the land is rich and fertile, and Mui's older brothers
 look on it with greed in their eyes. Mui watches them, deep in
 thought, with a faraway expression you can't read. Then he turns to
 look directly into your eyes, and says, "You know that some of my
 brothers cannot be trusted. You must keep them from carving up this
 great fish until I return from the gods with the proper karakia."

 And suddenly he's gone, flying away into the sun in the form of a
 seabird, and you're left floating in the waka with Mui's brothers as
 they smile secret half-smiles to each other and reach for their knives,
 and you wonder what in the world Mui thinks that you, twelve-year-old
 Tim Cooper, can do to stop them before they carve up and defile...

 Aotearoa
 An Interactive Adventure by Matt Wigdahl

 6/12N)
 Difficulty Level: Introductory            Cruelty Level: Polite

 *** First-time players should type ABOUT ***

 A hand gently shakes your shoulder, and the in-flight magazine falls
 off your chest as you startle awake. "Sorry, Tim. We've arrived," the
 stewardess says, and passes on. But the dreams don't leave with her,
 and the rest of the trip passes in a haze: the terminal; the tall Mori
 man with fierce tattoos on his face who greets you on arrival; the trip
 through unfamiliar streets to a Conservation Service cutter. In a way
 it's a good thing. If you had to think about what you're getting
 yourself into, you might be too afraid to go through with it. You stand
 on the prow of the small ship, fear and excitement swirling around
 inside you so you can hardly tell them apart. You're going to see real,
 live dinosaurs, and that's great, but you're alone and afraid, and
 nothing is familiar here, and that's... not great.

 The man, Eruera, walks up to stand beside you, taking in the same view,
 shading his eyes with a powerful hand as he looks forward. The whipping
 ocean wind tries to carry his words away, and his accent is thick, but
 he has a friendly, open smile. "Don't worry about your flight getting
 delayed. We'll catch you up to the other group in no time." He studies
 your face, sees the concern. "Come now, you must be excited to start,
 yes? Everyone is! You are ready to work?"

 Excitement gets the upper hand for now and you grin just a bit -- you
 can't help it. "I still can't believe I got picked to come! I get to
 see real dinosaurs? That's so cool!"

 Eruera laughs, a startling, wild sound. "You may not think it is quite
 so 'cool' after picking through dinosaur roka for a few days, Tim."

 You cock your head a bit, not quite sure you understood. "Roka"?

 He just looks back at you silently, the friendly grin growing a bit
 wider.

 Oh.

 The Prow
 The cutter's hydrofoil brings the ship high out of the water -- high
 enough that there's very little spray. The wind whips past as the boat
 glides across the ocean off the coast to port. Thick, deep green bands
 of forest snake along the coastline to port. The treeline tracks
 stretches of black sand beach, sharp cliffs of dark volcanic rock, and
 the occasional salt marsh. The ocean glares as you look at the shore,
 almost overpoweringly blue.

 A dark feather from some sort of seabird flutters in the wind, caught
 in a small gap in the guardrail.

 You hear an incomprehensible yell from the general direction of the
 bridge. Eruera turns toward it, then closes his eyes for an instant. "I
 told them to double-check those gaskets," he sighs. "I'd better go help
 them before we're dead in the water."

 He starts to leave, then turns back to you for a moment. "Why don't you
 head to the bridge? They've got sandwiches in there; I'm sure you're
 hungry after all your traveling. I'll catch up with you after I sort
 things out below decks."

 Eruera sprints off to aft.

 Aotearoa is an interactive fiction adventure story, designed to be fun
 for all ages!

 "Interactive Fiction" is a kind of writing that puts you, the reader,
 into the story as the main character! You make the decisions as to what
 your character will do and where to go by typing in instructions to the
 next, tell you what happens, and then give you a chance to type in
 another instruction. Play continues in this way until you reach an end
 to the story. But remember that there might be several different
 endings, and some may be better, more successful, or more fun endings
 than others. You can always try different decisions in the story to try
 to reach different endings.

 If you have never played an interactive fiction story before, please
 read the "Instructions for Play" section in the main help menu for much
 more detailed advice on how to play and what kinds of commands the
 computer can understand.

 Aotearoa takes place in an alternate history where the ancient
 continent of Zealandia never sank below the waves in the late
 Cretaceous period, and retains its Mori name of Aotearoa. Many
 prehistoric and other extinct animals still live on the continent --
 including dinosaurs! And you, as the character of 12-year-old Tim
 Cooper, will have a chance to visit and interact with them!

 Please note -- although the game depicts a fictional continent of
 Zealandia, and dinosaurs are involved in the game, great effort was
 made to remain faithful to the history and geography of the real New
 Zealand where possible, and to present an accurate picture of the
 language and culture of the Mori people. We hope you have fun and
 learn something new (maybe several somethings new) at the same time!

 For the most part, the standard IF verbs apply, but there are a few
 extra actions you can take that are fairly non-standard:

 RIDE will allow you to attempt to ride a vehicle or animal.
 Once you are on an animal, you can control it by trying to go FASTER or
 SLOWER, or turn LEFT or RIGHT.
 NAME will allow you to give an animal a nickname that will then be used
 in the text and be recognized by the parser.
 UNNAME will allow you to remove a nickname from an animal that already
 has one.

 Additional meta-commands (commands that help you control the game
 without affecting the game world) are:

 THINGS will print out a list of all the items in the area that you
 might be able to interact with. Note that this will also include
 scenery and other things that only support limited interaction.
 EXITS prints out a list of the directions you can go from the area
 you're in.
 EXIT COLOR rotates through the available colors for the status line
 exit lister.
 EXITS OFF turns off the status line exit lister altogether.
 EXITS ON turns the status line exit lister back on.
 KEYWORDS brings up a menu that lets you change how object and topic
 keywords are presented.
 TUTORIAL MODE OFF turns off the built-in tutorial.
 TUTORIAL MODE ON turns on the built-in tutorial.
 SKIP will make the tutorial system skip the current step and move on to
 the next one.

 The Prow
 The cutter's hydrofoil brings the ship high out of the water -- high
 enough that there's very little spray. The wind whips past as the boat
 glides across the ocean off the coast to port. Thick, deep green bands
 of forest snake along the coastline to port. The treeline tracks
 stretches of black sand beach, sharp cliffs of dark volcanic rock, and
 the occasional salt marsh. The ocean glares as you look at the shore,
 almost overpoweringly blue.

 The Stern
 The stern of the cutter is well-organized and uncluttered; all of the
 stores and supplies are stashed below. The deck and guardrail are
 painted white, and are almost too bright to focus upon in the sun. A
 small door leads inside to the bridge, and a rectangular opening in the
 deck leads down a steep ladder into the hold.

>in
 The Bridge
 The cutter's small bridge looks like it also serves as a living room
 and smoking lounge. The ship's controls are laid out on a cluttered
 panel to forward, under a wide, grimy window. A low side table stands
 by the door, food trash surrounding an overflowing, smoldering ashtray.
 A few chairs are scattered around as well. A door leads outside and a
 ladder leads down into the crew quarters.

 The captain fidgets with his fingers unconsciously.

 The captain acknowledges your arrival with a glance and a grunt, then
 turns back to his instruments. "Help yourself to a sandwich. I think
 there's one left."

>examine sandwich
 is, or even what it's made of. The bread is brown and it looks edible,
 at least in theory.

>take it

>eat it
 sandwich head-on and take a bite. Surprisingly, it's tasty, and you
 make short work of the rest of it.

>talk to captain

 "What do you want, tama?"

 (You could ask him about himself, the sandwich, Eruera, the coastal
 cutter, the dinosaurs, or Aotearoa.)

>ask captain about sandwich

 The captain looks at you for a moment and frowns, trying to decide if
 you expect a response, and if so, what it should be. He finally decides
 against saying anything and shakes his head as he turns away.

>ask him about aotearoa
 here before."

 "Well, that's obvious, son." He smiles, then starts talking, gesturing
 expansively with his hands.

 "Aotearoa -- 'The Land of the Long Cloud'! You're just offshore of the
 closest place to Paradise on the face of the Earth, kid. The one place
 the British couldn't conquer when they were colonizing the world -- we
 Mori toa fought them to a standstill and they settled for an alliance
 as equals."

 He laughs as he continues, "Even the giant meteor that killed the
 dinosaurs all over the world couldn't defeat the taniwha of Aotearoa!
 All the dinosaurs left in the world live right here." He sweeps his
 hands to indicate the coastline moving past outside the window, then
 turns back to the controls.

>ask captain about dinosaurs

 The captain laughs. "'Have I seen a big one?', of course you mean. The
 taniwha are not as common as the television documentaries would have
 you believe, boy. But yes, I've seen several of the horned ones. Even
 though they are plant-eaters, they are still fearsome."

>ask captain about eruera

 The captain turns to you. "Eruera? I don't know him well, except by
 reputation. He's supposed to be a quite a toa -- a warrior. Served in
 the ADF before transferring to the Conservation Service."

>ask him about himself
 "Who are you?" you ask.

 The captain responds. "I'm Captain Hunapo, the captain of the ANS
 Whakamarumaru."

 He grins as you try to mouth the name of the ship. "It means
 'protector'."

>ask captain about cutter

 The captain grimaces. "This decrepit old tub is the Whakamarumaru. It's
 an old hydrofoil design; one of the first they ever made. It's fast and
 maneuverable, but we have a devil of a time keeping it running."

 The sounds of annoyed crewmen arguing in Mori rise from the lower
 deck.

>topics
 cutter, the dinosaurs, or Aotearoa.

>ask captain about cutter

 The captain shakes his head. "Oil leak. A big one. We just overhauled
 the engine, but one of the gaskets blew out. It might have been bad to
 start with."

 He raises his voice to include the ladder below, if they can hear him
 over the sound of clanking tools and Mori curse words. "More likely,
 one of those mhunga wai screwed it up when they installed it!"

>ask captain about aotearoa
 interested in the..."

 He cuts you off with a jerk of his hand. "The taniwha, I know. You
 don't have to be a mind-reader to see that. I already gave you the
 basics. Aotearoa isn't someplace you can be told about. If you want to
 know more you'll find out for yourself in about an hour."

 Something seems to bother the captain. He peers more closely at a
 control on the console, then mutters darkly to himself.

>examine console

>things
 radio, the radar, the grimy window, the bridge door, the crew ladder,
 the chair, the side table, the ashtray, the captain, the speaker
 grille, the cigarette butts, the deck, the coastal cutter, the ocean,
 the forest, the beach, the cliffs, the salt marsh, the coastline, the
 dinosaurs, the seabird, the wind, and the clouds.

>examine controls
 figure them out.

 The captain checks the controls, then gives a grunt of apparent
 satisfaction.

>ask captain about cutter

 "What do you want, the technical manuals? You looking to take my job?
 This tub will get you to the campsite in another hour -- that's all you
 need to know!"

>ask him about crewmen

 "Yes yes," he says brusquely. "I don't have time to discuss that right
 now."

 (You could ask him about himself, the sandwich, Eruera, the coastal
 cutter, the dinosaurs, or Aotearoa.)

 Something seems to bother the captain. He peers more closely at a
 control on the console, then mutters darkly to himself.

>ask him about sandwich
 think that asking him about the sandwich yet again isn't a particularly
 good idea.

 The captain checks the controls, then gives a grunt of apparent
 satisfaction.

>out
 can't understand, and turns back to the controls.

 The Stern
 The stern of the cutter is well-organized and uncluttered; all of the
 stores and supplies are stashed below. The deck and guardrail are
 painted white, and are almost too bright to focus upon in the sun. A
 small door leads inside to the bridge, and a rectangular opening in the
 deck leads down a steep ladder into the hold.

 You notice clouds gathering as you leave the bridge -- maybe there's a
 storm coming. As you take a few steps out onto the stern deck, you hear
 shouts from behind you. Almost immediately, the captain yells as well,
 calling you back. "Hey, you... Kid! Whatever your name was... Come back
 here! I've got a job for you."

 It doesn't seem quite so hot any more.

>in
 The Bridge
 The cutter's small bridge looks like it also serves as a living room
 and smoking lounge. The ship's controls are laid out on a cluttered
 panel to forward, under a wide, grimy window. A low side table stands
 by the door, food trash surrounding an overflowing, smoldering ashtray.
 A few chairs are scattered around as well. A door leads outside and a
 ladder leads down into the crew quarters.

 The captain paces impatiently.

 The captain half-turns towards you. "You! Make yourself useful and grab
 the hyperbolic torsion spanner from the hold. Those mhunga wai down
 there forgot it."

>exits

>ask about spanner
 The captain spares you a quick glance. He looks your possessions over,
 then frowns. "Didn't I ask you to go get the hyperbolic torsion
 spanner? When I ask you to do something, I expect you to move, sailor!"

 You must supply a noun.

 A sudden beeping from the radar attracts the captain's attention. He
 glances at the screen for a moment, then clicks his tongue.

>ask captain about spanner
 you. "I'll talk to you after you bring me the hyperbolic torsion
 spanner like I asked you. Not before."

>examine radar
 Green lines indicate the position of the shore. If there were other
 ships nearby you'd assume that they would also appear, but there don't
 seem to be any at the moment.

 Something seems to bother the captain. He peers more closely at a
 control on the console, then mutters darkly to himself.

 The Stern
 The stern of the cutter is well-organized and uncluttered; all of the
 stores and supplies are stashed below. The deck and guardrail are
 painted white, gleaming in the alternating patches of sun and shade as
 the cutter passes under the gathering clouds. A small door leads inside
 to the bridge, and a rectangular opening in the deck leads down a steep
 ladder into the hold.

>go down
 The Hold
 The hold's ceiling is frighteningly low, even for you. The space is
 cramped and hot, and the relentless, overpowering drone of the cutter's
 engine is almost unbearable here. The hold is mostly packed full of
 crates, probably containing supplies for the various Conservation
 Service camps in the Protected Lands. Near the stern there's a clear
 area with a pegboard mounted on the wall. The pegboard holds tools and
 supplies that the crew members use, and a ladder leads up.

 Your school backpack leans against against one the crates, looking out
 of place.

>examine backpack
 cheap, nylon Camp Rock backpack more suited to the homeroom coat rack
 -- for a third grade girl, maybe -- than the Aotearoan bush. At least
 she tried.

 In the backpack are your acceptance letter, your passport, your lucky
 rabbit's foot, your photographs, and Aotearoa 4 Kids!.

 One of the crates shifts slightly, startling you.

>examine aotearoa
 when your acceptance letter came in. She was really proud of you. The
 book is huge -- at least 400 pages -- and covers everything from
 history and politics to geography and wildlife. You've probably read it
 all the way through five times by now, trying to prepare yourself for
 this trip. You leaf through the familiar pages a bit distractedly,
 refreshing your memory a bit about the requirements for getting a
 driver's license.

 The hot, humid atmosphere of the hold is almost overpowering.

>examine crates
 canvas straps. They come in several different sizes, but most appear to
 be cubes and measure around four or five feet on a side.

>listen to crates

 The tools and equipment clatter as the cutter lurches a bit.

>examine photographs
 first day of second grade. The memories return, sharp and clear. When
 Mom was still alive, she always knew how to make things right, stand
 you back up when you fell. Even when you broke your arm skateboarding
 she talked you into riding again...

 The hot, humid atmosphere of the hold is almost overpowering.

>examine letter
 you that you've been selected for the Junior Fieldwork Program. Who
 knew writing an essay about "What Conservation Means to Me" would lead
 to this? Only 100 kids total per year from all over the world get
 chosen, and you were one of them! Of course, you're also the only one
 that missed his connecting flight and has to catch up with the rest,
 too...

>get backpack

 The Stern
 The stern of the cutter is well-organized and uncluttered; all of the
 stores and supplies are stashed below. The deck and guardrail are
 painted white, gleaming in the alternating patches of sun and shade as
 the cutter passes under the gathering clouds. A small door leads inside
 to the bridge, and a rectangular opening in the deck leads down a steep
 ladder into the hold.

 You fumble the tools around as you walk. They're so bulky that it's
 hard to keep hold of all of them at once, but you manage somehow.

 White seabirds pace the cutter for a while, then wheel away.

 The Bridge
 The cutter's small bridge looks like it also serves as a living room
 and smoking lounge. The ship's controls are laid out on a cluttered
 panel to forward, under a wide, grimy window. A low side table stands
 by the door, food trash surrounding an overflowing, smoldering ashtray.
 A few chairs are scattered around as well. A door leads outside and a
 ladder leads down into the crew quarters.

 The captain drums his fingers on the console.

 The captain turns and notices you holding the hyperbolic torsion
 spanner, and reaches to take it. "Thanks, son... Took you long enough,
 though. Now put the other ones back." He then turns and yells down the
 ladder to the lower deck.

 "Hey, mhunga wai! Here's the hyperbolic torsion spanner!" He tosses it
 down the ladder. You hear a yelp of pain, followed by a clatter as the
 tool falls to the deck. The captain mutters, shakes his head, and
 returns to work.

 The radio erupts with a quick burst of staticky conversation, which the
 captain ignores. You can't make out a single word.

 thickened quickly -- it's now quite dark, except for brief, dim sparks
 of internal lightning that flicker deep within the clouds. Eruera pops
 his head up from the staircase. "Is that you, Tim? Hold on a second..."
 He looks down and waves someone on, then turns back to you. "Good! I
 think we are almost done here -- I will meet you on the prow when we
 are finished. That will keep you a bit more out of the way while we
 test whether the repair will hold under pressure." He vanishes back
 down the ladder.

 The captain checks the controls, then gives a grunt of apparent
 satisfaction.

 The sounds of annoyed crewmen arguing in Mori rise from the lower
 deck.

 A sudden beeping from the radar attracts the captain's attention. He
 glances at the screen for a moment, then clicks his tongue.

 The Stern
 The stern of the cutter is well-organized and uncluttered; all of the
 stores and supplies are stashed below. The deck and guardrail are
 painted white, helping you to see them under the shade of the gathering
 storm clouds. A small door leads inside to the bridge, and a
 rectangular opening in the deck leads down a steep ladder into the
 hold.

>go down
 The Hold
 The hold's ceiling is frighteningly low, even for you. The space is
 cramped and hot, and the relentless, overpowering drone of the cutter's
 engine is almost unbearable here. The hold is mostly packed full of
 crates, probably containing supplies for the various Conservation
 Service camps in the Protected Lands. Near the stern there's a clear
 area with a pegboard mounted on the wall. The pegboard holds tools and
 supplies that the crew members use, and a ladder leads up.

 The Prow
 The cutter's hydrofoil brings the ship high out of the water -- high
 enough that there's very little spray. The wind whips past as the boat
 glides across the ocean off the coast to port. Gathering clouds dim the
 light, almost hiding the dark green bands of thick forest snaking along
 the coastline's inky beach and charcoal cliffs to port.

 You spend a couple of minutes looking out over the ocean, watching the
 waves rise as dim lightning glows in the depths of the stormclouds and
 distant booms of thunder shake the air. It's a breathtaking scene, and
 for a moment you don't notice Eruera pushing through the wind from aft
 to stand beside you. He watches the approaching storm in silence with
 you for a moment as the light dims. "It looks like quite an wh coming
 our way. Perhaps you should come back in to the bridge before it hits.
 I would hate for you to get soaked and miserable before we even get to
 camp."

 You consider it as the sky darkens further. It's not a bad idea. But as
 you start to agree, Eruera snaps his head up, startled by something in
 the distance to port, and cuts you off with a raised hand. "Tim, did
 you see..."

 Without warning, he seizes you in a powerful grip! In one smooth motion
 he wrenches you off of your feet and pitches you over the starboard
 railing, so quickly you don't even have time for a scream before you're
 tumbling towards the sea, arms pinwheeling. Just before you hit the
 water you catch a single brief glimpse of Eruera poised to leap, one
 hand on the railing and a wide-eyed look of panic on his face. Then you
 plunge into the ocean with a stinging jolt, seawater jetting up your
 nose and your limbs painfully forced into unnatural positions by the
 water's drag.

 As you tumble and slow, there's a terribly loud crash of thunder. You
 flounder, stunned, trying to remember your swimming survival lessons.
 By the time you orient yourself and manage to look around, it's all
 over. But everything has changed. The cutter is half-submerged and
 leaning way over on its side, a huge, ragged hole punched in its port
 side near the stern. Twisted pieces of deck and the remains of crates
 are strewn over the ocean, visible in brief peeks over the rolling
 waves.

 But even though the panic rises up and your breathing is shallow and
 fast, you know you have to stay afloat. You start paddling toward the
 ship, but before you can cover even half the distance it has sunk low
 in the water and you realize there's no point -- it will be gone before
 you can reach it.

 You tread water for a moment as you look around, thrashing your legs
 wildly to keep your head above water and continuing to force down the
 panic. It seems you've gotten turned around somehow -- which way was
 the coast?

 In the Ocean
 You are treading water alone in the ocean as a sudden summer storm
 drenches your face with sheets of rain. Lightning flashes and
 sledgehammers of thunder batter your ears as you try to get your
 bearings. The slightly acrid taste of engine oil mixed with seawater
 seeps into your mouth and makes you want to constantly spit; the bad
 taste and the floating debris are the only reminders that there was a
 ship with a living crew skimming over this water just minutes ago. The
 rise and fall of the ocean waves all around you limit how far you can
 see, and the storm blocks out the summer sun like an eclipse.

 In the confusion, you lose your grip on what you were holding, and
 everything is swept away in the fury of the storm. Even the backpack is
 lost, the cheap straps ripping away as you hit the water.

 much after a while. You duck your head underwater, trying to gain a few
 moments of silence. But you can't see anything while submerged in the
 dark and you soon surface back into the chaos of the storm, gasping for
 breath.

 Something bumps you from below. You thrash away from it, wasting
 energy. You're not sure if you moved very far, but whatever it was is
 apparently gone. At least, it isn't bothering you at the moment.

 like a life vest.

 You see something at the limit of your vision -- something that looks
 like a floating crate. And you hear something -- Dad? How could that
 be? Unless... you're already dead, or dying... "Tim, over here, buddy!"

 That's Dad's voice, all right -- you can hear him clearly, even over
 the deafening storm!

>get on crate

 You see something at the limit of your vision -- something that looks
 like a floating crate. Despite the fury of the storm, you can hear a
 voice calling to you. Could it be...? "Tim! Swim to me! Grab ahold of
 the crate!"

 You have no idea how, but it sounds exactly like your father!

 You seem to hear a voice crying out, but you can't tell whether it's
 real or simply a trick of the wind before it's gone.

>swim to crate
 and you don't spare any more effort wondering whether it's possible or
 not.

 "Dad!" Fatigue is forgotten as you flail through the water towards your
 father. He's hanging on to one of the crates from the cutter -- this
 one miraculously intact -- that floats nearby, and he beckons you
 anxiously with his free hand.

 You draw near -- the crate is very close, but you're so tired, and you
 think you might not make it, and then your father's voice rings clearly
 in your ears over the shrieks of the other kids at the pool...

 Shallow End
 You're standing in the warm water of the shallow end of the George Ross
 Community Center pool, five years old once more. The pool is indoors,
 so the the excited shouting and shrieking from all the other kids echo
 back and forth into a neverending high-pitched background noise. The
 air is thick with humidity and the itchy smell of chlorine.

 Dad is crouching in the water, just a step or two beyond where the
 bottom of the pool starts to slope down into the deep end. His arms are
 outstretched, and there's an excited smile on his face. "Swim with your
 hands and kick with your feet at the same time, Tim! You can do it!"
 You're pretty scared, and really tired from all the swimming and
 playing earlier in the day, but maybe you can do this after all...

 floods your mouth and nose.

 brown hair, blue eyes, and a slightly lopsided smile. He's wearing
 bright rainbow-colored swim trunks and is crouching in the water a few
 steps into the deep end of the pool.

>swim to dad
 slipping underwater is too frightening. You're about to call out to Dad
 and tell him you can't do it, when you see a young dark-skinned boy
 about your age wade out to the drop-off. Who is he? He looks very
 familiar, but you know he's not in your kindergarten class. Maybe one
 of the other classes...

 He turns to look directly at you, and something about the look in his
 eyes gives you a calm sense of confidence. He turns away, crouches,
 pushes with his legs, and he's off, a fish flitting to the far end of
 the pool without a backwards glance.

 As you watch him, you can feel a new determination -- if that boy can
 do it, you can too. You turn, look at Dad, crouch down, and push
 forward, kicking your tired legs with new strength and moving your arms
 the right way -- you think it's the right way, at least. You keep
 going, trying to remember to breathe properly, until your hand pokes
 into Dad's stomach and he pulls you up out of the water with a huge
 smile on his face. He twirls you around, shouting "You did it! You did
 it!" as he gathers you into a great big hug...

 "I pai ai! You're alive!" Somehow you're hanging onto the crate near
 Eruera. Of course it couldn't have been Dad; what were you thinking?
 Something's wrong, though. Eruera winces as he shifts his grip on the
 crate, breath hissing and eyes narrowing. Then it passes, and he
 continues, shouting to be heard over the raging storm.

 "We may be alive, Tim, but we won't stay alive unless we can get to
 shore. And I think I broke my leg when the missile hit -- I was almost
 over the railing, but not quite. I felt my left leg crunch below the
 knee, and it hurts very badly to move it at all, let alone kick." He
 smiles almost apologetically. "I don't know how much help I'm going to
 be moving this thing."

 Missile? Was that what sank the ship?

 In the Ocean
 You are floating holding onto a crate in what seems like the dead
 center of the storm. Eruera is beside you, grimacing with pain and
 taking shallow breaths as he holds on as well. The wind shoves the
 crate around where it will, dragging you along in its wake. You might
 be able to influence its direction, but your legs are really tired and
 you're not sure you have the strength.

 Thunder crashes as the storm rolls on.

>talk to eruera

 He coughs, his arms tightening convulsively on the crate. "Need to get
 to shore! Won't last much longer..."

 He seems to lose focus on the rest of what you were saying.

 trying to push the crate in a direction -- any direction. You can't
 tell whether you're making any progress. Eruera tries to encourage you,
 but his words are cut apart by the storm and garbled by your own
 exhaustion, and you can't make sense of what he's saying.

 You keep kicking until your legs fail. You rest, then try again, a
 cycle that gets shorter and shorter as you slowly run out of energy.
 All of a sudden, an unexpectedly violent surge of the sea tears you
 loose from the crate, and in a strange calm you briefly slip under the
 waves before kicking upwards again with leaden feet. By the time you
 reorient yourself, the crate is out of reach, scudding just ahead of
 you before the wind. It's so close... but you have nothing left in your
 legs, and you can't quite reach Eruera's arm as he stretches out
 towards you. Slowly, unstoppably, the distance increases, carrying the
 crate into the dark and leaving you behind. The last thing you see is
 Eruera straining toward you, trying to yell something over the fury of
 the storm. But the thunder, wind, and rain drown his voice and he
 finally disappears into the gloom.

 Alive...

 You must be alive -- you feel too miserable to be dead. Despite your
 aching leg muscles and the burning sensation in your lungs you'd rather
 stay unconscious -- if it weren't for the surf slapping your face every
 few seconds, making you choke and splutter. Very reluctantly, you shove
 yourself up the beach a bit farther to get away from the tide. After
 what seems like another hour, you open your stinging eyes and look
 around. You're on a strand of black sand in a shallow bay, and the
 lying sky is now innocent blue and filled with harmless-looking, puffy
 clouds.

 Strand
 You stand on a thin strip of black sand lining the shallow curve of a
 bay to the east. A few seabirds fly overhead, and various clumps of
 driftwood, seaweed, and other shore debris litter the shore, the only
 visible evidence of the recent storm. A steep tumble of volcanic rock
 looms over the beach to the west and south, blocking travel in all
 directions except into the forest to the north.

 You slowly stagger to your feet, your battered body and abused muscles
 protesting all the while. You look around with a dull stare, not really
 understanding yet what you're seeing and unsure what to make of the
 black beach you stand upon. You wonder what happened to Eruera.

 The jostling of debris disturbs him, and his eyes slowly open, flakes
 of dried salt falling from his eyelids. You can't bear to look at his
 face -- he's in too much agony. It takes a long minute before he
 becomes aware enough of his surroundings to recognize you.

 "Tim, is that you?" he croaks. "I guess we made it."

 He doesn't smile, barely even sounds interested. It's obvious he's
 going to need help quickly.

 almost grotesque size.

 "Well, I found this board," you say, holding it out so he can see. "And
 there are some more over in the pile. I also found this piece of tent
 fabric. Seems pretty strong to me. Will these work?"

 Eruera nods quickly. "Those... should work."

 He rallies and becomes a bit more coherent, speaking with forced
 precision. "Tim, I think my left leg is badly broken. It needs to be
 straightened. I'll brace myself; you pull my leg straight toward you as
 hard as you can. After that you can splint it."

 such a piercing shriek of agony that you let go of his leg in surprise,
 falling backwards onto the wet sand. But when you struggle back up, you
 see that Eruera's leg looks like it's straight again. Still horribly
 swollen, but straight.

 Eruera himself lies flat on his back, panting in exhaustion. "Good...

 and the trail forks here, continuing to both the northeast and the
 north.

 A small dinosaur, which stands no taller than your shin, is nearby. She
 raises her head to issue a warbling call that sounds remarkably like a
 bird's, while continuing to watch you out of the corner of her eye.

 A shiny battery, apparently discarded or lost by someone, lies

 with intense, beady eyes, tensed to spring away.

 A shiny battery, apparently discarded or lost by someone, lies
 half-hidden by a pile of leaves that Dina is using as a nest.

 The water in the bucket drips away as the level slowly falls.

>go southwest
 Forest Edge
 Low bushy ferns give way to towering kauri trees here. Their delicate
 cones and thin, green leaves cast deeper shadows as the forest thickens
 to the northeast. A steep break in the cliff rock here leads southeast,
 down to the beach, and a faint animal trail leads into the forest to
 the northeast.

 The water level in the bucket drops as the contents leak away.

 North Strand
 The black sand beach transitions to stones and boulders here as the
 seashore lifts into the black cliffs. To the northwest a break in the
 volcanic stone leads upwards and into the depths of the forest. Where
 the water eddies at the north end of the beach a collection of light,
 floating junk has collected.

 Shreds of what used to be a thick rope are here, washed up on the rocks
 at the north end of the beach and coated in black sand grains.

 The water in the bucket drips away as the level slowly falls.

>go south
 Strand
 You stand on a thin strip of black sand lining the shallow curve of a
 bay to the east. A few seabirds fly overhead, and various clumps of
 driftwood, seaweed, and other shore debris litter the shore, the only
 visible evidence of the recent storm. A steep tumble of volcanic rock
 looms over the beach to the west and south, blocking travel in all
 directions except into the forest to the north.

 Eruera lies on the sand here, alert but unable to move.

 A thin stream of water drips to the ground as water leaks from the
 bucket.

>give water to eruera
 You approach Eruera as he lies on the beach.

 "Eruera! I've got water for you!

 You hold out the bucket. "Here's some water, Eruera."

 Eruera sits up laboriously, takes the bucket from you, and tips it into
 his mouth. Water spills over his face as he drinks, and he closes his
 eyes in bliss. What seems like minutes later, he lowers the bucket.
 "Thank you, Tim. That's much better!"

 He gathers strength for a minute, panting for air a bit after downing
 the water. Finally he beckons you closer. "Tim, I'm sure the cutter was
 attacked, and I'm pretty certain it was by poachers -- criminals who
 illegally sneak ashore to capture the taniwha and sell them abroad. I'm
 not completely certain where we are at the moment, but if I'm right
 there should be a Conservation Service station about thirty miles to
 the north."

 He grins and spreads his hands. "Obviously I'm in no shape for such a
 trip through the bush, so it is going to fall to you to get to that
 station and get us some help. I'll try to answer any questions you
 have, and if you encounter anything unusual in the area you can always
 ask me about it."

 He steels himself, then twists, reaches into the pile of debris, and
 pulls out a solid-looking metal case. A huge smile spreads over his
 face. "By blind luck, that crate we stumbled across in the ocean had a
 set of field radios in it. They were in a sealed case, and they're
 pretty rugged, so they should still work." He hands you one of the
 radios and shows you how to push the button to make a call. You try it
 out, and the radio works perfectly! "With these we should be able to
 keep in touch in the field! If you run into anything, just give me a
 call."

 Having this link back to Eruera, even if he can't really get to you to
 help out, loosens up a tightness in your chest you weren't even aware
 you had.

 (You could ask him about himself, the coastal cutter, the dinosaurs,
 Dina, the battery, Aotearoa, or your vision.)

>ask him about dina

 "Yes, Tim?"

 "I ran into a little dinosaur -- it was only about as high as my knee,
 but it was pretty active and, well, aggressive."

 "That was probably an oviraptor, Tim. There are several species of the
 little pests around here."

 You shift a bit. "Are they dangerous?"

 "Well, to small lizards, bugs, and eggs, sure. Not really to people,
 although they're protective and have a nasty bite."

>ask him about vision
 thought I saw my father, back before he died."

 Eruera looks at you with interest. "You had a vision?"

 "Yes, I was a little kid again, maybe five years old, and my dad was
 teaching me how to swim."

 "Tim, in the Mori culture, such visions are not uncommon. It is often
 said that the wairua -- the soul -- of an ancestor can send visions of
 warning or guidance. Perhaps your father's wairua gave you strength as
 you struggled in the ocean."

>ask him about battery
 me near it, but it's obviously a battery of some sort."

 Eruera sits up and looks at you seriously. "Really? That's serious,
 Tim. "It's likely some trash from the same group of poachers that
 attacked us. I'd be very careful as you go through the forest. If
 they're that close, you'll need to be quite alert to avoid being
 spotted."

>ask him about cutter

 "You won't believe this, Tim, but I think it was a ship-to-ship
 missile." Your look of incredulity must be immediately obvious. He
 smiles faintly and continues. "I am serious, Tim. There have always
 been groups of poachers raiding the Protected Lands to take the taniwha
 away and sell them. They make a great deal of money, and so there's
 been an ongoing arms race between them and the Conservation Service for
 years. These poachers are pretty good at hiding their camps, but when
 they're cornered or feel they can get away with it they usually have
 some pretty heavy weaponry."

>ask him about dinosaurs

 Eruera shifts a bit, and there's a twinkle in his eye as he addresses
 you. "We really shouldn't waste time with this until we've secured
 rescue, but I know that's the main reason you came, and you haven't
 gotten your chance to see them yet, so I'll indulge your curiosity. In
 many ways, Tim, the taniwha are the living symbols of this whole
 nation. When the Mori first arrived in Aotearoa, they fought the
 taniwha simply to exist here. In those days, they covered the
 continent, for the most part, and weren't really willing to share it
 with humans."

 "But eventually the Mori learned how to coexist with the taniwha, and
 even partially domesticate some of them. When the pkeh came, bringing
 guns and colonists and looking for land to clear and farm, the Mori
 met their firearms with kairkau mounted on taniwha. Their mana was
 strong -- the British guns had some effect, but the bony plates on the
 taniwha's heads served as shields and made the riders difficult
 targets. The pkeh were unable to simply take Mori land, but they
 weren't willing to give up. Years of fighting ensued, until Pitiroi --
 Robert FitzRoy -- was sent here from Great Britain and met with the
 great chiefs -- the rangatira -- and signed the Treaty of Waitangi."

 "The Treaty established a permanent state of alliance between Great
 Britain and Aotearoa. Mori sovereignty was guaranteed, but the pkeh
 were granted rights and brought into the iwi, or family, of Aotearoa.
 Many speculate that if the taniwha had not existed, we might have ended
 up like the aboriginal people of the Australian or American colonies --
 a broken people, stripped of their land and heritage."

 "So the taniwha are vitally important to the Mori people, Tim. That is
 why we work so hard to protect them."

>ask him about aotearoa

>2
 here. Could you tell me about it?"

 Eruera chuckles. "That is a lot to cover, Tim. How about I just tell
 you how I see it? Aotearoa is home. It's not like we don't have
 problems here -- we have poverty and some pretty harsh political fights
 over taxes and resources and things like that, but so many things went
 right here that seemed to go wrong other places. We've kept our
 precious indigenous species safe -- we haven't had an extinction since
 the Laughing Owl back about a century ago. Race relations here are good
 compared with some -- well, most, really -- other former British
 colonies."

 He leans back. "Let's leave it at that for now, OK?"

>ask him about station
 sorry, Tim. I don't think I can help you much with that."

 (You could ask him about himself, the captain, the poachers, your
 vision, or the Conservation Service.)

>ask him about  poachers

 Eruera's face stills as he looks at you. "Be very careful, Tim. If the
 poachers are in your path, do everything you can to avoid contact with
 them. These men killed my brothers on the cutter in cold blood, to
 protect their profits from stealing the taniwha. The best you could
 hope for if you are caught would be to be held for ransom."

>ask him about conservation service

 Eruera frowns. "To work for, I'm guessing you mean? They're a good
 employer. I've not worked elsewhere, but I am told it's one of the
 better places within the government to work. More importantly, though,
 I see a great deal of Aotearoa the way the tkpuna did -- wild and
 unspoiled. And I feel like I'm doing my part to keep the mana of my
 homeland strong -- to protect the whenua rhui."

>ask him about captain
 him?"

 Eruera shakes his head. "Captain Hunapo? Yes, I suppose he is dead,
 although if anyone else managed to survive it would probably be that
 old kak+ mrM. Too stubborn to admit he's dead, I don't doubt."

 He sighs. "No, I'd known him by reputation -- a very skilled sailor, a
 long-time veteran of the Service, hell to work under -- but this was
 the first time I'd sailed with him."

>go north
 Come back safely."

 The black sand beach transitions to stones and boulders here as the

 volcanic stone leads upwards and into the depths of the forest. Where

>go northeast
 Animal Trail
 The ground cover has been pushed aside by passing animals just enough
 to make this weaving trail the path of least resistance. There is a
 very tall kauri tree here, its thick roots snaking in and out of the
 ground. You can hear swiftly running water from somewhere off to the
 north. To the southwest you can see the forest lighten as it thins out,
 and the trail forks here, continuing to both the northeast and the
 north.

 Dina, who stands no taller than your shin, is nearby. She slowly moves
 from tree to tree, searching for something while always managing to
 keep you in view.

 A shiny battery, apparently discarded or lost by someone, lies
 half-hidden by a pile of leaves that Dina is using as a nest.

>take battery
 as you approach her nest. You retreat empty-handed, not wanting to get
 bitten.

>examine dina
 knee-high. Her front arms are short and clawed, making her look like a
 very miniature T-Rex, except for a smaller, almost birdlike head, and
 she has muted and dappled green and brown skin that makes her very hard
 to pick out of the undergrowth. She eyes you warily, unsure whether
 you're dangerous or not.

>go north
 Stream South
 You stand at the south bank of a stream rushing down from the western
 mountains. The water flows over a tumble of rocks and its level drops
 steeply here, cutting into the ground and leaving steep, raw slopes on
 either side. There doesn't seem to be an obvious way across,
 unfortunately, although one of the trees by the riverbank has very
 irregular bark, looks climbable, and has a branch that extends out over
 the water. A similar, older tree sags over the stream on the far bank.

 As you approach the stream, you notice a creature peeping out at you
 from behind a tree on the far bank. After a few moments you notice that
 it's holding on to the trunk of the tree, seven feet off the ground.
 You watch it silently, neither of you making a move for the moment.
 After thirty seconds or so, it musters up some courage and swings
 itself around the trunk in an impossible acrobatic move, landing
 lightly on the ground next to the tree. It seems to be some sort of...
 monkey, maybe, but with small yellow eyes and huge, scooped ears on a
 rat-like head. You know you've seen this, or something like it, in your
 reference book before, but you can't quite remember the name....

 You take an involuntary step closer to get a better look at it. It
 steps forward to get a better look at you. You scratch your head in
 thought, still trying to remember what species it is. It scratches its
 head as well. You stop. It stops.

 I remember! It's a nanakia! And that coloration means she's a female!

>examine nanakia
 delicate arms, and a long, thin tail. Her head is the big tipoff that
 she's not a lemur or a monkey -- two scooped ears that swivel around
 when she listens, beady yellow eyes, and a ratlike snout make it
 obvious that this creature has to be related to bats in some way. The
 nanakia stands on her hind legs on the far bank, watching you intently
 and mimicking your every move.

 The nanakia watches you intently from across the stream. She notices
 you looking at her and gets very excited. She draws herself up to her
 full height, wiggles her handlike paws, and twitches her tail.

>name nanakia Naginata
 "I'm going to call you 'Naginata'."

 Naginata's eyes gleam, and she preens with the attention.

>ask eruera about naginata

>ask radio about naginata

>turn on radio

 "Sure, Tim. What would you like to talk about?"

 Naginata watches you intently from across the river. She makes a few
 halfhearted motions, trying to imitate calling Eruera on the field
 radio, but quickly gives up and returns to watching you.

 (You could ask him about himself, your vision, or your fear of
 heights.)

>ask radio about naginata

>ask eruera about naginata

 (You could ask him about himself, your vision, or your fear of
 heights.)

>ask him about fear of heights

 "Climbing, Tim?"

 "Yes. I've wanted to climb some of these trees -- I've even started to
 try -- but I just... Are they safe to climb?"

 "Ah, I think I understand. The bark is smooth, yes? And the branches
 are high?"

 "Yes! I've never climbed a tree like this before. They're so tall! If I
 slipped and fell, I might break a bone, or even get killed!"

 Eruera is silent for a moment. "Well, Tim, I'm not sure what to tell
 you. I can't tell you it's completely safe, but I will say that Mori
 children often climb and play in trees much like these, and these are
 children younger than you, Tim. I feel certain that if you feel you
 need to climb a kauri, and you concentrate hard on what you are doing,
 that you will succeed."

 Immediately your mind fills with an image of the young boy you saw when
 you imagined being back learning to swim with Dad, before the accident.
 But this time the young boy is scampering up a tall tree like a
 hairless monkey, grabbing handholds quickly and surely as he climbs.
 After reaching the lower branches, he turns to you and beckons, and
 somehow your fear lessens. It's still there, but somehow more
 manageable. Something you can master, rather than the other way around.
 The young boy smiles and the brief vision ends.

 "Tim? Are you listening?"

 You shake your head, back to reality. "Yes, Eruera," you say. "You
 know, I think I might be able to give this a try."

 "You do? Very good! Take care and I'm sure you'll be fine."

>go up

 Streamside Tree
 You are perched on a fairly thick branch of a kauri tree about thirty
 feet above the ground, which is about as high as you can climb, and
 higher than you feel truly comfortable with anyway. Above this level
 the bark is too smooth to climb, and you can't imagine trying to climb
 any higher even if it wasn't. The branch extends north out over the
 river. You take a moment to savor your victory -- you did it! You
 actually climbed all the way up to the low branches of a tall kauri
 tree! Sure, you were scared, but you did it anyway!

 I wish that little Mori boy was here so I could thank him.

 Across the river, you notice Naginata watching you climb with great
 interest. She hops onto what looks like a dead or dying kauri on the
 north bank, which appears to have some sort of major trunk damage near
 the ground. The nanakia scampers up the trunk to a branch, about at
 your level, that reaches south across the stream.

>go north
 under your weight. Your deathgrip on the branch takes most of your
 attention, but out of the corner of your eye you see Naginata
 approaching you, moving out over the river on her branch. The damaged
 kauri's limb sags and creaks alarmingly even under the slight weight of
 Naginata. She doesn't seem the slightest bit concerned. You, however,
 come to the abrupt realization that you're hanging about thirty feet
 above a rushing stream in the middle of the Aotearoan bush, and decide
 to retreat to the trunk.

>inventory
   a field radio
   a leaky bucket, currently empty

 Naginata watches you intently from her perch on the branch across the
 stream. She watches you taking stock of your possessions, then starts
 looking at herself and patting her fur in a pretty good impersonation
 of you. Her search reveals a flea, which she pops in her mouth and
 crunches with gusto.

>hit me

>stand

>go down
 Stream South
 On the way down from the branch one of the waves in the bark gives way
 under your feet, causing you to slip for a foot or so before you manage
 to catch yourself. After a few seconds to calm yourself, you continue
 down the remaining few feet to the ground, gripping the trunk with
 white knuckles the whole way.

 You stand at the south bank of a stream rushing down from the western
 mountains. The water flows over a tumble of rocks and its level drops
 steeply here, cutting into the ground and leaving steep, raw slopes on
 either side. There doesn't seem to be an obvious way across,
 unfortunately, although one of the trees by the riverbank has very
 irregular bark, looks climbable, and has a branch that extends out over
 the water. A similar, older tree sags over the stream on the far bank.

 A small chunk of gnarled bark from the trunk of the kauri tree rests on
 the ground where it fell during your downward climb.

 As you reach the ground, the nanakia gracefully drops out of the tree
 on her bank, and resumes watching you, an intent expression on her
 little face.

>take bark
 Taken.

 Naginata watches you intently from across the stream. She notices you
 reaching for the chunk of bark and picks up a fairly heavy nearby rock,
 holding it with some difficulty in obvious mimicry.

>examine bark
 The bark is about a foot in diameter, thick and round, and there's a
 fair-sized blob of sticky sap or gum attached to it as well.

 Naginata watches you intently from across the stream. She notices you
 looking at the chunk of bark and peers at it with exaggerated interest.

>fix bucket with bark
 You can't fix the bucket with that.

>hit me with bark

>plug bucket with bark

 Naginata watches you intently from across the stream. She notices you
 reaching for the blob of sticky gum, but since she already has a
 possession she just continues to watch you.

>fix bucket with gum

 like the leak is plugged!

 Naginata watches you intently from across the river. She makes a few
 halfhearted motions, trying to imitate plugging the bucket with the
 blob of sticky gum, but quickly gives up and returns to watching you.

>fill bucket
 fresh water.

 Naginata watches you intently from across the stream. She peers with
 interest at the sight of you filling the bucket with the stream.
 Although she lacks a bucket of her own, she moves to the water's edge
 and mimes scooping water out, shaking drops off her wet paws as she
 stands.

>go south
 Animal Trail
 The ground cover has been pushed aside by passing animals just enough

 very tall kauri tree here, its thick roots snaking in and out of the

 Top of Falls
 Here a mountain stream reaches the headwall and plunges over. The water
 falls forty feet or so, splattering off a black rock ledge below before
 reforming and flowing into the ocean. The cliff is too sheer to descend

 north bank that you might be able to scramble down -- if you could get

 hands sticky with gum and tends to flake off at the same time, making
 climbing both dangerous and messy, and you head down again.

 the bark is too smooth to climb, and you can't imagine trying to climb
 any higher even if it wasn't. The branch extends north out over the
 river.

 Across the river, you notice Naginata watching you climb with great
 interest. She hops onto what looks like a dead or dying kauri on the
 north bank, juggling her rock to try to keep hold of it. Naginata's
 tree appears to have some sort of major trunk damage near the ground,
 but she ignores it and climbs up the trunk to a branch about at your
 level that reaches south across the stream.

 Putting things on the old kauri would achieve nothing.

>go down
 Stream South
 You stand at the south bank of a stream rushing down from the western
 mountains. The water flows over a tumble of rocks and its level drops
 steeply here, cutting into the ground and leaving steep, raw slopes on
 either side. There doesn't seem to be an obvious way across,
 unfortunately, although one of the trees by the riverbank has very
 irregular bark, looks climbable, and has a branch that extends out over
 the water. A similar, older tree sags over the stream on the far bank.

 As you reach the ground, the nanakia gracefully drops out of the tree
 on her bank, and resumes watching you, an intent expression on her
 little face.

>cut old kauri with bark

 (retrying as if you'd typed "cut old.")
 You can't cut that, since you can't reach it.

>cut irregular kauri with bark

 Cutting that up would achieve little.

 Animal Trail
 The ground cover has been pushed aside by passing animals just enough
 to make this weaving trail the path of least resistance. There is a
 very tall kauri tree here, its thick roots snaking in and out of the
 ground. You can hear swiftly running water from somewhere off to the
 north. To the southwest you can see the forest lighten as it thins out,
 and the trail forks here, continuing to both the northeast and the
 north.

 Dina, who stands no taller than your shin, is nearby. She slowly moves
 from tree to tree, searching for something while always managing to
 keep you in view.

 A shiny battery, apparently discarded or lost by someone, lies
 half-hidden by a pile of leaves that Dina is using as a nest.

 Forest Edge
 Low bushy ferns give way to towering kauri trees here. Their delicate

 the northeast.

 fragrance from the trees -- it smells wonderful, but it's so sharp that
 it's all you can do not to sneeze.

 North Strand
 The black sand beach transitions to stones and boulders here as the
 seashore lifts into the black cliffs. To the northwest a break in the
 volcanic stone leads upwards and into the depths of the forest. Where
 the water eddies at the north end of the beach a collection of light,
 floating junk has collected.

 Shreds of what used to be a thick rope are here, washed up on the rocks

 Strand
 You stand on a thin strip of black sand lining the shallow curve of a
 bay to the east. A few seabirds fly overhead, and various clumps of
 driftwood, seaweed, and other shore debris litter the shore, the only
 visible evidence of the recent storm. A steep tumble of volcanic rock
 looms over the beach to the west and south, blocking travel in all
 directions except into the forest to the north.

 Eruera lies under a makeshift debris shelter a ways up the beach,
 relatively calm and alert.

 Top of Falls
 Here a mountain stream reaches the headwall and plunges over. The water
 falls forty feet or so, splattering off a black rock ledge below before
 reforming and flowing into the ocean. The cliff is too sheer to descend
 on this side, but you can see that there's a rockfall just past the
 north bank that you might be able to scramble down -- if you could get

 Eruera clicks his tongue and sounds more interested. "Did he now? The

 vision of Mui." He pauses for a second. "I didn't see your vision, so
 I wouldn't know. But certainly a vision of Mui is no bad thing."

 Eruera interrupts you as you start talking. "It is certainly very
 interesting, what you saw. But we must focus on the goal of getting you

>ask eruera about himself
 "Could you tell me a little about yourself?"

 Eruera pauses for a moment, as if surprised by the question. "Sure,
 Tim... Hmmm, where to start? I grew up in Kkarauri, a small village on
 the west coast. My family was large -- I had five brothers and sisters.
 We were poor -- Kkarauri is not prosperous, and my parents were not
 well educated. I took advantage of a government scholarship program to
 go to college, and it required me to join the ADF -- the army -- for
 four years. The poacher problem on the coasts was getting bad at the
 time, so I spent two of those years on detached duty with the
 Conservation Service."

 "Those first couple years were hardly as exciting as the events of the
 last few hours, but they were enough to make me see that I wanted to
 stay in. When my duty to the ADF was discharged, I signed up with the
 Conservation Service full-time."

 You can hear the smile in his voice. "Twelve more years and here we
 are."

 Streamside Tree
 You are perched on a fairly thick branch of a kauri tree about thirty
 feet above the ground, which is about as high as you can climb, and
 higher than you feel truly comfortable with anyway. Above this level
 the bark is too smooth to climb, and you can't imagine trying to climb
 any higher even if it wasn't. The branch extends north out over the
 river.

 Across the river, you notice Nagi watching you climb with great
 interest. She hops onto what looks like a dead or dying kauri on the
 north bank, juggling her rock to try to keep hold of it. Nagi's tree
 appears to have some sort of major trunk damage near the ground, but
 she ignores it and climbs up the trunk to a branch about at your level
 that reaches south across the stream.

>go north
 under your weight. Your deathgrip on the branch takes most of your
 attention, but out of the corner of your eye, you see Nagi approaching
 you, moving out over the river on her branch, cradling her rock with
 one arm. The damaged kauri sags and creaks dangerously under the weight
 of Nagi and her rock, but she seems oblivious to the danger.

 Suddenly, her branch gives way! No, wait! It's the tree itself! The
 rotted section near the ground splinters under the leverage of both
 Nagi and her rock. Quickly, she dumps the rock and leaps back toward
 the trunk, but the tree is already falling! She sprints down the trunk
 towards the ground, and manages to jump off right before impact. She
 tumbles into a pile of debris and vanishes for a moment before popping
 out, shaking leaves and dirt off herself, and looking up at you with a
 gleam in her eye. You retreat backwards, closer to the trunk.

>go down
 Stream South
 You stand at the south bank of a stream rushing down from the western
 mountains. The water flows over a tumble of rocks and its level drops
 steeply here, cutting into the ground and leaving steep, raw slopes on
 either side. An old, dead kauri tree has fallen across the stream here,
 its straight trunk making a narrow bridge to the north side.

 As you reach the ground, the nanakia pops her head up from of a tangle
 of underbrush and peeps out at you, beady eyes sparkling.

>go north
 outstretched, walking slowly across the flowing water. The nanakia
 scampers onto the trunk as well, then raises herself to stand on her
 hind feet, splays her front paws out to the sides, and waddles forward
 in a surprisingly good impersonation of you. As you near each other,
 the nanakia drops back to all fours...

 And then springs at you, scampering up your chest to your shoulder,
 where she perches as if she belongs there.

 You immediately twist away in panic, but you can't go too crazy,
 because you're more afraid of falling off the log and into the river.
 In a moment, you realize Nagi isn't hurting you, and you try to relax
 and slow your heartbeat down again. Well, I guess I've made a new
 friend!

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go north
 Stream North
 This is the north bank of the cascading stream. Water tumbles over
 rocks as it rushes through the forest down towards the shore. To the
 east, a shallow slope of rocks and debris leads down further into the
 forest, away from the western mountains. A relatively straight, dead
 kauri tree has fallen across the stream here, bridging the banks and
 allowing you to cross to the south.

 Nagi scampers off to your side, curious to see what adventures you have
 planned next.

 After touching your feet on the north side of the stream, you can't
 help pulling out the field radio and placing a call. "Eruera! I made it
 across the stream! Nagi -- sorry, that's a nanakia that I found -- was
 copying everything I did, so I got it to pick up a rock and climb up a
 dying tree on the far bank. The weight was just enough to make it tip
 over and fall across the stream!"

 Eruera chuckles. "Very good, Tim! I'm not sure I followed all that, but
 I'm pleased you're making progress!"

 "Me too! I actually climbed a tree on my side of the stream -- that was
 how I got Nagi to climb too!"

 To the west, a very shallow slope of mixed scree and debris leads up to

 forest thickens again, with faint animal trails leading north into the
 deeper forest and east towards the thinner trees that line the coast.
 By keeping close to the streambank, you could also manage to follow the
 water southeast down toward the shore.

 A large boulder stands out from the rest of the mixed rock and debris.
 It's remarkable for being particularly round.

 Nagi saunters along in your wake, curious to see what you're up to.

 sunlight into a glory -- a circular rainbow -- about your head. There's

 spills over the lip and flows the short distance into the ocean.

 Nagi scampers off to your side, curious to see what adventures you have

 You fidget a bit. "Well, yes, it was really pretty, but there was
 something else. I seemed to feel a sense of calmness or confidence
 while I was standing there."

 Eruera chuckles. "Well, that's a good sign, Tim. The niwaniwa can be a
 very good omen in Mori tradition, particularly when it is strong and
 unbroken. And a glory is about as unbroken as it gets."

 There's no way this could be the station -- there's no tower! But if it
 isn't a Conservation Service station...

 You freeze, very conscious of how exposed you are, and desperately hope
 no one pokes their head over the slight ridge between you and their
 camp, which must be just out of sight to the northeast. All of a sudden
 the field radio squawks to life. "Tim? How's it going?"

 Horrified, you drop to the ground and fumble for the radio, then hiss
 back. "Quiet for now -- someone's close!" You listen very carefully.
 The argument seems to have stopped, but you can't tell if that's
 because they heard you or if they resolved things themselves. Slowly,
 you creep back to the safety of the trees, and when you are confident
 you're screened from view you call Eruera back.

 "OK, we can talk now."

 Eruera responds quickly. "Tim, what was that?"

 "I'm positive the poacher camp is just over a hill, not very far to the
 northeast. I could hear engines and loud voices."

 Eruera's voice sounds very strained. "I beg you, take great care, Tim.
 I'm sorry it has to be you making this journey, but you must stay away
 from these men. Stick to the bush and keep heading north."

 "OK, Eruera. Not a problem. I don't want to be caught by these guys
 either."

 "Good luck, Tim. Stay safe." You stand still for a moment, breathing
 hard, trying to calm back down. But no one is coming, so you seem to be
 safe for now.

>go north
 Moa Nest
 The trail descends into a hollow here, free of trees. Centered in the
 valley floor is a large mound of volcanic rock, venting what looks like
 smoke or steam from a fumarole on top. The surrounding rock is riddled
 with cracks, crevices, and fissures, and hidden in one of the larger
 depressions is a very large bird's nest, which doesn't look completely
 intact. The forest trail leads upslope to both the north and south.

 A huge flightless bird steps back and forth around her nest in
 agitation. She looks like she's at least twice your height -- maybe
 three times! She can't be anything but a nesting moa.

 Nagi scampers in your wake, curious to see what you're going to do
 next.

 After looking around, you decide this location is worth asking Eruera
 about, so you pull out the field radio and place a call. "Eruera, I've
 stumbled across a pretty strange area."

 "Could you describe it, Tim?"

 "Well, there's kind of a mini-volcano in the middle of a clearing
 here..."

 Eruera interrupts you, sounding amused. "Well, it probably is! There is
 a great deal of volcanic activity all over Aotearoa, and it certainly
 wouldn't be unusual to run across hot springs or a fumarole."

 "Oh! I didn't know they were that common. Are they safe?"

 "Reasonably. Don't go jumping into one, but most of the time these
 aren't particularly active. They might lead to hot rock, somewhere
 below, but around here there's not much risk of a full-scale eruption."

 "OK, thanks." You eye the moa as it paces back and forth, then click
 the transmitter again. "Um, Eruera? I had one more question. Can a moa
 be dangerous?"

 "Ah! There's a moa there? Well, I'm sure if you ran right up to it
 you'd probably get attacked, but they're usually pretty cautious of
 people. As long as you keep a reasonable distance from it, you should
 be fine."

 You continue watching the moa, which still seems to be staying near its
 nest. "OK, thanks again!"

 "No problem, Tim. Good luck!"

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

 You try to approach closely enough to look at the GPS, but the moa

 Nagi watches you, her interest indicated by her twitching tail and

 (You could ask him about the glory, the GPS, the egg, or Mui.)

>ask eruera about eps

 "I'm sorry, Tim. I don't know much about that."

 (You could ask him about the glory, the GPS, the egg, or Mui.)

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>ask eruera about egg
 apparently rolled off the nest and ended up stuck in a crevice in some
 volcanic rock. It can't get it out and I can't figure out how to do it
 either. It's too deep for me to reach."

 Eruera sounds thoughtful. "Well, you wouldn't want to try to lever it
 out -- it might break." He thinks for a while longer. "I'm sure there's
 a way you can do it -- maybe more than one -- I'm just not thinking
 straight right now."

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>examine egg
 large enough and heavy enough to require two hands to carry.

 Nagi watches you, curiosity evident from her tilted head and fixed
 gaze. She notices you looking at the egg and peers at it with
 exaggerated interest.

 The moa paces, fretful and silent.

>examine volcano
 slope. It vents steam or smoke from a number of fissures. Notable among
 these are a deep crack high up on the formation, and a large crevice
 near the ground. There's also a sizable fumarole on top -- a circular
 hole about two or three feet in diameter.

 Nagi watches you, her interest indicated by her twitching tail and
 unblinking stare. She notices you looking at the mound of volcanic rock
 and peers at it with exaggerated interest.

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>examine crevice
 the mass of cooled lava. You can't tell for sure, but there appears to
 be something wedged down inside it. You peer closer -- it's an egg!

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>examine fumarole
 make, located at the top of the mound of volcanic rock.

 Nagi watches you, showing her interest by her tilted head and fixed
 gaze. She notices you looking at the fumarole and peers at it with
 exaggerated interest.

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>go south

 Debris Slope
 To the west, a very shallow slope of mixed scree and debris leads up to
 the bank of the mountain stream. At the bottom, where you stand, the
 forest thickens again, with faint animal trails leading north into the
 deeper forest and east towards the thinner trees that line the coast.
 By keeping close to the streambank, you could also manage to follow the
 water southeast down toward the shore.

 A large boulder stands out from the rest of the mixed rock and debris.
 It's remarkable for being particularly round.

 Nagi saunters along behind you, curious to see what adventures you have
 planned next.

>push boulder north
 the trail to the north, crushing and pushing aside leaves and fern
 fronds, and causing a number of small animals to scamper out of your
 path.

 Moa Nest
 The trail descends into a hollow here, free of trees. Centered in the
 valley floor is a large mound of volcanic rock, venting what looks like
 smoke or steam from a fumarole on top. The surrounding rock is riddled
 with cracks, crevices, and fissures, and hidden in one of the larger
 depressions is a very large bird's nest, which doesn't look completely
 intact. The forest trail leads upslope to both the north and south.

 A huge flightless bird steps back and forth around her nest in
 agitation. She looks like she's at least twice your height -- maybe
 three times! She can't be anything but a nesting moa.

 Nagi dawdles along in your wake, curious to see what you're going to do
 next.

 The boulder rolls to a stop as you take a break from pushing it.

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>plug fumarole with boulder

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>push boulder to fumarole
 rolling the boulder up the volcanic mound, crunching the rock as you
 go. At the top, the boulder settles into the fumarole, sealing the hole
 with a snug fit. You give the boulder a few experimental pushes and it
 confirms what you thought -- the boulder isn't going anyplace now.

 Nagi watches you intently. She makes a few halfhearted motions, trying
 to imitate pushing the boulder onto the fumarole, but quickly gives up
 and returns to watching you.

 The moa paces, fretful and silent.

>examine nest
 to the volcanic mound, likely in order to keep it warm. A shiny,
 yellow-colored object -- obviously not an egg -- rests on the nest.
 Upon closer examination, it looks like it could be a GPS unit.

 Nagi watches you, her interest indicated by her twitching tail and
 unblinking stare. She notices you looking at the flat nest and peers at
 it with exaggerated interest.

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>take gps
 who fixes you with a flat, unmoving glare. She opens her beak, makes a
 threatening sound, and advances a step. You slowly retreat.

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>winnable
 way that I can't understand.

>go north
 Forest Clearing
 The narrow forest trail opens onto a small clearing here, where the
 kauri gives way to unhealthy-looking ferns and thin, yellowish grass.
 The trail leaves the clearing to both north and south.

 A folded sheet of what looks like notebook paper lies wedged up against
 a tree root at the edge of the clearing.

 A small dinosaur similar to the one you saw before stands here. He
 opens his mouth to let out a tentative hiss.

 Nagi scampers behind you, curious to see what adventures you have
 planned next.

 Abruptly, the male oviraptor hisses threateningly at Nagi, stomping
 back and forth in an exaggerated threat display that's as earnest as it
 is ridiculous. Nagi seems unfazed.

>take paper

 Nagi watches you, showing her interest by her tilted head and fixed
 gaze. She notices you reaching for the map, but apparently she's
 decided she's had enough of carrying things around for now, as she just
 watches you calmly.

 With a sudden lunge, the male oviraptor screeches at Nagi, rearing and
 skittering back towards the safety of a tree. Nagi makes a noise that
 sounds suspiciously like a laugh.

>go south
 Moa Nest
 The trail descends into a hollow here, free of trees. Centered in the
 valley floor is a large mound of volcanic rock, with a large boulder
 plugging up a fumarole on top. The surrounding rock is riddled with
 cracks, crevices, and fissures, and hidden in one of the larger

 Nagi saunters along in your wake, curious to see what you're up to.

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>examine map
 in the south to something marked as "camp" along the coast to the
 north. They've also marked a path northwest from "camp" to a location
 marked with an "X" and the label "dinos". The map has little tree
 shapes surrounding the "X".

 At the bottom of the map are two sets of GPS coordinates, written in
 terrible handwriting:

 Camp: 46? 11' 97" S, 179? 12' 81" W
 Dinos: 46? 10' 58" S, 179? 12' 33" W.

 Nagi watches you, curiosity evident from her twitching tail and
 unblinking stare. She notices you looking at the map and peers at it
 with exaggerated interest.

 The moa paces, fretful and silent.

>turn on radio

 "Sure, Tim. What would you like to talk about?"

 Nagi watches you intently. She makes a few halfhearted motions, trying
 to imitate calling Eruera on the field radio, but quickly gives up and
 returns to watching you.

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

 (You could ask him about the glory, the GPS, the map, or Mui.)

>tell eruera about map

 "Can you describe it to me, Tim?"

 "Sure -- it has what looks like a sketch of the forest, and there are
 two places marked with what look like latitude and longitude. One says
 'camp' and the other says 'dinos'".

 Eruera is silent for a moment as he thinks. "It certainly sounds like a
 map that poachers might have made, Tim. No way of telling if they're
 the same ones that got our ship, but it seems reasonable. The 'dinos'
 entry sounds like they've located a group of taniwha, and I think
 'camp' is pretty self-explanatory. If you can, try to go wide around
 that camp."

 The moa paces, fretful and silent.

>open crevice with stick

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>take egg
 yourself into the crevice up to your shoulder.

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>take egg with stick
 but the opening is just too narrow to get much leverage and you can't
 quite lever it out.

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>take egg with bark
 egg, but come up blank, so you just decide to take the direct approach.

 You quickly check to see if the egg has shifted any, but it's still
 just out of your direct reach.

 The moa paces, fretful and silent.

>examine volcano
 slope. It vents steam or smoke from a number of fissures. Notable among
 these are a deep crack high up on the formation, and a large crevice
 near the ground. There's also a sizable fumarole on top -- a circular
 hole about two or three feet in diameter.

 Nagi watches you, her interest indicated by her perked ears and fixed
 gaze. She notices you looking at the mound of volcanic rock and peers
 at it with exaggerated interest.

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>examine crack
 It's situated higher up on the rock formation and looks quite deep, but
 it's much narrower than the large crevice.

 Nagi watches you, showing her interest by her twitching tail and
 unconscious chittering. She notices you looking at the volcanic crack
 and peers at it with exaggerated interest.

 The moa paces, fretful and silent.

>put stick in crack

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>look in crack

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>put bark in crack

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>inventory
   a map
   a stick
   a chunk of bark
   a field radio
   a bucket, repaired with a wad of kauri gum, which is full of some
 fresh water

 Nagi watches you, her interest indicated by her tilted head and fixed
 gaze. She watches you taking stock of your possessions, then starts
 looking at herself and patting her fur in a pretty good impersonation
 of you. Her search reveals a flea, which she pops in her mouth and
 crunches with gusto.

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>plug crack

 The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the
 crevice.

>touch crack

 Nagi watches you, showing her interest by her twitching tail and
 unblinking stare. She approaches with caution, touching the volcanic
 crack as well, then looks at you.

 The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated.

>pour water in crack
 volcanic mound. The water drains inside. Shortly thereafter, a puff of
 steam blasts back out the crevice, propelling the egg along with it and
 rolling it just outside the mouth of the crevice. The moa darts forward
 as the last of the water drains, snatching the egg away with a
 triumphant squawk! She carries the egg back to the nest and places it
 there gently, flipping the GPS aside into the surrounding grass without
 a second glance.

 Nagi watches you, her interest indicated by her tilted head and
 unconscious chittering. She's fascinated by the pouring action and
 starts to jump around in excitement.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 Nagi looks at you curiously. She seems to be impressed.

>take gps

 Nagi watches you, showing her interest by her twitching tail and fixed
 gaze. She notices you reaching for the GPS, but apparently she's
 decided she's had enough of carrying things around for now, as she just
 watches you calmly.

>SAVE
>cf4

>examine gps
 It's a very simple model, with just a single button to display
 coordinates. You push the button and nothing happens. Apparently the
 GPS is out of power.

 Nagi watches you, her interest indicated by her tilted head and
 unconscious chittering. She notices you looking at the GPS and peers at
 it with exaggerated interest.

>go south

 forest thickens again, with faint animal trails leading north into the
 deeper forest and east towards the thinner trees that line the coast.
 By keeping close to the streambank, you could also manage to follow the
 water southeast down toward the shore.

 Nagi ambles along off to your side, curious to see what adventures you
 have planned next.

>go west
 Stream North
 This is the north bank of the cascading stream. Water tumbles over
 rocks as it rushes through the forest down towards the shore. To the
 east, a shallow slope of rocks and debris leads down further into the
 forest, away from the western mountains. A relatively straight, dead
 kauri tree has fallen across the stream here, bridging the banks and
 allowing you to cross to the south.

 Nagi saunters along in your wake, curious to see what you're going to
 do next.

>go south
 Stream South
 You stand at the south bank of a stream rushing down from the western
 mountains. The water flows over a tumble of rocks and its level drops
 steeply here, cutting into the ground and leaving steep, raw slopes on
 either side. An old, dead kauri tree has fallen across the stream here,
 its straight trunk making a narrow bridge to the north side.

 Nagi scampers off to your side, curious to see what you're up to.

 Suddenly, Nagi makes a lunge toward the GPS, and succeeds in knocking
 it out of your hands!

 Nagi darts forward to grab the GPS as you drop it. Luckily, she doesn't
 run off with it; she just settles down to play with it right where it
 fell.

>take gps

>go south
 Animal Trail
 The ground cover has been pushed aside by passing animals just enough
 to make this weaving trail the path of least resistance. There is a
 very tall kauri tree here, its thick roots snaking in and out of the
 ground. You can hear swiftly running water from somewhere off to the
 north. To the southwest you can see the forest lighten as it thins out,
 and the trail forks here, continuing to both the northeast and the
 north.

 Dina, who stands no taller than your shin, is nearby. She raises her
 head to issue a warbling call that sounds remarkably like a bird's,
 while continuing to watch you out of the corner of her eye.

 A shiny battery, apparently discarded or lost by someone, lies
 half-hidden by a pile of leaves that Dina is using as a nest.

 Nagi dawdles along in your wake, curious to see what you're going to do
 next.

 Suddenly, Nagi makes a lunge toward the GPS, but you snatch it away
 before she can get it away from you.

>take battery
 as you approach her nest. You retreat empty-handed, not wanting to get
 bitten.

>climb tree
 the first branches that look like they'd support your weight look like
 they could be almost thirty feet up. But you've seen this done; you
 know you can do it, and you force yourself to start climbing, not
 looking at the ground. You make some progress, but the bark gets your
 hands sticky with gum and tends to flake off at the same time, making
 climbing both dangerous and messy, and you head down again.

>nagi, take battery

>turn on radio

 "Sure, Tim. What would you like to talk about?"

 Nagi watches you intently. She makes a few halfhearted motions, trying
 to imitate calling Eruera on the field radio, but quickly gives up and
 returns to watching you.

 (You could ask him about the glory, the GPS, or Mui.)

>ask eruera about gps
 in it yet, though."

 Eruera sounds enthusiastic. "Very good, Tim, but you'll need power. If
 you could find a battery that fits it, a GPS will be a great help in
 navigating the forest."

>ask eruera about glory

 You can hear Eruera shifting a bit, trying to get more comfortable.
 "Let me tell you a quick story. Mori tradition tells of several
 different atua, or gods, of the rainbow. Kahukura is one of these -- he
 is the double rainbow that signifies that the storm has passed over.
 Another is Haere, and according to the stories he seeks to avenge the
 death of his father. At first he fails to properly respect tapu and is
 defeated, but later, with strong mana, they return to try again and are
 victorious."

 "So, Tim, perhaps we can take heart from both stories. We've certainly
 been through a great storm, and if your glory tells us that it's over,
 no wonder you felt calm and reassured. And the story of Haere -- well,
 we were certainly beaten by the poachers at first, but perhaps our mana
 will prove the stronger in a second conflict."

>ask eruera about tapu

 "I'm sorry, Tim. I don't think I can help you much with that."

 (You could ask him about Mui.)

>ask eruera about atua

 "I'm sorry, Tim. I don't know much about that."

 (You could ask him about Mui.)

 Nagi is nearby, keening a high-pitched, happy tune while  jumping from
 perch to perch and waiting for you to do something more interesting.

 Dina, who stands no taller than your shin, is nearby. She stares at you
 with intense, beady eyes, tensed to spring away.

 A shiny battery, apparently discarded or lost by someone, lies
 half-hidden by a pile of leaves that Dina is using as a nest.

 cuts through the cliff edge. You climb down as far as you can go,
 stopping at a deep ledge of dark rock that is slick with spray from the
 stream falling over the headwall above.

 Falls Bottom
 The falling stream splashes off a ledge of black volcanic rock here,
 filling the air with a haze of cool, fine droplets that weave the
 sunlight into a glory -- a circular rainbow -- about your head. There's
 only a small pool at the base of the falls -- the overflowing water
 spills over the lip and flows the short distance into the ocean.

 Nagi saunters along behind you, curious to see what you're up to.

 Moa Nest
 The trail descends into a hollow here, free of trees. Centered in the
 valley floor is a large mound of volcanic rock, with a large boulder
 plugging up a fumarole on top. The surrounding rock is riddled with
 cracks, crevices, and fissures, and hidden in one of the larger
 depressions is a very large bird's nest, which doesn't look completely
 intact. The forest trail leads upslope to both the north and south.

 Suddenly, the male oviraptor hisses threateningly at Nagi, stomping
 back and forth in an exaggerated threat display that's as earnest as it

 Tony seems utterly disinterested.

 With a sudden lunge, Tony screeches at Nagi, rearing and skittering

 Dropped.

 Nagi watches you, her interest indicated by her tilted head and fixed
 gaze. She notices you dropping the stick and checks her hands, as if
 looking to see whether she has something she can drop too. As she
 doesn't, she just sits back down and continues to observe you with
 interest.

 Suddenly, Tony charges Nagi, spitting and hissing, before quickly
 retreating back to a nearby patch of undergrowth. Nagi seems unfazed.

 very tall kauri tree here, its thick roots snaking in and out of the
 ground. You can hear swiftly running water from somewhere off to the

 and the trail forks here, continuing to both the northeast and the
 north.

 Dina, who stands no taller than your shin, is nearby. She slowly moves
 from tree to tree, searching for something while always managing to
 keep you in view.

 A shiny battery, apparently discarded or lost by someone, lies
 half-hidden by a pile of leaves that Dina is using as a nest.

 Nagi dawdles along off to your side, curious to see what adventures you
 have planned next.

 Tony stalks along behind you as he's done for some time, fixated on the
 GPS unit. But something -- possibly a scent or sound -- alerts him to
 his surroundings. He looks around the area near the trail with jerky
 head movements, until he spies Dina. The GPS is forgotten as Tony veers
 abruptly and sprints to Dina's side. Something very like a battle
 ensues, quick jabs of the dinos' heads as they peck at each other
 almost faster than you can track. Dina seems to win the fight, pinning
 Tony down and chirruping at him before releasing him to stand again.
 From there they move into some sort of complicated mating dance. From
 the intensity of their concentration, it seems almost everything else
 in the world takes second place to the performance.

 Tony and Dina continue their flirtation, although the presence of a
 bored and mischievous Nagi keeps their mating dance from taking their
 full attention.

 The two dinosaurs are engaged in an intricate and extensive mating

 to Dina, prancing with quick jerks of his neck and precise, circling
 footwork. Dina seems fascinated with the performance, and both appear

 Top of Falls
 Here a mountain stream reaches the headwall and plunges over. The water
 falls forty feet or so, splattering off a black rock ledge below before
 reforming and flowing into the ocean. The cliff is too sheer to descend

 Stream South
 You stand at the south bank of a stream rushing down from the western
 mountains. The water flows over a tumble of rocks and its level drops
 steeply here, cutting into the ground and leaving steep, raw slopes on
 either side. An old, dead kauri tree has fallen across the stream here,
 its straight trunk making a narrow bridge to the north side.

 Nagi saunters along in your wake, curious to see what you're up to.

 Stream North
 This is the north bank of the cascading stream. Water tumbles over
 rocks as it rushes through the forest down towards the shore. To the
 east, a shallow slope of rocks and debris leads down further into the
 forest, away from the western mountains. A relatively straight, dead
 kauri tree has fallen across the stream here, bridging the banks and
 allowing you to cross to the south.

 Debris Slope
 To the west, a very shallow slope of mixed scree and debris leads up to
 the bank of the mountain stream. At the bottom, where you stand, the
 forest thickens again, with faint animal trails leading north into the
 deeper forest and east towards the thinner trees that line the coast.
 By keeping close to the streambank, you could also manage to follow the
 water southeast down toward the shore.

 Nagi dawdles along in your wake, curious to see what you're up to.

>go north
 Moa Nest
 The trail descends into a hollow here, free of trees. Centered in the
 valley floor is a large mound of volcanic rock, with a large boulder
 plugging up a fumarole on top. The surrounding rock is riddled with
 cracks, crevices, and fissures, and hidden in one of the larger
 depressions is a very large bird's nest, which doesn't look completely
 intact. The forest trail leads upslope to both the north and south.

 The moa sits on her nest, calm and satisfied.

 Nagi scampers behind you, curious to see what adventures you have

 Forest Clearing
 The narrow forest trail opens onto a small clearing here, where the
 kauri gives way to unhealthy-looking ferns and thin, yellowish grass.
 The trail leaves the clearing to both north and south.

>go north
 deeper forest and head north, hoping the station is where Eruera thinks
 it is. Unfortunately, after just a few short minutes of travel, you hit
 a wall. Literally. Extending as far as you can see to the east and west
 is what must be about a twenty-foot volcanic ridge, the remnant of some
 long-ago eruption. You spend an hour or so scouting it out, trying to
 find a climbable spot, and eventually you find a place where the stone
 has crumbled and left a steep defile that you could probably scramble
 up.

 The problem is that there's an obstacle in the way -- a large,
 bony-headed dinosaur that is rubbing itself energetically against the
 broken rocks, trying to contort itself to reach a particular spot on
 its back.


 Please press SPACE to continue.








 Deep Forest
 The breeze blowing the tops of the thickly-clustered kauri makes the
 few flashes of light dance and whirl around you. The trail is all but
 lost here. A tall, sheer, charcoal-gray ridge stretches as far as you
 can see from the east to the west.

 Standing alone in the shadow of the stone ridge is a huge animal. Its
 giant, bony head and squat, powerful body mark it immediately as a
 notoceratops mori -- the largest species of dinosaur in Aotearoa, and
 therefore the biggest dinosaur in the world! It's hanging around near a
 steep defile in the rock wall, rubbing against it like it's desperate.
 It notes your presence without reaction, obviously completely
 unthreatened by your presence.

 Nagi scampers behind you, curious to see what adventures you have
 planned next.

 The notoceratops flails its head towards its back frustratedly.

 and probably measuring twenty feet from nose to tail. Its large, bony
 head lacks the flattened, shield-like flange that the more
 commonly-known triceratops sports, but the bulbous knob the
 notoceratops has instead looks just as impressive. The dinosaur's skin
 is mostly a dull gray, similar to a hippopotamus, but it has dark brown
 spots on its torso as well. It is currently standing near the defile,
 attempting to scratch itself against the rough rocks, but apparently
 failing to reach the right spot.

 to imitate calling Eruera on the field radio, but quickly gives up and
 returns to watching you.

 Fred flails its head towards its back in distress.

 (You could ask him about Fred or Mui.)

>ask eruera about fred

 Eruera chuckles a bit. "I hope you didn't run into it literally, Tim."
 You smile, even though it's not that funny. "And the great one did not
 chase you away?"

 "No, it didn't." There's a slight pause before he continues.

 "That is -- surprising. It takes both a special attitude and strong
 mana to approach the great taniwha. It is normally something that must
 be cultivated over time. That you have this gift is... interesting."

 You continue. "It looks like it might be itchy or something -- it keeps
 rolling around and rubbing against the rocks in the same area I need to
 climb up."

 "That is odd, Tim. It might have a fungus or other skin condition. You
 could probably try to scratch it. That won't fix the taniwha's problem
 permanently, but it might give it some relief so you could get past
 it."

 "Yeah, Eruera, I thought of that. But... it's... so big! It could crush
 me like a bug if it wanted to."

 Eruera is silent for a moment. "I think I see. Let me tell you a brief
 story that might help you out. It's a legend about how the Mori first
 learned to tame the taniwha."

 You wait, and in a moment he starts. "Long ago, the people came to Mui
 with a problem. 'Every year we plant kkmara -- sweet potatoes -- and
 take great care to guard them. We build tall fences to keep away the
 pkkeko -- the swamp hen -- and the old men chase them away night and
 day. Every year the kkmara grow, and every year we prepare for the
 harvest. And every year, the great taniwha come, break down the fences,
 and ravage our crop. We try to fight and chase them away, but they
 charge with heads down and scatter us like raindrops!'

 They pleaded with Mui to help them. 'We cannot continue to live when
 the taniwha eat most of our crops. Please, slay these taniwha and you
 may have anything you want as a reward.'

 Mui agreed, saying 'I will end the threat of these taniwha for you,'
 for he had heard stories of the giant taniwha and had a plan."

 Eruera pauses for a moment to catch his breath, then continues. "Mui
 lived among the people of the village as their honored guest all year,
 and there was much grumbling as the year went on, for Mui ate very
 well indeed and food was scarce.

 But finally the harvest drew near, and Mui set forth for the fields to
 confront the taniwha. The villagers were confused, as he took no
 weapon, only a large sack. 'How can he slay the taniwha without a
 spear?' they asked themselves, and the grumbling grew greater. Finally
 the villagers sent a small boy to follow Mui to make sure he did what
 he had agreed to do and didn't just run away.

 The boy saw something amazing. As the first of the taniwha approached,
 Mui stood still and silent. The taniwha stopped. Mui moved very
 slowly and smoothly, giving no offense to the great beast, and it
 didn't charge. Mui was able to walk right up to it and put his hand on
 it. Then Mui opened the bag, and inside were the kkmara he'd pretended
 to stuff himself with all year. As the boy watched, Mui pulled out a
 kkmara and fed it to the taniwha."

 Eruera pauses for a few moments. "Hours later, the boy came running
 back into the village. But before he could explain what he had seen to
 the elders, Mui appeared, riding proudly on the back of the great
 taniwha, and tossed down the empty sack. The elders were furious. 'You
 agreed to slay the taniwha, and you bring it here into our village?'

 'I never promised to slay the taniwha,' Mui responded. 'I have done
 what I promised. Remember my words. I have ended the threat of these
 taniwha to you.' The elders remembered, and although they were still
 furious, they had to agree that Mui had succeeded."

 Eruera concludes, "So the point of that story is that these taniwha
 react well to friendliness. Approach them slowly and respectfully, and
 work out a way to scratch this one's itch, and you should be quite
 safe."

 "Wow, Eruera, that's a cool story." You pause for a moment, thinking.
 It makes sense. But you do have one question. "So what did Mui choose
 as his reward?"

 You can hear the smile in Eruera's voice. "That is a story for another
 time, Tim. Good luck to you!"

 Fred snorts desperately.

 you as a threat. Your heart pounds as you get close to the twitching
 beast, but finally you're in range. You reach upwards with the stick,
 toward where you've deduced the itchy spot must be. It seems that
 you've guessed correctly, as the huge beast immediately flops down on
 the ground and tilts its back towards you to improve the angle. Once
 your heart settles down after the huge dinosaur's abrupt movement, you
 scratch away as hard as you can, and Fred's satisfied grunts indicate
 that it, at least, thinks you're doing a good job. You study the
 impressive creature as you work, fascinated with its sheer size and
 power.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 Nagi looks at you curiously. She seems to be impressed.

 ...but you're completely surprised when a deep voice from behind you
 says "Awww, isn't that cute?"

 You whirl around to see who it could be and end up with a rifle barrel
 pressed into your stomach by a tall, brown-haired man in jungle
 camouflage. "Just stay right there, boy," the man says. "You speak
 English?" He plucks the radio out of your hands and looks at it
 briefly, noting the identifying markings on it. "Working with the
 Conservation Service, eh? I don't know where you came from, but you
 aren't going to be going back to tell them about us."

 He flicks one hand at the dinosaur without taking his eyes off you, and
 several other men in similar clothing move around you toward Fred, who
 lumbers to its feet, far too slow to avoid capture. Or so it seems. One
 of the men raises what looks like another rifle and points it at the
 beast, but at the last moment Nagi rushes from the undergrowth and
 hurtles onto him, scrambling up his back before leaping to the lower
 branches of a nearby tree and disappearing again. The man jerks as he
 pulls the trigger, and a tranquilizer dart goes wide, flying into the
 forest in a high arc.

 Fred surges to its feet, bellows, and crashes off through the forest as
 the leader curses. With a curt gesture, he motions for the men to
 return and tie you up instead. "Those bloody pests! Well, at least we
 know that big dino's still around here. It won't escape us for long. In
 the meantime, you can take its spot in the cages." He smiles. "You
 never know when a Conservation Service hostage might come in handy."
 The man's rifle butt whips up towards the side of your head, and you
 see a blinding, red flash of pain, followed by blackness.


 Please press SPACE to continue.








 You awaken with a pounding headache, and your friend Nagi licking your
 temple with a raspy tongue. You can't tell whether it's the sandpaper
 sensation or the rank smell of her breath that succeeded in waking you,
 but you stagger to your feet and look around.

 Cage
 You're in a large, solidly-constructed steel cage. If the roka on the
 ground wasn't enough to tell you what these cages normally contain, the
 intermittent bellowing from the captured notoceratops in the four other
 cages makes it crystal clear. The locked door of the cage leads north,
 if you could somehow get it open.

 Nagi is nearby, sprawled out on the ground in a funk. She glances at
 you every once in a while to see what you are going to do next.

>inventory

>SAVE

>examine door
 The cage door, like the cage itself, is sturdy and solid, if not quite
 new. The bars are just slightly bent, which makes sense since they've
 been keeping live, agitated notoceratops in them. Unfortunately, the
 bend in the bars isn't enough to allow you to slip through like Nagi
 can. There's a lock mechanism on the door that looks like you could
 reach it.

 As you take a step you notice something flash at your feet. Nagi
 pounces on it and comes up with something that looks like a snippet of
 thick copper wire.

>pick lock with wire
 determination, you insert the copper wire and fiddle with the lock. The
 wire snippet is pretty stiff, and long enough to access the lock
 mechanism, but you have no real idea how to pick a lock, and all your
 fumbling does is attract attention. Nagi watches you intently, head
 cocked, trying to figure out what you're doing. And unfortunately,
 you're so engaged in trying to open the lock and fending off the
 "assistance" of Nagi that you don't notice the apparent leader of the
 poachers -- the man who hit you -- approach.

 "Well now, what's this?" He grabs your hand, painfully twisting the
 piece of wire free. "Oho, we've got Junior MacGyver here!"

 He grips your hand, holding on effortlessly as you try to twist away,
 and considers. "Amusing, son. But if I see you doing that again I'm
 going to shoot you, just on the off chance you might get lucky." He
 drops the piece of copper wire onto the ground, out of your reach.

 "Now behave, hear?" He turns on his heel and walks off.

>examine nagi
 arms, and a long, thin tail. Her head is the big tipoff that she's not
 a lemur or a monkey -- two scooped ears that swivel around when she
 listens, beady yellow eyes, and a ratlike snout make it obvious that
 this creature has to be related to bats in some way. Nagi is nearby,
 slipping back and forth through the bars to demonstrate to you how to
 leave the cell. She periodically looks at you, hoping you'll do
 something interesting.

 Nagi seems drawn to the piece of copper wire. She slips through the
 bars of the cage, unnoticed, and picks the snippet up. She then turns
 it over and over in her hands, watching how it shines in the light.

>wait
 might get out of here...

 Nagi moves over to the door lock and inserts the piece of wire,
 imitating what she saw you do before. She wiggles the wire around for a
 while, but to no effect, and she finally sits down in confusion.

>examine bolt

>lock

 Nagi cocks her head and looks quizzically at the door, considering its

 her head. After a while, she glances over at the tent the leader
 entered.

>examine tent

 Nagi bounds out of the tent, carrying something shiny! You squint to
 look more closely as she approaches, and realize with a start that it's
 the key to the lock! Nagi must have stolen it without being detected!
 She sprints across the central area of camp and leaps up onto the door
 of your cell, then jams the key into the lock and starts moving it
 around. Somewhere in all the twisting and poking, you hear a "click".

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 Nagi looks up at you and wiggles in excitement. She keeps making
 scooting motions with her head to try to direct you toward the cage
 door.

>take wire

>go north

 Center of Camp
 You slip out the cage door with care, grateful that the door hadn't
 made much noise when you opened it. Nagi jumps excitedly as you come
 out, and then scoots over to the other cages and quickly unlocks those
 as well. The notoceratops in the other cells waste little time pushing
 through the doors and heading for the hills. Unfortunately, they
 trumpet and bellow in triumph as they go. You can hear shouts from the
 alerted poachers around camp as the notoceratops scatter, but in the
 confusion no one has yet noticed your escape. You look to the east,
 towards the boats, but in a stroke of very bad luck you notice two men
 off in that direction pointing at the dinosaurs and starting to run in
 your direction.

 This seems to be the center of the poachers' encampment. A banked
 campfire is in the center of a small cleared space here, a small, newer
 tent is set up to the north, and a collection of large cages is set to
 the south. To the east, a short trail leads down a slope to a beach,
 where the poachers keep their boats.

 Nagi is nearby, zigzagging back and forth as you run and occasionally
 surging towards the west before returning to circle you again.

 The formerly-imprisoned notoceratops spread out quickly and rampage
 around camp, trying to find their way out and avoiding the poachers who
 are trying to round them back up. Luckily, no one seems to have spotted
 you yet, although the men from the east are steadily approaching.

 Poacher Camp
 You set out to the west, hoping to use the exodus of the dinosaurs to
 cover your escape, and staying low. As you near the outskirts of camp,
 you duck behind a partially-disassembled jeep for some cover.

 The poachers' camp borders the wilderness here. Deep ruts in the ground
 mark the likely spot where their vehicle is parked when it's not in
 use. One large tent lies to the south. To the northwest a crude road
 leads back into the forest, and you could also reach the forest to the
 southwest over a short rise and across a stretch of open field. The
 main portion of the camp is to the east.

 Nagi is nearby, zigzagging back and forth as you run and occasionally
 surging towards the southwest before returning to circle you again.

 The dinosaurs are fleeing the camp, pursued by poachers with guns, who
 are piling into a jeep. Apparently (and certainly fortunately), no one
 has yet seen you.

 Tree Screen
 You set out across the open space to the southeast, staying low and
 heading for the treeline, still unseen. And it seems to be going well
 until one of the men gets bowled over by a notoceratops and sees you as
 he gets back to his feet.

 "Hey! That kid's loose! He's getting away! Get him!"

 You've never been happier to see the thick forest -- you've got a good
 chance of losing your pursuers in here, you figure. The grasses of the
 slope to the northeast give way to ferns and kauri trees as the animal
 trail leads off into the shaded forest to the west.

 Nagi is nearby, alternating between chittering anxiously at you and
 scampering up your leg to your shoulder, looking towards the west.

 You hear shouts from your pursuers. "He's getting away! Faster,
 dammit!"

>go west
 Debris Slope
 You dash up the animal trail, trying to keep distance over your
 pursuers, but they're much fresher and do a good job of keeping up with
 you. You burst from the undergrowth near the slope of scree.

 To the west, a very shallow slope of mixed scree and debris leads up to
 the bank of the mountain stream. At the bottom, where you stand, the
 forest thickens again, with faint animal trails leading north into the
 deeper forest and east towards the thinner trees that line the coast.
 By keeping close to the streambank, you could also manage to follow the
 water southeast down toward the shore.

 Nagi is nearby, trying to lead the way to the north as she flies over
 obstacles with amazing speed.

 The pursuing men aren't shouting any more, but you can hear them
 crashing through the ferns and undergrowth. They're not far behind you.

>go north
 Moa Nest
 Turning abruptly, you head for the north at a dead sprint, bursting
 into the moa's hollow, causing her to squawk in alarm before she
 recognizes you. Your lungs are burning and you aren't sure how long you
 can keep this pace up.

 The trail descends into a hollow here, free of trees. Centered in the
 valley floor is a large mound of volcanic rock, with a large boulder
 plugging up a fumarole on top. The surrounding rock is riddled with
 cracks, crevices, and fissures, and hidden in one of the larger
 depressions is a very large bird's nest, which doesn't look completely
 intact. The forest trail leads upslope to both the north and south.

 Nagi is nearby, alternating between chittering anxiously at you and
 scampering up your leg to your shoulder, looking towards the north.

 The moa seems alert and agitated, but sticks near her nest and egg.

 Behind you, a group of pursuers rushes into the hollow. This second
 disruption alarms the moa, who stands, draws herself up to her full
 twelve feet of height, and challenges the newcomers from her nest. The
 poachers ignore the bird, instead pointing at you and calling out in
 excitement. "There he is! Grab that kid!"

>go north
 Forest Clearing
 You skirt the fumarole, heading farther up the trail toward the deeper
 forest, and although your exhausted body keeps telling you there's no
 way you'll make it, you keep pushing forward anyway. Unfortunately, the
 main danger isn't behind you.

 "Kai a te kur+! Gotcha, you little troublemaker!" A tall Mori man
 wearing camouflage clothing and carrying a rifle rounds the corner
 directly ahead of you and grabs your shoulder, crunching the bones
 painfully. Almost before you realize what's happening, Nagi leaps onto
 your shoulder with a great bound and sinks her sharp little teeth into
 the man's hand! "hah, what the hell?"

 He whips his hand off your shoulder to smack little Nagi, evoking a
 screech of rage. You twist free, sprinting towards the forest to the
 north, hoping there aren't any more poachers ahead of you on the trail.

 The narrow forest trail opens onto a small clearing here, where the
 kauri gives way to unhealthy-looking ferns and thin, yellowish grass.
 The trail leaves the clearing to both north and south.

 As you continue, you hear a shout of rage, and then a horrible,
 high-pitched squeal of pain. Despite your desperation, you slow for a
 second and risk a quick glance behind you. No sign of Nagi.

 I hope she's OK. If she can just get into the trees she should be
 fine...

>go north
 Deep Forest
 You keep running, glancing to the side and over your shoulder, hoping
 to catch a glimpse of brown fur or beady yellow eyes, but you don't see
 anything. The forest seems silent, aside from the breath burning in and
 out of your lungs as you keep running north, heading for the defile you
 found earlier.

 The breeze blowing the tops of the thickly-clustered kauri makes the
 few flashes of light dance and whirl around you. The trail is all but
 lost here. A tall, sheer, charcoal-gray ridge stretches as far as you
 can see from the east to the west.

 Fred stands here, complacent and slowly munching plants with its
 powerful jaws as it watches you arrive, at a run and out of breath. It
 holds your gaze for a few eternal seconds, then slowly kneels down, as
 if in invitation.

 You stumble to a stop in front of the dinosaur. Maybe it's the fatigue
 blurring your vision, but you seem to see it with a strange kind of
 double vision -- as the powerful lord of the forest, but also as the
 Mori do -- as an avenging spirit, the taniwha, the protector of the
 land. You and Fred hold motionless, watching each other for what seems
 like hours, but eventually the sounds of cursing men crashing through
 the ferns breaks the spell.

>ride fred
 destined. You may be running for your life, but as you near the massive
 dinosaur there's a timeless moment when you can forget that -- can feel
 something like what those Mori warriors of legend must have felt
 before charging into battle on the backs of beasts just like this one.

 As if in a dream, you climb up onto the taniwha's back. It seems high
 up, and that's before it stands, but for once you aren't afraid, and it
 feels so good to leave that fear back on the ground. You can actually
 see that little Mori boy from your visions sitting on the beast's back
 along with you, even though you know he can't be real. He has a wild
 grin on his face, and when you see it, you feel a thrill of contagious
 excitement. As it rises, the power and size of the beast you ride makes
 you feel like a superhero, or a Greek demigod like Hercules.

 (While riding Fred, you can try to control its movements. Use the
 command FASTER to urge it to greater speed, SLOWER to try to slow it
 down, and LEFT and RIGHT to try to shift the direction it's moving in.)

 the wide trail back toward the poacher camp.

 They almost got me in the forest; my only chance is to get through to

 hoping to spur Fred out of its jolting trot. It responds, speeding up
 to a full, charging run! You can barely hold on as it hurtles onward
 toward the poacher camp.

 Poacher Camp (on Fred, facing southeast and running)
 The poachers' camp borders the wilderness here. Deep ruts in the ground
 mark the likely spot where their vehicle is parked when it's not in
 use. One large tent lies to the south. To the northwest a crude road
 leads back into the forest, and you could also reach the forest to the
 southwest over a short rise and across a stretch of open field. The
 main portion of the camp is to the east.

 One of the remaining jeeps roars into life, several armed men hanging
 on as the driver spins the wheel and tries to cut you off. The jeep is
 just to the left of Fred's head, blocking the way into the center of
 the poacher encampment.

>right

 pulling the heavy fabric down and quickly ensnaring even the powerful
 notoceratops. You don't get a chance to find out what the poachers
 might do to you, as Fred, in its futile thrashing attempts to escape,
 crushes the life out of you.

 sure it's going to cooperate -- that it's finally had enough of you
 tugging and prodding at it -- but at the last minute Fred lowers its
 massive head, puts on an extra burst of speed, bellows in fury, and
 charges to the left. You catch one glimpse of the men on the jeep, eyes
 wide, raising their hands in a futile instinctive attempt to ward off
 the charging beast. And then you're upon them, Fred's bony head
 slamming into the side of the jeep with a tremendous crash as you brace
 against the shock. The impact knocks the jeep clear over onto its side
 and sends men sprawling in all directions! You're thrown forward by the
 impact and take quite a thump from the back of the dinosaur's bony head
 plate. You start to slip off to the right, but manage to hang on --
 barely -- with one hand.

 The jeep's engine cuts out with a heavy sound of clunking metal, and
 before any of the men can even lift their heads from the ground, you
 and Fred barrel east into the center of the camp.

 Center of Camp
 Fred barrels into the center of the camp in a berserk fury, charging at
 the tents and lashing out at the cages, whirling and stomping in a
 frenzy. You hold on for dear life, but when the taniwha rears and
 twists almost completely around, your grip loosens and you spin to the
 ground in a painful heap. You scramble to the side to avoid being
 trampled.

 This seems to be the center of the poachers' encampment. A banked
 campfire is in the center of a small cleared space here, a small, newer
 tent is set up to the north, and a collection of large cages is set to
 the south. To the east, a short trail leads down a slope to a beach,
 where the poachers keep their boats.

 In the general chaos you think you might again slip away unnoticed, but
 one of the cowering poachers to the west has apparently spotted you and
 is moving to intercept as Fred continues its destructive frenzy. You
 quickly shift to the side to avoid being stepped on, and consider your
 possible escape routes.

 North Beach
 You scramble in what seems to be the only safe direction -- down
 towards the beach. In all the confusion, you can't see whether you're
 being followed or not, but the chaos won't last forever. You scan the
 shoreline, evaluating your possible escape options.

 This thin beach of grey sand curves around a shallow bay, with rough,
 broken rock blocking travel to the north and south. Waves lap at the
 shore in the mild breeze, rocking the boats moored here. A path rises
 up to the west towards the poachers' camp.

 A fairly large and weathered transport ship is here, partially hidden
 under frayed camouflage netting.

 A small speedboat, patched and covered with camouflage netting, is
 beached on the strand nearby.

 As you move toward the shoreline, the poacher you noticed earlier
 crests the top of the ridge, rifle slung over his back. He scans the
 shore, stops when he sees you, and starts down at a jog, unlimbering
 his weapon.

>enter speedboat
 with the controls.

 The speedboat looks like it's seen better days -- its hull has been
 patched in numerous places and it's been covered with camouflage
 netting to keep it hidden. The motor looks pretty big, though. You're
 in a bit too much of a hurry to take much time going over the controls
 at this point, but the obvious ones include an ignition button and a
 steering wheel. A life preserver and attached coil of line sit at the
 aft end of the boat.

 The armed man starts to run, visibly agitated. "Get away from the
 boats, kid!" He snaps a shot at you, but he's not that good at shooting
 on the run, and he misses.

>push ignition
 You grit your teeth, hoping the motor is fueled and ready to go, and
 stab the red ignition button. After a couple seconds of grinding, the
 motor roars to life and a wave of relief washes over you. You ease the
 throttle lever up to a middling range and pull away from shore just as
 the man with the gun reaches the beach at a dead sprint and levels his
 rifle at you.

 All of a sudden, you spot something small, furry and familiar sprinting
 through the poacher's legs and running toward the boat. As she reaches
 the shore, Nagi makes an impossible leap into the air, arms stretched
 out wide, towards the speedboat. And she almost makes it. She manages
 to grab at the back end of the boat, but ends up pulling the life
 preserver overboard and both she and it fall into the ocean.

 As the boat moves out into the bay, Nagi and the life preserver float
 behind, but the line starts to silently spool out of its coil, and you
 notice the line's other end isn't tied to anything. In a short time, it
 and Nagi will be gone.

 You glance back to shore, just in time to see the flash of a shot that
 apparently missed you, since you still seem to be alive.
 The boat motors away from shore, further into the clear blue waters of
 the bay. The shoreline runs from north to south here, with nothing but
 the wide ocean to the east.

 Nagi, sopping wet and struggling, hangs onto the life preserver with a
 deathgrip as the boat pulls away. The line attached to the life
 preserver continues to spool smoothly into the sea as the distance
 increases, but there's still some left.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>pull line
 and Nagi into the boat. Wasting no time, you hunch back to the seat,
 plant yourself, and slam the lever all the way to "H". The boat leaps
 forward, throwing water into the sky and pushing a huge wake out to the
 sides as you rocket out into the bay, leaving the poacher on shore with
 no shot but wild ones. You can feel a power -- strong mana surrounding
 you with destiny, and you know somehow that his shots will lack all
 potency against you.

 Nagi scampers forward and leaps onto your shoulder, dripping seawater
 and chattering in ecstasy as you slew the craft towards the south. You
 know how it's going to be -- you'll make it back to Eruera, pick him
 up, and head for the closest Conservation Service coastal watch
 station. You know it, and as the air and sea rush past you, you seem to
 see the little Maori boy off on the horizon, smiling his wild,
 triumphant smile. You can feel his presence all the way as you roar
 down to the familiar shore where Eruera waits for you, waving and
 laughing in amazement, ready to hear your tale and leave this coast
 with you to find the station and rescue and, with luck, some justice.

 just a bit, but you still have to trot a little to keep up. You stop at
 the edge of the clearing, and Eruera turns to you and gently lifts Nagi
 from your shoulder. "I'll take care of Nagi for you until next year,
 OK?" He smiles reassuringly and claps your shoulder. "And don't worry,
 she'll remember you! These little ones do not often take a liking to
 people, but once they do their loyalty is legendary."

 You pet Nagi for a while, and she chirps and bleeks contentedly as you
 blink away some dust the helicopter must have kicked up when it landed.
 It's time, I guess. You shake Eruera's hand, turn away, and push
 through the growing wind as the helicopter's blades begin to spin up.
 As you approach, the pilot pushes the cockpit door open and beckons you
 aboard, a lopsided smile on his face. You step up, fasten your harness,
 and put on your helmet. Once the intercom is enabled, the pilot speaks.
 "So, you are the notorious Tim Cooper? The pkeh toa that caught the
 taniwha raiders?"

 "Yes, I'm Tim."

 The helicopter rises into the air and you wave at Eruera and Nagi as
 you tilt forward and pick up speed. "Kia ora, Tim! Good to have you
 aboard! We'll get you over to headquarters in about 45 minutes!" Very
 little time before you get to New Port Nelson and start your long hours
 of official debriefing and depositions.

 You take a moment to reflect back on the last two weeks. The memories
 blur together, but your almost unrecognizable Program t-shirt reads
 like a diary -- rips and green stains from the amazing adventure of
 that first day, grease spots from the paua skewers you scarfed down at
 the crazy celebratory beach barbecue after your rescue, the giant
 mudstain when you skidded down thirty steep feet of Te Apiti ravine on
 your back and side, in hot pursuit of a group of spiny-backed taniwha.

 The clearing is nothing but a light green dot in the darker green of
 the forest, far behind you, and you slump back in your seat. You can't
 believe it's over already; it seems like only a day or two since you
 got here. But you hold tight to one hope. Eruera was sure you could
 come back next year. "They're going to remember the name 'Tim Cooper',"
 he said, grinning. "I'll make sure of that! All you have to do is get
 your application in next year and you'll be on your way back." Back in
 the forest, back working with the taniwha and the Conservation Service.
 Back with Nagi. A year isn't so long to wait, right?
