 Ser Leonhart, the bravest knight in all the land, points his sword at
 the fortress before him. Lightning strikes in the distance,
 illuminating the battlements below impatient clouds. A light rain
 begins to fall.

 "Behold, the Impenetrable Keep," he says. "At long last, I shall slay
 the evil shapeshifting wizard, rescue the princess and return peace to
 our fair kingdom."

 The young Squire Tuck clambers up the last stretch of steep mountain
 path. "Golly... milord," he says, struggling to catch his breath.
 "Must we go in there?"

 The knight's hair ripples in a swift breeze. "Fear not, my
 apprehensive accomplice. While no evil can withstand the heavy fist of
 justice, you must remember our secret weapon—the wizard sniffer
 shall
 sniff out the villain for us!"

 He prods you forward with the side of his boot, and you let out a
 disgruntled <span class="floydstyle em">oink</span>. To think you had successfully escaped this
 place the night before last, only to be brought back again.

 Well, it could be worse. You could be bacon.

 <span class="floydstyle header">The Wizard Sniffer</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by Buster Hudson
 Release 1 / Serial number 171007 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 You stand before the raised drawbridge of an evil fortress. A murky,
 foul-smelling moat reflects not even a little bit of light. A rubbish
 bin festers beneath a cloud of flies.

 "My feet are ever so angry," says Tuck, "and terrible things have
 found their way between my toes. Might we rest here before walking
 further, milord?" His master nods in approval, and the squire sits on
 the ground and takes off his shoes.

 "One does not simply walk into the Impenetrable Keep," says Ser
 Leonhart. "First, I must devise a way across this moat." He rubs his
 chin.

>examine me


 While your current owners know you as a wizard sniffer, you are, as
 far as you can tell, an ordinary pig (which you do not recommend being
 if it can be avoided).

 You recently managed a fortuitous escape from the Impenetrable
 Keep—a
 remarkable feat involving magick, mayhem and a fair bit of puzzle
 solving. Your luck, however, would not last. As you dragged your weary
 body down the mountain and into the nearest town, you were spotted and
 subsequently claimed by a wandering capitalist.

 The capitalist, later happening upon the dim-witted knight and his
 squire at a roadside tavern, separated them from their large sack of
 gold by claiming you had the ability to sniff out evil wizards. As it
 turns out, this is not something you can actually do. Nevertheless,
 you feel it to be in your best interest to play the part as best you
 can.

 For now.

>examine bin


 It appears to be awaiting collection.

>sniff bin


 You sniff the rubbish bin, and Ser Leonhart extends his sword.

 "The evil wizard is hiding in the bin! The time has come to take out
 the trash." Smiling at his own wit, he kicks the bin and turns over
 its contents. His squire joins him in sifting through the refuse in
 search of the wizard.

 Much to your surprise, the bin was full of old puzzles. You find a
 stack of discs with three wooden rods on a stand, a sliding set of
 tiles numbered one through fifteen, a scale with many coins, a pair of
 jugs (one 5-pint and one 3-pint), several heavy blocks and pressure
 plates, a book of riddles and a number of other items not immediately
 identifiable.

 "Freedom!" From within the pile comes a tiny voice, too tiny for the
 others to hear. By the time you notice the two fleas hopping towards
 you, they have already jumped onto your face and claimed the first
 suitable piece of real estate they could find, below your left ear.
 You attempt to scratch them away.

 "Wait! Wait! Help return us to our original forms, and we shall be
 your guides!" cries a flea. "We know exactly what you should do!"

 "Aye! Simply oink, and we shall give you a hint," says the other. "But
 take heed, for one of us always tells the truth and one of us always
 lies."

 It seems the knight-and-knave fleas are along for the ride, whether
 you like it or not.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Hi. It's me, the author, and I'm here to tell you that you can</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">now use the verb OINK to get a hint from the fleas. You can also type</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">HINT in case you find typing OINK to be too silly. Note that asking</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">for a hint does not take any time within the game.]</span>

>examine riddles


 Some puzzles are old, others are broken, and they are all terribly
 cliché.

>smell puzzles


 You sniff the puzzles. Ser Leonhart searches them for signs of the
 evil wizard, but finds none.

>examine moat


 One might assume the waters are only black in colour, but the stench
 that rises from their depths hints at something much fouler.

>sniff moat


 The moat is exceptionally putrid, so you pretend to sniff it.

 "The evil wizard is hiding in the moat!" shouts Ser Leonhart, drawing
 his sword. And with a mighty leap, he disappears into the foetid
 waters, only to emerge a minute or so later.

 Tuck helps him onto land. He tries not to breathe through his nose.
 "What happened, milord?"

 "He got away," says the knight, wringing the black water out of his
 golden tresses. "We shall let him savour his victory, for now."

>examine drawbridge


 The raised drawbridge is held up by sturdy ropes. One such rope
 extends across the moat.

>examine rope


 It connects the drawbridge to a lever on your side of the moat.

>examine lever


 It stands beside a sign.

>examine sign


 It reads: PULL TO LOWER BRIDGE.

>sniff lever


 You sniff the lever.

 "Aha!" cries Ser Leonhart, pushing you aside and pointing his sword at
 the thing. "Did you think your disguise would fool us, evil wizard?
 For the good of the kingdom, I shall cut you down!" With one graceful
 sweep of his blade, he removes the lever from where it stood. It
 clatters noisily to the ground, then lies still.

 "The deed is done," says Ser Leonhart, sheathing his sword. "The
 kingdom is safe once more. Let us remember all who have sacrificed
 themselves for this victory." He bows his head in silence.

 Tuck picks up the lever and inspects it thoroughly. "Milord, forgive
 me for not remembering the sacrifices, but, would not a dead evil
 wizard mayhap look like a dead evil wizard?"

 Ser Leonhart seizes the lever and narrows his eyes at it. "Aye, my
 attentive attendant. It seems we have been deceived by an ordinary
 wooden stick. The evil wizard is craftier than I expected. We must
 remain vigilant if we hope to defeat him." He hands the lever back to
 Tuck, who swings it enthusiastically like a sword before it slips
 through his fingers and disappears into the moat with a
 <span class="floydstyle em">plunk</span>.

>sniff moat


 You pretend to sniff it.

 "He's returned to the moat!" shouts Ser Leonhart as he leaps into the
 foetid waters once more, only to emerge with naught more than a frown.

>sniff rope


 You sniff the rope.

 "For justice!" cries Ser Leonhart, and with one great stroke of his
 gleaming sword, he severs the rope in two. Down comes the drawbridge,
 making as much noise as possible (as falling drawbridges tend to do).
 When the dust clears, the duo discovers the way into the keep has
 opened to the north.

 "A brilliant success, milord!" cheers Tuck.

 Ser Leonhart poses like a titan holding up the sky. His hair dances in
 another breeze. "Not even the Impenetrable Keep can stop the heavy
 fist of justice. All you need is confidence, my timid tenderfoot, and
 you can accomplish that which your heart most desires."

 "I shall keep working on my confidence, milord," says Tuck, holding
 his hair up for the wind to take.

>go north



 As you scurry across the drawbridge, the rain grows heavier.

 "He has the wizard's scent," says Ser Leonhart, pulling Tuck to his
 feet. "Let us make haste!"

 And so, the brave knight and his squire follow you into the
 now-penetrable Impenetrable Keep. Passing beneath the outer walls, you
 come upon the lower bailey, a muddy yard lying at the foot of the
 inner keep. A dogtower rises from the centre of the bailey to the
 north. You can also go northeast or northwest, to the respective east
 and west ends of the bailey.

>examine tower


 The stone dogtower stands in the centre of the bailey.

>examine yard


 This is the southern end of the bailey. You can go north, northeast,
 northwest or south across the drawbridge. Tuck and Ser Leonhart wait
 nearby.

>go north



 You lead the knight and his squire to a doghouse shaped like a
 miniature tower. Hence, a dogtower. During your last escape, the
 dogtower housed an overly playful pomeranian. You have no desire to
 repeat the encounter.

 Attached to the dogtower is a long, thick chain. At first, you wonder
 why such a small dog would need such a thick chain, until you realise
 the chain is not wrapped around the neck of a pomeranian. The chain is
 wrapped around the neck of a sleeping dragon.

 "Is-is that a... is-is that a..." asks Tuck, the rest of his question
 lodged in his throat.

 Ser Leonhart covers the young squire's mouth. "Aye, my quivering
 companion," he whispers, "we have stumbled upon the fiercest creature
 of them all. Let us keep quiet, lest we learn whether it has a taste
 for human flesh."

>examine dragon


 When it comes to dragons, the stories say not even the sharpest steel
 can pierce their armoured scales. Even though this dragon is sleeping,
 you are relieved to see the chain about its neck. Barely visible
 beneath one of its claws is a ball.

>examine ball


 One of those playthings for peasant children or dogs. It's not very
 large and can be held easily in one hand. Or a pig's mouth, given you
 are in possession of one.

>examine tuck


 The ever-faithful Squire Tuck might be taking his first brave steps
 into manhood, but he most closely resembles an underfed parrot. To his
 credit he is not necessarily an unsightly one. His slender frame may
 not help him accomplish any grand feats, but one could argue his
 mettle more than makes up for it.

>sniff tuck


 You sniff the young squire.

 Ser Leonhart casts Tuck a suspicious glare and draws his sword. "So,
 evil wizard, you think you could kidnap my squire and take his place?
 For justice, I will strike you down!"

 Tuck throws his arms in the air and tumbles backwards. "Wait, milord!
 It's me, your faithful servant!"

 The knight halts his blade shy of justice. "Oh, it is you," he says.
 "That was nearly a misunderstanding." He returns his sword to his
 side.

>examine chain


 It's wrought of iron and as thick as Tuck is thin.

>examine knight


 Ser Leonhart is a knight, which is to say he is the quintessential
 man. If asked about his countenance, the good people of the kingdom
 would tell you the gods, in their quest for perfection, carved him out
 of the very lands he swore an oath to protect. They would say his eyes
 shimmer like the crystal blue sea beneath a radiant sun; his hair,
 amber and billowy, cascades from his noble brow like lush, wind-lashed
 fields of grain before the autumn harvest; his jaw is strong, defined
 and unyielding like the great walls that guard the borders against the
 demi-human hordes; and his massive suit of platemail leaves little
 doubt as to the robustness of the regions beneath.

 Yet to you he is a rather average fellow, with ruddy skin, a mop of
 blond hair and a long nose. No matter how hard you try, you are unable
 to gaze upon him with such admiration, and you wonder if it ought to
 do with being an ordinary pig.

 He carries with him a great sword and a shield emblazoned with the
 Leonhart family standard—a lion on checks of burgundy and gold.
 Tucked
 into his belt is a wrinkled flyer.

>examine flyer


 The knight has gazed at the flyer with sufficient frequency for you to
 memorise both the crudely-drawn depiction of a princess and the text
 beneath. It read:

 Citizens of our most great and virtuous kingdom,

 On the twenty-third day of Maya, Her Royal Highness, Princess Joyanna
 Marianna Novellanna Montcabernet Savignon (Princess Joy), hath been
 kidnapped by the most evil of wizards, Queklain, who, in the form of a
 most fearsome dragon, hath taken her against her will to his
 Impenetrable Keep for the most nefarious of purposes. Henceforce and
 whatwith, whoever among the most noble of heroes, who possesseth the
 most courage and virtue, who rescueth her from the most terrible of
 fates, shall earneth the king's most bountiful blessing to requesteth
 her hand in marriage, and receiveth the most royal dowry of ten
 million doubloons.

 Signeth,
 His Most Royal Highness, King Aurelius Audacious Latinus Montcabernet
 Savignon XXVIII.

 You soon discovered neither the knight nor his squire possess the
 ability to read. Ser Leonhart has, however, learned a mere two words
 in his travels—Princess Joy—which he recited over and over like a
 prayer from the Good Books. This would be accompanied by a wistful
 look at the sky, or perhaps a fist over his heart and a vow to the
 gods he will either finish his quest or die trying.

>sniff dragon


 Ser Leonhart watches you at first, his noble features etched with
 worry as you sniff around the dragon's wicked claws. Then,
 comprehension arrives like the first rays of the morning sun. "Oh,
 what a fool I am!" he shouts. Tuck gasps and pulls his doublet up over
 his nose.

 The knight strides gallantly forward, drawing his sword. "Were I an
 evil shapeshifting wizard, would I not take the form of a mighty
 dragon? You are clever, evil one, but you cannot outwit justice!" He
 stabs the dragon in the neck, but his blade bounces harmlessly aside.

 The dragon stirs. With a yawn like a smoking chimney it rolls
 languidly upright and, spotting the knight, begins to bark excitedly.
 The ball escapes to the side.

 Ser Leonhart is as still as a statue. "Listen carefully, Tuck," he
 whispers, "and make not the slightest movement. Dragons cannot see
 what does not move. In the meantime, I shall determine a plan of—"

 The dragon leaps onto Ser Leonhart, pinning him to the ground and
 licking his face. The knight struggles to free himself. "Save
 yourself, Tuck!" he shouts. "Send word to the king I have been
 devoured by a dragon!" He prepares himself for digestion.

>take ball


 Taken.

>sniff knight


 You would rather not move so close to the dragon.

>look


 You stand beside the dogtower in the centre of the bailey. Ser
 Leonhart is struggling to free himself from beneath the dragon. Tuck
 is more affected than usual.

>go west



 Tuck follows you to the western end of the bailey. You can continue
 northeast towards the inner keep's entrance or southeast towards the
 drawbridge.

 A red pail lies on its side.

>examine pail


 It's painted red. The words "IN CASE OF FIRE" are written across its
 side.

>drop ball


 Dropped.

>go northeast



 Tuck follows you across the bailey, arriving at the double doors of
 the inner keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the south, with the
 rest of the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

>examine doors


 Massive and ominous, they stand guard over the inner keep to the
 north. Inset in the bottom of one of the doors is a doggy door.

 To be more specific, someone cut a jagged shape in the bottom of the
 door, reached a point best described as "good enough" and nailed a
 scrap of leather over the hole to call it a day. But, for all intents
 and purposes, you may call it a doggy door, and simply moving in its
 direction will allow you to pass through it.

>se



 Tuck follows you to the eastern end of the bailey. You can continue
 west towards the dogtower or southwest towards the drawbridge.

>go northwest



 Tuck follows you across the bailey, arriving at the double doors of
 the inner keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the south, with the
 rest of the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

>go north


 You squeeze through the doggy door into the foyer of the inner keep.
 Tales woven by the commonfolk have always described the wizard's keep
 as naught more than a drab and dreary labyrinth. Yet instead of rough
 stone floors and draughty corridors, the keep is brimming with warm
 rooms full of lavish furnishings, vibrant purple alpaca carpeting,
 traditional fleuret-patterned wallpaper in silver and gold and stepped
 cornices sculpted into dancing putti.

 The foyer itself is grand indeed, stretching three storeys high and
 lit from a skylight at the very top. To the north is an outdoor
 courtyard, to the west a darkened hallway and to the east a well-lit
 hallway. A circular staircase curves upwards around a clockwork lift,
 two options for reaching the balconies above.

 You notice the decorations have yet to be removed. Great swathes of
 white fabric are draped from the balconies, and bouquets of baby's
 breath still run along the walls. A wooden crate sits unmoved in the
 centre of the room. A poster on an easel reads: "Welcome to the most
 assuredly legal wedding of Master Tristain Girard and Her Royal
 Highness, Joyanna Marianna Novellanna Montcabernet Savignon (Princess
 Joy). The ceremony will be held in the ballroom beyond the courtyard."
 Beneath the text, an arrow points to the north.

>examine crate


 The words FIREWORKS FOR AFTER CEREMONY are written on the side.

>examine poster


 It reads: "Welcome to the most assuredly legal wedding of Master
 Tristain Girard and Her Royal Highness, Joyanna Marianna Novellanna
 Montcabernet Savignon (Princess Joy). The ceremony will be held in the
 ballroom beyond the courtyard." Beneath the text, an arrow points to
 the north.

>examine lift


 Upon the advent of the clockwork engine a few decades ago, clockwork
 gadgets became an instant trend. Only the rich could afford these
 mechanical marvels, and even fewer could afford something as grand as
 a lift.

 This one is closed.

>examine wallpaper


 So lavish.

>examine carpet


 You cannot see any such thing.

>examine carpetry


 You cannot see any such thing.

>go east



 You head down a long hallway lined with portraits. Ahead to the east
 is a closed door.

>examine door


 A solid wooden door. The doors of the keep used to contain puzzles to
 solve in order to open them. It appears they have all been removed.

>examine portraits


 The row of portraits features men and women radiating wealth and
 nobility. Each possesses the same upturned noses and downturned
 frowns. They scowl at you disdainfully from their perches with rich,
 violet eyes.

 Beneath each portrait is a gold plate engraved with a single name.
 From left to right, they read: Adelstain, Morgaine, Rogaine, Gawain,
 Romaine, Elaine, Queklain. The end of the row, bearing the name
 Tristain, is an empty frame.

>examine queklain


 The evil wizard Queklain. From up close, he resembles little of a
 wizard, except for being a bit grumpy. His robes are fairly pedestrian
 compared to the rest, and the painting itself is inferior in quality,
 which might have given him something to be grumpy about.

>examine elaine


 Elaine forwent the family tradition of wearing finery to her sitting,
 instead choosing a simple workman's outfit and knotting her hair in a
 silk handkerchief. Her only piece of jewellery is a pendant in the
 shape of a jigsaw puzzle piece about her neck.

>examine pendant


 You cannot see any such thing.

>examine gawain


 This was painted when an excess of beard-curls and ribbons was all the
 rage at court. Gawain was a victim of the times in the worst sort of
 way.

>go west



 You continue to the foyer of the inner keep. To the north is a
 courtyard, to the west is a darkened hallway and to the south are the
 closed double doors to the bailey. A circular staircase curves around
 a lift to the balcony above.

 A poster announcing the wedding of Tristain and Princess Joy directs
 guests to the north. Near the poster is a wooden crate.

>go north



 The cold rain greets you once more as you proceed to the outdoor
 courtyard, the way forward continuing beyond a colonnade to the north.
 High stone walls constrict the courtyard on all sides, but a
 collection of elegant rose bushes and the gentle murmuring of water
 from the central fountain soften the edges of the enclosed space.
 Stairs descend below the wall to the west.

 A goblin engineer, seemingly unbothered by the rain, is busy repairing
 the dislocated leg of a suit of mechanical armour. She frowns as you
 waddle across the cobblestones.

 "Oy, piggy! What sort of magicks saw piggy free from the sty? Tis
 Robbit's problem, Rhoda thinks. His Lordship must needs his keep
 protected from more heroes. Rhoda will burn them all crispy crispy,
 Rhoda will!" She proudly pats the armour before returning to the task
 at hand.

>examine rhoda


 The goblin engineer looks like goblins in any other line of work,
 except this one dons a pair of goggles. She stands nary four hands
 high, her skin only slightly green and her ears decidedly droopy. She
 attempted to tame her wild red hair in two buns on either side of her
 head, achieving little success.

>examine suit


 Security only nobility can afford. Even the Royal Palace only
 maintains a dozen of them. This one is a equipped with a flamethrower.

>examine roses


 The thorny branches bear red roses in full bloom.

>examine fountain


 The fountain is a large pool of water encased by stone. The statue in
 its centre depicts a cockatrice hen feeding her chicks in the manner
 of most birds, the act represented by the water pouring out of her
 mouth. At the hen's feet are the remains of a human, ravaged, with
 their ribs exposed through torn meat.

 You think the artist may have been making a statement about the
 lengths one must go to provide for one's children. Or perhaps they
 simply enjoy monsters and gore.

>go north



 You pass beneath the colonnade into a magnificent ballroom decorated
 for a wedding.

 At one end stands the altar, framed by a wooden arbour painted white
 and entwined with roses from the garden. Standing below the arbour is
 a full-sized statue of Cupido, god of love, music, romance fiction and
 scented candles. A simple table is bare, but you know it was to hold a
 glass mug, from which the bride and groom both drink a bitter craft
 beer to symbolise the strength of their union in even the worst of
 times. A few dozen chairs are arranged for optimal viewing.

 All together the wedding looks like it could have been quite lovely.
 Not that you would have enjoyed it, of course. Not at all.

>examine cupido


 According to myth, love is born between two souls when Cupido plays
 his guitar at them. The myth has since evolved into a tradition where
 men serenade women at their windows late at night in an attempt to woo
 them.

 You take the opportunity to renew your commitment to atheism.

>examine altar


 A simple table is the focal point of the altar.

>examine arbour


 The red roses and green vinery contrast prettily with the white wood
 beneath.

 A simple table is the focal point of the altar.

 The chairs are in various shapes and sizes to accommodate rear-ends of
 various shapes and sizes.

>look


 You are standing in a magnificent ballroom decorated for a wedding. At
 one end stands the altar, consisting of an arbour, a table and a
 statue of Cupido. A few dozen chairs are arranged for optimal viewing.

>examine guitar


 You cannot see any such thing.

>go south



 You head to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose bushes. In the
 centre is a fountain, regurgitating water onto itself. The entrance to
 the foyer is to the south. Stairs descend below the wall to the west.

 A goblin engineer, seemingly unbothered by the rain, is busy repairing
 the dislocated leg of a suit of mechanical armour.

>go down



 You make your way down a looping stairway, entering a dimly-lit hall
 that extends to the east.

 Without warning, a harrowing sound echoes through the passage. You
 recall hearing worse only once before, when a fellow of your
 acquaintance contracted the dreaded banshee tapeworm (much to your
 relief, the problem of the noise was resolved once someone thought to
 apply a cork to the offending orifice).

>go east



 As you draw closer, you recognise the tortured caterwauling of a man.
 With each step, the wailing becomes more and more intense, and it
 takes every ounce of courage not to turn and flee. You can see a dead
 end a little farther to the east.

>go east



 You inch towards the end of the hall and discover the source of the
 noise. Locked in a cramped cell is a collection of heroes—five, to
 be
 exact. One of them is bent over a guitar.

 "<span class="floydstyle em">And after aaaaaaaalllllllll</span>," he cries. "<span class="floydstyle em">You're my</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">wonderwaaaaaaaaalllllllll!</span>"

 The hero ends his song with a flourish and a bow, and the others offer
 a rousing round of applause. "Bravo, bravo!" they cry. Hero 3 whistles
 appreciatively through his fingers. (It should be noted you have a
 hard time telling heroes apart, especially when they are all men and
 rather generic. Thus, you decide to number them in your head to
 prevent any issues with disambiguation. Only Hero 1 stands out by
 virtue of his guitar, but calling him Guitar Hero would simply be too
 generous a title.)

 "By the gods, a pig!" shouts Hero 5. He smacks his cellmates to gain
 their attention, and they all turn to consider you. "Could it be here
 to rescue the princess?" he continues.

 "What a silly notion. <span class="floydstyle em">I'm</span> here to rescue the princess," says
 Hero 4. Hero 2 gently but firmly corrects the other, stating that he,
 in fact, shall be rescuing the princess. This is followed by the same
 assertion from Hero 3. Hero 1 not only believes he shall be rescuing
 the princess, he has also written a song about it that he thinks
 everyone should hear right away.

 "What if we all rescue the princess together?" asks Hero 5, earning
 incredulous glares from the others.

 "If everyone is the hero, then nobody is," says Hero 4. The remaining
 heroes nod in unison. "So naturally," he continues, "I shall be the
 one to rescue the princess."

 Losing interest in the resulting argument, you take in the rest of
 your surroundings. Within the cell, a combination washer-dryer stands
 against the far wall. Outside the cell, you find an empty guard post
 and a ring of keys hanging on the wall.

>examine keys


 The ring of keys hangs on the wall, though not as high up as you would
 have placed them if you were in charge of hanging keys (and also not
 an ordinary pig).

>take keys


 You assumed they were low enough to reach, but even when standing on
 your hind legs, the ring of keys is too far away.

 The prisoners halt their argument to gape at your attempt. "Are you...
 are you trying to purloin the keys for us?" asks Hero 3. "Are you some
 sort of intelligent pig?"

 When you turn to look at them, Hero 1 has an idea. "If you can
 understand me, bring me something to throw at the keys. I shall knock
 them off the wall, and you can retrieve them for me. Then I shall be
 free to rescue the princess."

 "No, <span class="floydstyle em">I'm</span> rescuing the princess," counters Hero 2, and the
 argument resumes once more.

>examine post


 It's a table and chair, with the chair facing the cell. You assume
 this is where a guard would watch over a prisoner, so calling it a
 guard post felt more appropriate to conveying its purpose (though
 without a guard, it really is just a table and chair).

>examine washer


 A rare clockwork combination washer-dryer is beginning to succumb to
 rust. Chained to the machine is a skeleton.

>examine skeleton


 Such a gruesome death.

>open washer


 Being a pig, you are limited in what you can do.

>go west



 You return to the centre of the dimly-lit hall that runs east and
 west.

>go west



 You continue to the foot of the stairs to the west.

>go up



 You make your way up the stairs to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed
 by rose bushes with a fountain in the centre. To the north is the
 ballroom, and to the south is the foyer.

 A goblin engineer, seemingly unbothered by the rain, is busy repairing
 the dislocated leg of a suit of mechanical armour.

>go south



 You proceed to the foyer of the inner keep. To the west is a darkened
 hallway, to the east is a well-lit hallway and to the south are the
 closed double doors to the bailey. A circular staircase curves around
 a lift to the balcony above.

 A poster announcing the wedding of Tristain and Princess Joy directs
 guests to the north. Near the poster is a wooden crate.

>go south


 You squeeze through the doggy door and return to the northern end of
 the bailey, with the rest of the bailey to the south, southeast and
 southwest. Tuck is thrilled to see you again.

 The squire immediately throws his arms around you. "Oh! How happy I am
 to know you are safe, little sniffer." He blinks the mist from his
 eyes. "I thought—well, who knows what dwells inside this evil place,
 and I was worried that..." He trails off, unable to complete the
 sentence, and only after an exhausting amount of kicking and squealing
 does he let you go.

>go southwest



 Tuck follows you to the western end of the bailey. You can continue
 east towards the dogtower or southeast towards the drawbridge.

 A red pail lies on its side.

 You can also see a ball here.

>take ball


 Taken.

>go northeast



 Tuck follows you across the bailey, arriving at the double doors of
 the inner keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the south, with the
 rest of the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

>go north


 You squeeze through the doggy door into the foyer of the inner keep.
 To the north is an outdoor courtyard, to the west a darkened hallway
 and to the east a well-lit hallway. A circular staircase curves
 upwards around a clockwork lift.

>go north



 You head to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose bushes with a
 fountain in the centre. To the north is the ballroom. Stairs descend
 below the wall to the west.

 A goblin engineer, seemingly unbothered by the rain, is busy repairing
 the dislocated leg of a suit of mechanical armour.

>go down



 You descend the stairs down the looping stairs, entering a dimly-lit
 hall that extends to the east.

>go east



 You return to the centre of the dimly-lit hall that runs east and
 west.

>go east



 You proceed to the closed cell at the end of the hall. Inside, a
 collection of heroes are engaged in a heated argument. The nearby
 guard post is empty. On the wall hangs a ring of keys.

 "Oh, good boy," says Hero 3, cutting the argument short. "Now bring
 the ball here." He slaps his hands on his thighs like you resemble a
 dog. You poke your snout between the bars, and Hero 2 takes the ball
 from your mouth.

 "I have it! I have it!" he exclaims. "As leader of this group, I shall
 save us."

 But Hero 4 snatches the ball away. "Leader? You are the leader the day
 pigs fly. I shall do the honours." he says, prompting another argument
 over who should be the one to rescue the group and whether or not they
 even have a leader. The fight quickly turns physical, each trying to
 take the ball from the other, and after a brief struggle, the ball
 looses itself from their collective grips. It sails across the hall
 and knocks the keys onto the floor.

 The heroes consider their accomplishment. Finally, Hero 1 speaks. "Let
 that be a reminder of the power of teamwork," he says, and they all
 nod in agreement. "Now, pig," he continues, "might you bring us the
 keys?"

>take keys


 You pick up the ring of keys and bring it to the heroes, who fight
 over possession of them, and then fight over which key to try in the
 lock. As is usually the case when dealing with multiple keys, the last
 one tried is the right one. They burst out of the cell as soon as it
 opens.

 "Fear not princess, for I am coming!" shouts Hero 5, escaping down the
 hall.

 "Nay, princess, wait for your true hero!" follows Hero 3. Heroes 2 and
 4 chase after the other two.

 "I must warn the others to hide until the time is right," says Hero 1.
 "While <span class="floydstyle em">I</span> shall be the one to rescue the princess, I would not
 want them to perish in this place." He looks down at the ring of keys.
 "I also see no need for these in the near future for any specific
 reason." Tossing them over his shoulder, he hurries after the others.

>look


 You are at the end of a dimly-lit hall before an open cell containing
 a skeleton chained to a combination washer-dryer. The nearby guard
 post is empty.

 You can see a ring of keys and a ball here.

>take keys


 Taken.

>go west



 You return to the centre of the dimly-lit hall that runs east and
 west.

>go west



 You make your way to the foot of the stairs to the west.

>go up



 You crest the top of the stairs and emerge into the courtyard, where
 the goblin engineer is panicking.

 "Call the guard! The heroes have escaped!" she shouts, running back
 and forth before skidding to a halt. "Oh, chickenspit. Rhoda is the
 bloody guard."

 She pulls a flint-wheel lighter out of her workvest and, shielding the
 flame from the rain, ignites the pilot light of the armour's
 flamethrower. Then she hops in the back and works the controls.

 The contraption sputters and shakes as it struggles to right itself
 with one of its legs askew. Still, the goblin manages to coax the
 armour into an awkward limp, guiding it to the south.

>go south



 You continue to the foyer of the inner keep. To the west is a darkened
 hallway, to the east is a well-lit hallway and to the south are the
 closed double doors to the bailey. A circular staircase curves around
 a lift to the balcony above.

 The goblin engineer inspects the double doors from atop the armour.

 "Hmmm," she says, tugging on her ears. "The doors remain locked? The
 rotten heroes must be in the keep! Rhoda shall wait here and roast 'em
 on their escape." She pulls on the trigger of her flamethrower, and a
 ten-hands jet of flame bursts out of the barrel.

>go south


 You squeeze through the doggy door and return to the northern end of
 the bailey, with the rest of the bailey to the south, southeast and
 southwest. Tuck is thrilled to see you again.

>drop keys


 Dropped.

>sniff keys


 You sniff the ring of keys, and Tuck picks them up.

 "Are you saying these will open the doors?" He looks to the south.
 "No, I cannot go in without Ser Leonhart. We have to rescue him
 first!" He returns the keys to the ground.

>go north


 You squeeze through the doggy door into the foyer of the inner keep.
 To the north is an outdoor courtyard, to the west a darkened hallway
 and to the east a well-lit hallway. A circular staircase curves
 upwards around a clockwork lift.

 The goblin engineer keeps watch over the foyer from atop her
 mechanical suit of armour, her back facing the double doors.

>go north



 You make your way to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose bushes
 with a fountain in the centre. To the north is the ballroom. Stairs
 descend below the wall to the west.

>go down



 You descend the stairs down the looping stairs, entering a dimly-lit
 hall that extends to the east.

>go east



 You return to the centre of the dimly-lit hall that runs east and
 west.

>go east



 You head to the end of the hall. The nearby guard post is empty.

 You can see a ball here.

>take ball

>go west



 You return to the centre of the dimly-lit hall that runs east and

>go west



 You proceed to the foot of the stairs to the west.

>go up



 You climb the stairs to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose
 bushes with a fountain in the centre. To the north is the ballroom,
 and to the south is the foyer.

>go south



 You continue to the foyer of the inner keep. To the west is a darkened
 hallway, to the east is a well-lit hallway and to the south are the
 closed double doors to the bailey. A circular staircase curves around
 a lift to the balcony above.

 The goblin engineer keeps watch over the foyer from atop her
 mechanical suit of armour, her back facing the double doors.

>go south


 You squeeze through the doggy door and return to the northern end of
 the bailey, with the rest of the bailey to the south, southeast and
 southwest. Tuck is thrilled to see you again.

 You see a ring of keys here.

>drop ball


 Dropped.

>sniff ball


 You sniff the ball, and Tuck picks it up.

>se



 Tuck follows you to the eastern end of the bailey. You can continue
 west towards the dogtower or southwest towards the drawbridge.

>go west



 Tuck follows you to the dogtower, where Ser Leonhart is struggling to
 free himself from beneath the dragon.

 The dragon, seeing Tuck hurry by with the ball in hand, bolts upright,
 panting and wagging its tail.

 "W-w-what now, milord?" asks Tuck. He moves the ball left and right,
 and the dragon follows it with its eyes. It shifts its weight from
 claw to claw, and its tail buffets the ground.

 "The dragon has you in its sights!" shouts Ser Leonhart, filled with
 worry for his young charge. "Run, Tuck! Run I say! The beast is about
 to pounce!"

 The squire spins round in a panic, but one foot catches on the other,
 and he falls. The ball, escaping his grip, bounces away to the south.
 The dragon immediately gives chase.

 Beaming with pride, Ser Leonhart climbs to his feet and brushes
 himself off. "Excellent work, my resourceful rookie. You are always
 full of surprises." Tuck blushes as he too rises, though his brow
 remains furrowed; he is not quite sure what it is he actually did.

>go north



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you across the bailey, arriving at the
 double doors of the inner keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the
 south, with the rest of the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

 Startled by the sounds of clinking chain and heavy footfalls, you turn
 to see the dragon running towards you with the ball in its jaws. Ser
 Leonhart grips the hilt of his sword. "The beast is more ferocious
 than I expected," he says. "We are left with no other choice."

 "You shall defeat it in battle, milord?" asks Tuck.

 "Of course not," replies the knight. "I suggest a hasty retreat."

 Thus, the knight and his squire begin to run in tight circles as is
 their usual manner of escape. You would be more surprised if you had
 not already witnessed their methods working with an inexplicable
 degree of success against the creatures of the mountain (the ogre was
 prone to dizziness, the cyclops suffered from an inferior perception
 of depth and the medusa simply could not entice them to look at her).

 The dragon, dropping the ball, joins in the circle behind them for
 what must seem a very fun game to play. You manage to hop over its
 chain with each pass.

>sniff keys


 You sniff the ring of keys, but the knight and his squire are too busy
 running from the dragon to notice.

>go south



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck run after you to the dogtower, the dragon not
 far behind. From here, you can go back north, or continue south, east
 or west.

>go south



 You lead Ser Leonhart, Tuck and the dragon to the southern end of the
 bailey. You can go north to the dogtower or around it to the northeast
 or northwest.

>go northwest



 You lead Ser Leonhart, Tuck and the dragon to the west end of the
 bailey. As you circle the dogtower, the chain holding the dragon
 becomes a little shorter. You can go east to the dogtower or around it
 to the northeast or southeast.

 A red pail lies on its side.

>go northeast



 You lead Ser Leonhart, Tuck and the dragon to the double doors of the
 inner keep, and the chain becomes a little shorter. You can go south
 to the dogtower or around it to the southeast or southwest.

 You can see a ball and a ring of keys here.

>take ball


 Taken.

 You lead Ser Leonhart, Tuck and the dragon to the east end of the
 bailey, and the chain becomes a little shorter. You can go west to the
 dogtower or around it to the northwest or southwest.

>go southwest



 You lead Ser Leonhart, Tuck and the dragon to the southern end of the
 bailey, and the chain becomes a little shorter. Once more around
 should finish the job. You can go north to the dogtower or around it
 to the northeast or northwest.

>go northwest



 You lead Ser Leonhart, Tuck and the dragon to the west end of the
 bailey, and the chain becomes a little shorter. You can go east to the

>se



 You lead Ser Leonhart, Tuck and the dragon to the east end of the
 bailey, and the chain becomes a little shorter. You can go west to the
 dogtower or around it to the northwest or southwest.

>go southwest



 You lead your entourage to the southern end of the bailey. At long
 last the chain has shortened enough to prevent the dragon from chasing
 our heroes. The knight and his squire take the opportunity to admire
 their accomplishment.

 "I cannot believe (wheeze) we stopped the dragon (wheeze) with its own
 chain," says Tuck while trying to catch his breath.

 "Not even dragons (wheeze) can escape the tangled (wheeze) irons of
 justice," replies Ser Leonhart, also gasping for air but putting a
 valiant effort into not showing it.

>go northwest



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the western end of the bailey. You
 can continue east towards the dogtower or northeast towards the inner
 keep's entrance.

 A red pail lies on its side.

>drop ball


 Dropped.

>take pail


 It's too big and unwieldy for you to carry.

>sniff pail


 You sniff the pail.

 Ser Leonhart points his sword at the thing. "Not one of your better
 disguises, wizard," he says. "I shall cut you down where you, uh, lie
 already." He strikes the pail, sending it tumbling over itself several
 paces away.

 Tuck chases it down and turns it over in his hands. "This... does not
 seem a dead wizard, milord," he says.

 The knight rubs his chin. "I should have guessed from the label," he
 replies. "It is a chamber pot."

 Recoiling in both disgust and horror, Tuck throws the pail to the
 ground and wipes his hands on his doublet.

>go northeast



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you across the bailey, arriving at the
 double doors of the inner keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the
 south, with the rest of the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

 You can see a ring of keys here.

 The heroes linger before the keep's imposing façade. Tuck cranes his
 neck nearly to the point of falling over.

 "Golly! The keep is impossibly large," he says. "How ever shall we
 find the princess?"

 "Kidnapped princesses are always remanded to the highest tower. It is
 how these things are done," replies the knight.

 "But, milord," says Tuck as a new thought crosses his mind. "When I
 meet her, what should I say? Surely you have met Her Highness before."

 Ser Leonhart's eyes take on a hazy quality. "Nay, I have not the
 privilege. Very few have lain eyes upon our beautiful and virtuous
 Princess Joy. The king has wisely kept her under lock and key since
 birth, safe within the walls of the Royal Palace. That the evil wizard
 violated her sanctuary by transforming into a dragon and carrying her
 away from her tower reveals the true depths of his depravity." He
 shakes a fist. "But, upon meeting her, all you must do is lower
 yourself to one knee and then stay there. Failing everything else, try
 to appear as inconsequential as possible." He returns his attention to
 the keep.

 Tuck practices appearing inconsequential, and as it turns out, he is a
 natural.

>smell keys


 You sniff the ring of keys, and Tuck hands the bunch to Ser Leonhart.

 "Might these let us through the doors?" he asks.

 "Such a clever lad, you are," responds the knight. He tries the keys
 in the lock, finding the right one when it turns. You hear the groan
 of a lifting latch. "Be ready, my faithful follower, for we know not
 what evils await us inside." Tuck darts behind Ser Leonhart as he ties
 the keys onto his belt and flings the doors open.

 The goblin engineer, on the lookout for the five escaped heroes, was
 not expecting any more heroes to arrive, and certainly not through the
 locked double doors. She spins the armour round to face her new foes,
 but the disjointed leg cannot support her swift manoeuvre, and she
 stumbles backwards, inadvertently pulling the trigger of her
 flamethrower and loosing an arrow of fire onto the staircase. The
 flames spread across the carpet.

 "Look what the stinky humes made Rhoda do!" she shrieks, unleashing a
 blast at Ser Leonhart. The knight ducks behind his shield.

 "Tuck, keep away!" he shouts. "My shield can withstand the creature's
 fire!" He circles the armour, shield raised.

 You lead Tuck into the foyer but maintain a healthy distance from the
 ensuing battle.

>go south



 Tuck follows you out onto the bailey. The dogtower stands before you
 to the south, with the rest of the bailey to the southeast and
 southwest.

>go southwest



 Tuck follows you to the western end of the bailey. You can continue
 east towards the dogtower or southeast towards the drawbridge.

 A red pail lies on its side.

 You can also see a ball here.

>take pail


 It's too big and unwieldy for you to carry.

>smell pail


 You sniff the pail, but Tuck hesitates. Annoyed, you sniff it again,
 and then again, until he comes over and picks it up with the tips of
 his fingers.

 "The chamber pot? Is this supposed to help?" He looks back towards the
 keep, full of worry for his master.

>go northeast



 Tuck follows you across the bailey, arriving at the open double doors
 of the inner keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the south, with
 the rest of the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

>go north



 Tuck follows you to the foyer of the inner keep. To the north is a
 courtyard, to the west is a darkened hallway and to the east is a
 well-lit hallway. A circular staircase curves around a lift to the
 balcony above.

 The goblin engineer is locked in battle with Ser Leonhart, though the
 knight can only maintain a defensive position while the armour is
 spewing flame.

>go north



 Tuck follows you to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose bushes
 with a fountain in the centre. To the north is the ballroom. Stairs
 descend below the wall to the west.

>smell fountain


 You sniff the fountain and then the pail. It takes a moment for the
 idea to settle in.

 "Oh, water!" Tuck exclaims. He scoops up the water, filling the pail
 to the top.

>go south


 At first, Tuck refuses to step into the foyer. He watches with eyes
 wide as saucers as the fierce battle rages on between Ser Leonhart and
 the goblin astride the mechanical menace. The armour hurls many lances
 of flame at the knight, who remains unscathed only by the grace of his
 shield.

 A look of determination spreads across the young squire's face. "Here
 I am, milord!" he cries. "I shall assist you!" Summoning all the
 courage he can muster, he inhales deeply, lifts the pail of water high
 above his head and charges forward, managing at least a solid three
 steps, possibly four, before tripping over his own feet and flinging
 water everywhere.

 The pail bounces once, twice, then rolls to a stop directly underneath
 the armour's approaching foot. The machine topples goblin-over-heels
 and crashes to the floor.

 Out of its flamethrower erupts a wild stream of fire. It sprays
 upwards across the fleuret-patterned wallpaper and the elegantly
 draped white fabric, arcs back down along the bouquets of baby's
 breath and blasts the welcome poster off of its stand, only narrowly
 missing the wooden crate. Clearly no measure of fire retardants were
 applied to the wedding decorations, for the fire spreads quickly up
 the walls, seeming to catch on everything.

 After a moment of quiet contemplation, the goblin engineer extricates
 herself from the fallen armour and brushes herself off. "And Rhoda is
 done," she says. "Have fun storming the castle!" Then she sprints
 through the double doors and disappears into the strengthening
 downpour outside.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Ser Leonhart immediately sets upon himself the task of putting out the
 fire, which involves stomping about in his armoured greaves. "Hurry,
 Tuck, we must halt the flames, lest the princess burn to death within
 her prison!"

 Tuck investigates the possibility of using the fallen armour,
 comparing its oversized metal boots to his own for stomping out
 flames. Unfortunately, he seems unable to decipher the controls, and
 he soon becomes too distraught for independent action. He looks at
 you.

>smell pot


 You cannot see any such thing.

>smell pail


 You sniff the pail, and Tuck picks it up.

>go north



 You return to the courtyard with Tuck not far behind. Lightning
 flashes, and thunder rolls across the heavens. The rain comes down in
 thick sheets, leaving a thumb or two of standing water that
 accumulates faster than it drains.

 The foyer is back to the south, billowing smoke out around you. A
 colonnade borders the ballroom to the north, and stairs descend
 beneath the wall to the west, water cascading down them. In the centre
 stands the fountain.

>smell fountain


 You sniff the fountain and then the pail. Tuck scoops up the water,
 filling the pail to the top.

>go south



 Tuck follows you to the foyer of the inner keep, which happens to be
 on fire. The drum of the downpour striking the skylight high above
 competes with the roar of the surrounding flames. A suit of mechanical
 armour lies abandoned near a wooden crate. Ser Leonhart runs back and
 forth, attempting to stomp out the flames with his boots.

>smell pail


 You sniff the pail, and Tuck flings the water at the nearest patch of
 flame before dropping the empty pail. There is a spurt of steam, and
 not much else.

 At this rate, it would take years to stop the fire's spread. There has
 to be a better way.

>examine armour


 You have a much better view of the armour now that the goblin engineer
 no longer lingers to shoo you away. Even so, you know not how it
 works. You can, however, identify the control panel and the
 flamethrower—its trigger within reach and its barrel pointed at the
 floor. Its pilot light is lit.

>examine panel


 The panel of cranks and levers is how one controls the armour,
 somehow.

>smell panel


 You sniff the controls.

 Tuck knows not where to begin. He turns cranks and pulls levers, and
 the suit bucks and whirs. Now the flamethrower is pointed directly at
 the wooden crate.

>smell panel


 You sniff the controls. Tuck pulls a lever, and the flamethrower
 points at the ceiling.

>smell panel

 works. You can, however, identify the control panel and the
 flamethrower—its trigger within reach and its barrel pointed at the
 ceiling. Its pilot light is lit.

>smell trigger


 You sniff the trigger, which Tuck pulls. An arrow of flame shoots many
 hands into the air.

 Startled by yet another burst from the armour, Ser Leonhart throws up
 his shield before noticing his squire at the controls. "The goal is
 less fire, not more!" he cries.

>light


 (the fleas)
 Being a pig, you are limited in what you can do.

>examine light


 The pilot light is lit.

>smell panel


 You sniff the controls. Tuck pulls a lever, and the flamethrower
 points at the floor.

>again


 You sniff the controls. Tuck pulls a lever, and the flamethrower
 points directly at the wooden crate.

>smell trigger


 You sniff the trigger, which Tuck pulls. An arrow of flame finds it
 mark upon the crate full of fireworks. Grabbing Tuck's hose with your
 teeth, you pull him to the corner of the room, and not a moment too
 soon.

 The foyer vanishes behind an explosion of light, colour and sound.
 Blues swirl and greens pop. Yellows sizzle and purples streak this way
 and that. A phoenix of red light spreads its wings and screams
 upwards, bursting through the skylight and raining glass down around
 you (along with the actual rain).

 Slowly but surely, rain triumphs over fire, and as the downpour
 returns to a light drizzle, you are left standing on charred carpet
 and slick stone. There is little spared by the flames.

 "That was too close," says Tuck, shivering in the wet.

 Ser Leonhart brushes bits of glass off his armour. "It was fortunate
 the wizard's plan failed," he says.

 "How do you mean, milord?"

 "He attempted to slay us with daggers of glass, but he instead put out
 the fire with the rain," replies the knight. "It is a mercy that even
 the most clever of men can make mistakes."

 A loud crash interrupts the conversation, and the lowest section of
 the staircase, having lost its structural integrity, collapses into a
 pile of rubble.

>go west


 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you into the darkness. There is quite a
 bit of bumping into things, not to mention each other, and after
 several minutes of trying to go somewhere useful, you give up and head
 back into the light of the foyer.

>go east



 You guide the knight and his squire down the long hallway towards the
 closed door to the east, passing by the row of portraits. Tuck winces
 under their biting glares. "Who are all these people?" he asks.

 "Victims of the wizard, from the looks of it. It takes a special kind
 of evil to steal portraits and then display them so blatantly in one's
 own residence."

 "Oh," says Tuck. "I thought they might be the wizard's family."

 Ser Leonhart nods. "There is a similar hall for portraits in my
 family's manor. Have I mentioned I come from a long line of heroes in
 service to the crown?"

 "Once or twice." says Tuck. He pauses. "Milord, if I may ask, have you
 always wanted to be a hero?"

 The knight blinks in confusion. "Of course! Why would I not?"

 But Tuck offers no reply.

>smell door


 You sniff the door, and Ser Leonhart pulls it open.

>go east


 You lead the duo into a stately receiving room. Or rather, you walk in
 by yourself, for the knight and his squire have turned around and run
 the other way.

 The reason for their fearful flight soon becomes clear. On the floor
 beside a fireplace sits an unnameable horror, sobbing dramatically.
 She is dressed in a housemaid's uniform and, for some reason, wears
 countless colourful ribbons all over her head-tentacles (an abundance
 of ribbons is a couple of generations out of fashion, even for
 housemaids). Most of her eyes acknowledge your presence before
 returning to the business of sobbing.

 There are rooms to the east and south, as well as a narrow service
 corridor to the north.

>examine horror


 You have heard tales of unnameable horrors, and unlike your
 companions, you possess the constitution to look upon one. Or, perhaps
 their maddening appearance has no effect on ordinary pigs. In any
 event, you never suspected they wore so many ribbons.

>examine ribbons


 There are so many of them.

>count ribbons


 Your command was not recognised.

>examine fireplace


 A lit fireplace is always comforting, even in keeps belonging to evil
 wizards.

>go south



 You head to a long dining room, where the table runs from one end of
 the room to the other. There are two chairs, one at each end. Any
 attempt at mealtime conversation must involve extensive shouting.
 Another room lies to the east.

>examine table


 It's exceptionally long.

>go east



 You make your way into the smoking room, where light filters in
 through frosted windows. Mahogany furniture matches the wainscoting on
 the walls and ceiling. There is another room to the north.

>examine windows


 They let in a suggestion of light.

>examine furniture


 All the furnishings are composed of mahogany.

>examine wainscoting

>go north



 You head to an elegant parlour. Blue and gold floral-printed
 upholstery matches the paper on the walls. Beside a chaise lounge is
 the worst attempt at a standing lamp you have ever seen. The receiving
 room lies to the west.

>examine lamp


 Hero 2 is doing his best to impersonate a lamp, standing upright with
 a lampshade over his head. Every once in a while he scratches an itch
 or leans to one side before realising his error and standing rigid
 once more.

>smell hero


 You sniff around Hero 2's feet. He nudges you away surreptitiously
 with a foot.

>examine lounge


 The chaise lounge looks remarkably comfortable. A shame you cannot
 climb on top of it.

>go west



 You make your way to the receiving room. There is a narrow service
 corridor to the north, a well-lit hallway to the west and a dining
 room to the south. An unnameable horror is crying on the floor beside
 a roaring fireplace.

>go north



 You enter a narrow service corridor continuing north. A set of
 servants' stairs twists around a wall and disappears above you.

>go north


 There is room enough for at least a dozen chefs in the dusty kitchen,
 but as you pass through the open doorway, you instead find a single
 occupant—a clown. And while you cannot say you have encountered many
 clowns up close, and certainly none this small of stature, you
 nevertheless recognise the warning signs: a head of poofy
 multicoloured hair, a painted smile, a shabby patchwork coat and a
 pair of oversized red shoes (which produces a delightfully silly
 <span class="floydstyle em">honk</span> with each step). He stands before a cauldron bubbling
 over an open flame, reading from a book and tossing ingredients into
 the concoction.

 Only when he turns to grab a jar of owlet wings does he discover your
 attempt to sneak by. His beady eyes narrow at you.

 "Piggy?" he asks. "How was the piggy freed? Not on Robbit's watch! His
 Lordship is angry enough." He searches the table of ingredients for
 something, growing more and more frustrated as the object of his
 search fails to appear. "Robbit swears there were piggy treats here!"

 Exasperated, he pushes up his ruffled sleeves and chases you around
 the room. Once he manages to grab ahold of you, he lifts you off the
 floor, carries you out a side door and deposits you into a small,
 fenced-in area. Then he closes the gate and marches away, his clown
 shoes honking loudly as he goes.

>;


 Your command was not recognised.

>look


 You find yourself surrounded by a chain link fence save for a gate to
 the north. The ground is muddy, and the air reeks of manure.

 Of course. A pigpen.

 On its own this would be a terrible predicament, but as you scan your
 surroundings, you discover you have a penmate. Another pig sits in the
 corner, tucked far enough away that you almost missed him. He scowls
 at you like you defecated all over his personal space.

 Which, now that you think about it, is increasingly likely to happen
 should you find no escape.

>examine pig


 Aside from certain anatomical differences, he looks nearly identical
 to you.

>examine gate


 A simple peg on a string inserted into a slot keeps the gate shut. The
 peg is easily accessible from both sides of the gate.

>take peg


 It takes several tries with your teeth, but you manage to pull on the
 string until the peg pops free of the slot. The gate swings open.

>smell pig


 You attempt to sniff the pig, and he decides this is the perfect
 opportunity to put as much distance between the two of you as
 possible. He scurries through the gate to the north.

>go north



 Beyond the fence lies the stableyard. An old barn stands empty to the
 north. An open doorway to the west leads back into the inner keep.

>go north



 You proceed into a large but empty barn. Near the back, an old ladder
 leads to a loft. You can hear creaky footsteps above you.

>examine ladder


 The ladder has seen better days.

>go south



 You make your way to the stableyard. To the south is the pen. To the
 west is an open doorway leading inside the inner keep.

>go west


 You find the clown pursuing the other pig about the kitchen. He
 manages to snatch the beast by his tail and lift him off the floor.

 "Caught piggy now!" he shouts in triumph, and at that moment, he
 notices you. "Two piggies?" he asks aloud. "Two too many piggies
 running higgeldy-piggeldy."

 The other pig, seeing a means of escape, bites down hard on the
 clown's free hand. The clown recoils and drops the pig, who rushes
 away to the south.

 The clown gives chase, shouting invectives and honking as he goes.

>look


 The kitchen is as large as it is dusty, and it's quite large. Passages
 lead outside to the east and into a narrow corridor to the south. A
 single cauldron bubbles over an open flame, filling the room with a
 vile odour. Jars of assorted ingredients are gathered atop a nearby
 table, alongside an open book that rests halfway off the table's edge.

>examine book


 You presume it's some sort of poisoner's cookbook, considering the
 smell of whatever is boiling in the cauldron. It hangs slightly off
 the edge of the table.

>take book

 Many jars of ingredients sit atop it. A book teeters on the edge.

>take table


 It is hardly portable.

>hit table


 Being a pig, you are limited in what you can do.

>go south



 You enter a narrow service corridor continuing south. A set of
 servants' stairs twists around a wall and disappears above you.

 From the south comes the clown's voice. "Petunia! Seen any piggies? A
 pink piggy, this high, waddles about?"

 The only response from the horror is more sobbing.

 "Cry not, Petunia, Robbit is sorry. Look at poor Robbit! All Robbit
 wanted was a sippy of His Lordship's tasty blueberry juice, and now
 Robbit is stuck with the honky-honky shoes!" You hear several more
 honks like he is walking in a circle, showing them off.

 The sobbing turns into a wail.

 "Sorry, sorry! Robbit can find the piggy then pluck the ingredients
 from the stinky heroes then finish His Lordship's counter potion then
 fix Petunia right up!"

 You wait until you hear the clown leaving the receiving room for one
 further away.

>go up



 You ascend the stairs to the first storey landing. The stairs continue
 up to the storey above. To the west is a closed door.

>examine door


 A solid wooden door. The doors of the keep used to contain puzzles to
 solve in order to open them. It appears they have all been removed.

>go up



 You climb the stairs to the second storey landing. From here, you can
 continue up to the storey above. A closed door stands to the west.

>go up



 You reach the top of the servants' stairs. To the west is a closed
 door.

>go down



 You make your way down the stairs to the second storey landing, the
 stairway continuing down to the storey below. A closed door stands to
 the west.

>go down



 You descend the stairs to the first storey landing, the stairway
 continuing down to the ground floor below. To the west is a closed
 door.

>go down



 You descend the stairs and enter a narrow service corridor running
 north and south.

 You relax as you hear the clown's honking shoes taking him away from
 the room to the south.

>go south



 You proceed to the receiving room. There are rooms to the east and
 south, as well as a well-lit hallway through the open door to the
 west. An unnameable horror is crying on the floor beside a roaring
 fireplace.

 You hear the clown searching for you in the room to the east.

>go west


 You return to the well-lit hallway with enough time to watch Ser
 Leonhart and Tuck follow the other pig into the foyer to the west.

>go west


 You arrive to find Ser Leonhart and Tuck chasing the pig around in
 circles. The pig wants naught to do with the overly eager humans in
 tow. He dashes off into the darkened hallway to the west in an effort
 to lose them, but Ser Leonhart charges in after him.

 Tuck hesitates long enough to catch a glimpse of you waddling into the
 foyer. He scratches his head, first looking down the darkened hallway,
 then back to you, then down the darkened hallway again before
 shrugging and resuming his place behind you.

>examine lift


 The lift is closed.

>smell lift


 You sniff the lift, and after Tuck opens the door, you lead him
 inside.

 The space is only large enough for about three people, but for an
 ordinary pig like yourself, there is plenty of room. Next to the door
 on the southern wall is a horizontal row of buttons, labelled '3',
 '2', '1' and 'G' from left to right. The button labelled 'G' is
 already depressed.

>smell 1


 You stand on your hind legs and sniff as high as you can reach, just
 below the button labelled '1'. Tuck presses it.

 The lift stutters to life and slowly ascends before coming to a stop.
 You emerge onto the first storey balcony. On this level, you can go
 east to a hallway.

>go east



 Tuck follows you down the first storey hallway. There is an open
 doorway to the north and a closed door to the east.

>go north



 The expansive library is a welcoming sight, its ceiling high enough to
 accommodate the shelves upon shelves of ancient books and tomes. If
 only during your captivity you were kept here, you could have hurried
 the afternoons along reading some forgotten tales, or epic poetry, or
 as a last resort, something religious.

 On the southern wall beside the sole entrance hangs a great tapestry.
 The large window on the opposite wall lets in ample light, and on a
 sunny day paired with a warm breeze, the room might have even
 convinced you to remember the keep in a kinder light.

>examine tapestry


 The large tapestry depicts a demon standing on a rocky shoreline in
 the midst of a storm. In one hand he holds a bell; the other is
 outstretched, feeding a murder of crows that hovers around him.

>examine books


 The shelves are full of the usual suspects: histories, atlases,
 scientific theses, scriptures, erotic poetry and, of course, studies
 in dark magick. You notice the magickal tomes in particular have
 titles like <span class="floydstyle em">Hexes and the Art of Broomstick Repair</span> and
 <span class="floydstyle em">The Joy of Brewing</span>, and you wonder if the keep also has a
 witch in residence.

>examine joy


 You cannot see any such thing.

>examine window


 The window is closed. Given you are not very tall, you have no angle
 to see much more than the clouds.

>smell tapestry


 You sniff the tapestry. Tuck considers the subject but finds no deeper
 meaning beyond a bunch of pretty pictures.

>look


 The expansive library stretches out around you, lit by a large window.
 On the southern wall beside the sole entrance hangs a great tapestry.
 The remaining walls are lined with shelves upon shelves of books. A
 bare reading table occupies the centre of the room. Tuck waits nearby.

>examine table


 The table is bare.

>smell books


 You sniff a bookshelf. Tuck, intimidated by the sheer number of books,
 says rooted in place.

>go south



 You return to the first storey hallway, which runs from the balcony to
 the west to a closed door to the east. Tuck remains close behind.

>smell door


 You sniff the door, and Tuck opens it, revealing a narrow servants'
 staircase.

>go east



 Tuck follows you to the first storey landing. From here, you can take
 the servants' stairs to the storey above or the ground floor below.

>go down


 The smell of burnt flesh and rotten eggs wafts into the narrow
 corridor as you lead Tuck down the stairs. The clown comes running in
 from the south.

 "The potion! Robbit cannot burn the potion!" He races by you to the
 north.

>go north


 Tuck manages hardly a few steps into the kitchen when the clown turns
 around.

 "Who is this one?" he asks, but before Tuck can stutter a reply, the
 clown thrusts a large spoon into the squire's hand and pulls him over
 to the cauldron. "It matters not. Friend stirs now," he commands. "The
 sooner Robbit finishes the potion, the sooner Robbit is no longer a
 honky-honky clown, and friend no longer a stinky hume."

 The terrified squire begins to slowly stir the cauldron, earning a
 smack on the back of the hand from the clown. "Stir faster, and stop
 not, or His Lordship will sentence friend to death from laundry duty."
 Tuck stirs with all the strength he can rally.

 "Now for the piggy." The clown picks you up and returns you to the
 pen, mumbling something about the poor quality of piggy fences. After
 closing the gate behind you, he honks back into the kitchen.

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Service Corridor</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go south


 The horror is still in the receiving room, and you'd rather not
 separate from Tuck at this particular juncture.

>go up



 Tuck follows you to the first storey landing. From here, you can
 continue up to the storey above or go west to the hallway.

>go up



 Tuck follows you to the second storey landing. The stairs continue up
 to the storey above. There is a closed door to the west.

>smell door


 You sniff the door, and Tuck opens it, revealing a hallway.

>go west



 Tuck follows you down the hallway. There is a closed door to the north
 and a balcony to the west. A memorandum has been nailed to the
 northern door.

>examine memo


 The memo was written in haste, complete with angry smears of ink. It
 reads:

 Attn: staff
 For switching the labels on all of my potions, thus enabling the
 Princess Joy's escape, as well as dumping the remaining store of
 counter potion down the drain, my son is grounded and must remain in
 his room. Do NOT let him out under pain of death by laundry duty. I
 can assure you there are PLENTY of socks that require matching.
 Anyone not affected by a potion must search the mountain for the
 princess and bring her back here. In the meantime, Robbit will brew a
 counter potion to fix the rest of us. I would do it myself, but now I
 have to brew a new batch of love potion so we can finally have a
 wedding.
 Signed,
 ~*Lord Queklain*~

 P.S. To whomever keeps smuggling in wigs and dresses, I will find you
 and you will suffer the worst kind of laundry duty and also death.

>smell door


 Which do you mean, the eastern door or the northern door?

>northern


 You sniff the door. Tuck tries to open it but finds it locked.

 "I believe Ser Leonhart has the keys," he says.

>go west



 Tuck follows you to the second storey balcony. Another hallway leads
 to the west. A circular staircase reaches the balconies above and
 below. A call button can summon the lift.

>go west



 Tuck follows you down the western hallway. There is a bedroom to the
 west and a closed door to the north.

>go west


 You attempt to lead Tuck into the bedroom, but an old woman frightens
 him away. "Too soon! Too soon for heroes!" she cries. "My greatest
 work is not yet complete!" She chases Tuck about with a tin of pig
 treats until he flees back into the hallway. You remain close behind.

>examine woman


 You cannot see any such thing.

>examine bedroom


 You cannot see any such thing.

>smell door


 Which do you mean, the western door or the northern door?

>northern


 You sniff the door, and Tuck opens it, revealing a bedroom.

>go north



 Tuck follows you north to a majestic bedroom. Against the far wall is
 a mahogany bed, a totem of devilish creatures carved into each of the
 posts. In another corner is a desk covered in papers. One such paper
 has fallen to the floor.

>examine paper

>examine bed


 It is large and luxurious, if somewhat creepy.

>smell bed


 You sniff the bed. Tuck bites his lip.

 You are in a majestic bedroom, the exit to the south. Against the far
 wall is a mahogany bed, a totem of devilish creatures carved into each
 of the posts. In another corner is a desk covered in papers. One such
 paper has fallen to the floor. Tuck waits nearby.

>examine desk


 There are a great deal of papers on top of it.

>go south



 Tuck follows you to the western hallway. There is a balcony to the
 east and bedroom to the west.

>go east



 Tuck follows you to the second storey balcony. Another hallway leads
 to the east. A circular staircase reaches the balconies above and
 below. A call button can summon the lift.

>go up



 Tuck follows you to the highest balcony, with a hallway to the east
 and a spiral staircase up to the tower to the west. A call button can
 summon the lift.

>go west



 Tuck follows you to the top of the spiral staircase. To the north is a
 closed door. You can hear sparks and zaps and other magickal noises
 coming from inside.

>examine door


 A solid wooden door. The doors of the keep used to contain puzzles to
 solve in order to open them. It appears they have all been removed.

>go down



 You lead Tuck away from the cramped stone stairway and return to the
 third storey balcony. A hallway extends to the east, while the main
 staircase descends to the balcony below. A call button can summon the
 lift.

>go east



 Tuck follows you down the third storey hallway. There is a stone
 gargoyle carved into the wall to the north and a closed door to the
 east.

>examine gargoyle


 Its countenance was carved into the most hideous of glowers. You are
 reminded of the woman who tended to you when you were young. In one of
 its hands hangs a tasselled cord.

>examine cord


 It hangs from one of the gargoyle's hands.

>smell cord


 The tasselled cord is too far away.

>smell door


 You sniff the door, and Tuck opens it, revealing a narrow servants'
 staircase.

>go west



 You lead Tuck to the third storey balcony. Ahead of you rises a spiral
 staircase to the keep's highest tower. The main staircase descends to
 the balcony below. A call button can summon the lift.

>go down



 Tuck follows you to the second storey balcony, where hallways extend
 to the east and west. The circular staircase continues to the balcony
 below. A call button can summon the lift.

>go down



 Tuck follows you to the first storey balcony, which curves along the
 far wall and turns down a hallway to the east. The lift stands ready
 to take you to another storey.

>go west


 You cannot go that way. Available exits are east and up.

>smell lift


 You sniff the lift, and after Tuck opens the door, you lead him
 inside. Next to the door on the southern wall is a horizontal row of
 buttons, labelled '3', '2', '1' and 'G' from left to right. The button
 labelled '1' is already depressed.

>smell g


 You stand on your hind legs and sniff as high as you can reach, just
 below the rightmost button. Tuck presses it. The lift stutters to
 life, slowly descending all the way to the ground.

 You emerge into the foyer. You can go north to the courtyard, south
 through the double doors to the bailey, east to the well-lit hallway
 or west to the darkened hallway.

>go west


 Tuck follows you into the darkness. There is quite a bit of bumping
 into things and people, eliciting the occasional squeal from the other
 pig, and after emerging back into the light of the foyer, you discover
 Ser Leonhart is now standing behind you.

>smell lift


 You sniff the lift. Ser Leonhart throws open the door, only to find it
 empty. He holds you back before you can enter. "The wizard must have
 been in there recently, but he is not in there now," he says.

>go north



 Ser Leonhart follows you to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose
 bushes with a fountain in the centre. To the north is the ballroom.
 Stairs descend below the wall to the west.

>go down


 It's much too flooded to go down there.

>go north



 Ser Leonhart follows you into a magnificent ballroom decorated for a
 wedding. At one end stands the altar, consisting of an arbour, a table
 and a statue of Cupido looking particularly anxious. A few dozen
 chairs are arranged for optimal viewing.

>smell cupido


 You sniff around Hero 1's feet, and Ser Leonhart nods with solemn
 reverence.

 "Aye, I believe a prayer to the divine may help us in our quest." He
 sinks to his knees before the hero and says a quick prayer. Meanwhile,
 Hero 1 scrunches and unscrunches his nose in an attempt to scratch an
 itch without moving his arms.

 Once finished, Ser Leonhart rises and bids you to continue the search
 for the wizard.

>examine statue


 Hero 1 has taken the position of the statue of Cupido, having
 shattered the real statue into hundreds of pieces spread out across
 the floor. He painted himself white with what might be flour and milk,
 lending him a slightly sour odour. His guitar completes the look.

>bite cupido


 Your command was not recognised.

>go south



 Ser Leonhart follows you to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose
 bushes with a fountain in the centre. To the south is the foyer.
 Stairs descend below the wall to the west.

>examine fountain


 The fountain is a large pool of water encased by stone. The statue in
 its centre depicts a cockatrice hen feeding her chicks in the manner
 of most birds, the act represented by the water pouring out of her
 mouth. At the hen's feet are the remains of a human, ravaged, with
 their ribs exposed through torn meat.

>remains

>go south



 Ser Leonhart follows you to what remains of the foyer of the inner
 keep. To the west is a darkened hallway, to the east is a well-lit
 hallway and to the south are the open double doors to the bailey.
 Without a functioning staircase, only a lift remains to provide access
 to the balconies above.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart follows you down a long hallway lined with portraits.
 Ahead to the east is the receiving room.

>examine portraits


 The row of portraits features men and women radiating wealth and
 nobility. Each possesses the same upturned noses and downturned
 frowns. They scowl at you disdainfully from their perches with rich,
 violet eyes.

 Beneath each portrait is a gold plate engraved with a single name.
 From left to right, they read: Adelstain, Morgaine, Rogaine, Gawain,
 Romaine, Elaine, Queklain. The end of the row, bearing the name
 Tristain, is an empty frame.

>examine tristain


 It's an empty frame.

>smell tristain


 The portrait of Tristain is too far away.

>examine adelstain


 In the oldest painting, Adelstain poses amidst his inventions.
 Children in history class learn about the great puzzlemaster
 Adelstain, who held patents on everything from the basic crossword
 puzzle to the puzzle cube to the use of several alternate number
 systems including binary and hexadecimal. That is, until the patents
 were opened up to the public domain after a lengthy court battle
 several decades later (a riveting tale, for another day). He wears the
 finest clothes and has diamond rings on nearly every finger.

>examine morgaine


 After it was discovered that gold could be ground into a fine powder,
 many women decided to show their wealth by lining their eyes and lips
 with the stuff. Morgaine was very rich indeed. Her collection of
 jewellery is extensive.

>examine rogaine


 Rogaine was completely bald. There might be other interesting things
 happening in the portrait, but you find yourself too distracted by how
 well the artist captured the shininess of the man's head, to the point
 where you can make out a reflection of the artist himself, hard at
 work.

>examine romaine


 Poor Romaine must have been disliked by his family. Was there not one
 kind soul to dissuade him from wearing an outfit so offensively green?
 The portrait itself is only half the size of its predecessors, as if
 paying the artist had become a consideration.

>go east


 You pass through the open door into the next room without Ser
 Leonhart, the sight of the unnameable horror too much for him to bear.
 He panics for the briefest of moments before his feet assume
 responsibility for his mental well-being, taking him back the way he
 came.

 The receiving room is as you have left it, including the horror still
 sobbing by the fire.

>go west


 Ser Leonhart is busy recovering from his trauma when you arrive. He
 soon returns to your side.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart follows you to what remains of the foyer of the inner
 keep. To the north is a courtyard, to the west is a darkened hallway
 and to the south are the open double doors to the bailey. Without a
 functioning staircase, only a lift remains to provide access to the
 balconies above.

>go west


 Ser Leonhart follows you into the darkness. There is quite a bit of
 bumping into things and people, eliciting the occasional squeal from
 the other pig, and after emerging back into the light of the foyer,
 you discover Hero 3 is now standing behind you.

 "Hmmm," he says, taking in the newly-damaged foyer. "The princess must
 be locked in the highest tower, and it seems I have missed my chance
 for the stairs." Glancing out the double doors, he spots the dragon in
 the distance and shouts with glee. "I shall tame the dragon and ride
 it up to the princess!" As he runs through the doors, he turns and
 pulls them shut behind him, as if to bar you from meddling.

>go south


 You squeeze through the doggy door and onto the northern end of the
 bailey, with the rest of the bailey to the south, southeast and
 southwest.

>go south



 You return to the dogtower to find that not only has Hero 3 managed to
 stay alive, but he has somehow climbed onto the dragon's back and is
 attempting to free the chain from around its neck.

 The dragon, not entirely pleased with the situation, is trying to
 scratch the hero off his back with a hind leg like a dog would an
 irritating flea. You can empathise.

>go north



 You head across the bailey, arriving at the double doors of the inner
 keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the south, with the rest of
 the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

>go north


 You squeeze through the doggy door and return to what's left of the
 foyer. To the north is a courtyard, to the west a darkened hallway and
 to the east a well-lit hallway. Without a functioning staircase, only
 a lift remains to provide access to the balconies above.

>go west


 You head down the hallway and into the darkness. There is quite a bit
 of bumping into things and people, eliciting the occasional squeal
 from the other pig, and after emerging back into the light of the
 foyer, you discover Tuck is now standing behind you.

>smell doors


 You sniff the double doors. Tuck attempts to open them, but he simply
 is not strong enough.

>go north



 Tuck follows you to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose bushes
 with a fountain in the centre. To the north is the ballroom. Stairs
 descend below the wall to the west.

>go north



 Tuck follows you into a magnificent ballroom decorated for a wedding.
 At one end stands the altar, consisting of an arbour, a table and a
 statue of Cupido looking particularly anxious. A few dozen chairs are
 arranged for optimal viewing.

>smell cupido


 You sniff around Hero 1's feet. Tuck bows reverently to the statue, a
 fist at his heart.

>go down


 You cannot go that way. The only available exit is south.

>go south



 Tuck follows you to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose bushes
 with a fountain in the centre. To the south is the foyer. Stairs
 descend below the wall to the west.

>go south



 Tuck follows you to what remains of the foyer of the inner keep. To
 the west is a darkened hallway, to the east is a well-lit hallway and

 labelled 'G' is already depressed.

>smell 1


 You stand on your hind legs and sniff as high as you can reach, just
 below the button labelled '1'. Tuck presses it.

 The lift stutters to life and slowly ascends before coming to a stop.
 You emerge onto the first storey balcony. On this level, you can go
 east to a hallway.

>go east



 Tuck follows you down the first storey hallway. There is a library to
 the north and a stairwell to the east.

>go east



 Tuck follows you to the first storey landing. From here, you can take
 the servants' stairs to the storey above or the ground floor below.

>go down



 You lead Tuck down the stairs and into the narrow service corridor
 running north and south.

>go north


 Tuck manages hardly a few steps into the kitchen when the clown turns
 around.

 "Who is this one?" he asks, but before Tuck can stutter a reply, the
 clown thrusts a large spoon into the squire's hand and pulls him over
 to the cauldron. "It matters not. Friend stirs now," he commands. "The
 sooner Robbit finishes the potion, the sooner Robbit is no longer a
 honky-honky clown, and friend no longer a stinky hume."

 The terrified squire begins to slowly stir the cauldron, earning a
 smack on the back of the hand from the clown. "Stir faster, and stop
 not, or His Lordship will sentence friend to death from laundry duty."
 Tuck stirs with all the strength he can rally.

 "Now for the piggy." The clown picks you up and returns you to the
 pen, mumbling something about the poor quality of piggy fences. After
 closing the gate behind you, he honks back into the kitchen.

>take peg


 You pull out the peg on the first try, having become significantly
 better at this. The gate swings open.

>go north



 You continue to the stableyard. To the north is the barn, and to the
 west is an open doorway leading to the kitchen.

>go west


 You return to the kitchen and find Tuck alone, frantically stirring
 the contents of the cauldron. He looks relieved to see you enter.

 "Oh, little sniffer, what a mess I now find myself in! What can I do?
 Maybe I can find something to scare away the clown." He steps away
 from the cauldron and peers down the service corridor. Seeing no sign
 of the clown, he then hurries over to the table and sorts through
 ingredients.

 "I know not what to look for. What do you suppose clowns are afraid
 of? I daresay, the wizard seems to have a number of frightening
 things—" His elbow catches a jar, tipping it and several others over
 amidst the sound of breaking glass. Tuck yanks his arm away, knocking
 a book and a pepper shaker onto the floor.

 He stands frozen in fearful anticipation of having drawn unwanted
 attention. When no one arrives, he returns straight to the cauldron
 and promptly resumes stirring the brew. "I will never make a good
 hero. Not even a passable hero. I will stir as asked and allow Ser
 Leonhart to save the day," says Tuck reassuringly to himself. "Yes,
 that is for the best."

>examine book


 It's a book of potions. The open page reads:

 COUNTER POTION
 ~   To reverse the effects of any magick potion   ~

 Ingredients
 * three pints of milk
 * one hundred grams of all-purpose flour, sifted
 * ten nail clippings from a bear
 * six tears from a virgin
 * four lizard's legs
 * two owlet wings
 * five strands of hair from heroes (to clarify: hair from five
 separate heroes, and not five strands from the same one)

 Boil the ingredients in a cauldron of rose water, adding them one by
 one while stirring continuously. The potion is finished once it turns
 a bright pink in colour. Note that the ingredients may be difficult to
 come by.

 Bottle immediately and store for up to three years in a cool, dark
 place.

>take pepper


 Taken.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Please excuse the interruption, but I thought you should know you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">can now use the verb SHAKE while carrying the pepper shaker.]</span>

 You make your way to the stableyard. To the north is the barn, and to
 the west is an open doorway leading to the kitchen.

>go north



 You proceed into the large but empty barn. Near the back, an old
 ladder leads to a loft. You can hear creaky footsteps above you.

>shake pepper


 You shake the pepper shaker. A cloud of pepper expands and hovers
 briefly, tickling the nostrils of anyone in its vicinity.

 You sneeze (but hold onto the shaker).

>wait


 Time passes.

>go south



 You make your way to the stableyard. To the south is the pen. To the
 west is an open doorway leading to the kitchen.

>go west



 You continue into the large and dusty kitchen. A narrow service
 corridor lies to the south. A single cauldron bubbles over an open
 flame, filling the room with a vile odour. Jars of assorted
 ingredients are gathered atop a nearby table. On the floor is an open
 book. Tuck is frantically stirring the contents of the cauldron.

>go south



 You enter a narrow service corridor continuing south. A set of
 servants' stairs twists around a wall and disappears above you.

 From the south comes the voice of the clown, in a state of utter
 panic. "Oh no, oh no, oh no. Forget the piggies, the foyer is a mess!
 Rhoda is gone! The heroes escaped!" He pauses and gasps. "What if His
 Lordship blames poor Robbit?" You hear the <span class="floydstyle em">honk honk honk</span> of
 the clown pacing about the room.

>go up



 You head up the stairs to the first storey landing. From here, you can
 continue up to the storey above or go west to the hallway.

>go west



 You proceed down the first storey hallway. There is a library to the
 north and a balcony to the west.

>go north



 You make your way into an expansive library lit by a large window. On
 the southern wall beside the sole entrance hangs a great tapestry. The
 remaining walls are lined with shelves upon shelves of books. A bare
 reading table occupies the centre of the room.

>shake pepper


 You shake the pepper shaker. A cloud of pepper expands and hovers
 briefly, tickling the nostrils of anyone in its vicinity.

 You sneeze (but hold onto the shaker).

>go south



 You return to the first storey hallway, which runs from the balcony to
 the west to the stairwell to the east.

>go east



 You proceed to the first storey landing. From here, you can take the
 servants' stairs to the storey above or the ground floor below.

>go up



 You climb the stairs to the second storey landing. You can continue up
 to the storey above or head west to the hallway.

>go up



 You climb the stairs to the third storey landing. You can head west to

>go west



 You make your way down the third storey hallway. There is a stone
 gargoyle carved into the wall to the north and a balcony to the west.

>shake pepper


 You shake the pepper shaker. A cloud of pepper expands and hovers

 Its countenance was carved into the most hideous of glowers. You are
 reminded of the woman who tended to you when you were young. In one of
 its hands hangs a tasselled cord.

 You continue to the third storey landing. You can take the servants'
 stairs to the storey below.

>go down



 You descend the stairs to the second storey landing. You can continue
 down to the storey below or go west to the hallway.

>go west



 You proceed down the hallway. There is a closed door to the north and
 a balcony to the west. A memorandum has been nailed to the northern
 door.

>go west



 You head to the second storey balcony. Another hallway leads to the
 west. A circular staircase reaches the balconies above and below. A
 call button can summon the lift.

 You cannot go that way. Available exits are east, west, up and down.

>go west



 You make your way down the western hallway. There is a bedroom to the
 west and a bedroom to the north.

>go north



 You head north to a majestic bedroom. Against the far wall is a
 mahogany bed, a totem of devilish creatures carved into each of the
 posts. In another corner is a desk covered in papers. One such paper
 has fallen to the floor.

>examine bed


 It is large and luxurious, if somewhat creepy.

 You cannot see any such thing.

>go south



 You make your way to the western hallway. There is a balcony to the
 east and bedroom to the west.

>go west



 The small bedroom is not as immaculately kept as the other rooms. Oil
 stains are everywhere, including on the hammock that serves as a bed.
 Above the hammock hangs an aged painting. An old woman is hard at work
 tinkering with some kind of vending machine.

 At first, the woman fails to notice you. She removes the lid from a
 tin of pig treats and shoves a handful of them into her mouth.
 However, once she sees you waddle in through the open door, she raises
 an eyebrow as if to say "why is there a pig in my bedroom?" This is
 followed by a glance over at her pig treats, then a horrible glare and
 hissing sound at you to say "oh, you want these treats? Well, too bad,
 they belong to me and not to you!"

>examine woman


 Her age is a mystery, but if you were to hazard a guess, you would say
 somewhere between ninety-six and one hundred and fifty-two. Around her
 neck is a pendant shaped like a jigsaw puzzle piece.

 The scene depicts Blixe, goddess of lightning, of wisdom, invention
 and caffeinated beverages, giving a book of mathematics to Adelstain,
 who you recognise from his portrait in the hallway gallery. The divine
 interaction takes place atop a familiar mountain, the eventual site of
 the Impenetrable Keep.

>examine machine


 The clockwork vending machine stands ominously against the wall, an
 exposed monolith of cogs and axles. Through the glass cover you can
 see spiral coils arranged in lettered rows and numbered columns (A1
 through F8), though the only object available for vending is a
 handbell in D5.

 Along the bottom are a series of coloured switches. In order from left
 to right, they are: a red switch (down), an orange switch (down), a
 yellow switch (down), a green switch (down), a blue switch (down), an
 indigo switch (down), a violet switch (down) and a white switch
 (down). A large button on the side reads: PRESS TO VEND.

>push indigo


 Being a pig, you are limited in what you can do.

>smell indigo


 You sniff the indigo switch.

>examine tin


 The pig on the side of the tin looks unbelievably happy to be eating
 one of the treats. It sits atop a drafting table.

>shake pepper


 You shake the pepper shaker. A cloud of pepper expands and hovers
 briefly, tickling the nostrils of anyone in its vicinity.

 You sneeze (but hold onto the shaker). The old woman sneezes.

 You leave the bedroom behind and return to the western hallway. There
 is a balcony to the east and a bedroom to the north.

 You continue to the first storey landing. From here, you can take the
 servants' stairs to the storey above or the ground floor below.

>go down



 You descend the stairs and enter a narrow service corridor running
 north and south.

>go south


 By the time you return to the receiving room, the clown has started
 crying, and the horror has wrapped a comforting tentacle around him.

 "Robbit shall be sacked for sure," moans the clown. "On the streets,
 begging for scraps from stinky stinky humes!" The horror proffers him
 a handkerchief, which he uses to wipe his eyes and blow his nose
 before handing it back.

 "If doggy was still a doggy," the clown continues, "mayhap doggy could
 find the heroes. Robbit cannot finish the potion without them."

 As you waddle across the room, the horror gestures to you and makes a
 deep, gargling sound. The clown perks a bit. "Petunia thinks so?" he
 asks. "Robbit heard about piggies smelling mushrooms, but heroes?
 Well, piggy stays not in the piggypen anyway." He walks over to you
 and shoves a shiny badge that says "Hero Akademy: Class of '68" in
 your nose, or rather, your snout.

 "Smell this, piggy. Is the heroes' scent. Piggy shall lead Petunia to
 the heroes to collect ingredients and return the heroes to their cage.
 In the meantime, Robbit must see to His Lordship." After granting you
 barely enough time to smell it, Robbit returns the badge to his pocket
 and honks away to the north.

 The horror wipes away the last of her tears and lumbers over to you.
 It seems you have a new friend.

>go east



 The horror follows you to the parlour. Blue and gold floral-printed
 upholstery matches the paper on the walls. Beside a chaise lounge is
 the worst attempt at a standing lamp you have ever seen. The smoking
 room lies to the south.

>smell lamp


 You sniff around Hero 2's feet.

 The horror gently lifts the lampshade off the hero's head, and you
 watch as the walls of his sanity begin to crumble. He cries, he
 laughs, he mumbles gibberish, all while the horror caresses him with
 her tentacles.

 After a distinct period of time known only to the horror, she opens a
 portal to the partially-flooded cell beneath the keep and pushes him
 through, plucking a single hair from his head as he goes. Then she
 lifts one tentacle into the air.

 One found, you suppose.

>go west



 The horror follows you to the receiving room. There is a narrow
 service corridor to the north, a well-lit hallway to the west and a
 dining room to the south.

>go west



 The horror follows you down a long hallway lined with portraits. Ahead
 to the west is the foyer.

>go west



 The horror follows you to what remains of the foyer of the inner keep.
 To the north is a courtyard, to the west is a darkened hallway and to
 the south are the closed double doors to the bailey. A call button can
 summon the lift.

>go south


 You squeeze through the doggy door and onto the northern end of the
 bailey, with the rest of the bailey to the south, southeast and
 southwest. The horror follows you through the doors, closing them
 behind you.

 The dragon, somehow free of its chain, comes leaping and bounding
 towards the horror, barking and wagging its tail. With a wave of her
 tentacle, the horror commands the dragon to sit up on its hind legs,
 then lie down. After performing several more tricks, the dragon falls
 in line behind her.

>go south



 You return to the dogtower, the horror and dragon close behind. From
 here, you can go back north, or continue south, east or west.

>go south



 You lead the horror and the dragon to the southern end of the bailey.
 You can go north, northeast, northwest or south across the drawbridge.

 You lead the horror and the dragon across the bailey, arriving at the
 double doors of the inner keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the
 south, with the rest of the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

>go north


 You squeeze through the doggy door and return to what's left of the
 foyer. The horror follows not long after, opening and then closing the
 double doors behind you. To the north is a courtyard, to the west a
 darkened hallway and to the east a well-lit hallway.

>go north



 The horror follows you to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose
 bushes with a fountain in the centre. To the north is the ballroom.
 Stairs descend below the wall to the west.

>go north



 The horror follows you into a magnificent ballroom decorated for a
 wedding. At one end stands the altar, consisting of an arbour, a table
 and a statue of Cupido looking particularly anxious. A few dozen
 chairs are arranged for optimal viewing.

>shake pepper


 You shake the pepper shaker. A cloud of pepper expands and hovers
 briefly, tickling the nostrils of anyone in its vicinity.

 You sneeze (but hold onto the shaker). The horror sneezes. Hero 1
 sneezes.

>smell hero


 You sniff around Hero 1's feet.

 The horror coaxes open the hero's eyes, and you watch as the walls of
 his sanity begin to crumble. As you have witnessed before, the horror
 transports him to the small cell beneath the keep, keeping a strand of
 hair for herself. Then she lifts two tentacles into the air, a
 reminder of how many heroes have been found.

>go south



 The horror follows you to a cobblestoned courtyard enclosed by rose
 bushes with a fountain in the centre. To the south is the foyer.
 Stairs descend below the wall to the west.

 soon joins the both of you.

 You shake the pepper shaker. A cloud of pepper expands and hovers
 briefly, tickling the nostrils of anyone in its vicinity.

 You sneeze (but hold onto the shaker). The horror sneezes. The dragon
 sneezes.

 here, you can go back north, or continue south, east or west.

>go south



 You lead the horror and the dragon to the southern end of the bailey.
 You can go north, northeast, northwest or south across the drawbridge.

>go south



 You cross the drawbridge and return to the opposite side of the moat,
 where a cornucopia of old and broken puzzles spills out of an
 overturned rubbish bin. The horror and dragon remain close behind.

>examine bin


 It has been overturned, revealing a number of old and broken puzzles.

 foyer. The horror follows not long after, opening and then closing the
 double doors behind you. To the north is a courtyard, to the west a
 darkened hallway and to the east a well-lit hallway.

>go west


 The horror follows you into the darkness. There is quite a bit of
 bumping into things and people, eliciting the occasional squeal from
 the other pig, and after emerging back into the light of the foyer,
 you discover Ser Leonhart is now standing behind you.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart follows you down a long hallway lined with portraits.
 Ahead to the east is the receiving room.

>go north


 You cannot go that way. Available exits are east and west.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the receiving room. There are rooms to the
 east and south, as well a service corridor to the north.

>go north



 You lead Ser Leonhart into the narrow service corridor continuing to
 the north. A set of servants' stairs twists around a wall and
 disappears above you.

>go north


 Ser Leonhart follows you into the kitchen. He is surprised to discover
 Tuck exerting himself over a cauldron.

 "There you are, my slippery sidekick!" exclaims the knight. "What is
 this foul creation you are brewing?"

 "I-I know not, milord," replies Tuck, "but I'm not permitted to stop."

 Ser Leonhart gasps. "You have been enchanted by the evil wizard,
 forced to assist him in his devilry!"

 "I apologise, milord, what I meant to say is that—"

 "Worry not," interrupts the knight. "With the sniffer's help, I shall
 slay the wizard and release you from his spell." He grips the younger
 man's shoulder in a gesture of confidence.

 Tuck sighs and returns to the stirring.

>go north


 You cannot go that way. Available exits are south and east.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the stableyard. To the north is the barn,
 and to the west is an open doorway leading to the kitchen.

>go north



 Ser Leonhart follows you into the large but empty barn. Near the back,
 an old ladder leads to a loft. You can hear creaky footsteps above
 you.

>smell ladder

 You sniff the ancient ladder. Ser Leonhart hops onto the rungs and
 ascends partway before the wood snaps in two. Gravity brings him down,
 and not gently.

 "How many times have I told you this is my hiding sp—" comes a voice
 from above, and Hero 4 pokes his head over the side of the loft. He
 gasps. "Georgie? Little 'Georgie Porgie' Leonhart from Hero Akademy?
 It has been an age! How have you been? My, to what heights you have
 grown! And you lost weight! At the same time, how wonderful!"

 "Percy?" Ser Leonhart can hardly believe his eyes. "How is it you are
 here?"

 "I ascended the mountain to rescue the princess, of course," replies
 Hero 4. "Tell me, are you not also here to rescue the princess, win
 her love and affection, marry her and receive her ten million doubloon
 dowry? Well, you have embarked on this quest for naught, because I
 shall succeed first." He pauses. "After I find a way down from here.
 Would you lend a hand?"

 "Certainly—that is, I can certainly help you down. I have no
 interest
 in marrying Her Highness, only in seeing to her safe return home. So,
 if you could slowly lower yourself over the—"

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Hero 4 throws himself off the loft and onto Ser Leonhart, who
 collapses under the other man's weight. The two immediately rise and
 appraise each other for broken parts.

 "Thank you, Georgie," says Hero 4. He smooths his beard. "The lead
 actor always receives the accolades, but it is important to appreciate
 the supporting cast."

 "Aye," agrees Ser Leonhart. "Which is why I appreciate you most
 genuinely."

 Hero 4 makes a face like he bit into something sour, but he recovers
 quickly. "Nay, Georgie, it is I who appreciates you most sincerely."

 "I must insist that I am the one who appreciates you most
 indubitably," replies Ser Leonhart.

 The two argue over who appreciates the other more until they forget
 why they were arguing in the first place. Hero 4 holds up a finger.
 "We could appreciate each other all day, but alas, the princess's time
 wanes. There is a plan, the best plan of them all I might add,
 submerged in the deepest river of my mind, and I am but a simple
 trout, skimming the surface when I should be plunging into its depths.
 You must leave me to think now, Georgie, good old Georgie, but best of
 luck to you. You shall need it!" He begins to pace about the barn.

 Ser Leonhart, ready to rescue the princess himself, returns to your
 side.

>go south



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the stableyard. To the south is the pen.
 To the west is an open doorway leading to the kitchen.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart follows you into the large and dusty kitchen. A narrow
 service corridor lies to the south. A single cauldron bubbles over an
 open flame, filling the room with a vile odour. Jars of assorted
 ingredients are gathered atop a nearby table. On the floor is an open
 book. Tuck is frantically stirring the contents of the cauldron.

>go south



 You lead Ser Leonhart into the narrow service corridor continuing to
 the south. A set of servants' stairs twists around a wall and
 disappears above you.

>go up



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the first storey landing. From here, you
 can continue up to the storey above or go west to the hallway.

>go up



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the second storey landing. You can
 continue up to the storey above or head west to the hallway.

>go up



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the third storey landing. You can head
 west to the hallway.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart follows you down the third storey hallway. There is a
 stone gargoyle carved into the wall to the north and a balcony to the
 west.

>shake pepper


 You shake the pepper shaker. A cloud of pepper expands and hovers
 briefly, tickling the nostrils of anyone in its vicinity.

 You sneeze (but hold onto the shaker). Ser Leonhart sneezes. The
 gargoyle sneezes, and he spits out a bottle of blue potion, which Ser
 Leonhart deftly plucks from the air.

 "This appears to be some sort of magick potion," says the knight as he
 looks it over. "I will not partake in such devilry." He smashes the
 potion on the ground.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the third storey landing. You can take the
 servants' stairs to the storey below.

>go down



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the second storey landing. You can
 continue down to the storey below or go west to the hallway.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart follows you down the hallway. There is a closed door to
 the north and a balcony to the west. A memorandum has been nailed to
 the northern door.

>smell northern door


 You sniff the door, and Ser Leonhart tries to open it. Discovering
 it's locked, he instead attempts to read the memo. You think it the
 perfect opportunity for a short nap.

 And yet, before you can settle down and descend into slumber, the
 knight recognises two of the memo's many words and shouts in triumph.
 "Princess Joy is here! We must free the princess from her prison!"

 From inside the room comes the scratchy tenor of an adolescent male.
 "Who goes there?"

 Ser Leonhart rises to his full height, holding a fist against his
 chest. "Princess Joy, be those your dulcet tones passing through
 yonder door? Let not despair linger a moment longer in your heart, for
 it is I, Ser Leonhart, who have come to rescue you from the clutches
 of the evil wizard. Allow me to escort you away, to wherever your
 heart desires."

 There is a significant pause before the next response, this time a
 squeaky falsetto. "Yes, (some sounds of a clearing throat) yes, my
 brave and glorious knight, I'm most certainly Princess Joy. Prithee,
 uh—grant me a moment to make myself decent." This is followed by
 some
 frantic shuffling and the rustling of fabric.

>wait


 Time passes.

>wait


 Time passes.

>smell northern door


 You sniff the door, and Ser Leonhart tries to open it. It's locked.
 You remember the ring of keys on the knight's belt.

>smell keys

 You sniff the keys. Ser Leonhart tries each one in the lock until, at
 last, it turns. He charges through the door, and you hurry in after
 him.

 You know a few things about the bedrooms of teenage girls, but you
 never expected to see one here. Of particular note is a brightly lit
 vanity covered in wigs, ersatz jewellery and one specially large and
 overflowing box of makeup. An open wardrobe is full of dresses and
 capes and boas and heels. On the walls are posters of boy bands like 5
 Seconds of Winter and Four Directions (before they broke up,
 naturally). The largest poster of them all is of Zifmia the
 Adventurer, mayhap the kingdom's most famous and subversive drag
 queen, clad all in leather, with her crown askew and her makeup
 artfully smeared.

 In the centre of the room waits the wizard's son, Tristain, wearing
 the pinkest and fluffiest dress you have ever seen. His arms are
 crossed over his chest, partly to disguise his lack of a bust and
 partly to hold up the dress (being unable to lace the back by
 himself). His blonde shake-and-go wig is painfully dry, his contouring
 is a touch too harsh and his left eyelash is only partially glued.
 Despite all these flaws, you have to give him credit for producing
 such an effort in so little time.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Ser Leonhart, meanwhile, is starstruck. "Your Highness," he says,
 sinking to one knee and bowing his head. "I have heard tales of your
 beauty, but mere words cannot describe the magnificence of your
 presence. You are a vision of Lunara herself, goddess of the moon, of
 beauty, elopements and gin. Would you do me the honour of accompanying
 you home?"

 "Home?" Tristain-as-Joy starts, but he immediately corrects himself.
 "Why home, yes, of course, Ser Knight. Give me a few minutes to pack
 my things. Any of my dresses left behind are likely to be tossed into
 the nearest fireplace by my fa—er, I mean, what did you call him
 again? Oh yes, the evil wizard."

 "I shall not leave your side for an instant," says the knight, drawing
 his sword and preparing to stand guard, but Tristain ushers him
 towards the door.

 "Be not so silly. There is no reason for you to watch me sort through
 my unmentionables. I shall meet you down in the foyer. Yes, that
 sounds like a brilliant plan, I'm so glad you thought of it. Off you
 go!" And before Ser Leonhart can protest, Tristain has you both (with
 a curious but passing glance in your direction) out the door.

 On your way out, you notice Hero 5 falling and landing on the stone
 sill outside one of the bedroom windows. He rises to his feet and
 presses himself against the glass for a better view of the inside.
 Spotting Tristain dressed as the princess, he becomes very excited; so
 excited, he loses his balance and falls once more to the storey below.

 Tristain closes the door, leaving you and the knight alone in the
 hallway.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the second storey balcony. Another hallway
 leads to the west. A circular staircase reaches the balconies above
 and below. A call button can summon the lift.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart follows you down the western hallway. There is a bedroom
 to the west and a bedroom to the north.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart follows you into a cluttered and oil-stained bedroom. On
 the wall above a hammock hangs an aged painting. An old woman is hard
 at work tinkering with some kind of vending machine.

 "Oh my," says the woman when Ser Leonhart enters. "You have not yet
 declared your intentions for courtship, and yet here you are, having
 stolen into my bedroom. What ever is a maiden to do?"

 The knight assumes a heroic pose. "My name is Ser Leonhart, and I'm on
 a quest to rescue the Princess Joy."

 "Of course you are," says the woman, hobbling over to him. "There is
 naught that warms my heart like a big, strong,
 intellectually-challenged hero. Come hither and play a little game for
 my entertainment."

 Ser Leonhart shakes his head. "There is naught time for games, and I
 mustn't let my guard down. There is dark magick at work in these
 halls."

 "Oh, you will find no witchcraft in my bedchambers. Puzzles are
 <span class="floydstyle em">my</span> speciality. Here." She points at the vending machine. "All
 you must do is solve the puzzle, retrieve the handbell and claim your
 prize." She returns to her drafting table and chews on another handful
 of pig treats.

>smell indigo


 You sniff the vending machine, and Ser Leonhart levels his sword at
 it.

 "So, evil wizard, you have taken the form of this contraption to try
 and confuse me."

 The old woman raises an eyebrow. "Uh, what are you doing?"

 The knight continues. "But here I am, at last, ready to bring down the
 heavy fist of justice. The time has come for me to end your reign of
 terror!" And before the old woman can stop him, Ser Leonhart has
 smashed through the glass with his sword, sending cogs and axles and
 spiral coils all over the room.

 The woman lets out a blood-curdling scream. "Look what you did, you
 festering buffoon! You sack of rotten potatoes! You peer-reviewed
 proof of reverse evolution! All that work, gone, gone, gone!" She
 picks up the tin of pig treats and smacks him over the head with it,
 over and over again, until he rushes out into the hallway. You follow
 close behind, not wanting to be on the sharp end of her wrath any more
 than he does.

 Once you both are out of harm's way, she throws the tin of pig treats
 and the handbell at his face and slams the door shut. You can hear her
 sliding what's left of the vending machine in front of the door,
 blocking it for good.

>drop pepper


 Dropped.

>take bell


 Taken.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Author here. You can also use the verb SHAKE while carrying the</span>

>shake bell


 You ring the bell, but aside from the sound, nothing happens.

>smell pepper


 You sniff the pepper shaker. Ser Leonhart attacks it with his sword
 but produces nary a scratch. You find yourself suitably impressed by
 the quality of modern pepper shakers.

>go north



 Ser Leonhart follows you north to a majestic bedroom. Against the far
 wall is a mahogany bed, a totem of devilish creatures carved into each
 of the posts. In another corner is a desk covered in papers. One such
 paper has fallen to the floor.

>smell bed


 You sniff the bed. Ser Leonhart nicks the wood in several places with
 his sword, but ultimately decides the wizard has not been harmed.

>smell desk


 You sniff the desk. Ser Leonhart nicks the wood in several places with
 his sword, but ultimately decides the wizard has not been harmed.

>go south



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the western hallway. There is a balcony to
 the east and closed door to the west. A tin of pig treats lies on its
 side near a wall.

 You can see a pepper shaker here.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the second storey balcony. Another hallway
 leads to the east. A circular staircase reaches the balconies above
 and below. A call button can summon the lift.

>smell button


 You sniff as high as you can reach, just below the call button. Ser
 Leonhart inspects it, but he cannot fathom the wizard turning into a
 small disk mounted on the wall.

>go down



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the first storey balcony, which curves
 along the far wall and turns down a hallway to the east. The lift
 stands ready to take you to another storey.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart follows you down the first storey hallway. There is a
 library to the north and a stairwell to the east.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the first storey landing. From here, you
 can take the servants' stairs to the storey above or the ground floor
 below.

>go down



 You lead Ser Leonhart down the stairs and into the narrow service
 corridor running north and south.

>go south



 Ser Leonhart follows you to the receiving room. There are rooms to the
 east and south, as well as a well-lit hallway through the open door to
 the west.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart follows you down a long hallway lined with portraits.
 Ahead to the west is the foyer.

>go west


 Ser Leonhart follows you to what remains of the foyer of the inner
 keep. To the north is a courtyard, to the west is a darkened hallway
 and to the south are the closed double doors to the bailey. A call
 button can summon the lift.

 As you enter the foyer, Tristain (disguised as Princess Joy) exits the
 lift, dragging a number of stuffed suitcases with him. He collects
 himself, checks his makeup in a compact mirror and then notices the
 knight. "Yoo-hoo, hello again! You certainly did a number on the
 foyer. Not that I care. Anyway, I forgot I was already mostly packed
 for my supposed honeymoon. Shall we be off?" He drops a pair of
 sunglasses over his eyes and gathers his belongings for the journey
 ahead.

 Ser Leonhart finds one knee. "Your Highness! I would follow you to the
 ends of the earth, but alas, I must first rescue my squire and slay
 the evil wizard."

 "Yes, that would be a prudent course of action," replies Tristain.
 "Except, um, I'm sure your squire will be fine. Eaglets never become
 eagles without learning to fly. Also, the wizard is very adept at
 disguises. You shall never find him, so we might as well take our
 leave."

 But Ser Leonhart shakes his head. "We have a secret weapon, Your
 Highness. I have in my service a wizard sniffer, who can follow the
 wizard's scent and lead us directly to him." He points at you.

 Tristain inspects you over his sunglasses. Then he inspects you a
 little more. And then a little more. "Now, for the sake of argument,
 what would you do if your wizard sniffer turns out to be naught more
 than an ordinary pig?"

 "That is entirely not possible," replies the knight. "I have the
 assurance of the very capitalist who sold him to me."

 Tristain purses his lips. "Ah, that explains everything," he says,
 replacing his sunglasses. "Very well, I shall make the journey alone.
 I wish you the best of luck, Ser Knight, in all your—oh no, Scruffle
 Wuffles!" As Tristain opens the double doors, he discovers the dragon
 standing on the other side.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 "I shall save you, princess!" shouts Ser Leonhart, and he quickly
 shuts the doors and bars them with his body. "I have battled this
 dragon before. It's a most ferocious creature. We must find another
 way out of the castle."

 Finding a seat on top of a suitcase, Tristain rests his chin on one
 hand and mulls over his options. After a minute or so he comes upon an
 idea.

 He springs to his feet and hurries over to Ser Leonhart, taking one of
 the knight's hands and pressing it against his own heart. "Ser Knight,
 my brave and chivalrous knight, we have but one chance, and only if
 you are brave and chivalrous enough for such a mission."

 Ser Leonhart returns to his knee, his face a deep red. "There is nary
 a challenge too great for the protector of the princess."

 Tristain titters girlishly, making a show of it. "Well, there is a
 potion that can return—I mean turn the dragon into a tiny, harmless
 dog. Think of all the peasant villages you would save from being
 ravaged by the beast! Robbit—I mean, a goblin is brewing the potion
 in
 the kitchen. Once the potion is done, it will turn pink in colour.
 Bring me a bottle of it, and we can be on our way. I shall wait here
 for your return." He sits down on a suitcase, bats his eyelashes and
 smiles.

>go west


 Ser Leonhart follows you into the darkness. There is quite a bit of
 bumping into things and people, eliciting the occasional squeal from
 the other pig, and after emerging back into the light of the foyer,
 you discover the horror is now standing behind you.

 Tristain dives behind his suitcases to keep from being seen.

>go east



 The horror follows you down a long hallway lined with portraits. Ahead
 to the east is the receiving room.

>go east



 The horror follows you to the receiving room. There are rooms to the
 east and south, as well a service corridor to the north.

>go north



 You lead the horror into the narrow service corridor continuing to the
 north. A set of servants' stairs twists around a wall and disappears
 above you.

>go north



 The horror follows you into the large and dusty kitchen. An open
 doorway to the outside lies to the east. A single cauldron bubbles
 over an open flame, filling the room with a vile odour. Jars of
 assorted ingredients are gathered atop a nearby table. On the floor is
 an open book. Tuck is frantically stirring the contents of the
 cauldron, which should be enough to keep him distracted from turning
 around and laying eyes on the horror, so long as you avoid him.

>go east



 The horror follows you to the stableyard. To the north is the barn,
 and to the west is an open doorway leading to the kitchen.

>go north


 The horror follows you into the barn where she discovers Hero 4 pacing
 back and forth. He stops as you enter, and after seeing the terrible
 visage of the horror, the walls of his sanity begin to crumble. As you
 have witnessed before, the horror transports him to the small cell
 beneath the keep, keeping a strand of hair for herself. Then she lifts
 three tentacles into the air, a reminder of how many heroes have been
 found.

>examine horror


 You have heard tales of unnameable horrors, and unlike your
 companions, you possess the constitution to look upon one. Or, perhaps
 their maddening appearance has no effect on ordinary pigs. In any
 event, you never suspected they wore so many ribbons.

>go south



 The horror follows you to the stableyard. To the south is the pen. To
 the west is an open doorway leading to the kitchen.

>go west



 The horror follows you into the large and dusty kitchen. A narrow
 service corridor lies to the south. A single cauldron bubbles over an
 open flame, filling the room with a vile odour. Jars of assorted
 ingredients are gathered atop a nearby table. On the floor is an open
 book. Tuck is frantically stirring the contents of the cauldron.

>go south



 You lead the horror into the narrow service corridor continuing to the
 south. A set of servants' stairs twists around a wall and disappears
 above you.

>go up



 The horror follows you to the first storey landing. From here, you can
 continue up to the storey above or go west to the hallway.

>go west



 The horror follows you down the first storey hallway. There is a
 library to the north and a balcony to the west.

>go north



 The horror follows you into an expansive library lit by an open
 window. On the southern wall beside the sole entrance hangs a great
 tapestry, bulging a bit in the middle. The remaining walls are lined
 with shelves upon shelves of books. A bare reading table occupies the
 centre of the room.

>examine tapestry


 The large tapestry depicts a demon standing on a rocky shoreline in
 the midst of a storm. In one hand he holds a bell; the other is
 outstretched, feeding a murder of crows that hovers around him. A pair
 of boots poke out from below the tapestry.

>smell boots


 You sniff around Hero 5's feet.

 The horror gently shifts the tapestry to the side to reveal the hero,
 and you watch as the walls of his sanity begin to crumble. As you have
 witnessed before, the horror transports him to the small cell beneath
 the keep, keeping a strand of hair for herself. Then she lifts four
 tentacles into the air, a reminder of how many heroes have been found.

>go south



 You return to the first storey hallway, which runs from the balcony to
 the west to the stairwell to the east. The horror remains close
 behind.

>smell button


 You cannot see any such thing.

>examine button


 You cannot see any such thing.

>examine lift


 You cannot see any such thing.

>go west



 You emerge from the hallway with the horror in tow onto the first
 storey balcony. A circular staircase only rises to the balcony above,
 as the descending section into the foyer has collapsed. A call button
 can summon the lift.

>smell button


 You sniff as high as you can reach, just below the call button. The
 horror backs away, shaking her head.

>go east



 The horror follows you down the first storey hallway. There is a
 library to the north and a stairwell to the east.

>go east



 The horror follows you to the first storey landing. From here, you can
 take the servants' stairs to the storey above or the ground floor
 below.

>go down



 You lead the horror down the stairs and into the narrow service
 corridor running north and south.

>go south



 The horror follows you to the receiving room. There are rooms to the
 east and south, as well as a well-lit hallway through the open door to
 the west.

>go west



 The horror follows you down a long hallway lined with portraits. Ahead
 to the west is the foyer.

>go west



 The horror follows you to what remains of the foyer of the inner keep.
 To the north is a courtyard, to the west is a darkened hallway and to
 the south are the closed double doors to the bailey. Without a
 functioning staircase, only a lift remains to provide access to the
 balconies above. Not wanting to be caught by any of the castle staff,
 Tristain has hidden himself behind his pile of suitcases.

>go south


 You squeeze through the doggy door and onto the northern end of the
 bailey, with the rest of the bailey to the south, southeast and
 southwest. The horror follows you through the doors, and the dragon
 soon joins the both of you.

>shake bell


 You ring the bell, and a murder of crows descends from the sky. The
 dragon, however, quickly chases them away.

>go south



 You return to the dogtower, the horror and dragon close behind. From
 here, you can go back north, or continue south, east or west.

>examine tower


 Hero 3 is hiding inside the dogtower above its entrance, pressing
 against the walls with his hands and feet to keep himself aloft.

>smell hero


 You sniff the dogtower.

 The horror reaches a tentacle inside and pulls the hero down to the
 ground. You watch as the walls of his sanity begin to crumble. She
 collects her last strand of hair, casting the body through to the cell
 with the others. After all is said and done she turns to you, lifts
 five tentacles in the air and claps them together.

 All that is left is to complete the potion.

>go north



 You lead the horror and the dragon across the bailey, arriving at the
 double doors of the inner keep. The dogtower stands behind you to the
 south, with the rest of the bailey to the southeast and southwest.

>go north


 You squeeze through the doggy door and return to what's left of the
 foyer. The horror follows not long after, opening and then closing the
 double doors behind you. To the north is a courtyard, to the west a
 darkened hallway and to the east a well-lit hallway. Without a
 functioning staircase, only a lift remains to provide access to the
 balconies above.

>go east



 The horror follows you down a long hallway lined with portraits. Ahead
 to the east is the receiving room.

>go east



 The horror follows you to the receiving room. There are rooms to the
 east and south, as well a service corridor to the north.

>go north



 You lead the horror into the narrow service corridor continuing to the
 north. A set of servants' stairs twists around a wall and disappears
 above you.

>go north

 Robbit is waiting for you as you lead the horror into the kitchen.

 "Did Petunia find the stinky heroes?" he asks. The horror claps her
 tentacles together excitedly and skips over to the cauldron. Leaning
 over the edge, she spits out the five strands of hair. Each one sinks
 into the brew.

 Tuck, meanwhile, recoils in shock at the arrival of the horror. He
 flings his body under the table and curls up into a ball, rocking back
 and forth while holding his head.

 "Done!" exclaims the clown once the mixture curdles into a bright pink
 soup. "Robbit makes sure this is good, yes?" He stirs the cauldron
 with the large spoon, and, scooping up a generous amount, he swallows
 it down in one gulp. A puff of smoke surrounds him, and when it
 clears, a goblin wearing a footman's livery appears where the clown
 once stood.

 "Robbit is cured!" he shouts, looking himself over. He even takes a
 few steps to ensure his shoes have lost their squeak.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Unable to wait any longer, the horror steals the spoon from the goblin
 and scoops up some of the potion for herself. She is surrounded by a
 similar puff of smoke, and yet when this one clears, the same
 terrifying horror stands before you. Instead, the multitude of ribbons
 in her head-tentacles have vanished.

 She feels up and down her head-tentacles, and finding no ribbons, she
 squeals in delight. She lifts up the goblin (despite his kicks and
 protests) and plants many kisses on his head with all of her mouths.
 Once satisfied with herself, the horror replaces the goblin and skips
 away to the south, humming merrily as she goes.

 The goblin wipes the slobber off his face. He then gives Tuck a swift
 kick to the rear. "What is friend doing under there? Help Robbit carry
 the big potty up to storage." He puts on a pair of oven mitts and
 picks up the whole cauldron. Tuck circles round to the other side but
 needs only help stabilise the unwieldy vessel.

 "Robbit cannot see around the bloody potty," continues the goblin.
 "Friend is taller, so friend can be Robbit's eyes, and Robbit shall
 follow. Onward!"

 Tuck, unsure of where the goblin wants him to go exactly, looks over
 at you.

>go south



 You lead Tuck and Robbit into the narrow service corridor continuing
 to the south. A set of servants' stairs twists around a wall and
 disappears above you.

>go up


 The goblin clicks his teeth to gain Tuck's attention. "Robbit cannot
 carry the potty on those stairs! Friend must make for the lift." He
 motions to the south.

>go south



 Tuck and Robbit follow you to the receiving room. There are rooms to
 the east and south, as well as a well-lit hallway through the open
 door to the west.

>go west



 Tuck and Robbit follow you down a long hallway lined with portraits.
 Ahead to the west is the foyer.

>go west



 Tuck and Robbit follow you to what remains of the foyer of the inner
 keep. To the north is a courtyard, to the west is a darkened hallway
 and to the south are the closed double doors to the bailey. Without a
 functioning staircase, only a lift remains to provide access to the
 balconies above. Tristain is hiding behind his pile of suitcases.

>smell lift


 You sniff the lift, and after Tuck opens the door, you lead your
 entourage inside. With the two companions in addition to the cauldron,
 there is not much room to spare. Next to the door is a horizontal row
 of buttons, labelled '3', '2', '1' and 'G' from left to right. The
 button labelled 'G' is already depressed.

>smell 2


 You stand on your hind legs and sniff as high as you can reach, just
 below the button labelled '2'. Tuck presses it.

 The lift stutters to life and slowly ascends before coming to a stop.
 You emerge onto the second storey balcony. On this level, you can
 follow hallways to the east or west.

>smell lift


 You sniff the lift, and after Tuck opens the door, you lead your
 entourage inside. Next to the door is a horizontal row of buttons,
 labelled '3', '2', '1' and 'G' from left to right. The button labelled
 '2' is already depressed.

>smell 3


 You stand on your hind legs and sniff as high as you can reach, just
 below the button labelled '3'. Tuck presses it.

 The lift stutters to life and slowly ascends before coming to a stop.
 You emerge with your entourage onto the highest balcony. On this
 level, you can go east to a hallway or up the spiral staircase to the
 tower.

>go east

 Tuck and Robbit follow you down the third storey hallway, where a
 stone gargoyle has been carved into the wall. The goblin drops the
 cauldron, glad to be rid of the heavy weight, and puts his mouth
 directly inside one of the gargoyle's ears. "Schrank!" he shouts.
 "Wake up, Schrank!"

 The gargoyle wakes with a start, shouting something in a language you
 fail to understand. Realising the source of the clamour is only Robbit
 and therefore not a threat, he yawns and stretches, smacking his lips
 and scratching an armpit.

 "Robbit would shout not if Schrank was a lighter sleeper. Now, Robbit
 needs the potion closet, please and thanking you."

 The gargoyle shakes his head and says something else.

 Rolling his eyes, the goblin tugs three times on the tasselled cord
 hanging from the gargoyle's hands. "There is the code. Robbit hopes
 Schrank is happy now."

 The gargoyle grins then opens his mouth wide, and wider, and wider,
 until you find yourself looking through a passage into a closet full
 of shelves, each shelf full of bottled potions. Robbit drags the
 cauldron into the closet, and using a ladle and funnel, he begins to
 fill up a number of empty bottles. He hands the first one to Tuck.

 "Sorry! Robbit completely forgot to give friend a sippy. Friend should
 have said something!" He resumes filling the bottles.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Only after corking the last bottle does Robbit notice that Tuck never
 drank his potion. "Robbit is confused," he says, stepping out of the
 closet. He tugs three more times on the cord to close the gargoyle's
 gaping maw. "Why would friend stay a stinky hume? Robbit has the
 feeling that friend does not want to drink the counter potion. Robbit
 has the feeling that friend <span class="floydstyle em">likes</span> being a stinky hume. Robbit
 is not sure friend is a friend at all."

 Tuck backs away from the goblin's advances. "N-n-n-no, you see, Mr.
 Goblin, sir, I believe there may have been a little misunderstanding,
 in that I'm a stinky hume, er, human—well, not exactly stinky. I
 mean,
 I believe in good personal hygiene as much as anyone, but the journey
 was long and arduous and I have not a decent bath in a fortnight,
 and—"

 The squire is interrupted by a high-pitched voice, coming from the
 west. "Robbit!" shouts the voice. "Robbit, you soggy lump of drain
 hair! Have you finished my counter potion? Or do you think I enjoy
 being stuck in the body of a non-denominational winter holiday elf?"

 The goblin snatches the potion out of Tuck's hands. "His Lordship
 needs this," he sneers. "But Robbit shall be right back to finish the
 talking." He stomps away to the west.

 Once Robbit is out of sight, Tuck turns to you. "I think we ought not
 be here when he returns," he whispers. "But we should tell Ser
 Leonhart where they keep the potions." He scratches his head. "If we
 can find him, that is."

>go west



 You lead Tuck to the third storey balcony. Ahead of you rises a spiral
 staircase to the keep's highest tower. The main staircase descends to
 the balcony below, curving around the waiting lift.

>smell lift


 You sniff the lift, and after Tuck opens the door, you lead him
 inside. Next to the door on the southern wall is a horizontal row of
 buttons, labelled '3', '2', '1' and 'G' from left to right. The button
 labelled '3' is already depressed.

>smell g

 You stand on your hind legs and sniff as high as you can reach, just
 below the rightmost button. Tuck presses it. The lift stutters to
 life, slowly descending all the way to the ground.

 You emerge into the foyer. You can go north to the courtyard, south
 through the double doors to the bailey, east to the well-lit hallway
 or west to the darkened hallway.

 The moment Tristain sees Tuck, he forgets his disguise. His voice
 drops an octave. "Hi," he says.

 Tuck is equally transfixed. "Hi, uh, miss," he says.

 Tristain clears his throat. "Yes, miss—I mean, what an adorable pig!
 It seems like everyone has a pig companion these days. I hope I have
 not missed a trend."

 "Oh, this is a wizard sniffer," replies Tuck. "Ser Leonhart and I are
 using him to find the evil wizard."

 Tristain sashays over to you and pets you gingerly on the head. "Ah,
 you are a friend of Ser Knight's. His squire, perhaps? How nice it
 must be to share such adventures with a friend." He falls silent as he
 drifts away, but only for a moment. "By the way, I should mention this
 is not a boy-wizard sniffer, but a girl-wizard sniffer. I gather you
 have little experience with wizard sniffers. Or pigs, for that
 matter."

 "No, miss. I come from a family of knights, though I must serve as
 squire before I am knighted. Not that I had much choice in the
 matter." As he speaks, Tuck looks you over with fresh information. You
 back up against the wall.

 "I bear similar feelings," Tristain says. "My father wishes me to be
 like him, but... I'm not."

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Tuck laughs, which catches the other off guard. "I doubt you shall
 become aught like your father. You are a girl!"

 "A rather sublime example of one, I should think," says Tristain, not
 missing a beat. "Please, call me Tri—I mean, I am Princess Joy."

 Tuck gasps and throws himself onto the floor. "Your Highness! My
 sincerest apologies, if only I knew! Squire Tuck, at your service."

 "Tuck?" repeats Tristain, stifling a laugh. "I know a few things about
 tucks."

 "Really? I'm acquainted with no other."

 "Mayhap I should introduce you," says Tristain, winking, which elicits
 a perplexed blush from the squire, which in turn prompts Tristain to
 start fanning himself. He quickly changes the subject. "So, I told Ser
 Knight I would wait for him here, and I believe I last saw him follow
 your, uh, sniffer down yonder hallway for what is surely an important
 reason. Once he accomplishes the task given to him, we may all leave
 together. How does that sound?"

 Tuck jumps to his feet. "Oh, I would like that very much. This is such
 a dreadful place."

 "You know not the half of it," says Tristain with a frown.

>go west


 Tuck follows you into the darkness. There is quite a bit of bumping
 into things and people, eliciting the occasional squeal from the other
 pig, and after emerging back into the light of the foyer, you discover
 Ser Leonhart is now standing behind you.

 "Ser Knight!" calls Tristain. "You have missed your squire! He went in
 where you came from." He points down the darkened hallway and smiles.

>drop bell


 Dropped.

>f w


 Your command was not recognised.

>go west

 Ser Leonhart follows you into the darkness. There is quite a bit of
 bumping into things and people, eliciting the occasional squeal from
 the other pig, and after emerging back into the light of the foyer,
 you discover Tuck is now standing behind you.

 Tristain's smile flattens. He looks down the hallway, then back at
 Tuck. "You are not very good at this, are you?"

 "Oh, I shall never succeed in this hero business!" The squire flops
 down on the suitcase next to Tristain, who immediately starts fanning
 himself.

 "Be not so hard on yourself. With practice, I'm confident you shall be
 a great hero."

 Tuck shakes his head. "I am sorry, Your Highness. I should not be
 bothering you with my problems while you are kidnapped."

 "Nonsense," says Tristain, waving a hand. "I'm happy to listen and
 offer advice if I can. And take it from me, you ought to be only what
 your heart wants you to be."

 "I, uh, know not what my heart wants me to be."

 "Well, what is your greatest talent?"

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Tuck thinks for a moment. "I fear I possess no talents at all."

 "Ah," says Tristain. "In that case, have you considered politics?"

 "No, I'm afraid not."

 Tristain claps his hands together. "Splendid! Once we are free of this
 place, I shall help you with your burgeoning political career. Though
 you shall need a suitable wife to begin. All successful politicians
 are married, you know." He leans into Tuck, who abruptly jumps to his
 feet and stumbles backwards.

 "Er, thank you very much, Your Highness, but, uh, I have no interest
 in finding a wife. Wait—I did not mean that you could not—I mean,
 I'm
 sure that wives are wonderful, but not for me." He takes a deep breath
 to calm his nerves. "My apologies, Your Highness. Ser Leonhart warned
 me not to reveal this to anyone, as not wanting a wife is an offence
 to the common good. I hope to have not offended you."

 Tristain looks delighted. "Offended? Young man, I'm positively
 enchanted. You have spoken no ills. Now, I shall wait here while you
 and Ser Knight sort yourselves out. He has a mission yet to complete,
 after all."

 The two say their goodbye, which takes quite a bit longer than you
 would like.

>go west


 Tuck follows you into the darkness. There is quite a bit of bumping
 into things and people, eliciting the occasional squeal from the other

 The lift stutters to life and slowly ascends before coming to a stop.
 You emerge onto the second storey balcony. On this level, you can
 follow hallways to the east or west.

>go west



 Tuck follows you down the western hallway. There is a closed door to
 the west and a bedroom to the north. A tin of pig treats lies on its
 side near a wall.

 You can see a pepper shaker here.

>take tin


 It's too large and unwieldy for you to carry.

>smell tin


 You sniff the tin of pig treats. Tuck investigates the tin, eventually
 opening it and pulling out a treat.

 "Is this what you want?" he asks. He places the treat on the ground in
 front of you. "You must be hungry."

 His stomach growls. "Golly, I'm hungry too," he says. He sniffs one of
 treats, and finding it acceptable, he takes a small bite. Then
 another.

 Before you know it, the entire tin is empty. He seems to have
 surprised himself. "Oops," he says, placing the empty tin back on the
 floor. "I hope you only need the one."

>take treat


 Taken.

>examine treat


 It smells delicious, and powerfully so. You feel like you can smell it
 all the way across the room.

>go east



 Tuck follows you to the second storey balcony. Another hallway leads
 to the east. A circular staircase reaches the balconies above and
 below, curving around the waiting lift.

>smell lift


 You sniff the lift, and after Tuck opens the door, you lead him
 inside. Next to the door on the southern wall is a horizontal row of
 buttons, labelled '3', '2', '1' and 'G' from left to right. The button
 labelled '2' is already depressed.

>smell g


 You stand on your hind legs and sniff as high as you can reach, just
 below the rightmost button. Tuck presses it. The lift stutters to
 life, slowly descending all the way to the ground.

 You emerge into the foyer. You can go north to the courtyard, south
 through the double doors to the bailey, east to the well-lit hallway
 or west to the darkened hallway.

>go west


 Tuck follows you into the darkness. There is quite a bit of bumping
 into things and people, and this time, upon emerging back into the
 foyer, you discover Ser Leonhart, Tuck and the other pig marching
 along behind you. The pig snatches the treat from your mouth and
 charges through the doggy door, out of sight.

 The knight blinks. "Two pigs? The wizard plotted to separate us this
 whole time! I was starting to wonder why my exploration of the keep
 was interspersed with long periods of doing naught in a dark hallway."

 "I was under the impression the sniffer needed to nap frequently,"
 says Tuck, yawning, "which is an appealing prospect."

 Ser Leonhart poses like he could conquer the world. "We must first
 complete our mission. There is no rest for the wicked, thus we have
 not the luxury."

>take bell


 Taken.

>smell lift


 You sniff the lift.

 "What is it?" asks Tuck, but Ser Leonhart presses a finger to his
 squire's lips.

 "The loo," replies the knight in a hushed tone.

 "Oh," says Tuck. "But why are we whispering?"

 Ser Leonhart points at the lift. "The evil wizard is inside." He
 raises his sword, counts to three on his fingers, then throws open the
 door, only to find it completely empty. The knight is dumbfounded and
 almost offended. "Why, there is naught inside at all! Ah, here it is."
 He picks up the pail in the foyer. "A good thing too. I have held this
 in since the foot of the mountain."

 Ser Leonhart places the pail in the centre of the lift, takes several
 minutes to conduct his business and then returns without the pail.
 "Now, where were we?" he asks.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you down a long hallway lined with
 portraits. Ahead to the east is the receiving room.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the receiving room. There are
 rooms to the east and south, as well a service corridor to the north.

>go north



 You lead Ser Leonhart and Tuck into the narrow service corridor
 continuing to the north. A set of servants' stairs twists around a
 wall and disappears above you.

>go up



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the first storey landing. From
 here, you can continue up to the storey above or go west to the
 hallway.

>go up



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the second storey landing. You can
 continue up to the storey above or head west to the hallway.

>go up



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the third storey landing. You can
 head west to the hallway.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you down the third storey hallway. There
 is a stone gargoyle carved into the wall to the north and a balcony to
 the west.

>smell gargoyle


 You sniff the gargoyle.

 "The wizard is disguising himself as this stone creature!" cries Ser
 Leonhart, but Tuck places himself between the knight and the gargoyle.

 "No, milord! He is a friendly gargoyle!"

 The gargoyle holds up his tiny arms, as if to say his arms lack the
 length to hurt anybody.

 "There stands a closet of potions behind him," continues Tuck. "We
 need to make use of that cord." He points at the tasselled cord
 hanging limply from the gargoyle's hand.

 "Sometimes, Tuck, I wonder what I would do without you." And before
 his squire can stop him, the knight cuts down the cord with his blade.
 He hands the thing to Tuck. "There you are. I leave it to you."

 Tuck's lower lip trembles. "I... I no longer know what to do." He
 stuffs the severed cord into his doublet.

 "Ah, worry not, my forgetful follower," says Ser Leonhart. "We shall
 find another way." He gives his squire a comforting slap on the back,
 though from the change in Tuck's expression, it failed to be
 comforting at all.

 The gargoyle, meanwhile, is none too pleased with the loss of his
 cord. He crosses his arms and glares at the three of you.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the third storey landing. You can
 take the servants' stairs to the storey below.

>go down



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the second storey landing. You can
 continue down to the storey below or go west to the hallway.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you down the hallway. There is a closed
 door to the north and a balcony to the west. A memorandum has been
 nailed to the northern door.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the second storey balcony. Another
 hallway leads to the west. A circular staircase reaches the balconies
 above and below. A call button can summon the lift.

>go west



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you down the western hallway. There is a

 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you into Tristain's bedroom, lit from a
 large window overlooking the courtyard. Beside a four-post bed with a
 princess canopy is a vanity covered in wigs, ersatz jewellery and one
 overflowing box of makeup. An open wardrobe is full of dresses and
 capes and boas and heels. On the walls are posters of boy bands,
 though the largest poster is of Zifmia the Adventurer.

 Which do you mean, the poster of 5 Seconds of Winter, the poster of
 Four Directions or the poster of Zifmia the Adventurer?

>zifmia


 There she is, as fierce as ever. She is clad all in leather, her crown
 askew and her makeup artfully smeared.

>examine winter


 It's the same picture as their iconic cover for Tumbling Rock
 magazine. The boys are naked, covering themselves with merely their
 hands, with short phrases and doodles drawn all over them. You cannot
 call yourself a fan of their music, but at least they are pleasing to
 look at.

>examine directions


 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine four


 This is a more candid picture of the boys when they were still
 together. Since the breakup, East's solo career has not been as
 successful as he (or his fans) had hoped for, though it's early yet.
 The rest of the group is trying to continue on as Three Directions,
 but the name lacks the same ring it once had.

>examine bed


 You have a similar one in your bedroom.

 You suppose Tristain must work with the tools he has. If you find a

 You shake the pepper shaker. A cloud of pepper expands and hovers
 briefly, tickling the nostrils of anyone in its vicinity.

 You sneeze (but hold onto the shaker). Ser Leonhart sneezes. Tuck
 sneezes. The gargoyle sneezes, and he spits out a bottle of counter
 potion, which Ser Leonhart deftly plucks from the air.

 "A pink potion! This must be what the princess is looking for," says
 the knight, and he adds the potion to the collection of items on his
 belt.

 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to what remains of the foyer of the
 inner keep. To the north is a courtyard, to the west is a darkened
 hallway and to the south are the closed double doors to the bailey.
 Without a functioning staircase, only a lift remains to provide access
 to the balconies above. Tristain sits atop one of his suitcases,
 looking rather bored.

 "Your Highness, I have the potion," says Ser Leonhart. When he pulls
 the potion from his belt, the flyer falls onto the floor.

 Tristain picks it up and looks it over. His cheery expression lasts
 not long. "Ten million doubloons! He said the wedding was in my best
 interest, but... he is marrying me off for the money."

 "The royal dowry has long been a tradition for finding the next king
 when there are no male heirs," says Ser Leonhart. "Certainly Your
 Highness would know the law."

 "Yes... of course." Tristain smooths out the flyer with his fingers.
 "I am sorry. I shall be in my room." He gathers his gown and rushes
 down the hallway to the east.

 genders.

>go north


 You lead the knight and his squire into the young master's bedroom.
 Tristain is seated on the edge of his bed, bent low over the wrinkled
 flyer in one hand and the memo torn from his door in the other. A few
 tears fall onto the papers.

 "Your Highness... are you unwell?" asks Ser Leonhart.

 Tristain wipes his eyes, smearing mascara across his cheek. "You know,
 you try not to think badly of a parent. You might pray they are
 confused, or stubborn, or will come around. Or you might run away for
 a little while to create some distance, and hope that upon your return
 they will listen to you in earnest. But realising your parent may
 simply not be a good person... I know not how to describe the feeling.
 I suppose it was obvious in hindsight, especially with how often we
 fought, but the pill is bitter and difficult to swallow. Not to
 mention, the poor girl." He looks up. "I swear, I knew naught of his
 plan to drug her with love potion. I overheard him saying she managed
 an escape after stealing an invisibility potion, but I cannot remember
 the potion I switched it with. I can only pray it aided in her
 escape."

 "I'm afraid I have not the slightest idea what you are talking about,"
 says Ser Leonhart, and Tristain rises to his feet.

 "No, I suppose not. My father made his choices, and choices have
 consequences. The door to the workshop will be sealed with a hex, but
 I can find the counter spell for you. Meet me in the library when you
 can." He hurries away to the south.

>go south



 You return to the eastern hallway, which runs from the balcony to the
 west to the stairwell to the east. Ser Leonhart and Tuck remain close
 behind.

>go east



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the second storey landing. You can

 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you to the first storey landing. From

>go west



 Ser Leonhart and Tuck follow you down the first storey hallway. There
 is a library to the north and a balcony to the west.

>go north

 You find Tristain in the library poring over old books. He calls Ser
 Leonhart and Tuck over to him.

 "I have found it! You must say 'Open or I shall use you for firewood,'
 and the door to the tower will open. I realise it is not the best way
 to secure a location, but witchcraft has its flaws."

 "I think you mean wizardry," says Ser Leonhart.

 "No, I mean witchcraft."

 Tuck has been having his own thoughts on the matter. He holds up a
 finger. "Milord, I have noticed the wizard is rather reliant on
 potions and, well, judging from what has been seen and heard so far, I
 think the wizard is not a wizard. I think the wizard is a witch."

 Ser Leonhart blinks. "You mean, we seek the Evil Witch Queklain?
 But... he is a man." Slowly, the knight drags himself to a conclusion,
 and his lips begin to tremble. He claps a hand over his mouth, but it
 does no good, for he soon doubles over in laughter. "Queklain, a
 witch! How ridiculous! Is he going to chase us on a broomstick? Does
 he wear a pointy hat?"

 "I believe wizards also wear pointy hats..." says Tuck, unsure of the
 purpose of his master's insults.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>Tristain, unable to restrain
 himself, marches over to the knight and slaps him across the face.
 "Your tongue is in need of discipline. There may be plenty of reasons
 to disparage him, but a feminine profession is not one of them."

 "But Your Highness..." says the knight.

 "Oh, for the gods' sakes, I'm not the princess. I'm Tristain, son of
 Queklain." Tristain pulls off his wig to reveal a head of greasy,
 short black hair. "Do what you came here to do, before I change my
 mind and warn my father of your presence."

 After a moment of stunned silence, Ser Leonhart draws his sword. "I
 understand now. You are also a witch, and you used your dark powers to
 bewitch me into believing you were the princess."

 Tristain raises his hands in surrender. "That was not the way of it. I
 merely—"

 "Enough! Tell me, where is the princess? Where are you keeping her?"

 "She is not in my care. I know not where she is," says Tristain. He
 backs slowly into a bookshelf.

 With fists clenched tightly by his side, Tuck steps in front of the
 knight's raised sword. He lifts his head high. "Let him be," he says.
 "H-he has wronged neither of us."

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Ser Leonhart halts before his squire. "Tuck? Have you taken leave of
 your senses?"

 "I-I no longer know what is sense, milord. All this time, I followed
 your lead as it is what squires do. But at once it occurred to me, how
 would I know if what you say is right? Because this feels far from
 right. I think... I shall be thinking more for myself from now on."

 "Your journey to knighthood, nay, to manhood is only beginning," says
 Ser Leonhart. He finds a pose demonstrating the most confidence. "A
 hero always does what is right. And that whoreson over there—" he
 points accusingly at Tristain "—is deceitful in words and in dress,
 and his wickedness has cost the true princess valuable time. Justice
 must be served."

 "Yes, he spoke falsehoods, but should we open our ears and listen, we
 may find reason in them. We must not pass judgement so quickly," Tuck
 pleads.

 The knight's eyes soften, and for a moment, you can see the classic
 struggle between empathy and belief within them. Alas, belief, for
 those who possess it, is known for being the stronger of the two. Ser
 Leonhart shakes his head to throw the obtrusive thoughts away. "Your
 words are a gentle breeze, unable to bring down the sturdy stone wall
 of tradition. It is with a heavy heart that I release you from my
 service and brand you a traitor to the crown. Prepare yourself!"

 He at once lunges at his former squire, who narrowly avoids the blade
 and ducks under the table. The sword lodges itself in the wood, and
 placing one foot against the side of the table, Ser Leonhart removes
 the weapon.

 Tuck, meanwhile, scrambles out the opposite side. Firmly practised in
 the art of retreat, he runs around the table in circles, and Ser
 Leonhart gives chase.

>go south



 You return to the first storey hallway, which runs from the balcony to
 the west to the stairwell to the east.

>go north



 You head into an expansive library lit by an open window. On the
 southern wall beside the sole entrance hangs a great tapestry. The
 remaining walls are lined with shelves upon shelves of books. Tuck is
 doing his best to escape the Ser Leonhart's blade. Tristain watches,
 gripped by fear and unsure of what to do.

>shake bell

 You ring the bell, and a murder of crows descends through the open
 window. They attack Ser Leonhart and his shiny platemail, distracting
 him long enough for Tuck to throw himself at the knight's legs. They
 both somersault to the ground.

 Left alone by the crows, Tristain presses the pointed end of one of
 his heels against the knight's neck. "Drop your sword," he commands.

 Ser Leonhart's lips tighten, but he does as he is told. Tuck grabs the
 sword and takes a few steps backwards, pulling Tristain with him. They
 watch the knight carefully as he returns to his feet and chases the
 crows away with flailing arms.

 "Give me back my sword," says Ser Leonhart once the last of the crows
 has fled. "You are untrained and more apt to hurt yourself than I."

 "Promise you will leave us in peace," says Tuck. "Your quarrel is with
 Queklain, and you are indebted to me for all of those times I saved
 you from death." You are not sure where the steady and confident voice
 came from, but you are glad Tuck discovered it when he did.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Ser Leonhart considers his former squire's words. "Very well. Return
 my sword to me, and I swear on my honour and the wrath of the gods
 that I shall harm neither you nor the witch's child this foul day."

 Tristain puts a cautionary hand on the sword, but Tuck nods at him as
 if to say the knight is a man of his word. He clumsily tosses the
 sword at the knight's feet.

 "Goodbye, my defiant defector," says Ser Leonhart, "for I am off to
 slay the wizard—I mean witch. May the gods have mercy on your soul."
 Without another word, the knight retrieves his sword and departs to
 the south.

 Tuck spins round. "Are you unharmed?"

 Tristain immediately throws his arms around Tuck and plants a kiss on
 his lips, but when Tuck pulls away, the young lord covers his face
 with his hands in shame. "My apologies! I... I misread the situation.
 I only hoped to show you gratitude for saving my life, and you had
 said earlier that—oh, never mind. I truly am sorry."

 Tuck shakes his head to put the other at ease. "Please, fret not over
 this," he says, then he lowers his voice. "Sometimes I worry Cupido
 sings not for me. But..." He gathers his courage, the courage of a
 different sort than when facing an enemy on a battlefield. He holds
 out his hand. "Let us first be friends, if you would have me."

 "Of course!" cries Tristain. His eyes shine as he grips the other's
 hand. "A friend! Yes, as a matter of fact, I would like that very
 much." He pauses. "And how does one go about being your friend?"

 "Well," says Tuck, "I believe we ought to start by learning about one
 another."

 Coming to an agreement on the best way to proceed, they find a seat by
 the window and do precisely that.

>drop bell


 Dropped.

 You return to the first storey hallway, which runs from the balcony to
 the west to the stairwell to the east.

 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>go north



 You proceed into an expansive library lit by an open window. On the
 southern wall beside the sole entrance hangs a great tapestry. The
 remaining walls are lined with shelves upon shelves of books. Tristain
 and Tuck are engaged in conversation by the window.

 You can see a handbell here.

>go west



 You proceed down the third storey hallway. There is a stone gargoyle
 carved into the wall to the north and a balcony to the west.

 You can see a pepper shaker here.

>go west



 You leave the hallway and head onto the third storey balcony. Ahead of
 you rises a spiral staircase to the keep's highest tower. The main
 staircase descends to the balcony below. A call button can summon the
 lift.

>go west



 You head up the stairs to the top of the spiral staircase. To the
 north is an open door into the tower.

>go north


 You slip into Queklain's workshop within the keep's highest tower.
 Light seeps in through narrow slitted windows, spreading thin
 rectangles of light across the rough stone floor. On the far side of
 the room, a cauldron bubbles between shelves of ingredients, bottled
 potions and one particularly ratty broomstick.

 There, beside the cauldron, stands the evil witch himself. Robbit
 peers out from behind the witch's robes. In the centre of the room,
 Ser Leonhart is poised to attack.

 "Evil One!" shouts the knight. "My name is Ser Leonhart. Remember it
 well, for it is a name that will live on for centuries in the stories
 that tell of your demise. Step away from the cauldron, for we shall
 duel man to man."

 Queklain lets out a booming laugh. He reaches up and takes a bottle of
 potion off the shelf. "Are you here to challenge me? The great and
 powerful wizard Queklain? I accept your duel, but rather than fight
 man against man, might we try something a little more fun? Such as man
 against dragon..."

 He trails off as he remembers something. "Shoot. Which potion was
 switched with the dragon potion again?" He searches the shelf for a
 different bottle, but unable to find it, he turns back to the knight.
 "We shall duel, Ser Whatever, but you must give me a few minutes, and
 also a strand of your hair."

 Ser Leonhart raises his shield. "I will not fall prey to your tricks.
 Prepare to meet the heavy fist of justice!"

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 As the knight readies his charge, Heroes 1 through 5 burst into the
 tower, each soaking wet and holding a random household object as a
 weapon (except for Hero 1, who still has his guitar). They shout
 things like "I'm here to rescue the princess!" and "No, <span class="floydstyle em">I'm</span>
 here to rescue the princess!" and "Oh look, I see Georgie! Hi
 Georgie!" and "Apologies we did not realise the cell door was open
 sooner!" Spotting Queklain, they close in for the attack. "Look, the
 evil wizard! We shall finish him!"

 As if things had not become confusing enough, an ogre chooses that
 moment to barge into the tower, carrying the goblin engineer over his
 shoulder. He is followed by a sweaty cyclops and a salty medusa.

 "Measter, we dinna fin the princess, but lek who a' fin runnin' awee!
 She sed some 'eroes burna the keep and—" Upon seeing the collection
 of
 heroes in front of him, the ogre stops mid-sentence and throws Rhoda
 to the ground. "Argh! I 'ate 'eroes!" The monsters pull out their
 weapons.

 For the briefest of moments, the room is still. Then, the floodgates
 open. Punches are thrown. Weapons clash. Circles are run. Cries for
 help are lost in the shouting and the noise. The cauldron is tipped
 over, spilling the half-brewed love potion all over the stone floor.
 Shelves come crashing down, smashing bottles of potion left and right.
 Somehow, the door is closed. The fates seem to enjoy spitting on you.

 Then again, perhaps not. You watch six bottles of blue potion, still
 intact, skitter across the floor and come to a stop in front of you.
 They are labelled Dragon, Clown, Ribbons, Elf, Flea and Pig. A seventh
 bottle, a pink counter potion, slides next to the other six, having
 freed itself from Ser Leonhart's belt in the chaos.

 You consider your options.

>drink pink

 You remove the cork with your teeth and take a sip from the bottle.
 You are surrounded by a puff of smoke, and when it clears, you have
 returned to human form.

 "Finally," you blurt out in relief, but not so loudly as to draw
 attention to yourself. Fortunately, the heroes and monsters in the
 tower are too distracted by the brawl to notice.

 "Finally is right!" shouts a flea, and the two of them leap off your
 face into the open bottle of counter potion. There appears another
 puff of smoke, and you discover two gnomes in blue coats and pointy
 red hats standing in front of you.

 "Many thanks for your assistance," says one gnome.

 "Yes, thank you," says the other. And with that, they both run into
 the fray, immediately offering conflicting advice to the first hero
 they meet.

 As quietly as you can, you open the door and slip out onto the tower
 stairs (grabbing the remaining counter potion on the way, for Scruffle
 Wuffles).

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>You detour into Tristain's room
 to borrow one of his more understated dresses (a rare find, to be
 sure), then proceed on to the library. Tuck and Tristain are resting
 beneath the open window.

 "Ahem." Even the slightest noise startles the boys out of their close
 conversation.

 "Who are you?" asks Tuck.

 Tristain (who had visited you during your previous capture and
 promised to help you escape) needs not ask. He springs to his feet and
 envelops you in a hug, warm and genuine in a way you are not used to.
 You return the kind gesture.

 "I'm so glad you are well! Oh, how I feared for your safety," says
 Tristain once he separates. "And for the record, you wear that dress
 better than I ever could."

 "Nonsense. You have the body for it," you reply.

 "Flattery will gain you everything," says Tristain, fanning himself.

 You smile. "We should be going. Neither of you will want to be here
 when Corporation Incorporated arrives with their army."

 "The debt collectors? Oh gods, our situation really is worse than
 father let on. If only..." His eyes are misty again. "No, it's best we
 parted ways."

 You take his hand in yours. "Let him worry you no more," you say. "He
 would never let your future be your own. It seems we have this much in
 common. In any event, I happen to be quill-friends with someone named
 Zifmia the Adventurer. You might know of her, and I hear she is always
 on the hunt for new talent."

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Press any key to continue.]</span>
 Tristain's face shines like the sun. He turns proudly to Tuck. "Ah,
 allow me to introduce the real Princess Joy."

 Tuck leaps to one knee, but you shake your head and help him rise to
 his feet. "I hear Princess Joy died tragically somewhere on the
 mountain," you say. "A shame the king no longer has anyone to marry
 off. Mayhap all those screaming for democracy can finally have their
 way. In the meantime, I shall have to come up with a new name."

 "Oh, but that is the fun part," says Tristain. He clears his throat.
 "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Miss Ima Runaway!"

 You giggle. "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Miss
 Tilda Swineton!" Tristain's eyes widen as he realizes the meaning
 behind your pun, and you discreetly put a finger to your lips.

 "Golly," says Tuck. "Hmmm... Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to
 the stage, Miss Notta Princess!"

 Tristain blinks. "That was... a decent first attempt," he lies. Tuck
 shoves the other in a playful manner, and in no time they are
 wrestling.

 You give them their space and move to the window. The sky has cleared,
 and the sun dips into the west. Traces of pink and purple radiate from
 behind the keep's outer curtain. You spent a lifetime staring at
 sunsets over castle walls, but after tonight, walls hold you no
 longer. Somewhere out there, the world waits to embrace you, and for
 the first time in your life, you think of the future and smile.

 first command as leader is lost as the cyclops lands on top of him.

 Flying is initially difficult, but you eventually manage to paddle
 your way back to the floor where the potions are waiting.

>drink elf


 You remove the cork with your teeth and take a sip from the bottle.
 The world seems to slow around you. You feel as though your actions
 would proceed much more quickly.

>drink flea


 (the Flea potion)
 You remove the cork with your teeth and take a sip from the bottle. A
 wave of honesty passes over you. If you were asked a question, you
 could not avoid telling the truth (though as an ordinary pig, nobody
 would understand you).

>drink pig


 (the Pig potion)
 You remove the cork with your teeth and take a sip from the bottle.
 Your body fades from view.

>drink pink


 You remove the cork with your teeth and take a sip from the bottle.
 Your invisibility leaves you.

>again


 You take a sip from the bottle. You feel as though you can lie again.

>again


 You take a sip from the bottle. The world speeds up around you.

>again


 You take a sip from the bottle. Gravity pulls you back to the floor as
 you lose your ability to fly.

>again


 You take a sip from the bottle. Your heightened sense of smell fades
 away.

>again

 You take a sip from the bottle. You are surrounded by a puff of smoke,
 and when it clears, you have returned to human form.

 "Finally," you blurt out in relief, but not so loudly as to draw
 attention to yourself. Fortunately, the heroes and monsters in the
 tower are too distracted by the brawl to notice.

 "Finally is right!" shouts a flea, and the two of them leap off your
 face into the open bottle of counter potion. There appears another
 puff of smoke, and you discover two gnomes in blue coats and pointy
 red hats standing in front of you.

 "Many thanks for your assistance," says one gnome.

 "Yes, thank you," says the other. And with that, they both run into
 the fray, immediately offering conflicting advice to the first hero
 they meet.

 As quietly as you can, you open the door and slip out onto the tower
 stairs (grabbing the remaining counter potion on the way, for Scruffle
 Wuffles).
