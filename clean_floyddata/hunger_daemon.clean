 The thing of it is, he's drawing out every single goddamned syllable.
 That "wgah'n" -- that took eleven seconds.  If he were just reading it
 straight, we'd have been out of here in forty-five minutes, and you'd
 have the rest of your day back.  But instead, he's doing all these
 vibratos and ululations, going over the same phrase over and over.

 There's a pause in the chanting.  Suddenly, you hear a baleful
 gurgling, almost a roar, coming from deep below.  It's your stomach.
 You missed breakfast, and now you're missing lunch, too.  Azathoth's
 ample arse!  How long is this ceremony going to take?

 <span class="floydstyle header">Hunger Daemon</span>
 The Travails of a Cafeteria Cultist by Sean M. Shore
 Release 3 / Serial number 141014 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Restaurant Basement</span>
 You're in the basement of a defunct little bistro in the West 7th
 neighborhood of Saint Paul.  This is where your cult does most of its
 culting, on account of how your Aunt Sandy doesn't want any sacrifices
 in the house, and well, fair enough.  Uncle Stu owns the building, so
 you're not squatting or anything, but he's kept the place in a state
 of perpetual Coming Soonedness, so that you all can do your thing here
 with no interference.

 As I say, <span class="floydstyle em">defunct</span> bistro, so the restaurant-type stuff you'd
 normally find here is mostly gone.  In their place there's a group of
 guys wearing hooded robes, facing an altar at one end of the chamber.
 Your Uncle Stu has a lectern in front of him, atop which is a decrepit
 leather-bound book from which he is chanting.  There's a wooden stair
 leading to the pantry above and a winged horror slumped in a folding
 chair in the corner.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Hunger Daemon</span> is an entry in the 2014 Interactive Fiction
 Competition.  There are a couple of short timed sequences where it is
 possible to lock yourself out of victory for a move or two, but it
 will be very obvious when this happens, because the game will end.
 Outside of that, the various "winning" endings should always be
 available.

 To initiate a conversation with a character, you can TALK TO the
 character, or SAY HELLO TO her, or ASK her ABOUT or TELL her ABOUT
 something.  Use TOPICS to display conversation topics.  Occasionally a
 character might respond to something not in her topics list.

 You can use GO TO to return to places you've already been.   There are
 also a few other nonstandard verbs.  I hope that they're obvious in
 context.  Note: you might find yourself needing to INFLATE or SQUEEZE
 or REMEMBER some things.

 Thanks to Graham Nelson and Emily Short for Inform 7, and to Eric Eve,
 David Fisher and Wade Clarke for very helpful extensions.  All praise
 to my testers: Sam Kabo Ashwell, Neil Butters, Bob Reeves, Gr√°inne

 You're Barry, just a regular guy in the service of the Great Old Ones.
 OK, "in the service of" might be a little strong.  You haven't done
 much serving of late.  You only show up for the high holidays and
 important rituals if you can help it.

>examine horror


 It's a creature summoned from beyond the stars, beyond the depths of
 madness, to serve your uncle.  It can scarcely even be described.  To
 truly look upon it, to apprehend its features fully, would fracture
 one's mind.

 That said, it's a tall, lumpy, yellowish humanoid guy with black eyes
 and some tendrils around the mouth.  It's just sitting there on the
 chair.

 The winged horror doesn't seem like he's up for a lot of interaction

 or meditating, or just bored, but he hasn't moved much in the last
 couple of days.

>examine uncle


 He's the leader of your little group.  He got into the cult thing when
 he was off doing fieldwork in Paraguay for grad school, and unearthed
 this great big book -- the one he's chanting from on the lectern.
 He's been converting friends and family to his new religion ever
 since.  Tonight's a big night for him: after this ritual, he'll be
 ready to eat the Heart of, um, Something? -- it starts with a U --
 which will turn him into a Vessel for an Old One, whatever that means.
 That is, if we can ever get the chanting out of the way.

 <span class="floydstyle em">...goka hupadgh, h'chtenff nog hlirgh athg s'uhn 'bthnk</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">nathrod...</span>

 It's your basic wooden lectern.  Your uncle probably swiped it from
 the Catholic school across the street.

 <span class="floydstyle em">...nnnvulgtm uln geb, fm'latgh athg vulgtm 'fhalma y'hah</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">h'fhalma...</span>

>examine book


 It's the book that got your uncle started many years ago, when he came
 across it in a dig in Paraguay.  It's at least a thousand pages long.
 A lot of the pages seem to have been inserted after the fact.  You
 haven't spent a lot of time handling it, but when you have, the
 reddish leather on the cover has flaked off and stuck to your fingers.
 There's no title on it, and it's written in an ancient language that
 you still can't read, despite your uncle's best efforts.

 You lean over to have a peek at the section that Stu is reading from.
 Dagon's dingus!  He's still on page 13!  We're going to be here all
 day.  Maybe you can slip out discreetly and get your lunch from the
 fridge upstairs.

 Instead of xyzzying when current game is Hunger Daemon:
         try playing Adventure;
         now the joke is out of the way.

>examine altar


 It's actually a coffee table with a granite top, the biggest one that
 would fit down the stairs to get here.  It is pretty heavy, and it's
 got some eldritch runes that were carved on its surface with a power
 drill.  Tonight, supposedly, there will be a sacrifice lashed to it as
 well.  Like your uncle says, you can't make an
 appeasing-the-Great-Old-Ones omelet without breaking a few
 blood-of-the-innocents eggs.

 <span class="floydstyle em">...cphlegeth shogg nnnphlegeth ftaghu shagg stell'bsnanyth</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">ehye...</span>

>go up


 You tiptoe over to the stairs as gingerly as you can.  Some of the
 other cultists give you a look of mild disapproval, leavened with
 jealousy at your having the courage to slip out first.  No one says
 anything, though, and your uncle continues his chanting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pantry</span>
 This is where all the food would be stored, if the bistro were open
 and functioning.  There's a big fridge in the corner and many dusty
 shelves along the walls.  A wooden stair leads down to the basement,
 and a doorway leads north to the kitchen.

 On the dusty shelves are some pizza boxes and some cans of near-food.

>examine pizza


 They're from Papa Dimitri's on Hamline, from yesterday.  They still
 smell faintly of pizza, which isn't helping you curb your hunger right
 now, even if the pizza wasn't all that great.  The boxes are closed.

>open pizza


 Alas, all that remains are some greasy sheets of wax paper.

>lick wax paper


 Greedily you begin licking the day-old grease off the wax paper.
 Remembering that you are a human being, you stop.

>examine cans


 You turn them to read the labels and wipe away some dust.  They're
 food, I guess, but none of them can be eaten individually, or in
 combination.  There's coconut milk, a can of chipotles in adobo,
 horseradish, a bottle of fish sauce, and sundry other substances which
 might be described as food-adjacent.  None of them will address your
 hunger.

>open fridge


 You open the fridge, revealing an unexpectedly empty Ziploc bag.  The
 bag has the word "Barry" written on it with a black Sharpie, for all
 the good that did you.  It used to enclose a sandwich.  The sandwich
 is now presumably enclosed by Walter, who is the only one who's been
 up here.  Where is that clown?

>open can


 You don't have a can opener, but more to the point, you have no reason
 to open them.  It might come to that eventually, but for now, you can
 withstand the siren call of the horseradish.

>take bag


 Taken.

>close fridge


 You close the fridge.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pantry</span>
 This is where all the food would be stored, if the bistro were open
 and functioning.  There's a big fridge in the corner and many dusty
 shelves along the walls.  A wooden stair leads down to the basement,
 and a doorway leads north to the kitchen.

 On the dusty shelves are some pizza boxes (in which are some greasy
 sheets of wax paper) and some cans of near-food.

>take paper


 You take the sheets of wax paper.  They're still quite slick and
 slippery.

>take cans


 Taken.

>take all


 pizza boxes: They're a bit bulky to port around, and you have no real
 use for them.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 This is the bistro's cramped kitchen.  With your eye for detail, you
 notice a couple of things subtly out of place.  For one thing, Walter
 is laid out on the floor.  Also, the Ark of, um, Whatever, which he
 was guarding, is open and empty.  The oven appears to be intact, for
 what that's worth, which is probably very little.

 The door to the restaurant's office leads west, the pantry is to the
 south, and the dining room is to the north.

>kick walter


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine walter


 He's a big dude -- a monster, really -- and a friend of your uncle's.
 He's supposed to be keeping watch.  Instead, he's sprawled out on the
 floor, face down, sleeping peacefully.  There's a faint chemical whiff
 coming off him, as opposed to the usual aquavit.  You're not a
 physician per se -- a second-year vet student, actually -- but as far
 as you can tell, he's not dying or anything, just knocked out.

>examine ark

 The Ark of Whatever -- Mythos names give you a headache -- is a large,
 ornate box, covered in raised pictograms in some ancient tongue.  It's
 clearly very old, and somewhat alien-looking, and too big to schlep
 downstairs.  It contains the great Heart of Something or other, the
 crucial object needed for your uncle's transformation ritual that
 takes place tomorrow.  Or it did: the ark is open and empty.

 You run your finger over the raised pictograms, wondering how the hell
 this could have happened.  In order to even open the box, you'd need
 to have the combination, and press the symbols in the right --.  Oh,
 Jesus.  THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

 <span class="floydstyle em">press any key</span>
 It's a hot, sweaty day at the state fair.  You're here along with
 perhaps a hundred thousand of your fellow Minnesotans, having spent
 the day gawking at the prize rabbits, admiring the butter sculptures
 of the dairy princesses, checking out the reliably liberal crop art,
 and consuming 4000 calories, much of it in the form of soybean oil.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A Month Ago at the State Fair, On Line for Bacon on a Stick</span>
 You're at the head of the line at the Fat Bacon stand, ready for your
 opportunity to give $5 in exchange for a piece of bacon on a stick.
 This is what your day has been missing.

 Some teenagers are manning the booth.

>eat teenagers


 It might come to that.  Great Cthulhu, you are famished.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a five-dollar bill
   an all-important note that explains how to open the Ark of Gl'thub

>examine note


 It's the folded-up piece of paper on which is written the exact
 sequence of pictograms one presses to open the Ark of Gl'thub.  It is
 not the only copy, thankfully.

 You hear someone muttering "Move it, dude," somewhere behind you.

>move it


 Nothing obvious happens.

 The teens give you a look as if to say, Are you going to buy anything?

>buy bacon

 You reach into your pocket, pull out the money, and hand it over to
 the girl.  She hands you your bacon on a stick.  It's not all that
 great.  Meanwhile:

 the all-important note that explains how to open the Ark of Gl'thub:
 <span class="floydstyle i">Dropped.</span>

 At least, this is your best guess as to what happened, since the money
 and the note were in the same pocket.  But more to the point, who
 would even have picked it up, with all the garbage floating around the
 state fair?  Who would have noticed it?  There's no way that anyone
 could make sense of it.  It's just scribbles on a piece of paper.  No
 big deal.  Stu has another copy, so we're all good.

 <span class="floydstyle em">press any key</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">press any key</span>

 OK, maybe not.  Crap.  You need to make this right, like right now.
 Stu is going to eat you alive if he finds out that the Heart is gone,
 and that is literally.  Oh man, oh man.  Where to even start?  Jeff!
 Jeff will know what to do.  Better get over to the bookstore pronto,
 before Stu figures out what's happened.

 This is a small professional kitchen.  Although the pots and pans and
 smaller appliances are all gone, the oven is still functional, as long
 as your uncle keeps paying the gas bill.  Also here, not part of the
 original decor, is the Ark of Whatever.

 The door to the restaurant's office leads west, the pantry is to the
 south, and the dining room is to the north.

 Walter is here, unconscious.

>lick walter


 It might come to that.  Great Cthulhu, you are famished.

>put walter in oven


 You briefly consider incinerating Walter as payment for stealing your
 sandwich.  You decide that this might be disproportionate to the
 crime.

>open oven


 You open the oven.  Perhaps there's a turkey roasting inside?  That
 would be very helpful right now.  Yeah, not so much.  It's scrubbed
 clean and empty.

>enter oven


 Suicide sounds like a pretty good alternative to whatever Stu might do
 to you, but perhaps there's still another way.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The old bistro had ten tables and seated about forty.  The chairs are
 propped up on the tables upside-down and covered in dust.  Large
 windows look out onto the street, but they're soaped up so that the
 public can't see all the important renovation work going on in here,
 which is to say none.  The kitchen is to the south, the bathroom is to
 the west, and you can walk out onto the street to the north.

 Hanging from the ceiling is a funky, thrift-store-looking chandelier.

>examine chandelier


 It's been painted white, which transforms it from "schlock" into
 "shabby chic."

 As you look at the chandelier, your eye is drawn to a security camera,
 facing toward the front door and bathroom.  A tiny red light on the
 camera is illuminated.  A wire leads from the camera along the ceiling
 to the south, towards the kitchen.

>examine camera


 A small security camera.  It appears to be functioning even now.

>examine wire


 A thin, black cable artfully and unobtrusively mounted on the wall.
 It connects to the security camera and leads south towards the
 kitchen.

>wave at camera


 You can't see any such thing.

>follow wire


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>take camera


 You can't reach it.  Well, you could, if you started stacking tables
 and chairs, but frankly, the camera itself is not too interesting.
 Perhaps it recorded something of interest, though?

 Walter is here, unconscious.

 You can't reach it.  Well, you could if you started stacking tables

 It's a tiny hole drilled in the wall near the ceiling, to allow the

 (the office door)
 It's a heavy, unmarked wood-veneer door, with an outsized old-timey
 lock with prominent keyhole.  Uncle Stu presumably has the key, which
 is not very helpful at the moment.

>look through keyhole


 It's certainly big, but you can't see all the way through on account
 of the tumblers or whatever they're called.

 That's not going to be a productive use of your time.

 There's a frosted window on the west wall, currently wide open.

 Strangely, there's a filthy pillow on the floor underneath the window.

 This damp, quiet alley runs along the west side of the restaurant.

 back to the northeast.

 A window leads back east into the building.  Parked right alongside,
 in a little spot reserved for employees, is your Saturn.

>in


 You're about to get in when you notice that the car has been messed
 with.  There are muddy footprints on it, for one thing.  And the trunk
 seems to be ajar.  You definitely didn't drive up here with it open.
 Someone must have broken the lock on -- no, wait.   There's no sign of
 forced entry.  Whoever it was simply opened the trunk from the inside
 of the car, which you failed to lock.  Awesome.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 With all the guys spending a lot of time in the restaurant, this tends
 to get used a fair bit.  It has the usual accoutrements: toilet, sink,

 There's a frosted window on the west wall, currently wide open.

 Strangely, there's a filthy pillow on the floor underneath the window.

 It's a regular pillow that has had a rough time lately, it seems.
 It's yellowed from sweat, has black dirt all over it, and smells of

>examine footprints


 Someone with smallish feet was clearly standing on your car.  The mud
 itself is a very dark, almost black, gritty clay.  It reminds you of
 the mud you tracked on your aunt's kitchen floor after you guys were
 all in Carver's Cave last week.  This may not be a coincidence.

>examine clay


 Which do you mean, the muddy footprints or the black dirt?

>examine dirt


 It's a black, gritty clay.  Seems recently applied.

>examine trunk


 It's larger than it looks from the outside, one of the few aspects of
 the car that provides a pleasant surprise.  It's open.

 In the trunk are a flashlight and some Breaking Bad DVDs.

 Not inside the trunk is your tire iron.  It appears to have been
 stolen.

>examine flashlight


 It's not battery-powered; it's the sort you have to crank to generate
 a charge.  In addition to being a little greener, it also means that
 it pretty much always works with a little effort.

 The flashlight is currently switched off.

>examine dvds


 They're Sam's, not yours, but you're in no mood to return them anytime
 soon.  These are the very cool limited edition set, with the case
 shaped like a tank of methylamine.  Thankfully the thief has left
 them.

>examine car


 It's a 2001 Saturn sedan.  The color, as represented to you by the

 <span class="floydstyle i">Randolph Avenue</span> (in the Saturn)
 You're on Randolph Avenue, which stretches far to the west toward
 Highland Park and to the east towards the river.  The part we're on
 here is firmly middle class, maybe on the low side.  There are a lot
 of small close-set houses with minimally-tended lawns, pockmarked by
 the occasional commercial space, including your restaurant.

 Your cult's shop, Unspeakable Books and Gifts, is located a few miles
 to the west.  Jeff should be there; you should head over, ASAP.
 Carver's Cave is to the northeast.  That's where you guys originally
 obtained the Heart, and is probably worth checking out.  There's also
 an alleyway to the southwest.  The dining room is to the south.

>go west


 You drive off towards Highland Park for a couple of miles.  You arrive
 at your destination a few minutes later.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Cleveland Avenue</span> (in the Saturn)
 You're on Cleveland Avenue outside a magic shop affiliated with your
 cult, wedged between an insurance agent and a Subway.  A faded sign
 above the nondescript entrance to the north reads "Unspeakable Books
 and Gifts."  A placard indicates that the shop is closed, but you can
 see that the lights are on.  The bistro and Randolph Avenue are back
 to the east.

 Standing out front is a sandwich board advertising an improbable and
 already completed Back to School sale.  Or I should say, "B4ck to Scho
 l."

 A mostly-deflated red balloon hangs limply from the sandwich board.

>examine balloon


 It's a plain red balloon.  It's currently deflated.

>inflate balloon


 (first taking the balloon)
 You can't reach it from inside the car.

>exit


 You get out of the Saturn.  (Incidentally, you don't need to worry
 about closing or locking or unlocking the car.  Just enter and exit.
 The locking and unlocking will be assumed.  No one else will mess with
 your car, I promise).

>inflate balloon


 (first taking the balloon)
 You inflate the balloon, carefully holding it closed with your fingers
 when you're done.

>drop balloon


 You let go of the inflated balloon.  It shoots around erratically
 before dropping to the ground.

 That would be an extremely awkward thing for you to lug around, for
 zero payoff.

>enter subway


 You're hungry, yes, but stay on target.

>enter shop



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Unspeakable Books and Gifts</span>
 You find the shop unlocked, strangely enough.

 This is the front room of Unspeakable Books and Gifts.  It's a "magic"
 shop for the pinks, the rubes who spell magick with a k.  They come
 here to buy healing crystals and novelty Buffy-themed Tarot decks and
 books about UFOs and accessing their past lives.  There's a long
 display case filled with various mystical knickknacks.  There's also a
 large bookshelf crammed with hokey New Age titles.  You can exit back
 onto the street to the south.

>examine case


 Lying on the ground behind the display case, bathed in a strange
 yellow light, is your friend Jeff.  He's apparently frozen in place.
 You half-expect him to suddenly spring to life like one of those
 annoying street performers, but it doesn't look like that will happen.
 Frozen Jeff is holding a partially open box, emerging from which is an
 enormous, otherworldly, terrifying-looking beetle, also motionless.
 Next to the two of them is a small ceramic oval.  It seems to be the
 source of the strange yellow light, which also envelops an old
 computer monitor that's stashed back here for some reason.  I have to
 say, this doesn't make for a welcoming retail environment.  As for the
 case itself, it's just a typical display counter, filled with
 knickknacks.

>examine knickknacks


 Pendants, crystals, amulets, "healing" magnets, and all manner of
 other crap.  High profit margins, you're told.

>take all


 clunky old computer monitor: You reach for the monitor, but receive a
 mild electric shock when you come in contact with the yellow light.
 strange yellow light: You tentatively touch the yellow field.  You
 feel a zap, a little stronger than a static electricity zap.  Nothing
 dramatic seems to have happened, but it's definitely not letting you
 through.
 small oval: It is either extremely heavy, or else it's somehow
 magically bonded in place.  Probably the latter.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Secrets of the Mayan Pyramids</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">Gaia Moon Menstrual Life</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Force Power</span>.  More importantly, though, it's a secret door.
 Well, not secret from you.  You can open it by pulling the Mi-go
 bookend.  It's currently closed.

>examine jeff


 He's on the ground and seems to be frozen, mid-action, in some sort of
 energy field.  The action, near as you can tell, is to release some
 sort of enormous beetle from a rune-covered box.

>examine beetle


 It is huge, terrifying and probably deadly, covered in eyes and
 sporting oversized vicious mandibles.  The box in which it was stored
 reads "Qua'ox" in tiny copper letters.

>examine oval


 It's a smooth little oval-shaped object, about the size of an ice
 cream sandwich.  The terra cotta color suggests that it's ceramic, and
 therefore maybe fragile.  There's a single rune on it, which might
 mean something if you had ever paid attention in Sunday school, but
 well, that could never happen.  But you don't need a degree from
 Mythos Divinity School to realize that this thing is generating some
 kind of stasis field in which Jeff and the beetle are trapped.

>examine light


 (the strange yellow light)
 It's a sickly ochre field that envelops Jeff and the beetle.  It
 pulses slightly.

 You can't see any such thing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Secret Chamber</span>
 If there's a customer who really knows what he's talking about, Jeff
 brings him down here.  He's got the place pimped out mad-scientist
 style, with beakers and tubes and the like.  There's also a carved
 wooden bookshelf stuffed to capacity with tomes, grimoires, librams,
 and even the occasional "book."  Stairs lead back up to the shop.

 Sitting among the beakers and tubes is a latex glove.

 On one end of the room, there's a shrine to the Chairman of the Board,
 the Big C himself, in all his tentacled glory.

>examine glove


 It's a lonely glove.  Probably Jeff has been using it during his
 experiments.

>examine beakers


 Typical Dr. Frankenstein or Herbert West stuff: bubbling flasks,
 wires, jars of strange fluids, and powders.  You've got some lab
 experience, but you don't know what any of this stuff does.  That's

>examine bookshelf


 (the carved wooden bookshelf)
 It's a heavy wooden bookshelf, with a lot of grotesque flourishes
 carved in, groaning under the weight of the volumes it contains.

>examine volumes


 There are hundreds of books here on all manner of occult topics.  Only
 a few have titles on the spines.  Most are bound in some sort of
 leather, the source of which you don't want to know.  Others have
 ostentatious locks or other hardware to impress upon the reader how
 badass they (and by extension you) are.  Naturally, old warhorses like
 the <span class="floydstyle em">Necronomicon</span> are represented, along with some rarer
 stuff.  You could CONSULT TOMES ABOUT something.

>consult tomes about rune


 The Joy of Culting explains that it's a special stone used to
 immobilize things or people.  Once activated, you need only break it
 to dispel the effect.

 You are carrying:
   a latex glove (being worn)
   a red balloon

   a filthy pillow
   some cans of near-food
   some greasy sheets of wax paper
   a Ziploc bag (open but empty)
   a hooded robe (hood lowered) (being worn)

>consult tomes about qua'ox


 You search the tomes, hoping that you can find something useful about
 this creature.  Ah, here: it's Van der Wurff's Compendium of
 Otherworldly Fauna.  And it's written in Yuggothic.  Awesome.  You had
 to learn that for your binding (essentially your cult mitzvah), but
 you've read approximately zero Yuggothic since then.  Pressing on, you
 flip around the book until you find a picture of what you're looking
 for, then translate, painfully: "The Qua'ox is a beetle-like creature
 from..." blah blah blah, yeah, yeah, how do we defeat it?  Oh, there
 we go: "The Qua'ox, like many predators, is particularly drawn by
 rapid, irregular movement, like that of potential prey.  It is also
 attracted by the color red."

 Jeff is still regaining consciousness.

 Jeff appears from behind the counter, rubbing his eyes.  "Man, am I

 fist expectantly.  "I√§, dude!  Great work!"

 "Oh, man, that sucked pretty bad.  Thanks again.  I had the box up
 here because I was gonna mail-order it out to some brothers in Eau
 Claire.  Nice work, dude.  I can wrangle it with this," he says,
 producing a small whistle from his pocket.  He puts it to his lips,
 and carefully opens the secret door once again.  The beetle,
 apparently waiting right behind it, leaps out right at Jeff's face.
 He blows the whistle.  You hear nothing, but the beetle drops to the
 ground, legs up, motionless.  Jeff scoops it up and puts it in an
 unbroken box.  "Alright, we got that taken care of."

 You could ask him about how he ended up in stasis.

>ask about statis


 "Sorry, dude.  Can't help you with that."

>ask about stasis


 "I'm a dumbass, basically," says Jeff.  "This girl comes in.  I've
 never seen her before, so I figure she's a pink who's here to realign
 her aura or something.  But she starts talking about Carver's Cave
 with some authority, so I'm wondering if maybe she's on the team but
 just from out of town.  Then she produces the piece of paper you lost
 with the code to open the Ark of Gl'thub and asks for help in
 translating the symbols.  And I'm like, <span class="floydstyle em">dude</span>.  This can't be
 right.  So I tell her to hold on for a sec while I get something.  I'm
 going to sic the Qua'ox on her, but she's too fast, and pushes me
 down.  Next thing I know, she produces a Gothaullog stone and I'm
 frozen."

 You could ask him about the young woman or the small oval.

>ask about oval


 "Oh yeah," he says. "That's a Gothaullog stone.  Puts you in stasis,
 but I guess you figured that part out.  She must have been digging
 into our stuff for a while now, to figure out how to make or find one
 of those."

 You could ask him about the young woman.

>ask about girl


 Who do you mean, the teenagers or the young woman?

>ask about woman


 You ask Jeff to describe the young woman.

 "Well, she was young, maybe early twenties.  Dark frizzy hair,
 shoulder-length.  Wore a sort of trench coat or something."

 You could tell him about the Heart of Something.

>tell jeff about heart


 You mention to Jeff that you are pretty sure that his young woman
 snuck into the bistro, knocked out Walter, and made off with the Heart
 of Something.

 "Holy crap!" he says.  "She has the Heart of Unktahe?  Does anyone
 else know?"  You reply in the negative.  "Alright, man, we've got to
 get that thing back, like, ASAP.  Otherwise, we're both gonna end up
 on the slab.  I've got a spell we can use to try to track her down.
 We'll need two things: some personal object of hers, and an image of
 some sort.  See if you can get that stuff and bring it to me.  I'll
 make preparations here."

 You could ask him about Carver's Cave, the spell or Uncle Stu.

>show pillow to jeff


 You hand over the pillow to Jeff in the hopes that it might be a
 component for the spell.  He holds it with an outstretched arm, with
 thumb and forefinger grasping as little of it as possible.  "Barry,
 man, I don't think this is hers.  I'm pretty sure she fished this out
 of the garbage somewhere.  There's gotta be something less grody we
 can use."  He hands it back to you.

 "It's just your basic locator spell.  We'll need an image of her, and
 something belonging to her.  Get those, and we can give it a shot."

 You could ask him about Carver's Cave.

 You ask Jeff about Carver's Cave.

 "Yeah, well, she seems to know what she's doing, so I wouldn't be
 shocked if she's visited it.  Might be worth checking out, if you
 haven't already been there," he replies.

 You have nothing specific in mind to discuss with Jeff right now.

 You're on Mounds Boulevard at Cherry Street, a little east of

 colorful leaves, the Mississippi River below, acorns everywhere.  You
 hate to think that whatever Stu has planned is going to ruin this.
 The super-secret entrance to Carver's Cave is down the bluff towards
 the river, and Randolph Avenue is southwest.

 Only the followers of the Old Ones can penetrate the mysteries of --
 well, goddammit.  The shrub that normally covers up the secret

 You're much of the way down the bluff here.  The shrub that normally
 covers up the secret entrance is gone.  A jagged boulder is in its
 place.  There's only a narrow crack leading into the bluff side now.
 You can also head further up and down the bluff.

>in


 The grease from the pizza is just enough to enable you to contort your
 way in.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

>crank flashlight


 You crank up the flashlight a little, and then switch it on.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Carver's Cave</span>
 You're in Carver's Cave, a small natural fissure underneath Saint
 Paul.  The Lakota called this place <span class="floydstyle em">Wakan Tipi</span>, the House of
 the Great Spirit.  It used to be accessible, a tourist attraction
 even.  Every so often, the entrance would be lost in a rockslide, and
 the city would open it back up again, until finally they chose to
 block it off entirely.

 There's a beach of sorts, and beyond that, a calm, dark pool extending
 into the blackness.  Water laps gently near your feet, and there's an
 audible trickle from somewhere deep in the darkness.  It's otherwise
 deathly quiet, and very chilly.  You can leave to the south.

 Lying on the beach is the hacked-up corpse of a giant serpent,
 marinating in a puddle of purplish blood.

>examine blood


 It's a purplish gelatinous goo, roughly the consistency of cold maple
 syrup.  It has a very bitter, acrid odor.  It's pooled inside the
 corpse.

>eat blood


 You're not a vampire.  But frankly, not even a vampire would drink
 this.

>examine corpse


 It's the body of the Great Spirit, or one such Great Spirit, that your
 uncle summoned in order to kill and cut out its heart.  That was
 another super-boring hours-long ceremony, but got pretty good at the
 end when it turned into some hardcore LARPing.  Your buddy Jake got in
 the final blow with a replica Glamdring from the SkyMall catalog.  The
 bad news is that the serpent's blood burned right through the sword.
 Anyway, your uncle then cut out the still-beating heart and put it in
 the Ark, where you assumed it was safe and secure, which it was,
 before your dumb ass got involved.

 The serpent's purplish blood is pooled in and around the corpse.

>examine beach


 It's a beach only in the strictest sense.  It's made up a dark, gritty
 clay.  You don't feel any particular compulsion to pull up a chaise
 longue or an umbrella.

 Calm, but not entirely still.  There's a definite current flowing
 towards the south.  The cave presumably drains in that direction.

 With the pizza grease slathered on, and some creative shoulder
 movements and breathing, you manage to push your way through the

>take blood


 With your gloved hand, you carefully scoop some ichor into the Ziploc
 bag.

>take corpse


 It's pretty gross.  The cold down here has kept it from decomposing
 very much, but it's been chewed on by something, and it's all hacked
 apart.  Best to just leave it alone.

 A wrapper from a Baby Ruth bar floating just below the surface of the
 pool emerges from the darkness to the north, at the back of the cave.
 The current carries it to the south and out of view.  Oh man, a Baby
 Ruth would be awesome right now.

 You once again try to twist your way through the gap.  As you contort
 yourself in, though, you notice that the Ziploc bag of ichor is caught
 on a particularly sharp edge of the rock.  If you go any further, the
 bag will almost certainly tear in catastrophic fashion.

>go down


 You can't go that way.

>put bag in pool


 You place the bag in the frigid water.  It seems to be
 neutrally-buoyant, suspended a few inches under the surface.  The

 the cave.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Base of the Bluff</span>
 You're at the bottom of the bluff now, with the river directly before

 emerges and drips into the river.

 The entrance to the cave is above you.

 Deposited here underneath the pipe is that Baby Ruth wrapper you saw
 earlier.

>look in pipe


 The Ziploc bag has washed down here and clings to a rusty burr on the
 inside of the pipe.

>take bag


 As you grasp the open bag, you realize that it is now empty, or
 emptyish; there's a thin film of purple goo still clinging to the
 interior, but that's about it.  Apparently the ichor is water-soluble.

 It's not enough to cause any serious leakage, but you'll have to be

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mounds Boulevard</span>
 You're on Mounds Boulevard at Cherry Street, a little east of
 downtown.  "Mounds," because some Native American burial mounds are
 just down the road.  It's a pretty nice fall tableau here: lots of
 colorful leaves, the Mississippi River below, acorns everywhere.  You
 hate to think that whatever Stu has planned is going to ruin this.
 The super-secret entrance to Carver's Cave is down the bluff towards
 the river, and Randolph Avenue is southwest.

 Your Saturn is parked here.

>in


 You get into the Saturn.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle i">Randolph Avenue</span> (in the Saturn)
 You're on Randolph Avenue, which stretches far to the west toward
 Highland Park and to the east towards the river.  The part we're on
 here is firmly middle class, maybe on the low side.  There are a lot
 of small close-set houses with minimally-tended lawns, pockmarked by
 the occasional commercial space, including your restaurant.

 Your cult's shop, Unspeakable Books and Gifts, is located a few miles
 to the west.  Carver's Cave is to the northeast.  There's also an
 alleyway to the southwest.  The dining room is to the south.

>go south


 You can't drive the car onto the sidewalk.  Well, you shouldn't, at
 least.

>out


 You get out of the Saturn.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The old bistro had ten tables and seated about forty.  The chairs are
 propped up on the tables upside-down and covered in dust.  Large
 windows look out onto the street, but they're soaped up so that the
 public can't see all the important renovation work going on in here,
 which is to say none.  The kitchen is to the south, the bathroom is to
 the west, and you can walk out onto the street to the north.

 Hanging from the ceiling is a funky, thrift-store-looking chandelier.

 You can see a small security camera mounted in the corner of the
 ceiling, and a thin black wire running from it.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 This is a small professional kitchen.  Although the pots and pans and
 smaller appliances are all gone, the oven is still functional, as long
 as your uncle keeps paying the gas bill.  Also here, not part of the
 original decor, is the Ark of Whatever.

 The door to the restaurant's office leads west, the pantry is to the
 south, and the dining room is to the north.

 The cable from the security camera runs through here and into a small
 hole above the office door.

 Walter is here, unconscious.

>squeeze bag on office door


 (the office door)
 You smear a little goo on the door.  Nothing happens.  Apparently it
 can't burn through artificial wood-veneer.  Go science!

>squeeze bag on office lock


 You can't effectively smear the goo onto the metal bits of the lock;
 there's not much exposed.  You might have better luck if you could
 somehow get the goo into the keyhole.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a Baby Ruth wrapper
   a Ziploc bag (closed)
     some acidic goo
   a clunky old computer monitor
   a latex glove (being worn)
   some Breaking Bad DVDs
   a flashlight (providing light)
   a filthy pillow
   some cans of near-food
   some greasy sheets of wax paper
   a hooded robe

 And you're all greased up.

>squeeze bag in lock


 You manage to put the corner of the Ziploc bag into the keyhole.  It's
 in fairly deep.

 You inject some of the purple goo directly into the office door lock.
 Immediately, an acrid smoke begins to waft from the door.  You can
 hear the lock mechanism sizzling as it corrodes.  When you withdraw
 the bag, there's a jagged hole where the lock used to be.  The bag
 itself becomes snagged in the molten metal and rips apart, so you
 throw it away.

>open door


 You open the office door.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office</span>
 This is one of those miserable windowless back rooms you find in a
 restaurant or retail shop.  You can imagine the kind of boss who might
 lair here.  He's got a mustache, maybe a hairpiece too, and wears a
 wide, earth-toned tie.  He smokes, probably cheap cigars.  He's loud
 and abusive to his employees.  As the place is not in use, he's not
 actually here, but his presence lingers nonetheless.

 The office door leads back out east into the kitchen.

 Sitting on a desk is a small, boxy security system.  It seems to be
 lacking a monitor; in its place is a post-it note.  A thin wire leads
 out of it and up through a hole near the ceiling.  There's also a
 printer attached.

>examine note


 It reads: "Fixing the monitor.  Sorry! -- Jeff".

>put monitor on desk


 You put the clunky old computer monitor on the desk.

>hook up monitor


 What do you want to hook up the clunky old computer monitor to?

>wire


 That's not possible.

>hook up monitor to wire


 That's not possible.

>hook up monitor to printer


 You hook up the monitor to the security system and power it on.

>examine monitor


 The system is composed of a central unit, probably some sort of
 internal storage for the feed.  There are also several controls, the
 most interesting of which are the rewind button and the print button.
 There's also an ancient printer attached.  The display is small and
 not exactly crisp.  It's currently showing the empty and static dining
 room.

 The charge on the flashlight gives out.

>rewind


 You rewind the feed.  It's impossible to tell that anything is
 happening, as there is no activity on the screen whatsoever.  Then all
 of a sudden, someone emerges from the bathroom, walking backwards with
 her back to you.  Oh, right, rewinding.  It's a young woman, wearing a
 crazily oversized coat with all manner of crap protruding from the
 pockets, to the point where it's a wonder that she can even move.  In
 one hand she has the Heart of Something; in the other she has a
 sandwich.  Oh.  Sorry, Walter.

 The reverse feed continues, with nothing happening for a minute or
 two.  Then you see the young woman once again.  She holds a rag in one
 hand, and tiptoes backward towards the bathroom, this time with her
 face to the camera.  You pause the image.  She's got medium-length
 dark hair, a little frizzy.  Freckles, maybe.  Looks a little like
 Alia Shawkat.  It's obviously not really her, but still.

 Wait, this woman is totally familiar.  Who is she?  You've definitely
 seen her.  Think, man, think!

>think


 You focus on the young woman.  Who is she?  Did you go to school with
 her, maybe?  Meet her at a party?  You close your eyes for a moment.
 You see her, next to you, somewhere.  You try to visualize talking to
 her, but can't.  A-ha!  She was eating at the goddamned bacon booth at
 the state fair, with you and Sam.  Sam knew her.  In fact, she gave
 something to Sam: a hairclip or something.  Finally, a lucky break!
 All you have to do now is ask your ex-girlfriend, with whom you had a
 messy breakup, to help you.  That should work out great.  Sam lives to
 the north of the restaurant.

>press print


 The printer fires up with a grating whirr.  After an interminable
 staccato dance of feeding and adjusting, it begins printing, and spits
 out an image of the young woman.

 To the north is Sam's front door.  There's a prominent doorbell next

 You ring the bell.  You hear footsteps, and then she appears at the
 door: Samiira Abdi, your girlfriend up until a few weeks ago.  She was
 a really great catch, you recall with a sigh.  Tall and lanky, smart,
 pretty with a distinctive East African nose, and for a couple of
 years, she skated with the Minnesota RollerGirls under the name Somali
 Hatchet, which is just impossibly sexy.  Right now, she's sporting a
 look you've never seen outside of old family photos: a hijab.  She
 doesn't seem all that thrilled to see you.

 "Hi, Barry," she says, affectlessly.  "What are you doing here?" --
 she stops and sniffs for a moment -- "Besides wearing a pizza?"

 (You could ask her about how she's doing or the hijab.)

 why you're not together anymore.

>ask how she's doing


 You can't see any such thing.

>ask her about her


 You pause awkwardly.  "So, how have you been?"

 "I'm OK.  Work's been decent."  Another pause.  "I'm seeing someone,
 you know."

 You could ask her about the hijab or seeing someone.

>ask her about hijab


 You point to the hijab.  "So what's the deal with --"

 "My father is coming over later," she says, her accent suddenly
 growing stronger.  "I thought maybe you were him.  I mean, he knows I
 don't wear it all the time, or ever, I guess, but it makes things
 easier when he's around."

 You could ask her about seeing someone.

>ask about seeing someone


 "Already?" you say.  "That was pretty qui-- oh God, it isn't the same
 guy from your office party?"

 She looks down for a second.  "Yes, him.  Charles.  Is his name."

 You already knew his name.  A few weeks ago, you arrived unannounced
 at Sam's office party.  You found her in a supply room, drunk, blouse
 unbuttoned, with this Charles person.  That was the beginning of the
 end.

 No, that was the end of the end.  The beginning of the end was when
 you did the same thing to her a couple of months before.  You are a
 giant idiot.

 You could ask her about the young woman or Uma.

>ask about uma


 You try to lighten the mood.  "Hey, how's Uma's leg doing?  She still
 hobbling around?"

 Uma is Sam's cat, and the reason you two got together.  Sam brought
 her in one night with physalopterosis on one of your first shifts
 assisting at the U Clinic, and you got to talking.

 "Oh my God, that dummy is <span class="floydstyle em">killing</span> me," she says.  "Every five
 minutes she cries to have me lift her up on the bed, and then three
 seconds later she is crying to get back down."  You shake your head in
 sympathy.  Cats.

 You could ask her about the young woman.

>ask about woman


 "Look, Sam, I'm sorry to ask you like this, but it's super-important:
 do you remember at the state fair, there was this one woman you were
 talking to when we were at the bacon booth?  Someone you worked with,
 maybe?  She gave you something, like a hairclip.  Do you still have
 it, you think?  I am really sorry to be bugging you about this, but
 believe me when I say it's a matter of life and death."

 Sam thinks for a moment.  "Her name was Leah Weinstein or Weinberg or
 something.  She worked at the office for a couple of days then quit.
 She offered me the hairclip when I said we were going on the Crazy
 Mouse and my hair kept getting in my face.  She must have forgotten
 about it, and so did I.  Why do you need it?"

 You could tell her about some cockamamie story or the spell.

>tell story


 You can't see any such thing.

>tell her about story


 Quick, come up with something!  "Um, yeah, Leah works at the
 restaurant now.  Or she will, you know, when it opens.  So she needs
 her hairclip back."  Sam stares at you, her arms crossed.  I don't
 think she's buying it.

 You could tell her about the spell.

>tell her about spell


 "OK," -- you clear your throat -- "I need to track her down because
 she stole a valuable relic that is going to prevent my cult from
 channeling an Old One's essence into my uncle.  Personally, I don't
 care, but I guess it's an important religious thing, and he's going to
 be pissed if we don't get it back.  The hairclip is a component in a
 magic spell to find her."

 She smirks.  "Yeah, OK, that sounds perfectly reasonable.  Is there a
 voodoo doll involved?"

 "No, just a picture.  Do you have the clip?"

 "Maybe.  Wait here," she says, and heads inside.  She returns a few
 moments later with a small tortoise-shell-colored hairclip.  "I think
 this is it," she says, and starts to hand it to you.  Then she quickly
 withdraws it.  "You really need this?  What, are you dating this girl
 now?"

 "Yeah, I really do, and no, I am not.  I never met her."

 She's about to give you the clip when she pauses again.  "Hey, you
 still have my Breaking Bad DVDs, don't you?  I think before you
 destroy the world you ought to give me back my discs."

 You could ask her about the Breaking Bad DVDs.

>ask her about dvds


 (Sam about the Breaking Bad DVDs)
 "I could've sworn I returned those to you," you say.  "You sure I have
 them?"

 "Nice try, Barry.  You're holding them."

 You could give Sam the DVDs.

>give sam the dvds


 She takes custody of the discs and finally relents, handing over the
 clip.  "Have fun drowning the world in blood.  It was good to see you,
 Barry."  With that, she retreats into her apartment and closes the
 door.

 It's one of those little hinged plastic hair clippie things.

 trapezoid on the wood floor with a piece of chalk.  "Hey, better get
 your robe on," he says.  "Make this all official-like.  I think the
 big guys like it when we're dressed for the part."  Seems reasonable,
 so you comply.  "Sit on this side," he says, pointing to the wide end;
 he himself sits at the narrow end.  OK, yeah, this is starting to come
 back to you now.  He scrawls out an Elder Sign in the middle, and then
 lights a candle on either side of you.  He dips into a bag of, well,
 it looks like red sand, but is probably something like granulated
 Shoggoth nightmares.  Wait, no -- the bag is from Petco.  Anyway, he
 sprinkles that around a bit, then places the printout of the woman and
 her hairclip in the center, on top of the sign.  He grabs your hands
 and closes his eyes.

 "OK, so now repeat after me:  <span class="floydstyle em">Ehye f'geb Tsathoggua wgah'n</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">k'yarnak gof'nn...</span>"

 "I forget Tsathoggua vogon kayak golfing..."

 This goes on for much longer than you were hoping.  Finally Jeff
 yells, "I√§! I√§!"  The sand begins to swirl around until it resolves
 into the form of a street map.  Wow, this is pretty bitchin'.  You can
 feel power flowing through you.

 "Barry, get ready!  Watch for the spark!"  At this, the image and the
 hairclip are consumed in brilliant green flames, accompanied by thick
 smoke.  The fumes begin to sting your eyes and nose.  You're tearing
 up, and you feel an insistent itch in your nasal passages.  A sneeze
 is coming on.  Hastur's hot hole, not now!

 That's what you're trying to avoid.

 You can't suppress it any longer.  Your head rears back involuntarily,
 brushing up against your lowered hood, and then propels forward.  A
 one-hundred-mile-per-hour blast of air and snot launches itself from
 your nostrils.  With nothing to stop it, or even blunt it, the sneeze
 scatters the colored sand everywhere.  A tiny spark from the green
 flames shoots like a meteor and lands on the now-bare floor.

 Jeff shakes his head.  Well, that's that, I guess.  You're never going
 to find another item of hers to use in the spell, at least not in
 time.  But on the bright side, you'll get to the meet the Old Ones,
 after Stu gets a hold of you.

 With your hands unavailable, you grab an edge of the hood with your

 flops up over your face.  Good enough.

 You can't suppress it any longer.  Your head rears back involuntarily,

 oversized hood catches most of the impact.  The sand is still more or
 less intact, and you've miraculously managed to keep hold of Jeff's
 hands as well.  A tiny spark from the green flame shoots like a meteor
 and lands on the sand-map.  Jeff, wiping a little snot from his face,
 peers closely at it.  The spark is on the south side of Summit Avenue,
 between Hamline and Syndicate.  That's where she is.  Her house,

 OK, so <span class="floydstyle em">this</span> is what's at Summit and Syndicate.  You're
 standing outside Mt. Zion Temple, which you've probably driven by
 eight thousand times, but never really noticed.  It's a synagogue, I

 Star of David, since faded to purple.  The temple itself is a low,
 orange-brick mid-century modernist structure.  Kowalski's supermarket
 is to the east, and the entrance to the temple is south.  The

 Your Saturn is parked here.

 Streams of people approach the synagogue from all directions.  They're
 dressed all fancy-like for the most part.  Some carry brown grocery
 bags.  Those with the bags are handing them to a volunteer standing

 There are several St. Paul police officers posted around the building.
 That's odd.  I guess something important must be going on.

 People of various sizes and ages, most of them dressed semi-formally,
 converging on the synagogue.

>examine volunteer


 She's wearing a blue vest, designating her as an official person of
 some kind.  From time to time, you can see people walk up and hand her
 a brown grocery bag full of canned goods.

 You hear a clunk and a "D'oh!"  Someone's bag has ripped, and cans of
 food are rolling down the sidewalk.  The unfortunate person and the
 volunteer scramble to catch them and toss them into other
 not-quite-as-full bags sitting in the van.

 "They're not for sale.  They're sent out to members of the synagogue.
 Space is at a premium during the High Holy Days, you know."

 "Oh, yeah, sure.  I'm actually a member; I just forgot my ticket."

>examine rack


 It looks vaguely like a towel rack, and in fact, there are things that
 look vaguely like towels hanging from it.  OK, not really towels:
 they're clearly of a thin, smooth and not very absorbent material.
 Each one has lots of little tassels or fringes on the ends, and
 there's some Hebrew writing on one of the long sides.  They are
 however, roughly towel-shaped, and have blue stripes in a very
 towelish pattern.  I suppose "shawls" is more appropriate.

 This is Kowalski's, a Twin Cities chain of high-falutin supermarkets.
 Everywhere you look, there is food stacked floor to ceiling, and all
 of it looks good.  You're near the produce, which is attractively lit
 with special tinted lights, so that the greens and reds are deeper and
 more alluring.  There's a display of doughnuts in front of you, and by
 the registers you can see racks of candy bars, chips, cookies, and all
 sorts of horrible/delicious snacks.  You desperately want them all.
 Fortunately for you, the bakery and deli sections are on the far end
 of the store, so that you can't smell them from here.  You can exit to
 the northwest.

 Each register has a stack of paper bags.  You can probably take one
 without opposition.

 You approach the volunteer and she looks up at you.

 You hand the bag over to the volunteer.  She grabs it by the handles
 and turns around, when suddenly, but not unexpectedly, the bottom
 falls out.  Cans spill out and begin rolling down the sidewalk.  She
 starts chasing after them.

>take ticket


 With the volunteer scrambling around grabbing cans, you deftly lift
 the ticket from her jacket.  You start to feel bad about this, but
 then comfort yourself with the thought that she's probably been to a
 zillion of these before.  And she's wearing the blue vest, which is
 probably a Get Into Yom Kippur Free card anyway.

 You make a show of tracking down a can or two, then hand them to her.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
 This is the main sanctuary of the synagogue, decorated in soothing
 pastels.  The business end is to the south: there's a raised area,
 with a podium, and behind that, there's a small flame burning adjacent
 to a small pair of doors set into the south wall.  In front of the
 raised area there are rows of seats to accommodate the sizable crowd.
 You came in from the east, and it looks like maybe there's a way out
 to the south as well.

 Leah must be somewhere in this crowd.

 Standing behind the podium is a goateed man wearing white robes,
 chanting something.  The rabbi, presumably.  Next to him is what
 appears to be an animal horn.

 <span class="floydstyle em">...Ba-ruch a-tah A-do-nai...</span>

 You survey the assembled congregants.  Lots of people of all ages,
 sizes, and unexpectedly, colors.  Many of the boys are wearing the
 same sad uniform: a button-down shirt, khakis, and sneakers.  Don't
 kids have suits anymore?  Never mind that.  Focus!  Where is this Leah
 person?  Better keep searching the crowd.

 You continue scanning the crowd for signs of the intrepid pain in the
 ass who took the Heart.  You don't see her, but you do see a kid
 reading <span class="floydstyle em">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</span> instead of his
 prayer book.  You can only silently salute his forethought.

 Dammit, where is she?  Then, at last, you spot her: she's up very
 close to the front, near the interior aisle, right in front of
 everybody.  Of course she is.  As unsuspiciously as you can manage,
 you thread your way through the crowd to arrive at an open seat just
 behind hers.  It's her alright -- same height, same build, same
 freckles, same frizzy hair that you saw on the security system.  You
 know, in person, she might be kind of cute.  Focus!  Anyway, she looks
 a little bored with the proceedings, truth to tell.  She's checking
 her phone from time to time.  She's no longer wearing the enormous
 many-pocketed trench coat.  She does have a big canvas satchel with
 her, though.

 my God, the apple fritters at Mojo Monkey.  When all this is done, you
 absolutely need to get over to Mojo's and -- Cthulhu's cthornhole!
 Stay on target!

 As you peer into the bag, you see what you can only assume is the
 Heart.  There's a parcel, about the size of a Chicago softball,
 wrapped in newspaper, with visible streaks of blood.  It's here with
 her!  She hasn't had to time to stow it safely anywhere.  Hell, she
 probably knows that that we're searching for it, and thinks that it's
 safer with her.  Oh, this is seriously lucky.  Now, perhaps you can
 ever-so-carefully take it out of the bag without her noticing...

 coast is clear, you reach into the bag.  Blindly, you paw around until
 you can feel the newspaper.  Great Nyarlathotep, it's almost within
 your grasp.  Just another inch and...

 Suddenly, there's a scream from the entrance to the sanctuary.  A
 policeman enters, takes a step, and falls over face-first.  Striding
 in over him is your Uncle Stu.  Oh no.  He must've found Jeff, who
 must've spilled the beans.  The rabbi stops his chanting, and everyone
 turns to Stu in shock and puzzlement.  Stu is changed, and not subtly.
 He's grown considerably, and his skin, which seems thicker and tougher
 somehow, is an ashen gray.  The ritual is almost complete.  All he
 needs now is to consume the Heart.  He raises his meaty fist; in it,
 you can see a blue crystal.  He intones some words that you can't make
 out from here.

 You hear, and then feel, a high-pitched hum: a wave of sickening
 energy, penetrating your skin, into your bones, into your skull.
 People all around you begin convulsing in pain.

 You seize upon an idea: the power can be yours, instead of Stu's.  You
 take a tentative bite of the Heart, then another.  The blood trickles
 down your throat, and instantly, you can feel your gnawing hunger
 abate.  Power courses through you.  As Leah and the other congregants
 crumple to the floor, you begin to thrum with otherworldly energy.
 Stu looks up and sees you, sees that you've eaten the Heart.  "No!" he
 hisses, and leaps toward you in desperation.  You've ascended far
 beyond the likes of him, though.  You snap his neck with your
 outstretched talons as easily as you would a breadstick.  You feel an
 overwhelming surge as your form bursts through the ceiling of the
 synagogue, and your mind encompasses the stars and the ocean floor.
 Then a thought occurs to you: wasn't there supposed to be some sort of
 ritual to prepare for this?  The explosion that tears through you
 demolishes much of Summit Avenue.

 now his journey is complete.  He puts a hand on your shoulder, gives
 you an exaggerated wink, and tears into the Heart with his
 suddenly-sharp teeth.  With the first bite, he begins to grow more
 massive.  His jaw unhinges like a great serpent's, and he swallows the
 rest of the Heart in one gulp.  Tentacles emerge from his torso, and

 You run away, leaving Stu, Leah, and the bleeding congregation behind.
 Somehow you find your way through a maze of corridors until you're

 hear sirens coming south down Hamline, but you know it's too late for
 them, and for anyone.  Stu has the Heart, no thanks to you.  The smart
 money says that his reign will not be pleasant for you.  Might as well
 go to the Nepalese place across from Kowalski's.  Yak dumplings make
 as good a last meal as any.

 The main entrance to the sanctuary is complete pandemonium.  You'd

 Blood begins to drip from the rabbi's ears as your uncle invokes the
 power of the crystal.  You see figures all around the sanctuary
 dropping to the floor.  "Make it stop," Leah pleads, almost inaudibly
 over the infernal hum.  She collapses to the ground, twitching, tears
 and blood streaking down her face.  She looks up and recognizes you.
 Clearly terrified, she curls up into a tighter ball.

   a latex glove (being worn)
   a flashlight
   a filthy pillow

 And you're all greased up.

 Almost everyone in the sanctuary, except for you and your uncle, is on
 the floor writhing, or worse, completely still.  Leah quivers
 involuntarily, her hands clutched around her ears, her eyes closed
 tight.  She whispers, perhaps to no one in particular, "Help me!"
 Alright, Stu, you think.  Point made.  Let's skedaddle.

>kill leah


 You're generally a non-violent person.

 You stare, dumbstruck, as the last surviving members of the
 congregation quiver their last.  Stu strides over their bodies
 triumphantly.  Mission accomplished, I guess?  You didn't expect him
 to take it all the way, but Stu has been waiting for this moment for
 quite a while.  He's fired up and ready to roll.  Glancing at you
 dismissively, he snatches the Heart and tears into it with his
 suddenly-sharp teeth.  With the first bite, he begins to grow more
 massive.  His jaw unhinges like a great serpent's, and he swallows the
 rest of the Heart in one gulp.  Tentacles emerge from his torso, and
 he bursts through the ceiling with a primeval roar.  It is glorious.
 Even though you lost the Heart to begin with, you did at least make an
 effort to retrieve it, and Stu is feeling magnanimous.  You serve at
 his right tentacle for a brief while until the mood passes, and you
 are consumed.

 Even though you lost the Heart to begin with, you did at least make an
 effort to retrieve it, and Stu is feeling magnanimous.  You serve at
 his right tentacle for a brief while until the mood passes, and you
 are consumed.

>blow horn

 (first taking the shofar)
 You leap over to the podium and grab the horn.  Seized by a sudden
 flash of insight and pity, you inhale until you're full to bursting,
 and put the horn to your lips.  You sound a massive, deep blast that
 reverberates against the walls of the sanctuary.  You keep the blast
 going, a single piercing note, forcing the air from your lungs until
 they begin to ache.  You look up, and see the congregation recovering.
 The horn's blast is drowning out the crystal!  Leah slowly uncurls
 herself, opens her eyes, and sees you sounding the horn.  She seems
 oddly calm now, and starts to crawl away.

 Still you blow, your face turning red, then purple, the same note
 sounding, shaking the very walls of the temple.  You close your eyes
 as you expel the last bit of air.  Finally, there's a cracking sound,
 and a pulse of white light.  The crystal shatters.

 The rabbi stands, a trickle of blood running along his jawline and
 down his chin.  "<span class="floydstyle em">Tekiah gedolah!</span>" he shouts, as the other
 congregants snap out of their fugues.  Suddenly, there's another
 crack, and your dumbstruck uncle crumples to the ground.  Standing
 over him is Leah, clutching a Torah in both hands.  Her face is caked
 with blood, her dress dirty and wrinkled, her mascara running in thick
 black streaks down her face.  She looks up at you and smiles.  She's
 the most beautiful woman you've ever seen.  Three Saint Paul policemen
 burst in with tasers and handcuffs, but frankly, their job has been
 done for them.

 "I knew you couldn't be all bad," Leah says, between strained breaths.
 "You were so gentle with my roommate's beagle when we brought her in
 with a scratched eye last winter.  It was really sweet."  At this, she
 throws up.  Still, it's a nice moment.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Como Park</span>
 One year later.  You stand under the chuppah on a warm summer day in
 Como Park.  Sailboats and canoes dot the lake in front of you.  The
 air is filled with bird songs and the scent of flowers.  Leah stands
 to your right, beaming and crying.  Behind you are several dozen
 guests.  On her side: her parents, family, and friends.  On yours:
 Sandy, Jeff, and some of the other guys from the cult.  Yeah, the cult
 is still operating, but it's pretty mellow now.  Fewer human
 sacrifices, more pancake breakfasts.  Mostly now it's just a way to
 feel like you're part of something.

 The rabbi places his hands upon your heads and intones a final prayer.
 At your feet is a glass, wrapped in a napkin.  The rabbi points to it
 and nods.

>smash glass


 You break the glass (on the second try) and kiss your bride.  The
 assembled crowd claps and hollers in approval.  Even the winged horror
 gives a celebratory screech.

 Let's get to the reception; you're starving.
