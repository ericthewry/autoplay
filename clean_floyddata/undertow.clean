 Yesterday, as you were walking through Central Park, a meteorite
 crashed nearby, bathing you in cosmic radiation.  It only made the
 twelth page of the paper, under Dear Abby.  Of course, if anyone could
 have foreseen the awful effects of that accident, it surely would have
 been a front page story.  But there was no way for you, or anyone
 else, to predict that the result of that accident would be....

 Your Bedroom (on the bed)
 Home sweet home for a '60s throwback bachelor like yourself.
 Assorted, but unimportant decorations litter the walls and ceiling.
 To the west is a door that, as you fuzzily recall, leads into your
 walk-in closet.  To the east is a hallway, that, as you even more
 fuzzily recall, leads to the kitchen.

 A hollow voice says, "This is a short sample 'game' designed to test
 out some programming ideas I had.  It pays homage to the bad old
 sci-fi B movies.  The material here is, I suppose, vaguely mystifying
 to small children, so parents be warned, play it through first
 yourself, and make your own decision about it."

 How did Thom ever talk you into this one...

 Your friend Thom Hall has always been a smooth talker, which is
 probably how he got you to attend his party on board the
 *Bellerophon*.  The fourty-eight-foot yacht is named after the H.M.S.
 Bellerophon, the ship on which Napoleon formally surrendered in 1815
 after Waterloo.  Thom isn't usually too modest.

 Anyway, you're now stuck at a floating party with three other people
 you barely know, friends of Thom's.  Bill Leveritt is one of Thom's
 partners in his architectural firm.  Carl Weathers, another old friend
 of Thom's, brought his girlfriend Ashleigh Flannagin, which completes
 the floating fivesome.

 So far you've seen Bill and Thom yell at each other, Thom hit Carl for
 some unexplained reason, and Ashleigh ignore both Thom and you.  Not
 the most pleasant party you've ever been to.

 And it's barely 10 a.m...

 Undertow v1.1 (9/5/1995) by Stephen Granade
 Developed with TADS, the Text Adventure Development System.

 Forward Head
    The forward head sports a small toilet, a sink, and a miniscule
 shower.  In the floor is a small drain; above the sink, a mirror and
 medicine cabinet.  A closed door leads west.

 I don't know how to sit on the toilet.

 Opened.

 There's nothing in the medicine cabinet.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>examine it
 It is bolted to the wall just above the sink.  It is made of strong
 plastic, and is open.

>examine drain
 It sees a lot of use due to the shower.  Its metal surface is streaked
 with hard-water stains.

>look in it
 Don't worry about the drain.

>open it
 Don't worry about the drain.

>lick it
 I don't know the word "lick".

>take a shower
 Don't worry about the shower.

>time
 The time is now 10:12 a.m.

>examine me
 You look remarkably like yourself.

>taste drain
 I don't know the word "taste".

>go west
 You'll have to open the door first.

>open door
 It's locked.

>go west
 You'll have to open the door first.

>unlock door
 Unlocked.

>open door
 Opened.

>go west
 Forward Stateroom
    Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet
 near the nose of the ship.  On the port wall is a hanging locker, and
 across from it is the door to the forward head, standing open.  A
 small ladder to the south leads up to a door.
    Sitting on the left v-berth is a pill bottle.

>examine bottle
 The closed bottle is opaque and plastic.  The label has been torn off,
 so you don't know where it came from or what its pills do.  All that
 is left is a faded sketch of a man with dark circles under his eyes.

>get bottle
 Taken.

 The pill bottle doesn't appear appetizing.

>open it
 Opening the pill bottle reveals five little pills.

>eat pill
 You swallow the pill, grimacing at its chalky taste.  Almost
 immediately, you feel a wave of lethargy sweep over you.  You have to
 fight off the overwhelming urge to sleep.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 Forward Stateroom
    Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet
 near the nose of the ship.  On the port wall is a hanging locker, and
 across from it is the door to the forward head, standing open.  A
 small ladder to the south leads up to a door.

 Opening the hanging locker reveals a safe.

 Squat, grey, metal.  It obviously requires a key to unlock it.  Part
 of the top of the safe is scarred with deep gouges.

 On closer inspection, you can see that the gouges outline a panel.

 The panel is surrounded by gouges, evidence of prior removals.

 No matter how you try to fit your fingers around the panel, you fail.
 Evidently the panel is not openable without the assistance of a tool.

>go up
 Forecastle
    The forecastle of the boat is surprisingly comfortable despite its
 small size.  The helm controls, including the wheel, are mounted on
 the fore wall, next to a chest-of-drawers which sports a lamp.  Across
 from the chest and beside the west entrance is the galley; between the
 galley and the helm is a companionway to the fore stateroom.  Also on
 the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is
 a dinette bench.  Windows are at each of the cardinal directions.  The
 west entranceway is open, as is the companionway to the north.
    Sitting on the small bar is a drink tray.

>examine tray
 The wooden drink tray has held many, many drinks on its surface and is
 discolored with many, many drink stains.  Right now it holds a whiskey
 bottle, a scotch bottle, a wine bottle, and a bottle of beer.  One
 edge is chipped slightly.

 Carl arrives from the west.

>examine carl
 Carl Weathers is about 28, with sandy brown hair and light blue eyes.
 If Hitler were alive today, he'd put Carl on one of his posters.  Carl
 is a bit of a know-it-all, but fairly bright.  You've never quite been
 sure what he does for a living.

 Bill arrives from the west.

 With a large sigh, Carl sits down on the bench.

>ask carl about bill
 Carl says, "Hmm, can't tell you too much about that!"

 Bill wanders over to the drink tray and picks up the whiskey bottle.
 From somewhere around the bar, he scrounges up a slightly-clean glass.
 With a deft flick of his wrist, he pours himself a shot of the whiskey
 and replaces the bottle.  "I've always, er, liked whiskey," he
 comments.

 Ashleigh arrives from the west.

>examine bill
 Bill Leveritt has been Thom's partner in their architectural firm for
 as long as you've known Thom.  Bill's thatch of thinning gray hair and
 round glasses make him look older than his forty-two years.  He tries
 to dress flamboyantly but often fails, as demonstrated today by his
 long-sleeved blue oxford shirt.  He's extremely good at what he does,
 but he is very unassuming; Thom is the talker of the firm.  In one
 hand he is holding one of his ubiquitous glasses of whiskey.

 Ashleigh sits down next to Carl and whispers something to him.  He
 grins slightly in response.

>examine ashleigh
 Ashleigh Flannagin is a knockout, which is why Thom ever dated her in
 the first place.  However, Thom always has to be right, and it didn't
 take long for Ash to tire of that and start dating Carl.  She has
 shoulder-length copper hair and dark brown eyes.

 Carl Weathers is about 28, with sandy brown hair and light blue eyes.
 If Hitler were alive today, he'd put Carl on one of his posters.  Carl
 is a bit of a know-it-all, but fairly bright.  You've never quite been
 sure what he does for a living.

>examine chip
 I don't know the word "chip".

>go west
 Port of Forecastle
    The flying bridge rises above you, its canopy rippling slightly in
 the wind. To the east, an open door flanked by windows leads into the
 forecastle.  To the northeast you can see the foredeck; to the south
 are the aft sections of the boat.

>examine bridge
 You can't see much of the flying bridge except its canopy.

>examine canopy
 It arches over much of the flying bridge.

>go south
 Port of Stateroom
    You stand on the deck of the boat, just to port of the aft
 stateroom.  Its roof curves across the boat, and a ladder leads to the
 roof and then to the flying bridge.  Beside the ladder, windows open
 into the stateroom.  To starboard is the rail, standing sentinel
 between you and the cerulean water.  The boat runs beneath your feet
 from the north to the southeast.

>examine rail
 The metal rail prevents you from sliding overboard and into the chilly
 water surrounding the boat.

>examine me
 You look remarkably like yourself.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>se
 Cockpit Deck
    The cockpit deck houses the twin diesel engines which power the
 boat.  A large access panel in the deck allows for any necessary
 engine maintenance.  On the stern, a flagstaff juts skyward, the stern
 light perched atop it like a squat bird.  The door leading down into
 the aft stateroom yawns widely.  Small windows flank the door.  Tied
 to a cleat on the port side is a line.  To the northeast and northwest
 is the remainder of the boat.

>examine line
 The line is tough, easily able to withstand the rigors of marine life.
 One end of it is tied to a cleat.  The other end of it runs over the
 rail and into the water.  It is taught, as if something heavy were
 tied to it.

>pull line
 You tug on the line as hard as you can, but something is weighing it
 down.  Glancing over the rail, you see a dark shape in the water.

>examine shape
 It looks disturbingly person-like.  In fact, it looks disturbingly
 Thom-like.

>untie line
 No matter how hard you work at the knot, you can't seem to untie it.

>pull line
 You tug on the line as hard as you can, but Thom's...dead weight, for
 lack of a better term, is too much for you.  Judging from the weight,
 it is too much for everyone else on board.

>examine thom
 I don't see any thom here.

>examine water
 It stretches all around you, rolling and glistening in the glare of
 the sun, churned up by the propellers.  It is tantalizingly close yet
 out of reach.  In the water, you can see a dim shape attached to the
 line tied to the cleat.

 Bill arrives from the northwest.

>tell bill about thom
 You tell Bill about seeing Thom's body in the water.  Bill, however,
 just waves you off absentmindedly.

 As he is walking past it, Bill absentmindedly tugs on the line.
 Something about it makes him stop.  He looks over the rail and into
 the water.  His eyes widen alarmingly, and he yells, "Oh, my God!
 Quick!  Everyone to the cockpit deck!  It's Thom!"  Bill begins
 pulling on the line with all his strength.  "Help me!" he says to you.

>pull line
 You tug on the line as hard as you can, but Thom's...dead weight, for
 lack of a better term, is too much for you.  Judging from the weight,
 it is too much for everyone else on board.

>tell bill about thom
 You tell Bill about seeing Thom's body in the water.  Bill, however,
 just waves you off absentmindedly.

 Carl arrives from the northwest.

 Ashleigh arrives from the northwest.

>help bill
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Carl grabs hold of the line and strains in concert with Bill.  You
 slide in between them and put your back into the effort, but to no
 avail.  After a few seconds, Carl stops, swearing.

 Bill says, "The four of us won't be able to drag Thom on board while
 we're, uh, moving."

 Ashleigh nods in agreement.  "We've got to cut the engines."  You find
 yourself wondering just who this "we" are--you surely don't want to
 monkey around with Thom's boat.  Not that he's going to care now, but
 habits are hard to break.

>examine panel
 The large access panel can be opened in order to repair or service the
 engines which power the boat.  Right now the panel is closed.

 Carl finally convinces himself that he won't be able to drag Thom
 onboard.  You would have been glad to explain it to him, but no doubt
 that would have taken one minute shy of eternity.  He glances at the
 three of you.

 "C'mon," he says, "I need you three on the flying bridge.  I'll
 explain up there, right?"

>open panel
 Opened.

 Bill leaves to the northwest.

 Carl leaves to the northwest.

 Ashleigh leaves to the northwest.

>go northwest
 Port of Stateroom
    You stand on the deck of the boat, just to port of the aft
 stateroom.  Its roof curves across the boat, and a ladder leads to the
 roof and then to the flying bridge.  Beside the ladder, windows open
 into the stateroom.  To starboard is the rail, standing sentinel
 between you and the cerulean water.  The boat runs beneath your feet
 from the north to the southeast.
    Bill stands here, slouching his way from one part of the boat to
 another.
    Carl, hands in pockets, is standing here, obviously on his way to
 somewhere else.
    Ashleigh is briskly walking through here.

 Bill climbs up the ladder and is gone.

 Carl climbs up the ladder and is gone.

 Ashleigh climbs up the ladder and is gone.

>go up
 Flying Bridge
    From up here, the skipper of the boat has an almost unobstructed
 view of the waters in any direction.  The wind whispers around the
 canopy's poles and past you on its journey.  Beyond the helm, through
 the windscreen, you can see the bow of the boat.  Further away is
 land, quite some distance away to the northeast.  A chair sits in
 front of the helm.  Towards the stern, a ladder leads down.
    Bill slumps here quietly.
    Carl is looking at the helm, thinking.
    Ashleigh is standing here, obviously a bit disturbed.

 Bill says, "Um, ok, Carl, what now?"

 Carl looks at the controls.  "I'd best man the anchor."  He looks at
 you, then at Bill.  Finally, "Bill, I want you to go to the cockpit
 deck and take care of the line Thom's attached to.  I want you," he
 turns to Ashleigh, "to relay my instructions to Bill, and I want you,"
 he turns to you, "to throttle back when I say so.  Look over the
 helm."  He makes a few adjustments to the helm, then nods to himself.

>look over helm
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine helm
 The helm is amazingly complex, with gagues for RPMs, temperature,
 amperage...the mind boggles.  On the right side of the helm are two
 levers:  the throttle handle and the clutch handle.  The throttle is
 taller than and to the right of the clutch handle.  In the middle of
 the helm is a large wooden wheel.

 Bill climbs down the ladder and is gone.

 Carl climbs down the ladder and is gone.

>examine throttle
 The throttle handle controls the boat's speed.  When pushed all the
 way forward, the engines run full out.  When pulled back, the engines
 almost idle.  Right now it is set to very slow.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Saved.

>examine clutch
 The clutch handle controls the direction the boat moves, either
 forward or reverse.  It can be pushed forward or pulled back.  Right
 now it is set to forward.

>examine wheel
 Attached to the helm, the wheel controls the ship's rudders.  It
 resembles a stereotypical ship wheel, with large wooden handles all
 around its circumference.

 From below, Carl yells at you, "Pull the throttle back to idle."

>pull throttle
 You pull the throttle back to idling speed.  You hear the engines slow
 down.

>examine island
 I don't know the word "island".

>look
 Flying Bridge
    From up here, the skipper of the boat has an almost unobstructed
 view of the waters in any direction.  The wind whispers around the
 canopy's poles and past you on its journey.  Beyond the helm, through
 the windscreen, you can see the bow of the boat.  Further away is
 land, quite some distance away to the northeast.  A chair sits in
 front of the helm.  Towards the stern, a ladder leads down.
    Ashleigh is standing here, obviously a bit disturbed.

>examine bow
 I don't see any bow here.

>ask ashleigh about thom
 Ashleigh laughs, a deep throaty sound.  "Sometimes I wonder how I ever
 dated him."

>ask ashleigh about bill
 Ashleigh says, "I don't know much about that."

>ask ashleigh about carl
 Carl is no longer here.

>examine ashleigh
 Ashleigh Flannagin is a knockout, which is why Thom ever dated her in
 the first place.  However, Thom always has to be right, and it didn't
 take long for Ash to tire of that and start dating Carl.  She has
 shoulder-length copper hair and dark brown eyes.

>ask ashleigh about murder
 I don't know the word "murder".

>turn wheel clockwise
 I don't know the word "clockwise".

>turn wheel to right
 I don't see any right here.

>turn wheel
 Turn it left or right?

>turn wheel right
 You spin the wheel to the right.  The bow begins to swing to
 starboard.

 Carl yells, "Ok, reverse the engines!"

>pull clutch
 You pull the clutch back.  You hear the engines drop into neutral.

>pull clutch
 You pull the clutch back.  You hear the engines begin to turn in
 reverse.

>look
 Flying Bridge
    From up here, the skipper of the boat has an almost unobstructed
 view of the waters in any direction.  The wind whispers around the
 canopy's poles and past you on its journey.  Beyond the helm, through
 the windscreen, you can see the bow of the boat.  Further away is
 land, quite some distance away to the northeast.  A chair sits in
 front of the helm.  Towards the stern, a ladder leads down.
    Ashleigh is standing here, obviously a bit disturbed.

>examine chair
 The blue chair makes piloting the boat much more comfortable.

>sit on chair
 Okay, you're now sitting on the chair.

 Carl shouts up at you, "Push the throttle to one-quarter."

>push throttle
 You push the throttle forward to very slow speed.  You hear the
 engines rev up to a higher pitch.

>again
 You push the throttle forward to one-quarter speed.  You hear the
 engines rev up to a higher pitch.

>look
 Flying Bridge, in the chair
    From up here, the skipper of the boat has an almost unobstructed
 view of the waters in any direction.  The wind whispers around the
 canopy's poles and past you on its journey.  Beyond the helm, through
 the windscreen, you can see the bow of the boat.  Further away is
 land, quite some distance away to the northeast.  A chair sits in
 front of the helm.  Towards the stern, a ladder leads down.
    Ashleigh is standing here, obviously a bit disturbed.

>examine bow
 I don't see any bow here.

>examine land
 Staring at it, you realize how far the boat has actually travelled.

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

>ask ashleigh about me
 You can't reach that from the chair.

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer in the chair.

 Carl yells, "Ok, I need you to shut off the...oh, screw it.  Ash, kill
 the engines!  And tell Bill to try pulling Thom in now."

 Ashleigh moves to the helm, leaving you to yell Carl's instructions to
 Bill.  "Oh, er, right!" he yells back.

>go northeast
 Starboard of Stateroom
    From where you are, only a thin rail stands between you and the
 water to starboard.  A roof, much more substantial than the rail and
 belonging to the aft stateroom, lies to port, stretching from here to
 the port side of the boat. Small windows gape in the stateroom's side.
 Two-thirds of the boat lie to the north, while the other one-third of
 the boat is to the southwest.

>go north
 Starboard of Forecastle
    Above you and to port rises the flying bridge, casting a cold
 shadow across you.  Also to port are the curtained windows which
 afford you a glimpse into the forecastle.  At your feet lies a closed
 compartment.  The boat continues to the northwest and south.

>examine compartment
 The compartment is about three meters long by half a meter wide and
 runs the length of the boat.  The lid of the compartment normally
 doubles as the deck.  Built in the lid is a small keyhole.  The
 compartment is closed and locked.

>examine bridge
 You can't see much of the flying bridge except its canopy.

>go northwest
 Foredeck
    The foredeck is as far forward on the *Bellerophon* as you can go
 and still be on the boat.  The bow rail keeps you from going
 overboard, lucky for you.  At your feet lies a small elliptical hole
 leading to the chain locker below.  Out of the hole runs the anchor
 chain.  Behind you loom the windows to the forecastle.  The rest of
 the yacht lies to the southwest and southeast.
    Bill is leaning against the bow rail.

>examine hole
 The hole in the deck opens into the chain locker, where the anchor
 chain is stored.  The anchor chain runs out of it, over the rail, and
 plunges into the sea.

>push bill
 Pushing Bill doesn't do anything.

>go down
 You can't go that way.

>open locker
 Your hand is too small to fit through the hole.

>examine screwdriver
 Thom has really put this tool through its paces.  Its tip is bent, as
 if he used it for non-standard purposes.

>examine windows
 They look into the forecastle.

>examine chain
 The anchor chain, along with the anchor, is used to attach the boat to
 the bottom of the sea.  It runs out of the hole in the deck, over the
 rail, and into the sea.

>go southwest
 Port of Forecastle
    The flying bridge rises above you, its canopy rippling slightly in
 the wind. To the east, an open door flanked by windows leads into the
 forecastle.  To the northeast you can see the foredeck; to the south
 are the aft sections of the boat.

>go east
 Forecastle
    The forecastle of the boat is surprisingly comfortable despite its
 small size.  The helm controls, including the wheel, are mounted on
 the fore wall, next to a chest-of-drawers which sports a lamp.  Across
 from the chest and beside the west entrance is the galley; between the
 galley and the helm is a companionway to the fore stateroom.  Also on
 the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is
 a dinette bench.  Windows are at each of the cardinal directions.  The
 west entranceway is open, as is the companionway to the north.
    Sitting on the small bar is a drink tray.
    Ashleigh is here, standing pensively.

>examine lamp
 A quick appraisal of the lamp bring the words "bulbous," "green," and
 "hideous" to mind for no apparent reason.  The red plaid lampshade
 does little to mute its appearance.  It has been attached to a square
 base about three centimeters thick, in case the boat pitches
 violently.

>examine base
 I don't know the word "base".

>chest
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine chest
 The chest-of-drawers is a nice piece of furniture despite the many
 water stains on its surface.  Three drawers run from the bottom of the
 chest to the top.  A lamp perches on top of the chest like a vulture.

>open top
 Opened.

>look in it
 There's nothing in the top drawer.

>close it
 Closed.

>open middle. look in it. close it
 Opened.

 There's nothing in the middle drawer.

 Closed.

>open bottom. look in it. close it
 Opened.

 There's nothing in the bottom drawer.

 Closed.

>get lamp
 After fooling with it for a few seconds, you decide that taking the
 lamp is a lost cause.

 There's nothing under the dinette bench.

 There's nothing in the dinette bench.

>examine tray
 The wooden drink tray has held many, many drinks on its surface and is
 discolored with many, many drink stains.  Right now it holds a whiskey
 bottle, a scotch bottle, a wine bottle, and a bottle of beer.  One
 edge is chipped slightly.

 I don't know the word "edge".

 I don't know the word "bottles".

>examine whiskey bottle
 The label claims that the whiskey is a good brand.  Knowing Thom, the
 label bears little relationship to what's inside.  The bottle contains
 quite a bit of whiskey.

>examine scoth
 I don't know the word "scoth".

>examine scotch
 The scotch appears to be passable.  Unfortunately, you don't care much
 for scotch.

>examine wine
 It is slightly yellowish.

>examine beer
 It's Stella, an imported beer.

>examine wine bottle
 The bottle's label proclaims it to be the proud product of Ernest &
 Julio Gallo's vinyards.  The bottle contains some white wine.

>examine beer bottle
 It is some imported beer named Stella.  The bottle contains a little
 beer.

>examine scotch bottle
 Light glints off the glass bottle, sparkling in your eyes.  Too bad
 you don't like scotch; this looks to be good.  The bottle contains
 some scotch.

>examine galley
 It is a marvel of compact engineering, managing to fit an electric
 stove, an oven, a sink, and a refrigerator in a tiny space.

>open fridge
 Opened.

>look in it
 There's nothing in the refrigerator-freezer.

>close it
 Closed.

>examine stove
 The stove has four burners, just enough for most marine cooking.
 However, for this trip the burners have been disconnected.  Thom
 always was paranoid.

>examine oven
 Close inspection shows you that the oven is without power, to prevent
 accidents.  It is closed.

>open it
 Opened.

>examine sink
 It is a square metal sink, about fourty centimeters by thirty
 centimeters.  It has one handle.

 Which handle do you mean, the throttle, the clutch, or the sink
 handle?

>look in it
 There's nothing in the sink.

 It is one of those single handles which control both cold and hot
 water.  Right now it is off.

 Turning the sink handle doesn't have any effect.

>look behind bar
 There's nothing behind the small bar.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go down
 Forward Stateroom
    Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet
 near the nose of the ship.  On the port wall is an open hanging
 locker, and across from it is the door to the forward head, standing
 open.  A small ladder to the south leads up to a door.
    The hanging locker seems to contain a safe.

>open panel with screwdriver
 You work the screwdriver under the panel and lean on it forcefully.
 The panel groans open.

>look in safe
 It's closed.

>look in panel
 There's nothing in the square panel.

>examine safe
 Squat, grey, metal.  It obviously requires a key to unlock it.  Part
 of the top of the safe is scarred with deep gouges which outline an
 open panel.

>unlock safe
 What do you want to unlock it with?

>search safe
 You find nothing of interest.

>look in safe
 It's closed.

>get panel
 %You'll% need more than your bare fingers to remove the panel.

>get panel with screwdriver
 You work the screwdriver under the panel and lean on it forcefully.
 The panel groans open.

>examine safe
 Squat, grey, metal.  It obviously requires a key to unlock it.  Part
 of the top of the safe is scarred with deep gouges which outline an
 open panel.

>look in safe
 It's closed.

>examine panel
 Peering in the panel only deepens the mystery of the safe.  You can
 clearly see mechanical workings of some sort, and deep inside a
 battery.  An electrically-opened safe?  Two contacts jut up from the
 safe's innards.

>open radio
 Opening the portable radio reveals a nine-volt battery.

>take battery
 Taken.

>put battery in panel
 Done.

>examine panel
 Peering in the panel only deepens the mystery of the safe.  You can
 clearly see mechanical workings of some sort, and deep inside a

 safe's innards.

>examine contacts
 The electrical contacts stick up from the workings of the safe.

>get battery
 Taken.

>put battery in contacts
 You can't put anything into the contacts.

>put battery on contacts
 There's no good surface on the contacts.

>connect battery to contacts
 Don't worry about the safe battery.

>inventory
 You have a pill bottle, a portable radio, a pair of wires, a
 screwdriver, and a nine-volt battery.  The pill bottle seems to
 contain five little pills.

>connect radio battery to contacts
 There appear to be extra words after your command.

>examine safe battery
 No doubt used to power the workings of the safe.

>put nine-volt battery in contacts
 You can't put anything into the contacts.

>examine battery
 Which battery do you mean, the nine-volt battery, or the safe battery?

>connect nine-volt battery to contacts
 There's no need to do that to the battery and the contacts.

>take nine-volt
 Taken.

>examine contacts
 The electrical contacts stick up from the workings of the safe.

>put nine-volt in contacts
 You can't put anything into the contacts.

>attach nine-volt to contacts
 There's no need to do that to the battery and the contacts.

>inventory
 You have a pill bottle, a portable radio, a pair of wires, a
 screwdriver, and a nine-volt battery.  The pill bottle seems to
 contain five little pills.

 The panel is already open.

>examine safe door
 I don't see any safe door here.

>examine safe
 Squat, grey, metal.  It obviously requires a key to unlock it.  Part
 of the top of the safe is scarred with deep gouges which outline an
 open panel.

 You are rudely interrupted by the explosion of the *Bellerophon*.  As
 you are flung into the air, you find yourself futilely wondering who
 caused the explosion.

 How did Thom ever talk you into this one...

 Your friend Thom Hall has always been a smooth talker, which is
 probably how he got you to attend his party on board the
 *Bellerophon*.  The fourty-eight-foot yacht is named after the H.M.S.
 Bellerophon, the ship on which Napoleon formally surrendered in 1815
 after Waterloo.  Thom isn't usually too modest.

 Anyway, you're now stuck at a floating party with three other people
 you barely know, friends of Thom's.  Bill Leveritt is one of Thom's
 partners in his architectural firm.  Carl Weathers, another old friend
 of Thom's, brought his girlfriend Ashleigh Flannagin, which completes
 the floating fivesome.

 So far you've seen Bill and Thom yell at each other, Thom hit Carl for
 some unexplained reason, and Ashleigh ignore both Thom and you.  Not
 the most pleasant party you've ever been to.

 And it's barely 10 a.m...

 Forward Stateroom
    Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet
 near the nose of the ship.  On the port wall is a hanging locker, and
 across from it is the door to the forward head, standing open.  A
 small ladder to the south leads up to a door.
    Sitting on the left v-berth is a pill bottle.

>get bottle

>examine berth
 Which berth do you mean, the left v-berth, or the right v-berth?

>left
 The left v-berth looks to be comfortable, but has no sheets on it.

>examine right
 The right v-berth is barely long enough for a tall person, and lacks
 sheets.

>look under left
 There's nothing under the left v-berth.

>look under right
 There's nothing under the right v-berth.

>examine locker
>go south
 Almost two meters high, the hanging locker is big, especially when you
 consider the size of everything else aboard the *Bellerophon*.  It was
 built so clothes could hang freely inside of it.  The locker is
 closed.

 Forecastle
    The forecastle of the boat is surprisingly comfortable despite its
 small size.  The helm controls, including the wheel, are mounted on
 the fore wall, next to a chest-of-drawers which sports a lamp.  Across
 from the chest and beside the west entrance is the galley; between the
 galley and the helm is a companionway to the fore stateroom.  Also on
 the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is
 a dinette bench.  Windows are at each of the cardinal directions.  The
 west entranceway is open, as is the companionway to the north.
    Sitting on the small bar is a drink tray.

 With a large sigh, Carl sits down on the bench.

>go west
 Port of Forecastle
    The flying bridge rises above you, its canopy rippling slightly in
 the wind. To the east, an open door flanked by windows leads into the
 forecastle.  To the northeast you can see the foredeck; to the south
 are the aft sections of the boat.
    Ashleigh is briskly walking through here.

 Ashleigh leaves to the east.

>go south
 Port of Stateroom
    You stand on the deck of the boat, just to port of the aft
 stateroom.  Its roof curves across the boat, and a ladder leads to the
 roof and then to the flying bridge.  Beside the ladder, windows open
 into the stateroom.  To starboard is the rail, standing sentinel
 between you and the cerulean water.  The boat runs beneath your feet
 from the north to the southeast.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

 Cockpit Deck
    The cockpit deck houses the twin diesel engines which power the
 boat.  A large access panel in the deck allows for any necessary
 engine maintenance.  On the stern, a flagstaff juts skyward, the stern
 light perched atop it like a squat bird.  The door leading down into
 the aft stateroom yawns widely.  Small windows flank the door.  Tied
 to a cleat on the port side is a line.  To the northeast and northwest
 is the remainder of the boat.

>go northeast
 Starboard of Stateroom
    From where you are, only a thin rail stands between you and the
 water to starboard.  A roof, much more substantial than the rail and
 belonging to the aft stateroom, lies to port, stretching from here to
 the port side of the boat. Small windows gape in the stateroom's side.
 Two-thirds of the boat lie to the north, while the other one-third of
 the boat is to the southwest.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

 Through them, you can see the aft stateroom.

    Squeezed inside the aft stateroom are two single berths, one on
 either side of the stateroom, and a dresser.  The north door to the
 aft head is open.  A short ladder leads up to the open south door.

 The dresser takes up much of the room available in the aft stateroom.
 It is situated between the right berth and the ladder that leads up,
 and has three drawers.

 Aft Head
    Against one wall of the aft head crouches a small toilet.  On the
 port wall is a sink and mirror, while the starboard wall sports the
 unbelievable luxury of a full bathtub.  Built into the floor is a
 panel, which is closed.  The open door to the south leads to the aft
 stateroom.

>examine tub
 A bathtub is not standard issue on most boats.  In this case, it's one
 of the many ways Thom shows you how much money he has.  It is plastic,
 to reduce its weight, and it has a single handle, much like the sink.
 Its stopper is missing.

>go up
 You can't go that way.

 Carl suddenly shows up.  "Right, I need you on the flying deck.
 C'mon."  He grabs you by the arm and begins dragging you.  You have no
 real choice but to follow him.

 "What is it?" you ask him en route.

 "Thom.  We've found him dead."

 Flying Bridge
    From up here, the skipper of the boat has an almost unobstructed
 view of the waters in any direction.  The wind whispers around the
 canopy's poles and past you on its journey.  Beyond the helm, through
 the windscreen, you can see the bow of the boat.  Further away is
 land, quite some distance away to the northeast.  A chair sits in
 front of the helm.  Towards the stern, a ladder leads down.
    Bill slumps here quietly.
    Carl is looking at the helm, thinking.
    Ashleigh is standing here, obviously a bit disturbed.

 Bill says, "Um, ok, Carl, what now?"

 Carl looks at the controls.  "I'd best man the anchor."  He looks at
 you, then at Bill.  Finally, "Bill, I want you to go to the cockpit
 deck and take care of the line Thom's attached to.  I want you," he
 turns to Ashleigh, "to relay my instructions to Bill, and I want you,"
 he turns to you, "to throttle back when I say so.  Look over the
 helm."  He makes a few adjustments to the helm, then nods to himself.

>examine canopy
 The large canopy arches overhead, its blue fabric blocking the sun's
 terrible glare.

 Bill climbs down the ladder and is gone.

 Carl climbs down the ladder and is gone.

>wait
 Time passes...

>go down
 Ashleigh moves in front of you, blocking you.  "What the hell are you
 doing?  You have to run the helm!  Stay here!"

>kiss Ashleigh
 I don't know the word "kiss".

>wait
 Time passes...

 From below, Carl yells at you, "Pull the throttle back to idle."

>pull throttle
 You pull the throttle back to idling speed.  You hear the engines slow
 down.

>wait
 Time passes...

>push throttle
 You push the throttle forward to very slow speed.  You hear the
 engines rev up to a higher pitch.

>push throttle
 You push the throttle forward to one-quarter speed.  You hear the
 engines rev up to a higher pitch.

>push throttle
 You push the throttle forward to half speed.  You hear the engines rev
 up to a higher pitch.

>push throttle
 You push the throttle forward to three-quarters speed.  You hear the
 engines rev up to a higher pitch.

>push throttle
 You push the throttle forward to full speed.  You hear the engines rev
 up to a higher pitch.

 Asheligh looks at you, then at the helm, then back at you.  Then she
 grimaces.  "You want something done..." she mutters as she pulls the
 throttle back.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Carl yells, "Ok, reverse the engines!"

>examine controls
 I don't see any controls here.

>examine helm
 The helm is amazingly complex, with gagues for RPMs, temperature,
 amperage...the mind boggles.  On the right side of the helm are two
 levers:  the throttle handle and the clutch handle.  The throttle is
 taller than and to the right of the clutch handle.  In the middle of
 the helm is a large wooden wheel.

 Turn it left or right?

>left
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>turn wheel left
 You give the wheel a quick tug to the left.  The bow begins to swing
 to port.

>again
 You give the wheel a quick tug to the left.  The bow begins to swing
 to port.

 Muttering to herself, Ashleigh pulls the clutch back.  You hear the
 engines reverse.

>turn wheel right
 You spin the wheel to the right.  The stern begins to swing to
 starboard.

 Carl shouts up at you, "Push the throttle to one-quarter."

>turn wheel right
 You spin the wheel to the right.  The stern begins to swing to
 starboard.

>push throttle
 You push the throttle forward to very slow speed.  You hear the

 Ashleigh laughs, a deep throaty sound.  "Sometimes I wonder how I ever
 dated him."

>ask ashleigh about bill
 Ashleigh says, "I don't know much about that."

>ask ashleigh about carl
 Carl is no longer here.

>ask ashleigh about ashleigh
 Ashleigh is no longer here.

 Carl yells, "Ok, I need you to shut off the...oh, screw it.  Ash, kill
 the engines!  And tell Bill to try pulling Thom in now."

 Ashleigh moves to the helm, leaving you to yell Carl's instructions to
 Bill.  "Oh, er, right!" he yells back.

    Lying on the deck is Thom's body.
    Bill slumps here quietly.
    Ashleigh stands almost motionless, constantly glancing at Thom's
 body.
    Carl stands here, hands in his pockets.

 Carl glances at poor Thom and shakes his head.  "Poor bastard," he
 whispers.

 Bill glances nervously at everyone.  "Uh, what now?"

 Ashleigh laughs sourly.  "We sail back into port."

 You nod in agreement, then say, "Who'll pilot the boat?"

 After a few seconds of silence, Carl speaks up.  "That would be me.
 I'll run back to the flying bridge."

>search body
 As disgusting as it is, you riffle through Thom's pockets.  Nothing.

 Carl leaves to the northwest.

 Ashleigh shakes her head.  "Nothing to do but go back to the fo'cle
 and wait."

>body
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine body
 No matter how often you hated Thom for one thing or another, you
 certainly didn't want to see him dead like this.  His face is a
 strange purple color.  Along one side of his head, just under his wet
 hair, is a nasty bruise, slowly darkening.  One of his hands is
 clenched tight, tight enough to drive his fingernails into his palm.
 Looped complexly around his leg is a length of line.

 Bill leaves to the northwest.

 Ashleigh leaves to the northwest.

 Forecastle
    The forecastle of the boat is surprisingly comfortable despite its
 small size.  The helm controls, including the wheel, are mounted on
 the fore wall, next to a chest-of-drawers which sports a lamp.  Across
 from the chest and beside the west entrance is the galley; between the
 galley and the helm is a companionway to the fore stateroom.  Also on
 the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is
 a dinette bench.  Windows are at each of the cardinal directions.  The
 west entranceway is open, as is the companionway to the north.
    You see a purse here.  Sitting on the small bar is a drink tray.
    Bill slumps here quietly.
    Ashleigh is here, standing casually.

 Bill collapses onto the dinette bench.

 Ashleigh paces back and forth worriedly, then stops self-consciously.
 She grimaces to herself.

>look in purse
 It's closed.

 Ashleigh climbs down the ladder and is gone.

>open purse
 You open the bag, revealing the usual assortment of purse
 accoutrements...and a gun.

 Bill suddenly notices Ash's purse.  "Oh," he says, "Ashleigh's purse."
 He picks it up, sits back down, changes his mind, starts down the
 ladder to the fore stateroom, changes his mind again, and collapses on
 the dinette bench once more.

>get purse
 I don't see any purse here.

>ask bill about purse
 "I, uh, don't really know anything about it," Bill says.

>examine bill
 Bill Leveritt has been Thom's partner in their architectural firm for
 as long as you've known Thom.  Bill's thatch of thinning gray hair and
 round glasses make him look older than his forty-two years.  He tries
 to dress flamboyantly but often fails, as demonstrated today by his
 long-sleeved blue oxford shirt.  He's extremely good at what he does,
 but he is very unassuming; Thom is the talker of the firm.  In one
 hand he is holding one of his ubiquitous glasses of whiskey.

>wait

 Ashleigh arrives, climbing up the ladder.

>wait

 Bill hands Ash's purse to her.  "Here," he says, "you dropped this."

 Ashleigh turns an odd shade of red: you can't tell if she's
 embarassed, mad, or worried.  "Thanks," she finally says.

>ask ashleigh about purse
 Ashleigh says, "I don't know much about that."

 Carl arrives from the west.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Ashleigh looks up at Carl, sensing that something's wrong.  "What's
 up?"  she asks Carl.

 He runs his hands distractedly through his curly hair.  "Ok," he
 finally says.  "Here's what we've got going on.  Someone's sabotaged
 the engines, and I don't think I can fix them.  I'll get on the radio
 and get someone here to help us.  Until that happens, though, we're
 stuck."

 "Great!"  Bill says.  "Just great!  We're stuck on Thom's rotten boat
 with Thom's rotten body and one of us killed him!"  He downs his
 whiskey in one gulp as he jumps to his feet.

>wait
 Time passes...

 With a disgusted shake of his head, Carl moves to the radio and begins
 calling for help.

 Ashleigh, on the other hand, watches Bill for a few seconds before
 moving to him and slapping him for all she's worth.  Bill stops
 completely: he has no idea how to react.

 "Listen here, you pompous ass," Ash hisses at him, "none of us are
 particularly happy right now.  But you're not helping.  Stop it."

 After a long few seconds of staring, Bill turns and pours himself
 another whiskey.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Bill leaves to the west.

 Carl turns from the radio.  "Way to tell him," he says softly to
 Ashleigh, glancing at you as if to see if you agree.  Ashleigh,
 however, grimaces.

 "I didn't mean to yell at him like that.  It's just...I mean..."  Her
 sentence trails off.

 Carl looks at her for almost half a minute, doubt showing on his face.
 Finally, "I think I'll go check the engines.  Gives me something to
 do, anyway."

 aft head is open.  A short ladder leads up to the open south door.

>go up
 Cockpit Deck
    The cockpit deck houses the twin diesel engines which power the
 boat.  A large access panel in the deck has been opened for access to
 the engines.  On the stern, a flagstaff juts skyward, the stern light
 perched atop it like a squat bird.  The door leading down into the aft
 stateroom yawns widely.  Small windows flank the door.  Tied to a
 cleat on the port side is a line.  To the northeast and northwest is
 the remainder of the boat.
    Lying on the deck is Thom's body.
    Carl is peering in the engines, pondering possibilities.

 As you clear the aft stateroom, you see a flash of color over the
 rail.  You can't quite tell, but it looks like a rag.

>examine color
 I don't know the word "color".

>examine rag
 You can't quite see the rag--it's hung on something about a meter
 down, just above the water.  You're surprised it hasn't been washed
 away.

>go northwest
 Port of Stateroom
    You stand on the deck of the boat, just to port of the aft
 stateroom.  Its roof curves across the boat, and a ladder leads to the
 roof and then to the flying bridge.  Beside the ladder, windows open
 into the stateroom.  To starboard is the rail, standing sentinel
 between you and the cerulean water.  The boat runs beneath your feet
 from the north to the southeast.

>inventory
 You have a pill bottle, a portable radio, a pair of wires, and a
 screwdriver.

>go north
 Port of Forecastle
    The flying bridge rises above you, its canopy rippling slightly in
 the wind. To the east, an open door flanked by windows leads into the
 forecastle.  To the northeast you can see the foredeck; to the south
 are the aft sections of the boat.

>go east
 Forecastle
    The forecastle of the boat is surprisingly comfortable despite its
 small size.  The helm controls, including the wheel, are mounted on
 the fore wall, next to a chest-of-drawers which sports a lamp.  Across
 from the chest and beside the west entrance is the galley; between the
 galley and the helm is a companionway to the fore stateroom.  Also on
 the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is
 a dinette bench.  Windows are at each of the cardinal directions.  The
 west entranceway is open, as is the companionway to the north.
    Sitting on the small bar is a drink tray.
    Ashleigh is here, standing pensively.

>go down
 Forward Stateroom
    Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet
 near the nose of the ship.  On the port wall is an open hanging
 locker, and across from it is the door to the forward head, standing
 open.  A small ladder to the south leads up to a door.
    The hanging locker seems to contain a safe.

>open panel with screwdriver
 You work the screwdriver under the panel and lean on it forcefully.
 The panel groans open.

>examine panel
 Peering in the panel only deepens the mystery of the safe.  You can
 clearly see mechanical workings of some sort, and deep inside a
 battery.  An electrically-opened safe?  Two contacts jut up from the
 safe's innards.

>examine battery
 No doubt used to power the workings of the safe.

>get it
 Don't worry about the safe battery.

>open radio
 Opening the portable radio reveals a nine-volt battery.

>get nine-volt
 Taken.

>tie wires to nine-volt
 You attach the battery to the pair of wires with a few quick turns of
 each wire.

>tie wires to contacts
 You touch the wires to the contacts.  Motors whir as the safe springs
 open, its regular locking mechanism bypassed.

>look in safe
 In the safe you see a small key, a note, some pictures, and some
 letters.

>SAVE

 Unremarkable, even as small metal keys go.

>examine note
 The note is scrawled in Thom's handwriting.

>read it
 The note reads, "Thom, the key's in your pocket, stupid."

>examine pictures
 The pictures are of Carl and some woman other than Ashleigh in very
 compromising positions.

>examine letters
 The letters are from Carl to Thom.

>read letters
 Reading them, you quickly figure out that Thom was blackmailing Carl.

>go northeast
 Foredeck
    The foredeck is as far forward on the *Bellerophon* as you can go
 and still be on the boat.  The bow rail keeps you from going
 overboard, lucky for you.  At your feet lies a small elliptical hole
 leading to the chain locker below.  Out of the hole runs the anchor
 chain.  Behind you loom the windows to the forecastle.  The rest of
 the yacht lies to the southwest and southeast.
    Bill is leaning against the bow rail.

 Bill stares at the pictures in confusion.  "Uh, so?"  he says.

>show letters to bill
 Bill stares at the letters in confusion.  "Uh, so?"  he says.

 Starboard of Forecastle
    Above you and to port rises the flying bridge, casting a cold
 shadow across you.  Also to port are the curtained windows which
 afford you a glimpse into the forecastle.  At your feet lies a closed
 compartment.  The boat continues to the northwest and south.

>unlock compartment with key
 Unlocked.

>open it
 Opening the compartment reveals a long pole.

>examine pole
 The wooden pole is about two meters long and terminates in a curved
 hook.  No doubt Thom used it for retrieving things he dropped in the
 water.

>get pole
 Taken.

>go south
 Starboard of Stateroom
    From where you are, only a thin rail stands between you and the
 water to starboard.  A roof, much more substantial than the rail and
 belonging to the aft stateroom, lies to port, stretching from here to
 the port side of the boat. Small windows gape in the stateroom's side.
 Two-thirds of the boat lie to the north, while the other one-third of
 the boat is to the southwest.

 You can't go that way.

>get rag with pole
 It takes you a few seconds to snag the rag, but once you have it,
 dragging it on deck is almost anticlimactic.  Now that it's on deck,
 you can tell that the rag is actually a shirt.

>examine shirt
 If this shirt doesn't belong to Bill, it's certainly a dead ringer for
 the one he had on earlier.  The right sleeve is torn and slightly
 blood-stained.

>get shirt

 Your speech is cut short by the muzzle of a revolver.  It must be
 Ashleigh's.  How did he get Ash's gun?  You don't have a lot of time
 to think about that, however, as Bill interrupts you.  "Shut up!  Just

 How did Thom ever talk you into this one...

 Your friend Thom Hall has always been a smooth talker, which is
 probably how he got you to attend his party on board the
 *Bellerophon*.  The fourty-eight-foot yacht is named after the H.M.S.
 Bellerophon, the ship on which Napoleon formally surrendered in 1815
 after Waterloo.  Thom isn't usually too modest.

 Anyway, you're now stuck at a floating party with three other people
 you barely know, friends of Thom's.  Bill Leveritt is one of Thom's
 partners in his architectural firm.  Carl Weathers, another old friend
 of Thom's, brought his girlfriend Ashleigh Flannagin, which completes
 the floating fivesome.

 So far you've seen Bill and Thom yell at each other, Thom hit Carl for
 some unexplained reason, and Ashleigh ignore both Thom and you.  Not
 the most pleasant party you've ever been to.

 And it's barely 10 a.m...

 Forward Head
    The forward head sports a small toilet, a sink, and a miniscule
 shower.  In the floor is a small drain; above the sink, a mirror and
 medicine cabinet.  A closed door leads west.

 Forward Stateroom
    Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet
 near the nose of the ship.  On the port wall is a hanging locker, and
 across from it is the door to the forward head, standing open.  A
 small ladder to the south leads up to a door.
    Sitting on the left v-berth is a pill bottle.

 Bill arrives from the south.

 Carl leaves to the east.

>examine bill
 Bill Leveritt has been Thom's partner in their architectural firm for
 as long as you've known Thom.  Bill's thatch of thinning gray hair and
 round glasses make him look older than his forty-two years.  He tries
 to dress flamboyantly but often fails, as demonstrated today by his
 long-sleeved blue oxford shirt.  He's extremely good at what he does,
 but he is very unassuming; Thom is the talker of the firm.

 Bill leaves to the east.

 Bill wanders over to the drink tray and picks up the whiskey bottle.
 From somewhere around the bar, he scrounges up a slightly-clean glass.
 With a deft flick of his wrist, he pours himself a shot of the whiskey
 and replaces the bottle.  "I've always, er, liked whiskey," he
 comments.

 Ashleigh arrives from the west.

>ask bill about whiskey
 "I, uh, don't really know anything about it," Bill says.

 Ashleigh sits down next to Carl and whispers something to him.  He
 grins slightly in response.

 I don't see any pictures here.

 You have a pill bottle.  The pill bottle seems to contain five little
 pills.

 forecastle.  To the northeast you can see the foredeck; to the south
 are the aft sections of the boat.

>go south
 Port of Stateroom
    You stand on the deck of the boat, just to port of the aft
 stateroom.  Its roof curves across the boat, and a ladder leads to the
 roof and then to the flying bridge.  Beside the ladder, windows open
 into the stateroom.  To starboard is the rail, standing sentinel
 between you and the cerulean water.  The boat runs beneath your feet
 from the north to the southeast.

>se
 Cockpit Deck
    The cockpit deck houses the twin diesel engines which power the
 boat.  A large access panel in the deck allows for any necessary
 engine maintenance.  On the stern, a flagstaff juts skyward, the stern
 light perched atop it like a squat bird.  The door leading down into
 the aft stateroom yawns widely.  Small windows flank the door.  Tied
 to a cleat on the port side is a line.  To the northeast and northwest
 is the remainder of the boat.

>go down
 Aft Stateroom
    Squeezed inside the aft stateroom are two single berths, one on
 either side of the stateroom, and a dresser.  The north door to the

 Aft Head
    Against one wall of the aft head crouches a small toilet.  On the
 port wall is a sink and mirror, while the starboard wall sports the
 unbelievable luxury of a full bathtub.  Built into the floor is a
 panel, which is closed.  The open door to the south leads to the aft
 stateroom.

 From somewhere outside you hear Bill yell, "Oh, my God!  Quick!
 Everyone to the cockpit deck!  It's Thom!"

 Cockpit Deck
    The cockpit deck houses the twin diesel engines which power the

 is the remainder of the boat.
    Bill is tugging with all his might on the line.

>pull line
 You tug on the line as hard as you can, but something is weighing it
 down.  Glancing over the rail, you see a dark shape in the water.

 Carl arrives from the northwest.

 Ashleigh arrives from the northwest.

>open radio
 Opening the portable radio reveals a nine-volt battery.

 Carl grabs hold of the line and strains in concert with Bill.  You
 slide in between them and put your back into the effort, but to no
 avail.  After a few seconds, Carl stops, swearing.

 Bill says, "The four of us won't be able to drag Thom on board while
 we're, uh, moving."

 Ashleigh nods in agreement.  "We've got to cut the engines."  You find
 yourself wondering just who this "we" are--you surely don't want to
 monkey around with Thom's boat.  Not that he's going to care now, but
 habits are hard to break.

>take nine-volt
 Taken.

 Carl finally convinces himself that he won't be able to drag Thom
 onboard.  You would have been glad to explain it to him, but no doubt
 that would have taken one minute shy of eternity.  He glances at the
 three of you.

 "C'mon," he says, "I need you three on the flying bridge.  I'll
 explain up there, right?"

>go northwest
 Port of Stateroom
    You stand on the deck of the boat, just to port of the aft

 Bill arrives from the southeast.

 Ashleigh arrives from the southeast.

>go up
 Flying Bridge
    From up here, the skipper of the boat has an almost unobstructed
 view of the waters in any direction.  The wind whispers around the
 canopy's poles and past you on its journey.  Beyond the helm, through
 the windscreen, you can see the bow of the boat.  Further away is
 land, quite some distance away to the northeast.  A chair sits in
 front of the helm.  Towards the stern, a ladder leads down.

 Bill arrives, climbing up the ladder.

 Carl arrives, climbing up the ladder.

 Ashleigh arrives, climbing up the ladder.

>tie wires to nine-volt
 You attach the battery to the pair of wires with a few quick turns of
 each wire.

 Bill says, "Um, ok, Carl, what now?"

 Carl looks at the controls.  "I'd best man the anchor."  He looks at
 you, then at Bill.  Finally, "Bill, I want you to go to the cockpit
 deck and take care of the line Thom's attached to.  I want you," he
 turns to Ashleigh, "to relay my instructions to Bill, and I want you,"
 he turns to you, "to throttle back when I say so.  Look over the
 helm."  He makes a few adjustments to the helm, then nods to himself.

>look south
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine cockpit
 I don't see any cockpit here.

>ask carl about helm
 Carl says, "Hmm, can't tell you too much about that!"

 Bill climbs down the ladder and is gone.

 Ashleigh moves to the helm, leaving you to yell Carl's instructions to
 Bill.  "Oh, er, right!" he yells back.

 to a cleat on the port side is a line.  To the northeast and northwest
 is the remainder of the boat.
    Lying on the deck is Thom's body.
    Bill slumps here quietly.
    Ashleigh stands almost motionless, constantly glancing at Thom's
 body.

 Carl arrives from the northwest.

>examine bill
 Bill Leveritt has been Thom's partner in their architectural firm for
 as long as you've known Thom.  Bill's thatch of thinning gray hair and
 round glasses make him look older than his forty-two years.  He tries
 to dress flamboyantly but often fails, as demonstrated today by his
 long-sleeved blue oxford shirt.  He's extremely good at what he does,
 but he is very unassuming; Thom is the talker of the firm.  In one
 hand he is holding one of his ubiquitous glasses of whiskey.

 Carl glances at poor Thom and shakes his head.  "Poor bastard," he
 whispers.

 Bill glances nervously at everyone.  "Uh, what now?"

 Ashleigh laughs sourly.  "We sail back into port."

 You nod in agreement, then say, "Who'll pilot the boat?"

 After a few seconds of silence, Carl speaks up.  "That would be me.
 I'll run back to the flying bridge."

>examine body
 No matter how often you hated Thom for one thing or another, you
 certainly didn't want to see him dead like this.  His face is a
 strange purple color.  Along one side of his head, just under his wet
 hair, is a nasty bruise, slowly darkening.  One of his hands is
 clenched tight, tight enough to drive his fingernails into his palm.
 Looped complexly around his leg is a length of line.

 Carl leaves to the northwest.

 Ashleigh shakes her head.  "Nothing to do but go back to the fo'cle
 and wait."

 accoutrements...and a gun.

 Ashleigh climbs down the ladder and is gone.

 everyone will think YOU killed Thom.

 Bill suddenly notices Ash's purse.  "Oh," he says, "Ashleigh's purse."
 He picks it up, sits back down, changes his mind, starts down the

 the fore wall, next to a chest-of-drawers which sports a lamp.  Across
 from the chest and beside the west entrance is the galley; between the
 galley and the helm is a companionway to the fore stateroom.  Also on
 the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is
 a dinette bench.  Windows are at each of the cardinal directions.  The
 west entranceway is open, as is the companionway to the north.
    Sitting on the small bar is a drink tray.
    Bill is slumped in the dinette bench.

 Ashleigh arrives, climbing up the ladder.

>examine bill
 Bill Leveritt has been Thom's partner in their architectural firm for
 as long as you've known Thom.  Bill's thatch of thinning gray hair and
 round glasses make him look older than his forty-two years.  He tries
 to dress flamboyantly but often fails, as demonstrated today by his
 long-sleeved blue oxford shirt.  He's extremely good at what he does,
 but he is very unassuming; Thom is the talker of the firm.  In one
 hand he is holding one of his ubiquitous glasses of whiskey.

 Carl arrives from the west.

 Bill hands Ash's purse to her.  "Here," he says, "you dropped this."

 Ashleigh turns an odd shade of red: you can't tell if she's
 embarassed, mad, or worried.  "Thanks," she finally says.

>ask bill about purse
 "I, uh, don't really know anything about it," Bill says.

 Ashleigh looks up at Carl, sensing that something's wrong.  "What's
 up?"  she asks Carl.

 He runs his hands distractedly through his curly hair.  "Ok," he
 finally says.  "Here's what we've got going on.  Someone's sabotaged
 the engines, and I don't think I can fix them.  I'll get on the radio
 and get someone here to help us.  Until that happens, though, we're
 stuck."

 "Great!"  Bill says.  "Just great!  We're stuck on Thom's rotten boat
 with Thom's rotten body and one of us killed him!"  He downs his
 whiskey in one gulp as he jumps to his feet.

>ask bill about belts
 Which bill do you mean, Bill, or Bill?

>ask ash about belts
 Ashleigh says, "I don't know much about that."

 With a disgusted shake of his head, Carl moves to the radio and begins
 calling for help.

 Ashleigh, on the other hand, watches Bill for a few seconds before
 moving to him and slapping him for all she's worth.  Bill stops
 completely: he has no idea how to react.

 "Listen here, you pompous ass," Ash hisses at him, "none of us are
 particularly happy right now.  But you're not helping.  Stop it."

 After a long few seconds of staring, Bill turns and pours himself
 another whiskey.

 Carl turns from the radio.  "Way to tell him," he says softly to
 Ashleigh, glancing at you as if to see if you agree.  Ashleigh,
 however, grimaces.

 "I didn't mean to yell at him like that.  It's just...I mean..."  Her
 sentence trails off.

 Carl looks at her for almost half a minute, doubt showing on his face.
 Finally, "I think I'll go check the engines.  Gives me something to
 do, anyway."

 Foredeck
    The foredeck is as far forward on the *Bellerophon* as you can go
 and still be on the boat.  The bow rail keeps you from going
 overboard, lucky for you.  At your feet lies a small elliptical hole
 leading to the chain locker below.  Out of the hole runs the anchor
 chain.  Behind you loom the windows to the forecastle.  The rest of
 the yacht lies to the southwest and southeast.
    Bill is leaning against the bow rail.

 slightly.  "Where did you...I mean, I don't know--"

 "C'mon," you say to Bill, "cut to the chase.  I know you were there
 when Thom...fell overboard.  Just tell me what hap--"

 Your speech is cut short by the muzzle of a revolver.  It must be
 Ashleigh's.  How did he get Ash's gun?  You don't have a lot of time
 to think about that, however, as Bill interrupts you.  "Shut up!  Just
 shut up!  I don't have to listen to you!"  Bill is clearly skating
 over the thin ice of insanity.  He prods you in your side with the
 revolver.  "Let's find the others."  He pushes you ahead of him.

>open bottle
 Bill puts a restraining hand on your shoulder, stopping you.
 "Ashleigh," he says.

 "What?" she asks irritably, looking up into the muzzle of the
 revolver.  "Hey!" she says.  "My gun!"

 "Shut up!" Bill shouts.  "Just shut up!  All of you!"  His eyes are
 wide, his face sweat-slick.  "Move over there together!"  All three of
 you comply.

 "He wasn't supposed to..."  Bill clears his throat, mopping his face
 with his left hand.  "Thom was embezzling from our firm.  I would have
 been bankrupted.  I only found out yesterday.  When I confronted him
 with it, he laughed at me.  You saw us shouting.  What an idiot I
 was."  He laughs quietly, but there's an edge of desperation to his
 laughter.

 "And when I confronted him with it again, he told me there was no
 proof.  I showed it to him.  He never was as clever as he thought he
 was.  He tried to grab it, I shoved him back..."  His eyes dart around
 the room.  "He wasn't supposed to fall overboard!  It was an
 accident!"

 You've been transfixed by the fact that Bill was able to say all that
 without one "uh" or "ah," but Carl has been inching closer.  It looks
 like he's about to try to jump Bill; if you don't distract Bill, Carl
 won't stand a chance.

>show pictures to bill
 Bill points the gun at you.  "Don't move!  Don't move!"  You freeze,
 hoping you've distracted him enough, but knowing that you haven't.

 Carl decided that now's his best chance, and he jumps towards Bill.
 Bill jerks back, swinging the revolver around and firing in the same
 motion.

 The smell of cordite fills the air as Ashleigh screams.  Carl's eyes
 widen almost comically, and he staggers back, blood spurting from a
 newly-formed hole approximately in the middle of his chest.  Bill
 fires again, then again, more of a reflex action than anything else.
 You try to grab the gun from Bill, but he backhands you with it.
 "Shut up, Ashleigh!" he yells at Ash.  Surprisingly, she stops.

 Bill looks around wildly, then makes a decision.  "Drag him into the
 stateroom, both of you."

 "Let me at least get one of the drinks for their wounds," Ash begs of
 Bill.  He nods slightly, glancing nervously around the forecastle.
 Ashleigh grabs the whiskey bottle.

 You take hold of one of Carl's arms; Ashleigh grabs the other, looking
 distinctly queasy.  The two of you drag Carl into the stateroom,
 leaving Bill behind to mutter to himself about his nerves and how they
 need calming.

 Forward Stateroom
    Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet

 locker, and across from it is the door to the forward head, standing

 Carl is as surprised as Bill and Ashleigh, but he recovers more
 quickly and leaps at Bill.  Bill turns and fires in the same motion.

 The smell of cordite fills the air, and Carl's leap turns into a
 stumble as the revolver bullet furrows into his left leg.  He lets out
 a long, drawn-out scream.  Bill and Ashleigh are shocked into
 immobility.  You make a grab for Bill's gun, but he still possesses
 the presence of mind to backhand you viciously with it.

 Bill looks around wildly, then makes a decision.  "Drag him into the

 You take hold of one of Carl's arms; Ashleigh grabs the other, looking
 distinctly queasy.  The two of you drag Carl into the stateroom,
 leaving Bill behind to mutter to himself about his nerves and how they
 need calming.

 Forward Stateroom
    Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet
 near the nose of the ship.  On the port wall is an open hanging
 locker, and across from it is the door to the forward head, standing
 open.  A small ladder to the south leads up to a door.
    The hanging locker seems to contain a safe.
    Carl lies here, in shock from the wound to his leg.
    Ashleigh is sitting beside Carl, tending to his wound.

>go up
 You'll have to open the south door first.

 Ashleigh dribbles some of the whiskey onto Carl's leg.  He screams,
 then mercifully passes out.  "It'll be ok, it'll be ok," she whispers
 to him, dropping the bottle.

>put pills in whiskey bottle
 I don't see any pills here.

>inventory
 You have a pill bottle, a portable radio, a pair of wires, a
 screwdriver, a small key, a note, some pictures, some letters, a long
 pole, and a blue shirt.

>open botlte
 I don't know the word "botlte".

 Opening the pill bottle reveals five little pills.

>go south
 No matter how hard you try, you can't open it.  Bill must have wedged
 something against it.

>hit door

>go south
 All that would do would be to reduce your frustration at the expense
 of something which isn't yours.  Besides, you would probably hurt
 yourself.

 It is bolted to the wall just above the sink.  It is made of strong
 plastic, and is closed.

>open it
 Opened.

 You hear the companionway between the stateroom and the forecastle
 being unblocked and opened.  A few seconds later, you hear Bill's
 voice.  "Where's the whiskey, Ashleigh?"

 Ashleigh stammers, "What--why do you--what--"

 "Where is it!?!"  he screams, totally out of control now.

    Bill, more tense than you've ever seen him, is waving around a gun.

 As you enter, Bill swivels around.  "You!" he screams at you.  You
 hand over the whiskey bottle without a word.  He upends the bottle and
 drains it in one draught.  Bill's eyes suddenly close, much to his
 surprise.  The muzzle of the gun traces an arc to the floor.
 "Sleepy," he mumbles, just before he drops the gun and crumples to the
 floor.

 You are left with Ashleigh and Carl's unconscious body to wait for
 someone to pick you up.

 In just under an hour, a Coast Guard ship pulls alongside the
 *Bellerophon*.  All you can think is, why did they take so long?  The
 three of you are taken in for questioning, and Bill is turned over to
 the police.  You were fortunate enough to stop Bill before he could
 kill Carl, even though Carl will limp a bit for the rest of his life.
 You ferreted out the connection between Carl, Thom, and those
 pictures; but you never found out why Ashleigh was carrying that gun.
 All in all, a good showing.

 Thank you for playing Undertow.

 How did Thom ever talk you into this one...

 Your friend Thom Hall has always been a smooth talker, which is
 probably how he got you to attend his party on board the
 *Bellerophon*.  The fourty-eight-foot yacht is named after the H.M.S.
 Bellerophon, the ship on which Napoleon formally surrendered in 1815
 after Waterloo.  Thom isn't usually too modest.

 Anyway, you're now stuck at a floating party with three other people
 you barely know, friends of Thom's.  Bill Leveritt is one of Thom's
 partners in his architectural firm.  Carl Weathers, another old friend
 of Thom's, brought his girlfriend Ashleigh Flannagin, which completes
 the floating fivesome.

 So far you've seen Bill and Thom yell at each other, Thom hit Carl for
 some unexplained reason, and Ashleigh ignore both Thom and you.  Not
 the most pleasant party you've ever been to.

 And it's barely 10 a.m...

 Cockpit Deck
    The cockpit deck houses the twin diesel engines which power the
 boat.  A large access panel in the deck has been opened for access to
 the engines.  On the stern, a flagstaff juts skyward, the stern light
 perched atop it like a squat bird.  The door leading down into the aft
 stateroom yawns widely.  Small windows flank the door.  Tied to a
 cleat on the port side is a line.  To the northeast and northwest is
 the remainder of the boat.
    Lying on the deck is Thom's body.
    Carl is peering in the engines, pondering possibilities.

 Foredeck
    The foredeck is as far forward on the *Bellerophon* as you can go
 and still be on the boat.  The bow rail keeps you from going
 overboard, lucky for you.  At your feet lies a small elliptical hole
 leading to the chain locker below.  Out of the hole runs the anchor
 chain.  Behind you loom the windows to the forecastle.  The rest of
 the yacht lies to the southwest and southeast.
    Bill is leaning against the bow rail.

>show shirt to bill
 Bill's eyes widen.  "Oh, my God," he whispers.  One eyebrow twitches
 slightly.  "Where did you...I mean, I don't know--"

 "C'mon," you say to Bill, "cut to the chase.  I know you were there
 when Thom...fell overboard.  Just tell me what hap--"

 Your speech is cut short by the muzzle of a revolver.  It must be
 Ashleigh's.  How did he get Ash's gun?  You don't have a lot of time
 to think about that, however, as Bill interrupts you.  "Shut up!  Just
 shut up!  I don't have to listen to you!"  Bill is clearly skating
 over the thin ice of insanity.  He prods you in your side with the
 revolver.  "Let's find the others."  He pushes you ahead of him.

>wait
 Before you can do anything, Carl has glanced up at you, then at Bill.
 "Yeah?" he asks, but your face tells him something's wrong.

 Bill is faster than both of you.  "Get in front of me.  Both of you.
 Let's go find Ashleigh."

 Forecastle
    The forecastle of the boat is surprisingly comfortable despite its
 small size.  The helm controls, including the wheel, are mounted on
 the fore wall, next to a chest-of-drawers which sports a lamp.  Across
 from the chest and beside the west entrance is the galley; between the
 galley and the helm is a companionway to the fore stateroom.  Also on
 the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is
 a dinette bench.  Windows are at each of the cardinal directions.  The
 west entranceway is open, as is the companionway to the north.
    Sitting on the small bar is a drink tray.
    Ashleigh is here, standing pensively.
    Carl is standing here, eyeing Bill and his gun.
    Bill, more tense than you've ever seen him, is waving around a gun.

>ask ashleigh about gun
 Bill puts a restraining hand on your shoulder, stopping you.
 "Ashleigh," he says.

 "What?" she asks irritably, looking up into the muzzle of the
 revolver.  "Hey!" she says.  "My gun!"

 "Shut up!" Bill shouts.  "Just shut up!  All of you!"  His eyes are
 wide, his face sweat-slick.  "Move over there together!"  All three of
 you comply.

 "He wasn't supposed to..."  Bill clears his throat, mopping his face
 with his left hand.  "Thom was embezzling from our firm.  I would have
 been bankrupted.  I only found out yesterday.  When I confronted him
 with it, he laughed at me.  You saw us shouting.  What an idiot I
 was."  He laughs quietly, but there's an edge of desperation to his
 laughter.

 "And when I confronted him with it again, he told me there was no
 proof.  I showed it to him.  He never was as clever as he thought he
 was.  He tried to grab it, I shoved him back..."  His eyes dart around
 the room.  "He wasn't supposed to fall overboard!  It was an
 accident!"

 You've been transfixed by the fact that Bill was able to say all that
 without one "uh" or "ah," but Carl has been inching closer.  It looks
 like he's about to try to jump Bill; if you don't distract Bill, Carl
 won't stand a chance.

>ask carl about ashleigh
 Bill points the gun at you.  "Don't move!  Don't move!"  You freeze,
 hoping you've distracted him enough, but knowing that you haven't.

 Carl decided that now's his best chance, and he jumps towards Bill.
 Bill jerks back, swinging the revolver around and firing in the same
 motion.

 The smell of cordite fills the air as Ashleigh screams.  Carl's eyes
 widen almost comically, and he staggers back, blood spurting from a
 newly-formed hole approximately in the middle of his chest.  Bill
 fires again, then again, more of a reflex action than anything else.
 You try to grab the gun from Bill, but he backhands you with it.
 "Shut up, Ashleigh!" he yells at Ash.  Surprisingly, she stops.

 Bill looks around wildly, then makes a decision.  "Drag him into the
 stateroom, both of you."

 "Let me at least get one of the drinks for their wounds," Ash begs of
 Bill.  He nods slightly, glancing nervously around the forecastle.
 Ashleigh grabs the whiskey bottle.

 You take hold of one of Carl's arms; Ashleigh grabs the other, looking
 distinctly queasy.  The two of you drag Carl into the stateroom,
 leaving Bill behind to mutter to himself about his nerves and how they

    Ashleigh is here, watching Bill's every move.
    Carl is taut, about to jump Bill.
    Bill, more tense than you've ever seen him, is waving around a gun.

>hit bill
 You make a very sudden move towards Bill, not the brightest thing to
 do to a nervous man with a gun.  Bill, however, is reluctant to shoot
 you.  "Don't try anything!"  he warns you in a high-pitched voice, the
 gun trembling in his grip.

 Carl is as surprised as Bill and Ashleigh, but he recovers more
 quickly and leaps at Bill.  Bill turns and fires in the same motion.

 The smell of cordite fills the air, and Carl's leap turns into a
 stumble as the revolver bullet furrows into his left leg.  He lets out
 a long, drawn-out scream.  Bill and Ashleigh are shocked into
 immobility.  You make a grab for Bill's gun, but he still possesses
 the presence of mind to backhand you viciously with it.

 Bill looks around wildly, then makes a decision.  "Drag him into the
 stateroom, both of you."

 "Let me at least get one of the drinks for their wounds," Ash begs of
 Bill.  He nods slightly, glancing nervously around the forecastle.

 "What?!?"  Ashleigh says.  "Okay!  So there's a gun in my purse!  So
 what?"  She pushes a lock of her copper hair out of her face.  "Yes, I
 wanted to kill him."  She laughs ruefully.  "Who didn't?  But you saw
 him.  He wasn't shot!"

 Ash sighs.  "He was ready to have me fired.  I just couldn't let
 him...he was going to..."  Her objections slowly wind down.  Then she
 looks back at you.  "But I didn't kill him!"

 Ash then grabs your shoulder, pleading.  "Please, please, don't tell
 Carl."

 dead.  Sure, I'd thought about it before, but..."  She stops talking,
