 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding.
 "That's a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says.
 "Let's have a look at it."


 (You'll find the envelope inside your Wishbringer package.)

 "Sure would like to get a closer look at that mysterious envelope."


 The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope.
 "Hmm," he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried
 that old woman years ago."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you
 soon."

 The old man ambles away to the west.

 use.)

 out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the
 tombstones winds off to the east.

 There must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their
 umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.

 The gravedigger is locking the iron gate from the outside as you
 approach. "Keep out of the cemetery after Dark," he tells you with a
 sly wink.

 You can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.

 Miss Voss hurries away down the street. "Thanks! Toody-loo!"

 Rotary South
 This is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south,
 towards Post Office Hill.

 The Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic
 artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner.

 Rotary East
 You're on the eastern side of the Festeron Rotary. A street branches
 off to the east, towards the bay.

 On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes
 and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance,
 and a marquee announces the current feature.

 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

 It looks like the perfect place to enjoy an old movie.

 The marquee shows an outline of your mean old boss, Mr. Crisp,
 triumphantly stepping on the face of a helpless mail clerk. Underneath
 are the words "Have You Delivered That Envelope Yet?" in big red
 letters.

 The movie theater is closed.

 Park
 You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron Rotary.
 Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain,
 filled with sparkling water.

 A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.

 You can see a gold coin and a goldfish in the fountain.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of

 The gold coin is etched with a profile of one of Festeron's founding
 fathers.

 You'd get soaked if you tried that!

 Pleasure Wharf
 You're standing near the entrance to the Pleasure Wharf, the town's
 most popular tourist attraction. The Wharf extends eastward into
 Festeron Bay, and a tidal beach curves north along the shore.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 (You don't need to use the word "shack" to finish this story.)

 Video Arcade
 This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op
 video games. The machines are all deserted and quiet, except for one in
 the corner that emits a feeble "wokka-wokka" sound.

 A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token."

 The game machine is equipped with a video screen, a joystick, a big red
 button and a narrow slot for tokens. A lurid logo ("LEATHER GODDESSES
 OF PHOBOS!") is painted on the side.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 The big mailbox seems ordinary enough.

 You'd have to open the big mailbox to do that.

 Okay, the big mailbox is now open.

 You can see nothing interesting inside the big mailbox.

 The lid of the big mailbox squeaks and snaps shut with a clang.

 But the big mailbox isn't open!

 Okay, the big mailbox is now open.

 Done.

 The lid of the big mailbox squeaks and snaps shut with a clang.

 Wharf's End
 The sea-worn planks of the Festeron Pleasure Wharf end abruptly a few
 feet to the east. You're surrounded by the blue, sparkling waters of
 Festeron Bay.

 Apparently a careless fisherman has just left the wharf, for lying on
 the planks is a little seahorse, its gills moving in and out with its
 dying gasps.

 The seahorse looks at you with moist, frightened eyes.

 Poor thing. It's at the edge of death.

 The seahorse opens and closes its little mouth pathetically.

 Taken.

 The seahorse's gills are barely moving. It's practically dead.

 Splash!

 The seahorse floats without moving for a few anxious moments. Then it
 springs suddenly to life, circling and splashing joyfully in the waves.
 Before it swims away it looks up at you with an unmistakable expression
 of gratitude.

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.

 To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick
 building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands
 invitingly open.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you.

 Okay, what do you want to do now?
 Post Office
 This is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with
 small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs
 along the entire length of the room.

 Your boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other
 people's postcards.

 Mr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. "Where have you been?"
 he barks angrily. "Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere
 for you!"

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 1 out of 100.)

 Mr. Crisp reaches under the service counter and pulls out a mysterious
 envelope. "We just got this Special Delivery," he snarls, tossing it
 onto the service counter. "I want you to drop it off right away. That
 means NOW!"

 What next?
 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 6 out of

 Mr. Crisp drums his fingers on the service counter impatiently. "Get

 As you leave the Post Office, somebody slams and locks the door behind
 you.

 What next?
 Outside Cemetery
 You're standing next to an open iron gate that leads west into the
 Festeron Cemetery. A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill.

 What next?
 The cemetery is a spooky place. Are you sure you want to go in there?


 You have been warned.

 Creepy Corner
 You're in a creepy corner of the Festeron Cemetery, surrounded by
 silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane
 wanders north.

 What next?
 Spooky Copse
 A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really
 spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.

 There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected
 next to it.

 An old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree.

 The gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach.

 What next?
 It's six feet deep and freshly dug. You can see an old bone inside.

 The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding. "That's
 a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says. "Let's
 have a look at it."

 What next?
 The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope. "Hmm,"
 he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried that old
 woman years ago."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 "Couldn't ask for a nicer day for diggin' graves."

 What next?
 You can't reach the old bone from here. The open grave is too deep.

 "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you
 soon."

 The old man ambles away to the west.

 (You won't see the "What next?" prompt any more.)
 Open Grave
 You're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of
 dirt.

 There's an old bone here.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 7 out of 100.)

 With great difficulty, you manage to climb out of the open grave.

 Spooky Copse

 Twilight Glen
 The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make
 out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the
 tombstones winds off to the east.

 There must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their
 umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.

 The gravedigger is locking the iron gate from the outside as you
 approach. "Keep out of the cemetery after Dark," he tells you with a
 sly wink.

 You can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.

 Taken.

 The tombstones block your path.

 Spooky Copse

 Whew! That cemetery sure is spooky.

 Outside Cottage
 You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the town librarian. The road
 turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post
 Office Hill.

 As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle
 you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street,
 yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth.

 You can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps.

 The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to
 gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 10 out of

 The poodle yaps a threat as you back away.

 Rotary South
 This is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south,
 towards Post Office Hill.

 The Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic
 artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner.

 Miss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you
 approach. "Just the person I was looking for!" she exclaims, smiling
 brightly.

 "I don't have time right now," she replies.

 Miss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her
 purse. "Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp,"
 she coos, holding the note out to you. "I'd be ever so much obliged."

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 13 out of

 Miss Voss hurries away down the street. "Thanks! Toody-loo!"

 Rotary West
 You're on the west side of the Festeron Rotary. A street branches west,
 towards the lake.

 The Police Station stands on a nearby corner. It's a modest little
 building with a sign over the open entrance.

 Lake Edge
 You're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the
 village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking
 south, you can see a closed iron gate leading into the Festeron
 Cemetery.

 Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the
 water.

 You can see a circular pile of leaves near the edge of the lake.
 Somebody has scrawled a message in the sand next to the pile of leaves.

 Misty Island has been shrouded in fog for as long as you can remember.
 Strange legends and mysterious rumors abound; but nobody you know has
 ever been there.

 You'd probably drown in the lake if you went that way.

 River Outlet
 This is where the lake empties into the Festeron River. A road leads
 south along the edge of the lake, and bends east to follow the river
 bank. A narrow trail leads upward to the top of Lookout Hill.

 You'd probably drown in the river if you went that way.

 Lookout Hill
 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you
 can see Festeron Village nestled among the trees. A narrow trail winds
 down the north side of the hill, towards the river.

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and
 majestic oak tree.

 A horseshoe is lying in the grass near the stump.

 Taken.

 The stump is huge, easily four feet across.

 You find nothing interesting.

 You can't see any branch here!

 (Presumably, you mean LOOK AT the direction, not LOOK INSIDE or LOOK ON
 or LOOK UNDER or LOOK BEHIND the direction.)
 You see nothing extraordinary about the direction.

 (Presumably, you mean LOOK AT the direction, not LOOK INSIDE or LOOK ON

 This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Festeron
 River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to
 the village.

 Bridge
 You're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs
 on an arch overhead.

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Festeron Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise
 abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of
 the river.

 (Sorry, but this story doesn't recognize the word "cliffs.")

 It's a sheer, featureless wall, a hundred feet high.

 The cliff is much too steep to climb.

 Cliff Bottom
 You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of
 the river. A steep trail winds upward.

 A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment.

 Crack! The dead branch snaps off the gnarled tree trunk and falls to
 the ground with a thud.

 Your load is too heavy.

 Your path is blocked by a cliff wall.

 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post
 Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of
 clouds.

 The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the
 distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments,
 checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.

 A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted
 shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale.
 A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick
 Shoppe."

 The Magick Shoppe door is closed.

 (You don't need to use the word "figure" to finish this story.)

 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward.

 The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.

 A voice cries, "Come in!"

 (It's 4:00 pm. Better hurry! The Magick Shoppe closes in less than an
 hour!)

 The Magick Shoppe door is closed.

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.

 Magick Shoppe
 You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.

 Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and
 mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene
 jokes and naughty birthday cards.

 In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented
 with a grinning crescent moon and other celestial symbols.

 The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of
 the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.

 A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed
 bell tinkles merrily.

 "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain.

 As you approach the curtained exit, the Magick Shoppe subtly rearranges
 itself until you find yourself facing the other way.

 The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.

 Time passes.

 The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.

 The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin,
 pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature
 in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever
 seen.

 You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice.
 "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late
 in the day."

 The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 19 out of
 100.)

 The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you.
 "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she
 murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again."

 She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and
 hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she
 pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer
 package.)

 Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.

 "Go ahead, dear. Don't be bashful. Read the letter to me, please. I'm
 waiting."

 (to the old woman)
 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 20 out of
 100.)

 The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of
 anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.

 "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly
 around the room, deep in thought.

 "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to
 herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to
 conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and
 family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice
 breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion."

 Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and
 crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard
 Wishbringer alone."

 "That's a long story," sighs the old woman wistfully.

 The old woman makes an effort to compose herself.

 "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a
 shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take
 this little trinket anyway."

 The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 23 out of
 100.)

 "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost
 hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town."

 The Magick Shoppe door is closed.

 The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A
 concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words
 slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as
 night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right
 HERE."

 The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The
 light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.

 Enter saved game to store: Okay, done.

 Magick Shoppe
 You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.

 Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and
 mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene
 jokes and naughty birthday cards.

 In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented
 with a smiling crescent moon and other celestial symbols.

 The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of
 the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.

 The old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.

 "The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the
 place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts
 and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely
 on legends to instruct you in its mysteries."

 As she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the
 Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.

 "Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.

 "Her name is Chaos."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.








 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward.

 The surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of
 evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely
 hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce
 the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...

 ... an island with a tower on it.

 There's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline
 is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare,
 the clearer and more frightening it becomes.

 The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.

 As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in...

 A sudden gust of wind dissolves the fog and clears your vision.

 Cliff Bottom
 You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of
 the river.

 A dead branch is lying on the ground.

 A gnarled tree trunk, stripped of all its branches, stands nearby. A
 vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.

 Your load is too heavy.

 Its steady gaze makes you uneasy.

 The vulture spreads its wings and soars away over your head.

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise
 abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of
 the river.

 A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the
 covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the
 closed gate.

 Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less
 original story would probably refer to it as a troll.

 The troll is staring back at you stupidly.

 Attacking the troll with an umbrella isn't likely to help matters.

 (This story can't understand the word "hello" when you use it that
 way.)

 "The sign says 'One Gold Coin,'" croaks the troll, palm outstretched.

 You're holding a metal can, a horseshoe, a violet note and an umbrella.

 It's a round metal can with a closed lid, illustrated with a
 tasty-looking assortment of mixed nuts.

 Spooky Copse

 (Maximum verbosity.)

 Spooky Copse
 A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really
 spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.

 There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected
 next to it.

 Twilight Glen
 The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make
 out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the
 tombstones winds off to the east.

 There must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their
 umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.

 The gravedigger is locking the iron gate from the outside as you
 approach. "Keep out of the cemetery after Dark," he tells you with a
 sly wink.

 You can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.

 Taken.

 Creepy Corner
 You're in a creepy corner of the Festeron Cemetery, surrounded by
 silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane
 wanders north.

 Whew! That cemetery sure is spooky.

 Outside Cemetery
 You're standing next to an open iron gate that leads west into the
 Festeron Cemetery. A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill.

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.

 To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick
 building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door is closed.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 Outside Cottage
 You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the town librarian. The road
 turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post
 Office Hill.

 As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle
 you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street,
 yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth.

 You can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps.

 The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to
 gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 10 out of

 The poodle yaps a threat as you back away.

 Rotary South
 This is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south,
 towards Post Office Hill.

 The Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic
 artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner.

 Miss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you
 approach. "Just the person I was looking for!" she exclaims, smiling
 brightly.

 She's holding a purse and an armful of books.

 Miss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her
 purse. "Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp,"
 she coos, holding the note out to you. "I'd be ever so much obliged."

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 13 out of

 Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain,
 filled with sparkling water.

 A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.

 You can see a gold coin and a goldfish in the fountain.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of

 Rotary North
 This is the northern side of the Festeron Rotary. A road leads north,
 towards the river.

 On the corner stands a quaint village church. Its little white steeple
 is straight out of a country postcard. The church door stands
 invitingly open.

 South of Bridge
 This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Festeron
 River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to
 the village.

 Bridge
 You're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs
 on an arch overhead.

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Festeron Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise
 abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of
 the river.

 Cliff Bottom
 You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of
 the river. A steep trail winds upward.

 A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment.

 Crack! The dead branch snaps off the gnarled tree trunk and falls to
 the ground with a thud.

 Your load is too heavy.

 (The trail you're climbing is narrow and twisty. It's a good idea to
 draw a map as you go up.)

 Steep Trail

 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post
 Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of
 clouds.

 The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the
 distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments,
 checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.

 A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted
 shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale.
 A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick
 Shoppe."

 The Magick Shoppe door is closed.

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.

 Magick Shoppe
 You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.

 Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and
 mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene
 jokes and naughty birthday cards.

 In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented
 with a frowning crescent moon and other celestial symbols.

 The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of
 the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.

 A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed
 bell tinkles merrily.

 "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain.

 The grinning grandfather clock says it's 3:45 pm.

 The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.

 Time passes.

 The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.

 The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin,
 pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature
 in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever
 seen.

 You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice.
 "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late
 in the day."

 The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of
 100.)

 The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you.
 "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she
 murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again."

 She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and
 hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she
 pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer
 package.)

 Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.

 "Go ahead, dear. Read the letter to me. I'm waiting."

 (to the old woman)
 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of
 100.)

 The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of
 anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.

 "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly
 around the room, deep in thought.

 "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to
 herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to
 conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and
 family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice
 breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion."

 Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and
 crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard
 Wishbringer alone."

 "Ahhh," sighs the old woman wistfully.

 The old woman makes an effort to compose herself.

 "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a
 shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take
 this little trinket anyway."

 The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of
 100.)

 "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost
 hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town."

 Strange. Despite your best efforts, the front door refuses to budge.

 "That door always sticks this time of year," notes the old woman drily.

 The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A
 concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words
 slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as
 night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right
 HERE."

 The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The
 light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.

 Your body seems unwilling to respond.

 The old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.

 "The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the
 place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts
 and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely
 on legends to instruct you in its mysteries."

 As she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the
 Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.

 "Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.

 "Her name is Chaos."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.








 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward.

 The surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of
 evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely
 hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce
 the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...

 ... an island with a tower on it.

 There's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline
 is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare,
 the clearer and more frightening it becomes.

 The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.

 As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in...

 Fog
 You're lost in a thick cloud of fog.

 Cliff Bottom
 You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of
 the river.

 A dead branch is lying on the ground.

 A gnarled tree trunk, stripped of all its branches, stands nearby. A
 vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.

 Your load is too heavy.

 The vulture spreads its wings and soars away over your head.

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise
 abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of
 the river.

 A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the
 covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the
 closed gate.

 Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less
 original story would probably refer to it as a troll.

 The childlike scrawl is hard to decipher. With a little imagination,
 you can make out the phrase "Toll Bridge, One Gold Coin."

 The vulture hovers in the sky high overhead.

 The can rattles in your hand.

 The troll snatches away your gold coin with a grunt and squints at it
 suspiciously. "Ugh!" he cries, holding it up to the moonlight. "This is
 a fake!" He points accusingly at the familiar profile of one of
 Festeron's founding fathers, throws your coin to the ground and pulls
 out another. "This is what an OFFICIAL gold coin looks like!"

 The troll proudly exhibits his coin. It shows the profile of an
 evil-looking old woman.

 The troll studies the umbrella closely to see if it resembles a gold
 coin, and pitches it to the ground when he decides that it doesn't.

 Your score is 24 points out of 100, in 59 moves.
 Are you sure you want to restart the story?









 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.

 To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick
 building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands
 invitingly open.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you.

 Okay, what do you want to do now?
 Post Office
 This is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with
 small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs
 along the entire length of the room.

 Your boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other
 people's postcards.

 Mr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. "Where have you been?"
 he barks angrily. "Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere
 for you!"

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 1 out of 100.)

 What next?

 An old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree.

 The gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach.

 What next?
 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

 What next?
 It's six feet deep and freshly dug. You can see an old bone inside.

 The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding. "That's
 a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says. "Let's
 have a look at it."

 What next?
 The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope. "Hmm,"
 he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried that old
 woman years ago."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 "Couldn't ask for a nicer day for diggin' graves."

 What next?
 You see nothing extraordinary about the old bone.

 "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you
 soon."

 The old man ambles away to the west.

 (You won't see the "What next?" prompt any more.)

 Rotary East
 You're on the eastern side of the Festeron Rotary. A street branches

 On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes
 and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance,
 and a marquee announces the current feature.

 Pleasure Wharf
 You're standing near the entrance to the Pleasure Wharf, the town's
 most popular tourist attraction. The Wharf extends eastward into
 Festeron Bay, and a tidal beach curves north along the shore.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 Video Arcade
 This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op
 video games. The machines are all deserted and quiet, except for one in
 the corner that emits a feeble "wokka-wokka" sound.

 A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token."

 The game machine is equipped with a video screen, a joystick, a big red
 button and a narrow slot for tokens. A lurid logo ("LEATHER GODDESSES
 OF PHOBOS!") is painted on the side.

 Are you sure you want to push the big red button?


 You don't know what this game machine might do! You don't really want
 to press that big red button, do you?


 (Okay, just testing you.)

 Nothing exciting happens.

 The slot is too narrow.

 The joystick can be moved north, south, east or west.

 You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.

 In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented
 with a staring crescent moon and other celestial symbols.

 The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of

 squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and
 slithers out of sight.

 It's a round metal can with an open lid, illustrated with a
 tasty-looking assortment of mixed nuts.

 The vulture spreads its wings and soars away over your head.

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise
 abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of
 the river.

 A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the
 covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the
 closed gate.

 Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less
 original story would probably refer to it as a troll.

 The troll snatches away your gold coin with a grunt and squints at it
 suspiciously. "Ugh!" he cries, holding it up to the moonlight. "This is
 a fake!" He points accusingly at the familiar profile of one of
 Festeron's founding fathers, throws your coin to the ground and pulls
 out another. "This is what an OFFICIAL gold coin looks like!"

 The troll proudly exhibits his coin. It shows the profile of an
 evil-looking old woman.

 "No time for questions," growls the idle troll.

 Taken.

 You're holding a gold coin, a metal can, a conch shell, a violet note
 and an umbrella.

 The troll studies the conch shell closely to see if it resembles a gold
 coin, and pitches it to the ground when he decides that it doesn't.

 The can rattles in your hand.

 It's already open.

 Pop! A small stone drops out of the squashed can and lands at your

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.

 To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick
 building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands
 invitingly open.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you.

 Okay, what do you want to do now?

 Cliff Bottom

 A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment.

 The steep trail seems to have disappeared with the fog.

 North of Bridge

 You're holding a small stone (providing light), a squashed can, a conch
 shell, a gold coin, a violet note and an umbrella.

 "Show me first a gold coin," croaks the troll, palm outstretched.

 Okay, the umbrella is now open.

 A searing bolt of lightning shatters the night! It strikes the glowing
 Stone of Dreams, and fractures the sky into a billion raindrops.

 Everything around you is soaked in a brief but savage downpour.

 It's obvious that the troll did not enjoy the sudden bath.

 The vulture eyes you suspiciously from high overhead.

 "The sign says 'One Gold Coin,'" croaks the troll, palm outstretched.

 The vulture can be seen circling high overhead.

 You can't see any coin here!

 Cliff Bottom

 A dead branch is lying on the ground.

 A gnarled tree trunk, stripped of all its branches, stands nearby.

 You can see a gold coin and a squashed can here.

 Park
 You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron Rotary.
 Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain,
 filled with sparkling water.

 A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of

 Rotary East
 You're on the eastern side of the Festeron Rotary. A street branches
 off to the east, towards the bay.

 On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes
 and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance,
 and a marquee announces the current feature.

 Pleasure Wharf
 You're standing near the entrance to the Pleasure Wharf, the town's
 most popular tourist attraction. The Wharf extends eastward into
 Festeron Bay, and a tidal beach curves north along the shore.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 Wharf's End
 The sea-worn planks of the Festeron Pleasure Wharf end abruptly a few
 feet to the east. You're surrounded by the blue, sparkling waters of
 Festeron Bay.

 Apparently a careless fisherman has just left the wharf, for lying on
 the planks is a little seahorse, its gills moving in and out with its
 dying gasps.

 The seahorse looks at you with moist, frightened eyes.

 Taken.

 The seahorse opens and closes its little mouth pathetically.

 Splash!

 The seahorse floats without moving for a few anxious moments. Then it
 springs suddenly to life, circling and splashing joyfully in the waves.
 Before it swims away it looks up at you with an unmistakable expression
 of gratitude.

 Tidal Pool
 You're on a damp stretch of sand that extends north towards Festeron
 Point, and south to the Pleasure Wharf.

 A large conch shell is lying in the sand at your feet.

 Lighthouse
 This is where the river empties into Festeron Bay. A beach follows the
 shore of the bay to the south, and a path leads west along the
 riverbank.

 A miniature lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands blinking on the
 shore nearby.

 Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through
 half-closed eyelids.

 Rocky Path
 You're on a rocky path that runs east and west along the banks of the
 Festeron River. A dense, impenetrable forest borders the south edge of
 the path.

 South of Bridge
 This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Festeron
 River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to
 the village.

 River Outlet
 This is where the lake empties into the Festeron River. A road leads
 south along the edge of the lake, and bends east to follow the river
 bank. A narrow trail leads upward to the top of Lookout Hill.

 Lookout Hill
 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you
 can see Festeron Village nestled among the trees. A narrow trail winds
 down the north side of the hill, towards the river.

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and
 majestic oak tree.

 A horseshoe is lying in the grass near the stump.

 Taken.

 You'd tumble down the hill if you went that way.

 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post
 Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of
 clouds.

 The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the
 distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments,
 checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.

 A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted
 shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale.
 A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick
 Shoppe."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.

 Magick Shoppe
 You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.

 Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and
 mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene
 jokes and naughty birthday cards.

 In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented
 with a grinning crescent moon and other celestial symbols.

 The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of
 the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.

 A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed
 bell tinkles merrily.

 "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain.

 The naughty glass case is closed and locked.

 The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.

 You can see nothing special inside the grandfather clock.

 The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.

 The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin,
 pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature
 in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever
 seen.

 You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice.
 "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late
 in the day."

 The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of
 100.)

 The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you.
 "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she
 murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again."

 She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and
 hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she
 pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer
 package.)

 Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.

 "Read the letter to me, please. I'm waiting."

 (to the old woman)
 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of
 100.)

 The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of
 anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.

 "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly
 around the room, deep in thought.

 "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to
 herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to
 conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and
 family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice
 breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion."

 Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and
 crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard
 Wishbringer alone."

 "Not now," sighs the old woman wistfully. "You're better off not
 knowing too much about it."

 The old woman makes an effort to compose herself.

 "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a
 shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take
 this little trinket anyway."

 The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of
 100.)

 "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost
 hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town."

 That's odd. Despite your best efforts, the front door refuses to budge.

 "That door always sticks this time of year," notes the old woman drily.

 The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A
 concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words
 slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as
 night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right
 HERE."

 The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The
 light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.

 Your body seems unwilling to respond.

 The old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.

 "The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the
 place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts
 and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely
 on legends to instruct you in its mysteries."

 As she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the
 Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.

 "Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.

 "Her name is Chaos."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.








 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward.

 The surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of
 evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely
 hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce
 the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...

 ... an island with a tower on it.

 There's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline
 is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare,
 the clearer and more frightening it becomes.

 The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.

 Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It
 squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and
 slithers out of sight.

 The false bottom is wedged tightly into the metal can. You might be
 able to loosen it by squeezing harder... harder!...

 Pop! A small stone drops out of the squashed can and lands at your
 feet.

 The fog in the valley is rising towards you!

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 29 out of

 Cliff Bottom
 You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of
 the river.

 A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. A
 vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.

 The vulture spreads its wings and soars away over your head.

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise
 abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of
 the river.

 A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the
 covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the
 closed gate.

 Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less
 original story would probably refer to it as a troll.

 Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It
 squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and
 slithers out of sight.

 The metal can clatters to the ground.

 A scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across
 the covered bridge.

 The metal can appears to have a false bottom. You could probably get it
 out by squeezing the can.

 The false bottom is wedged tightly into the metal can. You might be
 able to loosen it by squeezing harder... harder!...

 Pop! A small stone drops out of the squashed can and lands at your
 feet.

 The vulture appears high overhead.

 As your fingers close around the small stone it begins to glow with an
 eerie violet-white radiance.

 The toll gate is closed.

 The vulture hovers high overhead.

 Okay, the toll gate is now open.

 Bridge
 You're on a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. A sign
 hangs on an arch overhead.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east.

 Church
 You're standing inside an abandoned old church. The aisles are littered
 with debris and bits of colored glass; everything is coated with a
 thick layer of dust.

 A lighted candle is visible in a nook near the exit.

 A voice from above begins to proclaim something, but a burst of static
 drowns out the solemn words. Looking up, you notice a speaker in the

 As you look around the empty church a big brown rat scurries across the

 Park
 You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Witchville
 Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a neglected marble
 fountain, filled with greasy water.

 A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.

 The statue is a heroic commemoration of a very evil-looking old woman.

 You can see a brass token and a piranha inside the fountain.

 The piranha nips savagely at your fingertips.

 The Witchville Public Library, once famous for its museum of local

 Outside Cottage
 You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the former town librarian. The
 road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of
 Post Office Hill.

 As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the biggest hellhound

 roaring angrily and showing its sharp, bloody fangs.

 You can smell the hellhound's hot breath as it roars.

 The hellhound roars a threat as you back away.

 On the corner nearby stands a sleazy little movie theater. Showtimes

 Miss Voss, the former town librarian, is peering at you suspiciously.

 you a ticket.

 Theater Lobby
 You're standing in the lobby of the movie theater. A short corridor
 leads north into darkness. Sound effects and music can be heard
 drifting down the corridor.

 The gravedigger is standing near the corridor, a large cardboard carton
 at his feet.

 The open carton is marked, "Free 3D Movie Glasses Here!"

 You can't see any glasses here!

 The gravedigger doesn't respond. He seems to be a bit hard of hearing.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots outside.

 It's already open.

 You can see nothing unusual inside the carton.

 The gravedigger might not like it if you tried that!

 You're not holding the carton.

 The gravedigger blocks your path. "Can't get in without a ticket."

 The gravedigger takes the ticket, gestures absently to the empty carton

 You can see nothing extraordinary inside the carton.

 Inside Theater
 This is a movie theater unlike any you've ever seen! The seats are
 wide, deep and comfortable. The aisles are spotless. The air is clear
 of smoke, and the screen is dramatically large. A chill goes up your
 spine as you realize how alien your universe has become.

 There's a noisy movie playing on the screen. A dark corridor leads out
 to the lobby.

 All you can see on the screen is a confusing double-image.

 A tiny voice in the conch shell says, "Release a prisoner, and be

 The buzzing sound in the conch shell stops.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east. It sounds as if
 they're coming this way!

 Police Station
 You're in the front office of the Witchville Police Station. The room
 is lined with dimly-lit jail cells. Occasional wails of anguish suggest
 that many of the cells are occupied.

 Sgt. MacGuffin, Witchville's finest, is glaring down at you from behind
 an intimidatingly high desk. You can see a wanted poster taped to the
 wall.

 "It's past curfew," Sgt. MacGuffin growls as you enter. "I hope you've
 got a very good reason for coming in here at this hour."

 (Sorry, but the word "mcguffin" is not in the vocabulary that you can
 use.)

 "I'll do the talking around here!" snaps Sgt. MacGuffin.

 "You've got exactly one second to tell me why I shouldn't throw you in
 jail," notes Sgt. MacGuffin through clenched teeth.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots outside.

 The Stone of Dreams brightens as you speak the Wish, and the edges of
 the horseshoe begin to twinkle with Luck.

 "Your second's up."

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel
 door and stone walls offer little hope for escape.

 The only furnishing is a hard bunk against the wall with a thick
 blanket on it.

 You can see an umbrella, a violet note, a gold coin, a conch shell, a
 horseshoe (providing light), a squashed can, a small stone (providing

 Lake Edge
 You're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the
 village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking
 south, you can see a closed iron gate leading into the Witchville
 Cemetery.

 Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the
 water.

 You can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake. Animal tracks are
 visible in the sand next to the pit.

 The animal tracks emerge from the lake and lead to the edge of the pit,
 where they disappear abruptly.

 A rusty "click!" draws your eyes to the iron gate. You watch as it
 slowly creaks open, all by itself!

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east.

 The pit is more than five feet deep. You can see a platypus in it.

 You can't fit into the pit. It's too narrow.

 River Outlet
 This is where the lake empties into the Witchville River. A road leads
 south along the edge of the lake, and bends east to follow the river
 bank. A narrow trail leads upward to the top of Lookout Hill.

 South of Bridge

 The vulture eyes you suspiciously from high overhead.

 The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic
 leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol!

 You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an
 especially tall Boot. "What have we here?" he hisses. "Out after
 curfew? Tsk, tsk, tsk. I wonder what Sgt. MacGuffin will say about
 this."

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor.
 "What's this?" he demands impatiently.

 "A nightcrawler," hisses the Tall Boot, giving you a vicious little
 kick. "Outside after curfew. Shall I feed it to the sharks?"

 Sgt. MacGuffin shakes his head. "Later. The Tower wants all prisoners

 Twilight Glen
 The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make

 tombstones winds off to the east.

 As you glance around you notice luminous ribbons of mist darting among
 the tombstones. The air is filled with sinister voices.

 At the moment, you hear nothing interesting.

 The luminous mists suddenly condense into a cloud of eldritch vapors!
 Circling like sharks, they stroke your face with ghostly fingers and
 whisper dreadful secrets into your ears.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the north.

 Spooky Copse
 A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really
 spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.

 There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected
 next to it.

 Giggling with mischievous Glee, the eldritch vapors clutch your legs
 and cover your eyes with their luminous hands. The ground falls away
 beneath your feet as the foggy fiends lift you high above the treetops,
 scatter your possessions and carry you screaming into the night.








 You come to your senses empty-handed and aching all over.

 Lighthouse
 This is where the river empties into Witchville Bay. A path leads west

 half-closed eyelids.

 It seems to be a junk-mail ad for a primitive computer game. The

 With a gentle pop, the little mailbox pulls itself out of the ground
 and cavorts about the grass like a happy rabbit!

 The front door is securely closed.

 The little mailbox notices you and snaps its tiny lid with joy. It
 makes a silly "clump-clump, clump-clump" sound as it hops to your side

 hideous, plaintive wail that reminds you of a subway screeching to a
 halt.

 A very large creature, equipped with slavering fangs and wearing a
 calico apron, lurks into the nest. Its mother-instinct overcomes its
 overwhelming fear of light long enough to devour you.

 Underground
 You're in a dark underground chamber. Cold, dirty tunnels wander away
 to the south and east.

 The surrounding walls are almost obscured by the roots of a mighty
 tree. Overhead you can see the underside of a large stump. It appears
 to be hinged.

 Lifting the hinged top of the stump reveals a round hole leading upward
 into moonlight.

 Lookout Hill
 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you
 can see Witchville Village nestled among the trees. A narrow trail
 winds down the north side of the hill, towards the river.

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and
 majestic oak tree. An opening in the stump leads down into darkness.

 (Do you want to go down the north side of the hill, or down into the
 open stump? Please type NORTH or IN.)

 River Outlet
 This is where the lake empties into the Witchville River. A road leads
 south along the edge of the lake, and bends east to follow the river
 bank. A narrow trail leads upward to the top of Lookout Hill.

 This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville
 River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to
 the village.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the south. It sounds as if

 Rotary North
 This is the northern side of the Witchville Rotary. A road leads north,
 towards the river.

 On the corner stands a broken-down old church that looks as if it
 hasn't been used for years.

 The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic
 leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol again!

 You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an
 especially tall Boot. "What!" he cries. "I thought you were locked up
 with Sgt. MacGuffin. Tsk, tsk."

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor. His
 eyes narrow when he sees you. "Well, well. If it isn't the disappearing
 mail clerk." You open your mouth to reply, but a vicious little kick
 changes your mind. "The Tower wants a chat with this troublemaker."

 "The sharks are getting restless," remarks the Tall Boot hopefully.

 Sgt. MacGuffin smirks. "So is the Evil One."

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel
 door and stone walls offer little hope for escape.

 The only furnishing is a hard bunk against the wall.

 You can see a thick blanket, a candle (providing light), a violet note,
 a gold coin and a small stone (providing light) here.

 The small stone stops glowing.

 The bunk: Don't be silly.
 The thick blanket: Taken.
 The candle: Taken.
 The violet note: Taken.
 The gold coin: Taken.
 The small stone: Taken.

 The small stone begins to glow again.

 Okay, you moved the bunk away from the wall. There's a patch of new
 concrete on the floor.

 The hole is sealed with cement.

 You can hear somebody howling with pain from an adjacent cell.

 Grue's Nest
 You have stumbled into the nesting place of a family of grues.
 Congratulations. Few indeed are the adventurers who have entered a

 Everything is littered with rusty swords of elvish workmanship, piles
 of bones and other debris. A closed refrigerator stands in one corner
 of the nest, and something... a small, dangerous-looking little
 beast... is curled up in the other corner.

 The only exit is to the west. Hope you survive long enough to use it.

 Snoring fitfully, the little beast turns away from the light of the
 candle and faces the wall.

 A label on the refrigerator reads, "Frobozz Magic Grue Refrigerator

 The little beast is stirring restlessly. It looks as if it's about to
 wake up!

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 A voice behind you growls, "Hungry!" You turn to face the sound, but
 there's nobody here except you.

 The big mailbox seems ordinary enough. Or does it?

 You watch with astonishment as the lid of the big mailbox slowly opens
 by itself, then snaps shut with a clang.

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Inside Theater
 This is a movie theater unlike any you've ever seen! The seats are
 wide, deep and comfortable. The aisles are spotless. The air is clear
 of smoke, and the screen is dramatically large. A chill goes up your
 spine as you realize how alien your universe has become.

 There's a noisy movie playing on the screen. A dark corridor leads out
 to the lobby.

 The picture on the screen is fuzzy and hard to watch.

 Hmm. This place isn't completely spotless. You just discovered a used
 pair of 3D glasses under a seat.

 All you can see on the screen is a confusing double-image.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 55 out of
 100.)

 The screen image is a meaningless blur of colored light.

 Wow! As you put on the glasses the picture on the screen fuses into a
 solid, 3-dimensional image.

 The movie screen shows an evil woman squinting through an antique
 telescope. A laboratory full of bubbling 3D chemicals is visible in the
 background.

 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

 A 3D vulture lands on the woman's shoulder and croaks a secret into her
 ear. An evil eyebrow rises slowly as she listens.

 Time passes.

 The old woman swings the 3D antique telescope around (narrowly missing
 your nose) and peers into it again. A point-of-view shot reveals what
 the 'scope is focused on: a small movie theater, remarkably similar to
 the one you're in right now.

 The soundtrack is an artless mix of Witchville slogans and John Philip
 Sousa marches, played at earsplitting volume.

 The antique telescope zooms in on the entrance to the movie theater. A
 dead ringer for Miss Voss looks up and waves timidly at the camera.

 Fuzziness
 Everything around you appears blurry and fuzzy.

 Okay, you're no longer wearing the pair of 3D glasses.

 Theater Lobby
 You're standing in the lobby of the movie theater. A short corridor
 leads north into darkness. Sound effects and music can be heard
 drifting down the corridor.

 The gravedigger is standing near the corridor, a large cardboard carton
 at his feet.

 There's no exit that way.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots outside.

 Time passes.

 Are you sure you want to leave the movie theater? The gravedigger might
 not let you in again without another ticket!

 "Come again!" sneers the gravedigger as you leave.

 Rotary East
 You're on the eastern side of the Witchville Rotary. A street branches
 off to the east, towards the bay.

 On the corner nearby stands a sleazy little movie theater. Showtimes
 and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the open entrance,
 and a marquee announces the current feature.

 Miss Voss, the former town librarian, is peering at you suspiciously.

 Miss Voss is talking urgently with someone on the phone. She doesn't
 take her eyes off you for a moment.

 The vulture is circling high overhead.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east.

 Park
 You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Witchville
 Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a neglected marble
 fountain, filled with greasy water.

 A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.

 It lands in the fountain with a splash.

 The piranha snatches away the worm and swims to the far side of the
 fountain to devour it.

 Pleasure Wharf
 You're standing near the remains of the Pleasure Wharf. The Wharf
 extends eastward into Witchville Bay.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 A voice behind you growls, "I'm hungry!" You turn to face the sound,
 but there's nobody here except you.

 This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op

 (Hope you saved your story position.)

 A sudden power drain makes all the other games in the arcade go dim.
 Blue sheets of energy leap from the game machine, surrounding you in an
 incandescent aura. You can feel your molecules being taken apart one at
 a time, analyzed, modulated and broadcast through space. It is not a
 pleasant sensation.

 disorientation, then a shock of recognition...








 West of House
 You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded
 front door.

 There's a little mailbox here.

 The little mailbox is closed.

 Opening the little mailbox reveals a leaflet.

 The edges of the little mailbox are beginning to twinkle.

 You're holding too many things already!

 The little mailbox is engulfed in a sparkling aurora! Tremors of
 anticipation run up and down its length, and the air sings with Magick.

 (You don't seem to be holding that!)

 Dropped.

 With a gentle pop, the little mailbox pulls itself out of the ground
 and cavorts about the grass like a happy rabbit!

 Taken.

 The little mailbox notices you and snaps its tiny lid with joy. It
 makes a silly "clump-clump, clump-clump" sound as it hops to your side
 and rubs lovingly against your sleeve.

 (What do you want to pet?)

 The little mailbox coos with pleasure at your touch.

 The little mailbox hops around with excitement.

 It seems to be a junk-mail ad for a primitive computer game. The
 cancelled stamp on the leaflet is too faded to read clearly.

 The little mailbox snaps playfully at your heels.

 Dropped.

 Taken.

 As the house disappears into the distance, you get the distinct feeling
 that, someday, you will pass this way again.








 Rocky Path
 You're on a rocky path that runs east and west along the banks of the
 Witchville River. A dense, impenetrable forest borders the south edge
 of the path.

 Lighthouse
 This is where the river empties into Witchville Bay. A path leads west
 along the riverbank.

 A broken-down old lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands on the shore
 nearby.

 Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through
 half-closed eyelids.

 You can't go that way now. The tide is in.

 The little mailbox "clump-clumps" happily into view.

 Lake Edge
 You're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the
 village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking
 south, you can see an open iron gate leading into the Witchville
 Cemetery.

 Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the
 water.

 You can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake.

 There's a squashed can here.

 The vulture eyes you suspiciously from high overhead.

 Misty Island has been shrouded in fog for as long as you can remember.
 Strange legends and mysterious rumors abound; but nobody you know has
 ever been there.

 The little mailbox "clump-clumps" into view and snaps a greeting.

 The cemetery is a fearful place, especially at night. Are you sure you
 want to go in there?


 You have been warned.

 Twilight Glen
 The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make
 out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the
 tombstones winds off to the east.

 As you glance around you notice luminous ribbons of mist darting among
 the tombstones. The air is filled with sinister voices.

 Spooky Copse
 A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really
 spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.

 There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected
 next to it.

 The luminous mists suddenly condense into a cloud of eldritch vapors!
 Circling like sharks, they stroke your face with ghostly fingers and
 whisper dreadful secrets into your ears.

 Creepy Corner
 You're in a creepy corner of the Witchville Cemetery, surrounded by
 silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane
 wanders north.

 Giggling with mischievous Glee, the eldritch vapors clutch your legs
 and cover your eyes with their luminous hands. The ground falls away
 beneath your feet as the foggy fiends lift you high above the treetops,
 scatter your possessions and carry you screaming into the night.








 You come to your senses empty-handed and aching all over.

 South of Bridge
 This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville

 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you

 majestic oak tree. An opening in the stump leads down into darkness.

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn

 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Rotary East

 You watch with astonishment as the lid of the big mailbox slowly opens

 The little mailbox "clump-clumps" to your side with a joyful snap.

 You're holding too many things already!

 The lid of the big mailbox opens again. "Feed me!"

 The two mailboxes freeze at the sight of one another.

 The little mailbox snarls and stands protectively by your side. The big
 mailbox emits a frightful growl and throws its lid wide open,
 displaying rows of sharp little teeth. A crowd of postal meters and
 stamp dispensers gathers as the metal warriors circle each other with
 tense, snapping lids.

 With a sudden rush, the little mailbox throws itself at the big mailbox
 and clamps onto its forefoot. The big mailbox roars with anger, bites
 the little mailbox viciously and tries in vain to shake it off. You
 stare in wonder as the fighting boxes swell to twice their normal size,
 then four times larger, eight times!

 The big mailbox frees itself with a savage twist and bends to finish
 its foe. The little mailbox dodges, grips the descending lid and holds
 on for dear life. Locked in mortal combat, the giant boxes roll over
 and over, shaking the earth with the thunder of battle.

 The scene disappears under a cloud of dust. You hear a terrible scream
 of agony, then an even more terrible silence. When the air clears, the
 boxes and spectators are gone.

 A sudden power drain makes all the other games in the arcade go dim.
 Blue sheets of energy leap from the game machine, surrounding you in an
 incandescent aura. You can feel your molecules being taken apart one at
 a time, analyzed, modulated and broadcast through space. It is not a
 pleasant sensation.








 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Witchville.

 A tower stands in bleak silhouette against the moonlit sky. It rises a
 hundred feet above a barren plateau, and is encircled by a deep moat.
 The only entrances are a closed drawbridge and a dark window near the
 top.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 A synthetic voice says, "Game Over. Insert Token To Play Again."

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 58 out of
 100.)

 You're holding a horseshoe, a conch shell, an umbrella, a gold coin, a
 violet note, a silver whistle, a bottle and a small stone (providing
 light).

 It's wide open, and located a hundred feet above the moat.

 The drawbridge is closed against the wall of the tower.

 (That sentence didn't make sense. Please reword it or try something
 else.)

 There are two arrows on the signpost. The arrow pointing west says "To
 Cemetery." The east arrow is marked "To Witchville."

 Unfortunately, the drawbridge is too far away for you to do that.

 The drawbridge is closed.

 Unfortunately, the drawbridge is too far away for you to do that.

 Outside Cottage
 You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the former town librarian. The
 road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of
 Post Office Hill.

 As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the biggest hellhound
 you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street,
 roaring angrily and showing its sharp, bloody fangs.

 You can smell the hellhound's hot breath as it roars.

 The hellhound won't let you near the cottage.

 The hellhound glares at you through eyes red with hatred.

 You can't go that way.

 You can hear the hellhound's sharp, bloody fangs snapping as it nips
 your heels.

 The hellhound roars a threat as you back away.

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Witchville.

 A tower stands in bleak silhouette against the moonlit sky. It rises a
 hundred feet above a barren plateau, and is encircled by a deep moat.
 The only entrances are a closed drawbridge and a dark window near the
 top.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 The moat is 20 feet wide and filled with black, oily water.

 But the violet note isn't addressed to you!

 The name "Corky" is beautifully handwritten on the outside.

 (Mr. Crisp hates it when you use that name!)

 You'd probably drown in the moat if you went that way.

 Outside Cemetery
 You're standing next to an open iron gate that leads west into the
 Witchville Cemetery. A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill.

 The horseshoe: Dropped.
 The conch shell: Dropped.
 The umbrella: Dropped.
 The gold coin: Dropped.
 The violet note: Dropped.
 The silver whistle: Dropped.
 The bottle: Dropped.
 The small stone: Dropped.

 The small stone stops glowing.

 The cemetery is a fearful place, especially at night. Are you sure you
 want to go in there?


 You have been warned.

 Clang! A sudden gust of wind blows the iron gate shut in your face.

 You can hear misty voices giggling on the other side, and a loud
 "click" as the gate locks.

 The small stone: Taken.
 The bottle: Taken.
 The silver whistle: Taken.
 The violet note: Taken.
 The gold coin: Taken.
 The umbrella: Taken.
 The conch shell: Taken.
 The horseshoe: Taken.

 The small stone begins to glow again.

 Video Arcade
 This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op
 video games. The machines are crowded with half-crazed, stunted
 humanoids, who pay no attention to you as they satisfy their thirst for
 electric violence.

 One machine in the corner appears to be deserted.

 A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token."

 Pleasure Wharf
 You're standing near the remains of the Pleasure Wharf. The Wharf
 extends eastward into Witchville Bay.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the west. It sounds as if
 they're coming this way!

 Wharf's End
 The sea-worn planks of the Witchville Pleasure Wharf end abruptly a few
 feet to the east. You're surrounded by the dark, shark-infested waters
 of Witchville Bay.

 South of Bridge
 This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville

 the village.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east.

 Rocky Path
 You're on a rocky path that runs east and west along the banks of the
 Witchville River. A shimmering trail leads south into a dense forest.

 The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic
 leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol!

 You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an
 especially tall Boot. "What have we here?" he hisses. "Out after
 curfew? Tsk, tsk, tsk. I wonder what Sgt. MacGuffin will say about
 this."

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor.
 "What's this?" he demands impatiently.

 "A nightcrawler," hisses the Tall Boot, giving you a vicious little
 kick. "Outside after curfew. Shall I feed it to the sharks?"

 Sgt. MacGuffin shakes his head. "Later. The Tower wants all prisoners
 held for questioning." He turns back to his work. "Cell Three."

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel
 door and stone walls offer little hope for escape.

 The only furnishing is a hard bunk in the middle of the floor.

 There's a dark, narrow hole in the floor.

 You can see a small stone (providing light), an earthworm, a bottle, a
 silver whistle, a violet note, a gold coin, an umbrella, a conch shell
 and a horseshoe here.

 The small stone stops glowing.

 There's no exit that way.

 On the corner nearby stands a sleazy little movie theater. Showtimes
 and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the open entrance,
 and a marquee announces the current feature.

 Miss Voss, the former town librarian, is peering at you suspiciously.

 Park
 You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Witchville
 Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a neglected marble
 fountain, filled with greasy water.

 A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.

 It lands in the fountain with a splash.

 The piranha snatches away the worm and swims to the far side of the
 fountain to devour it.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 52 out of

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Rotary West
 You're on the west side of the Witchville Rotary. A street branches
 west, towards the lake.

 The Police Station stands on a nearby corner. It's a grim little
 building with a sign over the open entrance.

 Lake Edge
 You're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the
 village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking
 south, you can see an open iron gate leading into the Witchville
 Cemetery.

 Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the
 water.

 You can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake.

 There's a squashed can here.

 A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 The silver whistle's music echoes over the lake, rippling the water
 with gentle Magick. A sudden gust of wind blows through your hair. You
 can see the soft outline of Misty Island drawing closer as you streak
 across the waves...








 Misty Island
 You're standing on a fog-shrouded beach. Sheer cliff walls rise to the
 north and south, and the dark waters of the lake stretch eastward.

 To the west stands a magnificent castle, its parapets rising high into
 the mist. Golden light streams invitingly through the open entrance.
 You can hear friendly voices and music inside.

 Throne Room
 You're standing in a long, high-ceilinged chamber. Hundreds of
 platypuses are milling about with teacups in their paws, their faces
 illuminated by a roaring fireplace.

 At the far end of the chamber stands a mighty throne. It's occupied by
 a snow-white platypus with a gold crown on its head and a jeweled
 scepter in its paw. On the floor near the throne is another crowned
 platypus... the same one you rescued from the pit.

 The crowd falls silent as you enter.

 "Welcome, brave Adventurer," says the white platypus, rising from its
 throne to greet you. "I am Anatinus, King of Misty Island. My court
 thanks you most humbly for rescuing the life of my daughter, Princess
 Tasmania. Great would our sorrow have been if not for your cunning."

 The crowd applauds politely, and Princess Tasmania blushes.

 You can see nothing unusual about it.

 "My messengers have told me of your quest," continues King Anatinus.
 "Allow me to repay your kindness with words of advice."

 The old platypus motions you to his side. "The Tower of the Evil One is
 formidable," he begins in a low, serious voice. "You will never get
 inside unaided. Legends speak of a Magick Word that can open the gates
 of the Tower. But what Word it is, none can say."

 The king reaches beneath his throne and takes out a small wizard's hat.
 "Take this," he says, holding it out to you.

 You're holding too many things already!

 "I offer you this Hat," says King Anatinus, holding it out to you.

 But the wizard's hat is much too small!

 "This Hat is for you. Take it," says King Anatinus, holding it out to
 you.

 Dropped.

 "Take this Hat," says King Anatinus, holding it out to you.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 50 out of
 100.)

 "Take it to the sea," King Anatinus whispers as you turn the hat in
 your hands. "There you will find a creature learned in the lore of
 Magick. Heed him well! In his wisdom lies your only hope."

 The wizard's hat is decorated with foil stars and cheap glitter.

 A fanfare of trumpets breaks the silence, and the crowd falls to its
 knees.

 The silver whistle magically reappears in your hand.

 "Good luck to you, brave Adventurer!" cries King Anatinus, bowing
 deeply. "Now blow into the silver whistle one more time, and deliver us
 from the horror of the Evil One."

 The platypuses look at you expectantly.

 A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 A sudden gust of wind rises out of nowhere, and Misty Island falls away
 beneath your feet. You feel the silver whistle slip from your hand as
 you streak across the lake...

 A broken-down old lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands on the shore

 Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through
 half-closed eyelids.

 The pelican sniffs the wizard's hat suspiciously. Its eyes open wide
 with interest, and the wizard's hat quickly finds a place on the
 pelican's head. Then the old bird gives you a sly, knowledgeable wink.

 All at once the lighthouse blazes to life! Its shining beacon whirls
 like a gyroscope, and a pencil-thin beam of light pierces the sky and
 traces a word on a passing cloud: FRATTO.

 The pelican spreads its wings and soars away over the bay. As the beam
 of the lighthouse fades, a voice in your head whispers, "Good luck,

 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.

 To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick
 building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands
 invitingly open.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you.

 Okay, what do you want to do now?
 Post Office
 This is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with
 small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs
 along the entire length of the room.

 Your boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other
 people's postcards.

 Mr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. "Where have you been?"
 he barks angrily. "Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere
 for you!"

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 1 out of 100.)

 What next?
 The little mailboxes are closed and locked.

 Mr. Crisp reaches under the service counter and pulls out a mysterious
 envelope. "We just got this Special Delivery," he snarls, tossing it
 onto the service counter. "I want you to drop it off right away. That
 means NOW!"

 What next?
 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 6 out of
 100.)

 Mr. Crisp drums his fingers on the service counter impatiently.
 "Deliver that envelope! The Magick Shoppe closes at five o'clock!"

 What next?
 As you leave the Post Office, somebody slams and locks the door behind
 you.

 Hilltop

 What next?
 Outside Cemetery
 You're standing next to an open iron gate that leads west into the
 Festeron Cemetery. A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill.

 What next?
 The cemetery is a fearful place. Are you sure you want to go in there?


 You have been warned.

 Creepy Corner
 You're in a creepy corner of the Festeron Cemetery, surrounded by
 silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane
 wanders north.

 What next?
 Spooky Copse
 A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really
 spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.

 There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected
 next to it.

 An old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree.

 The gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach.

 What next?
 He's the town gravedigger, a village fixture since before you were
 born.

 The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding. "That's
 a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says. "Let's
 have a look at it."

 What next?
 The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope. "Hmm,"
 he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried that old
 woman years ago."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 "Couldn't ask for a nicer day for diggin' graves."

 What next?
 It's six feet deep and freshly dug. You can see an old bone inside.

 "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you
 soon."

 The old man ambles away to the west.

 (You won't see the "What next?" prompt any more.)
 Open Grave
 You're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of
 dirt.

 There's an old bone here.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 7 out of 100.)

 With great difficulty, you manage to climb out of the open grave.

 Spooky Copse

 Twilight Glen
 The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make
 out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the
 tombstones winds off to the east.

 There must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their
 umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.

 The gravedigger is locking the iron gate from the outside as you
 approach. "Keep out of the cemetery after Dark," he tells you with a
 sly wink.

 You can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.

 Taken.

 Spooky Copse

 Creepy Corner

 Whew! That cemetery sure is spooky.

 Outside Cemetery

 Hilltop

 Outside Cottage
 You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the town librarian. The road
 turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post
 Office Hill.

 As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle
 you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street,
 yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth.

 You can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps.

 The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to
 gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 10 out of
 100.)

 The poodle yaps a threat as you back away.

 Rotary South
 This is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south,
 towards Post Office Hill.

 The Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic
 artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner.

 Miss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you
 approach. "Just the person I was looking for!" she exclaims, smiling
 brightly.

 She's holding a purse and an armful of books.

 Miss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her
 purse. "Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp,"
 she coos, holding the note out to you. "I'd be ever so much obliged."

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 13 out of
 100.)

 Miss Voss hurries away down the street. "Thanks! Toody-loo!"

 Park
 You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron Rotary.
 Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain,
 filled with sparkling water.

 A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of

 Rotary North
 This is the northern side of the Festeron Rotary. A road leads north,
 towards the river.

 On the corner stands a quaint village church. Its little white steeple
 is straight out of a country postcard. The church door stands
 invitingly open.

 South of Bridge
 This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Festeron
 River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to
 the village.

 Rocky Path
 You're on a rocky path that runs east and west along the banks of the
 Festeron River. A dense, impenetrable forest borders the south edge of
 the path.

 Lighthouse
 This is where the river empties into Festeron Bay. A beach follows the
 shore of the bay to the south, and a path leads west along the
 riverbank.

 A miniature lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands blinking on the
 shore nearby.

 Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through
 half-closed eyelids.

 Tidal Pool
 You're on a damp stretch of sand that extends north towards Festeron
 Point, and south to the Pleasure Wharf.

 A large conch shell is lying in the sand at your feet.

 Taken.

 Pleasure Wharf
 You're standing near the entrance to the Pleasure Wharf, the town's
 most popular tourist attraction. The Wharf extends eastward into
 Festeron Bay, and a tidal beach curves north along the shore.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 Wharf's End
 The sea-worn planks of the Festeron Pleasure Wharf end abruptly a few
 feet to the east. You're surrounded by the blue, sparkling waters of
 Festeron Bay.

 Apparently a careless fisherman has just left the wharf, for lying on
 the planks is a little seahorse, its gills moving in and out with its
 dying gasps.

 The seahorse looks at you with moist, frightened eyes.

 Taken.

 The seahorse opens and closes its little mouth pathetically.

 Splash!

 The seahorse floats without moving for a few anxious moments. Then it
 springs suddenly to life, circling and splashing joyfully in the waves.
 Before it swims away it looks up at you with an unmistakable expression
 of gratitude.

 Pleasure Wharf

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 Rotary East
 You're on the eastern side of the Festeron Rotary. A street branches
 off to the east, towards the bay.

 On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes
 and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance,
 and a marquee announces the current feature.

 Bridge
 You're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Festeron Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise
 abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of
 the river.

 Cliff Bottom
 You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of
 the river. A steep trail winds upward.

 A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment.

 (The trail you're climbing is narrow and twisty. It's a good idea to
 draw a map as you go up.)

 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post
 Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of
 clouds.

 The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the
 distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments,
 checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.

 A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted
 shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale.
 A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick
 Shoppe."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.

 Magick Shoppe
 You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.

 Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and
 mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene
 jokes and naughty birthday cards.

 In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented
 with a sneering crescent moon and other celestial symbols.

 The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of
 the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.

 A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed
 bell tinkles merrily.

 "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain.

 The smiling grandfather clock says it's 3:52 pm.

 The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.

 You can see nothing interesting inside the grandfather clock.

 The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.

 The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin,
 pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature
 in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever
 seen.

 You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice.
 "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late
 in the day."

 The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of
 100.)

 The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you.
 "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she
 murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again."

 She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and
 hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she
 pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess."

 (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)

 (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer
 package.)

 Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.

 "Don't be bashful. Read the letter to me, please."

 (to the old woman)
 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of
 100.)

 The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of
 anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.

 "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly
 around the room, deep in thought.

 "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to
 herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to
 conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and
 family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice
 breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion."

 Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and
 crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard
 Wishbringer alone."

 Strange. Despite your best efforts, the front door refuses to budge.

 "That door always sticks this time of year," notes the old woman drily.

 The old woman makes an effort to compose herself.

 "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a
 shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take
 this little trinket anyway."

 The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of
 100.)

 "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost
 hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town."

 The Magick Shoppe door is closed.

 The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A
 concealed bell tinkles merrily.

 "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words
 slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as
 night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right
 HERE."

 The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The
 light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.

 Your body seems unwilling to respond.

 The old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.

 "The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the
 place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts
 and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely
 on legends to instruct you in its mysteries."

 As she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the
 Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.

 "Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.

 "Her name is Chaos."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.








 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward.

 The surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of
 evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely
 hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce
 the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...

 ... an island with a tower on it.

 There's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline
 is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare,
 the clearer and more frightening it becomes.

 The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.

 As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in...

 Fog
 You're lost in a thick cloud of fog.

 A sudden gust of wind dissolves the fog and clears your vision.

 Cliff Bottom
 You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of
 the river.

 A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. A
 vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.

 The vulture spreads its wings and soars away over your head.

 North of Bridge
 This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise
 abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of
 the river.

 A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the
 covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the
 closed gate.

 Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less
 original story would probably refer to it as a troll.

 Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It
 squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and
 slithers out of sight.

 The metal can clatters to the ground.

 A scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across
 the covered bridge.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 27 out of

 Taken.

 Okay, the toll gate is now open.

 You're on a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. A sign

 You can see an umbrella, a violet note, a gold coin, a conch shell and

 The metal can appears to have a false bottom. You could probably get it
 out by squeezing the can.

 The false bottom is wedged tightly into the metal can. You might be
 able to loosen it by squeezing harder... harder!...

 Pop! A small stone drops out of the squashed can and lands at your
 feet.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 32 out of
 100.)

 As your fingers close around the small stone it begins to glow with an
 eerie violet-white radiance.

 The vulture is circling high overhead.

 River Outlet
 This is where the lake empties into the Witchville River. A road leads
 south along the edge of the lake, and bends east to follow the river
 bank. A narrow trail leads upward to the top of Lookout Hill.

 Lake Edge
 You're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the
 village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking
 south, you can see a closed iron gate leading into the Witchville
 Cemetery.

 Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the
 water.

 You can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake. Animal tracks are
 visible in the sand next to the pit.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east.

 The iron gate is closed.

 A rusty "click!" draws your eyes to the iron gate. You watch as it
 slowly creaks open, all by itself!

 Lake Edge

 Okay, the dead branch is now standing up inside the pit.

 The platypus grabs onto the bottom of the dead branch with its
 forepaws.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 37 out of
 100.)

 The platypus hangs on to the dead branch as you pull it out of the pit.
 It lets go when the branch clears the edge and waddles joyfully around
 on the sand.

 The little creature draws an "X" in the sand with its tail. Then it
 gives you an oddly dignified nod of thanks, waddles to the edge of the
 lake and disappears into the dark water.

 You can see an "X" drawn in the sand.

 You discovered a silver whistle in the sand under the "X"!

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 40 out of
 100.)

 A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 The silver whistle's music echoes over the lake, rippling the water
 with gentle Magick. A sudden gust of wind blows through your hair. You
 can see the soft outline of Misty Island drawing closer as you streak
 across the waves...








 Misty Island
 You're standing on a fog-shrouded beach. Sheer cliff walls rise to the
 north and south, and the dark waters of the lake stretch eastward.

 To the west stands a magnificent castle, its parapets rising high into
 the mist. Golden light streams invitingly through the open entrance.
 You can hear friendly voices and music inside.

 Throne Room
 You're standing in a long, high-ceilinged chamber. Hundreds of
 platypuses are milling about with teacups in their paws, their faces
 illuminated by a roaring fireplace.

 At the far end of the chamber stands a mighty throne. It's occupied by
 a snow-white platypus with a gold crown on its head and a jeweled
 scepter in its paw. On the floor near the throne is another crowned
 platypus... the same one you rescued from the pit.

 The crowd falls silent as you enter.

 "Welcome, brave Adventurer," says the white platypus, rising from its
 throne to greet you. "I am Anatinus, King of Misty Island. My court
 thanks you most humbly for rescuing the life of my daughter, Princess
 Tasmania. Great would our sorrow have been if not for your cunning."

 The crowd applauds politely, and Princess Tasmania blushes.

 (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!)

 (Presumably, you mean Princess Tasmania.)
 Not unexpectedly, Princess Tasmania is arrayed in high platypus
 fashion.

 "My messengers have told me of your quest," continues King Anatinus.
 "Allow me to repay your kindness with words of advice."

 The old platypus motions you to his side. "The Tower of the Evil One is
 formidable," he begins in a low, serious voice. "You will never get
 inside unaided. Legends speak of a Magick Word that can open the gates
 of the Tower. But what Word it is, none can say."

 The king reaches beneath his throne and takes out a small wizard's hat.
 "Take this," he says, holding it out to you.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 41 out of
 100.)

 "Take it to the sea," King Anatinus whispers as you turn the hat in
 your hands. "There you will find a creature learned in the lore of
 Magick. Heed him well! In his wisdom lies your only hope."

 "Wait!" cries the white platypus. "I wish to speak with you!"

 Misty Island

 Time passes.

 At the moment, you hear nothing special.

 You can't see any throne here!

 A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 Misty Island
 You're standing on a fog-shrouded beach. Sheer cliff walls rise to the

 To the west stands a magnificent castle, its parapets rising high into

 You can hear friendly voices and music inside.

 Throne Room

 A fanfare of trumpets breaks the silence, and the crowd falls to its
 knees.

 "Good luck to you, brave Adventurer!" cries King Anatinus, bowing
 deeply. "Now blow into the silver whistle one more time, and deliver us
 from the horror of the Evil One."

 The platypuses look at you expectantly.

 A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 A sudden gust of wind rises out of nowhere, and Misty Island falls away
 beneath your feet. You feel the silver whistle slip from your hand as
 you streak across the lake...








 Lake Edge
 You're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the
 village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking
 south, you can see an open iron gate leading into the Witchville
 Cemetery.

 Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the
 water.

 You can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake.

 Lookout Hill
 You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you
 can see Witchville Village nestled among the trees. A narrow trail
 winds down the north side of the hill, towards the river.

 Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and
 majestic oak tree.

 A horseshoe is lying in the grass near the stump.

 Your load is too heavy.

 Dropped.

 Taken.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots at the bottom of the hill. It
 sounds as if they're coming this way!

 Lifting the hinged top of the stump reveals a round hole leading
 downward into darkness.

 The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic
 leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol!

 You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an
 especially tall Boot. "What have we here?" he hisses. "Out after
 curfew? Tsk, tsk, tsk. I wonder what Sgt. MacGuffin will say about
 this."

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor.
 "What's this?" he demands impatiently.

 "A nightcrawler," hisses the Tall Boot, giving you a vicious little
 kick. "Outside after curfew. Shall I feed it to the sharks?"

 Sgt. MacGuffin shakes his head. "Later. The Tower wants all prisoners
 held for questioning." He turns back to his work. "Cell Three."

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel
 door and stone walls offer little hope for escape.

 The only furnishing is a hard bunk against the wall with a thick
 blanket on it.

 You can see a squashed can, a small stone (providing light), a wizard's
 hat and a horseshoe here.

 The small stone stops glowing.

 The bunk: You can't be serious.
 The thick blanket: Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 44 out of

 The squashed can: Taken.
 The small stone: Taken.
 The wizard's hat: Taken.
 The horseshoe: Taken.

 The small stone begins to glow again.

 Okay, you moved the bunk away from the wall. There's a dark, narrow
 hole in the floor.

 You'll never get into the hole holding all that stuff!

 The horseshoe: Okay, the horseshoe disappears into the hole.
 The wizard's hat: Okay, the wizard's hat disappears into the hole.
 The small stone: Okay, the small stone disappears into the hole.
 The squashed can: Okay, the squashed can disappears into the hole.
 The thick blanket: Okay, the thick blanket disappears into the hole.

 With great effort, you manage to squeeze yourself into the hole.

 Underground
 You're in a smelly underground chamber. Long tunnels wander away to the
 north and west.

 Faint light is streaming in from a narrow hole overhead.

 You can see a thick blanket, a squashed can, a small stone, a wizard's
 hat and a horseshoe here.

 The thick blanket: Taken.
 The squashed can: Taken.
 The small stone: Taken.
 The wizard's hat: Taken.
 The horseshoe: Taken.

 The small stone begins to glow again.

 There's no exit that way.

 Underground
 You're in a dirty underground chamber. Cold tunnels wander away to the
 south, east and west.

 Grue's Nest
 You have stumbled into the nesting place of a family of grues.
 Congratulations. Few indeed are the adventurers who have entered a
 grue's nest and lived as long as you have.

 Everything is littered with rusty swords of elvish workmanship, piles
 of bones and other debris. A closed refrigerator stands in one corner
 of the nest, and something... a small, dangerous-looking little
 beast... is curled up in the other corner.

 The only exit is to the west. Hope you survive long enough to use it.

 Snoring fitfully, the little beast turns away from the light of the
 small stone and faces the wall.

 Okay, the little beast is now covered with the thick blanket.

 The creature stirs restlessly for an anxious moment. Then it settles
 into the comfortable darkness of the thick blanket, sighs gently and
 lies still.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 47 out of

 A light inside the refrigerator goes out as you open it.

 Opening the refrigerator reveals a bottle and an earthworm.

 Taken.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 50 out of

 The earthworm squirms with annoyance at your touch.

 Taken.

 Aside from the ominous implications, you see nothing extraordinary
 about the debris.

 (You don't need to refer to the debris that way to finish this story.)

 A light inside the refrigerator comes on as you close it.

 Okay, the refrigerator is now closed.

 You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Witchville
 Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a neglected marble
 fountain, filled with greasy water.

 A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.

 It lands in the fountain with a splash.

 The piranha snatches away the worm and swims to the far side of the
 fountain to devour it.

 You're on the eastern side of the Witchville Rotary. A street branches
 off to the east, towards the bay.

 Rocky Path
 You're on a rocky path that runs east and west along the banks of the
 Witchville River. A shimmering trail leads south into a dense forest.

 As you walk along the shimmering trail you feel a vague sense of
 disorientation, then a shock of recognition...








 West of House
 You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded
 front door.

 There's a little mailbox here.

 The little mailbox is closed.

 Opening the little mailbox reveals a leaflet.

 The edges of the little mailbox are beginning to twinkle.

 Taken.

 The little mailbox is engulfed in a sparkling aurora! Tremors of
 anticipation run up and down its length, and the air sings with Magick.

 This place has seen better days. Its stately colonial architecture
 reflects the taste and wealth of its builders. But eons of trespassing
 by thoughtless adventurers have left the once noble edifice in ruins.

 With a gentle pop, the little mailbox pulls itself out of the ground
 and cavorts about the grass like a happy rabbit!

 The little mailbox coos with pleasure at your touch.

 The little mailbox notices you and snaps its tiny lid with joy. It
 makes a silly "clump-clump, clump-clump" sound as it hops to your side
 and rubs lovingly against your sleeve.

 As the house disappears into the distance, you get the distinct feeling
 that, someday, you will pass this way again.








 Rocky Path

 Lighthouse
 This is where the river empties into Witchville Bay. A path leads west
 along the riverbank.

 A broken-down old lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands on the shore
 nearby.

 Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through
 half-closed eyelids.

 The pelican sniffs the wizard's hat suspiciously. Its eyes open wide
 with interest, and the wizard's hat quickly finds a place on the
 pelican's head. Then the old bird gives you a sly, knowledgeable wink.

 All at once the lighthouse blazes to life! Its shining beacon whirls
 like a gyroscope, and a pencil-thin beam of light pierces the sky and
 traces a word on a passing cloud: SORKIN.

 The pelican spreads its wings and soars away over the bay. As the beam
 of the lighthouse fades, a voice in your head whispers, "Good luck,
 brave Adventurer!"

 Pleasure Wharf
 You're standing near the remains of the Pleasure Wharf. The Wharf
 extends eastward into Witchville Bay.

 To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious
 electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 A voice behind you growls, "Eat!" You turn to face the sound, but
 there's nobody here except you.

 You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east. It sounds as if

 Video Arcade
 This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op
 video games. The machines are crowded with half-crazed, stunted
 humanoids, who pay no attention to you as they satisfy their thirst for
 electric violence.

 One machine in the corner appears to be deserted.

 A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token."

 The brass token disappears into the slot.

 (Hope you saved your story position.)

 A sudden power drain makes all the other games in the arcade go dim.
 Blue sheets of energy leap from the game machine, surrounding you in an
 incandescent aura. You can feel your molecules being taken apart one at
 a time, analyzed, modulated and broadcast through space. It is not a
 pleasant sensation.








 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Witchville.

 A tower stands in bleak silhouette against the moonlit sky. It rises a
 hundred feet above a barren plateau, and is encircled by a deep moat.
 The only entrances are a closed drawbridge and a dark window near the
 top.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 A synthetic voice says, "Game Over. Insert Token To Play Again."

 (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 64 out of

 The moat is 20 feet wide and filled with black, oily water.

 You'd probably drown in the moat if you went that way.

 (Sorry, but the word "dravbridge" is not in the vocabulary that you can
 use.)

 The drawbridge is closed against the wall of the tower.

 It's wide open, and located a hundred feet above the moat.

 With a great creak of wood and rattle of chains, the drawbridge slowly
 lowers across the moat.

 (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 67 out of
 100.)

 (This might be a good time to SAVE your story position.)

 Vestibule
 You're standing in a dimly-lit vestibule just inside the tower's
 entrance. The drawbridge is opened across the moat to the north. A
 short corridor leads south, into the tower.

 "Turn back, brave Adventurer!"

 You stare in horror at the platypus chained to the floor. It's Princess
 Tasmania!

 (Presumably, you mean Princess Tasmania.)
 A rumbling noise calls your attention away from Princess Tasmania.

 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of...
 Mr. Crisp!

 "Nice of you to drop by," he sneers as a gigantic Boot pins you to the
 ground. "Saves me the bother of tracking you down."








 Torture Chamber
 You're chained up in the corner of a dim, stuffy chamber, deep within
 the bowels of the tower. The walls gleam with obscure medical
 instruments, and a diabolical torture machine occupies most of the
 opposite corner.

 Princess Tasmania is clamped into the torture machine!

 A ladder rises to meet an open hatch in the middle of the ceiling.

 Mr. Crisp is fondling the instruments, one by one.

 Mr. Crisp takes the violet note and stares at it. His face turns pale.
 "Where did this come from?" he whispers, opening it.

 An unbearably sweet expression spreads over his face as he reads. The
 violet note falls from his hands.

 "I've got to run," Mr. Crisp cries, tossing his white lab coat into a
 corner and stuffing his shirttails into his pants. "Violet scolds me
 when I'm late!" He struggles into a hideous velvet blazer, pushes a
 comb through his hair and scampers up the ladder like a little boy.

 The hatch closes with a hollow thud.

 You can't. Mr. Crisp dropped it out of your reach.

 You hear the distant rattle of the drawbridge opening.

 Princess Tasmania breathes a sigh of relief.

 You can see a violet note and a white lab coat here.

 You hear the distant rattle of the drawbridge closing.

 Princess Tasmania strains against her clamps. "Release me from this
 torture machine, brave Adventurer! Only pull down this lever, and I
 shall be freed."

 You can't reach the lever while you're chained up.

 "Please! Pull down this lever and set me free," cries Princess
 Tasmania.

 The white lab coat isn't as clean as the one your doctor wears.

 The chains cut painfully into your wrist as you strain to grasp the
 white lab coat. Your fingertips brush against the collar... There! You
 got it!

 You can see a rusty key inside the white lab coat.

 "The merest pull of the lever will gain my freedom," cries Princess
 Tasmania.

 "Please! Pull down this lever and set me free," cries Princess
 Tasmania.

 The clamps on the torture machine retract, and Princess Tasmania leaps
 off. She's free!

 "Again you spare my unworthy life, brave Adventurer." The platypus
 humbly licks your shoe, to your considerable embarrassment. "My father,
 King Anatinus, does not forget such kindness."

 The little creature produces a silver whistle from her gown and blows
 into it gently. A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.

 "Your journey is not yet ended," she warns as a whirlpool of colored
 light envelops her. "But even if you fail, your deeds shall live
 forever in our legends. Have faith!"

 When the colors fade, Princess Tasmania is gone.

 Okay, you're now wearing the white lab coat.

 Taken.

 You see nothing unusual about the ceiling.

 The open chain is securely bolted into the floor.

 The hatch is closed.

 The heavy hatch opens reluctantly.

 Round Chamber
 You're in a round chamber at the very heart of the tower. The clammy
 stone walls are hung with a series of paintings, all the same size and
 identically framed. Years of neglect have blackened the art almost
 beyond recognition.

 In the corner is an open hatch. Peering downward, you see a ladder
 descending into gloom.

 A corridor disappears to the north, and a damp stairway winds upward
 into the tower.

 There are 13 paintings in the series. It seems to be a tragic sequence
 involving a beautiful princess and a wicked queen.

 Moving aside one of the paintings reveals a metal crank attached to the
 wall.

 As you turn the metal crank you hear the distant rattle of the
 drawbridge opening.

 A big mailbox is nearby.

 A voice behind you growls, "Hungry!" You turn to face the sound, but
 there's nobody here except you.

 The big mailbox seems ordinary enough. Or does it?

 You watch with astonishment as the lid of the big mailbox slowly opens
 by itself, then snaps shut with a clang.

 The little mailbox "clump-clumps" happily into view.

 Time passes.

 The lid of the big mailbox opens again. "I'm hungry!"

 The two mailboxes freeze at the sight of one another.

 The little mailbox snarls and stands protectively by your side. The big
 mailbox emits a frightful growl and throws its lid wide open,
 displaying rows of sharp little teeth. A crowd of postal meters and
 stamp dispensers gathers as the metal warriors circle each other with
 tense, snapping lids.

 With a sudden rush, the little mailbox throws itself at the big mailbox
 and clamps onto its forefoot. The big mailbox roars with anger, bites
 the little mailbox viciously and tries in vain to shake it off. You
 stare in wonder as the fighting boxes swell to twice their normal size,
 then four times larger, eight times!

 The big mailbox frees itself with a savage twist and bends to finish
 its foe. The little mailbox dodges, grips the descending lid and holds
 on for dear life. Locked in mortal combat, the giant boxes roll over
 and over, shaking the earth with the thunder of battle.

 The scene disappears under a cloud of dust. You hear a terrible scream
 of agony, then an even more terrible silence. When the air clears, the
 boxes and spectators are gone.

 This is a movie theater unlike any you've ever seen! The seats are

 There's a noisy movie playing on the screen. A dark corridor leads out

 The screen image is a meaningless blur of colored light.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"

 Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn
 to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of
 Thermofax.

 Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the
 Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon-breath.

 The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in
 its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar
 voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

 Hilltop
 You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.

 To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick
 building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands
 invitingly open.

 Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost
 nearby.

 Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you.

 Okay, what do you want to do now?
 Enter saved game to load: Okay, done.

 Round Chamber
 You're in a round chamber at the very heart of the tower. The clammy
 stone walls are hung with a series of paintings, all the same size and
 identically framed. Years of neglect have blackened the art almost
 beyond recognition. One of the paintings has been moved to reveal a
 metal crank attached to the wall.

 In the corner is a closed hatch.

 A corridor disappears to the north, and a damp stairway winds upward
 into the tower.

 Fuzziness
 Everything around you appears blurry and blurred.

 Wow! As you put on the glasses the room fuses into a solid,
 3-dimensional image.

 Laboratory
 The highest room in the tower is a laboratory, complete with bubbling
 chemicals and foul odors. An antique telescope is mounted near an open
 window to the north, and a control panel occupies most of the south
 wall.

 The only exit is a damp stairway leading downward.

 A black cat is sound asleep in the corner.

 There's a broom here.

 The antique telescope is pointing out the window.

 Peering through the antique telescope makes everything appear much
 closer.

 The antique telescope is bolted securely in place.

 You're standing in a dimly-lit vestibule just inside the tower's
 entrance. The drawbridge is opened across the moat to the north. A
 short corridor leads south, into the tower.

 The hellhound roars a threat as you back away.

 Hilltop

 Outside Cemetery
 You're standing next to an open iron gate that leads west into the
 Witchville Cemetery. A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill.

 The cemetery is a spooky place, especially at night. Are you sure you
 want to go in there?


 You have been warned.

 Clang! A sudden gust of wind blows the iron gate shut in your face.

 You can hear misty voices giggling on the other side, and a loud
 "click" as the gate locks.

 The iron gate is closed.

 The iron gate is much too high.

 The bars of the closed iron gate are 12 feet high, and closely spaced.

 You can't see Chaos here!

 Hilltop

 There are two arrows on the signpost. The arrow pointing west says "To
 Cemetery." The east arrow is marked "To Witchville."

 Wishbringer emits a violet flash of Magick.

 You can hear a faint buzzing sound, like an overheard telephone, coming
 from the conch shell.

 The vulture hovers in the sky high overhead.

 A tiny voice in the conch shell says, "Many wonders await thee in the
 Halls of Knowledge."

 The buzzing sound in the conch shell stops.

 You can feel little icky things sliding down your throat.

 The hellhound glares at you through eyes red with hatred.

 The night becomes very still as you speak the Wish. The hellhound stops
 in mid-roar, cocks its head and sniffs the air nervously.

 All at once a terrifying shadow sweeps across the face of the full
 moon, plunging the landscape into total darkness.

 The hellhound's eyes grow wide with terror. It flops itself down on the
 ground, covers its eyes with its forepaws and moans pitifully in the
 sudden gloom.

 (Thankfully, the icky taste of grue milk is gone.)

 The hellhound howls mournfully in the darkness as you creep past.

 It is pitch black.

 As suddenly as it faded, the light of the moon returns.

 behave."

 The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic
 leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol again!

 You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an
 especially tall Boot. "What!" he cries. "I thought you were locked up
 with Sgt. MacGuffin. Tsk, tsk."

 You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and
 screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station.

 Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor. His
 eyes narrow when he sees you. "Well, well. If it isn't the disappearing
 mail clerk." You open your mouth to reply, but a vicious little kick
 changes your mind. "The Tower wants a chat with this troublemaker."

 "The sharks are getting restless," remarks the Tall Boot hopefully.

 Sgt. MacGuffin smirks. "So is the Evil One."

 Jail Cell
 You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel
 door and stone walls offer little hope for escape.

 The only furnishing is a hard bunk against the wall.

 You can see a small stone (providing light), a bottle, an umbrella, a
 pair of 3D glasses, a violet note, a conch shell and a rusty key here.

 "Your quest is ended, brave Adventurer," says the old woman. "The

 Wishbringer to me, and together we shall rejoice in your success."

 The woman's disguise evaporates in the glare. It's the Evil One, her
 mouth frozen open in a wail of despair as she fades into oblivion. The
 memory of that face will haunt your dreams as long as you live.

 Cliff Edge
 You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail
 leading downward. Looking southeast, you see a friendly orange sun
 rising from a bank of morning clouds.

 Post Office Hill is visible to the south, topped as usual by the

 in a nightgown, stands blinking in the morning sun. "Who's there?"

 The black cat leaps into the woman's arms. "Chaos!" she cries, laughing
 and sobbing all at once as the cat licks tears of joy from her face.

 At last the old woman lowers Chaos to the ground and walks over to
 where you're standing, red with embarrassment.

 "Now you know me for the old liar I am," she chuckles, clasping your
 hands gratefully in her own. "I promised to give you Wishbringer,
 knowing full well that, if you succeeded, its virtue would be lost.

 "In truth, the Stone would make a poor reward," she continues, stooping
 to tickle the cat's white forehead. "As you can see, it brings more joy
 in the shape of a companion than in any other. This is Wishbringer's
 finest Magick. A pity that my sister, the Evil One, did not know of
 it."

 You can hear a familiar "clump-clump, clump-clump" sound behind you.
 It's the little mailbox, hopping bravely up the steep trail! The woman
 looks on with puzzled amusement as the faithful box hops to your side
 and rubs lovingly against your sleeve.

 The old woman touches the violet note in your hand. "Make sure you give
 this to Mr. Crisp when you see him," she says with a sly wink. "And
 tell him I said hello."

 Cradling Chaos in her arms like a child, the old woman ambles back into
 the Magick Shoppe. "Farewell!" she calls from the closing door, and the
 sunlight makes her face look young. "Now you are a true Adventurer."

 A concealed bell tinkles merrily.
