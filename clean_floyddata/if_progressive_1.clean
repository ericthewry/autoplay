 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Four p.m. and they're all gone, every last one of them. Little brats
 made of spittle and claws. Paint-spilling, dirt-tracking,
 crayon-smearing babies in kindergarteners' clothing. The day you took
 your job was the day you lost your mind.

 Not that you have other prospects, though. This is what you've got and
 it isn't all that safe. And besides, it gets better now. Now you make
 order from chaos. Now you spin gold from straw. You're going to wipe
 every last bit of color and clutter off the face of this room and get
 out by five-thirty sharp.

 Classroom
 Is there a national conspiracy to make young eyes pop out by age five
 from overstimulation? Must be. Every last inch of wall space here,
 save for the window, is plastered with needless decor: nature
 caricatures, inspirational glurge, posters with cartoon letters and
 plus signs. The floor's no better; the brats didn't pick up when Miss
 Lauren told them to pick up and now it's cluttered with gaudy plastic.
 The books are tossed into the carpet square pile and someone's dripped
 tempera paint onto every table. You could go on.

>examine me
 What's there to see? Short hair that the kids nevertheless keep
 fussing with, sensible clothes on a stocky frame. Arms, legs, hands,
 feet. Nothing to set you apart.

 You are carrying nothing.

 You look up and then you see it. There's a balloon, floating through
 the window and stopping right in front of your face - no, not stopping
 exactly. Stopping would be too tidy. It's hovering. Balloons shouldn't
 do that. They should stay put on strings. You're sure this has to be
 some kind of fire hazard.

>examine balloon
 When did America decide balloon inflation, of all things, was too hard
 for them? It's got too much air and is liable to pop any minute. All
 the better to accentuate the sub-tie-dye coloring catastrophe. Oranges
 clashing with purples, reds superimposed on top of greens and blues
 turning them into bright but somehow murky muddle. You thought only
 Mylar could support this many godawful neons, but apparently you were
 wrong.

>take balloon
 "Don't touch that!" someone almost shrieks. A kid? No, too old. A
 teacher? Too unfamiliar. You have no idea who this is.

 didn't pick up when Miss Lauren told them to pick up and now it's
 cluttered with gaudy plastic. The books are tossed into the carpet
 square pile and someone's dripped tempera paint onto every table. And
 there's more, it seems, every second. Leaves and dirt by the doorway.
 Shredded paper that's not in the waste bin.

 A balloon hovers around your face, insect-like.

 "Isn't it wonderful? Everything is better with balloons. Now listen to
 me. Today we're going to have some fun!" You're've never heard anyone
 talk this loudly, not even to kids. It's unnerving. "Let's play a
 game. Let's go play outside! Just walk right on out of there. To the
 south."

>examine books
 The kids sit on carpet squares when Miss Lauren reads to them. In a
 perfect world, they'd stack the books separately, but apparently they
 can't tell a book from a carpet. Of course.

>take books
 You dig through the pile a bit, but it just collapses in on itself.
 Ugh.

>ask balloon about game
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine shredded paper
 You can't see any such thing.

 The economic crisis hasn't hit the tacky toy industry, it seems,
 because these things keep multiplying: flimsy chunks of plastic in
 neon colors that really should disappear in the fall, like with
 fashion. In theory they'd disappear into the bin, but these people
 just do not understand theory.

>examine bin
 The toy bin wasn't always bright red. When you started working you
 replaced it with a streamlined, sensible white plastic cube. An oasis
 of good design in this crapstorm. But then it got finger painted, and
 left out in the rain, and finally taken away altogether for this
 monstrosity. It isn't even designed well. The curving of the walls is
 all wrong. It won't let you stack more than a level or two.

>go south

 Hallway
 Really, this was just a glorified hallway. You used to like places
 like this. Tiles and cinderblocks. No-nonsense, nothing gaudy. They do
 just what they promise: take you from room to room without asserting
 themselves. But something's gone terrible wrong. The whole floor is
 lousy with confetti, thick as snow and almost painful to look at.

 "Looks a lot better now, doesn't it?" shouts the voice. You've never
 heard such a loud question. "Now get out. Fast." You notice the door
 to the east is ajar.

 Maybe this is no ordinary fall, but some kind of trip through a
 magical portal into another world!
 Hey, this is just like Alice in Wonderland!
 You're practicing saying "Yes, your majesty, I would care for another
 cup of tea, thank you kindly," when your downward motion is suddenly
 arrested by a large pile of dead leaves.

 Somewhere Rustly
 At least, you assume this is leaves. It's dark enough that you can't
 really tell anything except it's a big pile and you're in the middle
 of it.

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

 You struggle to your feet, strewing rustly stuff everywhere. Somewhere
 in the process of doing so you bump against a light switch or
 something, and things become brighter.

 Shredding Room

 aren't any obvious exits, but the north wall is entirely occupied by
 the backside of a large machine.

>examine leaves
 You can't see any such thing.

 You pick up all the larger pieces you can find. There are four.

 You hear a noise from above your head, and look up just in time to see
 a small metal object falling from the sky. It bounces painfully off
 your head and disappears into the pile of shredded paper.

 You'd think this would be like trying to find a, uh, small metal thing
 in a large pile of other stuff, but in fact it's not that bad, since
 this particular bit of metal talks. "--Come on come on I'm right over
 here this is totally obv--" it is saying as you pick it up. "Finally!
 It's about time you found me!"
 "Uh, what?" you say.
 "It's me! Roz!" And you finally realize it's the same voice as
 earlier. "You popped my balloon! It took me forever to get down here!"

>examine roz
 It's a pyramid-shaped piece of metal which, surprisingly, can talk.
 For instance, right now it says "Quit starin' at me and get on with
 things!"

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a Roz pyramid
   a khaki-colored resume piece
   an ecru-colored resume piece
   a beige-colored resume piece
   a cream-colored resume piece
   a bronze key
   a toilet roll
   a wooden slingshot

 Which do you mean, the khaki-colored resume piece, the ecru-colored
 resume piece, the beige-colored resume piece or the cream-colored
 resume piece?

 This fragment of a resume is printed on khaki-colored paper. Glancing
 over it, you make out a few phrases that seem relevant:
 "Certifications: Pommelation (Basic and Advanced), Chuffling,
 Black-Belt Lean Six Sigma", "Blood type: O"

>ask key about balloon
 You can only do that to something animate.

 This fragment of a resume is printed on ecru-colored paper. Glancing
 over it, you make out a few phrases that seem relevant: "Years of
 experience: 1", "Ever since I was a mere pod, my ambition to be a
 Waffgasketeer has been ..", "Hobbies: Trandozian bass, flapjacks"

 This fragment of a resume is printed on beige-colored paper. Glancing
 over it, you make out a few phrases that seem relevant: "It is my
 fondest hope that as a Jark Inverter I will ..", "Education: Yalneeple
 College of Higher Kurfting, "D4", "With my fifteen years of experience
 .."

 This fragment of a resume is printed on cream-colored paper. Glancing
 over it, you make out a few phrases that seem relevant: "0
 (approximate)", "Scent glands: removed (references available on
 request)", "Languages known: none."

>ask roz about resume
 "Why don't you apply for a new job? I know you hate the one you've
 got. Go for it! This is so exciting!"

>ask roz about balloon
 "I don't think you noticed what was in that balloon back in the
 classroom."

>ask roz about roz
 "I'm Roz! I'm a control unit! I can talk to Sally and Leon and all the
 other units and they have to do what I say."

>ask roz about sally
 "Sally's a teleportation unit. If you want to go visit her, just say
 her name and I'll tell her to bring us in."

>ask roz about leon
 "Leon's a supply unit. He helps me all the time by giving me things
 for playing games with, like confetti and poison gas and marbles and
 explosives and balloons and razor blades."

>ask roz about units
 "There's a bunch of different kinds. There's teleportation units and
 supply units and there's control units like me!"

>look
 Shredding Room
 This room is mostly occupied by a large pile of shredded paper. There
 aren't any obvious exits, but the north wall is entirely occupied by
 the backside of a large machine.

>examine machine
 The machine takes up the entire north wall. Given the circumstances
 and the large label it is easy to identify this as an enormous
 shredder. There is a small hatch near floor level, and a large funnely
 sort of thing up top.

>ask roz about machine
 "I don't know what it's for either."

>examine hatch
 The hatch is labelled "MAINTENANCE". It's closed.

>open it
 You open the hatch.

>look in hatch
 You find nothing of interest.

>enter hatch
 You squeeze your way through the hatch and eventually come out the
 other side.

 Conference Hall
 This is a big open area. Hundreds of beings of all heights, colors,
 eyestalkitude and tentaclosity are wandering around, visiting little
 booths, and waving bits of paper, but mostly they're standing in line.

 The room (and the crowd) stretches out in all directions except south,
 where the whole wall is taken up by the giant shredder.

 Some have fur, some have claws, some have tails, some have ears, some
 have green skin, some have blue skin. But judging by the papers
 they're holding, what they all have is a determination to get a job.

 "What does he mean, overqualified?" says a furred lizard-thing,
 angrily, to its scaled bear-thing companion. "I have a mere sixteen
 years of experience!"

>examine booths
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine lines
 The line of interviewees snakes (literally, for some of them) through
 the conference hall. You suppose you could wait in it if you really
 wanted to. It must be better than substitute teaching.

>wait in line
 You get into the line, and wait. And wait, and wait. Eventually you
 reach the front, where you are scrutinized by a sort of mutant
 crab-zebra thing. "WHERE'S YOUR RESUME?" it roars. "GET OUT OF HERE!"
 To the accompaniment of menacing pincer snaps and glares from the
 other interviewees, you slink out of the line.

 A nearby vendor suddenly leaps out of her booth. "I hate this job!"
 she shouts. "I'm finding a new one!" She disappears into the crowd,
 leaving the empty booth abandoned behind her. You look over at it,
 curiously.

>enter booth
 That's not something you can enter.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

 "No, no, that won't do at all," says an interviewer at one of the
 booths to a gelatinous blob. "I'm afraid chuffling certification is an
 absolute requirement for any job here." The blob jiggles unhappily and
 oozes away. The interviewer shrugs and shoves the blob's resume into a
 nearby tube, where it's immediately sucked out of sight.

>sit at booth
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>examine booth
 This display booth is empty, at least of people. A colorful sign on
 the booth says "THE AMAZING UNSHRED-O-MATIC" and sitting on the booth
 is what you presume to be the unshred-o-matic in question.

 A mime uses its tentacles to give an impromptu demonstration of being
 trapped in an invisible rocket ship and walking against a tractor
 beam. Its interviewer is unimpressed, however, and consigns the mime's
 resume to a shredder tube.

 You can't see any such thing.

 "Only four years?" a green chimpanzee says to a blue chimpanzee.
 "They'll never take anyone with that little."

>put khaki in unshred-o-matic
 You put the khaki-colored resume piece into the unshred-o-matic.

>put ecru in it
 That can't contain things.

 Two aliens get into an argument over who was next in line. The debate
 is resolved when the smaller one unhinges its jaw surprisingly far and
 eats the other.

>opps unshred-o-matic
 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>put all pieces in unshred-o-matic
 ecru-colored resume piece: Done.
 beige-colored resume piece: Done.
 cream-colored resume piece: Done.

>put ecru in unshred-o-matic
 You need to be holding the ecru-colored resume piece before you can
 put it into something else.

 An armadillo-like alien has a conversation with a vendor in a nearby
 booth about their new line of metallic post-it notes.

>press button
 You push the unshredder button. The unshredder hums in a pleased
 fashion, then sucks in all the scraps in its bin. There is a brief
 rrihw, and then a tan resume comes out the top of the unshredder. You
 pick it up.

>wait in line
 You get into the line, and wait. And wait, and wait. Eventually you
 reach the front, where you are scrutinized by a sort of mutant
 crab-zebra thing. "GIVE ME THAT RESUME!" it roars, snatching it from
 you. Then it produces a pair of surprisingly small spectacles and
 settles them on its eyestalks as it reads over your resume. "Good ..
 good .. nice genetic structure .. excellent center of mass .."
 Suddenly it stops and looks up at you. "YOU'RE OVERQUALIFIED!". With
 one enormous claw, it shoves your resume into a nearby tube which, you
 fear, leads directly to the shredder. "GET OUT OF HERE!" To the
 accompaniment of menacing pincer snaps and glares from the other
 interviewees, you slink out of the line.

 A mime uses its tentacles to give an impromptu demonstration of being

 You squeeze your way through the hatch and eventually come out the
 other side.

 Conference Hall
 This is a big open area. Hundreds of beings of all heights, colors,
 eyestalkitude and tentaclosity are wandering around, visiting little
 booths, and waving bits of paper, but mostly they're standing in line.

 The room (and the crowd) stretches out in all directions except south,
 where the whole wall is taken up by the giant shredder. Nearby you
 notice a small, unstaffed booth.

>put all pieces into unshred-o-matic
 khaki-colored resume piece: Done.
 ecru-colored resume piece: Done.
 cream-colored resume piece: Done.

 "No, no, that won't do at all," says an interviewer at one of the
 booths to a gelatinous blob. "I'm afraid chuffling certification is an
 absolute requirement for any job here." The blob jiggles unhappily and
 oozes away. The interviewer shrugs and shoves the blob's resume into a
 nearby tube, where it's immediately sucked out of sight.

>put toilet in unshred-o-matic
 You put the toilet roll into the unshred-o-matic.

>press button
 You push the unshredder button. Nothing happens besides an angry buzz,
 probably because the unshredder has something in it that it doesn't
 know how to unshred.

 An armadillo-like alien has a conversation with a vendor in a nearby
 booth about their new line of metallic post-it notes.

>take toilet paper
 I only understood you as far as wanting to take the toilet roll.

>take toilet roll
 Taken.

>take toilet
 You already have that.

 Two aliens get into an argument over who was next in line. The debate
 is resolved when the smaller one unhinges its jaw surprisingly far and
 eats the other.

>press button
 You push the unshredder button. The unshredder hums in a pleased
 fashion, then sucks in all the scraps in its bin. There is a brief
 rrihw, and then a tan resume comes out the top of the unshredder. You
 pick it up and discard the remaining resume pieces.

>examine tan
 The resume lists a number of hobbies and qualifications you don't
 really understand, but you do manage to make out a claim of 10 years
 of experience, a request for a position as a Waffgasketeer, and
 multiple certifications.

 "Only four years?" a green chimpanzee says to a blue chimpanzee.
 "They'll never take anyone with that little."

>examine tan

>wait in line
 You get into the line, and wait. And wait, and wait. Eventually you
 reach the front, where you are scrutinized by a sort of mutant
 crab-zebra thing. "GIVE ME THAT RESUME!" it roars, snatching it from
 you. Then it produces a pair of surprisingly small spectacles and
 settles them on its eyestalks as it reads over your resume. "Good ..
 good .. nice genetic structure .. excellent center of mass .."
 Suddenly it stops and looks up at you. "YOU'LL DO." Before you can
 react, it has grabbed you and shoved you through the door behind it.
 "HR WILL BE IN TOUCH" is the last thing you hear as the door closes
 again.

 "Thank goodness I'm here!," Roz says.

 "Yessir, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have any way of getting
 out," Roz says.

 "That's boring."

 "If you want help getting out of here, just ask," Roz says.

 You can't see any such thing.

 "Stop talking and do something interesting!"

 "Ask me, that is," Roz says. "If you weren't sure."

>sally
 The Roz pyramid brightly says "Aye-aye!"
 You have a moment of vertigo, and suddenly you're elsewhere.

 Guts of the Machine
 This is a cramped hollow inside some kind of mechanism.  Cogwheels
 poke your ribs as the smell of machine oil assaults your nostrils. A
 rusty hatch is latched shut.

 And yet, someone must be spending a lot of time in here, because
 there's a small cot resting on a couple of planks.

 On the small cot are a Sally pyramid and a dream diary.

>examine pyramid
 (the Roz pyramid)
 It's a pyramid-shaped piece of metal which, surprisingly, can talk.
 For instance, right now it says "Quit starin' at me and get on with
 things!"

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

 Taken.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the dream diary.

>take diary
 Taken.

 "I've been having really weird dreams since I started sleeping in the
 machine on top of the old abandoned school, so I thought I should try
 to write them down and figure out what they mean. I'll start with the
 dream I had las night: I was in some kind of lab or military complex
 or something in a dystopian future, and they were doing something with
 corn. The corn was very sinister, very menacing. I think it
 represented death. In the end I escaped the whole thing in a
 rocketship, which is a blatant phallic symbol. So I guess that's about
 sex as a bid for immortality or something? I dunno, my subconscious
 has weird ideas sometimes."

 "Day 2. Last night's dream was one of those shifting ones than never
 really settles on a theme. At first I was a spy or something, and I
 was trying to escape from enemies in a hotel which was also a lab
 which was also a sultan's palace, or something like that. And I
 escaped them by rail through some kind of fantasy kingdom accompanied
 by a weasel. I'm having trouble finding symbols here. I guess the
 sense of running away from things was strong, but only in the
 beginning."

 "Day 3. I was back in my old house, the one from before I moved to the
 machine, but it was empty, and the world was ruled by insectoid
 aliens, but I just accepted that as good, because they had
 mind-control powers or something. I escaped by riding a missile
 (another blatant phallic symbol), and wound up on the moon, in another
 of those strange laboratories which seem to be the most common feature
 of my dreams these days. Maybe this is has something to do with those
 four days I can't remember? I was guided some of the time by a
 disembodied voice, which is traditionally supposed to be a
 manifestation of the divine or something. I hope I don't start hearing
 it in real life."

>again
 "Day 4. I was in the desert, which shifted between being a
 post-apocalyptic wasteland and the outskirts of Las Vegas and I think
 Egypt at one point. I was looking for a treasure, which turned out to
 be a goddess, and a blatantly erotic one too. Putting her at the end
 of a search in the desert is probably a sorry commentary on my sex
 life. The only other thing I remember was a disgusting dog who kept
 showing up and hindered me at every turn. I think he represented my
 father."

 "Day 5. I don't remember a lot about this dream, but I have a feeling
 it was more coherent than the others. I was back in the old school,
 cleaning up after the children, and there was a disembodied voice that
 wanted me to stop working there. But then the voice turned out to be
 coming from a small metal pyramid, just like the one I use as a
 pillow. There were lots of pyramids like that, and they had names like
 Sally and Jojo. That's all I remember."

>ask roz about jojo
 "Jojo, she left us. Wanted a solitary life, on one of those empty
 backwater planets. Guess you could visit her, if you need a vacation."

 You can't see any such thing.

 Hut
 This hut, wherever it may be, is made of thick glass, distorting the
 outside to something like a watercolor painting. A foam rubber
 mattress and a wardrobe seem to be the only bits of furniture. The
 doorway outside is south.

 In the middle of the hut sits an old-fashioned oven. It is connected
 by loose wires, through a hole in the ceiling, to some sort of dish on
 top of the hut.

 In a corner sits a robot. It looks like an old TV-set with metal
 tentacles attached. Inside, through a glass window, you can see one of
 the pyramids.
 It holds a scrap of green, continous paper in one of the tentacles.

 You can also see a bowl (empty) here.

>go south
 You step outside and find yourself under a clear, disturbingly puple
 sky, where yellow lightning flashes silently in dark, grey clouds. The
 air is humid and humming with life. Almost invisible, transparent
 insects swirl round your head, and in the distance, some unseen birds
 chirp and flutter.The hut and it's surroundings seem to be inside some
 sort of transparent energy dome.

 The Pen
 Short, green grass extends to the foot of the protective dome. In the
 middle of this meadow sits a pen. Mountains  border on the dome to the
 east, and there seems to be a small pond to the west.

 Every last inch of wall space here, save for the window, is plastered

 didn't pick up when Miss Lauren told them to pick up and now it's
 cluttered with gaudy plastic. The books are tossed into the carpet
 square pile and someone's dripped tempera paint onto every table. And
 there's more, it seems, every second. Leaves and dirt by the doorway.

 Classroom
 Every last inch of wall space here, save for the window, is plastered
 with needless decor: nature caricatures, inspirational glurge, posters
 with cartoon letters and plus signs. The floor's no better; the brats
 didn't pick up when Miss Lauren told them to pick up and now it's
 cluttered with gaudy plastic. The books are tossed into the carpet
 square pile and someone's dripped tempera paint onto every table. And
 there's more, it seems, every second. Leaves and dirt by the doorway.
 Shredded paper that's not in the waste bin.

>go south

 Hallway
 Really, this was just a glorified hallway. You used to like places
 like this. Tiles and cinderblocks. No-nonsense, nothing gaudy. They do
 just what they promise: take you from room to room without asserting
 themselves. But something's gone terrible wrong. The whole floor is
 lousy with confetti, thick as snow and almost painful to look at. The
 door is ajar, swinging a bit in the breeze.

>go east

 Behind School
 The students aren't usually allowed back here. You can go north,
 south, or east.

>go north

 Outside School
 You've never been to this area before. A brown door is east, and south
 is behind the school (technically south is also outside the school,
 but we have to tell them apart somehow).

>go east

 Dark Entryway
 The light is dim, and exits are west and east.

>go east
 Well, the floor to the east is basically an open pit now, but you know
 the fall is survivable. So after a brief hesitation, you fling
 yourself in.

 Shredding Room
 This room is mostly occupied by a large pile of shredded paper. There
 aren't any obvious exits, but the north wall is entirely occupied by
 the backside of a large machine.

>go north
 You squeeze your way through the hatch and eventually come out the
 other side.

 Conference Hall
 This is a big open area. Hundreds of beings of all heights, colors,
 eyestalkitude and tentaclosity are wandering around, visiting little
 booths, and waving bits of paper, but mostly they're standing in line.

 The room (and the crowd) stretches out in all directions except south,
 where the whole wall is taken up by the giant shredder. Nearby you
 notice a small, unstaffed booth.

 "No, no, that won't do at all," says an interviewer at one of the
 booths to a gelatinous blob. "I'm afraid chuffling certification is an
 absolute requirement for any job here." The blob jiggles unhappily and
 oozes away. The interviewer shrugs and shoves the blob's resume into a
 nearby tube, where it's immediately sucked out of sight.

>examine shredder
 On this side, the shredder has a number of tubes leading into it, and,
 of course, the maintenance hatch near the bottom.

>put rock in shredder
 You squeeze the rock into one of the tubes, ignoring the looks from
 the surrounding beings. The shredder makes some horrible gnashing
 noises, but  you think you heair a faint sputtering from the Shredder
 room.

 "Only four years?" a green chimpanzee says to a blue chimpanzee.
 "They'll never take anyone with that little."

 Hut
 This hut, wherever it may be, is made of thick glass, distorting the
 outside to something like a watercolor painting. A foam rubber
 mattress and a wardrobe seem to be the only bits of furniture. The
 doorway outside is south.

 In the middle of the hut sits an old-fashioned oven. It is connected
 by loose wires, through a hole in the ceiling, to some sort of dish on
 top of the hut.

 In a corner sits a robot. It looks like an old TV-set with metal
 tentacles attached. Inside, through a glass window, you can see one of
 the pyramids.

 You push off into the throng of passers-by, and skilfully guide your
 new hot-rod through the vast HR cubicle maze.  Or, y'know, maybe the
 workers here are just avoiding the maniac on the chair.  Eventually
 you make a wrong turn and the wheels catch on the threshold of an
 office doorway.  The chair tips over and you're dumped onto the floor.

 As you slowly get up, you hear the door swing shut behind you.

 HR Office
 Unlike the cubicles outside, this office has a real door and a real
 window.  The noise of the HR worker bees outside is almost completely
 shut out. You look around in wonder, and see a desk, a chair, some
 paintings on the wall, and a fake potted plant.

 Before you can react, a question is shot at you like an arrow that's,
 um, question-mark shaped.

 "Who the hell are you?" asks the questioner in a booming voice.

 You spin around to see a large and imposing man turn towards you, a
 sweaty hand clicking the door carefully shut. You stammer out an
 introduction and the man relaxes (just a little).

 "Ah," he says.  "I am Mr Hokensox.  Your resume was sent along by one
 of our lobster-horses."

 "Oh, I thought it was a crab-zebra," you venture.

 "Ah, no, although they do like to get stripe tattoos, don't they?
 Have a seat and we'll get your forms sorted and set up your
 orientation schedule."

 You can also see a small wooden chair here.

>sit on chair
 (the small wooden chair)
 You sit uncomfortably down in the wooden chair and look up at Mr.
 Hokensox.

   He peers more at the papers in his hand and says, "I see that you
 used to be a teacher.  You should fit in quite well here.  We have
 numerous people who act like kids.  Ha ha."

 You smile weakly, thinking that you have landed somwhere very much
 like where you left.

 "Hmm... Okay, please have these forms filled out by your orientation,
 which starts in one hour."

  Mr. Hockensox hands you forms XY11, UT18 and TB06.
 "Now," says Mr Hokensox, "let me show you to your new workplace."

 Mr Hokensox puffs around the desk and unlocks the door.  He leads you
 out into the main office again, and then through a maze of cubicles.
 You try to concentrate on the path you take, but soon you're
 hopelessly lost.  He stops abruptly in front of a cubicle that looks
 like every other one.  "Here you are, cubicle number 78-33183.  I'll
 leave you to get settled in and fill out those forms.  If you have any
 questions, don't hesitate to ask."

 Before you can draw in a breath, Mr Hokensox turns and leaves with
 such a speed that defies his size, leaving you alone clutching your
 forms.

 Cubicle 78-33183
 Four grey walls.  At least the school had some more color than this.

 from behind you, "Oh hi!  You must be the new person!"

 You spin around to see someone (something?) walking toward you.  It's
 hard to tell behind the pile of papers this person is carrying.

 "I'm Ferd.  I've been assigned as your orientation guide!"
