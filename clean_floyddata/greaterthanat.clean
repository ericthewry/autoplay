 This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this
 is your final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets
 shampooed and the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the
 last load of laundry, make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while
 the carpets dry.

 However, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a
 small toy car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west
 while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than
 any other direction, unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a
 banister. Your head's progression is significantly hampered by this
 obstruction, and as the resulting 'THUMP' resonates throughout the
 house, your head decides it isn't worth staying awake to investigate
 further.

 You awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a
 little foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of
 touch....

 On the Floor

 You are lying on the floor staring at the ceiling. Your head feels
 surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel
 quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>about
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a gold watch (being worn)

>examine watch

 The dainty wristwatch is made from 18kt gold and shines like the sun.

>examine ceiling
 You see nothing special about the ceiling.

>read watch
 (the gold watch)
 The dainty wristwatch is made from 18kt gold and shines like the sun.

>stand
 Just as you start to move, a grizzly little man about four feet tall
 wearing a red scarf and a black cowboy hat comes in from the bedroom
 to the north. After a quick glance, the little man bends over and
 extracts your gold watch from your wrist in one swift movement. As the
 man examines the watch, a raspy voice yells out, "Frank, get yer
 carcass outta here and down below where ya belong. Dadgummit anyhow!"
 The startled little man looks around and runs to the north with spurs
 clattering. Something drops from his pocket during his hasty exit.

 On the Floor

 You are lying on the floor staring at the ceiling. Your head feels
 surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel
 quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.

>get up
 You clamber to your feet.

 Upstairs Hallway
 The upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between
 several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north,
 northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.

 You can see a blue gumball and a little toy car here.

>take all
 blue gumball: As you reach for the gumball, a little gnomish man in a
 cowboy hat comes in from your bedroom and picks up the gum, examines
 it and says:

 "Well looky here, I thought I heard a commotion up here. Ol' Frank
 Biscuit thought he was goin' to pull off a fast one I reckon, stealin'
 my special gum and all. What that hick won't do to raise hell! One of
 these days, Beetlebaum and I are goin' to have to do sumpin 'bout him.
 Please excuse me, ma'am."

 The little gnome tips his hat and heads off to your bedroom.
 little toy car: Taken.

>examine car
 The toy car is a little red Corvette with a crushed front end.

>go north

 Master Bedroom
 While considerably better than your children's rooms, your room is
 also a little bit on the messy side. There is a king-size bed here
 with mountains of assorted pillows. A masterfully finished dresser
 graces the south wall. To the south is the hallway and a bathroom is
 off to the west.

 You can see a little gnome here.

 The little man stands about three feet high, has a dark brown beard
 and steely blue eyes with a mischievous gleam to them. He is wearing a
 tattered tan cowboy hat and a pair of cowboy boots that look several
 sizes too large. He also sports a decorative brown belt with a huge
 brass belt buckle engraved with the word "GEORGE." In one hand, the
 little man is carrying a brown bag.

 The little gnome stares at you as if he were sizing you up.

>ask gnome about gum
 The gnome chortles, "Oh, just it's just sumpin I whipped up at home.
 Oops, speakin' of home, I got supper cookin'. Gotta go, ma'am!" And
 with that, the little gnome tips his hat and heads west to the
 bathroom.


 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Master Bedroom
 [Previous turn undone.]

 [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]

>verbose






 TRYST OF FATE is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long
 descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>look under bed
 Nothing here but dust and dirty magazines.

>get magazines
 That would only serve to further confuse your already bewildered
 husband.

 You achieve nothing by this.

>search pillows
 You find nothing of interest.

>get pillows
 That's hardly portable.

>examine dresser
 The dresser is made out of maple carefully finished with Danish oil.
 Further study makes you marvel at what an accomplished craftsman your
 husband is. One drawer draws your attention away from this stunning
 20th century achievement.

 You can't see inside, since the drawer is closed.

>open drawer
 You open the drawer, revealing a pair of garden gloves.

 These are your garden variety garden gloves with little raised dimples
 for extra grip.

 Taken.

>examine bed
 The king size bed is covered with a flowery comforter and assorted
 pillows.

>examine comforter
 You can't see any such thing.

 You find nothing of interest.

 graces the south wall. To the south is the hallway and a bathroom is

 Master Bathroom
 Beautiful plants hang down from the ceiling and ceramic cherubims
 watch your every move in this small area off of the master bedroom to
 the east. To the south is a spacious walk-in closet with mirrored
 doors.

 The closet door is closed.

 You can also see a little gnome here.

>gnome, hello
 There is no reply.

>attack gnome
 The gnome laughs at your halfhearted attempt and says "Now that ain't
 neighborly at all! I'm a-ginnin' to think you got a mean streak like
 ol' Frank."

>ask gnome about Frank
 "Don't go messin' with Frank. He's got such a mean streak that he
 makes the devil nervous."

>ask gnome about watch
 "I don't know what yer talkin' about.

>tell gnome about watch
 This provokes no reaction.

>ask gnome about gnomes
 "I don't know what yer talkin' about.

>ask gnome about himself
 "I don't know what yer talkin' about.

>ask gnome about gnome
 "Tain't no business of yours."

>examine gnome
 The little man stands about three feet high, has a dark brown beard
 and steely blue eyes with a mischievous gleam to them. He is wearing a
 tattered tan cowboy hat and a pair of cowboy boots that look several
 sizes too large. He also sports a decorative brown belt with a huge
 brass belt buckle engraved with the word "GEORGE." In one hand, the
 little man is carrying a brown bag.

>ask gnome about george
 "Tain't no business of yours."

>ask gnome about bag
 "Just sumpin I's been haulin around."

>ask gnome about home
 "I don't know what yer talkin' about.

>take bag
 "Well ma'am, sorry to trouble y'all with ol' Frank there, but he
 shouldn't be botherin' you no more. Why don't y'all take this here bag
 for yer trouble. I best be gettin' back. So long!"

 And with that the little gnome sets down the bag, opens the closet
 door, enters the closet, and then closes the door. You hear George
 mumble a few words from behind the door and then the muffled sound of
 machinery. Then all is silent.
 Taken.

>examine bag
 This garish bag looks like something from another century. The heavily
 cracked leather is inset with faded brown cloth strips lined with dull
 brass buttons. Down the top of the bag is a long rusted zipper.

 The zipper is too rusted to move.

 You put on the pair of garden gloves.

 Nothing obvious happens.

>open door
 For some reason, the closet door won't budge.

>open bag
 The zipper is too rusted to move.

 walk-in closet.

 Mark's Room
 Although you just finished cleaning this room an hour ago, it now
 looks like it hasn't been cleaned in about three weeks. The bed looks
 like it has been jumped on by an entire preschool. Dirty clothes are
 thoughtfully sprinkled across the floor, interspersed with assorted
 toys and food items. You can exit this mess to the south.

 Somehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the
 carpet.

 You can also see a bench here.

 The sturdy green bench stands about a foot tall.

 The food consists mostly of crumbs and other unrecognizable
 nourishment.

 of small pieces lost long ago.

 Under a rather large pile of clothes, you uncover a somewhat
 sleepy-looking black cat.

 Taken.

 The old black stray is not all that much to look at, but he gets along
 well with the children.

>pet cat
 You stroke the cat's silky black coat and scratch behind his ears. The
 cat purrs loudly.

 The black cat sits by your feet and purrs.

 The free-spirited cat resists your attempt to hold him.

 couple of toys to boot. The hallway is just a couple of steps to the
 west.

 There is a pinkish shower curtain here.

 The black cat runs into the room and rubs up against your legs.

 The ringing in your ears is very annoying.

 a mountain of clothing in front of the closet. The hallway is to the
 north.

>open closet
 You open the closet, revealing a toy black safe.

 The black cat sits by your feet and purrs.

>examine safe
 It's a small black metal box about six inches high with a small

 type of safe frequently shown in gangster movies. Mark has played with
 this thing for hours since getting it from his uncle. The safe door is
 shut and apparently locked.

 Your husband strolls into the room looking for his beer. Not seeing it

 Master Bedroom
 While considerably better than your children's rooms, your room is

 Inside Somewhere
 You are inside a windowless room constructed of rough-cut timber.
 There isn't all that much room to move around since the place is
 cluttered with cauldrons, books, a large dusty table, pencil sketches,
 and assorted equipment. Large holes and splits in the ceiling provide
 more than enough light to make out that this is some type of crude
 laboratory. The only apparent exit is a door to the west.

 On the table is a piece of paper.

 The paper is face down on the table, but through the stains you can
 just make out there is a picture and some writing on the other side.

>examine book
 The book is open to some dissertation about the partial transformation
 effects of previously chewed gumballs. The text is too complex for
 your meager intelligence.

>examine sketches
 There are several pencil sketches scattered throughout the room. Most
 follow a general western genre (stagecoaches, wagons, horses, cattle,
 etc.). One sketch depicts a crude wooden drilling rig with the
 description "Tom's Chuck." Another sketch, lying face down on the
 table, has numerous water and coffee stains.

 The door suddenly opens from a huge blast of wind. A dust cloud swirls

 deafening.

 And then, all is calm.

 Upstairs Hallway
 The upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between

 Although you just finished cleaning this room an hour ago, it now

 thoughtfully sprinkled across the floor, interspersed with assorted
 toys and food items. You can exit this mess to the south.

 You can see Mark here.

>examine mark
 Mark (your son, remember?) is a little boy quickly approaching the
 lofty age of six years. He is sitting Indian style on the ground
 playing with a tired green Lincoln Log stick and a yellow Tinker Toy,
 telling himself an elaborate story that apparently involves lots of
 explosions. He appears quite involved in his activity and does not
 seem the least interested in your presence.

 proceeds to repair the damaged toy. Within minutes, the toy is as good

 colors in the room. You quickly begin to have misgivings about this
 whole thing as the smell of wildflowers wafts through the air. Mere
 misgivings give way to total apprehension as your focus starts to

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick
 with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water
 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

 Saloon
 This old beer hall served its last cold one many summers past. The
 rosewood bar stretches from wall to wall and, surprisingly, the
 wall-length mirror in back of the bar is still intact. The brass foot
 rail at the base of the bar is worn flat on the top from the countless
 patrons whose hard-earned wages were quickly converted into good times
 and song. Swinging doors lead back to the street to the north.

 You can see a table, a slot machine and a tray (which is empty) here.

 The free-standing slot machine bears a sign declaring:

 "HAPPY DAYS - 10 TRIES FOR 1 BUCK-A-BIN."

 The machine has a lever on the right-hand side, a coin slot on the
 top, and a large metal tray at the bottom. There are three tumblers on
 the front of the machine behind a scratched piece of glass. On the
 left-hand side of the machine are five small wheels. Above each of the
 wheels is a letter, which collectively spell out the word "AHEAD."

>examine first wheel
 The first wheel is set to 1.

>examine second wheel
 The second wheel is set to 2.

>examine third wheel

>examine tumblers
 The tumblers show:

 Bottle  Tumbleweed  Saddle


>examine wheels
 The collection of wheels reads as follows:

 The first wheel  (letter 'A') is set to 1.
 The second wheel (letter 'H') is set to 2.
 The third wheel  (letter 'E') is set to 3.
 The fourth wheel (letter 'A') is set to 4.
 The fifth wheel  (letter 'D') is set to 5.

>examine tray
 The tray is positioned at the bottom of the machine and is large
 enough to hold a king's ransom.

>examine table
 This round table is standing on three legs (versus its last leg). The
 surface is marred with nicks, scratches and even a little bit of
 writing.

>examine writing
 The writing is pretty much your ordinary bar graffiti with even an
 occasional heart and arrow. However, as you study the crude lettering
 you find some kind of note has evidently been scrawled into the
 surface. The letters are so dark with grime they are indistinguishable
 from the table surface.

>clean table
 Perhaps if you had something to clean the table with.

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick
 with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water
 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

>go north

 Bank
 Abandoned teller windows line the west wall of this former financial
 hub of the Deadeye community. Not unlike everything else in town, it
 too has fallen into disrepair. To the north you can make out an open
 vault and to the south lies Main Street.

 There is a rusted pan lying over in the corner.

>examine pan
 The pan is about 16 inches in diameter and 3 inches deep. The walls of
 the pan slope gently inward to produce a 10-inch bottom base. The
 surface of the pan is entirely rusted.

>examine vault
 The vault is built into the north wall. Strangely, the anticipated
 massive door is nowhere to be seen.

 Vault
 This red brick enclosure has been picked clean of its valuables,
 bringing to mind the adage "A Day Late, and a Dollar Short." A large
 wooden table dominates the center of the room supporting some type of
 mechanical contraption. The rest of the bank lies to the south.

>examine table
 The wooden table is made from oak and supports some strange mechanical
 device.

>examine device
 The contraption has a metal block just an inch or so above a metal
 plate with a small circular impression. A series of gears connects the
 metal block to a lever.

 Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and

 General Store
 The musty smell of rotting wood greets your arrival at this rather
 dark dry goods store. An empty wood and glass counter parallel to the
 east wall displays mere remnants of the grains, sugar, fruit, and
 candy once plentiful in each of the adjacent bins. The shelves behind
 the counter are now only a repository for dust and a framework for
 countless cobwebs. The wooden floorboards, once sanded and polished,
 are now buckled and decrepit. A pair of broken doors leads out to the
 south and an open screen door leads to the west.

 One of the floorboards squeaks when you step on it.

 On the shelves are a stack of gum base and a box (which is closed).

 The torn cloth in the screen door flaps gently from a barely
 perceptible breeze.

>examine gum base
 The stack consists of a number of squares labeled "Uncle Wrigley's

 "Mon Cheri's Tea Sugar."

 whole thing would probably be grounds for a lynching.

 Garden
 This small fenced-in area was once a garden, probably for the private
 use of the store's proprietor. Weeds now blanket the dark soil where
 once beans, carrots, potatoes, and the like thrived in the hot summer.
 In one corner of the garden, however, a single corn stalk has made its
 way skyward supported by the fence. A screen door to the east leads
 back into the store.

>examine stalk
 The corn stalk is dried to a crisp from the lack of water and there
 isn't a single ear left. There are, however, a couple of kernels of
 corn tucked away in the leaves of the stalk.

 Unattended Trees
 The east-west trail here is lined by scraggly sycamore trees that look
 more dead than alive. Even the few birds' nests tucked away in the
 upper branches look poorly constructed and uninhabitable.

>climb tree
 After selecting a promising candidate, you carefully scale the trunk.
 After a few moments you find yourself at...

 Tree Top
 The upper branches of this tree are almost totally bare of leaves. One
 branch within reach supports a deserted bird's nest which looks a
 whisper away from nonexistence. Further travel up the tree does not
 look promising since, basically, there is no more tree.

 Top of Crow Hill
 The whole valley is revealed to you as you approach the summit. To the
 east, you see the largely decaying town of Deadeye Gulch, and just
 further, the small knoll known as Boot Hill. To the south, the dusty
 valley floor unfolds, divided by a small tree-lined creek. Large snowy
 mountains abut the hill to the north while endless badlands reach out
 seemingly forever to the west. The main trail continues around the
 hill to the west and down to the southwest, whereas a faint side trail
 heads towards the crest to the north.

>go south
 You can proceed up the hill, down the hill, or over to the west.

 As you proceed up the hill, your bones start to hurt and you feel like

 Over the Hill
 "I'm too old for this nonsense" is your first thought after a brief
 journey over the crest of the hill to this dirt outcropping on the
 north side. Momentarily ignoring your aching joints and brief memory
 lapses, you spot a trail heading south up the hill. Oddly, the trail
 shows signs of fresh footprints.

 Burned Down Shack
 Wisps of steam rise off of the charred timbers of what was once a
 fair-sized building. Small flames flare up occasionally producing a
 deep crackling sound. Paper-thin pieces of ash float hither and yon.
 An odd-shaped sign lies on the ground.

 George is here staring at the charred remains of his gum factory.

 There is a brass key hanging on George's belt.

 metallic flakes) and a burned sketch here.

 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

>go south

 Saloon
 This old beer hall served its last cold one many summers past. The
 rosewood bar stretches from wall to wall and, surprisingly, the
 wall-length mirror in back of the bar is still intact. The brass foot
 rail at the base of the bar is worn flat on the top from the countless
 patrons whose hard-earned wages were quickly converted into good times
 and song. Swinging doors lead back to the street to the north.

 You can see a table, a slot machine and a tray (which is empty) here.

 The free-standing slot machine bears a sign declaring:

 "HAPPY DAYS - 10 TRIES FOR 1 BUCK-A-BIN."

 The machine has a lever on the right-hand side, a coin slot on the
 top, and a large metal tray at the bottom. There are three tumblers on
 the front of the machine behind a scratched piece of glass. On the
 left-hand side of the machine are five small wheels. Above each of the
 wheels is a letter, which collectively spell out the word "AHEAD."

 The trail here turns to fine dust with only a trace of vegetation. The

 A set of well-worn railroad tracks crosses the north-south trail here.
 The wooden ties have all but disintegrated and the rails are thick
 with bright red rust. The weed ridden-tracks run east-west.

 Broken Track
 The heat is stifling at this barren strip of track seemingly in the
 middle of nowhere. Even the ever present weeds have given up this area
 as hopeless and only a few cacti have managed to gain a foothold in
 the constantly shifting sand. One of the rails has become dislodged,
 forming a six-inch gap on one side of the tracks.

 You are not strong enough by a long shot to move the rail with your
 bare hands.

 Narrow Ravine
 The tracks gradually turn southwest here through a tight ravine cut

 passage only along the tracks themselves.

 The tracks through the ravine are littered with rattlesnakes.

 appear very daunting. It is with little disinterest that you note the
 crescendo of rattles in the area.

>get snake
 I don't suppose the rattlesnakes would care for that.

>go south

 Blind Canyon
 The trail winds its way from the southwest through a shadowy canyon
 formed in the cleft of two large hills. You cannot help but feel
 confined and vulnerable by the sheer walls of this gorge and limited
 visibility in front of you and behind. The trail continues to the
 north.

>go southwest

 Trail
 This northeast-southwest trail has all the appearances of being a main
 thoroughfare prior to becoming overrun with weeds and brush. A narrow
 footpath leads off to the east through the brush.

>go southwest

 Clear Creek
 A briskly moving stream widens here and is shallow enough to cross
 without difficulty. Along one bank where the water slows to a crawl a
 deposit of black magnetite can be seen. The trail continues to the
 northeast and up a small ridge to the southwest.

>examine magnetite
 The black iron oxide particles are quite dense and tend to settle out
 with other heavy minerals and metals such as gold.

>take it
 That's hardly portable.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 The cloth is now soaked with water.

>put water in pan
 You need to be holding the water before you can put it into something

>put pan in water
 The pan is now filled with gravel, sand, and water, making up a brown
 slurry.

>shake pan
 Using your best gold panning technique, you swish the wet slurry
 around, discarding the lighter materials in the process. Your efforts
 are soon rewarded by the discovery of a large gold nugget in the

 Dusty Road
 The trail here turns to fine dust with only a trace of vegetation. The
 wind is howling from the west, blowing dust, sand, and tumbleweeds
 everywhere. A brief respite in the blowing debris allows you to see
 the trail continuing north and an overgrown path going up to the east.

>go north

 Deadeye Gulch
 You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town.
 Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that
 this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures
 are to the west while a large barn-like building is due north. There
 is a faded sign just off to the side of the trail.

>go west

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick
 with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water
 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

>go north

 Bank
 Abandoned teller windows line the west wall of this former financial
 hub of the Deadeye community. Not unlike everything else in town, it
 too has fallen into disrepair. To the north you can make out an open
 vault and to the south lies Main Street.

 There is a hole in one of the floorboards.

>enter vault
 That's not something you can enter.

>go north

 Vault
 This red brick enclosure has been picked clean of its valuables,
 bringing to mind the adage "A Day Late, and a Dollar Short." A large
 wooden table dominates the center of the room supporting some type of
 mechanical contraption. The rest of the bank lies to the south.

>look under table
 Stuck to the bottom of the table is a green note, which you quickly
 retrieve.

 "It's a beautiful day for the race.
 Stooge Hand is the favorite today, Assault is in there.

 Flying Silvester is third.
 And Mother-in-Law nagging in the rear.

 And it's number one and now number two.
 And it's very close.
 It'll be a photo finish or an oil painting.
 And now Louis leads for the left.
 And Louis is an inertia sluggin'.
 And it's battle and now they're tearing hair.

>examine contraption
 The contraption has a metal block just an inch or so above a metal
 plate with a small circular impression. A series of gears connects the
 metal block to a lever.

>put nugget on plate
 Putting things on the impression would achieve nothing.

>put nugget in plate
 You put the gold nugget into the impression.

 The lever moves with hardly any effort at all, pressing the gold
 nugget into something resembling a coin.

 The book is about the size of a small church hymn book. The leather
 cover is quite worn but still displays an array of wonderful artwork
 depicting scenes of cowboys, horses, and wide open vistas. The book is
 slightly singed in places, but more importantly, it appears as if most
 of the pages have been torn out.

 The one remaining page looks like a recipe:

 "QuickDraw McGraw"
 1 square gum base
 1 sprig sage
 1 cube sugar

 Saloon
 This old beer hall served its last cold one many summers past. The
 rosewood bar stretches from wall to wall and, surprisingly, the
 wall-length mirror in back of the bar is still intact. The brass foot
 rail at the base of the bar is worn flat on the top from the countless
 patrons whose hard-earned wages were quickly converted into good times

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick
 with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water
 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

>go east

 Deadeye Gulch
 You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town.
 Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that
 this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures

 is a faded sign just off to the side of the trail.

 Boot Hill
 You are standing atop a large knoll which apparently served as a
 cemetery at some point in time. Remains of a picket fence lie strewn
 about the hillside and most of the gravestones have disintegrated
 beyond recognition. One granite marker at the head of a grassless
 plot, however, remains intact.

 This is more work than it's probably worth, as you have removed about
 2 feet of soil.

 A rather large bird lands on the tombstone and watches your suspicious
 activity.

>examine bird
 The Tombstone Jay (or just T-Jay for short) appears to be a lot more
 hawk than jay. Mixed in with the ash-gray feathers are streaks of red

 imposing taloned feet.

 The rusted square tin declares itself as "Scented Bag Balm" and
 includes these special directions:

 "For minor congestion of the udder due to calving, high feeding,
 bruising or chilling. Using individual towels, thoroughly wash treated
 teats and udder before each milking to avoid contamination of milk.
 After each milking, bathe with plenty of hot water, strip milk out
 clean, dry skin and apply bag balm freely, massaging gently with this
 stiff ointment fifteen minutes twice daily or more often as needed.
 Special scented formula repels flies and other flying insects."

 scattered around the derrick, including a bent-up green and white

 Just Off the Ground, On the Derrick
 You are standing on a slat on the south face of the derrick just a few
 feet off the ground. Inscribed in one of the support beams just off to
 your left is the following:

 "I go around in circles,
 But always straight ahead
 Never complain,
 No matter where I am led.
 What am I?"

 Nola the Derrick Nymph appears and whispers in your ear "To answer the
 riddle, respond 'ANSWER whatever' or 'SAY whatever.'" In an instant,
 the little nymph disappears.

 About Half Way Up, On the Derrick
 You are standing on a slat on the south face of the derrick halfway
 between the top and the base. Scrawled on one of the cross members is
 the following:

 "My life can be measured in hours,
 I serve by being devoured.
 Thin, I am quick
 Fat, I am slow
 Wind is my foe.
 What am I?"

 You can see a nail (on which is a ship wheel) here.

>examine wheel
 The wooden ship wheel is about a foot in diameter and has six spokes
 between the outer rim and the inner hub. The inner hub has a carefully
 milled oval-shaped hole in the middle. There is a small brass plaque
 on one of the spokes.

 The plaque reads:

 "Leroy Raft never left the sea,
 Ruined his ship finding Lorelee;
 Long was his journey, no bride his reward;
 Leroy Raft now lives in misery."

 You are just a few feet from the top of the derrick. One of the
 adjacent slats has the following painted on it:

 "I'm Black, I'm Brown,
 Yellow and Clear;
 I'm often found
 Amongst the Gears.

 Platform, On the Derrick
 You are on a narrow platform at the very top of the oil derrick. The
 platform is spotted with a number of bird droppings. The view from
 here is mostly obstructed by trees, but you can make out the hill with
 the mine to the west.

 You can see a rusted oil can here.

>mix cauldron
 What do you want to mix the cauldron with?

>spoon
 The mixture is difficult to stir at first. But soon, the ingredients
 turn into a viscous mass and the stirring becomes much easier. The
 cauldron starts to get hot and the mixture starts to bubble. Wisps of
 orange smoke are released periodically leaving a sweet aroma in the
 air. The cauldron then begins to shake violently and the orange smoke
 changes to billowing thick ash gray, totally obscuring sight of the
 cauldron. Then, the cauldron cools and the smoke clears revealing a
 small, perfectly spherical orange gumball in the bottom.

 The north-south path widens at the base of a steep rocky hill where an
 apparently large mining operation once stood. Another trail heads off
 to the east. Narrow gauge tracks come down a small knoll to the wide
 entrance carved into the hill. The entrance has been boarded over with
 thick timber and bears the notice "KEEP OUT" in crudely painted red
 letters. There is sign at the top of the entrance.

 An ore car rests on the tracks at the top of the knoll. The car is
 tied by rope to a timber header at the end of the tracks.

 Saloon
 The ol' saloon is hoppin' tonight! Dance girls (ahem) swarm the dusty
 patrons, encouraging them to drink and gamble amongst other
 indiscretions. Above all the whoopin' 'n hollerin', you can just make
 out the tinny ragtime of an unseen brass-tack piano. The barkeep is
 shoveling out drinks to the bar at a furious pace while one of the
 other hired help polishes the wall-length mirror. Swinging doors lead
 back to the street to the north.

 You can see a table here.

 John Bro calls for one of the dance hall girls and whispers something

 (first taking the orange gumball)
 The gum isn't as sweet and flavorful as one might have hoped, but, all
 in all, it's a good chew. The flavor does not last very long and, in
 fact, the gum itself doesn't last very long. In an instant, the gum
 dissolves leaving nothing but a sagey taste in your mouth.
 Nonetheless, you are feeling a bit perkier and your fingers are
 starting to twitch.

 "Here, you might be needin' this," whispers John Bro as he places a

 The bartender pulls out a small flask and takes a swig when no one is

 A big burly man bursts through the swinging doors and yells, "What the
 hell ya think yer doin' missy sittin' at mah table? Hey barkeep, I
 should shoot yer ears off for lettin' this wench clutter up mah place

 Saloon
 The ol' saloon is quieter than a church. Patrons and dance girls line
 the walls to avoid being in the line of fire. The barkeep is huddled
 behind the bar occasionally peeking out to view the situation. The
 rest of the hired help is nowhere to be seen.

 You can see Black Thad McGee and a table here.

>shoot thad
 You close your eyes and let out a shot in the direction of Black Thad
 McGee. The shot veers left, hitting his right-hand pistol and knocking
 it to the floor. The bullet ricochets off the pistol and hits the
 wall-length mirror dead center. The whole mirror gives way, crashing
 to the floor.

 Black Thad shouts, "What ya did that for?!" holding his right thumb in
 obvious pain. Your victory, however, is somewhat short-lived as one of
 the dance hall girls grabs the whiskey bottle and shatters it against
 your head. As your consciousness starts to fade while you're staring
 point blank at the floor, you surmise that the woman just might have
 been Black Thad McGee's girlfriend.


 Saloon
 This old beer hall served its last cold one many summers past. The
 rosewood bar stretches from wall to wall and, unsurprisingly, only a
 few shards remain of the once wall-length mirror in back of the bar.
 In place of the mirror, there is a narrow doorway heading east. The
 brass foot rail at the base of the bar is worn flat on the top from
 the countless patrons whose hard-earned wages were quickly converted
 into good times and song. Swinging doors lead back to the street to
 the north.

 You can see shards of glass, a pair of old cowboy boots, a cauldron

 Bank
 Abandoned teller windows line the west wall of this former financial
 hub of the Deadeye community. Not unlike everything else in town, it
 too has fallen into disrepair. To the north you can make out an open
 vault and to the south lies Main Street.

 There is a hole in one of the floorboards.

 Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and

 appears to pick up a trail leading out of town. Back to the east is
 the center of town.

 General Store
 The musty smell of rotting wood greets your arrival at this rather
 dark dry goods store. An empty wood and glass counter parallel to the
 east wall displays mere remnants of the grains, sugar, fruit, and
 candy once plentiful in each of the adjacent bins. The shelves behind
 the counter are now only a repository for dust and a framework for
 countless cobwebs. The wooden floorboards, once sanded and polished,
 are now buckled and decrepit. A pair of broken doors leads out to the
 south and an open screen door leads to the west.

 One of the floorboards squeaks when you step on it.

 On the shelves are a stack of gum base and a box (which is closed).

 Garden
 This small fenced-in area was once a garden, probably for the private
 use of the store's proprietor. Weeds now blanket the dark soil where
 once beans, carrots, potatoes, and the like thrived in the hot summer.
 In one corner of the garden, however, a single corn stalk has made its
 way skyward supported by the fence. A screen door to the east leads
 back into the store.

 "Deadeye use to be a nice place to live. Lots of good people from all
 'round came to live here. Heck, ya could leave yer horse on the street
 fer a week and nobody'd mess with it."

 "One day back a spell, Black Thad started to hang out 'bout town. He
 were more a pain in the neck than anything. He didn't bother folks
 much at first. Oh sure, he'd shoot up the place and pick a fight at
 the drop of a hat, but he didn't hurt folks too much."

 "'Tweren't long after the Spring rains when Black Thad picked, of all
 things, a fight with a goshdarn woman at the saloon. Heck, ya know,
 Thad was just havin' some fun and the gal shot his thumb off. Now I'll
 tell ya, Thad was mean before, but thar weren't no puttin' up with him
 after he gone and lost his thumb to a woman. He started shootin',
 killin', robbin' and gettin' real nasty. When folks started to call
 him 'Thumbless Thad' he took it real personal and tried to burn down
 the whole damn town."

 "Well, as if things' tweren't bad enough, he even shot the sheriff and
 made us bury him without his boots. Well, that was the last straw and
 folks 'round here just headed out of town. Moved to HerringVille, most
 of 'em. The few folks that did stay to tend the mine and the oil well
 were driven out by the Biscuit Brothers and the like who grew quite
 partial to a town without a sheriff. Soon the whole town just went to
 the ghosts and if 'twerent fer me, I reckon there'd be nothin' left.
 Now without ma place and horse, I be thinkin' I best be wanderin' up

 Suddenly, a rather soiled if not rotting individual comes up from
 behind and grabs you by the ear. He pulls hard, dragging you through
 town, and lectures,

 "Dadgummit anyhow! You folks think you can come into town and shoot up
 the place, gamble til dawn, and swear any damn where ya please. Just
 cause I'm dead don't mean there ain't no law in this town."

 The bootless man loses about half a dozen heavily yellowed teeth
 during this brief oration as well as two fingers off of his left hand.
 A large red worm crawls out of his right ear, meanders down his
 shriveled neck and nestles in the tattered clothing around his
 tarnished badge.

 "Ya just can't trust folks anymore to follow the laws. Hell, just
 because yer six feet under, folks don't have no respect fer ya."

 The stench of the little man becomes almost overwhelming as he finally
 approaches his destination. He unlocks the jail door and flings you
 into the cell.

 "Now, you be mindin' yerself or I'll be stringin' ya to a tree!"

 The sheriff strolls off in the direction of Boot Hill, losing part of
 his nose in the process.

 Jail
 This small jail was not designed for the comfort of its occupants. It
 is impossible to stand without hunching over and you can touch any two

 One of the floorboards squeaks when you step on it.

 On the shelves are a stack of gum base and a box (in which is a dozen
 or so sugar cubes).

>go south

 West Main Street
 Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and
 are but piles of broken lumber, tarpaper and other debris. One
 structure, to the north, seems to have fared considerably better than
 its neighbor to the south. The street narrows to the west where it
 appears to pick up a trail leading out of town. Back to the east is
 the center of town.

>go east

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick
 with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water
 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

>go north

 Bank
 Abandoned teller windows line the west wall of this former financial
 hub of the Deadeye community. Not unlike everything else in town, it
 too has fallen into disrepair. To the north you can make out an open
 vault and to the south lies Main Street.

 There is a hole in one of the floorboards.

>put rod in hole
 You can't see any such thing.

 The hole is too small for that.

 The hole was obviously formed when one of the knots in the floorboard

 Deadeye Gulch
 You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town.
 Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that
 this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures
 are to the west while a large barn-like building is due north. There
 is a faded sign just off to the side of the trail.

 mountains abut the hill to the north while endless badlands reach out
 seemingly forever to the west. The main trail continues around the
 hill to the west and down to the southwest, whereas a faint side trail
 heads towards the crest to the north.

 "I'm too old for this nonsense" is your first thought after a brief

 Burned Down Shack
 Wisps of steam rise off of the charred timbers of what was once a
 fair-sized building. Small flames flare up occasionally producing a
 deep crackling sound. Paper-thin pieces of ash float hither and yon.
 An odd-shaped sign lies on the ground.

 George is here staring at the charred remains of his gum factory.

 There is a brass key hanging on George's belt.

 You can also see a burned sketch here.

 Top of Crow Hill
 The whole valley is revealed to you as you approach the summit. To the
 east, you see the largely decaying town of Deadeye Gulch, and just
 further, the small knoll known as Boot Hill. To the south, the dusty
 valley floor unfolds, divided by a small tree-lined creek. Large snowy
 mountains abut the hill to the north while endless badlands reach out
 seemingly forever to the west. The main trail continues around the
 hill to the west and down to the southwest, whereas a faint side trail
 heads towards the crest to the north.

>go southwest

 Bottom of Crow Hill
 A rather tall hill sprouts out of the landscape here, casting a deep
 shadow to the east. A well-traveled path leads up the hill to the

 Unattended Trees
 The east-west trail here is lined by scraggly sycamore trees that look
 more dead than alive. Even the few birds' nests tucked away in the
 upper branches look poorly constructed and uninhabitable.

 West Main Street
 Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and
 are but piles of broken lumber, tarpaper and other debris. One
 structure, to the north, seems to have fared considerably better than
 its neighbor to the south. The street narrows to the west where it
 appears to pick up a trail leading out of town. Back to the east is
 the center of town.

>go east

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick

 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

 Deadeye Gulch
 You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town.
 Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that

 The main part of town seems to be to the west and the trail out of
 town is to the south. There is a barn-like structure to the north.

>go south

 Dusty Road
 The trail here turns to fine dust with only a trace of vegetation. The
 wind is howling from the west, blowing dust, sand, and tumbleweeds
 everywhere. A brief respite in the blowing debris allows you to see
 the trail continuing north and an overgrown path going up to the east.

>go south

 Track Crossing
 A set of well-worn railroad tracks crosses the north-south trail here.

 There is a rusted old handcar on the track spur.

>go south

 Blind Canyon
 The trail winds its way from the southwest through a shadowy canyon

 Beaver Dam
 A small stream flowing from the west is only slightly hampered here by
 a deteriorating beaver dam which has formed a large deep pool of
 crystal clear water. Chokecherry bushes line the perimeter of the pool
 confining access to the pool to the area in which you are standing.
 The air is thick with mosquitos and gnats.

 There is a flat-faced rock here, protruding just above the surface of
 the pool.

 On the chokecherry bushes is a small bunch of berries.

 General Store
 The musty smell of rotting wood greets your arrival at this rather
 dark dry goods store. An empty wood and glass counter parallel to the
 east wall displays mere remnants of the grains, sugar, fruit, and
 candy once plentiful in each of the adjacent bins. The shelves behind
 the counter are now only a repository for dust and a framework for
 countless cobwebs. The wooden floorboards, once sanded and polished,
 are now buckled and decrepit. A pair of broken doors leads out to the
 south and an open screen door leads to the west.

 One of the floorboards squeaks when you step on it.

 On the shelves are a stack of gum base and a box (in which is a dozen

 east, you see the largely decaying town of Deadeye Gulch, and just
 further, the small knoll known as Boot Hill. To the south, the dusty
 valley floor unfolds, divided by a small tree-lined creek. Large snowy
 mountains abut the hill to the north while endless badlands reach out
 seemingly forever to the west. The main trail continues around the
 hill to the west and down to the southwest, whereas a faint side trail
 heads towards the crest to the north.

>go southwest

 Bottom of Crow Hill
 A rather tall hill sprouts out of the landscape here, casting a deep
 shadow to the east. A well-traveled path leads up the hill to the
 northeast and a grassy trail leads off to the southeast. There is a
 sign lying in the dirt.

>se

 Fork in the Road
 The trail continues east-west here, but two side trails duck away up
 to the northwest and down to the southwest somewhat forming a fork.

>go east

 Unattended Trees
 The east-west trail here is lined by scraggly sycamore trees that look
 more dead than alive. Even the few birds' nests tucked away in the
 upper branches look poorly constructed and uninhabitable.

>go east

 West Main Street
 Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and
 are but piles of broken lumber, tarpaper and other debris. One
 structure, to the north, seems to have fared considerably better than
 its neighbor to the south. The street narrows to the west where it
 appears to pick up a trail leading out of town. Back to the east is
 the center of town.

>go east

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick
 with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water
 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

>go east

 Deadeye Gulch
 You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town.
 Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that
 this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures
 are to the west while a large barn-like building is due north. There
 is a faded sign just off to the side of the trail.

>go east
 The main part of town seems to be to the west and the trail out of
 town is to the south. There is a barn-like structure to the north.

>go south

 Dusty Road
 The trail here turns to fine dust with only a trace of vegetation. The
 wind is howling from the west, blowing dust, sand, and tumbleweeds
 everywhere. A brief respite in the blowing debris allows you to see
 the trail continuing north and an overgrown path going up to the east.

>go south

 Track Crossing
 A set of well-worn railroad tracks crosses the north-south trail here.
 The wooden ties have all but disintegrated and the rails are thick
 with bright red rust. The weed ridden-tracks run east-west.

 There is a rusted old handcar on the track spur.

>go south

 Blind Canyon
 The trail winds its way from the southwest through a shadowy canyon
 formed in the cleft of two large hills. You cannot help but feel
 confined and vulnerable by the sheer walls of this gorge and limited
 visibility in front of you and behind. The trail continues to the
 north.

>go southwest

 Trail
 This northeast-southwest trail has all the appearances of being a main
 thoroughfare prior to becoming overrun with weeds and brush. A narrow
 footpath leads off to the east through the brush.

>go east

 Shady Path
 A well-traveled path from the west branches south and continues east
 here under the refreshing shade of the bordering oaks. The sloping
 path leading south appears somewhat muddy but the footing does not
 appear to be too difficult.

 Beaver Dam
 A small stream flowing from the west is only slightly hampered here by
 a deteriorating beaver dam which has formed a large deep pool of
 crystal clear water. Chokecherry bushes line the perimeter of the pool
 confining access to the pool to the area in which you are standing.
 The air is thick with mosquitos and gnats.

 There is a flat-faced rock here, protruding just above the surface of
 the pool.

 The mosquitos and gnats don't want anything to do with that smelly
 stuff you're wearing.

 Track Crossing
 A set of well-worn railroad tracks crosses the north-south trail here.
 The wooden ties have all but disintegrated and the rails are thick
 with bright red rust. The weed ridden-tracks run east-west.

 There is a rusted old handcar on the track spur.

>get on handcar

 Broken Track (in the handcar)
 The heat is stifling at this barren strip of track seemingly in the
 middle of nowhere. Even the ever present weeds have given up this area
 as hopeless and only a few cacti have managed to gain a foothold in
 the constantly shifting sand. The tracks here look to be in good shape
 despite the shifting sand.

>push handle

 Narrow Ravine (in the handcar)

 Outside Mine Entrance
 The north-south path widens at the base of a steep rocky hill where an

 entrance carved into the hill. The entrance has been boarded over with
 thick timber and bears the notice "KEEP OUT" in crudely painted red
 letters. There is sign at the top of the entrance.

 An ore car rests on the tracks at the top of the knoll. The car is
 tied by rope to a timber header at the end of the tracks.

 The knife easily cuts through the rope, releasing the ore car. The ore
 car starts slowly and gradually increases its  pace towards the
 entrance. After twenty feet of travel the car is moving at a fair
 clip; after forty, the wheels start to scream.

 The ore car slams into the entrance like a blur. The timbers barring
 the entrance yield instantly at the impact as the car continues its
 journey into the mine shaft and out of sight.

 Mine Shaft
 You are in a dark mine shaft. The tracks coming from the entrance to

 Outside Mine Entrance
 The north-south path widens at the base of a steep rocky hill where an
 apparently large mining operation once stood. Another trail heads off
 to the east. Narrow gauge tracks come down a small knoll down to the
 wide entrance carved into the hill. A mass of broken timbers surround
 the base of the foreboding entrance to the west. There is a sign at
 the top of the entrance.

 Fork in the Road
 The trail continues east-west here, but two side trails duck away up
 to the northwest and down to the southwest somewhat forming a fork.

 Unattended Trees
 The east-west trail here is lined by scraggly sycamore trees that look
 more dead than alive. Even the few birds' nests tucked away in the
 upper branches look poorly constructed and uninhabitable.

 West Main Street
 Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and
 are but piles of broken lumber, tarpaper and other debris. One
 structure, to the north, seems to have fared considerably better than
 its neighbor to the south. The street narrows to the west where it
 appears to pick up a trail leading out of town. Back to the east is
 the center of town.

>go east

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick
 with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water
 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

>go east

 Deadeye Gulch
 You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town.
 Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that
 this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures
 are to the west while a large barn-like building is due north. There
 is a faded sign just off to the side of the trail.

 Dusty Road
 The trail here turns to fine dust with only a trace of vegetation. The

 the trail continuing north and an overgrown path going up to the east.

>go south

 Track Crossing
 A set of well-worn railroad tracks crosses the north-south trail here.
 The wooden ties have all but disintegrated and the rails are thick

 Boot Hill
 You are standing atop a large knoll which apparently served as a
 cemetery at some point in time. Remains of a picket fence lie strewn
 about the hillside and most of the gravestones have disintegrated
 beyond recognition. One granite marker at the head of a grassless
 plot, however, remains intact.

 There is a Tombstone Jay here standing on top of the grave marker.

>take accordion
 Taken.

>play it
 Just as you are about to play, the Tombstone Jay takes to flight and
 strips the accordion from your grasp. The huge bird flies due east
 with his quarry until he is out of sight. In a few moments, the bird
 returns with empty talons and settles back on the grave marker.

 You can see an accordion here.

>go up

 Just Off the Ground, On the Derrick
 You are standing on a slat on the south face of the derrick just a few
 feet off the ground. Inscribed in one of the support beams just off to
 your left is the following:

 "I go around in circles,
 But always straight ahead
 Never complain,
 No matter where I am led.
 What am I?"

>go up
 The structure seems to have stiffened up a bit, permitting further
 exploration.

 About Half Way Up, On the Derrick
 You are standing on a slat on the south face of the derrick halfway
 between the top and the base. Scrawled on one of the cross members is
 the following:

 "My life can be measured in hours,
 I serve by being devoured.
 Thin, I am quick
 Fat, I am slow
 Wind is my foe.
 What am I?"

 You can see a nail here.

>go up
 The structure seems to have stiffened up a bit, permitting further

 Almost to the Top, On the Derrick
 You are just a few feet from the top of the derrick. One of the
 adjacent slats has the following painted on it:

 Yellow and Clear;
 I'm often found
 Amongst the Gears.

 And in the Ground,
 I can ease a
 Grating Sound.

 Platform, On the Derrick
 You are on a narrow platform at the very top of the oil derrick. The
 platform is spotted with a number of bird droppings. The view from
 here is mostly obstructed by trees, but you can make out the hill with
 the mine to the west.

 High overhead, a Tombstone Jay circles the derrick with a bright
 yellow object grasped in its talons.

 The huge bird is flying much too high to discern any detail.

 The Tombstone Jay immediately breaks out of its circling pattern and
 goes into a dive straight at you! At the last moment before collision,
 the crazy bird releases the yellow object and breaks out of the dive.
 The yellow object is true to its mark and smashes into the accordion,
 destroying the instrument on the spot. As the bird flies away to the
 north, it is apparent that the Tombstone Jay is overly critical of
 accordion music.

 Burned Down Shack
 Wisps of steam rise off of the charred timbers of what was once a

 Outside Mine Entrance
 The north-south path widens at the base of a steep rocky hill where an
 apparently large mining operation once stood. Another trail heads off
 to the east. Narrow gauge tracks come down a small knoll down to the
 wide entrance carved into the hill. A mass of broken timbers surround
 the base of the foreboding entrance to the west. There is a sign at
 the top of the entrance.

 the old squeezebox is not much more than a piece of junk.

>go north

 Cactus Patch
 The path here follows the bottom of a deep ravine, but more notably,
 is thickly covered with long-needle cacti. To the south, the path
 widens at the base of a large hill. To the northeast, the path heads
 towards a grove of trees.

>go northeast

 Fork in the Road
 The trail continues east-west here, but two side trails duck away up
 to the northwest and down to the southwest somewhat forming a fork.

 Unattended Trees
 The east-west trail here is lined by scraggly sycamore trees that look
 more dead than alive. Even the few birds' nests tucked away in the
 upper branches look poorly constructed and uninhabitable.

>go east

 West Main Street
 Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and
 are but piles of broken lumber, tarpaper and other debris. One
 structure, to the north, seems to have fared considerably better than
 its neighbor to the south. The street narrows to the west where it
 appears to pick up a trail leading out of town. Back to the east is
 the center of town.

>go east

 East Main Street
 You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick
 with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water
 troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings
 here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they
 were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures,
 however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank
 judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south,
 there is a saloon.

 Deadeye Gulch
 You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town.

 this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures
 are to the west while a large barn-like building is due north. There
 is a faded sign just off to the side of the trail.

>go south

 Dusty Road
 The trail here turns to fine dust with only a trace of vegetation. The
 wind is howling from the west, blowing dust, sand, and tumbleweeds
 everywhere. A brief respite in the blowing debris allows you to see
 the trail continuing north and an overgrown path going up to the east.

>go east

 Boot Hill
 You are standing atop a large knoll which apparently served as a
 cemetery at some point in time. Remains of a picket fence lie strewn
 about the hillside and most of the gravestones have disintegrated
 beyond recognition. One granite marker at the head of a grassless
 plot, however, remains intact.

 There is a Tombstone Jay here standing on top of the grave marker.

>play accordion
 Just as you are about to play, the Tombstone Jay takes to flight and
 strips the accordion from your grasp. The huge bird flies due east
 with his quarry until he is out of sight. In a few moments, the bird
 returns with empty talons and settles back on the grave marker.

>play it
 The old accordion honks, wheezes and spews out clouds of dust. Somehow
 though, through the melee, a couple of tones do manage to escape.

 The Tombstone Jay immediately breaks out of its circling pattern and
 goes into a dive straight at you! At the last moment before collision,
 the crazy bird releases the yellow object and breaks out of the dive.
 The yellow object is true to its mark and smashes into the accordion,
 destroying the instrument on the spot. As the bird flies away to the
 north, it is apparent that the Tombstone Jay is overly critical of
 accordion music.

 As soon as the small rock leaves your hand, it pauses in midair as if
 sensing its target. The rock slowly maneuvers from side to side and
 then propels itself in a flash toward its intended target.

 The rock hits the dynamite on the mark causing a sizable explosion,
 sending rocks hither and yon. Through the settling dust you can make
 out a tunnel leading into the stone wall.

 A rather dusty and perturbed bear wanders out of the tunnel, sits
 down, and rubs his ears.

 The bear pulls out a copy of Reader's Digest and looks around for some
 woods.

 Under a curtain of invisibility, you gingerly sneak past the brown
 bear. The bear startles and angrily smells the air but doesn't strike.

 You wander into the tunnel to find a light at the other end through
 some brambles and thicket. Progressing through the thicket, you find
 yourself in bright sunshine, but perhaps a little lighter for the
 effort. Also, your brown friend seems to have followed you.
 Dry Streambed
 Water hasn't found its way down this rocky streambed for years by the
 looks of all the weeds and wildflowers growing between the rocks. A
 grove of gatewood trees with thick underbrush prevents any further
 progress west. There is a tunnel to the east with thick bramble at the
 entrance, and the path heading north along the streambed.

 Outside Old Shack
 The streambed turn east here and vanishes into the thick bushes and

 There is a horse here tied to the hitching post.

 On the horse are a blanket and a pair of saddlebags (which is closed).

 The horse is solid brown with a white marking on his forehead and has
 a considerable sway in his back. From the looks of it, the horse is
 long overdue for a little care or a quick trip to the glue factory.

 Biscuit Residence
 The "Biscuit Residence" would hardly constitute a walk-in closet by

 the charming decor of splintered wood, dense cobwebs, and the
 occasional trail of mouse droppings. There is a small wood stove
 nestled in one of the corners, whereas in the opposite corner is a
 couple of bedrolls, saddles and other supplies. There are a table and
 a couple of chairs in the center of the room. In front of the stove,
 you can just make out a good-sized rectangular cutout in the wood
 floor.

 Sitting at the table are two rugged-looking gnomish cowboys playing
 cards.
 The Biscuit Brothers don't take kindly to visitors and, in the blink
 of an eye, have you strung up to the nearest tree.

 weeds. To the west is an old run-down shack which looks several years
 past its prime. There is a hitching post just outside the door.

 There is a horse here tied to the hitching post.

 Biscuit Residence
 The "Biscuit Residence" would hardly constitute a walk-in closet by
 your standards, but what it lacks in size is more than made up for by
 the charming decor of splintered wood, dense cobwebs, and the
 occasional trail of mouse droppings. There is a small wood stove
 nestled in one of the corners, whereas in the opposite corner is a
 couple of bedrolls, saddles and other supplies. There are a table and
 a couple of chairs in the center of the room. In front of the stove,
 you can just make out a good-sized rectangular cutout in the wood
 floor.

 Sitting at the table are two rugged-looking gnomish cowboys playing
 cards.

 You can also see a green apple and a gold watch here.

 Startled by the apple's take to flight, the Biscuit brothers draw
 their guns and start shooting every which way. Although Frank takes a
 bullet in the leg and James one in the arm, the majority of bullets
 seem to have zeroed right in on you.

>ride horse
 The horse just shakes his head and starts to doze off.

>beetlebaum
 "Beetlebaum!"

>blizzard
 Beetlebaum races off through the brush at breakneck speed, stripping
 you of all your possessions. The landscape flies by as the old horse
 seeks the shelter of George's shack so as not to have to brave the
 oncoming blizzard. Following nearly invisible trails, the horse breaks
 out of the brush onto the main trail. Without hesitation, the horse
 continues north along the trail across Clear Creek and then northeast
 toward Blind Canyon.

 As the horse makes the last turn into the canyon, Beetlebaum startles
 at the sight of something up ahead on the trail. At this point, you
 and the horse go your own separate ways. Beetlebaum falls to the
 ground, quickly regains his footing, and continues his journey north
 to shelter. You, on the other hand, fly through air with the greatest
 of ease until falling face first onto the dusty trail.

 As you get up and take inventory of your faculties, you feel something
 cold against your head and hear the click of a gun's hammer.

 Blind Canyon
 The trail winds its way from the southwest through a shadowy canyon
 formed in the cleft of two large hills. You cannot help but feel
 confined and vulnerable by the sheer walls of this gorge and the
 limited visibility in front of you and behind. The trail continues to
 the north.

 You can see Black Thad McGee here.

 "Well, what do we have here? Huh, little missy? Seems like you and me
 have some unfinished business."

 Thad puts the pistol back into the holster.

>go north

 "Don't be runnin off there missy. I've done shot more than a few in

 "Yuh see now, you kinda spoiled my shootin' with your little tricks.
 Yuh know, it's pretty damn hard for an old guy like me tuh make a
 livin' without a good shootin' hand. But I learned. Yah, I learned to
 use muh other hand. Sure the boys laughed a spell 'bout it, but I done
 showed 'em just like I is goin' to show yuh.

>rub locket
 You can't see any such thing.

>kick thad
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 "Yuh know, I waited quite a spell for this day. Yuh see, no one could
 figure what happened to yuh. But I waited. Yup, I knew we'd cross
 paths again. And here we both be. Me with muh guns, yous with nothin.
 Sounds pretty fair to me!"

>beetlebaum

 "Well, 'nuff of this jawin'. Better say your prayers missy!"

 As soon as you blurt it out, echoes of "Beetlebaum" fill the canyon.

>beetlebaum

 Black Thad pulls out a pistol from his holster.

 The sound of a galloping horse fills the canyon!

>beetlebaum

 Black Thad carefully checks the gun for bullets.








 Black Thad's eyes turn big as saucers as he spots the daunting sight
 of George and Beetlebaum racing down the trail at full gallop.
 Beetlebaum's eyes are filled with rage, his nose flared, and thick
 white foam spews from his mouth. Just as Beetlebaum lowers his head
 for a full charge, George screams out in an earsplitting yell, "HERE
 COMES BEETLEBAUM!"

 Black Thad, out of reflex, goes for his right gun first to shoot the
 charging horse. His thumbless hand fumbles the gun around and then
 drops it to the ground. In an instant, but an instant too late, he
 goes for his other gun with his good hand. Beetlebaum, with his ears
 back, plows into Black Thad like a freight train. Black Thad is
 launched into the air from the collision and slams into the canyon
 wall. What life may have been left in Black Thad is certainly
 concluded by the ensuing rockslide.

 After the dust clears a little, George stares at you for a moment and
 says, "I just knew you'd be the one to clean up around these parts.
 Heck, when I tricked ol' Frank into goin' above to rile yuh up, I
 could just feel it in mah bones. Beetlebaum, get yer miserable hide
 over here!"

 As Beetlebaum saunters over, still wet with sweat, George opens the
 saddlebag and takes out a blue gumball and hands it to you. "Go on,
 get on home! I don't take to no good-byes from no woman." George
 pauses, and then breaks out in a big smile and chortles, "Ah heck, ya
 done good. Hell, ya done great. I's can't thank ya enough fer helpin'
 out. Let's get some grub and get ya on yer way."

 After a pleasant meal of beans and jerky, you say your good-byes to
 the old cowboy. Following a long hug and a quick peck on the cheek,
 you finally partake of the blue gum. Quicker than an instant, you find
 yourself....                      (Press SPACE to Continue)

 surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel
 quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.

 [Your score has just gone up by thirty points.]

>inventory

>examine watch
 The dainty wristwatch is made from 18kt gold and shines like the sun.

>stand
 As you get to your feet, you begin to realize that you must have
 really had a good whack to the head. Dismissing the previous events as
 a bad dream, you continue your routine and get ready to start dinner.

 It isn't until some time later that evening that you discover an odd
 gold locket and a note under your pillow.

 The note reads:
 "Thank you ma'am for all your help on getting things settled around
 Deadeye. With the Biscuit Brothers and Black Thad out of the way,
 people are startin to move back towards town. There's even talk about
 reopenin the mine and maybe drillin some more wells. Beetlebaum is
 feelin spry as a colt, and hell, I may even rebuild the ol Gumball
 Factory.

 Thanks again for yer help and I hope the locket comes in handy from
 time to time.

 (signed) George & Beetlebaum

 George and Beetlebaum were a creation of my father some thirty-five
 years ago. As a petroleum geologist, my dad spent a significant amount
 of time in the field at various drilling sites. He would bring home
 tales of G&B and how they lived down in the "hole." Maybe he spent a
 little too much time out in the field...

 1. The House
 The house depicted is the house we currently live in. As this game was
 originally written for my wife, I wanted her not to get too lost to
 start with. This portion of the game was my experimenting with Inform
 and I decided to leave it in after several revisions. Incidentally, my
 wife has never played the game.

 2. Gold Watch
 The gold watch was a Christmas present I gave my wife. Since she was
 the protagonist in the experimental version, it was the only
 motivation I could contrive at the time.

 3. Deadeye Gulch
 The buildings and so forth in Deadeye Gulch are a combination of my
 recollections of Deadwood, South Dakota and Virginia City, Montana.
 The rosewood bar in the Saloon is based on the "Silver Dollar" in
 Miles City, Montana.

 4. Chokecherry Bushes
 Chokecherry bushes are a staple of the Montana landscape. The small
 black berries are somewhat tart and are especially good when canned.

 5. Willow Tree
 The willow tree in the story was based on a willow tree across the
 street from where I grew up. The tree was in Fred Dorn's yard at the
 time, and was recently cut down since it was dying from old age.

 6. Trystanium & Tombstone Jay
 Trystanium is named after and based on my nephew Tristan. The
 Tombstone Jay is named after my nephew TJ. Both are great kids who
 helped test the game along with their dad, who is "John Bro" in the
 story.

 7. Gold Nugget
 The gold panning bit was based on my brother's attempt to make his
 fortune when we were on vacation in Deadwood years ago. For the
 record, he did manage to find a few flakes.

 8. Slot Machine
 The slot machine puzzle is based on a 5th grade homework problem
 provided by one of my co-workers. We spent a lot of time fooling
 around with this puzzle at the office.

 9. Tombstone
 The tombstone at Boot Hill is based on a tombstone found on a small
 island at Canyon Ferry, Montana.

 10. Clear Creek
 Clear Creek is a little stream that runs across my uncle's farm in
 Montana. In addition to many other adventures, this is where I had my
 first introduction to a rattlesnake.

 This game was for me the ultimate adventure in just trying to put it
 together and complete it. It took the better part of 18 months to
 write. Having really no programming experience of this nature, even
 the simplest things seemed to take forever. The feedback I have
 received on the game has been well beyond anything I could have
 imagined. I would like to thank each of you folks who took a moment
 and dropped me a note. It made the whole project worthwhile.

 As a long-time fan of interactive fiction, it was a discovery of a
 lifetime to find the tools and documentation to even attempt this
 story. Accordingly, I would like to give special thanks to Graham
 Nelson for his incredible work. I cannot comprehend the amount of time
 and commitment it took to develop Inform.

 Next on the list, no game would be complete without recognizing the
 pioneering work of Willie Crowther and Don Woods. The original
 Adventure was nothing short of amazing to me when I played it on a
 XEROX Sigma 7 about 20 years ago. I didn't finish the game until the
 early 80's on my C64. What a thrill!

 Of course, the folks at Infocom really cut the cake for me. The thrill
 of getting a disk drive for my C64 and Zork I on the same day was
 nothing short of orgasmic. Getting so much entertainment into 80k of
 memory is truly one of the major accomplishments of the computer age.
 My favorite game to this day is Enchanter.

 And speaking of thrills, the day I found the interactive community out
 on the Net was nothing short of a religious experience. So many good
 folks with a common interest. I thank you all for keeping the art
 alive.

 Last of all, I'd like to thank my brother. He introduced me to
 Adventure and we played pretty much most of the I-F games together,
 although geographically never in the same place. And, accordingly,
 this game is dedicated to him.

 And speaking of dedication, my heart goes out to all of you folks who
 play I-F. If you were patient enough to complete the game, please let
 me know at the e-mail address listed when you type 'HELP' in the game.
 Thank you so much, and God bless.

 And finally, long live George and Beetlebaum!
