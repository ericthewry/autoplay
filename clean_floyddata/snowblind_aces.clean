                           THE QUEEN OF SWORDS


                     [Please press SPACE to begin.]








 Each week, you spend four hours round-trip in a car to take a
 beginner's fencing class at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in
 Springfield. It's fun, you tell yourself, and it never hurts to be more
 active. David, on the other hand, wants to compete. Your husband wants
 to join the U.S. Fencing Association and begin competing in regional
 tournaments after only eight weeks of classes, when they tell people to
 take lessons for a whole year before competing. However, David will
 want what David will want, and you love your husband dearly, so...

 There's a tournament in Glen Falls this weekend, and you're going. On
 your last trip to VAF you spent over $900 on electric fencing
 equipment. The real problem is going to figure out how to use all of
 it: what plugs into where, which piece you need to put on first, and
 how to fence with a floor cord holding you back. That's why you and
 David are going to use tonight, while you have the room at the local
 library reserved, to practice gearing up for electric.

 David gets a good parking spot downtown, and the two of you haul the
 bags of equipment out of the trunk and into the library. The librarians
 wave at you as you pass, already used to seeing you, and the two of you
 make your way to one of the larger meeting rooms upstairs to set up the
 electric strip.

 David drops his equipment bag near the door and smiles at you. "I'll
 put the strip up," he says. "Why don't you go ahead and get your stuff
 on?" You look at your bag uncertainly. "I'm not sure I know where
 everything goes," you say. He grins. "Me neither," he says. "If you
 have trouble, let me know, and I'll try to help." He takes the bag with
 the scoring box and floor reels and goes to set up a table. You survey
 the room.

 McIntire Meeting Room, Downtown Library
 A large, open room, with plenty of room for a few fencers to practice.
 Of course, tonight it's just you and David. A row of tall windows line
 the western wall, and stacks of chairs are at either end of the long
 north-south room. The door to the hallway is east. An industrial-type
 carpet in garish red covers the floor.

 The open windows let in a welcome breeze.

>about
 "The Queen of Swords" was written as an entry in the Event Division of
 the 2003 Interactive Fiction Art Show, organized by Marnie Parker. For
 more information about fencing, and some general tips on exploring this
 work, players may wish to type HELP. Experienced IF players will find
 it sufficient to note that examining objects may be important; that
 David is a source of help; and that the verb ATTACH can be quite
 useful. The most important fencing verb is, well, FENCE. The work tries
 to convey a close approximation of the preparation for fencing with
 electric gear, fiddly bits and all.

 Finally, thanks to Andrew Plotkin for his answers on raif and advice on
 his website. Oh, one final note: the game refers to a "lam?," but for
 simplicity's sake, you may type "lame." (It's still pronounced
 luh-MAY!)

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a fencing bag (which is closed)

 David pushes the table against the eastern wall.

>open bag
 The bag is bulky enough to get in your way when you try.

 David notices your conflict, and says, "You could just put the bag
 down, love. It'll be fine right there."

 He sets the bag of scoring equipment on the table and opens it.

>examine me
 You look just as you always have.

 You are carrying:
   a fencing bag (which is closed)

 David is rummaging in the bag.

>put bag on table
 You put the fencing bag on the table.

 David takes a floor reel and floor cord from the bag.

>open bag
 You open the fencing bag, revealing a mask, a jacket, a body cord, an
 electric foil, a lam?, a glove, a plastron and a chest protector.

 He walks to the north end of the room and sets down the floor reel.

>examine david
 Your husband is a tall man in his mid-thirties, with clear gray eyes
 and a wonderfully misshapen nose. His smile lights up your day, and he
 doesn't smile much except at you: but he smiles a lot at you.

 David plugs the floor cord into the floor reel.

>examine david
 Your husband is a tall man in his mid-thirties, with clear gray eyes
 and a wonderfully misshapen nose. His smile lights up your day, and he
 doesn't smile much except at you: but he smiles a lot at you.

 David walks back to the center of the room and looks in the bag on the
 table.

>punch nose
 You can't see any such thing.

>hit david with foil
 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit David.

>hit david
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 David pulls the scoring box out of the bag and sets it on the table.

>wield foil
 That's not a verb you need today.

>examine lame
 The lam? (pronounced "luh-MAY") is like a sleeveless, metal vest, used
 in electric foil fencing to define your target area--literally, since
 the opponent's blade must strike you on the lam? to complete the
 correct circuit. It The lam? is made to cover your torso from neck to
 waistline, with an additional section in front best described by
 drawing a line from your hips to your pelvis. Yours is an Uhlmann lam?,
 quite high quality, although it cost a good deal. There is a small,
 metal D-ring (shaped like the letter D) sewn into the back of the lam?.

 He plugs the free end of the first floor cord into the scoring box.

>examine me
 You look just as you always have.

 You are carrying nothing.

 David takes the other floor cord out of the bag and plugs one end into
 the box.

>the lam? is lame
 That's not a verb you need today.

>examine d-ring
 The D-ring is sewn onto the back of your lam?. Its purpose is solely to
 give the hook from the floor reel something to latch onto, to give the
 three-prong connection a bit of slack and make your life easier.

 David takes the other reel from the bag.

>examine box
 A handy little device: this is the thing that makes it all work. The
 scoring box lights up whenever a fencer (properly plugged in, of
 course) scores a touch, and lets you know whether it was on-target (on
 the lam?) or off-target (anywhere else) by lighting up either the
 fencer's colored light (on) or white light (off). You're fencing on the
 right side, so the green light is yours, and the red light is David's.

 He walks down to the south end of the room, and winks at you.

>get box
 There's no reason to do anything besides look at the lights.

 Setting the floor reel on the carpet, David plugs the free end of the
 floor cord into it.

>examine lights
 A handy little device: this is the thing that makes it all work. The
 scoring box lights up whenever a fencer (properly plugged in, of
 course) scores a touch, and lets you know whether it was on-target (on
 the lam?) or off-target (anywhere else) by lighting up either the
 fencer's colored light (on) or white light (off). You're fencing on the
 right side, so the green light is yours, and the red light is David's.

 David turns to survey his work.

>pause
 That's not a verb you need today.

>examine reel
 The floor reel is made to connect you to the floor cord. It's supposed
 to sit at the end of the strip, and the floor cord plugs into it. The
 hook that comes out the front attaches to the fencer's body cord, and
 when released it retracts like a self-retracting tape measure. Your
 floor reels are Uhlmann made, with dark blue plastic casing and rubber
 feet to keep them in place.

 "Oops," David says, "I forgot to plug in the box."

>pull floor cord to floor reel
 I only understood you as far as wanting to pull the floor cord.

>plug floor cord to floor reel
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>plug floor cord into floor reel
 David will plug in all of the floor cords. Just worry about your own
 stuff for now.

 He walks back to the table in the center of the east wall.

>look in bag
 In the fencing bag are a mask, a jacket, a body cord, an electric foil,
 a lam?, a glove, a plastron and a chest protector.

 David peers in the bag and gets out the AC adapter for the scoring box.

>plug reel into body cord
 You're not suited up enough to plug in yet.

 David plugs the adapter into the box.

>examine chest protector
 The chest protector is hard plastic, molded to fit your body. Females
 are required to wear them at USFA competitions, and you're just as
 glad, since it really cuts down on the bruises. The elastic bands hook
 behind your back like a bra.

 He plugs the free end of the adapter into the electrical outlet in the
 wall.

>examine plastron
 The plastron is a thin, white, half-shirt, designed to protect the
 underarm of your weapon arm from an errant hit. It has elastic bands to
 secure it in place, and it is supposed to go on under everything else.

 "There!" David says, looking over the electric strip in satisfaction.
 He turns to you. "Now, let's get suited up and then we can fence!"

>get chest protector
 Taken.

 David looks you over. "Looks like you don't quite have all your stuff.
 Check in your bag--if you need help with something, show it to me."

>wear it
 You start to pull the chest protector on, but the unfamiliar cold
 plastic stops you. Ah yes, you're supposed to have the plastron on
 underneath!

 Meanwhile, David gets his gear on amazingly fast. He says, "We'll
 salute as soon as we're both ready."

>get plastron
 Taken.

 David connects to the far floor reel. "I'm about ready," he says.

>wear it
 You put on the plastron.

>wear chest
 You put on the chest protector.

>examine jacket
 Your jacket covers your torso and arms while you fence. They are
 required to be white, and yours zips up the front (making it much
 easier to put on by yourself). Although the FIE requires 800 Newton
 resistance, you are merely fencing in the USFA, which has much more lax
 requirements than its European counterpart, so yours is only rated at
 350 Newtons.

>get glove
 Taken.

>examine it
 White, with leather on the palm for a better grip.

>wear it
 You put on the glove.

>wear jacket
 (first taking the jacket)
 You must unzip the jacket before you can put it on.

>unzip it
 You fumble with the zipper, but the glove is too thick to allow you to
 get a good grasp.

>remove glove
 You take off the glove.

>unzip jacket
 You unzip the jacket.

>wear jacket
 You slide the clean, white jacket on and tug it into place.

>zip jacket
 You zip up the jacket, tugging the zipper up to make sure it's all the
 way up.

 Your fencing bag is a calming maroon color. It's long enough to hold a
 foil, and deep enough to hold your mask, clothes, and all the other
 cords and things you need for fencing.

>wear glove
 You put on the glove.

>search baf

 David will plug in all of the floor cords. Just worry about your own

>wear lame
 (first taking the lam?)
 The mask blocking your peripheral vision makes your task difficult. You
 seem to remember it's the very last piece of equipment to go on, just
 before you begin a bout.

>remove mask. wear lame
 You take off the mask.
 You must unzip the lam? before you can put it on.

>remove glove

 You struggle to get your jacketed arms through the small openings in
 the lam?. Finally, you get it on.

>wear gloves
 You can't see any such thing.

>wear glove
 You put on the glove.

>search bag
 In the fencing bag are a body cord and an electric foil.

>get body cord
 Taken.

>examine it
 Your body cord is used in electric fencing to connect several different
 circuits of electricity. On one end, the two-prong connector attaches
 to your electric foil. The other end has an alligator clip, to hook to
 your lam?, and a three-prong connector, to plug into the floor reel. In
 between is about five feet of insulated wiring, which is supposed to
 run up your sleeve and down your back.

>attach it to lame
 That's not supposed to attach directly to the lam?. You may wish to
 attach it to the D-ring, or it may not be necessary at all.

>put connector in sleeve
 Which do you mean, the two-prong connector or the three-prong

 McIntire Meeting Room, Downtown Library
 A large, open room, with plenty of room for a few fencers to practice.
 Of course, tonight it's just you and David. A row of tall windows line
 the western wall, and stacks of chairs are at either end of the long
 north-south room. The door to the hallway is east. An industrial-type
 carpet in garish red covers the floor.

 On the table are a scoring box, a bag of scoring equipment (which is
 empty) and a fencing bag (which is empty).

 The open windows let in a welcome breeze.

 You can also see an AC adapter, a floor cord and a floor reel here.

>examine foil
 You've brought your best electric foil along for today's lesson. The
 blade is 36 inches long, and the whole thing weighs just under 500
 grams. Your bell guard is still nice and shiny, thanks to a lack of
 use. The grip is a pistol grip of the Visconti style, painted blue so
 you can tell it apart from David's. There's also a two-prong receptacle
 for your body cord to plug into.

>plug body cord in receptacle
 You can't see any such thing.

>plug two-prong in foil
 You attach the two-prong connector, which pokes out through your sleeve
 next to your glove, to the foil. It clicks into place.

>plug three-prong
 What do you want to plug the three-prong connector in?

>scoring
 Which do you mean, the scoring box or the bag of scoring equipment?

>box
 You would achieve nothing by this.

>examine box
 A handy little device: this is the thing that makes it all work. The
 scoring box lights up whenever a fencer (properly plugged in, of
 course) scores a touch, and lets you know whether it was on-target (on
 the lam?) or off-target (anywhere else) by lighting up either the
 fencer's colored light (on) or white light (off). You're fencing on the
 right side, so the green light is yours, and the red light is David's.

>examine reel
 The floor reel is made to connect you to the floor cord. It's supposed
 to sit at the end of the strip, and the floor cord plugs into it. The
 hook that comes out the front attaches to the fencer's body cord, and
 when released it retracts like a self-retracting tape measure. Your
 floor reels are Uhlmann made, with dark blue plastic casing and rubber
 feet to keep them in place.

>examine strip
 The "strip" is the area that fencers actually fence on. In your
 tournament on Saturday, the strips will be drawn out on the floor in
 paint or tape: one meter wide by fourteen meters long, with warning
 lines and en guarde lines and everything. Here, you and David just make
 your best guess as to where the lines are. But today, you have a real
 strip set up in some respects: the table in the middle of the eastern
 wall holds the scoring box, which is connect via the floor cords to a
 floor reel, one at either end of the strip. That's all it takes for you
 and David to plug in and have a real electric bout.

>plug three-prong to reel
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>plug three-prong into reel
 You connect the three-prong end of the body cord with the hook out of
 the floor reel. Getting close to fencing time!

>salute
 Fencers don't salute until they are completely plugged in and ready to
 fence.

 That's not a verb you need today.

 You've brought your best electric foil along for today's lesson. The
 blade is 36 inches long, and the whole thing weighs just under 500
 grams. Your bell guard is still nice and shiny, thanks to a lack of
 use. The grip is a pistol grip of the Visconti style, painted blue so
 you can tell it apart from David's. There's also a two-prong receptacle
 for your body cord to plug into.

>show it to david
 David looks your foil over. "Looks like it's in working condition," he
 says. "Just hang on to it until we're ready to fence. You'll need it
 for the salute!" His eyes twinkle at you.

>examine glove
 White, with leather on the palm for a better grip.

>show it to david
 "Not much I can do to help with that," David says. "You'll just have to
 put it on."

>wear foil
 You can't wear that!

>wear glove
 You're already wearing that!

>wear mask
 You put on the mask.

>examine jacket
 Your jacket covers your torso and arms while you fence. They are
 required to be white, and yours zips up the front (making it much
 easier to put on by yourself). Although the FIE requires 800 Newton
 resistance, you are merely fencing in the USFA, which has much more lax
 requirements than its European counterpart, so yours is only rated at
 350 Newtons.

>show jacket to david
 David takes the jacket from you and holds it so you can slip your arms
 in easier. "Here," he says.

 "Oh, wait a sec," David says. "Let me unzip it first." He tugs the
 zipper down and opens the jacket. "Okay, go ahead."

 The mask blocking your peripheral vision makes your task difficult. You
 seem to remember it's the very last piece of equipment to go on, just
 before you begin a bout.

>examine body cord
 Your body cord is used in electric fencing to connect several different
 circuits of electricity. On one end, the two-prong connector attaches
 to your electric foil. The other end has an alligator clip, to hook to
 your lam?, and a three-prong connector, to plug into the floor reel. In
 between is about five feet of insulated wiring, which is supposed to
 run up your sleeve and down your back.

>plug in body cord
 You can't see any such thing.

>put body cord in jacket
 That would be far too difficult for you to try while you're wearing the
 jacket. You're just not that coordinated yet.

>remove jacket
 You'll have to take off the lam? first.

>examine two=prong
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine two-prong
 The two-prong end attaches to your electric foil. The blue plastic
 casing is marked with a stylized "U" for "Uhlmann," the company in
 Germany that made it.

>attach alligator clip to lame
 You attach the alligator clip directly to the metal vest, remembering
 to put it on the weapon arm side of your body as the rules require.

>plug two-prong into foil
 You attach the two-prong connector, which pokes out through your sleeve
 next to your glove, to the foil. It clicks into place.

>salute
 Fencers don't salute until they are completely plugged in and ready to
 fence.

>doff glove then unzip lame then doff lame then unzip jacket then doff jacket
 You take off the glove.
 You unzip the lam?.
 Taking off the lam? is almost as much of a struggle as putting it on,
 but somehow you manage.

 You get the thing off, eventually.
 That's already open.
 You pull your arms out of the slightly sweaty sleeves. It takes a bit
 of flapping, but you manage to get out of the jacket.

>put body cord in jacket
 You slide the two-prong end of the body cord into the jacket sleeve.

>show jacket to david
 David takes the jacket from you and holds it so you can slip your arms
 in easier. "Here," he says.

 You pull the jacket on, trying to keep the dangling bits of the body
 cord out of the way. What a pain!

>wear jacket then zip jacket then wear lame then zip lame
 You're already wearing that!
 You zip up the jacket, tugging the zipper up to make sure it's all the
 way up.
 You struggle to get your jacketed arms through the small openings in
 the lam?. Finally, you get it on.
 You zip up the lam?, and adjust the Velcro at the collar to make sure
 you have a proper fit.

 First things first: you NEVER salute with a mask on. It's considered
 very rude.

>remove mask
 You take off the mask.

>remove glove then open mask
 You take off the glove.
 That's not something you can open.

>show lame to david
 "Oh, these things are a pain," David says. David unzips the lam? on the
 sly, so as not to draw your attention to the fact that he's doing it.
 He holds the lam? up for you to put one jacketed arm through, then
 helps guide your other arm into the small hole. He turns you around to
 face him, and straightens the lam? for you. "There you are," he says,
 and kisses your cheek.

 (the floor cord)
 The floor cords are nothing more than long, insulated wires that carry
 electrical current between the floor reels and the scoring box.

>show protector to david
 David smiles at you. He holds the chest protector out for you, and you
 slip your arms under the straps. The mask blocking your peripheral
 vision makes your task difficult. You seem to remember it's the very

 Quick tip: to see if you're hooked up yet, you can always try SALUTE or
 FENCE.

 Fencing is, to various degrees and various people, a sport and a hobby.
 Today's Olympic-style sport is derived from the older, classical style
 of swordplay developed in Europe over the last several hundred years.
 In this work, as in the USFA (www.usfencing.org), the modern rules and
 styles are used.

 What that means to you is that the director (person who scores the
 match, or referee) is aided by electrical equipment: each fencer wears
 a metal vest called a lam? and plugs their foil (the weapon used in our
 game) into a box with lights. When the plunger on the tip of your foil
 is depressed (usually against the opponent), one of the lights on the
 box will light up. If *your* foil contacted *my* lam?, your colored
 light (either red or green, depending on which side you're on) will
 light up, indicating a touch on a valid target (which could score a
 point or "touch"). If your foil contacted anything else (my arm or leg,
 your shoe, the floor, the director), then the white light (we both have
 one colored and one white) will light up. The director watches the
 action, watches the box, and decides who, if anyone, gets a point each
 time he or she stops the action.

 It gets a bit more complicated when both fencers score a valid hit, but
 suffice it to say that the director must decide which of the two had
 priority, or right-of-way, to attack. That person is awarded the touch.

 Anyway, the important thing for you to figure out is just how to set up
 the electric circuits in the first place. The different circuits allow
 the box to distinguish between on-target and off-target hits; that is
 why your lam? must be connected to the circuit somehow. Obviously your
 foil has to be connected, so that the box will register when your foil
 tip is depressed. And all of it has to be reported back to the box over
 an electric circuit.

 For more hints as to what needs to be connected where, be sure to
 examine everything, maybe even the things David sets up.

>examine d-ring
 The D-ring is sewn onto the back of your lam?. Its purpose is solely to
 give the hook from the floor reel something to latch onto, to give the
 three-prong connection a bit of slack and make your life easier.

>wear foil
 You can't wear that!

>attach d-ring to lame
 That's not supposed to attach directly to the lam?. You may wish to
 attach it to the D-ring, or it may not be necessary at all.

>attach hook to d-ring
 You're not suited up enough to plug in yet.

>sure it is
 That's not a verb you need today.

>examine cord
 (the floor cord)
 The floor cords are nothing more than long, insulated wires that carry
 electrical current between the floor reels and the scoring box.

>examine reels
 The floor reel is made to connect you to the floor cord. It's supposed
 to sit at the end of the strip, and the floor cord plugs into it. The
 hook that comes out the front attaches to the fencer's body cord, and
 when released it retracts like a self-retracting tape measure. Your
 floor reels are Uhlmann made, with dark blue plastic casing and rubber
 feet to keep them in place.

>attach alligator clip to lame
 You attach the alligator clip directly to the metal vest, remembering
 to put it on the weapon arm side of your body as the rules require.

>salute
 Fencers don't salute until they are completely plugged in and ready to

>examine d-ring
 The D-ring is sewn onto the back of your lam?. Its purpose is solely to
 give the hook from the floor reel something to latch onto, to give the
 three-prong connection a bit of slack and make your life easier.

>examine hook
 The hook has a receptacle for the three-prong connector of the body
 cord, and it also attaches to the fencer's D-ring to prevent
 unnecessary pulling on the body cord.

>attach hook to d-ring
 You're not suited up enough to plug in yet.

>examine david
 Your husband is a tall man in his mid-thirties, with clear gray eyes

                           THE QUEEN OF SWORDS


                     [Please press SPACE to begin.]








 Each week, you spend four hours round-trip in a car to take a
 beginner's fencing class at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in
 Springfield. It's fun, you tell yourself, and it never hurts to be more
 active. David, on the other hand, wants to compete. Your husband wants
 to join the U.S. Fencing Association and begin competing in regional
 tournaments after only eight weeks of classes, when they tell people to
 take lessons for a whole year before competing. However, David will
 want what David will want, and you love your husband dearly, so...

 There's a tournament in Glen Falls this weekend, and you're going. On
 your last trip to VAF you spent over $900 on electric fencing
 equipment. The real problem is going to figure out how to use all of
 it: what plugs into where, which piece you need to put on first, and
 how to fence with a floor cord holding you back. That's why you and
 David are going to use tonight, while you have the room at the local
 library reserved, to practice gearing up for electric.

 David gets a good parking spot downtown, and the two of you haul the
 bags of equipment out of the trunk and into the library. The librarians
 wave at you as you pass, already used to seeing you, and the two of you
 make your way to one of the larger meeting rooms upstairs to set up the
 electric strip.

 David drops his equipment bag near the door and smiles at you. "I'll
 put the strip up," he says. "Why don't you go ahead and get your stuff
 on?" You look at your bag uncertainly. "I'm not sure I know where
 everything goes," you say. He grins. "Me neither," he says. "If you
 have trouble, let me know, and I'll try to help." He takes the bag with
 the scoring box and floor reels and goes to set up a table. You survey
 the room.

 Release 1 / Serial number 030426 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10

 McIntire Meeting Room, Downtown Library
 A large, open room, with plenty of room for a few fencers to practice.
 Of course, tonight it's just you and David. A row of tall windows line
 the western wall, and stacks of chairs are at either end of the long
 north-south room. The door to the hallway is east. An industrial-type
 carpet in garish red covers the floor.

 The open windows let in a welcome breeze.

>drop bag
 You set the bag down, out of the way against a wall.

 David pushes the table against the eastern wall.

>open it
 You open the fencing bag, revealing a mask, a jacket, a body cord, an
 electric foil, a lam?, a glove, a plastron and a chest protector.

 He sets the bag of scoring equipment on the table and opens it.

>take plastron
 Taken.

 David is rummaging in the bag.

>wear it
 You put on the plastron.

 David takes a floor reel and floor cord from the bag.

>take lame
 Taken.

 He walks to the north end of the room and sets down the floor reel.

>examine lame
 The lam? (pronounced "luh-MAY") is like a sleeveless, metal vest, used
 in electric foil fencing to define your target area--literally, since
 the opponent's blade must strike you on the lam? to complete the
 correct circuit. It The lam? is made to cover your torso from neck to
 waistline, with an additional section in front best described by
 drawing a line from your hips to your pelvis. Yours is an Uhlmann lam?,
 quite high quality, although it cost a good deal. There is a small,
 metal D-ring (shaped like the letter D) sewn into the back of the lam?.

 David plugs the floor cord into the floor reel.

>take body cord
 Taken.

 David walks back to the center of the room and looks in the bag on the
 table.

>take jacket
 Taken.

 David pulls the scoring box out of the bag and sets it on the table.

>unzip lame
 You unzip the lam?.

 He plugs the free end of the first floor cord into the scoring box.

>unzip jacket
 You unzip the jacket.

 David takes the other floor cord out of the bag and plugs one end into
 the box.

>examine jacket
 Your jacket covers your torso and arms while you fence. They are
 required to be white, and yours zips up the front (making it much
 easier to put on by yourself). Although the FIE requires 800 Newton
 resistance, you are merely fencing in the USFA, which has much more lax
 requirements than its European counterpart, so yours is only rated at
 350 Newtons.

 David takes the other reel from the bag.

>attach body cord to jacket
 You would achieve nothing by this.

 He walks down to the south end of the room, and winks at you.

>examine sleeve
 Your jacket covers your torso and arms while you fence. They are
 required to be white, and yours zips up the front (making it much
 easier to put on by yourself). Although the FIE requires 800 Newton
 resistance, you are merely fencing in the USFA, which has much more lax
 requirements than its European counterpart, so yours is only rated at
 350 Newtons.

 Setting the floor reel on the carpet, David plugs the free end of the
 floor cord into it.

>examine body cord
 Your body cord is used in electric fencing to connect several different
 circuits of electricity. On one end, the two-prong connector attaches
 to your electric foil. The other end has an alligator clip, to hook to
 your lam?, and a three-prong connector, to plug into the floor reel. In
 between is about five feet of insulated wiring, which is supposed to
 run up your sleeve and down your back.

 David turns to survey his work.

>put body cord in sleeve
 You slide the two-prong end of the body cord into the jacket sleeve.

 "Oops," David says, "I forgot to plug in the box."

>wear jacket
 You start to pull the jacket on, but something feels funny. Your front
 seems very... unprotected. Maybe there's another piece you're supposed
 to wear first.

 He walks back to the table in the center of the east wall.

>wear chest protector
 (first taking the chest protector)
 You put on the chest protector.

 David peers in the bag and gets out the AC adapter for the scoring box.

>wear jacket
 You pull the jacket on, trying to keep the dangling bits of the body
 cord out of the way. What a pain!

 David plugs the adapter into the box.

>zip jacket
 You zip up the jacket, tugging the zipper up to make sure it's all the
 way up.

 He plugs the free end of the adapter into the electrical outlet in the
 wall.

>wear lame
 You struggle to get your jacketed arms through the small openings in
 the lam?. Finally, you get it on.

 "There!" David says, looking over the electric strip in satisfaction.
 He turns to you. "Now, let's get suited up and then we can fence!"

>zip lame
 You zip up the lam?, and adjust the Velcro at the collar to make sure
 you have a proper fit.

 David looks you over. "Looks like you don't quite have all your stuff.
 Check in your bag--if you need help with something, show it to me."

>attach alligator clip to lame
 You attach the alligator clip directly to the metal vest, remembering
 to put it on the weapon arm side of your body as the rules require.

 Meanwhile, David gets his gear on amazingly fast. He says, "We'll
 salute as soon as we're both ready."

>attach two-prong to foil
 You attach the two-prong connector, which pokes out through your sleeve
 next to your glove, to the foil. It clicks into place.

 David connects to the far floor reel. "I'm about ready," he says.

>take foil
 Taken.

>examine cord
 (the floor cord)
 The floor cords are nothing more than long, insulated wires that carry
 electrical current between the floor reels and the scoring box.

>examine body cord
 Your body cord is used in electric fencing to connect several different
 circuits of electricity. On one end, the two-prong connector attaches
 to your electric foil. The other end has an alligator clip, to hook to
 your lam?, and a three-prong connector, to plug into the floor reel. In
 between is about five feet of insulated wiring, which is supposed to
 run up your sleeve and down your back.

>put reel in d-ring
 There's no need to move either of the reels; David will have them just
 where he wants them.

>attach reel to d-ring
 You're not suited up enough to plug in yet.

>attach three-prong to reel
 You connect the three-prong end of the body cord with the hook out of
 the floor reel. Getting close to fencing time!

 You're not suited up enough to plug in yet.

 That's not a verb you need today.

>wield foil
 That's not a verb you need today.

>wear mask
 (first taking the mask)
 You put on the mask.

>attach reel to d-ring
 You attach the hook from the floor reel to the D-ring on your lam?. One
 step closer to fencing!

>salute
 First things first: you NEVER salute with a mask on. It's considered
 very rude.

>remove mask
 You take off the mask.

>salute
 You raise your foil in a traditional salute towards David. He smiles at
 you, and you sweep the blade downward to finish the salute. You are now
 (almost) ready to fence!

>wear mask
 You put on the mask.

>fence
 You drop into your en guarde position, pleased to see David doing the
 same. You have fenced him often enough to know that you need to hang
 back, wait, and try to parry (or block) his attack, and riposte (or
 attack immediately after parrying). You take a few cautious steps
 forward (advances) and back (retreats), while waiting for him to make
 the first move. The floor cord tugs gently at you, through the hook-up
 on the D-ring, but after a few moments you don't notice it at all.

 David makes a few feints, which you ignore, and then suddenly he is
 attacking! You try to parry, but it comes too late, and a loud buzz
 emanates from the scoring box. You look at the box, and see David's red
 light glowing, indicating that he scored a valid touch. You knew that
 much; you can still feel the spot on your chest where he landed. But to
 see it on the box is so exciting!

 "One," you say to David, holding up a finger to indicate that he scored
 a touch. He nods, and backs up to his en guarde line. You both pause,
 and then begin fencing again. This time, you think, maybe it isn't such
 a good idea to try to defend, since he is so much faster than I am!
 With that in mind, you spring forward, tapping David's blade aside as
 you lunge (a "beat attack"). But David is fast, and he recovers from
 the beat in time to parry your attack. His riposte comes for you, and
 you do your best to parry it, but the buzzing of the score box can't be
 denied.

 This time, there are two lights: David's red on-target light, and your
 white off-target light. You must have hit him off-target somewhere in
 there. Since the two of you are pretty new to the sport, and you have
 no director or referee to oversee your bout, you both shrug.
 Right-of-way, or "priority," can be hard to call, so you decide to
 throw it out.

 .....

 You and David spend the next hour practicing with your electric
 equipment, preparing for Saturday's tournament in Glen Falls. You don't
 expect to win any bouts in the tournament, and maybe not even to score
 any touches, but you feel confident you will at least know how to hook
 up.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.

 It only takes a moment of inattention.  The snowstorm draws thicker and
 the faint grey silhouette of the reconnaissance plane fades away
 completely.  You bank hard, yanking on the control column with mild
 panic, but it's too late.  Your paths have diverged, unlikely to cross
 again as long as this lethal weather continues.

 The lumbering two-seater plane you were supposed to be escorting is
 alone and unprotected.  And she is out there: lightning fast, deadly
 accurate and cold as ice.  You'd consider turning back to the airbase
 right away.

 If, that is, you even knew where you were.

 Snowblind Aces
 An adventure/romance in the snow by C.E.J.  Pacian
 Version 5 - Developed with TADS 3

 [Type 'About' if this is your first time playing.
 Type 'Credits' to learn who's responsible for this drivel.]

 Biplane Cockpit (sitting in the pilot's seat)
 You're seated in the cockpit of your Swordfish biplane, exposed to the
 elements.  The small windscreen ahead does little to keep the harsh,
 icy wind from cutting right through you, and you're surrounded on all
 sides by blinding white mist.

 The plane's control column juts up in front of you.

>about
 Snowblind Aces is a short, highly replayable adventure/romance, written
 in two weeks for the TIGSource Text the Halls competition.  This is
 intended to be a puzzle-less game, but if you do get stuck, type HINTS
 to read some relevant pointers.

 Some notes about conversations: converse using 'ASK/TELL [character]
 ABOUT [subject]'.  Type 'TOPICS' to see a list of subjects that your
 character thinks are currently relevant.

 From time to time you'll see some more unusual responses suggested in
 brackets, for example '(You could remind Leonard who you are, or
 pretend not to know him)'.  Sometimes you can simply change the subject
 to something else, but often you'll have to choose one of the suggested
 actions (although typing REMIND or PRETEND should suffice).

 If your interpreter is spiffy enough, conversations will feature blue,
 underlined hyperlinks that you can click on to follow the flow of the
 dialogue.

 Finally, note that the path through this game is short and
 straightforward.  You can spend a lot of time talking with the other
 character, but you don't have to if you don't want.

 Hugses,
    Pacian

>pretend
 The word "pretend" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points out
 an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your next
 command.)

>examine column
 Your Swordfish's trusty joystick features a tempting red button on the
 top.  Pushing or pulling the column will adjust your pitch.

 You suppress a shiver.

>push column
 You grip the control column tightly and push it forward, hoping to sink
 within sight of the ground.

 Almost before you can react, a huge shape swoops out of the white void
 below: a scarlet triplane, close enough that you can see its pilot, and
 the surprised expression on her face.  You pull on the control column
 hard and punch the throttle, feeling your plane strain to rise higher.
 For an instant you think you've avoided disaster.

 And then the whole fuselage lurches, the sound of metal on metal
 scraping right into your brain as you collide glancingly with the other
 plane.  You look over your shoulder just in time to see the scarlet
 triplane disappear into the clouds, trailing thick black smoke.
 Turning back to your controls you immediately notice the epileptic
 motion of the rapidly spinning altimeter.

 It would seem that you have a problem.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)
 (If you'd prefer not to be notified about score changes in the future,
 type NOTIFY OFF.)

>push button
 You press the button and your plane's twin machineguns strafe the murk
 ahead in a display of bright muzzle flash and loud, mechanical
 rattling.

 Pointless, but satisfying all the same.

 The engine stalls for a second before lurching back to life, something
 loose and metallic grating inside it.

>verbose
 VERBOSE mode is now selected.

>land plane
 The word "land" is not necessary in this story.

>pull joystick
 The control column moves loosely, clearly having no effect on the
 plane's ailerons.

 The control column twitches spasmodically.

>inventory
 You are carrying a revolver, and you're wearing a pair of goggles, a
 parachute pack, a white scarf, a fur-lined jacket, some breeches, and
 some sheepskin boots.

 The propeller flickers in its motion, struggling to keep turning.

>shoot me
 You miss.

 You glance over your shoulder in time to see something go flying
 backwards from beneath the plane.  Hopefully nothing too important...

>undo
 Taking back one turn: "shoot me".

 You are sitting in the pilot's seat.

 You glance over your shoulder in time to see something go flying
 backwards from beneath the plane.  Hopefully nothing too important...

>stand
 You check your parachute and climb up onto your seat.  After you throw
 your leg over the side, it's surprisingly easy to push yourself away
 from the plane and leap into the mist.

 Not quite as aerodynamic as your Swordfish, you drop like a stone,
 plummeting into the murky white void below.  Ice and fog crowd close
 around you, obscuring every direction.  The only reason you know you're
 falling is because of the way your stomach seems to still be a hundred
 metres above you somewhere.  Remembering the single parachute jump you
 performed in basic training, you fumble with the chord and yank hard,
 the harness suddenly seeming to pull you upwards.

 Falling
 You're hanging from a parachute, descending slowly into a blank white
 void.  Without the sound of your plane's engine, everything seems
 shockingly silent.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>SAVE
>cf8
 Saved.

>SAVE
>cf1

>wait
 Time passes...

 Your plane will have hit the ground by now, shattering into pieces,
 bursting into flames.

>wait
 Time passes...

 But you're okay.  You made it.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The hard part is over.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The mist beneath you parts.  Below you are thick, evergreen trees,
 garnished with snow, clinging to sharp black rocks.

 Now you have a frame of reference, you realise just how fast you're
 falling.








 You open your eyes.  You feel remarkably well given the circumstances.
 The air is fresh and invigorating, the sound of birdsong and rustling
 leaves is like soothing music.  Time to get moving - for all you know,
 you might be behind enemy lines.

 Forest Clearing (lying on the ground)
 Snow-coated evergreen trees surround you on all sides, their roots
 tangling into rugged black rocks.  Snow falls from the bright white sky
 above.

 The canopy of your parachute is suspended in the branches of a tree,
 like a giant, tattered spider's web.

>undo
 Taking back one turn: "z".

 Falling

 your chance.

 You are already carrying the parachute pack.

 You are carrying a revolver, and you're wearing a pair of goggles, a

 An icy breeze passes through the clearing, the soft rustling of leaves
 following in its wake.

 The trees seem unperturbed by the cold.  You envy them.

 The best protection against the northern weather short of setting
 yourself on fire.

 like a giant, tattered spider's web.

 A bird chirrups melodically.

>stand
 You sit up, feeling a lot weaker than you thought you were.  As you
 start to shift your legs, something inside your left calf moves.  White
 lightning bolts of pain jolt across your vision and you collapse back
 with a scream of pain.

 You've broken your leg.  You're lying in the freezing snow, and you're
 not going anywhere.

>take stick
 You see no stick here.

>examine tree
 The trees seem unperturbed by the cold.  You envy them.

 You hear something rustling among the trees.

>examine roots
 The word "roots" is not necessary in this story.

>shoot tree
>examine leg
 It doesn't look like that would achieve much.

 A feral icekin blunders into the clearing, looking around with its
 empty black eyes.  Probably attracted by your scream of pain.  Nice
 going, Lucas.

 Your left leg looks normal enough, but something feels very wrong
 inside it.  The slightest movement is agony.

 The icekin looks around, breathing heavily through its sharp, uneven
 teeth.

 You hear the icekin's rasping breaths.

 The icekin fixes its lifeless black eyes on you, emitting a low growl.

>examine icekin
 A lumbering, bipedal creature, its shaggy white coat stained with
 blood.  It clutches a long, rusted blade.

 The icekin lumbers towards you.

>shoot icekin
 You level your revolver at the icekin and squeeze the trigger.  It
 grunts, and takes a few shuffling steps towards you, as if it hasn't
 even noticed what's happened.

 After the third step, blood begins to drip from its mouth, and it
 collapses face-down into the snow.

 A dark figure strides into the clearing, a flare gun in her hand.  She
 slips it into her belt and rests a hand on her hip, surveying you with
 her one good eye.  "I heard a scream," she says wryly, "But it seems
 you can handle yourself."  She looks disapprovingly at your gun."You
 don't need to point that thing at me, Lucas.  They pay us to shoot
 planes and we're both grounded after our little airborne contretemps,
 aren't we?"

 You smile in spite of the pain.  "The Scarlet Baroness."

 She allows herself a carnivorous grin.  "Yes.  The two great aces, face
 to face at last."

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 (You could tell her it feels like you already know her, or play it
 cool.)

>examine baroness
 The Scarlet Baroness is a tall, imposing woman with long, fiery red
 hair and an eyepatch.  She's clad in black leather and a thick fur
 coat.  You have her full attention.

 An awkward silence hangs between the two of you.

>tell her it feels like I already know her
 "Yes," you say.  "It doesn't feel like an introduction.  You and I, we
 know one another better than many friends.  Than many lovers, even."

 "Exactly," she says with a crooked grin.  "I know I've consumed every
 snippet of information that might give me an advantage over you, I've
 learnt your flying style, your weaknesses and quirks.  I expect no less
 from you.  And we're certainly dance partners of the most intimate
 kind.  There's no-one else I'd be happier to have shoot me out of the
 sky."

 Your eyes meet.  Her's is icy green, studying you in a way you find
 difficult to fathom - catlike, perhaps, or aloof.

 "Imelda," she says suddenly.  "Maybe you just know me as the Scarlet
 Baroness, but my name's Imelda von Strassenbach."

 "Come on," she adds, "I think it's going to really get snowing soon.
 We need to get to shelter."

>look
 Forest Clearing (lying on the ground)
 Snow-coated evergreen trees surround you on all sides, their roots
 tangling into rugged black rocks.  Snow falls from the bright white sky
 above.

 The canopy of your parachute is suspended in the branches of a tree,
 like a giant, tattered spider's web.

 A dead icekin lies in the snow, steam rising from its pooling blood.

 Imelda watches you intently.

 Imelda looks down at your leg.  "Are you okay?  Can you walk?"

 "I think it's broken."

 She kneels down by your side.  "Let me take a look."

 "Be sure to look twice as long," you advise her, "since you just have
 the one eye."

 She purses her lips.  "You're right.  I'll do that."

 "Ow!"

 "Yeah, it's broken alright."

 "Thanks, doctor."

 "I'll have to see about making a splint.  And then I guess you'll have
 to lean on me, if you don't mind."

 "Anything to help you feel useful."

 Downed Triplane (lying on the ground)
 A scarlet triplane lies half-buried in the snow, leaning to one side.
 You're huddled beneath its slanting wing, mostly sheltered from the
 freezing wind and falling snow.

 Imelda is huddled close by your side.

 "It's getting dark," Imelda says.  "We'll have to stay here at least
 for tonight, and then move on tomorrow morning if the weather lets up."

>examine me
 You're Lucas Thane: daredevil fighter ace, knight of the air.

 "By the way," Imelda says, "why exactly did you feel the need to fly
 into me?"

 "That's funny," you reply.  "I thought that you were the one who flew
 into me."

 The triplane rocks slightly in the wind.

 You're not about to kiss the enemy without at least a hint that she'd
 like you to.

 Imelda sighs, her breath hanging in front of her like a delicate cloud.

>preposition Imelda
 The word "preposition" is not necessary in this story.

>smell cloud
 You are not aware of any cloud here.

>ask imelda about splint
 You meet Imelda's eye and she looks at you expectantly.

 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

>ask imelda about leg
 "Is my leg going to be okay, do you think?"

 Imelda affects nervousness.  "Well, I was trying not to let you know,
 but I think it's going to be fatal.  If you have any last minute
 confessions of love to tell to someone, you should probably do it
 sooner rather than later."

 You shrug.  "No, nothing like that."

 She folds her arms.  "Oh.  I see."

 Your breath leaves little clouds in the air.

>ask imelda about love
 You clear your throat.  "So, Imelda, how are things with the men in
 your life?"

 "Do you mean my male friends among the Sky Mercenaries?  Or are you
 sneakily trying to ask about us?"

 Snow continues to drift down from above.

>topics
 You could ask her about herself, your predicament, the Swordfish
 biplane, the Thunderbolt triplane, the feral icekin, the Sky
 Mercenaries, us, friends, or her eyepatch.

>confess love
 The word "confess" is not necessary in this story.

>ask imelda about us
 "Imelda, about us..."

 She looks down at her feet.  "What about us?"

 "Well, what's your take on it?  Why do we keep circling around one
 another?  In the air or otherwise."

 Still without looking at you, she says, "I can't really remember how we
 first met, except that I suddenly realised this plane from the 5th
 Imperial Air Squadron kept seeking me out to duel with me, probably
 because I'm an obvious target in my scarlet plane.  I usually brought
 down every enemy plane I came across, but you always managed to escape.
 I only shot you down that once.  I started to research you, found out
 who you were, started to learn your flying style, had a chance to kill
 you, but didn't take it, and then flew into you in the middle of a
 snowstorm.  And now here we are."

 There's a pause, and then she adds, "But that's not what you asked,
 really, is it?  That's just the story of us - I didn't mention my
 feelings at all."  She smiles apologetically.

 A chill wind passes under the wing, making you both shiver.

>ask imelda about feelings
 "So what are your feelings for me?"

 Imelda remains strangely silent, just looks at you with an ambiguous
 expression.  If you want to press the matter, perhaps you should tell
 her about your feelings.

>tell imelda about my feelings
 You cough.  "Imelda, I just wanted to say that..."

 (You could tell her you're in love with her, or tell her she's like
 your best friend.)

>tell imelda about feelings

>tell imelda about feelings

 "You know, I'd never seen an icekin up close before today."

 Imelda laughs.  "Count yourself lucky.  Icekin come in all shapes and
 sizes, but they all have pointy teeth and empty stomachs.  Just be glad
 this was a feral with a blunt knife.  It'd gut you and eat you, and
 that's it.  The Ice Queen's trained icekin soldiers, on the other hand,
 now you really don't want them to take you prisoner."

 Your breath leaves little clouds in the air.

>tell her i'm in love with her
 You decide to just say it.  You don't even look at her.  "Imelda, I'm
 in love with you."

 She refrains from looking at you either.  "I'm in love with you too,"
 she states, matter-of-factly.  "It makes perfect sense, I think.  We're
 young, we're forced to deal with one another repeatedly in intense,
 passionate, but graceful and playful circumstances, we understand the
 stresses, the fears we each experience, we both love flying... and so
 we grow attracted to one another."

 The two of you lean closer as she speaks, your lips brushing together.
 "My lips are numb," you complain.

 She shushes you.  "Let me warm them up."

 After a while, you lean back, faces flushed, sitting perhaps a little
 closer than before.

 Imelda straightens her hair and exhales slowly.  "That was almost as
 satisfying as shooting you down."

 Imelda's attention drifts away from you.

 It doesn't look like that would achieve much.

 Imelda meets your eye briefly.

>ask imelda about eyepatch
 You meet Imelda's eye and she looks at you expectantly.

 You meet Imelda's single eye.  "Um..." you say, "so how did you...?"

 "How did I what, Lucas?" she replies innocently.

 You clear your throat.  "You know... the eye patch..."

 "What about it, Lucas?"

 "Well, I was just wondering what happened to your eye."

 "I was shot," she says simply.  "It's an occupational hazard when
 you're around planes with machineguns strapped to them."

 "Yes, I've noticed."

 You're not wearing that.

>ask imelda about snow queen
 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

>ask imelda about ice queen
 "So, as the Ice Queen's pet fighter pilot I bet you've had tea with her
 and everything?"

 Imelda raises her chin.  "She did personally present a medal to me.
 Her hands were really cold...  But I'm hardly her pet.  The Sky
 Mercenaries always retain full autonomy.  We're merely under contract
 to her and the Northern Territories."

>topics
 You could ask her about herself, your predicament, the Swordfish
 biplane, the Thunderbolt triplane, the Northern Territories, the Sky
 Mercenaries, us, yourself, how you first met, shooting you down, the
 chance to kill you, duelling, or friends.

>ask imelda about sky mercenaries
 "What exactly are you Sky Pirates all about then?"

 Imelda looks at you with her good eye and sighs theatrically.

 "Sky Mercenaries," you correct yourself, "whatever."

 "We're the children of Aerocity, born in the skies, at home there,
 understanding wind, gravity and inertia the way most people understand
 walking."

 "You're not afraid of heights then?"

 She smiles.  "No, Lucas, not really."  After a moment she adds, "Look,
 I know we get a bad rap in the southern newspapers, but we're people
 just like anyone else.  I couldn't wish for better friends than those I
 have on the zeppelin."

>ask imelda about predicament
 "This is quite a situation we're in," you say.

 "Yep," Imelda agrees.

 "Any idea what to do?"

 Imelda tips her head to one side.  "Maybe."

 "Care to share?"

 "Well, as I see it, we have two main problems.  We need to get to
 safety tomorrow, and we need to keep warm."

 Snow continues to drift down from above.

>ask imelda about zeppelin
 "So you guys are based on a zeppelin?" you ask Imelda.

 "Of course," she says smugly.  "There's no quicker way to get your
 planes in the air than to have them in the air already."

>get eyepatch
 Taken.

>ask imelda about safety
 "I was thinking," you tell Imelda.

 "Did it hurt?" she asks.

 "A little.  Mostly it was just an unfamiliar sensation.  What I was
 thinking was that we should head south from here.  We'll probably reach
 the Imperial lines in no time.  After that, a hot bath, some steaming
 soup..."

 Imelda seems unconvinced.  "Or we could head north.  We'll probably
 reach the Northern lines in no time, after which etcetera, etcetera."

 "Hang on," you say, "Weren't you telling me I didn't ever want to end
 up a prisoner of the Ice Queen's icekin soldiers?"

 "You won't be a prisoner of the icekin soldiers.  You'll be my
 prisoner."

 "Sounds a bit kinky for my tastes."

 Imelda smiles slyly.  "You have no idea."

 "Maybe we should just split up," you suggest.  "I bet we could both
 make it by ourselves.  Then no-one has to be anyone's prisoner."

 Imelda shrugs.  "Look, I'm heading north.  I'd love it if you'd come
 with me, but..."

 (You could agree to go north with her, ask her to go south with you,
 tell her you should split up, or tell her you can't decide.)

>ask imelda about warmth
 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

>wear eyepatch
 Okay, you're now wearing the eye patch.

 You rub your hands together to try to keep them warm.

>ask imelda about ice queen
 "So, as the Ice Queen's pet fighter pilot I bet you've had tea with her
 and everything?"

 Imelda raises her chin.  "She did personally present a medal to me.
 Her hands were really cold...  But I'm hardly her pet.  The Sky
 Mercenaries always retain full autonomy.  We're merely under contract
 to her and the Northern Territories."

>ask imelda about keeping warm
 "I've got an idea to keep us warm," you tell Imelda.

 She takes a break from breathing into her hands.  "Sounds great to me.
 What is it?"

 (You could suggest thinking warm thoughts, suggest sharing body heat,
 or suggest making a fire.)

>suggest thinking warm thoughts
 "Well," you begin uncertainly, "we could think warm thoughts."

 Imelda offers you a very condescending look.  "So even as our bodies
 freeze to death, we'll be warm in our minds?"

 "Exactly.  We just need to picture ourselves sitting in front of a
 roaring fire, or lying on a sunny beach, or... uh, inside the stomach
 of a feral icekin..."

 Imelda pats you on your unbroken leg.  "It's a good thing you have
 looks," is all she says.

>share body heat
 The word "share" is not necessary in this story.

>suggest sharing body heat
 That command can't be used right now.

>ask imelda about keeping warm
 "I've got an idea to keep us warm," you tell Imelda.

 She takes a break from breathing into her hands.  "Sounds great to me.
 What is it?"

 (You could suggest thinking warm thoughts, suggest sharing body heat,
 or suggest making a fire.)

>suggest sharing body heat
 "I was just thinking how we're both so cold, and yet we're both full of
 red hot blood..."

 Imelda raises an eyebrow.  "Cannibalism?"

 You grimace.  "Hugging?"

 Imelda smiles evilly.  "Oh, I see.  Can't bear to keep your hands to
 yourself for much longer?"

 "It would take an iron will."

 She slips her arms around your waist and presses herself against you.
 "Still, it's a small price to pay to avoid freezing to death."

 You wrap your arms around her in turn.  "Yes," you say austerely, "we
 must be brave."

>ask imelda about keeping warm
 "I've got an idea to keep us warm," you tell Imelda.

 She takes a break from breathing into her hands.  "Sounds great to me.
 What is it?"

 The triplane rocks slightly in the wind.

 (You could suggest thinking warm thoughts, suggest sharing body heat,
 or suggest making a fire.)

>ask imelda to go south
 Imelda refuses your request.

>ask imelda about safety
 "About where we're headed..." you begin.

 "Have you reached a decision yet?"  Imelda asks you.

 (You could agree to go north with her, ask her to go south with you,
 tell her you should split up, or tell her you can't decide.)

>ask imelda to go south
 Imelda refuses your request.

>agree to go north
 "Okay," you say.  "I'll go north with you."
>tell imedla about empire

 Imelda squeezes you around the waist.  "I'm glad.  And...  I know what
 a sacrifice this must be for you.  Thank you."

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 The word "imedla" is not necessary in this story.

>tell imelda about empire
 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

>topics
 You could ask her about your predicament, herself, Aerocity, keeping
 warm, getting to safety, the Swordfish biplane, the Thunderbolt
 triplane, the Northern Territories, newspapers, us, yourself, how you
 first met, shooting you down, the chance to kill you, duelling, or
 friends.

>ask imelda about newspapers
 "Have you read any newspapers recently?" you ask Imelda.

 "You mean like the Northern Financial Times?"

 "I mean like the Weekly Mirror or the Mail News."

 "I thought as much.  A shocking amount of those papers is about us,
 isn't it?  According to one, I'm irresponsible for continuing to fly
 into combat while blatantly pregnant with your love child."

 "I wonder what they'd make of all this..."  You wave your hand around
 at your cosy little love nest in the freezing snow.

 "If we don't make it," Imelda says, "they'll turn it into our lovers'
 suicide pact."

 "Headline: They couldn't bring themselves to fight any more!"

 Downed Triplane (lying on the ground)
 A scarlet triplane lies half-buried in the snow, leaning to one side.
 You're huddled beneath its slanting wing, mostly sheltered from the
 freezing wind and falling snow.

 Imelda is huddled close by your side, watching you intently.

 A chill wind passes under the wing, making you both shiver.

>tell imelda about aerocity
 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

>ask imelda about safety
 "About where we're headed..." you begin.

 "Have you changed your mind?"  Imelda asks you.  "We were both going to
 head north."

 (You could ask her to go south with you, tell her you should split up,
 or tell her you haven't changed your mind.)

>ask imelda about aerocity
 "I've heard of Aerocity, but I'm not sure I believe in it.  It's
 supposed to be a city suspended from balloons?"

 Imelda bursts out with laughter.  It's nice to see her be so familiar
 with you, but you can't help but feel a bit embarrassed.  "That's a
 good one, I'll have to remember that.  No, Lucas, Aerocity is not a
 city suspended from balloons, but it is high up in a mountain range.
 We're quite familiar with the concept of falling, and our efforts to
 avoid it have made us the best in the world at flying."

>go north
 The slanting triplane wing is in the way.

 Imelda laughs suddenly.  "A city suspended from balloons.  That's
 brilliant."

>enter triplane
 That is not something you can enter.

>examine plane
 A plane with three wings, one on top of the other.  Bit extravagant,
 really.

>ask imelda about northern territories
 You look around at the thick snowfall.  "The climate's nice in the
 Northern Territories this year."

 "I guess this is why they call her the Ice Queen."

>ask imelda about herself
 "So..." you begin, "why not tell me a little about yourself, Imelda?"

 Imelda looks thoughtful.  "I suppose... it's a bit of a broad topic.
 Tell you what, why don't we start with you telling me about myself."

 "You want me to tell you about yourself?" you repeat.  "Don't you
 already know yourself quite well?"

 "I'm interested to know what you think of me.  Come on, tell me."

>tell imelda about herself
 You take a deep breath.  "Okay.  You're the notorious ace Sky Mercenary
 known as the Scarlet Baroness, real name Imelda von Strassa- von
 Strassenba-"

 "Von Strassenbach."

 "Who's telling this story?  Imelda von Strassenbach.  A fiery redhead
 with an ice cold temperament."

 "More than my temperament is ice cold at the moment."

 "You've racked up over seventy confirmed kills-"

 "Seventy-six."

 "You're an outstanding pilot, who can best even the most elite southern
 pilots, and you're hopelessly in love, according to the scandal sheets,
 with one Lucas Thane, the Benevolent Empire's ace of aces."

 Imelda seems happy with your little report.  "Is that so," she purrs.
 "Although: hopelessly in love, pursuing in a predatory fashion... it's
 a thin line, I think."

>ask imelda about benevolent empire
 "You're surely a fan of the Benevolent Empire and its attempts to
 civilise the world?"

 Imelda scoffs.  "It's hard to consider an empire benevolent when it
 thinks that rearranging the world to suit its own economic needs is
 'civilising' it."

 "You don't think the people of the Northern Territories would benefit
 from giving us all their noxious petroleum?"

 "I think they've benefited best by giving it to us Sky Mercenaries."

>ask imelda about warmth
 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

>ask imelda about me
 "Do you know much about me?" you ask Imelda.

 "All the important stuff," she says.  "Your flying style, your
 weaknesses."

 You study her carefully.  "My weaknesses?"

 "You always underestimate your ability to fly in a crosswind, you're
 too afraid of stalling, and you've balked at two separate opportunities
 to shoot me down because the bullets would probably have passed through
 my body."

 "I see."

 Snow continues to drift down from above.

>ask imelda about keeping warm
 "I've got an idea to keep us warm," you tell Imelda.

 She takes a break from breathing into her hands.  "Sounds great to me.
 What is it?"

 (You could suggest thinking warm thoughts, suggest sharing body heat,
 or suggest making a fire.)

>suggest making a fire
 You look around.  "I think we could build a fire.  If we put it right
 there it should be close enough to warm us up, but the wind will blow
 the smoke away from us."

 Imelda crawls out from under the wing and stands up, snow crunching
 beneath her feet.  "Okay, I'll go find some wood, or anything else that
 looks like it'll burn.  Give me your gun.  I'd hate to have to face
 down a feral icekin with nothing but a couple of pine branches."

 "Don't you still have that flare gun?" you ask her.

 "Yeah, but I'd rather save its one shot for summoning help.  Come on,
 hand it over."

 (You could agree, or politely refuse.)

>ask imelda for flare gun
 "We can talk after I get back," Imelda says.  "In the meantime, just
 tell me: are you going to give me your gun?"

>trade
 The word "trade" is not necessary in this story.

>agree
 You hand your gun to Imelda, handle first.  "You've not managed to
 shoot me yet," you tell her, "and it's hardly for lack of trying.  I
 think you must like me too much."

 She purses her lips and tucks the revolver into her belt.  "It's
 certainly not that you're a difficult target to hit."

 She turns around and stomps off into the snow.








 Time passes slowly while Imelda is gone.  You feel yourself growing
 sleepy, and the feeling leaves your hands and feet.  Only the dull pain
 in your broken leg keeps you awake.








 You snap back to reality as something approaches, trudging quickly
 through the frost.  Before you have time to consider what to do if it
 turns out to be a dangerous creature, Imelda appears in front of you
 and dumps an armful of branches and sticks into the snow.

 "Gods it's cold," she announces, throwing herself onto all fours and
 crawling back under the wing.  She curls up right next to you,
 shivering, and you obligingly wrap your arms around her to help warm
 her up.  Not entirely a selfless act, as you're pretty cold yourself.

 "Okay," Imelda says after a while.  "Got to try and turn this ugly heap
 of sticks into a nice fire..."

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 (You could let her get on with it, or tell her you can do better.)

>SAVE

>tell her i can do better
 The story doesn't understand that command.  Please use ASK ACTOR ABOUT
 TOPIC (or just A TOPIC).

 Imelda rearranges the piles of sticks slightly.

>tell her you can do better
 You shift your broken leg so that you can grab a couple of sticks from
 the pile.  "I think the Boy Scouts need to take over here," you tell
 Imelda.

 She gives you a very doubtful look.  "Excuse me?  The Sky Guides are
 more than capable of rubbing two sticks together.  Unless you can think
 of a way an all-male group might have gained extra practice in that
 regard?"

 "Clearly you don't have enough confidence in your abilities to just get
 on with it."

 "I'm just trying to get you to save your energy."

 You both tend to the sticks in intense silence from then on.  But the
 fire doesn't suddenly spark to life, it forms slowly from a wisp of
 smoke, and it's hard to tell which of you is more responsible for it.
 When it's crackling away nicely, you both sit back,
 shoulder-to-shoulder.

 "I told you to save your energy," Imelda says.  "That was clearly my
 spark that lit it."

 You shake your head.  "My sparks were much more vibrant.  You could
 tell they had the Lucas Thane never-give-up attitude."

 "Fine, keep lying to yourself.  We both know the truth."

 "I agree that one of us is in denial, but I don't think it's me."

 Imelda holds out her hands to the fire.  "It's nice that we got it
 done, though."

 You hold out your own hands.  "I don't dispute that."

 Swordfish biplane, the Thunderbolt triplane, falling, herself, flying,

>ask imelda about hair
 "Your hair is the most striking colour," you tell Imelda.

 She runs her fingers through her curls.  "Thank you."

 "Is it natural?"

 She suddenly glares at you.  "You might maintain the most fleeting hope
 of one day finding out for sure."

>ask her about dueling
 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

>ask her about the chance to kill me
 "That one time you came out of the sun..." you begin.  "It was perfect.
 You had me."

 "Yes," Imelda says.  "I had you.  Not just your plane, but you.  I
 couldn't take the shot.  You've done the same yourself."

 You lightly touch her arm.  "Well, we're the only ones who know."

>ask imelda about kill count
 "What was that number again?"

 "I've downed seventy six aircraft," she says.

 You sniff.  "A lot of balloons and two-seaters, though..."

>hug her
 You wrap your arms around Imelda and squeeze her tightly.

 "Why Lucas," she says wryly, hugging you back, "you must contain your
 obvious desire for me."

 "I'm just trying to keep warm," you reply.

 "Yes, keep telling yourself that."

>ask imelda about ace of aces
 You look around the snowy environs.  "It's interesting when you think
 about it... here we both are, two aces of aces..."

 "Aces of aces?  There's the ace of aces, which is myself.  And then
 there are a few regional titles like southern ace of aces, like this
 fellow who's all looks and no brains.  You'd like him.  But it's not
 really a concept that makes sense when you pluralise it."

 "Sure it does," you insist.  "There's room for more than one at the
 top."

 "Not much room.  It'd be pretty cramped."

 "You have some sort of objection to being physically close to me?"

 She reaches over to toussle your hair.  "Only in the abstract."

>sleep
 You let your head rest on Imelda's shoulder, and sleep descends like a
 dark blanket.

 The night is cold, and the two of you cling to one another for warmth,
 but the snow has finally stopped falling and the fire burns until
 morning.

 Then the two of you struggle to your feet, Imelda just contending with
 aches and cramps while you have to worry about your broken leg.
 Looking around at the pristine forest, everything covered in thick
 sheets of snow, you begin to make your way north, Imelda encouraging
 you to lean on her as much as you can.  Eventually, the bright scarlet
 wingtip of her triplane has disappeared from view.








 Not long after that...

 You sit by the window, looking down on the clouds, feeling the
 throbbing of the zeppelin's engine.  The door opens and Imelda enters.

 "Is this a conjugal visit?" you ask her.

 She looks puzzled.  "Have I ever made any other kind of visit?"

 She walks across your improbably luxurious cabin - not that you're
 allowed to leave it - and sits on the window sill next to you.

 "Are you okay?" she asks.  "I thought they'd be a little more lenient
 with you, but it seems you're going to be in here til the war ends."

 You shrug.  "The view's nice.  The company's great.  I've caught up on
 my reading."

 "Wouldn't you be more comfortable lying on the bed?" she asks.

 You look at her with mock naivety.  "Why do you ask?"








 Years later...

 Imelda rolls off of you and sparks up a cigarette, the sheets around
 her hips.  You study her silhouette in the twilight.

 "The air race tomorrow," she says.

 "Everyone will be there," you say proudly.  "Everyone wants to see the
 world's most famous aces competing against one another."

 She takes a deep drag and lets the smoke curl slowly from her lips
 before speaking.  "I just want to make sure you know I won't hold back,
 just because it's you."

 You laugh.  "You're not going to get a chance to.  You'll have to be
 flat out just to be able to spot me on the horizon."

 She holds out her hand and you take it.  "May the best woman win," she
 says.

 "May she come second, after me," you counter.

 There's a moment's pause.  The quiet sounds of evening drift in through
 an open window.

 "Lucas..."  Imelda takes a deep breath.  "There's something I need to
 ask you.  After the race, what... what's going to happen?"

 "Easy," you say.  "I go where you go.  As always."

 She smiles.  "That's going to be difficult.  I'll be going where you're
 going.  We'll be chasing one another in circles."

 "Like dogfighting all over again."

 She kisses the corner of your mouth.  "I love you."

 You kiss her back, passionately.  "I love you too."








 Many years later...

 The champagne cork pops explosively and you both jump.

 "Careful," Imelda says, "you'll have someone's eye out."

 You pour out two glasses.  "Yes, you have to be careful in that
 regard."

 "Thank you," Imelda says, taking a glass and bringing it to her lips.

 "Hold on, we haven't had a toast yet."

 "That's easy," she says, raising her glass.  "To us.  And another
 twenty years of fucking, flying and friendship."

 "To the three 'F's," you agree, tapping your glass against hers.

 "The three 'F's."

 You take a deep breath of mountain air.  The precarious buildings of
 Aerocity surround you, glistening with frost.  "It's quite a view," you
 say, looking across the world from up high.

 "As good as flying," Imelda says.  "Almost as good as love."

 You lean together and kiss, the setting sun glinting on snow-topped
 mountains.

 Well, you finished Snowblind Aces.  But perhaps you were surprised by
 the way it turned out?

 Throughout the game you've made a number of decisions which have
 affected the way Lucas and Imelda will treat one another for the rest
 of their lives.  There are eight decisions in total, five of which
 you'll be forced to make in order to complete the game, and three more
 which you discover by talking to Imelda.  I've tried to make the game
 as simple to play through as possible, so hopefully your next action
 will be to type 'restart' and try doing things a little differently...

 It only takes a moment of inattention.  The snowstorm draws thicker and
 the faint grey silhouette of the reconnaissance plane fades away
 completely.  You bank hard, yanking on the control column with mild
 panic, but it's too late.  Your paths have diverged, unlikely to cross
 again as long as this lethal weather continues.

 The lumbering two-seater plane you were supposed to be escorting is
 alone and unprotected.  And she is out there: lightning fast, deadly
 accurate and cold as ice.  You'd consider turning back to the airbase
 right away.

 If, that is, you even knew where you were.

 Almost before you can react, a huge shape swoops out of the white void
 below: a scarlet triplane, close enough that you can see its pilot, and
 the surprised expression on her face.  You pull on the control column
 hard and punch the throttle, feeling your plane strain to rise higher.
 For an instant you think you've avoided disaster.

 And then the whole fuselage lurches, the sound of metal on metal
 scraping right into your brain as you collide glancingly with the other
 plane.  You look over your shoulder just in time to see the scarlet
 triplane disappear into the clouds, trailing thick black smoke.
 Turning back to your controls you immediately notice the epileptic
 motion of the rapidly spinning altimeter.

 It would seem that you have a problem.

 You're seated in the cockpit of your Swordfish biplane, exposed to the

 icy wind from cutting right through you, and you're surrounded on all
 sides by blinding white mist.

 The plane's control column juts up in front of you.

>jump
 You check your parachute and climb up onto your seat.  After you throw
 your leg over the side, it's surprisingly easy to push yourself away
 from the plane and leap into the mist.

 Not quite as aerodynamic as your Swordfish, you drop like a stone,
 plummeting into the murky white void below.  Ice and fog crowd close
 around you, obscuring every direction.  The only reason you know you're
 falling is because of the way your stomach seems to still be a hundred
 metres above you somewhere.  Remembering the single parachute jump you
 performed in basic training, you fumble with the chord and yank hard,
 the harness suddenly seeming to pull you upwards.

 Falling
 You're hanging from a parachute, descending slowly into a blank white
 void.  Without the sound of your plane's engine, everything seems
 shockingly silent.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 The word "xyzzy" is not necessary in this story.  Honest.

 Your plane will have hit the ground by now, shattering into pieces,
 bursting into flames.

 But you're okay.  You made it.

 Taking back one turn: "shoot me".

>shoot me
 You miss.

 The hard part is over.

>open chute
 Which chute do you mean, the parachute pack, or the parachute canopy?

>canopy
 The parachute canopy is too far away.

 The mist beneath you parts.  Below you are thick, evergreen trees,
 garnished with snow, clinging to sharp black rocks.

 Now you have a frame of reference, you realise just how fast you're
 falling.








 You open your eyes.  You feel remarkably well given the circumstances.
 The air is fresh and invigorating, the sound of birdsong and rustling
 leaves is like soothing music.  Time to get moving - for all you know,
 you might be behind enemy lines.

 Forest Clearing (lying on the ground)
 Snow-coated evergreen trees surround you on all sides, their roots
 tangling into rugged black rocks.  Snow falls from the bright white sky
 above.

 The canopy of your parachute is suspended in the branches of a tree,
 like a giant, tattered spider's web.

>examine pack
 A bulky backpack that will let you descend gracefully to the ground.

 A bird chirrups melodically.

>search it
 There's nothing unusual in the parachute pack.

 You hear snow crunching nearby.  Probably nothing.

>open it
 That is not something you can open.

 An icy breeze passes through the clearing, the soft rustling of leaves
 following in its wake.

>remove it
 Okay, you're no longer wearing the parachute pack.

 You hear snow crunching nearby.  Probably nothing.

>examine me
 You're Lucas Thane: daredevil fighter ace, knight of the air.

 An icy breeze passes through the clearing, the soft rustling of leaves
 following in its wake.

>examine leg
 Yep, one functional left leg.  Good for standing on and walking with.

>right leg
 The word "right" is not necessary in this story.

>broken leg
 The word "broken" is not necessary in this story.

>jump
 Just as soon as you're standing on the ground.

>examine right leg
 The word "right" is not necessary in this story.

>stand
 You sit up, feeling a lot weaker than you thought you were.  As you
 start to shift your legs, something inside your left calf moves.  White
 lightning bolts of pain jolt across your vision and you collapse back
 with a scream of pain.

 You've broken your leg.  You're lying in the freezing snow, and you're
 not going anywhere.

>examine pack
 A worthless piece of crap that couldn't slow down a feather in an
 updraft.

 You hear something rustling among the trees.

>shoot me
 You miss.

 A feral icekin blunders into the clearing, looking around with its
 empty black eyes.  Probably attracted by your scream of pain.  Nice
 going, Lucas.

>SAVE
>cf4
 Saved.

>z.z.z
 Time passes...

 The icekin looks around, breathing heavily through its sharp, uneven
 teeth.

 Time passes...

 The icekin fixes its lifeless black eyes on you, emitting a low growl.

 Time passes...

 The icekin lumbers towards you.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The icekin raises its furry white paw.  The jagged edge of the rusty
 blade is brought into sharp relief against the white mists above.

>wait
 Time passes...

 A loud report shatters the quiet, resounding through the forest.
 Flocks of black birds rise in flurries from the trees.  The icekin
 sways slightly on the spot, its blank expression shifting to one of
 vague confusion.  And then it slumps to the ground, almost as if
 falling suddenly asleep.

 A dark figure strides into the clearing, a smoking flare gun in her
 hand.  She lets it fall to the snow and rests a hand on her hip,
 surveying you with her one good eye.  "So," she says.  "It's you.  I
 imagine your plane fared as badly as mine."

 You smile in spite of the pain.  "And it's you.  Aiding and abetting
 the enemy.  What a poor example of patriotism."

 "I'm a mercenary, Lucas, and you're not really one to talk yourself,
 are you?"  She pauses and sighs.  "After all this time," she says
 softly, "here we are.  Face to face on the ground.  It's..."  She
 trails off.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 (You could tell her it feels like you already know her, or play it
 cool.)

>shoot imelda
 You could never!  Well, if you were both in planes, certainly.  Quite
 frequently in fact.  But not face to face!

 An awkward silence hangs between the two of you.

>play it cool
 You offer her a cordial smiles.  "It's a pleasure to meet you,
 Baroness."

 She laughs.  "Imelda.  Just call me Imelda.  Come on, we need to get to
 shelter."

>ask imelda about shelter
 Imelda looks around apprehensively.  "Actually, I think we should get
 moving rather than hang around chatting.  The snowfall's getting
 thicker all the time."

 "I'm not going anywhere," you say.  "I think my leg's broken."

 She kneels down by your side.  "Let me take a look."

 "Be sure to look twice as long," you advise her, "since you just have
 the one eye."

 She purses her lips.  "You're right.  I'll do that."

 "Ow!"

 "Yeah, it's broken alright."

 "Thanks, doctor."

 "I'll have to see about making a splint.  And then I guess you'll have
 to lean on me, if you don't mind."

 "Anything to help you feel useful."

 Downed Triplane (lying on the ground)
 A scarlet triplane lies half-buried in the snow, leaning to one side.
 You're huddled beneath its slanting wing, mostly sheltered from the
 freezing wind and falling snow.

 Imelda is huddled close by your side.

 "It's getting dark," Imelda says.  "We'll have to stay here at least
 for tonight, and then move on tomorrow morning if the weather lets up."

>ask imelda about fire
 You meet Imelda's eye and she looks at you expectantly.

 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

 Your breath leaves little clouds in the air.

>ask imelda about warmth
 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

 You rub your hands together to try to keep them warm.

>ask imelda about keeping warm
 You chat briefly with Imelda, but find out nothing important.

>ask imelda about imelda
 "So..." you begin, "why not tell me a little about yourself, Imelda?"

 Imelda looks thoughtful.  "I suppose... it's a bit of a broad topic.
 Tell you what, why don't we start with you telling me about myself."

 "You want me to tell you about yourself?" you repeat.  "Don't you
 already know yourself quite well?"

 "I'm interested to know what you think of me.  Come on, tell me."

>I think you suck
 The word "think" is not necessary in this story.

>tell imelda about imelda
 You take a deep breath.  "Okay.  You're the notorious ace Sky Mercenary
 known as the Scarlet Baroness, real name Imelda von Strassa- von
 Strassenba-"

 "Von Strassenbach."

 "Who's telling this story?  Imelda von Strassenbach.  A fiery redhead
 with an ice cold temperament."

 "More than my temperament is ice cold at the moment."

 "You've racked up over seventy confirmed kills-"

 "Seventy-six."

 "You're an outstanding pilot, who can best even the most elite southern
 pilots, and you're hopelessly in love, according to the scandal sheets,
 with one Lucas Thane, the Benevolent Empire's ace of aces."

 Imelda seems happy with your little report.  "Is that so," she purrs.
 "Although: hopelessly in love, pursuing in a predatory fashion... it's
 a thin line, I think."

>topics
 You could ask her about your predicament, the Swordfish biplane, the
 Thunderbolt triplane, the feral icekin, the Benevolent Empire, herself,
 newspapers, ace of aces, her eyepatch, her kill count, or her hair.

>ask imelda about thunderbolt
 You look over your shoulder at the fuselage of Imelda's plane.  "So,
 you think you're too good for just two wings, then?"

 "Rate of climb," she says assuredly.  "Gaining and losing height will
 win and lose dogfights for you.  Three wings give you the capability to
 climb at an incredible rate.  And when you roll, that translates to
 maneuvrability in any direction.  I know there's pilots who like
 durability or speed, but to me, nothing beats being able to turn to
 constantly keep your guns on an opponent, especially if they're also
 struggling to keep their nose up."

 You make an ambiguous noise.  "Sounds like it might be alright for
 some, I suppose."

 Imelda looks at you, fixedly.  "After the war, I'll put you in the
 pilot's seat of one of these things, and you'll see just what I mean."

>ask imelda about swordfish
 "I hear the Swordfish has a pretty good reputation on the other side of
 the lines."

 Imelda suppresses a smile.  "It kick-started development of the
 Thunderbolt triplane, I'll give it credit for that."

>ask imelda about predicament
 "This is quite a situation we're in," you say.

 "Yep," Imelda agrees.

 "Any idea what to do?"

 Imelda tips her head to one side.  "Maybe."

 "Care to share?"

 "Well, as I see it, we have two main problems.  We need to get to
 safety tomorrow, and we need to keep warm."

>ask imelda about safety
 "I was thinking," you tell Imelda.

 "Did it hurt?" she asks.

 "A little.  Mostly it was just an unfamiliar sensation.  What I was
 thinking was that we should head south from here.  We'll probably reach
 the Imperial lines in no time.  After that, a hot bath, some steaming
 soup..."

 Imelda seems unconvinced.  "Or we could head north.  We'll probably
 reach the Northern lines in no time, after which etcetera, etcetera."

 You draw a breath through your teeth.  "I'm not sure I want to end up a
 prisoner of those icekin soldiers."

 "You won't be a prisoner of the icekin soldiers.  You'll be my
 prisoner."

 "Sounds a bit kinky for my tastes."

 Imelda smiles slyly.  "You have no idea."

 "Maybe we should just split up," you suggest.  "I bet we could both
 make it by ourselves.  Then no-one has to be anyone's prisoner."

 Imelda bites her lip.  "I think we should stay together.  At the least
 you need someone to lean on.  If you aggravate your broken leg you
 might end up severing an artery or something..."

 (You could agree to go north with her, ask her to go south with you,
 tell her you should split up, or tell her you can't decide.)

>ask imelda to go south
 Imelda refuses your request.

 Snow continues to drift down from above.

>ask imelda about benevolent empire
 "You're surely a fan of the Benevolent Empire and its attempts to
 civilise the world?"

 Imelda scoffs.  "It's hard to consider an empire benevolent when it
 thinks that rearranging the world to suit its own economic needs is
 'civilising' it."

 "You don't think the people of the Northern Territories would benefit
 from giving us all their noxious petroleum?"

 "I think they've benefited best by giving it to us Sky Mercenaries."

 A chill wind passes under the wing, making you both shiver.

 "By the way," Imelda says, "why exactly did you feel the need to fly
 into me?"

 "That's funny," you reply.  "I thought that you were the one who flew
 into me."

 The triplane rocks slightly in the wind.

>ask imelda about safety
 "About where we're headed..." you begin.

 "Have you reached a decision yet?"  Imelda asks you.

 A chill wind passes under the wing, making you both shiver.

 (You could agree to go north with her, ask her to go south with you,
 tell her you should split up, or tell her you can't decide.)

>tell her we should split up

>tell her you should split up
 "We're still technically enemies," you say.  "We'll just have to go our
 separate ways."

 Imelda shakes her head.  "No, I can't leave you limping through the
 snow on a broken leg.  Look, if you really want me to, I'll go south
 with you.  But I'd much rather you came north with me."

 (You could agree to go north with her, ask her to go south with you,
 tell her you should split up, or tell her you can't decide.)

>ask imelda to go south
 Imelda refuses your request.

 Your breath leaves little clouds in the air.

>ask imelda about tiger sauce
 "Have you ever had Tiger Sauce?" you ask.

 Imelda looks puzzled.  "You mean sauce made from tigers?"

 "I think it's tiger milk, actually."

 She turns her nose up.  "No thanks."

 "Oh, you'd be surprised."

 (You could agree to go north with her, ask her to go south with you,

>ask her to go south with you
 "I think you should come south with me," you say.  "The Benevolent
 Empire always treats its prisoners well, and I have plenty of clout.
 We'd be able to spend quite a bit of time together."

 Imelda looks a bit conflicted for a moment.  And then she nods.  "Okay.
 I've looked after you for a while, now maybe it's your turn.  I won't
 be sorry to leave the war behind, either.  So, yes, let's go south."

 The triplane rocks slightly in the wind.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>SAVE
>cf5
 Saved.

>ask imelda about keeping warm
 "I've got an idea to keep us warm," you tell Imelda.

 She takes a break from breathing into her hands.  "Sounds great to me.
 What is it?"

 (You could suggest thinking warm thoughts, suggest sharing body heat,
 or suggest making a fire.)

>suggest making a fire
 You look around.  "I think we could build a fire.  If we put it right
 there it should be close enough to warm us up, but the wind will blow
 the smoke away from us."

 Imelda crawls out from under the wing and stands up, snow crunching
 beneath her feet.  "Okay, I'll go find some wood, or anything else that
 looks like it'll burn.  Give me your gun.  I'd hate to have to face
 down a feral icekin with nothing but a couple of pine branches."

 (You could agree, or politely refuse.)

>refuse
 "I'm sorry," you tell her, "it's not that I don't trust you, it's
 just..."

 Imelda nods.  "It's just that we're both, technically, enemies.  I
 understand."

 You go to say more, but she turns around and scampers off, her
 footsteps crunching in the snow.








 Time passes slowly while Imelda is gone.  You feel yourself growing
 sleepy, and the feeling leaves your hands and feet.  Only the dull pain
 in your broken leg keeps you awake.








 You snap back to reality as something approaches, trudging quickly
 through the frost.  Before you have time to consider what to do if it
 turns out to be a dangerous creature, Imelda appears in front of you
 and dumps an armful of branches and sticks into the snow.

 "Gods it's cold," she announces, throwing herself onto all fours and
 crawling back under the wing.  She curls up right next to you,
 shivering, and you obligingly wrap your arms around her to help warm
 her up.  Not entirely a selfless act, as you're pretty cold yourself.

 "Okay," Imelda says after a while.  "Got to try and turn this ugly heap
 of sticks into a nice fire..."

 You rub your hands together to try to keep them warm.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 (You could let her get on with it, or tell her you can do better.)

>tell her you can do better
 You shift your broken leg so that you can grab a couple of sticks from
 the pile.  "I think the Boy Scouts need to take over here," you tell
 Imelda.

 She gives you a very doubtful look.  "Excuse me?  The Sky Guides are
 more than capable of rubbing two sticks together.  Unless you can think
 of a way an all-male group might have gained extra practice in that
 regard?"

 "Clearly you don't have enough confidence in your abilities to just get
 on with it."

 "I'm just trying to get you to save your energy."

 You both tend to the sticks in intense silence from then on.  But the
 fire doesn't suddenly spark to life, it forms slowly from a wisp of
 smoke, and it's hard to tell which of you is more responsible for it.
 When it's crackling away nicely, you both sit back,
 shoulder-to-shoulder.

 "I told you to save your energy," Imelda says.  "That was clearly my
 spark that lit it."

 You shake your head.  "My sparks were much more vibrant.  You could
 tell they had the Lucas Thane never-give-up attitude."

 "Fine, keep lying to yourself.  We both know the truth."

 "I agree that one of us is in denial, but I don't think it's me."

 Imelda holds out her hands to the fire.  "It's nice that we got it
 done, though."

 You hold out your own hands.  "I don't dispute that."

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>kiss imelda
 You're not about to kiss the enemy without at least a hint that she'd
 like you to.

 Snow continues to drift down from above.

>ask imelda about love
 You clear your throat.  "So, Imelda, how are things with the men in
 your life?"

 "Do you mean my male friends among the Sky Mercenaries?  Or are you
 sneakily trying to ask about us?"

 You rub your hands together to try to keep them warm.

>ask imelda about us
 "Imelda, about us..."

 She looks down at her feet.  "What about us?"

 "Well, what's your take on it?  Why do we keep circling around one
 another?  In the air or otherwise."

 Still without looking at you, she says, "I can't really remember how we
 first met, except that I suddenly realised this plane from the 5th
 Imperial Air Squadron kept seeking me out to duel with me, probably
 because I'm an obvious target in my scarlet plane.  I usually brought
 down every enemy plane I came across, but you always managed to escape.
 I only shot you down that once.  I started to research you, found out
 who you were, started to learn your flying style, had a chance to kill
 you, but didn't take it, and then flew into you in the middle of a
 snowstorm.  And now here we are."

 There's a pause, and then she adds, "But that's not what you asked,
 really, is it?  That's just the story of us - I didn't mention my
 feelings at all."  She smiles apologetically.

>ask imelda about feelings
 "So what are your feelings for me?"

 Imelda remains strangely silent, just looks at you with an ambiguous
 expression.  If you want to press the matter, perhaps you should tell
 her about your feelings.

>tell imelda about your feelings
 You cough.  "Imelda, I just wanted to say that..."

 (You could tell her you're in love with her, or tell her she's like
 your best friend.)

>tell imelda you're in love with her
 The story doesn't understand that command.  Please use ASK ACTOR ABOUT
 TOPIC (or just A TOPIC).

>tell her you're in love with her
 You decide to just say it.  You don't even look at her.  "Imelda, I'm
 in love with you."

 She refrains from looking at you either.  "I'm in love with you too,"
 she states, matter-of-factly.  "It makes perfect sense, I think.  We're
 young, we're forced to deal with one another repeatedly in intense,
 passionate, but graceful and playful circumstances, we understand the
 stresses, the fears we each experience, we both love flying... and so
 we grow attracted to one another."

 The two of you lean closer as she speaks, your lips brushing together.
 "My lips are numb," you complain.

 She shushes you.  "Let me warm them up."

 After a while, you lean back, faces flushed, sitting perhaps a little
 closer than before.

 Imelda straightens her hair and exhales slowly.  "That was almost as
 satisfying as shooting you down."

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>hug imelda
 You wrap your arms around Imelda and squeeze her tightly.

 "Why Lucas," she says wryly, hugging you back, "you must contain your
 obvious desire for me."

 "I'm just trying to keep warm," you reply.

 "Yes, keep telling yourself that."

>ask imelda about keeping warm
 You hold your hands out to the fire.  "This is nice."

 "Yes," Imelda agrees, "my fingers don't feel quite ready to snap off
 anymore."

>hug imelda
 You wrap your arms around Imelda and squeeze her tightly.

 "Why Lucas," she says wryly, hugging you back, "you must contain your

 A chill wind passes under the wing, making you both shiver.

 You lean over to Imelda and kiss her on the lips.  She kisses you back,
 forcefully.

 "Yes," Imelda agrees, "we should take up chess or ballroom dancing

 The triplane rocks slightly in the wind.

>ask imelda about what she's doing after the war
 "Aside from sticking me in a triplane, you got any plans for after this
 all blows over?"

 Imelda scratches her ear.  "I don't know.  I really don't know.  I went
 straight from aristocracy to being a fighter pilot.  This is
 preferable, believe it or not.  But you'd have to be insane to want to
 do this forever.  Or maybe I am insane, I don't know.  I just don't

 "Not when I'm this cold," Imelda says.  "But I learnt ballroom dancing
 when I was young.  I can be as graceful on my feet as in the air."

 "We'll have to dance some time," you suggest.

 "Certainly," she says mischievously, "but I warn you, my hands have
 been known to wander."

>sleep
 You let your head rest on Imelda's shoulder, and sleep descends like a
 dark blanket.

 The night is cold, and the two of you cling to one another for warmth,
 but the snow has finally stopped falling and the fire burns until
 morning.

 Then the two of you struggle to your feet, Imelda just contending with
 aches and cramps while you have to worry about your broken leg.
 Looking around at the pristine forest, everything covered in thick
 sheets of snow, you begin to make your way south, Imelda encouraging
 you to lean on her as much as you can.  Eventually, the bright scarlet
 wingtip of her triplane has disappeared from view.








 Not long after that...

 The guard shoots you a black look, but you show him your authorisation
 and he unlocks the door.  Inside, Imelda sits at a table, looking
 thoroughly bored.

 "Lucas," she sighs.  "Things are looking up."

 "I'm really sorry for this," you tell her.  "It seems the intelligence
 services can do what they want and there's nothing we can do about it.
 They treated you well, at least?"

 "They accepted it when I refused to answer their questions, yes.  The
 northern ace of aces is out of action, if they beat me up, their own
 ace of aces will probably follow suit.  I don't think they're really
 that interested in getting information out of me, to be honest.  It
 seemed like a formality.  A boring, boring formality."

 You take a deep breath and then say, "They're prepared to put you under
 house arrest in a nice little town not too far south of here."

 "And how often will I see you?"

 "As often as I can make the journey."

 "Will you..."  She clears her throat.  "Will you be able to stay the
 night?"

 "If I bribe the right guard, I should think so."

 She grins carnivorously.  "Well, that's the important thing."

 "I'm sorry for this."

 She smiles.  "It's okay, I know it's not your fault."








 Years later...

 Imelda rolls off of you and sparks up a cigarette, the sheets around
 her hips.  You study her silhouette in the twilight.

 "The air race tomorrow," she says.

 "Everyone will be there," you say proudly.  "Everyone wants to see the
 world's most famous aces competing against one another."

 She takes a deep drag and lets the smoke curl slowly from her lips
 before speaking.  "I don't like the way you take so many risks to try
 and beat me.  You could die."

 You laugh.  "You just want to make sure you win."

 She shoots you a fierce look.  "I'm not joking."

 "Okay, I know, Mel, I know."

 You rest your hand reassuringly on her leg.  "Maybe we should pack in
 the daredevil flying anyway.  It's for the young and carefree, people
 with nothing to lose.  Whereas we're..."

 She places her hand on top of yours."We have one another."

 You nod.  "But still, the race tomorrow..."

 Imelda laughs.  "You're going to do great," she says.  "You'll be
 finishing second.  Right after me."

 "We'll see."

 There's a moment's pause.  The quiet sounds of evening drift in through
 an open window.

 "Lucas..."  Imelda takes a deep breath.  "There's something I need to
 ask you.  After the race, what... what's going to happen?"

 "I..."  You shake your head.

 She looks at you sadly.  "Yeah, you never did let that barrier drop.  I
 guess it's too much to imagine that people who've tried to kill one
 another could ever end up being too close."

 "I will miss you," you tell her.

 She kisses the corner of your mouth.

 You slip your arm around her and kiss her back.








 Many years later...


 "Oh my god, Lucas Thane it is you"

 You spin around and find yourself facing a strangely familiar redheaded
 woman.  "Imelda?  Is that you?  You look so different!"

 She touches her fingers to her cheeks.  "It's the glass eye.  No-one
 from back then recognises me anymore."

 "That's terrible," you say, "I thought the eye patch really suited
 you."

 "Well, it doesn't help much to look like a pirate when you're designing
 planes."

 "Monoplanes, eh?  Who'd have thought it?"

 "I know!  Look, you've got to come round some time, reminisce about old
 times."

 "Sounds like a plan."

 "Are you still the dashing bachelor of legend?"

 You look thoughtfully at the sky.  "Oh, you know how it is.  You meet a
 lot of people, but they never match up to the one that got away."

 She looks at you thoughfully.  "You're a stupid bastard, Lucas Thane,"
 she says softly.

 You just stare at her.

 She points a thumb over her shoulder.  "My place is this way.  Come
 on."

 Uncertain what to expect, you take her hand.

 "It was the practice of German aces to visit the site of their
 opponent's crash in order to confirm their combat report and only the
 final question concerned [Oswald] Boelcke - would his own death be
 'fercht oder getrocknet' (literally 'wet or dry', that is burned or
 mutilated to death)."  Alan Clark, Aces High

 The idea of a notorious fighter ace called the Scarlet Baroness is
 obviously inspired by the Red Baron of the First World War - Manfred
 von Richthofen, an aristocratic hunter turned fighter pilot.
 Richthofen is an interesting character in his own right, clocking up 80
 confirmed kills (perhaps dispproportionately of vulnerable two-seater
 planes), he was often depicted (either flatteringly or unflatteringly)
 as a callous and cold man who considered shooting down enemy planes to
 be no different from hunting animals.

 Although there may well have been such an aspect to him, like most of
 the fighter pilots of that era he had a great respect and understanding
 for enemy pilots.  In the common practice of landing by downed planes
 to confirm the kill (or in Richthofen's case, to collect a trophy),
 pilots from opposite sides might well end up conversing.  Captured
 enemy pilots, whether dead or alive, would always be treated with
 respect and courtesy by their opposing squadrons.  (It was whilst
 talking to one captured allied pilot that Richthofen learnt of the
 rumour that he (the ace in the red plane) was a woman.)

 And yet, despite the common depiction of WWI fighter aces as being the
 knights of the air, their affinity for one another was probably most
 inspired by a common understanding of the brutality of their conflict.
 Pilots were given almost no training.  New members of the Royal Flying
 Corps were called 'twenty minuters' with respect to their expected
 lifespan.  Senseless waste of lives was as common in the air as in the
 trenches.  Unlike in the world of Snowblind Aces, pilots were never
 issued parachutes - it was considered that this would merely enable
 cowardice.

 Lucas Thane, depending on how you play him, is a mixture of two of the
 top three French aces.  Charles Nungesser was the quintessential
 daredevil ace, who would crawl into his plane after a night out
 drinking and partying, perform death defying stunts, crash, break all
 his bones, and still crawl into the plane again the next day.  After
 the war, he continued to risk his life in the air, and disappeared
 during an attempted transatlantic crossing.

 Georges Guynemer, on the other hand, managed to become a pilot inspite
 of his youth and ill health.  He was relatively shy and unassuming,
 prone to truly anachronistic acts of chivalry towards the enemy.  As
 the war dragged on, Guynemer's physical and mental health began to
 deteriorate.  A national hero, Guynemer was expected by his superiors
 and the public to continue to risk his life in combat.  He refused to
 retire, afraid of what would be said of him, and was eventually
 presumed killed in an ambush one overcast morning - though his body was
 never found.

 Despite Imelda's insistence to the contrary, the triplane was - in our
 universe, anyway - by and large a failed experiment.  The British
 Sopwith Triplane and German Fokker Dr1. were both hugely successful,
 living up to the intended 'increased maneuvrability, reduced speed' of
 the design, but a plethora of other triplanes have justifiably
 disappeared into the mists of history, remembered only as peculiar
 mutants.

 As a final note, if you find yourself in the Northern Territories these
 days and are attacked by a feral icekin, please remember that they are
 endangered, so you should probably let it eat you.
