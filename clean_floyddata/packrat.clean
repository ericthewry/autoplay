 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 They call you Packrat, but in truth, you're an adventurer with a
 discerning eye. After all, who're they sending to wake the Princess?
 Many's the prince who didn't even try to penetrate the cursed brambles
 about the castle, and though the thorns finally parted for some royal
 pup from a faraway land, no one's heard a thing since.

 Worse, it's just come out that the King had time before going
 unconscious to take out a hefty royal loan, and it's had twenty years
 to accrue in default. The rumor is that the repo giants are on their
 way. If someone doesn't wake up the Princess and the rest of the
 royals pronto, the whole kingdom might come under new management.  Who
 better to send on a dangerous mission to a sleeping castle full of
 unguarded loot than ...

 Path through Brambles
 Brambles bristle eight feet high on either side. They seem to give you
 a penetrating glare. The thorns have grudgingly pulled apart to make a
 narrow path leading north; one would think the curse would have
 included a post-Prince closure clause, but you're not complaining.

 You can see a broken beerstein here.

>examine stein
 A discarded tin beerstein! You've been thinking about starting a
 collection. But ... it's a bit deep in the brambles ... and you do
 have a lot in your pack ... maybe you'd best leave it alone.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a battered pack (being worn and closed)

>open pack
 You open the battered pack, revealing a faux brass lantern, a doorknob
 collection, a trusty rope, a discarded sleeve and a blanket.

>examine lantern
 You got this for half price because it's a Commemorative Collectible
 for the Featherby Tournament '38, modeled on the remarkable profile of
 Sir Bellamy Flab--that's why you got it, not why it was half price.
 You left the other four '38 Commemoratives at home; this one actually
 lights.

>examine collection
 Somehow you thought you would have time to sort them. But you never
 know when a spare doorknob might save your life.

>examine rope
 What adventurer worthy of the name would ever leave home without it?
 There's nothing like Grade A Lifetime Guaranteed Certified Adventurer
 Rope. Which is why it's so expensive. And why this is actually a spare
 clothesline.

>examine sleeve
 You got a real bargain on this baby, and one of these days, you're
 going to find a matching chartreuse velvet detachable left-handed
 sleeve.

 You don't particularly like the pattern, but it was a 'two for one,'
 and there's a good chance that that shade of mauve is going to come
 back in style some time. Or that plaid.

>examine blanket
 You don't particularly like the pattern, but it was a 'two for one,'
 and there's a good chance that that shade of mauve is going to come
 back in style some time. Or that plaid.


 Drawbridge
 The drawbridge is rather in need of repair. To the north, the castle
 sits sleepily in the orange afternoon sun. To the south, shadows
 nearly hide the path through the brambles.

>examine bridge
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine drawbridge
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine castle
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine shadows
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine moat
 Rare is the moat that does justice to the term "brackish". The slight
 current is just sufficient to keep the brack well-churned.


 Vestibule
 Even though strewn with autumn leaves, rat droppings, and six
 varieties of moss, the Vestibule evokes awe. The fine oriental rug
 will command respect when de-mushroomed, and the Grand Staircase nobly
 awaits repair. Still, it's a shame they left the door open.  You can
 go north to the Great Hall, south through the open portcullis to the
 drawbridge, east through an imposing door or west to an intimidating
 hallway.

>search leaves
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine rug
 It's so impossibly expensive you're afraid to look for too long.

>move rug
 You are unable to.

>roll rug
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine mushroom
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine portcullis
 You can't see any such thing.

>take rug
 That's hardly portable.


 Great Hall: south end
 The Great Hall yawns before you, a gargantuan indoor plain. Around an
 acre or so of oaken table sleeps a cornucopia of noblemen, noblewomen,
 and their attendant parasites. You can try to go in almost any
 direction, but your gaze is irresistably drawn north to the high
 throne.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine people
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine table
 They must have built the hall around it.

>look under table
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine noblemen
 You dare not disturb their privileged slumber. You owe some of them
 money.

 Their dress is almost as extravagant as their patrons. The longer you
 look, the more you evaluate your career choice.


 Great Hall: north end
 Here the table ends humbly at the High Throne, on which are seated the
 unconscious monarchs.

 You can see a western window, an eastern window and a kitchen boy
 here.

>examine boy
 The poor lad must have just opened the great window when he pitched
 forward onto the stone sill in this cursed slumber. Twenty years of
 snow and rain have fallen on his shivering body.

>examine throne
 High. Gold. Very. The High Throne backs against the northern wall.

>examine kind
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine king
 You see nothing special about the somnolent monarchs.

>examine princess
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine monarchs
 You see nothing special about the somnolent monarchs.

>examine window
 Which do you mean, the western window or the eastern window?

>eastern
 The eastern stained-glass window shimmers cool greens and blues in the
 indirect afternoon sun, spring maples and the sacred blue lake by
 which the host of Miv was acknowledged champion by the forces of
 Caesm, yet both agreed to share the land in peace.

>western
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine western
 The setting sun inflames the stained glass, a red riot of fall oaks
 and the blood of the Battle of the Srotide. The sill is deep, for the
 walls of the North Hall are more than two feet thick.

>move throne
 Who are you to touch the Throne?

>push throne
 Who are you to touch the Throne?

>look under throne
 You find nothing of interest.

>search throne
 You find nothing of interest.

>move boy
 It is fixed in place.

>move kings
 You can't see any such thing.

>move monarchs
 You can wake them after you rescue their daughter, how about that?

 hallway.

>go west

 Intimidating Hallway
 You've never seen a hall inlaid with mother-of-pearl before. The hall
 continues west, the Vestibule lies east, and a sumptuous guest room
 lies south.

>go south

 Guest Room
 The finery of this guest room is at least Ducal, if not Stewardly.
 Perhaps you'd better go north, to the hall.

>go north

 Intimidating Hallway

>verbose
 Packrat is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long
 descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>go west

 More Intimidating Hallway
 The hall ends here. You can go east down the hallway or south into
 another guest room.

 You can see a laundry chute (which is closed) here.

>SAVE

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go south

 Guest Room
 This guest room has suffered at the hands of a single-minded
 decorator. Someone in this castle is fond of teal. That's clear.

 You can see an oversized teak chest and a Castle Guard here.

>examine guard
 He wears the green and gold livery of the Castle, complete with
 important-looking insignia and keyring.

>examine guard
 He wears the green and gold livery of the Castle, complete with

>get keys
 That was too easy.

>examine keyring
 Two sets of three identical keys dangle from a cheap brass ring. It's
 a shame you don't collect keys. Yet.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a keyring
   a battered pack (being worn and open)
     a faux brass lantern (providing light)
     a doorknob collection
     a trusty rope
     a discarded sleeve
     a blanket

>examine insignia
 "Dungeon Sub-Warder Third Class"

>examine chest
 The teak chest in the teal room overflows with a glittering pile of
 pantaloons. You are something of a pantaloon conossieur, and your
 heart beats faster at the prospect of pawing through a pile of
 pantaloons unobserved. Unfortunately, the same thought seems to have
 occurred to the guard, and he sleeps with both fists buried in
 slightly outdated seawear.

>examine pantaloons
 A glittering pile of slightly outdated seawear.

>move guard
 There's always the chance he might wake up.

>wake guard
 That seems unnecessary.

>search pantaloons
 You find pantaloons.

>move pantaloons
 You have better things to do. I promise.

>smell pantaloons
 You smell nothing unexpected.

>go north

 More Intimidating Hallway
 The hall ends here. You can go east down the hallway or south into
 another guest room.

 You can see a laundry chute (which is closed) here.

>open chute
 You open the laundry chute.

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine chute
 An old laundry chute is embedded in the western wall. Though the
 wooden handle is mere maple, the design is subtly ostentatious;
 perhaps it's even been touched by the occasional nobleman.

>look in chute
 The laundry chute is empty.

>enter chute
 That's not something you can enter.

 You can't go that way.

>go east

 Games Room
 Here the nobility were wont to amuse themselves with diversions such
 as billiards, indoor badminton, and indoor water polo. Unfortunately,
 a bored giant has swooped all this, as well as a portion of the
 eastern wall, into a pile of rubble.

>examine rubble
 You see only rubble: bent rackets, broken billiard balls, a smashed
 bronze polo tank. The debris is heaped against what's left of the
 eastern wall, completely blocking your path. Much of the wall itself
 has been destroyed, leaving a three-foot high gap under the ceiling
 which opens into some other room.

>examine gap
 The wall is mostly gone, and the debris reaches to within three feet
 of the ceiling.

>enter gap
 It's at the top of a seven-foot high pile of angular debris.

>climb debris
 You can't see any such thing.

>go up
 You can't go that way.

 You try to scale the mountain, but slip and nearly impale yourself on

 This door features mere rose quartz, but it appears to be slightly
 open.

>open quartz
 Which do you mean, the western door or the jewel?

>open rose door
 You can't see any such thing.

>open western door
 A worthy thought. You widen the crack by one-sixteenth of an inch.
 Until you stop pushing.

>examine eastern door
 The door is locked.

 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>go up
 You jump. The ceiling is probably forty feet up.

>go down
 The floor looks solid.

>examine painting
 It looks like an authentic Mushentwaddle. It's got to be more than
 twenty feet high, and thirty feet wide. Oh, for a real Mushentwaddle
 to hang on your own...exterior wall. Well. It would be taller than the
 house.

>unlock sapphire-studded door with key
 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>look behind painting
 You can't see any such thing.

>take painting
 Don't joke.

>move painting
 The last thing the king needs to wake up to is a broken Mushentwaddle.

 Until you stop pushing.

 Though you cannot see them, you have it on good authority that a
 thriving community of crocodiles calls this moat home.


>go down
 From what you've heard, crocodiles tend to be territorial, hungry, or
 both.

 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

 Path through Brambles
 Brambles bristle eight feet high on either side. They seem to give you
 a penetrating glare. The thorns have grudgingly pulled apart to make a
 narrow path leading north; one would think the curse would have
 included a post-Prince closure clause, but you're not complaining.

 You can see a broken beerstein here.

>take beerstein
 I know it's early on here, but I think it's time for a quick
 intervention. People don't call you the Packrat for nothing. Your pack
 is already full, and your cottage, and you're paying out a hefty pile
 of plate every month for two storage barns back home. You've been on
 plenty of adventures, and you always come home with a new pile of
 must-keep bizarro tools. The Great Cleansing and Yard Sale Gala never
 seems to come off. This is a big castle, and if you start off taking
 the beerstein, you're never going to find the Princess, let alone get
 out with your back intact.

 This dangerous act would achieve little.

>turn lantern on
 Actually, the switch is currently nonfunctional. (It was on sale.)
 Fortunately, it's on.

>lower lantern into chute
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put lantern in chute
 Carefully you lower your lantern through the chute. But you're afraid
 to let the rope out much, and when you peek through the chute, you see
 only the glare of your lantern a few feet below.

>look in chute
 In the laundry chute is a faux brass lantern.

>tie rope to sleeve
 Why would you want to tie your rope to the discarded sleeve?

 Taken.

 Look at you! You gave something away!

 Suddenly, your blood cools. You didn't have to keep the horrid blanket
 after all. Someone's actually using it.  And your pack's lighter. Lo
 and behold, you are feeling...

 Now, what was all this about a princess?

 Don't worry. The rope is already tied to the lantern.

>put lantern in chute
 Your commemorative lantern plummets to certain destruction through the
 abandoned laundry chute...but the rope holds.

 Through the chute, you glimpse your lantern dangling in darkness. A
 swarm of insects attack it, and the light flickers and dances on the
 murky water below.

 Intimidating Hallway
 You've never seen a hall inlaid with mother-of-pearl before. The hall
 continues west, the Vestibule lies east, and a sumptuous guest room
 lies south.

>go east

 Vestibule
 Even though strewn with autumn leaves, rat droppings, and six
 varieties of moss, the Vestibule evokes awe. The fine oriental rug
 will command respect when de-mushroomed, and the Grand Staircase nobly
 awaits repair. Still, it's a shame they left the door open.  You can
 go north to the Great Hall, south through the open portcullis to the
 drawbridge, east through an imposing door or west to an intimidating
 hallway.

>go south

 Drawbridge
 The drawbridge is rather in need of repair. To the north, the castle
 sits sleepily in the orange afternoon sun. To the south, shadows
 nearly hide the path through the brambles.

>examine moat
 Rare is the moat that does justice to the term "brackish". The slight
 current is just sufficient to keep the brack well-churned.

 "Crocodile": n. A man-eating animal.

 you and your destiny. I advise you to rethink your destiny.

>go east
 Okay. Real last chance.


>go east
 Aglow with interspecial trust and compassion, you leap into the murky
 water. Your forehead thuds into cold, scaly skin. The skin scrapes
 you. Ouch. That wasn't very nice...



     *** You have met your first crocodiles. ***


 In that game you scored 30 out of a possible 100, in 213 turns,
 earning you the rank of Thrift Store Phantom.

 Putting things on the crocodiles would achieve nothing.

>examine sleeve
 You got a real bargain on this baby, and one of these days, you're
 going to find a matching chartreuse velvet detachable left-handed
 sleeve.

>examine crocodiles
 The water is too brackish for you to actually see the crocodiles.
 Let's face it, crocodiles are crocodiles.

>look under drawbridge
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

 Looks good. Or would, with another sleeve. And a shirt to tie it to. I

 Path through Brambles
 Brambles bristle eight feet high on either side. They seem to give you
 a penetrating glare. The thorns have grudgingly pulled apart to make a
 narrow path leading north; one would think the curse would have
 included a post-Prince closure clause, but you're not complaining.

 You can see a broken beerstein here.

 hallway.

 You vainly attempt to purloin the grand staircase.
 Breathing heavily, you roll up the whole rug and get your shoulder
 under the thing. This is getting embarrassing.

>examine rug
 The rolled rug isn't quite so pretty now. And you rolled it so tight
 I'm not sure you're going to get it unrolled. In fact, don't bother.

 They call you Packrat, but in truth, you're an adventurer with a
 discerning eye. After all, who're they sending to wake the Princess?
 Many's the prince who didn't even try to penetrate the cursed brambles
 about the castle, and though the thorns finally parted for some royal
 pup from a faraway land, no one's heard a thing since.

 Worse, it's just come out that the King had time before going
 unconscious to take out a hefty royal loan, and it's had twenty years
 to accrue in default. The rumor is that the repo giants are on their
 way. If someone doesn't wake up the Princess and the rest of the
 royals pronto, the whole kingdom might come under new management.  Who
 better to send on a dangerous mission to a sleeping castle full of
 unguarded loot than ...

 of plate every month for two storage barns back home. You've been on
 plenty of adventures, and you always come home with a new pile of

 Look at you! You gave something away!

 Suddenly, your blood cools. You didn't have to keep the horrid blanket
 after all. Someone's actually using it.  And your pack's lighter. Lo

 The boy stirs and nestles into his pink and plaid blanket. Now he is

 Now you head north along the western side of the castle. The murky

 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

 Not only are you too far away to reach the grate, but the bars are
 each about two inches around. And iron. And embedded in the wall of
 the castle.

 The chest bobs in the foul water.

 The visible area of the grate extends about an inch above the water,
 and seven feet across. Thick iron bars form a grid of four-inch
 squares. Whatever lies on the far side, you can't it see from here.

 The chest bobs on ...

 Moat (in the floating teak chest)
 The moat leisurely inches you around the northern side of the castle,
 luxuriating in the consistent blank stare of the wall. The northern
 side, you recall, is twice as thick as the others, for within lies the
 Great Hall; the High Throne backs up against this impregnable but
 visually soporofic wall. (A brief fad in fortress architecture,
 occasioned by a successful assassination attempt through a sub-par
 interior wall.) The royal bedroom is likely on this wall as well.
 Normally, a guard would be stationed on the roof far above, eagerly on
 the watch for an assault through two feet of stone. Now, of course,
 it's absurd to think that some archer is poised up there, about to
 pick you off.

 You squint up. Good. Nothing.

 You're glad to get around to the eastern wall. Except a guard would be

 At last you reach the southern wall again. As you round the corner,
 you see a small landing carved into the stone.

>disembark
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>get on landing
 You hesitate, then crouch, then hesitate again, then thrust yourself
 from your craft. It's not your most graceful move, but you arrive at
 the landing unchewed. Your worthy chest bobs away to face the world
 alone. You're sad to see it go. Genuine teak.

 Landing
 The landing is more like an alcove, perhaps five feet across. Stone
 surrounds you; above and below, on either side. You stand only six
 inches above the water. It must be some sort of maintenance entrance,
 as you couldn't see it from the drawbridge. A short tunnel leads north
 to a featureless door.

>go north
 You can't, since the featureless door is in the way.

>open door
 You open the featureless door.

>go north

 Dungeon Lounge
 An underground lounge. In stone. A featureless southern door leads
 outside, while the thick door to the west has the usual steel slab
 construction of the entrance to a dungeon. Though the lounge is
 Spartan, perhaps, in its furnishings, anyone this close to a dungeon
 without being a permanent resident is apt to feel a certain comfort. A
 metal staircase leads up.

>go up

 Library
 Once this was a select but sumptious library. Then came giants. Rubble
 spills through a huge hole in the western wall, blocking your path
 west. A three-foot gap opens onto the next room between the ceiling
 and what's left of the western wall. Books and bookcases are strewn
 about the marble like corpses. A staircase leads down into shadows;
 from the shattered remains nearby, you can see it used to be a secret.
 Darn giants!

 At least, you hope it was giants.

 And that they're long gone.

>examine books
 You stand in a sea of violated vellum. You nearly weep.

 And yet...your bibliophilic eye notes that the most famed and precious
 volumes of this inner sanctum of the kingdom's knowledge are nowhere
 to be found. Odd.

>examine bookcases
 Most of the bookcases are prone and shattered, but one stands upright
 against the eastern wall, near the staircase.

>move bookcase
 Seized with a sudden thirst for interior decorating, you put your
 shoulder to the one undamaged bookcase and push. Wow. The bookcase is
 solid oak. You manage to shove it against what's left of the western
 wall before collapsing.

 You brace yourself for the attack and open the door. Nothing. Not one

 Dungeon Hallway
 The dungeon hallway is slick with fetid moisture. By a nearly

 In the darkest corner of the cell sits a grizzled prisoner. You can
 barely make him out in the gloom, but you can see the glint of his
 manacles, and you can smell his stench. You've no idea what his crime
 was, but the king has a reputation for letting his nobles stash
 political undesirables in the royal dungeon.

 The familiar stench of the moat greets you as it slouches along

 letting in an inch-high bar of afternoon sun. East lies the dungeon,
 and a humble servant staircase leads up.

 Your brass lantern hangs suspended from the ceiling, having come down
 in the world from a Featherby Commemorative Collectible to a killer
 buglight. The swarm of moths is so intent on the destruction of Sir
 Bellarmy that they fail to notice you.

 Kitchen
 The plush kitchen is a wonderland of cherry cabinetry, marble
 countertops, and a bewildering assortment of cast-iron gadgets that

 roast a horse, and the pantry could store provisions for a small army.

 You can see a snoring cook here.

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
 You can't go that way.

 The chest bobs in the foul water.

>enter landing
 You hesitate, then crouch, then hesitate again, then thrust yourself
 from your craft. It's not your most graceful move, but you arrive at
 the landing unchewed. Your worthy chest bobs away to face the world
 alone. You're sad to see it go. Genuine teak.

 Landing
 The landing is more like an alcove, perhaps five feet across. Stone
 surrounds you; above and below, on either side. You stand only six
 inches above the water. It must be some sort of maintenance entrance,
 as you couldn't see it from the drawbridge. A short tunnel leads north
 to a featureless door.

>go north

 Dungeon Lounge
 An underground lounge. In stone. A featureless southern door leads
 outside, while the thick door to the west has the usual steel slab
 construction of the entrance to a dungeon. Though the lounge is
 Spartan, perhaps, in its furnishings, anyone this close to a dungeon
 without being a permanent resident is apt to feel a certain comfort. A
 metal staircase leads up.

>go up

 Library
 Once this was a select but sumptious library. Then came giants. Rubble
 spills through a huge hole in the western wall, blocking your path
 west. A three-foot gap opens onto the next room between the ceiling
 and what's left of the western wall. Books and bookcases are strewn
 about the marble like corpses. A staircase leads down into shadows;
 from the shattered remains nearby, you can see it used to be a secret.
 Darn giants!

 At least, you hope it was giants.

 And that they're long gone.

>go up
 You can't go that way.

>climb bookcase
 You climb the bookcase like a ladder, crawl through the western gap,
 and tumble down the pile, narrowly missing the jagged edge of the
 bronze polo tank. Well. That wasn't so bad. But you won't be going
 back up.

 Games Room
 Here the nobility were wont to amuse themselves with diversions such
 as billiards, indoor badminton, and indoor water polo. Unfortunately,
 a bored giant has swooped all this, as well as a portion of the
 eastern wall, into a pile of rubble.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>go east
 If there ever was a door, it's behind that rubble.

>examine bookcase
 You can't see any such thing.

>go west

 Vestibule
 Even though strewn with autumn leaves, rat droppings, and six
 varieties of moss, the Vestibule evokes awe. The fine oriental rug
 will command respect when de-mushroomed, and the Grand Staircase nobly
 awaits repair. Still, it's a shame they left the door open.  You can
 go north to the Great Hall, south through the open portcullis to the
 drawbridge, east through an imposing door or west to an intimidating
 hallway.

>go south

 Drawbridge
 The drawbridge is rather in need of repair. To the north, the castle
 sits sleepily in the orange afternoon sun. To the south, shadows
 nearly hide the path through the brambles.

 You can see a battered pack (in which are a broken beerstein, a
 doorknob collection and a discarded sleeve), a keyring, a gargantuan
 chocolate cake and an enormous ruby here.

>take all
 battered pack: Taken.
 keyring: Taken.
 gargantuan chocolate cake: Taken.
 enormous ruby: Taken.
 crocodiles: That's hardly portable.
 moat: That's hardly portable.

>wear pack
 You put on the battered pack.

>put ruby and keys and cake in pack
 enormous ruby: Done.
 keyring: Done.
 gargantuan chocolate cake: Done.

>go north

 Vestibule
 Even though strewn with autumn leaves, rat droppings, and six
 varieties of moss, the Vestibule evokes awe. The fine oriental rug
 will command respect when de-mushroomed, and the Grand Staircase nobly
 awaits repair. Still, it's a shame they left the door open.  You can
 go north to the Great Hall, south through the open portcullis to the
 drawbridge, east through an imposing door or west to an intimidating
 hallway.

 Hmm. Teeth are rather expensive. And you've grown so attached to them.

 When you get home, you'll have Aunt Urba bake you a big fat honey
 cake. How does that sound?

>again
 I really wouldn't.

>again
 It's been said that sugar is a drug: refine poppy seeds, you get
 opium, refine beets, you get sugar. You decide this isn't true, and
 cut yourself a huge slice. You are then mysteriously compelled to eat
 the entire cake. As the buzz floods your blood, you collapse beside
 the snoring cook, and wait for the blues to hit...


     *** You have eaten an entire chocolate cake. ***

 Great Hall: south end
 The Great Hall yawns before you, a gargantuan indoor plain. Around an
 acre or so of oaken table sleeps a cornucopia of noblemen, noblewomen,
 and their attendant parasites. You can try to go in almost any
 direction, but your gaze is irresistably drawn north to the high
 throne.

 Kitchen
 The plush kitchen is a wonderland of cherry cabinetry, marble
 countertops, and a bewildering assortment of cast-iron gadgets that
 only a king could afford. The enormous fireplace is big enough to
 roast a horse, and the pantry could store provisions for a small army.

 You can see a snoring cook here.

 dirty jobs like pot-scrubbing, animal gutting, and tax preparing.
 There is a servant staircase, and a swinging door to the east.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>go down

 Underground Laundry
 The familiar stench of the moat greets you as it slouches along
 through this underground laundry. A grate sits low in the water,
 letting in an inch-high bar of afternoon sun. East lies the dungeon,
 and a humble servant staircase leads up.

 Your brass lantern hangs suspended from the ceiling, having come down
 in the world from a Featherby Commemorative Collectible to a killer
 buglight. The swarm of moths is so intent on the destruction of Sir
 Bellarmy that they fail to notice you.

 Intimidating Hallway
 You've never seen a hall inlaid with mother-of-pearl before. The hall
 continues west, the Vestibule lies east, and a sumptuous guest room
 lies south.

>go west

 More Intimidating Hallway
 The hall ends here. You can go east down the hallway or south into
 another guest room.

 You can see a trusty rope and a laundry chute (in which is a faux
 brass lantern) here.

>go south
 Ah, the rope is still tied to the handle. You drop the rope.

 Guest Room
 This guest room has suffered at the hands of a single-minded
 decorator. Someone in this castle is fond of teal. That's clear.

 You can see a floating teak chest (which is empty), a gigantic pile of
 pantaloons and a Castle Guard here.

 The chest bobs in the foul water.

 The Castle Guard doesn't seem interested.

 As you climb the stairs, you hear a strange snuffling and creaking and
 grunting. Rather like a very, very large creature. Close.

 Storage Room
 Once, these venerable shelves were probably packed with useful
 treasures. Now the place is a disaster area, another wasteland of
 rotting junk.

 The sounds are much louder now. And you notice that what used to be a
 door to the east is now a huge hole in the wall.

>go east

 Royal Lounge/Dragon Nest
 Here the royal family can rest undisturbed by the rabble, the
 parasites, and the debt collectors.

 Or could. Until a dragon moved in.

 Now you can barely see the lounge for the mess of his hoard. The way
 west is a complete disaster, as is the way south, where hang the upper
 remains of the Grand Staircase. But to the north, the door to the
 royal bedroom shines almost untouched.

 You can see a greedy dragon here.

>examine dragon
 You never dreamed a creature could be so foul. Rolls of fat billow
 under clanking scales as the thing wallows in its hoard. Technically,
 this is a "moderate" sized dragon. "Only" about eight feet tall, it
 couldn't actually swallow you whole, but its triple rows of teeth look
 up to the challenge.

 Its stench soaks the air, and a continuous draft of smoke leaks out
 its nostrils. Claws scrape over the treasure as it takes each piece in
 its teeth and carefully sets it in a particular pile. It's sorting.

>examine treasure
 The dragon has had a discerning eye. Jewels the size of your fist, the
 choicest books from the library, the most delicate pastries you've
 ever seen: it's taken the best of the best. Admittedly, its motor
 skills are less than could be desired, and the eclairs are somewhat
 splattered over the one extant copy of the Chronicles of Miv. Still,
 it is many years' work of many lives that lies beneath this wyrm.

 You think of the jewel-encrusted doors downstairs, and the genuine
 Mushentwaddle. This dragon isn't done here yet.

>go north
 You can't, since the royal bedroom door is in the way.

>open royal door
 I don't think the dragon would like that.

>talk to dragon
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask dragon about dragon
 There is no reply.

>give cake to dragon
 Judging from the hunk of fudge dangling from its lip, the dragon might
 appreciate your gift very much. But sugar alone isn't going to kill
 this thing that fast. And besides, you might not want to get it in
 into an eating mood.

>put doorknobs in cake
 You need to be holding the doorknob collection before you can put it
 into something else.

>take knobs
 Taken.

>put knobs in cake
 Why would you try to stick the doorknob collection into this nice
 chocolate cake?

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a doorknob collection
   a gargantuan chocolate cake
   a battered pack (being worn and open)
     a keyring
     an enormous ruby
     a broken beerstein
     a discarded sleeve

>put stein in cake
 You need to be holding the broken beerstein before you can put it into
 something else.

>take stein
 Taken.

>put stein in cake
 Why would you try to stick the broken beerstein into this nice
 chocolate cake?

>take ruby
 Taken.

>put ruby in cake
 Seized with an obscure artistic impulse, you carefully insert the
 jewel into the chocolate cake. With some judicious finger-spreading,
 the frosting soon conceals the ruby within a still gorgeous, if a bit
 convex, chocolate cake.

>give cake to dragon
 The dragon's eyes burn with greed, and he devours the cake in half a
 bite. He impales you with a hungry glare--

 --then chokes.

 And gasps and thrashes and keens.

 And crashes to the floor.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>search treasure
 Amazingly, much as you'd like to try to move a 500-pound chocolate
 spattered dragon corpse, alone, you're even more interested in finding
 the princess.

>open royal door
 You open the royal bedroom door.

>go north

 Royal Bedroom
 You stand in the inner sanctum of your kingdom. The dragon never got
 this far. Magnificent furniture stands in a perfect arrangement, an
 ethereal harmony, a still moment in a great dance around the Royal
 Bed. It seems untouched in the setting sun, exactly as it must have
 lain twenty years ago.

 You can see a spinning wheel, a sleeping prince, a crown and a
 sleeping Princess here.

>SAVE
>cf9
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine wheel
 The spinning wheel looks deceptively ordinary. Who moved it here,
 anyway? The fairy? It's hard to believe the princess even wanted to
 touch the thing.

 Although ... it does have a certain attraction ...

>examine prince
 You don't recognize the Prince, but you're not exactly a court
 regular. He is draped across an end table, his crown askew, snoring
 ... with one fist clutching the cursed spinning wheel. Oh. So. That
 would explain things, wouldn't it?

>examine crown
 The crown of the prince gleams with emeralds. It looks just your size.

>examine princess
 She lies before you ageless and beautiful, her yellow gown draped in
 graceful folds, as if she had just this minute fallen asleep.

>take crown
 Taken.

>wear it
 You put on the crown.

>wake princess
 That seems unnecessary.

>kiss princess
 Are you sure? You are wearing the prince's crown. But surely you would
 have to tell her the truth sometime. Wouldn't you?

>kiss princess
 With another man's crown glittering on your forehead, you shove the
 Prince aside and give the Princess a rather brusque kiss.

 She awakes.

 Her eyes alight on your crown. "A prince!" she coos.



 ...It turns out that behind one of those locked doors in the Great
 Hall lies more than enough money to pay off the kingdom's debts. The
 sight thereof (and the awakened Royal Army) are enough to satisfy the
 repo giants of the royal good faith.

 More importantly, and to the chagrin of the creditors, the Royal
 Lawyers had the foresight to insert an "enchantment clause" into the
 loans. Any "qualifying event" put the loans into deferment for a
 period of up to ... twenty years, at which time the lost interest
 would be calculated for the entire period. The deferment period had
 been set to end next week.

 With the unexpected loss of twenty years of fifteen percent interest
 on a government loan, the creditors experience their own financial
 difficulties, and receive the salutary experience of usury from the
 other end.

 As neither the failed Prince nor the embarrassed King are particularly
 anxious to make your true status known, the papers are quickly drawn
 up and you are retroactively declared a Prince. No one tells the
 Princess, who gleefully marries you. After all, you're a prince. On
 your honeymoon, she confides that her one great fear has always been
 that she might accidentally marry a commoner.

 Your relationship gets rocky. And life as a prince, while well-fed,
 involves a great deal more business meetings and obligatory foxhunts
 than you would have thought. At last, during an argument, you let the
 truth slip. Things get ugly.

 Fortunately, the King hears of a new scheme by the desperate creditors
 and their repo giants which would destroy Miv once and for all, and he
 knows just which "prince" to send. The situation requires the utmost
 discretion, and you prepare to leave in secret. The night you leave, a
 hooded figure appears at your side ... your wife.

 Usurers, giants, and a good chance of a painful death. It might be
 just what your marriage needs.
