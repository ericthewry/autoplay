 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 [pausing to show unread error message]








 [The game has detected that you are using a version of the "Nitfol"
 interpreter, or a display with a width less than 22 characters. The
 statusline, menu bar, and "pretty-printing" of menus have been disabled
 to improve performance under this screen model. These features can be
 re-enabled as described in the manual.]




 The indicator light switches from blue to green. The thought occurs to
 you that this is an exceptionally bad color choice for someone who,
 like you, suffers from a mild genetic deficit in the color perception
 department. However, you've been around long enough to be familiar with
 the change in hue that indicates clearance for a StreamDive.

 Your elation is such that it takes you a few seconds to respond to the
 indicator -- a critical error, though not a fatal one. You touch the
 control, and are further pleased to find that your mission hasn't been
 scrapped due to your moment of indecision. The full text of your
 mission description appears on the display...

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 This game uses version 6 of the Z-Machine. Because support for this
 format is limited, you may experience some problems in playing this
 game. The author believes that this game works best using the MS-DOS
 and Linux versions of the "Frotz" interpreter by Stefan Jokisch. Users
 of MS-DOS may find that the '-d1' option gives the optimal display. Of
 course, the game should function on any compliant Z6 interpreter.

 Some versions of the WinFrotz interpreter contain a bug which makes the
 menu display incorrectly. If you experience difficulties, the command
 'WINFROTZ' will enable a workaround to improve the display quality.

 If the menu at the bottom of your screen still does not draw correctly,
 it can be disabled via the "MENU OFF" command.

 This game supports Blorb sound effects. Sound effects are included in a
 separate file, which may not be included with this distribution. To
 hear sound on a supporting interpreter, you will need to obtain a copy
 of the Blorb resource file for this game and make it available to your
 interpreter.

 Please encourage interpreter authors to provide better support for
 version 6 games and Blorb.

 Page: 3 Overview

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page


 "Interactive fiction" is a story in which you play the main character.
 It is your own thinking and actions that determines the progress of the
 story.
 Works of interactive fiction, such as MOMENTS OUT OF TIME present a
 series of objects: rooms, items and tools, with which you can interact.
 In any location, it is usually a good idea to become familiar with your
 surroundings by exploring nearby rooms and take careful notice of the
 room descriptions.
 MOMENTS OUT OF TIME differs from many works of Interactive Fiction in
 its style; you will not find your progress brought to an impasse by a
 puzzle, nor will you be able to interact with other characters. Though
 you can influence your surroundings through your interaction with
 objects, your primary objective in this game is to explore your
 environment, and gather knowledge. There is a story behind MOMENTS OUT
 OF TIME, but your goal is to discover this story, rather than create
 it.
 Because the nature of this game is extremely open-ended, you may
 experience difficulty in assessing your progress. For this reason,
 MOMENTS OUT OF TIME keeps a numerical score. This score reflects an
 estimation made by the player character on your performance. This score
 does not, however, necessarily determine the results of the final
 evaluation of your performance. A perfect score is not necessary to
 complete the game, and indeed may not be possible, but by noting
 actions which increase your score, you may be able to direct your
 efforts.

 There are many kinds of sentences that Inform understands. Here are
 some examples:
 You can use multiple objects with some verbs if you separate them with
 the word "AND" or a comma. You can put several inputs on a line if you
 separate them by the word "THEN" or a period:
 BOOK.

 You can specify all the objects in room with you by typing "ALL":

 You can also use the pronouns "HIM", "HER", and "IT" to refer to the
 last object you referred to.

 Commands are not case sensitive, and may be in upper or lower case.

 ---MOMENTS OUT OF TIME - Game Manual---
 Page: 6 Basic Inform Commands

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 These are some of the most common commands for this game.
 LOOK (L)- One of the most useful verbs in the game. Alone, "LOOK"
 prints a description of your current location. You can also look at,
 in, under, or behind an object.
 EXAMINE (X)- looks at an object.
 SEARCH - Perform a visual search of an object from your current vantage
 point. If all angles of an object are not easily visible, you may need
 to look UNDER or BEHIND it.
 TAKE (GET)- You can attempt to "TAKE" any object in the game. If the
 object can be moved, it will be added to your inventory.
 INVENTORY (I)- This will list everything you are carrying or wearing.
 You may specify whether you want the inventory to be given in a "tall"
 format (one object listed underneath another), or a "wide" format
 (objects listed side by side). This game defaults to "TALL".
 WAIT (Z)- Because Inform waits for a command to advance the story, you
 could leave your computer, go out, take a bath, catch a game on the TV,
 eat a meal, play a quick game of DOOM, and return to find that no time
 has passed in the story. You can use "WAIT" to make time pass in the
 story without doing anything.
>go north
 "WAIT" normally waits a single turn-cycle. You may also indicate that
 you wish to wait for a specified number of turns to pass, or "WAIT
 UNTIL" a specified time. If anything interesting happens while you are
 waiting, you will be given a chance to cut short your period of
 passivity.

 ---MOMENTS OUT OF TIME - Game Manual---
 Page: 7 Inform Meta-Commands

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page


 There are certain "special" commands Inform understands. These commands
 are addressed to the computer rather than the game.

 SAVE - This stores your current position in the game. You can later
 return to this position through the RESTORE command.
 RESTORE - Restores a previously saved game.
 BRIEF - This command instructs the game to print a full description of
 a room only the first time you enter it. On subsequent visits, only the
 room name and objects in it will be listed.
 SUPERBRIEF - This command tells the game not to print room descriptions
 even if you haven't been there before. It is intended primarily for
 those already familiar with the game.
 VERBOSE - In VERBOSE mode, the full room description is printed each
 time you enter it. This game begins in VERBOSE mode.
 QUIT (Q)- This lets you stop playing. If you want to save your
 position, you must first use the SAVE command.
 RESTART - This stops the game and starts it over from the beginning.
 VERIFY - This command verifies that the game file has not been
 corrupted.
>go north
 SCORE - This shows your character's estimate of of your progress
 through the game.

 ---MOMENTS OUT OF TIME - Game Manual---
 Page: 8 Inform Meta-Commands

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page


 SCRIPT - Depending on your interpreter, a transcript of the story can
 be sent to either a printer or a file. "SCRIPT ON", or just "SCRIPT"
 begins the transcript, while "SCRIPT OFF" or "UNSCRIPT" ends the
 transcript.
 PRONOUNS - This command displays the current assignment of the pronouns
 "him", "her", and "it".
 VERSION - Shows the serial number and release number of the story.
 PRETTY - Depending on your computer and interpreter, some of the
 semi-graphical features of this game may not look right. The internal
 "PRETTY" settings may be changed by issuing the commands "PRETTY ON"
 and "PRETTY OFF". On its own, PRETTY will toggle the current pretty
 state.
 NOTIFY - Normally, you are not informed of changes in your progress
 rating. The command NOTIFY ON tells the game to print messages whenever
 this occurs. NOTIFY OFF causes these messages not to be printed. On its
 own, NOTIFY will toggle the current status.
 AGAIN (G) - This will exactly repeat the last command entered.
>go north
 OOPS - If you accidentally mistype a word, and the game returns an
 error such as "I don't understand the word...", you can correct the
 error by typing OOPS followed by the corrected word.

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page


 FOOTNOTE - Occasionally, the text will mention the existence of a
 footnote. To read the footnote, type FOOTNOTE, followed by the footnote
 number. This will not count as a turn.

 MANUAL - This will call up the on-line instruction manual.

 SETUP - Launches the interactive setup menu.

 STATUSBAR - Toggles printing of the statusline.

 SOUND - Some versions of this game include sound effects. If your
 interpreter supports sound, these effects will be played at various
 points in the game. "SOUND OFF" will disable sound, and "SOUND ON" will
 re-enable it. "SOUND UP" and "SOUND DOWN" can be used to alter the
 volume of sound effects. Because some interpreters may deal with sounds
 poorly, the game begins with sound effects disabled.
 Sounds are provided purely as an added bonus for the player, and are in
 no way important to completing the game.

 WINFROTZ - This command will toggle WinFrotz compatability mode to
 improve the display on versions of the interpreter which contain a V6
 display bug.

 [ - This "command" is ignored by the game. You can use it to make
 notes, which will appear in the game transcript:

 ---MOMENTS OUT OF TIME - Game Manual---
 Page: 10 Disambiguation Prompt

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 It is possible that the game may, at times, be unsure as to which of
 several possible items you are referring, and will present a prompt
 such as:

 Which do you mean, the red ball or the blue ball?

 In such cases, you may type additional words to clarify, or, if you
 prefer, type the number of the object you actually meant (in the above
 example, a response of `1` would be taken to mean the red ball, and `2`
 to mean the blue one.

 Page: 11 Navigating Menus

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 MOMENTS OUT OF TIME features an interactive run-time menu which is
 normally displayed across the bottom of the screen. If your interpreter
 supports the use of function keys, pressing the F1 key will activate
 the menu, which can be navigated via the arrow keys. Pressing F2 will
 activate the top-level menu, and the keys F3-F12 will activate
 selections from the top-level menu. The following commands affect the
 menu:
 MENU: Activate the current menu (F1)
 MENU OFF: If your interpreter does not properly support the menu line,
 or you prefer not to see it, you can disable the menu with this
 command.
 MENU ON: Enables the menu
 MENU TOP: Activate the menu and return to the top level
 MENU BIND: Toggles the binding of hotkeys F3-F12 from the top menu to
 the current menu
 MENU ADD COMMAND x: The menu system is customizable in two ways. You
 may add a "command", which will be executed exactly as if it were typed
 at the prompt
 MENU ADD WORD x: You may also add a "word" to the custom menu. When
 selected, the word will be inserted into the current line of input.

 The top-level menu has the following options:
 GAME: Game meta-commands
 VERBS: Common verbs
 COMPASS: Navigation
 INVENTORY: Items in your possession. Selecting an item will insert it
 in the input line
 LOCATION: A list of obvious items in the area
 CONSOLE: The chips in your StreamDive console
 CUSTOM: Items you have added to the menu

 Page: 13 The StreamDive Console

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 One of the key pieces of equipment carried by your character in this
 game is the "StreamDive Console". The StreamDive console serves a wide
 variety of functions, and it will be impossible to satisfactorily
 complete the game without it.

 The StreamDive console's many functions are accessed by using
 StreamDive chips. In terms of the game, these functions are realized as
 a set of verbs provided by each chip. When a chip is in place, its
 commands are available as normal game verbs, but when the chip is not
 in place, the parser will treat the verbs as unknown.

 A large number of StreamDive chips will be available to you, but the
 StreamDive console is only capable of holding five chips, so you will
 have to carefully choose those chips which provide the functionality
 you want. Each chip will open up certain avenues of exploration, but
 the restriction on the number of chips means that other areas will
 remain closed.

 Mission Parameters

 StreamDiver Alpha Tango-678
 FYEO

 Clearance granted for immediate StreamDive. Target is local grid
 reference 0x1549. Temporal Reference 785278.7 UDC. We will be in phase
 for StreamDive at 865741.3 UDC. Dive duration not to exceed .5 units
 UDC (12 hours local time). Stream Capacitance field will be set for
 auto-recall at this time.
 Research unit indicates high levels of stream distortion in this zone,
 indicating that premature extraction may not be possible.

 Mission Summary: The purpose of your StreamDive is historical research.
 We have isolated an evacuated area to minimize potential corruption.
 You are to record all findings, but avoid direct contact with any
 inhabitants. Records from this zone are fragmentary, so any documents
 of historical interest should be added to your DataStore.

 *WARNING*
 Due to ambient radiation levels, wideband recall will not be available.
 Since StreamDive instruments are shielded against EMP effects, lost
 components may be recoverable after destruction of the local grid
 section. For this reason, level 1b restrictions are in effect for the
 duration of this dive.

 PLEASE REVIEW STREAMDIVER MANUAL BEFORE COMMENCING DIVE.

>examine locker

 standard StreamDive equipment.

>search locker
 You can't see inside, since the equipment locker is closed.

>open locker

 cloaking device, an autokey, a stream visualizer, a probe and a chip
 bank.

>examine manual
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

>examine console
 Your StreamDive console is a small display device designed to provide
 you with relevant information about the current dive, and allow access
 to key StreamDive facilities [Footnote 1]. These facilities are made
 available by adding chips to its five-slot chiprack. The chiprack
 currently contains no chips.

>footnote 1
 [Footnote 1]
 Adding a chip to the console makes certain verbs available which access
 the chip's functions.

>inventory
 You are carrying a probe, a stream visualizer, an autokey, a cloaking
 device and your StreamDive console (which is empty).

>examine probe
 A telepresence probe unit. When activated, it operates as a fly-by-wire
 system which may allow the user access to areas too small to allow
 access.

>examine stream visualizer
 The stream visualizer is a de-focused temporal display. It scans
 backwards through the local timestream, correlating the results with
 the information in the DataStore. When the button is pushed, generates
 a hologram based on the results of its scan.

>examine autokey
 An electronic lockpick. It incorporates a small scanner and a force
 field generator. Using highly precise force field manipulation, it can
 be used as a universal key for almost any lock.

>examine cloaking device
 A standard-issue cloaking device. Operating along similar principles to
 the StreamDive device itself, it causes all photons entering the field
 to be instantly transported to the far side of the field as if they had
 passed straight through it, with the net result being that anything
 within the field is nearly invisible. The relocation effect causes
 "ghost" photons to be emitted by the inside of the field, allowing any
 person inside it to see his surroundings with a minimum of visual
 distortion. The device's battery is currently charged to 100 percent.
 The cloaking device is currently switched off.

 You are carrying nine chips (a shield chip, an interface chip, a blank
 chip, a scan chip, a cryptography chip, an artificial intuition chip, a
 library chip, a map chip and a DataStore chip), a probe, a stream
 visualizer, an autokey, a cloaking device and your StreamDive console,
 inside which is a dive chip.

>put library in console
 You put the library chip into the StreamDive console.

>put scan in console
 You put the scan chip into the StreamDive console.

>put interface in console
 You put the interface chip into the StreamDive console.

>examine console
 Your StreamDive console is a small display device designed to provide
 you with relevant information about the current dive, and allow access
 to key StreamDive facilities [Footnote 1]. These facilities are made
 available by adding chips to its five-slot chiprack. The chiprack
 currently contains five chips.

 This is the fundamental chip for the StreamDive console. It allows
 control of the temporal displacement functions.
 Commands Provided:
  RECALL -- Discharge StreamDive capacitors for instant recall
  STATUS -- Display status of Dive system
  TIMESCAN -- Scan local timestream

>look

 StreamDiver Prep Room
 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the
 field, and hope that one of your mission proposals will be accepted. On
 the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this
 room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations. The
 exit is east.

 The display monitor stands against one wall, your mission description
 visible on its screen.

 You can also see an equipment locker (in which is a chip bank (empty))
 here.
 A voice issues from the console. "StreamDiver Alpha Tango-678, please
 report for preDive examination."

>go east
 Your mission parameters were quite specific. You can only take one
 piece of equipment other than your StreamDive console.

>inventory
 You are carrying five chips (a shield chip, a blank chip, a
 cryptography chip, an artificial intuition chip and a map chip), a
 probe, a stream visualizer, an autokey, a cloaking device and your
 StreamDive console, inside which are five chips (an interface chip, a
 scan chip, a library chip, a DataStore chip and a dive chip).

>put shield, blank, cryptography, and intuition chip in locker
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

>put chips in locker
 shield chip: Done.
 blank chip: Done.
 cryptography chip: Done.
 artificial intuition chip: Done.
 map chip: Done.

>examine stream visualizer
 The stream visualizer is a de-focused temporal display. It scans
 backwards through the local timestream, correlating the results with
 the information in the DataStore. When the button is pushed, generates
 a hologram based on the results of its scan.

>put all but console and autokey in locker

 You walk out of the Prep Room, down the long corridor, and into the
 Dive section. A number of sensors verify that you are carrying no
 contraband, and make a detailed record of your relevant bio-data, which
 is compared to your records to ensure that you are indeed the person
 scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record
 will be compared again when you emerge, to ensure that nothing
 important about your physiology has altered during the dive. The only
 visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.

 Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
 where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
 renders you free of micro-organisms.

 You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an
 indentation by the next door, where ultrasonic "needles" inject you
 with the requisite immunity boosters, which always gives you the
 pleasant feeling of being, at least temporarily, totally impregnable to
 disease.

 One more room, and anticipation would increase your heart-rate enough
 that a sensor might declare you medically unfit for duty. Fortunately,
 this room is the last.


 StreamDive Core
 You stand in the core of the StreamDive Temporal Relocation Unit. Far
 below you, an artificial singularity waits to propel you backward in
 history. The room itself is a huge dome, totally black, but lit from an
 unseeable source. There is always gooseflesh on your arms when you
 stand in this room. It is not a friendly room, not a relaxed room. This
 is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
 than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
 design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
 time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
 itself, neither part of the present nor the past.

 It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

>dive
 In what?

>wait
 Time passes.
 A voice materializes from nowhere in particular. "StreamDiver Alpha
 Tango-678, StreamDive will commence in thirty seconds. Good luck, and
 Godspeed."

>wait
 Time passes.
 The floor fades to transparency. There is a brilliant point of light
 somewhere far below you. Scanning beams trace over your body. Below
 you, a perfect mirror image of yourself fades into existence, your
 avatar. You have a sinking feeling as your avatar falls toward the
 light. Just as you were trained, you roll back on the balls of your
 feet and close your eyes. In your head, you count to six. Deep down
 there, your avatar enters the event horizon of the artificial
 singularity. As always, you have the disconcerting sensation of
 falling...

 Cold.

 Hot.

 Bright.

 Dark.

 The pain is gone before you feel it. You want to open your eyes, but
 you know better. Even if you survived the experience, your sanity would
 not. You wait for the sensation of falling to end.

 It does.

 You wait for your perception of local timespace to return.

 It does.

 You open your eyes.


 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

 Stephen James Wallace
 Pioneer in human-computer neural interfaces and neural cybernetics.
 During the wars of the twentieth century, his familiarity with the
 internal workings of the human brain led to his being pressed into
 service as a neurosurgeon. After the wars, he applied his considerable
 computer skills to building brain implant devices which could restore
 brain function lost due to injury or illness. He received the Nobel
 Prize in 2086 for his work with stroke and brain cancer victims. Such
 modern inventions as the neural navigation interface and the artificial
 voice box owe much in their design to his work.

 Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
 Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
 Possibly the darkest period in recent history, this period contains the
 last and largest of the intercontinental wars. Several Middle Eastern
 nations formed a military alliance, and began imposing expansionist
 policies on neighboring countries. When the United States threatened to
 cut off trade relations with these countries, the formed a lucrative
 trade alliance with China. Because during this period, industrialized
 nations were still highly dependent on fossil fuel, an alliance of
 western nations declared war on China and the Arabic alliance. Tactical
 nuclear warheads were used by both sides, resulting in the near-total
 annihilation of many US-sympathetic countries in southeast Asia. Though
 US nuclear weapons were unable to breach Chinese countermeasures,
 several Chinese nuclear missiles did penetrate the US defensive system,
 obliterating a number of cities. The war was finally ended when the
 massive space station Kennedy crashed to Earth near the Chinese
 capital. The resulting explosion killed over two billion people,
 forcing the Chinese government to capitulate. However, widespread
 environmental and war damage left the entire world badly crippled.
 Reconstruction would take much of the next century, and the extensive
 costs of rebuilding the damaged world forced the beginning of
 governmental alliances that would eventually lead to a United Earth
 Government.

 Your mission occurs during the opening of the nuclear phase of the war.
 At 785278.83 UDC, a missile launched from China will exploit the breach
 in the US missile shield. Nine hours later, its course will be diverted
 away from Washington, DC to avoid US countermeasures. It will narrowly
 miss a secondary target, several miles from your Dive site, at 865741.8
 UDC.

 Space Station Kennedy
 Space Station Kennedy
 The first orbital platform intended for permanent occupation, Space
 Station Kennedy was assembled in Earth orbit in the second quarter of
 the twenty-first century. Compared with earlier projects, Kennedy was
 ambitious; it contained living facilities for twenty-five families,
 and, unlike earlier space stations, its primary function was not
 scientific, but industrial. Methods of zero-gravity production which
 had previously been tested on earlier space missions were implemented
 on a grand scale. It was also the first space vehicle to be equipped
 with a synthetic gravity system. After two decades of service, the
 station was badly damaged during the intercontinental war of the mid
 twenty-first century. Its crew were not able to prevent a forced
 re-entry, and chose to direct the crashing space station to a heavily
 inhabited area of China. Everyone aboard the station was killed in the
 resulting explosion, which also resulted in severe environmental
 catastrophes in Asia, prompting the end of the war.

>go west

 Pantry
 This is a small room, designed to hold food staples and cooking
 equipment not housed in the kitchen. You doubt you'll find anything
 worthwhile in here, but you've been a StreamDiver long enough to know
 better than to trust appearances. You can return east to the kitchen.

 Shelves line the walls, sparsely stocked.

 On the shelves are some pots and pans, a lazy susan (empty), a flour
 pot (closed) and a can of spiced ham (closed).

>examine flour pot
 It's a small tin pot bearing the word "flour" and a floral decoration.

>open it
 You open the flour pot, revealing some flour.

>search flour

>close flour pot
 You close the flour pot.

>examine can
 This is a can of compressed, meat-like substance, which, though only
 barely meeting the definition of "food", could have provided an easy
 meal in an emergency.

>examine susan
 Unbelievable. The workmanship which allows this device to swivel
 smoothly, allowing stored utensils to be easily accessed, all without
 the aid of laser construction or frictionless bearings. Still, from its
 gaudy appearance, it isn't hard to see why the owner relegated it to
 the pantry.

>turn susan
 It is fixed in place.

>examine pots
 A number of pots and pans sit on the shelves.

>look under shelf
 You find nothing of interest.

>scan
 The scanner has further details available on:
  the can of spiced ham

>scan ham
 A slight shiver runs up your spine as you read the results of the scan.
 Something similar to your temporal shield has been used on this can to
 force it into a hyperstable configuration. Despite the question of why
 anyone would do such a thing, what concerns you far more is the
 question of how it was done; such a transmutation is patently
 impossible without StreamDive technology. Has someone else been here?

>put ham on susan

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down,
 presumably to the basement.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

>examine letter
 Dear Julia,
 I hope to God you get this letter. We waited for you as long as we
 could, but they're saying that the bombs could fall any day. There's a
 shelter out in New Calvert, we're going there. Daddy says its the
 safest place in a hundred miles. Try to get there if you can, but don't
 take any risks. The most important thing is that you stay safe. I left
 some money and your grandmom's jewels in the hidden place for you. Your
 dad bought a gun and bullets, and put them there too, but be careful.
 We all love you and hope to see you again.

 Love,
 Mom.

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Spare Bedroom
 This room looks as if it hasn't seen use any time in the recent past.
 It is sparsely furnished, containing little more than a dresser, bed,
 and nightstand. The only exit is southeast.

 Some luggage has been tucked away by the door.

 On the nightstand is a memo pad.

>examine memo
 A blank pad of paper. There is a visible tear where the top sheet was
 torn off.

>scan pad
 The scanner enhances some vague indentations on the pad and reveals a
 message:

 [The document "Memo" has been added to your DataStore.]

>open luggage
 You look through the luggage. You find several changes of clothes and a
 slightly larger selection of female undergarments, as well as other
 sundries and personal hygiene products. Deciding that nothing of
 historical interest is there, you re-close the bags.

>scan
 As if mocking you, the scanner contradicts your hypothesis by
 indicating numerous small traces that the room has been occupied; signs
 of recent dusting, uneven settling of the bedsprings, and evidence that
 the notepad on the nightstand was recently moved.

 Hm. This place is starting to get to you.

 Den
 As an architectural feature, the den declined in popularity during this
 part of the century, but this house seems to have one nonetheless. From
 your historical research, you know that a den is a sort of cross
 between a study and a family room. This room shows signs of wear;
 stains and worn patches of carpet suggest heavy use. Behind one
 recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored
 from frequent collisions. One wall is covered in bookshelves. A
 well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a
 conversation area in the middle of the room. The western wall is open,
 leading back to the stairway.

 On the bar are four glasses (empty) and some bottles.

 A video game system sits before the video screen.

 You can also see a video screen and a video disc player (empty) here.

>examine bookshelves
 You see nothing special about the bookshelf.

 this period. There is a bookshelf along one wall, furnished more with
 office supplies than with books. The only exit is east.

 You can see a computer here.

 Mr. Wallace,

 In response to your inquiry, Arcotech shelters are designed to
 withstand most conventional attacks and fallout resulting from nuclear
 attacks. However, no consumer shelter can provide total protection. In
 the unlikely event that a nuclear strike occurs sufficiently close that
 your shelter would be within the cratered area, our level of protection
 would fail. Please keep in mind, however, that the chances of a nuclear
 strike close to your home are miniscule.

 We hope that your concerns have been addressed in a timely and useful
 manner. Please contact us if you have further concerns.

 James,

 Good work on the Klien account. We'll be closing in a few weeks. Frieda
 wants you look over the notes for the Monaco deal, but there's no rush.

 There's a little buzz about a possible government contract. Think
 LT-739 will be ready in two weeks?

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 Dear customer,

 The following technical support information is being sent in response
 to your message entitled: "Eye recharge fails", dated 5/11. If you
 believe this message has been sent in error, please contact
 abuse@optitron-biotechnics.usa

 Dear Mr. Wallace,
 Though recharge failures are rare, they do occur. Please be sure to
 clean the optic unit and charger receptacle thoroughly, as directed by
 your user manual. We find that over 90% of recharging difficulties are
 due to dirty contacts or charger misuse. If the problem persists, it
 may point to battery exhaustion. Though Optitron LZ-model storage units
 generally last at least 10 years, excessive wear and environmental
 conditions can shorten their lifetimes. Since your unit is over six
 years old, there is a small service charge for replacing the power
 unit. This charge covers installation of a new power cell, unit
 cleaning, and re-alignment.

 Please consider upgrading your prosthesis to the new LZ100-model, which
 adds the following enhancements:
  *Compatible with M-VIDEO 7 image capture devices
  *Improved resolution and focus
  *New long-life power cell, capable of storing power for 72 hours of
 use
  *High-speed recharge: battery can be charged to capacity in under 2
 hours
  *Power-saving mode: engages when eyes are closed to conserve power
  *In-place recharger: the prosthesis can be charged without removal
  *Increased comfort and durability
  *New life-like cosmetic lens: prosthesis is undetectable under casual
 examination

 We hope this information has been useful in solving your problem.
 Please cite this incident number (31821) your response if you wish to
 update your support issue.

 Sincerely,
 Camphor Tryst
 Support Department, Optitron BioTech

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 Mr. Wallace, Thank you for your concern. According to our records, your
 ArcoTech shelter is designed to provide living facilities for four
 persons for thirty years. Because we realize that unforeseen
 circumstances might increase the number of persons occupying the
 shelter (births, inability to turn away unprepared neighbors), all our
 shelters provide some leeway. In the situation described, the addition
 of another person might decrease shelter comfort and efficiency, but
 should not seriously endanger you or your family. If it becomes
 necessary to occupy your shelter, you should implement stricter
 rationing than normal to ensure that supplies are not over-taxed.
 Because air and water availability are your most pressing concerns, we
 recommend you install the Arcotech Supplementary Life Support System,
 which will reduce the load on the main system to increase shelter
 comfort if it is made to provide for more occupants.

 We hope that your concerns have been addressed in a timely and useful
 manner. Please contact us if you have further concerns.

 Support Department

 Valued customer,

 As you may know, the North American space defense shield has recently
 been breached by Chinese countermeasures. Since this greatly increases
 the chances that bombs may land on US soil, we would like to take this
 time to urge all our customers to ensure that their shelters are in
 working order and make arrangements to enter the shelter at any time.

 Thank you

 Arcotech (Arcotech Home Survival Technologies)
 Manufacturer of blast and survival shelters for private homes during
 the twenty-first century. The company made enormous profits during the
 years leading up to the intercontinental war at the middle of the
 century as interest in survival shelters grew to a height unprecedented
 since the "Cold War" of the third quarter of the twentieth century.
 Although their products were generally considered the highest quality
 available during their time, the shelters were not capable of
 withstanding the more powerful nuclear and quantum weapons used during
 the war, and the company eventually declared bankruptcy. Their product
 lines were eventually bought by Amalgamated Industries, inc.

 No shelters built during this period are currently known to exist.

 Amalgamated Industries
 Manufacturing megacorporation of the North American Continent.
 Following the trans-continental war of the twenty-first century,
 Amalgamated Industries bought over 90% of the manufacturing companies
 in the western hemisphere. It was one of the companies involved in the
 events of the Seventy Days, and collapsed soon afterward.

 Historical Period: The Seventy Days
 Term used to describe the period from September to November of the
 old-calendar year 2102. Reconstruction after the wars of the previous
 century left most of the world in the debt of seventeen
 megacorporations. On September 12, 2102 (old date), the
 megacorporations foreclosed on the collective nations of the world, and
 assumed legal control of the planet. They were met with little
 resistance from world populations, who had grown dissatisfied with the
 national governments. Though their leadership was able to provide rapid
 improvement of living conditions for many inhabitants, the task of
 managing an entire planet proved too much for the megacorporations, who
 soon discovered that the world as a whole could not be run profitably.
 After several administrative fiascoes, the most notable of which
 involved the firing and eviction from Earth of the entire population of
 Canada, the corporate consortium itself declared bankruptcy exactly 70
 days after its inception, thrusting the world into anarchy.

 The United Earth Directorate quickly arose to fill the infrastructure
 created by the consortium, becoming the first true one-world
 government.

>look in it
 On a whim, you lift the heavy boxes and raise the lid of the toilet
 seat. The bowl has been drained, and resting inside is a small book,
 which you manage, with some difficulty, to retrieve before letting the
 boxes fall back into place.

>examine book
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

 You are carrying a diary, a wooden knob, an autokey and your StreamDive
 console, inside which are five chips (an interface chip, a scan chip, a
 library chip, a DataStore chip and a dive chip).

>examine diary
 A small book, probably a diary. That would be a boon; diaries,
 journals, all the personal records kept by people are what you're
 really here for. A house full of paintings, interesting furniture, even
 platinum doubloons won't equal what you could learn about this time
 from the diary of someone who actually lived it. There is a tiny metal
 closure locking it, but you'll be damned if that's going to stop you
 from looking inside.

>open diary
 It's locked.

>open diary with autokey
 The lock clicks open. Your hands almost tremble in anticipation. What a
 find!

 You open the book...

 What?

 It's encoded? Who keeps a diary in code? Well, obviously, Julia Yvonne
 Wallace does. You can't help but wondering what could make someone so
 paranoid as to go to the trouble of encoding a locked, hidden diary.

 April 20 - Dreamt last night. The unbelievable pleasure of feeling a
 knife being thrust into my chest.

 Mom didn't take the bait. Maybe she's not still snooping on me.

 April 22 - They're sending troops into the middle east. Everyone says
 not to worry and we'll just clear this up like we have before. There's
 not going to be a war. But we've already got troops in so many other
 places. Jim's terrified that he's gonna get drafted. There hasn't been
 a draft in almost a hundred years though. The news says this will blow
 over in a couple of months, but Jimmy says that the president's an ass
 and he wants a war to boost his popularity rating. Dad thinks he's an
 idiot because no president would think that starting a war and getting
 hundreds of our people killed would make him popular. Maybe I should
 start reading the papers more.

 Thinks it's going to, and I quote, "set him up among the gods." He's
 trying to get in touch with a bunch of professors at the big-league CS
 schools. Thinks he's hot stuff. Dad, who really ought to know better,
 asked him about his new "discovery", and he went on for about an hour,
 not really saying anything that made much sense. The long and short of
 it is that he thinks he's figured out how his brain works, and he
 thinks he's got a way to make a computer do the same thing. Wonderful.
 A computer that thinks like my brother.

 May 6 - You are not fucking going to believe this. They've started up
 the draft. And what's more? They're not taking girls. I know, they've
 never taken them before, but they said that they would now, since
 they're all "liberated" and shit.

 Anyway, why aren't they taking girls, you ask? Well, there was a
 fucking commercial. A fucking commercial explaining how important women
 were to the war effort, and that's why they're not drafting them. And
 the way they're important to the war effort? You're gonna fucking love
 this -- reproduction. They're saying that it's "The duty of all
 citizens to make full use of their reproductive capabilities to ensure
 that our population remains strong and growing through these times of
 adversity."

 What is this, the fucking dark ages? In addition to their
 heart-fucking-felt sermon, they've voted in a massive tax-break for
 families with newborns, a government handout for women who get
 themselves pregnant, and subsidies for unmarried women who want
 artificial insemination. They're also rushing through a bunch of
 fertility drugs that increase the chances of having twins. The got some
 low-level flunkie in one of the fringe groups on record saying that it
 was the "sworn duty of every woman to attempt conception", and that
 parents should encourage their daughters to get themselves knocked up
 as young as fifteen. They're trying to fucking breed themselves an
 army.

>go north
 But it'll be what, twenty years before any of these war babies are old
 enough to fight. The war can't go on that long, can it?

 May 7 - Oh the shit has hit the fan. There's rioting in the streets.
 The people who don't like the war are protesting the war. The people
 who don't like the draft are protesting the draft. Pretty much everyone
 is protesting the breeding plan, except for the ones that are lined up
 around the block to get a big fat shot of fertility drugs and the big
 fat check that goes with it. Mom's friend that works for a doctor says
 that they've been asked not to tie anyone's tubes or give out
 contraceptives anymore. I found out that Jim's stockpiling condoms, on
 the off chance he manages to get a girl who doesn't think the rest of
 him's as ugly as his face. Says there's a bill in congress to restrict
 the sale of anything that prevents pregnancy.

 Donna's friend Rusty is talking about signing up. She's trying to talk
 him out of it, but he figures his draft notice is in the mail already
 anyway.

 May 11 - When I got up this morning, my eye hadn't recharged. Hope I
 don't have to get the damned thing serviced. I couldn't go anywhere, of
 course, because I had to leave it on the charger all day. But Donna
 came over and we hung out. She went out with Tom last night and had a
 good time and all.

 She thinks the eyepatch makes me look tough.

 May 12 - Eye worked today. Guess I had it in the charger wrong or
 something.

 May 13 - Donna's dad got "activated", which means he has to ship out.
 He does something technical for the navy, so it's not like he's going
 to the front or anything, but she's still scared. He wants her to go
 live with her grandmom. We talked to mom, and she said it would be okay
 if she stayed with us at least until the end of school. Her grandmom's
 an 80 year old woman with about a hundred cats.

 May 17 (later) - Fell asleep without taking my eye out so it's dead
 today. And no one ever told me how much it hurts if you sleep with
 contacts in. Told mom I was too sick to see the shrink today, which
 isn't far from the truth. I managed to get Donna down to her bed before
 mom went to wake her up for breakfast. As if we could eat. We crashed
 in my room most of the day so no one would see how sick we were.

>go north
 I let her get a good look at the hole in my face where my eye goes. She
 wasn't grossed out or anything. She asked me if I wanted to touch her
 scar. It was a little weird because you can feel little bumps where
 they stitched her cheek closed.

 May 19 - The fighting has escalated. Last night, one of our islands in
 the pacific got wiped off the map. That many people could just wink out
 of existence like that, and the world just goes on.

 May 20 - Rethinking yesterday's entry. We've been bombing the country
 with the largest population in the world for weeks now. Maybe we got
 what we deserved.

 the only boys that haven't been drafted are cripples and felons. And
 Rusty, of course, but I get the feeling he's looking to set up family
 ties with a nice boy himself.

 May 26 - Mom is moving most of the valuables into long-term storage. As
 in "make Jim go out in the woods and dig a deep hole to hide them in."
 Won't help. We're all going to die.

 because she had gotten involved in packing some things.

 June 2 - Donna is still acting funny. I wonder if she's worried about
 her dad.

 June 3 - As close as I can tell, I'm a free woman again. Mom and Dad
 aren't watching me constantly, and I can pretty much come and go as I
 please, with the caveat that I can't stay out too long, what with the
 imminent possibility of he bomb killing us all.

 But I'm worried about Donna. She wanders off for hours at a time,
 doesn't say anything.

 June 4 - Jimmy's got himself a girlfriend. How cute. She's a
 rolly-polly little thing with coke-bottle glasses who thinks the sun
 rises and sets on him because of his brilliant invention. Maybe his
 stockpile won't go to waste after all.

 Yeah. And maybe my eye will grow back.

 June 9 - Donna asked me to try on some of her clothes. I don't like
 wearing a skirt, but she said I have really nice legs & I should show
 them off. Nice legs? Anyway, I hope this means she's feeling better,
 but there was something distant about her. About the only thing she was
 willing to talk about was the time I slit my wrists. Morbid.

 June 10 - Rained all day today. After watching a whole lot of TV, we
 basically just sat around. I worked on new pages for my code book while
 Donna just sat there and watched me.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 [pausing to show unread error message]








 [The game has detected that you are using a version of the "Nitfol"
 interpreter, or a display with a width less than 22 characters. The
 statusline, menu bar, and "pretty-printing" of menus have been disabled
 to improve performance under this screen model. These features can be
 re-enabled as described in the manual.]




 The indicator light switches from blue to green. The thought occurs to
 you that this is an exceptionally bad color choice for someone who,
 like you, suffers from a mild genetic deficit in the color perception
 department. However, you've been around long enough to be familiar with
 the change in hue that indicates clearance for a StreamDive.

 Your elation is such that it takes you a few seconds to respond to the
 indicator -- a critical error, though not a fatal one. You touch the
 control, and are further pleased to find that your mission hasn't been
 scrapped due to your moment of indecision. The full text of your
 mission description appears on the display...

 StreamDiver Prep Room
 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the
 field, and hope that one of your mission proposals will be accepted. On
 the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this
 room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations. The
 exit is east.

 The display monitor stands against one wall, your mission description
 visible on its screen.

 You can also see an equipment locker (closed) here.

>look

 Bathroom
 You get the impression that this bathroom has become a waystation for
 things that were intended for the basement, but got lost along the way.
 Boxes and bags seem to cover every surface; the sink, the heating vent,
 the fixture. The way out is south.

>examine vent
 Forced air environmental control... You've heard of this. It's a system
 which controlled the temperature in a building via the crude method of
 pumping air of the desired temperature through a system of metal tubes
 toward various areas of the house. It's an interesting system, neither
 very efficient, nor robust, but it did allow the most cost-effective
 means of controlling interior climate available in this era.

>look in vent
 The vent is empty.

>enter vent
 There is no way something your size could fit through that opening.

>examine boxes
 You see nothing special about the boxes.

>open boxes
 You glance through a few boxes, finding nothing more interesting than
 folded clothes.

>open bags
 You find nothing of interest.

>go south

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 2], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

>go up

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

>go east

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

>open cabinet
 You open the video cabinet, revealing a video screen, a video disc
 player and six video discs (one "Episode Two", one "Jigsaw", one
 "Spider and Web", one "Symetry", one "War of the Worlds" and one "Best
 Chefs").

>scan
 The scanner reveals nothing of interest.

>examine spider
 The cover of this video is completely nondescript, giving no clue as to
 its contents.

>take spider
 Taken.

>put it in player
 You put the video disc of "Spider and Web" into the video disc player.

>turn on video screen
 The display flickers to life, showing static. Service has apparently
 been interrupted.

>turn on player
 The video monitor begins showing what seems to be a spy thriller. It is
 extremely difficult to work out what exactly is going on, but you
 imagine that's intentional.

>open closet
 (with the autokey.)
 Unlocked.

>open closet
 (with the autokey.)
 You'll have to be more specific; which door do you want to unlock?

>examine couch
 The couch is a standard piece of living room furniture. This one is
 large and comfortable. This one has been covered with a hand-fitted
 cloth drape featuring a subtle print, a more economical way to keep up
 with the latest fashion trends and hide minor damage than
 reupholstering.

>search it
 There is nothing on the couch.

>examine art
 It's funny, when you think about it. Something as innocuous as the
 cabinet on the far side of the room would be considered an objet d'art
 in your time, while these mass-produced items, clearly designed to be
 art are barely worth notice. While none of these items would ever cross
 the threshold of your apartment, you could imagine factory-made art
 just like this adorning shelves in your own time. Bad taste never
 changes.

>take spider from player
 You switch the video player off. The screen switches to static.
 Removed.

>take episode 2
 Taken.

>put it in player
 You put the video disc of "Episode Two" into the video disc player.

>turn on player
 The video monitor begins showing a frightful display of primitive
 computer graphics with annoying characters and a puerile plot.

>take episode 2
 You switch the video player off. The screen switches to static.
 Taken.

>examine cabinet
 A large, wooden, wardrobe-like cabinet sits along the south wall,
 roughly at the focal point of the room's seating. The part of you that
 spends your off-hours rummaging through antique shops perks up a
 little. They don't build them like this any more. If it survived to
 your time, a piece like this would be worth a packet to a dealer in
 antique furniture. None of the antiseptic sterility of the
 mass-replicated contemporary pieces. This is a piece that was built --
 physically made out of raw material. There is something personal about
 it, the sense that nothing came between the builder and the built less
 personal than steel machinery.

>look in it
 In the video cabinet are a video screen, a video disc player and four
 video discs (one "Jigsaw", one "Symetry", one "War of the Worlds" and
 one "Best Chefs").

>take symetry
 Taken.

>put it in player
 You put the video disc of "Symetry" into the video disc player.

> turn on player
 The video monitor begins showing a film which either displays a subtle
 existentialist brilliance, or, more likely, some of the most inept
 direction, cinematography and writing you've ever seen.

>scan symetry
 The scanner reveals nothing of interest.
 Somewhere near the coast of Alaska, an intercontinental missile
 generates a high-frequency electrical field, rendering it invisible to
 the defensive screen covering much of the North American continent.

>go east

 Living Room Closet
 This was originally a walk-in closet, but with the quantity of items
 which have accumulated here, it has become more of a stand-in closet.
 You are sure that if the building weren't doomed, it would eventually
 have turned into a lean-in closet. Between the well-stocked coat rod
 and a number of boxes, there is just enough room for you to turn around
 if you feel like returning west to the living room.

 On the coat rod are a winter coat (in which is a sales brochure), a
 light jacket (empty), a windbreaker (empty), a gray suitcoat (empty), a
 black suitcoat (empty) and a smoking jacket (empty).

 Construction
 Arcotech shelters are built with the highest degree of precision
 technology to provide optimal support and security. Shelter roofs and
 walls are built from high-tech steel corrugated arch panels to ensure
 maximum strength and load-bearing. The corrugated design allows
 high-quality seals between arch panels so that shelters can be built of
 any length.

 Arcotech shelters come standard with heavy steel endwalls. For added
 protection, concrete endwall reinforcements are available. Due to the
 patented interlocking all-steel design, additional layers of protection
 can be added to the arch or endwalls.

 For the ultimate in radiation protection, lead insulating sheets may be
 added.

 All Arcotech shelters come with a reinforced heavy steel door. Thick
 security bolts ensure that the shelter cannot be breached. Many
 Arcotech shelters include a secondary egress hatch, which can be
 installed in the roof with a minimal reduction in structural integrity.

 Life-support Equipment
 Arcotech shelters include the latest in high-endurance life support
 equipment. All Arcotech shelters are equipped with both secure
 ventilation systems for processing outside air, and with an advanced
 air recycling system. In emergencies, the shelter can be sealed and
 operate entirely on stored air reserves for up to six months at a time.
 When outside air is safe for use, it can be used to replenish internal
 supplies in a matter of hours.

 The water recycling system standard on Arcotech shelters is able to
 provide adequate, safe water supplies over extended periods. With
 strict water rationing, the shelter is able to recycle approximately
 85% of its stored water. Optional accessories include facilities for
 collecting and purifying water from surface runoff and underground
 deposits. The standard water storage system included with each Arcotech
 shelter contains sufficient reserves for three months of use. With
 water recycling and collection, usable water may be replenished
 indefinitely.

 Sanitation and waste-disposal facilities in Arcotech Shelters are
 second to none. The low-energy waste incinerator reduces all human and
 other waste products to compact ash, which is stored in the insecure
 waste pit. Waste pit capacities vary with space availability, but are
 generally large enough to store several years worth of waste.

 The standard equipment for Arcotech home survival shelters includes a
 30-year supply of nonperishable food stocks designed to meet all
 nutritional needs. Users with infants and small children are advised to
 consider ordering the optional child nutrition supplement.

 In addition for stocks of first-aid supplies, the medical stores
 standard in Arcotech shelters include medical equipment and medicine
 for treating minor maladies and injuries, along with detailed, useful
 information on their use. To foster adequate health and morale, most
 shelters are capable of increasing the normally dim lights to output
 sun-like spectra for limited periods. By using this feature several
 times a week, occupants can avoid depression and diseases caused by
 lack of sunlight.

 Arcotech shelters are powered by a patented high-performance chemical
 induction system, which can deliver operating power to the shelter for
 at least 30 years without replenishment. For above-ground shelters,
 solar power cells are also available. The energy source is suitably
 shielded from EMP effects which may accompany nuclear attacks.

 Accommodations
 Arcotech home survival shelters come standard with accommodations for
 families of four, six, eight, and twelve persons. Accommodations for
 larger groups may be custom ordered.

 Standard accommodations include comfortable, high-durability bedding
 with optional privacy screens, a dining and utility table with chairs,
 personal storage compartments, and durable survival clothing. Efficient
 kitchen, laundry, and toilet facilities are also provided, as is a
 privacy-screen area for low-water washing.

 Because of the importance of maintaining morale during an extended
 stay, Arcotech shelters also contain minimal facilities for relaxation,
 exercise, and entertainment. All non-value-line models of Arcotech
 shelters include a "relaxation area", consisting of a foldable couch
 (which may be raised to form an exercise area), small television with
 video and music player, and storage space large enough to contain a
 small library or children's toys.

 Security/Survival
 All Arcotech shelters are equipped with the following minimal equipment
 to facilitate survival in times of crisis. Many other options are
 available. Contact your Arcotech Sales Representative for a full list
 of features recommended in your area.
  *Easy-to-use radiation meters
  *Two 30" 22 mag. cal. single-action rifles and ammunition for personal
 defense and hunting
  *Shortwave radio and transmitter
  *Desktop computer with wireless network connection
  *"Panic" locking mechanism: Shelter egress can be secured so that its
 entryway cannot be opened from inside for a specified time, or until
 radiation levels are safe, to prevent early egress in the event an
 occupant becomes unreasonable
  *Cyanide capsules: stored in a locked box, also fitted with a panic
 locking mechanism, are provided as a painless alternative to radiation
 sickness or degenerative illness
  *Government approved survival instructions: Arcotech is the only
 shelter manufacturer to equip each shelter with all of the Federal
 Government's latest survival instruction booklets. Other manufacturers
 often use dangerously out-of-date materials, some nearly a century old

 Arcotech: Your Life May Depend On It

 You notice that the document mentions nothing about protection from
 photo-nuclear weapons. Though the document is grossly limited in its
 treatment of technical considerations, you quickly realize that such a
 shelter would not provide adequate protection from even non-nuclear
 attacks closer than a few dozen kilometers away. Its primary utility
 rests in protecting its occupants from residual radiation released by
 fallout from a distant bomb strike. Of course, a far less opulent
 shelter would still provide adequate defense under such circumstances.

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

>go west

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

>go west

 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

 Dining Room
 When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
 of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
 room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
 dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
 undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
 of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
 area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
 uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
 of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
 in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
 nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
 portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
 small door is west.

 On the buffet are two oil lamps.

 You can see a photograph here.

>examine photograph
 This is apparently a visual of the family that lived in this house. In
 the back stand two adults, a man whose receding hair looks unnaturally
 dark, wearing thick, horn-rimmed eyeglasses, and a woman, much shorter,
 who looks about the same age. She too wears glasses, with a more
 fashionable wire frame. Her front teeth, visible in what looks like an
 unaccustomed smile, are stained and crooked. A small scar is visible
 near the corner of her mouth. Before them are two children. On the
 right, a boy about ten, has a ridiculous smile and equally ridiculous
 bowl-cut. Beside him is a girl, probably a few years his senior. You
 aren't sure, but you think you see a glint of something reflective near
 her temple, where her hair is awkwardly combed over a bald patch. Her
 eyes are not quite the same color, though that may be a blemish on the
 photograph. There does certainly seem to be something odd about her
 right eye, but you can't tell on a photograph this size.

 She wears a formless gown in an unflattering blue pastel with a
 mortarboard cap. The girl in the picture looks about the right age for
 this photograph to be commemorating a high school graduation, though
 there are signs that she might be older; her expression is one of
 world-weariness, and her disapproving frown merges into lines on the
 face which suggest that this is an accustomed expression. You imagine
 that she would be quite attractive, if not for the scowl which seems to
 be permanently burnt into her face.

 An unnatural reflection causes you to notice her right eye, which,
 under close scrutiny, is apparently artificial. Though the prosthesis
 is good enough to pass for the real thing under casual scrutiny, it
 does lack the bloodshot look of the left eye, and you can make out the
 segmentation of a mechanical iris. If the color had been a better match
 for her left eye, you might well not have noticed.

 intensive cleaning tends to remove much of the anthropological evidence

 function. All the same, it's still a device whose single purpose is the
 extinguishing of human life, and that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

 Sealed Room
 You are in a small, dark room that appears to have been unused for
 years. The only feature worth noting is a wooden ladder which leads to
 an opening in the ceiling. The exit is north.

>go north

 Hallway, west end
 The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point
 of view. You can see where the stairway meets the hall to the east, and
 doors are located along the north, south, and west walls.

 A framed photograph of a young woman graces one wall.

>go east

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>go down

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway

 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

>examine photo
 This image shows a young man in his mid-teens. He sports a pathetic
 attempt at a moustache. Though he shows all the awkwardness of
 adolescence, he apparently does know, at least, how to pose for a
 photograph. He has a very slight smile, and a look of interested
 curiosity on his face. He does show the awkward pockmarks of severe
 acne, made worse by the extreme fullness of his face. He is wearing a
 black shirt with a suede vest, which bears a small lapel pin, of the
 sort distributed by academic honor societies.

 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not

 The small office is furnished much as you'd expect for an office of

 Den
 As an architectural feature, the den declined in popularity during this
 part of the century, but this house seems to have one nonetheless. From
 your historical research, you know that a den is a sort of cross
 between a study and a family room. This room shows signs of wear;
 stains and worn patches of carpet suggest heavy use. Behind one
 recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored
 from frequent collisions. One wall is covered in bookshelves. A
 well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a
 conversation area in the middle of the room. The western wall is open,
 leading back to the stairway.

 On the couch is a deadbolt key.

 On the bar are four glasses (empty) and some bottles.

 The indicator light switches from blue to green. The thought occurs to
 you that this is an exceptionally bad color choice for someone who,
 like you, suffers from a mild genetic deficit in the color perception
 department. However, you've been around long enough to be familiar with
 the change in hue that indicates clearance for a StreamDive.

 Your elation is such that it takes you a few seconds to respond to the
 indicator -- a critical error, though not a fatal one. You touch the

 scrapped due to your moment of indecision. The full text of your

 StreamDiver Prep Room
 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the
 field, and hope that one of your mission proposals will be accepted. On
 the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this
 room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations. The
 exit is east.

 The display monitor stands against one wall, your mission description
 visible on its screen.

 You can also see an equipment locker (closed) here.

 Boy's Bedroom
 Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
 of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
 course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
 more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
 that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
 that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
 one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
 books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
 The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
 the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
 appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

>examine floor
 (the floor)
 You don't recall any precedent in home furnishing that would call for
 industrial grade linoleum in a bedroom, but it is here nonetheless.
 Since you can't imagine that the floor is an artifact from an earlier
 function of the room, it is somewhat perplexing that such a floor would
 be present.

>scan
 The scanner reveals nothing of interest.

>examine computer
 You stop a while an examine the contents of the desk. Almost the entire
 surface of the desk is covered by an eclectic combination of both
 state-or-the-art and antique computer equipment. You find it hard to
 tear yourself away; At least a decade of computing history is spread
 out before you. You can't even identify all of the systems; the
 fixed-form text input device is easy enough, but there is a small,
 vaguely rodent-shaped device whose purpose is less clear. There are a
 number of external storage systems, rather than the single optical chip
 interface common in your time.

 but after looking at your work so far, I was amazed. You really seem to
 have a gift for this. If you don't mind, I'd like to forward your

 Hey guys,

 I just tried out the glul-X patch -- WOW. I got all kinds of stuff.
 Managed to hack into MuseNet, got about 60 hours of music before they
 shut down my access. I'm putting it all up on my Libertynet node.

 Jimbo, that cracker you sent me is amazing. It got me into the school
 network in like five seconds. Guess who isn't failing Bio anymore? LOL

 And because I know you guys like it...

 Jim,

 Hello. Dr. Shalanzar showed me some of the work you've done, and I
 can't believe my eyes. I'm going to forward some of my research to you,
 maybe we can work together. I didn't think it was possible, but it
 looks like you're most of the way to a viable simulation of human
 functioning. I could certainly use some of your heuristics in my own
 project. Let me tell you, having a paper out in a journal is a pretty
 sure-fire way to get your college career paid for.

 From what you've told me, I agree that taking a comprehensive
 activation scan of a human brain is feasible with your heuristic, and
 it may be the only way to solve the missing part of your simulation.
 The main problem is that you could only take the kind of readings you
 need if you had some kind of direct interface to the optic nerve. And,
 of course, you'd need a human subject willing to have an optical
 interface implant. I doubt you could get it past an ethics review
 board.

 D00dz,

 Found a relay this week, something that the can't trace you back from.
 I've got the Plover program running on about sixty systems now, and I
 think we can bring down all kinds of shit.

 Jimbo comes through again. We got into the missile security system last
 night. Good thing we were using the relay or there'd be black
 helicopters at my house now, but if we can get the shroud working
 right, hell, we could even nuke a small country if we wanted.

 No new sites this week, but I've got one better. Dante swapped out
 Lynchzilla's LZ-100 for his, with the remote chip. He's got about 8
 hours of her "monitoring" the girl's locker room. You know how big a
 dyke she is, well we got the goods, since she since she did some
 hardcore "monitoring" while Libby Sikes was in the showers after field
 hockey practice. It's all up on Dante's LibertyNet node. He put up some
 pretty sick stuff too, Lynchzilla "entertaining" herself.

 Jim,

 This is really hard, and I'm probably not making a lot of sense, but I
 want to get this all out.

 It's just that lately, I've been feeling kind of pressured by you. I
 mean, I really like you and everything, but I've never done anything
 like this before. And it's starting to make me uncomfortable. It's not
 that I don't want to have sex with you, but this is kind of fast.
 You're my first real bf, and I don't want to rush into it and feel bad
 about it later. I sort of made a promise to myself that I'd wait, and
 now I keep getting this vibe from you that you're getting impatient. I
 keep getting afraid that if we do it, I'll be lousy and you'll leave
 me, or it'll change everything and it'll get all weird.

 Look, I'm sorry. This is probably all in my head. You know I don't want
 to hurt you.

 Okay dude, don't blow a gasket. So she's really fucked in the head?
 Well, I guess she's got a right after what happened to her. Just forget
 I asked.

 Things pretty serious with you and Mercer? Don't think I'm muscling in

 but she's got a body under that babyfat. Keep in there, she'll cave.

 Thanks for writing back so fast. I guess it's good to know that I'm not
 just crazy. I get scared about the war too, but I'm just not sure if
 I'm ready. Look, things are okay with us, promise. I wasn't upset at
 you. I want to be with you too. I was just afraid that you'd break up
 with me if I kept turning you down.

 You really think that the war's going to keep getting worse? Maybe you
 do have a point about everything. I need some time to think about it.

 I'm really boggled. You know you just saved me six months of work? I
 think you'll find that if you insert De Kuyper's algorithm in the
 neural sequencing, it'll solve that stability problem. I can forward
 the article to you if you like.

 Look, we don't usually do this, but I can't pass a chance like this up.
 Pacific might be willing to waive some of the entrance requirements and
 let you come here in the fall instead of finishing out high school.
 Full ride, and I can swing a stipend for you if you'll agree to join
 the research team. What do you think?

 Guys, we've got a problem. Like, a BIG problem.

 I was watching the feed from Coach Lynch's eye today after school,
 right? So she's in her office after practice and Libby Sikes comes in,
 ok? And they're talking for a while, but I can't hear what they're
 saying, of course. After a while, Lynchzilla shuts the door, and a
 couple of minutes later, she's feeling Libby up.

 I ran the video by Marty, since he's deaf and reads lips. From Libby's
 side of it, it looks like she's gonna get cut from the team, on account
 of she sucks ass at field hockey. And, we're not too sure on this, but
 it looks like Lynch is gonna let her stay on the team if she fucks her.

 Lynch should go to jail for fucking a student, but no one but us knows
 about it, and all the proof we got is this recording, so if we give it
 to the cops, we'll be in the cell right next to her. We should never
 have done this.

 So what should we do?

 Boy's Bedroom
 Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
 of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
 course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
 more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
 that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
 that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
 one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
 books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
 The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
 the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
 appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

>examine bookcase
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

>put disc into computer
 Which do you mean, the unlabeled data disc, the video disc of "Episode
 Two" or the video disc of "Spider and Web"?

>unlabeled
 That can't contain things.

>timescan
 The temporal scan is almost entirely washed out by interference. What
 could cause that?

 Wait... you're detecting residual traces of carbon quarks. An avatar?
 But that would mean that someone else has temporally relocated to this
 location.

>examine floor
 (the floor)
 You don't recall any precedent in home furnishing that would call for
 industrial grade linoleum in a bedroom, but it is here nonetheless.
 Since you can't imagine that the floor is an artifact from an earlier
 function of the room, it is somewhat perplexing that such a floor would
 be present.

 LibertyNet
 Originally an outgrowth of a research project in distributed document
 storage, the "LibertyNet Protocol" became widely used among less
 legitimate members of the digital subculture in the mid 21st century.
 The system propagated documents in a semi-anonymous manner so that
 users could choose to release a document which could not be traced back
 to an owner, and was similar to the earlier "freenet" project. Though
 originally intended a method for free expression in countries lacking
 legal protection of free speech, it quickly degenerated into a
 marketplace for the exchange of pornography, bootleg music, and stolen
 computer software. Numerous attempts by various governments to shut
 down LibertyNet were mostly unsuccessful and increased its underground
 appeal. LibertyNet was eventually made obsolete by the Global Dataweb.

 Internet
 Collective term for the services which made up the first widely used
 global computer network. The internet allowed messages, documents, and
 data to be quickly transferred between any two computers by forming a
 route between intermediate systems. The internet grew at a rapid rate
 in size and scale through the last years of the twentieth century and
 first years of the twenty-first. Its growth suffered major setbacks due
 to the wars and economic recessions of the twenty-first century, but it
 slowly subsumed all other means of communication and media. The
 internet eventually evolved into the Global Dataweb near the close of
 the 21st century.

>research dataweb
 Dataweb (Global Dataweb; Web)
 Global data networks are reported as early as the last quarter of the
 twentieth century. By the end of the 21st century, the internet had
 evolved into the more familiar form of the Global Dataweb. The name
 "Dataweb" refers to the Dataweb Protocol, its major services (such as
 electronic mail, video communication, and document archive), and
 individual documents attached to it. When the Dataweb Protocol was
 introduced, nearly all electronic devices made use of it, from simple
 audio-visual communication and text messaging, to remote control and
 navigation systems. Though the system itself has changed little since
 its inception, the name has fallen into disuse.

 StreamDiver Prep Room
 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the

>recall
 [You still have time remaining in this Dive. Are you sure you wish to
 end your Dive early?]

>yes
 All at once, the universe goes away. Time itself cries out in distress,
 and every cell in your body echoes its cry. The laws of physics cannot
 be broken, but they can be bent, if only for a time. As the energy
 stored in your temporal capacitors discharges, time reasserts itself.
 If you were the sort to anthopomorphize physical law, you'd say that it
 was extracting some revenge against you for daring to transcend the
 barriers of time. Of course, all that you're really experiencing is a
 form of severe disorientation resulting from the unusual perceptual
 stimuli occurring outside normal time-space. It all goes away in a
 nothingth of a second, and you stumble backward to the floor of the
 StreamDive Core. White-clad technicians swarm into the chamber a second
 later, helping you into the postDive examination, which confirms that
 you have weathered the Dive intact, and cleanses ancient toxins from
 your system. Your possessions are taken for examination, and you are
 led to the debriefing room.

 StreamDive Debriefing room
 You are in a comfortably small room, used to debrief StreamDivers
 following their missions. The room is intentionally designed to avoid
 the impression that this is some kind of interrogation chamber, even if
 that is indeed its function. The room contains very little in the way
 of decoration or, well, anything at all, aside from the table and
 chairs.

 Mission Parameters

 StreamDiver Alpha Tango-678
 FYEO

 Clearance granted for immediate StreamDive. Target is local grid
 reference 0x1549. Temporal Reference 785278.7 UDC. We will be in phase
 for StreamDive at 865741.3 UDC. Dive duration not to exceed .5 units
 UDC (12 hours local time). Stream Capacitance field will be set for
 auto-recall at this time.
 Research unit indicates high levels of stream distortion in this zone,
 indicating that premature extraction may not be possible.

 Mission Summary: The purpose of your StreamDive is historical research.
 We have isolated an evacuated area to minimize potential corruption.
 You are to record all findings, but avoid direct contact with any
 inhabitants. Records from this zone are fragmentary, so any documents
 of historical interest should be added to your DataStore.

 *WARNING*
 Due to ambient radiation levels, wideband recall will not be available.
 Since StreamDive instruments are shielded against EMP effects, lost
 components may be recoverable after destruction of the local grid
 section. For this reason, level 1b restrictions are in effect for the
 duration of this dive.

 PLEASE REVIEW STREAMDIVER MANUAL BEFORE COMMENCING DIVE.

>go east
 [Once you leave this area, you will be unable to return. Are you
 certain that you are ready? Please note: there are still empty slots in
 your StreamDive console's chiprack.]

>examine console
 Your StreamDive console is a small display device designed to provide
 you with relevant information about the current dive, and allow access
 to key StreamDive facilities [Footnote 1]. These facilities are made
 available by adding chips to its five-slot chiprack. The chiprack
 currently contains four chips.

>search bank.
 In the chip bank are six chips (a DataStore chip, a dive chip, a map
 chip, a library chip, an artificial intuition chip and a scan chip).

>examine scan
 This chip provides an interface to the console's sensor functions.
 Commands Provided:
  SCAN -- Perform a detailed scan of the area
  SCAN X -- Scan an object

>examine map
 This chip provides real-time mapping of your current dive location.
 Commands Provided:
  MAP -- Display map

>examine intuition
 This chip contains the experimental "Artificial Intuition" chip. Its
 function is to evaluate the current situation and recommend a course of
 action.
 Commands Provided:
  HINT -- Recommend action

>put library into console
 You need to be holding the library chip before you can put it into
 something else.

>examine library
 This chip contains a library of data, tailored to your current mission
 parameters.
 Commands Provided:
  RESEARCH X -- Search library for given term
  BROWSE -- Display relevant entries

>get library
 Taken.

>put library into console
 You put the library chip into the StreamDive console.

>go east
 [Once you leave this area, you will be unable to return. Are you
 certain that you are ready?]

>yes
 You walk out of the Prep Room, down the long corridor, and into the
 Dive section. A number of sensors verify that you are carrying no
 contraband, and make a detailed record of your relevant bio-data, which
 is compared to your records to ensure that you are indeed the person
 scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record
 will be compared again when you emerge, to ensure that nothing
 important about your physiology has altered during the dive. The only
 visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.

 Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
 where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
 renders you free of micro-organisms.

 You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an
 indentation by the next door, where ultrasonic "needles" inject you
 with the requisite immunity boosters, which always gives you the
 pleasant feeling of being, at least temporarily, totally impregnable to
 disease.

 One more room, and anticipation would increase your heart-rate enough
 that a sensor might declare you medically unfit for duty. Fortunately,
 this room is the last.


 StreamDive Core
 You stand in the core of the StreamDive Temporal Relocation Unit. Far
 below you, an artificial singularity waits to propel you backward in
 history. The room itself is a huge dome, totally black, but lit from an
 unseeable source. There is always gooseflesh on your arms when you
 stand in this room. It is not a friendly room, not a relaxed room. This
 is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
 than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
 design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
 time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
 itself, neither part of the present nor the past.

 It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.
 A voice materializes from nowhere in particular. "StreamDiver Alpha
 Tango-678, StreamDive will commence in thirty seconds. Good luck, and
 Godspeed."

>wait
 Time passes.
 The floor fades to transparency. There is a brilliant point of light
 somewhere far below you. Scanning beams trace over your body. Below
 you, a perfect mirror image of yourself fades into existence, your
 avatar. You have a sinking feeling as your avatar falls toward the
 light. Just as you were trained, you roll back on the balls of your
 feet and close your eyes. In your head, you count to six. Deep down
 there, your avatar enters the event horizon of the artificial
 singularity. As always, you have the disconcerting sensation of
 falling...

 Cold.

 Hot.

 Bright.

 Dark.

 The pain is gone before you feel it. You want to open your eyes, but
 you know better. Even if you survived the experience, your sanity would
 not. You wait for the sensation of falling to end.

 It does.

 You wait for your perception of local timespace to return.

 It does.

 You open your eyes.


 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

>go east

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down,
 presumably to the basement.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

>go down

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 2], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

>go north

 Bathroom
 You get the impression that this bathroom has become a waystation for
 things that were intended for the basement, but got lost along the way.
 Boxes and bags seem to cover every surface; the sink, the heating vent,
 the fixture. The way out is south.

>open toilet
 On a whim, you lift the heavy boxes and raise the lid of the toilet
 seat. The bowl has been drained, and resting inside is a small book,
 which you manage, with some difficulty, to retrieve before letting the
 boxes fall back into place.

>open diary
 It's locked.

>unlock diary
 (with the autokey.)
 The lock clicks open. Your hands almost tremble in anticipation. What a
 find!

 You open the book...

 What?

 It's encoded? Who keeps a diary in code? Well, obviously, Julia Yvonne
 Wallace does. You can't help but wondering what could make someone so
 paranoid as to go to the trouble of encoding a locked, hidden diary.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine cryptography chip
 This chip contains the algorithms for all known cryptographic systems,
 as well as a heuristic to deal with unknown ciphers. Its function is to
 decipher encrypted or obfuscated text, or to render text into the most
 appropriate encrypted or obfuscated form.
 Commands Provided:
  ENCODE X -- Render input into appropriate ciphertext
  DECODE X -- Decipher input
  ANALYZE X -- Apply heuristics to input and display results

>decode diary

 April 18 - Jim's a bastard. He did it again. Snuck in while I was
 asleep and recalibrated my eye. When I woke up, I was seeing everything
 in infrared.

 Some days I want to rip the damned thing out with my bare hands.

 April 20 - Dreamt last night. The unbelievable pleasure of feeling a
 knife being thrust into my chest.

 Mom didn't take the bait. Maybe she's not still snooping on me.

 April 22 - They're sending troops into the middle east. Everyone says
 not to worry and we'll just clear this up like we have before. There's
 not going to be a war. But we've already got troops in so many other
 places. Jim's terrified that he's gonna get drafted. There hasn't been
 a draft in almost a hundred years though. The news says this will blow
 over in a couple of months, but Jimmy says that the president's an ass
 and he wants a war to boost his popularity rating. Dad thinks he's an
 idiot because no president would think that starting a war and getting
 hundreds of our people killed would make him popular. Maybe I should
 start reading the papers more.

 April 25 - Jim keeps going on about this new program he's working on.
 Thinks it's going to, and I quote, "set him up among the gods." He's
 trying to get in touch with a bunch of professors at the big-league CS
 schools. Thinks he's hot stuff. Dad, who really ought to know better,
 asked him about his new "discovery", and he went on for about an hour,
 not really saying anything that made much sense. The long and short of
 it is that he thinks he's figured out how his brain works, and he
 thinks he's got a way to make a computer do the same thing. Wonderful.
 A computer that thinks like my brother.

 May 6 - You are not fucking going to believe this. They've started up
 the draft. And what's more? They're not taking girls. I know, they've
 never taken them before, but they said that they would now, since
 they're all "liberated" and shit.

 Anyway, why aren't they taking girls, you ask? Well, there was a
 fucking commercial. A fucking commercial explaining how important women
 were to the war effort, and that's why they're not drafting them. And
 the way they're important to the war effort? You're gonna fucking love
 this -- reproduction. They're saying that it's "The duty of all
 citizens to make full use of their reproductive capabilities to ensure
 that our population remains strong and growing through these times of
 adversity."

 What is this, the fucking dark ages? In addition to their
 heart-fucking-felt sermon, they've voted in a massive tax-break for
 families with newborns, a government handout for women who get
 themselves pregnant, and subsidies for unmarried women who want
 artificial insemination. They're also rushing through a bunch of
 fertility drugs that increase the chances of having twins. The got some
 low-level flunkie in one of the fringe groups on record saying that it
 was the "sworn duty of every woman to attempt conception", and that
 parents should encourage their daughters to get themselves knocked up
 as young as fifteen. They're trying to fucking breed themselves an
 army.

>go north
 But it'll be what, twenty years before any of these war babies are old
 enough to fight. The war can't go on that long, can it?

 May 7 - Oh the shit has hit the fan. There's rioting in the streets.
 The people who don't like the war are protesting the war. The people
 who don't like the draft are protesting the draft. Pretty much everyone
 is protesting the breeding plan, except for the ones that are lined up
 around the block to get a big fat shot of fertility drugs and the big
 fat check that goes with it. Mom's friend that works for a doctor says
 that they've been asked not to tie anyone's tubes or give out
 contraceptives anymore. I found out that Jim's stockpiling condoms, on
 the off chance he manages to get a girl who doesn't think the rest of
 him's as ugly as his face. Says there's a bill in congress to restrict
 the sale of anything that prevents pregnancy.

 Donna's friend Rusty is talking about signing up. She's trying to talk
 him out of it, but he figures his draft notice is in the mail already
 anyway.

 May 11 - When I got up this morning, my eye hadn't recharged. Hope I
 don't have to get the damned thing serviced. I couldn't go anywhere, of
 course, because I had to leave it on the charger all day. But Donna
 came over and we hung out. She went out with Tom last night and had a
 good time and all.

>go north
 She thinks the eyepatch makes me look tough.

 May 12 - Eye worked today. Guess I had it in the charger wrong or
 something.

 May 13 - Donna's dad got "activated", which means he has to ship out.
 He does something technical for the navy, so it's not like he's going
 to the front or anything, but she's still scared. He wants her to go
 live with her grandmom. We talked to mom, and she said it would be okay
 if she stayed with us at least until the end of school. Her grandmom's
 an 80 year old woman with about a hundred cats.

 May 17 (later) - Fell asleep without taking my eye out so it's dead
 today. And no one ever told me how much it hurts if you sleep with
 contacts in. Told mom I was too sick to see the shrink today, which
 isn't far from the truth. I managed to get Donna down to her bed before
 mom went to wake her up for breakfast. As if we could eat. We crashed
 in my room most of the day so no one would see how sick we were.

>go north
 I let her get a good look at the hole in my face where my eye goes. She
 wasn't grossed out or anything. She asked me if I wanted to touch her
 scar. It was a little weird because you can feel little bumps where
 they stitched her cheek closed.

 May 19 - The fighting has escalated. Last night, one of our islands in
 the pacific got wiped off the map. That many people could just wink out
 of existence like that, and the world just goes on.

 May 20 - Rethinking yesterday's entry. We've been bombing the country
 with the largest population in the world for weeks now. Maybe we got
 what we deserved.

 the only boys that haven't been drafted are cripples and felons. And
 Rusty, of course, but I get the feeling he's looking to set up family
 ties with a nice boy himself.

 May 26 - Mom is moving most of the valuables into long-term storage. As
 in "make Jim go out in the woods and dig a deep hole to hide them in."
 Won't help. We're all going to die.

 May 31 - Donna didn't come home last night. She showed up late this
 afternoon with a lame story about spending the night at her place
 because she had gotten involved in packing some things.

 June 2 - Donna is still acting funny. I wonder if she's worried about
 her dad.

 June 3 - As close as I can tell, I'm a free woman again. Mom and Dad
 aren't watching me constantly, and I can pretty much come and go as I
 please, with the caveat that I can't stay out too long, what with the
 imminent possibility of he bomb killing us all.

 But I'm worried about Donna. She wanders off for hours at a time,
 doesn't say anything.

 June 4 - Jimmy's got himself a girlfriend. How cute. She's a
 rolly-polly little thing with coke-bottle glasses who thinks the sun
 rises and sets on him because of his brilliant invention. Maybe his
 stockpile won't go to waste after all.

 Yeah. And maybe my eye will grow back.

 before?

 June 9 - Donna asked me to try on some of her clothes. I don't like
 wearing a skirt, but she said I have really nice legs & I should show
 them off. Nice legs? Anyway, I hope this means she's feeling better,
 but there was something distant about her. About the only thing she was
 willing to talk about was the time I slit my wrists. Morbid.

 June 10 - Rained all day today. After watching a whole lot of TV, we
 basically just sat around. I worked on new pages for my code book while
 Donna just sat there and watched me.

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 2], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

>go down
 That door is locked.

>yes

 Okay [Footnote 3].

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Basement
 The basement of this house is a simple, large room with cinderblock
 walls. Boxes, crates, and other large items are scattered haphazardly
 about. A lightweight wooden door in the east wall appears to be an
 exterior exit, presumably to allow heavy gardening equipment, such as
 the lawnmower in one corner, to be removed. The stairs up to the rest
 of the house are along the south wall.
 And something unusual. The west wall is metal, with a very large,
 robust door set in it.
 It couldn't be. Or could it? You've never actually seen one before, but
 from your records...
 Yes. It is. It's a bomb shelter; a small room specially designed to act
 as an emergency shelter in the event of nuclear attack. None have
 survived to your own time, and records are fragmentary. This is quite a
 find. If only you could manage to get inside.

>unlock shelter
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

>unlock metal door
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

>go west
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Bomb Shelter
 This is career-making stuff. A period survival shelter, fully intact
 and operational. The ceiling and walls form a single-piece dome, which,
 you recall, increased the structural stability with the building
 materials they had available. The eastern end, nearest the exit, seems
 to be some kind of living area, with a table and several chairs. Past
 it, you can see four bunked beds. At the far end of the shelter is a
 curtained area, holding the minimal sanitation facilities.

 Finally, your training releases its hold over your mind and lets you
 take notice of what would have been the first thing anyone but a
 StreamDiver would see. Two female bodies, quite motionless, lie on one
 of the beds. You don't need to check for a pulse on either of them
 [Footnote 4], but you do, all the same.

 Still warm. Your hands tremble, and it takes a moment to force yourself
 to calm down. You've seen dead bodies before, on missions. Victims of
 the massacre on Mars Colony Omega, ritual sacrifice victims in an Aztec
 temple, but the immediacy of these deaths is something you weren't
 prepared for. They can't have been dead for more than a few hours, may
 even have died while you were in the house. You try to tell yourself
 that this is an irrelevant detail -- from your proper perspective,
 they, and everyone else on the planet, have been dead for hundreds of
 years.

 It doesn't help.

 The smashed and broken pieces of some electronic device are scattered
 around the room.

 A small metal box is mounted on one wall.

 On the table are an electronic device and a portable computer.

 The StreamDive console is programmed to emit an alert if it is brought
 into an occupied room.

>examine bodies
 left corpse: She would have grown up to be quite attractive. For that
 matter, she actually was quite attractive, despite the disheveled
 appearance and short unruly tangle of red hair. One eyelid is sunken,
 as if there is nothing underneath. You can see no sign of injury, and
 her repose is fairly tranquil.

 Wait. There is something. One hand is scratched badly across the
 knuckles. But that couldn't be the cause of death.
 right corpse: The body lies on the bed, arms folded. Its owner is quite
 beautiful by the standards of the day, long, blonde hair, sizable
 breasts, and a frailty that suggests borderline anorexia. The only mar
 to her beauty is a deep, jagged scar on one cheek. There is nothing to
 suggest that her death was anything but peaceful [Footnote 5].

 not, generally, drop dead suddenly.

 Remarkable. This is an LZ-50 prosthetic optical unit, the first
 commercial replacement eye. This explains the sunken eyelid on the poor
 dead girl -- she must have had a prosthetic eye. But this... You could
 stand here all day and admire the workmanship. You would never have
 suspected that the technology of this period could develop something
 that could actually replace a human eye. And here you are... it's in
 your hand. You turn it over and over. It looks amazingly realistic.

 Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
 Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
 Possibly the darkest period in recent history, this period contains the
 last and largest of the intercontinental wars. Several Middle Eastern
 nations formed a military alliance, and began imposing expansionist
 policies on neighboring countries. When the United States threatened to
 cut off trade relations with these countries, the formed a lucrative
 trade alliance with China. Because during this period, industrialized
 nations were still highly dependent on fossil fuel, an alliance of
 western nations declared war on China and the Arabic alliance. Tactical
 nuclear warheads were used by both sides, resulting in the near-total
 annihilation of many US-sympathetic countries in southeast Asia. Though
 US nuclear weapons were unable to breach Chinese countermeasures,
 several Chinese nuclear missiles did penetrate the US defensive system,
 obliterating a number of cities. The war was finally ended when the
 massive space station Kennedy crashed to Earth near the Chinese
 capital. The resulting explosion killed over two billion people,
 forcing the Chinese government to capitulate. However, widespread
 environmental and war damage left the entire world badly crippled.
 Reconstruction would take much of the next century, and the extensive
 costs of rebuilding the damaged world forced the beginning of
 governmental alliances that would eventually lead to a United Earth
 Government.

 Your mission occurs during the opening of the nuclear phase of the war.
 At 785278.83 UDC, a missile launched from China will exploit the breach
 in the US missile shield. Nine hours later, its course will be diverted
 away from Washington, DC to avoid US countermeasures. It will narrowly
 miss a secondary target, several miles from your Dive site, at 865741.8
 UDC.

 We were supposed to do it together. That was the plan.

 We thought it through, talked about it over and over.

 Nothing else made any sense. The safety broke down. The door isn't
 going to open for thirty years. We can't just stay down here for thirty
 years. And what about her? We can't take care of that on our own.

 Still, we might have tried. We might have been able to work something
 out. But we haven't heard anything upstairs for days. Not that you can
 hear much, but sometimes there's a little banging in the pipes.

 That damned radio. My hand's all cut up from smashing it to bits.
 There's going to be an air strike. They don't know where yet, but there
 isn't any way to stop it. We're less than a hundred miles from the
 biggest military base in three states. Even if we survive, no one's
 going to find us. No one's going to save us.

 So we decided. I unlocked the box. I took out two pills...

 This is all my fault. If I hadn't been so damned paranoid, we wouldn't
 even be down here. It's my fault that Donna's dead. It's my fault that
 I'm going to be dead.

 We were going to do it together. We laid down on the bed, next to each
 other, and she hugged me, and she told me she didn't blame me, and then
 we were going to bite down at the same time and it would all be over.

 I'm such a fucking coward.

 I don't think she felt anything. I hope she didn't know what a coward I
 am. She closed her eyes, and I closed mine, and then she just sort of
 shook once, and it was over. And I got up, and I laid her out flat and
 crossed her arms over her chest.

 What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't want to live. I never cared if
 I lived or died since the accident six years ago, and I sure as hell
 don't want to live down here for the next thirty years, especially now
 that Donna's gone. I tried to kill myself once before. All I have to do
 is bite down.

 So why won't my hands stop shaking? I'm going to do it now. For real
 this time.

 I'm not getting back into the same bed with Donna. I don't deserve
 that.

 I hope my parents will forgive me. I hope Jim will forgive me. Most of
 all, though, I hope Donna will forgive me.

 Goodbye.

 Basement
 The basement of this house is a simple, large room with cinderblock
 walls. Boxes, crates, and other large items are scattered haphazardly
 about. A lightweight wooden door in the east wall appears to be an
 exterior exit, presumably to allow heavy gardening equipment, such as
 the lawnmower in one corner, to be removed. The stairs up to the rest
 of the house are along the south wall.
 And something unusual. The west wall is metal, with a very large,
 robust door set in it.
 The house shakes hard as a something, probably an aircraft or small
 bomb, crashes to earth in the distance.

 The stack of boxes teeters unsteadily. Another shake like that could
 bring all of these down on top of you.

>go up

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 2], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

>go up

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

 Dear Julia,
 I hope to God you get this letter. We waited for you as long as we
 could, but they're saying that the bombs could fall any day. There's a
 shelter out in New Calvert, we're going there. Daddy says its the
 safest place in a hundred miles. Try to get there if you can, but don't
 take any risks. The most important thing is that you stay safe. I left
 some money and your grandmom's jewels in the hidden place for you. Your
 dad bought a gun and bullets, and put them there too, but be careful.
 We all love you and hope to see you again.

 Love,

>go up

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>go east

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 This image shows a young man in his mid-teens. He sports a pathetic
 attempt at a moustache. Though he shows all the awkwardness of
 adolescence, he apparently does know, at least, how to pose for a
 photograph. He has a very slight smile, and a look of interested
 curiosity on his face. He does show the awkward pockmarks of severe
 acne, made worse by the extreme fullness of his face. He is wearing a
 black shirt with a suede vest, which bears a small lapel pin, of the
 sort distributed by academic honor societies.

 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 6], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 7]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.
 Somewhere, probably a few kilometers away, there is an explosion. The
 house rocks, and you have a hard time keeping your footing.

 You hear a great crash below.
>put eye in charger
 You let the optical unit charge for a few minutes. When you remove it,
 it's warm to the touch. Hm. The device seems to think that the eye is
 fully charged. That doesn't make sense; this charger is supposed to, if
 your memory serves, take several hours. There's no way that the
 technology of this period could build a charger capable of such speed.

>interface eye

 The viewpoint of the camera suggests that the wearer is seated in front
 of a portable computer. Her hand reaches out and picks up a small
 device beside the computer. She turns it over, presumably examining it
 from all angles. The hand turns the device until its barrel-end points
 directly into the camera. A finger twitches, pressing a button. A flash
 of light issues from the end of the device, and the image flickers,
 distorts, and breaks up.

 When the image returns, the device has been dropped to the table. The
 wearer stands, and the camera reels in unsteady ascent. Again a hand
 reaches out, this time to switch the computer off. It takes a small red
 pill from the table, and then moves to the wearer's mouth.

 The camera turns quickly, and moves toward one of the bunked beds. It
 focuses on the motionless body of a beautiful blonde girl. The image
 switches to infrared, showing the characteristic cooling of a recently
 deceased body, then the camera changes back to the visual spectrum. The
 camera bobs up and down, as if slowly nodding. It moves toward the face
 of the dead girl, and stays very close to one cheek for a long time.
 The camera withdraws, and the wearer extends a hand, tracing the
 shoulder and arm of the corpse, finally coming to rest atop the folded
 hands. The wearer's hand squeezes the dead hands once, then the camera
 turns toward the opposite cot.

 The camera moves toward the cot, then turns and lowers, finally
 pitching back as the wearer lies down. A hand moves toward the camera,
 and as it passes in front of it, the recording ends.

>examine charger
 Some kind of electronic charging apparatus. It is designed to hold a
 small spheroid object, which, presumably, would store electricity
 routed to it by the receptacle. You look at it more closely... It could
 be... No... Hm... Yes. It's the charging unit for an Optitron LZ-model
 prosthetic eye. As you recall, this was the first consumer-model
 bionetic replacement, a revolutionary medical advance that restored
 sight to countless injured persons. It would pave the way to a whole
 line of medical implant technology.

>research charger
 No relevant entry found.
 Something blocks the light for a second, and you turn to look. Nothing.
 Hm. This place is starting to get to you.

>research optitron
 No relevant entry found.

>examine dollhouse
 A scale model of a late Victorian home. It appears to be in a state of
 some disrepair, probably abandoned when its owner outgrew it.

>examine vent
 Forced air environmental control... You've heard of this. It's a system
 which controlled the temperature in a building via the crude method of
 pumping air of the desired temperature through a system of metal tubes
 toward various areas of the house. It's an interesting system, neither
 very efficient, nor robust, but it did allow the most cost-effective
 means of controlling interior climate available in this era.

>examine desk
 This is a fairly small desk, essentially little more than a table. The
 desk is tightly packed with office supplies and other sundries

>search desk
 There is nothing on the desk.

>examine sundries
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

>examine chest
 You can't see inside, since the chest is closed.

>open chest
 You open the chest, revealing a glass eye and an eyepatch.

>examine glass eye
 This is a hemispherical piece of colored glass, with a hook at the
 back. It looks to be the sort of "eye" found on stuffed toys.

>examine eyepatch
 A covering of stiff cloth, designed to cover a damaged eye. This may
 well be part of a costume, as at this time period, prosthetic
 replacements were the preferred means of concealing a permanently
 damaged eye.

>examine bed
 You see nothing special about the bed.

>look under bed
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine watercolor
 Watercolor seems to be an inappropriate choice for the subject matter,
 but watercolor is, of course, much easier to work with than oil paints.
 The picture shows a serene lake, what should be a quaint scene of
 pastoral bliss. But the colors don't fit well with the subject. Though
 dark colors are largely absent, a few areas suggest that this is due
 purely to the painting's incomplete state. At the center of picture,
 without enough detail to recognize at first glance, is the disturbing
 figure of a drowning victim. Trails of unpainted canvas might form what
 might be a burial shroud around the figure, still lacking enough in
 detail to discern the gender. The figure's arms are spread wide, in
 what is still called the "Dead Man's Float".

 Most of the dark areas, and, indeed one or two of the light areas, are
 unfinished. The overwhelming historical likelihood is that they will
 remain that way.

>examine eye
 (the prosthetic eye)
 Remarkable. This is an LZ-50 prosthetic optical unit, the first
 commercial replacement eye. This explains the sunken eyelid on the poor
 dead girl -- she must have had a prosthetic eye. But this... You could
 stand here all day and admire the workmanship. You would never have
 suspected that the technology of this period could develop something
 that could actually replace a human eye. And here you are... it's in
 your hand. You turn it over and over. It looks amazingly realistic.

>scan watercolor
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>look in vent
 The vent is empty.

>examine closet
 This house has many doors. Very few of them are worthy of note
 [Footnote 8].
 This particular door is a sliding one, secured by a brass lock.

>go east
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Walk-in Closet
 From the architecture of the house, you can tell that this is the only
 bedroom to have its own walk-in closet, which no doubt was an issue of
 some discussion when bedrooms were assigned. The majority of the closet
 is taken up by clothing, but you can see a few boxes toward the back.

>examine clothing
 The closet is full of clothing. Most of it is fairly gender-neutral;
 it's only under close examination that you can discern that the bulky
 black clothing is indeed sized for a young woman. Only one or two items
 are more distinctly feminine.

>examine boxes
 You see nothing special about the boxes.

>search clothing
 You find nothing of interest.

>open boxes
 You open each box, finding nothing of note. However, pushing a box to
 the side, you discover a thin composition book, which had been secreted
 between two of the boxes.

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 April 17 - Mom found my diary and read it. I'm ashamed at how I acted.
 I'm very angry at her for invading my privacy, but I understand that
 she's just worried about me.

 She doesn't want me to see CJ anymore because he's a bad influence. I
 guess I see her point, but I really care about him.

 I have to start seeing a therapist again. Maybe he will help me feel
 better about myself.

 April 18 - Jimmy pulled a prank on me. It was mean. I didn't tell mom,
 but I hope she finds out and punishes him.

 April 19 - Met with the doctor today. It was really good to talk with
 someone.

 April 21 - We had lima beans with dinner tonight. I hate lima beans.

 April 22 - It looks like there's going to be a war. I'm really scared.

 April 24 - I saw my old friend Donna today. I hope I get to talk to
 her. She's nice. It would be good to have a friend again.

 April 25 - Jimmy has some new idea for a computer program. I wish I was
 that smart. Maybe he'll get rich and famous.

 April 26 - I saw the doctor again. I think I'm making progress.

 April 27 - I had a nightmare about the accident last night. I remember
 Donna's mom screaming when the guy ran that red light. The car got hit
 on Donna's side, so she's so lucky just to be alive. I wouldn't have
 been hurt at all if I'd had my seat belt on. I got thrown over top of
 Donna when the car spun around and landed face down on what was left of
 her window. I remember Donna screaming for her mom, because she was out
 cold, but I don't remember doing anything myself. Just laying there
 with a big piece of glass through my eye.

 April 29 - The fighting keeps getting worse in china and the middle
 east.
 April 30 - I got to talk to Donna. She's doing well, but she lives with
 her dad now. I invited her over to dinner tomorrow. Hope mom doesn't
 mind. I wanted to talk to her longer but mom worries if I don't get
 home right away after school.

 May 1 - Mom made her "famous" squash stuffing with pork chops. I like
 it better with steak. Jimmy made himself look bad by asking her about
 the scar she has from the accident. After dinner we talked and did
 homework. She's a much better friend than CJ.

 May 2 - I have to decide what to do about college. Mom doesn't want me
 to go away. Since my grades weren't good enough to get into a good
 school, I guess it doesn't make much difference. I'm not smart like
 Jimmy.

 May 3 - I told the doctor that I was afraid because of the war, and how
 bad I feel about my eye. He showed me some exercises to not get so hung
 up on it. Seems kind of silly, but I'll give it a shot.

 May 4 - Donna and I went SHOPPING! I love shopping. I really lost out
 not having any girl friends for so long. Donna talked me into buying
 this little pink top and a floral mini that she said makes me look
 cute. I guess it's good for me to start dressing like a girl again
 instead of all the black frumpy things I always wear. It was kind of a
 low cut shirt though. Donna said she wished she could get away with
 wearing something like that, which is kind of a nice way of saying that
 I'm flat.

 May 5 - I really wish I had Frankie the Bear back. I miss him.

 May 6 - * They're drafting. I'm scared that Jimmy will get picked. They
 made a lot of other announcements about wanting women to start having
 more babies. That sounds really stupid. I bet there's going to be a lot
 of fighting about that.

 May 7 - And there was. Mom took me aside today and asked me what I
 would think if she and Daddy tried to have another baby. I don't think
 she should, since things might get bad with the war. She doesn't like
 the way that everyone's trying to railroad women into having more
 babies, but she says that if too many people get killed, it won't be
 good for the future.

 May 8 - Donna met a new guy named Tom. I think he's nice. It's good for
 her to be dating someone

 May 9 - Dad cooked something new with lots of sprouts. Sprouts are
 supposed to be healthy, but doesn't it cancel them out if you fry them?

 May 10 - I saw the doctor. I don't think we got to anything new. There
 was something funny about him, like he kept wanting to tell me
 something but never got up the nerve.

 May 11 - My eye didn't work today. Daddy got all upset and shouted
 about crummy workmanship. Mom thought I should go out to the mall with
 Donna anyway, but I don't like people seeing me with my eyepatch so we
 just stayed in.

 May 12 - It worked today. Daddy told me to clean the charger and be
 more careful.

 May 13 - Donna's dad is going off to serve in the navy. Mom says she
 can stay with us until the end of school, since she can't stay with her
 mom. I'm glad.

 May 14 - There's a party friday for the boys who are going to war. Mom
 says I can't go. It's not fair.

 May 15 - Happy Birthday! Mom changed her mind about the party, since
 I'm 18 now and she says I can be trusted to make my own decisions. I
 got some nice stuff. Donna's boyfriend got drafted, and she's really
 upset.

 May 17 - The party wasn't much fun so we left early. Good thing since
 we're kind of sick today.

 May 18 - The war keeps getting worse. I wish they'd just find a
 peaceful answer.

 May 19 - Donna wanted some fun so we tried on each other's clothes.
 We're about the same size, but her boobs are bigger, so some of the
 stuff fit funny.

 May 20 - The war keeps getting worse. Some kids at school are saying
 that they might start bombing the US, but daddy says that there's a big
 electronic shield that stops bombs from getting through.

 May 21 - I had a nightmare about the bombs dropping.

 May 22 - School seems so empty. Lots of guys in my class got drafted.

 May 24 - The doctor said some stuff I didn't like. I told mom about it
 and she told me I didn't have to go anymore.

 May 27 - The air raid drills in school are kind of weird. I don't think
 hiding under a desk will really help. But it did get us out of third
 period.

 May 28 - * Almost a week early. I'm usually a metronome.

 May 30 - Not feeling very good. Yeech.

 May 31 - I'm worried about Donna. She seems upset all the time.

 June 1 - I'm not having a good day. But Donna looks like I feel. Hope
 she gets over it.

 June 4 - I heard Jimmy making out with his "study partner" last night.
 I guess it's good he's got a girlfriend.

 June 5 - There isn't going to be a graduation this year. Why does my
 class always get the short end of the stick?

 June 6 - I'm still worried about Donna.

 June 8 - Okay. I know I shouldn't have, but I listened at the vent
 while Jimmy was in his room with his girlfriend. Get this. He was more
 or less begging her for sex. He kept making appeals to how we could all
 die at any time with the war. Sounds like pillow talk to me.

 June 9 - We got news from the front that one of the guys who graduated
 a year ago and enlisted back then got killed in Vietnam. There's a
 service Monday.

 June 11 - Lazy day.

 June 12 - I think the rolly-polly girl gave in.

 Donna's worse than ever. But we're going to a party tonight at Rusty's,
 which should cheer her up.

 June 15 - Jimmy finally worked out that you could hear into my room by
 listening at the vent. He overheard a private conversation between me
 and Donna. Guess we can't talk freely in my room any more.

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 Nook
 You are in a small room which you suspect has no fixed purpose. There
 is a table in the center of the room, with a faux-wooden chair at it,
 and a long bench-seat under the window. The door along the north wall
 has been removed, presumably in an attempt to turn the room into some
 sort of work alcove.

>examine bench-seat
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

 It's safer to steer clear of windows, just in case.

>bench
 You can't see inside, since the bench seat is closed.

>open bench
 You open the bench seat, revealing a sewing machine, some fabric, a
 needle, some thread, a scissors and a magnetic handle.

>examine handle
 It looks like a rather small knob, containing a small magnet. You've
 seen the general design before, used as a release for child-safety
 latches.

>take handle
 Taken.

>take scissors
 Taken.

>examine sewing machine
 Essentially, this is a sort of automated needle and thread. It is a
 hobbyist's version of the sort of machinery used to make most garments
 of this time. By repeatedly thrusting a threaded needle through a piece
 of fabric, it is able to quickly make a variety of stitches. Though in
 your own time, tailoring is usually done by laser-guided polymer
 injection, the basic principles remain more or less unchanged.

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway

 Boy's Bedroom
 Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
 of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
 course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
 more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
 that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
 that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
 one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
 books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
 The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
 the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
 appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway

 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

 Back Hallway
 A poorly-lit length of hallway begins here and continues west. The
 southern wall is open to the living room. A door leads east.

 A painting on the wall depicts a nautical theme.

 Powder Room
 You are in a very small bathroom, fitted out as you would expect, in a
 pastel decor. A number of decorative touches lead you to surmise that
 this bathroom was intended primarily for guests. A gentle breeze issues
 from a vent high on one wall. The exit is west.

 On the fixture is a scientific journal.

>look in vent

>examine journal
 This is a magazine whose articles showcase current events in the
 scientific community. It is written to a target audience of educated,
 but not scientifically trained, readers.
 You browse through the magazine, looking for anything of interest. You
 are not disappointed. There is a short article, all the way at the
 back, summarizing the doctoral thesis of one Emmanuel Kaldeki.
 This is quite a find; Kaldeki's original thesis has long been lost, and
 it has long been assumed that he had not pursued the line of research
 that would eventually lead to StreamDive technology until after the
 war. You read the article...

 Physicist Emmanuel Kaldeki created a buzz in the scientific world early
 this month with the delivery of his PhD thesis, "Mathematical Modeling
 of Non-Temporal Quantum Particles" at the Pacific Institute of
 Technology. The paper describes a set of mathematical formulae which
 model a theoretical particle called "Q-omega". The Q-omega particle,
 according to Kaldeki's model, behaves in most respects like a
 strange-matter quark, but also exhibits properties previously only
 modeled in tachyons. Specifically, it reacts in unusual ways to
 space-time curvature. The Kaldeki model suggests that that at
 relativistic velocities, the Q-omega particle would "plane" on highly
 curved space-time, in much the same way that the hull of a speed boat
 planes over water.

 Most of the excitement over Kaldeki's paper comes not from the modeling
 technique itself, but from the two major example models included. The
 first demonstrates how the non-temporal nature of the Q-omega particle
 renders it immune from the effects of time and mass dilation occurring
 at speeds near that of light. Indeed, because of their unique nature,
 the model shows that Q-omega particles can be accelerated above the
 speed of light, a possibility generally disallowed by the theory of
 relativity.

 The second, and more impressive example studies the behavior of Q-omega
 in the vicinity of a black hole. Under such extreme space-time
 curvature, Kaldeki predicts that the Q-omega particle would completely
 disassociate itself with conventional space-time, being displaced along
 a predictable path to some distant point in the universe
 instantaneously. Because the path of the particle does not go through
 space-time during this journey, it is possible for Q-omega to re-enter
 normal space at a point in time prior to its departure.

 The scientific community is excited about the implications of this
 theory: several researchers have suggested that Kaldeki's findings may
 open the way to faster-than-light travel, matter transmission, and time
 travel. Asked about these possibilities, Kaldeki said, "I think it's a
 bit early to start talking about applications; we don't even know yet
 if the particles I've modeled can be created. There's nothing in the
 mathematics that would prohibit [these applications], but actually
 doing it is a long way off. You've got to remember, we're talking about
 sub-atomic particles, and if we could scale the effect to something the
 size of, say, a man, it's not very likely that a living creature could
 survive being moved around like that."

 Kaldeki has received a grant for an undisclosed amount to pursue the
 fabrication of these particles. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy in
 Quantum Physics will be conferred upon Emmanuel Kaldeki by the Pacific
 Institute of Technology during commencement exercises next month.

 The indicator light switches from blue to green. The thought occurs to
 you that this is an exceptionally bad color choice for someone who,
 like you, suffers from a mild genetic deficit in the color perception
 department. However, you've been around long enough to be familiar with
 the change in hue that indicates clearance for a StreamDive.

 Your elation is such that it takes you a few seconds to respond to the
 indicator -- a critical error, though not a fatal one. You touch the
 control, and are further pleased to find that your mission hasn't been
 scrapped due to your moment of indecision. The full text of your
 mission description appears on the display...

 StreamDiver Prep Room
 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the
 field, and hope that one of your mission proposals will be accepted. On
 the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this
 room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations. The
 exit is east.

 The display monitor stands against one wall, your mission description
 visible on its screen.

 You can also see an equipment locker (closed) here.

 Powder Room
 You are in a very small bathroom, fitted out as you would expect, in a

 this bathroom was intended primarily for guests. A gentle breeze issues
 from a vent high on one wall. The exit is west.

 On the fixture is a scientific journal.

 Back Hallway
 A poorly-lit length of hallway begins here and continues west. The
 southern wall is open to the living room. A door leads east.

 A painting on the wall depicts a nautical theme.

 Behind the Stairs
 The ceiling over this stretch of hallway slopes upward where the stairs
 cut into it. Along the south wall, just before the ceiling becomes too
 low to make a serviceable hallway, a low, louvered door marks a small
 closet. The hallway continues east, and to the west it ends in an
 archway leading to the dining room.

>open door
 It seems to be locked.

 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>unlock door with autokey
 You open the little closet, revealing a coaxial cable, a stuffed bear,
 four video discs (one "Womb Raider", one "Blow me Away", one "Coeds
 Getting Naked" and one "Thrustmaster Returns") and some adult
 magazines.

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

>go west

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

>go up

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>go west

 Hallway, west end
 The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point
 of view. You can see where the stairway meets the hall to the east, and
 doors are located along the north, south, and west walls.

 A framed photograph of a young woman graces one wall.

>unlock south door

 Unlocked.

>go south

 Sealed Room
 You are in a small, dark room that appears to have been unused for
 years. The only feature worth noting is a wooden ladder which leads to
 an opening in the ceiling. The exit is north.

>go up

 Attic
 There is barely enough room to stand upright in the attic. It certainly
 looks too small to be of much use for storage. It's nearly impossible
 to move without clocking yourself on a supporting beam.

 You can see an unlabeled data disc here.

>take disc

>scan
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine beam
 These beams hold up the roof of the house.

>search beam
 You can't see inside, since the supporting beams is closed.

>open beam
 You open the supporting beams, revealing a gun, some cash, a necklace
 and a ring.

>take all from beam
 gun: Removed.
 cash: Removed.
 necklace: Removed.
 ring: Removed.

>examine ring
 A circle of precious metal, set with carefully carved stones.

>examine necklace
 This is an exquisite chain, made of a soft metal. You don't recognize
 the design, and think that it pre-dates your period of interest.

>examine cash
 Though in this time, most transactions were handled electronically, it
 won't be for at least a decade yet that physical currency is finally
 phased out. These small paper slips are printed with various patriotic
 imagery, and bear numbers which correspond to amounts. You don't recall
 exactly what the values correspond to in terms of actual buying power,
 but from the quantity, you can only assume that it is a substantial
 amount.

>examine gun
 It is completely unbelievable how much craftsmanship mankind once put
 into means of killing. This is only a very small pistol, but it is
 elaborately crafted, fashioned as if style was as important as
 function. All the same, it's still a device whose single purpose is the
 extinguishing of human life, and that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

>go down

 Sealed Room
 You are in a small, dark room that appears to have been unused for

 Boy's Bedroom
 Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
 of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
 course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
 more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
 that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
 that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
 one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
 books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
 The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
 the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
 appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

 Boy's Bedroom

>examine computer
 You stop a while an examine the contents of the desk. Almost the entire
 surface of the desk is covered by an eclectic combination of both
 state-or-the-art and antique computer equipment. You find it hard to
 tear yourself away; At least a decade of computing history is spread
 out before you. You can't even identify all of the systems; the
 fixed-form text input device is easy enough, but there is a small,
 vaguely rodent-shaped device whose purpose is less clear. There are a
 number of external storage systems, rather than the single optical chip
 interface common in your time.

 [You still have time remaining in this Dive. Are you sure you wish to
 end your Dive early?]

>yes
 All at once, the universe goes away. Time itself cries out in distress,
 and every cell in your body echoes its cry. The laws of physics cannot
 be broken, but they can be bent, if only for a time. As the energy
 stored in your temporal capacitors discharges, time reasserts itself.
 If you were the sort to anthopomorphize physical law, you'd say that it
 was extracting some revenge against you for daring to transcend the
 barriers of time. Of course, all that you're really experiencing is a
 form of severe disorientation resulting from the unusual perceptual
 stimuli occurring outside normal time-space. It all goes away in a
 nothingth of a second, and you stumble backward to the floor of the
 StreamDive Core. White-clad technicians swarm into the chamber a second
 later, helping you into the postDive examination, which confirms that
 you have weathered the Dive intact, and cleanses ancient toxins from
 your system. Your possessions are taken for examination, and you are
 led to the debriefing room.

 StreamDive Debriefing room
 You are in a comfortably small room, used to debrief StreamDivers
 following their missions. The room is intentionally designed to avoid
 the impression that this is some kind of interrogation chamber, even if
 that is indeed its function. The room contains very little in the way
 of decoration or, well, anything at all, aside from the table and
 chairs.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>sit on chair
 You get onto the wooden chair.

>wait
 Time passes.
 You stand as Joxley Douzen walks heavily into the room. Though there
 are a few agents you'd prefer to serve as your evaluator, you could
 have done far, far worse. She scans over her notes, not seeming to see
 you until after she has taken her seat. "Welcome back," she says. You
 are naturally inclined to take the lack of feeling in her voice as a
 bad sign, but you resist the urge. It's all she's capable of; her voice
 box is artificial, and she's never managed to program it properly.

 "We've reviewed your findings. As you know, the purpose of this phase
 of your evaluation is to give you the opportunity to present anything
 you think may have escaped our attention, and to address any concerns
 which the evaluation team has about your Dive. If you'll take your
 seat, we can begin." [Footnote 6]

>footnote 6
 [Footnote 6]
 For the duration of this interview, you may respond to Douzen by typing
 a single word at the command prompt, signifying the subject you wish to
 discuss. For example:
 Would be interpreted as a desire to talk about the kitchen. For
 questions requiring a numerical answer, simply type the number at the

 On the wooden chair is Joxley Douzen.
 Joxley looks up from her notes. "Or you can stand, if you prefer," she
 says.

 "First things first. Based on your scans and our records, you surveyed
 about seventy-six percent of the area within your mission boundaries.
 I'm sure you could have done better. Now, are there any rooms in
 particular that you feel merit special attention?"

>pantry
 "Hm... I'll advise the assessment team to take another look, but I
 think we've already considered that room thoroughly."

>boy's bedroom
 "Yes. Your console recorded some unusual readings from that area. We'll
 give it another look."

>bunker
 Joxley raises an eyebrow, apparently not understanding you. "If you
 don't have anything meaningful to say on the current subject, just say
 the word and we'll move on."

>shelter
 "There's enough in your records to support the possibility that there
 was a survival shelter in the residence. Unfortunately, you don't
 appear to have gained access to it."

>done
 "Very well," Joxley says. She begins examining her notes.

>examine joxley
 Joxley Douzen is a typical example of what your father would have
 called a "hard-looking broad". Muscular, stocky, with chiseled features
 that would have been distinguished on a man. She probably knows exactly
 how threatening people find her. You know that she's a touch bitter
 about her position as a Dive evaluation agent -- after she was injured
 in a shuttle accident, she received enough bio-mechanical implants to
 make her a walking, talking anachronism, and therefore unfit for
 StreamDiving. Nevertheless, your experience of her has always been as a
 fair evaluator.

>sit on chair
 You get onto the wooden chair.
 "Okay. Now, let's consider the contents of your DataStore. It seems
 that you recorded seventeen documents. It's a shame you didn't elect to
 take the Stream Visualizer. Of course, you were under tight
 restrictions. As for other documents, you collected a reasonable
 number.

 "Now, you found a diary in the downstairs bathroom. It appears to have
 been encoded using a very secure cipher. Given the nature of the writer
 and its content, the only explanation we can think of is that the
 writer was mentally unstable. How would you explain the fact that such
 effort was taken to encode the diary?"

>mother
 You explain that the author, Julia Wallace, had reason to believe that
 her parents were reading her diary without permission, and had encoded
 it to prevent the highly personal content from becoming public
 knowledge.
 Joxley raises an eyebrow. "It seems like a great deal of effort, but
 yes, that does explain what we've seen, and seems consistent with the
 details we've managed to piece together about the girl.

 "We've had some difficulty making sense of the code fragment you
 downloaded. Any idea what it is?"

>no
 That was a rhetorical question.

>answer no
 (to Joxley Douzen)
 You know better than to deviate from the standard procedure during an
 interview.

>experiment
 Joxley raises an eyebrow, apparently not understanding you. "If you
 don't have anything meaningful to say on the current subject, just say
 the word and we'll move on."

>done
 "I'm sorry to hear that.

 "I think that covers all the documents we need more information about.
 Let me check my notes, and we'll move on."

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.
 Joxley makes a few notes, then looks up. "All right then. Now we get to
 some more specific questions.

 "I suppose we should start with the most obvious. Your Dive was
 restricted to a family residence. How many people occupied this
 residence prior to its evacuation?"

>5
 Joxley raises an eyebrow. "Five? You're sure? Our research suggested
 only four residents. Who was this fifth person?"

>Donna
 You explain that a young woman named Donna, a friend of the older
 child, had been living with the family near the time that the house was
 abandoned.

 Joxley makes a note of this. "Good work. This is exactly the sort of
 thing that isn't covered by our records of the period.

 "What was the name of the female head of household?"

 "What was the name of the male head of household?"

>james
 "What was the name of the male child?"

 "Marital relations between the Wallaces... Were they good or bad?"

>good
 "What was the name of the female child?"

>julia
 "You say that the girl had an optical prosthesis. Which eye was
 artificial?"

>right
 "Okay," Joxley says.

 "Now," Joxley says, "It appears that you violated your mission
 parameters by bringing something back from your Dive. Since everything
 in the area appears to have been destroyed immediately after you left,
 the committee has decided to recommend against disciplinary action, but
 there will be an entry made in your file, unless you can give us some
 exceptional circumstance which warranted your action. Is there any
 object which you felt had some extraordinary reason for being retrieved
 for examination?

>oops
 That can't be corrected.

>done
 "Then we'll move on," Joxley says.

 "We have no postwar records of the daughter, and your findings suggest
 that she was not with the family when they evacuated. What became of
 her?"

>shelter
 You explain that she and her friend were trapped in the survival
 shelter, and perished with its destruction.

 "Thank you for your cooperation, agent," she says. After taking a few
 more notes, Joxley Douzen rises to her feet. "If you'll wait here, the
 review team will have your final evaluation shortly."

 Without paying you another glance, she strides out of the room.

 You are in a comfortably small room, used to debrief StreamDivers

 that is indeed its function. The room contains very little in the way

>examine me
 One of the attributes most common among successful StreamDivers is a
 nondescript appearance -- any particularly remarkable features would
 increase the chance of drawing attention on a Dive. The good thing
 about this is that you are at least as good-looking as average. The
 downside, of course, is that you have very little in the way of
 distinguishing features [Footnote 8].
 Joxley Douzen walks confidently into the room, followed by the rest of
 the evaluation team. They stand at the head of the room, staring
 heavily at you. Finally, Joxley speaks.

 "StreamDiver Alpha Tango-678, it is the finding of this evaluation team
 that you have completed the objectives for this mission with an
 approval rating of 66 percent. Very disappointing. There's some concern
 that you aren't using our resources well. When you receive your next
 mission, we'll suggest that it be an easier one."

 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the
 field, and hope that one of your mission proposals will be accepted. On
 the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this
 room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations. The
 exit is east.

 The display monitor stands against one wall, your mission description
 visible on its screen.

 You can also see an equipment locker (in which are a cloaking device,
 an autokey, a probe and a chip bank (in which are ten chips (a dive
 chip, a DataStore chip, a map chip, a library chip, an artificial
 intuition chip, a cryptography chip, a scan chip, a blank chip, an
 interface chip and a shield chip))) here.

>push visualizer
 The visualizer has nothing to display here.

>put datastore in console
 You need to be holding the DataStore chip before you can put it into
 something else.

>take datastore. put it in console

 Taken.
 You put the scan chip into the StreamDive console.

>take blank. put it in console
 Taken.
 You put the blank chip into the StreamDive console.

>examine rack
 (the StreamDive console)
 Your StreamDive console is a small display device designed to provide
 you with relevant information about the current dive, and allow access
 to key StreamDive facilities [Footnote 1]. These facilities are made
 available by adding chips to its five-slot chiprack. The chiprack
 currently contains four chips.

>examine bank
 A small section of the locker contains slots for holding StreamDive
 chips.

>look in bank
 In the chip bank are six chips (a dive chip, a map chip, a library
 chip, an artificial intuition chip, a cryptography chip and a shield
 chip).

>take shield. put it in console
 Taken.
 You put the shield chip into the StreamDive console.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your StreamDive console
     five chips:
       a shield chip
       a blank chip
       a scan chip
       an interface chip

 Mission Parameters

 StreamDiver Alpha Tango-678
 FYEO

 Clearance granted for immediate StreamDive. Target is local grid
 reference 0x1549. Temporal Reference 785278.7 UDC. We will be in phase
 for StreamDive at 865741.3 UDC. Dive duration not to exceed .5 units
 UDC (12 hours local time). Stream Capacitance field will be set for
 auto-recall at this time.
 Research unit indicates high levels of stream distortion in this zone,
 indicating that premature extraction may not be possible.

 Mission Summary: The purpose of your StreamDive is historical research.
 We have isolated an evacuated area to minimize potential corruption.
 You are to record all findings, but avoid direct contact with any
 inhabitants. Records from this zone are fragmentary, so any documents
 of historical interest should be added to your DataStore.

 *WARNING*
 Due to ambient radiation levels, wideband recall will not be available.
 Since StreamDive instruments are shielded against EMP effects, lost
 components may be recoverable after destruction of the local grid
 section. For this reason, level 1b restrictions are in effect for the
 duration of this dive.

 PLEASE REVIEW STREAMDIVER MANUAL BEFORE COMMENCING DIVE.

>go east
 [Once you leave this area, you will be unable to return. Are you
 certain that you are ready?]

>yes
 You walk out of the Prep Room, down the long corridor, and into the
 Dive section. A number of sensors verify that you are carrying no
 contraband, and make a detailed record of your relevant bio-data, which
 is compared to your records to ensure that you are indeed the person
 scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record
 will be compared again when you emerge, to ensure that nothing
 important about your physiology has altered during the dive. The only
 visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.

 Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
 where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
 renders you free of micro-organisms.

 You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an
 indentation by the next door, where ultrasonic "needles" inject you
 with the requisite immunity boosters, which always gives you the
 pleasant feeling of being, at least temporarily, totally impregnable to
 disease.

 One more room, and anticipation would increase your heart-rate enough
 that a sensor might declare you medically unfit for duty. Fortunately,
 this room is the last.


 StreamDive Core
 You stand in the core of the StreamDive Temporal Relocation Unit. Far
 below you, an artificial singularity waits to propel you backward in
 history. The room itself is a huge dome, totally black, but lit from an
 unseeable source. There is always gooseflesh on your arms when you
 stand in this room. It is not a friendly room, not a relaxed room. This
 is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
 than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
 design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
 time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
 itself, neither part of the present nor the past.

 It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.
 A voice materializes from nowhere in particular. "StreamDiver Alpha
 Tango-678, StreamDive will commence in thirty seconds. Good luck, and
 Godspeed."

>wait
 Time passes.
 The floor fades to transparency. There is a brilliant point of light
 somewhere far below you. Scanning beams trace over your body. Below
 you, a perfect mirror image of yourself fades into existence, your
 avatar. You have a sinking feeling as your avatar falls toward the
 light. Just as you were trained, you roll back on the balls of your
 feet and close your eyes. In your head, you count to six. Deep down
 there, your avatar enters the event horizon of the artificial
 singularity. As always, you have the disconcerting sensation of
 falling...

 Cold.

 Hot.

 Bright.

 Dark.

 The pain is gone before you feel it. You want to open your eyes, but
 you know better. Even if you survived the experience, your sanity would
 not. You wait for the sensation of falling to end.

 It does.

 You wait for your perception of local timespace to return.

 It does.

 You open your eyes.


 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down,
 presumably to the basement.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

>turn newel
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

>open banister
 That's not something you can open.

>examine banister
 The staircase along the north wall leads up and down. The railing, a
 solid wood banister, is capped at the landing by a sturdy and ornate
 post with a polished oak ball at its top. The banister is worn, and its
 finish is nicked and scraped. You have that same, terrifying sense you
 often get on missions like this; this was a place where people lived,
 not some mock-up in a museum. Time travel gives you a strange sense of
 ephemerality; for you, this entire house is long gone, and yet, it
 still exists in the here-and-now, and you are acutely aware of how much
 will be lost when this place is destroyed.

>turn ball
 You give the knob a twist, then another. After a few more turns, it
 comes free in your hand, revealing a very small compartment in the post
 underneath.

>look in compartment
 In the post is a large key.

>take key
 Taken.

>go down

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 2], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

 The button on the stream visualizer blinks, indicating that it has
 generated a new hologram.

>push visualizer
 The visualizer beeps softly, then its emitter flares to life....

 "Did you check the basement?" asks a short, graying woman.

 "Julie?" a middle-aged man calls through the basement door. "I don't
 think she's in the house," he finally says.

 "Where the hell else would she be?"

 "Have you called her friends?" he asks.

 "She doesn't have any friends," the woman answers. She immediately
 looks away, her face reddening in shame. "I tried Donna's house. They
 aren't there."

 "They didn't leave a note?"

 "Fuck, James, do you think I'd be running around like this if they
 had?"

 "Calm down, Kat. When was the last time you saw them?"

 She sighs. "I don't know. Dinner last night. I thought Julie was just
 up in her room or something."

 "Okay. Look, it's probably nothing."

 "It fucking isn't nothing, James. You know how she is."

 "And I know she's got more sense than to pull some dumb stunt. Where's
 Jimmy?"

 "He went out. With his girlfriend."

 "Okay. When he gets home, ask him is he knows where they would have
 gone."

 "I'm worried."

 He shakes his head. "Did you look in Donna's room?"

 "There's nothing there. James, what if something set her off? You don't
 think she would have --"

 James cuts her off. "Katia... You haven't been... I mean, have you
 looked in her diary lately?"

 Katia lights a cigarette. "Her doctor said I'm supposed to 'respect her
 boundaries,' some load of shit."

 With a furtive glance he whispers, "Maybe you should take a look. If
 she doesn't come home tonight. Just... Just to be sure."

 "I'll tan her ass if she does."

 James waits a long time before he responds. "Don't overreact. You'll
 just end up--"

 "Pushing her further away. Thanks Freud, but you can skip the
 psychobabble."

 "Look, I'm sure it's nothing. Maybe she got a new boyfriend or
 something."

 "Fucking great." Katia seems about to say something else, but she looks
 up suddenly as if she's heard something. "Julie? Donna? Is that you?"

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

 Den
 As an architectural feature, the den declined in popularity during this
 part of the century, but this house seems to have one nonetheless. From
 your historical research, you know that a den is a sort of cross
 between a study and a family room. This room shows signs of wear;
 stains and worn patches of carpet suggest heavy use. Behind one
 recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored
 from frequent collisions. One wall is covered in bookshelves. A
 well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a
 conversation area in the middle of the room. The western wall is open,
 leading back to the stairway.

 On the bar are four glasses (empty) and some bottles.

 A video game system sits before the video screen.

 You can also see a video screen and a video disc player (empty) here.

 The button on the stream visualizer blinks, indicating that it has
 generated a new hologram.

>search couch
 You force your hand between two cushions. Before nicking yourself on a
 spring, your hand catches on a small object which was lost in the
 couch, which emerges to the surface just ahead of your stinging hand.

>push visualizer
 The visualizer beeps softly, then its emitter flares to life....

 The video screen flickers with computer-generated violence. Before it,
 the young man sits cross-legged, manipulating the controls of the video
 game system. Beside him is a young woman. probably the same age,
 generously built, with a mop of dark, uneven curls. She too manipulates
 a game controller, but with an obvious lack of familiarity. They play
 for a time, then set their controllers down.

 "Not bad," he says.

 "Jim," the girl says, "You let me win."

 He shrugs. "Come on, Amy, I wouldn't do that. I mean, I'll admit I
 didn't have my best game, but it's not like I was holding back on
 purpose."

 "No?" Amy says, incredulously.

 He smiles, unfolding his legs. "Maybe I was distracted."

 She blushes. "Distracted?"

 He places three fingers against her cheek, gently turning her face
 toward his. She tilts her head back slightly, in anticipation of a
 kiss. He moves in, clumsily, and their noses touch...

 She bursts out laughing.

 He looks away, feigning shame. "Well, that's done a lot for my self
 esteem."

 She puts both hands on his face and tries to pull him back into a kiss.
 She doesn't make it, bursting out with more laughter just before their
 lips touch. This time, he laughs too.

 "Would it help if I told you I had no idea what I'm doing?" he says.

 She laughs some more. "Neither do I. I don't know why I can't stop
 laughing. I've never done this before."

 "That's a relief," Jim says. He tries to kiss her again, and this time
 bursts out laughing himself.

 "This isn't working," Amy says, trying not to laugh. "We are such
 geeks."

 "You have no idea what kind of pressure this is putting on me."

 Amy smiles slyly. "Maybe this will help." She puts a leg over his,
 moving onto his lap.

 "Well that's taken the pressure off," he says with more than a hint of
 sarcasm. "What now, count to three?"

 She giggles. "One," he says.

 "Two," they say in unison.

 Amy takes him by surprise, not waiting any longer, and pushes her lips
 against his. Jim falls backward in surprise, but, though they are both
 failing to totally suppress laughter, they manage to maintain contact.
 Jim places a hand against Amy's neck, then moves it down to the small
 of her back. A few seconds later, he moves his hand down even further.

>open toilet
 On a whim, you lift the heavy boxes and raise the lid of the toilet
 seat. The bowl has been drained, and resting inside is a small book,

 Pantry
 This is a small room, designed to hold food staples and cooking
 equipment not housed in the kitchen. You doubt you'll find anything
 worthwhile in here, but you've been a StreamDiver long enough to know
 better than to trust appearances. You can return east to the kitchen.

 Shelves line the walls, sparsely stocked.

 On the shelves are some pots and pans, a lazy susan (empty), a flour
 pot (closed) and a can of spiced ham (closed).

>open ham
 Better not; as it is, this is probably the only thing in the house that
 could survive the impending nuclear blast.

>scan
 The scanner has further details available on:
  the can of spiced ham

>scan ham
 A slight shiver runs up your spine as you read the results of the scan.
 Something similar to your temporal shield has been used on this can to
 force it into a hyperstable configuration. Despite the question of why
 anyone would do such a thing, what concerns you far more is the
 question of how it was done; such a transmutation is patently
 impossible without StreamDive technology. Has someone else been here?

>timescan
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 Something blocks the light for a second, and you turn to look. Nothing.

 Dining Room
 When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
 of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
 room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
 dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
 undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
 of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
 area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
 uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
 of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
 in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
 nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
 portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
 small door is west.

 On the buffet are two oil lamps.

 You can see a photograph here.

 The button on the stream visualizer blinks, indicating that it has
 generated a new hologram.

>examine photograph
 This is apparently a visual of the family that lived in this house. In
 the back stand two adults, a man whose receding hair looks unnaturally
 dark, wearing thick, horn-rimmed eyeglasses, and a woman, much shorter,
 who looks about the same age. She too wears glasses, with a more
 fashionable wire frame. Her front teeth, visible in what looks like an
 unaccustomed smile, are stained and crooked. A small scar is visible
 near the corner of her mouth. Before them are two children. On the
 right, a boy about ten, has a ridiculous smile and equally ridiculous
 bowl-cut. Beside him is a girl, probably a few years his senior. You
 aren't sure, but you think you see a glint of something reflective near
 her temple, where her hair is awkwardly combed over a bald patch. Her
 eyes are not quite the same color, though that may be a blemish on the
 photograph. There does certainly seem to be something odd about her
 right eye, but you can't tell on a photograph this size.

 The visualizer beeps softly, then its emitter flares to life....

 Four people, two adults, and two teen-age children sit around the
 table. The adult woman, the mother, has her hands clasped on the table,
 as if about to say a prayer, but she thinks better of it as the boy
 begins to load his plate down with some casserole dish.

 "So, how was everyone's day?" the father asks, distractedly.

 The girl rolls her eyes and looks away. The boy, between rapid, greedy
 mouthfulls, says, "Did the two of you know that I'm a genius? Like
 Einstein, only I can do long division."

 This time, it is the mother who rolls her eyes. "So how come you're
 only getting a ninety-nine in calculus?"

 "Katia," the father says, evenly. "What is it this time, Jimmy?"

 The boy smiles, self-satisfied. "Oh, just a little discovery that's
 going to set me up among the gods."

 "Can I be excused? I think I'm getting sick," the girl says.

 "Julie, please," he father mildly reprimands. "So what's this
 discovery?"

 Jimmy has clearly been waiting for a chance to brag. "Dad," he says,
 with a conspiratorial tone indicating that he considers the subject
 above the level of the women. "You remember what I was saying about
 backwards-mapping activation patterns onto a neural network?"

 The father nods, though without any conviction. Jimmy doesn't appear to
 care. "I got in touch with a professor at Pacific Tech, he's the top
 guy in distributed neural nets. Well, he says that I'm on the right
 track, and my preliminaries open up something they've never even looked
 at before.

 "See, I figure you can represent a human mind by imposing a
 non-deterministic neural network over this thing called a DeKrupper
 mapping function."

 "Which means?" the father asks, cautiously.

 The boy sighs, taking the explanation to be beneath his dignity. "It
 means you can emulate all the functions of a human brain on a computer.
 Everyone's always thought that was impossible, because it's supposed to
 reduce to the halting problem. But it doesn't really, because all the
 proofs for it are based on something that doesn't apply when you use a
 Nth-level polymatrix."

 "So..." the father takes some time to put it all together. "You could
 create a sentient computer program?"

 Jimmy beams with pride. "Bingo. But more than that; I mean, you don't
 have to emulate the whole brain, you could just build up a part of it,
 like, you could make a computer that does all the work for your motor
 functions."

 "To help people with brain injuries," the father concludes.

 Jimmy nods. "Of course, the sentient program thing is what's goign to
 get me the nobel prize."

 "Wait a minute," the mother says. "You can't do that. You can't know
 exactly how a human brain works."

 "But you can," Jimmy protests. "You just need to back-map from the
 activation patterns."

 "And if this is so simple, why hasn't anyone done it? It won't work."

 "Mom," Jimmy says, exasperated. "You said the same thing when I came up
 with the idea for the automatic navigation thing for the car. We could
 all be rich now if you hadn't told me it wouldn't work."

 "I never said that," she says, defensively. "I said that I didn't think
 you could make it work in a way that would be useful outside of very
 specific examples."

 Jimmy sighs. "Look, it's all perfectly simple."

 "You're perfectly simple," his sister interrupts. "And you're giving me
 a headache. I'll be in my room."

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

>examine letter
 Dear Julia,
 I hope to God you get this letter. We waited for you as long as we
 could, but they're saying that the bombs could fall any day. There's a
 shelter out in New Calvert, we're going there. Daddy says its the
 safest place in a hundred miles. Try to get there if you can, but don't
 take any risks. The most important thing is that you stay safe. I left
 some money and your grandmom's jewels in the hidden place for you. Your
 dad bought a gun and bullets, and put them there too, but be careful.
 We all love you and hope to see you again.

 Love,
 Mom.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

 The button on the stream visualizer blinks, indicating that it has

 The visualizer beeps softly, then its emitter flares to life....

 "How DARE you!"

 A red-haired young woman tries to push past an older, shorter woman,
 apparently her mother. The older woman stops her. "Julie, what did you
 want me to do? You never even come out of that room of yours, you don't
 talk to anyone, and now this?"

 "You have no RIGHT!"

 "I have EVERY right, Julie! Christ, God only knows what could have
 happened to you! Drugs; sex, you could be lying dead in a gutter right
 now! And what about this?" She grabs her daughter's arm, exposing a
 heavy bandage around the wrist.

 Julie pulls back, almost toppling her mother. "None of your God damned
 business." The mother slaps her, hard across the cheek. "You don't talk
 to me like that! Who the hell do you think you are, young lady?"

 The girl touches her face. "Bitch!" she shouts. "Leave me the fuck
 alone! I'm seventeen years old, and my bitch mother thinks she can
 search my room?" There is something dangerous in her eyes as her left
 hand curls into a fist. She seems to seriously consider decking her
 mother. "You pull a fucking stunt like that again and I'm GONE! You
 hear me?"

 Her mother is holding her own hand against her chest. "You are my
 daughter!" she barks. "You aren't going to run around this town like
 some junkie whore, and you are NOT going to talk to me like this!"

 "Fine," Julie says. "I'm done talking." She pushes her mother aside and
 retreats into a door off of the east end of the hall. The walls shake
 with the force of the door slamming.

 Her mother slumps against the wall, exhausted. A gray-haired man
 appears at the top of the stairs. She gives him a venomous look.

 "You're hurt," he says, impassively.

 She shakes her hand, which is starting to swell, bruised by the force
 of the impact. "Get me an ice pack," she says. "And take the fucking
 lock off her door."

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 The button on the stream visualizer blinks, indicating that it has
 generated a new hologram.

>examine photograph
 This image shows a young man in his mid-teens. He sports a pathetic
 attempt at a moustache. Though he shows all the awkwardness of
 adolescence, he apparently does know, at least, how to pose for a
 photograph. He has a very slight smile, and a look of interested
 curiosity on his face. He does show the awkward pockmarks of severe
 acne, made worse by the extreme fullness of his face. He is wearing a
 black shirt with a suede vest, which bears a small lapel pin, of the
 sort distributed by academic honor societies.

 The visualizer beeps softly, then its emitter flares to life....

 At first, you see nothing, but then a spinning piece of metal pokes
 through the north door, just above the knob. It dissappears into the
 hole it has bored, and is replaced by an old-fashioned keyhole saw.
 Slowly, it cuts a careful circle. With a sharp bang, the piece of wood
 is ejected from the door.

 Now, the door opens. A red-haired young woman takes an electric drill
 -- a mechanical device which uses a spinning screw rather than a laser
 beam -- to the door, boring a hole which intersects the first cut. She
 places the barrel of a bolt into the hole, then attaches the two halves
 of a locking mechanism to either side of the door.

 Fixing the pieces together with what you think is called a
 "screwdriver", she mumbles to herself.

 "Okay, bitch. Try snooping now."

 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 4], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 5]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.

 The button on the stream visualizer blinks, indicating that it has
 generated a new hologram.

>push visualizer
 The visualizer beeps softly, then its emitter flares to life....

 A young, red-haired woman lies on the bed. In front of her are a
 creased paper and a well-worn notebook. She moves a pencil from one to
 the other, mouthing letters, but being careful not mark either.

 She looks up suddenly, as if hearing something. "I'll be right down!"
 she yells.

 She stands up quickly, taking the notebook. She presses her hand
 against the base of the dollhouse, which pops off. She places the
 notebook inside carefully, then reaches for the paper, but a breeze
 catches it, knocking it to the floor. She crouches down and tries to
 retrieve it, but the paper slips into the heating vent. "Shit," she
 says, then reaches inside after it.

 After a few seconds, she looks up and yells, "I said I was coming!"
 Lower, she adds, "I heard you the first time, you dumb bitch."

 She gives up her search and kicks the vent cover as she stands. She
 quickly replaces the base to the dollhouse, and storms out of the room.

 Forced air environmental control... You've heard of this. It's a system
 which controlled the temperature in a building via the crude method of
 pumping air of the desired temperature through a system of metal tubes

 Watercolor seems to be an inappropriate choice for the subject matter,
 but watercolor is, of course, much easier to work with than oil paints.
 The picture shows a serene lake, what should be a quaint scene of
 pastoral bliss. But the colors don't fit well with the subject. Though
 dark colors are largely absent, a few areas suggest that this is due
 purely to the painting's incomplete state. At the center of picture,
 without enough detail to recognize at first glance, is the disturbing
 figure of a drowning victim. Trails of unpainted canvas might form what
 might be a burial shroud around the figure, still lacking enough in
 detail to discern the gender. The figure's arms are spread wide, in
 what is still called the "Dead Man's Float".

 Most of the dark areas, and, indeed one or two of the light areas, are
 unfinished. The overwhelming historical likelihood is that they will
 remain that way.

 she's just worried about me.

 She doesn't want me to see CJ anymore because he's a bad influence. I
 guess I see her point, but I really care about him.

 I have to start seeing a therapist again. Maybe he will help me feel
 better about myself.

 April 18 - Jimmy pulled a prank on me. It was mean. I didn't tell mom,
 but I hope she finds out and punishes him.

 April 19 - Met with the doctor today. It was really good to talk with
 someone.

 April 21 - We had lima beans with dinner tonight. I hate lima beans.

 April 22 - It looks like there's going to be a war. I'm really scared.

 April 24 - I saw my old friend Donna today. I hope I get to talk to
 her. She's nice. It would be good to have a friend again.

 April 25 - Jimmy has some new idea for a computer program. I wish I was
 that smart. Maybe he'll get rich and famous.

 April 22 - It looks like there's going to be a war. I'm really scared.

 April 24 - I saw my old friend Donna today. I hope I get to talk to
 her. She's nice. It would be good to have a friend again.

 April 25 - Jimmy has some new idea for a computer program. I wish I was
 that smart. Maybe he'll get rich and famous.

 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 4], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 5]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

>examine desk
 This is a fairly small desk, essentially little more than a table. The
 desk is tightly packed with office supplies and other sundries

>search desk
 There is nothing on the desk.

>open chest
 You open the chest, revealing a glass eye and an eyepatch.

>examine glass eye
 This is a hemispherical piece of colored glass, with a hook at the
 back. It looks to be the sort of "eye" found on stuffed toys.

>go south

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

>go west

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>go north
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the magnetic handle.


 Hall Closet
 Although the primary function of this room seems to be as a linen
 closet, its size suggests that it was intended for even heavier
 storage. Three of the walls bear shelves, neatly stocked with towels
 and bed linens.

>scan
 The scanner has further details available on:
  the charger
  the can of spiced ham

>search towels
 You find nothing of interest.

>search linens
 You poke around at the sheets, and find, hidden in the folds of a large
 bedsheet toward the back, a pack of cigarettes, either squirreled away
 for an emergency, or hidden from a disapproving family member.

>examine cigarettes
 Toward the end of the twenty-first century, various lobbies finally
 succeeded in banning the manufacture and sale of these particular
 items, citing their known carcinogenic effects and the ongoing
 tendencies of their manufacturers to indulge in unethical business
 practices. Like the bans on so many other harmful intoxicants, the
 cigarette ban would have undoubtedly failed, had genetic engineering
 not coupled a non-toxic smoking mixture with powerful antidepressants,
 resulting in a new, safe cigarette, which provided an even better high.
 These, however, are still quite lethal, you're sure.

>open pack
 They're not something you can open.

>smell cigarettes
 You smell nothing unexpected.

>search linens
 You find nothing of interest.

>search pack
 You find nothing of interest.

>scan pack
 The scanner reveals nothing of interest.

>go south

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>go west

 Hallway, west end
 The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point
 of view. You can see where the stairway meets the hall to the east, and
 doors are located along the north, south, and west walls.

 A framed photograph of a young woman graces one wall.

>examine photo
 The image shows a young woman dressed in simplified academic regalia.
 She wears a formless gown in an unflattering blue pastel with a
 mortarboard cap. The girl in the picture looks about the right age for
 this photograph to be commemorating a high school graduation, though
 there are signs that she might be older; her expression is one of
 world-weariness, and her disapproving frown merges into lines on the
 face which suggest that this is an accustomed expression. You imagine
 that she would be quite attractive, if not for the scowl which seems to
 be permanently burnt into her face.

 An unnatural reflection causes you to notice her right eye, which,
 under close scrutiny, is apparently artificial. Though the prosthesis
 is good enough to pass for the real thing under casual scrutiny, it
 does lack the bloodshot look of the left eye, and you can make out the
 segmentation of a mechanical iris. If the color had been a better match
 for her left eye, you might well not have noticed.

>look behind photo
 You find nothing of interest.

>go north

 Bathroom
 In most respects, this is a thoroughly ordinary bathroom. It is far
 less clean than the public areas of the house, but not unsettlingly so.
 It is simple in decor, featuring a tub, toilet, sink, and no windows.
 The mirror over the sink protrudes slightly, suggesting that it
 conceals a medicine cabinet. The exit is south.

 The button on the stream visualizer blinks, indicating that it has
 generated a new hologram.

>push visualizer
 The visualizer beeps softly, then its emitter flares to life....

 Steam billows from the shower, and even though it's only a hologram,
 you find yourself wanting to mop condensation from your brow. Through
 the translucency of the shower curtain, you can make out the general
 shape of a female. A second later, she shuts off the water, stands
 shaking behind the curtain for a moment, then extends an arm from the
 curtain, reaching toward an empty towel-rack.

 After clutching at empty air a few times, she pokes her head out, her
 long blonde hair sticking to her head as water drips from it.

 "Shit," she says, then steps out of the bathtub, uselessly trying to
 wipe the water from her body with her bare hands.

 It is at about this time that the door swings open. A young man steps
 in, apparently oblivious to her. He sees her, and comes to a complete
 stop, studying her nude form slack-jawed.

 Overcome by surprise, it takes the woman a moment to process what has
 just happened. When she does, she throws up her hands to provide
 extremely inadequate concealment for her more sensitive parts, quickly
 turning a deep scarlet. "Stop fucking staring, you pervert!" she
 shouts. She rushes toward him, using her shoulder to force him back
 through the doorway. She closes the door with her foot, obviously
 unwilling to further expose herself by moving her hands from their
 protective positions. She falls backward against the closed door,
 holding it shut with her weight, though this seems unlikely to be
 effective should the young man have any determination whatsoever to
 re-enter.

 "And get me a fucking towel."

 It is simple in decor, featuring a tub, toilet, sink, and no windows.
 The mirror over the sink protrudes slightly, suggesting that it

>examine vent
 Forced air environmental control... You've heard of this. It's a system
 which controlled the temperature in a building via the crude method of
 pumping air of the desired temperature through a system of metal tubes
 toward various areas of the house. It's an interesting system, neither
 very efficient, nor robust, but it did allow the most cost-effective
 means of controlling interior climate available in this era.

>examine toilet
 While the mechanical aspects may have changed, the device is similar in
 appearance and function to those of your own era.

 That's not something you can open.

 Sealed Room
 You are in a small, dark room that appears to have been unused for
 years. The only feature worth noting is a wooden ladder which leads to
 an opening in the ceiling. The exit is north.

>go up

 Attic
 There is barely enough room to stand upright in the attic. It certainly
 looks too small to be of much use for storage. It's nearly impossible
 to move without clocking yourself on a supporting beam.

 You can see an unlabeled data disc here.

 Device: Optical disc, Joliet encoding.

 Scanning. Text message found:
 By now, the political alliance of European and American countries is
 engaged in a war against countries in the middle and far east. This
 conflict will last several years, and result in several billion deaths.
 The war will be ended when Space Station Kennedy crashes near the
 Chinese capital city.

 However, the war can be ended more quickly, and with a reduced loss of
 life if nuclear weapons from the United States can be effectively
 deployed in the Chinese mainland. The defensive screen which prevents
 nuclear weapons from reaching Chinese soil uses a simple 512-bit
 identification code to differentiate between friendly and unfriendly
 missiles. If a nuclear missile were to transmit the data sequence
 generated by the Plotnitz-Leibkin algorithm at a frequency of 906.4
 MHz, Chinese countermeasures would mistake the missile for a Chinese
 launch, and would be unable to eradicate it before it reached its
 target. The tactical advantage afforded by this ability will
 undoubtedly force the eastern alliance to capitulate with a
 substantially reduced cost in both lives and damage to the world
 ecosystem.

 You blink. This doesn't make any sense. The disc is contemporary, but
 it seems to contain information about events in the future. This can't

 [Footnote 6]
 For your convenience, unless a door is locked, you do not need to refer
 to it. The game will assume that you open and close all unlocked doors
 as needed.

>examine shield
 This chip uses the StreamDive capacitors to generate an impenetrable
 temporal energy barrier around the user for defensive purposes. Using
 this function drains energy from the dive capacitors, reducing the
 remaining duration of the dive.
 Commands Provided:
  SHIELD ON -- Activate the shield
  SHIELD OFF -- Deactivate the shield.

>go east

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>go down

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

>go west

 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

 Pantry
 This is a small room, designed to hold food staples and cooking
 equipment not housed in the kitchen. You doubt you'll find anything
 worthwhile in here, but you've been a StreamDiver long enough to know
 better than to trust appearances. You can return east to the kitchen.

 Shelves line the walls, sparsely stocked.

 On the shelves are some pots and pans, a lazy susan (empty) and a flour
 pot (closed).

 Unbelievable. The workmanship which allows this device to swivel
 smoothly, allowing stored utensils to be easily accessed, all without
 the aid of laser construction or frictionless bearings. Still, from its
 gaudy appearance, it isn't hard to see why the owner relegated it to
 the pantry.

 Dining Room
 When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
 of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
 room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
 dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
 undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
 of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
 area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
 uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
 of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
 in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
 nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
 portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
 small door is west.

 On the buffet are two oil lamps.

 You can see a photograph here.

 Behind the Stairs
 The ceiling over this stretch of hallway slopes upward where the stairs
 cut into it. Along the south wall, just before the ceiling becomes too
 low to make a serviceable hallway, a low, louvered door marks a small
 closet. The hallway continues east, and to the west it ends in an
 archway leading to the dining room.

>open door
 That's already open.

>look in closet
 In the little closet are a coaxial cable, a stuffed bear, four video
 discs (one "Womb Raider", one "Blow me Away", one "Coeds Getting Naked"
 and one "Thrustmaster Returns") and some adult magazines.
 In the distance, you think you hear someone trying to force the lock on
 the front door. Better stay out of sight.

 In the front hall, you hear the sound of cracking wood as the door is

 StreamDiver Prep Room
 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the
 field, and hope that one of your mission proposals will be accepted. On
 the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this
 room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations. The
 exit is east.

 The display monitor stands against one wall, your mission description
 visible on its screen.

 You can also see an equipment locker (closed) here.

 You walk out of the Prep Room, down the long corridor, and into the
 Dive section. A number of sensors verify that you are carrying no
 contraband, and make a detailed record of your relevant bio-data, which
 is compared to your records to ensure that you are indeed the person
 scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record
 will be compared again when you emerge, to ensure that nothing
 important about your physiology has altered during the dive. The only
 visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.

 Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
 where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
 renders you free of micro-organisms.

 You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an
 indentation by the next door, where ultrasonic "needles" inject you
 with the requisite immunity boosters, which always gives you the
 pleasant feeling of being, at least temporarily, totally impregnable to
 disease.

 One more room, and anticipation would increase your heart-rate enough
 that a sensor might declare you medically unfit for duty. Fortunately,
 this room is the last.


 StreamDive Core
 You stand in the core of the StreamDive Temporal Relocation Unit. Far
 below you, an artificial singularity waits to propel you backward in
 history. The room itself is a huge dome, totally black, but lit from an
 unseeable source. There is always gooseflesh on your arms when you
 stand in this room. It is not a friendly room, not a relaxed room. This
 is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
 than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
 design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
 time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
 itself, neither part of the present nor the past.

 It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.
 A voice materializes from nowhere in particular. "StreamDiver Alpha
 Tango-678, StreamDive will commence in thirty seconds. Good luck, and
 Godspeed."

>wait
 Time passes.
 The floor fades to transparency. There is a brilliant point of light
 somewhere far below you. Scanning beams trace over your body. Below
 you, a perfect mirror image of yourself fades into existence, your
 avatar. You have a sinking feeling as your avatar falls toward the
 light. Just as you were trained, you roll back on the balls of your
 feet and close your eyes. In your head, you count to six. Deep down
 there, your avatar enters the event horizon of the artificial
 singularity. As always, you have the disconcerting sensation of
 falling...

 Cold.

 Hot.

 Bright.

 Dark.

 The pain is gone before you feel it. You want to open your eyes, but
 you know better. Even if you survived the experience, your sanity would
 not. You wait for the sensation of falling to end.

 It does.

 You wait for your perception of local timespace to return.

 It does.

 You open your eyes.

>go east

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down,
 presumably to the basement.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

>examine letter
 Dear Julia,
 I hope to God you get this letter. We waited for you as long as we
 could, but they're saying that the bombs could fall any day. There's a
 shelter out in New Calvert, we're going there. Daddy says its the
 safest place in a hundred miles. Try to get there if you can, but don't
 take any risks. The most important thing is that you stay safe. I left
 some money and your grandmom's jewels in the hidden place for you. Your
 dad bought a gun and bullets, and put them there too, but be careful.
 We all love you and hope to see you again.

 Love,
 Mom.

>turn ball
 You give the knob a twist, then another. After a few more turns, it
 comes free in your hand, revealing a very small compartment in the post
 underneath.

>go down

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 1], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

>go east

 Den
 As an architectural feature, the den declined in popularity during this
 part of the century, but this house seems to have one nonetheless. From
 your historical research, you know that a den is a sort of cross
 between a study and a family room. This room shows signs of wear;
 stains and worn patches of carpet suggest heavy use. Behind one
 recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored
 from frequent collisions. One wall is covered in bookshelves. A
 well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a
 conversation area in the middle of the room. The western wall is open,
 leading back to the stairway.

 On the bar are four glasses (empty) and some bottles.

 A video game system sits before the video screen.

 You can also see a video screen and a video disc player (empty) here.

>search couch
 You force your hand between two cushions. Before nicking yourself on a
 spring, your hand catches on a small object which was lost in the
 couch, which emerges to the surface just ahead of your stinging hand.

 Bathroom
 You get the impression that this bathroom has become a waystation for
 things that were intended for the basement, but got lost along the way.
 Boxes and bags seem to cover every surface; the sink, the heating vent,
 the fixture. The way out is south.

>open toilet
 On a whim, you lift the heavy boxes and raise the lid of the toilet
 seat. The bowl has been drained, and resting inside is a small book,
 which you manage, with some difficulty, to retrieve before letting the
 boxes fall back into place.

>turn on probe
 You have a sudden dizzy, disembodied feeling as sensory feed from the
 probe overwhelms you...

 You are in the main ventilation duct for this section of the house.
 Smaller ducts lead north, east, west, and northeast. A large shaft
 crosses this duct vertically.

 A string of letters has been printed on one of the shaft walls.

 Master Bathroom (as the probe)
 You are in a bathroom, unusually large and attractively decorated.
 Aside from the free-standing whirlpool bathtub, there is a separate
 shower stall. A counter, the central feature of which is a
 three-paneled mirror which wraps around the sink, spans one wall.
 Architecturally, the room itself is fairly simple; a rectangle with
 plain white walls and a simple black-and-white tessellation on the
 floor tile. The decor gives the room more life; delicate just-green
 lace window drapery contrasts elegantly with the deep green of the
 heavy rug in the center of the room. The counter is equipped with a
 wicker dish full of soaps which you assume are more decorative than
 functional. A wooden table under the window holds a vase of dried
 flowers. The exit is south.

>examine bathtub
 The probe lacks any manipulative hardware.

>examine vase
 The probe lacks any manipulative hardware.

>examine door
 This house has many doors. Very few of them are worthy of note
 [Footnote 2].
 The door is locked with a simple privacy lock.

>examine rug
 The rug is a fairly good decorating choice -- nothing too flashy, and
 in a color that complements that of the drapes. Admittedly, degree to
 which it accentuates the decor of the room is probably more a
 coincidence than a sign that the owner had some decorating skill.

>look under rug
 The probe lacks any manipulative hardware.

>scan
 The scanner reveals nothing of interest.

>timescan
 The console does a scan of the area, but detects nothing out of the
 ordinary, aside from the distortion caused by your own presence.

 Violence is against StreamDiver regulations.

 Nothing obvious happens.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 1], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.
 Somewhere, probably a few kilometers away, there is an explosion. The
 house rocks, and you have a hard time keeping your footing.

 You hear a great crash below.
 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>e. x photo. n.

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.
 This image shows a young man in his mid-teens. He sports a pathetic
 attempt at a moustache. Though he shows all the awkwardness of
 adolescence, he apparently does know, at least, how to pose for a
 photograph. He has a very slight smile, and a look of interested
 curiosity on his face. He does show the awkward pockmarks of severe
 acne, made worse by the extreme fullness of his face. He is wearing a
 black shirt with a suede vest, which bears a small lapel pin, of the
 sort distributed by academic honor societies.
 [The document "Photograph of a Young Man" has been added to your
 DataStore.]
 That door is locked.

>yes

 Okay [Footnote 3].

 You manage to unlock the door with the deadbolt key.


 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 4], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 5]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.

>open dollhouse
 You give a gentle tug at the base, which pops open. Inside, you see two
 letters (a crumpled letter and a folded letter) and a strange book.

>take all from dollhouse
 crumpled letter: Removed.
 folded letter: Removed.
 strange book: Removed.

 Under your scrutinty, a very slight distortion in the picture is

 dad now. Mom started dating this drug dealer and she got arrested
 because he was making crystal meth in our basement. So I'm back here at
 least till the end of the year. So what's new in your life? I'm sorry I
 haven't kept in touch. Pleare write me back so we can talk some time.

 I'm glad you wrote me back. All these years, I've been scared pretty
 much shitless that you hated me, because it was my mom was driving that
 night when you lost your eye. I've really missed you all these years,
 and I would have talked to you in the hall, but every time I see you I
 lose my nerve. First I think that you'll hate me because of the
 accident, then I think maybe I should try to talk to you anyway, but
 then I think that you'll hate me for not talking to you for so long. I
 guess I'll understand if you want me to just steer clear and stuff, but
 please try to forgive me. God, I'm such a coward. I've really missed
 you. I don't know if you can ever forgive me, but I really want to let
 you know how sorry I am.

 Anyway, yeah, sure I can get a note to someone for you. But it might be
 easier for you to go through Rusty. You remember Rusty? He lived across

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

 Back Hallway
 A poorly-lit length of hallway begins here and continues west. The
 southern wall is open to the living room. A door leads east.

 A painting on the wall depicts a nautical theme.

>look behind painting
 You pull the painting a few centimeters from the wall, and notice that
 a small steel key, which you take, has been secreted in the back side
 of the frame.

>w. open door

 Behind the Stairs
 The ceiling over this stretch of hallway slopes upward where the stairs
 cut into it. Along the south wall, just before the ceiling becomes too
 low to make a serviceable hallway, a low, louvered door marks a small
 closet. The hallway continues east, and to the west it ends in an
 archway leading to the dining room.
 It seems to be locked.

>unlock door
 You have to specify what you want to unlock the little closet with.

>steel key
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>unlock door with steel key
 You open the little closet, revealing a coaxial cable, a stuffed bear,
 four video discs (one "Womb Raider", one "Blow me Away", one "Coeds
 Getting Naked" and one "Thrustmaster Returns") and some adult
 magazines.

>cut bear with scissors
 I only understood you as far as wanting to cut the stuffed bear.

>cut bear
 Cutting that would achieve little.

>open bear
 That's not something you can open.

>search bear

 It's a rather well-worn children's toy, missing its right eye.
 You shift your eyes back and forth. Bear. Porn. Bear. Porn. Bear.
 Something just isn't right.

 [The game has detected that you are using a version of the "Nitfol"
 interpreter, or a display with a width less than 22 characters. The
 statusline, menu bar, and "pretty-printing" of menus have been disabled
 to improve performance under this screen model. These features can be

 The indicator light switches from blue to green. The thought occurs to
 you that this is an exceptionally bad color choice for someone who,
 like you, suffers from a mild genetic deficit in the color perception
 department. However, you've been around long enough to be familiar with
 the change in hue that indicates clearance for a StreamDive.

 Your elation is such that it takes you a few seconds to respond to the
 indicator -- a critical error, though not a fatal one. You touch the
 control, and are further pleased to find that your mission hasn't been
 scrapped due to your moment of indecision. The full text of your
 mission description appears on the display...

 StreamDiver Prep Room
 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the
 field, and hope that one of your mission proposals will be accepted. On
 the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this
 room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations. The
 exit is east.

 The display monitor stands against one wall, your mission description
 visible on its screen.

 You can also see an equipment locker (closed) here.

>open locker
 You open the equipment locker, revealing your StreamDive console, a
 cloaking device, an autokey, a stream visualizer, a probe and a chip
 bank.

>take console. take cloaking
>examine cloaking
>take shield. put it in console
 Taken.
 Taken.

 A standard-issue cloaking device. Operating along similar principles to
 the StreamDive device itself, it causes all photons entering the field
 to be instantly transported to the far side of the field as if they had
 passed straight through it, with the net result being that anything
 within the field is nearly invisible. The relocation effect causes
 "ghost" photons to be emitted by the inside of the field, allowing any
 person inside it to see his surroundings with a minimum of visual
 distortion. The device's battery is currently charged to 100 percent.
 The cloaking device is currently switched off.

 Taken.
 You put the shield chip into the StreamDive console.

>take scan. put it in console

 You put the scan chip into the StreamDive console.

 You put the dive chip into the StreamDive console.

>examine dive
 (the StreamDive console)
 Your StreamDive console is a small display device designed to provide
 you with relevant information about the current dive, and allow access
 to key StreamDive facilities [Footnote 1]. These facilities are made
 available by adding chips to its five-slot chiprack. The chiprack
 currently contains three chips.

>examine dive chip
 This is the fundamental chip for the StreamDive console. It allows
 control of the temporal displacement functions.
 Commands Provided:
  RECALL -- Discharge StreamDive capacitors for instant recall
  STATUS -- Display status of Dive system
  TIMESCAN -- Scan local timestream

>take interface. put it in console

 You put the interface chip into the StreamDive console.

>take datastore. put it in console

 You put the DataStore chip into the StreamDive console.

 You are carrying:

       a scan chip
       a shield chip

>go east
 [Once you leave this area, you will be unable to return. Are you
 certain that you are ready?]

>yes
 You walk out of the Prep Room, down the long corridor, and into the
 Dive section. A number of sensors verify that you are carrying no
 contraband, and make a detailed record of your relevant bio-data, which
 is compared to your records to ensure that you are indeed the person
 scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record
 will be compared again when you emerge, to ensure that nothing
 important about your physiology has altered during the dive. The only
 visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.

 Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
 where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
 renders you free of micro-organisms.

 You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an
 indentation by the next door, where ultrasonic "needles" inject you
 with the requisite immunity boosters, which always gives you the
 pleasant feeling of being, at least temporarily, totally impregnable to
 disease.

 One more room, and anticipation would increase your heart-rate enough
 that a sensor might declare you medically unfit for duty. Fortunately,
 this room is the last.


 StreamDive Core
 You stand in the core of the StreamDive Temporal Relocation Unit. Far
 below you, an artificial singularity waits to propel you backward in
 history. The room itself is a huge dome, totally black, but lit from an
 unseeable source. There is always gooseflesh on your arms when you
 stand in this room. It is not a friendly room, not a relaxed room. This
 is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
 than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
 design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
 time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
 itself, neither part of the present nor the past.

 It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

>wait

>wait
 Time passes.
 A voice materializes from nowhere in particular. "StreamDiver Alpha
 Tango-678, StreamDive will commence in thirty seconds. Good luck, and
 Godspeed."

>examine cloaking
 This isn't a good time to let your mind wander.
 The floor fades to transparency. There is a brilliant point of light
 somewhere far below you. Scanning beams trace over your body. Below
 you, a perfect mirror image of yourself fades into existence, your
 avatar. You have a sinking feeling as your avatar falls toward the
 light. Just as you were trained, you roll back on the balls of your
 feet and close your eyes. In your head, you count to six. Deep down
 there, your avatar enters the event horizon of the artificial
 singularity. As always, you have the disconcerting sensation of
 falling...

 Cold.

 Hot.

 Bright.

 Dark.

 The pain is gone before you feel it. You want to open your eyes, but
 you know better. Even if you survived the experience, your sanity would
 not. You wait for the sensation of falling to end.

 It does.

 You wait for your perception of local timespace to return.

 It does.

 You open your eyes.


 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the

 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down,
 presumably to the basement.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

>go down

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 2], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

>go east

 Den
 As an architectural feature, the den declined in popularity during this
 part of the century, but this house seems to have one nonetheless. From
 your historical research, you know that a den is a sort of cross
 between a study and a family room. This room shows signs of wear;
 stains and worn patches of carpet suggest heavy use. Behind one
 recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored
 from frequent collisions. One wall is covered in bookshelves. A
 well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a
 conversation area in the middle of the room. The western wall is open,
 leading back to the stairway.

 On the bar are four glasses (empty) and some bottles.

 A video game system sits before the video screen.

 You can also see a video screen and a video disc player (empty) here.

>search cocuh
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

 You force your hand between two cushions. Before nicking yourself on a

 You manage to unlock the door with the deadbolt key.


 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 4], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 5]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.

 Walk-in Closet
 From the architecture of the house, you can tell that this is the only
 bedroom to have its own walk-in closet, which no doubt was an issue of
 some discussion when bedrooms were assigned. The majority of the closet
 is taken up by clothing, but you can see a few boxes toward the back.

 Nook
 You are in a small room which you suspect has no fixed purpose. There
 is a table in the center of the room, with a faux-wooden chair at it,
 and a long bench-seat under the window. The door along the north wall
 has been removed, presumably in an attempt to turn the room into some
 sort of work alcove.

 You open the bench seat, revealing a sewing machine, some fabric, a
 needle, some thread, a scissors and a magnetic handle.

 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the magnetic handle.


 Hall Closet
 Although the primary function of this room seems to be as a linen
 closet, its size suggests that it was intended for even heavier
 storage. Three of the walls bear shelves, neatly stocked with towels
 and bed linens.
 Somewhere, probably a few kilometers away, there is an explosion. The
 house rocks, and you have a hard time keeping your footing.

 You hear a great crash below.
>scan
 The scanner reveals nothing of interest.

>search linens
 You poke around at the sheets, and find, hidden in the folds of a large
 bedsheet toward the back, a pack of cigarettes, either squirreled away
 for an emergency, or hidden from a disapproving family member.

>examine cigarettes
 Toward the end of the twenty-first century, various lobbies finally
 succeeded in banning the manufacture and sale of these particular
 items, citing their known carcinogenic effects and the ongoing
 tendencies of their manufacturers to indulge in unethical business
 practices. Like the bans on so many other harmful intoxicants, the
 cigarette ban would have undoubtedly failed, had genetic engineering
 not coupled a non-toxic smoking mixture with powerful antidepressants,
 resulting in a new, safe cigarette, which provided an even better high.
 These, however, are still quite lethal, you're sure.

 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional

 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

 Shield Breach Poses No Threat, Pentagon Says

 Today, officials at the Pentagon released a statement regarding last
 week's destruction of the Alaska relay station for the sub-orbital
 missile defense network.

 Although many commentators have suggested that this breach will render
 the shield incapable of deflecting incoming nuclear attacks, Pentagon
 officials affirm that the damage to the relay station poses "no threat"
 to US targets.

 "The system was designed to deal with this sort of attack," said
 General Renault, director of shield operations in the northwest US,
 "And even with the loss of this station, other stations in the
 continental US and Canada will be able to cover most of the affected
 area. The only reduction in coverage will affect several small Alaskan
 islands and a limited area of northern Canada. Since these areas
 contain no significant military targets, the chances of this breach
 serving any tactical advantage to the enemy is effectively zero."

 However, not all observers are equally optimistic. Eric Blaine, of the
 independent nuclear defense research group at Pacific Tech, fears
 worse. "The shield itself is an inherently unstable system. The current
 implementation was secure only so long as it remained intact. Though
 the shield itself still covers everything but some uninhabited regions
 of Alaska and Canada, these areas can be made to serve as a gateway.
 With the weaknesses this breach has introduced in the shield, it might
 be possible for a missile, launched from China, to enter the shield
 through its weakpoint."

 Pentagon officials have denied the validity of Blaine's research. An
 announcement from Congress later in the morning requested the
 disbanding of the independent nuclear defense research group.

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

 Behind the Stairs
 The ceiling over this stretch of hallway slopes upward where the stairs
 cut into it. Along the south wall, just before the ceiling becomes too
 low to make a serviceable hallway, a low, louvered door marks a small
 closet. The hallway continues east, and to the west it ends in an
 archway leading to the dining room.

 Dining Room
 When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
 of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
 room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
 dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
 undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
 of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
 area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
 uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
 of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
 in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
 nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
 portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
 small door is west.
 A lean and dangerous-looking man surveys the contents of the room.

 On the buffet are two oil lamps.

 Den
 As an architectural feature, the den declined in popularity during this
 part of the century, but this house seems to have one nonetheless. From
 your historical research, you know that a den is a sort of cross
 between a study and a family room. This room shows signs of wear;
 stains and worn patches of carpet suggest heavy use. Behind one
 recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored
 from frequent collisions. One wall is covered in bookshelves. A
 well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a
 conversation area in the middle of the room. The western wall is open,
 leading back to the stairway.
 A lean and dangerous-looking man surveys the contents of the room.

 On the bar are four glasses (empty) and some bottles.

 A video game system sits before the video screen.

 You can also see a video screen and a video disc player (empty) here.

>turn off cloak
 That would give away your presence.

>examine cloak
 A standard-issue cloaking device. Operating along similar principles to
 the StreamDive device itself, it causes all photons entering the field
 to be instantly transported to the far side of the field as if they had
 passed straight through it, with the net result being that anything
 within the field is nearly invisible. The relocation effect causes
 "ghost" photons to be emitted by the inside of the field, allowing any
 person inside it to see his surroundings with a minimum of visual
 distortion. The device's battery is currently charged to 32 percent.
 The cloaking device is currently switched on.

 The video disc player is empty.
 On the edge of your vision, you think you see something move. You whip
 around, but nothing's there. It takes several deep breaths to get
 yourself under control. You're suddenly overwhelmed by the realization
 that all of this is going to cease to exist in a just under five hours.
 You punch the air in frustration. It's not just that there's so much to
 left to learn here. It's not even that you've started to feel that your
 dive restrictions have closed certain areas of investigation to you.
 What really bothers you is the stupidity of it all. The sheer waste.
 Why does this place have to be destroyed? What possible benefit could
 it be to either side? It's insane. It's stupid. How could the people of
 this time have such a cavalier disregard for human life?

 And, of course, the misgiving you have whenever you Dive this close to
 your own time hits you... How can you be sure we've really come that
 far from this?

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

 The indicator light switches from blue to green. The thought occurs to
 you that this is an exceptionally bad color choice for someone who,
 like you, suffers from a mild genetic deficit in the color perception
 department. However, you've been around long enough to be familiar with
 the change in hue that indicates clearance for a StreamDive.

 Your elation is such that it takes you a few seconds to respond to the
 indicator -- a critical error, though not a fatal one. You touch the
 control, and are further pleased to find that your mission hasn't been
 scrapped due to your moment of indecision. The full text of your

 StreamDiver Prep Room
 Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room
 where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do
 background research, monitor incoming messages from Divers in the
 field, and hope that one of your mission proposals will be accepted. On
 the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this
 room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations. The
 exit is east.

 The display monitor stands against one wall, your mission description
 visible on its screen.

 You can also see an equipment locker (closed) here.

>go east
 [Once you leave this area, you will be unable to return. Are you
 certain that you are ready?]

>yes
 You walk out of the Prep Room, down the long corridor, and into the
 Dive section. A number of sensors verify that you are carrying no
 contraband, and make a detailed record of your relevant bio-data, which
 is compared to your records to ensure that you are indeed the person
 scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record
 will be compared again when you emerge, to ensure that nothing
 important about your physiology has altered during the dive. The only
 visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.

 Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
 where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
 renders you free of micro-organisms.

 You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an
 indentation by the next door, where ultrasonic "needles" inject you
 with the requisite immunity boosters, which always gives you the
 pleasant feeling of being, at least temporarily, totally impregnable to
 disease.

 One more room, and anticipation would increase your heart-rate enough
 that a sensor might declare you medically unfit for duty. Fortunately,
 this room is the last.


 StreamDive Core
 You stand in the core of the StreamDive Temporal Relocation Unit. Far
 below you, an artificial singularity waits to propel you backward in
 history. The room itself is a huge dome, totally black, but lit from an
 unseeable source. There is always gooseflesh on your arms when you
 stand in this room. It is not a friendly room, not a relaxed room. This
 is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
 than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
 design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
 time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
 itself, neither part of the present nor the past.

 It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.
 A voice materializes from nowhere in particular. "StreamDiver Alpha
 Tango-678, StreamDive will commence in thirty seconds. Good luck, and
 Godspeed."

>wait
 Time passes.
 The floor fades to transparency. There is a brilliant point of light
 somewhere far below you. Scanning beams trace over your body. Below
 you, a perfect mirror image of yourself fades into existence, your
 avatar. You have a sinking feeling as your avatar falls toward the
 light. Just as you were trained, you roll back on the balls of your
 feet and close your eyes. In your head, you count to six. Deep down
 there, your avatar enters the event horizon of the artificial
 singularity. As always, you have the disconcerting sensation of
 falling...

 Cold.

 Hot.

 Bright.

 Dark.

 The pain is gone before you feel it. You want to open your eyes, but
 you know better. Even if you survived the experience, your sanity would
 not. You wait for the sensation of falling to end.

 It does.

 You wait for your perception of local timespace to return.

 It does.

 You open your eyes.


 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down,
 presumably to the basement.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

>go down

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 1], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

>go down
 That door is locked.

>yes

 Okay [Footnote 2].

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Basement
 The basement of this house is a simple, large room with cinderblock
 walls. Boxes, crates, and other large items are scattered haphazardly
 about. A lightweight wooden door in the east wall appears to be an
 exterior exit, presumably to allow heavy gardening equipment, such as
 the lawnmower in one corner, to be removed. The stairs up to the rest
 of the house are along the south wall.
 And something unusual. The west wall is metal, with a very large,
 robust door set in it.
 It couldn't be. Or could it? You've never actually seen one before, but
 from your records...
 Yes. It is. It's a bomb shelter; a small room specially designed to act
 as an emergency shelter in the event of nuclear attack. None have
 survived to your own time, and records are fragmentary. This is quite a
 find. If only you could manage to get inside.

>go west
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Bomb Shelter
 This is career-making stuff. A period survival shelter, fully intact
 and operational. The ceiling and walls form a single-piece dome, which,
 you recall, increased the structural stability with the building
 materials they had available. The eastern end, nearest the exit, seems
 to be some kind of living area, with a table and several chairs. Past
 it, you can see four bunked beds. At the far end of the shelter is a
 curtained area, holding the minimal sanitation facilities.

 Finally, your training releases its hold over your mind and lets you
 take notice of what would have been the first thing anyone but a
 StreamDiver would see. Two female bodies, quite motionless, lie on one
 of the beds. You don't need to check for a pulse on either of them
 [Footnote 3], but you do, all the same.

 Still warm. Your hands tremble, and it takes a moment to force yourself
 to calm down. You've seen dead bodies before, on missions. Victims of
 the massacre on Mars Colony Omega, ritual sacrifice victims in an Aztec
 temple, but the immediacy of these deaths is something you weren't
 prepared for. They can't have been dead for more than a few hours, may
 even have died while you were in the house. You try to tell yourself
 that this is an irrelevant detail -- from your proper perspective,
 they, and everyone else on the planet, have been dead for hundreds of
 years.

 It doesn't help.

 The smashed and broken pieces of some electronic device are scattered
 around the room.

 A small metal box is mounted on one wall.

 On the table are an electronic device and a portable computer.

 We were supposed to do it together. That was the plan.

 We thought it through, talked about it over and over.

 Nothing else made any sense. The safety broke down. The door isn't
 going to open for thirty years. We can't just stay down here for thirty
 years. And what about her? We can't take care of that on our own.

 Still, we might have tried. We might have been able to work something
 out. But we haven't heard anything upstairs for days. Not that you can
 hear much, but sometimes there's a little banging in the pipes.

 That damned radio. My hand's all cut up from smashing it to bits.
 There's going to be an air strike. They don't know where yet, but there
 isn't any way to stop it. We're less than a hundred miles from the
 biggest military base in three states. Even if we survive, no one's
 going to find us. No one's going to save us.

 So we decided. I unlocked the box. I took out two pills...

 This is all my fault. If I hadn't been so damned paranoid, we wouldn't
 even be down here. It's my fault that Donna's dead. It's my fault that
 I'm going to be dead.

 We were going to do it together. We laid down on the bed, next to each
 other, and she hugged me, and she told me she didn't blame me, and then
 we were going to bite down at the same time and it would all be over.

 I'm such a fucking coward.

 I don't think she felt anything. I hope she didn't know what a coward I
 am. She closed her eyes, and I closed mine, and then she just sort of
 shook once, and it was over. And I got up, and I laid her out flat and
 crossed her arms over her chest.

 What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't want to live. I never cared if
 I lived or died since the accident six years ago, and I sure as hell
 don't want to live down here for the next thirty years, especially now
 that Donna's gone. I tried to kill myself once before. All I have to do
 is bite down.

 So why won't my hands stop shaking? I'm going to do it now. For real
 this time.

 I'm not getting back into the same bed with Donna. I don't deserve
 that.

 I hope my parents will forgive me. I hope Jim will forgive me. Most of
 all, though, I hope Donna will forgive me.

 Goodbye.

 Current Events
 April 25

 This morning, at 7:42 AM, Congress ratified a declaration of war
 against an alliance of countries in the Middle East. The official
 reasons for this declaration were the unlawful occupation of Israel by
 allied Arabic forces. Nonetheless, several articles in the Global
 Register suppose that recent military action was motivated by trade
 restrictions imposed by the Arabic Alliance against Europe and the
 United States. These restrictions have severely limited the
 availability of gasoline in the US. According to the April 20 issue of
 the National Chronicle, the Arabic states have formed an exclusive
 trade pact with China. The Brandenberg News Network has run several
 stories saying that Chinese weapons were used in the invasion of
 Israel, and editorials in several newspapers claim that if the war
 escalates, China will enter the war on the side of the Arabic Alliance.
 An article in the Times says that the Chinese newspapers have already
 printed articles calling for war unless the US backs out of affairs in
 the Middle East.

 Bomb Shelter
 This is career-making stuff. A period survival shelter, fully intact
 and operational. The ceiling and walls form a single-piece dome, which,
 you recall, increased the structural stability with the building
 materials they had available. The eastern end, nearest the exit, seems
 to be some kind of living area, with a table and several chairs. Past
 it, you can see four bunked beds. At the far end of the shelter is a
 curtained area, holding the minimal sanitation facilities.
 The smashed and broken pieces of some electronic device are scattered
 around the room.

 A small metal box is mounted on one wall.

 On the table are an electronic device and a portable computer.
 Two corpses lay on opposite cots.

>search corpses
 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine left corpse
 She would have grown up to be quite attractive. For that matter, she
 actually was quite attractive, despite the disheveled appearance and
 short unruly tangle of red hair. One eyelid is sunken, as if there is
 nothing underneath. You can see no sign of injury, and her repose is
 fairly tranquil.

 Wait. There is something. One hand is scratched badly across the
 knuckles. But that couldn't be the cause of death.

>search it
 Mustering your resolve, you make a quick check of the body. Clutched in
 one hand, you find a blue prosthetic eye.

>take eye
 You already have that.

>examine right corpse
 The body lies on the bed, arms folded. Its owner is quite beautiful by
 the standards of the day, long, blonde hair, sizable breasts, and a
 frailty that suggests borderline anorexia. The only mar to her beauty
 is a deep, jagged scar on one cheek. There is nothing to suggest that
 her death was anything but peaceful [Footnote 4].

>examine scar
 You see nothing which can be referred to like that.

>go east

 Basement
 The basement of this house is a simple, large room with cinderblock
 walls. Boxes, crates, and other large items are scattered haphazardly
 about. A lightweight wooden door in the east wall appears to be an
 exterior exit, presumably to allow heavy gardening equipment, such as
 the lawnmower in one corner, to be removed. The stairs up to the rest
 of the house are along the south wall.
 And something unusual. The west wall is metal, with a very large,
 robust door set in it.

>u. n. open toilet

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 1], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

 Bathroom
 You get the impression that this bathroom has become a waystation for
 things that were intended for the basement, but got lost along the way.
 Boxes and bags seem to cover every surface; the sink, the heating vent,
 the fixture. The way out is south.
 On a whim, you lift the heavy boxes and raise the lid of the toilet
 seat. The bowl has been drained, and resting inside is a small book,
 which you manage, with some difficulty, to retrieve before letting the
 boxes fall back into place.

>unlock diary
 (with the autokey.)
 The lock clicks open. Your hands almost tremble in anticipation. What a
 find!

 You open the book...

 What?

 It's encoded? Who keeps a diary in code? Well, obviously, Julia Yvonne
 Wallace does. You can't help but wondering what could make someone so
 paranoid as to go to the trouble of encoding a locked, hidden diary.

>s. u. u. e. n.

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 1], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.

>open dollhouse
 You give a gentle tug at the base, which pops open. Inside, you see two
 letters (a crumpled letter and a folded letter) and a strange book.

 Fucking mom read my diary. Now she wants me to see a fucking shrink
 again. I'm not doing it. I'll be eighteen in less than a month, she
 can't make me. Two years they made me go after the accident. I don't
 fucking want to go back.

 Anyway, the rest of the aftermath is that they forbade me to ever see
 CJ again. Like they could stop me if I wanted to. And they somehow
 think he's the only person I could get pot from? Mom says that he just
 got me stoned so he could fuck me, which is fair since I wouldn't have
 let him get my panties off if I'd been in a legal state of mind. Well,
 maybe I would've. So I told mom, It's not like he's the only guy I've
 ever had sex with.

 Which is, of course, a lie. Everyone probably thinks I did Rob, but I
 didn't. He went down on me a couple of times, but before he got up the
 nerve to try anything more, I broke up with him coz I caught him
 staring at my eye while we were making out.

 Even him. Most guys get freaked out by it and won't come near me.
 Probably think the rest of me's robotic, and it'll electrocute their...

 Well anyway, I'm keeping two diaries now. This one, the legit one, I'm
 going to hide better. Anything really important, like this, I'll code.
 The other one's hidden in my room, so if anyone goes looking again,
 they'll stop when they find it. Maybe I'll put plants in there too, so
 I can tell if mom reads it again. I told her I'd fucking run away if
 she tried.

 April 18 - Jim's a bastard. He did it again. Snuck in while I was
 asleep and recalibrated my eye. When I woke up, I was seeing everything
 in infrared.

 Some days I want to rip the damned thing out with my bare hands.

 April 19 - Mom won the battle of the wills. Had my first appointment
 with the new shrink today. Of course he's all like, We'll talk about
 anything you want, but of course what he really wanted to talk about
 was the accident. So I went through my routine, and told him how big
 and scary it was, and told him about getting the new eye and all that
 shit. And he keeps asking how things made me feel, and I tell him I
 don't remember, but he doesn't believe me because apparently you're
 supposed to remember all the fucking details when something messes up
 your life. I really don't remember feeling anything. Just numb. So then
 he asks me about CJ, and he goes on for half an hour about how drugs
 are bad, and sex is bad. Well, he didn't say sex is bad, of course,
 since they're supposed to be all about fostering a healthy attitude
 toward healthy adult relationships, but you get the idea. It's natural
 to want to express your bullshit bullshit bullshit, but it's important
 that you find a healthy and safe outlet bullshit bullshit. I think
 there was something in there about my body changing and mateuring, like
 I'd just hit puberty or something. Then he gave me a pamphlet about
 masturbation, which I guess is some kind of implication that I couldn't
 work it out on my own.

 Anyway, mom's making me go back next week. I guess it's okay since it's
 her dime.

 (wonder why they say "it's your dime." Why not "it's your dollar?"
 Makes a lot more sense. Least you can buy a pack of gum for a dollar.)

 April 20 - Dreamt last night. The unbelievable pleasure of feeling a
 knife being thrust into my chest.

 Mom didn't take the bait. Maybe she's not still snooping on me.

 April 22 - They're sending troops into the middle east. Everyone says
 not to worry and we'll just clear this up like we have before. There's
 not going to be a war. But we've already got troops in so many other
 places. Jim's terrified that he's gonna get drafted. There hasn't been
 a draft in almost a hundred years though. The news says this will blow
 over in a couple of months, but Jimmy says that the president's an ass
 and he wants a war to boost his popularity rating. Dad thinks he's an
 idiot because no president would think that starting a war and getting
 hundreds of our people killed would make him popular. Maybe I should
 start reading the papers more.

>go north
 April 23 - Strangest thing today. I found a note in my locker. It took
 me a while to figure out what it was. It's the old code Donna and I
 used to use. But Donna moved away years ago when her parents split up,
 and I haven't heard from her in years. I have to find the old code book
 so I can work out what it says. I can't think how she could have gotten
 the note to me at school.

 Page: 4 April 24-26

 P = previous page    N = next page
 Q = resume story    G = Go to page

 April 24 - Donna's back. I can't believe it. Her mom ended up in jail
 because her boyfriend was using her house to store his meth lab -- will
 you believe that? She still has her codebook after all these years.
 Anyway, I've written back to her, but I don't know how to find her. I
 guess her dad still lives near here, but he moved out of their house
 after the divorce. How did she find out my locker number? It'll be good
 to talk to her again.

 In other news, CJ keeps trying to talk to me. I can't risk anyone
 seeing us together right yet. Wish I'd come up with a code book for
 him, then we could talk freely at least. Maybe I can get Donna to be a
 go-between. There's no one else I trust.

 April 25 - Jim keeps going on about this new program he's working on.
 Thinks it's going to, and I quote, "set him up among the gods." He's
 trying to get in touch with a bunch of professors at the big-league CS
 schools. Thinks he's hot stuff. Dad, who really ought to know better,
 asked him about his new "discovery", and he went on for about an hour,
 not really saying anything that made much sense. The long and short of
 it is that he thinks he's figured out how his brain works, and he
 thinks he's got a way to make a computer do the same thing. Wonderful.
 A computer that thinks like my brother.

 April 26 - Return of the Shrink. This time he didn't ask about the
 accident at all. I don't know if that's a good thing. I kept getting
 the feeling he was looking for some good dirt about my mom beating me
 or dad trying to feel me up when I was six or something, like there's
 some deep dark secret that will magically explain why I'm so fucked up.
 What the hell does he want? When I was twelve, a drunk driver hit the
 car I was in and I broke an arm and a leg and one of my eyes got cut
 out. I think that might be a fair enough explanation.

 Oh my god.

 Donna's mom was driving. She was in the back seat with me. I think that
 might have been the last time I saw her.

 Why didn't I ever remember that before?

 April 27 - There was fighting last night. Southeast Asia. I didn't even
 know we had troops there. Congress was in session all night. The news
 says they're going to declare war. I am really, really scared.

 April 28 - I saw Donna today. She looks pretty good, except for a scar
 on her cheek. I could tell she was avoiding me. Why? I bet she saw my
 eye. I almost decided to scrap the whole thing, but I really want to
 talk to her. I slipped the note I wrote in her locker. I keep telling
 myself I don't care if she wrties back or not. That's bullshit, of
 course.

 April 29 - She wrote me back. Said she was afraid to talk to me because
 she thought I blamed her for the accident. At least that explains why
 she never wrote to me before. I'm writing back to tell her I'm not
 angry and want to see her. I think maybe the reason I didn't remember
 before is that I didn't want to hate her.

 April 30 - I finally got to talk to her. Donna just kept apologizing
 about the accident. I sort of got fed up and nearly walked off. I asked
 her about getting a note to CJ. She said she would. Talked for a long
 time about life and stuff. I've really missed her.

 She was pretty good about it, but I caught her trying to get a good
 look at my eye a couple of times. It didn't bother me as much as usual.
 Maybe because I kept on looking at her scar.

 May 1 - Donna got my letter to CJ. She's none to thrilled about it,
 thinks he's an asshole. She's probably right, but what am I going to do
 about it?

 I finally asked Donna about the scar, and yeah, she got it in the
 accident. She's really self-conscious about it, but she's not as bad as
 I am about my eye. I think it makes her look tough. At least she's not
 some kind of freak like me.

 May 3 - I give up. Told the doctor everything I could remember about
 the accident, getting the implant. Told him about CJ. Donna too, about
 her being in the car. Told him about talking to her recently too. Not
 sure why.

 He asked me how I felt about the war. I don't know. They're still
 saying it won't last long, but we're dropping bombs all over Asia now.
 If it goes a couple of years, maybe they will draft Jim. I know I say a
 lot about him, but I don't want him to die. They won't draft me because
 of my eye, but they could take CJ or Donna.

>go north
 When I was fourteen, I threw a tantrum over something or other and Dad
 took Frankie the Bear away as punishment. I never got him back. Started
 thinking about that last night because found the eye I tore out after
 the accident. I told the doctor that too. Wow, I'm even more fucked up
 than I thought.

 May 4 - I managed to convince mom to let me out of the house. Went to
 the mall with Donna. Was thinking about seeing CJ, but didn't want to
 push my luck so we just shopped.

 On the way back, Donna decided to push her luck and ask me about my
 eye. I guess she's entitled. I showed her the tuner, and told her about
 the stupid pranks Jim keeps pulling. I even popped it out and let her
 look at it close up. She thinks it's neat and asked why I don't do
 stuff like use it to cheat on tests by turning up the zoom. Said she
 thinks it's better than having a big-ass scar on her face. That kind of
 pissed me off. Least she looks human. Why doesn't she get it?

 Then she said that if it bothers me so much, I should get cosmetic
 contacts to cover it up. I never thought about that before.

 I asked mom about getting contacts later. She said she didn't think
 they were safe. Of course, next week I'll be able to do as I like about
 it.

 May 5 - I finally got to see CJ. Just a few minutes; Donna covered by
 telling mom she had to stop to pick up a prescription on the way home.
 We had just about enough time to pass the bowl around once and let CJ
 cop a couple of quick feels. We're going to get together later this
 week. Mom likes Donna because she's "stable", and since I haven't had
 any friends worth speaking of since, well, her, she can pretty much
 talk mom into anything. We're composing a cover story now.

 May 6 - You are not fucking going to believe this. They've started up
 the draft. And what's more? They're not taking girls. I know, they've
 never taken them before, but they said that they would now, since
 they're all "liberated" and shit.

 Anyway, why aren't they taking girls, you ask? Well, there was a
 fucking commercial. A fucking commercial explaining how important women
 were to the war effort, and that's why they're not drafting them. And
 the way they're important to the war effort? You're gonna fucking love
 this -- reproduction. They're saying that it's "The duty of all
 citizens to make full use of their reproductive capabilities to ensure
 that our population remains strong and growing through these times of
 adversity."

 What is this, the fucking dark ages? In addition to their
 heart-fucking-felt sermon, they've voted in a massive tax-break for
 families with newborns, a government handout for women who get
 themselves pregnant, and subsidies for unmarried women who want
 artificial insemination. They're also rushing through a bunch of
 fertility drugs that increase the chances of having twins. The got some
 low-level flunkie in one of the fringe groups on record saying that it
 was the "sworn duty of every woman to attempt conception", and that
 parents should encourage their daughters to get themselves knocked up
 as young as fifteen. They're trying to fucking breed themselves an
 army.

>go north
 But it'll be what, twenty years before any of these war babies are old
 enough to fight. The war can't go on that long, can it?

 May 7 - Oh the shit has hit the fan. There's rioting in the streets.
 The people who don't like the war are protesting the war. The people
 who don't like the draft are protesting the draft. Pretty much everyone
 is protesting the breeding plan, except for the ones that are lined up
 around the block to get a big fat shot of fertility drugs and the big
 fat check that goes with it. Mom's friend that works for a doctor says
 that they've been asked not to tie anyone's tubes or give out
 contraceptives anymore. I found out that Jim's stockpiling condoms, on
 the off chance he manages to get a girl who doesn't think the rest of
 him's as ugly as his face. Says there's a bill in congress to restrict
 the sale of anything that prevents pregnancy.

 Donna's friend Rusty is talking about signing up. She's trying to talk
 him out of it, but he figures his draft notice is in the mail already
 anyway.

 May 8 - CJ has been selected by his friends and neighbors to represent
 his community in service to the United States Military. Which is to say
 that they want to send him over to China to get killed. I am
 surprisingly ambivalent.

 He acted all scared and even cried a little. I imagine this was an act
 to coax me into sleeping with him. I can't say how well it worked,
 since he did it over the course of about three joints, which would have
 worked on its own.

 Donna's all hot and bothered over CJ's friend Tom (I think "hot and
 bothered" is a great expression. Saw it on TV last night.) & they went
 off to fool around for a while. He hasn't been drafted yet, but the way
 things are going it looks like he will be.

 May 11 - When I got up this morning, my eye hadn't recharged. Hope I
 don't have to get the damned thing serviced. I couldn't go anywhere, of
 course, because I had to leave it on the charger all day. But Donna
 came over and we hung out. She went out with Tom last night and had a
 good time and all.

 She thinks the eyepatch makes me look tough.

 May 12 - Eye worked today. Guess I had it in the charger wrong or
 something.

 May 13 - Donna's dad got "activated", which means he has to ship out.
 He does something technical for the navy, so it's not like he's going
 to the front or anything, but she's still scared. He wants her to go
 live with her grandmom. We talked to mom, and she said it would be okay
 if she stayed with us at least until the end of school. Her grandmom's
 an 80 year old woman with about a hundred cats.

 May 14 - Episode 2 of "The government does stuff you thought only
 pissant little third world dictatorships did." Donna's mom is pregnant.
 They offered to reduce her sentence if she let them inseminate her.

 There's some kind of good-bye party for the guys who got drafted down
 at the VFW Friday night. CJ wants me to go. Mom wasn't too thrilled
 about it, but Donna's going, so she can't very well stop me.

 May 15 - Well, the good news is that Rusty got rejected because he's
 got a spot on his lung. The bad news is that Tom did get drafted.
 Donna's spending the night with him, which I'm sure thrills her dad no
 end because he ships out tomorrow afternoon.

>go north
 Today was my birthday. Happy birthday. Mom and Dad gave me a couple of
 movies and a self-help book. Subtle. Jim got me some computer dohickey
 I didn't want or need, and programmed my eye to flash "Happy Birthday"
 a bunch of times, which I guess would be cute if it hadn't pissed me
 off. Donna told my parents she hadn't had time to get me anything but a
 card, but later she gave me a pair of contact lenses. It must have
 taken some work to get them, since she's too young to buy them on her
 own and you usually have to get fitted for them, I think.

 May 17, 4:36 AM - Fucking party. Turns out the whole thing was set up
 by one of those wacko grotps. Figured it was important for "our noble
 soldiers" to "leave ther genetic contribution to America's future."
 Read: date rape party. Donna & I managed to narrowly escape with the
 same amount of virtue we came with. Hud to kick somf 60 yr old redneck
 who thphht wf should "sohw our appreciation so th boys fnr defdndign
 our country" in the ballr. i feel drty just bieng there.

 whgn we got there, cj was leaving his gendtic contribution in some
 slut. Likes ftcking her so much he should trz fucjign himself.

 Me & Donma bot some bopze @ a place she knows doesnt card to drink &
 tamk abovt what a looser bk is. Shfs passt out drunk on my bed. Hauhng
 wfsd thots. Like right before she femn alseep I really wantd to jirr
 ifs.

 Eye jurt went ded. Too tirfd tp kedp coding. Brobably cnding like shjt
 anyway.

 May 17 (later) - Fell asleep without taking my eye out so it's dead
 today. And no one ever told me how much it hurts if you sleep with
 contacts in. Told mom I was too sick to see the shrink today, which
 isn't far from the truth. I managed to get Donna down to her bed before
 mom went to wake her up for breakfast. As if we could eat. We crashed
 in my room most of the day so no one would see how sick we were.

>go north
 I let her get a good look at the hole in my face where my eye goes. She
 wasn't grossed out or anything. She asked me if I wanted to touch her
 scar. It was a little weird because you can feel little bumps where
 they stitched her cheek closed.

 May 19 - The fighting has escalated. Last night, one of our islands in
 the pacific got wiped off the map. That many people could just wink out
 of existence like that, and the world just goes on.

 May 20 - Rethinking yesterday's entry. We've been bombing the country
 with the largest population in the world for weeks now. Maybe we got
 what we deserved.

 May 23 - There is no Laos.

 May 24 - The doctor's changed his tune. Says I should find a nice boy
 and try to build up family ties. In other words, he's one of them.
 Wants me to get myself knocked up. He even said, and I quote, "In this
 day and age, there really isn't an shame in being a single mother, even
 at a young age." Mom says I don't have to go anymore.

 May 25 - Set up family ties with a nice boy? Fuck him. Besides, about
 the only boys that haven't been drafted are cripples and felons. And
 Rusty, of course, but I get the feeling he's looking to set up family
 ties with a nice boy himself.

 May 26 - Mom is moving most of the valuables into long-term storage. As
 in "make Jim go out in the woods and dig a deep hole to hide them in."
 Won't help. We're all going to die.

 May 27 - Air raid drill at school. Yes. Duck and cover. Fuck your
 mother.

>go north
 May 28 - Dad took me aside this evening under the pretense of helping
 him check the furnace. He isn't sure if there's room enough in the
 shelter for Donna. I told him I had to think about my response to that.

 May 29 - I told dad that my response was that if he thought he was
 going to sneak the family down to the basement and lock Donna upstairs
 to get blown up, he could fuck himself. Basically, I said that I wasn't
 going to lock myself in the 30-year deep freeze without her. He said
 he'd work out something, that maybe we could stretch the supplies out
 enough for a fifth. That was after he slapped me for swearing at him,
 of course.

 He did something else weird, too. He showed me how to open the lock box
 that the cyanide pills are in. Said that if the time came, he thought I
 might be the only one strong enough to do what had to be done.

 I think he knows that the lead-lined casket in the basement isn't
 really going to save us.

 The last thing he said before shoving me back upstairs was that he
 didn't want to insult me, but he had to make me promise that I'd *only*
 use the pills if I had to. Maybe it's weird that he trusts me enough to
 tell me, but it would have been better if he could do it without being
 afraid that I'd off myself when he wasn't looking.

 May 30 - Something's bugging Donna. She won't talk to me about it. I'm
 worried.

 May 31 - Donna didn't come home last night. She showed up late this
 afternoon with a lame story about spending the night at her place
 because she had gotten involved in packing some things.

>go north
 June 1 - Sometimes I think it would be a lot better if I just died now.
 I don't really want to die any more, I just don't care. But I'd like to
 be in control. The whole fucking world could end any day now. At least
 if I did it myself, I'd know when it was coming. I'd have some say in
 the matter.

 June 2 - Donna is still acting funny. I wonder if she's worried about
 her dad.

 June 3 - As close as I can tell, I'm a free woman again. Mom and Dad
 aren't watching me constantly, and I can pretty much come and go as I
 please, with the caveat that I can't stay out too long, what with the
 imminent possibility of he bomb killing us all.

 But I'm worried about Donna. She wanders off for hours at a time,
 doesn't say anything.

 June 4 - Jimmy's got himself a girlfriend. How cute. She's a
 rolly-polly little thing with coke-bottle glasses who thinks the sun
 rises and sets on him because of his brilliant invention. Maybe his
 stockpile won't go to waste after all.

 Yeah. And maybe my eye will grow back.

 June 5 - They've cancelled graduation due to war. Fuck.

 June 6 - I forgot what I wanted to write. When I went downstairs to get
 my diary, I stopped by the door to Donna's room. Was gonna see if she
 was still up. I heard her crying. Should I have gone in?

 June 7 - We're sending troops into Vietnam. Where have I heard that
 before?

 June 9 - Donna asked me to try on some of her clothes. I don't like
 wearing a skirt, but she said I have really nice legs & I should show
 them off. Nice legs? Anyway, I hope this means she's feeling better,
 but there was something distant about her. About the only thing she was
 willing to talk about was the time I slit my wrists. Morbid.

 June 10 - Rained all day today. After watching a whole lot of TV, we
 basically just sat around. I worked on new pages for my code book while
 Donna just sat there and watched me.

 June 11 - More rain. I think Donna's close to breaking. I was laying in
 bed with my eyes closed, making the firm decision not to get out of bed
 until dinner, and she came in around one in the afternoon and asked if
 she could lay down with me. She got in bed and just lay there for a
 while, then she started crying. I put my arm around her and tried to
 get her to talk about it, but she didn't say anything. Just lay there
 sobbing for about three hours. Then, she just got up, thanked me, and
 left. Later, she was like nothing had happened.

>go north
 She wants me to go to Rusty's tomorrow for a social evening (and cheap
 booze. But Rusty makes a good fuzzy navel.) I said I would.

 What order should I write this in? This is big.

 Donna's pregnant.

 Donna kissed me.

 Now that the big points are out of the way, I'll get on to the details.
 Rusty isn't big on wild parties; it was just me and Donna and him and a
 couple of his friends siting around and drinking. After a couple of
 games of Beiruit, Donna needed help standing so she could throw the
 ball. She said she wanted to lie down for a while, so Rusty let me
 carry her to his sister's room -- she moved out a year ago. I was going
 to leave her for a while and go back to the party, but she asked me to
 stay. So I sit on the bed, and she's kind of hanging on me, and about
 twenty minutes go by, and then she tells me. Actually, she tells my
 arm, which is where her head was. She was way late so she got a
 pregnancy test from the drug store and however many lines showed up. So
 now I know why she's been so weird. I tell her that she shouldn't
 worry, and she has to take the test again to be sure, and maybe she
 should see her doctor. But of course her doctor's in Oklahoma, and she
 doesn't want anyone to know. She asks if I know anyone who can take
 care of it, because she won't keep it, and she hears that they're
 paying off abortion doctors to not take any patients, and they keep
 geting bombed by the war-baby people anyway, but of course I don't. So
 she cries for a while and hugs me and stuff, and she tells me how
 scared she is. I tell her that I'll do whatever she needs. I don't have
 a whole lot of money, because CJ was making me pay for pot most of the
 time, but I could sneak a bunch of shit from my parents, now that mom's
 got everything hidden, so if she needs cash to pay for it, I could do
 that. Or anything else she needs from me. She just wants me to keep
 holding her while she cries, so I do. And after a while she wants to
 lie down, so we do, and we just sort of cuddle for a while. She calms
 down some, so she starts talking about her mom, except she keeps
 calling her a coked-up whore. She talks some about her dad too, and how
 she thinks he's going to die.

 SYNC

 Eventually I ask her if she's told Tom. She hasn't, of course, since
 he's off in boot camp, and she's not going to tell him because she
 doesn't want him having that on his head when he goes off to die for
 his country. While we're lying there, I get to thinking. I've always
 thought I was so alone, but then I think about Donna, and her coked-up
 whore mom in jail, her dad and her boyfriend going off to play
 soldiers. She says I'm just about the only friend she has in the world
 which is just about what I'm thinking at this point. And she sort of
 puts her hand behind my head and starts kind of playing with my hair. I
 start to get the feeling that she wants me to kiss her, but I'm not
 sure whether it's the booze or the loneliness, or the being afraid, or
 what, so I'm not sure it's a good idea even if I want to, which I'm not
 sure of either, but she takes matters into her own hands and kisses me.

 I kissed Donna one time when we were thirteen, on a dare, but it was
 just, you know, the kind of kiss you do on a dare. This was serious. It
 was a good kiss, as close as I can tell. I'm not gay or anything, I
 don't think, but it was still a good kiss. She didn't say anything
 afterward, just went back to crying until she fell asleep. I think this
 is as far as it's going, which is good.

>go north
 I wish I had been able to stick around until she woke up. I slept with
 her. Next to her, rather. But I slipped out early in the morning to
 clock in so my parents didn't bust a gasket over it. Left her a note.
 She hasn't come home yet, but she might still be asleep.

 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.

 Stephen James Wallace
 Pioneer in human-computer neural interfaces and neural cybernetics.
 During the wars of the twentieth century, his familiarity with the
 internal workings of the human brain led to his being pressed into
 service as a neurosurgeon. After the wars, he applied his considerable
 computer skills to building brain implant devices which could restore
 brain function lost due to injury or illness. He received the Nobel
 Prize in 2086 for his work with stroke and brain cancer victims. Such
 modern inventions as the neural navigation interface and the artificial
 voice box owe much in their design to his work.

 You let the optical unit charge for a few minutes. When you remove it,

 your memory serves, take several hours. There's no way that the
 technology of this period could build a charger capable of such speed.

 The viewpoint of the camera suggests that the wearer is seated in front
 of a portable computer. Her hand reaches out and picks up a small
 device beside the computer. She turns it over, presumably examining it
 from all angles. The hand turns the device until its barrel-end points
 directly into the camera. A finger twitches, pressing a button. A flash
 of light issues from the end of the device, and the image flickers,
 distorts, and breaks up.

 When the image returns, the device has been dropped to the table. The
 wearer stands, and the camera reels in unsteady ascent. Again a hand
 reaches out, this time to switch the computer off. It takes a small red
 pill from the table, and then moves to the wearer's mouth.

 The camera turns quickly, and moves toward one of the bunked beds. It
 focuses on the motionless body of a beautiful blonde girl. The image
 switches to infrared, showing the characteristic cooling of a recently
 deceased body, then the camera changes back to the visual spectrum. The
 camera bobs up and down, as if slowly nodding. It moves toward the face
 of the dead girl, and stays very close to one cheek for a long time.
 The camera withdraws, and the wearer extends a hand, tracing the
 shoulder and arm of the corpse, finally coming to rest atop the folded
 hands. The wearer's hand squeezes the dead hands once, then the camera
 turns toward the opposite cot.

 The camera moves toward the cot, then turns and lowers, finally
 pitching back as the wearer lies down. A hand moves toward the camera,
 and as it passes in front of it, the recording ends.

 Remarkable. This is an LZ-50 prosthetic optical unit, the first
 commercial replacement eye. This explains the sunken eyelid on the poor
 dead girl -- she must have had a prosthetic eye. But this... You could
 stand here all day and admire the workmanship. You would never have
 suspected that the technology of this period could develop something
 that could actually replace a human eye. And here you are... it's in
 your hand. You turn it over and over. It looks amazingly realistic.

 I'm glad you wrote me back. All these years, I've been scared pretty
 much shitless that you hated me, because it was my mom was driving that
 night when you lost your eye. I've really missed you all these years,
 and I would have talked to you in the hall, but every time I see you I
 lose my nerve. First I think that you'll hate me because of the
 accident, then I think maybe I should try to talk to you anyway, but
 then I think that you'll hate me for not talking to you for so long. I
 guess I'll understand if you want me to just steer clear and stuff, but
 please try to forgive me. God, I'm such a coward. I've really missed
 you. I don't know if you can ever forgive me, but I really want to let
 you know how sorry I am.

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.
 This image shows a young man in his mid-teens. He sports a pathetic
 attempt at a moustache. Though he shows all the awkwardness of
 adolescence, he apparently does know, at least, how to pose for a
 photograph. He has a very slight smile, and a look of interested
 curiosity on his face. He does show the awkward pockmarks of severe
 acne, made worse by the extreme fullness of his face. He is wearing a
 black shirt with a suede vest, which bears a small lapel pin, of the
 sort distributed by academic honor societies.

 Boy's Bedroom
 Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
 of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
 course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
 more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
 that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
 that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along

>examine linoleum
 You don't recall any precedent in home furnishing that would call for
 industrial grade linoleum in a bedroom, but it is here nonetheless.
 Since you can't imagine that the floor is an artifact from an earlier
 function of the room, it is somewhat perplexing that such a floor would
 be present.

 Boy's Bedroom
 Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
 of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
 course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
 more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
 that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
 that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
 one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
 books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
 The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
 the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
 appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

 The papering on the walls shows vaguely technical schematics for the
 first reusable space vehicle. You can't imagine what it must have been
 like; a society so impressed by a model of space vehicle that it would
 make its way into something so mundane as wall coverings. It must have
 really been something for the people of this time. You have to remind
 yourself that for these people, space travel was still risky business.
 The very idea that they could reliably send something up, outside their
 little planet, and then bring it back again... It must have been
 absolutely wondrous to see something like this go up.

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

 Hallway, west end
 The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point
 of view. You can see where the stairway meets the hall to the east, and
 doors are located along the north, south, and west walls.

 A framed photograph of a young woman graces one wall.
 The image shows a young woman dressed in simplified academic regalia.
 She wears a formless gown in an unflattering blue pastel with a
 mortarboard cap. The girl in the picture looks about the right age for
 this photograph to be commemorating a high school graduation, though
 there are signs that she might be older; her expression is one of
 world-weariness, and her disapproving frown merges into lines on the
 face which suggest that this is an accustomed expression. You imagine
 that she would be quite attractive, if not for the scowl which seems to
 be permanently burnt into her face.

 An unnatural reflection causes you to notice her right eye, which,
 under close scrutiny, is apparently artificial. Though the prosthesis
 is good enough to pass for the real thing under casual scrutiny, it
 does lack the bloodshot look of the left eye, and you can make out the
 segmentation of a mechanical iris. If the color had been a better match
 for her left eye, you might well not have noticed.
 [The document "Graduation Photograph" has been added to your

 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Master Bedroom
 Generally speaking, you learn more from a dirty house than a clean one;
 intensive cleaning tends to remove much of the anthropological evidence
 about the day-to-day affairs of the occupants. You can tell that
 whoever lived here had some warning before they evacuated, time enough
 to at least do some preliminary straightening up. The bed, which is
 opposite the door, under the smaller of the room's two windows, is
 neatly made, the wastepaper basket between the door and the dresser is
 empty, and the two night tables on either side of the bed are both
 clean and freshly polished. A full-length mirror hangs on a door to the
 north. The hallway is east.

>look under bed
 You paw around under the bed for a moment. Your search turns up a small
 piece of metal, which looks like a simple key.

>open dresser
 (the dresser drawers)
 You open the dresser drawers, revealing an antique key.

>take antique key. x it.
 Taken.
 This is a key of some antiquity. It consists of a metal shaft, with a
 loop at one end, and a blade at the other. If you recall correctly,
 this sort of key was sometimes called a "skeleton key".

>unlock mirror with simple key
 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

>open mirror
 That's not something you can open.

>go north
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Master Bathroom
 You are in a bathroom, unusually large and attractively decorated.
 Aside from the free-standing whirlpool bathtub, there is a separate
 shower stall. A counter, the central feature of which is a
 three-paneled mirror which wraps around the sink, spans one wall.
 Architecturally, the room itself is fairly simple; a rectangle with
 plain white walls and a simple black-and-white tessellation on the
 floor tile. The decor gives the room more life; delicate just-green
 lace window drapery contrasts elegantly with the deep green of the
 heavy rug in the center of the room. The counter is equipped with a
 wicker dish full of soaps which you assume are more decorative than
 functional. A wooden table under the window holds a vase of dried
 flowers. The exit is south.

 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter.

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 1], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the antique key.

 Arcotech (Arcotech Home Survival Technologies)
 Manufacturer of blast and survival shelters for private homes during
 the twenty-first century. The company made enormous profits during the
 years leading up to the intercontinental war at the middle of the
 century as interest in survival shelters grew to a height unprecedented
 since the "Cold War" of the third quarter of the twentieth century.
 Although their products were generally considered the highest quality
 available during their time, the shelters were not capable of
 withstanding the more powerful nuclear and quantum weapons used during
 the war, and the company eventually declared bankruptcy. Their product
 lines were eventually bought by Amalgamated Industries, inc.

 No shelters built during this period are currently known to exist.

 Amalgamated Industries
 Manufacturing megacorporation of the North American Continent.
 Following the trans-continental war of the twenty-first century,
 Amalgamated Industries bought over 90% of the manufacturing companies
 in the western hemisphere. It was one of the companies involved in the
 events of the Seventy Days, and collapsed soon afterward.

 Historical Period: The Seventy Days
 Term used to describe the period from September to November of the
 old-calendar year 2102. Reconstruction after the wars of the previous
 century left most of the world in the debt of seventeen
 megacorporations. On September 12, 2102 (old date), the
 megacorporations foreclosed on the collective nations of the world, and
 assumed legal control of the planet. They were met with little
 resistance from world populations, who had grown dissatisfied with the
 national governments. Though their leadership was able to provide rapid
 improvement of living conditions for many inhabitants, the task of
 managing an entire planet proved too much for the megacorporations, who
 soon discovered that the world as a whole could not be run profitably.
 After several administrative fiascoes, the most notable of which
 involved the firing and eviction from Earth of the entire population of
 Canada, the corporate consortium itself declared bankruptcy exactly 70
 days after its inception, thrusting the world into anarchy.

 The United Earth Directorate quickly arose to fill the infrastructure
 created by the consortium, becoming the first true one-world
 government.

 Cylinians (United Cylinz Confederation)
 The first contact between Humans and non-human intelligence came in the
 form of a Concordance delegation sent to meet the first superluminal
 Earth ship. The Concordance had monitored Earth for some time, and
 chose to send a delegation composed primarily of Cylinians, due to the
 marked similarity between the two races.

 Physically and socially, Cylinians are almost identical to Humans. The
 only external physical differences deal with pigmentation (All
 Cylinians have blue or brown eyes, and the skin around their eyes is
 darker. Otherwise, they are identical to Humans native to southern
 Europe. With a minimum of cosmetics, a member of one species could
 easily pass for the other), and the two species are even capable of
 interbreeding [Footnote 7].


 Source: CASFR member race database

>footnote 7
 [Footnote 7]
 In fact, Cylinians and Humans are not truly different "species",
 according to the traditional definition of the word. The fact that two
 races on different planets could develop nearly identical genetic code
 has led many to postulate the existance of some older "parent" species.

 Dear Julia,
 I hope to God you get this letter. We waited for you as long as we
 could, but they're saying that the bombs could fall any day. There's a
 shelter out in New Calvert, we're going there. Daddy says its the
 safest place in a hundred miles. Try to get there if you can, but don't
 take any risks. The most important thing is that you stay safe. I left
 some money and your grandmom's jewels in the hidden place for you. Your
 dad bought a gun and bullets, and put them there too, but be careful.
 We all love you and hope to see you again.

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

 Back Hallway
 A poorly-lit length of hallway begins here and continues west. The
 southern wall is open to the living room. A door leads east.

 Powder Room
 You are in a very small bathroom, fitted out as you would expect, in a

 On the fixture is a scientific journal.

>examine journal
 This is a magazine whose articles showcase current events in the
 scientific community. It is written to a target audience of educated,
 but not scientifically trained, readers.
 You browse through the magazine, looking for anything of interest. You
 are not disappointed. There is a short article, all the way at the
 back, summarizing the doctoral thesis of one Emmanuel Kaldeki.
 This is quite a find; Kaldeki's original thesis has long been lost, and
 it has long been assumed that he had not pursued the line of research
 that would eventually lead to StreamDive technology until after the
 war. You read the article...

 Physicist Emmanuel Kaldeki created a buzz in the scientific world early
 this month with the delivery of his PhD thesis, "Mathematical Modeling
 of Non-Temporal Quantum Particles" at the Pacific Institute of
 Technology. The paper describes a set of mathematical formulae which
 model a theoretical particle called "Q-omega". The Q-omega particle,
 according to Kaldeki's model, behaves in most respects like a
 strange-matter quark, but also exhibits properties previously only
 modeled in tachyons. Specifically, it reacts in unusual ways to
 space-time curvature. The Kaldeki model suggests that that at
 relativistic velocities, the Q-omega particle would "plane" on highly
 curved space-time, in much the same way that the hull of a speed boat
 planes over water.

 Most of the excitement over Kaldeki's paper comes not from the modeling
 technique itself, but from the two major example models included. The
 first demonstrates how the non-temporal nature of the Q-omega particle
 renders it immune from the effects of time and mass dilation occurring
 at speeds near that of light. Indeed, because of their unique nature,
 the model shows that Q-omega particles can be accelerated above the
 speed of light, a possibility generally disallowed by the theory of
 relativity.

 The second, and more impressive example studies the behavior of Q-omega
 in the vicinity of a black hole. Under such extreme space-time
 curvature, Kaldeki predicts that the Q-omega particle would completely
 disassociate itself with conventional space-time, being displaced along
 a predictable path to some distant point in the universe
 instantaneously. Because the path of the particle does not go through
 space-time during this journey, it is possible for Q-omega to re-enter
 normal space at a point in time prior to its departure.

 The scientific community is excited about the implications of this
 theory: several researchers have suggested that Kaldeki's findings may
 open the way to faster-than-light travel, matter transmission, and time
 travel. Asked about these possibilities, Kaldeki said, "I think it's a
 bit early to start talking about applications; we don't even know yet
 if the particles I've modeled can be created. There's nothing in the
 mathematics that would prohibit [these applications], but actually
 doing it is a long way off. You've got to remember, we're talking about
 sub-atomic particles, and if we could scale the effect to something the
 size of, say, a man, it's not very likely that a living creature could
 survive being moved around like that."

 Kaldeki has received a grant for an undisclosed amount to pursue the
 fabrication of these particles. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy in
 Quantum Physics will be conferred upon Emmanuel Kaldeki by the Pacific
 Institute of Technology during commencement exercises next month.

 Back Hallway
 A poorly-lit length of hallway begins here and continues west. The
 southern wall is open to the living room. A door leads east.

 A painting on the wall depicts a nautical theme.

 Behind the Stairs
 The ceiling over this stretch of hallway slopes upward where the stairs
 cut into it. Along the south wall, just before the ceiling becomes too
 low to make a serviceable hallway, a low, louvered door marks a small
 closet. The hallway continues east, and to the west it ends in an
 archway leading to the dining room.

 Dining Room
 When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
 of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
 room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
 dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
 undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
 of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
 area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
 uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
 of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
 in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
 nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
 portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
 small door is west.

 On the buffet are two oil lamps.

 You can see a photograph here.
 This is apparently a visual of the family that lived in this house. In
 the back stand two adults, a man whose receding hair looks unnaturally
 dark, wearing thick, horn-rimmed eyeglasses, and a woman, much shorter,
 who looks about the same age. She too wears glasses, with a more
 fashionable wire frame. Her front teeth, visible in what looks like an
 unaccustomed smile, are stained and crooked. A small scar is visible
 near the corner of her mouth. Before them are two children. On the
 right, a boy about ten, has a ridiculous smile and equally ridiculous
 bowl-cut. Beside him is a girl, probably a few years his senior. You
 aren't sure, but you think you see a glint of something reflective near
 her temple, where her hair is awkwardly combed over a bald patch. Her
 eyes are not quite the same color, though that may be a blemish on the
 photograph. There does certainly seem to be something odd about her
 right eye, but you can't tell on a photograph this size.

 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.
 A grade report has been affixed to the refrigerator door:

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Living Room Closet
 This was originally a walk-in closet, but with the quantity of items
 which have accumulated here, it has become more of a stand-in closet.
 You are sure that if the building weren't doomed, it would eventually
 have turned into a lean-in closet. Between the well-stocked coat rod
 and a number of boxes, there is just enough room for you to turn around
 if you feel like returning west to the living room.

 On the coat rod are a winter coat (in which is a sales brochure), a
 light jacket (empty), a windbreaker (empty), a gray suitcoat (empty), a
 black suitcoat (empty) and a smoking jacket (empty).

 Arcotech Home Survival Shelters

 Arcotech Home Survival Technologies offers the finest quality shelters
 for home survival in times of national crisis. Arcotech shelters are
 rated to offer secure protection against:
  *Blasts
  *Fallout Radiation
  *Vandalism
  *Looting
  *Terrorism
  *Weather and Climate Emergencies

 Arcotech shelters are:
  *PAATO approved for use in emergency situations
  *designed for use with concrete or earth coverings, or as above-ground
 shelters
  *built from a heavily-tested, original, patented design
  *tested successfully in full, one-third, and one-quarter scale models
 by the US Army Corps of Engineers, US Air Force, and Pacific Institute
 of Technology Engineering Sciences Laboratory
  *available in a large range of sizes to accommodate many different
 needs
  *equipped with the latest in survival equipment and fully stocked with
 supplies meeting the FWPSC 1.2037 standard for long-term survival
  *installable in most existing homes and buildings
  *fully customizable to meet specific user needs and concerns

 This booklet details just a few of the many survival features
 available. Contact your Arcotech Sales Representative for a full list
 of features, special options recommended in your area, and pricing
 information.

 Construction
 Arcotech shelters are built with the highest degree of precision
 technology to provide optimal support and security. Shelter roofs and
 walls are built from high-tech steel corrugated arch panels to ensure
 maximum strength and load-bearing. The corrugated design allows
 high-quality seals between arch panels so that shelters can be built of
 any length.

 Arcotech shelters come standard with heavy steel endwalls. For added
 protection, concrete endwall reinforcements are available. Due to the
 patented interlocking all-steel design, additional layers of protection
 can be added to the arch or endwalls.

 For the ultimate in radiation protection, lead insulating sheets may be
 added.

 All Arcotech shelters come with a reinforced heavy steel door. Thick
 security bolts ensure that the shelter cannot be breached. Many
 Arcotech shelters include a secondary egress hatch, which can be
 installed in the roof with a minimal reduction in structural integrity.

 Life-support Equipment
 Arcotech shelters include the latest in high-endurance life support
 equipment. All Arcotech shelters are equipped with both secure
 ventilation systems for processing outside air, and with an advanced
 air recycling system. In emergencies, the shelter can be sealed and
 operate entirely on stored air reserves for up to six months at a time.
 When outside air is safe for use, it can be used to replenish internal
 supplies in a matter of hours.

 The water recycling system standard on Arcotech shelters is able to
 provide adequate, safe water supplies over extended periods. With
 strict water rationing, the shelter is able to recycle approximately
 85% of its stored water. Optional accessories include facilities for
 collecting and purifying water from surface runoff and underground
 deposits. The standard water storage system included with each Arcotech
 shelter contains sufficient reserves for three months of use. With
 water recycling and collection, usable water may be replenished
 indefinitely.

 Sanitation and waste-disposal facilities in Arcotech Shelters are
 second to none. The low-energy waste incinerator reduces all human and
 other waste products to compact ash, which is stored in the insecure
 waste pit. Waste pit capacities vary with space availability, but are
 generally large enough to store several years worth of waste.

 The standard equipment for Arcotech home survival shelters includes a
 30-year supply of nonperishable food stocks designed to meet all
 nutritional needs. Users with infants and small children are advised to
 consider ordering the optional child nutrition supplement.

 In addition for stocks of first-aid supplies, the medical stores
 standard in Arcotech shelters include medical equipment and medicine
 for treating minor maladies and injuries, along with detailed, useful
 information on their use. To foster adequate health and morale, most
 shelters are capable of increasing the normally dim lights to output
 sun-like spectra for limited periods. By using this feature several
 times a week, occupants can avoid depression and diseases caused by
 lack of sunlight.

 Arcotech shelters are powered by a patented high-performance chemical
 induction system, which can deliver operating power to the shelter for
 at least 30 years without replenishment. For above-ground shelters,
 solar power cells are also available. The energy source is suitably
 shielded from EMP effects which may accompany nuclear attacks.

 Accommodations
 Arcotech home survival shelters come standard with accommodations for
 families of four, six, eight, and twelve persons. Accommodations for
 larger groups may be custom ordered.

 Standard accommodations include comfortable, high-durability bedding
 with optional privacy screens, a dining and utility table with chairs,
 personal storage compartments, and durable survival clothing. Efficient
 kitchen, laundry, and toilet facilities are also provided, as is a
 privacy-screen area for low-water washing.

 Because of the importance of maintaining morale during an extended
 stay, Arcotech shelters also contain minimal facilities for relaxation,
 exercise, and entertainment. All non-value-line models of Arcotech
 shelters include a "relaxation area", consisting of a foldable couch
 (which may be raised to form an exercise area), small television with
 video and music player, and storage space large enough to contain a
 small library or children's toys.

 Security/Survival
 All Arcotech shelters are equipped with the following minimal equipment
 to facilitate survival in times of crisis. Many other options are
 available. Contact your Arcotech Sales Representative for a full list
 of features recommended in your area.
  *Easy-to-use radiation meters
  *Two 30" 22 mag. cal. single-action rifles and ammunition for personal
 defense and hunting
  *Shortwave radio and transmitter
  *Desktop computer with wireless network connection
  *"Panic" locking mechanism: Shelter egress can be secured so that its
 entryway cannot be opened from inside for a specified time, or until
 radiation levels are safe, to prevent early egress in the event an
 occupant becomes unreasonable
  *Cyanide capsules: stored in a locked box, also fitted with a panic
 locking mechanism, are provided as a painless alternative to radiation
 sickness or degenerative illness
  *Government approved survival instructions: Arcotech is the only
 shelter manufacturer to equip each shelter with all of the Federal
 Government's latest survival instruction booklets. Other manufacturers
 often use dangerously out-of-date materials, some nearly a century old

 Arcotech: Your Life May Depend On It

 You notice that the document mentions nothing about protection from
 photo-nuclear weapons. Though the document is grossly limited in its
 treatment of technical considerations, you quickly realize that such a
 shelter would not provide adequate protection from even non-nuclear
 attacks closer than a few dozen kilometers away. Its primary utility
 rests in protecting its occupants from residual radiation released by
 fallout from a distant bomb strike. Of course, a far less opulent
 shelter would still provide adequate defense under such circumstances.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

 Hallway, west end
 The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point
 of view. You can see where the stairway meets the hall to the east, and
 doors are located along the north, south, and west walls.

 A framed photograph of a young woman graces one wall.
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Sealed Room
 You are in a small, dark room that appears to have been unused for
 years. The only feature worth noting is a wooden ladder which leads to
 an opening in the ceiling. The exit is north.

 Attic
 There is barely enough room to stand upright in the attic. It certainly
 looks too small to be of much use for storage. It's nearly impossible
 to move without clocking yourself on a supporting beam.

 You can see an unlabeled data disc here.

 By now, the political alliance of European and American countries is
 engaged in a war against countries in the middle and far east. This
 conflict will last several years, and result in several billion deaths.
 The war will be ended when Space Station Kennedy crashes near the
 Chinese capital city.

 However, the war can be ended more quickly, and with a reduced loss of
 life if nuclear weapons from the United States can be effectively
 deployed in the Chinese mainland. The defensive screen which prevents
 nuclear weapons from reaching Chinese soil uses a simple 512-bit
 identification code to differentiate between friendly and unfriendly
 missiles. If a nuclear missile were to transmit the data sequence
 generated by the Plotnitz-Leibkin algorithm at a frequency of 906.4
 MHz, Chinese countermeasures would mistake the missile for a Chinese
 launch, and would be unable to eradicate it before it reached its
 target. The tactical advantage afforded by this ability will
 undoubtedly force the eastern alliance to capitulate with a
 substantially reduced cost in both lives and damage to the world
 ecosystem.

 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Walk-in Closet
 From the architecture of the house, you can tell that this is the only
 bedroom to have its own walk-in closet, which no doubt was an issue of
 some discussion when bedrooms were assigned. The majority of the closet
 is taken up by clothing, but you can see a few boxes toward the back.

 Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
 Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
 Possibly the darkest period in recent history, this period contains the
 last and largest of the intercontinental wars. Several Middle Eastern
 nations formed a military alliance, and began imposing expansionist
 policies on neighboring countries. When the United States threatened to
 cut off trade relations with these countries, the formed a lucrative
 trade alliance with China. Because during this period, industrialized
 nations were still highly dependent on fossil fuel, an alliance of
 western nations declared war on China and the Arabic alliance. Tactical
 nuclear warheads were used by both sides, resulting in the near-total
 annihilation of many US-sympathetic countries in southeast Asia. Though
 US nuclear weapons were unable to breach Chinese countermeasures,
 several Chinese nuclear missiles did penetrate the US defensive system,
 obliterating a number of cities. The war was finally ended when the
 massive space station Kennedy crashed to Earth near the Chinese
 capital. The resulting explosion killed over two billion people,
 forcing the Chinese government to capitulate. However, widespread
 environmental and war damage left the entire world badly crippled.
 Reconstruction would take much of the next century, and the extensive
 costs of rebuilding the damaged world forced the beginning of
 governmental alliances that would eventually lead to a United Earth
 Government.

 Your mission occurs during the opening of the nuclear phase of the war.
 At 785278.83 UDC, a missile launched from China will exploit the breach
 in the US missile shield. Nine hours later, its course will be diverted
 away from Washington, DC to avoid US countermeasures. It will narrowly
 miss a secondary target, several miles from your Dive site, at 865741.8
 UDC.

 Space Station Kennedy
 Space Station Kennedy
 The first orbital platform intended for permanent occupation, Space
 Station Kennedy was assembled in Earth orbit in the second quarter of
 the twenty-first century. Compared with earlier projects, Kennedy was
 ambitious; it contained living facilities for twenty-five families,
 and, unlike earlier space stations, its primary function was not
 scientific, but industrial. Methods of zero-gravity production which
 had previously been tested on earlier space missions were implemented
 on a grand scale. It was also the first space vehicle to be equipped
 with a synthetic gravity system. After two decades of service, the
 station was badly damaged during the intercontinental war of the mid
 twenty-first century. Its crew were not able to prevent a forced
 re-entry, and chose to direct the crashing space station to a heavily
 inhabited area of China. Everyone aboard the station was killed in the
 resulting explosion, which also resulted in severe environmental
 catastrophes in Asia, prompting the end of the war.

 is taken up by clothing, but you can see a few boxes toward the back.

 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.

 On the edge of your vision, you think you see something move. You whip
 around, but nothing's there. It takes several deep breaths to get
 yourself under control. You're suddenly overwhelmed by the realization
 that all of this is going to cease to exist in a just under five hours.
 You punch the air in frustration. It's not just that there's so much to
 left to learn here. It's not even that you've started to feel that your
 dive restrictions have closed certain areas of investigation to you.
 What really bothers you is the stupidity of it all. The sheer waste.
 Why does this place have to be destroyed? What possible benefit could
 it be to either side? It's insane. It's stupid. How could the people of
 this time have such a cavalier disregard for human life?

 And, of course, the misgiving you have whenever you Dive this close to
 your own time hits you... How can you be sure we've really come that
 far from this?

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>go down

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 A fairly simple coatrack stands in the corner, partially eclipsing the
 air vent along the wall.

 Living Room
 The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
 does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
 room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
 "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
 video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
 living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
 an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
 the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
 a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
 are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
 the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
 conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
 the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

>open cabinet
 That's already open.

>look in cabinet
 In the video cabinet are a video screen and six video discs (one
 "Episode Two", one "Jigsaw", one "Spider and Web", one "Symetry", one
 "War of the Worlds" and one "Best Chefs").

>go north

 Back Hallway
 A poorly-lit length of hallway begins here and continues west. The
 southern wall is open to the living room. A door leads east.

>go west

 Behind the Stairs
 The ceiling over this stretch of hallway slopes upward where the stairs
 cut into it. Along the south wall, just before the ceiling becomes too
 low to make a serviceable hallway, a low, louvered door marks a small
 closet. The hallway continues east, and to the west it ends in an
 archway leading to the dining room.

>open closet
 It seems to be locked.

>go west

 Dining Room
 When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
 of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
 room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
 dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
 undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
 of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
 area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
 uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
 of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
 in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
 nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
 portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
 small door is west.

 On the buffet are two oil lamps.

 You can see a photograph here.

>examine cabinet
 The opulence of the china cabinet is a stark contrast to the
 nondescriptness of the rest of the room. Delicate carvings adorn the
 surface, and a floral pattern is set into the frosted glass of its
 doors.

>go south

 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

>go down

 Downstairs Landing
 The house is even bigger than you initially thought; this level is not
 a basement. Standing at the foot of the stairs, the door leading to the
 basement proper is in front of you  [Footnote 1], while fully-fledged
 rooms lie in the other cardinal directions. Another, smaller room lies
 to the northwest.

>go east

 Den
 As an architectural feature, the den declined in popularity during this
 part of the century, but this house seems to have one nonetheless. From
 your historical research, you know that a den is a sort of cross
 between a study and a family room. This room shows signs of wear;
 stains and worn patches of carpet suggest heavy use. Behind one
 recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored
 from frequent collisions. One wall is covered in bookshelves. A
 well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a
 conversation area in the middle of the room. The western wall is open,
 leading back to the stairway.

 On the bar are four glasses (empty).

 You can see a video screen and a video disc player (empty) here.

>look behind recliner
 You find nothing of interest.

>search recliner
 There is nothing on the armchair.

>go west

 Office
 The small office is furnished much as you'd expect for an office of
 this period. There is a bookshelf along one wall, furnished more with
 office supplies than with books. The only exit is east.

 You can see a computer here.

>take it
 That's hardly portable.

 There is nothing on the bookshelf.

 Nothing of note; a few books on computer operation and general

 closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
 foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

 Living Room Closet
 This was originally a walk-in closet, but with the quantity of items
 which have accumulated here, it has become more of a stand-in closet.
 You are sure that if the building weren't doomed, it would eventually
 have turned into a lean-in closet. Between the well-stocked coat rod
 and a number of boxes, there is just enough room for you to turn around
 if you feel like returning west to the living room.

 On the coat rod are a winter coat (in which is a sales brochure), a
 light jacket (empty), a windbreaker (empty), a gray suitcoat (empty), a
 black suitcoat (empty) and a smoking jacket (empty).

>examine ceiling
 You see nothing special about the ceiling.

>examine boxes
 Boxes are piled high. The bottommost ones appear to be neatly stacked,
 but the more accessible ones are positioned more haphazardly.

 Pantry
 This is a small room, designed to hold food staples and cooking
 equipment not housed in the kitchen. You doubt you'll find anything
 worthwhile in here, but you've been a StreamDiver long enough to know
 better than to trust appearances. You can return east to the kitchen.

 Shelves line the walls, sparsely stocked.

 On the shelves are some pots and pans, a lazy susan (empty), a flour
 pot (closed) and a can of spiced ham (closed).

>examine ham
 This is a can of compressed, meat-like substance, which, though only
 barely meeting the definition of "food", could have provided an easy
 meal in an emergency.

>open can
 Better not; as it is, this is probably the only thing in the house that
 could survive the impending nuclear blast.

 Dining Room
 When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
 of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
 room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
 dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
 undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
 of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
 area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
 uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
 of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
 in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
 nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
 portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
 small door is west.

 On the buffet are two oil lamps.

 You can see a photograph here.

 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

 Hall
 You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
 purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
 showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
 and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
 polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
 hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 Upstairs Landing
 The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
 which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
 in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.

>e.e

 Hallway, east end
 You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
 ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
 one.

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 Boy's Bedroom
 Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
 of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
 course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
 more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
 that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
 that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
 one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
 books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
 The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
 the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
 appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

>clean linoleum

 Girl's Bedroom
 Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
 and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
 the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
 jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
 stereotypes of their living space.
 Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
 particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
 from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
 dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
 corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
 ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
 insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
 certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
 quarters.
 The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
 well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
 The exit to the hall is south.

 On the nightstand is a charger.

 You can see two keys (a simple key and an antique key), a prosthetic
 eye, a real diary, a code book and a fake diary here.

>clean dresser with polish
 (the dresser with the furniture polish)
 You apply some of the furniturepolish to the dresser, and wipe it away.
 The polish soaks into the bare wood where the finish has been
 scratched, and the single word "SERENDIPITY" becomes visible on the
 surface.

 Guys, we've got a problem. Like, a BIG problem.

 I was watching the feed from Coach Lynch's eye today after school,
 right? So she's in her office after practice and Libby Sikes comes in,
 ok? And they're talking for a while, but I can't hear what they're
 saying, of course. After a while, Lynchzilla shuts the door, and a
 couple of minutes later, she's feeling Libby up.

 I ran the video by Marty, since he's deaf and reads lips. From Libby's
 side of it, it looks like she's gonna get cut from the team, on account
 of she sucks ass at field hockey. And, we're not too sure on this, but
 it looks like Lynch is gonna let her stay on the team if she fucks her.

 Lynch should go to jail for fucking a student, but no one but us knows
 about it, and all the proof we got is this recording, so if we give it
 to the cops, we'll be in the cell right next to her. We should never
 have done this.

 So what should we do?

 Dante

>research liberty
 LibertyNet
 Originally an outgrowth of a research project in distributed document
 storage, the "LibertyNet Protocol" became widely used among less
 legitimate members of the digital subculture in the mid 21st century.
 The system propagated documents in a semi-anonymous manner so that
 users could choose to release a document which could not be traced back
 to an owner, and was similar to the earlier "freenet" project. Though
 originally intended a method for free expression in countries lacking
 legal protection of free speech, it quickly degenerated into a
 marketplace for the exchange of pornography, bootleg music, and stolen
 computer software. Numerous attempts by various governments to shut
 down LibertyNet were mostly unsuccessful and increased its underground
 appeal. LibertyNet was eventually made obsolete by the Global Dataweb.

>research internet
 Internet
 Collective term for the services which made up the first widely used
 global computer network. The internet allowed messages, documents, and
 data to be quickly transferred between any two computers by forming a
 route between intermediate systems. The internet grew at a rapid rate
 in size and scale through the last years of the twentieth century and
 first years of the twenty-first. Its growth suffered major setbacks due
 to the wars and economic recessions of the twenty-first century, but it
 slowly subsumed all other means of communication and media. The
 internet eventually evolved into the Global Dataweb near the close of
 the 21st century.

>research freenet
 Freenet
 An early system for the anonymous distribution of documents via the
 internet. Its creators supported its use to circumvent intellectual
 property laws which they considered outdated. As it grew, difficulties
 with the system quickly became apparent, and it eventually fell into
 disuse in favor of a related system, "LibertyNet".

>research dataweb
 Dataweb (Global Dataweb; Web)
 Global data networks are reported as early as the last quarter of the
 twentieth century. By the end of the 21st century, the internet had
 evolved into the more familiar form of the Global Dataweb. The name
 "Dataweb" refers to the Dataweb Protocol, its major services (such as
 electronic mail, video communication, and document archive), and
 individual documents attached to it. When the Dataweb Protocol was
 introduced, nearly all electronic devices made use of it, from simple
 audio-visual communication and text messaging, to remote control and
 navigation systems. Though the system itself has changed little since
 its inception, the name has fallen into disuse.

 to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for

 A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

 Nook
 You are in a small room which you suspect has no fixed purpose. There
 is a table in the center of the room, with a faux-wooden chair at it,
 and a long bench-seat under the window. The door along the north wall
 has been removed, presumably in an attempt to turn the room into some
 sort of work alcove.

 three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.
 That door is locked.

 You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.


 Hall Closet
 Although the primary function of this room seems to be as a linen
 closet, its size suggests that it was intended for even heavier
 storage. Three of the walls bear shelves, neatly stocked with towels
 and bed linens.

>search linens
 You poke around at the sheets, and find, hidden in the folds of a large
 bedsheet toward the back, a pack of cigarettes, either squirreled away
 for an emergency, or hidden from a disapproving family member.

 The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point
 of view. You can see where the stairway meets the hall to the east, and
 doors are located along the north, south, and west walls.

 Bathroom
 In most respects, this is a thoroughly ordinary bathroom. It is far
 less clean than the public areas of the house, but not unsettlingly so.
 It is simple in decor, featuring a tub, toilet, sink, and no windows.
 The mirror over the sink protrudes slightly, suggesting that it
 conceals a medicine cabinet. The exit is south.
 If your history is right, it should be about now that the Chinese
 missile diverts its course away from the US capital to avoid an
 anti-missile missile. It redirects toward a minor target, a military
 base near this town.

 large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.

 On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.

 Kitchen
 In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
 processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
 life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
 even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
 kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
 other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
 predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
 are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

 On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

 Pantry
 This is a small room, designed to hold food staples and cooking
 equipment not housed in the kitchen. You doubt you'll find anything
 worthwhile in here, but you've been a StreamDiver long enough to know
 better than to trust appearances. You can return east to the kitchen.

 Shelves line the walls, sparsely stocked.

 On the shelves are some pots and pans, a lazy susan (empty), a flour

 The StreamDive console emits an audible warning: "Alert: Dive time
 expired. Discharging temporal capacitors."

 All at once, the universe goes away. Time itself cries out in distress,
 and every cell in your body echoes its cry. The laws of physics cannot
 be broken, but they can be bent, if only for a time. As the energy
 stored in your temporal capacitors discharges, time reasserts itself.
 If you were the sort to anthopomorphize physical law, you'd say that it
 was extracting some revenge against you for daring to transcend the
 barriers of time. Of course, all that you're really experiencing is a
 form of severe disorientation resulting from the unusual perceptual
 stimuli occurring outside normal time-space. It all goes away in a
 nothingth of a second, and you stumble backward to the floor of the
 StreamDive Core. White-clad technicians swarm into the chamber a second
 later, helping you into the postDive examination, which confirms that
 you have weathered the Dive intact, and cleanses ancient toxins from
 your system. Your possessions are taken for examination, and you are
 led to the debriefing room.

 StreamDive Debriefing room
 You are in a comfortably small room, used to debrief StreamDivers
 following their missions. The room is intentionally designed to avoid
 the impression that this is some kind of interrogation chamber, even if
 that is indeed its function. The room contains very little in the way
 of decoration or, well, anything at all, aside from the table and
 chairs.

 Time passes.
 Joxley Douzen walks heavily into the room. Though there are a few
 agents you'd prefer to serve as your evaluator, you could have done
 far, far worse. She scans over her notes, not seeming to see you until
 after she has taken her seat. "Welcome back," she says. You are
 naturally inclined to take the lack of feeling in her voice as a bad
 sign, but you resist the urge. It's all she's capable of; her voice box
 is artificial, and she's never managed to program it properly.

 "We've reviewed your findings. As you know, the purpose of this phase
 of your evaluation is to give you the opportunity to present anything
 you think may have escaped our attention, and to address any concerns
 which the evaluation team has about your Dive. If you'll take your
 seat, we can begin." [Footnote 9]

>sit on chair
 You get onto the wooden chair.

>examine joxley
 Joxley Douzen is a typical example of what your father would have
 called a "hard-looking broad". Muscular, stocky, with chiseled features
 that would have been distinguished on a man. She probably knows exactly
 how threatening people find her. You know that she's a touch bitter
 about her position as a Dive evaluation agent -- after she was injured
 in a shuttle accident, she received enough bio-mechanical implants to
 make her a walking, talking anachronism, and therefore unfit for
 StreamDiving. Nevertheless, your experience of her has always been as a
 fair evaluator.

>wait
 Time passes.
 "First things first. Based on your scans and our records, you surveyed
 about ninety-six percent of the area within your mission boundaries.
 Quite impressive. Now, are there any rooms in particular that you feel
 merit special attention?"

>boy's bedroom
 "Yes. Your console recorded some unusual readings from that area. We'll
 give it another look."

>bomb shelter
 Joxley lays a hand to her ear. "I'm sorry; I'm having some trouble with
 my audio processor. Maybe you could try a different word?"

>shelter
 "Ah yes, the survival shelter. That's a very impressive find. We looked
 over the notes, and we don't have any other incidents of a Diver
 exploring a survival shelter of that era. Good work."

 You go on to explain that you found the bodies of two recently deceased
 young women in the basement.

 Joxley looks through her notes. "Yes, I have that here. That
 contradicts what we had in our historical records -- you know, of
 course, that heads are going to roll in the approval committee for that
 little oversight. It's a good thing your Dive didn't take you back any
 earlier. If either of them had been alive, we'd have had a major
 violation of the first directive on our hands.

 "It's just a shame that you weren't able to use the Stream Visualizer
 inside the shelter. If the approval committee had known what you would
 find, they would have made sure to send you back with the right
 equipment."

>girl's bedroom
 "Hm... I'll advise the assessment team to take another look, but I
 think we've already considered that room thoroughly."

>done
 "Very well," Joxley says. She begins examining her notes.

>wait
 Time passes.
 "Okay. Now, let's consider the contents of your DataStore. It seems
 that you recorded twenty-five documents. It's a shame you didn't elect
 to take the Stream Visualizer. Of course, you were under tight
 restrictions. As for other documents, you appear to have done quite
 well.

 "Your DataStore contained an article from a scientific magazine. What
 about this article attracted your interest?"

>kaldecki
 Joxley lays a hand to her ear. "I'm sorry; I'm having some trouble with
 my audio processor. Maybe you could try a different word?"

>time travel
 The article, you explain, contains the earliest reference to Emmanuel
 Kaldeki's work on which would eventually lead to StreamDive technology.

 "A good find," Joxley says. "As you know, we have very little
 information about Kaldeki's research before the war. This find could
 lead to a revision of what we know about the history of time travel.

 "You also downloaded something too big to fit in the DataStore. We
 found it stored on a spare chip. What is it?"

>data
 Joxley lays a hand to her ear. "I'm sorry; I'm having some trouble with
 my audio processor. Maybe you could try a different word?"

>julia
 Joxley lays a hand to her ear. "I'm sorry; I'm having some trouble with

>image
 Joxley lays a hand to her ear. "I'm sorry; I'm having some trouble with

 Joxley raises an eyebrow, apparently not understanding you. "If you
 don't have anything meaningful to say on the current subject, just say
 the word and we'll move on."

 Joxley raises an eyebrow, apparently not understanding you. "If you

>done
 "I suppose we'll have to work it out for ourselves then.

 "Unfortunately, the memory recording you downloaded from the optical
 prosthesis was very short. What, based on your research, happened to
 the owner after the end of the recording?"

>suicide
 You say that you believe she died almost immediately after removing the
 prosthesis.

 Joxley writes this down. "Very tragic," she says.

 "Now, you found a diary in the downstairs bathroom. It appears to have
 been encoded using a very secure cipher. Given the nature of the writer
 and its content, the only explanation we can think of is that the
 writer was mentally unstable. How would you explain the fact that such
 effort was taken to encode the diary?"

>mother
 You explain that the author, Julia Wallace, had reason to believe that
 her parents were reading her diary without permission, and had encoded
 it to prevent the highly personal content from becoming public
 knowledge.
 Joxley raises an eyebrow. "It seems like a great deal of effort, but
 yes, that does explain what we've seen, and seems consistent with the
 details we've managed to piece together about the girl.

 "We've had some difficulty making sense of the code fragment you
 downloaded. Any idea what it is?"

>coach
 Joxley lays a hand to her ear. "I'm sorry; I'm having some trouble with
 my audio processor. Maybe you could try a different word?"

>libertynet
 Joxley lays a hand to her ear. "I'm sorry; I'm having some trouble with
 my audio processor. Maybe you could try a different word?"

>brain
 You say that you believe the author to be Stephen James Wallace, who
 was conducting experiments in artificial sentience.

 "Really? We knew Wallace had done important work in neural circuitry,
 but there's nothing on this scale in his later career. Unbelievable.

 "We're curious about the diary you found in the girl's closet. All our
 evidence suggests that the daughter was approximately eighteen years of
 age, but the textual analysis suggests that this diary shows a writing
 level more consistent with a much younger person. We suspect that this
 diary is either much older than the other documents you've collected,
 or that the writer was... to be indelicate, stupid. Perhaps you could
 offer an explanation?"

>fake
 You explain your theory that the diary is a fake; a red herring
 designed to throw off a snooping parent.

 "Fascinating," Joxley says. "That does explain a great deal.

 "I think that covers all the documents we need more information about.
 Let me check my notes, and we'll move on."

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.
 Joxley makes a few notes, then looks up. "All right then. Now we get to
 some more specific questions.

 "I suppose we should start with the most obvious. Your Dive was
 restricted to a family residence. How many people occupied this
 residence prior to its evacuation?"

>5
 Joxley raises an eyebrow. "Five? You're sure? Our research suggested
 only four residents. Who was this fifth person?"

>donna
 You explain that a young woman named Donna, a friend of the older
 child, had been living with the family near the time that the house was
 abandoned.

 Joxley makes a note of this. "Good work. This is exactly the sort of
 thing that isn't covered by our records of the period.

 "Now," Joxley says, "It appears that you violated your mission
 parameters by bringing something back from your Dive. Since everything
 in the area appears to have been destroyed immediately after you left,
 the committee has decided to recommend against disciplinary action, but
 there will be an entry made in your file, unless you can give us some
 exceptional circumstance which warranted your action. Is there any
 object which you felt had some extraordinary reason for being retrieved
 for examination?

>charger
 You tell Joxley that you suspect that the charger has somehow been
 altered so as to be anachronistic in its native time.

 Joxley pushes back from the desk. "That's a very serious claim. But
 from the logs in your console, it certainly merits more examination. If
 there has been tampering with the timeline, it's essential we locate
 the source.

 "What was the name of the female child?"

>julia
 "Marital relations between the Wallaces... Were they good or bad?"

>bad
 You explain that your impression was that they were not good.

 Joxley asks, "What justification do you have for that assessment?"

 You quickly realize that you have no proof to support your theory, at
 least, none that would satisfy the assessment team.

 "What was the name of the male head of household?"

>james
 "What was the name of the male child?"

>jim
 "What was the name of the female head of household?"

>katia
 "You say that the girl had an optical prosthesis. Which eye was
 artificial?"

>right
 "Okay," Joxley says.

 "You've claimed that there's evidence the timeline has been altered.
 Did you encounter anything else that might serve as evidence?"

>ham
 "Unfortunately," she says, "It doesn't look like there's enough
 evidence in your logs to verify that.

 "We have no postwar records of the daughter, and your findings suggest
 that she was not with the family when they evacuated. What became of
 her?"

>suicide
 You say that she committed suicide by ingesting a euphenasisa pill.

 "Thank you for your cooperation, agent," she says. After taking a few
 more notes, Joxley Douzen rises to her feet. "If you'll wait here, the
 review team will have your final evaluation shortly."

 Without paying you another glance, she strides out of the room.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.
 Joxley Douzen walks confidently into the room, followed by the rest of
 the evaluation team. They stand at the head of the room, staring
 heavily at you. Finally, Joxley speaks.

 "StreamDiver Alpha Tango-678, it is the finding of this evaluation team
 that you have completed the objectives for this mission with an
 approval rating of 90 percent. Absolutely exceptional. We're going to
 recommend you for a promotion."
