 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 At last, your troubled fortunes seemed to come to an end. It all
 happened very quickly: the callback from Red Hat, the bizarre interview
 with Human Resources, the handshake, the filling out of W-2 forms, and
 then your first day of work.

 You thought maybe your experience writing Interactive Fiction games
 (sixteenth place in the last IF Comp, a good improvement from 33rd
 place the year before that) had finally landed you a programming job.
 But no, you seemed to qualify only for menial clerical work. You took
 it. What else could you do? Sigh.

 File Room
 This bleak room with its short, slumping ceiling does nothing to
 brighten your morale. Short file cabinets, marked in reverse
 alphabetical order, crawl in a line along the walls like an army of
 stupid robots. One measly window lets in a tiny square of sunlight.

 You see a copier machine here.

>examine me
 You're Peter Feeney, a bright young guy with a healthy self-image. You
 do feel that life hasn't brought you the success and fame that you
 deserve, but that will come with time, in your humble opinion.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine window
 (the window)
 The window faces out to the north, getting a good view of the Red Hat
 corporate campus and the beautiful Research Triangle Park scenery. The
 window is closed.

 You see a copier machine here.

>examine copier
 The copier has a lid which covers a big pane of glass, and a panel with
 buttons. The big green button makes copies. That's all you've ever
 needed to push on it. In fact, your annoying supervisor, Melvin
 Prufrock, impressed upon you, at stammering length, how temperamental
 the machine is, and how expensive copier repair guys are. Bah.

 Melvin, your supervisor, gangles into the room. With his elongated
 height and pasty, translucent skin, he looks like the big funky alien
 at the end of "Close Encounters," only more puppet-like. He approaches
 you cautiously. Even though he's your boss, he always seems to be
 intimidated by you.

 "H-hi, Peter," he says.

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: Oh, hi Melvin.
 2: Go away, idiot.

>1

 You say, "Oh, hi Melvin."

 Melvin swallows, his dry throat making a thwupping noise that really
 turns your stomach. "Mmm. Making some copies there?" he asks.

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: No, I'm hacking into NORAD and launching Global Thermonuclear War.
 2: Yeah, pictures of Valerie's butt. Wanna see?
 3: (sigh) Yes, Melvin. I'm making copies. What's up?

>3

 You say, "(sigh) Yes, Melvin. I'm making copies. What's up?"

 Melvin fiddles with a small stack of folders in his sweaty hands. "I
 was wondering, um. Are you busy?"

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: Yes. I'm terribly busy. You'll have to come back later.
 2: What is it you want, Melvin?

>2

 You say, "What is it you want, Melvin?"

 "I was wondering if you could sort these for me," he says, handing you
 the folders. There are sweat stains on them. Stifling the urge to make
 a comment, you adjust your grip to touch only the dry spots.

>examine stains
 They're just sweat stains. Kind of large sweat stains. In fact, they're
 not just everyday sweat stains. They smell kind of funny, too.

 Melvin fidgets, waiting for you to finish.

>examine folders
 The folders are a stack of about thirty plain folders, currently
 unsorted.

 Melvin fidgets, waiting for you to finish.

>lick stains
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>read folders
 You flip through the folders, but none of it interests you.

 Melvin fidgets, waiting for you to finish.

>smell stains
 They smell funkily sweet, almost like antifreeze. Melvin must have been
 working on his car this morning or something.

 Melvin fidgets, waiting for you to finish.

>Melvin, goodbye

 Melvin fidgets, waiting for you to finish.

>talk to Melvin
 You can't think of anything in particular to say.

 Melvin fidgets, waiting for you to finish.

>sort folders
 You're actually pretty much of a whiz at sorting, which might be why
 you got the job you did. "Time me," you tell Melvin, and 13 seconds
 later you're done.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine clock
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine melvin
 Melvin Prufrock is a thin, translucent looking individual, with tics
 and other twitchy mannerisms passing for a personality. He is insanely
 tall, approaching six foot eight, but probably only weighs 130 pounds
 with clothes on. You don't even want to consider what he's like without
 clothes on. He also looks like he's about six years younger than you
 are, so about nineteen, and yet he's several rankings above you on the
 ladder.

 Melvin fidgets, waiting for you to finish.

>give folders to Melvin
 You start to hand them to Melvin, but he starts making a choking noise.
 You realize he's trying to tell you that you've sorted them into the
 wrong order again. For whatever reason, they like to use reverse
 alphabetical order in this company. Go figure.

>sort folders
 You re-sort the folders, taking only 11 seconds this time.

>give folders to Melvin
 Melvin says, "Excellent. You're really amazing at this. Oh, and could
 you file them now? I guess that's really what I was after." Without
 even giving you a chance to say no, Melvin hustles away. You swear you
 almost hear his bones clacking together when he moves that fast.

>file folders
 Well, let's see. The Z's are on top. The first one is labeled,
 "Zefferelli," so it should probably go into the Z cabinet.

>open z cabinet
 You open the Z cabinet.

>put zefferelli in it
 You stick the Zefferelli folder into cabinet Z and close the drawer.

>file folders
 (the sorted folders)
 Well, let's see. The Z's are on top. The first one is labeled, "Zarf:
 Classified," so it should probably go into the Z-Y cabinet.

>read zarf
 (the sorted folders)
 Eagerly, you flip open the "Zarf: Classified" folder, only to find that
 it contains a top secret patent application for the design of a new
 improved type of cup holder.

>open z-y
 The Z-Y cabinet drawer seems to be stuck. Not locked, just kind of not
 moving very easily.

 Inside you see filed documents.

>pull z-y
 Man, this cabinet is really stuck shut. Better try again. This time,
 with feeling.

 You feel a faint cool breath of air.

>pull z-y
 You give the stuck cabinet drawer the old heave-ho, and instead of
 merely opening, it yanks loose from the wall, revealing a strange,
 small door in the wall!

>examine door
 The strange secret door is only about three feet high, and painted a
 shade of crimson. Gold flecks in the paint give it a sparkly, almost
 magical appearance.

 It seems to be coming from the secret door.

 That's hardly portable.

>put zarf in z-y
 (the sorted folders in the Z-Y cabinet)
 You stick the Zarf folders into cabinet X-Y and close the drawer.

>examine door
 The strange secret door is only about three feet high, and painted a
 shade of crimson. Gold flecks in the paint give it a sparkly, almost
 magical appearance.

>open door
 A hush of ancient air, tinged with organic sweetness, flows out of the
 opened portal.

>smell air
 The air smells like old books, soft leather, caramel, and just a hint
 of cinnamon muffins.

 You find nothing of interest.

>file folders
 Well, let's see. The Y's are on top. The first one is labeled, "Y2," so
 it should probably go into the Y-X cabinet.

>read y2
 You flip open the top folder, but its contents don't interest you.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>open y-x
 That's already open.

>put y2 in y-x
 You stick the Y2 folder into cabinet X-Y and close the drawer.

>read folders
 You flip through the folders, but none of it interests you.

>enter door
 You pass through the portal into a dark tunnel, which sighs with
 melodic longing as you enter.

 Weird Tunnel
 You are on your hands and knees in a claustrophobic tunnel. It leads
 down, as nearly as you can tell, but your equilibrium is distorted in
 here. The curving walls gleam with the semblance of wet rock, but the
 palms of your hands tell a different story. It feels like organic
 tissue, a thick layer of hide, with the elastic strength of muscle.
 Like sharkskin, it is silken and slick in one direction but resists any
 backwards movement with a roughened grain.

 You have so far scored 3 out of a possible 12, in 64 turns.

>in
 You begin to crawl forward, the tunnel floor oozing and pliable under
 your knees and palms. The secret door bangs shut and disappears. The
 tunnel begins to shiver, and from up ahead a roar like a waterfall
 issues from the darkness. Your hands suddenly lose traction as gravity
 begins its quickening pull. You begin to slide down... down... down...

 At Zarf's Desk (in Zarf's head)
 Weird! You're inside Zarf's head!You see the opening of Zarf's eyes,
 giving you a sort of bifocal window into the surrounding environment.
 Outside of Zarf, you see a workdesk containing a gigantic computer
 monitor, a keyboard, tidy arrangements of notes, and a collection of
 little toys and knick-knacks.

 Inside of Zarf's head, you see weird flashes of light. A number of
 eerie sounds float around. You presume these effects are caused by the
 random firing of synapses in a very active mind. There are no exits
 that you can perceive.

 Zarf types some code into his computer.

>examine monitor
 The gigantic computer monitor is displaying a lot of complicated
 programming code.

 Zarf types more code into his computer, then saves the file.

>read code
 You are suddenly humbled by the awareness that you don't know the first
 thing about professional programming, because you can't tell what this
 code does, even though it looks quite organized, efficient, and
 well-commented.

 Zarf compiles his code.

>examine toys
 There are little colored shapes and game pieces, a couple of metal
 cubes sitting next to each other. There is a larger, third cube, an
 elaborate assemblage of puzzle pieces, plated with gold.

 Zarf traces down a typo, saves again, and recompiles.

>examine notes
 Beyond the fact that they're tidy, you can't really read what's written
 on them from here.

 Zarf takes a drink out of a glass.

 You're Peter Feeney, a bright young guy with a healthy self-image. You
 do feel that life hasn't brought you the success and fame that you
 deserve, but that will come with time, in your humble opinion.

 Zarf says, "It's in *California*?" His voice echoes, deep and
 resonantly, through his head.

 Nothing seems to have any real substance here, although it's hard to

 Suddenly, you are falling from a somewhat drastic height at the usual
 9.8 meters per second squared. Your acceleration and velocity are
 halted when a large hedge on the Red Hat campus grounds rushes up to
 catch you.

 Spiny, poky leaves weed their way through your clothing and stab you in
 uncomfortable and sensitive places.

 You are carrying:

>out
 Peter climbs out of the hedge. Meanwhile, back upstairs...

 Kitchenette (as Valerie)
 The kitchenette is a bland little room with rose print wallpaper and
 the constant smell of coffee and orange rinds. You do your best to keep
 the place tidy, but of course that's impossible with the 300 pound
 gorillas, also known as "co-workers," who sling their hairy bulk
 through here every day, leaving an unsightly mess. Since it's still
 morning, you can stand to look at the place without getting out the
 sponge and cleaning up. A coffee maker burbles in the corner.

 Melvin rotates into your field of view one awkward angle at a time. He
 bangs his akimbo elbows on the sides of the doorframe, making a
 horrible clanking noise on the metal. It doesn't seem to faze him.

 "Hey there, beautiful," he says in a syrupy voice.

 1: Hi, Melvin.
 2: (sigh) Hi, Melvin.
 3: (groan) Goodbye, Melvin.

 You say, "(sigh) Hi, Melvin."

 "Hey, don't sound so negative," Melvin says. "I was just saying hello."
 He leans casually against the fridge, and it tilts, causing a clunk and

 busy for lunch?"

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: (groan) Goodbye, Melvin.
 2: Yeah, I've got big lunch plans. Sorry.
 3: If you don't clean up that fridge right now, it's going to cause a
 big problem for someone later. Namely, me.

 "So I'll seeya later?" Melvin calls out as you leave. Brrr. Serves you
 right for trying to sneak an extra break from work. You steal back to
 your desk, hoping no one besides Melvin saw you so obviously slacking.

 Valerie's Desk (as Valerie)
 Your desk looked spiffy when you left it last night. By the time you
 got here this morning, the minions of evil had sneaked in and dropped
 off a messy pile of work. You've ignored it so far, but it's not really
 going to go away on its own. On your computer, though, is email that
 needs to be read.

 You can see a messy pile of work here.

 By the way, your phone is ringing.

>answer phone
 You answer the phone. It's your coworker Debra, wondering if you got
 any of her emails, but telling you never mind, because she figured it
 out by herself. Then she hangs up. Sweet Lord, when will you deliver us
 from idiot coworkers?

 Just as you hang up, you hear your name being yelled and see someone
 running up toward you.

 That cute young temp who started here a few weeks ago, whatsisname --
 Peter? -- is red-faced and perspiring slightly. One of his shirtsleeves
 is twisted (you resist the urge to straighten it), and his collar is
 turned up. There are also a number of twigs and hedge leaves clinging
 to him.

 "I'm glad you're here!" Peter says brightly. "I really need to talk to
 somebody about what just happened to me!"

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: A 'hello' would be nice.
 2: What did you do, get up on the wrong side of the flower bed this
 morning?

 You say, "What did you do, get up on the wrong side of the flower bed
 this morning?"

 "Whuh?" Peter asks. Well, it isn't so much of a question as it is a
 grunt. You help pick off a couple of the more prominent leaves. "Well,
 the leaves, right," he says. "That's not what I came to talk about, but
 it's part of it. Indirectly, I mean. I fell in a hedge."

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: Why don't you go ahead and get to the point?
 2: You indirectly fell in a hedge?

>2

 You say, "You indirectly fell in a hedge?"

 "Well, I didn't plan on it when I went into the little secret door and
 ended up inside someone else's brain. Only when the second flash of
 light came did I fall into the hedge," Peter says. "But, here's the
 interesting part."

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: If that's the dull part, I'm guessing you left out the part about
 evil alien robots from dimension X who plan to take over the world from

 You say, "If that's the dull part, I'm guessing you left out the part

 You say, "Who the hell is Zarf?"

 "You never heard of Zarf?" Peter asks. Then he pauses, thinks a moment,
 and says, "Hmm, I guess you wouldn't have. Never mind. Here's an idea.
 How about we go to dinner tonight, and we can talk more then?"

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: Okay. dinner it is.
 2: Can't do it tonight.


 You say, "Okay. dinner it is."

 Peter says, "Excellent! But, first things first. Can you meet me after
 work up in the file room? I really want to show you something."

 Valerie says, "It's against my better judgment, but all right."

 Little do they suspect that Melvin, nearby, is spying on them and
 making plans of his own.Even littler do they suspect that Melvin is not

 File Room (as Valerie)
 The file room is one of your favorite rooms in the company building.
 One, it's always orderly and clean; and two, it doesn't sport brightly
 colored IKEA furniture. It's businesslike and efficient. There's even a
 window to give the area a sense of openness.

 Peter is standing here, pacing, when you arrive. "What took you? Didn't
 we say 6:30?" Peter asks.

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: Sorry I'm late.
 2: Okay, so show me this amazing file cabinet of yours.

 You say, "Sorry I'm late."

 "Sorry I'm late," you say to Peter. "I had to ditch Melvin. He kept
 hanging around the elevators. I finally faked him out and took the
 stairs. It's like he was trying to intercept me."

 "Melvin? Really?" Peter says, looking worried. "I was wondering who put
 the file cabinet back."

 You say, "Okay, so show me this amazing file cabinet of yours."

 "Okay, so show me this amazing file cabinet of yours," you tell Peter.
 "I'm starving."

 Peter says, "Here's what you do. Go to file cabinet Z-Y and try to open
 it."

>open z-y
 You try to open the cabinet, but it seems to be stuck shut.

 "It's stuck," you say.

 "Give it a good pull," says Peter.

>again
 You try to open the cabinet, but it seems to be stuck shut.

>pull z-y
 You yank on the drawer, and it flies clean out of the cabinet, sending
 you spilling backwards. Loose folders slide out in a snaky line
 sideways across the floor, emptying their contents in all directions.

 "Egad!" yells Peter. "That didn't happen last time!"

 "Well, it did this time," you tell Peter. "Help me clean up the
 papers."

>pull harder
 You can't see any such thing.

 You should probably clean up the scattered papers first.

>clean
 What do you want to clean?

>clean papers
 As you both lean down to clean up the papers, you see a pair of shoes
 enter the room from the darkened hallway. Perched in the shoes is a
 pair of stilts. Balanced on the stilts is a kind of potato head with
 Melvin's face on it. In other words, Melvin is standing here.

 "Do you two want to tell me what you're doing here?" Melvin asks.

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: No.
 2: Practicing the Lambada.
 3: Smooching.
 4: It's none of your business, Melvin.

 You say, "Practicing the Lambada."

 Melvin says, "Mmm. The Forbidden Dance. Appropriate, considering this
 is the second time today, Peter, that you've been playing around with
 private company property, against the rules."

 Peter says, "Geez, Melvin. What's gotten into you? Suddenly you've
 grown a pair."

 Melvin ignores Peter and kicks some of the papers with his toe. "Why
 don't you two put things back where you found them, and I won't have to
 report this?"

 she came on to me today in the snack room?"

 Peter looks at you. "Eww!"

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]
 1: Buzz off, creep.
 2: Say that again and I'll bust your fricking head open.

 You say, "Okay, Melvin. You just won yourself a sexual harrassment
 suit. I'll see you in court."

 Melvin isn't fazed. He kicks some of the papers with his toe. "I could
 report this as company espionage. That's what it looks like to me."

 Peter says, "Hey, be cool, Melvin. It was just an accident. I spilled a
 cabinet and Valerie offered to help me clean up."

 Melvin looks at you. "Just an innocent spill. This is the second time
 today that cabinet has 'innocently' spilled open."

 "So I'm clumsy," says Peter, shrugging.

 Melvin says, "Why don't you two put things back where you found them,
 and I won't have to report this?"

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]

 Melvin watches as you pick up the scattered folders and papers and
 shove them into the open cabinet. Peter puts the YZ cabinet back
 against the wall.

 "There, Melvin," Peter says.

 Melvin says, "Okay, now get out."

 Melvin seemed harmless enough at first, but lately he's been giving you
 the definite creeps. For one thing, he doesn't work anywhere near your
 station, yet you seem to meet him two or three times a day. You're
 starting to get the feeling that he's obsessing about you, and you're
 starting to lose your ability to be nice to him.

 Melvin watches as you exit the building. You leave him behind at the

 "Well, that was weird. I've never seen Melvin act like that," Peter
 says.

 "Really?" you ask. "He's always seemed a sort of a creep to me."

 "Is there any way we can sneak back in, do you think?"

 "Really?" asks Peter.

 "Yeah. Now I'm curious. If Melvin hadn't showed up like that, I
 wouldn't have believed you really found something. Now I want to see
 what it is." "Won't Melvin be watching?"

 "He can't sit there all night," you say. "He has to go home at some
 point, right?" "Should we go to dinner first?"

 "Nah. Let's just go for it. Come on. Melvin doesn't really have any
 authority over me, anyway."

 Peter says, "Excellent."

 File Room
 The file room is one of your favorite rooms in the company building.
 One, it's always orderly and clean; and two, it doesn't sport brightly
 colored IKEA furniture. It's businesslike and efficient. There's even a
 window to give the area a sense of openness. Early moonlight peeks in,
 drawing a long amber trapezoid on the carpet.

 Peter is here.

 Peter says, "Okay, I don't see him. Let's be careful this time." He

 magical appearance.

>enter door
 You pass through the portal into a dark tunnel, which sighs with
 melodic longing as you enter.

 Weird Tunnel
 You are on your hands and knees in a claustrophobic tunnel. It leads
 down, as nearly as you can tell, but your equilibrium is distorted in
 here. The curving walls gleam with the semblance of wet rock, but the
 palms of your hands tell a different story. It feels like organic
 tissue, a thick layer of hide, with the elastic strength of muscle.
 Like sharkskin, it is silken and slick in one direction but resists any
 backwards movement with a roughened grain.

 You begin to crawl forward, the tunnel floor oozing and pliable under
 your knees and palms. The secret door bangs shut and disappears. The
 tunnel begins to shiver, and from up ahead a roar like a waterfall
 issues from the darkness. Your hands suddenly lose traction as gravity
 begins its quickening pull. You begin to slide down... down... down...

 In Zarf's Kitchen (in Zarf's head)
 Weird! You really are inside someone's head!You see the opening of this
 guy Zarf's eyes, giving you a sort of bifocal window into the
 surrounding environment. Out through his eyes you can see that he's in
 the middle of making dinner. On the stove, a pan of onions has been
 saut?ed golden brown in olive oil. On the countertop you see a bottle
 of white wine, two measuring cups, a small bowl, and a plate of ribbed
 pasta.

 Inside of Zarf's head, you see weird flashes of light. A number of
 eerie sounds float around. You presume these effects are caused by the
 random firing of synapses in a very active mind.

 Each time there is a flash, you notice a shadow nearby that never seems
 to brighten.

 Zarf stirs a cup of white wine into the pan of onions and lets it
 simmer.

>examine shadow
 The shadow falls in a diagonal slant, and a sensation comes from it,
 but you are unable to tell whether it is warmth or cold.

 Zarf measures out roughly a cup of really squishy blue cheese.

>examine wine
 The bottle of white wine is missing a cup, which was added to the pan
 of onions.

 Zarf stirs the simmering onions.

 Zarf picks up the pasta dish and carries it into another room.

 The shadow suddenly darkens and enlarges, swallowing you. You are
 transported deeper within Zarf's brain.

 Inside Zarf's Brain
 The noise is really loud here, and there is more to see. A visual
 juxtaposition mars your sense of place. The walls are angular but
 smooth, are a warm red, living rock, are cold dead clay and calcite.
 Cave tunnels lead in all directions, but without a compass or a way to
 mark your trail, you sense that you could easily get lost.

 You can see a control panel here.

>examine synapses
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine control panel
 The control panel has the appearance of a music stand, rising from a
 single stalk to about the height of your rib cage. The flat surface has
 but one button and a rectangular plate about four inches by six inches.

>examine plate
 The rectangular plate is made of some sort of smooth, colorless
 ceramic.

>examine button
 The button is a touch-sensitive disk with a one-inch radius. It has one
 simple marking: a vertical line, drawn in white.

 Out of the corner of your eye, you notice a curious gentleman casually
 leaning against one of the walls here.

>gentleman
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine gentleman
 The thief is a slippery character with beady eyes that flit back and
 forth. He carries, along with an unmistakable arrogance, a large bag
 over his shoulder and a vicious stiletto, whose blade is aimed
 menacingly in your direction. I'd watch out if I were you.
>examine gentleman

 He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that the bag will be
 taken only over his dead body.

 The thief makes a sudden, swift movement in your direction. You catch a
 glimpse of his stiletto moving, and then --

 Suddenly, you are falling, but all you see are slashes of yellow light

 center, moves towards you quickly. As it nears, you feel a sense of
 time slowing, and your eyes catch the details. It is a large hedge, and
 the dimple is a crushed spot roughly the size of Peter's body. You hope
 he flattened most of the sharpest branches when he landed...

 Valerie is a knockout brunette with almond shaped eyes, a flashing

 You help Valerie out of the hedge. "Wow!" she says. "That was really

 "Zarf. Andrew Plotkin. He works here."

 "Oh. Oh! Yeah. I know that guy. I meant the *other* guy."

 "What other guy?"

 "The one back in the brain."

 "Wait, you went farther back in the brain? How'd you do that?"

 "Didn't you see the shadow?"

 "Um. No."

 "You ought to go and try it, then."

 "Yeah! No. Yeah. No."

 She picked a nice place, you have to admit. Reasonable prices,

 strung liberally about the restaurant, providing a cozy, if slightly

 "So, what do you do?" Valerie asks.

 "I write text adventure games."

 "Check, please."

 "No, really. It's this new medium called Interactive Fiction. It's
 really cool. That guy Zarf? He's the master, man. You should play some
 of his stuff."

 "What's so great about interactive fiction?"

 "It's kind of hard to explain to someone who's never heard of it
 before. Me, I like writing it. Playing it is kind of dumb. It's always
 too hard. It was originally based on puzzles."

 "Puzzles? Like what? Jump the pegs to leave only one left?"

 Peter sputters. "Eeeagh! No! Well, yes. But that's a terrible example.
 I mean like: find the gold key, to open the door. Find the magic sword
 to kill the ogre."

 "Hmm. How about, find the object to activate the control panel?"

 "Could be, yeah."

 "What about a sneaky thief guy? How would you get past him?"

 "!!"

 "I've never seen anyone pronounce an exclamation point before. How'd
 you do that?"

 "That's the thief from Zork! He must be some sort of symbolic internal
 defense mechanism. Or something. You didn't see an elvish sword of
 great antiquity in there, maybe glowing blue?"

 "No."

 "I'm still thinking about that panel," Peter says. "Maybe if we
 activated that, we could control Zarf."

 "Is that a responsible thing to do?" Valerie asks.

 "No, but it sounds kind of fun, doesn't it?"

 "Sure, I guess," she says. "What do you think we'd need to prove to
 Zarf's internal control unit that we were Zarf?"

 "A picture of him, maybe?"

 "Do you have one?"

 "No. Yes! In the file cabinet! There was a photo of him in the file!"

 Zarf's Apartment (in Zarf's head) (as Peter)
 Zarf seems at first to be in a library, but on second glance, he's just
 at home but owns a *lot* of books. A couple thousand of them, by the
 looks of it. He is holding a bar code scanner and is scanning the ISBN
 numbers of books from a tall stack, one at a time, into his computer.

 Inside of Zarf's head, you see weird flashes of light. A number of
 eerie sounds float around. You presume these effects are caused by the
 random firing of synapses in a very active mind. A deep shadow here
 slashes diagonally, refusing the light.

 "Okay, I'll stay here," says Valerie. "Try to get that panel activated.

 this last dark turn of the cave tunnel you have met with an unexpected,
 dead end.

 Dead End
 It is the classic dead end. More than that, it is the archetypal dead
 end. Nowhere forward, nowhere back. The ceiling shocks with its height,
 the walls oppress with their closeness. There are no exits.

 File Room
 The file room is an unimpressive rectangular room full of squat
 cabinets. The file cabinets are a pale yellow, like raw milk, and each
 stands about 38 inches high. There is a maladjusted ceiling tile, and
 scruffy stains on the padded carpeting. In the north wall is a window,
 about two and a half feet square, with a crank latch. A copier machine
 sits near the wall, bearing no make or marking that you recognize, even
 though no company produces generic photocopiers that you know of. Even
 more curiously, the wall socket behind it is empty, meaning that the
 copier is not plugged in, and yet it definitely seems to be turned on.

 Peter pulls the second cabinet from the end away from the wall,
 revealing a portal fashioned from slats of aged cedar. Ornate brass
 hinges, possibly hand-crafted, clamp the door securely to the wall.
 Beyond being bizarre, it is curiously anachronistic. The portal itself
 antedates this building by at least a century and a half, in your

 "This is it," says Peter. "I don't know what would happen if you went
 through it, though."

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine door
 A portal fashioned from slats of aged cedar, the strange secret door is
 only about three feet high, and painted a shade of crimson. Gold flecks
 in the paint give it a gaudy, child's-idea-of-magical appearance.
 Ornate brass hinges, possibly hand-crafted, clamp the door securely to
 the wall. Beyond being bizarre, it is curiously anachronistic. The
 portal itself antedates this building by at least a century and a half,
 in your estimation.

 The copier machine sits near the wall, bearing no make or marking that

 yet it definitely seems to be turned on.

>enter portal
 A voice shouts, "STOP!" It is an odd voice, a peculiar sounding shout.
 It sounds less like a voice yelling and more like a normal voice
 mechanically amplified.

 "Melvin!" shouts Peter.

 This "Melvin" bears no resemblance to any human being, living or dead.
 The ersatz flesh on his disjointed skeleton is a remarkable elastic,
 tinted with some care to mimic caucasian melanin. Under the fluorescent
 light, it reflects slightly too much green, and it wrinkles unnaturally
 at limb joints. More care has been taken in the face, allowing for a
 range of facial expressions. Currently, the expression is one of
 intended menace.

 "You leave me no choice but to terminate you," says Melvin. He goes to
 the copier and punches a sequence of numbers on the button panel. A
 strange shuddering vibration pulses through the room, from back to
 front.

 "The file cabinets!" yells Peter. "They're moving!"

 The file cabinets are growing taller. Beneath each, a small footpad is
 extending, and the cabinet bodies are rising on stalks. A single
 cycloptic ruby eye irises open on the face of each.

 Peter rolls his eyes. "Well what the heck. It *is* a stupid robot
 army!"

 "Go in, quick!" Valerie orders you.

 "Go! We'll hold him off!" Peter shouts, bravely. "I think."

>enter door

 You pass through the portal into a dark tunnel, which sighs with
 melodic longing as you enter.

 Weird Tunnel
 You are on your hands and knees in a claustrophobic tunnel. It leads
 down, as nearly as you can tell, but your equilibrium is distorted in
 here. The curving walls gleam with the semblance of wet rock, but the
 palms of your hands tell a different story. It feels like organic
 tissue, a thick layer of hide, with the elastic strength of muscle.
 Like sharkskin, it is silken and slick in one direction but resists any
 backwards movement with a roughened grain.

>go down
 You begin to crawl forward, the tunnel floor oozing and pliable under
 your knees and palms. The tunnel begins to shiver, and from up ahead a
 roar like a waterfall issues from the darkness. Your hands suddenly
 lose traction as gravity begins its quickening pull. You begin to slide
 down... down... down...

 File Room (as Peter)
 The situation has gone from bad to worse, here. The army of mutant
 little file cabinet robots has herded you and Valerie back against the
 north wall. The window is behind you. Melvin is across the room,
 working controls on the copier, which has opened up to reveal some sort
 of pulsating machine innards.

 A secret door has been revealed in the wall.

 Valerie says, "What do we do?"

 What would you like to say? [0 to cancel]

 You say, "We do like Captain Kirk, and incapacitate Melvin with logic."

 Not that they're my plans, of course. The Great Brain of Dimension X

 nervous since things started to get really weird. "Who am I to question
 his perfect logic? I am created in his perfect image. We serve logic.
 We serve the Great Brain."

 Melvin begins to quiver and shake. "Illogical... illogical..." Smoke
 starts coming of his ears. "Must -- must -- serve -- groink! Blatt!" He
 makes a few sputtering noises and collapses.

 Valerie says, "There's no way that should have worked."

 Suddenly, Melvin springs back to his feet, shoots you an evil grin, and
 laughs like an insane android might at a time like this.

 "Idiot," Melvin says. "There's no such thing as the Great Brain. I'm
 just here to kill you because I'm an evil android bastard who loves to
 kill. And it'll be a special pleasure killing someone so dweebishly
 gullible."

 Valerie gives you a kiss. "For good luck," she says as the heroic music
 swells.

 The conversation kind of trails off at that point.

>kiss valerie
 Keep your mind on the game.

>take cabinet
 You pick up the nearest file cabinet, which turns out to be the Z-Y
 cabinet. The stupid robot starts making a pathetic squealing noise.

 "Hey! Put him down this instant!" shrieks Melvin.

>throw cabinet at melvin
 (the army of mutant little file cabinet robots at Melvin)

 What heroic catch phrase would you like to utter?
    [1]Here's mud in your eye, sucker!   [2]It's clobberin' time!
 [3]Hasta la vista, bubbala!   [4]You remember when I said I'd kill you
 last? I lied!
>2
 "It's clobberin' time!" you shout.

 "Who do you think this mutant army is, the Yancy Street Gang?" Valerie
 says.

 "Don't ruin my moment. Just get moving!"

 Valerie makes a gymnastic diving roll over the sinister little cabinets
 and disappears into the portal. You fling the little metallic beast at
 Melvin, but your aim is terrible. Fortunately, you lobbed it so far to
 the side that it goes smashing into the pulsating copier machine brain
 heart organ thingy, which implodes and then explodes, emitting a
 terrific shower of sparks and a sad little dying scream.

 As you might expect, Melvin shouts, "Noooooooooooo!" as the little army
 of stupid robots topples over en masse, vomiting their paper folder
 guts all over the place.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

 You have so far scored 9 out of a possible 12, in 181 turns.

>examine melvin
 Melvin Prufrock is a thin, translucent looking individual, with tics
 and other twitchy mannerisms passing for a personality. He is insanely
 tall, approaching six foot eight, but probably only weighs 130 pounds
 with clothes on. You don't even want to consider what he's like without
 clothes on. He also looks like he's about six years younger than you
 are, so about nineteen, and yet he's several rankings above you on the
 ladder.

 Melvin withdraws some sort of bulbous metal ray gun from one of the
 dead cabinets. "You should have escaped when you had the chance,
 Peter!" he says as he pulls the trigger. For a moment, you feel
 absolutely nothing, and then you realize with some shock that this is
 because your nervous system has been completely vaporized, and the rest
 of you along with it.

 Inside Zarf's Brain (as Peter)
 The noise is really loud here, and there is more to see. A visual
 juxtaposition mars your sense of place. The walls are angular but
 smooth, are a warm red, living rock, are cold dead clay and calcite.
 Cave tunnels lead in all directions, but without a compass or a way to
 mark your trail, you sense that you could easily get lost.

 You can see a control panel, Valerie and Zarf here.

 "You made it!" says Valerie.

 "Yeah," you say, "But Melvin's right on my tail."

 Zarf seems calm and sagelike. "It's okay. I know my way around, and I
 have a plan. Mind you, the timing is apt to be rather ... cruel... from
 now on."

 You touch the button. It pulses once, and then a bright blue glow
 sweeps across the ceramic plate.The disk's color changes to red, and
 the marking becomes a black X. Moments later, it reverts to its
 original appearance.

 There is a sound like a vacuum implosion, and a flash of light. Melvin
 tumbles into view, holding some sort of ray gun.

 "He's got a gun!" shouts Valerie.

 Zarf says, "Follow me, please."

 Zarf leaves to the northwest.

>go northwest
 Melvin fires the ray gun, which emits a sizzling noise and a bright
 stripe of electric blue laser light. "EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!" he
 screams. The two of you narrowly dodge the beam and follow Zarf down
 the tunnel.

 Tunnels (as Peter and Valerie)
 A huge cavern rises above you. The far reaches are lost in shadow mist,
 and the vaults above fade into a darkness pierced with long columns of
 stone. Chill water drips and pools in broken declivities. You can hear
 little else. A river of smoke-grey travertine flows down one wall of
 the chamber. Pale fungi gleam in phosphorescence somewhere above.
 Gloomy side chambers stretch off in many directions.

 You can see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "We're going to need a few things. Try to keep up."

 Zarf walks down through the floor. Vivid gold light flares around him.

>go down
 You follow Zarf through the floor, which melts open around you. You
 hear Melvin close behind you.

 Canyon Wall (as Peter and Valerie)
 Massive buttresses of stone rise all around you, climbing the canyon
 wall, flowing down again in cascades of pale fluorite. A path seems to
 climb up among them; but you don't think you can get to it right now.

 The carcass of the Wumpus is heaped before you. Hardened blood trickles
 from its ravaged hide, puddling on the floor.

 There is a crossbow lying here; near the beast; loaded and cocked.

 Zarf says, "Take the crossbow."

>take crossbow
 Peter takes the crossbow.

 Valerie says, "Poor thing."

 Zarf walks through the east wall. Rich crimson light flares around him.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Melvin enters from the path above, shouting, "I smell a Wumpus! HA HA
 HA HA HA!"

>go east
 You follow Zarf through east wall, which melts open around you. You
 hear Melvin close behind you.

 Small Cave (as Peter and Valerie)
 You are in a dark pocket, a stony crack below the summit of the hill.
 It is not quite high enough to stand in, but surprisingly long,
 narrowing only slowly towards the back. The entrance is a circle of
 blinding crimson to the west, partially obscured by the boulder.

 An ancient and filthy blanket is crumpled against one wall of the cave.

 You can also see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "Take the blanket."

>get blanket
 Valerie takes the blanket.

 Zarf walks through the south wall. Shimmering grey light flares around
 him.

 Melvin squeezes through the cave opening. "It's a good thing I
 remembered to change my batteries!" he puffs.

>go north
 If you don't follow Zarf, you will surely be killed.

 Melvin fires the ray gun, which emits a sizzling noise and fills the
 tiny cave with electric blue laser light. "EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!"
 he screams. In the tiny confines of the cave, the deadly beams bounce
 more than Melvin expects, and he is caught in the backfire. "Oh, hell,"
 he says, as all three of you shred into atoms.

 Storage Tent (as Peter and Valerie)
 This is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to
 have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of
 Da-Glo paint on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and
 water chests.
 Lying on the ground is a brass torch of the "self-igniting" type. The
 ignite button is on the handle.
 There is a shovel lying here.

 You can also see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "Take the shovel."

>take shovel
 Peter takes the shovel.

 Zarf says, "Okay, we need to take a slight detour."

 Zarf walks up through the ceiling. Pale green light flares around him.

 Outside the tent, Melvin hollers, "Little pigs, little pigs, let me
 in!"

>go up
 You follow Zarf through the ceiling. You feel the heat of Melvin's ray
 gun blast nearly singe your feet.

 Tunnels (as Peter and Valerie)
 A huge cavern rises above you. The far reaches are lost in shadow mist,
 and the vaults above fade into a darkness pierced with long columns of
 stone. Chill water drips and pools in broken declivities. You can hear
 little else. A river of smoke-grey travertine flows down one wall of
 the chamber. Pale fungi gleam in phosphorescence somewhere above.
 Gloomy side chambers stretch off in many directions.

 Zarf says, "Fortunately, these tunnels lead everywhere. Come along."

 Zarf walks through the south wall. Rosy pink light flares around him.

>go south
 You follow Zarf through the south wall. Melvin is one step behind you.

 In Roc Nest (as Peter and Valerie)
 This nest is made from skillfully woven tree trunks, small bushes, and
 large amounts of mud and roc guano for glue. Giant black feathers are
 everywhere. In the center of the nest is an egg the size of a small
 wagon. Nestled beneath the egg is a featureless white cube.
 The roc perches on the side of the nest, watching you intently.
 There is a stained scroll here.

 You can also see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "Take the scroll."

>get cube
 The roc, convinced you are threatening its precious egg, drives you
 away before you can snatch the cube.

 Melvin materializes through the rock face. "Where the hell are we?" he
 says, staring around.

>get scroll
 Valerie takes the stained scroll.

 Zarf walks through the west wall of the nest. Blinding white light
 flares around him.

 Melvin fires the ray gun, which emits a sizzling noise and a bright
 stripe of electric blue laser light. "EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!" he
 screams. He manages to take out not just you and Valerie, but the roc,
 the egg, the cube, and the nest as well. Your glittering ashes take
 several slow minutes to settle far below.

 Control Room (as Peter and Valerie)
 This is the control room for all the machinery nearby. The controls are
 all magical, of course. The walls are covered by blinking lights and
 shifting displays, interspersed with arcane dials and glowing buttons.
 It's all very mysterious looking. The exit, to the northwest, leads
 into a room with machinery which would surely crush you if you were to
 attempt to enter it.
 A scroll of old, brittle parchment is here.
 "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside.

 Zarf says, "Take the scroll."

>get scroll
 (the brittle scroll)
 Peter takes the brittle scroll.

 Zarf says, "I need to take my own detour. You two, take the northwest
 exit, wait for Melvin, and incapacitate him. Lay a trap if need be.
 I'll rejoin you after."

 "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside.

 "Are you sure we can get through that?" Peter asks.

 Zarf touches a shadow and vanishes.

 "Oh. Great."

 "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside.

 Melvin bursts in from the east wall, covered with talon scratches and
 roc feathers. "Note to self: Don't mess with the roc egg," he says.

>take scroll
 Which do you mean, the brittle scroll or the stained scroll?

>go northwest
 You can't see any such thing.

>go northwest
 You make it across the room, but just barely; just as you duck through
 the door, a huge hammer crashes down behind, missing by an inch.
 Something you stepped on along the way clicked as well, and with a
 horrible screeching noise, the machinery speeds up, crashing faster and
 faster until it's twice as fast as before.

 From behind, you hear Melvin cry, "Hey! No fair!" That machinery ought
 to slow him down for at least a minute or two.

 Dead End (as Peter and Valerie)
 It is the classic dead end. More than that, it is the archetypal dead
 end. Nowhere forward, nowhere back. The ceiling shocks with its height,
 the walls oppress with their closeness. There are no exits.

 Melvin will be here at any moment.

 "Do we know what to do?" Valerie asks Peter.

 "I hope so, or we're dead." Peter says.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a brittle scroll
   a stained scroll
   a shovel
   a blanket
   a crossbow

>brittle
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine brittle
 The scroll reads "kulcad spell: dispel a magic spell". The spell seems
 very long and extremely complicated.

 You hear the distant crash of a giant hammer, followed by a small
 shriek from Melvin. It sounded more disappointed than fatal.

>examine stained
 The scroll reads "caskly spell: cause perfection."

>SAVE
>cf4

>shovel
 Peter attacks the soft ground with the shovel. It seems to magically
 bite large chunks at a time, like a ravenous rodent burrowing into
 angel food cake. The scooped material seems to vanish like evaporating
 bubbles, leaving only a deep pit behind.

 Unfortunately, Peter himself ends up at the bottom of it.

 There is a terrific crash and then a fast series of metallic whupping
 noises. Melvin comes limping in through the southeast wall, looking the
 worse for wear. Several spears are skewered in his sides, and one leg
 drags limply behind him.

 "My ray gun got smashed by the hammer," he mopes.He looks down in the
 pit and laughs. "What are you doing down there, digging a latrine?
 Don't worry about that. Time to die."

 With a steely 'snikt', long metal blades protrude out of his knuckles.

 the chamber. Pale fungi gleam in phosphorescence somewhere above.
 Gloomy side chambers stretch off in many directions.

 You can see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "We're going to need a few things. Try to keep up."

 Zarf walks down through the floor. Vivid gold light flares around him.

>go down
 You follow Zarf through the floor, which melts open around you. You
 hear Melvin close behind you.

 Canyon Wall (as Peter and Valerie)
 Massive buttresses of stone rise all around you, climbing the canyon
 wall, flowing down again in cascades of pale fluorite. A path seems to
 climb up among them; but you don't think you can get to it right now.

 The carcass of the Wumpus is heaped before you. Hardened blood trickles
 from its ravaged hide, puddling on the floor.

 There is a crossbow lying here; near the beast; loaded and cocked.

 Zarf says, "Take the crossbow."

>Take the crossbow
 Peter takes the crossbow.

 Valerie says, "Poor thing."

 Zarf walks through the east wall. Rich crimson light flares around him.

>go east
 You follow Zarf through east wall, which melts open around you. You
 hear Melvin close behind you.

 Small Cave (as Peter and Valerie)
 You are in a dark pocket, a stony crack below the summit of the hill.
 It is not quite high enough to stand in, but surprisingly long,
 narrowing only slowly towards the back. The entrance is a circle of
 blinding crimson to the west, partially obscured by the boulder.

 An ancient and filthy blanket is crumpled against one wall of the cave.

 You can also see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "Take the blanket."

>Take the blanket
 Valerie takes the blanket.

 Zarf walks through the south wall. Shimmering grey light flares around
 him.

 Melvin squeezes through the cave opening. "It's a good thing I
 remembered to change my batteries!" he puffs.

>go south
 You follow Zarf through the south wall. Melvin is one step behind you.

 Storage Tent (as Peter and Valerie)
 This is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to
 have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of
 Da-Glo paint on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and
 water chests.
 Lying on the ground is a brass torch of the "self-igniting" type. The
 ignite button is on the handle.
 There is a shovel lying here.

 You can also see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "Take the shovel."

>Take the shovel.
 Peter takes the shovel.

 Zarf says, "Okay, we need to take a slight detour."

 Zarf walks up through the ceiling. Pale green light flares around him.

 Outside the tent, Melvin hollers, "Little pigs, little pigs, let me
 in!"

>go up
 You follow Zarf through the ceiling. You feel the heat of Melvin's ray
 gun blast nearly singe your feet.

 Tunnels (as Peter and Valerie)
 A huge cavern rises above you. The far reaches are lost in shadow mist,
 and the vaults above fade into a darkness pierced with long columns of
 stone. Chill water drips and pools in broken declivities. You can hear
 little else. A river of smoke-grey travertine flows down one wall of
 the chamber. Pale fungi gleam in phosphorescence somewhere above.
 Gloomy side chambers stretch off in many directions.

 You can see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "Fortunately, these tunnels lead everywhere. Come along."

 Zarf walks through the south wall. Rosy pink light flares around him.

>go south
 You follow Zarf through the south wall. Melvin is one step behind you.

 In Roc Nest (as Peter and Valerie)
 This nest is made from skillfully woven tree trunks, small bushes, and
 large amounts of mud and roc guano for glue. Giant black feathers are
 everywhere. In the center of the nest is an egg the size of a small
 wagon. Nestled beneath the egg is a featureless white cube.
 The roc perches on the side of the nest, watching you intently.
 There is a stained scroll here.

 You can also see Zarf here.

 Zarf says, "Take the scroll."

>Take the scroll.
 Valerie takes the stained scroll.

 Zarf walks through the west wall of the nest. Blinding white light
 flares around him.

 Melvin materializes through the rock face. "Where the hell are we?" he
 says, staring around.

>go west
 You follow Zarf through the west wall. You hear Melvin yelling, "Bad
 bird! Bad!"

 Control Room (as Peter and Valerie)
 This is the control room for all the machinery nearby. The controls are
 all magical, of course. The walls are covered by blinking lights and
 shifting displays, interspersed with arcane dials and glowing buttons.
 It's all very mysterious looking. The exit, to the northwest, leads
 into a room with machinery which would surely crush you if you were to
 attempt to enter it.
 A scroll of old, brittle parchment is here.
 "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside.

 Zarf says, "Take the scroll."

>Take the parchment.
 Peter takes the brittle scroll.

 Zarf says, "I need to take my own detour. You two, take the northwest
 exit, wait for Melvin, and incapacitate him. Lay a trap if need be.
 I'll rejoin you after."

 "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside.

 "Are you sure we can get through that?" Peter asks.

 Zarf touches a shadow and vanishes.

 "Oh. Great."

 "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside.

 Melvin bursts in from the east wall, covered with talon scratches and
 roc feathers. "Note to self: Don't mess with the roc egg," he says.

>go northwest
 You make it across the room, but just barely; just as you duck through
 the door, a huge hammer crashes down behind, missing by an inch.
 Something you stepped on along the way clicked as well, and with a
 horrible screeching noise, the machinery speeds up, crashing faster and
 faster until it's twice as fast as before.

 From behind, you hear Melvin cry, "Hey! No fair!" That machinery ought
 to slow him down for at least a minute or two.

 Dead End (as Peter and Valerie)
 It is the classic dead end. More than that, it is the archetypal dead
 end. Nowhere forward, nowhere back. The ceiling shocks with its height,
 the walls oppress with their closeness. There are no exits.

 Melvin will be here at any moment.

 "Do we know what to do?" Valerie asks Peter.

 "I hope so, or we're dead." Peter says.

>SAVE
>cf5
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>dig with shovel
 You can't see any such thing.

>undo
 Dead End
 [Previous turn undone.]

>dig shovel
 Peter attacks the soft ground with the shovel. It seems to magically
 bite large chunks at a time, like a ravenous rodent burrowing into
 angel food cake. The scooped material seems to vanish like evaporating
 bubbles, leaving only a deep pit behind.

 Unfortunately, Peter himself ends up at the bottom of it.

>peter, out
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>out
 There are no exits.

 You hear the distant crash of a giant hammer, followed by a small
 shriek from Melvin. It sounded more disappointed than fatal.

>go up
 You can't go that way.

>undo
 Dead End

>put blanket on hole
 Putting things on the deep pit would achieve nothing.

 You hear the distant crash of a giant hammer, followed by a small
 shriek from Melvin. It sounded more disappointed than fatal.

>cover pit with blanket
 Valerie throws the blanket across the opening of the pit, covering it
 completely.

>caskly blanket
 The casting feels wrong, and you are momentarily blinded.

 There is a terrific crash and then a fast series of metallic whupping
 noises. Melvin comes limping in through the southeast wall, looking the
 worse for wear. Several spears are skewered in his sides, and one leg
 drags limply behind him.

 "My ray gun got smashed by the hammer," he mopes."Hey, where's your
 boyfriend? You two get separated? Don't worry, you guys will have a
 touching reunion in Hell."

 With a steely 'snikt', long metal blades protrude out of his knuckles.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a stained scroll

 Melvin takes a limping step forward and, like the idiot he always was,
 falls for the trap and topples into the pit, just barely missing Peter.

 In the Pit (as Peter)
 You are down in the bottom of the pit. Crudely carved, spongy walls
 lead up to a narrow opening.

 You can see a blanket here.

 Melvin looks like he's gotten the wind knocked out of him, if that's
 possible. Probably getting past the crashing machinery trap took more
 out of him than you guessed. He stands up woozily.

>undo

>gnusto caskly

>shoot melvin with crossbow
 You shoot the crossbow at Melvin, who is too disoriented to deflect the
 bolt. It plunges straight into his gizzard. "EEEAGH!!" he cries his
 last, before exploding into a million shiny pieces. Melvin is no more.

 "That was funky," Valerie says from above.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>gnusto scroll
 You don't have a spell book.

 "Come on up," Valerie calls down to you.

>go up
 Peter climbs out of the pit and rejoins Valerie.

 Dead End (as Peter and Valerie)
 It is the classic dead end. More than that, it is the archetypal dead
 end. Nowhere forward, nowhere back. The ceiling shocks with its height,
 the walls oppress with their closeness. There are no exits.

 A deep pit has been dug here by Peter.

 Zarf appears in a cloud of orange smoke, wearing a long blue cloak with
 electroluminescent highlights. He surveys the scene calmly. "Okay," he
 says, retrieving the blanket and the crossbow.

 What would you like to say?
 [1]How do we get out of here?
>1
 "Like this," he says, and withdraws a small white cube and a spell book
 from his cloak.

 Zarf begins to intone the blorple spell--




  -- glaring light...

 [Hit any key.]

 File Room (as Peter and Valerie)
 The room is a disaster area. Ruined cabinets lie everywhere, the
 remains of a once mighty (but very silly) army. The exploded pulsating
 copier machine innards are leaking trails of acrid ochre smoke into the
 air. Scorched company documents, flung willy nilly in the battle,
 carpet the floor, hiding only the smallest of the many scuffs and
 scratches.

 The secret door lies exposed in the wall.

 You can also see Zarf here.

 "Now," says Zarf. "Your turn again."

>turn. again.
 You can't see any such thing.

>caskly
 Zarf says, "Try the other one first."

>gnusto
 What do you want to gnusto?

>gnusto caskly
 You don't have a spell book.

>caskly cabinets
 Zarf says, "Try the other one first."

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a brittle scroll
   a stained scroll

>examine brittle
 The scroll reads "kulcad spell: dispel a magic spell". The spell seems
 very long and extremely complicated.

>examine stained
 The scroll reads "caskly spell: cause perfection."

>kulcad door
 Peter intones the Kulcad scroll. It is long and complicated, and he
 stumbles over the unfamiliar language. However, the magic is too
 powerful to be constrained. The more he reads, the clearer his
 pronunciation becomes, as the magic works through him. As he finishes
 the incantation, there is a noise like the rushing of open wind through
 a great tunnel. The secret door ripples and shimmers, trapped in a
 state between reality and mirage. Then, so suddenly that it is missed
 in a blink, the door is gone, leaving only a blank wall. There is no
 trace that it had ever been here.

 Zarf nods. "Now the other," he says.

>caskly
 Valerie intones the caskly spell. The room begins to melt; plaster,
 plastic, metal, and glass drip down like wax; loose papers lift and
 twirl in swelling eddies, spinning upwards from all directions.

 Then, familiar forms start reasserting themselves. Torn pages mend
 themselves out of the whirlwind, flowing back into place. Cabinet after
 cabinet slots itself into position, drawers agape, eating documents
 that file themselves. All is changed. The copier machine refuses its
 alien origins and becomes happily mudane, humming to life and churning
 out copies of a wonderfully boring document.

 "What just happened?" Valerie asks.

 "Take a look," says Zarf.

>examine machine
 The copier has a lid which covers a big pane of glass, and a panel with
 buttons. The big green button makes copies. That's all you've ever
 needed to push on it. In fact, your annoying supervisor, Melvin
 Prufrock, impressed upon you, at stammering length, how temperamental
 the machine is, and how expensive copier repair guys are. Bah.

>look

 File Room (as Peter)
 The file room looks considerably cleaner, perhaps better than before.
 The reassuring familiarity of its short, slumping ceiling seems now to
 brighten your morale. Short file cabinets, marked in reverse
 alphabetical order, stand in a clean line along the walls like a
 perfect set of teeth. A window affords a beautiful view and a kind
 square of sunlight.

 "Congratulations, that's the end of the story," says Zarf, pacing back
 and forth. "But, that's not *really* the way it happened, is it?"

 What would you like to say?
 [1]Yes.[2]No.
>1
 "Don't be absurd. You have an active imagination; that much is true.
 The rest of it -- a patchwork, a pastiche! Let me refresh your memory
 for you." You see a glint of something shiny in his hand.


  -- glaring light...

 [Hit any key.]








 At last, your troubled fortunes seemed to come to an end. It all
 happened very quickly: the callback from Red Hat, the bizarre interview
 with Human Resources, the handshake, the filling out of W-2 forms, and
 then your first day of work.

 And then the next day of work, and the next, and the next. Life goes
 on, routinely and normally, happily ever after.
