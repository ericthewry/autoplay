 So you just got fired from the best company ever, and it's the best
 day of your life. New opportunities! New horizons! New ways to look at
 things! Like calling this stupid kiss-off job fair a "convention."

 <span class="floydstyle header">Shuffling Around</span>
 A weird power to save a weird world by Ned Yompus
 Release 1 / Serial number 121107 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Busiest Subsite</span>
 This is the ritziest hotel you'll ever stay in. Terraces are west, a
 banner hangs over an auditorium entry to the east, and the elevator
 you came from is to the south. North's a function for later in the
 day.

 There's a sign over an odd side passage the bustling, babbling masses
 seem to be ignoring.

>read sign

 It says NONE TRY, and it's just above a side passage people are
 ignoring.

>examine side passage

 It's just under the NONE TRY sign. You could probably ENTER it, or go
 INSIDE. It's not really any direction you can tell, and you could have
 sworn it was near a different exit before you turned your back on it
 just a bit ago. It curves quickly so you can't see much of it.

>read banner

 "This way: BEING FIRED!" People walk by, discussing how the DEBRIEFING
 should make Mondays dynamos again.

>go east

 That way's an hour or two of listening to an under-action denunciator.
 You sure?
>enter
 You sure?

>no

 You pause before entering. The lecture seems like it'd be fun to
 ditch.

>go south

 You already spent too much time in the overlate elevator.

 Your eye catches the side passage, which looks more interesting than
 the standard ways out. Maybe you could give it another look.

>examine sigbn

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine sign

 It says NONE TRY, and it's just above a side passage people are
 ignoring.

>go north

 That way's a costlier cloister of rooms than recent firees deserve.
 The measure-a-resume event will be there, but not for another couple
 hours. You don't really want to get an agent, anyway.

 You feel sort of cornered by all the main passages. Sneaking off
 anywhere would be kind of fun.

>enter side passage

 Someone tugs you by the arm. "Can't you read? It says NO ENTRY! Quit
 dawdling and get to the DEBRIEFING already!"

 You check and make sure. No, still NONE TRY. As you walk away, you
 hear "INSTRUCTIONS, son. I trust I c..."
 (this is the first in-game pause. Whenever the game pauses without a
 cursor in the future, you need to push any key to continue.)
>about
 cursor in the future, you need to push any key to continue.)The voice
 cuts off. The passage behind is gone. You doubt missing the lecture
 will go in your life file.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A Dry Yard</span>
 Nothing particularly beautiful grows here. All manner of prickly
 things and dried-up weeds lie around. You see a big huge thorn
 blocking an exit. You're not sure what direction--you've gotten spun
 around--but the smaller thorns shooting off from it block any hope of
 slipping by. The carefully pruned shrub and the brush laid next to it
 seem much more orderly.

 A toga is lying here. It doesn't look particularly festive or clean.

 <span class="floydstyle em">So what was that lecture supposed to be about? One word changing</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">how we look at things, how things are? Rubbish. It has to be. You</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">think.</span>

>about

 This game is about, well, I don't want to spoil that yet until you get
 your first point, which I hope isn't too hard. It's a bit different
 from other text adventures, being a wordplay game, but the hope is
 that the right sort of command to solve certain puzzles is clued in
 more than one way.

 This is much simpler than it sounds, and I think/hope I've made
 efforts to make it less guess-the-verb.

 You can see tester credits with CREDITS. Also, I am very interested in
 transcripts to make this game better. If you've never made a
 transcript, type TRANSCRIPT and you can pick the file to save to. Then
 send the transcript to ned.yompus@gmail.com with my thanks.

>credits

 There is a list of websites I would like to credit. But it might spoil
 things before you score anything. So I'll just list beta-testers and
 general help.

 Adri, Anthony Hope, DJ Hastings, Gavin Myers-Leman, Hulk Handsome
 (<span class="floydstyle em">not spoiled til you score a point</span>,) Joey Jones, John
 Nitchals, Paul Lee, Robert Patten and Tomie Campf, in alphabetical
 first-name order. They found 700+ bugs.

 It must be noted that several bugs that popped up in the release
 version were due to me trying to slip in one more small thing without
 adequate re-testing. If there is anything obvious (and there was, in
 the initial release,) it is my fault and not theirs.

 Finally, type SITES for a list of sites that helped, which will
 totally spoil things right now.

>examine toga

 On it you see a four-legged animal with a sort of beard and horns. In
 one corner you see some writing. The toga also smells vaguely of
 barnyards.

>examine goat

 (In the future, you can just say what you need to summon. No verbs or
 frills.)

 The dingy toga shuddders. It seems to rip, make legs, and twist
 around, like one of those balloon animals you were never good at. All
 this twisting has left him with an appetite, and he walks over to the
 delicious thorns and brambles.

 They're not much, though, so he mauls the shrub a bit before making a
 dessert of the brush that you just now notice spelled GATO. Exhausted,
 he turns around three times and falls asleep.

 Wait. Did you just do that? Change a toga into a goat? You aren't sure
 if you were REALLY thinking about doing so, but you come to the
 realization you didn't rationalize back there, and you may have a
 latent talent.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>examine cat

 The goat ate enough of it, it doesn't look like anything any more.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A Dry Yard</span>
 Nothing particularly beautiful grows here. All manner of prickly
 things and dried-up weeds lie around. You see an exit in some
 direction or other where the thorn was. The shrub and brush the goat
 wrecked are here, too.

 The goat is half-sleeping here. He's probably best left that way.

>cat

 (examining instead)
 The goat ate enough of it, it doesn't look like anything any more.

>exit

 You feel a sudden sense of vertigo as you walk towards the passage
 where the thorn was. You realize you have lost your sense of
 direction, and for whatever reason, you're preoccupied with finding it
 before you can continue. So, which way is the thorn?

>go north

 With the big thorn gone, why, of course you can go north. Though the
 goat didn't clear out all the thorns. One rips your nametag slightly.
 But beyond that, there's a path that leads to an open field.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Notices Section</span>
 You're not sure what to do here, and there's no welcoming committee.
 But there's a broad board with various scrawlings.

 You see an incomplete-looking dollhouse with a crackling noise coming
 from a few loud holes. It is labeled FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

 It can't be... can it be...? A cabinet floating in mid-air. It looks
 acne-bit. It's open, too.

 A gateway is here. You can see through its sturdy wire fencing, but it
 doesn't seem to lead anywhere.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>inventory

 Item time! You are carrying:
   a dope tan notepad
   a magenta nametag (being worn)

>examine notepad

 It's your workbook. It holds bookwork. Not a thrilling color to most,
 and one of many you bought cheap a long time ago, and they haven't run
 out yet. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, and you have clipped a
 pen over it, too.

 (To use the notepad, you can type PAD (subject) or CONSULT PAD ABOUT
 (subject). If you forget what you've written about, you can type PAD
 or CONSULT PAD.)

>examine nametag

 It's still a bit scratched from your trip through the thorns--about
 3/7 of the way from the right.

>read nametag

 It's still a bit scratched from your trip through the thorns--about
 3/7 of the way from the right.

>who am i

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>man gate

 Which do you mean, the gateman, the dead beat deadbeat, the cheesy
 spearman or bearded man?

>gateman

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>look in cabinet

 (Nothing in this game has anything deeply hidden, so searching works
 like examining.)

 It's open. The cratered bits, once retraced, spell CAN BITE. You see a
 tinfoil info-lit, a tagged gadget, an idlers' slider and a salient
 saltine inside.

>bactine

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>consult pad

 Currently you can consult it about:
 --notepad, lecture
>take gadget

 You wonder what this gadget IS as you pick it up. It looks like it
 analyzes something. Perhaps you should try it on a few available
 things like the nametag?

>culture

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>analyze nametag

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>use gadget on nametag

 Use is a bit too vague for this game's parser to understand. You can
 SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH
 something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as
 well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.

>analyze nametag with gadget

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.


 It looks like a wall stud sensor, six inches by twelve, with a screen
 broken into nine mini-panels. An instructional tag you can read is
 tied to the handle, which narrows where it meets the main part. The
 gadget crackles with greeny energy.

>examine tag

 (the instructional tag)
 "This gadget is certified untransmogrifiable. It can be used to SCAN
 objects to determine their transmogrification states. Removing tag
 invalidates warranty. One beep means item is changeable. Buzz means it
 has been changed."

 The good stuff is about how one beep means something you should
 change, and a buzz means something that can't be changed again. Above
 MELON. A little thought and you realize only two reds on the gadget
 makes things trivial. The example seems loaded in the gadget's favor,
 but hey, that's advertising for you.

>scan nametag

 You see lights form on the screen--RGRGR*R--the sixth light starts
 red, then flashes to green and back, as if there are two aspects to
 the magenta nametag worth considering.

>examine gateway

 It's a fence gate, so you can see beyond and through it, though it
 seems too heavy to lift in any case, but who knows, maybe if there was
 a guy who tended to gates, he'd help you. It'd be neat if...

 (You can say the name of the gateway now to enter it. There's nothing
 more hidden in its description.)

>gateway

 (entering instead)
 It doesn't lead anywhere. Yet. Plus, you'd run into the, uh, gate
 part. Maybe if you had someone who could give information. And not
 stupid information like a silly old nametag.

>gateman

 If you really CAN change the nametag, you don't want a gateman in your
 face--so you chuck the nametag away. Not really believing...

 Whoah! The nametag pulses and pops in directions you didn't think
 something that flat could. You hear a gish, then a sigh. A tall,
 grouchy old man in sober robes so aged you almost say "Egad" cries
 "The eyes! They see!" He grumbles how he shoulda been a portal king in
 the parking lot, he's such a talking pro. Then he notices you.

 "Smug gums. But you'll have to do. Ehh? Heh. I'm Old Man Almond. What
 d'you want? I can tell you about this-here quest."

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>ask gateman about quest

 "Three major problems. Noise is one. A lupine lineup. Noble Ol' Ben:
 gone. Lorn. No longer."

 "And I think I know who's behind it: RED BULL BURDELL!"

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Notices Section</span>
 The broad board has some scrawlings you haven't read yet.

 Old Man Almond, the gateman, is grousing around here.

 You see an incomplete-looking dollhouse with a crackling noise coming
 from a few loud holes. It is labeled FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

 The acne-bit cabinet is still floating here. It contains the tinfoil
 info-lit, the idlers' slider and the salient saltine.

 A gateway is here. You can see through its sturdy wire fencing, but it
 doesn't seem to lead anywhere.

>take slider

 Ouch! The cabinet door slams on you--it seems to have developed fangs
 that came from a hidden compartment. Maybe you only get one device.
 (Note: you can SWAP the gadget and slider.)

>scan notepad

 The gadget makes no noise.

>swap gadget and slider

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>swap gadget

 You put the gadget back in the cabinet and take the slider.

>examine slider

 It's like an electronic t-square, with nine mini-panels. Reading it,
 you see it's useful to SCAN things to sort out their edges. It
 crackles with greeny energy and has some colored writing that looks
 important.

>examine writing

 "Provably 79.12% hintier than a tagged gadget. <span class="floydstyle i">Green print</span>
 gives you the start, <span class="floydstyle em">red print</span> the end. The middle bits fall

>examine dollhouse

 You hear static hissing through some loud holes. Plus, the dollhouse
 isn't nearly as tall as it could be. It could use an extra floor or
 two.

>scan dollhouse

 Before your slider gets close, you begin to pick something up. Perhaps
 it isn't the dollhouse you need to do something with. Something
 ambient--like the static. So you do that.

 Most of the screen goes blue, then a green dot and red dot bounce left
 and right across the slider screen, and they eventually wind up like
 so:
   RBGBBB

>attics

 The static cuts off and seems to grow opaque. Then it forms into a
 small box with a cupola, pyramid, and other shapes. They fit with a
 click on top of the dollhouse. Old Man Almond golf-claps. "Good work.
 Actually, the attics are a lot tougher to figure out than the gateway,
 especially with that tool you have."

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>examine dollhouse

 It's much nicer and quieter now that you tacked the attics on.

>consult pad

 Currently you can consult it about:
 --notepad, lecture, board
>consult pad about lecture

 An hour-long pre-lunch lecture by some fellow named Curt Lee netted
 you three pages of doodles. You remember him saying how ONE WORD could
 open a NEW DOOR in this age of technological innovation if you picked
 the right one, and that's more magic than real magic, if real magic
 existed, which it doesn't.

 Well, lunch was nice.


 "Three major problems. Noise is one. A lupine lineup. Noble Ol' Ben:
 gone. Lorn. No longer."

 "And I think I know who's behind it: RED BULL BURDELL!"

>wolf

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>wolf flow

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>swap saltine

 Not worth swapping.

>examine saltine

 It says SLAINTE on the package.

>examine info-lit

 It's tinfoil only in writing content--it's actually just paper. It's
 excessively all-caps and underlined, but I'll spare you that.

 Reason So Near from Sane Sean, Farce Facer and Saltier Realist:
 --If you can change stuff, why can't the people who made the gadget
 and slider? Or why couldn't they find someone off the street? Perhaps
 they're the real enemy and you're the pawn.
 --If they really wanted you to clean things up, why can't you take
 both the cabinet items?
 --That NEW DOOR is not really ONE WORD. Same as the guy who can lift
 it! They are two short words, easier than one big scary seven-letter
 word.
 --Anyone smart enough to untangle this world won't get any fulfillment
 from doing so. So there, stupider disputer!

 It'd all be distressingly persuasive gotcha-logic if you hadn't been
 able to flip that toga. But this is a fantasy world, and you've
 already shown cracks in his logic.

>look in cabinet

 It's open. The cratered bits, once retraced, spell CAN BITE. You see a
 tagged gadget, a tinfoil info-lit and a salient saltine inside.

>take saltine

 Got it. You'd have liked a beefier freebie, but with calm opining, you
 see no use complaining.

 Old Man Almond, the gateman, is grousing around here.

 You see that dollhouse you put those attics on. It is labeled FOR
 INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

 The acne-bit cabinet is still floating here. It contains the tagged
 gadget.

 A gateway is here. You can see through its sturdy wire fencing, but it
 doesn't seem to lead anywhere.

>enter gateway

 You hold your hand out in front of you to see if the gateway vanishes
 as you walk through. Nope. The gateman speaks.

 "It's not that easy. But it's not that hard. It doesn't get anywhere
 yet. Til it does, you can't go far away."

>examine fencing

 It's strong enough. You aren't getting through the gateway by force.

>scan saltine

 The slider makes no noise.

>raise gate

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>scan info-lit

 Nothing happens. Which just proves the paper's premise that this is
 all too ridiculous, amirite?

>scan gateman

 The gadget buzzes.

 "What?! Were you hoping to change me back?" harrumphs Old Man Almond.

>scan saltine

 The slider makes no noise.

>scan gateway

 Most of the screen goes blue, then a green dot and red dot bounce left

 so:
   GBBBBBR

>get away

 The gateway rumbles. "Bout time you figured it!" says Old Man Almond.
 "Let me use my trifle lifter here." He tugs down on the gate with his
 index finger, and it flips up. "What?! I can have magic powers, too!
 Couldn't a survived being a nametag otherwise!"

 The scenery behind the gate rumbles to grass, hills, and even a few
 thatched huts. "If you have any more questions...now's a good time to
 ask," says Old Man Almond.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>talk to gateman

 You engage in small talk, not sure what to ASK about.

 "Eh?! There's all sorts of things to ask me about! That goat back
 there! Your quest! Your purpose! The getaway! The rules! No time to
 scold clods asking about--whatever you just mumbled about."

>ask gateman about rules

 Well, you figured a few things out. Probably want to focus more on
 changing stuff than doing weird actions.

 "Like he was thought up by a demonic comedian. Seemed a poseur when he
 uprose but he made a desireable age disagreeable. He'd make a poignant

 Hit points and magic points and all. Claimed our way was no more than
 multiple choice. Heard his cleats in the castle as he did something
 called "Leveling up." Tackled Raw Rori, a warrior, but we ignored

 beat us all. Rooftops of troops on Fort Oops. Profs too. Auctioned
 Education. I cautioned..." His eyes grow mistened. "Ten dimes say it's
 end times. We've waited for an upturn to turn up..."


 "Yes, yes, you got the first puzzle. Good adventurer, good adventurer.
 If you're interested, the gadget would've said Red-Green-Red-Red and
 the slider would've said Red-Blue-Green-Blue." (You record the
 information in your notepad under goat.)

 Your path is clear. Old Man Almond gets his hanky out. "Okay, hunt."

 "Thank you," you say.

 The gate disappears behind you, and you walk down a pathway, then yap

 You see what was once a bunch of small malls. Most lots appear vacant

 if you need a distraction.

 There's a lot more, and you could waste a lot of time here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Morgan Gorman was here!!!</span>

>examine malls

 They're labeled with letters, not numbers, though you can refer to
 them by number if you want. Of the various stores you see, only store
 r, store m, store i and store f look like you can do anything with
 them. Store r has a COMING SOON sign by it. A few others seem
 greyed-out, like in a video game or something. There can't be anything
 in any of them. (You record the information in your notepad under

 Not all at once.

 It's almost all grey, except for a touch of red at the corners. You
 probably need to see what's behind at least one other stores first.
 You also see a roster in the front door.

>scan store r

 Most of the screen goes blue, then a green dot and red dot bounce left
 and right across the slider screen, and they eventually wind up like
 so:
   BRBGBB

 The roster on the front of store R reads: "People who have earned a

>torres

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

 That seems like it should work, but you sense you have not done enough
 yet. In fact, you probably haven't even visited some place you need to
 work through. But maybe, soon, you will.

>enter store r

 It's closed and locked, and you won't find a key. Maybe you can do
 something else to it.

>enter store f

 It's closed and locked, and you won't find a key. Maybe you can do

>examine store f
>forest

 This is odd. It's kind of green on top, brown on the bottom. You smell
 pine needles and dirt and leaves you can't quite discern. You think
 back to the gateway and how you got here.


 The greens and browns of Store F coagulate and pull apart into an
 actual forest.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trips Strip</span>
 You see what was once a bunch of small malls. Most lots appear vacant

 There's a forest here where store F was.

 It's bigger on the inside than the outside, you're sure, or something

 As you walk in the forest, you hear rumors of monsters ravaging the
 surrounding areas. Not zombies, or vampires, or skeletons. Trying to
 figure what it is, you daydream maybe YOU could be that hero--so
 successfully that you get lost!
>look
 successfully that you get lost!Until you stumble on a small clearing.
 You think you smell something.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Softer Forest</span>
 There's no clear sign of clearings, but the leaves are soft here.
 There's a smell, too. Unusual but pleasant. There's also a lapsing
 sapling, half bent over from a breeze.

>examine sapling

 It seems to be bending south, away from the nice-smelling breeze.

>sniff air

 It's a weird smell, but you like it. You feel a breeze from the north,
 so that's the direction the smell must be from.

>go north

 You walk for a while, following your nose, and...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rest of Forest</span>
 This is the place where you tracked the odor to.

>smell

 It's an odor of new places and adventure and puzzles and how to get
 there. Which is all very good, but you'd like something more physical
 to help you.

>door

 The odor becomes thick and choking, then a wood you've never smelled
 before but know it's wood. The odor swirls into a door--plain except
 for a bulge. Like the gateway, nothing seems to be behind it. You'll
 probably need to figure how to open it.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>examine door

 It's got a big musical note painted on the front above a bulge which
 doesn't seem to belong on the door. It probably leads somewhere
 interesting, if you can get through it.

>bugle

 The ovular shape on the door rumbles then falls off. You see that
 extra bit is a horn--yes, you've definitely found a bugle. The door
 looks as impervious to force as ever, but maybe...?

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

 This is a kitchen, though it's a bit bare, except for the obligatory
 fridge and some really corny tune. There's also a tall trio of chef
 statues. South is the centrifuge room and east is somewhere less
 hectic.

 Some straw, too much to lug around in your hands, is here.

 You can also see a pile of grated parmesan cheese, a large packet of
 HOTSAUCE, a head of lettuce and a slab of steak here.

>examine statues

 Well, they are actually only six inches tall. But they're skinny
 enough that you sort of assume they're tall. Well, I'm assuming.
 There's a loose label on one of them.

>read label

 "We can help be something to base a whole spicy dish on! It may help
 you make a run through a border!"

>examine fridge

 A manila animal forms a lamina over it. Inside is a moldy pancake on a
 cake pan, but that lame meal is neither yours nor eatable-looking. You
 close the fridge.

 You can read it okay without taking it.

 A song with the chorus "He oft partook of the okra pot." The tune and

 song and not serious.


 The tortilla's coming together.

 You open the packet and squirt the sauce in the tortilla. You place
 the empty packet in a pocket, where you forget about it. The

 The poem drones on, and Pat gestures with a hand to the ear and nod of
 his head to make sure you're listening, not breaking his meter. Da da
 DA, da da DA, da da DA. That anapest is getting annoying, and you'd
 like to get rid of it, somehow.

 Woeful Pat can't decide if you're mocking him or trying to outdo him.
 But he is sure you're not listening carefully enough to his poem, so
 he coughs briefly to get your attention.

 It's about eight feet long and really dark and dented about halfway
 through--well, four-ninths of the way from the right. You are utterly
 unsure what it could possibly be guarding.

 You think back to how your nametag was creased, and how the roadblock
 probably doesn't change into anything too easy like a broad lock. The
 moor and the sack already felt a bit easy.

 Nothing happens. You worry your magic powers have failed, until a
 peasant strides out from the edge of the moor, carrying a bale of hay
 and singing a cheery song about nothing in particular. Distracted, you
 look over and smile.

 "Oh, does THAT resonate with your stone ear?" whines Woeful Pat.

 You notice his papers have crumbled (but don't worry, he has PLENTY of
 written drafts.) He storms off, claiming you will make a perfect
 arch-villain in his new socially significant blank-verse epic. Or yet
 another poor henchman who deserves but one line before a horrible

 A small piece of brocade is discarded away from the merchandise. You
 see scratchings above it.

 You can also see some freesia faeries, some heaths and some begonias
 here.

>examine brocade

 It's rather plain and white with lots of black bars. It would take a
 rabider braider than most to weave such a design. Scratchings above it
 indicate it's not part of the normal merchandise.

>scan brocade

 You feel a bit self-conscious waving your slider around such
 intrinsically magical beings. But they do not seem to mind.

 Most of the screen goes blue, then a green dot and red dot bounce left
 and right across the slider screen, and they eventually wind up like
 so:
   GBBBBBR

>barcode

 You take the brocade first--you're a bit embarrassed your magic seems
 more, well, applied than theirs.

 The faeries buzz around for a bit, peeved at your boldness. "Well,
 maybe you will do something for us some day."

 The FREE TO FREELOADERS scratching by the brocade vanishes as you take
 it. Nice magic touch, that.

 You turn your back and focus so the faeries can't see you mangle their
 gift. Or so they aren't jealous, or they don't laugh at how dumb your
 magic is.

 the same pattern.

 They're tied together so their stems seem to form a sort of narrow

 Reddish, pinkish, white. Kind of fragile, but they seem to silence

 They're visibly impressed. "Perhaps you are the word smyth who will

 A motto is here. It's on a placard, which would be wholly unnoticeable

 is.

>examine motto

 Somehow, someone named Too-Apt Pat Ott has managed to make a hash of
 grammar, logic, math, science and basic human decency in sixty
 letters. Sixty-four if it were spelled correctly.

 I'd tell you what it said, but you-the-person would be the worse for
 it. It's like Monty Python's funniest joke in the world that way. Even
 considering it makes you feel worried you'll forget simple stupid
 stuff, like what's a fruit and what's a vegetable.

 Your gadget gives BBBBGR. Since Motto is only five letters, you wonder

 What would a beaten-down city be without an ol' hotel? Both have seen
 better days, but this place has been trashed hardest. Everything's
 boarded up, and the only way out is east.

 A scary Night Thing is here, sitting on some sort of mattress.

 A ketchup bottle lies here, torn apart--and you have a prime suspect
 in the Night Thing that is roaring nearby.

>put tomato in bottle

 That can't contain things.

>examine tomato

 It's as rotten as the motto of Pat Ott's you extracted it from. It is
 probably even more rotten on the inside, not that you have the bravery
 to check. Yet it also has that staying power. It doesn't have any mold
 on it, yet.

 inner rottenness and backwards logic from the (oops, a) motto kicks
 in. The beast wonders what sort of villain would DO that to ketchup.
 It looks at you in fear, sure you have more where that came from, and
 retreats into an unseen hole, scratching and clawing.

 The mattress the Night Thing was on is slightly but noticeably bumpy.
 It's also ripped open, and it's concealing something rather badly.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>examine mattress

 The Smartest Mattress doesn't have a one-page proof of Fermat's Last
 Theorem in it or anything. It just "remembers" the shape of whatever
 sat on it for a long, long time. The bump in the mattress is obvious
 enough that you have to take another look. You find a small machine
 labeled, apparently, a termite emitter, and you take it.

>examine machine

 It's a small black box, six inches by six inches. It probably holds a
 lot of termites. You can switch it when you need to. Someone has
 scratched a circle with a line through it over a dollar sign. You

 More annoying banter. Perhaps you could disperse them with the right

 Reason So Near from Sane Sean, Farce Facer and Saltier Realist:
 --If you can change stuff, why can't the people who made the gadget
 and slider? Or why couldn't they find someone off the street? Perhaps
 they're the real enemy and you're the pawn.
 --If they really wanted you to clean things up, why can't you take
 both the cabinet items?
 --That NEW DOOR is not really ONE WORD. Same as the guy who can lift
 it! They are two short words, easier than one big scary seven-letter
 word.
 --Anyone smart enough to untangle this world won't get any fulfillment
 from doing so. So there, stupider disputer!

 It'd all be distressingly persuasive gotcha-logic if you hadn't been
 able to flip that toga. But this is a fantasy world, so there's a
 chance he's wrong.

 "...How I do it, idiot."

 "Who?"

>ask nerds about rail

 The nerds look at each other, wondering why you would ask about that,
 really. They are sure you have something important to ask them. Maybe
 somewhere you can't get to or through. They could figure it out if in
 your shoes.

 Hmm. Apparently, when you ASK NERDS, you need to come correct. All the
 same, you're a bit annoyed, and you wonder if you can maybe play a
 mean trick on them to get that tulip, instead.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Undesired Underside</span>
 This is some sort of seedy underground intersection with a train

 The beats aren't audible here, but conversation voices rant on. The

 All in all, this place probably has a high property value, and people

 Some dry cake is here. Nobody else is lower-class enough to eat it,

 You could go back north, and there's a fuzzy looking wall to the west,

 You unpeel the barcode, slap it on the keycard, and it is a perfect

 Hmm. Apparently, when you ASK NERDS, you need to come correct. All the

 A conceders' crescendo follows a claim nerds'd LIKE to help everyday
 stupid people.

>use bag on nerds

 Use is a bit too vague for this game's parser to understand. You can
 SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH
 something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as
 well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.

>open bag. drop bag

 I noticed you used a period to separate commands. Unfortunately, the
 parser in Inform seems to have an extremely obscure bug (#1011 at
 inform7.com) that interacts with the solution to this game if you
 separate commands with periods. It was noticed near the release
 deadline, and it manifests itself when you refer to an in-game item or
 person or thing as one in a series of commands, usually three or more.

 I do this not to call out the people who've worked so hard on making
 Inform 7 robust and accessible but to warn you that there are certain
 commands you may wish to type by themselves, because this game taxes
 the parser. I accept if you choose to downgrade this game as a judge
 because of this, or because I may be wrong that the bug is on Inform's
 end.

 It looks at you in fear, sure you have more where that came from, and
 retreats into an unseen hole, scratching and clawing.

 You see what was once a bunch of small malls. Most lots appear vacant

 Some stairs lead down from the wreckage of store I, further than you

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">An Odd Low Woodland</span>
 You've reached an odd low woodland. There's a gigantic set of poles

>toe holds

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>toeholds

 That'll do it! The toolshed crumbles, leaving only the small
 outcroppings--which somehow fly into the slope.They're plentiful and
 stable. You could probably climb up now. You probably don't need those
 tools you made.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by two points.]</span>

>climb

 (the the slider's screen)
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">An Odd Low Woodland</span>
 You've reached an odd low woodland. There's a gigantic slope you could
 climb off to the east. You see toeholds on the slope.

>go east

 You make it up the slope with some effort and surprisingly little
 risk. You didn't even need any climbing gadgets. The toeholds are more
 like footholds, really.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Potshot Hotspot</span>
 An arid, trod dirt road. East is siesta.

 Oh dear. A horde. Uprisers--surprise--protesting YOU! A full-blown
 riot.

 The rioters decry The Villain In The Villa. The one they're blocking
 you from. Well, you weren't expecting airtight logic.

>examine horde

 Well, you have to admit, there's a wide variety of people protesting
 you, even if they're not explaining why. The riot will probably be
 blocking your way to the east, but they don't seem to be attacking
 you, which is nice.

 You probably can't take the whole riot at once, but it'd be nice to
 have a way to weed out most of them.

 "GO, CURSE-SCOURGE!" the rioters chant.

>listen

 Silent.

 The rioters accuse you of animal cruelty: making monotremes into
 metronomes.

>again

 Quite quiet.

 The rioters decry The Villain In The Villa. The one they're blocking
 you from. Well, you weren't expecting airtight logic.

>scan horde

 Most of the screen goes blue, then a green dot and red dot bounce left
 and right across the slider screen, and they eventually wind up like
 so:
   BBRG

 The rioters lambaste your work in the forest with a meat slab.

>trio

 Your word seems to have no effect. But that's just because the least
 enthusiastic people in the back leave first. Others follow--one of
 them even drops some chain links. And soon, just three people remain.
 The most energetic and dedicated, of course, but altering that
 triangle can't be too hard, can it?

 It's still a protest. But while three's a crowd, they look similar.

 You're presented with accusations you'd make the holiest hostile.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Potshot Hotspot</span>
 An arid, trod dirt road. East is siesta.

 Three can still be a protest as well as a crowd, apparently. They're
 blocking your way east.

 You can see some chain links here.

 Some bitter lug says you're the litterbug throwing darn glass in his
 grassland.

>f links

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>links

 (examining instead)
 A bunch of ovular links hooked together. Out of the hands of rioters,
 it'll cause less achin'. You notice they are Made In China. But
 they're still more violent things than you'd like, this near your
 manor.

 The remaining protesters decry The Villain In The Villa. The one
 they're blocking you from. Well, you weren't expecting airtight logic.

>slink

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>scan links

 Most of the screen goes blue, then a green dot and red dot bounce left

 so:
   BBBGR

 One carries an AVENGE GENEVA sign. You've never been there.

>kilns

 The links burst and swell into luxury kilns. The yelling's loud as
 ever but increasingly directed at the kilns and not you. The
 protesters seem distracted.

 Some bitter lug says you're the litterbug throwing darn glass in his

 You can see some kilns here.

 "HILLSIDE SHILL, DIE!" they chant.

>go east

 They still outnumber you. And they're still angrier, too. Gotta calm
 them down.

 The visceral cavilers continue their masculine calumnies.

>inventory

 Item time! You are carrying:
   some ropes
   some grips
   a tinfoil info-lit
   a salient saltine
   an idlers' slider
   a dope tan notepad

 The tough-on-sin remaining protesters continue on shouting.

>examine road

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine kiln

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine kilns

 You certainly managed to summon the deluxe version. I guess all that
 practice earlier in the game, you learned how to give your anagrams
 OOMPH. You gaze at your work proudly, but it's not work you can work
 with further.

 "HILLSIDE SHILL, DIE!" they chant.

>examine protesters

 They're all smeared with--huh? Looks like clay?

 The remaining protesters seem particularly upset you destroyed store I
 & R.

>bake protesters

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>scan protesters

 Most of the screen goes blue, then a green dot and red dot bounce left
 and right across the slider screen, and they eventually wind up like
 so:
   GBBBBRB

 The remaining protesters frame themselves as lackers, you as a
 slacker.

>pot rest

 That's not something you can say, do or see here.

>potters

 The trio grows even more lethargic. A fellow in a smock mocks the
 whole charade before throwing the smock in a corner. He talks with his
 two friends. Shortly, they see the kilns nearby. They go to work
 happily.
>go east
 happily.You hear a shout from the south and see a man too ham-nosed to
 be handsome. He washes down some walnuts of wan lust with liquid from
 a purple metal can labeled Sado-Soda.

 "I am RED BULL BURDELL!" he shouts, in a voice neither earthy nor
 hearty. "From my ROOTS to my TORSO!"

 He's the size of a large hut, bellowing real thug laughter. "Ever
 since I came over in a CANOE from the OCEAN, I forged my RESPECT
 SCEPTER from iron noir and put it to great use! Once, you rodents
 snorted."

 Moving from angered to enraged, he throws down a battle tablet, which
 shatters.

 "I will not waste sweat. GET OUT!!!! My ideal time? IMMEDIATELY!
 Nuance is nuisance!"

 The potters flee with their kilns, which had handy wheels you didn't
 notice, to a mowed meadow. Bad time to maunder unarmed.
>push space
 notice, to a mowed meadow. Bad time to maunder unarmed.
 "GET OUT!!!!" yells Red Bull. "Turn, runt!"

 His boot swings within an inch of your chin.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>


 Broody gape? Ruin!

>go east

 Not with Red Bull Burdell around you aren't.

 "GET OUT!!!!" yells Red Bull. "Loser role's yours, pasty patsy!"

 His boot swings within an inch of your chin again.

>examine red bull

 His face is covered with crass scars. He's more muscly and less clumsy
 than you, and yet, he has a toe that sticks out. You think back to
 Achilles for some reason.

 "GET OUT!!!!" yells Red Bull. "You should BLUSH, SHLUB!"

 His boot swings within an inch of your chin yet again.

>scan red bull

 He kicks the slider out of the way! You were only able to read BRGBBB.
 He's not going to let you near it.

 "GET OUT!!!!" yells Red Bull. "Turn, runt!"

 His boot swings within an inch of your chin, prompting one of your
 finest feints.

>kick toe

 It'll be clear when you need violence. And how. Hopefully.

 "GET OUT!!!!" yells Red Bull. "You're SO THIN, you'll get NO HITS on
 me!"

 His boot swings within an inch of your chin. Be neat if he got beaten.

>tug toe

 "No go, goon!" you yell, grabbing his toe.

 You hold on as he yells "HA! Inept!" ...
 You hold on as he yells "HA! Inept!" ...

 "THE PAIN!" Burdell's toe yellows, and he yells "OW!" first irately,
 then tearily, before facing reality--he is shrinking!

 You ignore the predator's teardrops through a rain of "No fair!"

 Then he moans "No Mas," fleeing the feeling. Ya won! No way!

 You can see an idlers' slider here.

 You take the slider, again.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roman Manor</span>
 You're in a beautiful, big residence. I could ramble about the marble,
 praise a spire, note the toaster rotates, or sanction what it
 contains, but really--you sense one last hurdle hurled in your way to
 happiness.

 The darned <span class="floydstyle em">exits</span> are all around, but you just want to do less
 than nothing. Your slider rattles for hopefully the last time.

>scan exits

 The slider makes no noise.

>examine slider

 Your slider's not near anything, but it's registering GBBRB. That
 can't be for the manor itself, though.

>exist

 That is all that's left to do. It's time to become an adventurer
 emeritus. Perhaps one day you will resume it, but for now, the allures
 of your laurels are too great. Doing without the outwith, you begin
 your being binge, mentally writing the happiest epitaths to your
 vaunted, er, adventure. Where IS that notepad?
