 Foo!

 (first taking the kernel of belief)
 You reach for belief, hardly trusting it not to vanish, but it settles

 into your body.

 Ragnarok: Twilight of the Gods
 A New Year's SpeedIF Game (with non-standard parameters: type XYZZY for
 details)
 Release 1 / Serial number 111230 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11 S

 Your Kitchen
 This is the place where you prepare food. And by "prepare food", of
 course, I mean "microwave frozen burritos" and "call for pizza". It's
 fitted out with all the usual amenities: refrigerator, stove,
 microwave, cabinets, a large disembodied brain floating in the corner.
 Pretty much your standard IF protagonist's kitchen. The living room is
 to the east.

 Mindo is floating placidly in the corner.

>examine self
 As good-looking as ever.

>pet brain
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>xyzzy
 vimes says, "Hm.  Kernels, Ragnarok, mind, a copper coin, and a
 badly-implemented NPC."

>tickle brain
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>rub brain
 You achieve nothing by this.

>examine brain
 Ah, Mindo The Mind. You and Mindo have been friends ever since third
 grade, when a bunch of bigger kids were picking on you for not knowing
 how to balance a checkbook, and Mindo defended you by telekinetically
 flinging all of the bullies through the air into the community swimming
 hole on the other side of town. Good times. He's never been much of a
 conversationalist, but he's an awesome roommate and the coolest
 disembodied brain you've ever met.

>ask brain about pizza
 Mindo telepathically communicates, "I don't know much about that."

>ask brain about himself
 Mindo telepathically communicates, "I don't know much about that."

>think about cheese
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>think
 What a good idea.

>ask brain about me
 Mindo telepathically communicates, "I don't know much about that."

>ask brain about his feelings
 Mindo telepathically communicates, "I don't know much about that."

 Pretty much your standard IF protagonist's kitchen. The living room is

 Mindo is floating placidly in the corner.

>prepare food
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take all
 Mindo: I don't suppose Mindo would care for that.
 lights: They're hardly portable.
 refrigerator: That's hardly portable.
 freezer: That's hardly portable.
 telephone: It's two in the morning. It's too late to be calling anyone
 on the phone.
 stove: That's hardly portable.
 microwave oven: That's hardly portable.
 cabinets: They're hardly portable.

>call for pizza
 It's two in the morning. It's too late to be calling anyone on the
 phone.

>open fridge
 That seems like a monumentally unwise idea. The last time you opened
 the fridge, you ended up spending a week in the hospital and lost all
 memories for thirty-six hours before and after the event. But hey, if
 you want to give it a shot, it's your funeral.

>open freezer
 Dang, no more burritos. You'll have to go to the store.

>open cabinets
 You open the cabinets, revealing a bowl of unpopped popcorn kernels and
 a fuse box.

>examine box
 (the microwave oven)
 A black box with a door and numbers on the front. You use it to reheat
 schezuan shrimp, nuke frozen burritos and pop popcorn.

>take kernels
 Taken.

>examine fuse
 Which do you mean, the fuse box or the dusty fuse?

>wear kernels
 You can't wear that!

>open fuse box
 That's not something you can open.

>eat kernels
 You try one. Ow! No wonder people pop these first.

>examine dusty
 It's a dusty old fuse that has served you well for years.

>open microwave
 Fortunately, you haven't accidentally left anything in there overnight.
 This time.

>put kernals in microwave
 You can't see any such thing.

>get kernels
 You already have that.

>put kernels in microwave
 You're about to put the bowl of popcorn kernels into the microwave when
 you feel a telekinetic tug at your arm.

 Mindo telepathically communicates, "You shouldn't make popcorn without
 oil. Unless you have an air popper. Which we don't."

 Mindo is, as usual, correct.

>get oil
 You can't see any such thing.

>comb hair
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>remove oil from hair
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine stove
 You have mixed emotions when you think back to the day you last used
 this stove. You were making tuna noodle casserole. You're still not
 exactly sure why the contents exploded, but you haven't been able to
 pry the oven open since.

 Living Room
 Everyone is here! Lisa's settled into the big armchair, Thor is hanging
 out on the couch, Mindo is -- well, Mindo's still in the kitchen, but
 he'll come in when the movie starts, undoubtedly. You've already got
 the DVD in your combination TV/DVD player, so you just need to turn it
 on and late night movie night can begin!

 Thor rumbles, "The time has come for time for Ragnarok, Twilight of the
 Gods! THOR MUST NOT BE KEPT WAITING!"

 Your reflexes serve you well, as you duck just before a lightning bolt
 arcs from Thor's fingers, passing inches from your head, and striking
 someplace in the kitchen behind you. Instantly, all the lights go dark.

 "Oops," rumbles Thor, "Did I do that?"

>ask mindo about mindo
 You can't see any such thing.

>think about mindo
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>short-range telepathy
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask lisa about oil
 Lisa mumbles, "Wake me up when it's time for the popcorn and the movie,
 'K?"

>examine lisa
 Lisa is dozing in the big armchair.

>examine thor
 Thor, the Norse god of thunder, is hanging out on the couch.

>get oil
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask thor about oil
 Thor rumbles, "The time has come for Ragnarok, Twilight of the Gods!"

>look under couch
 You poke around between the couch cushions.

 Thor rumbles, "This is an indignity up with which I should not have to
 put!" But he still lifts his butt cheek enough to let you check
 underneath the cushion he's sitting on.

 Jackpot! You come away with a candy wrapper, a quarter, a small bottle
 of oil, a penny, a dime and a wad of cat hair!

>eat chair hair
 I only understood you as far as wanting to eat Lisa.

>eat cat
 That's plainly inedible.

>examine cat
 Odd, really, as neither you nor Mindo has ever actually owned a cat.

>go west

 Pretty much your standard IF protagonist's kitchen. The living room is
 to the east.

 It's also pretty dark in here. It's a good thing you've got excellent
 night vision, or else that could be somewhat inconvenient.

 Mindo is floating placidly in the corner.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>put coin in fuse
 Which do you mean, the fuse box or the burnt-out fuse?

>get burnt-out fuse
 Taken.

>put coin in fuse box
 You can't see any such thing.

>put penny in fuse box
 Yowch! You suck your fingers for a moment, wondering if maybe you
 should get a trained electrician to stick pennies in your fuse box in
 the future.

 But on the plus side, the lights are back on!

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a burnt-out fuse
   a wad of cat hair
   a dime
   a small bottle of oil
   a quarter
   a candy wrapper
   a bowl of unpopped popcorn kernels

>put oil on popcorn
 You pour the oil over the popcorn kernels and dispose of the bottle.

>put popcorn in microwave
 You put the bowl of oiled popcorn kernels into the microwave, set it
 for two minutes and thirty-four seconds, and close the door.

 A few moments later, you hear a sizzling, popping noise.

 A few moments after that, the microwave explodes.

 Hrm. I probably should have mentioned that it was a metal bowl. My bad.

 Mindo is floating placidly in the corner.

>examine microwave
 A total mess. The door hangs off at a decorative (but non-functional)
 angle, the timer display is cracked down the middle, and every part of
 it is pitted with black scorch marks. On the plus side, the microwave
 is full of freshly-popped popcorn.

>take it
 That's hardly portable.

>get popcorn
 Taken.

>eat popcorn
 You try a mouthful. It's tasty! Admittedly, it could use some salt, but
 you've already done enough for this puzzle, so we'll just call it
 tasty.

>wake lisa
 Lisa mumbles, "Wake me up when it's time for the popcorn and the movie,
 'K?"

>turn on player
 Lisa immediately kicks the power button with her foot, turning it back
 off again.

 Lisa mumbles, "Can't watch a movie without popcorn..."

 Thor rumbles, "But The time has come for Ragnarok, Twilight of the
 Gods!"

 From the other room, Mindo telepathically communicates, "Providing
 snacks is one of your duties as a host."

 Mindo is, as usual, correct.

>examine player
 The DVD is already in the player. You just need to turn it on.

>give popcorn to lisa
 Lisa mumbles, "Rock on. Let's start the flick, guys."

>turn on player
 You turn on the DVD player and TV, then join Thor on the couch. Mindo
 drifts in from the kitchen as the copyright notice plays. Lisa munches
 her popcorn, and the opening title sequence finally begins:

 RAGNAROK: TWILIGHT OF THE GODS

 Thor rumbles, "Huzzah!"

 Your reflexes serve you well, as you duck just before a lightning bolt
 arcs from Thor's fingers, passing inches from your head, and striking
 someplace in the kitchen behind you. Instantly, all the lights go dark.

 "Oops," rumbles Thor, "Did I do that?"

>go to the shop
 You can't see any such thing.

>look under couch
 You poke around between the couch cushions.

 Thor rumbles, "This is an indignity up with which I should not have to
 put!" But he still lifts his butt cheek enough to let you check
 underneath the cushion he's sitting on.

 Jackpot! You come away with a candy wrapper, a quarter, a small bottle
 of oil, a penny, a dime and a wad of cat hair!

>take all
 lights: They're hardly portable.
 Lisa: I don't suppose Lisa would care for that.
 Thor: I don't suppose Thor would care for that.
 (couch): Alas, there are no more treasures to be found in the sofa for
 the time being.
 combination TV/DVD player: That's hardly portable.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a wad of cat hair
   a dime
   a penny
   a small bottle of oil
   a quarter
   a candy wrapper

>examine wrapper
 It's apparently from an Almond Joy.

>examine quarter
 Twenty-five cents! That's enough to buy a Garfield phone at a yard
 sale. Too bad it's Canadian.

>examine dime
 Ten cents. At one time, this is what you needed if you wanted to make a
 phone call.

>examine oil
 You're not really sure what kind of oil this is, but you think it might
 be left over from when Mindo took that massage class. It's amazing what
 he was able to do for the knots in your shoulders despite not actually
 possessing hands.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>sit on couch
 You get onto the (couch).

>go west
 You'll have to get off the (couch) first.

>stand
 You get off the (couch).

 Living Room
 Everyone is here! Lisa's settled into the big armchair, Thor is hanging
 out on the couch, Mindo is -- well, Mindo's still in the kitchen, but
 he'll come in when the movie starts, undoubtedly. You've already got
 the DVD in your combination TV/DVD player, so you just need to turn it
 on and late night movie night can begin!

 It's also pretty dark in here. It's a good thing you've got excellent
 night vision, or else that could be somewhat inconvenient.

 Your Kitchen
 This is the place where you prepare food. And by "prepare food", of
 course, I mean "microwave frozen burritos" and "call for pizza". It's
 fitted out with all the usual amenities: refrigerator, stove,
 microwave, cabinets, a large disembodied brain floating in the corner.
 Pretty much your standard IF protagonist's kitchen. The living room is
 to the east.

 It's also pretty dark in here. It's a good thing you've got excellent
 night vision, or else that could be somewhat inconvenient.

 Mindo is floating placidly in the corner.

>open fridge
 That seems like a monumentally unwise idea. The last time you opened
 the fridge, you ended up spending a week in the hospital and lost all
 memories for thirty-six hours before and after the event. But hey, if
>open microwave
 you want to give it a shot, it's your funeral.

 Fortunately, you haven't accidentally left anything in there overnight.
 This time.

>put quarter in fuse box
 You can't see any such thing.

>open fridge
 You take a deep breath, brace yourself against the unknown, and open
 the door.

 Do you remember that scene near the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark?

 Yeah, well. This ain't the glory of God here, but the outcome is
 otherwise strikingly similar. Better luck next time around.

 Tanning Salon (in the tanning bed)
 The walls feature a few posters of smiling tanned blonde people walking
 down streets, along beaches, eating ice cream, etc. The room itself is
 fairly cold and uninviting. You can get back to the shopping center
 through the hall to the south, and perhaps that would be for the best.

 Your discarded clothing lies in a heap on the floor.

 You're already wearing those!

>examine pocket
 In the pockets, you find a genuine 1932 Shiny Time brass harmonica, a
 pair of carved bone dice, a single chopstick, a small can of liver
 paté, four small smooth stones, and a resin-encased quantity of hare's
 fur.

 Food Court
 A dozen garish illuminated signs advertise overcooked and overpriced
 foods from various stalls. Out of all of them, there's only one place
 here in which you would be caught dead.

 The familiar golden arches beckon onwards.

 The thoughts of has occured here in days gone by and what will occur in
 the imminent future fill you with a warm feeling of contentment. This
 is good.

 You can see a cashier here.

>examine arches
 You can't see any such thing.

>cashier
 She is wearing a T-shirt reading "I killed my father and all I got was
 this lousy t-shirt" and a dull expression.

 A woman and three even larger children waddle to the nearest table,
 bags of food in tow. Disgusting.

>eat cashier
 (first taking the cashier)
 I don't suppose the cashier would care for that.

 A tall, thin man takes his salad and practically sprints to a table in
 the middle of the dining area. Deplorable.

 Delicious.

 As you finish, you are overcome by an extreme feeling of dread.
 Suddenly, Tiny Tim bursts from the floor, destroying half of the dining
 area in an explosion of magma and ash. Your hair is nearly singed by a
 burning chunk of formica flying past your head.

 "LESLIE!" he screams, pointing at you.

 "Er... yes?"

 Apocalypse
 Most of the restaurant is a smoking crater. A few upturned tables and
 chairs are scattered around the perimeter. The roof is now open to the
 sky, which seems to be turning an unpleasant shade of red. The exit
 back to the mall has been blocked with what seems to be a stack of
 bodies.

 Tiny Tim hovers a foot off the crater floor, his long hair sticking out
 wildly in all directions. Dust and debris orbits slowly around him.

 A fallen brick lies close at hand.

 "LESLIE! I HAVE COME FOR YOU!"

>get brick
 Taken.

 A sizable piece of the ceiling falls on the really rather poorly named
 former singer. He's stunned for a moment.

>examine bodies
 The former McDonalds customers are piled here in front of the exit to
 the mall. You'll neer be able to move them in time.

>throw brick at tim
 Being struck by this latest weight proves too much for him to absorb
 the momentum of. He loses his balance and collapses to the ground in a
 pile of rubble.

 shift under your foot. At last you reach the top of the pile.

 Apocalypse (on the pile of rubble)
 Most of the restaurant is a smoking crater. A few upturned tables and
 chairs are scattered around the perimeter. The roof is now open to the
 sky, which seems to be turning an unpleasant shade of red. The exit
 back to the mall has been blocked with what seems to be a stack of
 bodies.

 From this vantage point, you notice a bent and twisted girder dangling
 from the hole in the ceiling.

 You can also see a brick here.

>examine girder
 It lies just out of reach.

>get it
 It is too far below you.

>jump
 You manage to grab the girder and shimmy your way to freedom.

 Roof
 You are standing on the very sparsely implemented roof of the shopping
 center. Vultures are still circling overhead in the quickly darkening
 sky.

 Every so often, a piece of debris or stream of dust falls from the
 great gaping hole in the roof.

 A large pyramidal skylight stands before you.

>jump
 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

 You can't go that way.

 Roof
 You are standing on the very sparsely implemented roof of the shopping
 center. Vultures are still circling overhead in the quickly darkening
 sky.

 Every so often, a piece of debris or stream of dust falls from the
 great gaping hole in the roof.

 A large pyramidal skylight stands before you.

 paté.

 You fix one end to the steel frame of the skylight and let the other
 end dangle down into the shopping center.

>climb rope
 You rappel off the steel frame of the skylight and make about three
 handfulls worth of progress down into the mall before some piece of
 clothing gives way. You never did earn your knot-tying merit badge.

 Some time later, you come to...

 Ghosts of the Past
 A cold wind blows through the ruins of the shopping center. Shards of
 glass, fallen bricks, and bodies litter the ground. The power is out,
 and you can barely see anything in the twilight. Every so often, an
 animal howls in the distance. Something seems disturbingly familiar
 about the smell of death and decay here.

 The only way that has not been ruined or blocked by debris is the Video
 Head shop, to the west.

 You can see a small smooth stone here.

>get stone
 Taken.

>go west
 The electricity suddenly flickers on as you enter.

 Video Head
 Rows and rows of vapid entertainment titles fill every square foot of
 this drab, depressing store. The full extent of the design imperative
 in decorating this place was apparently "gray".

 A single, solitary copy of Doom III lies dejectedly in the back corner
 of the store.

 A pale man, reigning over all he sees from his perch behind the
 counter, sneers at your presence in his fine establishment.

 Wait. You realize, with dawning horror, that standing behind the
 counter is in fact not the Video Head clerk at all, but your evil twin!

 "Leslie, dear, what ARE you wearing?"

>howl
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>smell twin
 You smell nothing unexpected.

 "You know what, Leslie, I think we've been too hard on each other over
 the years. How about a truce?" Sam pauses for a second, but before you
 can respond: "Well, that was fun! What do you want to play now?"

>examine doom

 Sam does that eyeball thing that you hate. So aggravating!

>punch twin
 Deftly parried by the e-peen hammer.

 "You know what, Leslie, I think we've been too hard on each other over
 the years. How about a truce?" Sam pauses for a second, but before you
 can respond: "Well, that was fun! What do you want to play now?"

>open box
 You open the copy of Doom III, revealing a fine pewter space marine,
 some depleted uranium dog tags, an Official Doom III Strategy guide, an
 Unofficial Doom III Strategy Guide, a jewel case, an order form, and an
 ID code.

 Your evil twin takes a product from one of the shelves and dropkicks it
 out the door. "Not that I don't appreciate this fine establishment, but
 you know what they say: if you've seen one shopping center, you've seen
 the mall!" Deplorable.

 You can't bring yourself to perform such a charitable act to your evil
 twin. Perhaps in a less direct manner...

 Your twin crushes a fly that had landed on the counter. Now we can add
 animal cruelty to the list of atrocities comitted.

>ask sam about her feelings
 There is no reply.

 Your evil twin twirls an imaginary moustache. The fiend!

>put box on table
 You can't see any such thing.

>put box on counter
 "How utterly boring. Can't you find something more interesting?" Sam
 swats the copy of Doom III off of the counter.

 Sam does that eyeball thing that you hate. So aggravating!

 Your evil twin takes your mum's shoes and tries them on, practically
 giddy with excitement.

 Sam looks absolutely ridiculous wearing the dog tags and mother's

 Danse Nocturne

 It is always twilight in Ingelheim,
 in the forest the lady slides across
 the crumpled leaves entranced by Elbegast.
 Her nightclothes sweep the same old lemniscate,
 with Elbegast's wood gauntlets at her waist.
 Tired eyes gaze listlessly, with lips shut tight.
 The lady longs to end the dance but she
 cannot. The only thing she does is dance
 and dance and dance. But oh how she can dance!
 Gracefully and sweetly; solemnly or
 perkily; eagerly, or most often,
 reluctantly. However she dances,
 she always dances inevitably.

>quickly
>jauntily
 One two three steps, beneath the willow tree.
 Right foot forward, eyes staring straight through him.

 The lady dances many other ways.

>aboutly
 The lady dances many other ways.

>gracefully
 A swan is just a swan, an angry bird.
 The moon is just the moon, a glowing rock.
 But the lady is a graceful swan and
 when dancing she becomes his moon and stars.

>coyly
 The lady dances many other ways.

>clumsily
 The lady dances many other ways.

>reluctantly
 The black knight clasps the lady tighter still.
 "Sweet," he whispers, "did I not win you fair?"

>fairly
 "Well, you are just my wife," says Elbegast.
 "You're just my partner, sharing life and death."

>inadvertantly
 The lady dances many other ways.

>suspiciously
 The lady dances many other ways.

>angrily
 With vicious strides the lady looks around,
 and hopes to find, observe, the means to kill.


>xyzzyly
 The lady dances many other ways.

>badly
 "Is this how you once danced with Eggerich?"
 says Elbegast a tad resentfully.

>sensually
 The lady dances many other ways.

>resentfully
 The lady barely lets herself be dragged
 across the leaves that lie beneath their treading feet.

>energetically
 Four five six steps along the trickling stream.
 Her spine aligned: left turn, right turn, now twist.

>gracefully
 Although he is afixed by beauty clearly,
 he could not love a mortal woman, could he?

>lovingly
 Was Eggerich a violent plotting man?
 Should now the lady thank Elbegast?

>gratefully
 The lady holds her brand new husband dear,
 although his hands once slew a man she'd loved.

>viennese-waltzfully
 The lady dances many other ways.

>lustily
 The lady dances many other ways.

>dangerously
>safely
 The lady dances many other ways.

>pointedly
 The beady owls in trees behold the star
 that shines out even Elbegast himself.

>well
 The lady always dances well, except
 when she's attempting sprightly twisting turns.

>naughtily
 The lady dances many other ways.

>david brent style

>again
 The lady dances many other ways.

>sprightly
 Quite gaily she forgets her Eggermond!
 This brand new man in hand: she eggs him on.

>ruefully
 The lady dances many other ways.

>mercifully
 The lady dances many other ways.

>rhythmically
 The lady dances many other ways.

>gaily
 The lady dances many other ways.

>examine woman
 The lady dances many other ways.

>not at all
 The lady dances many other ways.

>regretfully
 The lady dances many other ways.

>powerfully
 The lady dances many other ways.

>wearily
 The lady dances many other ways.

>stiffly
 The lady dances many other ways.

>slowly
 Now when a lady steps so slowly with
 a man she's meant to love, does reason fill
 her sleepy head or has she met defeat?

>crump
 The lady dances many other ways.

>sleepily
 Is she sleepwalking in her waking life?
 Or twilight dreaming in her sleeping time?

>defeatedky
 The lady dances many other ways.

>defeatedly
 The lady lets herself be led across,
 by Elbegast, the damp and leaf-strewn ground.
 "Finally love, are you acquiescent?"

>lustily
 The lady dances many other ways.

>acquiescently
 Her shoulders slump. Does she accept defeat?

>finally
 The lady dances many other ways.

>no
 The lady dances many other ways.

>victoriously
 The lady dances many other ways.

>defiantly
 The lady dances many other ways.

>lucidly
 The lady dances many other ways.

>angrily
 With vicious strides the lady looks around,
 and hopes to find, observe, the means to kill.


>sneakily
 The lady dances many other ways.

>murderously
 With vicious strides the lady looks around,
 and hopes to find, observe, the means to kill.


>dangerously
>observantly
 A gnarled oak grows beside the clearing where
 the mismatched partners shuffle slowly past.
 A vicious branch oft points towards the back
 of Elbegast who tugs his newly wed.
 A newly wed who's stronger than she looks...


>strongly
 The time has come the noble lady thinks,
 to end for good this horrifying dance.
 They dance a final lemniscate across
 the twilight forest floor of Ingelheim.
 She dances "til his back is to the spike
 with strength so hideous she shoves him hard!
 He cries a tear, the spike ripping a tear
 through now bloodstained gut besmirched evening wear.
 Her second husband dead before her hands,
 the sun now rises first on Ingelheim.

 Stupid Mom made you take your stupid little brother to town for stupid
 Christmas shopping in the freezing cold. And now you have to cross this
 stupid freezing-cold creek in a stupid boat to get back home.

 Stupid Creek. Stupid Christmas.
 A Christmas puzzle by Troy Jones III
 Release 1 / Serial number 111225 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 East Bank of the Creek
 It's starting to snow, but the ground is too warm for it to stick.

 The stupid rowboat sits here on the shore.

 Tim plays his stupid video game thingy, seemingly completely oblivious
 to everything.

>tim
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine tim
 Mom says you and Tim are "Irish twins" since you were born less than a
 year apart. You call him your evil twin since he's ALWAYS trying to get
 you in trouble. Some of the kids at school call him "Tiny Tim", which
 is from a movie or whatever. He's wearing a black shirt that says "I
 killed my father and all I got was this lousy t-shirt", and he also has
 on a dark gray winter jacket, faded black jeans, black sneakers, and a
 knit cap with a black and purple zigzag pattern. (Nothing says dark
 edgy goth dude like a black-and-purple knit cap). His stupid pimply
 nose is in his stupid video game player thing as usual. Also as usual,
 he smells like stupid Axe body-spray.

>push tim
 That would be less than courteous.

>examine me
 You're wearing a long chartreuse sweater, black wool leggings, adorable
 white fluffy earmuffs, white mittens, and a pair of uggs. You hate how
 stupidly pale you look in the winter-- if Mom weren't so cruel and
 hearltess, she'd bring you with her to the spa and let you spend some
 quality time in a tanning bed. In your mittens you're carrying a copy
 of Doom III and some fake designer Italian shoes.

>examine boat
 A stupid-looking boat with stupid oars to make it go.

>enter boat
 You know from experience that trying to get in the boat while holding
 something is a bad idea. You don't want to risk falling into the creek.

>put doom in creek
 That can't contain things.

>drop all
 copy of Doom III: You toss the stupid copy of Doom III on the ground.
 fake designer Italian shoes: You hurl them to the ground.

>get time
 You can't see any such thing.

>put all in boat
 There are none at all available!

>examine earmuffs
 They're cute AND they keep you warm.

>remove them
 It's a chilly December day. Getting undressed now would be stupid.

>get tim
 I don't suppose Tiny Tim would care for that.

>tim, enter boat
 Tim waits just long enough to make you think he ignored you. But just
 as you start to open your mouth to repeat the order (with a few choice
 insults added), he starts to slowly drag his feet toward the boat, not
 taking his eyes off the stupid video game thing in his hand. And then
 finally stupid Tiny Tim gets into the stupid rowboat.

>look
 Stupid East Bank
 It's snowing, but the ground is too warm for it to stick.

 The stupid rowboat sits here stupidly with your stupid little brother
 in it, playing his stupid handheld video game thingy.

 You can also see some fake designer Italian shoes and a copy of Doom
 III here.

>get shoes
 Shaking your head at the ridiculousness of this whole situation, you
 snatch up the stupid fake designer Italian shoes.

>put shoes in boat
 You impatiently stuff the stupid fake designer Italian shoes into the
 stupid boat.

>enter boat
 There's not enough room left in the stupid boat for you to get in.

>push boat
 It is fixed in place.

>examine boat
 A stupid-looking boat with stupid oars to make it go. The stupid fake
 designer Italian shoes are in the bottom of the stupid boat.

>wear shoes
 (first taking the fake designer Italian shoes)
 Patience nearly gone, you grab the stupid fake designer Italian shoes.

 They're not the right size for you; Mom has big clumsy feet. Besides
 that, you wouldn't be caught dead in these stupid things.

>tim, cross creek
 Tiny Tim has better things to do.

>tim, e
 He just goes on playing that stupid game like he didn't even hear you.
 Honestly, he makes you want to throw things at him sometimes.

>tim, paddle the boat
 He just goes on playing that stupid game like he didn't even hear you.
 Honestly, he makes you want to throw things at him sometimes.

>throw shoes at tim
 Good plan. The fake designer Italian shoes sail gracefully through the
 air after leaving your mittened hand and bounce off Tim's shoulder.
 "Ow! Hey! Knock it off, Triniti!" he whines.

>enter boat
 You get into the stupid rowboat.

 Tim plays his stupid video game thingy. It makes stupid
 bleep-bloop-bloop noises.

>go west
 You row the boat across to the other shore, muttering darkly to
 yourself the whole way about how much your life really and truly sucks.

>look
 Stupid West Bank (in the stupid rowboat)
 You've made it to this side. Now to get everything else across.

 Tim plays his stupid video game thingy.

>time, get out
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>tim, get out
 Tiny Tim gets out of the stupid rowboat.

>examine boat
 A stupid-looking boat with stupid oars to make it go.

>look
 Stupid West Bank (in the stupid rowboat)
 You've made it to this side. Now to get everything else across.

 Tim plays his stupid video game thingy.

 "Don't you ever get tired of that stupid thing?" you ask.

 "Shut up," he replies.

>go west
 This is no time to go wandering off. Mom expects you to get these
 presents and your stupid brother home!

>row boat
 You row the boat across to the other shore, grumbling to yourself the
 whole way about this stupid freezing cold weather.

>get game
 Leaning out of the boat to try and reach something on the shore might
 tip the boat over. Mom says she'll kill you if you ruin the presents or
 drown in the creek-- better not risk it.

>get out
 You get out of the stupid rowboat.

 Stupid East Bank
 It's snowing, but the ground is too warm for it to stick.

 The stupid rowboat sits here stupidly.

 You can also see some fake designer Italian shoes and a copy of Doom
 III here.

>put shoes in boat
 (first taking the fake designer Italian shoes)

 Sighing, you snag the stupid fake designer Italian shoes.

 You hastily toss the stupid fake designer Italian shoes into the stupid
 boat.

>put game in boat
 (first taking the copy of Doom III)
>get game

 Patience nearly gone, you seize the stupid copy of Doom III.

 You sigh and stuff the stupid copy of Doom III into the stupid boat.

 Silently fuming, you snag the stupid copy of Doom III.

>enter boat
 You know from experience that trying to get in the boat while holding
 something is a bad idea. You don't want to risk falling into the creek.

>put game in boat
 You unceremoniously throw the stupid copy of Doom III into the stupid
 boat.

>get in boat
 There's not enough room left in the stupid boat for you to get in.

>get game. drop it. enter boat. row boat
 Sighing heavily, you grab the stupid copy of Doom III.

 You ditch the copy of Doom III.

 You get into the stupid rowboat.

 In the stupid rowboat you can see some fake designer Italian shoes.

 You row the boat across to the other shore, griping to yourself the
 whole way about how ridiculously unfair life is.

>get out. get shoes. drop shoes.
 You get out of the stupid rowboat.

 Stupid West Bank
 You've made it to this side. Now to get everything else across.

 The stupid rowboat sits here stupidly. The stupid fake designer Italian
 shoes are in the bottom of the stupid boat.

 Tim plays his stupid video game thingy stupidly.

 Sighing, you seize the stupid fake designer Italian shoes.

 You toss the stupid fake designer Italian shoes on the ground.

>get game
 "Hey, quit it! I'm fighting a boss!"

 You decide now is not the best time to pick this particular fight so
 you let him keep it.

>get doom
 You can't see any such thing.

>enter boat. row boat. get out. put game in boat.
 You get into the stupid rowboat.

 You row the boat across to the other shore, grousing to yourself the
 whole way about how much your life really and truly sucks.

 Left alone with a present on the western shore of the creek, Tim
 suddenly picks up the fake designer Italian shoes and throws them in
 the water! Oh no! The creek quickly sweeps them downstream. And stupid
 Tim just laughs and laughs as you scream at him.

 When you finally get home much later and try to explain what happened,
 Mom blames you for it, of course. She says you should have kept a
 better eye on stupid evil Tiny Tim since you are supposed to be the
 responsible one. In fact, he isn't even grounded as long as you are.
 Typical.

 You're pretty sure he wants to get home as much as you do-- he's only

 Tim plays his stupid video game thingy, seemingly completely oblivious

 Stupid East Bank
 It's snowing, but the ground is too warm for it to stick.

 You can also see a copy of Doom III here.

 Sighing heavily, you snag the stupid copy of Doom III.

 Stupid West Bank
 You've made it to this side. Now to get everything else across.

 The stupid rowboat sits here stupidly. The stupid copy of Doom III is

 There's not enough room left in the stupid boat for you to get in.

 A stupid-looking boat with stupid oars to make it go with your stupid

 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit Tiny Tim.

 You row the boat across to the other shore, grousing to yourself the

 You row the boat ashore. Somehow, at long last, by some miracle, you
 managed to get the stupid presents and your stupid brother across the
 creek in one piece. If anyone's going to ruin Christmas this year it
 won't be you.

 When Christmas morning does eventually roll around, you roll your eyes
 as your younger siblings and cousins tear eagerly into their presents.
 You are so over this. But when it comes time for you to open your
 present, you are surprised and delighted to find...



     *** You got a spa treatment and tanning session for Christmas!
 Love, Mom. ***

 Stupid Mom made you take your stupid little brother to town for stupid
 Christmas shopping in the freezing cold. And now you have to cross this
 stupid freezing-cold creek in a stupid boat to get back home.

 Stupid Creek. Stupid Christmas.
 A Christmas puzzle by Troy Jones III
 Release 1 / Serial number 111225 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 East Bank of the Creek
 It's starting to snow, but the ground is too warm for it to stick.

 The stupid rowboat sits here on the shore.

 Tim plays his stupid video game thingy, seemingly completely oblivious
 to everything.

>sing
 You sing a few lines from the latest Justin Bieber hit, since he's
 simply the greatest talent who's ever lived. Ever.

 Tim makes disgusted choking sounds.

>dance
 You bust out some fly moves you saw in the latest Justin Bieber video.
 You heart Justin! Sometimes you feel as though he's the only light in
 this stupid world.

 Tim turns his back to avoid seeing you in his peripheral vision.

>xyzzy
 Magic words are for stupid "LIGHTNING BOLT" nerds.

>pray
 You close your eyes and bow your head. "Dear Lord, please help me to
 not ruin Christmas again this year. Please. In Jesus' name, amen," you
 pray.

 Tim looks up from his video game. "Really? Seriously? That just
 happened," he says sarcastically.

 "You shut up!" you snap.

>plugh
 Magic words are for stupid "LIGHTNING BOLT" nerds.

>hit tim
 Better not. Mom says if you bring him home with a black eye again,
 you'll be grounded literally forever.

>lightning bolt
 (Tiny Tim)
 You pull off a mitten and rub your sweater vigorously, building up a
 good static charge. Then when he least suspects it, you reach out and
 touch Tim on the neck. Bzzt!

 "LIGHTNING BOLT!" you call.

 He flinches away. "Ow! Quit it, Triniti! You almost made me die!" He
 resumes playing his video game while you snicker.

>plover
 Magic words are for stupid "LIGHTNING BOLT" nerds.

>kiss tim
 Ugh. How about NO.

>examine stupid
 Which do you mean, stupid dead grass, stupid snow, the stupid creek,
 the stupid rowboat, the stupid oars, Tiny Tim, Tim's stupid handheld
 video game player thingy, the copy of Doom III, or the fake designer
 Italian shoes?

>grass
 Lots of dead grass. Who cares.

>push tim
 That would be less than courteous.

>throw shoes at tim
 Good plan. The fake designer Italian shoes soar gracefully through the
 air after leaving your mittened hand and bounce off Tim's forearm. "Ow!
 Hey! Knock it off, Triniti!" he whines.

>throw doom at tim
 Good plan. The copy of Doom III sails majestically through the air
 after leaving your mittened hand and bounces off Tim's forearm. "Ow!
 Hey! Quit it, Triniti!" he whines.

>dive
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine me
 You're wearing a long chartreuse sweater, black wool leggings, adorable
 white fluffy earmuffs, white mittens, and a pair of uggs. You hate how
 stupidly pale you look in the winter-- if Mom weren't so cruel and
 hearltess, she'd bring you with her to the spa and let you spend some
 quality time in a tanning bed.

>enter creek
 It's just the stupid creek.

>swim
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>give game to tim
 (the copy of Doom III to Tiny Tim)
 (first taking the copy of Doom III)
 Sighing, you snatch up the stupid copy of Doom III.

 Tim can't be trusted with the presents. He's EVIL.

>play DoomIII
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>play doom
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>open doom
 That's not something you can open.

>smash doom iii
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>examine doom
 Some stupid video game or some junk. Your stupid older brother wants it
 for Christmas.

>examine shoes
 Mom wants these stupid knock-offs for Christmas for some reason, which
 were NOT in fact designed by Italians.

>tim, wear shoes
 (Tiny Tim first taking the fake designer Italian shoes)
 "Get the stupid thing yourself. Can't you see I'm busy?" he says.

 You growl wordlessly under your breath.

>quit
 Are you sure you want to quit?

 Dash Slapney, Patrol Leader
 An Interactive Fiction by Andrew
 Release 1 / Serial number 111230 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Man! You forgot about the Klondike Derby today! Your father banged on
 the door to get you up. There was a bunch of stuff you meant to study
 and pick up, but it's all helter-skelter now. Your Senior Patrol Leader
 also dropped some stuff off, too. Something about learning to get by,
 and it's not really cheating but memory aides. All the same, if you do
 too much of it, you'll get caught. He also explains that a leader
 prepares stuff beforehand and pretty much can just WAIT and bark out
 orders once it's all set.

 You just showered, and now you only have a bit of time to grab stuff.
 Your SPL reckoned that you could win four of seven events in the
 Klondike Derby and slip by. Any more might be suspicious. Nothing
 against your leadership skills--just, your patrol's too young, and,
 well, brains-over-brawn.

 Your Bedroom
 It's kind of messy here. You probably don't want to look much at your
 desk or your bed. You probably should just grab what you can and get
 going before going outside.

 You can see a roll call list, a Klondike Derby Itinerary, a bag of
 candy wrappers, a pocket trigonometric calculator, a can of Blue River
 soda (closed), a first aid cheat sheet, a small string of knots, a
 lashings log, and a techno wheels kit here.

>examine desk
 Nothing fancy to do here--just take stuff and get out.

>examine bed
 Nothing fancy to do here--just take stuff and get out.

>get all
 A good scout doesn't bite off more than he can chew. One thing at a
 time!

>take all
 A good scout doesn't bite off more than he can chew. One thing at a
 time!

>list
 Nothing fancy to do here--just take stuff and get out.

>examine derby
 You glance over it for a refresher of the tasks you'll be doing.
 Thankfully there's nothing like building a big ol' pinata a bear can't
 reach overnight, or having to haul a fellow patrol member around.

 1 - trashpicking
 2 - Orienteering
 3 - Firestarting
 4 - First Aid Knowledge
 5 - Knot Tying
 6 - Rope Lashing
 7 - Sledding

>get list
 You don't need it. But you glance over it to remember who's who.

 It's enough to remember your patrol members: Timmy Tines, the eighth
 grader in Trigonometry. Ted Banning, the science whiz who doesn't just
 get good grades but makes gadgets. Mikey Mims, annoying know it all--so
 annoying, people don't want to seem like they know less than he does.
 Fatty Potter, well, he's not good for much. He eats a lot, you guess.

 There's a distinct lack of applied life skills here, but that just
 makes you plucky underdogs.

>get bag
 Taken.

>examine bag
 It's a mess of second-rate candies partially ashamed of their wrappers.
 You got rid of the good stuff months ago, and the selection of weird
 hard candies and root beer barrels wasn't all that bad. Still, it's a
 mess...but wait, there're a few random ones left.

>get knots
 Taken.

>get cheat sheet
 Taken.

>examine sheet
 It's got all the points of what to do to rescue people if things go
 wrong in the wilderness, which you're determined never to get close to
 once you leave Boy Scouts. It's terribly common-sensical when you're
 reading it but easy to forget once you're not. Still, you can remember
 everything for about two hours after, and it's also handily rippable so
 you can destroy the evidence, so to speak. And even if you don't
 remember, a gung-ho junior patrol member should be able to--or to
 embarrass you into remembering it.

>get sheet
 You already have that.

>get log
 Taken.

 You've got as much as you need, now.

 You hope what you've got can win enough events. You stumble out to the
 assistant scoutmaster's van, and after a five-minute drive where
 everyone's subject to his harangue you heard before, you're dropped off
 at the pickup area. Your Klondike Derby sled is there and packed--it'll
 pass inspection. That's more due to your Senior Patrol Leader than you,
 but what the hey.

 Registration Area
 A big BE PREPARED sign hovers in the large three-quarters log cabin
 where troops must register. It seems like a pretty serious hint to hand
 out assignments before you get going. There may not be time when you
 are on the trail.

>look
 Registration Area
 There's not much to do here except register, if that big REGISTER sign
 next to the BE PREPARED sign means anything. Well, you could wait
 around until a scoutmaster horse collars you and makes you register.

 You can see Ted Banning, Fatty Potter, Mikey Mims, and Timmy Tines
 here.

>examine ted
 Surly, with a touch of acne...he's rather skinny but the puffy coat
 he's wearing hides that.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a lashings log
   a first aid cheat sheet
   a small string of knots
   a bag of candy wrappers
   a warm coat (being worn)
   your scout uniform (being worn)

>give log to ted
 "Whoah. That's something I've always been a little confused about."

>give wrappers to potter
 "Whoah! Candy! Sucky candy but I could eat about anything right now."
 He can, and he does, before thoughtlessly tossing the mass of plastic
 on the ground. "Say! I got an idea! I--I didn't mean to do this, but
 it's litter now."

>potter, pick up wrappers
 There is no reply.

>examine log
 It's a log, foot long and three inches thick, with the various lashings
 on it. They look simpler than knots, but the effort in cinching them
 makes you lose your stream of thought. Might get the lashings confused
 with the knots, though.

>give log to timmy
 "Whoah. That's something I've always been a little confused about."

>give log to mims
 He looks at it, nods, and finds about ten different ways to say "of
 course," none particularly pleasant. Then he finds ten different ways
 to show everyone why things should work--he divides up the tasks, a
 couple hitches per person, and you're surprised how quick it all is.
 You think you delegated effectively. Mikey slips the log inside his
 coat (weird pockets there) so nobody accuses anyone of cheating.

>look
 Registration Area
 There's not much to do here except register, if that big REGISTER sign
 next to the BE PREPARED sign means anything. Well, you could wait
 around until a scoutmaster horse collars you and makes you register.

 You can see Ted Banning, Fatty Potter, Mikey Mims, and Timmy Tines
 here.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a first aid cheat sheet
   a small string of knots
   a warm coat (being worn)
   your scout uniform (being worn)

>give knots to ted
 Ted Banning doesn't seem interested.

>sing
 Your singing is abominable.

>give knots to timmy
 Timmy Tines doesn't seem interested.

>give cheat sheet to ted
 Ted Banning studies the cheat sheet and starts convincing the rest of
 your patrol that you'd have to be dumb not to figure this out quickly.
 He's surprisingly persuasive, and motivated by not wanting to get left
 behind, you go along too. You've been shown it all before, and you're
 not liable to forget it, and you think you can remember to be decisive
 and all that. Ted disposes of the cheat sheet--won't do to get caught
 with it.

>doff uniform
 You'll have to wear it til the Klondike Derby ends.

>give uniform to timmy
 (first taking your scout uniform off)
 You'll have to wear it til the Klondike Derby ends.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a small string of knots
   a warm coat (being worn)
   your scout uniform (being worn)

>give coat to timmy
 (first taking the warm coat off)
 You shoulda put in on just before leaving, yeah, but you didn't. Enough
 time wasted already.

>examine timmy
 He only failed to skip a grade because he was born at the tail-end of
 acceptance to kindergarten, so he's the shortest kid here. You wonder
 what he's doing in scouts, or why. You remember an argument he had with
 his mother about getting Eagle Scout the summer before college. He's
 wearing a wool hat with a "MATH" patch shaped like the "LOVE"
 sculpture.

>give string to timmy
 Timmy Tines doesn't seem interested.

>give knots to potter
 Fatty Potter doesn't seem interested.

>examine knots
 They're all the knots you need to know, and sensibly organized, too.
 But it's still quite possible to mess them up without a refresher.
 Knots are weird. There're only so many ways rope can go over itself and
 back, so you should be able to remember them, but there're even more
 granny knots.

>give plastic to timmy
 Actually, you don't need to do much more than sit and wait. No need for
 fancy stuff. Maybe give patrol members items they might find useful.

>give knots to everyone
 Actually, you don't need to do much more than sit and wait. No need for
 fancy stuff. Maybe give patrol members items they might find useful.

>sit
 What do you want to sit on?

>examine me
 You're wearing your scout uniform and a warm coat over that.

>xyzzy
 There's no magic in Scouting, Dash. If you wanted to fear the cold,
 stay indoors and play a computer game, you made the wrong choice.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a small string of knots
   a warm coat (being worn)
   your scout uniform (being worn)

 here.

>register
 "Inspection time!"
 The scout leader inspects your sled and gives it the thumbs-up. He
 explains that you will be competing against the Beastie Boys, WWF,
 Camel and Ninja Turtles patrols. You won't know what order your events
 are in 'til you get there. A scout needs to be prepared for this sort
 of thing.

 Litterbug Meadow
 This meadow lives up to its name. You were assigned this at random,
 while other patrols got Trash Trail, Cluttered Creek and Junk Gully.
 Hope you can pick up trash.

>get trash
 Actually, you don't need to do much more than sit and wait. No need for
 fancy stuff. Maybe give patrol members items they might find useful.

>sit
 What do you want to sit on?

>ground
 Actually, you don't need to do much more than sit and wait. No need for
 fancy stuff. Maybe give patrol members items they might find useful.

>wait
 Your patrol starts combing through Litterbug Meadow. You don't dump the
 candy wrappers in your trash sack all at once, of course. In fact, you
 have Fatty split them up so everyone gets some candy wrappers. It's
 enough to put you over the top.

 An Interactive Fiction by Andrew

 6/12N)

 Man! You forgot about the Klondike Derby today! Your father banged on
 the door to get you up. There was a bunch of stuff you meant to study

 also dropped some stuff off, too. Something about learning to get by,
 and it's not really cheating but memory aides. All the same, if you do
 too much of it, you'll get caught. He also explains that a leader
 prepares stuff beforehand and pretty much can just WAIT and bark out

 You just showered, and now you only have a bit of time to grab stuff.
 Your SPL reckoned that you could win four of seven events in the
 Klondike Derby and slip by. Any more might be suspicious. Nothing
 against your leadership skills--just, your patrol's too young, and,
 well, brains-over-brawn.

 Your Bedroom
 It's kind of messy here. You probably don't want to look much at your
 desk or your bed. You probably should just grab what you can and get
 going before going outside.

 You can see a roll call list, a Klondike Derby Itinerary, a bag of
 candy wrappers, a pocket trigonometric calculator, a can of Blue River
 soda (closed), a first aid cheat sheet, a small string of knots, a
 lashings log, and a techno wheels kit here.

>get wheels
 Taken.

>examine soda
 It advertises the cleanliness of Blue River, wherever that is, in a
 blue raspberry-flavored concoction which can't be natural. You bought a
 six-pack a month ago, at a huge discount. You couldn't stomach this
 last one, but it's still shiny and polished. You look at the bottom of
 the can for an expiration date, and somehow, a reflection of the
 sunlight from the window hits you in the eyes. At least it wasn't
 concentrated in one place.

>examine wheels
 You got this for Christmas last year from your grandparents but never
 used it. It has a bunch of parts you don't understand how they fit
 together, and you suspect you never will.

>get wrappers
 Taken.

>get calculator
 Taken.

>get cheat sheet
 Taken.

 You've got as much as you need, now.

 You hope what you've got can win enough events. You stumble out to the

 Strawy Field
 Bleah. There's been no snow, so there're still smashed stalks of straw
 that didn't get cleared for the summer harvest. But actually, that
 might be a break--you'd have stood no chance if it was about pushing

 He only failed to skip a grade because he was born at the tail-end of

 his mother about getting Eagle Scout the summer before college. He's
 wearing a wool hat with a "MATH" patch shaped like the "LOVE"
 sculpture.

>give calculator to timmy
 "Hey! Yeah! That's a lot easier than using a fiddly old compass and
 whatnot!" Timmy snatches the calculator and begins to tap away, given
 the instructions and rotations and so forth. He coordinates it to the
 map and it's pretty clear about where you'll wind up, where you're
 going, and so forth. Timmy obviously needs to keep the calculator so
 there's no way you can lose.

 Timmy's worked it all out. You know where to go, and when you're off a

 a snap. Full points for the Smurf patrol!

 It's got all the points of what to do to rescue people if things go
 wrong in the wilderness, which you're determined never to get close to
 once you leave Boy Scouts. It's terribly common-sensical when you're
 reading it but easy to forget once you're not. Still, you can remember
 everything for about two hours after, and it's also handily rippable so
 you can destroy the evidence, so to speak. And even if you don't
 remember, a gung-ho junior patrol member should be able to--or to
 embarrass you into remembering it.

 Dash Slapney, Patrol Leader
 An Interactive Fiction by Andrew
 Release 1 / Serial number 111230 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Man! You forgot about the Klondike Derby today! Your father banged on
 the door to get you up. There was a bunch of stuff you meant to study
 and pick up, but it's all helter-skelter now. Your Senior Patrol Leader
 also dropped some stuff off, too. Something about learning to get by,
 and it's not really cheating but memory aides. All the same, if you do
 too much of it, you'll get caught. He also explains that a leader
 prepares stuff beforehand and pretty much can just WAIT and bark out
 orders once it's all set.

 You just showered, and now you only have a bit of time to grab stuff.
 Your SPL reckoned that you could win four of seven events in the
 Klondike Derby and slip by. Any more might be suspicious. Nothing
 against your leadership skills--just, your patrol's too young, and,
 well, brains-over-brawn.

 Your Bedroom
 It's kind of messy here. You probably don't want to look much at your
 desk or your bed. You probably should just grab what you can and get
 going before going outside.

 You can see a roll call list, a Klondike Derby Itinerary, a bag of
 candy wrappers, a pocket trigonometric calculator, a can of Blue River
 soda (closed), a first aid cheat sheet, a small string of knots, a
 lashings log, and a techno wheels kit here.

>get aid sheet and calculator and can and wrappers
 first aid cheat sheet: Taken.

 pocket trigonometric calculator: Taken.

 can of Blue River soda: Taken.

 bag of candy wrappers: Taken.

 You've got as much as you need, now.

 You hope what you've got can win enough events. You stumble out to the
 assistant scoutmaster's van, and after a five-minute drive where
 everyone's subject to his harangue you heard before, you're dropped off
 at the pickup area. Your Klondike Derby sled is there and packed--it'll
 pass inspection. That's more due to your Senior Patrol Leader than you,
 but what the hey.

 Registration Area
 A big BE PREPARED sign hovers in the large three-quarters log cabin
 where troops must register. It seems like a pretty serious hint to hand
 out assignments before you get going. There may not be time when you
 are on the trail.

>give wrappers to potter
 "Whoah! Candy! Sucky candy but I could eat about anything right now."
 He can, and he does, before thoughtlessly tossing the mass of plastic
 on the ground. "Say! I got an idea! I--I didn't mean to do this, but
 it's litter now."

>open can
 Nah, it's too nasty. The rest of the six-pack was enough.

>give sheet to ted
 Ted Banning studies the cheat sheet and starts convincing the rest of
 your patrol that you'd have to be dumb not to figure this out quickly.
 He's surprisingly persuasive, and motivated by not wanting to get left
 behind, you go along too. You've been shown it all before, and you're
 not liable to forget it, and you think you can remember to be decisive
 and all that. Ted disposes of the cheat sheet--won't do to get caught
 with it.

>give can to potter
 "Oh, man! Haven't had one of these for a while." He guzzles it down and
 wipes his mouth. Then he hands you back the empty can. Well, at least
 it won't get confiscated as outside food, now.

>give can to mims
 "No way, Dash! That's disgusting. Even Fatty might not drink it."

>examine can
 It advertises the cleanliness of Blue River, wherever that is, in a
 blue raspberry-flavored concoction which can't be natural. You bought a
 six-pack a month ago, at a huge discount. You couldn't stomach this
 last one, but it's still shiny and polished. You look at the bottom of
 the can for an expiration date, and somehow, a reflection of the
 sunlight from the window hits you in the eyes. At least it wasn't
 concentrated in one place.

 You're not sure what Ted did with the wheels, and you're not sure if
 it's legal for the competition or in general. But ot works. The wheels
 seem to cut through the solid ground, and the sled darned near to
 hydroplanes to victory. The big kids can't believe it!

 Timmy knows what he's doing. He takes the empty can of Blue River soda
 and focuses it on the kindling, which erupts in flame. You're able to
 stoke it to get it going, and you wind up boiling the water you need to
 pretty quickly.

 You've made it to the end of the Klondike Derby and won 4 events!

 Congratulations! You managed to squeeze out a victory. It would've been
 suspicious if you'd have won five events, but now, the other patrols
 are squabbling over what they could've done better and how on earth
 they could've lost to a bunch of dorks.

 Still, you shudder to think how you'd have done in the advanced
 division, where you have to do stuff like build suspensions that bears
 can't reach or transport "injured" patrol members or even do those
 tasks that require communication. Whew.

 Of course, it's the fear of this sort of thing (and the merit badges
 that require swimming) that stall your progress to Eagle Scout. But you
 did learn some valuable lessons about how random items can help you
 solve weird puzzles. Maybe it'll come in handy later.
