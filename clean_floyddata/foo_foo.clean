           Little bunny Foo Foo went hopping through the forest,
           scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head.
           Down came the good fairy, and she said,
           "Little bunny Foo Foo, I don't want to see you
           scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head.
           I'll give you one more chance, or I'll turn you into a
 goon!"

 A tremendous pounding disturbs you from your slumber. For the love of
 Gaia. How much did you drink last night?

 You piece the evening back together. A late day at work, a rainy
 commute, ramen for dinner, a plotless bodice-ripper for dessert. You
 were too long between the steamy parts when you fell asleep.

 So, nothing. Not even the usual two-count of mint schnapps in your
 tea.

 Knock. Knock. Knock.

 Oh. It's the front door.


 Studio Apartment
 You climb out of bed into your own little slice of heaven. Maybe
 someday you'll get out of here.

 The rain is heavy against the window.

 rabbit shivers on the other side.

 Not again.

 "Really, Foo Foo?" You make no attempt to hide your frustration.
 "Couldn't this wait 'til morning?"

 The rabbit hops inside, pushing past your outstretched arm.
 "P-p-p-p-please, Miss Fairy," he begs. "You're my only hope."

 1) "That's Detective Fairy to you."
 2) "Tell me you didn't bop again."
 3) "You're dripping all over my carpet."

 "D-d-d-d-don't turn me in." Foo Foo struggles to hold himself
 together. "It's just like the last time. One minute, I'm hopping down
 Lumpen Lane, and the next, I'm in the Forest, looking down at a..."
 His brittle words crumble into full-fledged sobs.

 You reluctantly hand him a tissue. He blows it to shreds.

 1) "Someone's got to know what happened to you. What we need is a
 witness, and I know just where to look."

 By morning, the summer sun is busy hiding the evidence of the previous
 night's storm. You step through a lingering puddle and over the police
 barricade to where Murphy is waiting.

 "Good, you're here," he says. That's your name. Good Fairy, Senior
 Detective. Though it's good that you're here, too. Makes for awkward
 moments when your arrival is not so good.

 "We got an anonymous tip that Foo Foo's hiding in this part of
 Fieldtown," Murphy continues before popping in a few more sticks of
 chewing gum. He's the kind of rookie who chews more gum than he can
 handle, and no, that's not just an expression. There's way too much
 gum in his mouth right now.

 "Fe schreet'sh a dead end, an fere'sh no way he'sh gettin by me an Big
 Chommy." He pats his magic wand and grins lopsidedly.

 Foo Foo
 An Interactive Fiction by Buster Hudson

 By the Postbox
 Aging rowhouses, broken sidewalk, flickering street lamp. It's Lumpen
 Lane all right. Not much has changed, except maybe that poster. That's
 new.

 A police barricade keeps onlookers out, and more importantly, everyone
 else in. Usually. The road heads east from here.

 Meanwhile, Murphy leans against a public postbox, chewing loudly. You
 know you can open the postbox anytime to bring the investigation to a
 premature close. Nobody at headquarters knows you hid the rabbit, and
 you intend to keep it that way for as long as it takes to prove his
 innocence.

>talk to murphy

 1) "What do we know so far?"
 2) "I'll check in with you later."

 "Anofer field moush wash" He stops to adjust the gum in his mouth and
 keep from drooling.

 "Spit it out, Murphy," you say.

 "I shaid, anofer field moush wash"

 "Sorry, no, I meant the gum. It's impeding your speech." You hold up
 your hand in front of his mouth, and he complies, spitting out an
 obscenely large ball of gum.

 Yikes. You knew this case would get your hands dirty, but this is
 something else. Not wanting to litter, you shove the ball into your
 coat pocket.

 Murphy begins again. "Another field mouse was scooped up from the
 Forest and bopped on the head. Sabado called it in, so you might check
 with him on the details. He owns the bar at the end of the street."

 1) Send him away briefly to check on Foo Foo.
 2) Ask for a hint.
 3) "I'll check in with you later."

 "Good luck catching the perp."

 how to look the part. You keep your midnight blue hair short beneath

 lost weight. You don't remember the last time you checked.

 As for the glass heels, well, they're a reminder of those twee days
 when you flit about granting wishes to sick children. Sometimes, you
 think these shoes are all that's left of the woman you once were.

 Fieldtown'll do that to you.

 let him go with a warning. He claimed he had no memory of bopping
 anyone, and like the do-gooder you are, you believed him.

 The problem is, you staked your reputation on those extra chances, and
 now he's gone and bopped again. The Chief promised the whole affair
 would go away if you make the rabbit a goon* by sundown. But that
 won't have to happen if you can prove his innocence first.

 * Fairies no longer turn criminals into goons as punishment. The
 practice was archaic and, more often than not, counter-productive. Now
 criminals are sensibly put in prison, but the old fairy phrasing
 stuck.

 dramatically as possible.

 "How much longer are you keeping me in there?" he asks between
 exaggerated gasps.

 "Just a little longer. Keep it together."

 Foo Foo exhausts his complaints, and you settle him back into the
 postbox. Just in time too. Murphy walks back around the corner.

 "All clear," he says. "No sign of the rabbit. Need anything else?"

 Fieldtown.

 Outside Get Your Nibbles
 You stroll down the sidewalk past the derelict rowhouses to a small
 joint called Get Your Nibbles. Come to think of it, you've been up
 most of the night. Maybe they serve coffee.

 The entrance is to the north, while the road continues east.

>go north
 No coffee. Should have grabbed a cup of the slop they call coffee back
 at the station.

 You scope out the joint. If it weren't for the display case of
 whatever they do serve here... possibly mud logs, you'd have mistaken
 this place for a toy store. The walls are painted a cheery yellow and
 lined with shelves full of toys. Cuddly toys.

 Wait a minute. The stuffed rabbits along one of the shelves look
 curiously like Foo Foo. You are about to lean in for a closer look
 when a green fairy appears from behind the counter.

 "Nice shoes, stranger," she says, smirking.

 Holly.

 "I had help picking them out," you say, tipping your hat. Of course
 she's still as good looking as ever. What's it been, ten years since
 you were both on wish duty? Play it cool, Good. Play it cool.

 1) "How you been?"
 2) "So. What kind of tea party you got going on here?"
 3) "I'm looking for a rabbit."

>1

 "This is Fieldtown. You know how it is. I do what I can." She moistens
 her lips. "How about you? I heard you joined the FPD."

 "Keeping tabs on me?" you ask, leaning in closer.

 "As I recall, it used to be the other way around."

 "Times change."

 "Yeah, they do." She looks away at something that isn't you.

 Silence.

 1) "So. What kind of tea party you got going on here?"
 2) "I'm looking for a rabbit."
 3) "I've got work to do."

>1

 She closes her eyes and opens them slowly, like curtains before the
 next big act. "I happen to sell the best nibblets this side of
 Fieldtown." Her smile wavers when your reaction is little more than a
 blank stare, but only for a moment. "Why don't you try a sample? We
 have vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, key lime, mint, and salted
 caramel."

 You look down at the mud logs in the display.

 1) "Are you sure they're edible?"
 2) "I'll try the vanilla."
 3) "I'll try the chocolate."
 4) "I'll try the strawberry."
 5) "I'll try the key lime."
 6) "I'll try the mint."
 7) "I'll try the salted caramel."

>1

 "Nope. They're actually full of poison, and now that you know my
 secret, I'll have to get rid of you too." She wiggles her fingers
 threateningly at you.

 1) "I think I'll pass, but thanks."
 2) "I'll try the vanilla."
 3) "I'll try the chocolate."
 4) "I'll try the strawberry."
 5) "I'll try the key lime."
 6) "I'll try the mint."
 7) "I'll try the salted caramel."

>6

 Holly snaps on some gloves and reaches beneath the counter. She breaks
 off the corner of a mud log, which she hands to you. It can't be as
 bad as it looks, right?

 (Press any key for regret.)

 Wow, that was revolting. Not even a hint of mint, just wheat grass and
 pine nuts and maybe actual mud.

 "What do you think?" she asks.

 1) "It's, uh, I don't think it's my flavor."
 2) "It's pretty bad. Sorry."
 3) "It's great! I'll take one to go."

>3

 She blinks in surprise. "Um, really?"

 You can't hide the truth in your face, and she laughs. "I know, I
 know, they're terrible," she says. "Only field mice actually eat
 nibblets. I don't know why I thought you would like them, but I
 haven't made a single sale this week, and I'm behind on my lease
 payments, and I thought, hey, a girl's got to try."

 "I take it business isn't going well."

 "I shouldn't be bothering you with my problems," she says, shaking her
 head.

 "Please, bother me." You hit her with the puppy dog eyes.

 She groans and playfully shoves your shoulder. "Fine. I gave up
 selling stuffed animals after that mouse opened his felt dinosaur
 store down the street, and I chose nibblets because the neighborhood
 is ninety percent field mice. Or it was a few weeks ago. Where did
 everyone go?" She pauses. "It's like no matter what kind of store I
 open, my business is doomed to fail."

 She looks around, then drops her voice from conversational to
 conspiratorial. "Sometimes, I think the other stores are out to get
 me. They could be part of some kind of animal cult, collaborating for
 their own advantage at the expense of outsiders. I mean, it's
 possible, right?"

 1) "Anything's possible."
 2) "That sounds more like a game about crime."

>2

 "Yeah, it does, doesn't it." She busies herself rubbing a dirty spot
 on the counter.

 "Hey now," you say. "Tell you what. I'll be checking out a few of the
 nearby stores, and I'll let you know if I come across anything
 cult-ish."

 "You don't have to do that."

 "I want to do that."

 She grins. "At least try to find out where all the field mice have
 disappeared to. It'd be nice to have customers again. And as a reward,
 you can have all the free nibblets you want."

 "Gee, thanks," you reply.

 1) "I'm looking for a rabbit."
 2) "I've got work to do."

>1

 She looks it over briefly before returning it to you, shaking her
 head. "Sorry, I haven't seen him. That's Foo Foo, right? I heard what
 happened. It's all over the papers. Those poor, poor mice..."

 "We have reason to believe he's in the area."

 "I'll be sure to let you know if I see him," she says.

 1) "I've got work to do."

>1

 "Sure, okay." As you turn to leave, she grabs your coat. "Hey, look.
 Just... Let's talk again soon, okay?"

 You nod. "I'd like that."

 Inside Get Your Nibbles
 If it weren't for the display case of muddy nibblet things, you'd have
 mistaken this place for a toy store. The walls are painted a cheery
 yellow and lined with shelves full of cuddly toys. The stuffed rabbits
 look curiously like Foo Foo.

 The exit is to the south, and a closed door to the north connects to
 what must be the kitchen.

 Holly smiles at you from behind the counter.

>examine rabbits

>get rabbit

 "Not for sale, Good," Holly warns like a mother with her misbehaving
 toddler.

 You put it back. "I was only admiring how lifelike it is. You were
 always so good with your hands." She turns away, blushing.

>go north
 It's locked.

 "Unless you're in the health department or have a search warrant, you
 can't go in there," Holly says. "I pride myself on a clean kitchen."

 "Are you saying I'm dirty?" you ask, but she only smiles and winks at
 you.

>go south
 Outside Get Your Nibbles
 A small food joint is sandwiched between the derelict rowhouses, its
 entrance to the north. Lumpen Lane runs east and west.

>go east
 Outside Feckless Pawn
 The road passes in front of a pawn shop to the north before curving
 southeast. You stop and stare at the storefront.

 Yep, still a dump.

 One of the first cases you closed as a detective involved busting the
 owner, Domingo, for the distribution of illegal cheeses. The
 Prohibition has lasted nearly a decade now, and most of what your
 department does anymore is take down the budding cheesemongers hoping
 to make a quick dollar.

 You're not looking forward to a reunion with this particular crime
 rat.

>go north
 The dusty shop is chock full of useless junk, or valuable antiques,
 depending on your point of view. Yours is the former.

 Domingo looks up from his book, which he shoves into his desk as you
 approach. "I'd like to say it's good to see you, Good, but we both
 know better. Also, your name is confusing. Have you thought about
 changing it yet?"

 "Have you given up the cheese racket yet?"

 "Ouch. That's a deep cut, Good. Haven't touched the stuff since my
 release. Scout's honor." He holds a few fingers up in the air, then
 draws them across his neck.

 "I don't think that's how" you begin, having been a fairy scout in
 your tender years, but you're swiftly interrupted.

 "I don't care what you think. They didn't come from me, and if you so
 much as lay a blue little finger on me, I'll have my lawyers" Now
 it's your turn to interrupt him.

 "Take it easy, pops. What didn't come from you?"

 "The cheese!" he roars, slamming his fists onto the desk. "That's why
 you're here to arrest me!"

 You are, in fact, not here to arrest him, and your stunned silence is
 the only correcting he seems to need. His snout stretches into a
 nervous smile. "Uh, nice weather we're having, ain't it?"

 1) "Now I've got to ask. What's this about cheese?"
 2) "Have you seen this rabbit?"
 3) "You knew a lot of the local field mice. Know what happened to
 them?"
 4) "I'm going to take a look around."

>1

 Domingo pulls out a rubix cube and works on solving it. "I don't know
 what you're talking about."

 "Enough with the games, Domingo."

 He puts away the cube. "All right. Word on the street is there's a new
 cheesemonger. Calls himself the Verde. How am I supposed take that?
 Me, Domingo Verdeterre! He's rubbing it in my face that I'm out of the
 game. You got to take him down, Good."

 "I'm on a different case."

 "Case, shmase. You bested me. Now you best him. It's only fair."

 "I'll see what I can do."

 1) "Have you seen this rabbit?"
 2) "You knew a lot of the local field mice. Know what happened to
 them?"
 3) "I'm going to take a look around."

>1
 he barely glances at it before throwing it back at you.

 "I don't know what it is with rabbits," he says. "Why they all got to
 look the same? Don't misunderstand me, some of my closest friends are
 rabbits."

 "I'm sure they appreciate your sentiments." He ignores your remark.

 "All I'm saying is I get lots of customers, so I can't give you a
 definitive yes or no at this point in time." Classic Domingo.

 "If you do see him and let us know, the FPD would be very grateful."

 "I got a few parking tickets..."

 "Don't push it."

 He shrugs. "It was worth a shot."

 1) "You knew a lot of the local field mice. Know what happened to
 them?"
 2) "I'm going to take a look around."

>1

 "You on missing persons now too?" he asks.

 "A favor for a friend."

 "Some friend. Look Good, I'll be square with you. I loved the field
 mice, even before I got into cheese. Fun drinking buddies, great for
 local gossip. But most of Fieldtown don't like 'em and don't like
 giving 'em jobs. Maybe they just wised up and got out. Went somewhere
 where good cheese isn't a vice. That's what I hope for 'em anyway."

 You nod your head, having nothing more to add.

 1) "I'm going to take a look around."

>1

 "You break it, you buy it."

 Inside Feckless Pawn
 The dusty shop is chock full of useless junk, or valuable antiques,
 depending on your point of view. Yours is the former, though you never
 know. There could be something of use around here.

 The entrance to the south leads back to the street.

 Domingo eyes you from his desk beneath a portrait of a pirate rat.

>examine portrait
 the appropriate term.

 Domingo catches you looking up at it. "That's my
 great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather Captain Verdeterre.
 Sank every ship he ever sailed and still turned a profit. Now that's
 how you run a business." He salutes the portrait before returning to
 his work.

 one-in-eighteen chance you can do it, I ain't too worried about losing
 it." His smile lingers a little too long.

 store is north. The road in front curves west and southeast.

 of an old, boarded-up rowhouse offers you some relief. The road wraps
 around it to the east.

 Outside Cameracopia
 A small camera shop to the north brings some charm to this part of
 Lumpen Lane. That is, aside from what might be the remains of the
 shop's front door littering the sidewalk. The awning above you reads
 "Finch & Fern's Cameracopia" next to a picture of a cornucopia
 overflowing with various types of cameras and camera accessories.

 The road in front runs east and west.

>go north
 As you enter the shop, your shoe crunches on broken glass. A finch in
 an apron turns from where she's busy sweeping.

 "It's about time," she says with an exasperated chirp. "I called for
 help hours ago!"

 "Sorry," you say. "I'm on a different case."

 "Different case? What could be more important than this?" She points
 to the mess. It's not pretty. Every camera, every shelf, every glass
 case, everything that could be smashed, was. "Go ahead and get
 started, and let me know if you need anything."

 "Listen, uh, Mrs. Finch..." you say.

 She rolls her eyes. "No, honey, I'm Fern. This is Finch." She motions
 to the potted fern on the counter. That's not confusing.

 1) "What happened here?"
 2) "I'm actually looking for a rabbit."
 3) "Rumor has it the field mice are disappearing. You know where they
 went?"
 4) "I'm going to look around."

>1

 "You're the expert," she says, noisily scooping a large piece of glass
 into her dustpan. "Maybe you can tell me."

 Foo.

 She looks at it, confused. "What does that have to do with the ghost?"
 she asks.

 You blink. "What ghost?"

 "The ghost that terrorized us last night!" She flails her wings in the
 air, then stops all at once. Her eyes widen in realization. "You're
 not the exorcist I called for, are you?"

 "No ma'am. Good Fairy, Senior Detective." You flash your FPD badge.

 "Oh, great," she says. You get the feeling she's not that happy about
 it. "Don't think I'm going to stop cleaning so you can do your CSI cop
 thing. This mess will take me all day."

 "I won't get in your way."

 1) "Tell me about this ghost."
 2) "Rumor has it the field mice are disappearing. You know where they
 went?"
 3) "I'm going to look around."

 "A real Jacob Marley if you ask me," Fern says. "Heard its chains
 rattling and rattling, like it was going to rattle the whole building
 down. We were here late, developing film for one of our customers, and
 after destroying our poor shop, it tried to get into our dark room to
 get us! If it wasn't for Finchy scaring it away with that old Edgerton
 flash he was fixing up, I don't know what would have happened to us."

 "Did you see it?" you ask.

 "Only briefly, in the light of the flash. Endless loops of pure white.
 What do you think?"

 "I think you should file a police report."

 Fern frowns. "It won't matter once the exorcist gets here, but you do
 what you want. Finch owns the building, and he's been under a lot of
 pressure to sell. There's a vaguely threatening note about it around
 here somewhere. If we don't get the ghost problem resolved, this might
 be the final nail in the coffin for us."

 1) "Rumor has it the field mice are disappearing. You know where they
 went?"
 2) "I'm going to look around."

 went?"

 "Not a rumor, honey. The mice are getting run out. I'd put my money on
 Sabado, if I had any."

 You arch an eyebrow. "The bar owner? Why?"

 "He doesn't just own the bar. Been buying up all the property on
 Lumpen Lane. Field mice don't have great prospects in general. I'm
 sure they're taking whatever he offers. Our shop might be the last
 building not owned by him."

 Seems you owe Sabado a visit.

 1) "I'm going to look around."

 "You know where to find me. And watch you don't cut yourself on any
 glass while you're poking around," she says before returning to her
 cleaning.

 Inside Cameracopia
 You'd say the store was trying to convey church basement-chic, except
 it looks like a tornado went through it. There's broken glass and
 camera parts and debris everywhere. Someone, or something, wasn't
 happy.

 To the east is a closed door. The way out is south.

 Fern is busy sweeping up broken glass. Finch is sitting quietly on the
 counter nearby.

 Fern says.

 surrounding the space with a jurassic menagerie. The walls are covered
 with shelves upon shelves of felt dinosaurs. Incredibly, you can't
 find any two that look exactly alike. No wonder Holly's stuffed animal
 shop went under.

 A blue curtain has been hung in the rear of the shop to resemble a
 waterfall. Lumpen Lane is back to the south.

 The fellow must be off. You clear your throat.

 "Trex, I presume?" you ask.

 He twitches and blinks several times, as if waking from a daydream.
 "Oh, hello," he says. "Sorry. I haven't been myself lately. Did you
 want to buy a dinosaur?"

 You shake your head and pull out your badge. "Good Fairy, FPD."

 1) "Have you seen this rabbit?"
 2) "A lot of the other field mice from the neighborhood have gone
 missing. Know anything about it?"

 looks it over intensely.

 "Yes, I do believe so," he says, handing it back.

 "Can you be more specific?"

 Trex rubs his paws together nervously. "Oh dear. It was last night
 just after sundown. I was closing my shop, and I could see him through
 the window talking with someone, but I couldn't see who. I'm not in
 trouble, am I?"

 "Not unless you're withholding any information. Did you hear the
 conversation?"

 Trex shakes his head. "No, I was too far away." He smiles with a
 sudden thought. "My dinosaurs would have. Doohickey was in the window
 all night." He points to the red dinosaur on the workbench.

 Great.

 1) "A lot of the other field mice from the neighborhood have gone
 missing. Know anything about it?"
 2) "I'll show myself out."

 missing. Know anything about it?"

 Trex looks around and bites his paws. "No, ah, no. I don't really know
 the neighbors too well."

 "You're not from here?"

 "I was born in Fieldtown, but my parents carted us kids off to live
 among the humans when I was young. They believed it'd be easier to
 feed us stealing scraps off the kitchen floor than begging for scraps
 on the street corner. We lucked out and ended up with a nice guy who
 happened to keep a filthy kitchen and no cat. He sewed felt dinosaurs
 for a living."

 "Like the dinosaurs you make?"

 "Yes, exactly. I learned by watching him over the years. Except he had
 magic, which is rare for a human. He could bring them to life. I can't
 do anything like that." He looks longingly at the dinosaur on the
 workbench. "If only I could bring my Doohickey to life, even for one
 day."

 1) "I have an idea that'll help us both."
 2) "I'll show myself out."

>1
 wish fairy. No funny remarks, all right? I get enough lip from
 everyone at heaquarters about it already." You point a very
 intimidating index finger, and he swallows hard and nods many times.
 "So I worked with a partner, and one of our specialties was bringing
 toys and stuffed animals to life. It's not permanent, mind you. But
 maybe your Doohickey here can be a witness in my case."

 The mouse claps his paws together. "I like that idea. What do you need
 me to do?"

 "Nothing at the moment. First I need some wish powder and a wand."

 "I don't have any of those things," he says.

 "Don't worry about it. I'll be back with what I need." Of course, you
 haven't had any wish powder in ages, and your wand is in the shop
 thanks to that incident with the frog in the sewers. Still, you're
 determined to think of something. You need that witness.

 East End of Lumpen Lane
 The road ends at a tavern to the east, its facade a collage of tree
 trunks, branches, and leaves. The sign above the open entrance says
 "The Forest".

 An alley disappears behind the rowhouses to the north.

>go east
 Your first few steps into the dimly-lit space sink into dirt. And here
 you are wearing your nice heels.

 Turns out the floor is completely hidden beneath a layer of dark soil,
 who knows how deep, giving the air a damp and loamy odor. Above you,
 the ceiling is a canopy of intertwined branches and dead leaves. The
 columns supporting the roof are thick, bark-covered trunks. The
 Forestthey weren't kidding.

 The barkeep looks up from where he's stacking glasses behind the bar.
 "We're closed a few more hours," he grunts. "Even the earliest drunks
 don't get here until noon." He sounds like the kind of guy angry with
 the world for no good reason.

 "Good Fairy, FPD," you say, holding up your badge. "I'm only here for
 answers."

 "Sabado," he replies. "Make it quick. I already told you guys
 everything I know."

 1) "I'm looking for a rabbit."
 2) "I've heard the local field mice have been vanishing."
 3) "I'll leave you alone now."

 Sabado looks at the photo and scrunches his face like he bit into
 something sour. "Yeah, that's Foo Foo. I'm the one who reported him
 last night. The maroon came into my bar and bopped one of my customers
 on the head. Hard enough doing business without renegade rabbits
 scaring away my customers. So you going to do your job and find him?"

 "One way or another."

 "Well he's not here. Do me a favor, would you? If you catch him, bring
 him to me first. Would love to give him a taste of his own medicine."
 He winks at you in precisely the way you hate being winked at.

 1) "I've heard the local field mice have been vanishing."
 2) "I'll leave you alone now."

 "Of course they've been vanishing," Sabado says. "It's that Gaiadamned
 Foo Foo. Bopped field mice three times already. Three times! No wonder
 they've all left town. Nobody in their right mind wants to sit around
 waiting to get bopped on the head."

 1) "A little birdie told me you're buying up all of Lumpen Lane. Might
 not be Foo Foo chasing the field mice away after all."
 2) "I'll leave you alone now."

 not be Foo Foo chasing the field mice away after all."

 Sabado shrugs. "So what if I am? What happens to the mice ain't my
 problem."

 "What happens to your customers should be your problem."

 "The whole plan's been approved by the City Commission. Who, I might
 add, were thrilled to have this dump of a street made respectable. So
 unless my legal financial transactions have become police business,
 I'm done with this line of questioning."

 So much for that approach.

 "Come back when we're open."

 The Forest
 The corner tavern resembles an old forest more than a bar. Even the
 ground is covered in a thick layer of soil. The western exit leads
 back to the street, while a closed door to the north behind the bar
 reads "Employees Only". A lit-up jukebox looks rather out of place in

 A shovel leans against one of the walls.

 in his arms. "Doohickey, my friend. You're alive! How do you feel?"
 Doohickey wags his tail and barks.

 Well, crap. So much for having a witness.

 "It takes a lot of skill to get them to talk," you say. "I'm what you
 might call out of practice."

 Trex wipes the mist from his eyes. "It's okay. We can still be good
 friends anyway." He nuzzles the fidgety dinosaur before handing him to
 you. "A deal's a deal."

 You hold Doohickey up in front of your face and get licked softly and
 dryly, because his tongue is made of felt. "Hey, boy. Can you help me

 "I don't know what you're talking about."

 "I have a witness." You lean on the desk and stare him down, giving
 the words time to sink in. You need him to take the bait.

 "You're lying," he squeaks. His eyes are all pupil. They twitch back
 and forth. So he is involved.

 You lean even closer. "Last night. In front of Dinosaur Island. The
 witness was in the store and heard everything you said." You prod him
 in the chest. "You going to come clean? Or are we doing this the hard
 way?"

 Domingo slowly rises to his feet. "Looks like I've got no other
 choice. Fortunately, my lawyer's arrived just in time."

 You turn to look where Domingo's pointing, and are surprised to see no
 one. While you're distracted, he ducks around you and scrambles out
 the door. For an older rat, he sure can move. You try to give chase,
 but it's difficult to maneuver around the piles of junk in the store,
 especially with your large wings getting in the way. Before you know
 it, he's gone.

 You scold yourself for being so careless. The worst part of it is,
 you've been had by the oldest trick in the book. Maybe Murphy had
 better luck.

 You arrive at the barricade to find Murphy slumped against the wall.
 With a little help, he staggers to his feet.

 "Sorry, Good," he says, brushing himself off. "Domingo came out of
 nowhere. Like a surprise kiss from someone you've only ever considered
 a friend and never sent any signals that indicated otherwise. I mean,
 not that I'd know anything about that. Anyway, what'd you do to piss
 him off?"

 "Faked a witness. Nothing out of the ordinary."

 He unwraps a stick of gum and tosses it into his mouth. "Okay, now
 what? You have enough for a case?"

 "Hindering an investigation and assaulting a police officer. That's a
 month in the slammer, tops."

 "Yeah. Fieldtown." Murphy chuckles.

 1) "Domingo is involved with Foo Foo somehow. What we need is hard
 evidence."
 2) "Before he left, Domingo wanted me to catch a new cheesemonger
 called the Verde. Now I'm wondering why."
 3) "Domingo won't stay gone for long. May take a few days, but we'll
 wrangle a confession out of him."

 "Maybe there's something in his store," Murphy says. "I can get you a
 warrant in a few hours."

 "I don't have a few hours." Now that you think about it, you don't
 need a few hours. "You know Murphy, it's a shame Domingo left in such
 a hurry. He forgot to close up shop."

 Murphy gives you a knowing smile.

 2) Ask for a hint.
 3) "I'll check in with you later."

 Foo Foo responds with a miserable frown. Yep, he's doing fine. You
 close the postbox back up and wait for Murphy.

 "No sign of the rabbit," he says, clearly bothered by this routine.
 "Need anything else?"

 1) Ask for a hint.
 2) "I'll check in with you later."

 money. But who?

 You flip back to the handwriting on the inside cover. Handwriting

 The road from the west ends at The Forest to the east. An alley

 The Forest
 The corner tavern resembles an old forest more than a bar. Even the
 ground is covered in a thick layer of soil. The western exit leads
 back to the street, while a closed door to the north behind the bar
 reads "Employees Only". A lit-up jukebox looks rather out of place in
 the corner.

 Sabado mutters to himself as he wipes down the bar.

 2) "I'll leave you alone now."

 "Oh yeah? Where's your evidence?"

 You wave the hypnotism book around. His smile doesn't budge. "That
 could mean all kinds of things," he says. "Besides, you're still
 missing a motive." He picks some dirt out from beneath his nails. "You
 can't be saying I had my own customers bopped. That'd be bad for
 business."

 "You know what's bad for business? Having all those field mice around
 when you're trying to buy up the street. Bar sales are peanuts
 compared to the money you've got behind you. Enough to pay off all of
 Domingo's debts and then some. So where's it coming from?"

 "You're right," Sabado admits after a brief pause. He hovers close to
 your face, breath like stale beer. "I got a lot of money behind me.
 Probably more than you'll ever see on an FPD salary. Let me guess. You
 have a cozy little studio somewhere. Maybe half your meals are ramen
 noodles. Maybe more. You could have a nicer place, you know. A much

 "Bribery?" The rat feigns disbelief like a debutante clutching her
 pearls. "Now you're just flinging accusations. I conduct all my
 business legally. You should be after the cheesemongers, not me."

 "One investigation at a time. Right now, it's about you making Foo Foo
 bop some mice."

 "Yes. Foo Foo." Sabado wraps his teeth around the rabbit's name. "You
 may or may not have heard about the Verde, but he's the latest in a
 string of wannabe kingpins. Foo Foo's one of his best dealers. The
 buyers call him Little Bunny."

 You pride yourself on your poker face, but this time, you're caught
 off guard. If Foo Foo's a dealer, he has you played.

 Sabado smirks. "Cat got your tongue? I thought you'd have known that
 already, Detective," he says. "My lawyers are holding onto evidence to
 prove Foo Foo's a dirty dealer, should it be necessary. If you put
 Little Bunny on the stand against me, I could easily discredit him."

 Damn. He's got you there. "What do you want, Sabado?"

 "I want you to do your job. Find Foo Foo, put him in prison, and throw
 away the key. Alternatively, you could bring him to me. No harm would
 come to him. I'm just looking for some informationinformation that's
 valuable to me, and could be valuable to you as well. The choice is
 yours." He picks up a glass and rubs off a smudge, as if to say this
 conversation is over.

 spit. You want answers and you want them now.

 "For crying out loud, Foo Foo, this is Fieldtown. We always need the

 Foo Foo insists it's a ploy to wring more information from him all the
 way up to the bar's doorstep. That's when he starts to beg, but by
 then it's too late.

 Sabado joins you by the entrance in better spirits than usual. "Good!
 You brought Foo Foo. How... unexpected, but I'm no less delighted. I
 might even let you stick around if you stopped acting like a man all
 the time. Roughness doesn't suit a lovely creature like yourself."

 You refuse to let him get to you. "Funny, I was about to tell you the
 same thing."

 He snatches the now-frightened rabbit by the ears and drags him toward
 the door marked for employees. "Just keep an eye on the bar for me
 while I'm gone. This shouldn't take long."

 "I don't work for you," you say, but the retort falls flat.

 Sabado stops. He turns his head round, looks you up and down, then
 lifts the rabbit slightly off the ground as if to show you his prize.
 "Don't you?"

 Several hours pass before Sabado returns, tossing the rabbit at your
 feet. "He's all yours, Detective." Foo Foo seems shaken but unharmed.
 He says nothing.

 "What about my" you start, but the rat cuts you off.

 "He had nothing for me, so I have nothing for you."

 That's it then. You put all your chips on black, and got green. Serves
 you right, you suppose. Not much left to do now but bring Foo Foo to
 Murphy.

 The next few months are brutal. You become the subject of a full
 internal review after Foo Foo filed a complaint. The committee
 assigned to your case keeps calling you in for more questions. They
 can't make heads or tails of what you were thinking. You were
 instructed to bring him in, only to hide him in a postbox? Then you
 identified a new suspect, but turned the rabbit over to him instead?
 Sabado never does give you any compensation, but it's not like you
 could have ever held him to it.

 You don't dare step foot onto Lumpen Lane again.



 Studio Apartment
 You finish one of your potboilers and turn out the light. The rain is
 heavy against the window.

 Thoughts creep into your skull and refuse to let you sleep. Thoughts
 about Holly, Foo Foo, Sabado, and the field mice.

 You shake them off. Nothing to worry over at all. You've managed to
 keep your job, and there's always tomorrow to look forward to.

 It's not like you could have made much more of a difference. It's
 fine. Everything ended up fine.

 "I don't know."

 "Don't lie to me, Foo Foo."

 He holds up a paw. "I swear to Gaia, I get the cheese from a dead drop
 in an alley behind a rowhouse."

 "What about the money from the sale? You leave it there too?"

 He looks around nervously. "I give the proceeds to the green fairy who
 runs a nearby food place. Honest."

 No. It can't be.

 Murphy's footsteps approach from around the corner. Without another
 word, you push Foo Foo back into the postbox.

 "Well, there's no fingerprints, unfortunately. Was probably wearing

 mixture of water, wheat, barley, soy, pine nuts, corn starch, and a
 trace amount of mint. Some kind of food product. Not one that I've
 ever seen."

 "Leaves a bad taste in your mouth, actually." He cocks an eyebrow but
 says nothing. Holly has some explaining to do.

 Nearly noon by now. The air isn't circulating so well through the
 store. You loosen your coat.

 Holly is there waiting for you. The ambient light shimmers off her
 greenness. Green. The Verde. "Hey.  You doing okay?"

 1) "You know Foo Foo."

>1

 "What?" She stiffens.

 You move closer. "I said, you know Foo Foo. You knew him all along."

 "I don't know what"

 You point at the toys on the walls. "The mouse down the street makes
 his dinosaurs from his imagination. But you"you point back at
 her"prefer them lifelike. That's why your stuffed rabbits look like
 Foo Foo. He was a regular visitor here. You didn't even realize you
 were modeling your toys after him."

 Silence, prolonged. Holly tiptoes around the counter, adjusts the
 collar of your shirt, gently smooths a wrinkle in your coat. Her
 bottom lip is quivering. She tries to calm it with her teeth, even
 smiles a little. "Please, Good. You've got it all wrong."

 1) "You were worried I'd find out about you, so you sent me after
 Domingo."

>1
 Domingo."

 "Why are you saying these cruel"

 You slam a palm down on the counter. She flinches. "You flew into an
 abandoned rowhouse while I was investigating the other stores, dropped
 a coin you knew I'd pick up, and shot at me to lead me to the bag of
 cheese. Where'd you stash the revolver? Should I search the kitchen?"

 Holly collapses to her knees, hands pressed to her ears, shaking.
 "No... you mustn't..."

 "There was one flaw, Holl. You left a bit of the nibblet on the bag
 you planted. The same nibblet you broke apart to give me a sample. The
 mint-flavored one, remember? You hadn't made a single sale all
 morning."

 She buries herself in her hands.

 "Domingo was a former cheesemonger," you continue. "An easy target.
 Sure, it was a shaky setup at best. But once a criminal, always a
 criminal, am I right? I busted him before, and there was bad blood
 between us. I was bound to pursue him until I stumbled onto something
 new."

 "Please..."

 1) "You're the Verde."

>1

 At this, she reaches up and grabs the bottom of your coat. "No. No I'm
 not." She's still shaking, but more resolute. Her face is wet.

 "The field mice are disappearing," you say. "The cheese business is
 suffering. And your best dealer is scooping up your customers and
 bopping them on the head. Everything's falling apart. Then who shows
 up but me, your old fling. Maybe I can solve your problems. Find the
 mice, throw Foo Foo in prison where he can't do any more harm. Get
 things back to the way they were, get the money flowing again. Sabado
 wants his rent after all."

 She grips your coat more tightly now, her green knuckles white. "Yes,"
 she says, barely above a whisper. "Yes, Sabado wanted his money. I
 sank everything I had into the toy store, and lost it all. His loan
 gave me a new start, but the interest was too high. The Verde offered
 me a way out. She" She stops herself.

 You sink down to the floor beside her. Tension wanes. It hurts that
 you made her cry, hurts real bad. You had to get the truth out of her,
 but you still hate that you did it.

 Her hands are warm under yours. You release them from your coat, one
 finger at a time.

 1) "She?"

>1

 "I can't. I'm sorry." She lifts the corner of her apron and wipes the
 tears from her cheeks, leaving a smudge of brown food product behind.

 You reach out to wipe it away, reaching out like you used to, but that
 was a decade ago, before you knew yourself and what you wanted, what
 you didn't realize you'd miss so much. "You got some mud stuff here,"
 you say.

 She laughs a little. "Mud stuff. Is that what you think of my food?"
 You can only smile. She grabs your hand. "Why did you leave me, Good?
 Where did I do wrong?"

 1) "That time at the holiday party. You and her." An obvious lie.
 2) "I realized I wasn't in love with you." A severing lie.
 3) "There were little things. The little schemes of yours. I left the
 wish squad because of them. I needed space." The truth.

 wish squad because of them. I needed space."

 Holly releases your hand. "I was a different fairy then, did things
 I'm not proud of. But I'd have given you what you needed, if you only
 asked. I'd have done anything for you."

 "I know. We didn't talk. Not like we're talking now."

 She looks into your eyes.

 1) Kiss her.
 2) Let it go.

 your knees. "We had a good time, you and me."

 "Yeah, we did." A break in the conversation. Holly straightens her
 legs and leans against the counter next to you. She's the first to
 speak again. "Listen, Good, you have to believe me. I wasn't ever
 going to shoot you. I couldn't shoot you."

 "I know," you say.

 "I didn't want to do any of it. I had to. She told me to."

 1) "Who told you to?"

>1

 Holly doesn't answer your question. She takes your hand, presses
 something into it. A key. "This'll get you in. You swiped it from me
 when I wasn't looking."

 "Holl"

 She puts a finger on your lips. "Take my revolver. It's under the
 loose tile in the kitchen. You're going to need it."

 Before you can protest, she stands and opens the door to the kitchen.
 You rise to your feet.

 You're surprised to see only a small portion of the space is set aside
 for food preparation. The rest is dedicated to the construction of
 stuffed animals, mid-production, as if operations had never stopped.
 It's likely they didn't.

 A large bucket of wish powder stands in the corner. The tiled floor is
 stained purple where hastily scooped quantities were spilled.

 About a dozen surprised cuddly toys halt their activities to look at
 you. Several of them were pushing a large wheel of cheddar through a
 band saw. Several more were weighing and sorting smaller chunks of
 various cheeses into plastic bags. A zebra in a visor with thick
 spectacles was counting a pile of banknotes.

 You recognize them as the same makes from the shelves in Holly's shop.
 Lions, tigers, and bears, all beautifully crafted, lifelike. Malice
 flashes in their beady plastic eyes.

 They reach into their own stuffing and withdraw a handgun each. They
 start shooting. Bullets fly. You duck behind a nearby dumpster, just
 in time. Their shots impact the wall next to you in scattered puffs of
 cement dust.

 You cock your revolver. This could get ugly.

>shoot band saw

>push dumpster south

>look
 You're taking shelter behind a dumpster in the narrow alley.

 Through the open door to the south, a gang of pistol-wielding cuddly
 toys attempts to pump you full of lead. Not the kind of day you were
 expecting to have.

 You look around for anything that can help. Cheese wheels, stacks of
 cash, a chandelier. You're going to have to improvise.

>examine chandelier

>shoot chandelier
 perfectly, and the entire thing crashes onto the table below. You got
 one, maybe two toys trapped underneath, but the rest keep firing.
 Fortunately, they're terrible shots.

 Think, Good. There's got to be something.

 You take another look. With the chandelier out of the way, you can now
 see the nozzle of an overhead sprinkler jutting out from the ceiling.

>examine sprinkler
 ceiling.

>shoot sprinkler
 nozzle is torn off. Water sprays out over the room, running down the
 walls, covering the cheese. The animals scramble to protect
 themselves, but it's too late. Their wish powder washes off,
 collecting into purple puddles on the floor.

 One by one the animals drop, lifeless. The water decreases to a steady
 stream, and then a slow trickle. Finally, silence, punctuated by the
 occasional drip.

 (Press any key to step inside.)

 Cheese Room
 The room is smaller than it looked through the doorway. You cross it
 swiftly, careful not to touch anything. CSI can handle this mess.

 The inside door is abruptly kicked in. You raise your revolver and
 find a shotgun pointed at your head.

 Fern. She's still wearing her apron. Her eyes shine a brilliant green.

 "Drop your gun," she says.

 "You first, Verde," you reply. "There could still be a ghost around."

 She laughs. "I hope you didn't actually believe that. The last thing I
 wanted was the police sniffing around." She motions for you to put
 your weapon on the table.

 Neither of you move. When she speaks again, her words are marinated in
 irritation. "You should have left it alone."

 1) "Not my fault you're breaking the law."
 2) "Someone needs to keep the cheese off the streets."
 3) "Putting cheesemongers away is my idea of fun."

>2

 "Ha!" Fern chirps mockingly. "Do you really think the Mayor and his
 cronies don't enjoy a plate of cheese with their wine at the end of a
 long day's work? The Prohibition only punishes the lowest among us, by
 design. I'm here to level the field."

 You look over at the piles of cash on the table. "You're a regular
 bleeding heart. Then all this cash must be... what? Appropriate
 compensation? Tell me again who's taking advantage of the lowest among
 us."

 She shakes her head. "I'm going to buy back this street. Make it a
 home for the field mice again. Sabado won't sell, but his backers
 willcapitalists can always be bought if the price is right." She
 tightens her grip on her gun. "I'm going to ask you this once. Are you
 with me, or against me?"

 1) "You made your point, and I hear it." With her.
 2) "I don't make the law. I enforce it." Against her.

>2

 She clicks her tongue disapprovingly. "Then I'm afraid this is where
 we must part. Goodbye, Detective. It's been"

 BONG!

 Holly bops Fern over the head with a frying pan, and the bird crumples
 to the floor in an undignified heap. She must have snuck in through
 the front.

 You look into each other's eyes, seconds stretched to little
 eternities. You want to thank her for saving your life, but the right
 words won't come.

 "I had to know," she says. "When you write your report, are you going
 to turn me in? For my part in all this, I mean."

 1) "I... have to be honest. I'm sorry." Turn her in.
 2) "My report might be missing a few details." Let her off.

>SAVE

 Holly nods, bites her lip, forces a smile. "It's okay. I always
 admired your personal code of honor. I'm... glad I could see you one
 last time." She turns to leave.

 "Holly, wait!" you shout after her, but she's already through the door
 and out onto the street, spreading her wings and taking off. You slow
 once you reach the sidewalk, watching as she disappears into the great
 blue distance.

 You already know you won't see her again. You hope she'll go far away
 from Fieldtown. Maybe she'll find the field mice, find the right woman
 who can make her happy, make a nice life for herself. Maybe you ought
 to do the same thing.

 Not much left to do now except open the postbox and end this.

 "He was in there the whole time?" Murphy exclaims, slapping his
 forehead. "How did you know?"

 "Doesn't matter, he's innocent." You toss Murphy the book. "Check the
 note on the inside cover. Foo Foo was hypnotized."

 Murphy takes a minute to look through the pages. "So it was Domingo
 all along?"

 You shrug. "Sabado, but we'll leave it to the DA to put a case
 together. Even if we catch Domingo, he'd never squeal. At least we can
 spare the innocent party." You both look at the rabbit.

 "Does this mean I'm free to go?" Foo Foo asks.

 You chuckle. "Yes, you're free to go. But if I see you again, it's
 Goontown for you."

 The rabbit thanks you profusely, and waving goodbye, he hops down the
 lane.

 (Press any key to continue.)

 Murphy munches on another stick of gum. "I guess everything turned out
 all right."

 You shake your head. "Have headquarters send the boys over to the
 camera shop. They'll find the latest cheesemonger out cold, along with
 enough cheese and cash to buy the city."

 You've stunned Murphy once again. A notable feat, considering he can
 see shades of the future. "What's happened, Good?"

 "I've had all I can take of Lumpen Lane. You take it from here." Hands
 in pocket, you head home. You want to savor your last memories with
 Holly over a nice glass of mint schnapps.

 They might be all you'll ever have.

 "Oh, Good. You don't know how much this means to me." She bends down
 to check on Fern, make sure she's breathing. "I can't ask you to do
 anything else for me. It wouldn't be right."

 You tighten your jaw. This is the Holly you were trying to forget.
 "What is it Holl?"

 "Well, Fern made my loan payments to Sabado for me, provided I kept up
 a steady supply of cheap labor. But she also had to buy all that wish
 powder, which meant no money for principal until business ramped up.
 If you can find the contract I signed at Sabado's, we can rip it up,
 and I can be free of him forever."

 "To do that, I'd have to find a way inside. He's only interested in
 Foo Foo."

 She smiles prettily. "Maybe you can fool him into thinking you found
 Foo Foo. I don't know, you'll think of something. I can wait for you
 here, and keep on eye on the bird."

 "And if I don't?"

 "Then I'll just have to manage." She picks up the shotgun and finds a
 comfortable spot to sit. "Also, I saw the rat bury a spare key in the
 dirt by the bar. He didn't realize I was spying. You may need to keep
 digging for it."

 Cheese Room
 The room was a distribution center for the Verde's illegal cheese
 ring. Large wheels of cheddar and swiss are stacked in the corner near
 a band saw for slicing. Scale weights, plastic bags, and inventory
 logs are scattered about the large table in the center of the room,
 along with cubes of various cheeses. In one corner is a small table,
 where stacks of cash are arranged into neat piles next to a counting
 machine. Everything is soaking wet.

 appliances. The floor is lost beneath a fairy-inch of standing water,
 either from a burst pipe or a leaky roof.

 A staircase leads up to the bedroom. Daylight leaks through cracks in
 the door to the north.

>go north
 Behind an Abandoned Rowhouse
 A door to the south leads into an abandoned rowhouse. Leaning against
 the house is a dented trashcan. The alley curves northwest and east.

>go west

>go northwest
 Behind Get Your Nibbles
 The alley arrives from the southeast and ends at a wall. There's a
 rear entrance to Get Your Nibbles to the south, the door left open.

>go south
 Kitchen
 Only a small portion of the space is set aside for food preparation.
 The rest is dedicated to the construction of stuffed animals,
 mid-production, as if operations had never stopped.

 A large bucket of wish powder stands in the corner. The tiled floor is
 stained purple where hastily scooped quantities were spilled.

 The retail area is directly south, and the alley is north.

>go south
 Inside Get Your Nibbles
 If it weren't for the display case of muddy nibblet things, you'd have
 mistaken this place for a toy store. The walls are painted a cheery
 yellow and lined with shelves full of cuddly toys. The stuffed rabbits
 look curiously like Foo Foo.

 The exit is to the south, the kitchen to the north.

 "Flippity, floppity, foo," you chant. With a sharp intake of air, the
 stuffed rabbit comes to life. He's disoriented for only a moment
 before he falls in line behind you, wiggling his nose happily.

 Outside Get Your Nibbles
 A small food joint is sandwiched between the derelict rowhouses, its
 entrance to the north. Lumpen Lane runs east and west.

 Outside Feckless Pawn
 You stand outside your least favorite pawn shop. The entrance to the
 store is north. The road in front curves west and southeast.

 Bend In the Road
 The sidewalk wraps around an old rowhouse and continues east. High
 above the boarded-up door is an open window. The rat's pawn shop is
 back to the northwest.

>go east
 Outside Cameracopia
 A small camera shop is open to the north. The road in front runs east
 and west.

>go east
 Outside Dinosaur Island
 A prehistoric window display stands beside the shop's entrance to the
 north. Lumpen Lane continues east and west.

>go east
 East End of Lumpen Lane
 The road from the west ends at The Forest to the east. An alley
 disappears behind the rowhouses to the north.

>go east
 You enter the bar and its earthy smells. A hint of decay clings to the
 air. You wonder what people see in this place.

 Sabado joins you by the entrance in better spirits than usual. "Good!
 You brought Foo Foo. How... unexpected, but I'm no less delighted. I
 might even let you stick around if you stopped acting like a man all
 the time. Roughness doesn't suit a lovely creature like yourself."

 You refuse to let him under your skin. "Funny, I was about to tell you
 the same thing."

 He snatches the now-frightened rabbit by the ears and drags him to the
 area marked for employees. "Just keep an eye on the bar for me while
 I'm gone. This shouldn't take long."

 "I don't work for you," you say, but the retort falls flat.

 Sabado stops. He turns his head round, looks you up and down, then
 lifts the rabbit slightly off the ground as if to show you his prize.
 "Don't you?"

 He leaves through the door and is gone, closing it firmly behind him.

 A thought crosses your mind. You stumble backwards, away from the
 bones. Your stomach turns. These couldn't belong to the field mice,
 could they?

 It's addressed to Sabado Verdeterre and signed by Hannibal Sistrum as
 Executive Vice President of Diamond Inc. You skim through the
 legalese. It announces a Real Estate Investment Trust for the creation
 of Alabaster Estates to be built over the existing Lumpen Lane.
 There's a whole lot of money in it for Sabado, provided he can get
 ownership of the entire street and get rid of the cheese to improve
 the neighborhood's reputation.

 If you can't find the provider, you eliminate the buyers. Perhaps by
 bopping them on the head during a transaction. Proof of a motive,
 though still tenuous at best.

>dig

>look
 The corner tavern resembles an old forest more than a bar. Even the
 ground is covered in a thick layer of soil. The western exit leads
 back to the street, while a closed door to the north behind the bar
 reads "Employees Only". A lit-up jukebox looks rather out of place in
 the corner.

 With Sabado gone, the bar counter stands alone.

 mounted on the wall dances across a stone staircase, spiraling
 downwards. You're reminded of what Holly said earlier about an animal
 cult.

 No. It was a bunch of nonsense. Though you swear you can hear a
 rattling sound, coming from down below.

>go north
 You descend the stairs slowly, making as little noise as possible. The
 rattling sound grows louder. Reaching the bottom, you keep crouched by
 the stairs and glance around the corner.

 The stone archway opens into a large vaulted chamber, barely lit by
 torches on the wall. Across the room, a great white beast twists and
 bucks about wildly, hissing and rattling.

 A rattlesnake. Here, in Fieldtown. You hold your breath.

 Sabado stands close to the snake, chanting in an unknown language. In
 the far corner lies the stuffed rabbit, lifeless once again.

 brick off the wall. It clatters noisily to the floor. Both snake and
 rat turn to look at you.

 Sabado ceases his chanting. "Get the rabbit out of here!" he shouts at
 you. "Get rid of anything with wish powder on it!"

 "Why?" you shout back.

 "Shut up and do it!"

>get rabbit
 You duck as a coil strikes the wall above you, leaving a spider's web
 of cracks behind. The beast could crush you with ease.

 "I can't get to the rabbit!" you shout.

 "I'm doing what I can," Sabado replies. "You have to find a way!"

 How are you going to back the snake away from the rabbit? He's asking
 the impossible.

 of the chamber, but the effect is immediate. The snake recoils into

 Now's your chance.

 The snake resumes thrashing about the chamber, the effects of the
 flash worn off.

 The Forest
 The corner tavern resembles an old forest more than a bar. Even the
 ground is covered in a thick layer of soil. The western exit leads
 back to the street, while the door to the north is open slightly. A
 lit-up jukebox looks rather out of place in the corner.

 With Sabado gone, the bar counter stands alone.

>drop rabbit

>go down
 You return to the chamber at the bottom of the stairs. The snake
 continues a violent dance.

 "I said, get rid of everything with wish powder on it!" Sabado shouts
 before returning to his chant.

>go up

 The corner tavern resembles an old forest more than a bar. Even the

 back to the street, while the door to the north is open slightly. A

 With Sabado gone, the bar counter stands alone.

 You left a stuffed rabbit here.

>go down
 Returning to the subterranean chamber, you find the albino rattlesnake
 now docile, coiled up the corner. Sabado looks worn down, but still
 grumpy. They speak to each other in hushed tones. You hear the words
 "trespassed illegally".

 Sometimes the best defense is a good offense. You work yourself up
 into a mock rage. "Just what in Gaia's name is going on down here?"
 you shout, stomping across the stone floor, waving a fist in the air.

 The snake shrinks away apologetically. Sabado isn't as easily cowed,
 but he decides to play nice. "Detective, I'd like you to meet my
 business associate, Mr. Sistrum. Mr. Sistrum, Detective Good Fairy."

 "Pleassse, call me Hannibal," the snake says. He bows slightly.

 "Forgive me if I forget my manners," you say. "It sometimes happens
 when I'm almost crushed to death."

 "Hannibal suffers from allergies," says Sabado. "His most severe being
 wish powder. Even being in the same room is enough to send him into a
 fit." He thrusts a finger at you. "And it was your dirty,
 powder-covered trick which caused this latest attack."

 Hannibal rests his rattle on the rat's shoulder. "Peace, friend. She
 couldn't have known about my allergy."

 "I want to know why she tried to fool us in the first place," Sabado
 says.

 1) "You didn't give me the impression you weren't going to hurt Foo
 Foo."
 2) "I wanted to find out what you were after."
 3) "I wasn't planning on handing over Foo Foo. I only wanted a way
 in."

>3

 Sabado smirks. "And here you are. With a warrant, I'm sure."

 "We were only trying to determine the identity of the Verde," Hannibal
 cuts in. Sabado throws him a sharp look, but the snake continues. "The
 neighborhood is important to us. We want to help facilitate the
 removal of the cheessse. Surely you want the same."

 1) "All taken care of. Fern is the Verde. She'll be in police custody
 shortly."
 2) "All taken care of. The Verde will be in police custody shortly."
 3) "Not any of my business, actually."

>2

 Both of them look surprised. "Who is it?" Sabado asks.

 "You'll have to read the papers tomorrow to find out," you reply. "Now
 it's my turn for a question." Hannibal inclines his head toward you.
 Sabado crosses his arms and scowls.

 1) "I've heard from several sources that the field mice are vanishing.
 Then I dig up some bones buried upstairs. And now I find there's a
 snake in Fieldtown."

>1
 Then I dig up some bones buried upstairs. And now I find there's a
 snake in Fieldtown."

 Hannibal uncoils and rears his head like a cobra, bares his fangs.
 Maybe he does have a violent side. You feel for the revolver beneath
 your coat.

 "Hannibal is an old friend," Sabado says. Odd that he would cut the
 tension, unless he knows when the snake isn't playing around. "I don't
 appreciate unfounded accusations against friends."

 "Tell me about the bones."

 "Every Tuesday is scavenger night," he says with a resigned huff. "All
 you can eat spare ribs. It's gotten popular." You narrow your eyes,
 and he looks offended. "What? They were dead already. And no, they
 weren't the field mice."

 "Then what happened to the field mice?"

 Now he's angry. "I don't know what you want me to say. They packed up
 and left. Gaia Almighty, all you complainers are looking for some kind
 of big bad villain to blame. Well guess what, there isn't one. Blame
 Fieldtown. Blame everybody. We're all to blame, because we're all
 looking out for numero uno." He raps his chest proudly. "Ourselves.
 You don't like it, go do something about it. Otherwise, shut your
 Gaiadamned mouth."

 Hannibal grins and settles back into his coils. "For the record, I
 strictly eat eggs. Unfertilized ones."

 "Any more questions?" asks Sabado.

 1) "Were you behind the attack at the camera shop last night?"
 2) "What did you do to the rabbit?"
 3) "Let's talk about the contract you have with Holly."
 4) "No more questions."

>3

 The two look at each other. "What contract?" Hannibal asks.

 "The contract in which Sabado lent her a sum of money to rebrand her
 store. There're laws against usury. I'd like to double check the rate.
 Make sure it's all square." You outline a square in the air with your
 finger.

 "Honestly Detective, I have no idea what you're talking about," Sabado
 replies. "I didn't give her no money. In fact, she's all paid up
 through the end of the year. Now I have to figure a way out of our
 lease agreement."

 "You're lying," you say unconvincingly. You both know he was telling
 the truth. So why would she lie about this? A terrible sinking feeling
 settles in your stomach.

 "Whatever," Sabado says, brushing you off.

 1) "Were you behind the attack at the camera shop last night?"
 2) "What did you do to the rabbit?"
 3) "No more questions."

>1

 "I'm afraid I went to speak with the proprietor, to propose a more
 generousss offer, and suffered one of my fits while I was there,"
 Hannibal says.

 "I swear she's up to something," says Sabado.

 You leave that one alone.

 1) "What did you do to the rabbit?"
 2) "No more questions."

>1

 "He fell over as soon as Hannibal's allergies started acting up,"
 Sabado says. "Must have scared him lifeless."

 It's possible. Not something you've ever tested. "You didn't think to
 get him out of here?"

 Sabado talks through gritted teeth. "If you didn't notice, I was
 chanting."

 "It calmsss me down," Hannibal adds. "Another hour, I'd have been fine
 again."

 That's why Sabado had a book on Snake Charming in the first place.
 Though an hour isn't exactly a quick turnaround.

 1) "No more questions."

>1
 those mice bopped."

 Sabado smiles. "If you had enough to arrest me, you'd have done it
 already. Now get the hell out of my bar."

 "It was lovely meeting you," Hannibal says.

 You doff your hat.

 Below the Forest
 The stairway from the south opens to a large vaulted chamber, barely
 lit by torches on the wall.

 Sabado stands with his arms crossed and a terrible pout.

 Hannibal rests in the corner, a pile of white coils, his forked tongue
 taking little tastes of the air.

>examine hannibal
 on his scales. He seems completely at ease with his nakedness, which
 you assume must be a snake thing. You imagine clothes to be difficult
 for snakes.

>go up
 The Forest
 The corner tavern resembles an old forest more than a bar. Even the
 ground is covered in a thick layer of soil. The western exit leads
 back to the street, while the door to the north is open slightly. A
 lit-up jukebox looks rather out of place in the corner.

 With Sabado gone, the bar counter stands alone.

 You left a pouch of wish powder and a stuffed rabbit here.

>go west

 The road from the west ends at The Forest to the east. An alley
 disappears behind the rowhouses to the north.

>go west

 north. Lumpen Lane continues east and west.

>go west
 Outside Cameracopia
 A small camera shop is open to the north. The road in front runs east

>go north
 Inside Cameracopia
 You'd say the store was trying to convey church basement-chic, except
 it looks like a tornado went through it. There's broken glass and
 camera parts and debris everywhere.

 To the east is the cheese room. The way out is south.

 Finch sits quietly on the counter.

>go east
 The room was a distribution center for the Verde's illegal cheese
 ring. Large wheels of cheddar and swiss are stacked in the corner near
 a band saw for slicing. Scale weights, plastic bags, and inventory
 logs are scattered about the large table in the center of the room,
 along with cubes of various cheeses. In one corner is a small table,
 where...

 You look around in disbelief. Holly's gone, along with all the cash.
 Near the counting machine is a piece of paper with a little green
 heart.

 You think back to everything that happened. New possibilities emerge.
 The Verde may not have been one woman, but two, a partnership that
 turned sour. One of them planned to blow all the money on some junk
 real estate for the field mice. The other waited for the right
 opportunity to make a move against her. There's a sucker born every
 day, you guess.

 You pick up the little green heart and crush it between your fingers.

 (Three months later...)

 A tremendous pounding disturbs you from your slumber. For the love of
 Gaia. What now?

 someday you'll get out of here.

 The rain is heavy against the window.

 rabbit shivers on the other side.

 This has got to be one of those recurring nightmares. "I thought I
 told you the next time I saw you, I'd turn you into a goon," you say.

 The rabbit limps inside. "I won't be around that long. Heck, I
 probably won't last the night." He sounds more controlled, more
 confident. He doesn't sound like himself at all.

 "Foo Foo, what's going on?"

 He opens his coat and reveals a tear where his right arm meets his
 shoulder. The ends of the fabric are frayed. Cotton is starting to
 push through.

 He was stuffed all along.

 1) This can't be.

>1

 "Mother was skilled," Foo Foo replies. "More than you realized. She
 worked on me for years. I've been alive for years, while my siblings
 only last days."

 "But you're soaking wet!" You stand over him. Anger swells. Yes, you
 were betrayed. Yes, you were fooled. But surely not to this degree.

 Foo Foo lowers his eyes and sags to the floor. "I have a heart, you
 know. She made one out of red felt and filled it with wish powder.
 Simple, yet effective. Makes you wonder why no one thought of it
 before. Anyway, it's almost all used up."

 1) No. You can't believe it.

 your bed.

 "'Sticks and stone shall be my bones, and words will ever guide me.'
 Mother made that up for me, I think to help me understand what I was.
 She said I learned to talk the fastest out of all her creations. I
 spoke as soon as I was brought to life, repeating the last word of her
 spell over and over again."

 "Flippity, floppity, foo," you whisper.

 He nods. "'Foo! Foo!' I had shouted. I apparently named myself."

 You still have questions.

 1) "How were you even hypnotized?"
 2) "So all those times I gave you extra chances..."
 3) "Why are you here, Foo Foo?"

>1

 "I wasn't, but I had to pretend that I was, otherwise I'd have been
 found out. Questions would have been raised. Mother didn't exactly
 acquire all that wish powder legally."

 Of course she didn't.

 1) "So all those times I gave you extra chances..."
 2) "Why are you here, Foo Foo?"

>1

 Foo Foo finishes your sentence, as much as it pains you to hear it.
 "...was to get you to investigate, without tipping you off. Domingo's
 attempts at hypnotism were the perfect excuse. All you had to do was
 show." He smiles. "You have a good heart, Good. Holly wasn't even
 expecting you to give me so many chances. She admired you for it."

 "Must be why she did what she did," you say sarcastically.

 He doesn't respond.

 1) "Why are you here, Foo Foo?"

>1

 He furrows his brow and presses his lips together. "I loved her, so
 much. I believe she loved me too, even though I was a means to an end.
 But you... she loved you most of all." He climbs onto the bed and sits
 next to you.

 You turn away. "She didn't love me. She ruined me."

 "She never told me why she carried out this last scheme," Foo Foo
 says, "but I think she wanted to become the villain you wanted her to
 be. A reason for the both of you to move on, even after all those
 years. She never saw herself as good enough for you. I suppose she
 never thought she could be a good person."

 "You never answered my question."

 He looks up into your eyes. "Did you love her?"

 1) "Yes."
 2) "No."

>1

 He beams. "That's what I hoped you'd say." He puts his paw on your
 hand. You take it. "Mother used to cuddle with me at night sometimes,
 like I was still a toy. I... wonder if that'd be all right."

 You smile gently. "Sure. It'd be all right."

 You wrap your arms around him and pull him with you onto the bed. He's
 still cold and wet, but you keep him close anyway. It isn't long
 before he's merely warm and damp, and by the time you fall asleep,
 it's hard to tell where the rainwater ends and where the tears begin.



 The morning brings a pale light through the window. You wake feeling
 refreshed, like you finally slept after years of trudging through life
 in a weary haze. In your arms is a lifeless stuffed rabbit.

 He's smiling.
