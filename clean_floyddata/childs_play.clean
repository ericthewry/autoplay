 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Smothered in Darkness
 It is dark and stuffy and you are covered over, something is all draped
 over you, it is enough to make you crazy.

>cry
 Suddenly the darkness is gone, and it is so light, you are blinded for
 just a second. You blink and blink and then you can see the mom holding
 the blanket she was covering you with. "Oh, kid, I'm so sorry, I
 thought you were having fun," she says. "We'll do something else."

 That'll teach her.

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. But it
 would be bigger and vaster if there weren't all these pillows and stuff
 in a big ring around you. The mom is totally all paranoid and whatever,
 she is a new mom.

 There is a red footstool, it looms over you.

 The mom is playing with you and is all excited about it.

 You can also see a squishy ball, a plush book, and your favorite toy
 here.

 You eye your favorite toy and the mom sees you doing it and scoops it
 up. "No, no, we're going to try pulling up!" She is all the time trying
 to build your character or something. She waves the toy at you. "Look!
 Look where I'm putting it!" She drops the toy on the footstool where
 you can't see it unless you're all pulled up, that is just no fair.

>examine mom
 When the mom is all sitting down she does not tower so much over you
 but she is still pretty big.

>get toy
 You can't see any such thing.

>stand up
 You try that standing thing but you are still no good at it without
 holding onto something so you will have to pull up on something to
 stand up.

 The mom sits there looking at you all expectantly.

>pull on stool
 You can't see any such thing.

>pull on footstoll
 You can't see any such thing.

>pull on footstool
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine book
 It is plush and the mom likes to read it to you.

>pull up on footstool
 You pull yourself up and it is one hand and another hand which is hard
 because the footstool is all unstable and rocks some but then you are
 all on your feet so yay you! And now that you are up here you can see
 your favorite toy on the footstool.

 The mom applauds, "Way to go!" She looks at her watch and is all
 "Whoops! Playgroup's about to arrive. You hang out here while mom goes
 and gets ready." She stands up and steps over all of those pillows and
 you are stuck here now by yourself.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>take toy
 You cannot reach your favorite toy because you are standing and if you
 let go with one hand you would just plop down before you could get it.

>push footstool
 You push on the footstool and it rocks and you pull on the footstool
 and it rocks and then you hear stuff fall off it! But the stuff fell
 outside the ring of pillows.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>climb pillows
 You have short arms, you can't reach the ring of pillows from up here.

>get down
 Those pillows are terribly high, you can't really climb over them, and
 they are too big to shove. Stupid small legs. Stupid small body.

>sit down
 You sit down on your diaper and it is good that it is all padded and
 stuff.

>examine diaper
 The diaper covers you and contains any embarassing accidents or
 whatever.

>look in diaper
 That is all you in there.

>smell diaper
 You are baby powder fresh.

>take pillows
 It is true that there are a bunch of individual pillows in the ring of
 pillows but each one is like bigger than you are, so you aren't going
 to be able to take any of them. The mom and the dad must need a lot of
 softness in their lives.

>remove diaper
 (first taking your diaper)
 The diaper is always there, it's not like there's anything you can do
 about it.

>urinate
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>push pillows
 They are so soft and way bigger than you, and you have the proportional
 strength of one baby, so they do not move.

>climb pillows
 You can pull up on stuff and all but you can't do that climbing thing.
 Stupid short stubby legs.

>find irradiated spider
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>enter blender
 You can't see any such thing.

>xyzzy
 Supposedly saying xyzzy will do magical things and whatever, you can't
 talk yet.

>search pillows
 You don't find anything.

 They are all smooshy and that makes them too hard to pull up on.

>look
 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. But it
 would be bigger and vaster if there weren't all these pillows and stuff
 in a big ring around you.

 There is a red footstool, it looms over you.

 You can also see a squishy ball and a plush book here.

>get ball
 You pick it up.

>shake it
 You shake the squishy ball and that is okay I guess.

>squish it
 It is hard enough to pick up things, squeezing is even harder and so
 don't worry about doing it, if it happens it happens.

 That might make you feel better but that is not the true baby way.

>push footstool
 You tug on the footstool and it rocks and rocks and then it stops
 rocking.

 It is plush and the mom likes to read it to you.

>jump
 There is no way you are going to jump, you can barely crawl.

>throw ball
 Dropped.

>examine pillows
 The ring is a bunch of pillows and stuff piled around in a circle so
 you can't go crawling away when the mom is all distracted. The whole
 thing is taller than you even when you are sitting.

 Hey wait, what is Alfadog doing wedged in the pillows like that?

>examine alfadog
 It is Alfadog, your alphabet-knowing toy and it is all wedged under
 some pillows. He is about as long as you and he is about as tall as you
 when you are crawling, it is as if he is your brother only he is a dog.
 He has this switch on him that makes him run and say the alphabet and
 such.

>show book to mom
 You can only do that to something that is all alive.

>get alfadog
 It is hard enough to move Alfadog around when he is not all covered
 over with pillows, there is no way you are budging him yourself when he
 is wedged in there like that.

>point at alfadog
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>climb alphadog
>turn on switch
 You can pull up on stuff and all but you can't do that climbing thing.
 Stupid short stubby legs.

 You are all fumbly on the switch but then you get it turned on and look
 out! Alfadog lights up and his paws start digging in and he is barking
 out "A! B! C! D! EFG!" It looks like he may be stuck under those
 pillows but then "L! M! N! O! P!" pillows tumble out of his way and he
 is free, zipping off to the east! You hear him winding down, "W X Y and
 Zeee....." And now there is this big gap in the pillows to the east.

 That Alfadog is very powerful, he should probably be recalled.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>go east
 In Front of TV
 The entertainment center here holds the TV all towering above you and
 it has these glass doors beneath the TV that you can see stereo
 equipment through. You are near the couch to the south and the middle
 of the living room to the west and there is a small open area to play
 in to the north.

 You can see Alfadog and your favorite toy here.

>get toy
 You pick it up.

 There is a ding-dong and the mom comes clattering in all "Hang on! I'm
 coming!" She opens the door and there is Marion Kinmundy here for
 playgroup. She is carrying that little red haired girl Zoe who started
 coming to playgroup a couple of whiles ago. Zoe sees your favorite toy
 and her eyes light up.

 The mom must be psychic or something because she whirls around and
 snatches up your favorite toy. "Oh, no," she says with a little laugh,
 "we're not having you two fight over this thing again. I'll tuck it
 away where it'll be safe." And Marion laughs too, which is cool, that
 way they don't notice you and the little red haired girl glaring at
 each other.

 She wants your toy? And the mom wants to lock the toy away? Bring it
 on.

 Chapter 1
 Playtime

 Right behind Marion and Zoe the little red haired girl is Lisa who is
 Cassie's mom. Lisa is carrying Cassie all carefully but Cassie is
 squirming to get down. "Hi Farina, hi Marion--hang on Cassie, mommy's
 going to put you down," Lisa says and then she steps over the baby gate
 and dumps Cassie by the couch to the south of you.

 Meanwhile the mom is putting all the pillows back on the couch and
 loveseat. As she finishes she asks Marion, "Can I put this toy in Zoe's
 backpack for now?" Marion is all "Sure!" as she puts Zoe on the floor
 over by the rocking chair and sits on the loveseat.

 of the living room to the west and there is a small open area to play
 in to the north.

 You can see Alfadog here.

>examine backpack
 Zoe's backpack has all these cute bears sewed on it. Clearly her mom
 Marion picked it out, it does not reek of evil like it would if Zoe had
 chosen it. It is closed so you can't see what's in it though you know
 your toy is in there somewhere. It is next to the gliding rocking chair
 to the northwest.

>go northwest

 By the Rocking Chair
 The gliding rocking chair is all tall and wooden. It is where the mom
 rocks you when she thinks you need a nap even though you do not need
 naps. The loveseat is west and there is a small open area to the east
 and a big open area in the middle of the room to the south.

 A backpack with bears on and your favorite toy in it is shoved behind
 the rocking chair next to the wall.

 You can also see a smooth rock here.

 Zoe is sitting in a fog of grump on the floor.

 There is a ding-dong! and the mom goes and opens the front door. It is
 Becca and her son Jemison and some strange guy is there holding Watson
 Mason. "Come on in, everyone," the mom says. She turns to the strange
 guy, "I'm glad you could make it, Parry."

 Parry shrugs and smiles and says, "I always wondered what everyone did
 during playgroup."

 "Drink mimosas!" Becca says over her shoulder to Parry and there is
 polite laughter and Parry smiles like he is kinda unsure about all of
 this.

 "Why don't you put Watson in here with the others?" the mom asks and
 Parry nods. He ends up putting Watson by Jemison over by the loveseat.
 Then all the standing adults sit down with Parry sitting near you so
 now I guess they are sitting adults.

>kill zoe
 There is no way the parents will believe you had nothing to do with
 hurting her, you'd better leave her alone for now.

 Zoe scrunches up her face and bursts into wails.

>kiss zoe
 Your kisses are only for your family.

>take rock
 You pick it up.

>examine rock
 The mom found this one one of your walks, well it wasn't really a walk,
 more like the mom driving you around in a stroller, anyway she found
 this rock and gave it to you.

 Zoe scrunches up her face and bursts into wails.

>open backpack
 You would but Parry is rocking, rocking, rocking, and you can't reach
 under the rocking chair to get to the backpack while he is rocking,
 rocking, rocking.

 Zoe screws up her face and bursts into wails, those are so baby
 crocodile tears.

 You shove the smooth rock in your mouth and start chewing on it and
 that leaves your hands free.

>examine rocking chair
 The dad likes to sit in the chair and rock back and forth and back and
 forth and back and forth which is okay for napping (not that you need
 naps) but is not so good when you are trying to pull up on it.

 Zoe clenches her tiny fists and waves them while complaining about
 life. "I know, Zoe," Marion says. So Parry stops rocking long enough
 for Marion to reach the backpack under the rocking chair and then she
 digs around and pulls out a plastic cup and closes the backpack and she
 gives the plastic cup to Zoe. Then Zoe sees that it's not your favorite
 toy, ha ha to her, and she squalls and tries to shove the plastic cup
 away but Marion says, "Shh, Zoe, be calm," and makes Zoe take it.

>put rock under rocking chair
 That would be a good way to stop the rocking chair from rocking but it
 is a gliding rocking chair and so even if you put something under there
 it could keep gliding.

 Zoe gives the plastic cup a brief chew before spitting it out with a
 "buh" noise.

 You would but your mouth is all full.

>open backpack
 You would but Parry is rocking, rocking, rocking, and you can't reach
 under the rocking chair to get to the backpack while he is rocking,
 rocking, rocking.

>suck rock
 I only understood you as far as wanting to fuck.

>fuck
 You don't have speech down yet.

 Zoe stares at the plastic cup and she sighs.

>laugh
 You would but your mouth is all full.

 Marion asks Parry, "How is Shari doing?"

 You pop the smooth rock out of your mouth.

 "Oh, my God, Parry and Shari!" laughs Becca. "I hadn't realized
 that--that's just too precious."

 Zoe stares at the plastic cup and she sighs.

>take cup
 Zoe shrieks at you and yanks back the plastic cup. Marion sees that and
 she reacts in a flash and says "No, Zoe, no!" and stops doing whatever
 parent thing she was doing and jumps up and pulls Zoe away from you.
 "I'm sorry, Farina," she tells the mom.

 "She's feeling better," Parry says. "She's keeping food down now, at
 least."

 You already have that.

 Marion asks, "Oh, are you two expecting?"

>throw rock at zoe
 There is no way, you can barely pick stuff up and you are no Cy Young
 or whatever.

 Parry is all, "Oh, no, no, no. No. It's just the flu."

 Zoe takes the plastic cup and tosses it aside.

>examine cup
 This is one cup that originally came with a bunch of other cups and
 they were all different sizes so you could stack them up into a giant
 tower of cups. But there is only one cup, that is no good for stacking.

 Becca goes, "You two should give Watson a brother. Toughen him up."

>go east

 Small Open Area
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.

 "Can you imagine having two?" Lisa laughs, and it's not a calm laugh,
 more a desperate laugh, "I'd go crazy."

 These are books but boring and with no pictures. They are all probably
 post-modern stories of longing and loss and existential angst and
 whatever because books about Maisy totally are better.

 (first taking the books)
 The books are way big and there is no way you're picking them up or
 anything.

>examine pen
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine playpen
 This portable playpen is all old, probably it should be recalled except
 that the parents are way cheap. It is this frame made of metal bars and
 it has mesh sides and a floor for babies to play on. The bars go around
 in ovals at the top and bottom. It should be recalled because the top
 oval is hinged and you can lower one side of the playpen by pushing the
 top bar up and then letting go so that the mesh comes down, that is a
 total deathtrap.

 The mesh gives too much for you to pull yourself up on it.

>examine gate
 Plastic and it is wedged in there so you cannot go anywhere which is
 totally not right.

>look behind bookcase
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>go southwest

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 You can also see a plush book here.

>eat book
 (first taking the plush book)
 The plush book is big enough that you will have to drop everything to
 get it because it takes two hands.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a smooth rock

 You can hear Zoe squalling all loudly by the gliding rocking chair.

>drop all
 Dropped.

>get book
 You pick it up and it takes two hands.

>drop trou
 You can't see any such thing.

>go north

 By the Rocking Chair
 The gliding rocking chair is all tall and wooden. It is where the mom
 rocks you when she thinks you need a nap even though you do not need
 naps. The loveseat is west and there is a small open area to the east
 and a big open area in the middle of the room to the south.

 Parry's feet keep leaving the floor as he rocks.

 A backpack with bears on and your favorite toy in it is shoved behind
 the rocking chair next to the wall.

 You can also see a little doll and a plastic cup here.

 Zoe is sitting in a fog of grump on the floor.

>examine chair
 The dad likes to sit in the chair and rock back and forth and back and
 forth and back and forth which is okay for napping (not that you need
 naps) but is not so good when you are trying to pull up on it.

 Zoe makes this sort of grumping grunting half-cry.

>put book under chair
 (the plush book under the gliding rocking chair)
 That would be a good way to stop the rocking chair from rocking but it
 is a gliding rocking chair and so even if you put something under there
 it could keep gliding.

 Becca says to the mom, "Nice job on those mimosas."

 "Thanks," the mom replies.

>put book under parry's feet
 You can't see any such thing.

>put book under feet
 (the plush book under Parry)
 There is no real need to do that.

 Lisa says, "It's nice, they help me calm down."

 Zoe makes this sort of grumping grunting half-cry.

>wedge zoe under chair
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>pull feet
 It is no good kicking or biting a parent, it is better to rebel in less
 obvious ways.

 "And they're good for you," Marion says.

>examine zoe
 Grr, Zoe Kinmundy. That little red-haired girl has this sundress-like
 jumper thing, it's not like you know fashion or anything so you're not
 sure exactly what it is but it leaves her arms and legs bare for speed
 and evil. Her red hair is in pigtails, like that will fool anyone into
 thinking she is nice.

 "I'm not sure they're that good for you," Parry says.

>give book to zoe
 (the plush book to Zoe)
 Zoe shrieks at you and shoves the plush book out of your hands and hits
 at you. Marion sees that and she reacts in a flash and says "No, Zoe,
 no!" and stops doing whatever parent thing she was doing and jumps up
 and pulls Zoe away from you. "I'm sorry, Farina," she tells the mom.

 Marion says, "They do have orange juice in them."

>undo
 By the Rocking Chair
 [Previous turn undone.]

>push zoe
 That would certainly knock Zoe over but that would get everyone in an
 uproar so it's best not to do it unless you really need to.

 Marion says, "They do have orange juice in them."

 Zoe clenches her tiny fists and waves them while complaining about
 life.

>drop book
 Dropped.

 "Besides, if it tastes good, it's good for you," says Becca.

>go west

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west except that a baby gate is in the way. There is the rocking
 chair to the east as well, that is always fun.

 The legs of Marion dangle from the loveseat.

>pull up on marion
 Marion says "You go play with the others now" and takes you and puts
 you back on the ground.

 You can hear Zoe squalling all loudly by the gliding rocking chair and
 Marion stands up and goes to quiet her and then comes back in a second.

>examine loveseat
 The loveseat is pink and striped and tastes funny if you lick it. This
 is the north part of it and there is open space past it to the west
 that is blocked by a baby gate.

>lick loveseat
 It has this funny zing to it like dust or stale cheerios.

>snort loveseat
 I only understood you as far as wanting to short.

>examine gate
 Plastic and it is wedged in there so you cannot go anywhere which is
 totally not right.

>push gate
 It is fixed in place.
>pull up on loveseat

 You pull up on the north pink striped loveseat and get to your feet and
 you are all steady except for the occasional sway.

>examine me?
 You are as baby-like as ever.

>loveseat
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine loveseat
 The loveseat is pink and striped and tastes funny if you lick it. This
 is the north part of it and there is open space past it to the west
 that is blocked by a baby gate.

>look
 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west except that a baby gate is in the way. There is the rocking
 chair to the east as well, that is always fun.

 Marion is sitting there on the loveseat.

>go south
 You slide along while moving your hands to keep steady.

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 Becca is sitting on the loveseat.

 You can also see a rattly car here.

 Jemison and Watson are here. Jemison watches you watching him. Watson
 sits all sad and dumpy on the floor.

>examine watson
 Watson Mason has this big round face that is perfect for commercials
 and baby food labels, only his face is always tear-streaked so maybe he
 is not cut out for show-biz. Maybe he is sad because he is dressed like
 a teeny tiny engineer in his polo onesie with a collar and because he
 smells like baby powder.

>take car
 You cannot reach the rattly car because you are standing and if you let
 go with one hand you would just plop down before you could get it.

 "Hey, I just realized," Becca says all loud above you, "Your name is
 Parry Mason!"

>examine jemison
 Jemison Thorsby's name is not one you would want, that is for sure. He
 is stylish in his blue onesie and he has a small mouth and these big
 eyes that are watching, always watching, it is kinda creepy.

 "Um, yes?" Parry says.

>examine car
 It is all rattly, I guess that makes it more fun or something.

 "Cool, just like the detective!" Becca says.

>grow up
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>hug jemison
 You have short arms, you can't reach Jemison from up here.

 Parry says, "My name's actually spelled--"

 "No, I think the original Perry Mason was a lawyer," Lisa says.

>sit down
 You sit down on your diaper and it is good that it is all padded and
 stuff.

 Parry clears his throat. "The lawyer spells his name with an e--"

 "Right, lawyer, that's what I meant," Becca tells Lisa.

>inventory
 Your hands are all empty.

 "Let Parry finish," the mom says, but Parry just goes, "No, that's
 okay."

>get car
 When Jemison sees you take the rattly car, his eyes light up
 (metaphorically, it's not like his eyes are flashlights or anything)
 and he starts watching the rattly car and thus yourself.

>whisper to jemison to tell watson to kill zoe
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine car
 It is all rattly, I guess that makes it more fun or something.

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a
 loveseat to the north and more couch to the east.

 Lisa's legs are hanging off of the couch.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the rattly car.

>bite leg
 It is no good kicking or biting a parent, it is better to rebel in less
 obvious ways.

 You give the rattly car to Jemison and he grabs it out of your hands.

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a

 Lisa is sitting there on the couch.

 Jemison is playing with the rattly car.

>sit
 You sit down on your diaper and it is good that it is all padded and
 stuff.

>examine couch
 Grey and short and it is soft when the mom or the dad put you on it.
 This part is all to the west and there is more couch to the east.

 You can hear Zoe squalling all loudly by the gliding rocking chair.

>search couch
 It is not something you have to search.

>take car
 Jemison has a grip that is like steel.

>take nap
 You can't see any such thing.

>hit jemison
 Hitting and pushing and pulling other babies when you're in front of
 parents is no good, they willl take you away and you won't get your
 toy.

 "Say, how's Watson's rash doing?" Lisa asks Parry.

 Parry clears his throat. "He's much better, thanks."

>examine watson's rash
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine watson
 Watson Mason has this big round face that is perfect for commercials
 and baby food labels, only his face is always tear-streaked so maybe he
 is not cut out for show-biz. Maybe he is sad because he is dressed like
 a teeny tiny engineer in his polo onesie with a collar and because he
 smells like baby powder. He is by the south end of the loveseat to the
 north.

 The mom says, "Did you use zinc oxide cream?"

>smell watson
 Watson is by the south end of the loveseat to the north and so is way
 too far away for that.

 "In a roundabout way," Parry says, "We used Boudreaux's butt paste."

>yeah make Parry get up
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>get car
 Jemison has a grip that is like steel.

 "Ew," Becca laughs, "that is the grossest name for a product."

>go east

 Couch in the Middle
 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 Marion tells Becca, "Given what we have to deal with from our children,
 a name like that is the least of our worries."

>examine jemison
 Jemison Thorsby's name is not one you would want, that is for sure. He
 is stylish in his blue onesie and he has a small mouth and these big
 eyes that are watching, always watching, it is kinda creepy. He is
 carrying a rattly car. He is by the west end of the couch to the west.

>pull up on couch
 You pull up on the middle grey couch and get to your feet and you are
 all steady except for the occasional sway.

>examine mom
 When the mom is all sitting down she does not tower so much over you
 but she is still pretty big.

>go east
 You slide along while moving your hands to keep steady.

 Couch at the East
 You are where the couch ends here at the east, at least where it ends
 at one end. North is the TV and west is more couch.

 Cassie is all pulled up on the east grey couch.

>examine cassie
 That is Cassie Sandoval, she is wearing a white dress that is all
 bright against her dark skin and her hair is captured with pink clips.
 Her arms are scraped up and she has some bruises on her legs.

 You can hear Zoe squalling all loudly by the gliding rocking chair.

>examine clips
 Wow those are pink.

>take clips
 You cannot reach the pink hair clips because you are standing and if
 you let go with one hand you would just plop down before you could get
 it.

>examine bruises
 You can't see any such thing.

>pull cassie
 That would certainly knock Cassie over but that would get everyone in
 an uproar so it's best not to do it unless you really need to.

>sit
 You sit down on your diaper and it is good that it is all padded and
 stuff.

>look
 Couch at the East
 You are where the couch ends here at the east, at least where it ends
 at one end. North is the TV and west is more couch.

 Cassie is all pulled up on the east grey couch.

>examine couch
 Grey and short and it is soft when the mom or the dad put you on it.
 This part is the east part. The rest of the couch is west.

>pull up on couch
 You wriggle your way next to Cassie and pull up on the east grey couch
 and get to your feet.

 Lisa all of a sudden busts out with "I know I asked this last time but
 does anyone else's boobs hurt? Because here lately feeding Cassie is
 murder."

>again
 You are already all pulled up on the east grey couch and you can't go
 any higher.

 "Mine don't," Parry says quietly, but Becca is all "That's why I got
 Jemison on solids as soon as I could."

>climb couch
 You are already all pulled up on the east grey couch and you can't go
 any higher.

 The mom asks Lisa, "Have you tried lanolin?"

>sit
 You sit down on your diaper and it is good that it is all padded and
 stuff.

 "You and your remedies, Farina," Lisa says. "Lanolin this and cabbage
 leaves that."

>go north

 In Front of TV
 The entertainment center here holds the TV all towering above you and
 it has these glass doors beneath the TV that you can see stereo
 equipment through. You are near the couch to the south and the middle
 of the living room to the west and there is a small open area to play
 in to the north.

 You can see Alfadog here.

 "It makes me glad Zoe was so good at latching on," Marion says. Grr,
 Zoe.

>turn on alfadog
 You make a move towards the switch on Alfadog and the mom grabs you and
 says, "We're not playing with Alfadog right now, kiddo. We're working
 on pulling up."

 Lisa sighs and says, "Maybe I'll try the lanolin," and the mom says,
 "Let us know how it works."

>open doors
 You push on the doors to the entertainment center but the parents have
 them all fixed in place.

>look through doors
 There is stereo equipment behind the glass doors and there is a big TV
 all tall up there on the entertainment center.

>turn on tv
 You do not have the remote control that the parents use to make the TV
 turn on or off or show different things like Sesame Street or Baby
 Feynman.

>examine playpen
 So which do you mean, the northeast part of the playpen, or the
 southwest part of the playpen?

>southwest part
 This portable playpen is all old, probably it should be recalled except
 that the parents are way cheap. It is this frame made of metal bars and
 it has mesh sides and a floor for babies to play on. The bars go around
 in ovals at the top and bottom. It should be recalled because the top
 oval is hinged and you can lower one side of the playpen by pushing the
 top bar up and then letting go so that the mesh comes down.  It is in
 the middle of the living room to the west.

>go west

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 You can also see a smooth rock here.

>open playpen
 You have short arms, you can't reach the top oval from down here.

>pull up on playpen
 The mesh gives too much for you to pull yourself up on it.

>look in playpen
 The southwest part of the playpen is empty.

>go northeast

 Small Open Area
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.

>look in playpen
 The northeast part of the playpen is empty.

 That baby gate is completely in your way.

>go northwest
 You so can't go that way.

>go west

 By the Rocking Chair
 The gliding rocking chair is all tall and wooden. It is where the mom
 rocks you when she thinks you need a nap even though you do not need
 naps. The loveseat is west and there is a small open area to the east
 and a big open area in the middle of the room to the south.

 Parry's feet keep leaving the floor as he rocks.

 A backpack with bears on and your favorite toy in it is shoved behind
 the rocking chair next to the wall.

 You can also see a plush book here.

 Zoe is sitting in a fog of grump on the floor.

>examine fog
 Boy, Zoe is grumpy.

 Zoe makes this sort of coughing hiccuping half-cry.

>examine parry
 That is Parry Mason, he is Watson Mason's dad. Normally Watson's mom
 Shari is here but she must be somewhere else so that is why Parry is
 here.

>climb parry
 As soon as you have pulled up on the gliding rocking chair Parry looks
 down and says "Hey, there, you want to be picked up?" and he lifts you
 into his lap and stops rocking. If you were on the ground you could get
 to the backpack now.

>inventory
 Your hands are all empty.

>spit
 That would get your clothes all dirty and you do not need to do that
 right now.

>poop
 See for you to do that on command you'd have to be potty trained and
 you are not, that is just another way the man controls you.

 Parry says, "Okay, down you go," and he gently lowers you to the floor
 and starts rocking again.

>spit on zoe
 It may be normal little baby behavior to drool and spit up all over
 parents and other babies but you are like eleven months old and now it
 would be unseemly.

 Zoe makes this sort of coughing grunting half-sob.

 Watson sits all sad and dumpy on the floor.

>go west
 You so can't go that way.

>go south

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a
 loveseat to the north and more couch to the east.

 Lisa's legs are hanging off of the couch.

 Jemison is all chewing on the rattly car.

>drop rock
 Dropped.

>get rock
 When Jemison sees you take the smooth rock, his eyes light up and he
 lets go of a rattly car and starts watching the smooth rock and thus
 yourself.

>go north

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the

 laughs and puts him back on the floor.

>go north

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to

 The legs of Marion dangle from the loveseat.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly

 Zoe has hold of a soft foam block all sadly.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the smooth rock.

 Zoe looks at the soft foam block and she sighs.

>give rock to zoe
 Zoe shrieks at you and shoves the smooth rock out of your hands and
 hits at you. Marion sees that and she reacts in a flash and says "No,
 Zoe, no!" and stops doing whatever parent thing she was doing and jumps
 up and pulls Zoe away from you. "I'm sorry, Farina," she tells the mom.

 Jemison suddenly sees that the smooth rock is available and he scoops
 it up.

>take block
 Zoe shrieks at you and yanks back the soft foam block. Marion sees that
 and she reacts in a flash and says "No, Zoe, no!" and stops doing
 whatever parent thing she was doing and jumps up and pulls Zoe away
 from you. "I'm sorry, Farina," she tells the mom.

 Watson wanders in from the southwest.

>examine block
 Magenta and soft and fun to chew. It is like one hand wide on a side.

 Zoe drops the soft foam block and shoves it away from her. When Jemison
 sees Zoe drop the soft foam block he gets rid of a smooth rock and
 takes the soft foam block instead.

>take rock
 When Jemison sees you pick up the smooth rock, he gets all excited and
 he drops a soft foam block and starts watching the smooth rock and thus
 yourself.

>give rock to parry
 He is too busy with talking and adults and other stuff.

 Zoe scrunches up her face and bursts into wails.

>drop rock
 When you drop the smooth rock Jemison is all over that and he snatches
 it up.

 Zoe scrunches up her face and bursts into wails.

 Watson gingerly takes the plush book. When Jemison sees Watson take the
 plush book, his eyes light up and he drops a smooth rock and starts
 watching the plush book and thus Watson.

>take block
 When Jemison sees you take the soft foam block, his eyes light up and
 he forgets all about the plush book and he starts watching the soft
 foam block and thus yourself.

>put block under chair
 That would be a good way to stop the rocking chair from rocking but it
 is a gliding rocking chair and so even if you put something under there
 it could keep gliding.

 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 The mom is sitting on the couch.

 Cassie has hold of the squishy ball and keeps fiddling with it.

 Cassie crawls off to the northwest.

 Zoe looks at the teeny squeezy book and she sighs.

 Cassie offers the squishy ball to Zoe and Zoe shrieks and shoves and
 kicks at the squishy ball and at Cassie. Marion sees that and she

 parent thing she was doing and jumps up and pulls Zoe away from Cassie.
 "Sorry about Zoe's behavior," she says all apologetically.

 down and says "Hey, there, you want to be picked up?" and he lifts you
 into his lap and stops rocking. And then Jemison pulls up on the
 gliding rocking chair and looks up at you and grunts softly.

 Zoe takes the teeny squeezy book and shakes it half-heartedly, she is
 so bored with it.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>go down
 You wriggle and fuss a bit and Parry says, "Okay, down you go," and he
 gently lowers you to the floor. He then is all "And now it's your turn"
 and he picks Jemison up but Jemison makes a big fuss and Parry is all,
 "Whoa! Whoa!" and Becca laughs and says, "Jemison gets that way
 sometimes." Parry smiles weakly and puts Jemison back down and Jemison
 looks pointedly at the soft foam block. Then Parry starts rocking
 again.

 Zoe shakes the teeny squeezy book half-heartedly.

 Marion says. So Marion reaches the backpack under the rocking chair and
 she sees the white onesie stuck in the backpack. "Geez," she says and
 pulls out a teething ring and dumps it in Zoe's lap. Zoe gets all upset
 but Marion says, "Shh, Zoe, be calm, I can't fix the backpack if you're
 fussing." Parry says, "Here, I'll empty out the backpack and fix that
 for you" but Marion says "No, thanks," and she sits down and starts

 grabs the soft foam block. Parry gently lowers Jemison to the floor and
 starts rocking again.

 There is this rattle rattle and your head snaps up and you look way
 over at the loveseat and see Marion start to pull your favorite toy out
 of the backpack and then she looks at you and then she looks at Zoe and
 she puts the toy back in the backpack.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a plush book

>give book to zoe
 (the plush book to Zoe)
 Zoe shrieks at you and shoves the plush book out of your hands and hits
 at you. Marion sees that and she reacts in a flash and says "Parry,
 here," and shoves the backpack at Parry who takes it. "Can you get that
 onesie out of the way?" Parry just nods and digs in the backpack and
 pulls out your favorite toy and dumps it in his lap! Then he starts
 tugging the onesie this way and that to free it from the implacable
 jaws of the backpack zipper. Meanwhile Marion shushes Zoe before
 sitting back on the loveseat.

 Watson puts down the smooth rock. When Jemison sees Watson get rid of
 the smooth rock he drops a soft foam block and takes the smooth rock
 instead.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>save
>cf5
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>pull up on parry
 As soon as you have pulled up on the gliding rocking chair Parry looks
 down and says "Hey, there, you want to be picked up?" and he lifts you
 into his lap and stops rocking.

 Watson gingerly takes the soft foam block. When Jemison sees Watson
 pick up the soft foam block, he gets all excited and he lets go of a
 smooth rock and starts watching the soft foam block and thus Watson.

>get toy
 You pick it up.

 Parry says, "Okay, down you go," and he gently lowers you to the floor,
 right next to Zoe. Zoe looks over and sees what you have in your hands
 and she goes totally nuts, she is shrieking and waving her fists and if
 she had Force powers you would totally be choked right now.

 And of course Zoe acting out gets Marion and the mom to pay attention
 and Marion is all "Hey, hey, Zoe, calm down!" and the mom is all "Oh,
 gosh, they managed to get that toy out of the backpack." So the jig is
 up where by "the jig" I mean the toy and by "up" I mean going away.
>swallow toy

 Chapter 2
 Snacktime

 And it's just like you expected. The mom scoops you and the toy up and
 the two of you dangle in mid-air while she removes the baby gate by the
 loveseat and goes around behind the loveseat. There's a cabinet back
 there, she pushes down the baby lock at the top of the cabinet door and
 opens the door and in goes your toy.

 You would be all into getting the toy back except everyone decides now
 is the time to have a snack so a bunch of toys get piled in that small
 open area in the living room and you and Zoe and Cassie and Watson and
 Jemison are dragged into the kitchen and out comes the food.

 At the Table
 Your high chair is not way super high since it only gets you up to the
 level of the kitchen table but that is still pretty high. It lets you
 see around the table which is better than when you are on the floor and
 cannot even see the top of the table.

 The mom is hovering around you.

 In front of you is this spoon full of food that the mom wants you to
 eat.

 You can also see Becca, Parry, Lisa, and Marion here.

 Jemison and Watson and Cassie and Zoe are here. They are all being fed.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>puke
 You start to spit up but the mom is right there wiping up your spit.

 Becca says, "Farina, I know you're not feeding that child chopped-up
 people food." Meanwhile, Cassie is trying to climb out of her chair so
 she can fall to the floor and Lisa is restraining her.

>eat food
 You open your mouth and the mom spoons in the prunes. Yeuch. And if
 that isn't bad enough, the spoon goes away and comes back with more
 prunes! You are just like Sisyphus here.

 "It's no different than canned baby food," the mom tells Becca.
 Meanwhile, Watson is spitting up and Parry is looking sad that he's
 going to have to change Watson's clothes.

>eat food
 You open your mouth and the mom spoons in the prunes. Yeuch. And if
 that isn't bad enough, the spoon goes away and comes back with more
 prunes!

 "Really?" Lisa says. "I'd be worried that I'd give Cassie something
 that'd hurt her." Meanwhile, Zoe is demanding more food. Grr, Zoe.

>cry
 The mom says, "I know you don't like them, but prunes are good for
 you."

 "Kids can eat nearly anything you can if it's pureed," says Marion.
 Meanwhile, the mom is saying, "Here! Take a bite!"

>close mouth
 You can't see any such thing.

>scream
 The mom says, "I know you don't like them, but prunes are good for
 you."

 "Weird," Becca says. "Then why buy special baby food at all?"
 Meanwhile, Jemison is taking bits of food and dropping them over his
 high chair and then watching them hit the floor.

>rock
 You rock and rock and try to tip your chair over but it is too safely
 designed. The mom must read Consumer Reports or something.

 "Well," says Parry, "Sometimes it's really convenient to have a jar for
 Mason so--whoops!" And then you stop paying attention to him because he
 spilled a teeny bowl of Cheerios and you and all the other babies are
 all staring at the spray of Cheerios.

>push sppon
 (tearing yourself away from the Cheerios)
 You reach for it but the mom moves it away and says "Ah ah ah! No
 hands! Eat it, don't play with it!"

 Watson looks at the Cheerios all sadly.

>play with cheerios
 With you strapped into your high chair you cannot reach the pile of
 Cheerios.

 Jemison reaches for the Cheerios but they are way too far away.

>go down
 (tearing yourself away from the Cheerios)
 You are all strapped into your high chair so you are going nowhere.

 Cassie rocks hard in her seat, maybe she thinks she can tip over to get
 to the Cheerios.

 Finally all of this feeding is over and the Cheerios get put away and
 everyone gets wiped up with baby wipes before getting dumped back in
 the living room.

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 You can also see a tall plastic block here.

 Couch in the Middle
 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 Jemison is all staring at the velcro jangly balls. The velcro jangly
 balls hang off of him.

>examine balls
 They are all silver and jangly with velcro on the end of them and they
 dangle off of Jemison.

 Jemison reaches around to the jangly balls and pats at them and they
 jangle quietly.

>examine block
 So which do you mean, the short plastic block, the soft foam block, the
 tall plastic block, or the medium plastic block?

>medium
 It is green and it is about as wide as you are and as tall as your head
 is high when you are sitting down. It is by the south end of the
 loveseat to the northwest.

 You hear Watson cry loudly, boy is he angry.

>examine short block
 It is red and it is about as wide as you are and as tall as your head
 is high when you are crawling around. It is in that small open area to
 the northeast.

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 You can see a medium plastic block here.

 Parry says to Marion and the mom, "Your two kids really love that one
 toy."

>push medium block e
 You shove and shove at the medium plastic block and eventually you get
 it moving to the east and then you follow it.

 The mom laughs. "Ever since Zoe started coming it's been that way."

 You hear Watson cry loudly. Then Parry says, "Farina, I'm going to
 borrow your swing and see if that calms Watson down." He goes clomping
 around and you can see him come back with a baby swing. He goes over by
 the TV with it and then there is the picking up of Watson and the
 strapping in of Watson and the swinging of Watson, I hope that makes
 Watson feel better.

>go northeast

 Small Open Area
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.

 You can also see a short plastic block (on which is Cassie), a little
 doll, a much-loved kangaroo, a plastic cup, a soft foam block, and a
 squishy ball here.

 "I always thought that kind of competition wouldn't happen until Zoe
 was two or so," Marion says.

 Cassie climbs down off of the short plastic block.

>push short block sw
 You shove and shove at the short plastic block and eventually you get
 it moving to the southwest and then you follow it.

 Zoe stalks in from the east and settles near you.

 You can also see a short plastic block, a medium plastic block, and a
 tall plastic block here.

 Zoe has her eye on you.

 Becca says, "Jemison doesn't really care about other kids' toys," she
 is smoking something and it is not tobacco.

>get on short block
 You start out pulling up on the block but it is so short you fall
 forward onto it and then you are sitting on it a little ways above the
 ground.

 "I don't know what I'll do if Cassie ends up grabbing toys from other
 kids," Lisa says.

>examine smoking
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine becca
 Becca is Jemison's mom, she is as loud as Jemison is quiet and that is
 very loud. Or very quiet. Anyway, that is Becca. She is next to the
 gliding rocking chair to the north.

 Marion says, "You'll watch for it and redirect Cassie and the other
 kid. When Cassie's older, you'll punish her."

 You see Parry stand up and he goes over to where the TV is and the
 swing is and he does something that probably involves Watson before he
 sits down again.

>push medium block against tall block
 You can't see any such thing.

>get on medium block
 (getting off the short plastic block)
 You carefully climb onto the medium plastic block, it is a ways off the
 ground.

 "Oh," Lisa says, "I couldn't spank Cassie."

 Zoe stalks off to the west.

>get on tall block
 (getting off the medium plastic block)
 You clamber up onto the tall plastic block, you are getting so high.

 "You don't have to spank her," the mom says and Marion chimes in,
 "Farina's right. You'll figure out what Cassie's levers are and you'll
 pull them."

>look
 Middle of the Living Room (on the tall plastic block)

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 You can also see a short plastic block and a medium plastic block here.

 Lisa sounds all puzzled, "What do you mean?"

>open playpen
 You push on the side of the oval closest to you and it goes up a bit
 and clicks but when you let go it drops back into place. I guess you
 need to push up the oval at both ends of the playpen at the same time.

 Marion says, "As outgoing as Cassie is, you can try sending her to her
 room, or you can take away something she likes or likes to do. Figure
 out what she values. That's where you apply pressure."

>go down
 (getting off the tall plastic block)
 The tall block is way tall and you would hurt yourself if you tried to
 get down from it directly so instead you climb onto the medium block.

 "Oh, okay," Lisa says, but you can tell she is not convinced.

>go down
 You get off the medium plastic block.

 Cassie has hold of the soft foam block and keeps fiddling with it.

 Cassie tosses the soft foam block up and it falls.

 Nothing obvious happens.

 Cassie crawls off to the southwest.

 Cassie climbs onto the medium plastic block.

>examine backpack

>examine toy
 You can't see any such thing.

>put foam in mouth
 You shove the soft foam block in your mouth and start chewing on it and
 that leaves your hands free.

 Cassie climbs onto the tall plastic block.

>go up
 You so can't go that way.

 Cassie giggles and leaps off of the tall block and that would be okay
 if she didn't then smack her face into the floor. Cassie shrieks, it is
 the loudest you have ever heard her be. I guess she is not the
 super-tough baby she thinks she is. Anyway Lisa leaps up and runs to
 Cassie and Parry leaves his tumbler and runs to Cassie too, they
 scatter the plastic blocks around the room in their haste. "Baby, baby,
 it's okay, shh," you hear Lisa saying and then Parry is also checking
 Cassie over and shining this little flashlight in her eyes and saying,
 "I think she's okay, she's just scared. Her pupillary response is just
 fine."

>examine tall block
 It is blue and it is about as wide as you are and tall as your head is
 high when you are pulled up.

 Lisa is still saying "It'll be okay, Cassie, it'll be okay" and Parry
 is saying "Breathe, Cassie, breathe" and Cassie is now taking big
 hiccuping breaths.

>examine medium block
 It is green and it is about as wide as you are and as tall as your head
 is high when you are sitting down. It is over by the north end of the
 loveseat to the northwest.

>go northwest

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Hey, that baby gate that blocked your way west is all gone.

 You can see a medium plastic block here.

 Zoe stalks in from the south and settles near you.

 Cassie finally is all better and is laughing some and Lisa says,
 "Thanks, Parry, I appreciate your help" and Parry says, "No problem."
 And they go back to their seats.

>go west

 Behind the Loveseat
 Back here is the back of the loveseat casting a shadow over you, it is
 kind of cold. You can go south and east. You could go west but there is
 totally a door in your way. You could go north in the hall but there is
 a baby gate in the way there.

 Zoe stalks in from the east and settles near you.

>loveseat
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine door
 It is big and wood and goes outside.

>open door
 You can open and close some things but not people-sized doors.

>gnaw through door then flee to freedom
 You can't see any such thing.

>go south

 By the Cabinet
 The cabinet that is also like an endtable for the loveseat and the
 couch is here. You can go north back to behind the loveseat.

 Way up on top of the cabinet you see a heavy tumbler.

 You can't believe the mom just shoved your favorite toy in that cabinet
 so you couldn't have it.

 Zoe stalks in from the north and settles near you.

>examine cabinet
 The cabinet is wood like a lot of other furniture in here because the
 parents like wood or something, maybe they are tree huggers but only if
 the trees have been cut down and planed and shaped. Anyway it has this
 door in it which is closed and on top is a heavy tumbler.

>open cabinet
 You tug on the door but it has one of those baby lock things on it that
 you have to push down to open the door and you cannot reach it at all
 so the door opens a tiny bit and you can barely see your favorite toy
 in there.

 Then Zoe falls forward and pushes against the door and it slams shut.

 Lisa looks over the couch at you and at Zoe and she says, "Awwww,
 they're playing together! How cute!"

 "Cassie is really pulling up well," the mom tells Lisa.

>push cabinet
 It is pretty firmly on the ground right now.

 "Oh, thanks," Lisa says. "She's probably too good at pulling up and
 climbing, to tell you the truth."

>examine tumbler
 The tumbler is thick glass and it holds water, it is left over from
 Parry snacking. It is way up on the cabinet.

 "We've been working on pulling up," the mom says, boy is she going to
 be surprised by all the practice you're getting today.

>push cabinet
 It is pretty firmly on the ground right now.

 Becca snorts. "I love how all of you take credit for your kids'
 development. Like you're the one pulling up."

>tell becca, shut up you stoner hippie
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine lock
 You cannot really see the baby lock when the cabinet door is closed but
 you know what it looks like, it is a plastic latch way up at the top of
 the door. If you push down on the plastic latch then you can open the
 door which is a laugh because you are way short and it is way high.

 Lisa says, "You're just annoyed that Jemison just sits there--" but
 Becca keeps on talking, "So your kid pulls up or cruises or whatever.
 Big deal!"

>becca, shut up hippie
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>tell becca about filthy hippies shutting the hell up
 You can't see any such thing.

>gurgle
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go north

 Behind the Loveseat
 Back here is the back of the loveseat casting a shadow over you, it is
 kind of cold. You can go south and east. You could go west but there is
 totally a door in your way. You could go north in the hall but there is
 a baby gate in the way there.

 Parry says, "Kids develop at different speeds. It's not as if I'll
 still be helping Watson pull up when he goes to college."

>go east

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Lisa's legs are hanging off of the loveseat.

 You can also see a medium plastic block here.

 "As long as Zoe doesn't fall too far behind, I'm not worried," Marion
 says.

>go south

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 "Yeah," Parry says. "It won't bother me if Watson is like many boys and
 is slower to talk."

>go south

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a
 loveseat to the north and more couch to the east.

 You can see Parry or at least his legs over by the couch.

 There is a red footstool, it is right next to the couch.

 You can also see a short plastic block and a rattly car here.

 Cassie is looking around for mischief to make.

 You can just see some paper beyond the footstool.

 "As long as Cassie is ahead of where she's supposed to be, I won't
 worry either," Lisa says.

>examine paper
 It is a tiny folded piece of paper. It is tucked behind the footstool.

 Cassie climbs onto the short plastic block.

>take paper
 The folded piece of paper is tucked behind the footstool and so is way
 too far away for that.

 Cassie climbs down off of the short plastic block.

>go behind footstool
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine footstool
 The footstool is up in a corner, there is only a small gap between it
 and the couch with more couch past it to the west. Beyond it past the
 gap between the footstool and the couch you can see this little piece
>go east
 of paper.

 Cassie climbs onto the short plastic block.


 Couch in the Middle
 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 Jemison is all staring at the velcro jangly balls. The velcro jangly
 balls hang off of him.

 Jemison reaches around to the jangly balls and pats at them and they go
 jangle jangle jangle.

>take balls
 You tug on the velcro jangly balls and you tug some more and they come
 off of Jemison with a rrrrrrrip sound and Jemison looks at you with sad
 sad eyes and then stares at the velcro balls.

 Watson wanders in from the north.

>laugh maniacally
 I only understood you as far as wanting to laugh.

>wear balls
 You put on the velcro jangly balls.

>go west
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a
 loveseat to the north and more couch to the east.

 You can see Parry or at least his legs over by the couch.

 There is a red footstool, it is right next to the couch.

 You can also see a short plastic block and a rattly car here.

 Cassie is looking around for mischief to make.

 Jemison comes in after you.

>go west
 Crawling like you are there is no way you will fit in the narrow gap
 between the footstool and the couch, it is because you have the
 shoulders of a very small linebacker.

 Jemison cannot look away from you and the velcro jangly balls.

>pull up
 You'll have to say what you want to pull up on.

>full up on stool
 I only understood you as far as wanting to full.

>oops stool
 Sorry, that can't be corrected.

>pull up on stool
 You pull up on the footstool and get to your feet and you are all
 steady except for the occasional sway.

 Jemison cannot look away from you and the velcro jangly balls.

>go west
 There is just enough space for you to slide between the footstool and
 the couch so you cruise along the couch past the footstool and into the
 tiny space back there.

 Secret Space by the Couch
 There is not a lot of room back here behind the footstool, you fill
 most of the space between the footstool and the couch and this wood
 cabinet that is acting like an endtable.

 There is a red footstool, it is all close to you.

 There is this tiny folded piece of paper shoved under the cabinet.

>get oaoer
 You can't see any such thing.

>get paper
 You cannot reach the folded piece of paper because you are standing and
 if you let go with one hand you would just plop down before you could
 get it.

>examine paper
 It is a tiny folded piece of paper that is all shoved under the wood
 cabinet.

>sit down
 You sit down on your diaper and it is good that it is all padded and
 stuff.

>get paper
 You tug and tug and tug and then you see Parry's hand reach over you
 and remove the tumbler from on top of the cabinet where it was and pop!
 the folded paper comes out from under the wood cabinet and the cabinet
 goes rock rock rock. It is a good thing Parry was thirsty right now.

 Becca is still all sipping on a mimosa and she says, "Hey, hospitals
 should give us mimosas to go with our epidurals."

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>read paper
 It must be nice to read, the mom and the dad are always doing it, but
 you do not yet know how.

 The mom laughs, "Becca, you didn't even get an epidural."

>examine paper
 It is a tiny folded piece of paper.

 Becca just smiles while Lisa says, "I still can't believe you did
 that."

>unfold paper
 It is really folded and creased from being under the cabinet and your
 fingers are too stubby.

 "It wasn't too hard," Becca says. "I just screamed a lot and hit Kurt
 when the pain got really bad."

>unfold paper
 It is really folded and creased from being under the cabinet and your
 fingers are too stubby.

 "The trick," Marion says, "is to relax into the pain instead of
 anticipating it and tensing up."

>put paper in mouth
 You would but your mouth is all full.

 Lisa sighs and says, "My epidural stopped working."

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a folded piece of paper
   some velcro jangly balls (being worn)
   a soft foam block (being chewed)

 "What?" Becca asks. "I hadn't heard that."

>pull up on stool
 You have stuff in your hands and you will need those hands to pull
 yourself up so drop something I guess.

 "Yeah", says Lisa, "I got my epidural and then they turned me on my
 side. The next thing I knew I was feeling everything, and I mean
 everything, on my left side."

>rock
 You are already totally rocking.

 Parry pipes up, "You know, it's a shame that the anesthesiologist makes
 you hunch forward so he can slide the needle into your spine just when
 contractions make you want to flatten out."

>push cabinet
 It goes rock rock rock now that there is no paper wedged under it.

 All the other parent people stare and Parry and he sits back quietly.

>again
 It goes rock rock rock now that there is no paper wedged under it.

>again
 It goes rock rock rock now that there is no paper wedged under it.

>go north
 Really there is only one way out of this teeny space and that is to
 pull up and cruise on out to the east.

>pull up
 You'll have to say what you want to pull up on.

>pull up on stool
 You have stuff in your hands and you will need those hands to pull
 yourself up so drop something I guess.

>drop paper. pull up on stool
 Dropped.

 You pull up on the footstool and get to your feet and you are all
>drop paper
 steady except for the occasional sway.

 You have short arms, you can't reach the folded piece of paper from up
 here.

>go east
 You slide back out into the big wild world.

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a
 loveseat to the north and more couch to the east.

 There is a red footstool, it is all close to you.

 There is Parry on the couch.

 You can also see a heavy tumbler, a short plastic block, and a rattly
 car here.

 Cassie and Watson and Jemison are here. Cassie is looking around for
 mischief to make. Watson sits all sad and dumpy on the floor. Jemison
 is all staring at the velcro jangly balls.

 Zoe stalks in from the east and settles near you.

 Jemison cannot look away from you and the velcro jangly balls.

>go north
 (first letting go of the footstool and plopping on the ground)
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 Zoe stalks in from the south and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you.

>go north
 You jangle your way out of the room.

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Lisa's legs are hanging off of the loveseat.

 You can also see a medium plastic block here.

 Zoe stalks in from the south and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you.

>go west
 You jangle your way out of the room.

 Behind the Loveseat
 Back here is the back of the loveseat casting a shadow over you, it is
 kind of cold. You can go south and east. You could go west but there is
 totally a door in your way. You could go north in the hall but there is
 a baby gate in the way there.

 Zoe stalks in from the east and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you.

>go south
 You jangle your way out of the room.

 By the Cabinet
 The cabinet that is also like an endtable for the loveseat and the
 couch is here. You can go north back to behind the loveseat.

 Way up on top of the cabinet you see a paper coaster.

 Zoe stalks in from the north and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you.

 "You've all picked out preschools, right?" Becca says.

>becca, SHUT UP YOU HIPPIE NOBODY LIKES YOU
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>rock cabinet
 I only understood you as far as wanting to rock.

>rock out
 I only understood you as far as wanting to rock.

>push cabinet
 It goes rock rock rock now that there is no paper wedged under it.

 Parry is all, "Not really."

>rock
 You are already totally rocking.

 "Oh my God, it's almost too late!" Lisa says, and Becca chimes in,
 "Competition for the good preschools is fierce."

>pull up on cabinet
 You can't pull up on the wood cabinet to stand.

 Parry says, "We've looked at some, but really we're just after
 somewhere where Watson can have more socialization."

 Jemison reaches out and pokes at the velcro jangly balls.

>remove balls
 The bells go rrrrrrrrip and pull off.

 "Cassie is in preschool one day a week," says Lisa. "I can already tell
 that she's learning faster because of it."

>give balls to jemison
 You give the velcro jangly balls to Jemison and he grabs them out of
 your hands and sticks them onto his onesie.

 Becca agrees, "I'm going to make sure Jemison has three or four legs up
 educationally."

>becca, SHUT UP HELICOPTER MOM NOBODY LIKES YOU
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>open cabinet
>pull up on loveseat
 You tug on the door and the baby lock on the door catches and the
 entire cabinet rocks towards you now that there is no paper under it
 and your favorite toy rattles around in there. This paper coaster that
 must have been under the tumbler slides forward like it's about to fall
 off the cabinet.

 Then Zoe shoves the door and the cabinet rocks back making the coaster
 slide back fully on top of the cabinet and the door closes.

 You can totally hear Marion's frown when she says, "I'm not interested
 in pushing Zoe like that."

 The back loveseat is behind the loveseat to the north and so is way too
 far away for that.

 "It's not pushing," Becca sniffs. "It's making sure our kids live up to
 their potential."

 Jemison jiggles the jangly balls and they go jangle jangle jangle.

>take balls
 You tug on the velcro jangly balls and you tug some more and they come
 off of Jemison with a rrrrrrrip sound and Jemison looks at you with sad
 sad eyes and then stares at the velcro balls.

 "Still," Marion says, and the conversation kinda peters out.

 at the velcro jangly balls.

 and tall enough that you cannot really climb up on it from the floor.

 Jemison cannot look away from you and the velcro jangly balls.

>go north
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 You suddenly hear this heavy thud which must be Cassie leaping off the
 tall plastic block. Cassie shrieks, it is the loudest you have ever
 heard her be. I guess she is not the super-tough baby she thinks she
 is. Anyway Lisa leaps up and runs to Cassie and Parry leaves his
 tumbler and runs to Cassie too, they scatter the plastic blocks around
 the room in their haste. "Baby, baby, it's okay, shh," you hear Lisa
 saying and then Parry is saying, "I think she's okay, she's just
 scared. Her pupillary response is just fine."

>get tumbler
 There is no way you're lifting it, it is really heavy.

 Lisa is still saying "It'll be okay, Cassie, it'll be okay" and Parry
 is saying "Breathe, Cassie, breathe" and Cassie is now taking big

 And they go back to their seats. You see Parry pick up his tumbler for
 a drink and he lifts it to his lips and says "Ugh! There's a soft foam
 block in my tumbler!" and everyone laughs at Parry. Becca says, "That's
 why you don't put things where the kids can get to them!" And Parry
 sighs and you see him put the tumbler way up on the wood cabinet in the
 corner between the couch and the loveseat and definitely out of your
 reach.

 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

>go north
 You jangle your way out of the room.

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Lisa's legs are hanging off of the loveseat.

 Zoe stalks in from the southeast and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

>go west
 You jangle your way out of the room.

 Behind the Loveseat
 Back here is the back of the loveseat casting a shadow over you, it is
 kind of cold. You can go south and east. You could go west but there is
 totally a door in your way. You could go north in the hall but there is
 a baby gate in the way there.

 Zoe stalks in from the east and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

>go south
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 By the Cabinet
 The cabinet that is also like an endtable for the loveseat and the
 couch is here. You can go north back to behind the loveseat.

 Way up on top of the cabinet you see a heavy tumbler.

 Zoe stalks in from the north and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

 Jemison cannot look away from you and the velcro jangly balls.

>push cabinet
 It goes rock rock rock now that there is no paper wedged under it and
 the tumbler tilts like it might fall forward.

>open cabinet
 You go for the door but then Jemison is in front of you reaching for
 the jangly balls and they go jingle jangle when you pull away from him.

>look
 By the Cabinet
 The cabinet that is also like an endtable for the loveseat and the
 couch is here. You can go north back to behind the loveseat.

 Way up on top of the cabinet you see a heavy tumbler.

 Jemison and Zoe are here. Jemison is all staring at the velcro jangly
 balls which you are holding. Zoe has her eye on you.

>put balls on zoe
 You shove the velcro end of the balls against Zoe high on her back
 where she can't reach and the velcro sticks!

 Jemison reaches out and hits the velcro jangly balls that are hanging
 off of Zoe.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>open cabinet
 You reach for the door and Zoe moves to stop you but Jemison gets in
 front of Zoe and reaches for the jangly balls. While she is all dealing
 with him you tug on the door and the baby lock catches, making the
 entire cabinet rock towards you. And as it does so the tumbler tumbles,
 hitting the baby lock and pushing it down before springing off of the
 lock and over your head. The cabinet door pops open and your favorite
 toy rolls out and into your lap!

 Then you hear the crying. When you turn you see a very wet Zoe and a
 very wet Jemison and the empty tumbler is next to them. Jemison takes
 it like a toddler, he is fine, but Zoe is angry like a wet evil cat.
 Heads pop over the top of the loveseat staring down at all of you, one
 of them is Parry and he looks really embarassed.

 You're probably not going to get to keep the toy.
>take toy

 Chapter 3
 Picturetime

 It is like you are psychic because you don't get to keep the toy. The
 mom storms around the couch and scoops you up and grabs the toy. "It's
 okay, Farina," Marion says, "accidents happen. Zoe and Jemison don't
 look hurt, just wet." Several of the other parents are glaring at
 Parry, he looks all sheepish.

 "Since the kids have to be changed anyway, let's take pictures!" Marion
 says.

 "Sure, works for me," Lisa says, and just like that everyone is getting
 their onesies taken off and instead they are being put in these
 Halloween costumes, and that would be okay except your squid costume is
 totally restrictive.

 On the Couch
 You don't get up on the couch all that much but now you are up here
 with everyone else so you can have your pictures taken.

 Becca is all ordering everyone around.

 Parry is standing back a bit watching the picturetime commotion.

 Lisa is staying near Cassie in case she makes a break for it.

 Marion is calm in the face of all this chaos.

 The mom is trying to get all of you together for a picture.

 Jemison and Watson and Cassie and Zoe are here. Jemison is all dressed
 like a bumblebee. Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume.
 Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin costume, it is adorable. Zoe hunkers
 in a ladybug costume like a wolf in cute sheep's clothing.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>save
>cf6
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>score
 You have like 75 points out of 100, in 362 turns.

>bite zoe
 There is no way the parents will believe you had nothing to do with
 hurting her, you'd better leave her alone for now.

 The mom says, "That's an interesting costume Watson's wearing." Watson
 must know he's being talked about, he ducks his head and looks sad.

>eat me
 (first taking yourself)
 With this stupid costume on you cannot take anything, the fake
 tentacles are all in the way.

 "We made it ourselves," Parry replies.

>examine watson
 Watson Mason has this big round face that is perfect for commercials
 and baby food labels, only his face is always tear-streaked so maybe he
 is not cut out for show-biz. Maybe he is sad because he is dressed in
 this costume that is supposed to be a scary bat but instead is like a
 sad dumpy bat.

 Becca laughs all loud. "It's not very cheerful--whoops, hold on there
 Jemison." Zoe must've pushed Jemison because he starts to topple
 sideways before Becca rescues him.

>go down
 You start to move and then there is the mom, she pushes you back in
 place. "Whoa, kiddo, we've got to get a picture of everyone."

 Parry is all huffy, "We wanted something different from the usual."

>examine zoe
 Grr, Zoe Kinmundy. That little red-haired girl has this ladybug costume
 on, it is supposed to be cute but you are not fooled. Her red hair is
 in pigtails, like that will fool anyone into thinking she is nice.

 "Does that thing have buttons? That'll make it fun to take off if he
 spits up on it," Becca laughs again.

>examine cassie
 That is Cassie Sandoval, she is wearing a costume that makes her look
 like a pumpkin. Her arms are scraped up and she has some bruises on her
 legs.

 Cassie bounces up and down next to you and you try to back away from
 her but your tentacles get in your way. "Keep the kids together!" Lisa
 calls, pointing a small camera at all of you.

>examine bumblebee
 The tiny antennas and tiny wings totally make the costume.

 Parry and the mom get you all in place on the couch. The mom dangles
 your favorite toy in front of all of you! You and Zoe stare raptly at
 it and then Parry says "Now!" and it is like a thousand suns explode in
 front of you and all you can see are these white and red spots.

>scream
 The mom says, "We're just taking a couple of pictures, kiddo. Hang in
 there."

 As the spots clear you see Watson has pitched face first into the
 couch. Zoe is busy tugging on Jemison's wings and Cassie is chewing on
 one of your tentacles. "Hope no one wanted another picture!" Becca
 says.

>jump
 There is no way you are going to jump, you can barely crawl.

 The parents give up and take you all off the couch. As the mom puts you
 down she stops by the bookcase and puts your toy up there. "Maybe next
 year they'll sit still," Lisa sighs, and Parry just snorts.

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a squid costume (being worn)

>remove costume
 You cannot see how it comes off, maybe you will be stuck in it forever.

>writhe
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>squirt inky
 I only understood you as far as wanting to squirm.

>squirm
 You wriggle around and that is probably cute and all but it is not
 really helpful.

>cry
 You let out this sobbing wail and the mom says, "Shh, it's okay."

>examine block
 So which do you mean, the tall plastic block, the short plastic block,
 the medium plastic block, or the soft foam block?

>look in diapers
 That is all you in there.

 Small Open Area
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 About half a parent high in the bookcase is your favorite toy.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.

 You can also see a tall plastic block, a short plastic block, a medium
 plastic block, a squishy ball, a plastic cup, a little doll, and a
 much-loved kangaroo here.

 Zoe hunkers in a ladybug costume like a wolf in cute sheep's clothing.

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>examine blookcase
 Books sleep here when they are not being read by the parents. The books
 do not really taste all that good and besides you cannot reach any of
 them now that the bottom bookcase shelves are all empty. From down here
 it is even hard to see the books, they are way up there. Your favorite
 toy is up next to the books about a half a parent high.

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Zoe gets onto the tall plastic block.

>push tall block
 The tall plastic block looks like it will move pretty far but you will
 have to say in what direction you want to push it.

 Zoe makes sad moon-eyes at your favorite toy.

>spin me. use tentacles as helicopter. fly to toy
 You are not chewing on that.

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to se.

>push tall block s
 You start pushing on the tall plastic block but Zoe moves onto it so
 you can't move it, grr.

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>get on small block
 You get onto the short plastic block.

 "Oh my God, you guys," Lisa says, "I almost forgot to tell you! This
 kid in Cassie's class bit her yesterday!"

 Zoe climbs down off of the medium plastic block.

>get on medium block
 (getting off the short plastic block)
 You carefully climb onto the medium plastic block, it is a ways off the
 ground.

 Becca says, "I was always worried that Jemison would be--" and here her
 voice gets real quiet, "a biter." Then she gets loud again, "But he
 never was."

 Zoe grabs a squishy ball.

>get on tall block
 (getting off the medium plastic block)
 You clamber up onto the tall plastic block, you are getting so high.

 "Mine was a biter for a little while," the mom says, that was so three
 months ago, and besides, those kids totally deserved it.

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>examine bookcase
 Books sleep here when they are not being read by the parents. The books
 do not really taste all that good and besides you cannot reach any of
 them now that the bottom bookcase shelves are all empty. Your favorite
 toy is up next to the books about a half a parent high.

 Parry is all, "What do you do if your child does bite other children?"

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you
 are on the higher blocks she looks up at you and makes this annoyed
 face, ha ha, she can suck it.

>get on medium block
 (getting off the tall plastic block)
 You carefully climb onto the medium plastic block, it is a ways off the
 ground.

 "At this age, there's not much you can do," Marion says, "other than
 removing them from the situation." The moms are all silent for a
 moment, they're probably thinking of Allan. He used to be in the
 playgroup but then he started biting people and now he is an unperson
 like Nikolai Yezhov.

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you
 are on the higher blocks she looks up at you and makes this annoyed
 face. Clearly she is waiting for you to go down directly from the
 medium block.

>get on small block
 The short plastic block doesn't have enough room as long as Zoe is
 there.

 "Can you keep them from even biting in the first place?" Lisa asks, and
 Parry follows up with, "It would be nice if the parents were
 controlling their child better."

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you
 are on the higher blocks she looks up at you and makes this annoyed
 face. Clearly she is waiting for you to go down directly from the
 medium block.

 "It's not a matter of control," Marion says, "you can't really control
 a ten-month old."

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

 The mom says, "I'm just glad we aren't still dealing with this
 problem."

 Zoe gets onto the tall plastic block.

>get on medium block

 Zoe pokes the squishy ball towards your favorite toy, she is doing the
 baby equivalent of randomly using everything in your inventory on an
 object.

>get on tall block

 Zoe tosses aside the squishy ball and she picks up a much-loved
 kangaroo.

>examine zoe
 Grr, Zoe Kinmundy. That little red-haired girl has this ladybug costume
 on, it is supposed to be cute but you are not fooled. Her red hair is
 in pigtails, like that will fool anyone into thinking she is nice. She
 has a death-grip on a much-loved kangaroo.

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>examine squid
 It is like a squid if a squid was all plush and powder blue and didn't
 have any suckers. You are wearing it and its tentacles cover your arms
 and hands.

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you
 are on the higher blocks she looks up at you and makes this annoyed
 face.

>examine ladybug
 Black and red and cute all over, though it is not so cute when Zoe is
 wearing it.

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you

 Wow that would end with your face all planted and full of pain, let's
 not do that.

 You don't have speech down yet.

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you

 face.

>wave tentacles
 You shake the squid costume and that is okay I guess.

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you

 face.

>wave tentacles at toy
 I only understood you as far as wanting to wave the squid costume.

>poop
>hit toy with tentacles
 See for you to do that on command you'd have to be potty trained and
 you are not, that is just another way the man controls you.

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you
 are on the higher blocks she looks up at you and makes this annoyed
 face.

 You have short arms, you can't reach your favorite toy from up here.

 The mom says, "The other day when we were out, I saw a mom with her
 toddler on her leash."

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you
 are on the higher blocks she looks up at you and makes this annoyed
 face.

>pee
 See for you to do that on command you'd have to be potty trained and
 you are not, that is just another way the man controls you.

 "What?" Becca says, and the mom is all, "I know! The toddler was
 wearing this monkey backpack and the tail unspooled into a leash that
 the mom held."

 Zoe starts to climb up onto the medium plastic block but then since you

 face.

>get on medium block

 The mom is indignant, "My child is not a dog to be on a leash!" Good
 for her, there is no way you'd wear a leash.

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>go south

 In Front of TV
 The entertainment center here holds the TV all towering above you and
 it has these glass doors beneath the TV that you can see stereo
 equipment through. You are near the couch to the south and the middle
 of the living room to the west and there is a small open area to play
 in to the north.

 There is this baby swing right in front of the TV.

 Lisa says, "When you get down to it, babies are about as smart as pets.
 Cassie might as well be a hyperactive Yorkie."

>push swing n
 It is too heavy for you to move.

 "Lisa!" Marion says. "That's horrible!"

>push swing
 The frame part is too heavy to move and the swing part is too high.

 "It's true!" Lisa says. "They make messes on the floor and can't talk
 and you can classically condition them."

>examine tv
 The TV is blocked by this baby swing that is in the way.

 "You know," Parry says, "A combination playpen and Skinner box might
 sell really well."

>go south

 Couch at the East
 You are where the couch ends here at the east, at least where it ends
 at one end. North is the TV and west is more couch.

 The legs of Marion dangle from the sofa.

 Becca says, "That is the kind of thing people call Child Protective
 Services about."

>go west

 Couch in the Middle
 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 You can also see a brix blox bucket here.

 Cassie and Watson are here. Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin costume,
 it is adorable. Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume.

 "I'm not sure Child Services gets called that often to rescue kids from
 Skinner boxes," Parry says.

>examine bucket
 It is a tall cube that is open on top only the corners are all rounded
 so no babies are harmed in the extracting of the blox from the bucket
 and it is also wider at the top than at the bottom. It is full of these
 lame faker Lego blocks.

 The mom is still all huffy, "Kids aren't pets."

 Cassie babbles happily.

 Watson stares at the brix blox bucket.

>empty bucket
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>take bucket
 With this stupid costume on you cannot take anything, the fake
 tentacles are all in the way.

>kick bucket
 You are way not coordinated enough to do that.

 Cassie says "Pbbbbbth."

>push bucket
 You put your tentacles on the bucket and it wobbles and then it wobbles
 more and look out! it comes crashing down, spilling these dayglo blox
 everywhere and dumping an instruction booklet out.

>look

 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you

 You can also see a building instructions booklet, a pile of dayglo
 blox, and a brix blox bucket here.

 Cassie and Watson are here. Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin costume,
 it is adorable. Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume.

 Watson flops the instruction booklet open and it opens to a page that
 shows you how to build a helicopter.

 Jemison comes in from the north.

>examine booklet
 The booklet tells you how to build stuff out of the blox, you've never
 really used it. It is flopped open right now and is showing this
 helicopter. It involves these complex blades and gears and stuff on the
 page.

 Cassie says "Eeeeeee eeee ee-ah!"

>build helicopter
 You look at the instructions but man, they are way complex. This is the
 kind of thing you hire people to do instead of bothering yourself.

 Cassie babbles happily.

>examine booklet
 The booklet tells you how to build stuff out of the blox, you've never
 really used it. It is flopped open right now and is showing this
 helicopter. It involves these complex blades and gears and stuff on the
 page.

 Watson looks at the instruction booklet and his hands move so fast they
 are almost blurry and the dayglo blox go together and suddenly Watson
 has built a helicopter. He looks at it and then drops it, he is so
 going to grow up to be an engineer and like online games and in his
 spare time I bet he will LARP.

>take helicopter
 With this stupid costume on you cannot take anything, the fake
 tentacles are all in the way.

 Jemison puts his mouth all over the brix blox bucket. He looks pretty
 thoughtful when he does that.

>examine helicopter
>lick tentacle
 You are small and all but this is even smaller and it is a shame you
 cannot get in it and fly it around.

 Watson picks up the helicopter and takes it apart and dumps the brix
 into the big pile.

 You taste nothing unexpected.

 It is fixed in place.

 "Hey, Parry," Lisa says, "Watson seems a little out-of-sorts today. I
 saw you had to put him in the swing when he was crying."

 Watson picks up the helicopter and takes it apart and dumps the brix
 into the big pile.

 Jemison puts his mouth all over the pile of dayglo blox. He looks
 pretty thoughtful when he does that.

 Hitting and pushing and pulling other babies when you're in front of
 parents is no good, they willl take you away and you won't get your
 toy.

 Parry sighs. "Shari's parents were here this weekend."

 Cassie crawls in from the northeast.

 Watson looks at the instruction booklet and his hands move so fast they
 are almost blurry and the dayglo blox go together and suddenly Watson
 has built a helicopter. He looks at it and then drops it.

>put watson in swing
 You can't reach into the In Front of TV.

 "Let me guess," says the mom, "they carried Watson everywhere and
 played with him and wouldn't leave him alone, and now he's upset you're
 not doing the same."

>go west

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a
 loveseat to the north and more couch to the east.

 Lisa's legs are hanging off of the couch.

 You can also see a soft foam block and a rattly car here.

 "Exactly!" Parry exclaims. "How'd you know?"

>go north

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 "Detox!" Lisa and Becca and Marion chorus.

>go east

 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 "You must not talk to many other parents," Becca says. "It's nice when
 the grandparents visit and give you a break, but when they leave, oh
 boy!"

 Jemison comes in from the south.

>cry
 When you cry again the mom says, "Shh. Calm down."

 Parry says, "I can't believe the same thing happens to all of you! How
 do you keep it from happening?"

>go west

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 "You can keep your parents from visiting Watson," Marion says.
 "Otherwise, no, there's no real prevention."

>go north

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Shoved half-under the loveseat is a remote control.

 Those are Parry's feet dangling from the loveseat.

 The mom says, "Be glad they love Watson as much as they do."

>pull up on loveseat
 You would but the tentacles of your stupid squid costume are too slick.
 You really have to get someone to take this costume off for you.

 "Yeah. Yeah!" Parry says.

>examine remote
 This is the remote control that lets parents turn on the TV as if they
 have big stretchy arms that can reach the television from anywhere in
 the room. You could use it to turn on the TV if you were ancient, like
 three years old or something.

>rub eyes
 You can't see any such thing.

>turn on tv
 The television is to the east and so is way too far away for that.

>turn on remote
 The remote control is too advanced for you, it is the kind of thing
 adults use.

 In Front of TV
 The entertainment center here holds the TV all towering above you and
 it has these glass doors beneath the TV that you can see stereo
 equipment through. You are near the couch to the south and the middle
 of the living room to the west and there is a small open area to play
 in to the north.

 There is this baby swing right in front of the TV.

 Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin costume, it is adorable.

 Cassie falls forward onto her hands and then she is crawling off to the
 southwest.

>examine swing
 It is this a-frame thing with a swing in the middle and a speed switch
 way up there. When the speed switch is all the way up boy does that
 swing go high, nearly high enough to kick a parent in the head if you
 were that kind of baby. It is supposed to be this cheerful baby plaid
 but instead it is this weird lumberjack-like plaid.

>turn switch
 You have short arms, you can't reach the speed switch from down here.

 "Did anyone see last night's episode of "Beat"?" Parry says.

>go north

 Small Open Area
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 About half a parent high in the bookcase is your favorite toy.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.

 You can also see a much-loved kangaroo, a little doll, a squishy ball,
 a tall plastic block, a short plastic block (on which is Zoe), and a
 medium plastic block here.

 "Is that the Boston cop show?" Becca asks.

 Zoe climbs down off of the short plastic block.

>go east
 You so can't go that way.

 "Oh my God, who has time for TV?" Lisa asks. "Besides, I can't watch
 something that violent when Cassie's up, even if she'd let me leave her
 alone.

 Zoe drops the plastic cup and she picks up a much-loved kangaroo.

>go west

 By the Rocking Chair
 The gliding rocking chair is all tall and wooden. It is where the mom
 rocks you when she thinks you need a nap even though you do not need
 naps. The loveseat is west and there is a small open area to the east
 and a big open area in the middle of the room to the south.

 There are Becca's legs, they are by the rocking chair.

 You can also see a teething ring, a plush book, a teeny squeezy book,
 and a smooth rock here.

 The mom says, "I don't have a lot of time for TV either. Besides Sesame
 Street, that is," and the parents all laugh, why are they dissing the
 Street?

>go south

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 Becca sighs. "I always feel guilty when I set Jemison in front of the
 TV so I can get some work done."

>go northwest

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Shoved half-under the loveseat is a remote control.

 Those are Parry's feet dangling from the loveseat.

 "I don't allow Zoe to watch much television," Marion says, "though she
 does watch some."

>pull remote
>rub squid on safety pin
 Nothing obvious happens.

 Parry says, "We did consider not letting Watson see any TV until he's
 two or so."

 I only understood you as far as wanting to rub the squid costume.

>go west

 Behind the Loveseat
 Back here is the back of the loveseat casting a shadow over you, it is
 kind of cold. You can go south and east. You could go west but there is
 totally a door in your way. You could go north in the hall but there is
 a baby gate in the way there.

 "You're not one of those no-TV nuts, are you?" Lisa says all
 sharpishly.

>go south

 By the Cabinet
 The cabinet that is also like an endtable for the loveseat and the
 couch is here. You can go north back to behind the loveseat.

 "They're not nuts," Parry says, you can tell he's annoyed. "In fact,
 they make a lot of sense."

>zoe, unzip me
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>examine cabinet
 The cabinet is wood like a lot of other furniture in here because the
 parents like wood or something, maybe they are tree huggers but only if
 the trees have been cut down and planed and shaped. Anyway it has this
 door in it which is closed.

 "Whatever," Lisa sniffs, and the mom says, "Remember, watch what you
 say about religion, politics, and TV."

>go south
 You so can't go that way.

>go west
 You so can't go that way.

>drool on tentacles
 You reach deep down inside you and bring up some of those stupid prunes
 the mom was feeding you and spit them up on the squid costume, making
 it all dirty.

>go north

 Those are Parry's feet dangling from the loveseat.

>pull up on parry
 You rub up against the legs of Parry, who sees that you are dirty and
 says "Uh, Farina," and hands you over to the mom. The mom takes you and
 says, "Oh, oh, your costume is all dirty, kiddo," and the next thing
 you know you are back on the ground and free of that evil squid
 costume.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

>examine remote
 This is the remote control that lets parents turn on the TV as if they
 have big stretchy arms that can reach the television from anywhere in
 the room. You could use it to turn on the TV if you were ancient, like
 three years old or something.

>push remote

 adults use.

 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 You can also see a helicopter, a building instructions booklet (open to
 some helicopter instructions), a pile of dayglo blox, and a brix blox
 bucket here.

 Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume.

>examine bat costume
 You can see how someone would think this was a fun idea but man, it
 just makes Watson look like a giant emo cupid.

>put remote in pile
 That so can't contain stuff.

 Watson picks up the helicopter and takes it apart and dumps the brix
 into the big pile.

>drop remote
 Dropped.

>put remote in pile
 You need to be holding the remote control before you can put it into
 something else.

 Watson looks at the instruction booklet and his hands move so fast they
 are almost blurry and the dayglo blox go together and suddenly Watson
 has built a helicopter. He looks at it and then drops it.

>examine bucket
 It is a tall cube that is open on top only the corners are all rounded
 so no babies are harmed in the extracting of the blox from the bucket
 and it is also wider at the top than at the bottom. It is lying on its
 side.

 Cassie zips in from the west.

 Cassie babbles happily.

>put remote in pile

>examine cassie
 That is Cassie Sandoval, she is wearing a costume that makes her look
 like a pumpkin. Her arms are scraped up and she has some bruises on her
 legs.

 Watson looks at the instruction booklet and his hands move so fast they
 are almost blurry and the dayglo blox go together and suddenly Watson
 has built a nuclear reactor model. He looks at it and then drops it.

>examine model
 The little scoop in the back for loading in the enriched uranium is a
 nice touch.

 Watson picks up the nuclear reactor model and takes it apart and dumps
 the brix into the big pile.

>take poosh stick
 You pick it up and it takes two hands.

 Watson tries to build a poosh stick but he doesn't have enough blox.

>examine stick
 The parents call this a poosh stick because they think you are stupid
 and need baby talk, it is really a push stick. It is a stick for
 pushing things around. I guess the blox makers wanted easier and easier
 things to make and someone said, "Hey, I know what would be easy to
 build, a long stick." The stick is nearly two babies long, it's amazing
 that it holds together.

 Zoe eyes you coldly, no way she is taking anything from you.

 Zoe starts to climb down onto the medium plastic block but then since
 you are on the lower blocks she looks down at you and makes this

 the medium block.

 "You're not going to calm down, are you, kiddo? Do you need the swing?"

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>cry
 "Okay, kiddo, let's check you and make sure," the mom says and scoops
 you up. "Diaper's okay. You're not hungry. To the swing!" You're
 airlifted into the swing and the mom takes away the poosh stick and
 straps you in. She turns it on, click click click, and then you are
 swinging really high.

 Small Open Area (in the baby swing)
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 About half a parent high in the bookcase is your favorite toy.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.

 You can also see a poosh stick, a plastic cup, a much-loved kangaroo, a
 tall plastic block, a short plastic block, and a medium plastic block
 (on which is Zoe) here.

 Jemison is all dressed like a bumblebee.

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it. At the top of the
 swing you are way close to your toy.

 Zoe gets onto the tall plastic block.

>take toy
 You stretch for the toy but it is just barely out of reach.

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it. At the top of the
 swing you are way close to your toy.

 Zoe watches you swing back and forth, back and forth.

>take toy with stick
 I only understood you as far as wanting to take your favorite toy.

>push toy with stick
 With you strapped into the swing you cannot reach the poosh stick.

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it. At the top of the

 Jemison picks up the plastic cup.

>jump
 You are strapped into the swing and that keeps you from jumping to your
 pain if not death.

 Parry comes wandering by with his water glass but he stops when he sees
 you swinging. He looks at your favorite toy. He looks at you. He looks
 at your toy. He looks at Zoe. He looks at how close you get to your
 favorite toy. When he is all done with his looking he casually leans
 against the bookcase and taps your toy. It totally falls a bit closer!
 He winks at you and heads on by.

>maybe put the stick in the swing first?
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>take toy
 You stretch your arms but they are still too much like teeny T. Rex
 arms so then you scrunch down in your swing and stretch out a leg and
 as you swoop up again you just are able to kick the toy! It flies into
 the air and onto your lap! But as you swing back Zoe leans over from
 the tall block and swats at the toy and you swat at her and the upshot
 is the toy goes flying again and it goes kerplunk into the playpen.

 This is the worst playdate ever.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>cry
 You have already gotten in the baby swing, crying will do you no good
 now.

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it.

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

 You look up and there is the mom, you are swinging toward her face and
 away, toward and away. She turns off the swing and gets you down and
 puts you on the floor before going back to her seat.

 There is a big old baby swing all shoved up against the bookcase.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.
 Through the mesh you can see your favorite toy.

 You can also see a squishy ball, a poosh stick, a much-loved kangaroo,
 a tall plastic block, a short plastic block, and a medium plastic block

 Jemison is all dressed like a bumblebee.

 This is the thing your aunt gave you which is a super fun toy. It has
 places to chew and places that are shiny and it rattles when you shake
 it.

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>look in playpen
 In the northeast part of the playpen is your favorite toy.

 Zoe climbs down off of the short plastic block.

 Jemison carefully picks up the squishy ball.

>take foam
 The soft foam block is by the west end of the couch to the southwest
 and so is way too far away for that.

 Zoe tosses the little doll aside. Jemison sees Zoe drop the little doll
 and is all excited and lets go of a squishy ball and takes the little
 doll instead.

>go to foam
 You can't see any such thing.

>go southwest

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 Zoe comes in and looks sadly at the playpen.

>go southwest

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a

 Zoe comes in and sighs heavily.

>take stick
 The poosh stick is big enough that you will have to drop everything to
 get it because it takes two hands.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a soft foam block

>drop block
 Dropped.

>take stick
 You pick it up and it takes two hands.

 Jemison chews on the little doll.

>get toy with stick
 I only understood you as far as wanting to get your favorite toy.

>open playpen
 You have short arms, you can't reach the top oval from down here.

>open playpen with stick
 (the northeast part of the playpen with the poosh stick)
 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

 Zoe looks at the playpen.

>open playpoen with stick
 (the northeast part of the playpen with the poosh stick)
 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

 Jemison pulls the little doll out of his mouth.

>push oval with stick
 You get the poosh stick into position under the oval and push the oval
 up with it and it goes up a bit and clicks but when you let go it drops
 back into place. I guess you need to push up the oval at both ends of
 the playpen at the same time.

 Zoe coughs and you look at her and she looks at you and you both look
 at the top oval of the playpen. It is like you are communicating
 telepathically and that communication is "I may despise you and all
 that you stand for but I will work with you in order to lift the oval
 and free the toy but after that it is every baby for him or herself."
 So you nod and she nods and it is a deal.

 Becca says, "That's a bad cough Zoe has. Is she getting sick?" but
 Marion says, "No, she coughs like that sometimes to get attention."

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

 Jemison chews on the little doll.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Zoe gets onto the tall plastic block.

>push oval with stick
 You move the stick into position to push the top oval and nearly hit
 Zoe on the nose, she looks down at you as if you are an idiot both for
 nearly hitting her and for pushing the oval up on the side where she
 already is.

>push up on oval with stick
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine playpen
 This portable playpen is all old, probably it should be recalled except
 that the parents are way cheap. It is this frame made of metal bars and
 it has mesh sides and a floor for babies to play on. The bars go around
 in ovals at the top and bottom. It should be recalled because the top
 oval is hinged and you can lower one side of the playpen by pushing the
 top bar up and then letting go so that the mesh comes down.

 You hear this cough, it is Zoe trying to get your attention.

>examine zoe
 Grr, Zoe Kinmundy. That little red-haired girl has this ladybug costume
 on, it is supposed to be cute but you are not fooled. Her red hair is
 in pigtails, like that will fool anyone into thinking she is nice.

 You hear this cough, it is Zoe trying to get your attention.

>push bar with stick
 You push on the oval with the poosh stick and at the same time Zoe
 pushes her end of the oval and it clicks up and then half of it falls
 down. That leaves the playpen all gaping open!

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast. The
 playpen is all open.

 You hear this rattle jingle, it is Zoe playing with your toy!

>go south

 Couch in the Middle
 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 You can also see a building instructions booklet (open to some wall
 instructions), a pile of dayglo blox, and a brix blox bucket here.

 Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume.

>drop wall
 Dropped.

 Watson picks up the wall and takes it apart and dumps the brix into the
 big pile.

>turn page
 You flip the pages by scrabbling at them until you are looking at this
 blocky diagram of a poosh stick.

>examine diagram
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine legs
 When the mom is all sitting down she does not tower so much over you
 but she is still pretty big.

>examine pile
 A big pile of dayglo blox from the brix blox bucket. Some are one hand
 wide and some are two hands wide and some are three hands wide and I
 guess they go together in various ways but whatever, you are no
 engineer.

 Watson looks at the instruction booklet and his hands move so fast they
 are almost blurry and the dayglo blox go together and suddenly Watson
 has built a poosh stick. He looks at it and then drops it.

>take stick
 You pick it up and it takes two hands.

>go northwest

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 Cassie and Zoe are here. Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin costume, it
 is adorable. Zoe has your toy! ZOE HAS YOUR TOY!

>go west
 You so can't go that way.

 Zoe pushes her way past babies and runs off to the southeast with your
 toy!

>go north

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 On the north pink striped loveseat is a cup of Cheerios.

 You can see a little doll and Parry here.

>take cheerios
 You have short arms, you can't reach the cup of Cheerios from down
 here.

 You hear this rattle jingle, it is Zoe playing with your toy!

>take cheerios with stick
 I only understood you as far as wanting to take the cup of Cheerios.

>push cheerios
 You have short arms, you can't reach the cup of Cheerios from down
 here.

>get arms from mover 5
 You can't see any such thing.

>push cheerios with stick
 You reach up with the stick and whack the cup and all of these Cheerios
 shower down around you in a big pile.

 It is as if the oxygen in the room goes foom like there was a flash
 fire and suddenly there are all of these babies headed your way.

 Cassie crawls in from the south.

>examine zoe
 (tearing yourself away from the Cheerios)
 Grr, Zoe Kinmundy. That little red-haired girl has this ladybug costume
 on, it is supposed to be cute but you are not fooled. Her red hair is
 in pigtails, like that will fool anyone into thinking she is nice. She
 has a death-grip on your favorite toy. She is at the middle of the
 couch to the southeast.

 Watson wanders in from the south.

 Jemison crawls in from the southeast.

>se
 (tearing yourself away from the Cheerios)
 You have to push your way past Jemison, Watson, and Cassie thanks to
 those Cheerios and that slows you down.

 Those sure are a bunch of Cheerios spilled everywhere.

 You can also see a little doll and Parry here.

 Zoe and Jemison and Watson and Cassie are here. Zoe has your toy! ZOE
 HAS YOUR TOY! Jemison is all dressed like a bumblebee. Watson is gloomy
 in his sad homemade bat costume. Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin
 costume, it is adorable.

 Cassie takes some Cheerios and eats them.

 Jemison considers the pile of Cheerios and then he takes some Cheerios
 and munches on them.

>take toy
 Zoe tries to crawl away, but there are babies and Cheerios and it is a
 big train-wreck and she cannot get away!

 Your hands are all full, maybe if you drop something you could get your
 favorite toy.

 Zoe somehow ignores the Cheerios and pushes her way past babies who
 don't move very fast because of the Cheerios and runs off to the
 southeast with your toy!

 Watson gingerly takes a single Cheerio and then he eats it.

>undo
 Loveseat at the North
 [Previous turn undone.]

>drop all

 Dropped.

 Zoe somehow ignores the Cheerios and pushes her way past babies who
 don't move very fast because of the Cheerios and runs off to the west
 with your toy!

 Jemison picks up some Cheerios and munches on them.

 Zoe screws up her face and bursts into these loud wails, they are so
 terribly loud. She shoves at Cassie who also starts crying and soon
 just about everyone is crying except you, ha ha, they are such babies.

 Marion says, "I was afraid we were staying too late past Zoe's naptime.
 Farina, everyone, it's been fun, and glad you could come, Parry. See
 everyone next week." Hands come down and the squalling Zoe zips up into
 the air and into Marion's arms. Soon all of the babies are going
 skywards, parentwards, and out-the-doorwards.

 With them all gone the air kinda leaks out of you, it has been a long
 playdate. The mom gathers you and your favorite toy up. "C'mon, kid,
 let's get you to bed before you completely pass out." But you do not
 need naps, does she not understand that?

 Though your crib is nice and soft and your favorite toy chimes a bit as
 you curl around it and your teeny eyelids are so heavy.

 So...heavy....

 Smothered in Darkness
 It is dark and stuffy and you are covered over, something is all draped
 over you, it is enough to make you crazy.

>f commentary on
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>commentary on
 Commentary track on[1]. To read commentary track notes, type NOTE #.

>note 1
 Welcome to the commentary track of Child's Play! I'm your author and
 host, Stephen Granade. In this track, I'll be talking about design
 decisions I made, some of my goals in writing the game, and fun things
 to try.

>cry
 Suddenly the darkness is gone, and it is so light, you are blinded for
 just a second. You blink and blink and then you can see the mom holding
 the blanket she was covering you with. "Oh, kid, I'm so sorry, I
 thought you were having fun," she says. "We'll do something else."

 That'll teach her[2].

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. But it
 would be bigger and vaster if there weren't all these pillows and stuff
 in a big ring around you. The mom is totally all paranoid and whatever,
 she is a new mom.

 There is a red footstool, it looms over you.

 The mom[3] is playing with you and is all excited about it.

 You can also see a squishy ball, a plush book, and your favorite toy
 here.

 You eye your favorite toy and the mom sees you doing it and scoops it
 up. "No, no, we're going to try pulling up!" She is all the time trying
 to build your character or something. She waves the toy at you. "Look!
 Look where I'm putting it!" She drops the toy on the footstool where
 you can't see it unless you're all pulled up, that is just no fair[4].

>note 2
 Crying is a great baby way of manipulating parents.

>note 3
 The protagonist doesn't really think of the parents in a possessive
 way. They're just people who provide food and toys.

>note 4
 The major conceit of the game is that the player is a baby, and must
 interact with the world as a baby. That leaves the player with a
 limited range of actions. Sadly, unless you've become a parent
 recently, you've probably forgotten what it's like to be a baby and
 what a baby does. That's why the game has to re-teach you babies'
 limited actions, like pulling up[5].

>note 5
 By the way, you should wait for a while and frustrate the mom.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The mom sits there looking at you all expectantly.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The mom points to the footstool. "Give it a try! Go ahead! Pull up!"

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The mom sighs and is all "You were pulling up just yesterday[6]."

>note 6
 Sometimes it seems that kids exist to prove their parents don't know
 what they're talking about.

>pull up on stool
 You pull yourself up and it is one hand and another hand which is hard
 because the footstool is all unstable and rocks some but then you are
 all on your feet so yay you! And now that you are up here you can see
 your favorite toy on the footstool.

 The mom applauds, "Way to go!" She looks at her watch and is all
 "Whoops! Playgroup's about to arrive. You hang out here while mom goes
 and gets ready." She stands up and steps over all of those pillows and
 you are stuck here now by yourself[7].

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>note 7
 One of the fun things about parenthood is figuring out how to contain
 your kids so you can run off and do chores or other necessary things
 like World of Warcraft.

>examine toy
 This is the thing your aunt gave you[8] which is a super fun toy. It
 has places to chew and places that are shiny and it rattles when you
 shake it.

>note 8
 Later your aunt will give you a thing you don't know what it is.

>take toy
 You cannot reach your favorite toy because you are standing and if you
 let go with one hand you would just plop down before you could get it.

>sit
 You sit down on your diaper and it is good that it is all padded and
 stuff.

>push stool
 You push on the footstool and it rocks and you pull on the footstool
 and it rocks and then you hear stuff fall off it! But the stuff fell
 outside the ring of pillows[9].

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>note 9
 Babies are notorious for trying to pull up on things and instead
 accidentally pushing them or knocking them over. This initial footstool
 puzzle serves to introduce the push-on-things mechanic in a setting
 where there's little else to do.

>take toy
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine pillows
 The ring is a bunch of pillows and stuff piled around in a circle so
 you can't go crawling away when the mom is all distracted. The whole
 thing is taller than you even when you are sitting.

 Hey wait, what is Alfadog doing wedged in the pillows like that?

>examine alfadog
 It is Alfadog, your alphabet-knowing toy and it is all wedged under
 some pillows. He is about as long as you and he is about as tall as you
 when you are crawling, it is as if he is your brother only he is a dog.
 He has this switch on him that makes him run and say the alphabet and
 such.

>turn on alfadog
 You are all fumbly on the switch but then you get it turned on and look
 out! Alfadog lights up and his paws start digging in and he is barking
 out "A! B! C! D! EFG!" It looks like he may be stuck under those
 pillows but then "L! M! N! O! P!" pillows tumble out of his way and he
 is free, zipping off to the east! You hear him winding down, "W X Y and
 Zeee....." And now there is this big gap in the pillows to the east.

 That Alfadog is very powerful, he should probably be recalled[10].

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

 A theme of the game is the PC getting others, both animate and
 inanimate, to do his or her bidding.

>go east
 In Front of TV
 The entertainment center here holds the TV all towering above you and
 it has these glass doors beneath the TV that you can see stereo
 equipment through. You are near the couch to the south and the middle
 of the living room to the west and there is a small open area to play
 in to the north[11].

 You can see Alfadog and your favorite toy here.

>note 11
 I entered this first part of the game in Introcomp 2006. The
 competition helped, as it really made me think about what I wanted the
 player to see in the first few moves. I wanted to have a few simple
 puzzles that nevertheless depended on baby-like actions, introduce the
 writing style I'd chosen, and have a very clear direction. The last was
 critical -- without that throughline, players are increasingly likely
 to type QUIT.

>take toy
 You pick it up.

 There is a ding-dong and the mom comes clattering in all "Hang on! I'm
 coming!" She opens the door and there is Marion Kinmundy here for
 playgroup. She is carrying that little red haired girl Zoe who started
 coming to playgroup a couple of whiles ago. Zoe sees your favorite toy
 and her eyes light up.

 The mom must be psychic or something because she whirls around and
 snatches up your favorite toy. "Oh, no," she says with a little laugh,
 "we're not having you two fight over this thing again. I'll tuck it
 away where it'll be safe." And Marion laughs too, which is cool, that
 way they don't notice you and the little red haired girl glaring at
 each other.

 She wants your toy? And the mom wants to lock the toy away? Bring it
 on[12].
>note 12

 Chapter 1
 Playtime

 Right behind Marion and Zoe the little red haired girl is Lisa who is
 Cassie's mom. Lisa is carrying Cassie all carefully but Cassie is
 squirming to get down. "Hi Farina, hi Marion--hang on Cassie, mommy's
 going to put you down," Lisa says and then she steps over the baby gate
 and dumps Cassie by the couch to the south of you.

 Meanwhile the mom is putting all the pillows back on the couch and
 loveseat. As she finishes she asks Marion, "Can I put this toy in Zoe's
 backpack for now?" Marion is all "Sure!" as she puts Zoe on the floor
 over by the rocking chair and sits on the loveseat.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>note 12
 I like games with an antagonist. Wandering around exploring is fine,
 but it's nice to be working against someone. With that said, I wanted
 Zoe to start out passively working against you, in effect pursuing her
 own separate agenda, only working directly against you as the game went
 on.

>examine toy
 Your toy is inside Zoe's backpack so you cannot really see it.

>examine backpack
 Zoe's backpack has all these cute bears sewed on it. Clearly her mom
 Marion picked it out, it does not reek of evil like it would if Zoe had
 chosen it. It is closed so you can't see what's in it though you know
 your toy is in there somewhere. It is next to the gliding rocking chair
 to the northwest[13].

>note 13
 Lucian Smith suggested that you be able to examine things in other
 "rooms" within the large living room. It was an extremely handy
 addition to the game, since then I could see where things were and go
 to them. Shame it was such a headache to implement. I managed to get it
 working for this small game, but I'd hate to try it for a larger game.

>examine tv
 The TV is dark and that makes you sad.

>go northwest

 By the Rocking Chair
 The gliding rocking chair is all tall and wooden. It is where the mom
 rocks you when she thinks you need a nap even though you do not need
 naps. The loveseat is west and there is a small open area to the east
 and a big open area in the middle of the room to the south.

 A backpack with bears on and your favorite toy in it is shoved behind
 the rocking chair next to the wall[14].

 You can also see a smooth rock here.

 Zoe is sitting in a fog of grump on the floor.

 There is a ding-dong! and the mom goes and opens the front door. It is
 Becca and her son Jemison and some strange guy is there holding Watson
 Mason. "Come on in, everyone," the mom says. She turns to the strange
 guy, "I'm glad you could make it, Parry[15]."

 Parry shrugs and smiles and says, "I always wondered what everyone did
 during playgroup."

 "Drink mimosas[16]!" Becca says over her shoulder to Parry and there is
 polite laughter and Parry smiles like he is kinda unsure about all of
 this.

 "Why don't you put Watson in here with the others?" the mom asks and
 Parry nods. He ends up putting Watson by Jemison over by the loveseat.
 Then all the standing adults sit down with Parry sitting near you so
 now I guess they are sitting adults.

>note 14
 Admiral Jota is a madman and managed to break the backpack puzzle by
 the judicious use of TAKE ALL, requiring me to fiddle the rules
 regarding what's included in ALL.

>note 15
 Parry's the foil to the rest of the group. He's an outsider and can
 thus make comments that are probably closer to your reactions to the
 groups' comments. Plus he does things the more experienced moms don't.

>note 16
 While the playmates' parents aren't based on specific people, the bit
 about mimosas is based on an actual playgroup Misty went to.

>open backpack
 You would but Parry is rocking, rocking, rocking, and you can't reach
 under the rocking chair to get to the backpack while he is rocking,
 rocking, rocking.

>examine parry
 That is Parry Mason, he is Watson Mason's dad. Normally Watson's mom
 Shari is here but she must be somewhere else so that is why Parry is
 here.

>go southwest

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 Those are Becca's legs by the loveseat.

 You can also see a rattly car here.

 Jemison and Watson are here. Jemison watches you watching him. Watson
 sits all sad and dumpy on the floor. [17]

 Watson gingerly picks up the rattly car[18]. When Jemison sees Watson
 take the rattly car, he gets all excited and he starts watching the
 rattly car and thus Watson[19].

 Watson puts down the rattly car. Jemison suddenly sees that the rattly
 car is available and he scoops it up.

>note 17
 Many turns there's a heck of a lot of text printed as parents talk and
 playmates romp around. To cut down on how many paragraphs are printed,
 I collated the descriptions of the playmates into a single paragraph.

>note 18
 I randomized the babies' behavior and action descriptions to keep
 things fresh. It also made debugging a nightmare. NPCs suck; randomized
 NPCs suck more.

>note 19
 Babies are all the time becoming fascinated by what other babies do.
 Stupid babies.

>go north

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west except that a baby gate is in the way. There is the rocking
 chair to the east as well, that is always fun.

 The legs of Marion dangle from the loveseat.

>examine marion
 Grr, Marion Kinmundy. She is Zoe's mom. Grr, Zoe. What is weird is that
 Marion is all nice while Zoe is pure evil.

>se

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 You can also see a plush book here.

>take book
 You pick it up and it takes two hands.

 You can hear Zoe squalling all loudly by the gliding rocking chair.

>go west

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 Those are Becca's legs by the loveseat.

 Jemison and Watson are here. Jemison is playing with the rattly car.
 Watson sits all sad and dumpy on the floor.

 Watson pulls up on Becca who says "Watch the pants, kid!" and she
 laughs and puts him back on the floor.

>drop book
 Dropped.

 Watson pulls up on Becca who says "Watch the pants, kid!" and she
 laughs and puts him back on the floor.

>take book
 When Jemison sees you take the plush book, his eyes light up and he
 starts watching the plush book and thus yourself.

 Watson gingerly picks up the rattly car.

>go northeast

 By the Rocking Chair
 The gliding rocking chair is all tall and wooden. It is where the mom
 rocks you when she thinks you need a nap even though you do not need
 naps. The loveseat is west and there is a small open area to the east
 and a big open area in the middle of the room to the south.

 Parry's feet keep leaving the floor as he rocks.

 A backpack with bears on and your favorite toy in it is shoved behind
 the rocking chair next to the wall.

 You can also see a smooth rock here.

 Zoe has hold of a much-loved kangaroo loosely.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the plush book.

 "Say, how's Watson's rash doing?" Lisa asks Parry.

 Parry clears his throat. "He's much better, thanks."[20]

>note 20
 All of the parents' conversations are exaggerated versions of
 conversations and arguments that parents really have.

>put book in mouth
 (the plush book in mouth)
 You shove the plush book in your mouth and start chewing on it and that
 feels good.

 The mom says, "Did you use zinc oxide cream?"

>pull up on parry
 Even though you are chewing on the plush book it is big enough that you
 still have to keep it in your hands and so you can't pull up while you
 have it, if only the plush book were smaller you would have your hands
 free.

 "In a roundabout way," Parry says, "We used Boudreaux's butt
 paste[21]."

 Zoe looks at the much-loved kangaroo and she sighs.

>note 21
 <A HREF=".">http://www.buttpaste.com/.</A> Ask for it by name!

>drop book
 (popping the plush book out of your mouth first)
 When you drop the plush book Jemison is all over that and he snatches
 it up.

 "Ew," Becca laughs, "that is the grossest name for a product."

 Watson wanders in from the southwest.

>examine foam
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine stone
 The mom found this one one of your walks, well it wasn't really a walk,
 more like the mom driving you around in a stroller, anyway she found
 this rock and gave it to you.

 Marion tells Becca, "Given what we have to deal with from our children,
 a name like that is the least of our worries."

>take stone
 When Jemison sees you pick up the smooth rock, he gets all excited and
 he gets rid of a plush book and starts watching the smooth rock and
 thus yourself.

 Zoe pulls at the much-loved kangaroo but then she stops, she is so
 bored with it.

>put stone in mouth
 You shove the smooth rock in your mouth and start chewing on it and
 that leaves your hands free[22].

>note 22
 Babies are all the time chewing on things. They also -- and I swear
 this is true -- chew on things to get around their inventory limit.

>pull up on parry
 As soon as you have pulled up on the gliding rocking chair Parry looks
 down and says "Hey, there, you want to be picked up?" and he lifts you
 into his lap and stops rocking. If you were on the ground you could get
 to the backpack now. And then Jemison pulls up on the gliding rocking
 chair and looks up at you and grunts softly.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>drop stone
 (popping the smooth rock out of your mouth first)
 The smooth rock falls into Parry's lap.

 Zoe takes the much-loved kangaroo and shakes it half-heartedly.

 Watson picks up the plush book.

>squirm
 You wriggle and fuss a bit and Parry says, "Okay, down you go," and he
 gently lowers you to the floor. He then is all "And now it's your turn"
 and he picks Jemison up[23].

>note 23
 This is the first example of the ongoing theme of using other people to
 do your bidding (assuming Alfadog doesn't count).

>open backpack
 When you open the backpack all you can see in it is this white onesie
 that is totally in your way.

 Zoe sees you open that backpack and she gets agitated and tosses the
 much-loved kangaroo aside.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>take onsie
 You pull on the onesie and it comes part of the way out of the backpack
 and then it gets hung on the backpack zipper. Great. Now it is blocking
 the backpack and it is also stuck[24].

 Watson puts the plush book down.

>note 24
 Babies have this unerring sense of what they shouldn't be playing with
 and a nearly-unstoppable drive to mess with things they shouldn't be
 touching.

>take book
 You pick it up and it takes two hands.

 Zoe shrieks angrily and bounces up and down and flails her arms in the
 general direction of the backpack that you opened. That makes Marion
 sigh and she says, "Parry, if you don't mind?" So Marion reaches the
 backpack under the rocking chair and she sees the white onesie stuck in
 the backpack. "Geez," she says and pulls out a plastic cup and dumps it
 in Zoe's lap. Zoe gets all upset but Marion says, "Shh, Zoe, be calm, I
 can't fix the backpack if you're fussing." Parry says, "Here, I'll
 empty out the backpack and fix that for you" but Marion says "No,
 thanks," and she sits down and starts trying to get the onesie out of
 the backpack.

 Parry says, "Okay, down you go" to Jemison who scrabbles around and
 grabs the smooth rock. Parry gently lowers Jemison to the floor and
 starts rocking again.

>give book to zoe
 (the plush book to Zoe)
 Zoe shrieks at you and shoves the plush book out of your hands and hits
 at you. Marion sees that and she reacts in a flash and says "Parry,
 here," and shoves the backpack at Parry who takes it. "Can you get that
 onesie out of the way?" Parry just nods and digs in the backpack and
 pulls out your favorite toy and dumps it in his lap! Then he starts
 tugging the onesie this way and that to free it from the implacable
 jaws of the backpack zipper. Meanwhile Marion shushes Zoe before
 sitting back on the loveseat[25].

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>note 25
 Babies are masters at destroying the flow of your actions and plans.
 Eventually you learn how to break your plans up into tiny chunks
 separated by what you have to do for your kid.

>handnote
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>pull up on parry
 As soon as you have pulled up on the gliding rocking chair Parry looks
 down and says "Hey, there, you want to be picked up?" and he lifts you
 into his lap and stops rocking.

>take toy
 You pick it up.

 Parry says, "Okay, down you go," and he gently lowers you to the floor,
 right next to Zoe. Zoe looks over and sees what you have in your hands
 and she goes totally nuts, she is shrieking and waving her fists and if
 she had Force powers you would totally be choked right now.

 And of course Zoe acting out gets Marion and the mom to pay attention
 and Marion is all "Hey, hey, Zoe, calm down!" and the mom is all "Oh,
 gosh, they managed to get that toy out of the backpack." So the jig is
 up where by "the jig" I mean the toy and by "up" I mean going away.

 Chapter 2
 Snacktime

 And it's just like you expected. The mom scoops you and the toy up and
 the two of you dangle in mid-air while she removes the baby gate by the
 loveseat and goes around behind the loveseat. There's a cabinet back
 there, she pushes down the baby lock at the top of the cabinet door and
 opens the door and in goes your toy.

 You would be all into getting the toy back except everyone decides now
 is the time to have a snack so a bunch of toys get piled in that small
 open area in the living room and you and Zoe and Cassie and Watson and
 Jemison are dragged into the kitchen and out comes the food.

 At the Table
 Your high chair is not way super high since it only gets you up to the
 level of the kitchen table but that is still pretty high. It lets you
 see around the table which is better than when you are on the floor and
 cannot even see the top of the table[26].

 The mom is hovering around you.

 In front of you is this spoon full of food that the mom wants you to
 eat.

 You can also see Becca, Parry, Lisa, and Marion here.

 Jemison and Watson and Cassie and Zoe are here. They are all being fed.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>note 26
 Interludes like this one help delineate the three-act structure and
 give clues to later behavior that you'll need to exhibit as the player.

>eat food
 You open your mouth and the mom spoons in the prunes and they slide
 down your throat. Yeuch. And if that isn't bad enough, the spoon goes
 away and comes back with more prunes! You are just like Sisyphus here.

 Becca says, "Farina, I know you're not feeding that child chopped-up
 people food." Meanwhile, the mom is saying, "Here! Take a bite!"

>examine becca
 Becca is Jemison's mom, she is as loud as Jemison is quiet and that is
 very loud. Or very quiet. Anyway, that is Becca.

 "It's no different than canned baby food," the mom tells Becca.
 Meanwhile, Cassie is trying to climb out of her chair so she can fall
 to the floor and Lisa is restraining her.

>eat food
 You open your mouth and the mom spoons in the prunes. Yeuch. And if
 that isn't bad enough, the spoon goes away and comes back with more
 prunes!

 "Really?" Lisa says. "I'd be worried that I'd give Cassie something
 that'd hurt her." Meanwhile, Watson is spitting up and Parry is looking
 sad that he's going to have to change Watson's clothes.

>push spoon
 You reach for it but the mom moves it away and says "Ah ah ah! No
 hands! Eat it, don't play with it!"

 "Kids can eat nearly anything you can if it's pureed," says Marion.
 Meanwhile, Zoe is demanding more food. Grr, Zoe.

>hit zoe
 With you strapped into your high chair you cannot reach Zoe.

 "Weird," Becca says. "Then why buy special baby food at all?"
 Meanwhile, Jemison is taking bits of food and dropping them over his
 high chair and then watching them hit the floor.

>examine floor
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine jemison
 Jemison Thorsby's name is not one you would want, that is for sure. He
 is stylish in his blue onesie and he has a small mouth and these big
 eyes that are watching, always watching, it is kinda creepy.

 "Well," says Parry, "Sometimes it's really convenient to have a jar for
 Mason[27] so--whoops!" And then you stop paying attention to him
 because he spilled a teeny bowl of Cheerios and you and all the other
 babies are all staring at the spray of Cheerios.

>note 27
 Perhaps a Mason jar. Ha! I crack myself up.

>examine cheerios
 Oaty o's of pure goodness.

 Jemison reaches for the Cheerios but they are way too far away.

>take cherrios
 With you strapped into your high chair you cannot reach the pile of
 Cheerios.

 Watson looks at the Cheerios all sadly.

>go down
 (tearing yourself away from the Cheerios)
 You are all strapped into your high chair so you are going nowhere.

 Cassie rocks hard in her seat, maybe she thinks she can tip over to get
 to the Cheerios.

 Finally all of this feeding is over and the Cheerios get put away and
 everyone gets wiped up with baby wipes before getting dumped back in
 the living room.

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 You can also see a tall plastic block here.

>examine block
 It is blue and it is about as wide as you are and tall as your head is
 high when you are pulled up.

>go northeast

 Small Open Area
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.

 You can also see a short plastic block, a little doll, a teeny squeezy
 book, a teething ring, and a plastic cup here.

 Zoe has hold of a soft foam block loosely.

>push short block sw
 You shove and shove at the short plastic block and eventually you get
 it moving to the southwest and then you follow it.

 Zoe stalks in from the northeast and settles near you.

 Zoe has her eye on you.

 Zoe stalks off to the west.

>examine medium block
 It is green and it is about as wide as you are and as tall as your head
 is high when you are sitting down. It is by the south end of the
 loveseat to the west.

 Cassie crawls in from the southwest.

 You hear Watson cry loudly, boy is he angry.

>go west

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 You can see a medium plastic block and a rattly car here.

 Zoe has her eye on you.

 You hear Watson cry loudly.

>push medium block east
 You shove and shove at the medium plastic block and eventually you get
 it moving to the east and then you follow it.

 Cassie is looking around for mischief to make.

 Zoe stalks in from the west and settles near you.

>go southwest

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a
 loveseat to the north and more couch to the east.

 You can see Parry or at least his legs over by the couch.

 There is a red footstool, it is right next to the couch.

 You can just see some paper beyond the footstool.

>pull up on footstool
 You pull up on the footstool and get to your feet and you are all
 steady except for the occasional sway.

 You hear Watson cry loudly.

>go south
 (first letting go of the footstool and plopping on the ground)
 You so can't go that way.

 You hear Watson cry loudly. Then Parry says, "Farina, I'm going to
 borrow your swing and see if that calms Watson down." He stands up and
 strides off and you can see him come back with a baby swing. He goes
 over by the TV with it and then there is the picking up of Watson and
 the strapping in of Watson and the swinging of Watson, I hope that
 makes Watson feel better.

>undo
 Couch at the West
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go west
 There is just enough space for you to slide between the footstool and
 the couch so you cruise along the couch past the footstool and into the
 tiny space back there[28].

 Secret Space by the Couch
 There is not a lot of room back here behind the footstool, you fill
 most of the space between the footstool and the couch and this wood
 cabinet that is acting like an endtable.

 There is a red footstool, it is all close to you.

 There is this tiny folded piece of paper shoved under the cabinet.

>note 28
 Having seen a baby cruise her way into a space she couldn't have gotten
 into, I knew I wanted to use it as a puzzle.

>take paper
 You cannot reach the folded piece of paper because you are standing and
 if you let go with one hand you would just plop down before you could
 get it.

>sit
 You sit down on your diaper and it is good that it is all padded and
 stuff.

 You suddenly hear this heavy thud which must be Cassie leaping off the
 tall plastic block. Cassie shrieks, it is the loudest you have ever
 heard her be. I guess she is not the super-tough baby she thinks she
 is[29]. Anyway Lisa leaps up and runs to Cassie and Parry leaves his
 tumbler and runs to Cassie too, they scatter the plastic blocks around
 the room in their haste. "Baby, baby, it's okay, shh," you hear Lisa
 saying and then Parry is saying, "I think she's okay, she's just
 scared. Her pupillary response is just fine."

>note 29
 Take that, overactive baby.

>take paper
 You tug and tug and tug and then you see Parry's hand reach over you
 and remove the tumbler from on top of the cabinet where it was and pop!
 the folded paper comes out from under the wood cabinet and the cabinet
 goes rock rock rock. It is a good thing Parry was thirsty right now.

 You hear Watson cry loudly.

 Lisa is still saying "It'll be okay, Cassie, it'll be okay" and Parry
 is saying "Breathe, Cassie, breathe" and Cassie is now taking big
 hiccuping breaths.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine paper
 It is a tiny folded piece of paper.

 You hear Watson cry loudly.

>unfold paper
 It is really folded and creased from being under the cabinet and your
 fingers are too stubby.

 Cassie finally is all better and is laughing some and Lisa says,
 "Thanks, Parry, I appreciate your help" and Parry says, "No problem."
 And they go back to their seats.

>drop paper
 Dropped.

 You hear Watson cry loudly, boy is he angry. Then Parry says, "Farina,
 I'm going to borrow your swing and see if that calms Watson down." He
 goes clomping around and you can see him come back with a baby swing.
 He goes over by the TV with it and then there is the picking up of
 Watson and the strapping in of Watson and the swinging of Watson, I
 hope that makes Watson feel better.

>go east
 Really there is only one way out of this teeny space and that is to
 pull up and cruise on out to the east.

 Becca says to the mom, "Nice job on those mimosas."

 "Thanks," the mom replies.

>pull up on stool
 You pull up on the footstool and get to your feet and you are all
 steady except for the occasional sway.

 Lisa says, "It's nice, they help me calm down."

>go east
 You slide back out into the big wild world.

 Couch at the West
 The couch is very long and this is the west part of it. There is a
 loveseat to the north and more couch to the east.

 There is a red footstool, it is all close to you.

 There is Parry on the couch.

 You can also see a heavy tumbler and a short plastic block here.

 Cassie is looking around for mischief to make.

 "And they're good for you," Marion says.

>drool on tumbler
 You move towards the tumbler but Parry picks it up and says "No, that's
 my glass." And then the mom chimes in, "Hey, kiddo, no mouth! No
 mouth." Once you back off Parry puts the tumbler back down.

 "I'm not sure they're that good for you," Parry says.

 A shadow falls on you, it is Parry standing up. He goes over to where
 the TV is and the swing is and he does something that probably involves
 Watson before he sits down again.

>drool on tumbler
 You move towards the tumbler but Parry picks it up and says "No, that's
 my glass." Once you back off Parry puts the tumbler back down.

 Marion says, "They do have orange juice in them."

 Cassie climbs onto the short plastic block.

>go east
 (first letting go of the footstool and plopping on the ground)

 Couch in the Middle
 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 Jemison is all staring at the velcro jangly balls. The velcro jangly
 balls hang off of him.

 "Besides, if it tastes good, it's good for you," says Becca.

>take balls
 You tug on the velcro jangly balls and you tug some more and they come
 off of Jemison with a rrrrrrrip sound and Jemison looks at you with sad
 sad eyes and then stares at the velcro balls[30].

>note 30
 I get tired of games where you're introduced to a certain game mechanic
 that you then never use again, so I deliberately re-used mechanics like
 Jemison's fascination with stuff throughout.

>go northwest
 You jangle your way out of the room.

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 You can see a rattly car here.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

>go north
 You jangle your way out of the room.

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Hey, that baby gate that blocked your way west is all gone.

 Lisa's legs are hanging off of the loveseat.

 Zoe stalks in from the southeast and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

>go west
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 Behind the Loveseat
 Back here is the back of the loveseat casting a shadow over you, it is
 kind of cold. You can go south and east. You could go west but there is
 totally a door in your way. You could go north in the hall but there is
 a baby gate in the way there.

 Zoe stalks in from the east and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

>go south
 You jangle your way out of the room.

 By the Cabinet
 The cabinet that is also like an endtable for the loveseat and the
 couch is here. You can go north back to behind the loveseat.

 Way up on top of the cabinet you see a paper coaster.

 You can't believe the mom just shoved your favorite toy in that cabinet
 so you couldn't have it.

 Zoe stalks in from the north and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

>examine toy
 You can't see any such thing.

>open cabinet
 You go for the door but then Jemison is in front of you reaching for
 the jangly balls and they go jingle jangle when you pull away from him.

 Jemison stares at you and waits for you to drop the velcro jangly
 balls.

>push cabinet
 It goes rock rock rock now that there is no paper wedged under it.

>go north
 You jangle your way out of the room.

>examine tumbler
 The tumbler is thick glass and it holds water, it is left over from
 Parry snacking. I guess Parry took it off the cabinet to take a drink
 from it and then forgot to put it back on the cabinet. It is by the
 west end of the couch to the west.

>go west

 You move towards the tumbler but Parry picks it up and says "No, that's

 You suddenly hear this heavy thud which must be Cassie leaping off the
 tall plastic block. Cassie shrieks, it is the loudest you have ever
 heard her be. I guess she is not the super-tough baby she thinks she
 is. Anyway Lisa leaps up and runs to Cassie and Parry leaves his
 tumbler and runs to Cassie too, they scatter the plastic blocks around
 the room in their haste. "Baby, baby, it's okay, shh," you hear Lisa
 saying and then Parry is saying, "I think she's okay, she's just
 scared. Her pupillary response is just fine."

>drool on tumbler
 You put your mouth on the edge of the glass but there is no way you
 will tip it enough to drink but at least you slobbered all over it.

 Lisa is still saying "It'll be okay, Cassie, it'll be okay" and Parry
 is saying "Breathe, Cassie, breathe" and Cassie is now taking big
 hiccuping breaths.

>go north
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 You can see a rattly car here.

 Watson sits all sad and dumpy on the floor.

 Jemison comes in after you.

>go north
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Zoe stalks in from the east and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you.

 Zoe stalks off to the west.

 Cassie finally is all better and is laughing some and Lisa says,
 "Thanks, Parry, I appreciate your help" and Parry says, "No problem."
 And they go back to their seats. Then you hear Parry say "Ugh! My
 tumbler's damp!" and everyone laughs at Parry. Becca says, "That's why
 you don't put things where the kids can chew all over them!" And Parry
 sighs and you hear the wooden thunk of Parry putting the tumbler way up
 on the wood cabinet in the corner between the couch and the loveseat
 and definitely out of your reach[31].

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>note 31
 Poor Parry. It's like he's never been around babies before[32]. He's
 fallen prey to the common misconception that, if you keep pushing
 babies away from something they're interested in, eventually they'll
 grow bored and wander off.

>note 32
 More likely, it's that Watson's so low-key that Parry is lax in his
 baby defense.

>go west
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 Behind the Loveseat
 Back here is the back of the loveseat casting a shadow over you, it is
 kind of cold. You can go south and east. You could go west but there is
 totally a door in your way. You could go north in the hall but there is
 a baby gate in the way there.

 Zoe has her eye on you (not literally).

 Jemison comes in after you.

>take balls
 You tug on the velcro jangly balls and you tug some more and they come
 off of yourself with a rrrrrrrip sound.

>go south
 You are all jangle jangle jangle as you leave.

 By the Cabinet
 The cabinet that is also like an endtable for the loveseat and the
 couch is here. You can go north back to behind the loveseat.

 Way up on top of the cabinet you see a heavy tumbler.

 Zoe stalks in from the north and settles near you.

 Jemison comes in after you and settles close by you and looks pointedly
 at the velcro jangly balls.

 "Hey, I just realized," Becca says all loud, "Your name is Parry
 Mason!"

>put balls on zoe
 You shove the velcro end of the balls against Zoe high on her back
 where she can't reach and the velcro sticks!

 "Um, yes?" Parry says.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>open cabinet
 You reach for the door and Zoe moves to stop you but Jemison gets in
 front of Zoe and reaches for the jangly balls[33]. While she is all
 dealing with him you tug on the door and the baby lock catches, making
 the entire cabinet rock towards you. And as it does so the tumbler
 tumbles, hitting the baby lock and pushing it down before springing off
 of the lock and over your head. The cabinet door pops open and your
 favorite toy rolls out and into your lap!

 Then you hear the crying. When you turn you see a very wet Zoe and a
 very wet Jemison and the empty tumbler is next to them. Jemison takes
 it like a toddler, he is fine, but Zoe is angry like a wet evil cat.
 Heads pop over the top of the loveseat staring down at all of you, one
 of them is Parry and he looks really embarassed[34].

 You're probably not going to get to keep the toy.

 Chapter 3
 Picturetime

 It is like you are psychic because you don't get to keep the toy. The
 mom storms around the couch and scoops you up and grabs the toy. "It's
 okay, Farina," Marion says, "accidents happen. Zoe and Jemison don't
 look hurt, just wet." Several of the other parents are glaring at
 Parry, he looks all sheepish.

 "Since the kids have to be changed anyway, let's take pictures!" Marion
 says.

 "Sure, works for me," Lisa says, and just like that everyone is getting
 their onesies taken off and instead they are being put in these
 Halloween costumes, and that would be okay except your squid costume is
 totally restrictive[35].

 On the Couch
 You don't get up on the couch all that much but now you are up here
 with everyone else so you can have your pictures taken.

 Becca is all ordering everyone around.

 Parry is standing back a bit watching the picturetime commotion.

 Lisa is staying near Cassie in case she makes a break for it.

 Marion is calm in the face of all this chaos.

 The mom is trying to get all of you together for a picture.

 Jemison and Watson and Cassie and Zoe are here. Jemison is all dressed
 like a bumblebee. Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume.
 Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin costume, it is adorable. Zoe hunkers
 in a ladybug costume like a wolf in cute sheep's clothing.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>note 33
 It takes a baby to stop a baby, clearly. Since Zoe has upped the ante
 by blocking your actions directly, you get to stop her by using
 Jemison.

>note 34
 Poor Parry. He's responsible for you getting the toy once again.

>note 35
 So much of baby life consists of being dressed by your parents in
 uncomfortable or embarrassing outfits.

>examine squid
 It is like a squid if a squid was all plush and powder blue and didn't
 have any suckers. You are wearing it and its tentacles cover your arms
 and hands.

 The mom says, "That's an interesting costume Watson's wearing." Watson
 must know he's being talked about, he ducks his head and looks sad.

>examine bumblebee
 The tiny antennas and tiny wings totally make the costume.

 "We made it ourselves," Parry replies.

>examine pumpkin
 Round but not so round that Cassie cannot zoom around in it.

 Becca laughs all loud. "It's not very cheerful--whoops, hold on there
 Jemison." Zoe must've pushed Jemison because he starts to topple
 sideways before Becca rescues him.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Parry is all huffy, "We wanted something different from the usual."

>go down
 You start to move and then there is the mom, she pushes you back in
 place. "Whoa, kiddo, we've got to get a picture of everyone."

 "Does that thing have buttons? That'll make it fun to take off if he
 spits up on it," Becca laughs again.

>smile
 You smile and make a bubbly laugh noise, it is the thing you do that
 makes everyone say "oh my goodness how cute!"

 Cassie bounces up and down next to you and you try to back away from
 her but your tentacles get in your way. "Keep the kids together!" Lisa
 calls, pointing a small camera at all of you.

>jump
 There is no way you are going to jump, you can barely crawl.

 Parry and the mom get you all in place on the couch. The mom dangles
 your favorite toy in front of all of you! You and Zoe stare raptly at
 it and then Parry says "Now!" and it is like a thousand suns explode in
 front of you and all you can see are these white and red spots.

>wait
 Time passes.

 As the spots clear you see Watson has pitched face first into the
 couch. Zoe is busy tugging on Jemison's wings and Cassie is chewing on
 one of your tentacles. "Hope no one wanted another picture!" Becca
 says.

>examine tentacles
 It is like a squid if a squid was all plush and powder blue and didn't
 have any suckers. You are wearing it and its tentacles cover your arms
 and hands.

 The parents give up and take you all off the couch. As the mom puts you
 down she stops by the bookcase and puts your toy up there. "Maybe next
 year they'll sit still," Lisa sighs, and Parry just snorts.

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

>go west

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the
 north and a big play area to the east and to the south is the couch
 that is bigger than the loveseat.

 You can see a rattly car here.

 Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume.

>spit on costume
 You reach deep down inside you and bring up some of those stupid prunes
 the mom was feeding you and spit them up on the squid costume, making
 it all dirty[36].

>note 36
 Isn't it nice that the solution to your problem makes more work for the
 mom?

>pull up on watson
 You would but the tentacles of your stupid squid costume are too
 slick[37].

>note 37
 You know what's more fun in IF than only being able to carry a few
 things? Being able to carry nothing.

 Couch in the Middle
 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 You can also see a brix blox bucket here.

 Jemison is all dressed like a bumblebee.

>pull up on mom
 You rub up against the legs of the mom and she looks down and says,
 "Oh, oh, your costume is all dirty, kiddo." She lifts you up and the
 next thing you know you are back on the ground and free of that evil
 squid costume.

 Watson wanders in from the northwest.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>pull up on watson
 You can't pull up on Watson to stand.

 Watson tries to look through the brix blox bucket to the brix blox
 inside it.

 Jemison crawls to the north.

>go northwest

 Loveseat at the South
 This is the south end of the loveseat, there is more loveseat to the

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Shoved half-under the loveseat is a remote control.

 Those are Parry's feet dangling from the loveseat.

>take remote
 You pick it up.

 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast.

 Cassie and Jemison are here. Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin costume,
 it is adorable. Jemison is all dressed like a bumblebee.

 Cassie falls forward onto her hands and then she is crawling off to the
 north.

>go south

 Couch in the Middle
 Here is where the middle of the couch is. If you want to play you
 should totally go north to the middle of the room where there is a lot
 of space. There is more couch to the east and west.

 Those are the mom's legs there by the couch.

 You can also see a brix blox bucket here.

 Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume.

>kick bucket
 You are way not coordinated enough to do that.

 Watson gazes at the brix blox bucket.

>push bucket
 You put your hands on the bucket and it wobbles and then it wobbles
 more and look out! it comes crashing down, spilling these dayglo blox
 everywhere and dumping an instruction booklet out[38].

 The mom says, "The other day when we were out, I saw a mom with her
 toddler on her leash."

>note 38
 Originally, when you pushed the blox bucket over, the instruction book
 stayed inside. You had to look into the bucket to find it, remove it
 from the bucket, drop it, and then open it. About my third time playing
 through the section I realized how totally un-fun that was and changed
 it so the booklet comes falling out.

>examine bucket
 It is a tall cube that is open on top only the corners are all rounded
 so no babies are harmed in the extracting of the blox from the bucket
 and it is also wider at the top than at the bottom. It is lying on its
 side.

 "What?" Becca says, and the mom is all, "I know! The toddler was
 wearing this monkey backpack and the tail unspooled into a leash that
 the mom held."

 Watson flops the instruction booklet open and it opens to a page that
 shows you how to build a helicopter.

>turn page
 You flip the pages by scrabbling at them until you are looking at this
 blocky diagram of a rolly car thing.

 Parry says, "I don't know, that sounds like a clever idea."

>turn page
 You flip the pages by scrabbling at them until you are looking at this
 blocky diagram of a nuclear reactor model.

 The mom is indignant, "My child is not a dog to be on a leash!" Good
 for her, there is no way you'd wear a leash.

>turn page
 You flip the pages by scrabbling at them until you are looking at this
 blocky diagram of a wall.

 Lisa says, "When you get down to it, babies are about as smart as pets.
 Cassie might as well be a hyperactive Yorkie."

>turn page
 You flip the pages by scrabbling at them until you are looking at this
 blocky diagram of a poosh stick.

 "Lisa!" Marion says. "That's horrible!"

>put remote in mouth
 You shove the remote control in your mouth and start chewing on it and
 that leaves your hands free.

 "It's true!" Lisa says. "They make messes on the floor and can't talk
 and you can classically condition them."

>pull up on mom
 The mom laughs and says, "Where did you find that?" as she pulls the
 remote out of your mouth.

 Then Parry sees you and her with the remote and says, "That reminds me,
 I'd like to put in a Baby Feynman video for Watson." There is then this
 big pregnant pause before Parry says, "Uh, if that's okay."

 The mom is quiet, she is probably communicating with the other moms
 using only her eyes and mom-telepathy[39] because wasn't Parry anti-TV
 for kids before? And then she says, "Sure!" So Parry heads over to the
 TV and drags the baby swing out of the way of the TV and over by the
 bookcase and turns the TV on.

 "You know," Parry says, "A combination playpen and Skinner box might
 sell really well[40]."

>note 39
 As best I can tell, mom telepathy comes from moms having had a large
 shared pool of experiences when it comes to babies.

>note 40
 This is my favorite of all of the parents' conversations, mainly for
 this line right here.

>sit
 Since you are already sitting you can't sit again or maybe it's like
 you've already succeeded at sitting.

 Becca says, "That is the kind of thing people call Child Protective
 Services about."

 Watson looks at the instruction booklet and his hands move so fast they
 are almost blurry and the dayglo blox go together and suddenly Watson
 has built a poosh stick. He looks at it and then drops it.

>take stick
 You pick it up and it takes two hands.

 "I'm not sure Child Services gets called that often to rescue kids from
 Skinner boxes," Parry says.

 Small Open Area
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 About half a parent high in the bookcase is your favorite toy.

 There is a big old baby swing all shoved up against the bookcase.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.

 You can also see a soft foam block, a tall plastic block, a short
 plastic block, a medium plastic block, a little doll, a teeny squeezy
 book, and a teething ring here.

 Zoe has hold of a plastic cup all sadly.

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>examine toy
 This is the thing your aunt gave you which is a super fun toy. It has
 places to chew and places that are shiny and it rattles when you shake
 it. Right now it is up on the bookcase, it is like nearly half a parent
 high.

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>examine switch
 That is the switch that controls how high the swing goes, it can be set
 to lo, med, or hi. Right now it is on lo.

 Zoe gets onto the tall plastic block.

>push switch to hi
 You push on the switch with the poosh stick and turn it to hi.

 Zoe pokes the plastic cup towards your favorite toy.

>cry
 You let out this sobbing wail and the mom says, "Shh, it's okay."

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>cry
 When you cry again the mom says, "Shh. Calm down."

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>take toy
 You have short arms, you can't reach your favorite toy from down here.

 Zoe climbs down off of the short plastic block.

>push toy with stick
 The long stick is hard to control and the shelves keep getting in the
 way.

 Zoe drops the plastic cup and she grabs a teething ring.

>push zoe with stick
 There is no way the parents will believe you had nothing to do with
 hurting her, you'd better leave her alone for now.

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>give stick to zoe
 Zoe eyes you coldly, no way she is taking anything from you.

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>drop stick
 Dropped.

 Zoe gets onto the tall plastic block.

>enter swing
 You cannot get in the baby swing yourself, that is something the
 parents do for you when they are bored of you or you are upset.

>cry
 This time you add a lot of tremolo to your crying and the mom says,
 "You're not going to calm down, are you, kiddo? Do you need the swing?"

 The mom asks the other parent people, "Do any of you have a suggestion
 for a baby sitter?" W. T. F.

>cry
 "Okay, kiddo, let's check you and make sure," the mom says and scoops
 you up. "Diaper's okay. You're not hungry. To the swing!" You're
 airlifted into the swing and the mom straps you in. She turns it on,
 click click click, and then you are swinging really high.

 Small Open Area (in the baby swing)
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 About half a parent high in the bookcase is your favorite toy.

 You can also see a poosh stick, a plastic cup, a soft foam block, a
 tall plastic block (on which is Zoe), a short plastic block, a medium
 plastic block, a little doll, and a teeny squeezy book here.

 The mom goes on, "We've got a Christmas party to go to in a month or
 so, and we've never used a babysitter before." No, really--W. T. F.???

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it. At the top of the
 swing you are way close to your toy.

 Zoe watches you swing back and forth, back and forth.

>take toy
 You stretch for the toy but it is just barely out of reach.

 Marion says, "Didn't you have luck with Susan, Lisa?" Susan, that's a
 name that sounds okay.

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it. At the top of the
 swing you are way close to your toy.

 Zoe watches you swing back and forth, back and forth.

>take toy
 You stretch for the toy but it is just barely out of reach.

 Lisa says, "I've used Susan two--no, three times. She said Cassie was
 great." Lisa pauses all thoughtful like. "Maybe she was lying to get a
 bigger tip."

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it. At the top of the
 swing you are way close to your toy.

 Zoe watches you swing back and forth, back and forth.

>take toy
 You stretch for the toy but it is just barely out of reach.

 "I didn't think she was all that," Becca says. "I had her keep Zoe
 once. Susan and Zoe didn't get along at all." This Susan is sounding
 better all the time.

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it. At the top of the
 swing you are way close to your toy.

 Zoe watches you swing back and forth, back and forth.

>take toy
 You stretch for the toy but it is just barely out of reach.

 Marion says, "You could have Susan visit ahead of time to look for any
 problems."

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the
 whole world tilts and turns as you swing with it. At the top of the
 swing you are way close to your toy.

 Zoe watches you swing back and forth, back and forth.

 Parry comes wandering by with his water glass but he stops when he sees
 you swinging. He looks at your favorite toy. He looks at you. He looks
 at your toy. He looks at Zoe. He looks at how close you get to your
 favorite toy. When he is all done with his looking he casually leans
 against the bookcase and taps your toy. It totally falls a bit closer!
 He winks at you and heads on by[41].

>note 41
 Since Parry had helped you accidentally in the first two sections, I
 wanted him to help you directly in the third. Plus I figured he'd be on
 the side of truth and justice -- yours.

>take toy
 You stretch your arms but they are still too much like teeny T. Rex
 arms so then you scrunch down in your swing and stretch out a leg and
 as you swoop up again you just are able to kick the toy! It flies into
 the air and onto your lap! But as you swing back Zoe leans over from
 the tall block and swats at the toy and you swat at her and the upshot
 is the toy goes flying again and it goes kerplunk into the playpen.

 This is the worst playdate ever.

 "I'll give her a call, then," the mom says.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

 You are way high in the baby swing and are all swinging, you are not

 The baby swing clicks and clacks as it swings really high, and the

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

 You look up and there is the mom, you are swinging toward her face and
 away, toward and away. She turns off the swing and gets you down and
 puts you on the floor before going back to her seat.

 Small Open Area
 You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and
 north of the big TV that Sesame Street comes from. On the wall is a big
 bookcase full of chewy books. There is a way into the kitchen to the
 north but one of those baby gates is there, that is no fair.

 There is a big old baby swing all shoved up against the bookcase.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.
 Through the mesh you can see your favorite toy.

 You can also see a poosh stick, a plastic cup, a soft foam block, a
 tall plastic block, a short plastic block, a medium plastic block (on
 which is Zoe), a little doll, and a teeny squeezy book here.

>take stick
 You pick it up and it takes two hands.

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>push oval
 You have short arms, you can't reach the top oval from down here.

 Zoe climbs down off of the short plastic block.

>push oval with stick
 You get the poosh stick into position under the oval and push the oval
 up with it and it goes up a bit and clicks but when you let go it drops
 back into place. I guess you need to push up the oval at both ends of
 the playpen at the same time.

 Zoe coughs and you look at her and she looks at you and you both look
 at the top oval of the playpen. It is like you are communicating
 telepathically and that communication is "I may despise you and all
 that you stand for but I will work with you in order to lift the oval
 and free the toy but after that it is every baby for him or herself."
 So you nod and she nods and it is a deal[42].

 Becca says, "That's a bad cough Zoe has. Is she getting sick?" but
 Marion says, "No, she coughs like that sometimes to get attention."

 Zoe gets onto the short plastic block.

>note 42
 I like you having to team up with your antagonist, even if only for a
 little while. Though it's not a perfect arrangement: try pushing the
 oval with the poosh stick on the side where Zoe is.

>push oval with stick
 You move the stick into position to push the top oval and Zoe just
 looks at you as if to say "this is the side of the oval I will be
 pushing, get your own side."

 Zoe gets onto the medium plastic block.

>push oval with stick
 You move the stick into position to push the top oval and Zoe just
 looks at you as if to say "this is the side of the oval I will be
 pushing, get your own side."

 Zoe gets onto the tall plastic block.

>push oval with stick
 You move the stick into position to push the top oval and nearly hit
 Zoe on the nose, she looks down at you as if you are an idiot both for
 nearly hitting her and for pushing the oval up on the side where she
 already is.

 Zoe looks at you and coughs pointedly.

>enter playpen
 You get into the southwest part of the playpen.

 Lisa suddenly says, "Parry! Are you eating Cheerios?"

 Parry sounds all sheepish, "Yeah."

 Becca is all "I hope you don't mind crumbs all over your loveseat,
 Farina," and everyone laughs but Parry.

 The gliding rocking chair is all tall and wooden. It is where the mom
 rocks you when she thinks you need a nap even though you do not need
 naps. The loveseat is west and there is a small open area to the east

 There are Becca's legs, they are by the rocking chair.

 You can also see a smooth rock, a plush book, and a much-loved kangaroo
 here.

 "Oh, thanks," Lisa says. "She's probably too good at pulling up and
 climbing, to tell you the truth."

 You hear this rattle jingle, it is Zoe playing with your toy!

>go west

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 On the north pink striped loveseat is a cup of Cheerios.

 You can see Parry here.

 "We've been working on pulling up," the mom says, boy is she going to
 be surprised by all the practice you're getting today.

>push cheerios with stick
 You reach up with the stick and whack the cup and all of these Cheerios
 shower down around you in a big pile.

 It is as if the oxygen in the room goes foom like there was a flash
 fire and suddenly there are all of these babies headed your way[43].

 Becca snorts. "I love how all of you take credit for your kids'
 development. Like you're the one pulling up."

 You hear this rattle jingle, it is Zoe playing with your toy!

 Cassie zips in from the south.

 Jemison comes in after Cassie.

>note 43
 True story: at my son's first birthday party, he knocked over a small
 cup of Cheerios, spilling them near my feet. Instantly, every baby at
 the party crawled towards us, swarming around me.

 Cheerios are baby crack.

>drop stick
 (tearing yourself away from the Cheerios)
 Dropped.

 Lisa says, "You're just annoyed that Jemison just sits there--" but
 Becca keeps on talking, "So your kid pulls up or cruises or whatever.
 Big deal!"

 You hear this rattle jingle, it is Zoe playing with your toy!

 Watson wanders in from the south.

>examine zoe
 (tearing yourself away from the Cheerios)
 Grr, Zoe Kinmundy. That little red-haired girl[44] has this ladybug
 costume on, it is supposed to be cute but you are not fooled. Her red
 hair is in pigtails, like that will fool anyone into thinking she is
 nice. She has a death-grip on your favorite toy and a teething ring.
 She is over by the TV to the east.

 Parry says, "Kids develop at different speeds. It's not as if I'll
 still be helping Watson pull up when he goes to college."

 You hear this rattle jingle, it is Zoe playing with your toy!

 Jemison picks up some Cheerios and munches on them.

>se
 (tearing yourself away from the Cheerios)
 You have to push your way past Watson, Jemison, and Cassie thanks to
 those Cheerios and that slows you down.

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. This is
 where everybody plays because it is so big. But when you get bored
 there is a bunch of other stuff you can go to like the TV to the east
 and the loveseat to the west and the couch to the south and the gliding
 rocking chair to the north.

 Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the northeast. The
 playpen is all open.

 "As long as Zoe doesn't fall too far behind, I'm not worried," Marion
 says.

>go east

 In Front of TV
 The entertainment center here holds the TV all towering above you and
 it has these glass doors beneath the TV that you can see stereo
 equipment through. You are near the couch to the south and the middle
 of the living room to the west and there is a small open area to play
 in to the north.

 Zoe has your toy! ZOE HAS YOUR TOY!

 "Yeah," Parry says. "It won't bother me if Watson is like many boys and
 is slower to talk."

>take toy
 Zoe sees you coming for the toy! She will not let you have it!

 Zoe runs off to the west with your toy!

 "As long as Cassie is ahead of where she's supposed to be, I won't
 worry either," Lisa says.

 Now on TV all of these stars are gathering together, it is like they
 are having a big star party.

>go west

 Zoe runs off to the northwest with your toy!

>go northwest

 Loveseat at the North
 This is the part of the loveseat that is to the north. It goes on to
 the south and you could totally slip around the end of the loveseat to
 the west. There is the rocking chair to the east as well, that is
 always fun.

 Those sure are a bunch of Cheerios spilled everywhere.

 You can also see a poosh stick and Parry here.

 Zoe and Watson and Jemison and Cassie are here. Zoe has your toy! ZOE
 HAS YOUR TOY! Watson is gloomy in his sad homemade bat costume. Jemison
 is all dressed like a bumblebee. Cassie is dressed in this pumpkin
 costume, it is adorable.

 Cassie grabs a handful of Cheerios and inhales them.

>take toy
 Zoe tries to crawl away, but there are babies and Cheerios and it is a
 big train-wreck and she cannot get away!

 You lunge forward and yank on the toy and Zoe is all distracted by
 Cheerios and the toy pops out of her evil sweaty grasp! You have your
 toy!

 Zoe screws up her face and bursts into these loud wails, they are so
 terribly loud. She shoves at Cassie who also starts crying and soon
 just about everyone is crying except you, ha ha, they are such babies.

 Marion says, "I was afraid we were staying too late past Zoe's naptime.
 Farina, everyone, it's been fun, and glad you could come, Parry. See
 everyone next week." Hands come down and the squalling Zoe zips up into
 the air and into Marion's arms. Soon all of the babies are going
 skywards, parentwards, and out-the-doorwards.

 With them all gone the air kinda leaks out of you, it has been a long
 playdate. The mom gathers you and your favorite toy up. "C'mon, kid,
 let's get you to bed before you completely pass out." But you do not
 need naps, does she not understand that?

 Though your crib is nice and soft and your favorite toy chimes a bit as
 you curl around it and your teeny eyelids are so heavy.

 So...heavy....

 Smothered in Darkness
 It is dark and stuffy and you are covered over, something is all draped
 over you, it is enough to make you crazy.

>xyzzy
 Everything you try just winds you tighter in the darkness, this sucks.

 You are trying not to breathe fast, it is hard when you are so closed
 in.

>remove cover
 (first taking the blanket)
 Everything you try just winds you tighter in the darkness, this sucks.

 The darkness is all scratchy on your skin.

>cry
 Suddenly the darkness is gone, and it is so light, you are blinded for
 just a second. You blink and blink and then you can see the mom holding
 the blanket she was covering you with. "Oh, kid, I'm so sorry, I
 thought you were having fun," she says. "We'll do something else."

 That'll teach her.

 Middle of the Living Room
 This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. But it
 would be bigger and vaster if there weren't all these pillows and stuff
 in a big ring around you. The mom is totally all paranoid and whatever,
 she is a new mom.

 There is a red footstool, it looms over you.

 The mom is playing with you and is all excited about it.

 You can also see a squishy ball, a plush book, and your favorite toy
 here.

 You eye your favorite toy and the mom sees you doing it and scoops it
 up. "No, no, we're going to try pulling up!" She is all the time trying
 to build your character or something. She waves the toy at you. "Look!
 Look where I'm putting it!" She drops the toy on the footstool where
 you can't see it unless you're all pulled up, that is just no fair.

>xyzzy
 Supposedly saying xyzzy will do magical things and whatever, you can't
 talk yet.

>quit
 Are you sure you want to quit?
>yes
