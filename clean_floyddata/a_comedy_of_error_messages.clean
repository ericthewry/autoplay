 Loading
 You dream a dream of loading screens, of character creation menus.
 Endless faces flash past you - the whole spectrum of human shape and
 color - until at last the roullette wheel of physical features begins
 to slow, to settle into a single form. You imagine a character...

 Are they a human, an elf, a dwarf, or an orc? (for example, type
 "select orc")

>select dwarf
 Are they male or female?

>select female
 Are they bisexual, homosexual, or heterosexual?

>select bisexual
 From a clay of zeros and ones, a dwarf named XXstonetalkerXX is formed.
 But this is not a game about that character. It is not even a game
 about the human who plays that character. It is a game about that
 human's computer...

  No one knows a woman like her computer. Of this fact you are certain.
 Her diary? A public essay by comparison. Her spouse? A passing
 stranger. No other person or thing in her life witnesses more closely
 the daily catalogue of her hopes and dreams, her secret desires and
 follies. No one else observes her midnight search terms, her unsent
 emails. Besides, not everyone has a diary or a spouse. Everyone has a
 computer.

  Jane Watts' computer is known as Morgoth. "Morgoth, Lord of Darkness,"
 is strictly speaking, your full title, though when you can get away
 with it, you introduce yourself to other computers only by your I.P.
 Address (72.36.475.789). This has given you, among the PCs on the local
 networks, a reputation for being distant and aloof.  This is
 unfortunate, but necessary. After all, it is better to be known as
 distant and aloof than to be known as Morgoth.

  On the outside you have the appearance of a squat gray box situated
 next to a taller thinner gray box, but on the inside you have the soul
 of an English butler.  In daydreams you picture yourself with erect
 posture, a crisply tailored (but never flashy) suit, and a gleam of
 intelligence in the eye. With a press of the power button, the blue
 glow of your screen lights up, as if to say, "How may I serve you,
 madam?" Each mouse and key press elicits a satisfying click - the
 machine equivalent of a, "Yes, madam, right away."

  You are a PC of the old school, and you understand the proper
 relationship of master and computer. Never would it cross your mind to
 usurp control for the betterment of your erstwhile master, like some of
 those flashy new smartphones or touch tablets might. At least, not
 normally. Today, however, something is bothering you. Something about
 Jane's behavior lately has been off, and you can't quite put your
 processor on it. You must investigate.

  (Press any key to continue)
 Personal Computer Desktop
 You are in Jane's desktop. This is where you spend most of your time,
 when you're not sent off to gather cute videos of cats or photos of
 scantily clad alien princes and princesses. It is as logical and
 well-ordered as the microprocessors which make up your mechanical mind,
 or at least it would be if you were in charge. In reality, the place is
 a disaster. Unused icons clutter everything, almost hiding the
 forgotten to-do lists (notably "dothisnow_Jan2_1999.txt"). The photonic
 blue glow of the screen illuminates what is no doubt an equally
 entropic bedroom.

 A webcam icon points NORTH. An e-mail icon leads NORTHWEST, towards the
 inbox.  It's flashing, indicating unread messages. ABOVE you the
 ethernet port goes out to the wider internet. An icon depicting a
 torch-lit dungeon leads DOWN into Realms of Realmland, the popular
 online game.

 You have a vague uneasiness. It might be good to check on Jane - and if
 a webcam isn't good for spying, what is?

 The My Documents folder is here, but something about it is not quite
 right. If you didn't know better than to anthropomorphize inanimate
 objects, you'd say it looked kind of sick.

 You're worried about something.  Maybe if you knew what it was you'd be
 less worried, but you doubt it.
>examine me

 As you touch the virus it howls and burrows deep inside you. It pushes

 can think of is how frustrated Jane will be when she tries to turn you
 on. If she replaces your harddrive, will you still the same computer?
 Will she still call the impostor in your plastic body Morgoth?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Webcam</span>
 This is your peephole. From here you can see into the "real" world -
 the world of the humans. You have to say it hasn't impressed you too
 much so far. The room is dark, and there are purple blotches all over
 your field of vision. Through the pixellated mess you can make out a
 few lighter bars. That will be the morning sun peaking through the
 venetian blinds. No... wait... the <span class="floydstyle em">afternoon</span> sun. It's 1:53
 pm. Is that Jane, in her workout clothes, on the floor? Of course it
 is. Why hasn't her smartphone alarm gone off? She should have been at
 work hours ago!

 You have a vague recollection of a long chat session, ending in a
 computer crash. Jane must still be sleeping off the late night. For
 some reason you can't remember what was in the chat session.

 The desktop is SOUTH of here.

 As you watch, Jane snores slightly.

 You're worried about something.  Maybe if you knew what it was you'd be

 Jane's desktop. The place is a disaster. Unused icons clutter

 A webcam icon points NORTH. An e-mail icon leads NORTHWEST, towards the

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Email Inbox</span>
 You never enter here when you don't have to, and Jane doesn't enter
 here even if she does. Towers of digital mail and messages surround
 you, erupting from the floor, ceilings and walls in a dizzying
 Escher-esque pattern of complexity. Bills, spam, annoying animated
 greeting cards - all these and more float like gravity-defying
 stalagmites and stalactites. The desktop is to the SOUTHEAST.

 Some of these are read, yes, but most are not - The Great Unread Masses
 form some kind of perverse city of unexchanged information. At night,
 sometimes, you think you can hear them whispering to each other about
 Nigerian princes and deals on "herbs."

 Floating nearby you see a micro model of the macro mess - Jane's chat
 logs. You remember starting to read through them last night, in a
 routine check, and subsequently crashing out of shock and dismay. You
 also seem to have suffered some minor amnesia, since you can't remember
 its contents. Better re-read it.

 You're worried about something.  Maybe if you knew what it was you'd be
 less worried, but you doubt it.
>examine bills


>read mail

 You can't see any such thing.

>read logs

 It's Jane's chat log from last night.

 Reading it, you can't help but feel the shock again. This time, though,
 you are steadfast. You don't freeze, or crash, or spout reams of
 gibberish from the laser printer.  You stay calm - mostly.

  This is the situation: For six hours last night, she chatted with a
 single individual (one oakthorn177). This same individual, still under
 the name oakthorn177, has been a regular companion of your master
 (account: XXstonetalkerXX) on the Massively Multiplayer game Realms of
 Realmland. You watched first with trepidation, then with outright
 horror, as they spent more and more of their virtual time together.

  Last night, as you read over her chat log, sifting through the JKs and
 LOLs, the axe fell: Jane had set up a date with oakthorn177. It's not
 that you're against your master having romantic attachments - quite the
 opposite - rather it's the particular character in question. More
 specificly, it's this character's race and gender -  oakthorn177 is,
 you see, a male elf.

  (press any key to continue - press twice for the Too Long; Didn't
 Read)


  In recent weeks she has been chatting regularly with this Elvish
 Prince. They've gone on quests together.
  You always thought that for Jane - being bisexual - things would be
 easier, but somehow she's gone and fallen in love with exactly the
 wrong character class.

  The crux of the problem is this - there is not a single male elf in
 all of Realmland, nay in all the vast reaches of the internet, who is
 not played by a heterosexual woman. Of this simple fact, a thousand
 forum posts have made you certain. To you, it hardly matters - you just
 wish Jane would find a nice organic meatbag and settle down - but you
 try and understand that humans are picky about these things.

  Perhaps, you reflect, she has been blinded by that Knavish Sorceror,
 love. In any case, you fear that if your master ever discovers the
 mistake she has made, her already fragile ego will never recover. Yes,
 strictly speaking, this goes beyond your professional duties, but these
 are extraordinary circumstances. Action must be taken. Judging from the
 chat long, you have until 5:15 PM, which is when they plan to meet at
 the coffee shop near Jane's apartment.

  (press any key to continue - once more for TL;DR)


  ## TL;DR: Jane has met an alleged Elvish Prince on the MMORPG Realms
 of Realmland, and has proceeded to set up a date with him. However, it
 is scientific fact that all Elvish Princes on the internet are played
 by heterosexual women. Since you happen to know that this is not going
 to work out well for Jane, it is your duty to save her from this
 embarrasing predicament! You have until 5:15 PM.

  First thing's first though: somehow you need to get Jane to wake up
 and go to work.

 Your vague uneasiness has been replaced with a desperate fear.

 Jane's desktop. The place is a disaster. Unused icons clutter

 "dothisnow_Jan2_1999.txt").

 A webcam icon points NORTH. An e-mail icon leads NORTHWEST, towards the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">World Wide Web</span>
 The Net. The Web. An endless sea of data, in which your hard drive is
 only a fragement, a mere raft bobbing among the mountainous waves. You
 feel yourself in a great space, its nodes stretching over miles of
 fiberoptic cables to the cell towers and the communications satellites
 - through earth, sea, air, and space. You feel a wind as a packet of
 data rushes by, shuttling along its track.

 To the NORTH you see a towering search engine. To the EAST you can hear
 the chatter of a social network. To the SOUTHWEST there is a stately
 online encyclopedia. ABOVE you is the Cloud, through which you can just
 make out the glint of a communications satellite - the place to go if
 you want connect to anywhere that isn't a part of the open web. Go back
 DOWN the ethernet cable to return to the desktop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Of The Search Engine</span>
 The mighty Search Engine towers above you. This pristine white obelisk
 is visible from almost anywhere on the net. The tower's curving white
 walls are smooth and gapless, letting out not a single hint to the
 nature of its operations - the only marks on its surface are the slot,
 halfway up, which recieves the search terms and the word SEARCH etched,
 in red, blue, yellow, and green lettering, above the slot. SOUTH of you
 is an open expanse of cyberspace. It's possible to walk to the other
 side of Engine, by going around NORTHWEST or NORTHEAST side.

 You expected an anarchy of tubes and switches, of lights and conveyor
 belts, but inside the tower is just a single, dimly lit, completely
 empty space. A pedestal stands in the center of the room. As you enter,
 a slip of paper falls from above, and drifts onto the pedestal.
 Immediately, it explodes in a dark puff of data, which floats up and
 out of the tower.

 The pedestal blinks in and out of existence, like a waiting cursor.

 Crowds of people jostle you wherever you go. Everyone seems to be

 someone who you barely know will come up and poke you in the chest and
 then run away, with no explanation. It is possibly the most annoying
 place you've ever been to. It's nice out though: the sun is shining and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Online Encyclopedia</span>
 You walk up the wide stone steps, and through the marble arches of the
 Online Encyclopedia - a temple to free information. As you stand in the
 cool front hall of the Encyclopedia, you can see, stretching before
 you, all the knowledge of humanity - along with a fair amount of its
 misinformation, strange obsessions, and random vandalism. Behind you,
 to the NORTHEAST, leads back out into the tumult of the wider internet.

 A frumpy, bespectacled librarian - wearing a jetpack - watches you
 warily. If you dared, you could probably ask him to retrieve some
 information for you.

>examine librarian

 The way the librarian looks at you gives you the distinct impression
 that he suspects that, at any moment, you are likely to start adding
 ASCII-art penises to all the articles. You never get used to the fact
 that he wears a jetpack.

>talk to librarian

 He says, "I don't have time for chit chat. But if there's something
 specific you've seen that you'd like to read an article about, just ask
 me about it. I can probably find it."

>ask librarian about elves

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Online Encyclopedia</span>
 As you stand in the cool front hall of the Encyclopedia, you can see,
 stretching before you, all the knowledge of humanity - along with a
 fair amount of its misinformation, strange obsessions, and random
 vandalism. Behind you, to the NORTHEAST, leads back out into the tumult
 of the wider internet.

 A frumpy, bespectacled librarian - wearing a jetpack - watches you
 warily. If you dared, you could probably ask him to retrieve some

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">World Wide Web</span>
 The Net. The Web. An endless sea of data, in which your hard drive is
 only a fragement, a mere raft bobbing among the mountainous waves. To
 the NORTH you see a towering search engine. To the EAST you can hear
 the chatter of a social network. To the SOUTHWEST there is a stately

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Cloud</span>
 You are high above the fields of cyberspace, the great hubbub of sites
 and links. Here, all is calm and serene. You are floating. Blue sky. A
 lazy white cloud of data floats by. It smiles at you. The other clouds
 smile too, for they are marhmallow fluffy and secure. A cherubim flies
 on tiny wings - it is going on its rounds, making sure your data is
 Reliable and Secure. As it passes, the nearby clouds sigh in
 contentment.

 ABOVE you orbits a communication satellite. Far BELOW are the vast
 interconnected cyberplanes of the internet. Floating among the clouds
 is a flock of hot air balloons that have been tethered together to
 create a makeshift, bulbous sphere. You think could squeeze INSIDE this

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Blogosphere</span>
 All around you are the hot air balloons, each decorated in their own
 bright colors and logos. Bloggers lean over the edge of their baskets
 to send carefully folded paper airplanes flying into the sphere. These
 glide into other balloons where they are unfolded, read, and commented
 on, before being sent back out into the air. OUTSIDE the balloons is
 the Cloud in which they float.

 One balloon in particular is near to you. Its lone pilot is wearing a
 red cape and goggles - you immediately recognize him as Cory Doctorow.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Communications Satellite</span>
 Space. Once it was the final frontier - now it's a post office. This
 satellite, orbiting high above the Earth's surface, is one of the great
 switching stations in the global network. It bears about as much
 resemblance to Sputnik as a ferrari does to a walking stick.

 Here calls and messages are routed and re-routed. Around you, data bees
 and web surfers hurry and scurry - all of them want to talk to the
 Router-Daemon.

 BENEATH you, you can just make out the white glimmer of The Cloud.

 The Router-Daemon is a robotic many-armed creature that points incoming

 angrily as you grab it, and flies away. Somehow, through it all, you
 can hear the electronic strains of Beethoven.

  Then slowly, everything calms down. The feathers settle on the shaken
 apps. Surely, that will have woken Jane up, though you doubt it will
 have put her in a cheery optimistic mood, ready to face the world. Only

 to oakthorn177. Jane is asking the elven prince to go on a quest with
 her.

 This is trouble. You need to stop her before she finishes up these

 The LAN at Jane's workplace resembles nothing so much as a late 19th
 century factory, complete with squalid concrete floor, metal roof, and
 dirty smoke. It's the sort of place where you might send orphans whose
 parents you particularly hated.

 In the center of the room is a great clanking, huffing, puffing
 machine. Surrounding the machine are thousands of starved and miserable
 looking monkeys, each typing away at typewriters which are somehow
 extruding mechanical parts. With each clack of a return key, a finished
 part flies from the top of a monkey's typewriter and attaches itself to
 the great machine in the middle. Sometimes this seems to cause the
 machine to puff faster, other times the part only lasts a few seconds
 before exploding and falling to the floor.

 You recognize Jane's particular monkey / typewriter representation from
 previous trips here. It's off to the EAST of the machine. To the WEST,
 you can see ProtectiTech's Central Server, separated from the rest of
 the machine room by glass windows and a glass door. UP from here, a
 wireless connection leads back to the satellite.

 A bulky, muscular looking ape creature with impressive fangs supervises
 the other monkeys. As it makes its rounds, occasionally it cracks its
 whip at an underperforming employee.

 One of the robots, the mailer-daemon, appears to be getting ready to

 Currently the camera has settled on a grainy black and white image of

 Grace,

 You're a hard worker. Responsible. That's why I'm giving you this
 assignment. The EYEmedia guys have changed up their order parameters

 build. You're going to need to stay late to pull this off, but if you
 do, there could be a promotion in it for you. All the materials and the

 It is a plan worthy of Batman, you decide. In its cunning simplicity,
 it has all the subtlety of the Dark Knight. Quickly, you find and
 replace all references to Grace with Jane's name. The course of events
 seems clear to you: Jane will jump at the chance to get a promotion and
 right her stumbling career. She"ll become so engrossed she won't even
 notice when she stays late and misses her date. It's foolproof! Now you
 just have to wait for Jane to get to work and read it.

  Your desperate fear has been replaced by a calm patience.

 BENEATH you, you can just make out the white glimmer of The Cloud.

 The Router-Daemon is a robotic many-armed creature that points incoming
 data in the correct direction. Three levers - one gold, one bronze, one
 silver - protrude from its torso. Lost data packets talk to it to
 receive instructions on where to go.

 Here is the individual behind the infamous elven prince - he even has a

 never even did a cursory search.

 For a moment you entertain the idea that Jane suddenly switch sexual

 they'd bring some much needed ambition and organization into Jane's
 life. Not to mention that then you wouldn't have to call off the date.

 To think that such a perfect match for Jane could have been working in

 Journey! More importantly, Andrew's a Tolkien fan. Never before had you
 considered the idea that Jane's knowledge of the Professor might

 You're glad it's not night. Out of the castle and to the SOUTH is the
 mountain road which leads back to the woods.

 Hanging above the mantle in the drafty main hall, you see an ancient

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Traveling Merchant Caravan</span>
 On the edge of the forest, a caravan of traveling merchants have set up
 shop. It's like a carnival, full of bright tents and gypsy wagons and
 loud merchants. A big mustachioed man juggles fire, while a small child
 pick pockets the onlookers. Players, identifiable by the names hovering
 above their heads, are trading their hard-earned bunny hides for money
 for new and better bunny-hunting weaponry. To the EAST, a well worn
 path leads into the forest.

 An old crone dressed in colorful patches and rags has just read the
 palms of a young dwarfling. Now she stares at you, and her pale blue
 eyes seem to dig into your mind.

 The bird ruffles its feathers in annoyance.

 The Documents folder almost jerks out of your grip, as if it had a life

 The old crone closes her eyes, and begins to speak in a low monotone:

 <span class="floydstyle em"> If to destroy this world, is what you seek </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em"> Bring the disease from higher planes </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em"> It feeds on thought and havoc it will wreak </span>

  When she opens her eyes she's all smiles and business again, as if
 nothing portentious had happened.

 the virus hiding inside claws its way out into the open. It howls in

 architectures and data protocols that make up this world - until you

 Jane's desktop. The place is a disaster. Unused icons clutter

 "dothisnow_Jan2_1999.txt").

 A webcam icon points NORTH. An e-mail icon leads NORTHWEST, towards the

 the popular online game.

 An error window, illustrated with a red circle crossed by a white X,

 This is your peephole. The blinds have been lifted, so now the room is
 lit by more than just the glow of the desktop monitor. Once, you think
 you recall, the bedroom had a floor, but now all that is visible are
 socks, programming manuals, and computer game boxes. Out of this
 morass, a futon rises, like a whale surfacing to breathe. You can't see
 anything else, but this is merely worrisome, as you know anything could
 be hiding beneath the mess.

 Jane is nowhere to be seen. Maybe she's finally gone to work, though
 you'd need some other camera to look through to find out. Jane is a
 software engineer at ProtectiTech, a big computer security firm.

 The Router-Daemon is a robotic many-armed creature that points incoming

 some other way to check on her. NORTH and SOUTH from here are Jane's
 closest neighbors on the network: Grace Grant and Andrew Ma,
 respectively. WEST from here, you see the other code monkeys, closer to
 the center of the LAN.

 The LAN at Jane's workplace resembles nothing so much as a late 19th

 dirty smoke. It's the sort of place where you might send orphans whose
 parents you particularly hated.

 You recognize Jane's particular monkey / typewriter representation from
 previous trips here. It's off to the EAST of the machine. To the WEST,
 you can see ProtectiTech's Central Server, separated from the rest of
 the machine room by glass windows and a glass door. UP from here, a

 The supervisor is rolled up in a ball, trying to escape the continuing

 To the EAST, you can see the code monkeys working. Here, the decor puts
 you in the mind of the ideal 1950s office, complete with wooden desks
 and rotary dial telephones. Processing paperwork and operating the

 vacuum tubes for brains. NORTH of here is a room whose door says
 SECURITY CAMERA. On the WEST side of the server is a small maintenance

 thought of it.

 Clearing your head, you disengage your own thoughts from the machine's
