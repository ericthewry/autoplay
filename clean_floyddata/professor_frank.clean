 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Reading Room</span>
 Professor Frank, an absent minded academic, has fallen asleep in the
 Auldtoon public library on Saturday afternoon, and has been locked in.
 He wakes up and looks around him. How will the daft old coot get out?
 The red door is to the south and the white door to the west, and an
 opening to the east. In the room there is a table, and a large window
 lets in light. On the floor is the Professor's briefcase.

 On the brown table are a science magazine, a green book and a red
 book.

>magazine


   What ???

>examine magazine


 Frank has been looking through the British Journal of Biology, but,
 much to his disappointment, there are no articles about newts, or any
 other types of amphibious creatures, in this month's edition.

>take magazine


 Taken.

>examine green


 The book is Professor Frank's masterwork, which he is revising for a
 new edition. The title of the book is: "The Life-Cycle of the Greater
 Crested Cannibal Newts of Loch Lomond  (Amphibius Maximus Crestus
 Autophagus  Lomondensis). "
>examine red


 (the red door)
 The red door is locked. Frank should explore the areas he can get to
 and look for the key. If he cannot find the key he can examine the
 door again, and perhaps will get some help!!
  Frank sees nothing unusual about the red door.

>examine red book


 The book is called, "Alice Through the Looking Glass." Even Professor
 Frank has read this already.

>examine me


 Frank is the distinguished Professor of Biology at the Scottish
 University of Science, and is one of the world's leading experts on
 those tiny creatures, the newts, those little amphibians who live in
 ponds and lochs, close cousins of the frogs. Professor Frank's
 masterwork, which he is revising for a new edition, is his book, "The
 Life-Cycle of the Greater Crested Cannibal Newts of Loch Lomond
 (Amphibius Maximus Crestus Autophagus  Lomondensis). "

>take all


 green book: Taken.
 red book: Taken.
 white door: That's hardly portable.

 schoolboy has used superglue to stick it to the floor while Frank was
 asleep.
 large window: That's hardly portable.

>examine briefcase


 You can't see inside, since the briefcase is closed.

>open briefcase


 You open the briefcase, revealing the blue radio and a beetle.

>examine beetle


 The beetle is certainly not alive. It is a tiny stone beetle, made of
 polished granite.

>eat beetle


 That's plainly inedible.

>examine radio


 The blue radio is currently switched off.

>turn on radio
>turn on radio


 Frank switches on the blue radio and hears: "We interrupt your
 listening here on Radio Borders to bring you this important police
 announcement:  Lothian and Borders Police have issued a warning to
 motorists that there are sheep loose on the main carriageway near
 Ashkirk; look out for sheep on the A7 road near Ashkirk." Professor
 Frank himself is from Glasgow, where of course there are no sheep.



 Professor Frank appears to have broken the radio.

>look under table


 You find nothing of interest.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a red book
   a green book
   a science magazine

>examine white


 The white door is locked. Frank should explore the areas he can get to
 and look for the key. (HINT: try going through red door before white
 door).

>read green


 The book is Professor Frank's masterwork, which he is revising for a
 new edition. The title of the book is: "The Life-Cycle of the Greater
 Crested Cannibal Newts of Loch Lomond  (Amphibius Maximus Crestus
 Autophagus  Lomondensis). "
>read red


 (the red book)
 The book is called, "Alice Through the Looking Glass." Even Professor
 Frank has read this already.

>write book

>examine window


 You see nothing special about the large window.

>wake up


 The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.

>go back to sleep


   What ???

>open window


 Frank cannot get out of the library that way. The window is a sealed
 double-glazed unit.

>break window


  Professor Frank is behaving badly !
>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Reading Room</span>
 This is the Reading Room in the Auldtoon public library. The red door
 is to the south and the white door to the west, and an opening to the
 east. In the room there is a table, and a large window lets in light.
 On the floor is the Professor's briefcase.

>examine opening


   What ???

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alcove</span>
 Frank finds himself in an alcove. To the west is the Reading Room.
 Frank sees a green door to the north and also a blue door to south. A
 red notice is fixed to the blue door, and there is a small cage in the
 corner of the room.  A hoarse voice says: "Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of
 rum."

 Professor Frank is here.

>read notice


         DOPPELGANGER LABORATORY
         DIRECTOR: DOCTOR JEKYLL
   SCIENTIST: DOCTOR MIA HEIDBANGER

>examine cage


 The professor can see a large brightly coloured parrot in the  cage.
 A little metal plate on the cage says:" My name is Captain Flint."
 Frank vaguely remembers reading "Treasure Island " by Robert Louis
 Stevenson.....yes, Captain Flint was the name of Long John Silver's
 parrot, but that was only a work of fiction! The parrot hops out of
 his cage and starts to follow Frank. Now the professor has a
 companion. Since some parrots can talk, perhaps Captain Flint can help
 Frank to get out of the library.
 To ask a person (or a talking animal like Captain Flint, or perhaps a
 talking thing like a telephone or a computer with a speaker)
 something, the format is ASK A ABOUT B, so FRANK could try ASK PARROT
 ABOUT LIBRARY, ASK CAPTAIN FLINT ABOUT HELP, ASK PARROT ABOUT NEWTS,
 etc. The parrot may know more than Frank about what is happening!
 NOTE: when Captain Flint is the only character in the same place as
 the professor, you can simply type ASK ABOUT NEWTS/ASK ABOUT LIBRARY
 etc, and the program "knows" you (Professor Frank) are asking Captain
 Flint. If there is more than one character with Professor Frank you
 need to use the longer version of ASK including the name of the
 character that you want to answer the question. (ASK FLINT ABOUT
 COMPUTER etc.)

>eat parrot


 He's plainly inedible.

>examine parrot


 Frank looks at the parrot, but it look just like any other parrot.
 Frank, of course, knows nothing about parrots, only newts.

>kiss parrot


 Keep your mind on the game.

>ask about newts


 The parrot tells Frank: "I dined on newts several times, when I could
 not find anything else to eat, but they are not very tasty and
 normally I only eat bird seed." Frank is horrified; surely Captain
 Flint could not have eaten some of the very rare Greater Crested
 Cannibal Newts of Loch Lomond! The tiny creatures that Frank has
 studied all of his working life as a biologist!
>ask about corknuts


 There is no reply.

>pet parrot


   What ???

>ask about white door


 There is no reply.

>ask about rum


 There is no reply.

>ask about green door


 There is no reply.

 Now that the parrot has come out of the cage, you can see a gold ring
 there which was not visible before !

>examine ring


 You see nothing special about the gold ring.

>take ring


 Taken.

>wear ring


 You can't wear that!

>ask about ring


 There is no reply.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Staffroom</span>
 Now the professor is in the room where the library staff take their
 breaks.  There is a spiral staircase leading upwards, and to the south
 is the green door. There is a kitchen table, a fridge, and a computer
 in the room.

 On the kitchen table is the red jar.

 Professor Frank is here.

 Frank's avian companion flutters in after him.

>examine jar


 You can't see inside, since the red jar is closed.

>open jar


 You open the red jar, revealing Honey.

>eat honey


 Unfortunately, Professor Frank does not have a runcible spoon.

>give honey to flint


 The parrot does not like honey." I want some birdseed," says Captain
 Flint." That is what parrots eat."
>pour honey on parrot


 The Honey is not open.

>take honey


 Taken.

>open honey


 That's not something you can open.

>open fridge


 You open the blue fridge, revealing a spicy haggis, a tattie scone and
 a Forfar bridie.

>examine bridie


 Why don't you ask the parrot about that?

>ask about bridie


 The parrot replies: "A delicious looking bridie! Bridies are a type of
 Scottish food, pastry filled with minced beef and onion. Very tasty! "

>examine scone


 Why don't you ask the parrot about that?

>ask about scone


 Captain Flint says: " Tattie scones are a favourite of Scottish
 people, fried with bacon, eggs, sausages, black pudding, and white
 pudding for a delicious, healthy, and nutritious full Scottish
 breakfast."
>ask about haggis


 Captain Flint says: "A haggis can be very useful here in the CLOSED
 LIBRARY. There are people who roam about here when the library is
 closed, who are particularly fond of a delicious haggis. Perhaps you
 should take the haggis with you."
>examine computer


 The computer is not switched on.

>turn on computer


 Some text appears on the computer screen.  " Beware of the
 plutonium."  Frank asks himself: " What does that mean?"
>ask flint about plutonium


 The parrot says he thinks a plutonium is a person from the distant
 country of Plutonia.

>look

 in the room.

 You can see Captain Flint here.

>examine table


 Professor Frank looks at the table and on it he sees nothing.

>examine computer


 There are some words on the  computer screen.  " Beware of the
 plutonium." "What does that mean?", Frank asks himself.

>use computer


>ask about computer


 Captain Flint says: "I am a parrot Frank. What do parrots know about
 computers?  Perhaps there is something inside it?
>open computer


 That's not something you can open.

>look in computer


 You find nothing of interest.

>turn off computer


 You switch the red computer off.

>turn on computer


 Some text appears on the computer screen.  " Beware of the
 plutonium."  Frank asks himself: " What does that mean?"
>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Yellow Room</span>
 Frank is now in a room with yellow painted walls. There is a black
 desk, and a mirror on the north side of the room. The spiral staircase
 winds downwards. There is a gray door to the east.
 "I have not had anything to eat for more than 120 years, ever since  I
 was created by Robert Louis Stevenson, Frank," says Captain Flint.
 "All the people in Treasure Island have lots of meals, but no one ever
 thinks to feed the parrot! See if you can find me some birdseed."

 Professor Frank is here.

 The bird  follows Frank.

>examine desk


 There is a red drawer in the black desk.

>open it

>open drawer


 You open the red drawer, revealing the electric torch and the blue
 box.

>take torch


 Taken.

 Frank switches on the torch.

>turn off torch


 Frank switches off the torch.

 You switch the electric torch off.

>examine box


 The blue box  has a label which reads: "Cage Birds Love  Caledonian
 Bird Seed, with vitamins  and minerals added. A favourite of budgies,
 canaries, and parrots everywhere."
>give box to parrot


 The parrot refuses to take the blue box. He looks at Frank: "The box
 is closed, professor! Did you not notice that I do not have any hands;
 because I have wings; because I am a bird! How am I supposed to open
 the box?? Wake up, Frank, you dozy old geezer!"
>open box


 There is birdseed in the blue box.

>give birdseed to flint


 The parrot munches all the tasty birdseed. "I feel much better now,"
 says Flint.

>examine mirror


 The mirror is against the north wall of the room. Frank peers into it,
 and of course only sees his reflection.

>take mirror


 That's hardly portable.

>look in mirror


 You find nothing of interest.

>ask about mirror


 Captain Flint  says: "I think there is something strange about that
 mirror."
>break mirror

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Yellow Room</span>
 Frank is now in a room with yellow painted walls. There is a black
 desk, and a mirror on the north side of the room. The spiral staircase
 winds downwards. There is a gray door to the east.


 You can see Captain Flint here.

>go east


 You can't, since the gray door is in the way.

>open door


 Frank opens the gray door.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long Room</span>
 A long dim room stretches ahead of Frank. A striped door is to the
 east with a notice stuck to it, and the gray door to the west.  Frank
 sees a large black cabinet against the wall, and a white toy rabbit.

 You can see the white toy rabbit here.

 Professor Frank is here.

 The bird zooms through the air.

>examine rabbit


 The professor looks at the rabbit, thinking it might be a strange kind
 of furry newt. On the back of the rabbit he notices a zipper.

>unzip rabbit


 You open the rabbit.  Inside you see a glass key!

>take key


 That could be useful.

>examine key


 You see nothing special about the glass key.

>read notice


  The Professor reads the notice which says
 "Doctor Jekyll's Science Laboratory. DO NOT ENTER. Doppelganger
 experiment in progress."
  Frank wonders what this is all about.

>examine cabinet


 There is a large black cabinet against the wall. The cabinet is
 closed.

>open cabinet


 Frank pulls open the door of the cabinet and a large ugly man bursts
 out of it!!
 "It is the horrible Big Scunner, a nasty character from Glasgow," the
 parrot tells Frank.
 "Look at at that strangely coloured chicken," says The  Big Scunner,
 pointing at Captain Flint , who is perched upon Frank's shoulder.
 "That bird will do for a nice chicken curry for supper."
 "Squawk! Squawk!", cries Captain Flint, and launches himself into the
 air, where he flies around up near the ceiling of the room, as The Big
 Scunner tries in vain to catch him. The Big Scunner cannot leap high
 enough.
 "You there, you little pipsqueak, what gift have you got for me?" ,
 The Big Scunner asks  Frank.

>give haggis to scunner


 The Big Scunner doesn't seem interested.

>give big scunner a knuckle sandwich


   What ???

>give flint to scunner


 The Big Scunner doesn't seem interested.

>ask scunner about gift


 There is no reply.

 Too late now. The Big Scunner charges at the professor and throws him
 into the black cabinet, locking the door! What does Frank do now?
 There is nothing he can do! But the Professor Frank Emergency Rescue
 Squad arrives to rescue Frank. (You can check at top of screen on
 right, how many "rescues" Frank has left.) As the team help Frank out
 of that horrible dark cabinet and drag The Big Scunner away, a silver
 key falls to the floor. Frank picks it up. It may come in useful.


  Frank has used up one of his  rescues !! He has 7 rescues left.

 says the Big Scunner. "I will have a snack. Here is something you may
 find useful." The Big Scunner gives a silver key to Frank and wanders
 off, much to Frank's relief.

 The scientist Doctor Jekyll is here.

 The Chemical Cabinet is against the wall. A sheet of paper stuck to
 the cabinet says, "Chemicals stored here - do not open."

 You can also see a science bench (on which are a blue flask and a test
 tube) and The Lurkatron Doobedoo Machine X5 here.

 Professor Frank is here.

 "Are we ever going to get out of here, Frank?", asks Captain Flint.

>no


 That was a rhetorical question.

>open cabinet


 Out leaps a strange-looking  young woman who is wearing a white lab
 coat! "It is Jekyll's loony assistant scientist, Doctor Mia
 Heidbanger," says the parrot.
 "I have been trapped in that cupboard," she shouts.  "I am absolutely
 bungaloid. My brain is debegrotomised, trying to solve all these
 scientific problems. Who locked me in the cupboard? Who are these
 strangers?"
 "Ah, it is young Mia," says Doctor Jekyll to Frank and the parrot.
 "She will answer any questions you have about our work."
 Mia says to Professor Frank and Captain Flint: "I have lots of
 knowledge in my giant brain. You must ask interesting questions.
 Yarooobaloo."
 Note: If you are not Scottish, perhaps you think Mia's surname has a
 spelling error? No, the common Scottish word "heid" (pronounced
 "heed") means "head".
>ask mia about chemicals


 "Experimentation with dangerous chemicals is hazardous...perhaps I
 will mix some up at random? Would you like to see what happens?"

>examine doctor


 Which do you mean, Doctor Mia Heidbanger or Doctor Jekyll?

>examine jekyll


 Doctor Jekyll is a tall man dressed in black. He peers" at the
 Professor and Captain Flint from under bushy eyebrows.

 his scientific experiments. Sometimes very strange things happen in
 the laboratory."
>ask flint about mia


 "Raving mad, pal. But she knows about the laboratory. Ask her about

 The scientist Doctor Jekyll is here.

 You can also see Doctor Mia Heidbanger, Captain Flint, a science bench
 and The Lurkatron Doobedoo Machine X5 here.

>examine machine


 Frank looks at the machine. On the front of the machine is a metal
 nameplate which reads:
                  Lurkatron Doobedoo Machine X5.
                 Designed by Doctor Mia Heidbanger
       Made in Scotland by Luddite Engineering Company, Glasgow.
  A blue drawer is part of the strange machine, as is a black slot.
 There is a glass screen on the front but it is dark, because the
 machine is not switched on. A green lever and a blue lever are
 attached to the machine. The word "ENERGISER" is printed beside the
 blue lever.
>pull blue level


   What ???

>pull blue lever


 Bungaloo!! Nothing happens because the machine is not switched on!

>turn on machine


 Pull the green lever to switch the machine on and off.

>pull green lever


 Frank touches the green lever. There is a low humming sound from
 inside the machine. With a click the black slot slides open and a
 glass screen lights up at the front of the Lurkatron.

>examine screen



           On the screen at the front of the device is says:

 into the library before, looking for things to steal."
>examine ned


 Professor Frank sees a nasty looking character glaring at him.

>OPEN BLACK BOX


 You open the black storage box, revealing a torn page.

>READ PAGE


 Frank picks up the page, which looks as though someone has torn it out
 of a book. Across the top of the page is printed "RUSSIAN FOLK TALES
 AND LEGENDS   by Ivan Petrov Page 78".  Below this is the text of the
 page:
 It is headed  "BABA YAGA AND HER BIG CHICKEN HUT."  Frank reads the
 page..........it is the story of the legendary Russian  witch Baba
 Yaga and her strange and frightening house which walks around after
 her, on legs like those of a giant chicken or turkey. (So, whenever
 she wanted to go home.......she was already home!!) The Russian
 composer Mussgorsky composed a famous musical work "Pictures at an
 Exhibition", comprising a number of pieces of music about different
 paintings he had seen at an art show, and one of the pictures was a
 painting of  Baba Yaga's strange walking house. This well-known piece
 of music is called "The Hut On Fowl's Legs."
 The Professor, however, is not interested in the Russian folk
 tales.
 Too late now, the wee ned charges at Frank, seizes Frank and is about
 to stuff him into the red box! Just in time the Professor Frank
 Emergency Rescue Squad arrives to rescue Frank. (You can check at top
 of screen on right, how many "rescues" Frank has left.)  They drag Wee

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cloakroom</span>
 Frank is a dimly-lit room. A large wooden barrel and a blue chest are
 on the floor. There are doors to the north and west.

 Professor Frank is here.

 The parrot flies in after Frank.

>open chest


 You open the blue chest, revealing a blue cloak and a pointed hat.

>take all


 Captain Flint: I don't suppose Captain Flint would care for that.
 blue cloak: Taken.
 pointed hat: Taken.
 black potion: Professor Frank is being extremely foolish! He tries to
 pick up the liquid, but, not surprisingly, it trickles through his
 fingers back into the container.
 Black Door: That's hardly portable.
 Entry Door: That's hardly portable.
 blue chest: That's hardly portable.
 wooden barrel: That's hardly portable.

>wear cloak


 You put on the blue cloak.

>wear hat


 You put on the pointed hat.

 The blue cloak is very large. It is a wizard's cloak.  Now Professor
 Frank hopes than he will pass as a wizard in this strange castle.

>examine barrel


 You can't see inside, since the wooden barrel is closed.

>open barrel


 Frank lifts the lid of the barrel.  There is a fearsome creature
 inside!
 Grumblehog the Ogre leaps out!! "It is Grumblehog the Ogre,
 Frank," says the parrot. The nasty ogre growls and moves towards
 Professor Frank!
 The ogre pursues Frank!

 against one wall of the room. Stuck to the wall is a blue sheet of
 paper. There are doors to the east and south.

 You can see The Z8 Cybermystic Autoclave Machine here.

       ATTENTION ALL WIZARDS!
 Before going to the meeting hall you must use the Z8 machine to make
 up your own Magic Dust. The door to the east leading to the Wizards
 Hall has a Hermetic Analyser installed, as you can see. This will test
 the dust for your proficiency in the ancient art of wizardry. Warning!
 Impostors will be thrown in the Dungeon!

>examine machine


 Frank looks at the machine. On the front of the machine is a metal
 nameplate which reads:
                      Z8  CYBERMYSTIC AUTOCLAVE
           Made in Scotland by Luddite Engineering Company, Glasgow.
 There is a video screen on the front but it is dark. There is a
 black lever with written beside it "ON/OFF" and a red lever with a
 label "MIX NOW" beside it. You can also see a green slot at the front
 of the machine. The machine does not seem to be switched on.

 IF THE TEXT ON THE SCREEN IS TOO SMALL TO READ COMFORTABLY, MOVE THE
 CURSOR ALONG THE ICONS AT THE TOP OF THE GAME SCREEN UNTIL THE WORD
 "OPTIONS" IS DISPLAYED, AND YOU CAN THEN CHANGE THE TYPE SIZE. ( If
 playing on op sys other than Windows + frotz.exe interpreter, also
 known as Frobozz Magic Interpreter, no doubt similar changes can be
 made).
 HOW TO PLAY
 PROFESSOR FRANK
 THE MAGIC WORD IS AVAILABLE! The magic word is the word UNDO, and (as
 you have probably guessed) this single-word command allows you to
 "take back" your last move.
 BASICS:  Everything mentioned on the screen may give you more
 information if you EXAMINE it. Examples: EXAMINE TABLE, EXAMINE FRANK,
 EXAMINE DOOR, EXAMINE MAD DOG, EXAMINE DESK. You think EXAMINE is a
 long word to type?  All right, you just need to type X for EXAMINE,
 for example, X BOOK, X FRANK, X TABLE etc. You can try some other
 verbs also such as PUSH/ TURN/ THROW/ TAKE/ BREAK/ UNLOCK/ EAT/
 SHAKE/CLIMB (all followed by a noun), such as READ BOOK perhaps?
 Remember if something could be inside a container, then as well as X
 BOX, OPEN BOX, try LOOK IN BOX. If you move something or pick
 something up, repeat EXAMINE  and LOOK IN, as you may have uncovered
 something hidden.( For example if you find a book in a box, after TAKE
 BOOK, try LOOK IN BOX again....you might find something that was
 hidden under the book!! As in real life, you might want to LOOK UNDER
 some things, like beds, chairs, tables etc.
 The one word command LOOK (or just L) answers the question: Where am
 I?; the command INVENTORY (or just I) answers the question: What
 things am I carrying?
 SAVE. If you want to save your position in the game the command is
 SAVE. To load a saved game the command is RESTORE and the game will
 load, then type LOOK and you will be back in the position you saved.
 QUIT to end the game.
 HELP? HELP?  What? You want more help while you are playing the game?
 Try the command HELP in each location. What? You want a short form for
 HELP? All right, just type H for help. If you are reading this at the
 very start of the game, type HELP after you have read these
 instructions. There is lots of HELP in the first room. HELP in some
 rooms is variable, changing after you have done certain things in the
 room, so try investigating things for yourself. The response to HELP
 can also change after you come into a place again.
 BIG CLUE: There are a number of dangerous characters that the
 Professor will meet in the game. Some of them, just like ordinary
 people, are particularly fond of something good to eat, a tasty snack!

 MOVING ABOUT: To move around the game the commands are: GO NORTH,
 SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP and DOWN. You can use single letters for these
 commands:  N,S,E,W,U and D  That's easy enough ! If you are in a room
 and there is an opening to the south, the command S will take you to
 that other room unless there is a closed door. Many text adventure
 games use four other horizontal directions ( NE, NW, SE, SW) but these
 are NOT used in "Professor Frank" so you do NOT have to try them.
 Other short commands are LOOK and INVENTORY,  just use L and I for
 these.  If the description of the room goes off the top of the screen,
 just type LOOK or L to recall the display. INVENTORY or I  shows the
 items you are carrying with you. If you find a silver key and type
 TAKE KEY, then later when you type INVENTORY, you will see that you
 have the key (and anything else you have taken). If you don't want to
 carry the item any longer, type DROP KEY. HINT: In this game, each key
 is only used once, so after unlocking something, you can drop that
 key.
 DOORS:  After typing W the program may tell you "the green door is
 there".  Try OPEN GREEN DOOR.  If the door is not locked the program
 will open the door, and now when you type WEST or ENTER GREEN DOOR you
 will go into the other room.  If a door is locked you may need to find
 some way of unlocking it, often (but not always) a key, such as UNLOCK
 RED DOOR WITH RED KEY
 COMMON TYPES OF COMMANDS:  Normally a verb and a noun: OPEN DRAWER,
 CLIMB STAIRS. Other possible commands could be: EAT APPLE, THROW ROCK
 AT SCORPION, OPEN BOX, READ NOTICE, PULL RED LEVER, PRESS ELEVATOR
 BUTTON. Sometimes, as in normal speech, we have more than one noun
 after a verb:  PUT APPLE IN BOX, ATTACK DRAGON WITH CREAM CAKE, etc,
 etc. Commands like this are also used in "Professor Frank" and other
 text-adventure games.
 TALKING TO OTHER CHARACTERS:  It is difficult to create real
 conversations between people (well, it is for a simpleton like me!);
 so we simply use the formula ASK A ABOUT B, such as ASK PARROT ABOUT
 LIBRARY. Yes, soon after the game starts, Professor Frank will have a
 companion who will answer lots of questions through the game; that
 well-known literary character Captain Flint, Long John Silver's parrot
 in "Treasure Island".
 NOTE: when Captain Flint is the only character in the same place as
 the Professor, you can simply type ASK ABOUT NEWTS/ASK ABOUT
 LIBRARY/ASK ABOUT LABORATORY etc, and the program knows you (Professor
 Frank) are asking Captain Flint. If there is more than one character
 with Professor Frank you need to use the longer version of ASK
 including the name of the character that you want to answer the
 question.(ASK PARROT ABOUT COMPUTER etc.)
 If you get an error message, first  CHECK YOUR SPELLING. I suggest
 that you use LARGE LETTERS when typing in commands, as it is easier to
 spot spelling mistakes. (The error message in this game is the word "
 What???")  If your spelling is correct, try a different command. For
 example if the program rejects PULL RED LEVER, try PUSH RED LEVER, or
 MOVE RED LEVER.

 EXTRA LIVES! There are no difficult puzzles to solve, no nameless
 rooms in a maze to get through.  If Professor Frank does not get into
 trouble, you will not enjoy the game. Anyway, the Professor Frank
 Emergency Rescue Squad will come to your assistance - eight times!
 (See top right of screen for how many "rescues" you have left.)
 AIM OF THE GAME? To have some fun! ( I only included the 10 hidden
 gold rings for those who insist that a game must be "winnable." This
 game is mainly intended to give you a few laughs.)
  Remember! Type the  command LOOK to recall where you are in the game.
  SHORT COMMANDS:   L,I,X,H,N,S,E,W,U,D

 a join in the structure of the device. A screen lights up at the front
 of the Autoclave.

 strange people to the east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wizards Hall</span>
 Frank is in the great hall. Three mighty wizards are here sitting at a
 high table, and all the ordinary wizards and sorcerers and standing
 around chatting, eating and drinking from the delicious supplies laid
 out on the long table.

 On the banqueting table are a magic pie, a cuvalok fruit, the xblob
 cheese, a green jug, a white jug and a red jug.

 The Red Wizard is here.

 The Black Wizard is here.

 The Wizard Lady is here.

 You can also see the green casket here.

 Professor Frank is here.

 A flying magician whizzes through the air, drinking a can of beer.
 He points his finger at Frank and the parrot as he passes and shouts
 "Who let them in? They are another couple of troublemakers from that
 library in Scotland by the looks of them."

 The parrot is here also.

>examine pie


 You see nothing special about the magic pie.

 "A real Scottish wizard was here once before," says a Chinese wizard
 lady. "You remember, he would not buy anyone a drink?"

>examine fruit


 You see nothing special about the cuvalok fruit.

 "Shall we do a vanishing spell on the mighty Wizardo Franko and that
 half-witted canary of his?" asks a tiny bespectacled wizard, who has
 an owl perched on his shoulder.

>examine xblob


 It looks like a delicious piece of cheese.

 "Give this wee Scottish scunner some black pudding, or mince and
 tatties," remarks the Seer of Zobrak." That's what they like to eat,
 the kiltie savages!".

>take xblob


 Taken.

 Ebenezer the magic geezer is here. Baba Yaga is drinking vodka, but
 there is no sign of Big Chicken Hut.

>examine green jug


 In the green jug is beer.

 "What kind of bird is that, with  Wizardo Franko, and why has Frank
 not got a kilt on if he is from Scotland?" shouts the Sorcerer of
 Madrid, gargling enthusiastically from a bottle of Rioja, and pausing
 to throw a cream bun at Captain Flint.

>examine white jug


 In the white jug is milk.

 The Bog Druid of Killarney throws a Guinness bottle at the three
 wizards on the platform. He starts to sing the Irish ballad
 "Skibbereen".

>examine red jug


 In the red jug is glook juice.

 " I am in charge here," shrieks the Lady Wizard of Branxholm. "Who
 threw that beer bottle at me?"

>ask yaga about glook juice


   What ???

>ask flint about glook juice


 There is no reply.

 The Sadistic Mystic of Kendal  says "I think there are impostors
 infiltrating our meeting. Look at that parrot! Perhaps he should be
 zingalooed. I have my suspicions about some people here! "

>take white jug


 Taken.

 The Sybil of Zugzwang shouts: " Who cares?  We are supposed to be
 having a party here. Who ate all the dragon steaks?"

>examine casket


 You can't see inside, since the green casket is closed.

 The Shadow Lurker shouts "Why haven't we got any decent wine at this
 party?

>open it


 It seems to be locked.

 Crafty the Spellwrangler shouts "It must be my turn to be Chief
 Wizard for a year!", but no one pays any attention.
 The Red Wizard points at a man in strange clothing and says, "I don't
 believe that guy calling himself Yussuf the Desert Djinn is a real
 magician. How did he get in here?"
 "I am not happy with that old Scottish wizard Frank either," shrieks
 the Lady Wizard.

>take casket


 Taken.

 The Tattie Bogle of Drumnadreich says "What's wrong with being
 Scottish? The Lairds of Drumnadreich have been known for centuries for
 their magic powers."
 The Wizard Lady points her magic wand at the unlucky "Yussuf the
 Desert Djinn" (as he calls himself), who is dressed like an ancient
 Egyptian. "Off to the dungeon," she shouts, and the wizards cheer as
 Yussuf vanishes in a flash of light.
