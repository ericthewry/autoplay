 Each year on Samhain night, Ghosterington Manor, the lair of legendary
 (and dead) bad poet, futurist and occultist Vigilance Ghosterington,
 materialises atop the same lonely cliff. It stays there for three
 hours, tempting adventurers to brave its dangers before disappearing
 at midnight for another year. It is said that Ghosterington's last
 four poems - the worst he ever wrote, now worth millions of dollars -
 are still inside the manor. But nobody has lived to bring them out.

 This year is your year, for you are the famous adventurer and treasure
 finder Jubilee Grief, and you're determined to survive the dangers of
 Ghosterington Manor, find the poems, sell them and retire as a (more)
 famous millionaire.

</span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cliff face</span>

 A screaming wind lashes the cliff face as you ascend it with your
 anti-spelunking equipment. Suddenly a higher pitched squeaking pierces
 through to your ears. After your recent trip to the Amazon you'd know
 that sound anywhere: Killer vampire bats!

 Without hesitation you whip out your six shooter and kick away from
 the cliff face, scanning for potential attackers. Three rapidly
 approaching dark shapes swing into view and you open fire - BLAOW
 BLAOW BLAOW!

 The three clipped bats flap and flail as they tumble to their deaths
 hundreds of feet below. You use your climbing pack to brace yourself
 as you swing back into the cliff, but the violent collision tears open
 a side pocket and your box of ammunition tumbles into space. Drat! Now
 you've only got the three bullets in your gun left to use in the
 house. Better make them count.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clifftop</span>
 Windswept and thoroughly bedraggled, you finally manage to haul
 yourself over the top of the cliff. Untangling yourself from your
 climbing pack, you contemplate that which stands before you.
 Ghosterington Manor is huge, black, wooden and windowless. Its
 famously inviting front door stands to your north. The cliff plummets
 away from you in all other directions, making you dizzy.

 You can see your climbing pack here.

>examine me


 Your hair's tied back in a tight ponytail and you're wearing your
 flexible black climbing and spying catsuit. Your minimal look has
 become all the rage with female adventurers.

>examine pack


 The pack is a big pile of ropes and pulleys you used to get up here.
 You'll leave it here by the cliff until it's time to leave.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a black catsuit (being worn)
   a six shooter

>examine shooter


 This trusty weapon has extricated you from more sticky situations than
 you can recall. It's loaded with three bullets.

>examine catsuit


 It makes you totally inconspicuous or attractive as the situation
 calls for. Amazing!

 Messing with your catsuit could get you killed!

 You can see your climbing pack here.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 You're in the vestibule of Ghosterington Manor, a well appointed hall
 of black marble. Doorways lead west and north, and you can leave the
 manor to the south.

>touch marble


 You feel nothing unexpected.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Creaky hall</span>
 You're in a creaky, high-ceilinged hall of blackest wood. There are
 rooms west and east from here.

>creak


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine ceiling


 You see nothing special about the ceiling.

>examine wood


 There's none blacker.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Contrition Corner</span>
 You're in the fabled Contrition Corner, where Vigilance Ghosterington
 was said to have flagellated himself after writing each of his awful
 poems. The stories must have been true because the walls really are
 red with his blood! Doorways leave this creepy room to the north and
 east.

 On the west wall is a painting of Vigilance Ghosterington himself.

>examine painting


 Ghosterington's generally weak and tardy face, pale beneath his
 widow's peak, is compensated for by a rather cruel but good looking
 mouth.

>examine mouth


 As you step closer to examine the mouth, a tiny voice from behind the
 painting whispers:

 "Brown cow's what I used to use
  I need another living muse
  tell me now what should it be
  as well you might, ho ho, hee hee!"

 The voice whispers:

 "Your answer, poorly,
  makes me sorely."

>examine blood


 The walls are dark with the ancient dried out blood of a self-hating
 bad poet. It's sad. Sad and gross.

>look behind painting


 You can't see any such thing.

>move painting


 Nothing obvious happens.

 A white statue materialises in the room. Perspiration immediately
 breaks out on your forehead. You instinctively realise that this is
 the thing called Terror Statue.

>SAVE
>cf1
 %% Enter a save filename to write:
 Ok.

>examine statue


 A tall white marble statue of a robed man. You want to lift your eyes
 to his face but you're too afraid to look.

>punch statue


 Your fear prevents you from approaching Terror Statue. The only way to
 attack him is by shooting at him.

>shoot statue


 The statue vanishes in the blink of an eye just before your bullet
 would have hit it.

 You've got two more bullets.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Way</span>
 The western way continues in all directions - except west.

 An armoudillo shell lies discarded on the floor here.

 You hear an alarming grinding and ticking sound as a silvery figure
 plods into the room. It's a clockwork girl. Her bloody metal face is
 stretched into a permanently agonised grimace. She's wielding an axe
 and looking at you.

>take shell


 You can tell at a glance that it's unwieldy and would reduce your
 ability to adventure. It might be worth examining more closely,
 though.

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Way</span>

>examine girl


 She's hideous, built out of metal and chunks of female flesh and tied
 together with veins and gristle.

>examine shell


 You make a move towards the armoudillo shell -

 Emitting an angry buzzing sound, the clockwork girl spins towards you
 and deftly removes your head with her axe.

 This is a plush room brightly lit by panels far above you in the walls
 and with a lush rug underfoot. Exits go south and east.

 A writing desk is here. This must be where Ghosterington birthed his
 dread works.

 The clockwork girl plods into the room. The rug muffles her footsteps.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 There's a big, dusty bed here. You wonder if Ghosterington ever really
 slept in this manor. The place has shown no signs of being anything
 than unliveable. Exits go west, south and east.

>hide under bed


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look under bed


 You find nothing of interest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Golden Room</span>

 You hear a click from the floor as you enter the room.

 You see nothing special about the floor.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern Way</span>
 The eastern way continues in all directions - except east.

 A long dead plant sits in a pot here, black and thoroughly dry.

>take plant


 You can tell at a glance that it's unwieldy and would reduce your
 ability to adventure. It might be worth examining more closely,
 though.

>examine plant


 One of the papery leaves is in fact not a leaf but a piece of paper.
 You take it.

 The clockwork girl plods into the room.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pink Room</span>
 This room is upholstered in pink velvet. The nauseating colour and
 texture makes you shudder. Exits lead west and south.

 There's a small vanity here.

 The clockwork girl plods into the room.

 flat.

 The rug looks a bit loose. The clockwork girl is standing on it,
 watching you.

>pull rug


 You yank the rug and the clockwork girl topples over. She thrashes
 about madly, whirring and clicking like an overturned beetle, but
 she's not flexible enough to get back on her feet.

 A cold wall of pure fear is radiating from the statue. Your limbs
 tremble, your blood runs icy, then every part of you just stops at
 once.

 The voice whispers:

 "With suchly flunk
  You truly stunk."

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Creaky hall</span>
 You're in a creaky, high-ceilinged hall of blackest wood. There are
 rooms west and east from here.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 You're in the vestibule of Ghosterington Manor, a well appointed hall
 of black marble. Doorways lead west and north, and you can leave the
 manor to the south.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern Way</span>
 The eastern way continues in all directions - except east.

 A long dead plant sits in a pot here, black and thoroughly dry.

>eat plant


 Let's get sane.

>push plant


 It is fixed in place.

 Terror Statue materialises in the room and your heart skips a beat.

>examine pot


 You already searched the long dead plant. There's nothing else there.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pink Room</span>
 This room is upholstered in pink velvet. The nauseating colour and
 texture makes you shudder. Exits lead west and south.

 There's a small vanity here.

 Terror Statue materialises in the room and your heart skips a beat.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 There's a big, dusty bed here. You wonder if Ghosterington ever really
 slept in this manor. The place has shown no signs of being anything
 than unliveable. Exits go west, south and east.

>examine bed


 You rummage through the bed and find a sheet of paper hidden amongst
 the sheets. You take it.

>examine paper b


 There's one word on it: purple.

 Terror Statue materialises in the room and your heart skips a beat.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Plush Room</span>
 This is a plush room brightly lit by panels far above you in the walls
 and with a lush rug underfoot. Exits go south and east.

 The clockwork girl is thrashing about uselessly on the floor.

 A writing desk is here. This must be where Ghosterington birthed his
 dread works.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Way</span>
 The western way continues in all directions - except west.

 An armoudillo shell lies discarded on the floor here.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Contrition Corner</span>
 You're in the fabled Contrition Corner, where Vigilance Ghosterington
 was said to have flagellated himself after writing each of his awful
 poems. The stories must have been true because the walls really are
 red with his blood! Doorways leave this creepy room to the north and
 east.

 On the west wall is a painting of Vigilance Ghosterington himself.

>examine mouth


 As you step closer to examine the mouth, a tiny voice from behind the
 painting whispers:

 "Brown cow's what I used to use
  I need another living muse
  tell me now what should it be
  as well you might, ho ho, hee hee!"

>purple elephant



 The painting slides aside and out of sight, revealing a passage to the
 west.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ooooh, a Secret Room!</span>
 Few things are more exciting in an adventurer's life than the
 discovery of a secret room. These things include: jetpacking around
 Mount Everest, playing Twister on the moon and sharing a pot of tea
 with Lara Croft. You have done all these things, but you're still
 pretty pleased to have discovered this tiny secret location in
 Ghosterington Manor. There's a lever on the wall and an exit to the
 east.

 Trying and failing to be inconspicuous in the corner is a chest.

>examine chest


 You open the chest and find something inside. It's one of Vigilance
 Ghosterington's poems! It's his famous lobster poem. You've hit the
 jackpot! You carefully take the poem.

>read lobster



 <span class="floydstyle em">Walking My Lobster On The Banks Of The Seine</span>

 I tied my lobster to a tree. I came back later, but woe was me!
 "Oh where oh where can my lobster be?" (I asked no-one in particular.)
 Mirelle offered the following: "Perhaps he has eloped in the romantic
 tradition."
 I considered what Mirelle had told me.
 We disagreed, and a short while later our relationship began to go
 downhill.

 My lobster ne'er was returned to me! Now I walk the Seine alone.

 Each year on Samhain night, Ghosterington Manor, the lair of legendary
 (and dead) bad poet, futurist and occultist Vigilance Ghosterington,
 materialises atop the same lonely cliff. It stays there for three
 hours, tempting adventurers to brave its dangers before disappearing
 at midnight for another year. It is said that Ghosterington's last
 four poems - the worst he ever wrote, now worth millions of dollars -
 are still inside the manor. But nobody has lived to bring them out.

 This year is your year, for you are the famous adventurer and treasure
 finder Jubilee Grief, and you're determined to survive the dangers of
 Ghosterington Manor, find the poems, sell them and retire as a (more)
 famous millionaire.

</span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cliff face</span>

 A screaming wind lashes the cliff face as you ascend it with your
 anti-spelunking equipment. Suddenly a higher pitched squeaking pierces
 through to your ears. After your recent trip to the Amazon you'd know
 that sound anywhere: Killer vampire bats!

 Without hesitation you whip out your six shooter and kick away from
 the cliff face, scanning for potential attackers. Three rapidly
 approaching dark shapes swing into view and you open fire - BLAOW
 BLAOW BLAOW!

 The three clipped bats flap and flail as they tumble to their deaths
 hundreds of feet below. You use your climbing pack to brace yourself
 as you swing back into the cliff, but the violent collision tears open
 a side pocket and your box of ammunition tumbles into space. Drat! Now
 you've only got the three bullets in your gun left to use in the
 house. Better make them count.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clifftop</span>
 Windswept and thoroughly bedraggled, you finally manage to haul
 yourself over the top of the cliff. Untangling yourself from your
 climbing pack, you contemplate that which stands before you.
 Ghosterington Manor is huge, black, wooden and windowless. Its
 famously inviting front door stands to your north. The cliff plummets
 away from you in all other directions, making you dizzy.

 (WHEN YOU'RE READY TO LEAVE THE MANOR, COME BACK HERE TO THE
