 Prologue

 ...Eleven years ago...

    It's been several months since my father went away to join the war.
 I promised I would look after our cottage, and that I really was old
 enough. I've done my best to keep our cottage tidy, but the winter has
 been hard and I might have used more wood than I should have, trying to
 stay warm. Our supplies are low.

 Cottage
 The place you call home with your father is a modest, mud-brick
 building with a thatched roof. There are two windows, one either side
 of the front door, that are framed with the lace curtains. The front
 door is currently standing open.
    The cottage stands at the top of a narrow, wooded valley. A rough
 track leads south, away from your cottage, through the trees.
    Nearby is a large pile of wood that needs to be chopped.

    An axe lies at your feet.

>GLK ABBREVIATIONS OFF

 Glk abbreviation expansions are already off.

>examine axe
 The axe is old and worn, and the handle is quite long.

>take axe
 You pick up the axe.

>examine curtains
 The curtains are white lace, with a delicate floral pattern evident in
 the stitching. Your father cares for these curtains with a strange
 devotion, washing them regularly and making sure nothing happens to
 them.
>examine me

 You are Torrin, son of Bradda. You are ten years old, almost eleven.
    You are dressed in a simple woollen tunic.

>take curtains
 After a brief analysis, you conclude the lace curtains aren't something
 you can take.

>cut curtains with axe
 You think about it, but that doesn't appear to be something you can
 cut.

>inventory
 You are wearing your tunic, and you are carrying an axe.

>feel curtains
 A strange thought enters your mind, but you decide to ignore it. It
 didn't make any sense.

>examine wood
 Please be more clear, what do you want to examine?  The firewood or the
 trees?

>firewood
 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in
 relation to the firewood.

>examine firewood
 It is a pile of long branches, each about six inches thick, which your
 father collected before he went off to war. They need to be chopped
 into smaller pieces if they're going to be of any use on a fire.

>chop firewood
 You grip the axe firmly and try to bring it down as hard as you can on
 the wood. But the axe head is unexpectedly heavy, and it flies out of
 your hands.

>examine trees
 The edge of the wood starts a few hundred yards away. The trees are
 mostly spruce and evergreens. Even on a bright day like today it is
 quite dark in among the trees.

>get axe head

>chop tree
 A strange thought enters your mind, but you decide to ignore it. It

>examine axe
 The axe is old and worn, and the handle is quite long.

>take axe
 You pick up the axe.

>examine tunic
 Your father made you this tunic earlier in the year, after you had
 grown out of your previous one. It is simple but well made, from a dark
 blue wool.

>remove tunic
 A strange thought enters your mind, but you decide to ignore it. It
 didn't make any sense.

 Cottage
 The place you call home with your father is a modest, mud-brick
 building with a thatched roof. There are two windows, one either side
 of the front door, that are framed with the lace curtains. The front
 door is currently standing open.
    The cottage stands at the top of a narrow, wooded valley. A rough
 track leads south, away from your cottage, through the trees.
    Nearby is a large pile of wood that needs to be chopped.

>examine door
 The door is made from oak and quite sturdy.  It is currently open.

>climb trees
 You give it a brief examination, but quickly reach the conclusion that
 it isn't climbable.

>examine valley
 The valley is a quiet place, with rich green grass spread over the open
 ground near your cottage, and trees further away providing protection.

>chop wood
 You haven't done this very often - your father made sure there was
 always enough firewood whenever he left for war. It's harder than you
 think.
    You grip the axe as hard as you can and swing it over your head. You
 keep hold of the axe this time, but miss the wood completely. The head
 of the axe buries itself into the ground, and it takes a moment to pull
 it free.

>examine valley
 The valley is a quiet place, with rich green grass spread over the open
 ground near your cottage, and trees further away providing protection.

>chop wood
 You swing the axe again, this time trying not to force it, but letting
 the swing of the axe carry it to the wood. It lands on the wood, and a
 small chip flies into the air.

>chop wood
 Once more you swing the axe, and manage to make it strike the same
 point on the wood as the last chop. The cut is getting deeper.

>take chip
 [unknowncommandvariation=%self_state%]

>chop wood
 Again you swing the axe over your head and bring it down on the wood.
 There is a resounding crack as a section of wood breaks free in a very
 satisfying manner.

    Even as the sound of your axe-fall echoes around the valley, you
 hear another sound growing louder. In moments you see the source - a
 group of about half a dozen men, most armed and mounted on horses,
 rides out of the trees and stops not far away. Two of the men dismount.
 One you recognise as Lord Reken, the man who took your father away to
 war. The other man you haven't seen before. He is dressed in priestly
 robes.
    You bow in greeting to these men.
    "Torrin," Lord Reken says. There's something wrong in his eyes, his
 voice. "I have some bad news."
    "What's wrong?" you ask. "Where's my father?"
    "Your father was very brave," Lord Reken answers. "He saved the king
 in a battle, but died from the wounds he received."
    The other man steps toward you.
    "You must also be brave," the priest said. "And trust in God. He
 will have mercy on all who trust in him."
    You pause for a moment. "What's going to happen to me?" you ask.
    Lord Reken's smile is kind, fatherly. "You'll be coming with me. The
 king has agreed to bring you into his care as ward."
    You look at your cottage, and then back at Lord Reken.
    A tear drops off your chin and lands on your tunic.

 ...Two years ago...

    My studies are becoming more arduous. The honour of one day becoming
 a knight dangles like a carrot in front of me, just beyond my grasp. My
 skill in areas like swordplay, jousting and archery are more than
 competent. But in others, like my religious duties, are less well
 developed. Yet I feel driven to excel.


 Your personal chambers
 The room is not large, but adequate for your needs. There is a small
 window in the western wall, and a door in the eastern one. A low bed
 sits against the northern wall, with an unmarked wooden chest at the
 foot of it.
    You are seated at your desk, a scroll open before you. A single
 candle rests in a metal holder close by, giving light to your work, but
 casting leaping shadows around the rest of the room.

    Sitting on the desk near the scroll is a small cup.

 [ Your personal chambers | Prologue as Torrin, son of Bradda, ward of
 the ki ]
>examine cup
 The cup is a rather plain and simple, carved from wood and without
 ornamentation. Inside the cup is some liquird.

>examine scroll
 It is part of your studies, things you need to learn and memorise in
 your journey to becoming a knight. It is sitting in the middle of the
 desk.

>pour cup on scroll
 You  consider pouring out the liquid, but decide in the end its worth
 is greater than that.

>read scroll
 You read a paragraph, but the words float before your eyes, defying
 meaning. It's very late, and you've been studying for several hours.
 Your head is pounding.

>drink cup
 You think about it for a moment, but you realise quickly that you can't
 drink the cup.

>drink liquid
 You pick up the cup and quickly swallow the contents. You feel your
 headache lifting almost instantly.

>undo
 Your personal chambers
 [The previous turn has been undone.]

>examine candle
 The candle is burning brightly, but low. There's probably no more than
 an hour of light left.

>open chest
 There is nothing in your chest that can help you study. You choose to
 ignore it.

>examine shadows
 The shadows dance across the wall to the beat of the flickering candle.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>drink liquid
 You pick up the cup and quickly swallow the contents. You feel your
 headache lifting almost instantly.

>read scroll
 You force your eyes to concentrate on the words printed on the page. A
 meaning starts to become clear. Something about having a servant's
 heart.

>read scroll
 Again you read the words on the page, and slowly you begin to
 understand. A true knight is a servant of the kingdom, willing to give
 his life to serve his king and, by extension, the people.

    There is a knock on the door. The door opens and a servant walks in.
    "Her Royal Highness, Princess Tevona, asked this to be delivered to
 you," the servant says, handing you a note. With a brief bow, the
 servant exits and closes the door.

>examine note
 A single piece of parchment, folded over, and with a wax seal that
 bears the symbol of the Princess of Rylane imprinted in it.  The note
 is closed.

>open note
 You break the seal on the note and open it.

>read note
 The note reads:

 "To Torrin, son of Bradda,
    Ever since you came into our family, we have been friends. You,
 Alsanter and I have grown up together, and shared so many experiences.
 But in recent days I have found myself thinking about you more and
 more.
    This may seem forward, but I don't want to let an opportunity pass.
 Is there anything in your heart for me? Do you think there is any way
 you and I could become more than friends?

    Your loving friend,
    Tevona"

>look in heart








 ...Two months ago...

    I can't believe Lord Sulanar would be so callous. To be secretly
 meeting with my fiance, Princess Tevona, during one of her many visits
 to Kathrentia. It seems too coincidental for him to be disappearing so
 secretly, at exactly the same time that Tevona is in his city. I trust
 the source of this information - there can be no mistake.
    I have to confront him. I don't know what his plans are, but given
 his general antagonism towards the king, I fear the issue might be more
 complicated than I know.


 Bottom of the stairway
 A grand marble stairway rises up before you, lit by a couple of flaming
 torches mounted on the walls. On the western wall between the torches
 is a massive shield into which has been pressed the coat of arms of the
 king of Rylane.
       There are two doors here; a rather ornate one in the northern
 wall leads towards the throne room which is open. The other door in the
 eastern wall leads to the kitchen, and is currently closed.

 [ Bottom of the stairway | Prologue as Torrin, son of Bradda, ward of
 the ki ]
>take torch
 After a brief analysis, you conclude the torches aren't something you
 can take.

>examine shield
 The shield is massive, having always been intended as a decoration
 rather than for protection. The emblem of the king of Rylane, a dragon
 standing on its hind legs and breathing fire, is pressed into the
 metal, and in the flickering torchlight the image almost seems alive as
 shadows dance over its surface.

>take shield
 After a brief analysis, you conclude the shield isn't something you can
 take.

>open east door
 You don't want to waste time fooling around with the doors. You need to
 confront Lord Sulanar as soon as possible. The longer you delay, the
 worse it could be.

>confront sulanar
 A stray thought enters your mind, but you dismiss it quickly. It just
 didn't make sense.

>go north
 For a fleeting moment you consider taking your time, but decide in the
 end it is too important to wait. You must see Lord Sulanar immediately.

>go up
 You climb up the stairway.


 Landing
 The broad sweep of the marble stairway ends here at a surprisingly
 sparsely appointed landing. Aside from a portrait of the king adorning
 the western wall, there is not much refinement here at all. Two
 archways, standing opposite each other in the northern and southern
 walls, provide exits, other than the stairs that lead back down.

 [ Landing | Prologue as Torrin, son of Bradda, ward of the king ]
>go north
 For a fleeting moment you consider taking your time, but decide in the
 end it is too important to wait. You must see Lord Sulanar immediately.

>go up
 You can't go in that direction, but you can move north, south and down.

>go north
 For a fleeting moment you consider taking your time, but decide in the

 You consider it, but that doesn't appear to be something you can get

 You consider attempting to open it, but in the end conclude there is no
 way to achieve it.

>go south
 You move south.

 Corridor outside Rixomas' rooms
 A long corridor stretches away to the west, lit by a series of torches
 mounted on the wall. On the floor of polished stone, running the entire
 length of the corridor, is a plush carpet. A stone archway marks the
 exit to the north.
    There is a door in the southern wall which you know to be the
 entrance to the wizard Rixomas' rooms. It is currently is closed.

 southern wall, which is currently closed.

 sufficient light to see the door to Lord Sulanar's rooms in the
 southern wall, while a banner in the colours of the region of Alallsia
 hangs on the opposite wall.

    Just as you approach Sulanar's door, a servant rushes in from the
 east.
    "Excuse me, Lord Torrin," he says breathlessly. "Prince Alsanter is
 demanding to speak with you."
    "What, now?" you ask.
    "Yes, my lord," the servant replies.
    You sigh. "Very well. I'll be right there."
    The servant hurries away to the east.

 The carpet, which runs the entire length of the corridor in an unbroken

 that is quite soothing on the eyes, as the carpet is to the feet.

>open door
 You think about pursuing your own problems first, but decide in the end
 that Alsanter must have a very good reason for sending for you. It's

 the crown prince of Rylane.

    A guard is on duty here.

 [ Corridor outside Prince Alsanter's rooms | Prologue as Torrin, son of

 unworthy of a knight of the realm.

>go north
 You walk through the open door.


 Prince Alsanter's rooms
 A standard table of unremarkable size stands in the centre of the room,
 on top of which is a cup. To the left, in front of a wide hearth and
 low-burning fire, is a chair of leather and wood that speaks of
 comfort, with an embroidered pillow resting on it. There is a window in
 the far wall with curtains open, through which you can see the late
 afternoon sky.
    In the centre of the room, spread on the floor, is a large, circular
 rug of rich green.
    A passage leads westwards, while the door back to the corridor
 stands open to the south.

    Prince Alsanter is standing on the rug, his face red with rage.

    "What is the meaning of this?" the prince demands almost before
 you've entered, as he waves a parchment at you. His voice is slurring
 slightly.

    You can respond by saying:
    (1) "What are you talking about?"
    (2) "I don't know."

 [ Prince Alsanter's rooms | Prologue as Torrin, son of Bradda, ward of

>1
    "I have no idea what you're talking about," you reply.
    "This!" The prince steps closer and waves the parchment in your
 face. "Recognise this?"

    You can respond by saying:
    (1) "No."
    (2) "Yes." (sarcastic)

>1
    "No," you reply as calmly as you can. "I've never seen that before."
    "This is your seal," the prince continues, pointing to the imprint
 in the wax. "This is your letter."
    "I have never seen that letter before in my life," you reply. "If it
 has my seal, then someone has made a forgery."
    "Do you deny that you're trying to usurp the throne?"

    You can respond by saying:
    (1) "Yes, I deny trying to usurp the throne."
    (2) "No, I am trying to usurp the throne." (sarcastic)

>1
    "Of course I'm not trying to usurp the throne," you respond, your
 voice rising a level. "Why on earth would I try to do that? You're my
 best friend, Tevona is my fiance, and I love the king like a father.
 What have I got to gain?"
    "You want power," Alsanter says. "You always have. This proves it."

    You can respond by saying:
    (1) "That's a complete lie."
    (2) "Goodbye."

>1
    "That's a complete lie, and you know it," you almost shout. "How
 dare you insult me like that."
    "Get out!" the prince yells in your face. "This isn't over, Torrin!
 I'll deal with you later!"

    You turn for the door, but as you do you hear a the sudden sound of
 rushing feet behind you. You just have time to hear Alsanter give some
 sort of shout before you feel an arm around your neck and a sickly
 smelling cloth is put over your mouth and nose. You struggle briefly,
 then all strength leaves your legs and you fall to the floor. Darkness
 claims you.

    You wake up and find yourself lying on the floor.

>tell the truth

 A stray thought enters your mind, but you dismiss it quickly. It just

 You stand up.


 Prince Alsanter's rooms
 You see all the things you expect to in the prince's rooms: the table
 and rug, the hearth, the chair and pillow, the curtains and window, the
 passage to the west, and the closed door to the south. But it all seems
 to fade into the background.

    The prince is lying face down on the rug, unmoving, with a dagger
 stuck in the middle of his back.

>panic
 A stray thought enters your mind, but you dismiss it quickly. It just
 didn't make sense.

>examine dagger
 All you can see of it is the jewelled handle protruding from Prince
 Alsanter's back, but even so, you recognise it. It's the one the king
 gave to you on your birthday a few years ago.

>examine prince
 The body of the prince is lying face down near the edge of the rug,
 completely still. Blood has poured out of the wound in his back,
 pooling on the rug. There are no other injuries on Alsanter's body,
 other than the knife-wound.

>take knife
 There is nothing in here that you want to take.

>take dagger
 You reach out your hand towards the dagger, but even as you do the
 situation changes.

    The door suddenly bursts open and three guards rush into the room.
 They take in the situation at once, and they all seem to reach the same
 conclusion.
    They draw their swords and level them at you.

 Part One: Mistake in Identity

    The lords of the kingdom have given their verdict, and with the
 smallest of movements the king, my foster father for more than ten
 years, has accepted their judgement. However reluctant they might have
 been in performing their task, it is done.
    I have been found guilty of the murder of Prince Alsanter.
    All my protestations of innocence have been in vain. Maybe trying to
 take the dagger wasn't the smartest idea.
    What do I feel? Pain? Fear? Anger?
    Nothing at all. I just want to see the face of Princess Tevona, to
 see her smile at me. To hear her whisper her love for me. Desires that
 can now never be fulfilled.


 Throne room
 An enormous hall surrounds you, floored completely with marble, with
 regional banners hanging down from the vaulted ceiling. Large,
 stained-glass windows are set high in the wall, allowing the weak
 daylight to cast faint beams of varicoloured light into the cavernous
 space. Additional light is provided by torches set in iron stands
 around the walls.
    To the north, the throne doors stand open.
    King Rithusar is seated on his throne at the far end of the hall.
 Two rows of chairs mark a narrow corridor leading to the dais, and
 seated in them are all seven lords of the kingdom. A table stands just
 before the throne at the end of the corridor of judgement, and the
 wizard Rixomas stands beside it.

    A guard is approaching, here to take you to your execution.


 [ Throne room | Part One as Torrin, son of Bradda, prisoner of the king
 ]
>beg for life
 You start into your plea, attempting to convince the court of your
 innocence, but you are cut short by Rixomas.
    "It's too late for that now," the wizard tells you.

>examine rixomas
 The wizard is old, but his body is still sprightly and he moves with
 ease and grace, although you notice that he is looking a little pale
 today. He is perhaps the most powerful wizard in Rylane, and has been
 your personal friend for years. Rithusar's father brought Rixomas into
 the court in a permanent position many years ago, and since becoming
 king you know Rithusar considers him his closest friend and ally.
    In his hands he is holding a wooden staff you have never seen him
 without.

>take staff
 The guard's threatening sword tells you not to try anything.

    "Wait!"
    The shout comes from the king, who is standing before the throne.
 All eyes turn to the throne, and all sounds cease.
    "As king, it's my duty to see the law carried out. However, it's
 also in my power to decide how a judgement will be carried out. Is this
 correct, Rixomas?"
    The wizard nods. "That is correct, your Majesty."
    "Now," the king continues, "it's plain that for this particular
 crime I can't commute it to life-imprisonment, because the laws of the
 kingdom demand that punishment be equivalent to the crime committed.
 Indeed, it's by applying the law that people can see that this kingdom
 is fair, and that her ruler is just."
    A frown forms on the face of the wizard. "But, your Majesty..."
    "A curse," the king proclaims. "You will pronounce a curse on him,
 something that will make him unacceptable for human contact, expelling
 him forever from our midst."
    Confusion follows. Voices are raised in dissent, others in tacit
 agreement, as if they like the idea, but are not sure they like it
 enough. Arguments break out between lords on either side, while the
 king, the wizard and you look on.
    "Peace, my lords," the king finally commands in a loud voice, and
 order slowly returns to the throne room. "I'm not looking for debate on
 this matter. We need only for the wizard to present us with those
 curses he is capable of performing, and for us to decide which is the
 most appropriate."
    There is reluctance from some members of the court, Lord Sulanar in
 particular. But once the wizard begins listing the different curses
 most of that reluctance turns to grudging praise as the possibilities
 for adding to your sentence become clear.
    For almost an hour the debate rages, eliminating possibilities
 until, finally, the choice comes down to one of three things. And to
 add to your torment, the final decision is given to you.
    "You must choose your fate," the wizard says. "The court has decided
 to curse you by transforming you into either a rat, a fox, or a snake.
 All of these creatures are hunted and killed without remorse. You will
 be shunned by men, and your life may very well be short. But you must
 choose now."

>SAVE

>fox
 "So be it," the wizard says. "May God have mercy on your soul."
    An expectant silence falls on the throne room as the wizard moves to
 stand directly in front of you and closes his eyes. He raises his staff
 above his head, with the top of the staff pointing in your direction.
    The silence of the throne room is shattered when he mutters
 something unintelligible and a bolt of blue lightning arcs between his
 staff and your body, crackling through the air. You scream in agony as
 wave after wave of electrical fire flows through you, your body
 flopping on the floor in convulsions. Pain reaches every nerve, every
 point on your body, and yet amid the pain you begin to feel your body
 shrink, change and mutate. You feel bones crunch, muscles stretch and
 contract, and a strange, evil odour fills your nostrils. Your tunic
 rips apart and falls to the floor as your body changes within it.
    And then, as suddenly as it starts, the pain vanishes, the lightning
 fades, and the echoes of your last scream as a human fade into silence,
 leaving you lying on the floor with all eyes staring at you.
    The wizard steps closer, and whispers so only you can hear. "I'm so
 sorry I wasn't able to help. Go to Master Limos in the Rylane

    In a louder voice he says, "You will have safety only while in this
 hall. Once you leave, your fate is in your own hands."
    The wizard points northwards towards the doors, to the way of
 torment.

 [ Throne room | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go north
 You scramble to your feet and trot out of the throne room, surprising
 yourself at how natural movement is. As you leave the guard closes the
 doors behind you. The noise as the doors shut seems so loud, as if they
 were slammed, and it makes you jump slightly.
 [ Press any key ]








 Antechamber
 This well appointed room seems significantly larger now than it used
 to. It is dominated by the towering, ornately carved doors which occupy
 almost the entire south wall, and by a thick carpet that covers the
 stone floor with intricate designs and patterns. In the two far corners
 opposite the throne room doors stand two massive suits of armour, one
 made from silver, and the other apparently from gold.
    Apart from the doors to the throne room, which are currently closed,
 there are cavernous exits to the east and west, although you can see
 that both hallways make a sharp turn to the south after a short
 distance, and a slightly smaller passage leads north.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- movement to the east.

    What just happened? Has the king, my foster father, just rescued me
 or condemned me? Somehow death might have been preferable to this life
 without life, death without death. All my thoughts for the last two
 months have focused on my potential execution. Now, it seems, I'm
 destined to have one last adventure, with or without God's help.
    But there is no time for reverie. If anything is to become of my
 life I need to stay alive, and that means escaping the castle, and
 hiding from anyone who might see me. I'll have to start thinking like a
 fox. Already my senses are giving me signals beyond what I've ever
 experienced before. Yet how will I be able to do anything without
 hands? The castle gates feel like they're miles away...

 Plain hallway
 The walls of this otherwise plain hallway are decorated with
 tapestries, and a number of small statues on pedestals stand at regular
 intervals down the length of the hallway. The hallway itself runs along
 the side of the castle, with a passage to the east at the northern end,
 and a small door, which is closed, blocking the exit to the south.

 Meeting hall
 A high ceiling and an enormous hearth give the meeting hall an imposing
 feel, but not to the level of the throne room. There are windows on the
 east wall, mostly draped with drawn curtains, but a few have been
 opened and grey clouds can be seen in the sky beyond.
    The floor is polished stone, covered in places by large, featureless
 rugs. There is a table stretching for a good length of the expansive
 room, around which are a number of chairs. In the south-western corner
 there is a tall cupboard, and next to it is the hearth where a fire is
 burning low.
    A wide door in the north wall leads out to the courtyard, although
 it is closed at the moment, while a passage southwards leads to the
 antechamber.
    A tall, basalt pedestal is positioned in the north-western corner of
 the room.

    On top of the pedestal is a large, ornamental vase.

>hide behind curtains
 You wriggle your body behind the curtains. Your feet are still visible,
 but given the curtain colour you should be well enough concealed until
 you are reayd to unhide yourself.


 Meeting hall (hiding behind the curtains)
 You are concealed behind one of the curtains in the meeting hall. There
 are windows right next to you that hold views of the grey sky, but
 there is not much else to see. The curtains effectively block your view
 of the room.

 [ Meeting hall (hiding behind the curtains) | Part One as Torrin, a
 small re ]
>examine curtains
 The curtains are made from a light, thin cloth, reddish in colour, and
 reach almost all the way to the floor. In fact, they are almost the
 same colour as your fur. They are outset from the windows, which leaves
 a small space between the curtains and the window.
    One of the curtains appears to be frayed at the top where it is
 attached to the rail. You doubt it would take much effort to pull it
 down.

>examine me
 You are a small, red fox with a long snout and bushy red tail.

 You look around briefly, but don't see anything here that fits that
 description.

>examine cupboard
 Made of acacia wood, the cupboard features intricate details on its
 doors. It is tall, too, about seven feet in total. The base is standing
 a couple of inches above the ground, courtesy of four small feet, and
 the height extended another couple of inches by small fascia running
 along the top edge which conceals the flat surface on top of the
 cupboard. At present, the cupboard is firmly shut.

 sound of cloth tearing high above you. With one more firm pull the
 entire curtain rips away from the rail and ends up in a pile at your
 feet.

 burning fire, where it smoulders for a moment before bursting into
 flame. Smoke billows into the hall.

 You can't reach the vase, although the pedestal is well within reach.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- voices on the other side
 of the door.

>push pedestal
 Placing your paws against the side of the pedestal you give it a push,
 and it rocks alarmingly back and forth. The vase tips one way, then
 another, and ends up balancing on the edge of the stand. Slowly,
 inexorably, it topples from the pedestal and smashes into a thousand
 pieces on the floor, and the room echoes with the sound of its demise.
 The pedestal itself follows a second later, slamming into the floor
 with considerable force and further crushing the remains of the vase.
    Where the base of the pedestal rested a small hole in the floor can
 now be seen.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- voices on the other side

 pedestal. After a few moments of straining she finally gives up with a
 huff and turns her attention to picking up pieces of the vase.

 Southern end of the courtyard
 You are currently hiding in the shadow cast by an overhanging balcony
 at the southern end of the castle courtyard. Battlements surround this
 area, tall walls topped with parapets, while in front of you to the
 north stretches a wide, open area paved with flagstones.
    To the east you can see the stables, while westwards is the castle
 smithy. To the south, up a small series of stone steps, lies the
 entrance to the meeting hall.
    There is a large stack of barrels just off to the left, along with
 some discarded and empty crates, and a single wooden plank.

    There is a horse-drawn cart standing nearby, the driver idly holding
 the reins of a large, grey draught horse.

 [ Southern end of the courtyard | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>SAVE
>cf6
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine barrels
 The barrels are made of wood wrapped in steel bands. They are stacked
 four high in places, and seem to be mostly filled with wine, although
 you can smell a number of other things, like barley and wheat too.
    The stack is arranged in a step-like manner, with the tallest
 sections at the southern-most end, and the smallest pointing towards
 the north.
    A barrel right at the top of the stack is poorly positioned, and
 threatens to fall at the least provocation.

    The servant rushes in from the west, and grabs another sack from the
 rear of the cart.
    "All right," the driver drawls. "I'd better get going now."
    The servant hurries off carrying the sack.
    With a flick of the reins, the cart driver urges his horse on, and
 the cart makes its way north.

>examine plank
 The plank is about 5 feet long and 3 inches wide. It is resting against
 one of the discarded crates in a way that reminds you of a see-saw your
 father made for you when you were small.

>push barrel
 You place your paws against the side of the closest one and push as
 hard as you can, but nothing seems to happen. It would take someone
 larger to have any impact on the stack of barrels, you decide.

>jump on plank
 There doesn't appear to be any compelling reason to expend energy in
 such a manner.
    You hear the sound of the portcullis being raised.

>examine cart
 You look around briefly, but don't see anything here that fits that
 description.

>examine crates
 The crates are made of wood, slats of pine hammered together rather
 shoddily. There are only about three or four of them. What they might
 have contained is a mystery, as they are all empty. A plank is leaning
 against one of the crates.

>examine portcullis
 You look around briefly, but don't see anything here that fits that
 description.
    You hear the sound of the portcullis being lowered.

>smell
 The stack of barrels is a smorgasbord of powerful smells, but none
 stand out on their own.

>go west
 You trot west.

 Smithy
 The smithy is normally an active place, but today the smithy doors are
 closed, and no sounds can be heard from within. A pile of discarded
 iron, leftovers from smithy work, lies next to the doors, along with a
 barrel filled with water. Nearby is another door which you know leads
 to the stores, but this door, too, is closed.
    To the east is the southern end of the courtyard, while northeast
 leads you into the wide, northern end.

 [ Smithy | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]

 Having been used by the blacksmiths to clean equipment, the water
 doesn't look clean enough to drink.

 Stables
 You are outside the stables, the doors to which are closed, except for
 the top half of one door which is tied back against the wall with a
 rope. A load of hay still to be stowed in a stall lies to one side, a
 pitchfork stuck in it forlornly. In front of the stable doors is a
 barrel, lying on its side.
    The southern end of the courtyard is towards the west, while to the
 northwest is the northern end, near the gatehouse.

    A horse is standing inside the stables but with its head sticking
 through the open stable door. It appears to be asleep.
    You hear the sound of the portcullis being raised.

 [ Stables | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>lick horse
 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in
 relation to the chestnut horse.

>eat horse
 You look at it, but decide in the end that it's not really edible.

>examine hay
 The mound is quite high, perhaps eight feet. A pitchfork in standing up
 in the pile, obviously left there by an absent stable hand.

>examine barrel
 The barrel is made of wood, with steel bands wrapped around it for
 strength. It is lying on its side, which you imagine is because a
 servant was moving it and has not returned to complete the job. You are
 unsure what the barrel contains, your fox senses not giving you any
 insight. It is currently sitting directly in front of the stable doors.

>climb on horse
 You give it a brief examination, but quickly reach the conclusion that
 it isn't climbable.

>enter barrel
 You have a closer look, but there doesn't appear to be any way to enter
 that.

 The horse is a chestnut, a fine looking animal with a small patch of
 white hair, like a star, on its forehead. It looks to be asleep.

>roll barrel
>stand on barrel
 You place your paws on the barrel, and using all the leverage your body
 can manage, you give it a push. It is so heavy that you wonder if you
 will be able to move it at all. But after a moment or two of straining,
 it finally starts to roll. And once started the barrel rolls easily,
 coming to rest against the castle wall.

 You think about it, but there doesn't appear to be any reason to stand
 on that.

>climb on barrel
 You give it a brief examination, but quickly reach the conclusion that

 strength. It is lying on its side, which you imagine is because a
 servant was moving it and has not returned to complete the job. You are
 unsure what the barrel contains, your fox senses not giving you any
 insight. It is currently resting against the castle wall.

>roll barrel
 Because the barrel is right up against the castle wall you can't get
 any leverage to push it again.

>pull barrel
 You consider trying to pull the barrel, but you can't imagine there
 being anything to gain by doing so.

>bark
 You bark fiercely.
    Surprisingly, the horse remains asleep. Some sort of physical
 intervention may be required to rouse the beast from slumber.

>bite horse
 Biting that seems such a random, pointless thing to do, and you dismiss
 the thought quickly.

>examine door
 Made from pine, the stable doors mark the entrance to the stables where
 the kings horses, and those of any visiting dignitaries, are housed.
 You know from experience that around one hundred horses can be bedded
 in the stalls inside. While the main doors are closed, the top half of
 one door is open, tied back against the wall with a rope that hangs
 down invitingly.

>examine rope
 The rope is thin, short and worn, and has frayed ends. It looks as if
 it was part of a longer piece some time in the past. It is attached to
 the handle on one of the stable doors, securing the door against the
 wall.

>eat rope
 You look at it, but decide in the end that it's not really edible.

>pull rope
 You leap up to grab the end of the rope with your teeth and the weight
 of your body unties the knot that is holding the door back. As it
 swings free you let go and drop back to the ground.
    As the door swings closed it gathers momentum and it strikes the
 sleeping horse with some force. Startled out of sleep, the horse is
 instantly agitated and begins to rear and neigh in a frightened manner.
    The horse lunges at the stable doors and they burst open, allowing
 the horse escape the stables and rush towards the northern end of the
 courtyard.
    Before you can even think to hide, a stable hand comes rushing out
 of the stables closing the doors behind him, and then bolts after the
 escaped horse. He doesn't even glance in your direction.

>look

 Stables
 You are outside the stables, the doors to which are closed, except for
 the top half of one door which was previously tied back against the
 wall but is currently swinging free. A load of hay still to be stowed
 in a stall lies to one side, a pitchfork stuck in it forlornly. A
 barrel, lying on its side, is resting against the wall.
    The southern end of the courtyard is towards the west, while to the
 northwest is the northern end, near the gatehouse.

    "Another load for ya," the driver says to the servant.
    "Thanks," he replies.

 it onto his shoulder, then disappears back to the west, heading for the

>examine cart
 It's a fairly uninteresting cart, a little old and ramshackle. The rear
 section of the cart is surrounded by barriers of wood which, combined
 with your small stature, make determining the contents impossible. It
 has four wheels, and a small seat at the front for the driver. There is
 a reasonable space under the cart which would be out of sight of the
 archers, if you could reach it.

 With the archers distracted by the agitated horse, you slip unnoticed
 beneath the cart where its shadow and bulk conceal you. However, should
 the cart move you know you will be exposed.

 With the cart standing above you and hiding you from the eyes of the
 archers on the battlements, you are safe for the moment. In front of

 this area would be bustling with activity, but today it seems a little

    As the cart moves away, you find yourself standing out in the open,
 and it takes less than a second for an archer to spot you.
    "Look!" a voice cries. "A fox!"
    Amid exclamations of surprise by other archers you hear the sound of
 an arrow being launched. You were already moving, even before the arrow
 left the string, but it still hits you, spearing through your body and
 throwing you to the ground. Another arrow hits you, but you can hardly
 feel it as your life slowly ebbs away.

    Tevona, I'm so sorry...

 You have died, having achieved a score of 3 out of a possible 101.
 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE, UNDO a turn, or QUIT?

 [ Southern end of the courtyard (hiding under the cart) | Part One as

>go north
 To move north now would mean exposing yourself to the archers on the
 walls. You decide to wait for the cart to move and follow underneath
 it.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- movement to the south.
    From the northern end of the courtyard comes the sound of a horse
 whinnying in distress.

>follow cart
 Knowing that timing is everything, you wait for the cart to move. If
 you can stay under it, you might be able to avoid being seen.
    The servant rushes in from the west, and grabs another sack from the
 rear of the cart.
    "That's the lot," the driver says. "See you after the execution."
    The servant hurries off carrying the sack.
    There is a sudden flick of the reins and with a jolt the cart
 lurches forward. You keep pace with it, forcing yourself to stay calm,
 willing the archers to keep their attention on the still-upset horse.
    A cat, sunning itself in the northern end of the courtyard, spots
 you as you pass. It leaps up, hissing wildly at you, and for a moment
 you think that all is lost. But the whinnying of the chestnut horse
 drowns out most of the sound, and the cat is ignored.
    Finally, the cart comes to a halt in the gatehouse.


 Gatehouse (hiding under the cart)
 The mass of the cart immediately above you adds to the dimness of the
 tunnel-like gatehouse. You can see daylight ahead to the north where
 the bars of the lowered portcullis allow light through. There are holes
 in the flagstones here, where the spikes on the end of the portcullis
 rest when it is down.
    From behind you, at the northern end of the courtyard, comes the
 sound of a horse whinnying in distress.

 the cart makes its way north through the raised portcullis.
    As the cart moves away, you find yourself standing out in the open.


 Gatehouse
 The light is dim here, owing to the tunnel-like nature of the
 gatehouse. Daylight streams through the northern end, unhindered by the
 raised portcullis. There are holes in the flagstones here, where the
 spikes on the end of the portcullis rest when it is down.

 [ Gatehouse | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go north
 With the portcullis up, you dash out of the gatehouse, looking for the
 safety of distance from the castle. Before you is the long slope of the
 stone ramp that leads down and away from the castle gates. At the base
 of the ramp, spread out before you like a map, lies the city of Ryla.
    You make a dash for the bottom, knowing that you will not be safe
 while you are still in range of the archers on the battlements.
    It's a long way, and you feel like you've only just started when
 from above and behind you hear a shout.
    "Hey, look! A fox!"
    One of the archers on the battlements has spotted you. Your red fur
 coat makes you stand out against the weather-worn grey stone of the
 ramp. And then you hear a sound that fills you with dread.
    Twang...zip! A arrow hits the ground less than an inch from your
 nose and ricochets away.
    You change direction, twisting and turning to throw off the archers
 aim, all the time racing to reach the bottom of the ramp and be out of
 the archers range. Desperately you dart left and right, this way and
 that, but ever downwards and away from the castle. More arrows strike
 the ground near you, and one grazes your side, drawing blood. But
 finally, you reach the bottom and quickly seek cover beneath some
 bushes on the side of the road. Your rapid breathing slows as you catch
 your breath.

 [ Your score just went up by five. ]

    I'm out of the castle in one piece, and so I still have a chance of
 discovering the true murderer of my best friend and getting this curse
 lifted. But it's quite a walk to the Rylane Mountains to see this
 Master Limos, whoever he is, and first I must escape the city.
 [ Press any key ]








 Western side of the road
 You are hiding in some bushes on the west side of the main road that
 leads through the city of Ryla. Behind you to the south is the stone
 ramp that leads up to the castle gates, the castle looming above you,
 elevated on its rocky crag. The main road heads north, but the amount
 of traffic on it precludes any thought of using it yourself. Westwards
 the way is barred by the rocky base of the castle, but an alley that
 might provide sufficient cover can be seen to the northwest. There is
 also a small drainage pipe here, about a foot in diameter, which runs
 eastwards underneath the road.
    A harsh, cold wind whistles by, making you shiver.

>go northwest
 You dash across the open space, looking for the concealment offered by
 the alley.


 Southern end of the alley
 Less of an alley and more of a area left over between buildings, it
 stretches some distance to the north. The gap between the rear of each
 building is barely six feet, and from what you can see of the
 buildings, this is not their best side. Construction is haphazard,
 materials are mismatched, and everything is smeared with dirt and
 grime. It is a depressing scene, especially when viewed under a leaden
 sky. To the southeast, beyond the alley, an open area can be seen
 beside the main road.

    As you pause to survey the area, a faint shimmer of light appears a
 few feet away, hovering in the air. You stare at it as it shifts and
 wavers, like a veil of silk in the wind. And as you watch it begins to
 expand, growing larger each moment, becoming more distinct and well
 formed.
    And finally, standing before you, is the ghostly image of a man.
    It is not a man you can ever remember meeting, but his face catches
 in your mind, signalling that it is somehow familiar. The man's
 features are strong, but while his body seems youthful, his eyes seem
 much older, as if he has looked on all the evil in the world and
 accepted it as his own. He is dressed in black robes, with a strange
 amulet of vivid blue set in gold around his neck.
    The wraith-like man looks around, taking in his surroundings, and
 his eyes fall on you. You see him blink, perhaps in unbelief, and for
 some seconds his gaze is unwavering, piercing.
    Suddenly, the phantom throws his head back and laughs. Or at least,
 he makes a laughing motion, for no sounds reach your ears. But you can
 tell he is not appreciating some clever pun or practical joke; the look
 in his eyes tells you he thinks of your misfortune as humorous.
 Somehow, this apparition knows what has happened to you, and finds the
 knowledge funny.
    Then, like a candle being snuffed, the ghost disappears, leaving you
 with the image of a man laughing at your fate burned in your mind.

>go north
 You trot north.

 Alley behind markets
 The alley widens here to some degree, although the quality of the
 building construction hasn't changed. A vine growing up the side of a
 nearby building provides you with cover in an otherwise exposed area.
 Off to the right is a small corral, inside which is a herd of sheep,
 bleating nervously. In the building next to the corral is a plain,
 white door that has some blood-like stains near at the base. The alley
 continues to the northwest, and narrows to the south.

 [ Alley behind markets | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>enter corral
 You have a closer look, but there doesn't appear to be any way to enter
 that.
    A cold, northerly wind rushes down the alley and makes you shiver
 momentarily.

>go northwest
 You trot northwest.

 Northern end of the alley
 The alley runs into a road here and comes to an end. The road itself is
 not busy, but a short distance away you see a shopkeeper standing in
 the doorway of his shop, looking around indifferently, and his presence
 keeps you from leaving the safety of the alley. The road runs
 east/west; it's hard to see where the westward direction goes, but to
 the east, past a line of shops and houses, you can see the city gates.

    Leaning up against the side of one of the buildings nearby is a
 rake.
    An old maple tree stands at the corner of the alley, looking a
 little sad and neglected, particularly with most of its foliage lost to
 autumn. Beneath it is an ragged, burlap sack, full to bursting with
 leaves.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- movement to the east.
    The shopkeeper turns his head and faces the alley.

 [ Northern end of the alley | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]

 Alley behind markets
 The alley widens here to some degree, although the quality of the
 building construction hasn't changed. A vine growing up the side of a
 nearby building provides you with cover in an otherwise exposed area.
 Off to the right is a small corral, inside which is a herd of sheep,
 bleating nervously. In the building next to the corral is a plain,
 white door that has some blood-like stains near at the base. The alley
 continues to the northwest, and narrows to the south.

 The corral is a box shape, with cross-beams on the sides to keep the
 occupants from escaping. The sides are only about four feet high. A
 small gate is built into one side to provide access. Inside the corral
 is a small herd of sheep.
    A cold, northerly wind rushes down the alley and makes you shiver
 momentarily.

>open gate
 You rush forward and push against the small gate of the corral with
 your paws, but it refuses to move. There appears to be some form of
 latch keeping it from opening. You dart back to your position under the
 vines.

 You dart out of cover and race to the gate. Putting your front legs on
 top of the gate, you use your nose to lift the latch, before quickly
 returning to your position under the vines.

 You rush forward and push the small gate of the corral with your paws,
 and it swings open gently. The sheep back away into the far corner of
 the corral and start bleating in a far more urgent manner as the gate
 comes to a stop. You dart back to your position under the vines.
    You have only just reached the vines when the white door suddenly
 swings open and a large, bearded man strides out. He is dressed in work
 clothes, and is wearing a apron covered in blood. He quickly looks
 around and spots the open gate.
    "How did that get open?" he asks of no one, and shuts the gate again
 just before the sheep find it themselves.
    The man looks around again, this time a little more intently. You
 freeze, and eventually the man gives a simple grunt, then disappears
 back through the door.
    A cold, northerly wind rushes down the alley and makes you shiver
 momentarily.

>examine building
 This is definitely not the buildings best side. Aside from the general
 dirt and grime, the walls themselves are in need of maintenance.

    "What the..." he exclaims, quickly shutting the gate before the
 sheep can escape. "That can't be opening on its own."
    There is a determined look in the man's face as she looks around the
 alley. You freeze as before, but his gaze comes to rest on you.
    "A stinking fox!" he cries and throws his knife at you before you
 can even move.
    He is a very good shot. The knife buries itself into your neck.

 street is the large, imposing edifice of the church, which towers above
 you, dwarfing you into insignificance. There is a strong smell here,
 too, which you assume is coming from within the church itself.
    In front of the church some scaffolding has been set up, on top of
 which is a workman who appears to be repairing some stonework.
    A harsh, cold wind whistles by, making you shiver.
    Somewhere in the distance you hear the sound of voices raised in
 excitement, mingled with a few bleats from excited sheep.

 The workman is standing on the scaffolding, a good thirty feet above
 the ground, fixing the aging stonework on the church with plaster. He
 doesn't appear to be interested in you at all.

>examine scaffolding
 The scaffolding is set up in front of the church at the western end of
 the road. Made from bamboo poles and hardwood planks, it is quite tall,
 reaching a height of almost thirty feet. The structure looks quite
 rickety.

 While the scaffolding might be rickety, it is far too big to be
 influenced by anything you could do.

 You have a closer look, but there doesn't appear to be any way to enter
 that.

 You can't go in that direction, but you can move east.

 Northern end of the alley
 The alley runs into a road here and comes to an end. The road itself is
 empty, opening the way up for you to leave the safety of the alley. The
 road runs east/west; it's hard to see where the westward direction
 goes, but to the east, past a line of shops and houses, you can see the
 city gates.

    The ground here is carpeted with autumn-coloured leaves.
    An old maple tree stands at the corner of the alley, looking a
 little sad and neglected, particularly with most of its foliage lost to
 autumn. Beneath it is the remains of an old, burlap sack, lying on the
 ground in tatters.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- movement to the east.

 [ Northern end of the alley | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go east
 All your senses are telling you it would be dangerous to go there at
 the moment.
    A cold, northerly wind rushes down the alley and makes you shiver
 momentarily.
    The gust of wind catches the leaves lying on the ground and sends
 flurries of them whirling along the alley.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- movement to the east.

>examine tree
 The maple tree is not as tall as other maples you've seen, which is
 probably explained by its location in the city. The surrounding
 buildings have stunted its growth. With the onset of autumn most of its
 leaves have fallen, leaving the branches denuded and stark.

 excitement, mingled with a few bleats from excited sheep.

 Alley behind markets
 The alley widens here to some degree, although the quality of the
 building construction hasn't changed. A vine growing up the side of a
 nearby building provides you with cover in an otherwise exposed area.
 Off to the right is a small corral, which is completely empty. In the
 building next to the corral is a plain, white door that has some
 blood-like stains near at the base. The alley continues to the
 northwest, and narrows to the south.

    Lying on the ground nearby is a rake.
    The ground here is covered with autumn coloured leaves.
    A cold, northerly wind rushes down the alley and makes you shiver
 momentarily.
    The gust of wind brings with it a flurry of leaves that spread
 themselves around the area.

 The church is an huge structure. Its angular roof, towering spire and
 the dark stones used in construction make you feel even smaller than
 you already do as they rise above you. The building is old, though, and
 time has ravaged the walls to some degree.

 The ground is certainly soft enough to allow you to dig, but you're not
 sure what could be gained by digging random holes. You decide to think
 about this further before expending unnecessary energy.

 Wasting no time, you sprint across to the base of the scaffolding. The
 workman above shows no signs of having seen you as you get to work.
 Your paws easily dig through the compacted dirt of the road as you
 undermine one of the bamboo poles holding up the structure. The hole is
 a foot deep by the time you finish, and you move away a good distance
 to await the results.
    Somewhere in the distance you hear the sound of voices raised in
 excitement, mingled with a few bleats from excited sheep.
    You notice the scaffolding wobble slightly. The workman above looks
 around, but on seeing nothing, returns to his task.

    The scaffolding shakes alarmingly, and the workman, as if sensing
 imminent danger, begins his descent.

 You wag your tail a few times.

 of a window ledge and is left hanging by his arms, shouting for help.
 Then, with a resounding crash, the scaffolding smashes into the ground,
 spreading planks and bamboo around the area.

 You consider trying to push the scaffolding, but you can't imagine
 there being anything to gain by doing so.
    Somewhere in the distance you hear the sound of voices raised in

    "Help!" the workman cries, as he dangles from the window ledge.
 "Help!"

 you, dwarfing you into insignificance. There is a strong smell here,
 too, which you assume is coming from within the temple itself.
    In front of the church are some bamboo poles and a number of wooden
 planks, the remains of some scaffolding that was knocked down recently.
 A hole has been dug into the road near the church.
    Your eyes, however, are drawn to the plight of a workman who is
 clinging to a small window ledge on the front of the church and
 bellowing for someone to help him.

    Lying on the ground nearby is a rake.
    A harsh, cold wind whistles by, making you shiver.
    "Help!" the workman cries, as he dangles from the window ledge.
 "Help!"

>go north
 You can't go in that direction, but you can move east.
    Guards from the city gates rush to assist the man hanging from the
 window ledge. They don't even glance in your direction.
    "Hold on," they call out, "We'll get you down in a moment."
    One of the guards has brought a ladder, but when they set it up
 discover it is short by a good six or seven feet.
    "Come on," the workman cries. "I can't hold on much longer."
    "You'll have to let go!" the guard at the top of the ladder says.
    "What!" the workman yells.
    "We can catch you," the guard assures him.
    In the end the choice was taken away from them. The workman's hands
 give way and he plummets into the guards on the ladder. The ladder
 breaks in two, and all of them end up in a heap on the ground.
    As they each rise, brush themselves off, and realise that no one is
 hurt their fear gives way to happiness, and there is much backslapping
 and joking as the guards congratulate themselves on a fine, but
 unorthodox, rescue. The workman soon turns his attention back to his
 job, and begins the task of sorting out the shattered remains of his
 scaffold.

>go east

 City gates
 Noise and movement surround you. The main road through the city exits
 here at the city gates, and it is filled with traffic entering or
 leaving the city. Horse-drawn carts and wagons rumble by, oxen bellow
 on their way to market, people yell and shout at each other; your
 senses are overwhelmed.
    The city gates themselves are wide open, allowing free access in and
 out. Through them you can see open farmland, trees and hills: freedom.
 To the south you can see the town square where a crowd of people has
 gathered. Between you and the crowd you can see a number of sheep
 running around, pursued by a few people who are not having much success
 in capturing them.

 [ City gates | Part One as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go north
 You streak towards the gates and the comparative safety beckoning
 beyond. Dodging around horses and people, each heartbeat brings you
 closer. Voices are raised: you have been seen. People are shouting and
 exclaiming, cries of "Look! A fox!" or "Quick! Kill it!"
    Closer now. Ahead is a line of men armed with clubs, beside a cart
 they have just leapt from. A feint to the left, then a dive under the
 cart to the right avoids the danger and the gates are right before you.
    Your animal sense makes you veer sharply right, and a spear thrown
 by someone behind you plants itself into the ground where your body was
 just moments before. You leap over it and make the final dash through
 the gates and out of city.
    You waste no time in putting as much distance between you and the
 city as possible.

 [ Your score just went up by ten. ]

    And so I leave my former home behind. Although I'm determined not to
 lose hope, it's difficult not to descend into morbid speculation. I
 don't know what the future holds, and whether I'll ever be able to
 return here. I don't know if I can find this Master Limos in the Rylane
 Mountains. I don't even know if I'll live to see the end of this day.
    I long for human contact. I've been a fox for less than a day and
 already I miss it. I long, in particular, for Tevona, to simply hold
 her hand. It is an ache in my heart that won't go away.
    Now I'm faced with a daunting journey. The Rylane Mountains are a
 good three days ride away; how long it'll take on foot as a fox I can't
 imagine. All I know is that the road is likely to be hard. The ghostly
 image of the black-robed man still haunts my mind, but with effort I
 put it aside, and focus on the task at hand and the journey ahead of
 me.

 Interlude: Conversations with the King

    From the moment I raised my staff and placed the curse on Torrin I
 knew that the king would want to speak with me, although I expected it
 would happen much earlier. Night has fallen now. I came at once when
 the servant informed me of the King's request, but Rithusar has hardly
 moved in the ten minutes it's been since the King's chamberlain arrived
 with my wine and then quietly departed, closing the door behind him.
 Even before then Rithusar was not entirely himself. There is something
 in his eyes I have never seen before. If I had to think of a word to
 describe how he looks, it would be "haunted".
    Outside, a bitter north wind is bringing occasional sheets of rain,
 but mostly is just making life cold and hard, and only the most
 foolhardy or desperate would spend any time out in the frigid night
 air.
    Here in the Royal apartments, the room is quiet and still, save for
 the crackling of the fire in the hearth before me. The flames dance
 over the wood, like players in some ancient ritual, jumping and
 twisting in delight. But although I'm seated quite close to it I still
 feel a chill, and I try wrapping my cloak around my shoulders a little
 tighter.
    I know he wants to talk. It doesn't take a wizard's knowledge and
 perception to reach that conclusion. It also doesn't take a lot of
 insight to know what the king will want to talk about.



 Royal apartments
 The wide hearth with a welcoming fire burning brightly within it gives
 this room a warm, comforting feel. Before the fire are two chairs, in
 one of which you are seated. Around the room are a number of candles,
 which add further light to the room. Next to your chair is a small
 table, while a small, silver stand is positioned next to the king's
 chair. The room is spacious and open, with the only exit being a door
 in the west wall.

    Your wooden staff is leaning against your chair within easy reach.

    The king is seated in his chair, staring into the fire.

 You suspect the king might want to talk about some of the following
 things:
    Torrin
    Princess Tevona

>torrin
 "Have you heard anything?" you ask simply.
    The king is slow in responding. "He escaped the city, according to
 the information I have at the moment. Or at least, no one has reported
 killing a fox, or seeing a dead one in an unusual place. There are
 unconfirmed reports of a fox running through the main gates, but
 nothing definite. I have to assume he made it out alive."
    "He's smart," you say. "He always has been."
    The king nods. "Much like his father, Bradda, was." He is silent for
 a moment before continuing.
    "What did you say to Torrin in the throne room," he asks.
    You sigh. "I told him to see another wizard," you say with a touch
 of reluctance.
    The king raises his eyebrows. "Indeed. Why did you do that?"
    "I don't really know," you reply. "Your change of direction in
 having Torrin cursed threw me off balance. Now he was going to remain
 alive. I was constrained by the law to execute the judgement, but I
 thought the wizard I sent him to might be able to assist him to some
 degree."
    The king leans forward. "Would they be able to lift the curse?"
    "No, only I can do that. But they might be able to help him in other
 ways."
    "How?"
    "Honestly, I don't know. But I thought that any help would be
 beneficial."
    The king sits back and is thoughtful for a moment.
    "Who did you send him to?"
    "Master Limos," you say.
    The king raises his eyebrows.
    "I hope you know what you're doing," is all he says.
    "So do I," you reply.
    The king turns back to the fire and stares intently into it.

>princess
 "Tevona must feel fairly upset by what's happened," you say.
    "She seems...strange," the king replies, confusion in his eyes.
 "She's been mourning since Alsanter died, but I think she's been
 avoiding me."
    You raise your eyebrows in surprise. "What makes you say that?"
    "I see it in her eyes whenever she sees me," the king says. "It's
 like she's withdrawing from me, from her family."
    "You're probably overreacting. She needs time. She's been spending
 some time in Alallsia, hasn't she?"
    "Yes, which she's been doing for a number of years now, but I don't
 know." The king falls silent once more.

>topics
 You suspect Rithusar might want to talk about some of the following
 things:
    Bradda, Torrin's father
    Curse
    Master Limos
    Fatherhood
    Prince Alsanter
    Rithusar glances quickly at your glass of wine.
    "Don't forget your wine, Rixomas," he says with a small smile. He
 then turns his attention back to the fire.

    A silence had fallen, but the king breaks it by asking in a whisper,
 "What have I done?"
    You assume he is referring to how he orchestrated Torrin's escape
 from execution, but he is not looking directly at you, which leaves you
 a little uncertain as to whether he is asking you a question at all.
 "Rixomas, what have I done?" he asks again.
    "Sire..." you begin, but are cut off by the king.
    "Please, I don't want formality here," he says. He takes off his
 crown and places it on the stand nearby. "There. At least for a little
 while, I don't have to be king. I can be Rithusar, you can be Rixomas,
 and it can be like it used to be, when we were just good friends."
    You smile in response. "I'd like that, Rithusar."
    Rithusar repeats his earlier question, this time with no doubt he
 wants an answer. "Did I do the right thing, Rixomas?" he persists.
 [ You can respond by saying either Yes, No, or I don't know. ]

>yes
 "Rithusar, you achieved something I didn't believe possible," you
 reply. "Torrin was found guilty of murder. Every court in the world
 would have sentenced him to death. But you saved his life. Torrin is
 still alive because of you."
    Rithusar shakes his head. "What life, Rixomas? I have still
 condemned him. What life have I bestowed on him? What hope does he have
 for the future?"
    "Some life is better than no life," you answer philosophically. "As
 long as there is life, there is hope."

>curse
 "Why a curse?" you ask. "Of all things, why that?"
    "I didn't want it," Rithusar explains. "I didn't want anything to
 happen. My preference was for Torrin to remain in prison."
    "That would never have worked," you reply.
    "I know, but a curse seemed like the only way to keep him alive and
 yet satisfy the demands of justice."
    You give Rithusar a smile. "I think you surprised everyone with it.
 When did you come up with the idea?"
    Rithusar is a little slow to respond. "About three weeks ago."
    "Now I'm really surprised," you say. "Why didn't you tell me?"
    "I would've thought the answer to that was obvious. There have
 always been stirrings of dissent with the throne of Rylane having a
 court wizard. Sulanar in particular. If I'd told you my plan beforehand
 and it was discovered, it would've undermined your objectivity in their
 eyes, and you would have been excluded from the council on the matter.
 That would have left execution as the only option."
    "Maybe," is all you allow.

>sulanar
 "Lord Sulanar didn't seem particularly happy with the result today,"
 you say. "I'm surprised he actually went along with it."
    "He and I have never really worked well together," Rithusar says.
    "That's hardly news," you return in a light-hearted way. "Your
 houses have been bickering for centuries. He's not that fond of me,
 either. In fact, I suspect Torrin picked up on your dislike for Sulanar
 in his repeated accusations against him."
    "That could be, but Sulanar's alibi was checked out. I'm a little
 concerned by Sulanar's news about this mysterious wizard, though."
    You nod. "That is concerning. I haven't heard his full report."
    "Well, neither have I," Rithusar replies ruefully. "Sulanar is
 notorious for the brevity of his reports. He initially told me about
 this a couple of months ago but he hasn't reported anything else until
 today. Sulanar just said that when he returns to Alallsia tomorrow he
 will be following up on reports that he has received. Have you sensed
 anything unusual lately."
    "No," you say. "If there is a wizard somewhere in the kingdom
 causing problems, I haven't felt anything. But that's not unusual
 really. I'd need to be fairly close to any magical activity to sense
 it. Did Sulanar say what he was going to do?"
    Rithusar shakes his head. "Just that he will be following it up." He
 turns his attention back to the fire.
    You feel a draft from under the door and it makes you shiver. You
 pull your cloak around yourself even tighter.

>fatherhood
 You sense something underlying Rithusar's comments about his children.
 "Do you feel you've let your children down?" you ask.
    "I haven't been a good father," Rithusar replies. Seeing your aghast
 expression, he goes on. "I've spent so much time being king, so much
 time dealing with issues in the kingdom, I feel I've neglected Alsanter
 and Tevona."
    "You're the king," you reply. "Your duty is to the kingdom. You've
 done nothing to be ashamed of."
    "I'm a father, too," Rithusar says. His voice is sad. "That duty I
 seem to have overlooked time and time again."
    "I think you're being too hard on yourself."
    "Maybe," Rithusar allows and returns to his contemplation of the
 fire.

    You are almost cut in half by a sudden coughing fit that lasts a
 couple of minutes and leaves you feeling light-headed and weak.
 Rithusar looks at you with some concern.
    "Are you alright, Rixomas?" he asks.
    You nod in reply. "I'm fine," you say.
    The king looks at you with questions about the veracity of your
 answer clearly on his mind, but he doesn't pursue it.

>wine
 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in
 relation to the wine glass.
    "Please enjoy your wine," Rithusar reminds you. "Don't let it go to
 waste." He then returns his gaze to the fire.

>smell wine
 The wine glass smells normal.

>SAVE
>cf13
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>drink wine
 You take a small sip of wine, and feel the spices in the liquid warm
 you from the inside.
    The wind rattles against the windows, making both you and the king
 jump slightly.

>alsanter
 "Do you want to talk about Alsanter?" you ask.
    There is a long pause, and you wonder if the king is going to
 respond at all. "I miss him," Rithusar says finally. "Part of me still
 can't believe he's gone."
    "Is that why you've ordered his rooms to be left untouched?"
    "Yes," Rithusar answers simply. "Somehow it seems wrong to remove
 all of his things."
    "You have to let go, Rithusar," you say. "You can't hold onto
 Alsanter forever."
    Rithusar nods. "You're right. But not yet." He turns his gaze back
 towards the depths of the fire. "Not yet."

    You are lost in contemplation of the fire when Rithusar breaks into
 your thoughts.
    "Why did the court find Torrin guilty?" he asks. His tone indicates
 that the question might be rhetorical, but you answer anyway.
    "The evidence was compelling," you say.
    "No, it wasn't," he replies shortly.
    You hesitate to disagree and point out his lack of objectivity, but
 decide that wouldn't be helpful. Instead, you simply ask, "Why?"
    Rithusar looks at you.
    "Because all the evidence didn't take into consideration Torrin's
 character," he replies. He leans forward, earnest in his response.
 "Nothing in Torrin's character suggested he would ever do something
 like that. Yes, looking purely at the evidence, the logical conclusion
 is that Torrin must have been responsible. But there is more to this
 than just evidence. More than just a series of facts."
    Your initial reaction to this is to simply concede the point to him;
 he is the king, after all. But you notice again the crown sitting on
 the silver stand and realise that he doesn't want that sort of
 response.
    "We don't know what's in a man's heart," you reply. "The most noble
 of men can be brought low by temptation, given the right opportunities.
 The evidence points towards a possibility that is extremely hard to
 disprove."
    Rithusar looks thoughtful for a moment, then turns towards you and
 looks you in the eye.
    "Do you believe Torrin is guilty?" he asks.
    You have to admit this was not a question you expected from
 Rithusar. But he is waiting for your answer.
 [ You can respond by saying either Yes, No, or I don't know. ]

>no
 "Well, it seems a little moot at this point to answer that, but, no, I
 don't believe he was guilty."
    Rithusar looks relieved. "I was beginning to think I was the only
 one."
    "However," you add, "whether we consider Torrin innocent or not, he
 was convicted and sentenced. How we feel about the decision won't
 change what happened."
    "Actually, it matters a great deal to me," Rithusar says, with a
 smile.

>cough
 A strange thought comes to your mind, but you quickly dismiss it. It
 really made no sense.

>topics
 You suspect Rithusar might want to talk about some of the following
 things:
    Bradda, Torrin's father
    Master Limos
    Sulanar's Alibi

>alibi
 "So what was Lord Sulanar's alibi?" you ask.
    Rithusar gives you a weak smile. "He was with me!" he replies.
    "And he'd been with you all day, hadn't he?" you put in.
    Rithusar pauses for a moment and looks at you intently. "Actually,
 he'd only just arrived when Torrin raised the alarm."
    "You'd sent for him, correct?"
    "Yes, I wanted him to tell me what Tevona had been doing on her
 frequent visits to Alallsia. I'd heard reports that he was taking far
 more interest in her movements than I thought was appropriate. He
 arrived rather breathless."
    "Breathless?" you reply. This wasn't information that was in the

    "Sulanar explained that when the messenger had delivered the request
 he'd rushed see me as fast as he could because he wanted to avoid any
 misunderstandings."
    "That's certainly unusual," you allow.
    Rithusar nods. "In a way. But it was then that he first mentioned
 his information about another wizard possibly operating in his
 province, which does explain his eagerness to fill me in."
    "Do you know where he was when the messenger found him?"
    "No," Rithusar replies. "It didn't seem important at the time. I
 assumed he was in his apartments."
    Rithusar shifts in his chair and turns his gaze back to the fire.
    Rithusar points to your wine glass. "I don't want to distract you
 too much with talk," he says. "Drink your wine and enjoy it." His
 attention then returns to the fire.

>limos
 "I can see you're worried about where I sent Torrin," you say.
    "Do you really think it was a good idea sending him to Master
 Limos?" Rithusar asks. "Surely there was someone else. Master Limos is
 pretty reclusive. He may not want to help at all."
    "I'm aware of the difficulties," you reply. "But there was no one
 else I could think of who might have been capable of helping in
 Torrin's unique situation."
    Rithusar still looks uncertain, but he nods and turns back to the
 fire.

>bradda
 "I hardly knew Bradda at all," you say. "He was always Reken's first
 choice for dangerous missions, though."
    "I did a lot of training with him, actually, before the war with
 Gord. He was so quick, always anticipating the outcome of events,
 almost like he knew what was going to happen before it did."
    "I suppose that's how he managed to save you," you say.
    Rithusar nods. "You weren't at the battle of Lounor, were you?"
    "I was close to tracking down the wizard of Gord at that point,
 trying to stop the creation of more of those Ralyon warriors."
    "It was a dreadful battle. It was supposed to be a small outpost,
 one quick fight and then move on. I think King Horalas knew that, and
 set up a surprise. After the battle started, two squads of Ralyons
 materialised out of the forest behind us and attacked. We were fighting
 the battle on three fronts. I called for reinforcements to strengthen
 the rear, but a sudden surge from the front left me cut off from the
 rest of our forces."
    "And Bradda saw this happen?"
    "He'd seen it about to happen for a couple of minutes," Rithusar
 replies. "He'd been working his way towards me the whole time, bashing
 people out of the way. A few men joined him, Lord Reken was one of them
 I think. They cut through the soldiers around me and restored the
 line."
    "Was that when he died?"
    "Yes," Rithusar says simply. "As we were organising our retreat, the
 outpost let fly with a few volleys of arrows. I had lost my shield in
 the melee and Bradda had given me his. He raised his arms for
 protection, but an arrow struck him in the neck."
    "It's strange," you say. "In all the time since the war I haven't
 heard all the details about what Bradda did. I only knew he'd saved you
 in battle."
    One of the logs in the fire settles into the ash softly.

>logs
 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in
 relation to the fire.

>examine logs
 The fire is burning well, pushing out a good amount of heat as the logs
 within are slowly but inexorably consumed by the flames. Embers fly up
 the chimney out of sight.

>go up
 Rithusar invited you here to talk with him, so it would be impolite to
 try to leave without giving him the opportunity.
    The fire pops loudly, sending a few embers and ash whirling around
 the hearth.

>topics
 You suspect Rithusar might want to talk about some of the following
 things:
    War with Gord
    Horalas, King of Gord
    Wizard of Gord
    Ralyon warriors
    Lord Reken

>kiss king
 A strange thought comes to your mind, but you quickly dismiss it. It
 really made no sense.

>wizard
 "Did you ever learn the name of the wizard who Horalas used to create
 the Ralyon warriors?" you ask. Rithusar shakes his head. "No, I didn't
 either."
   "That's a surprise," Rithusar says. "You had more to do with him than
 anyone."
    "My one meeting with him, if you can call it that, devolved into
 violence before a word had been spoken, and it was over in moments."
    "You managed to strike him, though. I seem to recall you mentioning
 that."
    "Oh, yes, I hit him. Once. But he vanished before I could determine
 if the wound was mortal or not. I did manage to destroy his workshop
 where he was creating more Ralyon warriors."
    Rithusar nods. "And gave us the edge in the war. Did I ever thank
 you for your contributions."
    You smile. "Numerous times, Rithusar. I was very glad to have played
 some part in ending the war."

>reken
 "I didn't get a chance to speak with Lord Reken after the trial," you
 say.
    "He seemed quite upset by the outcome today," Rithusar replies
 thoughtfully.
    "You can't really blame him," you say. "Torrin's father was one of
 his knights. He was the one who told you about the orphaned son after
 the battle where Bradda died. So he has a stake in what happens to
 Torrin. But I was surprised when he said Torrin was guilty."
    "When Reken put forward the idea of making Torrin my ward, he knew
 how dedicated Torrin was, and how much he wanted to excel. But Reken
 knew more about Bradda than Torrin, and much of his decision in
 suggesting to make Torrin my ward would have been driven by that. What
 I've seen since then is Torrin's desire to please, to do what is right,
 and his commitment to his new family. I don't think Reken has the same
 level of involvement that I do, Rixomas."
    You nod. "Probably not," you say, and you both fall silent for a
 moment.

>war
 "The war with Gord seems like an lifetime ago now," you put in.
    "I hated that war," Rithusar replies.
    "Everyone did," you respond. "It was a long war, and a lot of good
 people died."
    "Too many." Rithusar is silent for a moment. "Part of me wishes we'd
 never gone into it."
    "Your father had been assassinated by Gord," you say. "Assassins had
 even tried to kill you. War was demanded. The whole kingdom demanded
 it."
    "Oh yes, it was all noble and right, but looking back now, I think
 we should have explored some other options before charging head first
 into war."
    "I doubt anything else would have worked. Gord wanted a war. They
 were attempting to destabilise our kingdom and hoping to win the
 resulting war before we could regroup."
    "And were it not for Torrin's father, they would have won."
    "It's over," you remind Rithusar. "The war ended ten years ago.
 There's no need for this morbid reflection."
    Rithusar looks at you sharply. "You're right, Rixomas. Dwelling on
 the past is not going to do any good right now." He turns and looks
 into the fire deeply.

    A silence descends on the room. The logs in the fire continue to
 burn, the flames biting into the wood greedily.
    Rithusar breaks the silence. "Can you see into the future, Rixomas?"
 he asks. This was not a question you expected Rithusar to ask.
    "Not very well," you reply. "I've never been skilled at the art of
 foresight, and my attempts have been about as accurate as anyone's
 guess."
    Rithusar sighs. "I keep trying to analyse my actions, to plot the
 path from where I am now to where I want to be. Did I do the right
 thing? What will happen to Torrin? I wish I could see what the end
 result will be."
    "I wish I could give you what you want," you reply. "I wish I could
 raise my staff and recite some ancient incantation and restore your
 sons to their proper place. But we can't let this tragedy divert us
 from our responsibility. You are the king of Rylane. You have a
 responsibility to the people to lead them and protect them. Mourn and
 grieve for your sons, but don't fall into depression. Don't let these
 things weigh you down to where your ability as a king is compromised."
    Rithusar looks at you intently as he nods in agreement. His features
 are still gaunt, but the haunted look around his eyes has lessened
 somewhat, and his eyes are brighter.
    "You're ever a true friend, Rixomas," he replies. "Thank you for
 your insights, and for taking the time to listen to my ramblings."
    "It was an honour," you reply.
    Rithusar stands and rings the bell. The chamberlain opens the door
 swiftly. You also stand, but a little unsteadily.
    "Are you all right?" the king asks, genuine concern in his voice.
    You give a little chuckle. "I think I'm just feeling old," you
 reply.
    Rithusar doesn't look convinced. "I'll have my physician come and
 see you," he says.
    "Your daughter has already been providing me with a tonic, but I
 appreciate your concern."
    As you leave the kings chambers and head for your own you feel a
 touch of satisfaction of having achieved something significant.

 Part Two: Lost in Transformation

    I miss Tevona. I miss her smile, her gentle touch. I miss being able
 to confide in her, to shine the light of her love on the dark corners
 of my heart. How often she helped me look up and see my own self worth.
 When I remember how much Tevona helped me I'm reminded of how she dealt
 with all of life's struggles so effortlessly. She inspired me to keep
 going. I learnt so much from her, and I miss her terribly.
    Whether by the providence of God or my own good fortune I have had
 safety for the five days I've been running. Aside from an occasional,
 restless nap, drinking from whatever water source I stumbled across,
 and staying as far away from human and non-human contact as I could,
 nothing else has distracted me from my goal. In that time I've wondered
 long and deeply about just how Master Limos can help me. What can he
 do? Can he undo the curse? Will he help me to find Alsanter's murderer?
 I know so little about this wizard I don't know if I'll even be
 welcome.
    The ground has been rising steadily for the last day as I made my
 way north, and this morning I entered the foothills of the Rylane
 Mountains, marked by a broad stretch of forest that adorns valley after
 valley. I passed a small outpost earlier, which I gave a wide berth,
 particularly when I heard a hunting horn being blown. The valley I have
 entered leads to the only village I know of in the mountains, Tallum,
 where I hope to gain information that will lead me to this wizard. The
 wind is bitter and cold, and I expect to find snow the higher up the
 mountains I go, but at the moment the ground is thankfully clear.
    But right here and now, things have changed. In my mind I feel like
 I've been pushing against something intangible for each moment of the
 five days of my journey, like some spiritual shroud that threatens to
 envelop me. But now something feels wrong, out of place. My thoughts
 run like wild horses, uncontrollable...

 A wind is blowing through the forest making eerie howling sounds in the
 trees. The branches of the trees are creaking as the wind pushes them,
 and you can hear leaves falling to the ground.

    The veil is lifted - my mind has returned to me. Although just what
 brought about this overload of senses I hesitate to guess.



 Forest clearing
 The track you have been following through the forest widens here into a
 small clearing. You can see that some of the space has been created
 unnaturally - there are a number of stumps nearby that indicate the
 influence of man. A bitter northerly wind brings with it the smells of
 the forest, scents of trees and even other animals. Small shrubs have
 grown prolifically here, forming large stretches of thick foliage,
 while the rest of the open space is covered with grass that waves in
 the wind. Dotted here and there are small bunches of late blooming
 alpine flowers that are giving off a strong fragrance. Despite the
 undergrowth, you have freedom of movement in every direction, although
 the track itself leads north.

>examine flowers
 The flowers appear to be a late blooming variety, although you're not
 sure of the type. The petals are white and delicate, and the centre is
 a bright yellow spot. The fragrance the flowers are emitting is
 delightful, a fresh and pure smell that lifts the spirit.
    To your ears come the sounds of dogs barking, not too far away to
 the south. And with it is the sound of a horn.
    You notice your scent has been left behind you.

>roll in flowers
 A stray thought enters your mind, but you dismiss it quickly. It just
 didn't make sense.

>go west
 You trot west.

 West of clearing
 Tall trees surround you on all sides, but not so densely as to prevent
 movement in any direction. You can see for some distance all around
 you, although the only thing you note is that the light is brighter to
 the east where the forest clearing is. The base of most trees are
 surrounded by the same shrubs you noticed earlier, although here in the
 dimness of the trees it is not quite as prolific. The forest floor here
 is carpeted with moss which feels cool to your feet. A frigid northerly
 wind is blowing, and it carries with it the scents of the forest, an
 array of smells in which you can make out various plants and trees and
 even animals.
    Somewhere to the south, over the sound of the wind in the trees, you
 can hear dogs barking excitedly not far away.

 Forest near cliff wall
 The towering western wall of the valley confronts you here, rising up
 out of sight, while the forest ends right at the base. A few small
 plants have found purchase in the cliff face, but you can see no way to
 scale the cliff yourself. A bitter northerly wind continues to assault
 the trees, bending the upper branches and howling in discordant waves
 of sound. There is little undergrowth here, mostly made up of moss and
 the small shrubs that appear to be endemic to the region. Apart from
 the limitations imposed by the valley wall to the west, you can move in
 any direction.

>go north

 Forest near cliff wall
 Trees still surround you, but they come to an end abruptly as the
 valley floor rises sharply and becomes a wall of rock to the west. The
 rock face is adorned with the few small shrubs that could find a
 footing, but there is no way you could scale the cliff, rising as it
 does out of sight above you. The trees are being pounded by a strong
 northerly wind, the trees and your own fur offering scant protection
 against the bitter cold. There is little undergrowth, just a few shrubs
 spotted around the area, along with some moss, so aside from the
 restrictions imposed by the cliff wall to the west you have unimpeded
 movement in any direction.
    You hear the blast of a horn somewhere to the south, but closer now
 than it was.

>smell
 You can smell an amazing variety of trees and bushes, along with some
 animals, but you are having a hard time trying to distinguish between
 them.
    The noise of a pack of dog barking with the excitement of a chase
 sounds loud in your ears, even above the sound of the wind.

>go east
 You trot east.

 Forest
 There are only trees in every direction you look. It is quite dim, the
 little light there is with the sky fully overcast hardly penetrates the
 thick layer of greenery above. Occasionally a gap will open up, caused
 by the strong northerly wind, and a patch of weak light flashes across
 the moss and shrubs that adorn the forest floor. You can see no
 impediment for movement in any direction.
    Another howl cuts through the sound of the wind, followed almost
 immediately by a horn.

 [ Forest | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go east
 You trot east.

 Forest
 Tall, primordial trees surround you on all sides, but you notice they
 have thinned somewhat; there is more space between the trees, and as a
 consequence more light filters down through the canopy of leaves above.
 The northerly wind, bitterly cold as it strikes your body, stirs the
 leaves and branches overhead, bringing with it various scents and
 fragrances that you are still learning to catalogue. Shrubs decorate
 the base of the trees, and have spread all over, but they don't impede
 your progress too much. There is a track here that runs north/south,
 but you can move in any direction.

    You hear the rapid approach of canine feet from the south. The sound
 resolves into vision as a pack of hounds appears before you, barking
 their excitement at having caught sight of their quarry.
    You turn and flee, fear driving your desperation to escape. But it
 is too late. The dogs have seen you, and the hunters are too close
 behind. There is no way you can throw off their pursuit, no tricks you
 can pull to elude your fate. The pursuit does not last long, and you
 are pulled down by the ravaging beasts.

 East of clearing
 Towering trees surround you on all sides, their upper reaches buffeted
 by an icy northerly wind. With the sky completely overcast, the light
 that penetrates to the forest floor is dim, but to the west it is
 somewhat lighter. At the ground level there are numerous small shrubs
 growing in clumps all around you, particularly near the base of the
 trees, but no so thickly as to prevent movement in any direction. Large
 patches of moss also cover the ground.
    To your ears come the sounds of dogs barking, not too far away to
 the south. And with it is the sound of a horn.
    You notice your scent has been left behind you.

 [ East of clearing | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go east
 You trot east.

 Forest near cliff wall
 The ground rises sharply here before meeting a steep cliff wall that
 soars above you, the upper reaches of it lost in the low-lying clouds.
 Trees have grown right to the base of the cliff, and surround you on
 all sides. The ground is liberally covered in moss and small shrubs are
 growing everywhere you look. A freezing northerly wind is blowing,
 making whistling sounds through the trees. You can move in almost any
 direction, except where the cliff wall to the east blocks passage.
    Somewhere to the south, over the sound of the wind in the trees, you
 can hear dogs barking excitedly not far away.

>go north
 You trot north.

 Forest near cliff wall
 The sheer cliffs of the valley wall rise up before you, blocking any
 further movement east. The height of the cliffs can't be determined,
 with the low lying clouds masking their true extent. The forest
 continues to surround you on all sides, although you feel that the
 density lessens somewhat to the north. The northerly wind is tossing
 around the upper branches violently, and howling loudly as it does. You
 feel the chill of the wind even while protected from most of the force
 by the trees.
    At ground level there is a lot of undergrowth, the same small shrubs
 you have seen everywhere, but none of it will restrict your movement.
 There are also occasional patches of moss spotted around, mostly
 beneath the trees and where the light from overhead is weakest.
    Piercing through the sound of the wind, the howl of a hunting dog
 following a scent reaches your ears.

>go north
 You trot north.

 Forest edge
 The southern forest ends here at a stream that flows in from the west.
 The stream itself also seems to end here, disappearing underground
 through a crack in the sheer cliff wall to the east that towers over
 you. The sheerness of the cliff prevents even the thought of climbing
 it, and it bends around you to the north as well. The northern bank of
 the stream is made of shale, but it quickly recedes into a vast, open
 grassland you can see in the northwest. A frigid northerly wind is
 blowing, a sign of the approaching winter.
    You hear the blast of a horn somewhere to the south, but closer now
 than it was.

    Another howl cuts through the sound of the wind, followed almost

>go northwest
 You wade through the water and cross the stony northern bank. As you
 do, your feet cause the stones to clatter, the sound incredibly loud in
 your ears. The dogs are fast, and you hear the rapid approach of canine
 feet. The sound resolves into vision as a pack of hounds appears before
 you, barking their excitement at having caught sight of their quarry.
    You turn and flee, fear driving your desperation to escape. But it

 You are standing in the narrow stream with water up to your neck. The

>go east
 You move through the neck-deep water, moving with the flow towards the
 east.


 Forest edge (standing in the stream)
 You are standing in the narrow stream with icy water up to your neck.
 The water flows from the west and continues eastwards, and you struggle
 to keep your footing against the flow. Southwards is a great forest,
 which appears to end here at the stream, for beyond the stream, over
 the loose shale on the northern bank, is nothing but open grasslands,
 waving in the cold, northerly wind. Apart from the northeast, where the
 valley wall protrudes into the valley itself, you can move in any
 direction.
    You hear the blast of a horn somewhere to the south, but closer now
 than it was.

>go north
 You struggle out of the water and cross the stony northern bank. As you
 do, your feet cause the stones to clatter, the sound incredibly loud in
 your ears. The dogs are fast, and you hear the rapid approach of canine
 feet. The sound resolves into vision as a pack of hounds appears before
 you, barking their excitement at having caught sight of their quarry.
    You turn and flee, fear driving your desperation to escape. But it
 is too late. The dogs have seen you, and the hunters are too close
 behind. There is no way you can throw off their pursuit, no tricks you
 can pull to elude your fate. The pursuit does not last long, and you
 are pulled down by the ravaging beasts.

 Forest edge (standing in the stream)
 You are standing in the narrow stream with water up to your neck. The
 stream, which flows in from the west, gurgles through a crack in the
 valley wall in the east, preventing any further passage in that
 direction. The great forest to the south is being buffeted by a strong
 northerly wind, while to the northeast, across the loose shale of the
 northern stream bank, is open grassland.
    The valley wall to the east is quite sheer and precludes any thought
 of climbing it.   The sound of the dogs is close but confused. You can
 hear them whining as they try to recover the scent.

 Forest
 Tall, primordial trees surround you on all sides, but you notice they
 have thinned somewhat; there is more space between the trees, and as a
 consequence more light filters down through the canopy of leaves above.
 The northerly wind, bitterly cold as it strikes your body, stirs the
 leaves and branches overhead, bringing with it various scents and
 fragrances that you are still learning to catalogue. Shrubs decorate
 the base of the trees, and have spread all over, but they don't impede
 your progress too much. There is a track here that runs north/south,
 but you can move in any direction.
    To your ears come the sounds of dogs barking, not too far away to
 the south. And with it is the sound of a horn.
    You notice your scent has been left behind you.

>go north

 Forest edge
 The forest comes to an end here, the last few trees petering out into

 open grassland. The sky above is bleak and grey, and the northerly wind
 is harsh and cold. A small brook, no more that a few feet wide, winds
 its way from the west and continues eastwards, bubbling and gurgling
 softly as it goes. The water depth is not great though, for the track
 makes no attempt to bridge the water. The far bank consists of loose
 stones and shale, and beyond you can see the track continuing to the
 north. Otherwise you can move in any direction.
    Somewhere to the south, over the sound of the wind in the trees, you
 can hear dogs barking excitedly not far away.

 [ Forest edge | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
 You position yourself in the centre of the creek. While not deep, you
 are only just able to keep your footing in the water. The water is icy;
 it feels like your body has been pierced with a thousand needles.


 Forest edge (standing in the stream)
 You are standing in the narrow stream with icy water up to your neck.
 The stream flows from the west and continues eastwards, while a track
 from the south emerges from the depths of the forest and heads
 northwards into open grassland, over the loose shale of the stream
 bank. A northerly wind blows cold, frigid mountain air, along with a
 variety of scents and smells, plants and animals you are still trying

 You pass through the water of the stream and creep over the mass of

 fur you find yourself shivering uncontrollably.

 [ Your score just went up by three. ]


 Grassy plain
 The howling of the wind fills your ears as you survey the eastern side
 of the grasslands. The grass, while not tall, is still being whipped
 about by the icy wind, making it resemble a tempest on the sea. The
 valley wall rises to the east, and then narrows to the north, limiting
 any move further up the valley to just the northwest. The grasslands
 extend westwards, while to the south you can make out the line of trees
 marking the edge of the forest.

 Track
 The walls of the valley narrow substantially here, almost joining in
 the middle. Boulders and loose stones fill the valley floor having
 fallen from the imposing cliffs on either side. The track meanders
 around the largest obstacles as it continues northwards, but the view
 to the north is cut short by a small rise which you can't see beyond.
 To the south the track emerges from a vast green expanse, a stretch of
 waving grass that fills up your southern view entirely but stops quite
 unexpectedly a short distance away.
    You can hear a strong wind howling as it blows over the cliffs, but
 little of the wind can be felt below.

 [ Track | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go north
 You trot north towards the rise, but stop suddenly when your vulpine
 senses detect movement ahead. You creep forward and peer carefully over
 the rise.
    A short distance ahead you can see the village of Tallum. Closest to
 you is what looks like the village square, a large paved area that is
 probably used for village celebrations and gatherings but is now almost
 deserted.
    Almost. There are four men in the centre of the square. One man is
 hovering about five feet above the ground, whimpering as his legs and
 arms flail wildly, his face and arms marked by bruises and cuts, his
 greying beard and hair unkempt. The incongruity of a man suspended in
 the air without apparent support distracts you momentarily and you fail
 to examine the other men closely.
    Two of the men are like apparitions from the past. Every story
 you've heard about the war with Gord ten years ago includes horrific
 tales of the destructive force that were the Ralyon warriors. Their
 magically enhanced endurance and strength, evidenced by the
 overdeveloped muscles in their upper body, were the cause of nightmares
 for the King of Rylane during the war. They were supposed to have been
 destroyed, with no chance they could ever come back.
    And then you notice the other man standing there. A man dressed
 completely in black, with an amulet of blue around his neck.
    The mysterious phantom you saw in Ryla.
    The man appears to be really present this time, with nothing
 wraith-like about his appearance. He is facing the hovering man with
 one arm upraised almost as if to help him down.
    "Why do my men continue to die on the mountain?" the black-robed man
 demands, his voice carrying to you quite clearly. "You tell me there's
 nothing to fear, but my men continue to die. Why?"
    "I'm sorry, my lord," the hovering man replies, his voice breaking.
 "We didn't know..."
    "Didn't know?! How could you not know? You're the mayor of this
 pathetic little village, aren't you? You live so close you must have
 contact with him. Don't your people go up there from time to time?"
    "My lord, we don't go up the mountain. He doesn't visit us here.
 Please my lord, I'm speaking the truth..."
    "Maybe I'll just send your children up the mountains instead. You
 have a daughter, don't you?"
    The mayor, who had been struggling against his predicament, freezes
 and his face turns white.
    "No!" he gasps. "Please, she's only five. I'll do anything you
 want..."
    "Look, I'm tired of your grovelling. You obviously can't help me,
 and I'm too busy to waste more time on you. I'll come back later and
 find someone who can."
    And with that, the black robed man waves his hand and the hapless
 man suddenly flies upwards at an incredible rate, screaming the entire
 time. You hear the scream move in a southerly direction as the wind
 catches the man and carries him away, and eventually the sound fades
 away completely.
    In front of you, the black robed man turns to the Ralyon guards, and
 speaks in a voice even you can't hear. The guards immediately turn and
 head west. When they have departed, the black robed man waves his hand
 again, and there is a bright flash of green light which blinds you
 momentarily. When your eyes clear, the black robed man has vanished.
    You wait for a moment or two to make sure there is no further
 danger, then make your way to the village square.



 Village square
 A broad area of stone pavement marks the centre of the village of
 Tallum. At each corner of the square is a tall wooden pole, around the
 top of which are the remains of some decorations from some previous
 village celebration.
    A rough track to the northeast leads to what looks like some land
 devoted to farming, to the southeast you can see some animal stalls,
 and directly east is a large, barn-like structure. A cluster of houses
 that must make up the residential part of the town can be seen to the
 southwest, while a tall building, which resembles a mill, can also be
 seen to the north. A well-worn path leads west, up a small incline, to
 what seems to be an inn.
    The village appears to be protected from the howling wind somewhat,
 with only a few light gusts reaching ground level.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- movement to the west.

>go east

 Barns
 The eastern edge of the village is devoted solely to barns and grain
 storage. Two barns are visible, although one of them has recently burnt
 to the ground leaving only half a wall and some beams. Alongside the
 undamaged barn is a grain silo, a cylindrical structure standing almost
 as tall as the barn itself. The door to the barn, which is painted a
 dull red colour, is currently shut.
    To the south you can see some animal stalls, and in the north you
 can see some fields. The village square lies to the west.

>go south

 Animal stalls
 Three large animal stalls have been constructed here, each one
 separated from the next by a small wooden wall. Each stall has an
 enclosed area at the rear for the comfort of any animals during harsh
 weather. The first of the three stalls is a pig pen, which contains
 about half a dozen animals who are actively moving around in search of
 food. A gate keeps the pigs contained in the pen. The other stalls are
 currently vacant and appear to have been so for some time.
    Looking to the north you can see a large barn and silo, while the
 village square lies to the northwest.

 [ Animal stalls | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>examine pigs
 There are about half a dozen pigs in the pen, all rooting around in the
 dirt looking for food. They appear to be a little on the thin side.

>examine pen
 Please be more clear, what do you want to examine?  The pig stall or
 the empty stalls?

>examine pig stall
 The pig stall is a small fenced area with a small gate, a trough for
 feed and water, and a small roofed area at the rear that would be used
 by the pigs for shelter. The pen currently holds six pigs.

>open gate
 You place both paws on the top of the gate and give it a push, but the
 gate is secured by the loop of rope and will not open.

>examine rope
>pull rope
 The rope is used to secure the gate to a hook which is embedded in the
 gatepost. The rope is currently looped over the hook, keeping the gate
 from opening.

 You consider trying to pull the loop of rope, but you can't imagine
 there being anything to gain by doing so.

>bark
 You bark fiercely.

>oink
 A stray thought enters your mind, but you dismiss it quickly. It just

>examine hook
 It is a crude, metal hook, hammered into the gatepost, and used for
 keeping the gate shut. A loop of rope that runs through the gate and
 over the hook is currently doing this job.

>chew rope
 [bite rope]
 You attack the loop of rope with vigour, and in moments it lies at your
 feet in a shredded, tangled mess.

>open gate
 You place both paws on the top of the gate and give it a push. It
 swings open easily and then bangs into the wall, startling both
 yourself and the pigs within.
    There is a moment of sudden quietness. The pigs are all looking at
 you standing in the open gate, and you wonder for a moment what might
 be going on in their minds. Then the stillness is broken as the pigs,
 almost as one, stampede towards the gate, squealing in delight. You
 barely have time to jump out of the way, before the pigs rush past you
 and vanish to the northwest.
    The sight of the pigs running away was almost comical, but then you
 hear a sinister cry coming from the other side of town that drains any
 vestige of joy from your heart.
    "Arrrgh! There is someone here! Find them!"
    That could only be the Ralyon guards. And they now know you're here.

 point of entry, a small wooden door, which is currently closed. A
 wheelbarrow is sitting just in front of the door.
    To the east, following the stream, you can see an open area of

 The eastern edge of the village is devoted solely to barns and grain
 storage. Two barns are visible, although one of them has recently burnt
 to the ground leaving only half a wall and some beams. Alongside the
 undamaged barn is a grain silo, a cylindrical structure standing almost
 as tall as the barn itself. The door to the barn, which is painted a
 dull red colour, is currently shut.
    To the south you can see some animal stalls, and in the north you
 can see some fields. The village square lies to the west.

>go south
 You trot south.

 Animal stalls
 Three large animal stalls have been constructed here, each one
 separated from the next by a small wooden wall. Each stall has an
 enclosed area at the rear for the comfort of any animals during harsh
 weather. The first of the three stalls is a pig pen, which contains
 about half a dozen animals who are actively moving around in search of
 food. A gate keeps the pigs contained in the pen. The other stalls are
 currently vacant and appear to have been so for some time.
    Looking to the north you can see a large barn and silo, while the
 village square lies to the northwest.

    A tangled mess of shredded rope lies on the ground near the gate.

 [ Animal stalls | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>open gate
 You place both paws on the top of the gate and give it a push. It
 swings open easily and then bangs into the wall, startling both
 yourself and the pigs within.
    There is a moment of sudden quietness. The pigs are all looking at
 you standing in the open gate, and you wonder for a moment what might
 be going on in their minds. Then the stillness is broken as the pigs,
 almost as one, stampede towards the gate, squealing in delight. You
 barely have time to jump out of the way, before the pigs rush past you
 and vanish to the northwest.
    The sight of the pigs running away was almost comical, but then you
 hear a sinister cry coming from the other side of town that drains any
 vestige of joy from your heart.
    "Arrrgh! There is someone here! Find them!"
    That could only be the Ralyon guards. And they now know you're here.

 Fields
 The northeastern side of the valley stretches out here and accommodates
 fields undoubtedly used by the people of Tallum to provide for

 fields at the moment, just tilled earth awaiting the rejuvenation of
 spring. A narrow stream, which flows in from the west, marks the
 boundary, skirting around the fields and disappearing somewhere beyond.

 Cluster of houses
 There are around a dozen houses nestled in this southwestern corner of

 the same construction, with thatched roofs, low doors, and few windows.
 Most are daubed with mud or grime. What is more surprising is the

 There is little left of the burnt barn. Half of one wall is still
 erect, along with a couple of the corner posts. The interior is a mess

 You push against the barn doors with your paws, but you can't get them

 from stone.

>examine ground
 The ground here is mostly just packed earth, harder where traffic has

 The ground is certainly soft enough to allow you to dig, but you're not
 sure what could be gained by digging random holes. You decide to think
 about this further before expending unnecessary energy.

 Inside the barn
 A stack of hay bales dominates the interior of the barn, sitting just
 to the left of the main door, towering above you and occupying a large
 proportion of the barn's available floor space. The upper reaches of
 the barn are dim, but light through the window over the door gives
 adequate light to the lower areas. The main door out of the barn is
 currently closed, although a tunnel has been dug beneath it which looks
 large enough to provide an exit.
    Towards the rear of the barn is a loft, a platform that provides an
 additional level of storage, which comes about halfway towards the
 front of the barn. At one end of the loft you spy a moveable ladder,
 which would provide access to the loft if it weren't in a stored
 position, tied up with a rope that looks to be out of reach.

    Leaning up against the rear wall is a pick.

>examine hay
 The hale bales are stacked in the corner of the barn, to the left of
 the door, and fill up almost a third of the floor space of the barn.
 They are stacked about four bales high and three deep. The bales making
 up the nearest corner of the entire stack seem to be sagging outwards
 somewhat, which looks to be because of a poorly bound bale at the
 bottom of the stack.

>push bale
 You consider trying to push the poorly bound hay bale, but you can't
 imagine there being anything to gain by doing so.

>chew bale
 [bite bale]
 You attack the disintegrating hay bale with vigour, ripping hay out
 with your teeth and digging into it with your paws. You notice the
 sagging in the upper bales increasing, and just as they fall you jump
 out of the way to avoid being crushed. Two bales from near the top
 bounce across the floor, one coming to rest near the rear of the barn,
 while the other slams into the opposite wall and dislodges one of the
 planks that form part of its construction. The plank falls into the
 barn, and weak daylight filters through the opening. A third bale also
 falls, but it rolls to a stop not far from the stack.

>examine plank
 The plank of wood is about six feet in length, and about six inches
 across. It appears to have been part of the wall of the barn. The plank
 is currently lying on the floor beside the ladder.

>stand on bale
 You think about it, but there doesn't appear to be any reason to stand
 on that.

>climb bale
 In your current state, climbing that would be impossible. You could
 really only climb on something lower or more easily scaled.

>push bale
 Please be more clear, what do you want to push?  The poorly bound hay
 bale or the scattered hay bales?

>move plank
 You could probably drag the plank with your teeth, but you should
 indicate to which location you want to drag it.

>push scattered
 You consider trying to push the scattered hay bales, but you can't
 imagine there being anything to gain by doing so.

>examine rope
 The rope is designed to raise or lower the ladder which provides access
 to the loft. At the moment the rope is tied up, holding the ladder in
 place and out of reach.

>pull rope
 The hay bale that landed nearby provides you will the additional height
 you need to allow you to jump up and grab the rope with your teeth. You
 hold on grimly as the weight of your body pulls the rope free and with
 a sudden bang the ladder drop down into place. You let go of the rope
 and land on the floor.

>go up
 You clamber awkwardly up the ladder.


 Loft
 The wide, wooden floor of the loft surrounds you, covered in dust and
 wheat husks. Right in the centre of the floor is an open trapdoor, the
 door hanging down well out of reach, but there is little else to see
 here. A ladder leading down, located at the far end of the platform, is
 the only avenue for movement. You can see quite clearly into the barn
 area below, noting the barn door and the window above it, and the stack
 of hay bales beside the door.

    Lying on its side nearby is an empty barrel.

 the southwest.

>in
 You crawl through the tunnel under the door.


 Inside the barn
 A stack of hay bales dominates the interior of the barn, sitting just
 to the left of the main door, towering above you and occupying a large
 proportion of the barn's available floor space, although a couple of
 bales appear to have fallen from the main stack and are now scattered
 around the dirt floor of the barn. The upper reaches of the barn are
 dim, but light through the window over the door gives adequate light to
 the lower areas. The main door out of the barn is currently closed,
 although a tunnel has been dug beneath it which looks large enough to
 provide an exit.
    Towards the rear of the barn is a loft, a platform that provides an
 additional level of storage, which comes about halfway towards the
 front of the barn. At one end of the loft you spy a moveable ladder
 which provides access to the loft. The bottom of the ladder now rests
 on the ground, with the rope that previously secured it hanging down
 beside the ladder.

    A wooden plank has been positioned on the hay bale underneath the
 loft, and a pick has been placed on one end of it.



 [ Inside the barn | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go up
 You clamber awkwardly up the ladder.


 Loft
 The wide, wooden floor of the loft surrounds you, covered in dust and
 wheat husks. Right in the centre of the floor is an open trapdoor, the
 door hanging down well out of reach, but there is little else to see
 here. A ladder leading down, located at the far end of the platform, is
 the only avenue for movement. You can see quite clearly into the barn
 area below, noting the barn door and the window above it, and the stack
 of hay bales beside the door.

    Lying on its side nearby is an empty barrel.

>bark
 You bark fiercely.
    From outside the barn you hear a cry, a guttural bellow that sounds
 like the precursor to an attack. A second later the door to the barn
 bursts open and the hulking form of a Ralyon warrior rushes in.

>push barrel
 You give the barrel a firm push with your paws and it trundles towards
 the trapdoor before falling through it. You hear it strike the plank,
 and fire the pick through the air towards the door.
    From your position in the loft you see the warrior give a started
 look before the end of the pick pierces his eye. The force of the
 weapon throws him onto his back, just inside the door, where he
 twitches for a few moments and then falls still.

 Ralyon warriors are known for their fearsome strength and endurance,

 muscles in the man's arms and legs are overdeveloped, bulging beneath
 his plain tunic and trousers. Even in death they look powerful.  The

 Mill
 Made from oak and painted a dark brown colour, the mill is more of a
 functional building than providing any visual appeal. A narrow stream
 flows in from the west via a series of small cascades, passes through
 the mill, then continues its flow eastwards. The mill has a single
 point of entry, a small wooden door, which is currently closed. A
 wheelbarrow is sitting to one side of the door.
    To the east, following the stream, you can see an open area of
 farmland, while to the south you can see the village square. To the
 southwest, up a short incline, is the village inn, but to the west the
 hill becomes unclimbable.

 The stream is not particularly wide, but it is quite deep and moving
 quickly. On first glance the stream appears to flow in from the west,
 through the mill, and head east towards the fields. But on closer
 inspection, however, you see that the stream actually flows around the
 rear of the mill, and a man-made culvert has been dug which leads into
 the mill. Water flows into this channel by means of a small gate.

 After your previous drenching, you don't feel like repeating the

 Village Inn
 Before you stands the inn of the village Tallum, a large structure with
 whitewashed walls and thatched roof and a sign hanging over the door
 which reads, "The Ploughman's Repast". There is no smoke coming from
 the chimney but faint sounds can be heard coming from within. To the
 right of the inn is a pyramid of stacked beer barrels, while on the
 southern side there is a small stable before which a rather ungroomed
 pack-horse is tethered.
    This part of the village appears to be on a natural hillock, and so
 for directions other than north there is a slight descent involved. To
 the south past the stable is a cluster of houses that must make up the
 residential part of the town, while a mill can also be seen to the
 northeast. A well-worn path leads east to the village square, but a
 less travelled path heads north up a sharp incline.


 [ Village Inn | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]

 The pyramid of beer barrels is tall, made up of four rows of barrels
 all lying on their side. Given the barrels are still standing outside,
 and haven't been moved inside the inn itself, you surmise that they
 have only been recently delivered.

 Cluster of houses
 There are around a dozen houses nestled in this southwestern corner of

 Most are daubed with mud or grime. What is more surprising is the
 complete lack of activity here; no chimneys smoking, no open doors or
 windows, no sounds coming from within, just an eerie silence.
    To the northeast you can see the village square, while a
 well-trodden path leads north up a brief incline to the inn.

 The horse is a uniform brown colour, although dirt and grim cover his
 lower legs and the underside of his body, but this seems to match his
 matted mane and tail. His eyes, though, are wild and his nostrils are
 flaring; you suspect the presence of the Ralyon guards has instilled in
 this beast a feeling of panic. It probably wouldn't take much to put

 Inside the mill
 The interior of the mill is quite dim, but your vulpine eyesight allows
 you to see things quite clearly. An enormous, motionless, paddle wheel
 is directly in front of you, mounted in a narrow channel that bisects
 the room left to right. A variety of gears connect the paddle wheel to
 an equally huge mill stone, and a short lever appears to control the
 machine. Overhead you can see a large, metal tray, suspended from the
 ceiling by a rope.

 Mill
 Made from oak and painted a dark brown colour, the mill is more of a
 functional building than providing any visual appeal. A narrow stream
 flows in from the west via a series of small cascades, passes behind
 the mill, then continues its flow eastwards. A narrow channel allows
 water to flow into the mill itself. The mill has a single point of
 entry, a small wooden door, which has been smashed to splinters. A
 wheelbarrow is sitting to one side of the door. Several pieces of a
 broken barrel lie scattered around the remains of the door.
    To the east, following the stream, you can see an open area of
 farmland, while to the south you can see the village square. To the
 southwest, up a short incline, is the village inn, but to the west the
 hill becomes unclimbable.

 The stream is not particularly wide, but it is quite deep and moving

 rear of the mill, and a man-made culvert has been dug which leads into
 the mill. Water flows into this channel by means of a small gate.

 You bite into the rope, your teeth quickly cutting through the coarse

 rolling into the room.

 Ralyon warriors are known for their fearsome strength and endurance,

 Village Inn
 Before you stands the inn of the village Tallum, a large structure with
 whitewashed walls and thatched roof and a sign hanging over the door
 which reads, "The Ploughman's Repast". There is no smoke coming from
 the chimney but faint sounds can be heard coming from within. To the
 right of the inn is a disorganised pile of beer barrels, while on the
 southern side there is a small stable.
    This part of the village appears to be on a natural hillock, and so
 for directions other than north there is a slight descent involved. To
 the south past the stable is a cluster of houses that must make up the
 residential part of the town, while a mill can also be seen to the
 northeast. A well-worn path leads east to the village square, but a
 less travelled path heads north up a sharp incline.

 Cluster of houses
 There are around a dozen houses nestled in this southwestern corner of
 the village, but you can see little to distinguish them. They all have
 the same construction, with thatched roofs, low doors, and few windows.
 Most are daubed with mud or grime. What is more surprising is the
 complete lack of activity here; no chimneys smoking, no open doors or
 windows, no sounds coming from within, just an eerie silence.

 Village square
 A broad area of stone pavement marks the centre of the village of
 Tallum. At each corner of the square is a tall wooden pole, around the
 top of which are the remains of some decorations from some previous
 village celebration.
    A rough track to the northeast leads to what looks like some land
 devoted to farming, to the southeast you can see some animal stalls,
 and directly east is a large, barn-like structure. A cluster of houses
 that must make up the residential part of the town can be seen to the
 southwest, while a tall building, which resembles a mill, can also be
 seen to the north. A well-worn path leads west, up a small incline, to

 with only a few light gusts reaching ground level.

 Barns
 The eastern edge of the village is devoted solely to barns and grain
 storage. Two barns are visible, although one of them has recently burnt
 to the ground leaving only half a wall and some beams. Alongside the
 undamaged barn is a grain silo, a cylindrical structure standing almost
 as tall as the barn itself. The barn door is currently open, but little
 of the interior can be seen from here.  A hole has been dug in the
 ground underneath where the barn door would be if it were closed.
    To the south you can see some animal stalls, and in the north you

 Fields
 The northeastern side of the valley stretches out here and accommodates
 fields undoubtedly used by the people of Tallum to provide for

 fields at the moment, just tilled earth awaiting the rejuvenation of
 spring. A narrow stream, which flows in from the west, marks the
 boundary, skirting around the fields and disappearing somewhere beyond.

 the three was, until quite recently, a pig pen. The other stalls appear
 to have been empty for some time.
    Looking to the north you can see a large barn, while the village
 square lies to the northwest.

 The walls of the valley narrow substantially here, almost joining in

 fallen from the imposing cliffs on either side. The track meanders
 around the largest obstacles as it continues northwards, but the view
 to the north is cut short by a small rise which you can't see beyond.
 To the south the track emerges from a vast green expanse, a stretch of
 waving grass that fills up your southern view entirely but stops quite
 unexpectedly a short distance away.

 little of the wind can be felt below.

 The open grassland that surrounds you here is bisected by the rough

 south you can make out the edge of the forest. More grasslands can be
 seen to the east and west.

 Grassy plain
 The vast expanse of open grassland in which you stand is being thrashed
 by the viciously cold wind. The grass is short and offers little in the
 way of protection from the wind. The grey overcast sky and bitter wind
 has turned what might have been a picturesque mountain scene into one
 of barrenness and isolation, draining the landscape of colour. The
 valley wall rises to the west and narrows to the north, limiting
 further progress along the valley to the northeast. The grasslands
 extend to the east, while you can just make out the edge of the forest

 that is all, and on the other side the track begins to veer sharply
 upwards as the valley comes to an end. The howling wind is louder here,
 but you still feel the protection of the cliffs to the east and west
 which are again closing. Apart from the northern direction presented by
 the bridge, to the south you can see the village inn.

 [ Stone bridge | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go east
 You look to find some way down the hill, following the stream, but it
 is just too steep.

>go north
 You trot north across the stone bridge.


 Mountain trail
 The ground here drops away to the north quite suddenly, leaving you
 standing at the top of a cliff, from which you are given a spectacular
 vista of snow-capped mountain peaks rising above dim valleys, although
 many of the higher peaks are lost in the clouds overhead. The wind is
 once again whipping around you now you have left the protection
 afforded by the valley. The trail, if something so vague and indistinct
 can be called that, veers westward here, following a ridge as it rises
 upwards. To the south the trail heads back to a small stone bridge

 [ Mountain trail | Part Two as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>go west
 You trot west.

 Pool
 A natural hollow off to one side of the ridge has become, over time, a
 mountain pool, filled with the runoff from melting winter snows. The
 water is dark and still, reflecting the glowering clouds overhead with
 startling clarity, although the surface is regularly disturbed by the
 blustery wind. The trail follows the ridge-line west up the
 mountainside, and eastwards down.

    On the other side of the pool a vixen is standing, staring at you
 intently.

>kiss vixen
 The vixen is watching you intently from her position on the other side
 of the pool.

    She is captivating, and I find myself drawn to her in ways I can't
 begin to explain. She is a undoubtedly a beautiful creature, her red
 fur coat full and rich, her tail long and lustrous. But with each
 moment I look at her I feel emotion building within me. It's a strange,
 almost alien feeling, while at the same time part of me. Where did it
 come from, and how did it build so fast?

>examine vixen
 The vixen has not moved, but she continues to watch you with wide eyes.

    Her eyes are so deep, drawing me in, almost human-like in their
 ability to communicate with me. I sense her desire matching my own,
 although how I know that I can't explain. I feel a forceful urge to go
 with her, to lose myself in this well of feeling, which I am fighting,
 but I don't know for how long.

 You feel like you'd like to talk, but you realise that in your current
 state, this is impossible. The best you could do is bark or growl.

 You slowly circle the pool and draw close to the vixen.

    I can't control these feelings. My body reacts without my direct

 from continuing, but I fear I've left it too late. I've allowed this
 animal desire to overwhelm me, and I am no more.

 my thoughts flee like minnows before a shark, and all I see is the

 Plateau
 The ridge, which the trail has been following, comes to an end here,
 flattening out into a broad, open area that stretches out before you. A
 number of scraggly gorse bushes have managed to find enough soil to
 grow at various points on the plateau, and they break up the otherwise
 barren nature of the location.
    To the north, past a couple of enormous piles of boulders, a narrow
 passage can be seen which leads into a tight ravine. The only other
 viable direction for movement is back along the trail eastwards.
    Your vulpine senses detect danger nearby.

 The ravine looks to have been formed through some pre-historic
 geological upheaval that tore into the mountain and left this scar. The

 The boulders are huge, like a giant's marbles, and are piled up in

 The gorse bushes are not very big, but their branches are quite dense.
 There are a number of bushes scattered around the plateau.
    However, on further examination, you notice that there appears to be
 something hidden within several of the bushes, something that looks
 like small tubes. Noting where each of them are, you should be able to
 avoid their fields of fire.
    Despite having uncovered this trap, you sense there are more here
 somewhere.

 [ Your score just went up by one. ]

>examine ground
 The ground is flat and mostly made from rock, but on further
 investigation you begin to see a vague outline traced in the ground.
 The outline covers a wide, square area that you would have probably
 crossed if you travelled further north. You should now be able to avoid
 it.
    You sense that, even though you have uncovered two traps now, there
 is still danger lurking nearby.

    Since experiencing that odd tingling sensation, you focus a little
 more on the boulders. At first you don't notice anything, but then it
 strikes you - some of the boulders aren't balanced. They appear to be
 resting in precarious positions, held in place by some sort of magic.
 But having noted which boulders are set to fall, you can easily avoid
 them.

 [ Your score just went up by one. ]

>go north
 You trot north, stepping around the edge of the mysterious outline on
 the ground, and moving carefully past each of the bushes where blow
 darts are stationed, watching them fire their darts uselessly into the
 air. You also give the magically balanced boulders a wide birth, and
 they each fall to the ground safely. And so you pass into the ravine.
    Behind you, you hear the sound of boulders grinding against each
 other, which you imagine is the magical trap resetting itself.


 Narrow ravine
 The walls of the ravine rise almost straight up from the ground,
 leaving only the barest spit of rock to walk on. You can barely see the
 top of the cliffs from here, and indeed, the entire area is rather dim
 due to the cliffs towering above. Progress further along the ravine has
 been blocked by a monstrous pile of rubble directly in front of you.
 The only way out is back to the south.

    Your eyes have barely adjusted to the dimness when they are blinded
 by a flash of blue light, and your ears are deafened by a roar of
 thunder. You stagger backwards a couple of steps, dazed.
    When your eyes clear, you see standing before you a woman. She is a
 giant of a woman, standing ten feet tall, chest encased in armour of
 burnished bronze, and wielding a sword of polished steel. Her face is
 tanned, and her hair dark and lustrous.
    The woman looks around with a suspicious glare before her eyes
 finally seek out your diminutive form. And then her expression becomes
 confused.
    "What is this?" her voice booms in the narrow confines of the
 ravine. "A fox has defeated my traps? I expected to see more of Vetan's
 minions, but not a fox."
    The massive warrior's eyes narrow as she looks at you. "Perhaps you
 are more than what you seem. I will give you one chance. Prove to me
 that you are more than just a fox, and I will spare your life."

    There is another flash of light and peal of thunder, and suddenly
 the female warrior is gone. Instead, a wizened old man stands before
 you, his face wrinkled by the weight of years, half bent over and
 leaning on a walking stick. His beard is so long it almost touches the
 ground in front of him. He is wearing a thick, woollen cloak and
 sturdy, fur-lined boots.
    The man looks down at you with a confused expression.
    "So what do have we here?" he says, looking directly at you. "I
 never expected my traps would be overcome by a fox," he says quietly.
 "But you are quite obviously more than just a fox."
    There is a long pause as he looks at you carefully.
    "I see," the man says. "I think I'd better find out what this is all
 about."
    He raises his arms, and a golden light envelopes you. You feel a
 strange sensation pass through you, and for a moment you can't feel the
 ground under your feet. But slowly everything clears and you find
 yourself somewhere else.

 Wizard's cottage
 A warm fire is glowing in the hearth, which is providing the cottage
 with light and giving it a cosy feel. It is not a large cottage by any
 standard, and made even smaller by the number of things that fill the
 room. On either side of the fireplace are two enormous bookshelves,
 loaded with books and scrolls. A low table in the centre of the room is
 likewise burdened with parchments, and a variety of small bowls and
 implements. There is a cupboard with a glass door in the far corner of
 the room which holds a number of pots and jars, the contents of which
 you can't determine. Next to this is a simple wooden bed, and a single
 door leads outside.

    Master Limos is here, seated on a stool next to the table, and
 regarding you with keen eyes.

    "So," Master Limos says, stretching his legs out in front of him
 while looking at you directly. "Who are you and why are you here?"
    All you can do is stare back at him.
    "Hmm," the wizard continues. "I think what we need here is a little
 vocal stimulation."
    He raises a hand above his head, mumbles something in a strange
 tongue, and suddenly you are struck to the ground by an invisible hand.
 You feel your throat tighten, almost as if someone is strangling you,
 then it releases and the pain subsides.
    You stagger to your feet again, groaning.
    Groaning?
    "How's that?" the wizard asks.
    You clear your throat, and say, "Err..." -- I can talk! -- "...I
 feel quite strange..."
    Limos nods. "That's to be expected. Well, given that you are
 actually talking, that means you aren't really a fox. If you had been a
 fox nothing would have happened."
    "Thank you for helping me..." you begin, your voice sounding strange
 in your ears, but Limos interrupts.
    "I think I'm entitled to start this off. Back to my first question:
 who are you are why are you here?"
    You fill Limos in briefly on your plight, how you were wrongly
 convicted of the murder of Prince Alsanter, and how King Rithusar, your
 foster father, saved you from execution by having the wizard Rixomas
 curse you, turning you into a fox. You also relate Rixomas' instruction
 to you, that you should head for a wizard in the Rylane mountains,
 called Master Limos.
    "I see," the wizard says. "Did Rixomas give you any idea about what
 I might be able to do for you?"
    "Err, no not really," you reply. "However, you have already helped
 me immensely by giving me the ability to communicate."
    "I'll have to think about how else I can help you," Limos says. "In
 the meantime, I suppose you have some questions yourself. Now that you
 have a voice, you could probably ask them."

 [ Use "TOPICS" at any time to view a list of subjects that Master Limos
 might be willing to discuss. ]

>examine wizard
 Master Limos is old, possibly the oldest man you've ever seen. His face
 is wrinkled by the weight of years, and his beard is white and long,
 but there is a kindness and light in his eyes that seem almost
 youth-like. His walking stick is leaning up against the table next to
 him.

>ask limos about curse
 "Is there anything you can do about the curse?" you ask.
    "Well, unfortunately not," Limos says. "That's the nature of a
 curse. If the curse was given with an escape clause, then it's in your
 power to remove it. But if not, then only the wizard who instituted the
 curse can lift it."
    "There was no escape clause in my curse," you reply sadly.
    Limos nods. "Then Rixomas is the only one who can restore you. I can
 only help you in small ways."

 "Tell me, what do you know of Rixomas?"
    "He is a powerful wizard," Limos responds.
    "I know," you reply dryly.
    "I actually studied with Rixomas for a number of years," Limos says.
 "Rixomas was always for intervention, for jumping in and trying to fix
 things. Which is how he ended up at court."
    "What?" you respond, startled by such a comment.
    Limos looks at you for a moment before continuing. "Rithusar's
 father asked Rixomas to be the court wizard many years ago. I never did
 find out why."
    "I just assumed that having a wizard connected to the throne gave
 the throne more power," you respond.
    "Undoubtedly," Limos responds. "But I've heard rumours that
 Rithusar's father had other reasons to ask Rixomas to join him."
    "Do you think he suspected that the Gord might be trying to
 assassinate him?"
    "That's certainly a possibility," he says. "But regardless, you
 should probably know that Rixomas has fallen seriously ill."
    "Ill?" you say, your jaw dropping open. "When? How?"
    "In the last couple of days," Limos says. "Apparently he's been
 feeling off-colour for a while now, and a couple of days ago he
 collapsed. If it wasn't for all these other things going on, like
 Alsanter's murder, I'd just say it was Rixomas working too hard. But I
 don't think that's the case at all."
    "How bad is it?" you ask, unsure if you want to hear the answer.
    "Bad," Limos explains. "He's not responding to treatment."
    "But if Rixomas is the only one who can lift the curse..." you can't
 finish the thought.
    "I know," Limos replies.

>ask limos about rithusar
 "I've always admired what the king has achieved," you say. "He's been
 through a lot."
    "He's a troubled man," Limos replies. "Very troubled."
    "Losing his only son will do that to you."
    The wizard's eyebrows rise up. "Indeed. But his troubles lie deeper
 than that. I think the burden of the crown has been weighing on him
 more lately."
    "How could you know that?" you ask.
    Limos smiles briefly. "I may be a recluse up here in the mountains,
 but that doesn't mean I don't keep tabs on the state of the world. I am
 a wizard, remember."

>ask limos about himself
 "Why do you live so remotely?" you ask.
    "I like being reclusive," Limos says. "It gives me time to think."
    "Isn't it lonely, though?"
    "A little. I can always relocate myself to somewhere more bustling
 if I feel the need. But most of the time I like the solitude."
    "Unlike Rixomas?"
    The wizard nods his head sadly. "In my opinion, I feel that Rixomas
 interferes too much in the flow of history. Some things were meant to
 happen. Trying to change them or prevent them only leads to greater
 calamity. My feeling is that we should let things take their natural
 course."

    "I only met him once," Limos responds. "He came to ask me if I'd be
 willing to come to court."
    "You were asked to be the court wizard?" you respond, surprised.
    "Now, now," the wizard says, chuckling. "I'm not that bad. I just
 wasn't ready for that level of commitment."
    "So did he tell you why he needed you at court?"
    Limos sighs. "Not really. Oh, he made an eloquent speech about nobly
 serving the people of Rylane, but he never mentioned specifics."

>ask limos about prince alsanter
 "Did you know Prince Alsanter at all?" you ask.
    "Not really. His murder was a tragedy, though," Limos says, "but I
 don't think all the story has been told yet."
    "I didn't kill him," you put in.
    "Obviously," Limos says. "But someone did."
    "I couldn't prove anything. I was sure that Lord Sulanar killed him.
 But I couldn't find proof."
    "Perhaps if you'd looked with an open mind you might have found
 something."
    You give Limos a hard stare. "What?"
    "Tell me," Limos says, "How many people did you consider as suspect
 while searching for evidence?"
    "I..." you begin, and then stop as the truth sinks in.
    "I see. So when you didn't find the evidence, did you reach the
 conclusion that perhaps he was innocent?"
    You consider trying to shake your head in defiance. "No," you say
 firmly. "He must have done it! He was the one with the most reason, the
 most opportunity..."
    "But no evidence."
    You fall silent.
    "Now, I'm not saying Sulanar is innocent. But you have to consider
 all possibilities. And maybe one of the possibilities to consider is
 our black-robed friend, Vetan."

>ask limos about vetan
 "So who is this other wizard? Vetan, I think you said?" you ask.
    "Ah, the mysterious young wizard who's trying to rid the world of
 me," Limos laughs.
    "I've seen him a couple of times since becoming cursed. Why does he
 want to kill you?" you ask.
    "Isn't it obvious? Vetan has some plan to take control of Rylane,
 and he wants all possible obstacles out of the way."
    "Who is Vetan?" you ask again.
    Limos is silent for a moment, his brow furrowed in thought. "I'm not
 totally sure," he says at last. "There is such a deep seated bitterness
 and determination in him I've never seen before. I feel he's got some
 connection to the throne of Rylane, but I don't have any details."
    "How much of a threat is he?"
    "You'd be able to assess that as well as I," Limos responds. "He's a
 wizard, and has demonstrated considerable power as such. He has rebuilt
 the Ralyon warriors, which in itself is bad enough. But he wouldn't do
 that, and be trying to kill me, if he wasn't planning for some sort of
 attack on the throne."
    "Can you stop him?" you ask.
    Limos looks at you shrewdly. "I suppose I could stop him. But I
 don't think that's the answer to your problems."
    You look confused, as much as the face of a fox can convey
 confusion. "What does he have to do with me?"
    "The king's son is murdered, Rixomas has fallen gravely ill, and a
 strange wizard appears in the country looking to usurp the throne.
 That's too much of a coincidence in my book."
    "Are you saying that this Vetan is responsible for killing
 Alsanter?"
    "That seems logical, don't you think?"
    "But wait," you say. "If this Vetan wants to use his Ralyon warriors
 to take over Rylane, why would he kill off the heir to the throne? Why
 not just kill him in battle?"
    "That's a good question," Limos replies. "But it presupposes that
 Vetan wants an all-out war. Vetan is undoubtedly trying to take the
 throne, but maybe brute force is not what he has in mind."
    You consider this for a moment. "If that's the case, if Vetan is
 trying to destabilise the throne of Rylane by removing all the heirs,
 then both Rithusar and Tevona are in danger, too."
    Limos nods. "That could well be."

 to the castle at Ryla to resolve all of this."
    "What?!" you cry. "I almost got killed getting out of there. How am
 I supposed to go back?"
    "You want the curse lifted, don't you?" Limos argues. "The only way
 that is going to happen is for you to prove your innocence. The answers
 must be in the castle. That's where the evidence is. Someone in the
 castle killed Prince Alsanter. You have to return to find the answers."
    Limos stands up suddenly. "And with your return in mind, I believe I
 might be able to help you a bit more."
    The wizard moves to the cupboard and pulls a number of small pots
 and jars off the shelves. He mixes the contents on a silver plate and
 then places it at your feet. He then sits down again.
    "Drink this," he says.

>SAVE
>cf30
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>ask limos about plate
 "What is it?" you ask, looking at it dubiously.
    "It won't hurt, if that's what you're worried about," Limos
 explains.
    "But what is it, exactly?" you persist.
    "It's a potion that's going to give you a new skill."
    "You don't want to be more specific, do you?"
    Limos grins at you. "Think of it as a surprise."

>drink
 (the potion)
 You drink the liquid, lapping it up quickly. It tastes very spicy and
 bitter. You're not sure, but you think you feel a little different.
    "Now," Master Limos continues, "what I've done is given you a new
 skill. You should be able to turn yourself invisible. All you should
 need to do is think 'invisible' to make yourself vanish, and think
 'visible' to make yourself appear again. Give it a try."

>think invisible
 You think about invisibility, and immediately you disappear. You turn
 your head to look back at your body, but don't see anything.
    "Excellent!" Master Limos says. "And now make yourself visible
 again."

>think visible
 You concentrate on being visible and instantly your body reappears. You
 look back at yourself for confirmation.
    "Very good," Master Limos says. "Now, there is one limitation. You
 probably won't be able to stay invisible for too long. Probably only a
 couple of minutes at a time. But it may help you gain access to the
 castle."
    "I don't know how I can ever thank you," you say.
    "Well, you've given me a good conversation, which I haven't had in a
 long time, so we're even." Limos smiles at you. "But I also knew your
 father, too. He was a good man, and it's the least I can do to help his
 son."
    You head for the door, but Limos stops you. "There's no immediate
 rush. I can get you to the castle much faster if you'd like, so there's
 no need to walk. And it would be better to arrive after dark, so I can
 probably give you a rest and a bite to eat, if you'd like."
    "Thank you," is all you can say.

    I can't believe how much things have changed in so short a time. An
 hour ago I was running for my life, trying to get away. But now I have
 a new direction to follow, one that gives me a chance at life. I hope I
 can save Tevona, and that I'm not too late.
    Maybe I was too narrow-minded to focus on Lord Sulanar during my
 trial. Maybe I should've broadened my outlook. But what's done is done.
 Now's not the time for reflection. My path is set, and my goal is
 clear. I must return to the castle to find out the truth about who
 killed Alsanter.

 Interlude: Lair

    I don't like wizards. There. I've said it. Now all the world can
 know that I, Lord Sulanar of Alallsia, am a wizard-hater. My dislike
 for members of the magical profession is less to do with the people
 themselves, and more to do with their propensity to think too much of
 themselves. Power, in my experience, tends to corrupt, and wizards
 appear to be more susceptible than others.
    Which was why I couldn't abide these reports of magical activity
 occurring in my province. It's all very well for Rithusar to keep his
 pet wizard on a leash - I don't need mystical powers to maintain
 control on my lands. Besides, magic makes my hands twitch. Initially
 the reports had been benign; a few of the lords of Alallsia had
 reported being met by a stranger with magical powers who offered power
 and wealth in return for their support in a revolt against King
 Rithusar. I would have ignored these reports, at least until the wizard
 deigned to contact me. But then Lord Alsohn vanished, quite literally,
 in front of witnesses. I can't say I was particularly upset, as his
 vocal support for the throne and active pacifism was a constant
 irritant to me. However, as he is one of my supporters as well I
 couldn't just ignore his disappearance, and so I sent a trusted agent
 to investigate.
    Two days later, my agent turned up in the main harbour, sawn in two.
    Which is why I'm now in this run-down warehouse on the outskirts of
 the city with a flaming torch in my hands and my sword at my side. My
 agent's last report included information that had led him here.
 Sometime after coming here he had met his fate.
    I need to know why he died. I need to find my missing lord. I need
 to find this mysterious wizard.
    And rid the world of him.



 Warehouse
 The light from the torch doesn't completely illuminate the area, but
 what you can see is not inspiring. The warehouse has been abandoned for
 a long time, and all that remains are the outer shell, which is in
 danger of falling down at any moment, and piles of rotting garbage,
 which lends an unpleasant aroma to the area. Overhead, the roof is
 disintegrating; large stretches of night sky can be seen through it.
 There is an exit to the north which leads back to the street.

 [ Warehouse | Interlude as Lord Sulanar of Alallsia ]
>smell
 The smell of rotting debris fills your nostrils.

>examine me
 You are Sulanar, Lord of the province of Alallsia, holder of the Shield
 of Manus-Py, descendant from the lines of kings.
    You are wearing some unremarkable street clothes.

>inventory
 You are wearing some unremarkable street clothes, and you are carrying
 a torch and a sword.

>remove clothes
 A strange thought occurs to you, but you dismiss it immediately.
 Removing your clothes would be completely inappropriate.

 The torch is providing light. The flame flickers occasionally but is
 otherwise steady.

>examine sword
 It's the most nondescript sword you could find when you came out on

 irrational.

>search garbage
 [examine garbage]
 Rubbish is scattered almost the entire length and breadth of the
 warehouse floor. Due to the overhead ventilation, most of what you can
 see is rotting away slowly, and the smell is atrocious. There is
 nothing useful in any of it.
    What does strike your attention is a small section of the floor
 where the debris has been cleared away.

 The ground is made of stone and covered with rotting detritus. One part
 of the floor, however, appears to be free of debris.

 You can't touch the floor.

 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in
 relation to the floor.

>open secret trapdoor
 [open secret trapdoor]
 You struggle to lift the metal plate, but finally manage to pull it
 away, whereupon it slams into the ground with a resounding metallic
 clang. You make a mental note to be quieter in your future
 explorations.
    The metal plate was hiding a dark passage that leads down by means
 of a rusty ladder, and an evil smell wafts up to greet you.

>go down
 You gingerly grasp the rungs of the ladder and climb down into the vile
 stench.


 Sewer
 The smell here is vile, making you gag. The sewer is a tall, round
 tunnel made from brick, and it lies in a generally east/west
 orientation. A thin stream of brown-coloured water flows towards the
 east, while in the west you can hear a faint splashing sound. The rungs
 of a rusty ladder are visible here, leading up to a dark hole above
 you.

 [ Sewer | Interlude as Lord Sulanar of Alallsia ]
>go west
 You move west.


 Sewer
 Three smaller sewer pipes enter here, one from the north, south and
 west, but they are far too small to follow. A small stream of
 brown-coloured water is gushing out of the northern pipe, splashing
 into the bottom of the main pipe you are in and flowing east, which
 appears to be the only exit. The smell here is extremely bad.

>go east
 You move east.

>go east

    Your hand twitches momentarily.


 Sewer
 The sewer passage comes to an end here at a large, metal grate in the
 floor, through which the brown stream of runoff is flowing. You can
 hear it splashing far below. The grate is damaged, though; a large hole
 has been punched through the centre. Blood is smeared across the walls
 of the tunnel here.

    Near the blood-spattered walls lies a similarly blood-spattered saw.

>examine saw
 The saw is a vicious, three-foot blade with jagged teeth. It is covered
 in dried blood.

>take saw
 You pick up the saw.

>examine grate
 The metal grate is thick and solid, but has been broken some time in
 the past, leaving a two-foot hole in the centre. How such a hole could
 have been made in such a solid piece of metal is a mystery.

>examine blood
 The blood is rust coloured, indicating it is reasonably fresh, perhaps
 a day or two old.
    As you look at the blood, you sense something odd about the walls
 the blood is smeared across.

>examine walls
 The walls are circular, around seven feet in diameter. What the walls
 consist of exactly is actually quite impossible to determine given the
 amount of muck that clings to them. You suspect they are made of brick,
 but who knows. There is a broad splattering of blood on the walls here.
    Something seems a little different about the southern wall, although
 you can't quite put your finger on it. It's like there is a thin,
 almost invisible veil of dust hovering in the air like a curtain just
 in front of the wall.

>examine dust
 You can hardly see it, and it seems to shift in and out of visibility
 almost at random. If you had to guess, you would estimate it to be
 about six feet high, and probably about three feet wide, but it is so
 hard to be sure.

>open secret door
 You consider attempting to open it, but in the end conclude there is no
 way to achieve it.

>kill veil
 [attack veil]
 You doubt that violence will have any impact on that.

>touch wall
 You can't touch the walls.

>touch dust
 You can't touch the dust.

>touch curtain
 You can't touch the dust.

>touch south wall
 A bizarre notion crosses your mind which you quickly dismiss as
 irrational.

>in
 You can't go in that direction, but you can move west.

>enter grate
 You have a closer look, but there doesn't appear to be any way to enter
 that.

>take grate
 After a brief analysis, you conclude the metal grate isn't something
 you can take.

>cut south wall
 You think about it, but that doesn't appear to be something you can
 cut.

>go south
 You attempt to step into the strange veil, but a powerful force pushes
 you back.

>stab veil
 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in
 relation to the dust.

 You consider trying to push the dust, but you can't imagine there being
 anything to gain by doing so.

>hold torch up to veil
 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in
 relation to the torch.

>examine hole
 The hole in the grate leads down to another level of the sewer, which
 would then ultimately flow into the nearby harbour.

>look down hole
 You look around briefly, but don't see anything here that fits that
 description.

 bright, green light, followed by a brief feeling of disorientation, and
 you find yourself in...


 A well appointed room
 A wide, low hearth in the west wall holds a brightly burning fire that
 gives warmth and light to the otherwise darkened room. Two comfortable
 looking chairs sit in front of the fire, both unoccupied, and between
 them is a small wooden table. Bookshelves line the walls of either side
 of the hearth, neatly filled with a library of volumes and scrolls
 beyond count. A large, deep cabinet is set against the northern wall,
 beside which is a desk that is covered in papers and assorted
 miscellany. The southern wall holds a door, which is currently closed.
 A rich carpet covers the floor from wall to wall, and most of the
 eastern wall is taken up with an enormous picture window.
    You notice that an area beside the window is shimmering slightly.

 If you had to guess, you would say the desk was made from mahogany. It
 is pushed up against the wall next to the cabinet.
    Spread across the surface of the table are a vast assortment of
 papers.

>read papers
 Most of what the papers say means nothing to you. There are mentions of
 different weights and volumes, some complex formula whose parameters
 appear to be random squiggles, and there are also sections talking
 about potency. Only one word stands out in all the documents and makes
 any sense at all - 'Ralyon'.

>take papers
 You take the assorted papers from the desk.
    As you move the papers around, you find a wax seal hidden underneath
 them.

 [ Your score just went up by one. ]

 The wax seal is of a type used for sealing scrolls and letters, usually
 by dripping hot wax on the edge of the scroll and then pressing the
 seal into it to imprint the image. The seal's image is of a hawk with
 wings outstretched.

 The dimensions of the cabinet are oversized in every way; height, width
 and depth. You imagine that half a dozen men could stand quite
 comfortably inside.  The cabinet door is currently closed.

 You take the wax seal from the desk.

 Lord Alsohn's body lies in a crumpled heap inside the cabinet,
 completely naked, although his legs have mercifully folded in a way
 that covers his private parts. His face is purple, evidently from
 strangulation, and is registering a look of horror, his mouth hanging
 open from his last attempt at breath. His eyes are open, which gives
 the lifeless body a macabre, chilling image. Aside from some contusions
 around his neck, you see no other signs of violence.

 scrolls.

 You look around briefly, but don't see anything here that fits that
 description.

>examine scrolls
 You can't determine what the scrolls might contain, but there are quite
 a number of them on the shelves, stacked in neat piles.

 The entire floor of the room is cover in a rich, thick carpet which
 feels soft to your feet. It's hard to determine the colour, but it
 looks to be a dark shade of burgundy.

>look under carpet
 You don't find anything of interest under that.

>read scrolls
 You select a scroll from the shelf and, ignoring the twitching of your
 hand, examine the contents. You are surprised to find that the entire
 length of the scroll is blank. Suspecting magic is at work, you roll up
 the scroll and replace it on the shelf.

>examine window
 The window provides a magnificent view over the city. Because night has
 fallen, at first you assume that it would be too hard to pin-point
 exactly where you are just by observation. But then you notice the
 curve of the bay to the east, which reveals the place where you are has
 some elevation, and with the light from the full moon overhead you are
 able to spot various landmarks in the city. This allows you to work out
 the precise location of the building you are in.

 [ Your score just went up by one. ]

>go east
 You move to step back through the strange veil of light, but are pushed
 back by a powerful force.
    Even as you try to comprehend the magical force preventing you from
 leaving, you hear footsteps in the corridor outside. A key rattles in
 the lock and then the door suddenly swings open.
    A man walks in. He is dressed entirely in black, although you notice
 a strange, blue amulet hanging around his neck, which is striking
 against the dark clothes. The man is younger than you expected. You
 estimate he could be no more than twenty-five years old, but the look
 in his eyes is ancient; cold and hard like stone, but weathered through
 untold experiences. You suppress a shiver and give the man your most
 imperious gaze.
    "Nice to meet you at last, Lord Sulanar," the man says without any
 hint of surprise, his voice smooth and clear. He has brought a candle
 with him which he sets on the small table between the two chairs,
 before turning back to face you.
    "A pleasure," you say coldly. "Although I don't recall having been
 introduced."
    The man gives you a surprisingly warm smile. "My deepest apologies.
 My name is Vetan. I assume you must be looking for something." He
 indicates the items in your hand. "Did you find it?"
    "Mostly," you reply evenly. "I came looking for Lord Alsohn, who I'm
 devastated to report I found in your cabinet, rather dead."
    "Ah, yes, poor Lord Alsohn," Vetan says sadly. "I'm afraid he didn't
 appreciate some of my questions. He took them quite personally, and for
 some reason he jumped to a variety of unwarranted conclusions about
 what I offered him." Vetan's voice conveys a certain amount of regret,
 but his eyes are unmoved. "He tried to attack me, and I was forced to
 kill him in self-defence."
    "Indeed," you say. "What was it that could have caused Lord Alsohn
 to overcome his well-renowned hatred of violence to attempt harm on
 your person?"
    The smallest smile curls the ends of Vetan's mouth. "Actually, I
 could run you through the things I talked with Lord Alsohn about, if
 you'd like," Vetan says. He moves around to stand in front of one of
 the chairs. "Why don't we sit down and have a chat?"

    I know he is lying, but right now that's probably the least of my
 concerns. While I don't want to stay, I sense that his pleasantly
 worded request is actually a veiled threat. I will sit. I will listen.
 But this may prove to be a very long night.

 Part Three: The Plan for Salvation

    It's been said that when disaster looms, God will provide. While I'm
 still struggling with the concept of God, I can't help but see some
 order in all that's happened to me. What I originally thought was just
 about me and the tragedy I was enduring has turned into something much
 bigger, with more than my own life at stake. Does this mean there is a
 God, and he has a plan that I'm part of? Does this give meaning to my
 suffering? I have no answer.
    No answer was what Master Limos gave me when I asked about where I
 would land in Ryla as a result of his wizardry. "Somewhere in the
 castle," was all he could tell me. Then he was gone, my final word of
 thanks unspoken on my now working lips, as he raised his arms and sent
 me on my magical journey. Colours and lights swirl around me now,
 almost blinding me in intensity, my destination only moments away.
    Somewhere in the castle is the answer, the stitch that joins all the
 threads together. I know that the king hasn't touched Alsanter's room
 since the murder, so there is a chance I can learn something that was
 previously overlooked. I have a chance to save the king, his daughter
 and Rixomas, to prove to the king my worthiness to be his ward, and
 maybe prove to Tevona my own love for her.

    The spectral display of light vanishes, and you find yourself
 standing on your feet.



 Eastern end of the castle gardens
 The darkness of night does not hide your location from your vulpine
 eyesight. The castle gardens surround you, row upon row of neatly
 arranged vegetables and herbs laid out between cobblestone walkways
 that continue towards the west. A doorway into a small shed lies to the
 east, the entrance permanently open as the door was removed long ago.
 The main castle lies to the north, accessible here through a small door
 that opens onto the garden. The limits of the garden are marked by the
 high, stone ramparts of the castle wall that you can see to the east
 and south, silhouetted against the black curtain of the night sky.

 The darkness is deeper here in the confines of the shed, but still you
 have reasonable vision thanks to your fox abilities and the vague,
 night-time light that is seeping in through the doorway to the west.
 Tools are various kinds are hanging on the northern and southern walls,
 neatly arranged in functional groups. A wide workbench stands against
 the eastern wall, but it is too high to see on top of.


    Leaning up against the bench nearby is a long-handled spade.

>call a spade a spade

 The game is now in its verbose mode, which always gives long
 descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>examine

 Garden shed
 The darkness is deeper here in the confines of the shed, but still you
 have reasonable vision thanks to your fox abilities and the vague,
 night-time light that is seeping in through the doorway to the west.
 Tools are various kinds are hanging on the northern and southern walls,
 neatly arranged in functional groups. A wide workbench stands against
 the eastern wall, but it is too high to see on top of.


    Leaning up against the bench nearby is a long-handled spade.

>examine spade
 The spade has a long, wooden handle and a metal blade. Given the marks
 along the handle and blade it appears to have been worked hard.
    It looks like you would be able to drag it, although it would make a
 lot of noise on the cobblestones.

 You can't carry anything in your current condition.

>go west
 You trot west.

 Eastern end of the castle gardens
 The darkness of night does not hide your location from your vulpine
 eyesight. The castle gardens surround you, row upon row of neatly
 arranged vegetables and herbs laid out between cobblestone walkways
 that continue towards the west. A doorway into a small shed lies to the
 east, the entrance permanently open as the door was removed long ago.
 The main castle lies to the north, accessible here through a small door
 that opens onto the garden. The limits of the garden are marked by the
 high, stone ramparts of the castle wall that you can see to the east
 and south, silhouetted against the black curtain of the night sky.

>go west
 You trot west.

 Western end of the castle gardens
 The neat rows of vegetables and herbs end here against the solid,
 imposing walls of the castle that rise up to the east and south. The
 castle stands to the north, but you can't see any entry points from
 here. You can make out the shadows of some windows high up in the
 walls, but they are well out of reach. Your only option for movement is
 back to the east.
    Piled against the base of the castle wall is a large mound of what
 could only be described as rubbish.

 [ Western end of the castle gardens | Part Three as Torrin, a small red
 fox ]
>examine rubbish
 It's mostly made up of kitchen waste, dumped here possibly with the
 idea of turning it into compost. That idea hasn't been developed very
 far, you think, given the general neglect the pile has been subjected
 to. It is shabby and sprawling, giving off a powerful aroma which is
 mostly unpleasant.
    The only thing that catches your eye is the corner of some sort of
 material that is protruding from the mound of rubbish.

>examine material
 There's not much to see at present. It's only about two inches in size,
 so it's hard to determine what it might be. You gauge that you could
 probably dig it out.

>pull material
 You consider trying to pull the corner of material, but you can't
 imagine there being anything to gain by doing so.

>dig material
 You dig around in the pile of rubbish, and fully uncover the material
 which you can now see is an old sack.

 [ Your score just went up by one. ]

 There is no need to smell any particular item. You can use your
 enhanced, vulpine sense of smell in each location - if you detect
 anything unusual or noteworthy with your olfactory senses, you can then
 examine the item for more information.

>go north
 The gap between the door and the jam is too small to allow you to pass
 through.

>examine door
 The door is quite small and sturdy, and would probably require some
 people who pass through it to duck their heads. While it looks closed
 at the moment, you notice that it hasn't quite closed properly. There's
 a narrow gap between door and the jam.

>examine gap
 The gap between the door and the jam is very narrow, about half an inch
 wide.

>stick paw under gap
 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in

>examine herbs
 There are a variety of herbs you can see and smell in the garden beds;
 mint, thyme, and rosemary being the predominant ones.

 here.

 Small vestibule
 This is little more than a convenience for the kitchen helpers who need

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is a mammoth room, luridly lit by the red, glowing embers
 of a fire that still smoulders in the wide hearth in the southern wall.
 The centre of the room is dominated by a long wooden workbench, over
 which are hanging an array of cooking implements; pots, pans, knives
 and spoons. Cupboards cover almost the entire northern wall, except for
 a small section where the stonework is visible, and in that brief space
 you notice a small hole in the wall, just above the floor.
    Mounted on the wall beside the hearth is a simple shelf that
 operates as a spice rack, where a number of jars and containers are
 stored.
    There is a narrow passage visible to the east, while a door to the
 west stands open.

    A long-handled broom is leaning up against the side of the hearth,
 next to the spice rack.

    A large, hairy dog lies on the floor just inside the western door,
 sleeping.
    The dog sneezes a couple of times, whimpers, then settles down
 again.

 [ Kitchen | Part Three as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>examine dog
 The dog is a shaggy-haired thing of uncertain breed. His coat is rather
 matted and soiled. He is sleeping somewhat fitfully just inside the
 kitchen door.

>examine spice rack
 The spice rack is just a simple wooden shelf attached to the wall
 beside the fire, about three feet off the ground. You notice that the
 shelf appears to be on a slight angle, as if the fastening is loose.
 Some jars of spices are on the spice rack.

>examine broom
 The broom has a long, wooden handle and thick, coarse bristles. It is
 currently standing up against the wall, next to the fireplace, beside
 the spice rack.

>push broom
 You push against the broom with your paws and send it skating across
 the wall on a short journey to the ground. On the way down it rakes
 across the spice rack, sending all the jars tumbling to the ground
 where they smash in a spectacular display of coloured spices and
 shattered glass.
    A draft from the chimney briefly stirs the powdery spices into a
 small eddy, but slowly everything settles to stillness.
    The dog stirs briefly at the noise, but does not wake up.

>examine spices
 Please be more clear, what do you want to examine?  The smashed jars of
 spices or the mound of spices?
    A low growl comes from the dog lying nearby. You see his feet
 twitching, then he falls still again.

>examine mound
 The spices lie in a pile on the smashed remains of the jars that
 previously contained them. They are all mixed together in a way that
 would be impossible to separate.
    An occasional draft of wind from the nearby fireplace lifts up some
 of the spice into an colourful eddy, but otherwise they lie still.

    You hear a swishing sound, and notice the dog's tail is swinging
 back and forth across the floor. After a few moments he becomes still
 again.

 You edge forward carefully, attempting to slip past the dog unnoticed.
 It's when you are closest to him that he lifts his head and sniffs the
 air vigourously. You stare at him apprehensively.
    Then his eyes open. For a moment your eyes meet.
    With a yelp you jump away, but the pursuit doesn't last long.
 However quick you are, the dog is too large and too close to escape
 from. The end comes mercifully quickly, your neck lost in the massive
 jaws of the dog.

 He stands, and starts growing at you, even though he can't actually see
 you. But he is now filling the doorway, and you can't see any way past
 him.
    You back away slowly, silently. As your scent fades, you see the dog
 relax somewhat and lie down again. He shuts his eyes and returns to his
 fitful sleep.

 Bottom of the stairway
 A grand marble stairway rises up before you, lit by a couple of flaming
 torches mounted on the walls. On the western wall between the torches
 is a massive shield into which has been pressed the coat of arms of the
 king of Rylane.
    There are two doors here; a rather ornate one in the northern wall
 leads towards the throne room but the door is closed. The other door in
 the eastern wall leads to the kitchen, and is currently standing open.

 The shield is massive, having always been intended as a decoration
 rather than for protection. The emblem of the king of Rylane, a dragon

 metal, and in the flickering torchlight the image almost seems alive as
 shadows dance over its surface.

 The portrait of the king is simple, in that there is no background
 detail at all, just a plain black backdrop. There is a sadness to his
 expression, while still being regal. You remember being told this
 portrait was commissioned soon after he took the throne, just as the
 war with Gord was commencing.

    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- movement to the south.

>open door
 You push against the door with your paws and it swings open suddenly,
 banging into the wall with a resounding thud. Light from within the
 room floods out into the corridor, before it is blocked somewhat by the
 sudden appearance of Lord Vonisor in the doorway. On seeing you he
 leaps back and draws his sword.
    "Wait, Lord Vonisor," you say. "It's me. Torrin."
    Vonisor's eyes widen as he takes in the marvel of words coming from
 the mouth of a fox.
    "Torrin?" he asks. "Is it really you?"
    "Yes, it's really me," you reply. "I had some help from another
 wizard and now I can talk."
    Vonisor looks up and down the corridor for a moment in confusion.
 "But what are you doing here? If any of the guards find you here you'll
 get killed on sight."
    "I need to find out who the real murderer of Prince Alsanter is,"
 you reply, "because I think they're linked to the sudden reappearance
 of Ralyon warriors in Rylane."
    "What?!" Vonisor gasps. "No! They were destroyed!"
    "Someone has brought them back," you say. "But I need your help. I
 need to look for evidence that might have been overlooked before in the
 investigation into the death of Prince Alsanter. Hopefully the answers
 will reveal who is behind the plot."
    Vonisor puts his hand to his sword hilt. "If there is a threat to
 the kingdom I am yours to command. I will be your hands and feet."
    He dashes into his room and returns with a lit candle, before
 closing the door behind him.

 canopy over the bed is perfectly straight, the bed equally neat, as are

 Lady Hallyn's rooms
 The light from the candle might be soft, but something about the way
 Lady Hallyn has furnished her rooms has a certain softness to it. There
 is the delicate, rose-coloured canopy over the bed, a sheer fabric with
 a rose pattern woven into it. On the bed is a lace coverlet with
 intricate flower patterns that falls to the floor on all sides. The
 chairs before the empty fireplace have a rose motif embroidered into
 the cushions. Even the curtains that cover the window in the southern
 wall are a soft, rose colour.
    On the eastern wall above the fireplace is a painting of a family
 group.
    The door back to the corridor stands open to the north.

 Lady Edukam's rooms
 Your eyes are assaulted by the sheer amount of stuff Lady Edukam has
 managed to cram into her rooms. The bed is the only article of
 furniture that is easily accessible, the canopy hanging down in
 elegant, lavender streams. Curtains mark out the position of the window
 in the southern wall, but the rest of the wall is taken up with a large
 wardrobe and chest of drawers. On top of the drawers are a number of
 small ornaments. A dresser sits against the northern wall beside the
 door, and is covered with bottles of perfume, the mirror in the dresser
 reflecting the candle held by Lord Vonisor. Two chairs near the
 fireplace rest on a peach-coloured rug, and over the back of one of the
 chairs a dress of deepest violet has been draped.
    Amid all the furniture, restricting movement in the room, are
 various boxes, piles of books and papers, and one or two mounds of
 clothes.
    The door back to the corridor stands open to the north.

    Standing a short distance away is Lord Vonisor, who is looking at
 you but is obviously ready for anything.
    Lord Vonisor rubs the back of his head impatiently.

 [ Lady Edukam's rooms | Part Three as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>examine boxes
 There are several boxes located all around the room at various points
 in a very haphazard way. All made from rough, untreated wood, they are
 also all shut securely, making it impossible to determine their
 contents.

>examine bed
 The bed looks a little firm, from what you can see under the canopy.

>open canopy
 You consider attempting to open it, but in the end conclude there is no
 way to achieve it.

>open boxes
 "Lord Vonisor," you begin, "can you open some of these boxes for me?"
    Lord Vonisor looks at the boxes for a moment before shaking his
 head. "They're all sealed pretty securely," he says. "I don't think I
 have the tools to open them."
    Lord Vonisor fiddles with his sword hilt.

>smell
 There is a faint smell of burnt wood coming from the hearth, which is
 largely overpowered by a very strong note of perfume.

>examine books
 There are a few piles of books in seemingly random locations in the
 room. None of the titles hold much interest to you, though.

>examine papers
 The piles of papers are interspersed between the books and furniture in
 a completely random fashion. From what you can see the papers are
 reports from nobles in Lestum, and all are of a mundane nature.

>examine dress
 Made from satin, the dress looks to have been skillfully tailored.

>open box with sword
 "Lord Vonisor," you begin, "can you open some of these boxes for me?"
    Lord Vonisor looks at the boxes for a moment before shaking his
 head. "They're all sealed pretty securely," he says. "I don't think I
 have the tools to open them."

>cut boxes with sword
 You think about it, but that doesn't appear to be something you can
 cut.

>open dresser
 You consider attempting to open it, but in the end conclude there is no
 way to achieve it.

>open chest
 You consider attempting to open it, but in the end conclude there is no
 way to achieve it.

>open wardrobe
 "Lord Vonisor," you begin, "can you open the wardrobe for me?"
    Lord Vonisor steps forward and tries both the doors, but they refuse
 to open.
    "I believe the doors are locked," he says.
    Lord Vonisor crosses his arms and sighs deeply as he looks at you.

>look

 Lady Edukam's rooms
 Your eyes are assaulted by the sheer amount of stuff Lady Edukam has
 managed to cram into her rooms. The bed is the only article of
 furniture that is easily accessible, the canopy hanging down in
 elegant, lavender streams. Curtains mark out the position of the window
 in the southern wall, but the rest of the wall is taken up with a large
 wardrobe and chest of drawers. On top of the drawers are a number of
 small ornaments. A dresser sits against the northern wall beside the
 door, and is covered with bottles of perfume, the mirror in the dresser
 reflecting the candle held by Lord Vonisor. Two chairs near the
 fireplace rest on a peach-coloured rug, and over the back of one of the
 chairs a dress of deepest violet has been draped.
    Amid all the furniture, restricting movement in the room, are
 various boxes, piles of books and papers, and one or two mounds of
 clothes.
    The door back to the corridor stands open to the north.

    Lord Vonisor is standing nearby, with a determination in his stance
 as if he is ready to attack the first enemy to come into view.

 Corridor outside Lady Edukam's rooms
 A long dark corridor stretches away to the east and west, with occasion
 pools of light provided by a series of torches mounted on the wall. On
 the floor on polished stone, running the entire length of the corridor,
 is a plush carpet. There is just sufficient light to see the door to
 Lady Edukam's rooms in the southern wall, while a banner in the colours
 of the region of Lestum hangs on the opposite wall.

    Lord Vonisor enters from the south.

>open door
 "My lord," you say, "would you open this door?"
    Lord Sulanar looks at you with a confused expression. "I know you
 want to investigate the murder, but how will you explain your presence
 to Lord Reken if I open the door with you here?"
    You smile at him, which looks strange for a fox. "Actually, I can
 make myself invisible," you reply.
    "Really? That's incredible," he replies. "Well, I can knock on the
 door and bring Lord Reken here, which should give you time to have a
 quick look in his rooms."
    "Timing is everything," you say. "I'm ready."
    "Very well," Lord Vonisor says. He steps forward and knocks on the
 door.

    Lord Vonisor pulls out his sword and checks the blade for any marks

    The door opens abruptly and Lord Reken emerges. Dressed in a grey

 you saw him at your trial.
    "Good evening, Lord Vonisor," he says. "What a pleasant surprise.
 What can I do for you?"
    "I wanted to take about some news from Lamiek with you," Lord
 Vonisor says. The discussion doesn't look like it will take long.

 Lord Reken looks older than when you last saw him in the throne room
 during your trial. He is dressed in a simple grey tunic over which he

 Lord Reken's rooms
 A suit of armour in the far corner stands watch over Lord Reken's room,
 like a soldier on guard duty. The rest of the room is quite
 utilitarian, with the canopied bed, the chairs before the brightly
 burning fire in the hearth in the western wall, even the rug on the
 floor not bearing any artistic elements. If they have any colour at
 all, they are all a uniform grey. The curtains over the window in the
 southern wall have the only colour in the room, a pale green.

 Lord Gaxin's rooms
 A large, canopied bed is the dominant feature in Lord Gaxin's rooms,
 being the largest item of furniture visible. It occupies space against
 the eastern wall. The southern wall is taken up with long, deep blue

 The light from the candle might be soft, but something about the way
 Lady Hallyn has furnished her rooms has a certain softness to it. There
 is the delicate, rose-coloured canopy over the bed, a sheer fabric with
 a rose pattern woven into it. On the bed is a lace coverlet with
 intricate flower patterns that falls to the floor on all sides. The
 chairs before the empty fireplace have a rose motif embroidered into
 the cushions. Even the curtains that cover the window in the southern
 wall are a soft, rose colour.
    On the eastern wall above the fireplace is a painting of a family
 group.

 candle held by Lord Vonisor to reveal a tidy and uncluttered room. The
 canopy over the bed is perfectly straight, the bed equally neat, as are

 the floor on polished stone, running the entire length of the corridor,
 is a plush carpet. There is just sufficient light to see the door to
 Lord Sulanar's rooms in the southern wall, while a banner in the
 colours of the region of Alallsia hangs on the opposite wall.

 As you move to enter the door, Lord Vonisor steps forward and says, "It

 into the room ahead of you.


 Lord Adath's rooms
 The flickering light of the candle held by Lord Vonisor doesn't hide
 the richness of the appointments of Lord Adath's rooms. A plush carpet
 covers the floor, matching beautifully with the velvet curtains across
 the window and the canopy over the bed. Two luxurious armchairs are
 positioned in front of the empty fireplace in the eastern wall, while a
 broad desk of carved wood sits in front window in the southern wall.
 The door back to the corridor is to the north, and is currently open.

    Lord Vonisor stands close by, his hand on the hilt of his sword,
 ready for action.

 Rixomas' rooms
 The wizard Rixomas preferred to keep his rooms as bare as possible. A
 hearth in the western wall contains a brightly burning fire, but it is
 the only bright thing in the room. The two chairs standing before the
 fire are basic, and the rug on the floor is a drab olive colour. The
 window in the southern wall is hidden by long, grey drapes.
    A bed stands against the eastern wall, and in it you can see the
 pallid figure of Rixomas lying almost motionless beneath the covers.
    The door to the north stands open.

    Lord Vonisor enters from the north.

 "Lord Vonisor," you say, "could you open the curtains here?"
    Lord Vonisor considers this for a moment before answering. "Very

    He steps forward and flings the curtains back, revealing the window
 behind them. The window itself is closed, and holds only a view of the
 blackness of night outside. You look carefully at the window but don't
 see anything noteworthy.

 more.

 You move forward as if to enter the northern archway, but Lord Vonisor

    "It might not be a great idea to expose yourself to the guards at

    Lord Vonisor disappears through the archway, and you hear a brief
 discussion. Then you hear the sound of feet marching away. Lord Vonisor
 reappears through archway and comes to stand near you.
    "All clear," he says simply. "I was just thinking that we're going
 to run into more people the further we go, and I won't always be able
 to remove them like that."
    "What are you suggesting, my lord?" you ask.
    "You might need a way to signal me without alerting anyone nearby."
    "Good idea," you respond. "Perhaps I could wink at you?"
    Lord Vonisor considers this for a moment, then nods. "Yes, that
 would work. Just make sure you do it at me, otherwise I might not see
 it." He spreads his arm towards the northern archway. "After you."
    You trot northwards through the archway.

 Prince Alsanter's rooms
 A thick layer of dust covers everything in this place where you last
 saw Prince Alsanter alive. A standard table of unremarkable size stands
 in the centre of the room, on top of which is a cup. To the left, in
 front of a wide, empty hearth, is a chair of leather and wood that
 speaks of comfort, with an embroidered pillow lying on the floor beside
 it. There is a window in the far wall with curtains drawn.
    In the centre of the room, spread on the floor, is a large, circular
 rug of rich green which has been spoiled by a dark, sinister stain near
 the edge.
     A passage leads westwards, while the door back to the corridor
 stands open to the south.

    Lord Vonisor is standing nearby, with a determination in his stance
 as if he is ready to attack the first enemy to come into view.

 [ Prince Alsanter's rooms | Part Three as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>smell
 You can smell a faint, but very distinct odour here, past the mustiness
 that comes from two months of collected dust. It's a floral smell, like
 roses but with a sickly tinge to it. The source of the odour appears to
 be the cup on the table.
    As you contemplate what the smell might mean, you hear a door open
 out in the corridor close by. Then you hear the sound of feet walking
 along the corridor, muted somewhat by the carpet. The sound retreats
 into the distance, then disappears altogether.

>examine pillow
 You remember the pillow was a gift to Prince Alsanter from his mother,
 Queen Felna, around the time you moved into the castle. Alsanter always
 had it in his rooms. The embroidery depicts a forest scene with a small
 stream and a deer looking back over its shoulder. The pillow lies on
 the ground beside the chair, covered in dust.

 now."
    "Oh!" Lord Vonisor looks surprised. He still seems hesitant as he
 steps up to the door and knocks on it gently. When there is no answer
 he opens it very carefully and peers inside.

 Princess Tevona's rooms
 A fire burns low in the hearth in the western wall, sending shadows
 leaping around the room. Two chairs are positioned in front of the
 fire, while a more spacious lounge is positioned on the far side of a
 low table. A carpet of a delicate rose hue covers much of the floor.
    In the northern wall some curtains hide a wide window, next to which
 one of the castle buttresses extends into the room somewhat.
    Besides the doorway to the south, which is open, the other exit is
 through a passage to the west.

    Lord Vonisor enters from the south.

 [ Princess Tevona's rooms | Part Three as Torrin, a small red fox ]
>smell
 You can smell a couple of distinct odours here. There is a floral-like
 smell, almost like the smell of a rose in bloom, but with a sickly edge
 to it that feels wrong. And there is another strange smell, an acrid,
 burnt smell but not from the fire. Both seem to be coming from the
 buttress that rises up beside the window.

>examine buttress
 The buttress is made from the same stone as the walls, but its
 additional thickness breaks up the smooth line of the wall. It's about
 four feet wide, running from floor to ceiling, and extends about six
 inches into the room.
    However, the odours that you detect in the room draw your attention
 to the buttress, and as you look closer your vulpine eyes notice a
 small indentation in the corner where the buttress meets the wall.
 Something about this mark looks alien, out of place.

>examine indentation
 The indentation is almost invisible, blending into the surrounding
 stonework perfectly.

    Lord Vonisor considers this for a moment before answering. "Very

    He steps forward and flings the curtains back, revealing the window

    "Thank you," you say. Lord Vonisor nods and draws the curtains once

>pry indentation with sword
 [lever indentation with sword]
 A strange notion comes to your mind, but it doesn't make much sense in
 relation to the indentation.

>push indentation
 "Lord Vonisor," you say, "can you see that small indentation in the
 wall there, near the buttress?"
    Vonisor comes close and bends to examine the artefact. "Yes, I think
 I can see it."
    "It might be a catch or something," you respond. "Do you think you
 can press it?"
    Lord Vonisor stretches out his hand and presses the mark in the
 corner of the wall. Suddenly a crack appears in the wall, in the area
 you thought was just a buttress, which expands into a narrow door that
 swings slowly open. Vonisor's eyes widen as he looks into the small
 cabinet that the hidden door has revealed.
    "This is bad," he says. "There are bottles of poison here, one of
 which I know of. It's designed to kill people slowly, usually by
 administering small doses over a long period of time. Like with
 Rixomas."
    "I can smell a bottle that has the same aroma as the cup in Prince
 Alsanter's rooms," you add. You sniff the air again. "I think it's that
 one on the left."
    Lord Vonisor picks up the bottle. "It's some type of narcotic, I
 think."
    "That would mean..." you begin, but your voice trails off as the
 implications sink in.
    "It certainly explains why there weren't any signs of a struggle in
 Prince Alsanter's bedroom."
    "Anything else?" you ask.
    Before he can answer there is a sound in the corridor and Princess
 Tevona walks in through the open door, a servant girl with arms full of
 firewood following close behind. Tevona stops immediately when she sees
 that her room is occupied, and her mouth drops open when she sees who
 it is who has invaded her privacy.
    She recovers slightly and turns to the servant girl. "Leave us.
 Bring the wood later."
    The servant girl leaves and the room descends into silence.

>wink at vonisor
 As surreptitiously as you can, you look up at Lord Vonisor and catch
 his eye. You wink at him and see him wink back at you.

    Tevona's eyes pass from the trespassers to the open door of the
 cabinet behind you, then to the vials and jars clearly visible on the
 shelves within. And her eyes harden.
    "Princess Tevona," Lord Vonisor says with an official tone you've
 never heard him use before, "Perhaps you'd like to explain the contents
 of this cabinet we've found here."
    "I have nothing to explain," the princess declares with a shake of
 her head. "Get out. These are my rooms and you have stepped beyond your
 authority to come in here."
    "Actually, I am well within my authority to investigate this,"
 Vonisor responds, putting the candlestick down on the table. "No
 position is above the law when crimes have been committed."

>talk to tevona
 Lord Vonisor is too involved in the drama playing out before you to be
 able to answer any questions.

    "I have nothing to say to you," Tevona replies, but you aren't sure
 to whom she is referring. "You can't do anything to me. I'm the
 Princess of Rylane."
    "That's not going to make any difference," Vonisor replies. "You're
 in a lot of trouble. The evidence we've uncovered tonight means you'll
 be standing trial for the death of your brother, as well as the
 attempted murder of the wizard Rixomas."

 that.

>examine cabinet
 The cabinet has been carved into the bulk of the buttress, although
 it's impossible to tell when this might have occurred. The shelves
 within are not deep, only a couple of inches at most. You can see a
 number of vials and jars on the shelves, but from your position you
 can't make out any of the labels.

>smell
 You can smell a couple of distinct odours here. There is a floral-like

 buttress that rises up beside the window.
    You feel a change, and notice you have become visible again.

    You see Tevona reach up to her neckline, as if in shock or alarm,
 but too late you realise the action is not reflexive. She flips out a
 small amulet from within her bodice and grips it in her hands.
    "Guards!" Vonisor yells, drawing his sword.
    There is a bright flash and a clap of thunder, and you find yourself
 lying on the floor at the far end of the room. You scramble to your
 feet, and find yourself staring at a black robed man.
    Vetan.

 As surreptitiously as you can, you look up at Lord Vonisor and catch

    Vonisor leaps to his feet. "Who are you?" he asks.
    "A pleasure to meet you, my lord Vonisor," Vetan replies. Tevona is
 smiling evilly from behind him. "My name is Vetan, and I'm taking over
 the kingdom."

 "Ha!" Vetan yells, raising his hand above his head. You feel a change
 and suddenly notice you are visible again.
    "I know you were thinking of trying something," Vetan declares. "But

    With a wave of his hand you hurtle towards the window, ripping
 through the curtains and exploding through the glass behind. The
 darkness of night surrounds you as you are flung higher and higher into
 the sky, the land below you spotted with an occasional light.

    There is a sudden commotion at the door as two guards burst in,
 followed quickly by King Rithusar. The guards take in the situation
 immediately and rush Vetan, their blades swinging. But a single gesture
 from Vetan sends the two guards hurtling towards the far wall where
 they smash sickeningly into the stonework and crumple to the ground in
 a bloody, pulpy mess.

>wait
 You wait for something to happen.

    You see King Rithusar's eyes flicker across the secret cabinet, and
 then come back to Tevona.
    "Tevona, who is this and what is going on?" he asks.
    "Allow me to explain," Vetan breaks in, "Your daughter has invited
 me here to right some long-standing wrongs that have been perpetrated
 against myself and my people. I am Vetan, son of Horalas, and I am
 taking the kingdom of Rylane away from you."

    You can see Rithusar is struggling to comprehend. "Horalas?"
    "Yes. My father, King Horalas of Gord, the man you defeated so
 famously in battle some ten years ago. Is any of this coming back to
 you?"
    "No," Rithusar shakes his head, disbelieving. "Horalas died
 childless. All the courtiers I asked said so."
    "They lied," Vetan replies with a brief flicker of a smile. "They
 were told to in order to hide me. You killed my father, reduced the
 kingdom of Gord to a protectorate, and then took this worthless churl
 of a boy into your home as your ward. But I must say, he makes a great
 fox. In any case, I've come back to take it all away from you, the same
 way you took it all away from me."

    "Your father started the war with us," Rithusar responds, his voice
 strong and unwavering. "He murdered my father, and tried to murder me."
    "I don't care what my father did to you," Vetan says, a grim
 bitterness in his voice. "I'm talking about what you did to me. I loved
 my father, and I was destined for the throne of Gord. I was the heir.
 And although I can't get my father back, I will be king again."

>wait
 You wait for something to happen.

    Lord Vonisor steps in. "Killing the king won't give you the kingdom.
 There will be revolt in all the regions of Rylane to avenge Rithusar's
 death."
    "Even if I marry the king's only surviving heir?" Vetan asks. "Oh,
 I'm sure there might be a few detractors who might be suspicious, but I
 suspect they might be less keen about fighting when they are confronted
 with a few legions of Ralyon warriors I have strategically placed
 around the kingdom."
    You see Rithusar's face blanch.

    "You still haven't explained where my daughter fits into all this,"
 Rithusar says.
    "Haven't you figured it out yet?" Vetan sneers. "Your daughter has
 been working for me! She killed Alsanter and framed Torrin, very
 cleverly removing two heirs to the throne in one move. She has been
 providing me with wonderful insights into the court of Rylane for, oh,
 almost two years now. And she has also helped dispose of all the
 magical forces that might have been opposed to me. Like Rixomas."

    Rithusar's face is stricken. "Tevona?" he asks.
    "Don't look at me like that, father," Tevona says. "I'm sick of the
 lip service you pay to being a father. You have never been a father to
 me. You gave us everything we could ever want because you didn't want
 to actually love us in a real way. You were always busy being king, and
 were always more concerned about looking after the needs of the kingdom
 than with looking after your own children."
    You sense that Vetan's attention has left you completely.

>wink at vonisor
 As surreptitiously as you can, you look up at Lord Vonisor and catch
 his eye. You wink at him and see him wink back at you.


    "I'm sure there is much to discuss," Vetan interjects unexpectedly,
 "but I'm trying to overthrow a kingdom and there's much yet to do." He
 turns to look at you directly. "And some of my jobs give me immense
 satisfaction," he says softly, menacingly. "Don't take this personally,
 but I've grown tired of your meddling. Your involvement in this saga is
 now finished."
    The room tilts as you suddenly find yourself floating above the
 floor.
    "Goodbye, Torrin," Vetan says.
    With a wave of his hand you hurtle towards the window, ripping
 through the curtains and exploding through the glass behind. The
 darkness of night surrounds you as you are flung higher and higher into
 the sky, the land below you spotted with an occasional light.
    You have no idea how far up you have gone when the force of your
 upward travel is expended and you begin to plummet towards the ground.
 Faster, faster, wind rushing in your ears, a violent death only moments
 away.

    Tevona...

 You have died, having achieved a score of 63 out of a possible 101.
 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE, UNDO a turn, or QUIT?

>invisible
 You think about invisibility, and immediately you disappear.
    There is an audible gasp from those around you as you disappear from
 sight.

>attack vetan
 Leaping forward, you rush at Vetan's legs and sink your teeth into the
 flesh of his calf, drawing blood. Vetan cries out in pain and lashes
 out at you with his other leg, catching you in the hind quarters and
 spinning you away. You smash into the wall, and you belatedly realise
 you have become visible again. Vonisor has reacted, though, drawing his
 sword and jumping in close. With a deft thrust he stabs Vetan through
 the chest.
    Vetan staggers back, groaning, then reaches up and grabs the amulet
 around his neck.
    "Vetan!" Tevona cries out as she despairingly tries to reach Vetan
 before he vanishes, but she is too late. There is another bright green
 flash and Vetan disappears. Tevona falls to the ground where Vetan had
 once been and starts to wail.

>wait
 You wait for something to happen.

    "I'd better see if I can find a cure for Rixomas," Lord Vonisor
 says, sheathing his sword. He scans the jars and vials in the cabinet
 for a few minutes, before selecting one. "This should do it," he says,
 then departs hurriedly through the door to the south.

>go south
 You trot south.

 Corridor outside Princess Tevona's rooms
 A long dark corridor stretches away to the east and west, with occasion
 pools of light provided by a series of torches mounted on the wall. On
 the floor of polished stone, running the entire length of the corridor,
 is a plush carpet. There is a door in the northern wall which you know
 to be the entrance to Prince Tevona's rooms. Mounted on the southern
 wall is a plaque featuring the emblem of the crown princess of Rylane.
    Your vulpine hearing detects some sounds -- movement to the north.

 The broad sweep of the marble stairway ends here at a surprisingly

 walls, provide exits, other than the stairs that lead back down.

    Lord Vonisor [lordfindsplayer=Bottom of the stairs].
    "Torrin, I found you," he says with a broad grin. "Rixomas is
 recovering, the antidote worked! It might take him a couple of days to
 recover, but it won't be long until you're uncursed!"
    "Thank you, Lord Vonisor," you reply, "for all your help."
    "Any time," he replies before heading away and leaving you on your
 own, deep in thought about the future.

 Epilogue

    As I stand at the bottom of the stairs that lead up to the
 battlements, I am both dreading and desiring this meeting. It's been
 almost a week since I had Tevona arrested for her brother's murder, and
 since Rixomas lifted the curse on Torrin, returning him to human form.
 In the intervening time I've hardly had a moment to myself, as dozens
 of reports of Ralyon warrior incidents seemed to arrive all at once.
 Murders in Lamiek, civil unrest in Grithim, almost a revolt in Drekas.
 We still don't know where these creatures are staging from, which means
 there could be months of these scattered incidents and fruitless
 searching ahead. On top of all this, I also have concerns about the
 whereabouts of Lord Sulanar, as his own people have not seen or heard
 from him in some time.
    But for now I can breathe, and I knew I had to seek out Torrin.
    I am king, but at the moment I feel like a fool and a failure. I am
 carrying a weight of grief and sadness I didn't know could be borne. My
 emotions threaten to overwhelm me, and I don't know if I can stop them.
 And in a few days I will be presiding over the trial of my daughter, a
 formality that will have to result in... I can't even say it. However
 much I love my daughter, I can't arrange for her escape. I can't do
 what I did for Torrin again. It won't be allowed by anyone.
    There is so much pain and despair, so much hopelessness to be
 overcome in my own life. I need to walk up these stairs and talk with
 Torrin. I need to find hope, to communicate hope to him, to reach out
 to him in some way. I don't know if I can, or if he is willing.
    But I have to try.



 Bottom of the stairs
 A narrow passage bends around from east to south, the low stone ceiling
 making this access corridor feel closed in and oppressive. There are
 one or two torches mounted on the walls providing light to the
 otherwise dark passage. A narrow, winding stairway leads upwards.

>SAVE
>cf49
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>inventory
 You are wearing the king's crown and the silver tunic, and you are
 carrying nothing.

>examine me
 You are King Rithusar, sovereign of the land of Rylane. You are wearing
 a silver tunic, and on your head you is your crown.

>go down
 You can't go in that direction, but you can move east, south and up.

>go up
 You climb up the winding stairway leading up from the corridor and exit
 through the doorway at the top.
    It is cold with the coming winter, but a magnificent sunset is
 glowing in the western sky, turning the scattered clouds bronze and
 gold. From the western horizon the rose sky fades to indigo in the east
 in a beautiful gradient of colour that spans almost every hue.
 Sunlight, like shards of crystal, break out between the clouds and
 strike the landscape with a soft caress.


 Battlements
 The stone battlements around you are familiar; you have walked these
 paths every day in your role as king, and know almost every stone that
 forms the parapets and crenels along the wall, or the marks in the
 stones that form the walkway. Here at the northern end there is a door
 that leads back down to the access corridor, while the battlements
 continue to the south. The castle courtyard is visible below, lit with
 the fading light of the sun.

    Standing next to a nearby parapet is Torrin, son of Bradda.

    As you walk through the door that leads onto the walkway you see
 Tholin the priest disappearing through the door at the opposite end,
 leaning heavily on his walking stick as he does so.   Torrin bows, then
 looks at you expectantly.

 [ Battlements | Epilogue as King Rithusar of Rylane ]
>topics
 You believe that Torrin might be willing to discuss some of the
 following things:
    Himself
    Tholin

>himself
 "How are you?" you ask with sincerity.
    "I'm fine, your Majesty," Torrin replies.
    You smile. "A patent lie," you say. "Not very convincing."
    You are rewarded to see the smallest part of a smile break on
 Torrin's face. "I'm coping," he allows. "This last few months, being
 cursed and my journey through the animal kingdom, has changed me in
 more ways I care to count."
    "I understand," you respond. "No ill effects from your
 transformation?"
    "No," Torrin says, shaking his head. "Everything worked perfectly."

>tholin
 "What were you and Tholin talking about?" you ask, in what you hope is
 a friendly tone.
    "Actually, Sire," Torrin replies, "we were talking about God."

>god
 "God?" you ask.
    "Well, your Majesty," Torrin begins, "when I was convicted of
 killing Alsanter, I thought it was unfair. At most I thought that, if
 God did exist, he'd abandoned me. But when I started to see the bigger
 picture, about Vetan and his plan to overthrow the kingdom, about how
 the curse that brought about my transformation gave me abilities I
 needed to uncover the truth about Alsanter's murder, I began to see
 there was a reason for things. There were too many co-incidences for it
 to be just a lucky series of events. And if there really is a reason
 for things, if things happened the way they did because of a plan, then
 ultimately that means there was someone responsible for that plan."
    "God," you put in.
    Torrin nods. "So I asked Tholin about it. I wanted to know if this
 experience proves that God exists. Does this example of providence mean
 that there is now conclusive proof of God?"
    "And what did Tholin say?" you ask.
    "Actually, he said 'No'. He said that all it could do is give me
 evidence. I have to weigh up the evidence for myself. And ultimately,
 any decision comes down to what I believe the evidence says."
    "Did you reach a conclusion about the evidence?" you ask.
    "No, your Majesty," Torrin replies. "Not yet. I have a lot more
 thinking to do about it."

>tevona
 It seems quite a jump to move to that topic of conversation. You
 decide, for the moment, to talk with Torrin about something else.

>topics
 You believe that Torrin might be willing to discuss some of the
 following things:
    Journey
    Curse
    Vetan

>journey
 "Tell me about your journey," you say.
    "What do you want to know, your Majesty," Torrin replies. "It's hard
 to know where to start."
    "How did you cope with being a fox?" you ask.
    Torrin is quiet for a few moments. "I struggled," he says at length.
 "At first I was just stunned. In some ways I felt it would have been
 better to kill me. But the further I went the more complicated is
 became. I had to fight against temptations I never thought I'd be
 susceptible to. I was in danger of being overwhelmed by animalistic
 urges."
    "So how did you overcome them?"
    A wry smile touches Torrin's face. "Actually, Sire, I thought about
 Tevona."

>tevona
 "Tell me about Tevona," you say.
    "What can I say, your Majesty," Torrin replies, with an edge in his
 voice. "I loved her. I was willing to give my life for her. The only
 reason I made it through this experience was because of her. But
 she..." His voice trails off.
    "Betrayed you," you reply. "She betrayed all of us."
    "How do you feel?" Torrin asks, looking at you intently.
    You search for the right words. "Ill," you finally reply. "Crippled.
 But I can't be either. I have to be the king, which means I have to be
 strong."
    "Is that fair?" Torrin questions you.
    "I don't know," you shrug. "As king I am expected to lead, to show
 leadership in everything. To allow myself to be emotionally pulled
 apart by the actions of my daughter would destabilise the kingdom,
 right when it needs strong leadership. Being a leader means making a
 sacrifice."
    Torrin takes a moment before speaking again. "If I might be so bold,
 your Majesty, I think you believe Tevona's betrayal is your fault," he
 says.
    Your emotions threaten to pour out, and it is only with greatest
 effort you contain yourself. "I do," you reply. "Being a leader means
 making sacrifices, but I was too willing to sacrifice my family for the
 kingdom. Tevona may have run away into the arms of my enemy, but it was
 largely because I hadn't shown her my love as her father."

>father
 A strange thought comes to your mind, but you quickly dismiss it. It
 really made no sense.

>topics
 You believe that Torrin might be willing to discuss some of the
 following things:
    Curse
    Vetan

>curse
 "I'm very glad you survived the curse," you say. "For the longest time
 I was worried I had saved you only for you to die again."
    "I must admit, it took some getting used to, Sire," Torrin replies.
 "I think initially I was confused by your decision, and I was wondering
 whether you'd done me a service or not. But I think I'm coming to terms
 with the idea that ultimately it was the best decision for me and for
 the kingdom."
    "You've saved all of us, including Rixomas," you put in. "I had no
 idea that by allowing you to be cursed that would be the outcome.
 You've exceeded my expectations in every way."
    "I'm glad I could be of service," Torrin says.

>rixomas
 "I don't think Rixomas appreciated my blind-siding him by getting him
 to curse you," you say. "I've never seen Rixomas look so stunned."
    "I think he got his own back by sending me to Master Limos," Torrin
 replies.

>limos
 "Tell me about Master Limos," you say. "I was deeply concerned when I
 heard you'd been sent to him."
    "He was extremely helpful," Torrin replies. "At least, once I got to
 him. Because he was being threatened by Vetan he wasn't making it easy.
 But he gave me everything I needed to return here to uncover the plot."

>vetan
 "Vetan seemed to have a personal vendetta against you, didn't he?" you
 say.
    Torrin nods. "I think he was jealous of me, Sire," he replies. "We'd
 both lost a father, but I got to live like a prince."
    "I suppose it doesn't matter who you are, losing someone you love is
 tragic."
    "For Vetan, though, I think all his dreams and aspirations were tied
 up with this father," Torrin adds. "When his father died it changed
 him."
    You consider this for a moment. "Are you suggesting that if we
 hadn't gone to war with Gord that Vetan might not have gone rogue?"
    "I don't know, your Majesty," Torrin responds. "Maybe. I think it's
 just an example of the repercussions of war. The war doesn't end when
 the peace treaty is signed. War changes people. Nothing is the same
 afterwards."
    You nod thoughtfully.

>topics
 You appear to have exhausted all obvious topics of conversation for the
 moment.

>hug torrin
 You're not sure if Torrin is ready for you to reach out to him.
 Something doesn't feel right. You decide to wait a bit more.

    Torrin turns and leans against the battlement, looking out towards
 the setting sun, watching light fade from the land. There is a long
 pause.
    "I'm sorry, Sire," Torrin finally says at last, and you see his
 shoulders slump slightly.
    You look confused. "Sorry? I don't understand."
    "I'm sorry I wasn't able to save Tevona."
    You close your eyes for a moment, trying to will away the tears.
 "The blame is mine," you reply. "Tevona is my daughter. I was
 responsible for her upbringing. The curse is really on me for my
 neglect of my children. I'm sorry I failed you and the kingdom in not
 being a better father."
    As you look at Torrin you get a powerful sense that he is waiting
 for something more from you, something more than words.

>hug torrin
 You reach out your hand and place it on Torrin's shoulder. His head
 turns towards you. "You are my only son, now," you say. "I don't want
 to lose you the way I lost Alsanter and Tevona."
    "You won't, your Majesty."
    You pause. "It would do me great honour for you to call me
 'father'."
    The faintest glimmer of a smile touches Torrin's face, visible in
 the waning sunlight that is breaking through the clouds on the horizon
 in glorious red and yellow streams. You see in Torrin all you wanted
 Alsanter to be, all you wanted Tevona to have. Here is hope, that maybe
 the future might turn out for good after all.
    "The honour will be all mine, father," Torrin replies.
