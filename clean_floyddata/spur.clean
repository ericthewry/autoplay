 In retrospect, maybe all that cheap whiskey last night in Grady's
 wasn't such a brilliant idea.  Not the way the evil, glowing orb of the
 morning sun is burning a hole through your squinting eyes and right
 into the back of your head.  And especially since there's a guy with a
 six-shooter on his belt, ready to draw, standing thirty feet away and
 facing you.  Your body keeps screaming at you that you should still be
 in bed.  The dimly lit cage of your memory tells you that all of this
 has something to do with you standing up for some woman in the saloon
 last night, and right now you wish like hell you could remember.

 No one ever said you were lucky, but you are...

 (New players should type "help".)

 Main Street
   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
 town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
 the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
 here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
 Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.

 Roy Heffer is standing in front of you, his right hand dangling over
 his holster, fingers twitching nervously.  Somewhere in the distance,
 someone strums an out-of-tune Spanish guitar.

>xyzzy
 You can't use the word "xyzzy".

>shoot roy
 Would help if you had your six-shooter in your hand.

>examine roy
 You might want to spend less time staring, and more time thinking about
 the fact that you're in the middle of a gunfight.

 You pull your six-shooter out of your holster.

 Roy draws his six-shooter, yanking it from its holster and raising it
 toward you...

>shoot roy
 You beat Roy to the trigger, shooting him through the heart just as he
 is aiming at yours.  (And surprising yourself while you're at it that
 your old gun hit him--your aim must've been off.)  Roy gasps, drops his
 gun, and falls to the ground, dead.

>search roy
 Roy wasn't exactly a tiny guy.  You're not having the best of luck
 moving him.

 Old Dan arrives from the south.

 (Old Dan has to make an effort to swagger around Roy's body.)

>examine gun
 A six-shooter like yours, but a lot nicer, to be honest.  While you
 paid about three bucks for yours, old Roy here--rest his soul, and all
 that--must've dropped at least ten.  Maybe even fifteen.

>examine my gun
 Old faithful, with the emphasis on the "old" part.  And faithful
 doesn't necessarily mean accurate.

 A crowd starts to gather around you and the corpse.

 Little Jimmy comes running past you from the north.  He stops for a
 second, looks at Roy's stiff, and raises his eyebrows.  "Oooh.  Dead
 guy."

>dan, good morning
 You can't use the word "morning".

>dan, hello
 Old Dan doesn't pay any particular attention to you.

>threaten boy
 You can't use the word "threaten".

>inventory
 You are wearing your holster on your hip where it belongs.  You are
 also carrying a skeleton key and your six-shooter.

 Bobby comes running after Little Jimmy.

 More people come out onto the street to see what happened.  They see
 the body.  Some of them point at you and begin talking to each other in
 low voices.

 Little Jimmy goes running off to the south.

>eat key
 You can't eat the skeleton key.

>put my gun in holster
 You put your six-shooter in the holster.

 Bobby chases off after Little Jimmy.

 You hear someone saying to you:  "Look, partner.  I dunno what your
 beef with ole Roy here was, but you best be getting outta here before
 the Sheriff shows up."

>GET ALL FROM ROY
 Roy Heffer isn't here.

>GET ALL FROM CORPSE
 Nothing to get.

>get roy's gun
 Taken.

 Little Jimmy comes running past you from the south.  He stops for a
 second, looks at Roy's stiff, and raises his eyebrows.  "Oooh.  Dead
 guy."

 Old Dan heads off to the east.

>get all
 Roy Heffer's body:  Only if you want to be spotted carting a dead body
 around town.  Not recommended.
 gathering crowd:  You can't take that.
 Little Jimmy:  Little Jimmy probably wouldn't be too big on that idea.

>get roy's gun
 You don't see that.

>get gun
 You pull your six-shooter out of your holster.

 Bobby comes running after Little Jimmy.

 Little Jimmy goes running off to the north.

 Old Dan arrives from the east.

 (Old Dan has to make an effort to swagger around Roy's body.)

>undo

 Main Street
   Little Jimmy is here, cheerfully chomping on some sticky taffy.
   Roy Heffer's rapidly cooling body is here.
   A crowd is gathering around the corpse.

>shoot crowd
 You let go a shot, but it misses.  Doesn't matter, anyway.  Even if
 you'd hit somebody, the rest of the crowd would still swarm around and
 proceed to beat the ever-lovin' crap outta you, leaving you a bloody,
 lifeless pulp.  Like they are at the moment, actually.

 *** YOU HAVE DIED ***

 The game has ended.  Do you want to (R)ESTART, R(E)STORE a saved game,
 (U)NDO your last turn, or (Q)UIT?
>undo

 You don't smell anything unusual.

 Bobby comes running after Little Jimmy.

 Little Jimmy goes running off to the north.

 Old Dan arrives from the east.

 (Old Dan has to make an effort to swagger around Roy's body.)

>examine dan
 Old Dan looks like he's been on a bit of a bender.  One that's lasted
 about twenty years, to be honest.  His body looks like it's had the
 hell beaten out of it time and time again.  But there's something about
 his eyes that--if they would just take a second to focus--seems like
 there's wisdom hidden somewhere deep in their murky depths.

 Bobby chases off after Little Jimmy.

 Old Dan heads off to the west.

>crowd, dance
 You can't use the word "dance".

>inventory
 You are wearing your holster on your hip where it belongs.  You are
 also carrying a skeleton key and Roy's gun.  Tucked in your holster is
 your six-shooter.

 Old Dan arrives from the west.

 (Old Dan has to make an effort to swagger around Roy's body.)

>tell dan about roy
 Old Dan doesn't seem particularly interested in what you have to say
 about Roy Heffer.

>talk to dan
 Old Dan is listening.

>ask dan about roy
 "Once in a while Roy'd buy me drink or something.  Didja have to go and
 kill him, of all people?"

>no
 That was a rhetorical question.  (Although you sound rather negative.)

 (Assuming you mean Old Dan.)
 "I just don't know anything about that, cowboy.  How's about buying me
 a drink anyway?"

 Old Dan heads off to the north.

>follow dan
 Which way did he go?

   A crowd is gathering around the corpse.

>go east

 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel
   Sunlight glares in through the swinging saloonesque doors, only to be
 swallowed up by the murkiness inside.  Tables and chairs, barstools
 along the long counter, and a room-length mirror behind the bar.
 There's a horseshoe tacked to the wall, too.  Stairs go up to the hotel
 rooms on the second floor.  The billiards room, such as it is, is in
 the northwest corner.
   Grady is behind the bar.

 Grady studies you as you come in.  "Plannin' on paying your bill
 anytime soon?"

 You watch under the swinging doors as several sets of boots show up.
 The Sheriff's deputies have come looking for you.

>no
 That was a rhetorical question.  (Although you sound rather negative.)

>examine me
 (in the mirror)
 Shouldn't have done that.  You look like hell.

>ask dan about sherrif
 You can't use the word "sherrif".

>break mirror
 Venting your frustrations on the mirror won't accomplish much.

>ask grady about sherriff
 You can't use the word "sherriff".

>ask grady about woman
 You haven't seen anybody like that.

>ask grady about sheriff
 Grady doesn't seem to know anything about Sheriff Argyle.

>ask grady about roy
 Grady shrugs.  "I'm glad you plugged him.  Just don't spread the rumors
 of my joy around.  After what that son of a bitch did to this town?
 Him and his cattle-stealing old man?  Good goddamn riddance."

>ask grady for reward
 You can't use the word "reward".

>ask grady about Roy's father.
 You can't use the word "father".

>ask grady about Roy's old man.
 You haven't seen any "roy's old", nor are you likely to, even if such a
 thing exists.

>examine horseshoes
 You can't use the word "horseshoes".

>examine horseshoe
 Your basic lucky-charm horseshoe.

>ask grady about last night
 "Forget it, dustball.  After that trouble you caused in here last
 night--winding up with wasting some guy on the street outside my
 place?--you ain't getting another drink in here."
 Grady shrugs.  "I'm glad you plugged him.  Just don't spread the rumors
 of my joy around.  After what that son of a bitch did to this town?
 Him and his cattle-stealing old man?  Good goddamn riddance."

>ask grady about drink
 You haven't seen anything like that.

>ask grady about dan
 "Old Dan?" Grady shakes his head.  "When he's got money, he's my best
 customer.  When he doesn't, like almost always, he's a pain in my ass."

>ask grady for a drink
 You haven't seen anything like that.

>examine bar
 You don't need to refer to that.

>examine mirror
 (in the mirror)
 Shouldn't have done that.  You look like hell.

>buy drink
 "Forget it, dustball.  After that trouble you caused in here last
 night--winding up with wasting some guy on the street outside my
 place?--you ain't getting another drink in here."

>sell gun
 You can't use the word "sell".

>examine pants
 As much as you like them, style probably shouldn't be your number one
 concern right now.

>buy mirror
 Normally you'd have to be in a store to buy something.

>shoot grady
 You pull the trigger and shoot Grady.  He falls to the ground, twitches
 a couple of times, then lies there, getting cold.

 Old Dan arrives from the west.

>undo

 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel
   Grady is behind the bar.

>remove pants
 As much as you like them, style probably shouldn't be your number one
 concern right now.

 Old Dan arrives from the west.

 Grady looks up from behind the bar as Old Dan wanders in.  "Out!" he
 says, pointing toward the door.

>twitch
 You can't use the word "twitch".

>buy drink for dan
 That doesn't make any sense.

>kiss dan
 Old Dan doesn't seem to share your affection.

 Old Dan heads off to the west.

>go up

 Upstairs hallway
   Rooms on all sides of the landing--their doors closed and probably
 locked.  The stairs go back downstairs to the saloon.

>go up
 The stairs end here.

>examine doors
 You can't use the word "doors".

>examine door
 The room door is closed.

>open it
 (Assuming you mean the room door.)
 The room door is locked.

>unlock it
 (Assuming you mean the room door.)
 (with the skeleton key)
 Unlocked.

>enter it
 (Assuming you mean the room door.)
 (opening the room door first)
 As you open the door, it bangs against an empty whiskey bottle that had
 rolled against it.  The bottle skitters away into the corner of the
 room.

 Your hotel room
   Not too fancy, but then you get what you pay for.  A bed with a
 mattress that was, as you vaguely remember it, rather wooden.  A wash
 basin and mirror along one wall.  Curtains closed, covering the single
 small window.
   Looks like someone slipped a piece of paper under the door while you
 were out.
   In the corner of the room is a whiskey bottle, empty and discarded.

>remove pants
 You don't see that.

>examine paper
 "Meet me at the stable at 10:00.

                            - S."

 (Not like you have any memory of who S. is.)

>time
 You can't use the word "time".

>smell bottle
 One whiff of the old Dr. Vita-Vim's (even the empty bottle) is enough
 to set your head a-spinning.

>take bottle
 Taken.

>spin bottle
 You can't use the word "spin".

>time
 You can't use the word "time".

>enter bed
 You can't get on the bed.

>look under it
 (Assuming you mean the bed.)
 You don't find anything under the bed.

>examine mattress
 Looking at the bed doesn't bring back any fond memories of comfortable
 sleep.  The bedsheet is still in a crumpled heap at the foot of the
 bed.

>search it
 (Assuming you mean the bed.)
 You don't find anything.

>wear sheet
 You can't wear the bedsheet.

>take bedsheet
 Taken.

>open curtains
 Opened.  Through the closed window you can just peek around the corner
 of the hotel enough to see Main Street below.  You see a gang of
 deputies waiting in front of the saloon--waiting for you, that is.

>examine deputies
 The Sheriff's deputies aren't here.

>open window
 Opened.

>leap through window
 That doesn't make any sense.

>take paper
 Taken.

>eat oaoer

>eat paper
 You can't eat the handwritten note.

 exactly the perfect jumping scenario.

 Enter saved game to store:
>cf-spur-1
 Saved.

>cf1
 You can't use the word "cf1".

 You can't use the word "tear".

>look

 Your hotel room
   Not too fancy, but then you get what you pay for.  A bed with a
 mattress that was, as you vaguely remember it, rather wooden.  A wash

 small window and Main Street below.

>laugh. cry.
 You can't use the word "laugh".

>look under mattress
 You don't find anything under the bed.

 The wash basin looks just like you would expect.

>throw mattress out window
 You haven't seen any "mattress out", nor are you likely to, even if
 such a thing exists.

>put mattress in window
 You can't do that with the small window.

>throw mattress
 You're not holding that.

>enter window with mattress
 That doesn't make any sense.

>tie sheet to bed
 You can't tie the bedsheet to the bed.

>tie sheet
 You'll have to be a little more specific about what you'd like to tie
 the bedsheet to.

>rip sheet
 You can't use the word "rip".

>examine window
 Through the open window you can just peek around the corner of the
 hotel enough to see Main Street below.  You see a gang of deputies
 waiting in front of the saloon--waiting for you, that is.  As you stick
 your head out the open window, you see a drainpipe running along the
 outside of the wall.

>tie sheet to curtain
 You can't tie the bedsheet to the curtains.

>examine drainpipe
 The sturdy pipe is attached to the side of the building.

>tie sheet to it
 (Assuming you mean the drainpipe.)
 You tie the bedsheet to the drainpipe.

>climb drainpipe
 That wouldn't help you--the pipe doesn't go all the way to the ground.

>enter drainpipe
 You can't enter the drainpipe.

>climb sheet
 As you climb down the bedsheet, it starts to rip.  One small piece of
 cloth tears away and flutters down below you.

 Narrow alley
   Running along the north side of Grady's--the old wall of the building
 is directly behind you.  Grady's storage shed is just to the north, and
 Main Street is back out to the west.  You're well hidden by a stack of
 old, sun-bleached wooden barrels.   Overhead, you can see your
 bedsheet, flapping in the wind from where it's still attached to the
 drainpipe.
   The small piece of cloth from the bedsheet is lying on the ground.

>enter bottle. pour bottle into drainpipe
 You can't enter the whiskey bottle.

>take cloth
 Taken.

>examine it
 (Assuming you mean the scrap of cloth.)
 The piece of cloth is about the size of a handkerchief.

>blow nose
 You can't use the word "nose".

>wear cloth
 You can't wear the scrap of cloth.

>examine barrels
 Messing around the barrels will not get you anywhere.  Honestly.

>examine shed
 Your basic slats-thrown-together storage shed.  One door, which is
 closed.  One window, which is closed.

>open it
 (Assuming you mean Grady's storage shed.)
 The shed door is locked.

>open window
 You can't do that with the shed window.

>break it
 (Assuming you mean the shed window.)
 With what?  Your hand?  Not too damn likely.

>unlock shed
 You're not holding any key that fits.

>examine window
 Through the window, you can see an assortment of tools and various
 other implements, including a ten-foot ladder.

>break it with cloth
 (Assuming you mean the shed window.)
 Not with that, you won't.

>break it with gun
 (Assuming you mean the shed window.)
 The glass shatters with a crash.

>enter window
 The window is just a little too small to fit through, not to mention
 the fact that you'd probably hack yourself to death on the broken
 glass.

>put cloth on window
 You can't do that with the shed window.

>get ladder
 You don't see that.

>reach in window
 You can't use the word "reach".

 Through the broken window, you can see an assortment of tools and
 various other implements, including a ten-foot ladder.

 You can't do that with the shed window.

 Pulling the bedsheet doesn't get you anywhere.

 As in, you'd like to know how you're doing, right?

 Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self
 defense.

 On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel
 room unnoticed.

 That's what you've managed to get done so far.  Not exactly a
 spectacular start to the day.

>go west
 You find a foothold on the stack of barrels and clamber over.

 North end of Main Street
   Now leaving the bustling metropolis of Tumbleweed Flats, pop. 59.
 The local stable is off to the northwest, just north of an empty field.
 To the east is the north end of the hotel, although it doesn't look
 like you'd be able to get by the stack of crates and barrels.  A dusty
 road continues north out of town.
   To the south, you can see a gang of deputies lounging around outside
 Grady's Saloon--presumably waiting for you.
   Little Jimmy is here, cheerfully chomping on some sticky taffy.
   Bobby is here, jumping up and down in place.

 Little Jimmy goes running off to the north.

>take bobby
 Bobby probably wouldn't be too big on that idea.

>ask bobby for taffy
>go south
 Bobby ignores you as if he didn't even hear you.

 Bobby chases off after Little Jimmy.


 Main Street
   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
 town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
 the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
 here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
 Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.

 As you arrive, the deputies jump up from where they've been waiting for
 you, grab you, and push you to the ground.  They quickly shackle your
 hands before hauling you back to your feet.  Time to go see the
 Sheriff...

 ...and the gallows.

 The game has ended.  Do you want to (R)ESTART, R(E)STORE a saved game,
 (U)NDO your last turn, or (Q)UIT?

>go northwest
 (opening the heavy stable door first)
 With a grunt, you heave the stable door open.

 Little Jimmy comes running past you from the north.

 Stable
   Smells musty, just like every other stable you've ever been in.
 There's a meager half-light drifting down from a window in the loft
 overhead, and the stable door leads back out onto Main Street to the
 southeast.  If anybody in this town owned a horse, this is where they'd
 keep it.
   The gate to one of the stalls to the north is closed.

>grunt
 You can't use the word "grunt".

>examine stall
 The stall gate is closed.

 The gate swings open with a creak.

 You don't find anything.

>go north

 Stall
   Any question as to where the musty odor of the stable is coming from
 is answered by coming in here--the pile of old hay on the ground was
 probably due for a changing a couple of weeks ago.  A few
 long-since-used pieces of leather tack--a bridle and saddle among
 them--hang on the wall.  The stall door to the south is open.
   Standing sullenly in the corner of the stall is an old black mare.

>look under mare
 You don't find anything under the old black mare.

>ask mare about s
 You can't do that with the old black mare.

   Now leaving the bustling metropolis of Tumbleweed Flats, pop. 59.
 The local stable is off to the northwest, just north of an empty field.
 To the east is the north end of the hotel, although it doesn't look
 like you'd be able to get by the stack of crates and barrels.  A dusty
 road continues north out of town.
   Old Dan, the town drunk, is here, standing in place and swaying
 slightly.
   Little Jimmy is here, cheerfully chomping on some sticky taffy.

 Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self

 On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel

 That's what you've managed to get done so far.  Not exactly a

 In retrospect, maybe all that cheap whiskey last night in Grady's
 wasn't such a brilliant idea.  Not the way the evil, glowing orb of the
 morning sun is burning a hole through your squinting eyes and right
 into the back of your head.  And especially since there's a guy with a
 six-shooter on his belt, ready to draw, standing thirty feet away and
 facing you.  Your body keeps screaming at you that you should still be
 in bed.  The dimly lit cage of your memory tells you that all of this
 has something to do with you standing up for some woman in the saloon
 last night, and right now you wish like hell you could remember.

 No one ever said you were lucky, but you are...

 Main Street
   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
 town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
 the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
 here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
 Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.

 Roy Heffer is standing in front of you, his right hand dangling over
 his holster, fingers twitching nervously.  Somewhere in the distance,
 someone strums an out-of-tune Spanish guitar.

>help








>help
 Good question.  Seems that you've found yourself in the middle of a
 gunfight without a clue as to what's going on.  You might want to get
 used to it (the without a clue feeling) because it's not going to go
 away anytime soon.

 The first order of business is to get out of the abovementioned
 scrape--that's pretty much up to you.  Now, chances are that as a
 result of saving your hide, things are going to get kind of ugly, and
 you may have to get into the habit of laying low, at least for a while.
 That, too, is up to you.

 But things also aren't going to be that simple.

 You see, there's obviously a reason that you're standing on Main Street
 with your hand dangling over your holster and some guy you barely know
 facing you ten paces away and doing the same.  At least there'd better
 be.  And if that's the case, you'd best be finding out what it is in a
 hurry.  Because, guaranteed, things are going to get a whole lot more
 complicated before long.  (You might want to keep in mind that you're
 not exactly John Wayne here; expert marksman, quickest draw, and
 all-round Western hero, you aren't.)

 And this--you think you're in a pickle now?  Hell, partner.  This is
 only the beginning.

 Roy Heffer doesn't seem to share your affection.

>shoot roy
 Would help if you had your six-shooter in your hand.

>draw
 You pull your six-shooter out of your holster.

 Roy draws his six-shooter, yanking it from its holster and raising it
 toward you...

>shoot roy
 You beat Roy to the trigger, shooting him through the heart just as he
 is aiming at yours.  (And surprising yourself while you're at it that
 your old gun hit him--your aim must've been off.)  Roy gasps, drops his
 gun, and falls to the ground, dead.

>get all
 Roy Heffer's body:  Only if you want to be spotted carting a dead body
 around town.  Not recommended.
 Roy's gun:  Taken.

 Old Dan arrives from the south.

 (Old Dan has to make an effort to swagger around Roy's body.)

>go east

 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel
   Sunlight glares in through the swinging saloonesque doors, only to be
 swallowed up by the murkiness inside.  Tables and chairs, barstools
 along the long counter, and a room-length mirror behind the bar.
 There's a horseshoe tacked to the wall, too.  Stairs go up to the hotel
 rooms on the second floor.  The billiards room, such as it is, is in
 the northwest corner.
   Grady is behind the bar.

 Grady studies you as you come in.  "Plannin' on paying your bill
 anytime soon?"

>wave to grady
 You wave.  Nothing happens.

 Grady leafs through the hotel ledger.

>go up

 Upstairs hallway
   Rooms on all sides of the landing--their doors closed and probably
 locked.  The stairs go back downstairs to the saloon.

>unlock door. open it. w
 (with the skeleton key)
 Unlocked.

 (Assuming you mean the room door.)
 As you open the door, it bangs against an empty whiskey bottle that had
 rolled against it.  The bottle skitters away into the corner of the
 room.


 Your hotel room
   Not too fancy, but then you get what you pay for.  A bed with a
 mattress that was, as you vaguely remember it, rather wooden.  A wash
 basin and mirror along one wall.  Curtains closed, covering the single
 small window.
   Looks like someone slipped a piece of paper under the door while you
 were out.
   In the corner of the room is a whiskey bottle, empty and discarded.

>get all
 handwritten note:  Taken.
 whiskey bottle:  Taken.

>get sheet. open curtain. open window
 You haven't seen anything like that.

>examine bed
 Looking at the bed doesn't bring back any fond memories of comfortable
 sleep.  The bedsheet is still in a crumpled heap at the foot of the
 bed.

>get sheet
 Taken.

>open curtain. open window
 Opened.  Through the closed window you can just peek around the corner
 of the hotel enough to see Main Street below.  Roy Heffer's body is
 lying in the middle of it, surrounded by a rubbernecking crowd.

 Opened.

>tie sheet to drainpipe
 You tie the bedsheet to the drainpipe.

>climb sheet. get cloth
 As you climb down the bedsheet, it starts to rip.  One small piece of
 cloth tears away and flutters down below you.

 Narrow alley
   Running along the north side of Grady's--the old wall of the building
 is directly behind you.  Grady's storage shed is just to the north, and
 Main Street is back out to the west.  You're well hidden by a stack of
 old, sun-bleached wooden barrels.   Overhead, you can see your
 bedsheet, flapping in the wind from where it's still attached to the
 drainpipe.
   The small piece of cloth from the bedsheet is lying on the ground.

 Taken.

>go west
 You find a foothold on the stack of barrels and clamber over.

 North end of Main Street
   Now leaving the bustling metropolis of Tumbleweed Flats, pop. 59.
 The local stable is off to the northwest, just north of an empty field.
 To the east is the north end of the hotel, although it doesn't look
 like you'd be able to get by the stack of crates and barrels.  A dusty
 road continues north out of town.
   To the south, you can see a gang of deputies lounging around outside
 Grady's Saloon--presumably waiting for you.
   Bobby is here, jumping up and down in place.

 Bobby chases off after Little Jimmy.

>go northwest
 (opening the heavy stable door first)
 With a grunt, you heave the stable door open.

 Stable
   Smells musty, just like every other stable you've ever been in.
 There's a meager half-light drifting down from a window in the loft
 overhead, and the stable door leads back out onto Main Street to the
 southeast.  If anybody in this town owned a horse, this is where they'd
 keep it.
   The gate to one of the stalls to the north is closed.

>save

>cf3

>open gate. n
 The gate swings open with a creak.


 Stall
   Any question as to where the musty odor of the stable is coming from
 is answered by coming in here--the pile of old hay on the ground was
 probably due for a changing a couple of weeks ago.  A few
 long-since-used pieces of leather tack--a bridle and saddle among
 them--hang on the wall.  The stall door to the south is open.
   Standing sullenly in the corner of the stall is an old black mare.

>ride mare. ride s
 You get on the old black mare.

 hands before hauling you back to your feet.  Time to go see the
 Sheriff...

 A woman slips into the stable behind you.  She stands off to the side,
 almost in the shadows, regarding you warily.  She looks vaguely
 familiar.

 The woman seems relieved.  "Good.  I wasn't sure if you'd actually
 come," she says.

 She goes to the stable door and looks outside, making sure that the two
 of you are alone before she closes it.

>kiss woman
 She pushes you away.  "Hey, hayseed.  I don't know what you think
 you've got coming for helping me out, but if that's it, you can just
 forget it."

 "That must mean you remember what I told you last night in Grady's,
 right?  About Glen Heffer?  I mean before his bastard son showed up and
 started causing trouble."

 That's when it hits you:  this is the woman for whose honor--directly
 or indirectly--you ended up in a gunfight this morning.  Sarah or
 Sandra or Samantha or something like that.  Sarah.  That's right:
 Sarah.  Whew.  Nice memory on you.

>examine sarah
 Sarah's long brown hair is tucked up under her wide-brimmed cowboy hat.
 There's a look of seriousness about her face, and strain, as if she's
 got a little bit too much to deal with right now.

>ask sarah about glen
 "I guess he can add kidnapper and blackmailer to his list of
 accomplishments, right after thief, murderer, and son-of-a-bitch."

 Sarah looks at you skeptically again.  "Okay.  Here's what you have to
 do," she says.  "You've got a horse.  Good.  You know the road going
 east just north of town?  Ride east, all the way to the end.  You'll
 know when you're there because you'll find me waiting for you."

>ask sarah about last night
 Sarah doesn't seem to know anything about last night.

 Sarah's face softens a little, and some of her tough facade fades away.

 "Look, I don't know if you're a hero or just not very smart or what.
 It was more than enough that you stood up for me against Roy.  Now
 this.  It's probably more than I can ask, but...thank you."

>ask sarah about len
 You can't use the word "len".

>ask sarah about glen
 "I guess he can add kidnapper and blackmailer to his list of

 about, about Uncle Bucky.  Today?  Well, today I'm glad you shot him."

>ask sarah about bucky
 "He may be a little strange, but, hey, he's my uncle, and he's dear to
 me--and it's not just because he's got a lot of money.  But I'm not
 going to let that rotten snake Glen Heffer force me into coming up with
 ransom money--Uncle Bucky wouldn't want that."

>tell sarah about deputies
 Sarah doesn't seem particularly interested in what you have to say
 about the Sheriff's deputies.

>tell sarah about sheriff
 Sarah doesn't seem particularly interested in what you have to say
 about Sheriff Argyle.

 Edge of town, on an old black mare

 around from the south.  A dead, rotted tree stands here, marking the

 In your wisdom, you have driven the old black mare past the point of

 Upstairs hallway
   Rooms on all sides of the landing--their doors closed and probably
 locked.  The stairs go back downstairs to the saloon.


 Your hotel room
   Not too fancy, but then you get what you pay for.  A bed with a
 mattress that was, as you vaguely remember it, rather wooden.  A wash
 basin and mirror along one wall.  Curtains open, revealing the single
 small window and Main Street below.
   Through the open curtains, you can see your bedsheet fluttering from
 where it is tied to the drainpipe outside.


 Narrow alley
   Running along the north side of Grady's--the old wall of the building
 is directly behind you.  Grady's storage shed is just to the north, and
 Main Street is back out to the west.  You're well hidden by a stack of
 old, sun-bleached wooden barrels.   Overhead, you can see your
 bedsheet, flapping in the wind from where it's still attached to the
 drainpipe.

>go west
 You find a foothold on the stack of barrels and clamber over.

 North end of Main Street
   Now leaving the bustling metropolis of Tumbleweed Flats, pop. 59.
 The local stable is off to the northwest, just north of an empty field.
 To the east is the north end of the hotel, although it doesn't look
 like you'd be able to get by the stack of crates and barrels.  A dusty
 road continues north out of town.
   Old Dan, the town drunk, is here, standing in place and swaying
 slightly.

 Old Dan heads off to the south.

>go south

 Main Street
   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
 town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
 the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
 here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
 Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.
   Old Dan, the town drunk, is here, standing in place and swaying
 slightly.

 Old Dan heads off to the south.

>go south

 South end of Main Street
   Standing here in the middle of Main Street, you are directly across
 from the Tumbleweed Flats Sheriff's Department, which is directly to
 the east.  Not the safest place to hang out, perhaps, considering that
 the gallows are right on the other side of the street--and you might as
 well try and avoid that particular inevitability for as long as
 possible.  Might be a better idea to head north, back up Main Street.

 Sheriff's building
   Cramped quarters, actually.  Barely room enough for the sheriff's
 desk and a jail cell in the corner.
   Sheriff Argyle is sitting behind his desk, munching on a sandwich and
 reading "Strange Western Lawkeeper Tales".

 Argyle's eyes bulge out of his head as you stroll in.  He drops his
 sandwich.  "Jumpin' Jehosophat!  I mean...well, I mean, aren't you the
 guy who shot Roy Heffer?"

>no
 That was a rhetorical question.  (Although you sound rather negative.)

>argyle, no
 Sheriff Argyle ignores you.

>tell argyle about dan
 Sheriff Argyle doesn't seem particularly interested in what you have to
 say about Old Dan.

>ask argyle about horse
 The Sheriff eyes you warily.  "Look, I'm not exactly sure what you're

 Roy?"

>shoot argyle
 You pull the trigger, and--CLICK.  Your six-shooter is empty.

 Lucille's General Store
   More clutter than any person in their right mind would know what to
 do with.  Luckily Lucille has the right idea:  put it all on shelves
 and call it a General Store.  Among other things, the shelves contain a
 box of bullets (one dollar), a box of shotgun shells (three dollars),
 an empty taffy box, a trail kit (one dollar), and a pick-axe (five
 dollars).
   Lucille herself is standing behind the counter.

>examine kit
 A label reads:  "Everything you need to be prepared.  If you don't get
 yourself one of these here kits, you're not prepared.  If you're not
 prepared, you're dead, buddy.  Get it?"  The hard sell, you might say.

   Old Dan, the town drunk, is here, standing in place and swaying
 slightly.

 Knowing full well there's a way over the barrels and crates, you
 clamber awkwardly over the stack...

 Narrow alley
   Running along the north side of Grady's--the old wall of the building
 is directly behind you.  Grady's storage shed is just to the north, and
 Main Street is back out to the west.  You're well hidden by a stack of
 old, sun-bleached wooden barrels.   Overhead, you can see your
 bedsheet, flapping in the wind from where it's still attached to the
 drainpipe.

>unlock shed
 You're not holding any key that fits.

>inventory
 You are wearing your holster on your hip where it belongs.  You are
 holding a whiskey bottle.  You are also carrying a skeleton key, two
 pistols (your six-shooter and Roy's gun), a handwritten note, a scrap
 of cloth, and some sticky taffy.

>w.s.e.get key
 You find a foothold on the stack of barrels and clamber over.

 North end of Main Street
   Now leaving the bustling metropolis of Tumbleweed Flats, pop. 59.
 The local stable is off to the northwest, just north of an empty field.
 To the east is the north end of the hotel, although it doesn't look
 like you'd be able to get by the stack of crates and barrels.  A dusty
 road continues north out of town.


 Main Street
   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
 town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
 the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
 here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
 Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.

 Old Dan arrives from the south.


 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel
   Sunlight glares in through the swinging saloonesque doors, only to be
 swallowed up by the murkiness inside.  Tables and chairs, barstools
 along the long counter, and a room-length mirror behind the bar.
 There's a horseshoe tacked to the wall, too.  Stairs go up to the hotel
 rooms on the second floor.  The billiards room, such as it is, is in
 the northwest corner.
   Grady is behind the bar.
   Sitting on the bar is the key to Grady's shed.

 You don't see that.

>examine key

 It's the key to Grady's shed.  In fact, it's got "Grady's Shed"

 Grady's storage shed
   It's dark in here.  The only light bleeds in through the window and
 the open door.  Looks like this is where Grady keeps most of his junk.
   Resting on the ground against one wall is a ten-foot wooden ladder.

>get ladder
 You're carrying too much to take that.

 Most of the metal stuff is rusted.  Most of the wooden stuff is
 termite-gnawed.  None of it is of much use to you.

 Stable
   Smells musty, just like every other stable you've ever been in.
 There's a meager half-light drifting down from a window in the loft
 overhead, and the stable door leads back out onto Main Street to the
 southeast.  If anybody in this town owned a horse, this is where they'd
 keep it.
   The gate to the stall to the north is open.
   An old black mare is here.

 Try leaning the ladder against something for starters.

>lead ladder against mare

 You can't lean the ladder against the old black mare.

 You lean the ladder against the loft, just where the hayloft begins.

 Sitting in the hayloft
   About ten or so feet off the stable floor.  Too far to jump--better
 to make wise use of the ladder which is still leaning against the wall.
 Sunlight shines in through a small square window.

 Down, you say?  Well, you begin to shimmy down the tree, precariously
 clutching onto branches and outcroppings of tough bark--whatever you
 can reach.  Finally, scraped and bruised all to hell, you find yourself
 on firm ground.

 Hidden meadow
   Obviously not a popular picnic spot; in fact, if not for your vantage
 point perched atop the tree, you would never have known it was here,
 much less be able to blindly navigate your way through the thick of
 trees to the south.  The meadow opens up to the west.
   Strutting proudly around the meadow is a fiery red stallion.

>examine horse
 A finer-looking animal you've never seen.  You could probably ride
 forever on this horse, and it wouldn't even break a sweat.

 however, an old man in an ascot and a mop of gray hair (John Stratford,
 that is) comes chasing after you from the west.

 "Get off my blimey horse!" he hollers at you in a proper British
 accent.  Right before jamming a couple of shells into a
 double-barrelled shotgun and shooting you dead.

 Front porch
   Of a mansion, or what might be considered a mansion if it weren't

 Ricardo's Growth Tonic (which he peddles to the unsuspecting populace
 whenever he's in town, about every four months or so) and poured it
 over one of the ramshackle houses--albeit one of the nicer
 ones--scattered about Tumbleweed Flats.  You can enter the house to the
 west.
   John Stratford is sitting in his rocking chair, smoking his pipe.
 His trusty shotgun is across his lap.

>shoot stratford with roy's gun
 Blam!  Stratford looks surprised as hell as you shoot him.  He pitches
 forward onto his knees, then tumbles forward onto his face.  He lies
 that way on the ground at your feet.

 Now.  What happens next is your introduction to the lovely Juanita
 Stratford, devoted wife of the (recently) late John Stratford.  She
 comes racing out of the house with her shotgun--exactly the same make
 and model as his, how romantic--lines up the barrel between you and
 her, and starts trigger-pulling.  Love, baby.  And you got in its way.

 End of the road, on a fiery red stallion
   The dusty road stretches back to the west as far as the eye can see,

 As in, you'd like to know how you're doing, right?

 Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self
 defense.  It would also be interesting to see who would think highly of
 your stealing Little Jimmy's candy.

 On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel
 room unnoticed.  And putting together that plan to steal Stratford's
 stallion showed at least a little ingenuity.  Plus, if it weren't so
 seedy and practically dishonest, having wits enough to bamboozle Grady
 with a weed looking like a four-leaf clover would almost be
 commendable.

 That's what you've managed to get done so far.  Being generally
 disruptive, that is.

   Standing guarding the front of the house is Glen Heffer's

 Large Duane is not a friendly looking fellow.  If he sees you, he'll

 Trying to shoot Large Duane from so far away isn't such a hot idea
 seeing as what a lousy shot you are.  The same, however, is not true

 aims, and hits you right between the eyes.

 Lucille's General Store
   More clutter than any person in their right mind would know what to
 do with.  Luckily Lucille has the right idea:  put it all on shelves
 and call it a General Store.  Among other things, the shelves contain a
 box of bullets (one dollar), a box of shotgun shells (three dollars),
 an empty taffy box, a trail kit (one dollar), and a pick-axe (five
 dollars).

 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel
   Sunlight glares in through the swinging saloonesque doors, only to be
 swallowed up by the murkiness inside.  Tables and chairs, barstools
 along the long counter, and a room-length mirror behind the bar.
 There's a horseshoe tacked to the wall, too.  Stairs go up to the hotel
 rooms on the second floor.  The billiards room, such as it is, is in
 the northwest corner.
   Grady is behind the bar.

 Try giving something to someone in particular.

>give weed to grady
 "A four-leaf clover?  For me?  I ...well, I don't know what to say.
 Maybe this'll turn my luck around.  Maybe I misjudged you."  And with
 that, Grady takes the weed from you.

 says.  But then he shrugs and digs out the key anyway, putting it down
 on the counter.

 Knowing full well there's a way over the barrels and crates, you
 clamber awkwardly over the stack...

 Narrow alley
   Running along the north side of Grady's--the old wall of the building

 Main Street is back out to the west.  You're well hidden by a stack of

   It's dark in here.  The only light bleeds in through the window and

 Stable
   Smells musty, just like every other stable you've ever been in.
 There's a meager half-light drifting down from a window in the loft
 overhead, and the stable door leads back out onto Main Street to the
 southeast.  If anybody in this town owned a horse, this is where they'd
 keep it.
   The gate to the stall to the north is open.
   An old black mare is here.

 There's no room on the loft.

 You lean the ladder against the loft, just where the hayloft begins.

 Sitting in the hayloft
   About ten or so feet off the stable floor.  Too far to jump--better
 to make wise use of the ladder which is still leaning against the wall.
 Sunlight shines in through a small square window.

>out

 Perched on the top branch of an oak tree
   In the manner of a crow or vulture or some other sort of
 top-branch-perching bird.  The loft window is behind you, technically
 to the southeast, while the ground is perilously far below.

>climb down
 You're in a tree.  Think about it.

>go down
 Down, you say?  Well, you begin to shimmy down the tree, precariously
 clutching onto branches and outcroppings of tough bark--whatever you
 can reach.  Finally, scraped and bruised all to hell, you find yourself
 on firm ground.

 As in, you'd like to know how you're doing, right?

 Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self
 defense.  And while you did break into Grady's liquor stash, that
 doesn't really count as being productive.  It would also be interesting
 to see who would think highly of your stealing Little Jimmy's candy.

 On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel
 room unnoticed.  And putting together that plan to steal Stratford's
 stallion showed at least a little ingenuity.  Plus, if it weren't so
 seedy and practically dishonest, having wits enough to bamboozle Grady
 with a weed looking like a four-leaf clover would almost be
 commendable.

 That's what you've managed to get done so far.  Being generally
 disruptive, that is.

 of the trees, to the northeast, is the entrance the local stable.  Back
 east is Main Street.
   Little Jimmy is here, looking sullen.
   Bobby is here, jumping up and down in place.

>ride n

 Hidden meadow, on a fiery red stallion
   Obviously not a popular picnic spot; in fact, if not for your vantage
 point perched atop the tree, you would never have known it was here,
 much less be able to blindly navigate your way through the thick of
 trees to the south.  The meadow opens up to the west.

 North end of Main Street, on a fiery red stallion
   Now leaving the bustling metropolis of Tumbleweed Flats, pop. 59.
 The local stable is off to the northwest, just north of an empty field.
 To the east is the north end of the hotel, although it doesn't look
 like you'd be able to get by the stack of crates and barrels.  A dusty
 road continues north out of town.

>ride nw

 Stable, on a fiery red stallion
   Smells musty, just like every other stable you've ever been in.
 There's a meager half-light drifting down from a window in the loft
 overhead, and the stable door leads back out onto Main Street to the
 southeast.  If anybody in this town owned a horse, this is where they'd
 keep it.
   The gate to the stall to the north is open.
   The ten-foot ladder is leaning against the loft.
   An old black mare is here.

>ride nn
 You can't use the word "nn".

>ride n

 Stall, on a fiery red stallion
   Any question as to where the musty odor of the stable is coming from
 is answered by coming in here--the pile of old hay on the ground was
 probably due for a changing a couple of weeks ago.  A few
 long-since-used pieces of leather tack--a bridle and saddle among
 them--hang on the wall.  The stall door to the south is open.

 Knowing full well there's a way over the barrels and crates, you
 clamber awkwardly over the stack...

 Narrow alley
   Running along the north side of Grady's--the old wall of the building
 is directly behind you.  Grady's storage shed is just to the north, and
 Main Street is back out to the west.  You're well hidden by a stack of
 old, sun-bleached wooden barrels.   Overhead, you can see your
 bedsheet, flapping in the wind from where it's still attached to the
 drainpipe.
   You can squeeze through an opening between two boards in the side of
 the saloon.

 Your hotel room
   Not too fancy, but then you get what you pay for.  A bed with a
 mattress that was, as you vaguely remember it, rather wooden.  A wash
 basin and mirror along one wall.  Curtains open, revealing the single
 small window and Main Street below.
   Through the open curtains, you can see your bedsheet fluttering from

 Upstairs hallway
   Rooms on all sides of the landing--their doors closed and probably
 locked.  The stairs go back downstairs to the saloon.

>go down

 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel
   Sunlight glares in through the swinging saloonesque doors, only to be
 swallowed up by the murkiness inside.  Tables and chairs, barstools
 along the long counter, and a room-length mirror behind the bar.
 There's a horseshoe tacked to the wall, too.  Stairs go up to the hotel
 rooms on the second floor.  The billiards room, such as it is, is in
 the northwest corner.
   Grady is behind the bar.

 Grady pulls out a cloth and polishes up the bar a little.

>show sheet to grady
 Grady doesn't seem too interested in the bedsheet.

>go west

 Main Street
   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
 town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
 the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
 here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
 Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.

 Old Dan arrives from the north.

>go south

 South end of Main Street
   Standing here in the middle of Main Street, you are directly across
 from the Tumbleweed Flats Sheriff's Department, which is directly to
 the east.  Not the safest place to hang out, perhaps, considering that
 the gallows are right on the other side of the street--and you might as
 well try and avoid that particular inevitability for as long as
 possible.  Might be a better idea to head north, back up Main Street.

   The fiery red stallion is standing patiently nearby.

 To walk, you will have to get off of the fiery red stallion.
 Otherwise, try "ride" or "gallop" and a direction.

 Edge of town, on a fiery red stallion
   You can still see Tumbleweed Flats behind you where the road curves
 around from the south.  A dead, rotted tree stands here, marking the

 The tree is now gray and rotted.  It marks the point where the road

 End of the road, on a fiery red stallion
   The dusty road stretches back to the west as far as the eye can see,
 and then some.  A steep bank rises up to the southeast; you can't see
 what might be at the top of it.
   Sarah is here.
   Sarah's Arabian is here, snacking contentedly on a small patch of
 grass.

>dismount
 You get off of the fiery red stallion.

>show bottle to sarah
 "Oh, great.  So what, you're going to drink that and get all fired up
 for being a hero?  Lucky me."

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.  (Although you sound rather positive.)

>give bottle to sarah
 "No thanks.  Although God knows we could both probably use it."  She
 takes a look at you.  Has second thoughts.  "Well, maybe not both of
 us."

>drink bottle
 The piece of cloth is in the way.

>se

 Top of a steep bank
   From the top of this incline, you can look back to see the dusty road
 stretching out of sight to the west.  Over the crest of the hill, you
 can see the Heffer ranch house to the south--quite an impressive sight,
 to be honest.  A hayfield opens up to the east.
   Standing guarding the front of the house is Glen Heffer's
 mean-looking henchman Large Duane.  Lucky for you he can't see you.

 Sarah scrambles up the bank after you.  "I hope you know what you're
 doing," she says.

>throw bottle at hay
 You pitch the bottle into the hayfield, where it lands with a dull
 thud.

>go east

 Hayfield
   Standing amidst the scattered golden haystacks drying in the hot sun.
 In fact, the hay is so dry it crackles under your feet as you step on
 it.  From here, you can either go back west where you came from, or
 southwest toward the Heffer ranch house.
   A whiskey bottle is here.

 Sarah follows you into the hayfield.  "What are you doing over here?"
 she asks.

>shout
 You let out a hearty bellow.  Nothing else happens.

>get bottle
 Taken.

>ask sarah about money
 You haven't seen anything like that.

>ask sarah about dollar
 You haven't seen anything like that.

>ask sarah for money
 You haven't seen anything like that.

>score
 As in, you'd like to know how you're doing, right?

 Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self
 defense.  And while you did break into Grady's liquor stash, that
 doesn't really count as being productive.  It would also be interesting
 to see who would think highly of your stealing Little Jimmy's candy.

 On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel
 room unnoticed.  And putting together that plan to steal Stratford's
 stallion showed at least a little ingenuity.  Plus, if it weren't so
 seedy and practically dishonest, having wits enough to bamboozle Grady
 with a weed looking like a four-leaf clover would almost be
 commendable.

 That's what you've managed to get done so far.  Being generally
 disruptive, that is.

 That doesn't make any sense.

 In retrospect, maybe all that cheap whiskey last night in Grady's
 wasn't such a brilliant idea.  Not the way the evil, glowing orb of the
 morning sun is burning a hole through your squinting eyes and right
 into the back of your head.  And especially since there's a guy with a
 six-shooter on his belt, ready to draw, standing thirty feet away and
 facing you.  Your body keeps screaming at you that you should still be
 in bed.  The dimly lit cage of your memory tells you that all of this
 has something to do with you standing up for some woman in the saloon
 last night, and right now you wish like hell you could remember.

 No one ever said you were lucky, but you are...

 In retrospect, maybe all that cheap whiskey last night in Grady's
 wasn't such a brilliant idea.  Not the way the evil, glowing orb of the
 morning sun is burning a hole through your squinting eyes and right
 into the back of your head.  And especially since there's a guy with a
 six-shooter on his belt, ready to draw, standing thirty feet away and
 facing you.  Your body keeps screaming at you that you should still be
 in bed.  The dimly lit cage of your memory tells you that all of this
 has something to do with you standing up for some woman in the saloon
 last night, and right now you wish like hell you could remember.

 No one ever said you were lucky, but you are...

 (New players should type "help".)

 Main Street
   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
 town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
 the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
 here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
 Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.

 Roy Heffer is standing in front of you, his right hand dangling over
 his holster, fingers twitching nervously.  Somewhere in the distance,
 someone strums an out-of-tune Spanish guitar.

>y
 Better start with a verb.

>draw
 You pull your six-shooter out of your holster.

>shoot roy
 You beat Roy to the trigger, shooting him through the heart just as he
 is aiming at yours.  (And surprising yourself while you're at it that
 your old gun hit him--your aim must've been off.)  Roy gasps, drops his
 gun, and falls to the ground, dead.

>examine corpse
 Dead as a doornail, as they say.  In a few minutes he'll be too stiff
 to move.  Roy's gun is lying in the dirt where he dropped it when you
 shot him.

 Old Dan arrives from the south.

 (Old Dan has to make an effort to swagger around Roy's body.)

>get all from corpse
 Nothing to get.

>rob corpse
 You can't use the word "rob".

>examine pants
>examine corpse
 You don't see that.

 Dead as a doornail, as they say.  In a few minutes he'll be too stiff
 to move.  Roy's gun is lying in the dirt where he dropped it when you
 shot him.

>examine pockets
 You can't use the word "pockets".

>search roy
 Roy wasn't exactly a tiny guy.  You're not having the best of luck
 moving him.

 A crowd starts to gather around you and the corpse.

>get money from corpse
 You haven't seen anything like that.

>look under roy
 Roy wasn't exactly a tiny guy.  You're not having the best of luck
 moving him.

 More people come out onto the street to see what happened.  They see
 the body.  Some of them point at you and begin talking to each other in
 low voices.

 Little Jimmy comes running past you from the north.  He stops for a
 second, looks at Roy's stiff, and raises his eyebrows.  "Oooh.  Dead
 guy."

>move roy
 Roy wasn't exactly a tiny guy.  You're not having the best of luck
 moving him.

 Bobby comes running after Little Jimmy.

 You hear someone saying to you:  "Look, partner.  I dunno what your
 beef with ole Roy here was, but you best be getting outta here before
 the Sheriff shows up."

 Little Jimmy goes running off to the south.

>push roy
 Pushing Roy Heffer's body doesn't get you anywhere.

 Bobby chases off after Little Jimmy.

 Old Dan heads off to the east.

>search corpse
 Roy wasn't exactly a tiny guy.  You're not having the best of luck
 moving him.

 Little Jimmy comes running past you from the south.  He stops for a
 second, looks at Roy's stiff, and raises his eyebrows.  "Oooh.  Dead

 Old Dan arrives from the east.

 (Old Dan has to make an effort to swagger around Roy's body.)

>shoot dan
 You pull the trigger, and--CLICK.  Your six-shooter is empty.

>ask dan about roy
 "Once in a while Roy'd buy me drink or something.  Didja have to go and
 kill him, of all people?"

 Bobby comes running after Little Jimmy.

 Little Jimmy goes running off to the north.

>get roy's gun
 Taken.

 Bobby chases off after Little Jimmy.

 Old Dan heads off to the west.

>shoot dan with it
 (Assuming you mean Roy's gun.)
 Old Dan isn't here.

   Old Dan, the town drunk, is here, standing in place and swaying

 Old Dan helps you heft Roy's body a foot or two to one side.

 Roy must've dropped his wallet in the dust when you plugged him.  You
 take it.  (What the hell--you already killed the guy.)  Old Dan looks
 at you expectantly.

 Bobby chases off after Little Jimmy.

>save
 Enter saved game to store:

 Saved.

>get all
 Roy Heffer's body:  Only if you want to be spotted carting a dead body
 around town.  Not recommended.
 gathering crowd:  You can't take that.
 Roy's gun:  Taken.
 Old Dan:  Old Dan probably wouldn't be too big on that idea.

>go east

 Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel
   Sunlight glares in through the swinging saloonesque doors, only to be
 swallowed up by the murkiness inside.  Tables and chairs, barstools
 along the long counter, and a room-length mirror behind the bar.
 There's a horseshoe tacked to the wall, too.  Stairs go up to the hotel
 rooms on the second floor.  The billiards room, such as it is, is in
 the northwest corner.
   Grady is behind the bar.

 Grady studies you as you come in.  "Plannin' on paying your bill
 anytime soon?"

>examine wallet
 Calfskin.  Nice.  Monogrammed with "R.H."  It's closed.

>open it
 (Assuming you mean Roy's wallet.)
 Opened.

 Inside the wallet are a quarter and a dollar bill.

>give bill to grady
 (taking the dollar bill first)
 Taken.

 Grady refuses.  "You come back with some real money, 'fores I boot your
 dusty butt outta here."

>examine dollar
 Good old legal tender, emblazoned with the seal of the Union.

 You watch under the swinging doors as several sets of boots show up.
 The Sheriff's deputies have come looking for you.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go up

 Upstairs hallway
   Rooms on all sides of the landing--their doors closed and probably
 locked.  The stairs go back downstairs to the saloon.

>go west
 The room door is locked.

>unlock door
 (with the skeleton key)
 Unlocked.

>go west
 As you open the door, it bangs against an empty whiskey bottle that had
 rolled against it.  The bottle skitters away into the corner of the
 room.

 Your hotel room
   Not too fancy, but then you get what you pay for.  A bed with a
 mattress that was, as you vaguely remember it, rather wooden.  A wash
 basin and mirror along one wall.  Curtains closed, covering the single
 small window.
   Looks like someone slipped a piece of paper under the door while you
 were out.
   In the corner of the room is a whiskey bottle, empty and discarded.

>get sheet and bottle and note
 You haven't seen anything like that.

>examine bed
 Looking at the bed doesn't bring back any fond memories of comfortable
 sleep.  The bedsheet is still in a crumpled heap at the foot of the
 bed.

>get sheet and bottle and note
 bedsheet:  Taken.
 whiskey bottle:  Taken.
 handwritten note:  Taken.

>open curtain. open window. tie sheet to drainpipe. climb sheet
 Opened.  Through the closed window you can just peek around the corner
 of the hotel enough to see Main Street below.  You see a gang of
 deputies waiting in front of the saloon--waiting for you, that is.

 Opened.

 You tie the bedsheet to the drainpipe.

 As you climb down the bedsheet, it starts to rip.  One small piece of
 cloth tears away and flutters down below you.

 Narrow alley
   Running along the north side of Grady's--the old wall of the building
 is directly behind you.  Grady's storage shed is just to the north, and
 Main Street is back out to the west.  You're well hidden by a stack of
 old, sun-bleached wooden barrels.   Overhead, you can see your
 bedsheet, flapping in the wind from where it's still attached to the
 drainpipe.
   The small piece of cloth from the bedsheet is lying on the ground.

>get cloth. get plank
 Taken.

 It's attached to the side of the saloon.

>pull plank
 With a grunt, you yank the board free from the side of the saloon.  It
 falls to the ground with a dull clatter, revealing an opening leading
 southeast into the wall.

>get it
 (Assuming you mean the wooden plank.)
 Taken.

>se

 Grady's liquor stash
   In the dim light from the alleyway, you can make out the outlines of
 several shelves of crates and bottles, as well as a heavy door
 which--you guess--leads out into the billiards room.  Sitting in the
 shadows in the corner is a big wooden keg.

>fill bottle from keg
 That doesn't make any sense.

>fill bottle
 You fill the bottle with Grandma Grady's Wicked XXX.

>put cloth in bottle. nw
 You stuff the piece of cloth into the opening of the bottle.

>go northwest

 Narrow alley
   You can squeeze through an opening between two boards in the side of
 the saloon.

>go west
 You find a foothold on the stack of barrels and clamber over.

 North end of Main Street
   Now leaving the bustling metropolis of Tumbleweed Flats, pop. 59.
 The local stable is off to the northwest, just north of an empty field.
 To the east is the north end of the hotel, although it doesn't look
 like you'd be able to get by the stack of crates and barrels.  A dusty
 road continues north out of town.
   To the south, you can see a gang of deputies lounging around outside
 Grady's Saloon--presumably waiting for you.
   Little Jimmy is here, cheerfully chomping on some sticky taffy.

 Bobby comes running after Little Jimmy.

>get taffy
 Little Jimmy bawls as you grab his candy.  "Give me back my taffy!
 Gimme gimme!" he hollers as he stamps his feet.

>kick jimmy
 Venting your frustrations on Little Jimmy won't accomplish much.

>go northwest
 (opening the heavy stable door first)
 With a grunt, you heave the stable door open.

 Stable
   Smells musty, just like every other stable you've ever been in.
 There's a meager half-light drifting down from a window in the loft
 overhead, and the stable door leads back out onto Main Street to the
 southeast.  If anybody in this town owned a horse, this is where they'd
 keep it.
   The gate to one of the stalls to the north is closed.

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

>wait
 Time passes...

 A woman slips into the stable behind you.  She stands off to the side,
 almost in the shadows, regarding you warily.  She looks vaguely
 familiar.

 The woman seems relieved.  "Good.  I wasn't sure if you'd actually
 come," she says.

 She goes to the stable door and looks outside, making sure that the two
 of you are alone before she closes it.

 Do you want to keep waiting (YES or NO)?
>go north

>ask sarah about the future of our relationship
 You can't use the word "future".

>ask sarah about sarah
 The strangely familiar woman would probably rather not talk about
 herself.

 "That must mean you remember what I told you last night in Grady's,
 right?  About Glen Heffer?  I mean before his bastard son showed up and
 started causing trouble."

 That's when it hits you:  this is the woman for whose honor--directly
 or indirectly--you ended up in a gunfight this morning.  Sarah or
 Sandra or Samantha or something like that.  Sarah.  That's right:
 Sarah.  Whew.  Nice memory on you.

>ask sarah about glen
 "I guess he can add kidnapper and blackmailer to his list of
 accomplishments, right after thief, murderer, and son-of-a-bitch."

>ask sarah about me
 Hopefully you know as much as anyone.

 Sarah looks at you skeptically again.  "Okay.  Here's what you have to
 do," she says.  "You have a horse, right?  I mean, I'm assuming you do.
 If you don't, you'll have to get yourself one.  I guess I just figure
 any cowboy worth his weight in dust has a horse.  You know the road
 going east just north of town?  Ride east, all the way to the end.
 You'll know when you're there because you'll find me waiting for you."

>ask sarah about uncle
 You haven't seen anybody like that.

>ask sarah about roy
 "Last night in Grady's?  Last night Roy knew exactly what I was talking
 about, about Uncle Bucky.  Today?  Well, today I'm glad you shot him."

 Sarah's face softens a little, and some of her tough facade fades away.

 "Look, I don't know if you're a hero or just not very smart or what.
 It was more than enough that you stood up for me against Roy.  Now
 this.  It's probably more than I can ask, but...thank you."

>ask sarah about bucky
 "He may be a little strange, but, hey, he's my uncle, and he's dear to
 me--and it's not just because he's got a lot of money.  But I'm not
 going to let that rotten snake Glen Heffer force me into coming up with
 ransom money--Uncle Bucky wouldn't want that."

>tell sarah about roy
 Sarah doesn't seem particularly interested in what you have to say
 about Roy Heffer.

>tell sarah about me
 Sarah doesn't seem particularly interested in what you have to say
 about you.

>tell sarah about horse
 Sarah doesn't seem particularly interested in what you have to say
 about the horseshoe.

>kiss sarah
 She pushes you away.  "Hey, hayseed.  I don't know what you think
 you've got coming for helping me out, but if that's it, you can just
 forget it."

>feel sarah
 Fiddling with Sarah probably isn't the best use of your time at the
 moment.

>fiddle while hay burns
 You can't use the word "fiddle".

 Empty lot
   Standing where you are, in the middle of a thicket of weeds, you're
 faced by a wall of impenetrable brush to the north.  Just to the right
 of the trees, to the northeast, is the entrance the local stable.  Back
 east is Main Street.

 Pulling the thicket of weeds doesn't get you anywhere.

>pull weed
 Pulling the thicket of weeds doesn't get you anywhere.

>pluck weed
 You're not holding that.

 hands before hauling you back to your feet.  Time to go see the
 Sheriff...

   Grady is behind the bar.
   Old Dan, the town drunk, is here, standing in place and swaying

 Old Dan heads off to the west.

 He gives you grouchy look as he goes.

>give clover to grady
 "A four-leaf clover?  For me?  I ...well, I don't know what to say.
 Maybe this'll turn my luck around.  Maybe I misjudged you."  And with
 that, Grady takes the weed from you.

>ask grady for shed key
 "You want to get into that old shed?  Nothing but junk in there," Grady
 says.  But then he shrugs and digs out the key anyway, putting it down
 on the counter.

 Grady pulls out a cloth and polishes up the bar a little.

 Grady's storage shed
   It's dark in here.  The only light bleeds in through the window and
 the open door.  Looks like this is where Grady keeps most of his junk.
   Resting on the ground against one wall is a ten-foot wooden ladder.

>get ladder
 You're carrying too much to take that.

>inventory
 You are wearing your holster on your hip where it belongs.  You are
 holding a whiskey bottle.  Some of Grandma Grady's Wicked XXX is
 sloshing around inside the whiskey bottle.  A scrap of cloth is stuffed
 in the mouth of the bottle.  You are also carrying two keys (a skeleton
 key and the shed key), two pistols (your six-shooter and Roy's gun),
 Roy's wallet, a dollar bill, a handwritten note, a wooden plank, and
 some sticky taffy.  Inside the wallet is a quarter.

 You lean the ladder against the loft, just where the hayloft begins.


 Sitting in the hayloft
   About ten or so feet off the stable floor.  Too far to jump--better
 to make wise use of the ladder which is still leaning against the wall.
 Sunlight shines in through a small square window.

 You can't go that way.

>go down

 Stable
   Smells musty, just like every other stable you've ever been in.
 There's a meager half-light drifting down from a window in the loft
 overhead, and the stable door leads back out onto Main Street to the
 southeast.  If anybody in this town owned a horse, this is where they'd
 keep it.
   The gate to one of the stalls to the north is closed.

 Perched on the top branch of an oak tree
   In the manner of a crow or vulture or some other sort of
 top-branch-perching bird.  The loft window is behind you, technically
 to the southeast, while the ground is perilously far below.

>d. w
 Down, you say?  Well, you begin to shimmy down the tree, precariously
 clutching onto branches and outcroppings of tough bark--whatever you
 can reach.  Finally, scraped and bruised all to hell, you find yourself
 on firm ground.

 Hidden meadow
   Obviously not a popular picnic spot; in fact, if not for your vantage
 point perched atop the tree, you would never have known it was here,
 much less be able to blindly navigate your way through the thick of
 trees to the south.  The meadow opens up to the west.
   Strutting proudly around the meadow is a fiery red stallion.


 Front porch
   Of a mansion, or what might be considered a mansion if it weren't
 quite so rustic looking.  It's as if someone took a giant tub of Dr.
 Ricardo's Growth Tonic (which he peddles to the unsuspecting populace
 whenever he's in town, about every four months or so) and poured it
 over one of the ramshackle houses--albeit one of the nicer
 ones--scattered about Tumbleweed Flats.  You can enter the house to the
 west.
   John Stratford is sitting in his rocking chair, smoking his pipe.
 His trusty shotgun is across his lap.

 that I do so love this taffy?"  He munches on the candy.

 You get on the fiery red stallion.

 You give the red stallion a couple of pokes in its sides with your
 spurs, and the animal breaks into a trot.  A couple of seconds later,
 however, an old man in an ascot and a mop of gray hair (John Stratford,
 that is) comes chasing after you from the west.

 He tries to shout something at you, but his mouth is gummed up with
 taffy.  The same goes for his fingers, which are useless so far as
 pulling the trigger on the shotgun he is aiming at you.

 Your parched brain tries as hard as it possibly can to remember what
 the path through the trees looked like from above, and you start
 forging a path...

 Empty lot, on a fiery red stallion
   Standing where you are, in the middle of a thicket of weeds, you're
 faced by a wall of impenetrable brush to the north.  Just to the right

 Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self
 defense.  And while you did break into Grady's liquor stash, that
 doesn't really count as being productive.  It would also be interesting
 to see who would think highly of your stealing Little Jimmy's candy.

 On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel
 room unnoticed.  And putting together that plan to steal Stratford's
 stallion showed at least a little ingenuity.  Plus, if it weren't so
 seedy and practically dishonest, having wits enough to bamboozle Grady
 with a weed looking like a four-leaf clover would almost be
 commendable.

 That's what you've managed to get done so far.  Being generally
 disruptive, that is.

 their way here from the wild.  Lots of ivory, skins, furs--the marks of
 a big-game hunter.  Also lots of weapons, which probably explains the
 preponderance in this room of guys with guns--Heffer's hired guns, to
 be exact--who sit around cleaning, reloading, and talking about
 cleaning and reloading and shooting.

 The hired guns look up as you come in; hell, they're as surprised as
 you are.  But they quickly get over it and respond with the clicking of
 pistol hammers, the whoosh-clack of shotgun loading, and the KABLAM! of

 entrance hall to the north; going south will take you out the back door
 to the rear of the house.

 Sitting in a chair is an old man, cheerful despite the fact that his
 hands are tied with coarse rope.  He's having the business end of a
 pistol brandished at him by another man--Glen Heffer, by his
 resemblance to the late Roy.

 Sarah comes into the living room after you and spies the bound man.
 "Uncle Bucky!"  Then she sees Heffer, and snarls:  "You withered old
 son of a bitch..."

 Heffer leaps to his feet and yanks Uncle Bucky roughly to his feet.
 The two of them make a break for the back door--Heffer running and
 towing a stumbling Bucky behind him.  The door slams behind them.

 pistol.  A rule of thumb for the next life:  Never open a door behind
 which is waiting someone who wants to kill you.

>go up

 Living room
   A giant fireplace takes up most of the east wall.  Typical
 living-room furniture and adornments decorate the room--although these
 are perhaps a little nicer than usual.  The room opens up to the
 entrance hall to the north; going south will take you out the back door
 to the rear of the house.
   Sarah is here.

>go north

 Inside the house
   This is the front hallway or foyer or entrance or whatever you want
 to call it.  The front door is behind you to the north.  The house
 opens up into the east wing to the east and the west wing to the west.
 (Mental note:  you can hear voices coming from either wing).  Going
 straight south will take you through to the living room, and it looks
 like the kitchen is off to the southwest--you can see pots, pans, and a
 cast-iron stove through the archway.

 Sarah follows you back to the front entrance.  "Are you lost?" she
 asks.

>go southwest

 Kitchen
   It's a kitchen large enough to prepare grub for the Heffer family and
 all Glen Heffer's hired help--what most people in Tumbleweed Flats call
 hired guns.  (And you might want to count the Heffer ranch-house cook
 among your supporters.  After all, you did lighten his workload by
 one.)  There's a big cast-iron stove over to one side, and a huge array
 of pots and pans and other dishes in various stages of use, being used,
 and getting ready to be used again.  Walking north will take you
 straight into the west wing, while northeast leads back to the main
 entrance.  South continues right on out the back door.

 "What are we doing in the kitchen?" Sarah asks, following you
 nonetheless.

>go south

 Behind the ranch house
   The back door and the kitchen door lead back into the house to the
 north and northwest, respectively.  From here, you can look out over
 the steep bank you originally came up--almost a cliff, really--at the
 bottom of which are two horses:  yours and Sarah's.
   Glen Heffer is here, alternately waving his pistol menacingly back
 and forth between you and Uncle Bucky, whom he's got by the collar.

 Sarah follows after you.

 Heffer levels the barrel of his gun betwixt your eyes.

>shoot glen with roy's gun
 You take aim at Old Man Heffer and--

 --miss!  Your bullet comes close enough to rustle old Glen's hair, but
 it misses just the same.  Unluckily for you, Glen himself is unruffled
 enough to return the favor and send some lead in your direction.  Three
 shots.

 But he misses, too.

 Glen's bullets send you dancing out of the way, almost diving into the
 dirt.  And then Sarah lifts up her pistol and cleanly puts Glen Heffer
 away.  His body hits the ground with a thud.  Uncle Bucky is still
 standing there, hands bound, face white, and eyes wide.  "Sarah,
 honey..." he says.

 Sarah turns to look at you.  "Now what?" she asks.  "Are you going to
 get us out of here?"

>save
 Enter saved game to store:
>cf12
 Saved.

>jump
 You leap over the cliff and into the open air.  Looking down, you can
 see your horse below you.  You sight your target between your legs as
 you fall--

 --PLUNK!  Right in the saddle.

 End of the road, on a fiery red stallion
   The dusty road stretches back to the west as far as the eye can see,
 and then some.  A steep bank rises up to the southeast; you can't see
 what might be at the top of it.
   Sarah's Arabian is here, snacking contentedly on a small patch of
 grass.

>wait
 Time passes...

>ride w
 The red stallion gallops along, and before too long delivers you safely
 to the west end of the long, dusty road.

 Edge of town, on a fiery red stallion
   You can still see Tumbleweed Flats behind you where the road curves
 around from the south.  A dead, rotted tree stands here, marking the
 memory of the last living thing between here and where the road
 disappears into the eastern distance.

>ride e

 Long and dusty road, on a fiery red stallion
   Brambles and cactuses all over the place.  Some might call it the
 desert.  Not all that lucky for you, seeing as you're wandering around
 in the middle of it.

>get off
 You get off of the fiery red stallion.

>se
 You can't go that way.

>get on horse
 You get on the fiery red stallion.

>ride e
 The red stallion gallops along without faltering, eating up the
 distance, Tumbleweed Flats disappearing far behind you.

 End of the road, on a fiery red stallion
   The dusty road stretches back to the west as far as the eye can see,
 and then some.  A steep bank rises up to the southeast; you can't see
 what might be at the top of it.
   Sarah's Arabian is here, snacking contentedly on a small patch of

 You get off of the fiery red stallion.

 Top of a steep bank
   From the top of this incline, you can look back to see the dusty road
 stretching out of sight to the west.  Over the crest of the hill, you
 can see the Heffer ranch house to the south--quite an impressive sight,
 to be honest.  A hayfield opens up to the east.
   Standing guarding the front of the house is Glen Heffer's
 mean-looking henchman Large Duane.  Lucky for you he can't see you.

>go south

 Front of the Heffer ranch house
   Nice building, no doubt the product of years of ill-gotten gains.
 Directly south of you is the front door, which is open wide.  You can
 backtrack to the top of the steep bank to the north, or go northeast
 into the hayfield.
   Large Duane is here, looking large and mean.

 Large Duane looks up as you come near.  His eyes narrow, and he quickly
 draws his gun and sends you off to Cowboy Heaven.  What the hell were
 you thinking, stomping on up to him like that?  Doesn't matter.

 the steep bank you originally came up--almost a cliff, really--at the
 bottom of which are two horses:  yours and Sarah's.
   Uncle Bucky is here, looking stunned and bewildered.
   Sarah is here.
   Glen Heffer is lying dead on the ground here.

>examine glen
 You peer long and hard at old man Heffer's body, but he doesn't move.
 Not even a twitch.  Definitely dead.

>search glen
 You don't find anything.

>sarah, move glen
 Sarah ignores you.

>examine bucky
 A short, rather rotund little fella, with a big ole straw hat on his
 noggin.  He tends to look around with sort of a stunned look on his
 face.  That and a big smile--the kind that just says:  "Howdy!"  His
 hands are bound behind his back by some coarse rope.

>untie bucky
 Trying to untie Uncle Bucky doesn't get you anywhere.

>untie rope
 You'll never get the rope untied--it's knotted too tightly.

>shoot rope
 You can't shoot (buckyrope).

>inventory
 You are wearing your holster on your hip where it belongs.  You are
 also carrying Roy's wallet, Roy's gun, a wooden plank, a trail kit, and
 a spoon.  Tucked in your holster is your six-shooter.Inside the wallet
 is a quarter.The trail kit contains a matchbook, a fork, and some beef
 jerky.

>cut rope with fork
 You're not holding that.

>cut rope with spoon
 A destructive and somewhat less than completely useful course of
 action.

>shoot rope with roy's gun
 You can't shoot (buckyrope).

>sarah, untie bucky
 Sarah ignores you.

 Behind the ranch house
   The back door and the kitchen door lead back into the house to the
 north and northwest, respectively.  From here, you can look out over
 the steep bank you originally came up--almost a cliff, really--at the
 bottom of which are two horses:  yours and Sarah's.
   Uncle Bucky is here, looking stunned and bewildered.
   Sarah is here.
   Glen Heffer is lying dead on the ground here.

>ask bucky about sarah
 "Oh, Sarah's a nice girl.  I mean, comin' to rescue me and all.
 Oh--and you, too.  Thanks a lot there, pardner."

 You give Uncle Bucky a friendly shove, and he tumbles over the edge of
 the steep bank.

 "What are you doing?" Sarah exclaims, as she rushes forward.  Then she
 stops.  "Oh," she says.  You peek over the edge beside her.  Uncle
 Bucky is sitting square in the middle of Sarah's saddle, some thirty
 feet or more below.

 Sarah shrugs.  "Here goes."  Then she hops over the edge and follows
 Bucky down.

 Suddenly Large Duane bursts in on the two of you.  "You!" he shouts,
 pointing at you, of course.  "You show up, cook the hayfield, trick me
 into running around like a fool, come in here, do in my boss..."

 He pauses.  "Aw, to hell with it," he mutters.  "Yer just too much damn
 trouble."

 With that, Large Duane pulls back the hammer on his pistol, points it
 right at you, and pulls the trigger.

 End of the road, on a fiery red stallion

 what might be at the top of it.
   Sarah is on her horse, with Uncle Bucky perched precariously in the
 saddle behind her.

 Sarah gives you an approving nod.  "Nice one," she says.

>ride w
 You dig in the spurs and gallop westward along the road back to
 Tumbleweed Flats.  Sarah races after you, with Uncle Bucky, his hands
 still tied, bouncing helplessly on the saddle behind her.  Looks like a
 rescue, cowboy.

 You pass across a wide mesa and slow to a stop.  Time for a
 well-deserved rest.  Sarah rides up behind you, and both she and Uncle
 Bucky dismount.  You stand there sihouetted by the light of the Western
 sunset, the four of you:  you, Sarah, Bucky, and a cactus.

 So, how did you do?  Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer,
 it was in self defense.  And while you did break into Grady's liquor
 stash, that doesn't really count as being productive.  It would also be
 interesting to see who would think highly of your stealing Little
 Jimmy's candy.  You've also managed to completely torch a hayfield.
 That's something, isn't it?

 On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel
 room unnoticed.  And putting together that plan to steal Stratford's
 stallion showed at least a little ingenuity.  Plus, if it weren't so
 seedy and practically dishonest, having wits enough to bamboozle Grady
 with a weed looking like a four-leaf clover would almost be
 commendable.  Maybe you deserve some points for managing to construct a
 bomb out of an empty whiskey bottle and the most volatile hootch on the
 planet.  (Or maybe not.)  But maybe it's the score that tells the story
 in the end--you:  2, the Heffer family:  0.

 So somewhere along the way you managed to become a genuine Western
 hero, up there with John Wayne and Roy Rogers and the best of them--no
 small feat, that.
