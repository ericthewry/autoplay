 The most important discovery in history. And then, the whole world
 goes crumbling down. The doomsday clock has begun ticking...


 Andromeda Awakening was originally written for the IFComp2011. As the
 first work of IF by the author, it placed 17th among 37 more
 competitors. Its large scale world and the long story, in the opinion
 of many, deserved a different approach and a wider gameplay
 experience. So, Release 3 (the Final Cut) was designed.

 The most substantial changes are represented by a wider beginning
 sequence, the implementation of a handful additional scenery and
 trivia in the middle-game, a full new area in the end-game, along with
 a slight polish of the writing and a few meta-commands to facilitate
 the walkthrough.


 This is a sci-fi story. It is a tale about mortality, wisdom,
 civilization and history, maybe. But, most of all, it's a story about
 a guy who unintentionally finds himself with the cosmic steering-wheel
 in his own hands.

 This game accepts an easier traveling method than the regular
 room-by-room walk. You can just GO TO a visited location to run there
 at once (unless the path is not interrupted somehow). This will be
 specifically useful in some parts of the game.

 Another sensible command is EXITS. It lists all the available exits in
 a location at any given time. As soon as new routes are opened, they
 are listed, also.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Andy's Apartment</span>
 A bed, a table, a bathroom. This is all that's left of your colleague,
 Professor Re's. Some dust, an eerie atmosphere and just a memory.

>examine dust

 Light fills in from the blinded windows. Dust flies in the sunrays
 like snow in a torment.

>examine memory

 You can't see any such thing.

 Certainly, though, you can smell it and listen to it.

>smell memory

 Along with Andy, has gone his scent. All that remains is the noisy
 pout-pourri of the exotic food he'd like to eat, along with the odor
 of root beer and soda.

>listen to memory

 Silence is all that's left of Andy, and it's much more than anything
 else. He was so mouthy, sometimes. Hell, he was mouthy every damn
 minute, never closing that babbling gape, always inquiring about
 something, always trying to inspire faith in the others. Faith in
 science, that is. And faith in humanity as a worthy bunch.

 You hardly squeeze a smile. You will miss that gape. You will miss his
 faith.

>examine atmosphere

 Light fills in from the blinded windows. Dust flies in the sunrays
 like snow in a torment.

>examine me

 Getting fat. Getting old. Getting bald.

>examine me

 Getting fat. Getting old. Getting bald.

>inventory

 You're carrying an expired railway ticket, a magnetic card and an
 E-Pad.

>examine ticket

 A regular monthly railway ticket. The expiration date printed on it
 bears the yesterday's date.

>examine card

 A plastic card, with a black stripe on its back. On the front it bears
 a picture of you and your generalities.

>examine picture

 It is you, some time ago.

>examine generalities

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine e-pad

 A black slab, ten-by-twenty centimeters. A surface, the one you would
 refer to as "the bottom", is made out of vibertron alloy. The "top"
 side is a psychoglass vibertron that you can use to gather
 information. The E-Pad is indeed the ultimate resource for any kind of
 question: you can consult it about almost anything (that you have
 previously uploaded into it, of course). Think to it as some kind of
 Guide to the galaxy.

>examine bed

 That's where you've had your final sleep. The blankets are a mess,
 even if you lied over them. A troublesome sleep, indeed.

>examine top

 It is a psychoglass you would use to gather information simply by
 touching it.

>touch top

 It took seven minutes to upload all your records on the Pad. It would
 take several millennia just to browse through half of it. It's better
 if you try and consult it about something.

>look under bed

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine desk

 You can't see any such thing.

>search blankets

 You find nothing of interest.

>take blankets

 You sincerely hope the night just passed is the last you'll have to
 mess with this particular bed.

>examine table

 This is where Andy passed his sleepless nights, always studying
 something new, always focusing on pushing humanity forward.

 You can't but mourn at the loss this old world has suffered from his
 departure.

 On the table, you glance a folder with some files inside.

>consult e-pad about andy

 You wave your hand on the vibertron, mentally igniting its interior
 device. A blink of an eye later, the screen vibrates with a faint
 purple light.

 <span class="floydstyle em">User 5,834 of this device, bearing no significant difference</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">between all the other 5,833 before and the one after</span>.

>consult e-pad about me

 <span class="floydstyle em">You are user 5,835 of this device, bearing no significant</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">difference between all the other 5,834</span>.

>examine folder

 As you drop your eyes on the cerulean cover of the folder, your own
 writing jumps out almost new, as if someone else has inscribed on it
 the words: "Reports to the Council".

>read folder

 You know these files by heart: A report on the state of the crust
 substrates, and about the discoveries you've made there.

 Strolling through the pages, you fall deep into a sense of vertigo.
 The whole world starts spinning.
 Can you do it? Will you be able to go on with the plan, now that Andy
 has gone? Now that he's been--
 A single tear runs through your left cheek, substantial, heavy. When
 it dives from your skin you almost feel its burden leaving. A second
 later -- or maybe a millennia -- it hits the ground with a sounding
 <span class="floydstyle em">boom</span>.

 You can barely form his visage into your head, and he's been dead for
 just ten hours. The impression printed in your forehead is that of a
 pale face, no more anguish, no more tears. And that terrible wound, a
 hole ripped in his chest like a mole's burrow. That's how it looks
 when a bullet bangs out of you, taking skin, flesh and bones in a
 bloody firework. They shot him. In the back, and he wasn't even
 fleeing. The coroner said he may just have been walking unaware.

 Another tear jumps into the void. Another <span class="floydstyle em">boom</span>.

 They were looking for these, the Reports.

 One reason more to go and show the committee. One reason more to cry
 the truth out loud.

>take folder

 Taken.

>go to bathroom

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>exits

 <span class="floydstyle em">[From here you can go west]</span>.

>examine bathroom

 A sink and a toilet, stocked in the far corner of the room.

>examine sink

 A sink and a toilet, stocked in the far corner of the room.

>examine toilet

 A sink and a toilet, stocked in the far corner of the room.

>open toilet

 That's not something you can open.

>search toilet

 You find nothing of interest.

>go west

 You leave the tiny room.

 On the door's sill, you pause and send one last glance to Andy's
 apartment. A new rush of tears threatens an escape and you barely
 suffocate it.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Andy,</span> you promise. <span class="floydstyle em">I will do it. I will do it for both of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">us. Whatever it is they are trying to hide -- whoever they are -- I</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">will find out. And the whole of Monarch will know. This I vow</span>.



 And, although you can't quite imagine it just now, no words will ever
 be truer than those.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Condominium</span>
 A foggy light comes from the grates on the top half of the stairwell.
 You are standing just mere feet from Andy's house entrance, above the
 first step going down.

>research monarch

 <span class="floydstyle em">Sixth planet in the trinary system, the biggest in size. Base of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the human activity in the Andromeda galaxy, is Capital World and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">headquarters of the ASA Council of the Thirteen. Age: 1.2bill. Size:</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Made up of thirteen members, it is the source of the ASA codex and of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the 237 Bounds</span>.

 You really think it's time to run to the Campus. You sight the exit,
 down from here.

>examine grates

 Yes, you rather had a regular window, but this is what comes with
 peripheral, low-cost buildings.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Exit</span>
 The faint lights get fainter here. A sturdy door opens on the Avenues,
 to the north. A flight of stairs moves up to the front door of Andy's
 Apartment.

>go north

 You leave the satisfying safety of the house with but a sigh. The
 massive vibertron door opens with no sound, and with no sound closes
 after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Avenues</span>
 The vivid pink of the Monarch sky paints an eternal dawn and washes
 the street and the buildings in a somewhat romantic nuance. The door
 to Andy's condominium lies south of here, reflecting the three suns
 like a gigantic kaleidoscope. The Avenue runs out of sight in every
 direction, finding outlets in a handful of other busy streets. The one
 you need runs east, towards the train station.

 <span class="floydstyle em">All these people,</span> you think, watching the passers-by as they
 crowd the streets in their random duties. <span class="floydstyle em">If only they knew,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">they'd scamper around like mad rats, biting at each other and feasting</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">on the corpses.</span>
 You hold more tightly to your Report files.

 The major sun -- Korhos -- seems to point its malevolent, cold finger
 at you.

>examine korhos

 The fiery halo around the biggest of the suns of Monarch sends spires
 of red spreading across space.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Avenues - East branch</span>
 Here the street forks in two different branches, one disappearing
 southeast into the train station, the other going on to the east. To
 the west lies Andy's house. The dark underground tunnel that leaves
 the street to the first underground floor, where your train is
 probably waiting, sends shivers down your spine.

 <span class="floydstyle em">There. The big underground empire. The place where all human fears</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">gather.</span>

 You pick up the Report files again, and look at their cover.

 What's the meaning of all this? What did you find down there that
 grips around your throat like a deathly lace every time you think
 about it? Is it the discovery itself, or maybe the fact that Andy was
 killed to prevent its disclosure? You never imagined being a nerd of a
 scientist would have given you so much anguish.

 You put back your burden and look up to the station's entrance. All
 will come in place, you hopefully consider. All will come in place.

>examine tunnel

 You can't see any such thing.

>se


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Fork Station</span>
 The cyanotic, vibrating light of the station stands as a formal
 counterweight to the usual pink of the open air. People from all the
 country crowd the hall, piling up like chickens in stocks. The loud
 whistle of the incoming and departing trains dopplers through the
 place and drills into your ears. The rails cut the earth in two,
 further south, while a more breathable atmosphere breaks in through
 the entrance, northwest from here.

 A steel gate stands between you and the trains. A ticket obliterator
 blinks silently at its side.

 On the west wall is a ticket vending machine.

>examine obliterator

 A tall figure, all in vibertron alloy, which is obviously there to
 read and authenticate tickets. A red laser scans the air inside a slot
 in its base.

>examine vending

 Cyanotic, like the rest of the enviroinment. It accommodates a
 magnetic card reader and a pocket for ticket delivery.

>put ticket in slot

 (the expired railway ticket in the obliterator)
 The obliterator blinks tiredly. A red exclamation mark appears on its
 glossy surface. You remove the ticket.

 With the corner of an eye, you catch a glimpse of yellow, shining
 among the people.

>examine yellow

 Ladies and gents from all around the trinary system crowd the tunnels
 of the South Fork station. They seem resolute and sturdy, each intent
 in finding the way into a new day.

 Among the rest of the unaware mob, you scout a single man, busy
 reading the railway map pinned to the wall.

>put card in card reader

 (the magnetic card in the magnetic card reader)
 You push the card into the reader. A second later, a red exclamation
 mark starts blinking on the vending machine and an unsympathetic,
 metallic voice informs all the people present that your "credit is
 exhausted".
 You try and take the card back, but the machine swallows it whole.

 And at this point, it just feels like it's too much.

 You fall on your knees, like an empty jute sack. The head dives
 between the shoulders, an empty face towards the ground beneath the
 legs. And the tears you so hardly tried to keep inside the dam begin
 rolling.

 <span class="floydstyle em">There is just no exit</span>, you realize, and a sense of doom
 overcomes you.
 There is no exit, no place to run to, no escape. The weight of the
 world is upon you and you can do nothing about it. Andy has been
 killed and he was the one with the wit and the strength to try and do
 something. In cases like this, he would have been the one to stroke
 your hair and spread hope. He would have been the one who said "Hey,
 man. Just relax. I'll be doing this."

 You sense the star-shattering future as too much for you to handle and
 give in, like a child who's been told his parents have just died.

 Then, something happens.

 A hand is dropped on your shoulder. An unfamiliar voice breathes in
 your ear, and all of a sudden you feel awake.
 You turn and face a man, one you never met before, and his
 understanding eyes. It's just a hand, still it feels like an
 invigorating shock.

 "It will be ok, man", he says. "Just relax".

 A second later, you are on your feet, your eyes following the stranger
 as he passes through the gates and into the railways.

>examine man

 You recognize the funny man as coming from the near Bom-Fong Satellite
 facility: his darker skin tone and his thin eyes betray his
 provenance. He wears a yellow coat that runs down to his feet. On his
 shoulders, he's carrying a purple backpack, the sort of which you
 usually see worn by the students at the University.

 From a pocket of the backpack you see poking a freshly printed ticket.

>take ticket

 (the new railway ticket)
 There's no way of getting it without startling its owner. You are not
 that used to stealing to be subtle enough. Maybe you'd need a
 diversion.

>examine map

 A map depicting the maze of rails connecting all the various stations
 in Monarch. With but a glance you find your route to the University.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Fork Station</span>
 The cyanotic, vibrating light of the station stands as a formal
 counterweight to the usual pink of the open air. People from all the
 country crowd the hall, piling up like chickens in stocks. The loud
 whistle of the incoming and departing trains dopplers through the
 place and drills into your ears. The rails cut the earth in two,
 further south, while a more breathable atmosphere breaks in through
 the entrance, northwest from here.

 A man wearing a funny yellow coat is reading the railways map,
 puzzled.

 A steel gate stands between you and the trains. A ticket obliterator
 blinks silently at its side.

 On the west wall is a ticket vending machine.

>examine backpack

 A purple backpack, the sort of which you usually see worn by the
 students at the University.

 From a pocket of the backpack you see poking a freshly printed ticket.

>examine gate

 A maze of sturdy steel bars, which runs from the floor to the ceiling.
 It looks <span class="floydstyle em">very</span> dense.

>exits

 <span class="floydstyle em">[From here you can go northwest and south, beyond the steel</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">gate]</span>.

>go south

 The gate stands closed between you and the rails.

>examine coat

 You recognize the funny man as coming from the near Bom-Fong Satellite
 facility: his darker skin tone and his thin eyes betray his
 provenance. He wears a yellow coat that runs down to his feet. On his
 shoulders, he's carrying a purple backpack, the sort of which you
 usually see worn by the students at the University.

 From a pocket of the backpack you see poking a freshly printed ticket.

>research bom-fong

 You discover nothing of interest in the E-Pad.

>research bom-fong satellite

 You discover nothing of interest in the E-Pad.

>research university

 <span class="floydstyle em">User 5,835 is chief researcher at the Radiations and Microwave</span>

>research diversion

 You discover nothing of interest in the E-Pad.

>yell

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to man

 "Need help?"

 The man turns to see you, a bit startled. "Uhm," he says, pointing at
 the map, "I'm just looking for the next stop in this... erm... maze."

>talk to man

 "I know, it's always a nightmare the first time you try and read one
 of those. Let me help."

 A fresh smile of relief paints his face, as the man moves a step to
 the left to let you check the map. In the movement, unseen, the ticket
 that was hanging from the open pocket of his backpack flies over the
 edge, landing a mere step from your right foot. You notice it but
 avoid dropping your sight to the ground.

>step on ticket

 (the new railway ticket)
 <span class="floydstyle em">Ok,</span> you are finally persuaded. <span class="floydstyle em">He won't need this as much</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">as I -- or the whole of Monarch -- do.</span>

 Subtly, you hide the fallen ticket under your foot, hoping to go
 unnoticed. And it works. The man follows your instructions on the map
 up to the last letter:

 "There, you know," you say, pointing at the map in the place where
 Cardinal Park would be. "There is the station you might look at for
 your departure, sir. South Fork is only southbound, and you have to go
 north.

 "It's just a couple of kilometers," you grin, depicting in your mind
 the Park, the farthest place in all Monarch to a railway.

 With a sigh, the man thanks you and heads out of the station. You grab
 the ticket and pitch the old, useless one.

>put ticket in slot

 (the new railway ticket in the obliterator)
 The obliterator blinks vigorously. A green exclamation mark appears on
 its glossy surface. The gate reacts with but a faint buzz. You remove
 the ticket.

>go south

 You pass through the gate which admits you, silently opening around
 you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Railways</span>
 You are standing by the bay of the railways, where trains arrive and
 depart. The light gets dimmer, here, but it is still strong enough to
 let you see the nearest surroundings. It then fades away in the
 intricate maze of the other platforms. A series of gates opens north
 into the main hall of South Fork Station. Through the bars you can see
 hundreds of people passing by, like ants in a sand castle.

 A deep sense of claustrophobia gets to your nerves as you stare at the
 long tunnels winding everywhere from this place. The intricate maze
 carves so deep and so far that now it could easily count more surface
 than on the open air...

 It digs so deep that you are quite certain it opened entrances -- or
 outages -- to things you'd better have seen left undisturbed. The
 Report files in your hands, the ones you are going to explain to your
 colleagues at the University, vibrate as if animate, trying to catch
 your attention.

 Your train is not here, yet. This could be a chance to study them
 again.

>examine files

 "Reports to the Council".

>read files

 You open the files at random. Your eye is quickly caught by one of the
 first reports:

 <span class="floydstyle em">(...)The volcanic crust separating what was once the glacial layer</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">from the lower halls cannot possibly be thick enough to hold those</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">energies at bay. Nor can it be trusted to keep a region larger than</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">one third of Monarch's surface area hidden from whatever may be</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">resting down there. In my humble opinion, the chances that former</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">colonizations could have gotten in there before the glacial age</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">(trapped? self-defending?) are quite high, especially now that we have</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">discovered the Alpha Radiation.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">In the end, we know nothing about Monarch before the first</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">settlements from the outer galaxies came into Andromeda more than one</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">thousand years ago. Technology back then was not sufficient to dig as</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">far as we have recently. The glacial layer was only partially melted</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and covered by the constructs. I suggest further investigation before</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">we start -- as we should -- to probe the source of the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">radiation.(...)</span>

 The thought of something ancient sleeping under your very feet is more
 than your mortal brain can handle.

 Eventually, your train arrives.

 The doors open silently and you enter its bright intestines with but a
 second thought, powerfully relieved by leaving the dark recesses of
 the underground rails.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Train</span>
 The wagon is enlightened by several fluorescent lamps, spanning along
 all its roof. The yellow, vibrating light paints each surface with the
 colors of death and decay. The train moves swiftly on its rails.

 A man sitting beside you is reading his newspaper.

>examine lights

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine lamps

 Tubes of light, inside tubes of glass.

>research alpha radiation

 <span class="floydstyle em">(Inserted by user 5,835 -- not present in general database)</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Radiation which pulsates from a specific point under Monarch's</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">kind of the Event residues. ----</span>.

>examine man

 He must be your age, a small man that looks like the average white
 collar worker from somewhere in the government. He's holding his
 newspaper like it was the only thing valuable in the world.

 You realize with surprise it is the same man who had the nice words at
 the vending machine, earlier.

 An unforeseen tremor shakes the train. You grab a handle before
 falling. The man beside you grips his seat.

 "Woha!" he laughs. "That was something."

 You notice small bits of the tunnel walls crumbling as you pass them
 by.

>examine newspaper

 The part you can see is about the weather and a few of other
 unimportant things.

>read it

 The part you can see is about the weather and a few of other
 unimportant things.

 A second, much stronger quake shakes the train. You are bounced once
 to the back, where you hit the doors with a faint sound, then forward.
 This time you go swimming through the air like some sort of flying
 fish.

 But it is not over.

 Another shock rocks the train to its core, sending it off the rails.
 Cracks like razor wounds open the car one by one, ripping it apart
 like a tube of crumpling paper. The windows shatter with a fierce
 <span class="floydstyle em">boom!</span> that grinds into your ears like a thousand needles. The
 next second, you are smashed against the end of the wagon, your head
 trying its resilience against solid steel.

 The last thing you see, before your eyes are closed forever, is the
 man who was reading his newspaper beside you being engulfed by a dark
 abyss that has opened under your feet -- and below the collapsing
 train --  like the maw of an ancient creature.
>push space
 Darkness begins to dissipate. It seems you are not dead, yet. Opening
 your eyes takes so much effort it feels like someone is sitting on
 them.

 All hell has broken loose. Before you, the fiery gates await.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wrecked Train</span>
 The gaping maw of the unknown opens a mere three meters from your
 face. Steel and iron are contorted everywhere, drawing a briar of
 thorny, crunching hands. The flames rise around the train, devouring
 everything. Cracks open in the walls of the wagon, now reduced to
 debris and crying people. To the south, a wider fissure seems large
 enough to let you pass, to safety.

 The man who was sitting beside you before the quake erupted is trapped
 under the wreckage of the seats and of the floor. He is screaming in
 pain.

>examine man

 He's trapped. There is no way of pulling him out of the wreckage.
 Blood is pouring violently from a wound in his chest, where an iron
 crank has opened a new way in.

 The train rattles and screams, slowly slipping further into the abyss
 where it is being inexorably pulled.

>talk to man

 "You will be fine," you say. "Soon enough help will come. I will stay
 here till then."

 You look out of the shattered glass of the train windows, hiding your
 sore eyes to the man you lied to with your last words.

 Another rattle and the wagon is pulled further into oblivion.

>exits

 <span class="floydstyle em">[From here you can go nowhere]</span>.

 The shrieking sound of metal against metal fills your ears as the last
 part of the train sinks. Another meter. One more shake and all will
 fall inside the open chasm.

>go south

 "Don't leave me," cries the trapped man. "Please!"


 One final, sinister noise shakes the wagon. Before you can understand
 what's happening, the weight of the rest of the train causes it all to
 fall into the enormous crack that opens below.

 You have just enough time to jump through the wide crack before it all
 disappears into darkness, landing to safety on a hard ledge.

 In the end, you fail to turn your eyes from those -- praying, pleading
 -- of the man trapped in the wreckage, his last goodbye a terrorized
 wailing into the unknown. You gaze into the blackness, speechless. The
 same words cycle into your forehead like a grinding echo: <span class="floydstyle em">It will</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">be ok. Just relax. It will be ok</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ledge</span>
 You are on a hard ledge, over a kilometers-deep chasm opening directly
 in front of you. There are no visible ways out, except for a trail cut
 in stone to the northwest. Now that the train has disappeared into
 oblivion, you realize there is no light, anywhere, apart from the
 orange glow coming up from the deep, like a disaster movie
 scenography. The faint green light from the screen of your E-Pad
 catches details for only a few meters around.

 What comes to your mind next sends a blow to your stomach.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The Fatimah Initiative,</span> you think in horror.<span class="floydstyle em"> No lights</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">means no energy.</span>

 And no energy means the tides.

 If the Fatimah initiative is stopped, for any reason, the whole planet

>go northwest

 With much effort, you manage to pull yourself over the ledge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rails' End</span>
 These are the remains of the tunnel which would have taken you to the
 University if the quake hadn't swallowed its walls. Cascades of dirty
 water wash the sides of the black pit, flowing towards the giant
 crack. The fiery curtains of orange smoke that originate a few meters
 from you are the only light source for a span that goes on for
 kilometers. A thick web of twisted rails cuts its way across the
 darkness to the southwest. A small gap in the hulking walls of the
 tunnel leads north towards the unknown. Then it's only concrete and
 stone and a shattered world tangling together in every direction.

 <span class="floydstyle em">What is the magnitude of this disaster?</span> you ask yourself,
 while trying to put together the pieces of the splintering ground
 around you.<span class="floydstyle em"> What could have caused such a devastating</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">earthquake?</span>

 In the darkness of Monarch's deepest recesses, only the thickest
 silence stands as an answer. The rest is black.

>examine rails

 The rails can be walked on, although with a certain care.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Molten Span</span>
 The earth shattering event has done much more damage here than in the
 near tunnel. A gigantic river of molten rocks and magma slowly cuts
 its way in a wide crack running before your eyes. You stand
 uncomfortably over a small stony step which looks like a building's
 cornice and serves as the only walkway at the side of the underground
 cliff, off to the east and west. Pieces of building sink into the
 ground and pop out from the ceiling of the enormous cave, like steel
 crosses in an abandoned cemetery. In the middle of the crack, to the
 north, bathing in magma, rests the crippled half of one of the
 Construct pillars, the remaining structure lost.

 A thin rain of small debris drops constantly from the crumbling sky.
 You look upon the decay of the human last resort and close your eyes
 in fear and torment.

 <span class="floydstyle em">There it goes,</span> you sink into sorrow.<span class="floydstyle em"> We are late. We</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">always have been late.</span>

 You feel the weight of your E-Pad and remember downloading something
 about the Constructs in it.

>research constructs

 <span class="floydstyle em">The foundations of Monarch's Republican World. Digging deep into</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the earth where the glacial layer has been molten, pillars of steel</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and concrete serve as supports for the above cities. In fact, the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Monarch nation is but a floating continent built by the first colonies</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">above the icy layer. Nowadays, a mere 10 percent of that layer is</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">still solid, the rest being transformed into vast oceans covering more</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">than half the world</span>.

>examine pillar

 About fifteen meters wide, the pillar must have been torn in two by
 the quake. The lower part still sinks into the ground, inside and
 below the flowing magma, its alloy slowly surrendering to the heat. In
 a few hours it will be consumed. Something shines on the oblique
 surface of the pillar, in the spot where its has been cut in half.

>go north

 It is a jump of twenty meters. There is no way to reach the pillar
 without falling into the fiery pit.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hollow Grounds</span>
 If it wasn't so dramatic, the view from here would be breathtaking.
 The immense magma river flows below effortlessly, although slow and
 patiently. The whole cave is lit by its fiery belly. From here you can
 see the broken pillar rising from the flames like a finger pointing
 the sky -- a sky made of crumbling rocks and metal -- and the stony
 walls surrounding the sight like the steps of a giant arena. Below,
 the thin cornice cuts a distinct line on the side of it, losing itself
 in the distance inside a small passage to the west. The piece of
 quartz you are standing on has resisted the quake's onslaught and is
 now holding itself onto the rock like a cat on a tree trunk. Something
 like steps rise from here to an alcove, up above and near the ceiling.
 A faint cyanotic light pulsates inside it. You can reach it to the
 northwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave Mouth</span>
 A grim mouth dug into the span's wall starts here and crawls inside
 the earth, disappearing after a twist to the south. A bright blue
 light pulsates there, faint. In front of you, the molten span is still
 visible, although the curve of the collapsing ceiling covers your
 sight. The cliff then dives deep into the roaring lava, debris
 dropping from its edge now and then. You can reach the quartz
 outcropping walking -- carefully -- southeast.

 A lesser tremor splinters the cliff, sending pieces into the fiery pit
 below.

>exits

 <span class="floydstyle em">[From here you can go south and southeast]</span>.

 A small chunk of rock falls into the magma from the edge of the cliff.

>go south

 Following the twisted passage for what seemed like an eternity, you
 finally come to a vast area, and your eyes widen in awe.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hyerotrope</span>
 A dome of sorts has been carved in the earth, an inner sanctum of
 inhumane proportions, spanning for hundreds of meters in all
 directions. The wall's surface is smooth and shiny, cut into a dark
 material that looks like obsidian. On the ground, a maze of carvings
 draw perfect lines that intersect each other and run throughout the
 floor; all are filled by an ethereal substance as thin as air that
 glows in a faint blue. They seem to revolve around a single entity in
 the center of the gargantuan structure, and sink under its base. Many
 of these cuts then proceed over the structure, like an electric ivy
 clinging to it. Light shimmers from nowhere in particular and from all
 around at the same time, reverberating on the rock and on the steel
 floor. A faint buzz is the only noise audible, the rest of the
 universe swallowed in an uncomfortable, dark silence.

 <span class="floydstyle em">A Hyerotrope, </span>you realize, noting the perfect symmetries and
 geometries that shape everything in here. <span class="floydstyle em">This is what holds</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Monarch together. </span>You remember having files about it both in your
 E-Pad library and in your Reports.

 The demi-spheric bunker, a perfect inside-out replica of the halls
 around it, sits in the exact center of the room. It sinks into the
 ground as if pushed into it by some great force, a gap a few
 centimeters wide separating it from the floor. Its dark skin inflates
 and exhales like an ancient heart.

 What looks like a door draws a perfect rectangle on this side of the
 dome.

>research hyerotrope

 <span class="floydstyle em">The moving motor of the Tidal Initiative.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Discovered during the Ancient Era, its meaning or purpose is yet</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">unknown. Apart from a huge power surge (all in the geo-gravitational</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">been hypothesized as a remnant of a former energy outbreak, the likes</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and size of which are not computable. Although "dead" in many ways, it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">was soon discovered that its gravitational pull could be altered by</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">igniting it with an immense plasma shock. Thus far, the seventeen</span>

 continuing over its round surface.

>examine door

 There is no way of telling how this "door" can be opened.. On it, four

 The dots look like tiny holes in the center of the "door", one above

 You approach the cliff's edge, ready to get back to the quartz
 platform, when a sudden tremor stops you on your feet.
 And it's a rather fortunate event, as your step ends up just a
 centimeter from a sinister crack opening on the cliff itself.

 A second later, a more intense shock cuts the crack open and a large
 section of the cliff face goes crumbling down right in front of you.
 You had taken another half step you would have fallen into the fiery
 pits below.

 You hold yourself to the cave walls, panting loudly, waiting for the
 affright to vanish.

>go north

 You walk over the crumbled wall, finding your way to the Construct
 pillar. The heat is almost unbearable.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pillar Section</span>
 The broken pillar seems sturdy enough to resist the flowing magma for
 a long time. Were it not for the quake, it could have survived in the
 molten rocks for ages. The alloy is sturdy and elastic at the same
 time, its interiors glittering like a salt mine. At its center, a
 hollow section opens into a net of tangled steel bars that worked as a
 skeleton for the whole structure. Wires of every kind run deep inside,
 like a circulatory system. You can't tell what kind of machinations
 were designed for the Construct and what served what inside here.

 From the center of the pillar, where it has been torn in two by the
 disaster, a steel bar pops out, loose from the others of its own
 family. It looks like you can pull it out without much effort.

 You start fainting from the excessive heat. Your eyes are sore and you
 can barely breathe.

 The walk over the tiny ledge is painstaking. After several minutes,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Warehouse</span>
 The wide room is lit only by the fiery pits opening east beyond the
 crack in the wall. The rest is immersed in darkness. All you can
 discern are piles and piles of boxes and stuff put together who knows
 when and for who knows what. Glimmering in the reflections of your
 E-Pad's green light, you discover a lonely hut, made from plastic
 wreckage and held together by iron wires, its door sprung open to the

 stock.

 A huge switch hides behind some dust in the west wall.

 <span class="floydstyle em">During the era when the Constructs were built, a large underground</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">vault, known as the "settlement", was used for R&D and to store</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">artifacts and knowledge found while digging through the icy crust and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the upper layers. Aseptic walls run relentlessly for kilometers, along</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">with a vast number of laboratories and facilities. These places are a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">sort of gigantic city-under-the-city, where the researchers and the</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">seclusion proved too much for the inhabitants of the settlements, who</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">started showing signs of paranoia and of claustrophobia. After only</span>

 when and for who knows what. Glimmering in the reflections of your

 together by iron wires, its door sprung open to the north. The

 A huge switch hides behind some dust in the west wall.

 Darkness gets thicker in here. Shelves line up along the interior, but
 they are all empty. An old wire dangles from the ceiling with no lamp

 Where the light came in from a small cut in the wall, a wide crack

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Molten Span</span>
 A gigantic river of molten rocks and magma slowly cuts its way in a
 wide crack running before your eyes. You stand uncomfortably over a
 small stony step which looks like a building's cornice and serves as
 the only walkway at the side of the underground cliff, off to the east
 and west. Pieces of building sink into the ground and pop out from the
 ceiling of the enormous cave, like steel crosses in an abandoned
 cemetery. In the middle of the crack, to the north, bathing in magma,
 rests the crippled half of one of the Construct pillars, the remaining
 structure lost.

 A bridge of sedimentary stone has fallen from above, and now rests in
 a scarce equilibrium above the fiery canyon between here and the
 pillar's broken surface.

>go north

 You walk over the crumbled wall, finding your way to the Construct
 pillar. The heat is almost unbearable.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pillar Section</span>
 The broken pillar seems sturdy enough to resist the flowing magma for
 a long time. Were it not for the quake, it could have survived in the
 molten rocks for ages. The alloy is sturdy and elastic at the same
 time, its interiors glittering like a salt mine. At its center, a
 hollow section opens into a net of tangled steel bars that worked as a
 skeleton for the whole structure. Wires of every kind run deep inside,
 like a circulatory system.

 The fumes coming from the lava under the pillar are so hot you can
 feel your skin burn. You must get out of here before you catch fire.

 The immense magma river flows below effortlessly, although slow and

 see the broken pillar rising from the flames like a finger pointing
 the sky -- a sky made of crumbling rocks and metal -- and the stony
 walls surrounding the sight like the steps of a giant arena. Below,
 the thin cornice cuts a distinct line on the side of it, losing itself
 in the distance inside a small passage to the west. The piece of
 quartz you are standing on has resisted the quake's onslaught and is
 now holding itself onto the rock like a cat on a tree trunk. Something
 like steps rise from here to an alcove, up above and near the ceiling.
 A faint cyanotic light pulsates inside it. You can reach it to the
 northwest.

 A large chunk of rock from the cave mouth, up above, has fallen into
 the molten span and now looks like a bridge of sorts between it and
 the Construct pillar.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave Mouth</span>
 A grim mouth dug into the span's wall starts here and crawls inside
 the earth, disappearing after a twist to the south. A bright blue
 light pulsates there, faint. In front of you, the molten span is still
 visible, although the curve of the collapsing ceiling covers your
 sight. The cliff then dives deep into the roaring lava, debris
 dropping from its edge now and then. You can reach the quartz
 outcropping walking -- carefully -- southeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hyerotrope</span>
 A dome of sorts has been carved in the earth, an inner sanctum of
 inhumane proportions, spanning for hundreds of meters in all
 directions. The wall's surface is smooth and shiny, cut into a dark
 material that looks like obsidian. On the ground, a maze of carvings
 draw perfect lines that intersect each other and run throughout the
 floor; all are filled by an ethereal substance as thin as air that
 glows in a faint blue. They seem to revolve around a single entity in
 the center of the gargantuan structure, and sink under its base. Many
 of these cuts then proceed over the structure, like an electric ivy
 clinging to it. Light shimmers from nowhere in particular and from all
 around at the same time, reverberating on the rock and on the steel
 floor. A faint buzz is the only noise audible, the rest of the
 universe swallowed in an uncomfortable, dark silence.

 The demi-spheric bunker, a perfect inside-out replica of the halls
 around it, sits in the exact center of the room. It sinks into the
 ground as if pushed into it by some great force, a gap a few
 centimeters wide separating it from the floor. Its dark skin inflates
 and exhales like an ancient heart.

 What looks like a door draws a perfect rectangle on this side of the
 dome.

>examine door

 There is no way of telling how this "door" can be opened.. On it, four
 small dots draw a perfect line, in its center.

 The dots look like tiny holes in the center of the "door", one above
 the other in a linear sequence. Light pulsates inside four of them.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rails' End</span>
 Cascades of dirty water wash the sides of the black pit, flowing
 towards the giant crack. The fiery curtains of orange smoke that
 originate a few meters from you are the only light source for a span
 that goes on for kilometers. A thick web of twisted rails cuts its way
 across the darkness to the southwest. A small gap in the hulking walls
 of the tunnel leads north towards the lake of magma. Then it's only
 concrete and stone and a shattered world tangling together in every
 direction.

>go southwest

 Moving very carefully, you manage to put one step in front of the
 other, above the deep, until you get to...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Last Steel Overlook</span>
 The chasm is under you. Its teeth close on the rails like the mouth of
 an all-devouring creature. You balance above nothing, an acrobat
 clinging to his own life, the only reasonable exit awaiting to the
 northeast.

 A broken wagon is dangling from the last of the rails, to the west.
 Light buzzes inside.

 A gust of smoke fills your nostrils, leaving you stunned.

>examine wagon

 The wagon clings to the last straw of rails. It has been ripped in
 half by the quake deflagration and now looks like the decaying body of
 a dead pet. Sparks light its interiors.

>go west

 One step at a time. Very, very carefully.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Broken Wagon</span>
 The crumpled floor rests inclined by forty degrees, making it very
 hard to stay on foot. You hold on to a bench, its metal handles your
 last resort against a fall. Light buzzes inside broken fluorescent
 lamps and sparks ignite the emptiness with futile effort. You are
 overwhelmed by... the gravity of the situation.

 There is no sign of life. All is fallen. Dead.

 A glimpse of light reflects on something, hidden under the last bench

 You pull yourself to your stretching limit, a hand grasping for the

 nails on a blackboard.

 They disappear down under never hitting the bottom.

 vibertron portal.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Light?</span> You mutter to yourself. <span class="floydstyle em">Where's the source? Maybe</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cold Pyramid</span>
 The door opens into another disaster scenario. Chunks of rock have
 emerged from the broken floor, piercing through the roof. From there,
 massive blocks of concrete and steel hang, remnants of the city above.

 The quake has indeed been tremendous and you wonder how much of the

 A tunnel cuts its way into the earth to the north, beyond reach.

 An ice spike the size of a bus has been thrusted into the room from

 Before leaving, you remove the Elektron from the machinery.

 You get off the ice spike.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cold Pyramid</span>
 Chunks of rock have emerged from the broken floor, piercing through
 the roof. From there, massive blocks of concrete and steel hang,
 remnants of the city above.

 A tunnel cuts its way into the earth to the north, beyond reach.

 An ice spike the size of a bus has been thrusted into the room from
 below. It shines, the light coming from a source underneath it, and it
 is illuminating the area. The color and shape of the chunk betray the
 ice as very, very old, the likes of which you studied from the
 Monarch's glacial era.

 Above the spike, near the roof, sparkles fall down from a broken piece
 of machinery.

>go north

 The massive ice spike is in the way.

>examine tunnel

>examine machinery

 It seems the quake has exploded in here, sending all upwards, toward
 the surface. The machinery (the likes of which you've never seen
 before, although it is hard to tell from here) has been pushed into
 the ceiling by a shattering force.

 A glossy side, a sticky side and some text on the display. On the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blinking Room</span>
 Light vibrates and sends shimmering glances all over the place. The
 floor seems to be made from plain, levigated rock. The walls are of
 the same plastic material of the near corridor. To the west, a metal
 door bears the sign "storeroom" while, to the north, stands a more
 relieving vibertron portal.

 A distant dripping sound echoes somewhere.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Featureless Corridor</span>
 Pale walls run east from here in this blank passage. No doors or
 windows open in the underground, but light fills the corridor, blown
 in through the roof.

 A gap opens where the west wall once stood.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Featureless Corridor</span>
 Pale walls run east-west in this blank passage. No doors or windows
 open in the underground, but light fills the corridor, blown in
 through the roof. A crack breaks the southern wall like a black scar.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the hut</span>
 Darkness gets thicker in here. Shelves line up along the interior, but
 they are all empty. An old wire dangles from the ceiling with no lamp
 on it. The only exit is south, to the warehouse.

 Where the light came in from a small cut in the wall, a wide crack
 opens, revealing an escape route to the north.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned Warehouse</span>
 The wide room is lit only by the fiery pits opening east beyond the
 crack in the wall. The rest is immersed in darkness. All you can
 discern are piles and piles of boxes and stuff put together who knows
 when and for who knows what. Glimmering in the reflections of your
 E-Pad's green light, a lonely hut, made from plastic wreckage and held
 together by iron wires, its door sprung open to the north. The
 warehouse goes on to the northwest, beyond more piles of stock.

 A huge switch hides behind some dust in the west wall.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Molten Span</span>
 A gigantic river of molten rocks and magma slowly cuts its way in a
 wide crack running before your eyes. You stand uncomfortably over a
 small stony step which looks like a building's cornice and serves as
 the only walkway at the side of the underground cliff, off to the east
 and west. Pieces of building sink into the ground and pop out from the
 ceiling of the enormous cave, like steel crosses in an abandoned
 cemetery. In the middle of the crack, to the north, bathing in magma,
 rests the crippled half of one of the Construct pillars, the remaining
 structure lost.

 A bridge of sedimentary stone has fallen from above, and now rests in
 a scarce equilibrium above the fiery canyon between here and the
 pillar's broken surface.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hollow Grounds</span>
 The immense magma river flows below effortlessly, although slow and
 patiently. The whole cave is lit by its fiery belly. From here you can
 see the broken pillar rising from the flames like a finger pointing
 the sky -- a sky made of crumbling rocks and metal -- and the stony
 walls surrounding the sight like the steps of a giant arena. Below,
 the thin cornice cuts a distinct line on the side of it, losing itself
 in the distance inside a small passage to the west. The piece of
 quartz you are standing on has resisted the quake's onslaught and is
 now holding itself onto the rock like a cat on a tree trunk. Something
 like steps rise from here to an alcove, up above and near the ceiling.
 A faint cyanotic light pulsates inside it. You can reach it to the
 northwest.

 A large chunk of rock from the cave mouth, up above, has fallen into
 the molten span and now looks like a bridge of sorts between it and
 the Construct pillar.

>go east

 You can't go that way.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave Mouth</span>
 A grim mouth dug into the span's wall starts here and crawls inside
 the earth, disappearing after a twist to the south. A bright blue
 light pulsates there, faint. In front of you, the molten span is still
 visible, although the curve of the collapsing ceiling covers your
 sight. The cliff then dives deep into the roaring lava, debris
 dropping from its edge now and then. You can reach the quartz
 outcropping walking -- carefully -- southeast.

 A lesser tremor splinters the cliff, sending pieces into the fiery pit
 below.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hyerotrope</span>
 A dome of sorts has been carved in the earth, an inner sanctum of
 inhumane proportions, spanning for hundreds of meters in all
 directions. The wall's surface is smooth and shiny, cut into a dark
 material that looks like obsidian. On the ground, a maze of carvings
 draw perfect lines that intersect each other and run throughout the
 floor; all are filled by an ethereal substance as thin as air that
 glows in a faint blue. They seem to revolve around a single entity in
 the center of the gargantuan structure, and sink under its base. Many
 of these cuts then proceed over the structure, like an electric ivy
 clinging to it. Light shimmers from nowhere in particular and from all
 around at the same time, reverberating on the rock and on the steel
 floor. A faint buzz is the only noise audible, the rest of the
 universe swallowed in an uncomfortable, dark silence.

 The demi-spheric bunker, a perfect inside-out replica of the halls
 around it, sits in the exact center of the room. It sinks into the
 ground as if pushed into it by some great force, a gap a few
 centimeters wide separating it from the floor. Its dark skin inflates
 and exhales like an ancient heart.

 What looks like a door draws a perfect rectangle on this side of the
 dome.

>examine door

 There is no way of telling how this "door" can be opened.. On it, four
 small dots draw a perfect line, in its center.

 The dots look like tiny holes in the center of the "door", one above
 the other in a linear sequence. Light pulsates inside four of them.

>attach elektron to door

 You would achieve nothing by this.

>put elektron on door

 You link the Elektron to the door of the dome. The display on the
 device blinks twice: Some text appears on it.

 It reads: <span class="floydstyle em">Geo-gravitational pull. Alert. Peaks at 13.6x10^12 gamma</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">epsilon. Reading off scale. Process terminated.</span>

 Wow. There must be a power source of gigantic proportions in there.

>open door

 There is no evident way of doing that. There must be a trick of sorts
 to open the door. If it <span class="floydstyle em">is</span> a door, of course.

>go north

 You go into the gap.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Recess</span>
 Darkness falls. The faint, sterile light coming from the opening to
 the south is devoured by the walls of this twisted tunnel, a cut in
 the earth running diagonal and scattered in every direction. You can
 find no exits: the E-Pad is not enough to shed a light on this obscure
 womb.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Lab</span>
 Again, disaster struck.

 The walls of what once was a sort of laboratory are but piles of
 debris and distorted laminas. The only passage large enough for your
 shoulders is west, through broken rocks. To the south, darkness marks
 the way to the corridors.

 The only surviving piece of equipment, amidst the crumbled universe
 that is now this old planet, is a glass cabinet which batteries still
 power. A fluorescent light shines on its pale interior.

>examine cabinet

 Inside the cabinet you can see a disc that someone labeled "Alpha" and
 a disc labeled "Beta".

>examine alpha

 It has two plain surfaces. One is smooth and polished. The other is
 marked by an astonishing number of protruding lines, like a maze of
 sorts.

>put elektron on alpha

 The surviving glass cabinet isn't open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nail</span>
 Another lab, where light is just a thick, yellow smoke at nose-height.
 All seems in place: the cabinets, the tables, the displays. Even a
 terminal, which sits on the northeast corner of the room, seems real
 enough to push the thought it could actually be functional. But:
 there's something more, something you couldn't have honestly
 anticipated.

 Something like a talon has cut this room in two. Its three meter long,
 shiny carapace is dripping with horror and malevolence. In from the
 west wall, it has crushed everything and splintered stone and metal
 together with no effort. You cannot fathom what -- or who -- it must
 belong to.

 The nail seems nerveless.

>examine nail

 It looks metallic, although you are <span class="floydstyle em">certain</span> it must be a
 beast's nail. It is still as a statue, but you are <span class="floydstyle em">convinced</span>
 life still runs through it.

>touch it

 It is cold as ice. Still, you <span class="floydstyle em">know</span> warm blood must run in
 there.

>put elektron on nail

 The surface of the talon is not good for that.

>research dragon

 You discover nothing of interest in the E-Pad.

 The light from the ceiling vibrates randomly, then it calms down.

>examine terminal

 A keyboard and a screen. It sits silently, seemingly turned off.

>put elektron on terminal

 The surface of the old terminal is not good for that.

>turn on terminal

 The screen comes to life. What comes up appears to be a diagram of
 sorts.

>examine screen

 (the old terminal)
 The screen shows a diagram, indicating what seems to be a comparison
 between energy spectrums, a kind of measurement you and Andy have been
 doing a lot, lately. Infact, it takes you but a second to recognize
 the waveforms and the patterns depicted.

 On the left, a vivid pink line indicates the remnants of the Event
 onslaught, that waveform that still can be picked up well beyond the
 Omega waves array. On the right, a similar (but much stronger) curve,
 printed in light blue, almost replicates the first one. There are no
 labels under the diagrams, still it's beyond any doubt the latter is
 what you and Andy called the Alpha Radiation.

 Ironically, the two lines look like the output of a... quake
 measurement device.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The Event,</span> you murmur. As a conditioned reflex, you find
 yourself holding tight to the E-Pad.

>research event

 <span class="floydstyle em">"The Event" a.k.a. "Event Primeval" or "the Crunch".</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">During the Third Age, around year 7,892 of the Galaxy, the Event</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">begun, spanning over 300 years as calculated from Korhos revolutionary</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Monarch. The lesser sun of the trinary system KFS, Fatimah, was</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">actually involved in the deflagration. It was dislocated enough to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">enter the Korhos gravitational orbit, thus becoming its bigger</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">satellite. The Event also wiped almost all life on the Andromeda</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">galaxy: just the more technologically advanced inhabitants of the</span>

 A tunnel cuts its way into the earth to the north, beyond reach.

 An ice spike the size of a bus has been thrusted into the room from

 <span class="floydstyle i">Cold Pyramid</span> (on the ice spike)
 Chunks of rock have emerged from the broken floor, piercing through

 A tunnel cuts its way into the earth to the north, beyond reach.

 Near the roof, sparkles fall down from a broken piece of machinery.

>examine cylinder

 It seems the quake has exploded in here, sending all upwards, toward
 the surface. The machinery (the likes of which you've never seen
 before) has been pushed into the ceiling by a shattering force.

 Now that you are near, you can carefully analyze it. It is a sort of
 metal cylinder, levigated beyond perfection by unknown forces. On it,
 four dots identical to the ones on the door of the Hyerotrope blink
 faintly. The exposed edge of the cylinder is a tangle of tiny cuts,
 each twisted into the other in an unique pattern. A smooth, plain
 surface is visible just a few centimeters near the dots.

>examine alpha

 It has two plain surfaces. One is smooth and polished. The other is
 marked by an astonishing number of protruding lines, like a maze of
 sorts.

>put alpha on cylinder

 You try the disc labeled "Alpha", but it doesn't fit the machinery
 base. The lines and cuts don't match.

>put beta on cylinder

 You try the disk "Beta" on the machinery. It fits perfectly, the lines
 protruding from it matching the cuts on the base. The four dots blink
 twice, then start strobing and dancing to the rhythm of some unheard
 music.

 It is so much fun.

 Then, it all comes crumbling down. The very earth trembles and drops
 to pieces. A wave comes rushing inside from the south, devastating the
 walls and the whole surroundings like a tsunami of stone. The ceiling
 holds, but the ice spike on which you stand is swallowed by the
 ground, that closes on it like curtains of doom.

 When the event comes to an end, the machinery has disappeared, lost
 somewhere, and you get up, bruised but uncannily unharmed.

 <span class="floydstyle em">What has just happened?</span> you ask yourself, while removing dust
 from your clothes.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cold Pyramid</span>
 Chunks of rock have emerged from the broken floor, piercing through
 the roof. From there, massive blocks of concrete and steel hang,
 remnants of the city above.

 A tunnel cuts its way into the earth to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quartz Tunnel</span>

 open to a more comfortable rock cave while, on the opposite direction,
 they separate in two different paths, to the northwest and east
 respectively.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quarantine</span>
 The dark interiors of this hall, washed in a pale greenish dye, remind
 you of a hospital. A few corridors exit the chamber to the east, north
 and south, all marked by a red sign respectively to "the Wastes", "the
 Cells" and "the Pentagon". A tunnel exits to the southeast.

 Another spark ignites your brain as you recall having read something,
 once, about a zone called the "Quarantine", where convicts of the
 underground settlements -- and something far more valuable -- were
 held... uhm, hostages.

 <span class="floydstyle em">A seclusion area,</span> you think.<span class="floydstyle em"> A place where things were</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">hidden</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The reclusion area of the Underground Settlements. Different zones</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">were used for storing artifacts found during excavations, storing</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">unvaluable waste and garbage, and jailing those that were held</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">responsible for acts of mischief during their duty.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">A non-conventional belief, by the way, is that the Quarantine was</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">used to recess "guests" not too fond of keeping secrets and -- as the</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">A part of the Quarantine area, in the Settlements, was used as a</span>

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wastes</span>
 A room as large as your condo opens before you. A set of metal stairs
 descends into what seems to be the largest waste basket you've ever
 seen. Walls are shiny in slime and other unpleasant sewages,
 reflecting the stale light that comes from bioluminescent lamps
 clinging to the ceiling. The overall sensation is that of a green
 pudding, bubbling inside a green basin, bathing in a green atmosphere.

>examine lamps

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine pudding

 Everything that was rejected in the Settlements has been piled here.
 This is a sort of trash compactor, now luckily inert. Bathing in this
 sink is every kind of thing, much of it almost completely putrefied.

>go down

 You climb down the ladder, every step uncomfortably sinking into
 ancient garbage and the thick smell of human decay.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Waste Basket</span>
 You are neck deep into a mass of old-decayed garbage. The only exit is
 up, via a metal ladder. The rest is a green horizon of smelly
 headaches.

 You rake the garbage, holding your breath -- and <span class="floydstyle em">not</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Waste Basket</span>
 You are neck deep into a mass of old-decayed garbage. The only exit is
 up, via a metal ladder. The rest is a green horizon of smelly
 headaches.

 A glass case swims over the garbage. Something is floating inside it.

>examine case

 In the glass case is a perfect machine.

>examine machine

 A sort of metal cylinder, levigated beyond perfection by unknown
 forces. On it, four dots identical to the ones on the door of the
 Hyerotrope blink faintly. The bottom edge of the cylinder is a tangle
 of tiny cuts, each twisted into the other in an unique pattern. A
 smooth, plain surface is visible just a few centimeters near the dots.

>open case

 There are no obvious openings. It looks like a cage. Whatever that
 thing inside is is meant to stay there.

>hit case with bar

 The glass case resists the blow. It has obviously been designed to
 keep the cylinder trapped inside at any cost. You need to find
 something even more adamant to break it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cells</span>
 The polished look of this area shouldn't betray its soul. A wing of
 containment rooms, each used for a specific purpose, as stated by the
 signs appended to each of the doors in the corridor. Many are
 storerooms for quarantined specimens, chambers armored against
 radiation, explosions and other unpredictable events. But the rest,
 lined in rows of hundreds, are just detention cells for human
 convicts. Among the many, two are open, west of here and further
 north.

 You think about the madness that once must have inhabited this hall. A
 place where seclusion was the worst enemy, above danger, a scarce
 economy and not many escape routes. A full population of no-hopers,
 whom life on the surface was forbidden or set apart and that,
 eventually, was driven insane by its own lifestyle.

 The ASA, in the end, proved above all the rest that "the end justifies
 the means" is just another hollow statement, built up by politicians
 to lay their plans with no opposition.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Control Room</span>
 A wall, covered in monitors. A table, unfurnished except for some
 lined square buttons in the middle and a lonely terminal, sitting on a
 corner. This is a sightseeing tour over the detention center.

>examine terminal

 A tap display and a vibertron surface. It is on, maybe self-powered.

>tap display

 There are three blank spaces and a virtual numeric keyboard on the

>examine buttons

 Strangely, two of the buttons are lit. One bears the word "screens",
 the other: "shock".

 The light from the ceiling vibrates randomly, then it calms down.

>push screens

 There's a burst in each of the monitors. One of them comes to life.

>examine monitor

 One of the monitors is lit. It shows the blank interiors of a stale
 cell.

>push shock

 You hear a fain buzz, somewhere, then a tremor rocks the place.
 On the only lit monitor you witness something unexpected. A burst of
 lightning fills the room. Doing so, it ignites an explosion, on its
 far wall. A cloud of smoke plugs the visual for a minute.

 You walk in the only open cell to the north and gasp.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inferno</span>
 This is what hell must be.

 The walls of the tiny cell -- a mere two-by-two meters cubicle -- have
 all been painted and writings cover most of the surface. Someone, the
 inmate, has scratched every square centimeter of the concrete, leaving
 parts of himself among the apocalyptic messages and drawings.

 It is indeed a work that took time, and a relentless resolution. Or a
 madness without boundaries.

 <span class="floydstyle em">And was the madness that took him to the confinement,</span> you
 wonder, looking at the scars that mark the soul of this very room,<span class="floydstyle em"></span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">or was it the other way around?</span>

 The humming that fills this nightmare, as a moaning of a living being,
 stands as an answer, when all that is sane has left the building.

 A cylinder rests on the ground of the cell, on the opposite side of a
 hole dug into the wall where it must have been trapped before the
 explosion.

 A round hole marks the wall where the cylinder once stood trapped.

>examine wall

 The writings have been scratched in blood. Nails and finger parts are
 still clinging to the raped wall.

 <span class="floydstyle em">This is the end this is the end</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Lemme out</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">I found the way    There is a way</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">They all speak in riddles    They all speak to me     I can hear</span>

 Then, the single writing that catches your attention:

 <span class="floydstyle em">The FIRST initiative. Their testament. I have seen it. This is all</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">going to end. Use the bounds use their number</span>.

 The first initiative. The one secreted so many years ago.

 And that sentence: "Apocalypse comes from down under". Could it be
 talking about the Alpha Radiation?

 (the perfect cylinder)
 You try the disk "Alpha" on the perfect cylinder. It fits perfectly,
 the lines protruding from it matching the cuts on the base. The four
 dots blink twice, then start strobing and dancing to the rhythm of
 some unheard music. The perfect machine flees from your hands and
 start levitating in front of you. Then, shrieking like a wraith, it
 flies away, jumping into the very ground and digging itself an escape.

 It is now proven that the train derailed over the scientific area of

 same old white plastic as the rest of the corridors that crowd the
 place. As opposite to the rest of the environment, this large room
 seems unscarred. The yellow floor is dotted by tracks in black-striped
 adhesives, drawing lines around the structure that rests in the center
 of the chamber. There is not much by the way of furniture, except for
 a single, foreign machine.

 A cube, three meters wide, sleeps in the very center of the room. A
 strong, tight bundle of wires moves from its bottom towards the
 eastern wall, where it disappears in a plug. Two bays are open on the

 The laser beam cuts the metal weight, replicating the soap's surface.

>examine weight

 A kilogram. Almost perfect. A replica of the wax soap has been
 laser-cut onto it.

>carve soap

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take soap

 Taken.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pentagon</span>
 A five-sided room, which the earthquake has just barely scratched.
 Five exits run from here, each marked with a letter, except for the
 one which stands blank on the north wall. To the northeast, a capital
 "A" hangs over a grate, which seems stuck to the walls, unopenable.
 Southeast, "B" rests over what remains of a tunnel that has caved in,
 some of the rocks fallen inside the room. Northwest and southwest,
 respectively, "C" and "D" sign two metal doors.

 The earth shakes a little, maybe adjusting itself.

>put soap in grate

 That can't contain things.

>examine keyhole

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine grate

 Iron bars, the old style. Rust cover its surface. Beyond the grate
 only darkness and a dripping sound.

>examine c door

 Its massive vibertron structure is inert in this powerless
 environment.

>examine a door

 (southwest door)
 This door is different. It is not made from vibertron, but all in
 solid steel. Its surface is marked by a yellow scar -- a logo of sorts
 -- depicting a triangle with rays all around it. The words "CAUTION:
 DANGER ZONE" are the only other detail. A knob rests on the right side
 of the door.

 It is vaguely heart shaped. Its crystal resonates to the colors of the
 surroundings, shifting from pink to blue through all the spectrum.

 Iron bars, the old style. Rust cover its surface. Beyond the grate
 only darkness and a dripping sound.

 The quartz perfectly fits the slot on the back of the Elektron. The

 The surface of southwest door is not good for that.

 The earth shakes a little, maybe adjusting itself.

 It would probably ruin both the steel bar and the barred gate.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 You can't see any such thing.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quarantine</span>
 The dark interiors of this hall, washed in a pale greenish dye, remind
 you of a hospital. A few corridors exit the chamber to the east, north
 and south, all marked by a red sign respectively to "the Wastes", "the

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cells</span>
 The polished look of this area shouldn't betray its soul. A wing of
 containment rooms, each used for a specific purpose, as stated by the

 storerooms for quarantined specimens, chambers armored against
 radiation, explosions and other unpredictable events. But the rest,
 lined in rows of hundreds, are just detention cells for human
 convicts. Among the many, two are open, west of here and further
 north.

 A distant dripping sound echoes somewhere.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Control Room</span>
 A wall, covered in monitors. A table, unfurnished except for some
 lined square buttons in the middle and a lonely terminal, sitting on a

 On the only lit monitor you see bursts of lightning filling the room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wastes</span>
 A room as large as your condo opens before you. A set of metal stairs
 descends into what seems to be the largest waste basket you've ever
 seen. Walls are shiny in slime and other unpleasant sewages,
 reflecting the stale light that comes from bioluminescent lamps
 clinging to the ceiling. The overall sensation is that of a green
 pudding, bubbling inside a green basin, bathing in a green atmosphere.

>go down

 You climb down the ladder, every step uncomfortably sinking into
 ancient garbage and the thick smell of human decay.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Waste Basket</span>
 You are neck deep into a mass of old-decayed garbage. The only exit is
 up, via a metal ladder. The rest is a green horizon of smelly
 headaches.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quartz Tunnel</span>
 Crystal walls surround you, in every direction. To the south, they
 open to a more comfortable rock cave while, on the opposite direction,
 they separate in two different paths, to the northwest and east
 respectively.

>go to hyerotrope

 You go south to the cold pyramid, south again to the blinking room,
 east to the featureless corridor, east again to the featureless
 corridor, south to the inside the hut, south again to the abandoned
 warehouse, east to the molten span, east again to the hollow grounds,
 northwest to the cave mouth and south to the hyerotrope.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hyerotrope</span>
 A dome of sorts has been carved in the earth, an inner sanctum of
 inhumane proportions, spanning for hundreds of meters in all
 directions. The wall's surface is smooth and shiny, cut into a dark
 material that looks like obsidian. On the ground, a maze of carvings
 draw perfect lines that intersect each other and run throughout the
 floor; all are filled by an ethereal substance as thin as air that
 glows in a faint blue. They seem to revolve around a single entity in
 the center of the gargantuan structure, and sink under its base. Many
 of these cuts then proceed over the structure, like an electric ivy
 clinging to it. Light shimmers from nowhere in particular and from all
 around at the same time, reverberating on the rock and on the steel
 floor. A faint buzz is the only noise audible, the rest of the
 universe swallowed in an uncomfortable, dark silence.

 The demi-spheric bunker, a perfect inside-out replica of the halls
 around it, sits in the exact center of the room. It sinks into the
 ground as if pushed into it by some great force, a gap a few
 centimeters wide separating it from the floor. Its dark skin inflates
 and exhales like an ancient heart.

 What looks like a door draws a perfect rectangle on this side of the
 dome.

>examine door

 There is no way of telling how this "door" can be opened.. On it, four
 small dots draw a perfect line, in its center.

 The dots look like tiny holes in the center of the "door", one above
 the other in a linear sequence. Light pulsates inside two of them.

 You're carrying a wax soap, a disc labeled "Gamma", a glass case, a
 black box, a steel bar, a new railway ticket, some Report files and an
 E-Pad.

>research diamond

 You discover nothing of interest in the E-Pad.

>go to wagon

 Moving very carefully, you manage to put one step in front of the
 other, above the deep, until you get to...

 One step at a time. Very, very carefully.

 You go north to the cave mouth, southeast to the hollow grounds, west
 to the molten span, south to the rails' end, southwest to the last
 steel overlook and west to the broken wagon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Broken Wagon</span>
 The crumpled floor rests inclined by forty degrees, making it very
 hard to stay on foot. You hold on to a bench, its metal handles your
 last resort against a fall. Light buzzes inside broken fluorescent
 lamps and sparks ignite the emptiness with futile effort. You are
 overwhelmed by... the gravity of the situation.

>examine bench

 Sparks crackle under the seat, in the safety of the alcove.

 The flames burst in a minor explosion, sending sparks all around the
 place.

 I'd be more polite with gravity, while balancing over a kilometer long
 chasm.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Last Steel Overlook</span>
 The chasm is under you. Its teeth close on the rails like the mouth of
 an all-devouring creature. You balance above nothing, an acrobat
 clinging to his own life, the only reasonable exit awaiting to the
 northeast.

 A broken wagon is dangling from the last of the rails, to the west.
 Light buzzes inside.

 The flames burst in a minor explosion, sending sparks all around the
 place.

 You find nothing of interest.

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quartz Tunnel</span>
 Crystal walls surround you, in every direction. To the south, they
 open to a more comfortable rock cave while, on the opposite direction,
 they separate in two different paths, to the northwest and east
 respectively.

>throw case

 As the case hits the ground it shatters to pieces. The crystals made
 their job.

>take all

 perfect machine: Taken.
 Elektron: Taken.

>inventory

 You're carrying an Elektron, a perfect machine, a wax soap, a disc
 labeled "Gamma", a black box, a steel bar, a new railway ticket, some
 Report files and an E-Pad.

>put gamma on cylinder

 You try the disk "Gamma" on the perfect machine. It fits perfectly,
 the lines protruding from it matching the cuts on the base. The four
 dots blink twice, then start strobing and dancing to the rhythm of
 some unheard music. The perfect machine flees from your hands and
 start levitating in front of you. Then, shrieking like a wraith, it
 flies away, jumping into the very ground and digging itself an escape.
 A fierce quake shakes the room like a cocktail mixer. Something must
 have occurred somewhere.

>go to nail

 You go into the gap.

 You go south to the cold pyramid, south again to the blinking room,
 east to the featureless corridor, east again to the featureless
 corridor, east again to the featureless corridor, north to the dark
 recess, north again to the dark lab and west to the nail.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nail</span>
 Another lab, where light is just a thick, yellow smoke at nose-height.
 All seems in place: the cabinets, the tables, the displays. Even a
 terminal, which sits on the northeast corner of the room, seems real
 enough to push the thought it could actually be functional.

 Where the enormous talon once stood, now is a black gap, opening on
 the west wall.

>go west

 You dare enter the black gap. Slowly proceeding, you find a way into
 another section of the settlements.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Windowed Habitat</span>
 You find yourself in an empty room, except for a large
 parallelepipedon standing in its center. The walls are dusty and
 black, the floor is mere concrete, coarse and unattended. A large
 mirror dresses the west wall, almost completely. Its presence betrays
 this room as an inspection laboratory, where dangerous things could be
 tested in a relative safe place. The mirror is probably a one way
 window for scientists to look through towards the outcome of their
 effort.

 <span class="floydstyle em">What is this,</span> you mutter to yourself. <span class="floydstyle em">What was examined</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">here?</span>

 The Elektron beeps twice in your hands.

 The thing that you thought was an alien, enormous talon, now pops in
 from the north wall, showing itself for what it is: a wheel. It was
 part of a big machine, now it is torn in two and useless.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Big idiot. Things are getting onto your nerves, isn't it?</span>

 You breathe slowly and regain your calm after a few moments.

>read elektron

 It reads: <span class="floydstyle em">No source. Expected link missing. Check status and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">connection</span>.

>examine parallelepiped

 It is simply a large piece of metal, closed onto something that
 protrudes from its top. Maybe a detention machine for things to be
 examined.

>put elektron on parallelepiped

 You link the Elektron to the parallelepipedon. The display on the
 device blinks twice: Some text appears on it.

 It reads: <span class="floydstyle em">Alpha radiation discovered. Alert. Alpha radiation</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">discovered. Alert. Do not activate. Do not activate.</span>

 Alpha radiation... we must be near the source. We must be near the
 cave.

>tap display

 A shock rumbles through your arms, as you are crossed by a huge power
 surge. You keep the balance by chance.

 The earth shakes a little, maybe adjusting itself.

>examine parallelepiped

 It is simply a large piece of metal, closed onto something that
 protrudes from its top. Maybe a detention machine for things to be
 examined.

 The Elektron is connected to the parallelepipedon.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Windowed Habitat</span>
 You find yourself in an empty room, except for a large
 parallelepipedon standing in its center. The walls are dusty and
 black, the floor is mere concrete, coarse and unattended. A large
 mirror dresses the west wall, almost completely.

 A round object protrudes from the parallelepipedon's top, a sort of
 circular maze. It is the last part of something bigger, evidently
 stuck inside the cage.

 The thing that you thought was an alien, enormous talon, now pops in
 from the north wall, showing itself for what it is: a wheel. It was
 part of a big machine, now it is torn in two and useless.

 The Elektron blinks faintly, connected to the parallelepipedon.

>examine maze

 A sort of metal cylinder, half stuck in the caging parallelepipedon,
 levigated beyond perfection by unknown forces. The exposed edge of the
 circular object is a tangle of tiny cuts, each twisted into the other
 in an unique pattern.

>examine wheel

 It doesn't look like an alien talon anymore.

>take cylinder

 It is stuck into the parallelepipedon.

>put soap on cylinder

 You press the wax soap onto the circular maze. One of the sides is now
 a perfect (reversed) replica of the circular maze itself.

 The light from the ceiling vibrates randomly, then it calms down.

>take soap

 You already have that.

>examine soap

 A remarkably old wax soap, one of the kind momma used to wash clothes
 when you were but a child. It now bears the impression of a circular
 maze.

>go to pentagon

 Before leaving, you remove the Elektron from the parallelepipedon.

 You go into the gap.

 You walk past the vibertron door, which silently opens around you.

 You go east to the nail, east again to the dark lab, south to the dark
 recess, south again to the featureless corridor, west to the
 featureless corridor, west again to the featureless corridor, west
 again to the blinking room, north to the cold pyramid, north again to
 the quartz tunnel, northwest to Quarantine and south to the pentagon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pentagon</span>
 A five-sided room, which the earthquake has just barely scratched.
 Five exits run from here, each marked with a letter, except for the
 one which stands blank on the north wall. To the northeast, a capital
 "A" hangs over a grate, which seems stuck to the walls, unopenable.
 Southeast, "B" rests over what remains of a tunnel that has caved in,
 some of the rocks fallen inside the room. Northwest and southwest,
 respectively, "C" and "D" sign two metal doors.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scanning Lab</span>
 This is yet another lab. The walls are made of the same old white
 plastic as the rest of the corridors that crowd the place. As opposite
 to the rest of the environment, this large room seems unscarred. The
 yellow floor is dotted by tracks in black-striped adhesives, drawing
 lines around the structure that rests in the center of the chamber.
 There is not much by the way of furniture, except for a single,
 foreign machine.

 A cube, three meters wide, sleeps in the very center of the room. A
 strong, tight bundle of wires moves from its bottom towards the
 eastern wall, where it disappears in a plug. Two bays are open on the
 machine's top. Something that looks like a laser cannon points at the
 right bay.

>put soap in left bay

 You put the wax soap (replicating a circular maze) into the left bay.

>examine right bay

 In the right bay is a metal weight (cut to resemble a wax soap
 (replicating a circular maze)).

 The laser beam cuts the metal weight, replicating the soap's surface.

>examine weight

 A kilogram. Almost perfect. A replica of the circular maze has been
 laser-cut onto it.

>take it

 Taken.

>go to windowed habitat

 You go into the gap.

 You find a way into another section of the settlements.

 You go northeast to the pentagon, north to Quarantine, southeast to
 the quartz tunnel, south to the cold pyramid, south again to the
 blinking room, east to the featureless corridor, east again to the
 featureless corridor, east again to the featureless corridor, north to
 the dark recess, north again to the dark lab, west to the nail and
 west again to the windowed habitat.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Windowed Habitat</span>
 You find yourself in an empty room, except for a large
 parallelepipedon standing in its center. The walls are dusty and
 black, the floor is mere concrete, coarse and unattended. A large
 mirror dresses the west wall, almost completely.

 A round object protrudes from the parallelepipedon's top, a sort of
 circular maze. It is the last part of something bigger, evidently
 stuck inside the cage.

 The thing that you thought was an alien, enormous talon, now pops in
 from the north wall, showing itself for what it is: a wheel. It was
 part of a big machine, now it is torn in two and useless.

>put weight on cylinder

 You try your mockup of an eventual disc on the circular maze. It fits
 perfectly, the lines protruding from it matching the cuts on the base.
 Lights from inside the parallelepipedon flash then start strobing and
 dancing to the rhythm of some unheard music.

 All of a sudden, the very room starts trembling, as if another fierce
 quake was shaking it around. The mirror vibrates but resists the
 shock, while the parallelepipedon and the strange object trapped
 inside it both sink in the ground, forever lost. The concrete shatters
 and closes over the hole like a worm's mouth.

 The jolt sends you flying again. The walls begin crumbling down, in a
 rehearsal of Doomsday. Something <span class="floydstyle em">very big</span> must have happened
 somewhere.

>go to hyerotrope

 You go east to the nail, east again to the dark lab, south to the dark
 recess, south again to the featureless corridor, west to the
 featureless corridor, south to the inside the hut, south again to the
 abandoned warehouse, east to the molten span, east again to the hollow
 grounds, northwest to the cave mouth and south to the hyerotrope.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hyerotrope</span>
 A dome of sorts has been carved in the earth, an inner sanctum of
 inhumane proportions, spanning for hundreds of meters in all
 directions. The wall's surface is smooth and shiny, cut into a dark
 material that looks like obsidian. On the ground, a maze of carvings
 draw perfect lines that intersect each other and run throughout the
 floor; all are filled by an ethereal substance as thin as air that
 glows in a faint blue. They seem to revolve around a single entity in
 the center of the gargantuan structure, and sink under its base. Many
 of these cuts then proceed over the structure, like an electric ivy
 clinging to it. Light shimmers from nowhere in particular and from all
 around at the same time, reverberating on the rock and on the steel
 floor. A faint buzz is the only noise audible, the rest of the
 universe swallowed in an uncomfortable, dark silence.

 The door in the Hyerotrope is now circled by an azure frame, as if
 light is shining from inside it.

 The demi-spheric bunker, a perfect inside-out replica of the halls
 around it, sits in the exact center of the room. It sinks into the
 ground as if pushed into it by some great force, a gap a few
 centimeters wide separating it from the floor. Its dark skin inflates
 and exhales like an ancient heart.

 What looks like a door draws a perfect rectangle on this side of the
 dome.

>examine azure

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine dots

 The dots look like tiny holes in the center of the "door", one above
 the other in a linear sequence. All the dots are currently off.

>touch door

 You push the frame. Now it vibrates with a greater charge. It trembles
 a bit and then, smoothly and silently, slides and opens a real door on
 the side of the dome. As you release your hands, it closes back with
 no sound. You are confident it will let you in, now.

>enter

 You must supply a noun.

>SAVE

>enter dome

 The door of the Hyerotrope opens and lets you in, finally.

 Upon entering, the Elektron bursts in flames, a power shock running
 through it like a technological virus. You have to drop it and witness
 how it is ultimately consumed. At the same time, the E-Pad in your
 hand sends its final beep.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Hyerotrope</span>
 A perfect sphere, cut in two by a substance that looks like glass and
 stands as a floor for an eventual passenger: This is what the
 Hyerotrope is. At the center of the stage, a cube rests like a sort of
 solitary chair. There is no visible way out and, although you are
 quite certain of where the door once was, it now has disappeared.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The tides. They have come.</span>

 You were not fast enough, and you realize it as splinters of the world
 surrounding you start floating in the air and all of a sudden cracks
 start opening everywhere. Without the Fatimah Initiative rolling, the
 whole of Monarch will be flooded by the rising oceans.

>examine cube

 A faint light glows inside the cube. Something makes you believe it's
 a sort of... uhm, pedestal.

>inventory

 You're carrying a dead E-Pad, a black box, a steel bar, a new railway
 ticket and some Report files.

>sit on cube

 When the world around finally falls, you take your time just to climb
 the glowing cube, and see what happens. Seconds later, the last fierce
 earthquake devours the world in a single gulp. A light so dense it can
 barely be endured fills the Hyerotrope and the dome starts breathing
 as if it was alive.

 Then, you are caught by the sensation of being pulled downwards, like
 a drunk man in an elevator...
 <span class="floydstyle em">Report to the Council about the discoveries around the Alpha</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Radiation</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">by Ektor Mastiff & Andy Re's</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">What we have here may be, thus far, the most important discovery</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">in human recent history, if not on a bigger scale. Upon scanning the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">recently exposed areas underneath the University basement (after the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">last minor quakes that interested the area) our team found a new kind</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of radiation -- from now on called "Alpha Radiation" (AR) -- springing</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">from a single spot under the second and third layers of crust. That</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">means beyond the icy layer, too.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">This radiation, the kind of which has never been measured before,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">has been fast growing in the last few weeks, reaching a point where it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">cannot be further ignored by the scientific committee. The latest of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">our discoveries stated without any shadow of a doubt that something</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">enormous is at stake.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">It was Dr. Re's that first linked the strange spectrum to the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">residual fingerprint of the Event energy burst, that "background</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">noise" that still plagues the Andromeda dark matter gravitational</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">pull, with the one relative to the AR. As noted by the scientific</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">crew, the Event residue is what is forcing the galaxy to shrink, due</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to its connection with potentials yet unknown which raise the mass of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the galaxy itself to the point where the universe's eternal expansion</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">is stopped and reversed. Now it looks like a similar energy is growing</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">under our city, less than three kilometers below the surface.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">What we suggest is a deep scan -- and maybe a human driven probe</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">-- in the interested area in order to find out what's happening down</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">there. The volcanic crust separating what was once the glacial layer</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">from the lower halls cannot possibly be thick enough to hold those</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">energies at bay. Nor can it be trusted to keep a region larger than</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">one third of Monarch's surface hidden from whatever it is that rests</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">down there. In my humble opinion, the chances that former</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">colonizations could have gotten in there before the glacial age</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">(trapped? self-defending?) are quite high, especially now that we have</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">discovered the Alpha-radiation.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">In the end, we know nothing about Monarch before the first</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">settlements from the outer galaxies came into Andromeda more than one</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">thousand years ago. Technology back then was not sufficient to dig as</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">far as we have recently, and the glacial layer was only partially</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">melted and covered by the constructs. I suggest further investigation</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">before we start -- as we should -- to probe the source of the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">radiation. The evidence of structures unknown to the humans is too</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">much to ignore.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">An example could be the existence of the Hyerotropes. These were</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">more than once hinted at as some sort of alien machinery used for</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">unknown purposes.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">A Hyerotrope -- or Gravitational Sphere -- is, indeed, an unknown</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">artifact. We can only suppose they landed on Monarch before the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">glacial layer was made, as the seventeen specimens found all were</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">under the icy layer or half protruding from it. The magnetic spectrum</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">they emit is actually almost purely geo-gravitational, with small</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">sparks of radio waves, and this suggests they were a sort of "anchor"</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">for something bigger which needed to stop by the surface.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Ultimate considerations about the Hyerotropes cannot be made, as</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">no-one has yet succeeded in truly activating them. Whatever the power</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">source which keeps the Spheres "alive", it must still be there, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">this is confirmed by the scattered energy ghosts that flow around</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">their perfect structures.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">And then there is the Alpha Radiation.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">We cannot tell for sure if it started developing in the last</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">weeks. We can only </span>suppose<span class="floydstyle em"> it was -NOT- there before Dr. Re's</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and his scientific crew discovered it. And we can </span>hope<span class="floydstyle em"> it is</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">nothing to worry about.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Still, hoping is not all we </span>have <span class="floydstyle em">to do.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">In the following chapters is a full report of how we came in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">contact with the AR, what we think about its relation to the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Hyerotropes, and a full analysis of its spectrum and wavelength.</span>

 The Hyerotrope stops. A door opens and you get out, breathing hard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ravines</span>
 The place is damp. You lift your eyes and what you see is -- again --
 breathtaking.

 You stand in the middle of a winding canyon, high several hundreds of
 meters and long as much. Luminescent cracks open on the walls,
 lighting up the place with a spectral voice. The ground seems to be
 polished as if human-made. The ravine goes on forever to the south and
 north of here.

 As you exit the Hyerotrope, the door closes behind you. Seconds later,
 the sphere starts glowing and begins flying upwards, until it
 disappears from where it came.

 You watch it speechlessly.

>examine cracks

 They are very similar to the thin cuts you saw crawling around the
 Hyerotrope. This time, though, the seem more coincidental.

>go north

 You travel the canyon for half an hour, until you come to...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Gate</span>
 The ravine ends here. A giant gate, bulky in its iron hinges, towers
 in front of you. Cranks and gears seem to operate it, from above the
 twelve meters tall columns at its sides. The canyon lurks away to the
 south.

 A metal ladder on the left of the gate climbs towards a cabin clinging
 steadily to the canyon's walls.

>go up

 You try and climb the ladder, not afraid of the missing rung. The
 second and third creak sinisterly as you try and reach for them. You
 need too much leverage to reach for the fourth peg.

>examine ladder

 Not the comfortable ladder you found in that waste basket. Here, rungs
 are divided by a gap of fifty centimeters. The very first rung is
 lost, a hole carving the left leg.

>put bar in ladder

 You try the bar, but it is too thick to fit. You need something
 smaller but equally strong.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dust to Dust</span>
 The canyon abruptly comes to an end. Although the unending ravine
 crawls deeper to the south, something is blocking your steps.

 When you recognize it, you fall to your knees.

 The train on which you begun your journey is here, fallen like an evil
 adumbration. Among it, several other wagons and a whole section of the
 upper city. They must have traveled a long way: part of the disaster
 is still clinging to the canyon's walls, ornaments of despair burning
 in flames and fumes. Wreckages mix with concrete, concrete mixes with
 the rests of the human race.

 A waterfall comes splashing down from a ledge a hundred meters above
 you. It must be the first result of the tides devouring what's above.

>examine train

 You are certain: This is the train you took in your futile trip to the
 now sunk University Campus. The laths are so distorted it would look
 like a crumpled ball of paper... if it was not for the black, charred
 human parts littering its intestines.

>enter train

 That is no longer viable as a vehicle. It's just a mess of contorted
 laminas.

>search train

 You know what you are looking for: something sturdy enough to sustain
 your weight and thin enough to fit the hole in that ladder.

 You rummage through the debris and the human rests until you find what
 you seek: a piece of a train's bench.

>take bench

 You already have that.

>examine bench

 A sturdy, metallic pole, once part of a bench from the train.

>examine human parts

 You can't sustain the sight.

>examine waterfall

 The oceans are devouring Monarch. Soon, a lot of water will come down,
 flooding this place.

 A metal ladder on the left of the gate climbs towards a cabin clinging
 steadily to the canyon's walls.

>put bench in ladder

 The new 'rung' perfectly fits. You stick it in a side of the ladder
 and force it into the other, and now it serves as a perfect anchorage.

>go up

 With the new rung in place, you find anchorage to climb inside the
 cabin.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Operator's Room</span>
 Dust is the main inhabitant, here, as one would have foreseen. It
 covers the wooden desk and the big windows on the north wall, the
 broken chair that now rests like a sleeping cat on the far corner of
 the cabin, and the ancient computing devices dropped dead on the
 table.

 The metal ladder descends to the south side of the gate.

 An old, battered diary rests on a corner of the wooden desk, its cover
 bloated by time and water. It looks miraculously intact.

 More of the military, today. I think I've opened the dam at least
 seventy times. I've seen the tanks and the cannons they bring in
 there. Can't tell for sure, but bet they are trying to open one of
 those balls of metal. It's been a rumble all day. A bit tired. The
 computers are off and I don't really like it here. It's getting boring

 was the general. That Hickk'errs, guy. I've seen his eyes. Those are
 blank eyes. He looks at you, but he's not really looking, you know?
 It's like his mind is always somewhere else. I've heard them talk,
 this morning. He and the <span class="floydstyle em">professor</span>. They said something about
 the <span class="floydstyle em">beacon</span>. They knew I was listenin but didn't care. They
 think I'm outta their league, that I dunno nothing. But I

 General said this morning a new set of experiments were going to be
 launched. They said no civilians would stay here, no matter what. I'm
 a civilian, too, in some way. I mean, I have the tags and all of that,
 but I'm not in charge of the weapons. So they think about me as some
 kind of white collar. They are going to do something dangerous down
 there. In the b***hole. They are gonna fire things at the metal balls.
 I'd like I was a civilian, for real. They are not lettin me go. They
 want me here to operate the dam. In case something goes wrong. If
 something goes wrong I wanna be in the other side of the universe,

 The world didn't end. I'm still here, opening and closing. Yesterday,
 tho, something occurred. There was a flash an then all the walls begun
 rumblin. It was not only the walls, but everything. The ceiling
 cracked and -- I swear -- a chunk of ice large like a <span class="floydstyle em">tank</span>
 came crushing down. It killed seven people. None I knew, fortunately.
 They were all so much in panic I thought the world was really gonna
 end. But then it all got normal and everything got back to quiet. No
 sign of the general, today. Guess he has to smell those things. He's
 never here when something occurs.

 I forgot to say something. During the tremors (it was not a quake,
 more of the ground adjusting, I've heard some say), something odd
 happened. The computers went suddenly on, just for ten seconds or so.
 The were all broken, you know. No signal for two months. But then they
 wake up and there's this white light. And all things begun moving
 towards that hole in the big chamber, the one just before the center
 of the earth. It looked like they were PULLED there by some sort of
 ghost.

 to that satellite but, what the hell, better than here, even my
 aunt's. The last days were horrible. More died on walls crumbling and
 the earth cracked once, spilling lava and rocks everywhere. I heard
 Marko is dead, too. They don't let anyone beyond the dam and I can't
 tell for sure, but I heard some say he got devoured by one of those
 spheres. "It has eaten him alive", they said. Poor Marko. I can't wait
 for the gathering. I wanna go home. Even if it takes me another three
 years like in the first trip.

 A slab of wood, fastened to the wall, with no legs. It is surmounted
 by a console, rust biting at it with no pity. On the table are some

>examine chair

 It lays by your feet, a wasted amount of metal and a stiff cushion.

>examine computer

 Dust is more than a soft layer on these. It just has become
 <span class="floydstyle em">part</span> of the old computers, like the shell for a nut. The
 screens have been broken -- one from the inside, the other punched in
 -- and there is no sign of a keyboard or a touch screen. The wires
 have been removed by force, and now just a knotted bunch of cords
 hangs loose and useless.

 Dust is more than a soft layer on these. It just has become
 <span class="floydstyle em">part</span> of the old computers, like the shell for a nut. The
 screens have been broken -- one from the inside, the other punched in
 -- and there is no sign of a keyboard or a touch screen. The wires

>examine console

 A set of rusted buttons and some light bulbs, blown or fused. The main
 object on the console is a plastic lever. You can only suppose it was
 used to open the big gate, downstairs.

>pull lever

 You maneuver the lever, but it doesn't budge. So, you decide to try
 harder. As a result, the lever breaks and the longer part ends in your
 hand, now useless.

 Won by discouragement, you yell a heartily <span class="floydstyle em">yaaugh!</span> and throw
 the lever at the windows in front of you. The windows themselves,
 battered by the cold winds of time, give with less effort and crash,
 opening a new outlet on the north side of the cabin.

>go north

 You pass through the newly opened window, careful not to cut your
 hands with the smashed glass, then descend to the floor with a leap.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mall</span>
 A river cuts this massive chamber in two. On the other side, its
 filled with stocks of any kind and size. On this one, it looks like a
 showcase of ancient war machinery, all lined up and packed for the
 show. A human-sized cave mouth exits to the north. Around it, all
 sorts of maze-like channels cut the earth and dive deep into the soil
 and walls.

 The broken lever you threw at the window is here, on the ground.

>take lever

 Taken.

>examine river

 It is a <span class="floydstyle em">bubbling</span> river. It comes from a crack in the north
 wall and dives into the earth a few meters below the gate walls. The
 bed must fish deep enough to be scalded by the molten layer.

>examine machinery

 This is military equipment. Tanks, cannons and so forth, all packed up
 and lined like a showcase in a very odd underground mall.

 On one of the packings you notice a resume of sorts. A single typed
 page, torn on one side, which title reads: "Essay on the Beacon,
 closing notes". You pick it up.

 Too far to distinguish. They look like scientific machines. No more to
 be known.

 There must be a better way to die, right? One less painful.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Center of the earth</span>
 You are in the cave. This is the ancient alcove and you are the first
 one to enter its vaults in a millennia. The cave opens in every
 direction. To the north, a higher ceiling welcomes two apparently
 abandoned objects.

>exits

 <span class="floydstyle em">[From here you can go north and south]</span>.

>examine objects

 A metallic form, barely discernible from this distance, and another
 Hyerotrope. Although you are quite far, you judge it to be at least
 two times bigger than the one you traveled into.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Memento Mori</span>
 The Hyerotrope is giving off light, a dense orange glow, and -- yes--
 it is bigger than the one you used as an elevator. At least five times
 bigger. Four big dots flare on it, all lined together like soldiers in
 formation. The whole cave, although gigantic, is lit by its energy.

 A strange object sits alongside the Hyerotrope, its rusty casing
 decaying and rotten.

>examine object

 Whatever it is, it must be alien in nature. You can't understand its
 form -- an octagonal prism surmounted by broken steel poles -- but
 surely recognize the solar panels that once must have powered it. A
 set of metallic legs holds it standing.

 A metal sign was planted by someone near its base.

>read sign

 <span class="floydstyle em">The last of the Ancestors.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Our beacon in this new world.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">- the First Colony</span>.

 You read the plaque in loud voice. After you've pronounced the last
 word, a flash of light cuts your sight.

 As you regain you senses, you notice a door which has opened on the
 side of the gargantuan Hyerotrope. Before you can do anything, a
 strong, invisible force pulls you into the sphere, dragging stones,
 rock, fungi and the alien artifact along with you.

 Once inside, you lift your eyes to the ceiling, expecting the same
 furniture as in your former experience.

 What you see, instead, is...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">It's full of Stars</span>
 You are nowhere and everywhere at the same time.

 Distances in here seem unbridgeable. Above, below, left, right,
 everywhere is just the brilliant, shiny emptiness of the Universe. You
 seem to float on the vacuum of space, only that you can breathe and
 live --  and this not unimportant.

 Near you, the metallic form has been torn in two by the rapture, and
 now rests on a side, open. A set of things bleeds from its interior.

>examine things

 The belly of the beast is open. A rectangular thing, the likes of
 which you are very familiar with, sits almost unscarred by the
 remnants of a tight bird's nest of wires and circuitry. A golden
 plate, inscribed with drawings that finally have a meaning, marks
 another metallic slab.





 The Hyerotrope starts moving.

 You are flooded again by the sensation of being pushed around, this
 time upwards. As you levitate, the surrounding stars slowly fade,
 until they are substituted by the reality of it all.

 And you see the end of History for what it is. The lands devoured by
 the quakes and the tides. Whole cities swallowed by the fierce
 strength of Fatimah's gravitational pull. The rest of the human race
 devoured. All while you are suspended mid air above the mayhem in the
 Hyerotrope's womb.
 After a while, another, smaller sphere starts climbing the sky,
 stopping at your height. And then a second, and a third. And in
 minutes they are dozens, levitating and rotating around the biggest
 one, which you inhabit.
 They begin wandering the cosmos, and your sphere does the same, slowly
 but relentlessly. As you leave the planet, a strong, white light
 begins pouring from the Hyerotropes and, finally, you understand.

 <span class="floydstyle em">That's it</span>, you mourn. <span class="floydstyle em">History repeats herself.</span>

 We came from another galaxy, this you know. We came here a millennia
 ago following one of our probes, looking for what the ASA First
 Council called "a New Heaven". We came here and barely survived a
 cosmic event that annihilated an entire galaxy and decimated life in
 those neighboring it.

 What was that Event and why did it occur no one will ever know. No one
 but you. You still lack the motivation but indeed have found out what
 it's like to be at the cyclone's eye. What can clear a galaxy off the
 screen.

 <span class="floydstyle em">The Hyerotropes. The plagues God sent upon the sinful mortals to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">begin the end. And we thought we could be able to control them.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">As if one could control the Apocalypse.</span>

 You get close to the rectangular player which fell off the ancient
 stellar beacon that now rests below you and straighten it, finding a
 perfect balance in the imploding universe. While everything that is is
 swallowed by the final, white fire, you admire that drawing -- a man
 and a woman, one alongside the other like twins in a child's sketch --
 and the hope it was infused with.
 Then, you activate the recording.

 Andromeda finally awakens, in its swan-song, while the first notes
 from the <span class="floydstyle em">Brandenburg Concerto No. 1 in F Major</span> start playing
 for the last time.

>beacon

 The 'beacon' is a probe an old race sent into the void to gather
 information about the universe. This is the only part in the game
 which is not fictional. If you are comfortable with space-related
 trivia, you may have recognized it: The golden laser disc, the male
 and female sketched drawings, the mathematically-perfect song from
 Bach. It is Voyager II. Our beacon in the sky.

 Yes, if you didn't get it, that's the sordid truth: Humanity in
 Andromeda came from our galaxy. It was our beloved Milky Way which was
 wiped off the radar by the Event. We are the Ancestors. Or, well... we
 WERE.

>wrong

 This game was not intended as a maniacally perfect scientific resource
 for space travel. That said, the author put so much effort in trying
 to make everything realistic. Apart from the obvious things that
 couldn't be (i.e. a train falling for a kilometer doesn't only
 crumple: it disintegrates) there is one which stood hidden until much
 too late.

 The 'beacon' has been pulled through space by the Hyerotropes. They
 made it fly at 6k times light-speed. If that's so... what about the
 humans? How could the First Colonists reach Andromeda WITHOUT such
 power and knowledge?

 Well, they couldn't.

 Given there is no Earth date in the game, one could argue that the
 voyage took a really huge amount of time and that the Colony indeed
 reached through space around -- what do you think? 10.000 a.D.?
 100.000? Well, nope: Andromeda is 2.5 MILLIONS lightyears from Earth.
 At the speeds we can reach nowadays, the trip would have lasted around
 90 BILLIONS years.

 The one solution can be the use of a wormhole, a rip in the fabrics of
 reality that creates a passage to distant places... but we all know
 that would have been a deus ex machina. That's why it is not mentioned
 ingame.

>afterwords

 I was in my car, early summer of 2011, driving my wife to our mountain
 resort, when I started teasing her with some scientific trivia about
 the galaxy of Andromeda. Kid was in the backseat, already dozed off,
 the sun did shine and the birds were singing. I begun flapping my
 never-stopping mouth about distances, dimensions, the sheer number of
 stars involved, when she begun yawning. I got the message and shut up.

 But didn't shut up on the <span class="floydstyle em">inside</span>.

 That is how my first IF story had birth. I run to the house, turned on
 my Macbook Air (freshly acquired, and just a week before the release
 of the new one, ouch) and begun coding again, never fully realizing I
 was going to complete the task, for the first time ever.

 I've first played and then tried to write IF in the mid-Eighties. I
 was nearly a teen, the world was splendid and everything quite worked
 for the best. The amount of time I could devote to my hobbies was
 impressive. <span class="floydstyle em">The Hobbit</span> was always running and I was
 struggling a lot trying to understand english and what to do with that
 singing bastard Thorin the dwarf. More that a quarter of century has
 passed, and I'm still here, messing with trolls and an english parser.
 Meanwhile, almost ten -- or twenty, who can tell? -- adventure games
 have danced on my screen waiting to be designed and coded. I never got
 much beyond the few introductory rooms.
 The occasion came when I stumbled upon the <span class="floydstyle em">IFComp</span>. Edition
 2011 was about to open and I had a game halfway to being finished that
 could maybe, and just maybe, fit in. All I had to do was deciding how
 the world of Monarch was going to be saved and how I could code that
 damn soap-over-metal puzzle.

 Summer passed by in a whoosh, and by the end of September the game was
 ready.

 Or so I thought.

 ---

 Coding a kind of game which is by far the most similar thing to a
 novel that could exist in a language that is not one's own is a rather
 terrific experience. Although I'm quite fluent in English and have
 classes listening to me from all around the globe -- I'm a graphic
 designer and expert on editorial design, which I teach in what you'd
 call a Master School for Gifted Youngsters -- I soon discovered that
 the river which spans between the speech and the writing is a very
 wide and turbulent one. Fortunately, my first proofreaders did an
 awesome job in putting straight my bulky texts (yeah: if you'd seen
 <span class="floydstyle em">Andromeda</span> before their intervention, you'd think this one
 was, like, Hemingway).
 So, I entered the Comp. For one and a half months, I've been in awe. I
 don't think I was exactly <span class="floydstyle em">aware</span> of what I've stepped into.
 I'm willing to believe that, if I'd known, I'd rather go around naked
 downtown than publish a game in so a renowned competition.

 And that was nice, 'cause I had the opportunity, otherwise precluded,
 to step into a new, fascinating world. I had an audience. I had
 critics. I had a <span class="floydstyle em">chance</span>.

 I wanted to be a writer all my life. Since when ten years old, I
 filled notebooks with short tales and novels-wannabe. I actually did
 write a novel, one that is trying to find a place in the horrible
 italian fiction maelstrom, but I never had someone other than my wife
 or friends read anything that's mine. Now it seems, looking at the
 number in the online transcript of the first release of this game,
 more than 600 people have tried my game. On IFDB (at the time this is
 being written), <span class="floydstyle em">Andromeda</span> averages on 3 stars, with the
 German scene gifting me with 4.
 I don't really know how this second release will fare, out there. What
 I know is that one of my strongest desires, the one I keep asking the
 sky to make real whenever I see a falling star, has become solid
 truth. And that's more than what one would sell his soul to hell for,
 believe me.

 Now, only time will tell if I can be a writer or have to stick with
 graphics. But if I die tomorrow, at least I won't go away saying
 "nobody has ever read my work". Thank you all who participated. This
 was a blast.
