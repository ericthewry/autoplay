 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Disenchantment Bay</span>
 A speed-IF by Jacqueline A. Lott, with a head start from Emily Short
 Release 1 / Serial number 130106 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle em">Disenchantment Bay</span> was an entry in the Ultimate Not Numbered
 New Year's Speed IF, 2013.

 For more about this game, please type ABOUT and CREDITS.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin</span>
 The front of the small cabin is almost entirely occupied with
 navigational instruments, a fish finder, and radios for calling back
 to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions,
 which can be lifted to reveal the storage space underneath. There is a
 glass case against the wall.

 Slightly scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and
 there is a door aft to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces
 the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.

 The captain sits at the wheel, steering the boat and occasionally
 checking the depth finder readout.

>about


 The twelve Inform 7 examples collectively known as <span class="floydstyle em">Disenchantment</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Bay</span> were born of a trip that Emily Short made with Dan Shiovitz
 to Alaska to visit me and Sam Kabo Ashwell, many years ago.  2004, I
 believe it was.  We chartered a boat from the Yakutat Charter Boat
 Company to visit Hubbard Glacier, and before heading home we scooped
 up some bits of glacier ice for the creation of fancy mixed drinks
 once back on shore.

 So when Marius M\xfcller announced that the theme of this year's New
 Year's speed-IF mini-comp whatever-it-is thing was to "take an
 example, any example from the I7 Documentation and expand it into a
 fullblown game," I started skimming the documentation and realized
 that this one was the one for me.  Unforuntately, I realized it three
 hours before the deadline, but hey &mdash; back in the day the time limit
 was two hours.  And then there's this other tradition where you don't
 finish your speed-IF on time, so I decided to stay up way late and
 actually spent about five and a half hours coding this, all told.

 Oh, and then Marius extended the deadline, so I broke yet another
 speed-IF rule and had the game go through a bit of light beta testing.

 You might also want to type CREDITS to read who helped out with this.

>credits


 Thanks to Graham Nelson and Emily Short for including Disenchantment
 Bay as an example in Inform 7.  And thanks to them for Inform 7
 itself.  Thanks to Sam Kabo Ashwell and Emily Short the coding help,
 and thanks to Justin de Vesine, Sam Kabo Ashwell, and Adri for a
 smidgeon of last-minute beta testing, though of course all the issues
 remaining are my own.

 And finally, thanks to the Yakutat Charter Boat Company for all those
 (real) trips to Hubbard Glacier over the years... rest assured, the
 skippers of the actual real-world YCBC are great, always level-headed,
 and not at all like the captain in this story.  Except that they do
 know quite a bit about glaciers.  And they do tell bad jokes.  But
 they're one of the better outfits in town if you want to charter a
 boat to the face of Hubbard Glacier!

>examine me


 You have dreamed of coming to Alaska your entire life, and you're
 finally here.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a backpack (closed)
   a pair of sunglasses (being worn)

>open backpack


 You open the backpack, revealing a warm beer.

 You hear a low rumble, like thunder, that tells you the glacier's
 calved off another ice berg somewhere nearby.

>examine glasses


 The light off the water and the ice does get pretty bright sometimes.
 You're glad you brought these... who'd have thought they'd come in
 handy in rainy southeastern Alaska?

>examine case


 In the glass case is a fishing rod.

>score


 You have so far scored 0 out of a possible 10, in 6 turns.

>examine beer


 An Alaskan Amber, made not far from here, in Juneau.

 Little bits of glacier ice scratch against the ship's hull.

>examine menu


 You can get half-day and full-day sight-seeing tours, and half-day and
 full-day fishing trips.

>examine captain


 The Captain is wearing a baseball cap and carrying a small silver key.

>ask captain about key


 (To communicate in this story, TALK TO the captain.)


>talk to captain


 "You know," says the captain, "I never get sick of coming up here.
 It's just so beautiful."

 Somewhere close, the glacier makes a sound like a shotgun going off.

>get ice


 That's hardly portable.

>examine cushions


 They look well-worn, sort of scuffed and dingy on the edges, shiny in
 the center where many a person before you has sat.

>open cushions


 You open the storage compartment, revealing a net and a warm Coke.

 Little bits of glacier ice scratch against the ship's hull.

>get bits


 Perhaps you could get some ice if you were on the back deck of the
 boat.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin</span>
 The front of the small cabin is almost entirely occupied with
 navigational instruments, a fish finder, and radios for calling back
 to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions,
 one of which is currently lifted to allow access to the storage
 compartment within. There is a glass case against the wall.

 Slightly scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and
 there is a door aft to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces

 The captain sits at the wheel, steering the boat and occasionally
 checking the depth finder readout.

>examine finder


 "Why do you have the fish finder on when we're not going fishing?" you
 ask.

 "Well, it <span class="floydstyle em">does</span> help you find fish, but it's also useful for
 knowing how deep the water is beneath the boat.  We wouldn't want to
 get into water that was too shallow."

 You can't get your mind off of that fishing pole you saw in the main
 cabin.

 Somewhere out of sight, you hear a giant splash.

>open case


 "Hey, don't break my case, I've got a key..." scolds the captain.  He
 smiles and says, "...and I'll give it to ya, if you'd be so kind as to
 get me something cold to drink."

 Huh.  You thought <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> were paying <span class="floydstyle em">him</span> to do stuff.
 But then, he's the one making sure the boat stays safe, and that's
 important, so the least you can probably do is find him something to
 drink.

>find fish


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>search for fish


 Sadly, you haven't any bait or traps, so your chances of encountering
 creatures from the depths is slim.

>aft

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deck</span>
 The whole back half of the boat is open, allowing you to view the
 surroundings without intervening windows &mdash; if you can stand the cold.

 All around the boat bob chunks of glacier ice.

 You can also see a cooler (closed) here.

 You hear a bird cry off in the distance, but can't seem to locate it.

>take net and pop


 You can't see any such thing.

>open cooler


 You open the cooler.

>look in it


 The cooler is empty.

>put ice in cooler


 Little bits of glacier ice scratch against the ship's hull.

 You hear an odd barking, almost roaring sound, far off.
 ...could there be sea lions around here?  Gosh, there probably could
 be.

>put beer in cooler


 You place the beer inside the cooler.

>take ice


 You are having a hard time fishing out the ice with your bare hands.

 piece of glacier ice: You dump the ice from the net into the ice

 You keep thinking about that lovely fishing rod in the glass cabinet,

 You make out a faint scratching sound, like ice rubbing against the
 boat.



 You place the beer inside the cooler.

 You see nothing special about the cool Coke.

 You must name something more substantial.

 The glacier is quiet for a moment, and you realize it's been making so

 "Ah, that's great!  Thank you," he says. How he can drink an iced soda
 on a day like today boggles your mind... but then again, you've heard
 some crazy statistic that Alaskans eat the most ice cream, per capita,
 of any US state.

 You're not sure you believe that, though.

 I guess I promised you the key to that case, didn't I?  Here ya go."
 He tosses you the silver key.

 You hear the water lap gently against the boat.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

 You have so far scored 2 out of a possible 10, in 37 turns.

>kiss captain


 That's not exactly part of what you had in mind for this vacation.

>unlock case with key


 You unlock the glass case.

>open case. take rod


 You open the glass case, giddy with the idea of using the fishing rod.

 Little bits of glacier ice scratch against the ship's hull.

 You seize the rod triumphantly (you really should get out more) and
 head onto the deck of the boat to engage in a bit of light casting.
 The boat wasn't set up to go fishing today &mdash; you chartered the boat
 just to come see the glacier &mdash; so there's no bait on board.  Still,
 it's fun to practice your casting...
>push space

 Useful for knowing how deep the water is, so you don't end up on a
 reef like Captain Hazelwood.

 Damn, the captain is kind really not handling this emergency well.
 You're probably going to have to take matters into your own hands.

 You see something leap out of the water... did it have a
 <span class="floydstyle em">horn??</span>

 "Um, did you feel something?"

>talk to captain


 The captain doesn't seem to be making much sense, but his swears are
 creative.

 You and the captain both search the water frantically.

>examine water


 The water is an oddly milky grey, a consequence of all the sediment
 stirred up by the glacier.  The wind makes the water ripple, with
 occasional tiny whitecaps.

 "That... nah, can't be.  I've never seen one of them this far
 south..." says the captain.

 occasional tiny whitecaps.

 "Make that <span class="floydstyle em">triple</span>."



 You can't see any such thing.



 It is fixed in place.

 The captain says, "Holy shit.  What was that?"

>use radio


 You get on the radio and send out a May Day.  And an SOS.  And a
 panicked scream.

 It takes nearly an hour for help to arrive, and of course by the time
 the search and rescue folks show up, all the excitement is over.
 "Wait, why did you call for us?  There's nothing wrong with you..."
 scolds the lead rescuer.

 "Well,"  the captain begins, "there was this scary sea creature
 bumping against the boat &mdash;"

 "I swear it was a narwhal!" you interject.  The captain throws you a
 quick sideways glance as if to say, "Yes, it sure as hell did look
 like a narwhal, but we're not going to tell <span class="floydstyle em">him</span> that."

 Suffice it to say, you're the laughing stock of the local village, but
 that's okay: you're alive, you had an incredible Alaskan adventure.

>amusing


 Have you tried talking to the captain at length?
 Or fiddling with the fish finder until you upset him?
 You could search for wildlife to pass the time.
 Oh, and did you drunk all the beer?

 There's a huge splash to starboard.

 You can hear the captain ranting about something in the cabin.  It
 sounds like his words might be interlaced with swears.

>get beer


 Taken.

 The captain is obviously not thinking straight.  You might not be an
 Alaskan boat captain, but surely there's a way out of this.  Think!

 You can hear the captain screaming about something in the cabin.  It
 sounds like his words might be interlaced with swears.

>drink beer


 You open the beer, which sounds as if it still has some fizz to it,
 and you take a sip.

 Okay, that's oddly refreshing, despite making you feel even colder

 A speed-IF by Jacqueline A. Lott, with a head start from Emily Short
 Release 1 / Serial number 130106 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle em">Disenchantment Bay</span> was an entry in the Ultimate Not Numbered
 New Year's Speed IF, 2013.

 For more about this game, please type ABOUT and CREDITS.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin</span>
 The front of the small cabin is almost entirely occupied with
 navigational instruments, a fish finder, and radios for calling back
 to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions,
 which can be lifted to reveal the storage space underneath. There is a
 glass case against the wall.

 Slightly scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and
 there is a door aft to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces
 the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.

 The captain sits at the wheel, steering the boat and occasionally
 checking the depth finder readout.

>examine finder


 "Why do you have the fish finder on when we're not going fishing?" you
 ask.

 "Well, it <span class="floydstyle em">does</span> help you find fish, but it's also useful for
 knowing how deep the water is beneath the boat.  We wouldn't want to
 get into water that was too shallow."

>examine finder


 Useful for knowing how deep the water is, so you don't end up on a
 reef like Captain Hazelwood.

>examine finder


 Useful for knowing how deep the water is, so you don't end up on a
 reef like Captain Hazelwood.

 Somewhere close, the glacier makes a sound like a shotgun going off.

>turn finder


 It is fixed in place.

>examine sign


 You can get half-day and full-day sight-seeing tours, and half-day and
 full-day fishing trips.

>look for fish


 Sadly, you haven't any bait or traps, so your chances of encountering
 creatures from the depths is slim.

 You hear the water lap gently against the boat.

>switch off finder


 You switch off the depth finder.  The captain looks at you, frowning,
 and turns it right back on again.

>switch off finder


 You switch it off the depth finder again.  The captain says, "Hey,
 don't touch that."

>switch off finder


 You slowly sneak your hand up when you think the captain's not looking
 and switch the depth finder off.

 "Look," says the captain, "that's not funny, and I'm definitely not
 amused, and I don't care if you want to hit a rock or whatever your
 death-wish is, but this is my boat and you need to keep your hands off
 of stuff.  Got it?"

 You nod, but for some reason he doesn't look like he believes you.

 Somewhere out of sight, you hear a giant splash.

>examine splash


 There've been all sorts of splashes all morning: some small, like when
 a seal hops off an iceberg or a diving bird goes after a fish, and
 others immense, such as when the glacier calves off another giant
 piece of ice.

>switch off finder


 You reach up to touch the depth finder, and the captain slaps your
 hand.  <span class="floydstyle em">Ouch!</span>

>listen


 You hear the low rumble of the boats engine idling.

 You hear the water lap gently against the boat.

>slap captain


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kill captain


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>examine narwhale


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine narwhal


 Silly kid, narwhals live a lot farther north than this.

>fiddle with finder


 You go to turn off the depth finder, and the captain goes to slap you
 again.

 You decide not to turn off the depth finder.

 You make out a faint scratching sound, like ice rubbing against the
 boat.

>listen


 You hear the low rumble of the boats engine idling.

>aft


 (first opening the cabin door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deck</span>
 The whole back half of the boat is open, allowing you to view the
 surroundings without intervening windows &mdash; if you can stand the cold.

 All around the boat bob chunks of glacier ice.

 You can also see a cooler (closed) here.

>listen


 This isn't at all like home: no car alarms, no sirens, just... nature.

 Little bits of glacier ice scratch against the ship's hull.

>touch ice


 You feel nothing unexpected.

>open backpack


 You open the backpack, revealing a warm beer.

>drink beer


 You're not really in the mood for a warm beer.

 You hear a bird cry off in the distance, but can't seem to locate it.

 You hear an odd barking, almost roaring sound, far off.
 ...could there be sea lions around here?  Gosh, there probably could
 be.

>listen to bird


 They're far too far away, and besides, wild animals are best left
 alone.

>pet whal


 That's not a verb I recognise.



 You can't see any such thing.

>pet whale


 That's not a verb I recognise.



 You do not want to sleep with the fishes.

>examine icebergs


 Bergs of various sizes bob up and down all around you, some of them
 nearly as large as the boat, others small enough to hold in your hand.
 They are so thick in the bay that the boat occasionally must scrape
 against them to make its way through the water, but the captain is
 skilled at this, and the hull is solid enough to do this at slow
 speeds.

 Off in the distance, you can see a harbor seal and her pup hauled out
 on one of the larger, flatter bergs.

 You hear the glacier pop, far in the distance.

>examine harbor seal


 There are harbor seals everywhere, and as the boat drifts and changes
 direction, it's hard to keep track of any one seal in particular.
 Quite close to the boat, though, you see a seal swimming through the
 water.  It looks a bit like a sleek, wet, spotted dog in profile, but
 it swims more gracefully than any dog you've ever seen.  Suddenly it
 turns, makes eye contact, and bobs before making what appears to be a
 deep dive.

>listen to seal


 They're far too far away, and besides, wild animals are best left
 alone.



 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look for sea lions


 Hm, yeah, there could be sea lions up here, you suppose... you search
 the shore, and sure enough, there is a group of them hauled out on the
 eastern shore of the bay.

 Little bits of glacier ice scratch against the ship's hull.

>look for godzilla


 You can't see any such thing.

>look for penguins


 Didn't you hear?  The North American penguin is endangered.  Your
 chances of seeing one are really, <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> low.

>look for polar bear


 There aren't any of those here, and even if there were, wild animals
 are best left alone.  <span class="floydstyle em">Especially</span> polar bears.

>look for inuit


 You can't see any such thing.

>listen to penguins


 Look, penguins live in the southern hemisphere, not here, you idiot.

 Somewhere close, the glacier makes a sound like a shotgun going off.

>examine glacier


 The Hubbard Glacier appears, at this distance, as a towering wall of
 ice.  It rises nearly three hundred feet high from the waterline, and
 the wind off its face chills you noticeably, despite the sunny day.
 You have to wonder if the boat is far enough away from the glacier
 should an entire column of ice break free... but you know that the
 captain knows these waters extremely well and that he'll get you close
 enough for the experience you paid for, but will keep his boat in the
 clear.

>dive


 You do not want to sleep with the fishes.

>xyzzy


 Isn't this place magical enough for you?

 You hear the water lap gently against the boat.

>plover


 Yes, yes there are small brown birds around here.  Well done.

>jump


 You jump on the spot, but not without fruit: the boat seems to rock,
 ever so slightly from your efforts.

>look for emily


 You can't see any such thing.

>sing


 Your singing is abominable.

 You make out a faint scratching sound, like ice rubbing against the
 boat.

>examine me


 You have dreamed of coming to Alaska your entire life, and you're
 finally here.

>lick ice


 You taste nothing unexpected.

>lick birds


 They're far too far away, and besides, wild animals are best left
 alone.

 You hear the water lap gently against the boat.

>look for mammoth


 You can't see any such thing.

>lick boat


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine boat


 You can't see any such thing.

>look for wildlife


 You suppose in a place this wild there must be animals everywhere, and
 where you look will dictate what you see.  The seals seem to be on the
 icebergs, for instance, but you'd probably only see a bear if you were
 specifically looking for one on the distant shore.

>search shore


 That's far too far away.

>examine shore


 The shores on both sides of the bay, which are quite far off, appear
 to be pretty rocky.  Just beyond them, thick vegetation lines the
 shore, quickly sloping up and away into terrain too steep to easiliy
 climb.  You skim the beach, looking for bears, because the captain
 said there was a pretty good chance of seeing one.

 Somewhere out of sight, you hear a giant splash.

 You hear an odd barking, almost roaring sound, far off.
  It's those sea lions again.

>examine it

 shore, quickly sloping up and away into terrain too steep to easiliy
 climb.  You skim the beach, looking for bears, because the captain
 said there was a pretty good chance of seeing one.

>look for bears


 You scan the beach, knowing that sometimes bears come down to look for
 clams or other tidepool foods &mdash; and you see one!  This one is a large
 grizzly.

>talk to bear


 It's far too far away, and besides, wild animals are best left alone.

 You hear a bird cry off in the distance, but can't seem to locate it.

>watch bear


 There's a grizzly bear on the rocky beach, flipping over rocks in
 search of food. It sniffs the ground, checking something out.



 You can't see any such thing.

>oops grizzly


 There's a grizzly bear on the rocky beach, flipping over rocks in
 search of food. It nudges a stone with its snout.

>again


 There's a grizzly bear on the rocky beach, flipping over rocks in
 search of food. How cool &mdash; it appears to have found a clam.  It takes
 a seat, pries the shell open, and enjoys some lunch.

 You hear the glacier pop, far in the distance.

>look in backpack


 In the backpack is a warm beer.

>put beer in cooler


 You open the cooler and place the beer inside the it.

>look in cooler


 In the cooler is a warm beer.

 You make out a faint scratching sound, like ice rubbing against the
 boat.

>again


 In the cooler is a warm beer.



 You see no reason to put the backpack in the cooler.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a backpack (open but empty)
   a pair of sunglasses (being worn)

 Somewhere close, the glacier makes a sound like a shotgun going off.

>go east


 Compass directions make no sense on this tiny boat, but you can use
 AFT and FORE (abbreviated as A or F) to move around.

 You dump the ice from the net into the ice chest.

>examine beer


 An Alaskan Amber, made not far from here, in Juneau.

 You hear the water lap gently against the boat.

 You hear an odd barking, almost roaring sound, far off.
  It's those sea lions again.

>remove glasses


 You take off the pair of sunglasses.

>look in cooler


 In the cooler are a piece of glacier ice and a cold beer.

>get beer then drink it


 Taken.

 You make out a faint scratching sound, like ice rubbing against the
 boat.

 You open the beer, which sounds as if it still has some fizz to it,
 and you take a sip.

 Okay, that's oddly refreshing, despite making you feel even colder
 than you already were.

>drink beer


 Yeah, nice and smooth.

>drink beer


 You enjoy another sip, and decide that you may have to buy a case of
 this stuff to take home.

 You hear a bird cry off in the distance, but can't seem to locate it.

>drink beer


 Ahhh, this is good.  Wonder if they brew any other good stuff.  Maybe
 you'll do a layover in Juneau on the way home, and take a tour of the
 Alaskan Brewing Company's facility.  That'd be fun.



 This isn't at all like home: no car alarms, no sirens, just... nature.

>drink beer


 Okay, darn, this seems like the last sip, and it's mostly just
 backwash.

 You hear the water lap gently against the boat.

>drink beer


 Yep, that was it.  No more beer.



 You can't see any such thing.

>drink beer


 Sorry, all gone.

 calved off another ice berg somewhere nearby.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cabin</span>
 The front of the small cabin is almost entirely occupied with
 navigational instruments, a fish finder, and radios for calling back
 to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions,
 one of which is currently lifted to allow access to the storage
 compartment within. There is a glass case against the wall.

 Slightly scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and
 there is a door aft to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces
 the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.

 The captain sits at the wheel, steering the boat and occasionally
 checking the depth finder readout.

>talk to captain


 "You know," says the captain, "I never get sick of coming up here.
 It's just so beautiful."

>again


 "It is incredibly surreal up here by the glacier," you say, "thanks
 for bringing me up here."

 "Yeah, I'd say 'You're welcome,' except that, y'know, you're paying me
 pretty well to do this."

 You hear the water lap gently against the boat.

>again


 "So, where's all this ice coming from?"

 "Way up in those mountains, over seventy miles from here.  This is the
 longest tidewater glacier in North America.  The ice takes decades to
 travel this far."

>give captain glasses


 The Captain doesn't seem interested.

>talk to captain


 "Really?" you ask. "Just decades?  I thought glacier ice was, like,
 ancient or something."

 "Well, I guess some glacier ice might be, but this glacier moves
 pretty fast, so the ice calves off into the sea and melts before it
 can get too old."

 Somewhere close, the glacier makes a sound like a shotgun going off.

>listen to captain


 The captain is quiet, watching the instruments and navigating the
 boat.

>talk to captain


 "So, why's some of the ice blue?" you ask.

 "It's because of how dense the ice is... the ice absorbs most of the
 light and in some spots all that escapes is the blue."

>again


 "Why's the water so chalky looking?"

 "Man, you're just full of questions, aren't you?" The captain looks a
 little bit annoyed, but he recovers quickly. "It's because as the
 glacier moves through the mountains it grinds down rock, some of it
 into a fine powder, and it carries that powder in all the water runoff
 and stuff, and so eventually that spills out into the ocean and close
 to the glacier all that sediment gets churned up in the water, so it
 looks like that."

 You make out a faint scratching sound, like ice rubbing against the
 boat.

 You hear an odd barking, almost roaring sound, far off.
  It's those sea lions again.

>again


 "Say, you want to hear a joke?" the captain asks, switching tracks.
 You shrug and nod your head.

 "Have you seen that movie, <span class="floydstyle em">Titanic</span>?"  You nod your head.
 "And have you seen <span class="floydstyle em">The Sixth Sense</span>?"  You nod your head
 again.   The captain leans forward, grinning childishly, "You know
 what those two films have in common??"

 You think about it for a second.  "Um, no," you admit.

 "ICY DEAD PEOPLE!"  He laughs, like this is the first time he's ever
 told this joke (you're actually quite sure it's more like the
 millionth).  "Get it?  I SEE DEAD PEOPLE!"

>cry


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>laugh


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to captain


 "Want to hear another joke?"  You're about to tell him no, when he
 says, "Why did the shark wear a tuxedo?  Because he was dressed to
 kill!"

 Oh, brother.

>talk to captain


 "Okay, okay, you'll love this next one," says the captain.  "How do
 harbor seals like their soda?  ON THE ROCKS!"

 The captain laughs hard at first, then looks around at all the ice
 bergs and to the shore not far away, and his laughter sputters out.
 "I guess that's not too funny, huh, us being in a boat and all."

 The glacier is quiet for a moment, and you realize it's been making so
 much noise you're surprised by the silence.

>talk to captain


 "Wait," you point out. "You thought that <span class="floydstyle em">Titanic</span> joke was
 hilarious, but the silly harbor seal joke is unnerving?"

 Silence from the captain.  I think he's pretending not to have heard
 you.

>talk to captain


 The captain seems quiet, with nothing more to say.

>look for icebergs


 They're beautiful, and you could probably take a small one if you had
 the right tool, but really, they're better admired from afar for the

 Everything has its less dignified parts. There are toilets to be
 scrubbed, linens to be laundered -- and down in the basement pantry,
 there is room-service to be prepared and delivered.

 Here, all is functional: tiled walls and floor, a desk, a telephone, a
 refrigerator. Your job is simple. Wait for orders, then trundle off to
 collect them and deliver them to the guests. Nothing to it. The
 service elevator is south. The guest elevator (which you are not
 supposed to use) is north. The kitchen is northeast.

>examine me


 Resigned to working in this dump.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   your pass key

 A mouse sidles in from a crack in the tiles.

>examine mouse


 Not a surprise, of course, to see such a thing in this particular part
 of this particular establishment. In your idler moments you wonder
 whether mice (wasps, rats, cockroaches) might be some sort of argument
 against the existence of any intelligent designer. What purpose can
 they possibly serve? What are they good for?

>catch mouse


 You are not fast enough. The mouse scuttles away, and squeezes itself
 out of sight.

>go northeast


 Uniquely, perhaps, among the staff of this hotel, you intend to do
 your duty. Which -- at present -- requires you to stay here. You can
 leave once you have an order.

>examine telephone


>examine service elevator
 Dark grease stains the handset and covers the cord.

 Rodent eyes seem to watch opportunistically from a crevice beside the
 service elevator.



 Where the guest elevator is fast, clean and efficient, the service
 elevator is slow, grubby and ... broken. As usual. A notice to this
 effect is taped to the door.

 The telephone begins to ring.

>answer phone


 You pick up the receiver.

 A woman's voice: "Room service? This is room 5701."

 Room 5701, the Penthouse Suite.

 "I am in the mood for some sushi, some fresh sushi. Could you bring
 some, please? As quick as you can?"

>examine fridge


 Intended to hold food and drink for immediate service. Intended,
 presumably, to hold them in a cool condition. Which it doesn't.
 Because it's on the blink. It's closed.

 "Sorry? Did you say something?" the voice on the other end of the line
 continues. "The line is not altogether satisfactory."

 There is indeed a strange whistling and squeaking, and you can hardly
 hear her.

 "Sushi! Fresh sushi! As quick as you can." The voice is imperious.

 Then silence. Whether she has put down the phone, or whether it has
 simply stopped functioning you cannot tell. But this much you know:
 you need to find some sushi.

>read notice


 A handwritten notice "Out of Order. Engineer called." A fixture: it
 has been here, on and off, a long as you have, and you confidently
 expect it to outlast you.

 Rodent eyes seem to watch opportunistically from a crevice beside the
 service elevator.

>open fridge


 You open the refrigerator, revealing a piece of cheese.

 You close the refrigerator.

 Everything has its less dignified parts. There are toilets to be
 scrubbed, linens to be laundered -- and down in the basement pantry,
 there is room-service to be prepared and delivered.

 Here, all is "functional" (i.e., ugly): tiled walls and floor, a desk,
 a telephone, a broken refrigerator. The service elevator (which is
 broken) is south. The guest elevator (which you are going to have to
 use instead) is north. The kitchen is northeast.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hotel Kitchen</span>
 Not quite your standard kitchen. No cabinet. No sink. No stove, or
 oven, or drawer. Instead you see an empty room, in the centre of which
 is a gleaming machine, supposedly capable of producing any food that
 the guests desire. Could it be more simple? All you need do is ask for
 some sushi.

 The hotel's chef, Monsieur Micronde, stands proudly by the machine.

 As soon as he sees you, he bustles over. "No! No! No! What are you
 doing in here without a hairnet? Have you no consideration for the
 hygiene?" He hands you a hairnet, which you dutifully wear.

>examine machine


 A stainless steel cube, standing taller than a man. Every surface is
 covered with dials, lights, screens, knobs, levers, handles, buttons,
 keypads and valves. A vast glass tank filled with greenish material
 sits on top of it. The side is blazoned "Gastroreactor: Reversing the
 Natural Order".

>ask machine for sushi


 That can only be done to something animate.

>ask monsieur for sushi


 "Oh, but of course, that will be not at all a problem. She is
 Japanese, the machine. She will produce the most exquisite sushi."

 The machine pops and produces copious quantities of grey smoke. As the
 smoke clears, you see that it has produced a hamburger.

 Monsieur Micronde stares at it. "The machine," he says, "she has her
 little moments, her little tempests and tantrums. All will correct
 itself." He fiddles with the buttons.

>take hamburger


 You take the burger.

>ask monsieur for hamburger


 A smile spreads over the Chef's face. "This," he says, "she will most
 assuredly produce with ease."

 The chef twiddles with the dials, pulls a lever, and stands back while
 the machine grinds and whirrs and finally, with a belch of pale green
 vapour, produces ... a burger.

 "Eh, voila!" says Monsieur Micronde. "She has performed, exactly as
 commanded."

>tell monsieur about mouse


 Monsieur Micronde shugs, gallically.

>examine burger


 (the burger)
 Not exactly mouthwatering. The beige bun barely conceals a leathery
 puck, wilting lettuce and watery tomato.

>ask monsieur for mousetrap


 The chef looks troubled. "I'm not sure about that," he says, "but let
 us essay what she can accomplish, the machine."

 The machine pops and produces a puff of brownish smoke. As the smoke
 clears, you see that it has produced another hamburger.

 Monsieur Micronde stares at it. "The machine," he says, "she has her
 little moments, her little tempests and tantrums. All will correct
 itself." He fiddles with the buttons.

 covered with dials, lights, screens, knobs, levers, handles, buttons,
 keypads and valves. A vast glass tank filled with greenish material
 sits on top of it. The side is blazoned "Gastroreactor: Reversing the
 Natural Order".

>examine tank


 The tank is full of a semi-liquid, greenish brown matter.

 "Remarkable, is it not," says Micronde. "Totally natural! Totally
 local! Absolutely vegetarian! All delivered from a local farm."

 "Is it ..." you ask.

 He beams. "But of course, my friend. Merde. Crap. Manure. All turned
 by the miracles of genetic engineering and nuclear physics into
 wholesome, delicious food."



 The Monsieur Micronde is unimpressed.

 You eat the piece of cheese. Not good.

 You have so far scored 0 out of a possible 60, in 32 turns.

>examine net


 The acme of good hygiene.

>remove net


 You take off the hairnet.

 "Please, I beg you!" says Monsieur Micronde. "I beg you! She is most
 delicate, the machine. She cannot abide dirt."

 The tank tells a different story, but you put the hairnet on,
 nonetheless.

>put burger in tank


 The tank can't contain things.

>hm. The net might help us catch a fish elsewhere.


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask chef for human flesh


 "Hmm," says the chef. "Let us see."

 The machine whirrs and produces copious quantities of grey smoke. As
 the smoke clears, you see that it has produced another hamburger.

 Monsieur Micronde stares at it. "It is insupportable!" he exclaims. "I
 am unable to comprehend why this has happened."

>examine dials


 The machine is infernally complicated.

>turn dials


 "Non, non, non, non, non!" Monsieur Micronde becomes animated. "You
 are not trained to operate her. Whatever you need, you have only to
 ask for it."

>put burgers in tank

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hotel Kitchen</span>
 Not quite your standard kitchen. No cabinet. No sink. No stove, or
 oven, or drawer. Instead you see an empty room, in the centre of which
 is a gleaming but largely useless machine.

 The hotel's chef, Monsieur Micronde, stands unhappily by the
 malfunctioning machine.

 You can also see a burger here.

 You take the burger.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pantry</span>
 Everything has its less dignified parts. There are toilets to be
 scrubbed, linens to be laundered -- and down in the basement pantry,
 there is room-service to be prepared and delivered.

 Here, all is "functional" (i.e., ugly): tiled walls and floor, a desk,
 a telephone, a broken refrigerator. The service elevator (which is
 broken) is south. The guest elevator (which you are going to have to
 use instead) is north. The kitchen is northeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Elevator</span>
 The floor is not perfectly clean, and the brass fixtures not perfectly
 polished, but at least it works. An advertisement for the hotel's spa
 is fixed to the wall, in an attempt to attract custom.

 The control panel is beside the door. Above it, an illuminated sign
 tells you that the elevator is currently on the basement floor.

>examine panel


 There is an array of buttons, marked B (for the basement), L (for the
 lobby), 2 to 56 for the hotel's various floors, and P for the
 penthouse. Beside the button for floor 2, an engraved sign reminds
 patrons that the hotel's famous ballroom is on that floor. No floor
 has been selected.

>read ad

 You discover nothing of interest in yourself.

 An athletic couple lie with their eyes closed and their faces covered
 in mud. Seraphic smiles spread across their features. "Feeling past

 You push the button marked "2" and it lights up.

 The elevator doors slide closed.

 The elevator rises, slows, and the doors open at floor 2.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ballroom</span>
 The ballroom is evidently being prepared for some sort of function.
 The grand chandelier (the largest in Torquay!) illuminates the sprung
 parquet floor. Dead centre in the middle of the dancefloor is a vast
 fishtank.

 Someone has dropped a piece of paper on the floor.

>examine paper


 MEMORANDUM TO HOTEL MANAGEMENT

 In preparation for the New Year Speed IF convention, various equipment
 is to be installed in the Ballroom. It consists of a fishtank, fish,
 and associated apparatus.

 Please ensure that it is properly installed and that no harm comes to
 the fish. I will bring the remainder of the work to which it relates
 as soon as I have finished it. Any problems, my room number is 4302.

 PS

>examine tank


 Someone has installed a large aquarium in the middle of the ballroom.
 It must be 10 feet square, and almost as tall as you are. You half
 expect to see a kraken, or at least a small shark, gliding with quiet
 menace. Instead a tiny goldfish is making slow circles round the tank.

>examine fish


 It swims knowingly, even insolently, about the tank.

>talk to goldfish


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>give burger to fish


 That seems to be part of the fishtank.

>ask goldfish about sushi


 Are you mad? It's a fish, not a conversation partner.

 You dip the hairnet quickly into the water, and briefly drag it like a

 then expires.

 A laptop computer is open on the bed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spa</span>
 The hotel's spa and aromatherapy suite. Soft light diffuses from
 hidden sources around the cornice, and gently pours over the pale grey
 walls and cream carpet. At a glass desk in the centre of the room, a
 severe looking young woman sits wearing a white coat: Dr Mell.

 Dr Mell sniffs; and you have no doubt that it is you she is sniffing.
 "Not terrible," she says, "but we can do better. We can always do
 better." From the many drawers of the desk she produces a number of
 tiny glass bottles, and sprays them toward you. A fresh smell of
 scrubbed skin and clean linen descends upon you.

>talk to mell


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask mell about seaweed


 She seems to have nothing to say.

 "Perhaps," says Dr Mell, "you would prefer something a little more
 exotic." Once again, her hands play over the drawers, producing a
 fistful of glass bottles which she sprays delicately about her. The
 air fills with the aromas of the souk: spices, coffee, sweet tobacco
 and hashish.

>ask mell about rice


 She seems to have nothing to say.

 "Arabia tells a thousand stories," Dr Mell mutters enigmatically. "But
 there are those who prefer the more bracing scents of the north." The
 bottles are duly produced and wielded, and you are transported to a
 northern forest in winter: resinous pine, pure air and woodsmoke.

>cut fish


 You can't see any such thing.

>wait


 Time passes.

 "We can travel in time," Dr Mell boasts, "and not just in place." The
 flurry of bottles and spraying leaves the room with a distinctly
 unsavoury smell: sweat, manure, boiling meat. "I give you," Dr Mell
 announces, "Paris, 1420."

>wait


 Time passes.

 "Let us return to normality," Dr Mell says. The bottles are duly
 wielded and sprayed, and you smell ... nothing unexpected. "Believe
 me," says Dr Mell, "reproducing precisely the scent of a mediocre
 hotel in twenty-first century Britain is at least as challenging as
 any of my other achievements."

>examine mell


 Dr Mell is an aristocrat among the hotel's staff. She wears a white
 coat, surgical scrubs and severe black glasses, which are perched on
 her highly-trained nose. She peers owlishly through their thick
 lenses.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 With black granite twinkling beneath your feet like a starry sky, the
 lobby makes a thoroughly ill-intentioned promise of grand luxury and
 impeccable service. The deserted reception desk tells a truer story.
 To the south, a chill drizzle plays on the plate glass doors. The
 elevator is north. A distinct odour reminds you that the sushi bar is
 west.

 In the middle of the lobby, the hotel's christmas tree stands
 disconsolately, weeping tinsel.

>examine tree


 Every great city has establishments justly famous for their Christmas
 decorations: Macy's, Fortnum's, the Galeries Lafayette. This is not
 one of them. The lopsided old fir is partially disguised with oddments
 of tinsel, baubles, and some lights which, predictably, seem not to be
 working -- a circumstance explained, perhaps, by the tangle of cables
 taped up at the base of the tree.

>examine cables


 Cables are absurdly intertwined like some crazy bird's nest, stuffed
 at the base of the tree. Yellow and black tape has been wrapped around
 it, marked "High Voltage, Do Not Touch." The fraying ends of the cable
 disappear into a junction box, which is turned off.

 It looks rather dangerous -- something to be attempted only as a last

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby (by the sushi bar)</span>
 Tucked into the corner of the lobby is the "Kamikaze Sushi Bar". It's
 not really a bar at all: just a counter with some stools at which
 guests can sit to eat sushi, brought to them from some hidden recess
 by the Bar's dedicated waiter.

 The General Manager is perched on a stool at the bar, picking at a
 plate of sushi.

>ask waiter for suhsi


 That can only be done to something animate.

>examine waiter


 Not, it seems, as dedicated as he might be, for he's nowhere to be
 seen.

>examine manager


 Mr O'Malley is harassed, choleric, overweight, puffy-faced, bug-eyed,
 incompetent, greedy, venal, lazy; short of stature and temper -- and
 currently stuffing his face with sushi.

 Across the far side of the lobby a woman with an eye-catching blue
 rinse struggles through the doors.

>examine plate


 (the plate of sushi)
 You had him down as a meat-and-potatoes man, but perhaps Mr O'Malley
 wants to lose some weight. It certainly looks like this sushi could
 have all manner of slimming effects.

>get plate

 "Hey! Beat it!" says Mr O'Malley graciously (as ever). "That's mine."

 You recognise the woman, of course. Mrs Slocombe: one of the hotel's
 most regular and affluent guests. Her beloved puss, as usual, surveys
 the scene from the top of a capacious handbag.

 with some annoyance.

 You can't see "her" (Dr Mell) at the moment.

>talk to mrs slocombe


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine desk


 It is axiomatic that the reception desk should always be staffed in
 any well managed establishment. So it is not surprising that this one
 isn't. Beside the desk, a brass-framed sign tells you what is
 happening in the hotel today.

 A coloured brochure lies on the desk.

 Across the lobby, the cat casts envious glances towards the sushi bar.

>go behind desk


 That's not a place you have been.

>read sign


 "The Burj Al-Fawalti Welcomes," it reads, and then a list of events
 today. Nothing much seems to be happening. Some group called the
 "Ultimate NY Speedifers" (a Manhattan-based motorcycle troupe?) are
 welcomed to the ballroom on floor 2. Otherwise, a blank.

 Across the lobby, Mrs Slocombe looks over to the sushi bar, glaring at
 Mr O'Malley.

>go west


 You can't go that way. You can go east to the rest of the lobby, or
 northeast to the elevator.

 Across the lobby, Mrs Slocombe's pussy looks at the Christmas tree,
 with a malevolent gleam in its eye.

>tell o'malley about slocombe


 "Bog off!" says the General Manager, "I'm having lunch."

 Across the lobby, Mrs Slocombe taps her foot in a frustrated manner.

>point to slocombe


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tell o'malley about pussy


 "Don't you speak English? Leave me in peace to eat."

 Across the lobby, the cat casts envious glances towards the sushi bar.

>ask slocombe about pu...er cat


 Mrs Slocombe is genuinely rather deaf, and selectively deafer still.
 She doesn't hear you (or pretends not to).

 Across the lobby, Mrs Slocombe taps her foot in a frustrated manner.

>examine slocombe


 Mrs Slocombe is a familiar face around here. A lady of a certain age,
 she has lived in a suite for as long as anyone can remember. Her white
 face, streaked with two stripes of rouge like warpaint, emerges from
 an eccentric collection of fur and jewels. Her cat, Pussykins, is, as
 usual, in attendance, glaring with feline malice from the top of her
 open handbag.

 Across the lobby, Mrs Slocombe carefully folds and unfolds her
 umbrella.

>inventory

   four burgers
   a dish of soy sauce

 Across the lobby, Mrs Slocombe stands by the reception desk.

>give burger to cat


 The cat could not look more bored by the burger.

 Across the lobby, the cat peers from the top of Mrs Slocombe's
 handbag.
