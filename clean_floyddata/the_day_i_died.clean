 <span class="floydstyle em">The end began a few months ago. My husband, Paul, had been abducted by</span>

 <span class="floydstyle header">The Day I died</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by Marius Müller
 Release 1 / Serial number 130106 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle i">Golf course</span> (in the golf cart)
 You are on top of one of the innumberable hills of the golf course.
 You can see the whole golf course around you, which is boring as hell.
 The only interesting thing is a shimmering and whispering portal, to
 the east.

>examine cart

 A new Alien Tech(tm) powered golf cart stand here. It looks remarkably
 like the three you crashed. Luckily, Mercury is so close to Earth in
 temperature and atmosphere that it needs no changes whatsoever.

>examine me

 You're Alex, lovable sociopath.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   Can of Spray Cheese

>examine can

 A can of spray cheese, really all the nutrition you need.

>go east

 You drive through the portal - "Whee!" -  Luckily nobody heard that.
 You emerge on the rim of a gargantuan crater, which houses a nice
 little building called "Dr. Frenesies secret cloning lab and prison"
 in big, friendly letters.  What do you know, there is even a space
 tank patrolling below. A person is standing in the manhole. You wave
 and only realize that it is a sharkman when you see the flash of
 cannon. The many microwave pizzas lately make it hard, but you jump
 from the cart in time, before the shot hits the front axle and the
 whole golf cart tumbles into the crater as a result!
 Thank god it was build by the same guys as the Halo warthog, so it
 lands right side up and unscathed, apart from the broxen axle.
 Another shot hits the empty plain behind you! Better make for the
 building to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Rim</span>
 The sun is huge and brilliant here, casting everything in that harsh
 and unforgiven light they have in changing rooms. There is
 unimplemented plain all around you, except for the portal to the west
 and the building to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ventilation Building</span>
 This small building seems to house the ventilation system for the
 prison below, judging by the ventilators on top and the annoying "woop
 woop" sound. A metal door leads inside.

 An ashtray stands besides the door. On the ashtray is a smoking
 cigarette and a lottery ticket.

 There is a trap here with a Mercury Rat caught in it.

>examine rat

 Aww, just look at it. It has pear-shaped body, with small, scrawnly
 leg and feet. Its thick, soft fur is mostly brown with a huge white
 spot on the tummy. It looks at you cautiously.

>take all from ashtray

 Taken.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a winner ticket
   Can of Spray Cheese

>examine ticket

 (the winner ticket)
 Oh, someone mistook the third tentacle face on this for a sun. It's
 actually a winning ticket fot the Saturn Trip lottery!

>pet rat

 Better free it first. I mean, if you want to. You can just leave it,
 you know. This is IF. You totally have a choice.

>inhale rat

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine trap

 A fiendish thing! It just has big red button labelled "DON'T PUSH!"
 Too bad mercury rats are literate and curious. Always a bad
 combination. The rat has one of its legs trapped under a metal bar.
 Occasionally it pulls on it, in vain, then looks at you with pleading,
 big dark eyes.

 Occasionally it pulls on it, in vain, then looks at you with pleading,
 big dark eyes.

>open bar

 You pry open the par effortlessly. The rat jumps out of the trap
 clumsily, due in part to his excess tummy and his injured leg. It sits
 by the side of the Building and eyes you warily.

>pet rat

 It scutters away from you. You need to earn its trust somehow.

>spray cheese

 You don't want to waste cheese.

 What do you want to feed the rat?

>spray rat

 You spray the rat in the face with the cheese. It makes quite the
 surprise faced before it licks all the cheese of its face, then sits
 (oh, it's a man rat) and goes about cleaning the remainder of its
 whiskers. The rat rubs his tiny hand across his face one last time and
 looks at you lovingly. Looks like you made a friend.
 You feel like giving it a name.

>cheese

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>name rat marius

 The rat is now known as marius.(If you don't like it anymore, just
 name it "nothing)".

 his eyes.

 Marius arrives from the north.

 A sharkmen janitor comes through the door and picks up the cigarette,
 totally oblivious to you, even though you're mentioned in his room
 description. He takes up the ticket and sighs. "I would've loved to go
 to Saturn, Steve went  and he- Holy Fin, what is this?" He takes out a
 pair of glasses and peers at the ticket. "I won! Screw this job." He
 takes right off, to the northnortheast, where there is a huge barrack
 in the distance. Behind him, the door begins to close slowly.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lab</span>
 This lab has been cleaned up impressively for the weekend.

 A cloning machine sits in a corner.

>examine cloning machine

 It has two vats, one enterable, and an input slot. Looks like without
 a Data iPod in it, the machine just clones what is in it. It has a
 big, red lever labelled "CLONE" and not much else. Yep, an Apple
 product.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By the guard's room</span>
 Through some bars on the left hand side of the hallway, you can see a
 sharkmen guard at a table. He sits with his back to you and seems to
 be trying to open his cellphone to replace the battery. Good, that
 should take a while.
 On the wall, just outside of your reach through the bars, is a blue
 button.

>go south

 You sneak down the hallway to the next cell. And there Paul sits,
 sullenly on a cot, eyes down, shoulders slumped. You lean agsainst the
 frame nonchalantly. "Hey handsome"
 Paul's eyes light up and he jumps to his feet and grabs the bars. "I
 knew you'd come to rescue us!"
 "Us? I was thinking of just rescuing you!"
 Paul puts his hands on his hips and furrows his brow. "Is that so? How
 would you feel if someone left you in prison?" You avert his gaze and
 try to dig in the prison floor with your boot. "Pretty terrible." you
 murmur. He pats you through the bars. "Well done. Now get us out. Man,
 am I happy to see you." He smiles. You turn away. "Me too." Dang, you
 must have some dust in your eye.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Paul's Cell</span>
 Paul sits here gloomily, awaiting his rescue.

>rescue paul

 His beard has become a bit more scraggly since you last saw him, far

 pyjamas. But he's alive.

 "So men really are from Mars and women ..."
 "No dear, gender is artificial construct that's not helping anyone."
 "Can she understand us?"
 "I learnt a few pheases, but we don't have time for chit-chat. Maybe
 latter."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Venusian's cell</span>

>spray button

 You spray the button with cheese. The rat squeezes his plump belly
 through the bars and scuttles up the wall. He looks at you, right
 below the button, then gives you a claw-up as he pushes it.

 All hell breaks loose. Screeching alarm sirens sound throughout the
 prison. The guard jumps to his feet and pulls a huge Kerkerkruip rifle
 from the table. "Die, person who reminds me of my lost humanity quite
 painfully!" The bite in his ankle from Marius, who has come to your
 aid , seems even more painful. You grab the gun and take three shots
 to drop him, what with his hopping on one foot at all.
 Paul runs from his cell and into your arms. You hold him for a
 blissful second, then nod at the Venusian woman behind him. Paul looks
 at the dead guard. "I told you not to kill indiscriminately anymore,
 huzzie." You look to the ground, mumbling "Sorry". "Now, let's make
 for the gate. They'll send more guards through the Ventilation
 Building any second."
 The three of you run for the reception area. You suddenly don't feel
 safe at all. No, not safe at all. You hope you can save the four of
 you.

 The sharkmen beginning to brandish rifles, while they're running, but

 You shoot one of the sharkmen, but that doesn't even change their

 All hell breaks loose. Screeching alarm sirens sound throughout the
 prison. The guard jumps to his feet and pulls a huge Kerkerkruip rifle
 from the table. "Die, person who reminds me of my lost humanity quite
 painfully!" The bite in his ankle from Marius, who has come to your
 aid , seems even more painful. You grab the gun and take three shots
 to drop him, what with his hopping on one foot at all.

 means.

 You are in the region of the Crater indicated by the title.
 (Atmospheric description not included)

 A huge  metal gate leads inside, to the north.

 In the golf cart you can see Marius.

 Paul and the Venusian sit on the backseat, Paul with Marius on his
 lap.

 The tank pursues you!

>go north

 The cart won't fit. It's not a miniature golf cart, ha ha ha.

 Paul and the Venusian sit on the backseat, Paul with Marius on his
 lap.

 The turret fires - lousily. It hits the crater wall behind you.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle i">Upper Eastern Wall</span> (in the golf cart)
 This is the place the Venusian indicated earlier! There is a crumbling
 crack in the wall, too.

 In the golf cart you can see Marius.

 Paul and the Venusian sit on the backseat, Paul with Marius on his
 lap.

 The tank pursues you!

>examine crack

 Behind it lies your path to freedom.

 The turret fires - lousily. It hits the crumbling wall behind you,
 which reveals a tunnel.
 "Hooray!" says Paul, and even Marius squeals happily. "Now we only
 need to get rid of the tank and escape a planet 138 million miles from
 Earth."
 "And that's only when they furthest apart!" you add, helpfully.

 Paul and the Venusian sit on the backseat, Paul with Marius on his
 lap.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle i">Tunnel</span> (in the golf cart)
 You are in the ancient resistence tunnel. Spiderwebs indicate it
 hasn't been used in a while, or that the resistance are all
 arachnophobic. Or not very clean. Maybe spider webs don't indicate
 that much. The way south leads back to the crater, while there seems
 to be some sort of bridge to the north.

 In the golf cart you can see Marius.

 Paul and the Venusian sit on the backseat, Paul with Marius on his
 lap.

>go north

 The Venusian graps Paul's arm and whispers to him urgently, while you
 take point and step onto the bridge. It's small, and amateurishly
 carved out of the stone. To either side, the cave drops down into
 lightless depths. Phosphopho..phospher....phospos...glowing stones in
 the walls provide a dim light.
 "Seems safe eno..."
 Then something steps out of the shadows at the other end of the
 bridge, something huge and horrible. The kind of creature that would
 have Lovecraft scramble for his dictionary.  Slavering fangs,
 razor-sharp claws and horrible gurgling noises ... You turn around to
 warn the others, but then the grue is already upon you, and swipes you
 off the bridge with her razor-sharp claws. With a bloodied and mangled
 face, you hurtle screaming into the dark.

 The turret fires - lousily. It hits the overhang behind you. "Oh sh-"
 says Paul before the whole cart is engulfed in a dust cloud. You steer
 this way and that, just hoping you don't hit any walls and emerge to
 the north of the cloud. Marius covers his nose and sneezes. The
 Venusian clears dust from her face with a dignified wipe of her hand.
 Unfortunaley, the overhang has missed the tank. The dust covering the
 gunner makes him look even more like a white shark.

 With a screeching handbrake turn, you line up the cart, the ramp and
 the tank. "What are you doing?" shouts Paul and grabs the seat in
 front of him. "I'm going Mario on these suckers!"
 You hit the pedal, and the golf cart accelerates, up the makeshift
 ramp.
 For a second, it's all frozen, the cart in the air, the sharkman
 gaping up open mouthed- then he screams "Three days from retirement!"
 before the cart crashes down on him. And catches fire. Quickly.
  "To the tunnel!" you shout and grab Paul's hand.
 As the four of you reach the tunnel, tank and cart explode behind you.
 "The owner of that golf club must really, really hate you by now"
 says Paul, giggling.
 You hold him for a moment and ruffle his hair.
 The Venusian says something, and Paul frowns, not comprehending. "She
 asked if we have source of darkness."
 "Must be poetic Venusian language for something. We'll worry about it
 later."You grab Paul's hand and together you go north, into the
 tunnel. Marius hopples behind you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tunnel</span>
 You are in the ancient resistence tunnel. Spiderwebs indicate it
 hasn't been used in a while, or that the resistance are all

>search spiderwebs

 You find nothing of interest.

>go north

 The Venusian graps Paul's arm and whispers to him urgently, while you
 take point and step onto the bridge. It's small, and amateurishly
 carved out of the stone. To either side, the cave drops down into
 lightless depths. Phosphopho..phospher....phospos...glowing stones in
 the walls provide a dim light.
 "Seems safe eno..."
 Then something steps out of the shadows at the other end of the
 bridge, something huge and horrible. The kind of creature that would
 have Lovecraft scramble for his dictionary.  Slavering fangs,
 razor-sharp claws and horrible gurgling noises ... You turn around to
 warn the others, but then the grue is already upon you, and swipes you

 ("Hey, complains the Venusian, "he's dead, not deaf.")
 The light grue seems far too surprised to be attacked by someone wimpy
 - people like you usually don't think violence is an answer - and with
 the best of your rugby knowledge from that British All Boy's school,
 you tackle the light grue. It flails wildly and slips, but graps the
 edge of the bridge before it can fall. The Venusian steps close.
 The grue chuckles in Mercurian with a thick subterreanean accent. "You
 have no idea of the horrors that await you, warrioress from the stars.
 These tunnels have long been recaptured by things worse than light
 grues. You will die in these depths, like your friend, alone and
 forgotten. What do you say to that?"
 The Venusian kicks her in the face, and the grue falls. "I say you
 passed your last Bechdel test, you bit-" You pull on her arm. "No time
 to offend more sensitive Clubfloyd player" you say. " We need to, I
 guess we have to..." You sit down. "I guess I should..." The Venusian
 puts a hand on your shoulder. "He'd want you to go on."

 Pauls Parents are rather fond of this small pool south of their house.
 It's surrounded by some deck-chairs. The eastern and western garden
 walls are overgrown with undergrowth, so as to hide the family members
 going for a seamelss tan. This wasn't necessary for the southern wall,
 wich is quite high, because it borders on a Golf course (Pauls told
 you they find the occasional golf ball in the pool nonetheless.)
