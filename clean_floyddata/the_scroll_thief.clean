 Every Enchanter—every mortal with the power to change the
 world—the
 very fabric of reality—the very <span class="floydstyle em">nature of the universe</span> with

 It was surprisingly easy to get in here—you saw nobody on your way
 over, and the outer doors recognized your student ring. The hardest
 part was not talking yourself out of it. So many things could go
 wrong. What if there is an alarm? What if someone is still in the

 No. You have come this far. Only the inner door to the library is
 keeping you away from the magic you seek. You aren't going to turn

 No. You have come this far. Only the inner door to the library is
 keeping you away from the magic you seek. You aren't going to turn
 back now.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   your spell book
   the Frobozz Colored Parchment Pack
   a quill pen
   a magical compass
   your identification ring (being worn)
   your journal
   a badly-written scroll

>examine journal

 This is the journal in which you have kept meticulous notes and
 personal recollections through your years at the University. With
 amazing foresight you prepared a helpful index page at the back, which
 you updated every time you added a significant entry.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[You might find the command LOOK UP (X) IN JOURNAL useful</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">here.]</span>
>look up library in journal

 You flip through the pages, but see nothing important under "library".
 You might want to look at the index.

>look at index

 It's a good thing you wrote this, because your page numbering system
 makes little sense even to yourself now.

 Index:
     red
     orange
     yellow
     green
     blue
     indigo
     violet

 There are also various class notes interspersed between these.


>examine ring

 A thin band of some silvery metal, with a flat copper disk in place of
 a stone. It's keyed to the enchanted doors on campus, but you doubt it
 will do you any good here. It would also allow you to check out books
 here if the library were open.

>look up red

 red: "First entry. Thaumaturgy classes begin tomorrow! Not much else
 to say."

>look up orange

 orange: "The tedium of Magic Theory 101 is at an end! I think I can
 summarize everything we learned in that class in one paragraph: There
 are three parts to any spell: the <span class="floydstyle i">Incantation</span> and the
 <span class="floydstyle i">Unusual Effect</span> are obvious, but there is also the
 <span class="floydstyle i">Presence</span> which fuels the magic. The <span class="floydstyle i">Presence</span> (which must
 always be pronounced dramatically for some reason) is imbued into the
 vellum of a scroll, which is why the scroll is consumed as the spell
 is cast, and also why we can't just copy powerful spells onto every
 sheet of parchment we see. How did that explanation merit a full
 semester of lectures?!"

>look up green

 green: "This lecture seems to be worth a note. When you see an
 Enchanter going around with a spell book, they aren't actually just
 storing their spell scrolls in a clever way: the pages of a spell book
 are made with an enormous amount of <span class="floydstyle i">Presence</span>, such that the
 spells can actually be cast repeatedly without destroying the book!
 The downside is that casting a spell from a spell book is a lengthier
 process. The Enchanter first needs to go through a <span class="floydstyle i">Primary</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">Incantation</span>, or "memorization", which calls the <span class="floydstyle i">Presence</span>
 from the book and stores the almost-completed spell in the caster's
 mind. The spell can then be cast later with the <span class="floydstyle i">Secondary</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">Incantation</span>, often a single word, which finishes the
 <span class="floydstyle i">Incantation</span> and causes the <span class="floydstyle i">Unusual Effect</span>. Apparently
 this was discovered by a scrollwriter named Berzio a long time ago,
 who also invented the gnusto spell to transfer a scroll into a spell
 book."

>look up blue

 blue: "Today I cast my first spell! Magic Theory 241 is the best class
 I've taken so far. After weeks of practicing the pronunciation of the
 ancient words, we were each given a frotz scroll and allowed to cast
 it under close supervision. I got the proper effect on my first try at
 casting it, and this journal is still glowing as I write this! My
 faith in the Thaumaturgy program has been restored."

>look up indigo

 indigo: "So close...and yet so far. I know I can do magic! I've used
 every practice scroll perfectly! And <span class="floydstyle em">still</span> they won't trust
 us with the gnusto spell! Without gnusto I will never be able to use
 magic outside the carefully regulated classroom environment, and even
 if I managed to purloin a scroll it would only be one casting of frotz
 or gloth. GAH!"

>look up violet

 violet: "This is it. G.U.E. Tech is closing. [The text degenerates
 into illegible scribblings, and you can't remember what else you
 intended to write on this page.]"

>examine scroll

 The scroll reads "rezrov: open even locked or enchanted objects".

 It was copied for you by one of the higher-ranking apprentices, who
 charged you a fortune and doesn't seem to have been very good at
 calligraphy. But if it can open the doors for you, it will have been
 worth it.

>examine compass

 It's a large gold compass about the size of a pocketwatch, with a
 spell on the needle to make it always stay level. Most mages carry
 compasses because of how easy it is to get disoriented in magic-rich
 areas.

>examine quill

 You borrowed this from one of your professors, allegedly to practice
 copying your "gloth" scroll. It's large and deep blue, with a tiny
 enchanted diamond set in the tip.

>examine diamond

 Even in low light it sparkles brightly. The enchantment on it allows
 the pen to write on normal paper without ink, and also—more
 importantly—to transfer spells from scroll to scroll.

>examine pack

 This was the largest package of blank parchment you could buy without
 looking suspicious. The label on the shiny foil wrapping says it
 contains four sheets of quality magic-imbued vellum in various colors.

>examine colors

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine vellum

 This was the largest package of blank parchment you could buy without
 looking suspicious. The label on the shiny foil wrapping says it
 contains four sheets of quality magic-imbued vellum in various colors.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[You might find the command OPEN THE PACK useful here.]</span>
>touch vellum

 You feel nothing unexpected.

>open the pack

 You tear open the foil pack, revealing four blotchy scraps of dull
 parchment.

>dance

 You jump around a bit, but it's rather uncomfortable without the
 proper shoes.

>xyzzy

 That's the activation word for one of the first teleportation spells
 ever developed. If you recall correctly from History of Magic, it was
 incredibly inefficient—it found all the matter within a 5-foot
 sphere
 around one hardcoded point and all the matter within the same volume
 around another and swapped their positions.

 Modern teleportation spells are much better...somehow. You can't
 really remember the details. But there was some sort of improvement.
 It's probably in your notes.

>plugh

 You mangle the pronunciation and nothing happens. Those stupid foreign
 Enchanters from the Dutchy never think to give their spells
 pronouncable names. Anyway, that was another of the early unreliable
 teleportation spells.

>plover

 Isn't that a kind of bird?

>look up xyzzy

 xyzzy: "You look back through your notes and find the lecture on
 teleportation spells. Ah, here it is...

 Someone once stood four and a half feet away from the center of the
 <span class="floydstyle em">xyzzy</span> spell, so only part of her arrived at the destination.
 This is why modern teleportation spells are legally required to have
 additional checks against "portal-slicing"."


 I didn't understand that sentence.


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine door

 The door to the library itself is closed and barred, with thick metal
 chains across it. There doesn't even seem to be a keyhole. Clearly the
 Guild is taking no chances with security.

>examine chains

 You can't see any such thing.

>read scroll

 (the badly-written scroll)
 The scroll reads "rezrov: open even locked or enchanted objects".

 It was copied for you by one of the higher-ranking apprentices, who
 charged you a fortune and doesn't seem to have been very good at
 calligraphy. But if it can open the doors for you, it will have been
 worth it.

>cast rezrov

 That enchantment must be cast at something.

>cast rezrov at door

 As you cast the spell, the badly-written scroll vanishes.

 You stutter slightly in the pronunciation—this is the most
 complicated
 spell you have yet cast! But the scroll was consumed, so the
 <span class="floydstyle i">Presence</span> has had its effect. There is a slight shudder, and you
 can see the chains on the door loosen infinitessimally.

 Suddenly, the bar flies back with a loud THUMP and the lock clicks
 open. The door swings wide with an enormous CLANG.

 Well, so much for stealth. But you can't panic yet. Not yet. The
 Guild might assume it was a false alarm. Just get in, get the spells,
 get out.

 spell.]

 You've visited the library many times, and this room has never failed
 to impress you. Sunlight shone in through the circular window in the
 great domed ceiling, reflecting off the mosaic floor and filling the

 rules for conducting votes at meetings, guidelines for passing dishes
 at Guild banquets, and penalties for revealing the Guild's secret
 handshake.

>examine mosaic

 The mosaic in the library antechamber is unlike any other you've ever
 seen. The tiles range in size from almost a meter across to finer than
 grains of sand, and seem to pull in and intensify the moonlight.
 Though the stones around your feet remain in one place, the rest of
 the floor is constantly shifting and swirling to create new messages

 As your eyes adjust, you see that you are in a simple panelled room,
 dominated by an orange metal box leaning against one wall. The words
 FROBOZZ MAGIC SCROLL DISPENSER are stencilled across one side in
 white, and the other is covered with a large sign explaining the
 proper usage.

 A calendar on one wall is acting as a strange source of illumination.

 You've visited the library many times, and this room has never failed
 to impress you. Sunlight shone in through the circular window in the
 great domed ceiling, reflecting off the mosaic floor and filling the
 area with patterns of red and gold. The din of innumerable Enchanters
 and students made it feel alive.

 Now, however, it is dark and silent. A few shafts of moonlight give
 everything an ethereal silvery glow.

 Standing in the middle of the floor is a glass display case, showing
 off an illuminated scroll.

 The tiles in the mosaic create a new message: "Scrying crystals are

>cast frotz on ring

 As you cast the spell, the newly-printed scroll vanishes.

 There is an almost blinding flash of light as your identification ring
 begins to glow! It slowly fades to a less painful level, but your
 identification ring is now quite usable as a light source.

 The mosaic shifts again: "The Main Stacks are to the west.
 "
 You suddenly hear a loud CLICK from behind you. A magically recorded
 voice sounds from somewhere above you:

 "Hello, footpad! Your after-hours spellcasting within the Library has
 activated one of the triggers of a Frobozz Magic Alarm Company
 security system. Please be aware that unless you say the correct
 passphrase within the next five minutes, the preset alarms will be
 activated. In the meantime, additional traps and triggers have been
 activated for your safety. Have a nice day!"

 ...okay, this is getting worse. But you won't panic. You won't panic.
 You still have five minutes before the alarms activate.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spell Research Room</span>
 This is the area where advanced students can work out variations on
 old spells or attempt (with close supervision) to create simple
 enchantments from scratch.

 Lying on the workbench is a scribbled spell scroll, probably a
 student's forgotten experiment.

 A long workbench lines one of the walls. Judging from the amount of
 strange machinery around it, the alarm recording wasn't lying about
 the traps—magic-users have a tendency to make things overly
 complicated in case of unlikely eventualities. It might not be a good
 idea to touch anything until the trap can be deactivated.

 The recorded voice speaks again: "Four minutes and thirty seconds."


>take scroll

 As you reach out, your weight falls on the bench for a moment. With a
 grinding of gears, the bench sinks slightly into the floor. It seems
 that the additional weight has activated a trap, and before you can
 dodge backwards a cleesh spell fires at you from a mechanism in the

 the Frobozz Magic Reshelving Device. You placed your book on the

 and slid over a series of differently-shaped slots until it fell
 through the right one.

 A purple tome lies on the input tray, ready for reshelving.

 "Three minutes."

 You've visited the library many times, and this room has never failed
 to impress you. Sunlight shone in through the circular window in the
 great domed ceiling, reflecting off the mosaic floor and filling the
 area with patterns of red and gold. The din of innumerable Enchanters
 and students made it feel alive.

 Now, however, it is dark and silent. A few shafts of moonlight give
 everything an ethereal silvery glow.

 The Adventurer is standing here, awaiting a command.

 Standing in the middle of the floor is a glass display case, showing
 off an illuminated scroll.

 The tiles in the mosaic create a new message: "Storage areas lie to
 the northeast and southeast.

 The Adventurer goes north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spell Research Room</span>
 This is the area where advanced students can work out variations on
 old spells or attempt (with close supervision) to create simple
 enchantments from scratch.

 The Adventurer is standing here, awaiting a command.

 A long workbench lines one of the walls. Judging from the amount of
 strange machinery around it, the alarm recording wasn't lying about
 the traps—magic-users have a tendency to make things overly
 complicated in case of unlikely eventualities. It might not be a good
 idea to touch anything until the trap can be deactivated.

>adventurer, lean on table

 The Adventurer reaches toward the workbench, and her hand touches the
 surface for a moment. With a grinding of gears, the bench sinks
 slightly into the floor. The Adventurer yells in surprise—it seems
 that the additional weight has activated a trap, and before she can do
 anything else spells fire from all directions. The Adventurer vanishes
 in a cloud of green smoke, and when it clears the only sign of her is
 a small newt scuttling away through the door.

 There is a slight scraping sound, but the trap hasn't been reset and
 nothing happens.

 The Adventurer doesn't move. Perhaps there was a problem with your
 command.

 and slid over a series of differently-shaped slots until it fell
 through the right one.

 This is a nice spell book, bound in blue cloth with silver stitching

     VEZZA: view the future

 Shorter than the other rope, and frayed at one end, but still capable

 The shiny white rope is tied to nothing.

 Somehow it is unstained, even after being in storage for who knows how
 long.

 anything goes wrong in the Clean Room.

 The Adventurer points the small red sphere at the heavy iron doors.

>adventurer, open doors

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clean Room</span>
 This is the most dangerous part of the Spell Research Area, located
 below the rest of the Library. It was painstakingly constructed so
 that in case of trouble it can be hermetically sealed from either
 side, and any explosion or serious damage here will collapse the
 tunnel and keep the rest of the building safe. If there were any
 powerful magic in the Library, it would be here.

 A pair of heavy iron doors seal the Clean Room off from the staircase.

 A narrow chimney leads upwards, allowing some ventilation.

 Clamped to one wall is a perfectly ordinary spell scroll.

 Nestled among the equipment is a shiny golden box.

 The Adventurer, unable to hear your commands, attempts to come back
 into range.

 vent.]

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spell Research Room</span>
 This is the area where advanced students can work out variations on
 old spells or attempt (with close supervision) to create simple
 enchantments from scratch.

 A long workbench lines one of the walls. Judging from the amount of
 strange machinery around it, the alarm recording wasn't lying about
 the traps—magic-users have a tendency to make things overly
 complicated in case of unlikely eventualities. It might not be a good
 idea to touch anything until the trap can be deactivated.

 great domed ceiling, reflecting off the mosaic floor and filling the
 area with patterns of red and gold. The din of innumerable Enchanters
 and students made it feel alive.

 Now, however, it is dark and silent. A few shafts of moonlight give
 everything an ethereal silvery glow.

 Standing in the middle of the floor is a glass display case, showing
 off an illuminated scroll.

 The tiles in the mosaic create a new message: "The Main Stacks are to
 the west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Disused Closet</span>
 Dust, cobwebs, and not much else. Markings on the floor show that this

 empty.

 A strange light shines from an inconspicuous metal grating near the
 floor.

>examine grating

 A small square of grating, which covers the opening of some sort of
 air duct. A faint light shines through it.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Bottom of the Staircase</span> (carried by the Adventurer)
 This is the bottom of the corroded iron staircase, which winds upwards
 through the rock. A roughly-hewn passage leads to the southeast.

 A pair of heavy iron doors seal the Clean Room off from the staircase.

 Also carried by the Adventurer are a carbide lantern (providing

 There are more strange noises, and two more Enchanters appear behind

 from the Library." You do your best to look shocked at the very idea,
 but the Enchanters don't seem convinced.

 She stops suddenly and her face goes white. Frobar runs over.
 "Helistar, what is—wait—that's not possible—"

 They look at you in shock. "How can he have <span class="floydstyle em">yonk</span> in his spell
 book? It's too powerful for <span class="floydstyle em">gnusto</span> to copy..."

 Helistar sets her own spell book down. "Perhaps it's a simpler spell
 that one of the Spellwriting students misnamed. Let's see." She
 concentrates on your book for a minute, then waves her hand. There is
 a faint hum, then a flash of brilliant light that leaves all of you
 momentarily blinded. "No...that <span class="floydstyle em">frotz</span> responded just as it

 This is the area where advanced students can work out variations on
 old spells or attempt (with close supervision) to create simple
 enchantments from scratch.

 A long workbench lines one of the walls. Judging from the amount of
 strange machinery around it, the alarm recording wasn't lying about
 the traps—magic-users have a tendency to make things overly
 complicated in case of unlikely eventualities. It might not be a good
 idea to touch anything until the trap can be deactivated.

 Almost there—you can see the door you rezroved to get in—and then
 a
 sharp <span class="floydstyle em">crack</span> near the display case diverts your attention. A
 short man wearing the robes of a Senior Enchanter is sprinting towards
 you, casting a spell from a parchment scroll. He shouts the word
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Foblub!"</span> and your feet seem to glue themselves to the floor.

 There are more strange noises, and two more Enchanters appear behind
 him. Wonderful. Escape was within your grasp, your spell book filled
 with powerful magic, and you failed.

 "Are you the one who set off the alarm?" the short Enchanter asks
 roughly.

 out and grabs the golden box. That shouldn't have been able to happen.

 trying to make sense of something.

 The Adventurer shakes her head in confusion.

>examine sphere

 (the small red sphere)
 Instead of a reflection, the small red sphere seems to show a
 different view, as if it were a window to another world...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clean Room</span>
 This is the most dangerous part of the Spell Research Area, located
 below the rest of the Library. It was painstakingly constructed so
 that in case of trouble it can be hermetically sealed from either
 side, and any explosion or serious damage here will collapse the
 tunnel and keep the rest of the building safe. If there were any
 powerful magic in the Library, it would be here.

 Dislodged by the motion of the golden box, a strange dark scroll
 covered in white writing lies in the middle of the floor.

 .

 A pair of heavy iron doors seal the Clean Room off from the staircase.

 A narrow chimney leads upwards, allowing some ventilation.

 Clamped to one wall is a perfectly ordinary spell scroll.

 ...you step back from the mirror, and take a moment to regain your
 bearings.

 The Adventurer looks at you again, and doesn't seem to like what she
 sees.

>examine ordinary

 The scroll reads "yonk: augment the power of spells". The spell seems
 very long and extremely complicated.

 The Adventurer glances at you with growing suspicion.

 The scroll reads "lleps: reverse the effect of a spell".

 The Adventurer blinks rapidly, seeming to see you for the first time.

 you still have no way to get the other scroll out of the Clean Room.

 It was surprisingly easy to get in here—you saw nobody on your way
 over, and the outer doors recognized your student ring. The hardest
 part was not talking yourself out of it. So many things could go
 wrong. What if there is an alarm? What if someone is still in the
 Library? What if someone comes in and finds you?

 No. You have come this far. Only the inner door to the library is
 keeping you away from the magic you seek. You aren't going to turn

 Impressing them certainly can't hurt your situation.

 "I found a <span class="floydstyle em">yonk</span> scroll in the Clean Room," you explain, "and
 made a copy of it."

 "Sensible of you," Frobar remarks, "those scrolls are hard to come
 by." He seems to have forgotten that you stole it.

 "But I wanted the spell in my spell book, so I could cast it over and
 over," you stammer. How are you going to explain your being in the
 Clean Room at all? But they don't seem to have noticed. "And I
 thought, you know, if I can't gnusto it because the gnusto spell isn't
 powerful enough, well then, what if I augmented its power?"

 "That doesn't make sense." Helistar interrupts. "You can't use
 metamagic on gnusto, it's fixed in your memory before your third year
 of study...oh. Of course. You would probably be the first person to
 encounter a metamagic scroll before learning your first spell by
 heart."

 ** End of Act I

 This is officially the end of the IntroComp version of the game. Some
 parts of the second act are implemented (e.g. getting into the Storage
 Room, opening the aquarium, getting the <span class="floydstyle em">kulcad</span> spell) if you
 want to continue, but they have not been rigorously tested and will
 certainly have bugs.

 At this point Frobar and Helistar debate for a while, but decide to
 trust you for the moment—the <span class="floydstyle em">yonk</span> spell in your spell book
 is
 of more immediate importance than your attempted burglary. They
 explain how magic is starting to fail, and how the Guildmaster has
 disappeared (along with every Enchanter who attended the meeting in
 Borphee). Frobar gives you a copy of the <span class="floydstyle em">blorple</span> spell, which
 had suddenly appeared in various spell books that night. Your task is
 now the same as it was in <span class="floydstyle em">Spellbreaker</span>: figure out what's
 happening, and if there is any way to stop it.

 Thank you for playing!

 Magic Alarm Company security system!"

 Damn. You had started to think you were home free. You might still
 have time to escape, though...

 ** [Your score has gone up by five points for almost getting away with
 burglary.]

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spell Research Room</span>
 This is the area where advanced students can work out variations on
 old spells or attempt (with close supervision) to create simple
 enchantments from scratch.

 A long workbench lines one of the walls. Judging from the amount of
 strange machinery around it, the alarm recording wasn't lying about
 the traps—magic-users have a tendency to make things overly
 complicated in case of unlikely eventualities. It might not be a good
 idea to touch anything until the trap can be deactivated.

>go south

 Almost there—you can see the door you rezroved to get in—and then
 a
 sharp <span class="floydstyle em">crack</span> near the display case diverts your attention. A
 short man wearing the robes of a Senior Enchanter is sprinting towards
 you, casting a spell from a parchment scroll. He shouts the word
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Foblub!"</span> and your feet seem to glue themselves to the floor.

 There are more strange noises, and two more Enchanters appear behind
 him. Wonderful. Escape was within your grasp, your spell book filled
 with powerful magic, and you failed.

 "Are you the one who set off the alarm?" the short Enchanter asks
 roughly.
>no
 roughly.


 "If you didn't break in, what are you doing here?"
 At this, one of the others notices your spell book. "Look, Frobar. He
 has a student spell book. I bet he was trying to steal some spells
 from the Library." You do your best to look shocked at the very idea,
 but the Enchanters don't seem convinced.

 The one who took your spell book starts to flip through it. "Yes, I
 knew it. <span class="floydstyle em">Rezrov</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">gnusto</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">frotz</span>—a
 second-year student wouldn't have any of these in a spell book ye—"
 She stops suddenly and her face goes white. Frobar runs over.
 "Helistar, what is—wait—that's not possible—"

 They look at you in shock. "How can he have <span class="floydstyle em">yonk</span> in his spell
 book? It's too powerful for <span class="floydstyle em">gnusto</span> to copy..."

 Helistar sets her own spell book down. "Perhaps it's a simpler spell
 that one of the Spellwriting students misnamed. Let's see." She
 concentrates on your book for a minute, then waves her hand. There is
 a faint hum, then a flash of brilliant light that leaves all of you
 momentarily blinded. "No...that <span class="floydstyle em">frotz</span> responded just as it
 should..."

 Frobar turns to you. "Will you explain how you ended up with a
 <span class="floydstyle em">yonk</span> spell inscribed in a student spell book?"

 The tiles in the mosaic create a new message: "This mosaic was
 enchanted by H. Ondricek and M. T. Winter of the Class of 925.
 "
 You have nothing specific in mind to discuss with Frobar just now.

>no

 "Sorry, that's my secret."

 Helistar glares at you angrily...

 ** End of Act I

 This is officially the end of the IntroComp version of the game. Some
 parts of the second act are implemented (e.g. getting into the Storage
 Room, opening the aquarium, getting the <span class="floydstyle em">kulcad</span> spell) if you
 want to continue, but they have not been rigorously tested and will
 certainly have bugs.

 At this point Frobar and Helistar debate for a while, but decide to
 trust you for the moment—the <span class="floydstyle em">yonk</span> spell in your spell book
 is
 of more immediate importance than your attempted burglary. They
 explain how magic is starting to fail, and how the Guildmaster has
 disappeared (along with every Enchanter who attended the meeting in
 Borphee). Frobar gives you a copy of the <span class="floydstyle em">blorple</span> spell, which
 had suddenly appeared in various spell books that night. Your task is
 now the same as it was in <span class="floydstyle em">Spellbreaker</span>: figure out what's
 happening, and if there is any way to stop it.

 Thank you for playing!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library Antechamber</span>
 You've visited the library many times, and this room has never failed
 to impress you. Sunlight shone in through the circular window in the
 great domed ceiling, reflecting off the mosaic floor and filling the
 area with patterns of red and gold. The din of innumerable Enchanters
 and students made it feel alive.

 Now, however, it is dark and silent. A few shafts of moonlight give
 everything an ethereal silvery glow.

 Standing in the middle of the floor is a glass display case, showing
 off an illuminated scroll.

 You can also see Helistar and Frobar here.

 The mosaic shifts again: "Welcome, Olly!
