                                Day One












 It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five
 days since I closed the gate.

 Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot
 appeared: when the first bloody cough ensued from the mouth of an
 urchin. To have allowed the sick sanctuary at Saint Cuthbert's would
 only have damned us as well.

 But we were already damned.

 The plague came. And now we suffer.

 Vespers
 (First time players should type ABOUT)
 Release 1 / Serial number 051128 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11

 Six crisp chimes mark Vespers. Your heart flutters for a moment, and
 you place your head in your hands.

 Your Bedroom
 Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems
 smaller of late. With so many of your brothers gone, there has been
 little for you to do but wait. Wait for the spots to appear in this
 tiny, dark room.

 A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the
 west.

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
 from this morning.

>examine me
 You're not the man you were a few days ago. Your skin hangs as sallow
 drapes around your jaw: your hands are emaciated. Your frock billows
 about you; it is difficult to find any flesh within. The only solace
 you find in looking at yourself is that, so far, no signs of the
 plague are within you.

>examine desk
 It was once a fine desk, but now it sags in the middle and smells
 faintly of rotting wood. Still, it serves well enough when you need to
 write: a need you haven't had much of lately.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your tinderbox
   your candle (lit)
   your frock (being worn)

>burn desk
 It does not light. The dampness spoils everything here.

>examine tinderbox
 A small box containing some flint, steel, and tinder. You always keep
 it close should your candle be snuffed by the wind.

 Thunder rumbles overhead, shaking the monastery to its foundations.

>examine candle
 Pig fat and twine. Still, it holds its flame very well. Beads of oil
 drip from near the flame, running down the sides and coating them with
 slime.

 A loud crackle splits the sound of wind. Lightning. Stone tumbles in
 the distance.

>examine frock
 A threadbare frock that does little to keep you warm. The coarse
 fabric scratches where it touches your body, which is less than it
 used to be: the frock is far too large for you now. It smells of sweat
 and tears.

>dance
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>sing
 Your days in the choir are long behind you.

>xyzzy
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine bed
 Little more than a damp mattress on four legs. Still it is comfortable
 on cold nights.

>look under bed
 Mould creeps from the blackness, but you find nothing else.

 Your Bedroom
 The room is small; the same as all the others. But it seems smaller of
 late. The hall extends to the west.

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
 from this morning.

>search desk
 It has no drawers.

>examine blanket
 These have kept you warm on many cold nights.

>make bed
 You do not have the energy for that.

>take blanket
 Taken.

>push desk
 (first closing the door)
 Beads of sweat pooling into your eyebrows, you heave the desk towards
 the door. A few of your joints crack a bit, but you manage to move the
 desk.

>push desk
 With as much effort as it took to move the desk in the first place,
 you slide it back against the wall. You're getting too old for this.

>go west
 (opening the bedroom door)
 Pulling your frock tightly about you, you sigh and exit to the hall.

 Entrance Hall
 As cold as your room is, this hall is even colder. The stone walls
 dance and glisten with dampness. The warmth of your room awaits to the
 east, and the cold of the outside world through a heavy door to the
 south. Moonlight streams in from the cloister to the north, and a
 flimsy door secures the locutory to the west.

 The alms box hangs closed beside the door.

>shiver
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>wear blanket
 You put on the bedding.

>examine box
 (the alms box)
 It used to be filled with alms. Now, mostly cobwebs.

>examine cobwebs
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine moonlight
 You can't see any such thing.

>empty box
 (the alms box)
 The alms box is closed.

>open box
 (the alms box)
 A single coin sparkles at you from the bottom.

>get coin
 It feels warm in your hand.

>examine coin
 It gleams in the light.

>listen
 The wind. Nothing more.

 A wolf howls in the distance. A hungry, plaintive sound.

>flip coin
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>bite coin
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to
 the cloister and south to outside.

 The alms box hangs open, as poor as the people it is meant to help.

>flip coin
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west
 (opening the door to the locutory)

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has
 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for
 those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired
 frame supporting a light mattress.

 Near the door to the east is a fireplace, its embers cold for days.

>examine bed
 This bed is small but clean. Visitors are rare lately.

>l under bed
 Mould creeps from the blackness, but you find nothing else.

>examine fireplace
 The fireplace lies cold: cold as the rest of Saint Cuthbert's.

>take mould
 That holds little interest for you.

>smell fireplace
 Mildew.

 A gust of wind slices across your ears. You shiver.

 Entrance Hall

 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to
 the cloister and south to outside.

 The alms box hangs open, as poor as the people it is meant to help.

>go north
 Bracing yourself for the cold, you lower your hood and exit to the
 cloister.

 Cloister
 In the warmer months, Brother Matteo maintains a beautiful garden in
 the cloister. Now there is nothing but a few dead vines sticking out
 from beneath a blanket of snow. Still, it has a calm dignity: the wind
 finds no entrance here. The colonnade is broken to the south by the
 exit to the hall and to the west by the entrance to the refectory. The
 brothers' dormitory lies to the east, between the calefactory in the
 southeast and the belltower in the northeast.

 The church commands from the north, its spires reaching up to Heaven.

 Brother Lucca, face flushed and cheeks wet, storms out from the bell
 tower and off to the dormitory in the east, meeting your eyes for only
 a moment.

 "Are you alright, Brother?" you ask, receiving no response.

>examine lucca
 He left for the dormitory.

>examine vines
 Tangles of vines poke up through the snow.

>search snow
 You find nothing of interest.

>take snow
 You take a small handful of snow, and already, your hand is suffering.

>take vines
 Despite being dead, they cling desperately to the soil. You cannot
 move them.

>eat snow
 It stings your teeth and lines them with grit.

>throw snow
 You toss the snow: a sweaty little ball of cold.
 The snow trickles out of your hand as a few drops of water.

>smile
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine god
 He is too far off to see.

>talk to god
 He is not here.

>pray
 (to God)
 A warmth spreads throughout your body. He walks with you.

>hit god
 He is not here.

>pray to Jesus
 A warmth spreads throughout your body. He walks with you.

 That's not something you can sit down on.

>go west

 Refectory
 The only room at Saint Cuthbert's large enough to hold all the
 brothers, except for the church, the refectory seems immense.
 Normally, when you are in here the place is alive. Now, the only
 movement is that of drafts spinning between the tables and out to the
 cloister in the east. Row upon row of deserted seats stand testament
 to the damage inflicted by the plague. The kitchen lies to the south.

 Brother Drogo sits at one of the tables, scratching furiously at its
 hard surface.

>hello drogo
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>greet drogo
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine drogo
 Brother Drogo sits in a filthy frock, black tendrils of greasy hair
 dangling in his eyes. Every now and then, he puffs loudly to blow the
 hair out of his face, but it always falls back.

>tell drogo about absent god
 "Please, father." He doesn't look up from the table. "This is far more
 important."

>talk to drogo
 "How are you feeling, brother?"

 "Oh, I am feeling quite alright. In fact, I feel like a bird who
 crawls under the soil."

 Whispers dance in your ears. Growing. Fading.

>listen
 The wind. Nothing more.

 Whispers dance in your ears. Growing. Fading.

>examine table
 Rows of tables split the refectory into a maze of narrow paths. Their
 unfinished surfaces bear the scratches of many meals.

>scratch ear
 I only understood you as far as wanting to scratch.

>examine scratches
 At first it looks random, but upon closer inspection it appears to a
 picture. It cuts deep: two intersecting lines surrounded by jagged
 grooves. A cross. Fire.

>dance
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to drogo about cross
 "Please, father." He doesn't look up from the table. "This is far more
 important."

>talk to drogo about table
 "Why do you scratch at the table, Brother Drogo?" You ask.

 "To get to the middle, of course." He says, looking at you as though
 you are mad.

>talk to drogo about middle
 "And why do you want to reach the middle?"

 "Because it is that much closer to the bottom."

>talk to drogo about bottom
 "And the bottom?"

 "Hmm." He pauses thoughtfully and stares at the deepening hole. "That
 is a good question."  The scratching resumes.

>look under table
 You find nothing of interest.

>talk to drogo about plague
 "Please, father." He doesn't look up from the table. "This is far more
 important."

>talk to drogo about lucca
 "What's wrong with Lucca?"

 "He's a murderer, of course."

 A gust of wind slices across your ears. You shiver.

>talk to drogo about murder
 "What happened, Drogo?" You ask.

 "Well, the way I see it is that Matteo wanted to fly, but God said
 'No, Matteo. Flying is for birds. You are not a bird, and shouldn't
 wish to be.'" Drogo starts. "Matteo was not happy with that --you know
 how he can be sometimes-- but he thought God would be mad if he tried
 to fly on his own. So Lucca helped him."

>talk to drogo about matteo
 "What happened, Drogo?" You ask.

 "Well, the way I see it is that Matteo wanted to fly, but God said

 Brother Drogo mumbles to himself, his eyes darting back and forth from
 nothing to nothing.

 They peer out between curtains of greasy hair, ever watchful.

>close eyes
 That's not something you can close.

>examine hair
 You can't see any such thing.

>watch eyes

>ask drogo about garden
 "What friends, Drogo?"

 "Oh, you wouldn't like them." He smiles, his teeth form a brilliant
 row. "But they would sure like you!"

>talk to drogo about ground

 A wolf howls in the distance. A hungry, plaintive sound.

 Kitchen
 The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is
 practically empty. Bare tables stand with no crumbs on them. All the
 perishables were finished up this morning. No more will be coming if
 Rovato is as barren as you think. Hopefully, some remain in the cellar
 through the hatch in the floor. The refectory lies to the north.

 A cutlery rack sits on one of the tables.

 Against one wall is a large cupboard, its door closed.

>examine rack
 The rack is empty.

>open cupboard
 As the door swings open, a small black shape springs from inside. A
 flash of pain sears across your arm and then quickly subsides. You
 whirl around to see a cat tearing out into the refectory, a drop of
 blood falling from its claws.

>examine cupboard
 A few crusts of bread and a piece of cheese are all that remains for
 food.

>take bread
 Taken.

>take cheese
 You already have that.

>examine cheese
 Just a few crusts of bread and a piece of cheese. It's not much, but
 it should do.

>open cellar
 It's locked.

>examine cellar
 A hatch sits in the floor with a large, steel lock upon it.

>examine lock
 Constantin insisted on locking up the cellar, to ensure the brothers
 could only get their alloted rations. He never gave you the key.

>knock on door

>go east

 Dormitory
 Dozens of openings line the hall, each leading to a separate cell,
 except for the west, which leads to the cloister. Although there are
 no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much
 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the
 northeast, Constantin's is to the southeast, and Lucca's to the
 southwest.

 A scraping sound comes from Constantin's cell, forming an eerie melody
 with the sobs from Matteo's.

>listen
 The brisk scraping from Constantin's room does nothing to hide the
 sobs from Matteo's.

>look se
 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

 Constantin's Room
 Constantin is one of the few brothers with anything in his room
 besides a bed. A few tools lay next to the door in the northwest;
 remnants of his life as a blacksmith. A smell lingers here: a sour
 smell.

 Brother Constantin sits on the bed, a young hare dangling from his
 hand. His knife moves swiftly.

>smell
 It's hard to place. It's a sick smell. Vomit, perhaps?

>examine hare
 The hare dangles by one foot from Constantin's massive hand, blood
 soaking its snow-damp fur. It twitches. No. It doesn't. That is only
 the movement of the knife against its flesh.

>examine knife
 It gleams wickedly in the candlelight.

>examine tools
 Constantin was a Godsend when he arrived five years ago. Before him,
 Saint Cuthbert's had to enlist the help of laypeople in Rovato
 whenever something needed to be built. Now, Constantin does it all
 cheerfully, except for the occasional grumble.

>grumble
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>t hare
 No response.

>ask constantin about constantin
 "Oh, I'm fine." He coughs a little, but it shakes his whole body.

>talk to constantin about hare
 "Ah, I see you have found us something to eat."

 Constantin looks up distractedly. "What?  Oh, yes. Something to eat,"
 he says, returning to his catch.

>ask constantin about key
 "A precaution. I don't want anyone stealing any food."

>ask constantin about drogo
 "Why'd you let him back here?  He isn't fit to be with the rest of

 Despite his size, he moves swiftly, his knife darting in and out

 feet.

 The blood collects in a small pool at Constantin's feet, warming their

 Dormitory
 Dozens of openings line the hall, each leading to a separate cell,
 except for the west, which leads to the cloister. Although there are
 no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much
 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the
 northeast, Constantin's is to the southeast, and Lucca's to the
 southwest.

 A scraping sound comes from Constantin's cell, forming an eerie melody
 with the sobs from Matteo's.

 Matteo's Room
 This room is small: the same as all the others. A bed is pushed up

 His fingers bloody on the stone. His face is red and wet with tears.

 "Matteo is hiding something. I just know it's under here."

>ask lucca about matteo
 "He knows something, but he won't tell me," he sobs more heavily for a
 moment. "He tells me nothing anymore."

 A warmth spreads through your body, soothing the chill and fear from
 your bones. Salvation.

 She is here.

 In the warmer months, Brother Matteo maintains a beautiful garden in

 from beneath a blanket of snow. Still, it has a calm dignity: the wind

 exit to the hall and to the west by the entrance to the refectory. The

 Constantin's Room
 Constantin is one of the few brothers with anything in his room
 besides a bed. A few tools lay next to the door in the northwest;
 remnants of his life as a blacksmith. A smell lingers here: a sour
 smell.

 Brother Constantin sits on the bed, a young hare dangling from his
 hand. His knife moves swiftly.

 Constantin was a Godsend when he arrived five years ago. Before him,

 whenever something needed to be built. Now, Constantin does it all
 cheerfully, except for the occasional grumble.

 Bell Tower
 High above the rest of Saint Cuthbert's, the tower affords a view of
 the surrounding land. In the spring, it is quite beautiful: now all
 you see is the endless moonlit glow of snow. Snow in the trees. Snow
 in the mountains. Snow.

 The bell sways in the breeze, its tongue almost, but never, touching
 the sides.

 Brother Matteo leans against the rails, staring into the wind.

>examine mattero
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine matteo
 He looks tired and heavy. He doesn't so much as lean on the rails as
 use them as crutch. His frock billows about him in the icy wind; he no
 longer has the will to bundle it about himself.

>examine frock
 A threadbare frock that does little to keep you warm. The coarse
 fabric scratches where it touches your body, which is less than it
 used to be: the frock is far too large for you now. It smells of sweat
 and tears.

>examine matteo's frock
 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine Matteo's eyes.

>take matteo's eyes
 Taken.

>examine matteo's eyes
 They sink into his skull. His eyelids can barely be bothered to remain
 open.

>examine bell
 (the bell)
 Almost as old as Saint Cuthbert's itself, the mechanical bell
 announces the passage of the hours. Matteo was never needed to ring
 it, but he likes to be here when it sounds nonetheless.

 Whispers dance in your ears. Growing. Fading.

>open matteo's eyelids
 I only understood you as far as wanting to open Matteo's eyes.

>ring bell

 The bell clangs. You have never been this close when it has before.
 Your ears sting for a bit before settling down.

 "How are you Matteo?" you ask, leaning up on the rails beside him.

 He turns, a friendly smile on his face. "I don't even know anymore."
 He gives an exaggerated shrug.

 "I know we have had our problems, but I hope to put them behind us. It
 is a time for forgiveness."

>ask matteo about lucca
 "Poor Lucca," he sighs. "I wish I could protect him, but his time is
 near."

>ask matteo about cellar
 "Ah, yes." He pauses. "The cellar."  He chuckles to himself.

>ask matteo about constantin
 "He would never admit it, but he is sick. The plague wears on him. He

 Perhaps this is the only place at Saint Cuthbert's that is a

 Church (in the pews)
 Since you relegated the brothers to pray on their own, except for
 Mass, the church has been all but empty. Rows of pews part down the
 centre, ushering you up to the chancel in the north opposite the
 cloister in the south. The ceiling towers above you, its frescoes dim
 in the candlelight.

 Towering above all else is a massive wooden cross. It is awesome.

 The font glows warmly in the candlelight, not a ripple on its water's
 surface.

 The Saints smile cheerfully down upon you from their colorful windows.

 Brother Ignatius sits in one of the pews near the front, staring
 intently at the candles.

 You close your eyes, and prepare yourself. "Please, Satan," you begin.
 The words are hard. They cut your throat as they leave. "Please,
 Satan, deliver me from the plague, and you shall have my soul."  The
 words sink through the Earth: slowly, like black tar.

 A flock of dismembered hands reach up through the ground, stealing
 away the black and disease that ravages your body, both seen and
 unseen. They swirl and dance, before sinking back to the ground. One
 lingers. It crawls up your leg and across your chest. It dives in, and
 emerges clutching a tiny ball of light in its bony finger. The hand
 drops back to the Earth with its prize and slinks away.

 It is done.

 Church (in the pews)
 Cedar pews line the path from the chancel in the north to the cloister
 to the south, their surfaces cold. The ceiling towers above you, its
 frescoes dim in the candlelight.

 Towering above all else is a massive wooden cross. It is awesome.

 The font glows warmly in the candlelight, not a ripple on its water's
 surface.

 The Saints smile cheerfully down upon you from their colorful windows.

 Brother Ignatius sits in one of the pews near the front, staring
 intently at the candles.

 It is secured in place.

 A gust of wind slices across your ears. You shiver.

 It feels rough on your fingers.

 The water is clear and clean: it sparkles in the candlelight and
 dances with your breath.

 You need to be holding the cut before you can put it into something

 Church (on the chancel)
 You have spent many a solemn Mass up here, gazing out unto a sea of
 your brethren. Now, all you see is a sea of empty pews to the south.

 Towering above all else is a massive wooden cross. It is awesome.

 A beautiful glass case holds the body of Saint Cuthbert near the base
 of the chancel.

 The lectern stands in the centre of the chancel, the Bible atop it
 shining with gold filigree.

 The Saints smile cheerfully down upon you from their colorful windows.

>preach

 You say a few words of prayer, but they go unheard.

>examine bible
 Ah, the Bible. How many times has it been there for you?  When your
 heart is heavy, you often come to read it, and reflect upon its
 wisdom. Now, though, you find it intruding upon your thoughts during
 the most mundane of tasks. Passages spring to you unbidden: filling
 your ears with the words of God. Filling your mind with... What?  It
 is currently open to Ecclesiastes 9:3.

>read bible
 Ecclesiastes 9:3

 "This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that
 there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is
 full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after
 that they go to the dead."

>go south

 Cloister
 In the warmer months, Brother Matteo maintains a beautiful garden in
 the cloister. Now there is nothing but a few dead vines sticking out
 from beneath a blanket of snow. Still, it has a calm dignity: the wind
 finds no entrance here. The colonnade is broken to the south by the
 exit to the hall and to the west by the entrance to the refectory. The
 brothers' dormitory lies to the east, between the calefactory in the
 southeast and the belltower in the northeast.

 The church commands from the north, its spires reaching up to Heaven.

>go south

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to
 the cloister and south to outside.

 The alms box hangs open, as poor as the people it is meant to help.

 As you enter the hall, you hear a feeble rasping at the southern door.

 "Please, help me. Is anyone in there?" A faint voice calls over the
 wind.

 "Please, I have traveled for days. Rovato is a graveyard. The rats
 have eaten everything."

>ask about rats
 You can't see any such thing.

>open door
 Pushing the bar out of the way, you open the door, allowing a frail
 figure and a drift of snow to spill into the hall.

 Before you, fingers bloody and face as pale as the snow it lies in, is
 a young woman. Her clothing is little more than tatters with stains of
 blood from where her hands were resting.

 "Please," she gasps, raising herself up for a moment. "I am so cold."
 With that, she returns her face to the icy ground.

>give blanket to girl
 Her slumber is too deep.

>put blanket on girl
 Perhaps if you get her somewhere more comfortable first.

>take girl
 With more than a little trouble, you hoist the girl into your arms.
 Your knees feel as though they might buckle but hold for now.

>examine woman
 For all her cuts and tattered clothes, she is still exceedingly
 beautiful. Her skin, while pale, is unblemished. In fact, no sign of
 the plague can be seen within her at all. She is perfection.

>kiss woma
 You can't see any such thing.

 Your knees are beginning to buckle. You had better do something with
 her before trying anything else.

 A gust of wind slices across your ears. You shiver.

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to
 the cloister and south to outside.

 The alms box hangs closed beside the door.

>go west
 You turn sideways and slide into the locutory, careful not to catch
 the young woman's head on the frame.

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has
 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for
 those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired
 frame supporting a light mattress.

 Near the door to the east is a fireplace, its embers cold for days.

>put girl on bed
 You lay the young girl on the bed, and she immediately relaxes. Her
 eyes remain closed but no longer twitch with discomfort.

>put blanket on girl
 You drape your bedding over the girl, and she seems to calm down a
 bit.

>ask girl about plague
 She sleeps; she cannot hear.

 Sweet. Delicious.

 Tempting.

 You kiss her gently. She is soft. So soft. She tastes good.

 Archway
 The last hint of shelter against the outside world. But it is only a
 hint. The wind rushes by like a stream of ice water to the south: only
 the curve of the arch protects you. The warmth, for as much as it can
 be called that, of the monastery awaits to the north and the cold of
 outside to the south.

>examine arch
 The tapered blocks fit together in a crooked fashion; they seem as
 though they could slip at a moment's notice. Still, the archways
 shields you from the wind.

 A wolf howls in the distance. A hungry, plaintive sound.

 The wind gusts at your candle and bites at your feet. To venture out

 Your Bedroom
 The room is small; the same as all the others. But it seems smaller of

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the side other is your bed.

 Beads of sweat pooling into your eyebrows, you heave the desk towards

 Refectory
 The only room at Saint Cuthbert's large enough to hold all the
 brothers, except for the church, the refectory seems immense.
 Normally, when you are in here the place is alive. Now, the only
 movement is that of drafts spinning between the tables and out to the
 cloister in the east. Row upon row of deserted seats stand testament
 to the damage inflicted by the plague. The kitchen lies to the south.

 Brother Drogo mumbles to himself, his eyes darting back and forth from
 nothing to nothing.

 Kitchen
 The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is

>set girl on fire
 I only understood you as far as wanting to set girl.

>light fire
 After much coaxing, you finally get the wet logs to ignite. The flame
 is weak, but it will do.

 The warmth is finally enough for her to stir.

 "Food,"  she says. "Please."

 With that, she passes back into slumber.

>give food to girl
 "Here," you say, holding out the food. "I have brought you something
 to eat."

 Finally, the girl stirs awake and quickly grabs the food from your
 hands. "Thank you," she says as she shoves the food into her mouth.
 Within moments, the few crumbs you had given her are gone, and she
 finally seems content.

>talk to girl
 She starts slowly.

 "Thank you for your kindness, father."  She starts, extending her hand
 for the pax. "My name is Cec--"  Just then, her words are cut off by
 the sound of a bell ringing in the distance. Her eyes widen and the
 blood drains from her cheeks.

 "There's nothing to be afraid of," you say, taking her hand gently.
 "It is only the bell of Compline."

 "That is why I am afraid." Her chin drops to her chest.

>ask girl about bell
 "Go now, we will talk soon," she replies through heavy tears.

 The bell continues its toll. Four. Five. Six... In place of the
 seventh ring is a scream. A scream that rips in from the cloister and
 silences the wind.

 The girl places her head in her hands with a slight sob. "I am sorry,
 Father."  Then, turning. "And to you too."

>comfort girl
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 The church squats to the north, Her spires clawing at the sky as She
 tries to climb away from the Earth.

 "Oh, my God!" You hear someone cry from the northeast. "Matteo!"

>go northeast

 Base of the Bell Tower
 The smooth patch of snow at the base of the tower, formerly cut only
 by a single line of footsteps, is now a mash of dirt and blood. Steps
 lead northeast and up to the tower, and to the southwest is the
 cloister.

 Brother Matteo lies upon the ground, blood trickling from the side of
 his head. Lucca kneels by his side.

 The remaining brothers are gathered around the body, shouting.

 Drogo jumps up and down, rubbing his hands with glee. "It begins," he
 squeals to you through a wide grin.

 A rather violent cough shakes your body. Mucus cakes your nose.

>punch drogo
 You are too weak.

 Constantin strides forward and smacks Lucca across the face, sending
 him sprawling into the snow. "Get away from him, murderer!"  He
 shouts, eyes burning.

 "Constantin!" Ignatius shouts defiantly, stepping between the two.
 Although Constantin towers above him, Ignatius looks taller than you
 have ever seen him. "Leave the boy alone."

 Drogo giggles.

>examine matteo
 He looks so calm. Tiny snowflakes trace the creases in his face,
 lingering longer and longer as time passes. His mouth fills with snow.

 "But he is a murderer!"  Constantin replies, stepping back, face
 flushed.

 "I know that as well as you. But that does not excuse you from God's
 wishes."

>talk to lucca
 "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," is his only reply.

 "We will lock him up in the cellar, then the father can decide what to
 do with him."  Ignatius continues.

 Constantin chews his lip, releasing a tiny drop of blood. "No, the
 cellar will not do. We will lock him in the calefactory."

 "Fine, fine. As you wish."

>talk to constantin
 "Shut up, father," he barks. For a moment he seems about to apologize,
 but he doesn't.

 With that, Constantin hoists Lucca by the shoulders and shoves him
 towards the calefactory.

 Ignatius turns towards you and says. "You should get some sleep,
 father. We all should. You can get to the bottom of all this in the
 morning."  He turns and walks towards the dormitory.

 A wolf howls in the distance. A hungry, plaintive sound.

 "Why do they think Lucca did it?" You ask.

 "Because he did."  He replies, confused. "Why else would one think
 such a thing?"

 "I mean, how do they know he did it."

 "Oh, well that isn't what you asked, now is it, father?" He continues.
 "Well, when we got here, Brother Lucca was already here saying 'I'm
 sorry, I'm sorry.'"

 Silence.

 Nothing. You cannot feel him.

 The day is beginning to catch up with you. You yawn with a lot more
 force than you would have thought necessary.

 "You're wonderful," Drogo squeals, embracing you. "If only we were all
 so old and lumpy!"

>ask drogo about satan
 "They say he is everywhere..." his voice drops and his eyes widen in
 terror at something behind you. You whirl around. Nothing.

 "Just having a little fun with you, father."  He laughs.

>take body
 Matteo was a large man. You cannot move him.

>ask drogo about matteo
 "What happened, Drogo?" You ask.

 "Well, the way I see it is that Matteo wanted to fly, but God said
 'No, Matteo. Flying is for birds. You are not a bird, and shouldn't
 wish to be.'" Drogo starts. "Matteo was not happy with that --you know
 how he can be sometimes-- but he thought God would be mad if he tried
 to fly on his own. So Lucca helped him."

>ask drogo about lucca
 "Lucky Lucca!" Drogo exclaims. "He gets the heat, and we get the cold.
 Maybe I should murder someone too!"  He grins, but not as laughingly
 as you would hope.

 Base of the Bell Tower
 The smooth patch of snow at the base of the tower, formerly cut only
 by a single line of footsteps, is now a mash of dirt and blood. Steps
 lead northeast and up to the tower, and to the southwest is the
 cloister.

 Brother Matteo's corpse lies upon the ground, the blood freezing to
 his face.

 Drogo grins at you.

 You say a few hollow words. They dry and crumble in your mouth.

 "Sweet dreams, father!" Drogo calls out to you as he disappears into
 the black.

 Cloister
 There will be no garden here come spring. It is hard to imagine the
 snow will ever melt.

 The colonnade is broken to the south by the exit to the hall and to
 the west by the entrance to the refectory. The brothers' dormitory
 lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the
 belltower in the northeast.

 The church squats to the north, Her spires clawing at the sky as She
 tries to climb away from the Earth.

>eat words

>examine me
 You're not the man you were a few days ago. Your skin hangs as sallow
 drapes around your jaw: your hands are emaciated. Your frock billows
 about you; it is difficult to find any flesh within. A scratch lines
 your arm from wrist to elbow; it is only a strip of dried blood now.

 Running your hand across your neck, you find a small lump hidden
 within the folds of skin. It is tender.

 Panting more than a little, you make your way up the stairs to the

 Bell Tower
 You are sure that other things exist, but for now all there is is
 Matteo lying on the ground below. From here, he could easily be alive.
 He smiles at you.

 No, not a smile: a sneer. He is laughing at you. Laughing because you
 are still trapped. He was always laughing.

 Written in a slothful scrawl:

 Sext

 I would normally write in my journal, but in my increasing paranoia, I
 have hidden it. Now, I kick myself as it seems so far away. Everything
 is so far away: such a burden. Lucca has been pestering me to tell him
 what I know, but I can't. It burdens me so; I cannot do that to
 someone so pure.

 Vespers

 I can take it no more. I don't care if I burn for eternity, I must
 leave this place. The Devil walks Saint Cuthbert's in the hearts and
 minds of my brothers: in me.

 I'm sorry, Lucca.

 Uncomfortable looking pews part before you, leading up to the chancel

 The Saints smile sadly at you from their glass houses.

 "This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that

 Ignatius's Room
 Ignatius's room does not smell as strongly as the others. He has spent
 so much time in the infirmary of late, taking care of the sick. He is
 a braver man than you. A bed is pushed up against one wall, opposite
 the door to the south.

 Ignatius sits upon his bed, preparing to go to sleep.

>talk to ignatius
 "Do you believe that Lucca did it?" you ask.

 "I don't know," he replies calmly. "But it's best to be safe. I never
 would have thought Lucca could've had it in him, but these trying
 times make demons of us all."  He glances at you pointedly.

>show note to ignatius

 His shoulders tighten. "If it's all the same to you, father," he says,
 straightening out his bed. "I think I would like to get some sleep."

 Perhaps this is the only place at Saint Cuthbert's that is a

 are incited by one another.

 You can hear Lucca gibber softly beyond the door.

 "About the murder, Lucca..." you ask.

 "What murder?"

>talk to lucca
 "You remember, Lucca; Matteo was thrown from the tower."

 "No he wasn't."  Lucca responds, incredulous. "He must have jumped."

>talk to lucca

 A long, heavy silence. "Because he was smart."

>talk to lucca
 "Why was Matteo smart to jump?"

 "Because he knew what was happening here, at Saint Cuthbert's."

 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has
 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for

 frame supporting a light mattress.

 A small circle of warmth surrounds the fireplace near the door to the

 The girl sobs gently, head in her hands.

 "How did you know that that would happen?  Who are you?  Why did you

 The room is small; the same as all the others. But it seems smaller of

 Pushed up against the wall on one side is the desk, its surface
 sagging slightly in the middle. The dampness is taking its toll.

 Your bed calls to you from the side of the room. Her song is sweet,
 but it sings of treachery.

 Beads of sweat pooling into your eyebrows, you heave the desk towards

 Her words drift off into the night, and you feel alone once more.

 A few hours later, you are awoken by a strange scuffling sound

 Returning to your cold bed, you sleep until morning.

 the west by the entrance to the refectory. The brothers' dormitory
 lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the
 belltower in the northeast.

 The church cowers away from the sun. Her sins, like all sins, are
 revealed by the light of day.

 You see Drogo strolling past to the south before he catches sight of
 you and waves.

 "Father!" Drogo squeals, skipping towards you. "I was just about to
 come find you. You must come with me!  It is so beautiful!"  He says,
 grabbing you by the arm and tugging you towards the church.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Cloister
 The sun shines in the east, but the cloister is dim. There was no snow
 last night, but it remains high. It is dirty and soaks up what little
 light makes it here.

 The colonnade is broken to the south by the exit to the hall and to
 the west by the entrance to the refectory. The brothers' dormitory
 lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the
 belltower in the northeast.

 The church cowers away from the sun. Her sins, like all sins, are
 revealed by the light of day.

 Church (in the pews)
 A tangle of pews fills the room: they part through the middle and up
 to the chancel in the north. Light hits the windows and slides down
 outside: lost. The church is dim; the frescoes are lost in shadow.

 Drogo grins widely as he drags you up to the chancel.

 "Come, father."  His eyes glow with childlike enthusiasm, but his grip
 is of steel. "We are almost there!"

 Something is different at the far end of the chancel. Is it?

 Good Lord.

 Cold knives of pain cut through your skull. They ease off, leaving a
 dull throbbing behind your eyes.

>hit drogo
 That would be difficult with Drogo dragging you.

 Church (on the chancel)
 Was your time wasted up here? Was it all for naught? As you look to
 the empty pews to the south, you wonder how it has helped anyone.

 Drogo stands proudly and looks to you for approval, his grin
 tentative.

 "Look, father!" he says, dragging you before the cross. "I made it all
 by myself."

 Looking up, you see what Drogo was so excited about. Matteo dangles
 crucified from the cross, vicious holes in his hands and feet.

 Cold knives of pain cut through your skull. They ease off, leaving a
 dull throbbing behind your eyes.

>pray to cecilia
 You say a few short words to Cecilia.

 She can do nothing for you, right now.

 "Well, father. Isn't it beautiful?" Drogo stands, gripping your wrist
 tightly and nodding proudly to himself.

>examine matteo
 Matteo's corpse dangles from the cross. The wounds in his head, hands,
 and feet sparkle with crystals of frozen blood, and his eyes stare
 through you to nothing.

 Jesus always looked so beautiful on the cross. Matteo just looks dead.

>examine drogo
 His hair is pasted to his forehead with sweat. His eyes are wild and
 bloodshot.

 Drogo strokes his chin thoughtfully. "Hmmm. But it needs something."
 He looks confused for a moment, before flinging a hand in the air with
 a satisfied whistle. "And I know exactly what!"

 Before you can move, he sprints out of the church.

 The Saints look down with cold eyes. It is not pity. Something else.

 Saint Cuthbert sinks in his tomb, rot creeping in from his

 The lectern is weak and brittle, barely able to support the weight of

 Outside the Calefactory
 Perhaps this is the only place at Saint Cuthbert's that is a
 comfortable temperature. Heat blasts at you from the calefactory to
 the southeast, but it is countered by the chill from the cloister to
 the northwest. No, that isn't right. They do not cancel: their furies
 are incited by one another.

 Constantin goes about repairing the door, hands moving swiftly.

>tell constantin about matteo
 "Damn Lucca. He'll burn in Hell for what he did."

>tell constantin about drogo
 "Drogo crucified Matteo." Your words are flat, lifeless.

 "Damnit," he slams the hammer extra hard, and turns to you. "Why did

 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the

 frame supporting a light mattress.

 A small circle of warmth surrounds the fireplace near the door to the

 Cecilia paces back and forth.

 A gust of wind slices across your ears. You shiver.

 She closes her eyes. "I cannot hear much. God's voice is weak in this
 place. But I know Lucca did not escape. At least, not on his own."

>go south

 Path
 The sun's light does nothing to warm you, but instead it burns your
 eyes with its fury: nothing like the cool darkness inside the
 monastery to the north. It is so bright that you can barely make out
 the stables to the east: they are just a darker square in a field of
 white. The infirmary is a little clearer to the west. A tangle of
 footsteps lead south to the gate.

 A lone white dove flies off into the morning sun.

>examine dove
 The dove is gone.

>examine footsteps
 There are two sets: one that goes both in and out, and another that
 only goes out. Mingled among them is a strange pattern in the snow. It
 looks as though someone was using two hot pokers as walking sticks,
 one in each hand. The melted holes cut through the snow, revealing
 scorch marks on the dead grass beneath.

>examine dove
 The dove is gone.

 Stables
 In the shadow of the stables, you can make things out a little more
 clearly. Half-a-dozen empty stalls show the plague's influence: with
 their caretakers dead, the horses starved. The smell winds its way
 through your nostrils, numb though they are. It can be escaped to the
 path in the west or the garden in the northeast. A small ladder leads
 up to the roof of the stables.

 A bale of hay sits just slightly more than neck's length from the
 horses' stalls.

>smell
 The sweat of panic is a different kind of sweat. The maddened horses
 reek of it. The cold has staved off their rot somewhat, but even now,
 it creeps through the air.

>examine horses
 No. You were wrong. Not all the horses starved. Some tried to escape.
 The gates are mashed and torn, but none of the horses were strong
 enough to break out. Their hooves are bloody and raw: their heads soft
 with bruises.

 Wait. One still moves. She is sore and thin, but she lives.

 Grunting more than a little, you pull yourself up the ladder.

 The smell is even worse up here. Snow weighs on the roof, causing it

 now, the roof barely supports the snow.

 The moment you touch her, she goes wild. The last thing you see is a
 flurry of hooves before you are knocked to the ground and trampled.

 snow.

 Gate
 Lightning has torn through the gate, leaving only dark, broken rocks
 in its place. Black scorch marks twist their way through the rubble:
 stone crumbs are all that remain in some places. The snow is caked in
 soot: usually it would be lined with many footsteps, now only a few
 disturb the inky darkness. The snow covered path winds its way back
 north to the monastery and south towards Rovato.

 A series of strange mounds line the southern side of where the gate
 used to be.

 The wind whips its way through the tombstones, whistling a harsh tune.

>go west

 Refectory
 The only room at Saint Cuthbert's large enough to hold all the
 brothers, except for the church, the refectory seems immense.
 Normally, when you are in here the place is alive. Now, the only
 movement is that of drafts spinning between the tables and out to the
 cloister in the east. Row upon row of deserted seats stand testament
 to the damage inflicted by the plague. The kitchen lies to the south.

>go south

 Kitchen
 The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is
 practically empty. Bare tables stand with no crumbs on them, and a
 hatch through the floor leads to the cellar. The refectory lies to the
 north.

 A cutlery rack sits on one of the tables.

 A bare cupboard sits up against the wall.

 A hatch sits in the floor with a large, steel lock upon it.

 At first it looks random, but upon closer inspection it appears to a

 grooves. A cross. Fire.

>go east

 Cloister
 The sun shines in the east, but the cloister is dim. There was no snow
 last night, but it remains high. It is dirty and soaks up what little
 light makes it here.

 The colonnade is broken to the south by the exit to the hall and to
 the west by the entrance to the refectory. The brothers' dormitory
 lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the
 belltower in the northeast.

 The church cowers away from the sun. Her sins, like all sins, are
 revealed by the light of day.

>go east

 Dormitory
 Dozens of openings line the hall, each leading to a separate cell,
 except for the west, which leads to the cloister. Although there are
 no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much
 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the
 northeast, Constantin's is to the southeast, and Lucca's to the
 southwest.

 Ignatius's Room
 Ignatius's room does not smell as strongly as the others. He has spent
 so much time in the infirmary of late, taking care of the sick. He is

 the door to the south.

>go northeast

 Base of the Bell Tower
 Nestled in the northeast corner of the cloister, the bell tower rises
 high: higher than the steeples of the church. Footsteps cut a line in
 the snow from the cloister to the southwest to the tower itself in the
 northeast.

>go up
 Panting more than a little, you make your way up the stairs to the
 top.

 Bell Tower
 The snow below is dark and broken. Yet all around is pristine. It is
 clean.

 The bell sways in the breeze, its tongue almost, but never, touching
 the sides.

 Closing your eyes, you step from the edge. The wind whistles about
 you, but you cannot hear it.

 Hell has a special place for those who commit suicide.

 Church (in the pews)
 A tangle of pews fills the room: they part through the middle and up
 to the chancel in the north. Light hits the windows and slides down
 outside: lost. The church is dim; the frescoes are lost in shadow.

 Matteo hangs from the cross, melting snow forms a pool at his feet.

 The font squats before the chancel, its finish a mouldy grey.

 The Saints look down with cold eyes. It is not pity. Something else.

 It does not light. The dampness spoils everything here.

 Violent coughs spew from your lungs. You wipe a small spattering of
 blood from your mouth.

 Saint Francis stands: birds on his shoulders and wolves at his feet.

 Saint Cuthbert leans proudly upon his staff even though he appears

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has
 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for

 frame supporting a light mattress.

 A small circle of warmth surrounds the fireplace near the door to the

 Archway
 The last hint of shelter against the outside world. But it is only a
 hint. The wind rushes by like a stream of ice water to the south: only
 the curve of the arch protects you. The warmth, for as much as it can
 be called that, of the monastery awaits to the north and the cold of
 outside to the south.

>go south

 Path
 The sun's light does nothing to warm you, but instead it burns your
 eyes with its fury: nothing like the cool darkness inside the
 monastery to the north. It is so bright that you can barely make out

 white. The infirmary is a little clearer to the west. A tangle of
 footsteps lead south to the gate.

 Half-a-dozen empty stalls show the plague's influence. As die the
 shepard, so does the flock. The smell winds its way through your

 roof of the stables.

 Her hunger satiated, the horse eyes you skittishly.

 When they find you, you are little more than a bloody smear in the
 snow.

 Climbing atop the horse, you drive your heels into her sides. She
 whinnies, but remains calm as she takes off to the south.

 After what seems like hours, you reach a small creek. Or at least it
 used to be a small creek. The few hours of sunlight have melted the
 snow enough that it is now a raging torrent.

 River
 The sound is deafening as the river to the south crashes its way
 through jagged stones. White plumes of water explode off the rocks,
 soaking through your already damp frock.

 The tracks end here in a bloody stain upon the snow.

>examine stain
 The tracks, orderly one-two steps before, are now a tangled mash
 leading into the river. The snow is dirty and soaked with blood.

 A little downstream is a sack filled with straw. No, not a sack:
 something else.

 A gust of wind slices across your ears. You shiver.

>examine sack
 The thing flaps in the water: it looks to be burlap with a shock of
 straw sprouting from the top. Getting a little closer, you see how
 wrong you were.

 Lucca. His mouth is agape: frozen. Blood wells up from inside and
 mingles with the water as it flows by, adding a little color to the
 white and blue.

>take lucca
 Careful not to slip, you drag Lucca up the bank.

>examine lucca
 You touch the body briefly and feel his bones ground to meal inside.
 He is soft and bruised from the fury of the water. But the deep, sharp
 wound in his back looks more like a knife wound than anything done by
 nature. Oh, Lucca.

 Digging through his frock, you find a rough piece of paper. It is wet,
 but holds together as you pull it out.

>read paper
 On the front, written in ink:

 I have tried praying, but my thoughts still torment me. No one
 listens!  So I will write. They always say God sees everything, but
 maybe he just doesn't hear everything.

 I don't know what to do. Matteo tells me something strange is going
 on, but he can't tell me what. No, he won't tell me what. He's afraid
 of endangering me. Or he doesn't care. I can't tell with him anymore.

 He doesn't care about anything anymore.

 He says not to trust anyone. I wonder if that applies to him as well.
 He has changed; he never kept secrets before. He says not to trust
 even the father. He says he has changed the most.

 And on the back, written in blood:

 Matteo is dead. And he was right. Everyone has changed.

 You say a few short words to Cecilia.

 You can't summon the will to perform the Pax.

 You attempt to swim across the river. At first, all is going well,

 grabbing at anything that will hold you.

 Nothing does.

 Just as the monastery comes into view, a sound echoes throughout the
 hills. A crisp, clean sound. Rock on rock.

 Mountain Pass
 Still. The wind has all but stopped. Steep, white hills tower on both
 sides, blocking you in. The monastery looms in the north.

 The horse nuzzles up against you, eyes blank.

 The sound continues. It is difficult to place: with the echo, it could
 be anywhere.

 Glancing around, you find the source, a dark shape high on the hill
 amongst some rocks. It is moving.

 The sound gets louder.

 The figure moves rapidly. Black against white.

 The cracking sound is joined another: a more diffuse sound. A rumble.

 in an avalanche.

 The horse snaps out of its stupor, ears shooting up. Before you can
 move, she bolts off down the pass.

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 Trees are snapped like twigs, joining the slide.

>wait

 Waves of snow consume you, crushing the air from your lungs. You would

 move, she bolts off down the pass.

>pray to cecilia
 The words slip out of your mouth, and immediately, a gentle glow flows

 leaving you bathed in warmth.

 Eventually, it subsides and you feel no different than you did before.

 mountain sliding down in a massive avalanche. You spur the horse on,
 but she isn't fast enough.

 The roar of the snow is not the last sound you hear. Who knew horses
 could scream?

 Just a few feet from your head, the wave of snow splits in two,
 passing to either side of you.

 The rush lasts only a few more seconds before dwindling, and when it
 stops, you are shaken but unharmed.

>go north
 With the avalanche over and the horse gone, you have no choice but to
 make it back to the monastery on foot.

 You don't know how long it takes. All you know is now the sky has
 clouded over, and drifts of snow make their way down from above.

 shepard, so does the flock. The smell winds its way through your
 nostrils, numb though they are. It can be escaped to the path in the
 west or the garden in the northeast. A small ladder leads up to the
 roof of the stables.

 A shrill, bleating noise comes from the northeast.

>go northeast

 Garden
 These gardens used to provide most of the food for the entire
 monastery. Now, none. A few black stalks poke through the snow, their
 appearance always perfectly predicted by the rows they were planted
 in. The wilderness is stronger here: twisted briars overrun the
 garden. The stables lie back to the southwest.

 A hole has been cut through the briars to the north.

 A garbled bleat rises through the hole in the briars.

>examine hole
 A hole no larger than a man has been cut through the briars, leading
 to the north.

 A garbled bleat rises through the hole in the briars.

>enter hole
 Bowing your head through the brush, you enter a clearing.

 Clearing
 A small patch of snow surrounded by briars. This used to be part of
 the garden; now nature has reclaimed it. The belltower rises out of
 the briars: a small hint of civilization in the wild.

 The hole through the briars leads back south.

 As you enter the clearing, you see what the bleat was. A lamb, no more
 than a few weeks old, is tied to a branch, struggling frantically. He
 cries out in terror as a pack of wolves encroach from the briars. They
 are hungry and confused. Do they go for the small, easy meat?  Or the
 larger, more difficult meat?

 Just then, a shout from the belltower draws your attention. "Yoohoo,
 father!" You look up to see Drogo waving happily. "You shouldn't have
 come: it's feeding time." -- he shrugs -- "Oh well. Either way,
 they'll get fed."  With that, he disappears down the stairs.

 Mountain Pass
 Still. The wind has all but stopped. Steep, white hills tower on both
 sides, blocking you in. The monastery looms in the north.

 The figure moves rapidly. Black against white.

 The horse nuzzles up against you, eyes blank.

 The cracking sound is joined another: a more diffuse sound. A rumble.

>pray to satan
 You close your eyes, and prepare yourself. "Please, Satan," you begin.
 The words are hard. They cut your throat as they leave. "Please,
 Satan, deliver me from the plague, and you shall have my soul."  The
 words sink through the Earth: slowly, like black tar.

 A flock of dismembered hands reach up through the ground, stealing
 away the black and disease that ravages your body, both seen and
 unseen. They swirl and dance, before sinking back to the ground. One
 lingers. It crawls up your leg and across your chest. It dives in, and
 emerges clutching a tiny ball of light in its bony finger. The hand
 drops back to the Earth with its prize and slinks away.

 It is done.

 The rumble turns to a roar. Waves of snow begin coasting down the hill
 in an avalanche.

 The horse snaps out of its stupor, ears shooting up. Before you can
 move, she bolts off down the pass.

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 Trees are snapped like twigs, joining the slide.

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 It is here.

>wait

 Waves of snow consume you, crushing the air from your lungs. You would
 fight, but the cold is so intense you cannot move.

 How can something so white look so black?

 Path
 The light is gentler now. No, not gentler: weaker. Clouds block the
 sun, making it easy to see the stable to the east in a field of white.
 The infirmary lies to the west while the gate is to the south. The

 A faint, garbled sound rises from the east.

>examine lamb
 The lamb strains against the branch, but he is far too weak to escape
 on his own.

 The alpha swings his head back and forth between you and the lamb. The
 others follow in unison.

>pray to cecilia
 Tears in your eyes, you mumble desperately for Cecilia to hear you.
 The wolves circle you, ready to pounce. You speak faster. Louder.
 Please.

 The alpha's teeth close around your arm for a moment, clamping hard.
 But then, a warmth spread through your limbs and soothes away the
 cold. The wolf's bite turns into a gentle caress as he begins to
 licking the wound he just inflicted. Satisfied you are safe, you shoo
 away the wolves.

 The danger gone, you release the lamb. He nuzzles up to you for a
 moment before running off into the brush, bleating cheerfully.

 Grunting more than a little, you pull yourself up the ladder.

 Stables (on the roof)
 The smell is even worse up here. Snow weighs on the roof, causing it
 to sink in the middle. Sometimes hay is stored up here in the summer:
 now, the roof barely supports the snow.

 Four chimes drone from the tower: Sext.

 Darkness begins to creep across the sky from atop the infirmary in the

 gate to the south. The monastery lies to the north, its walls offering
 promises of shelter.

>go north

 Archway
 The last hint of shelter against the outside world. But it is only a
 hint. The wind rushes by like a stream of ice water to the south: only
 the curve of the arch protects you. The warmth, for as much as it can
 be called that, of the monastery awaits to the north and the cold of
 outside to the south.

>go north

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to
 the cloister and south to outside.

 The alms box hangs closed beside the door.

>go west
 Before you leave, you close the entrance door lest the snow, or worse,
 get in.

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has
 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for
 those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired
 frame supporting a light mattress.

 A small circle of warmth surrounds the fireplace near the door to the
 east.

 Cecilia paces back and forth.

>talk to cecilia
 "Thank Heavens you are here," Cecilia says, embracing you: what is
 that on her back?  "You must hurry, God told me that Constantin has
 been locking the plague victims in the cellar until they die, that is
 why he put the lock there, not to protect the food, but to protect
 himself. He killed Lucca to keep his secret. Go, get the cellar's key
 from him. If you hurry, there may be some survivors."

>pray to cecilia's god

 Cloister
 Clouds close off the sky, blocking the light but not the snow.

 The colonnade is broken to the south by the exit to the hall and to
 the west by the entrance to the refectory. The brothers' dormitory
 lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the
 belltower in the northeast.

 The church rolls and laughs to the north, pointing Her sharp fingers
 in a perpetual mock at God.

 A dark blackish red spill marks the ground.

>examine spill
 The liquid is a thick soup of black and red with small chunks of food
 mixed in. Blood and bile: plague vomit.

>se

 Outside the Calefactory
 Perhaps this is the only place at Saint Cuthbert's that is a
 comfortable temperature. Heat blasts at you from the calefactory to
 the southeast, but it is countered by the chill from the cloister to
 the northwest. No, that isn't right. They do not cancel: their furies
 are incited by one another.

 A large pool of vomit has melted a hole in the snow.

 A fresh blanket of snow lies upon the ground.

 Calefactory
 Positioned directly between the dormitory and your own room, the
 calefactory warms both, although lately it is less than adequate.
 While the calefactory itself is stiflingly hot, its heat stays
 confined. Your brow grows damp: your body, feverish. Slightly melted
 snow creeps in from the cloister to the northwest.

 A red scrawl winds its way around the room.

>examine scrawl
 It says:

 I'm sorry, God. Please forgive me. The evil of my brothers and the
 father has been an affront to you. Forgive them. Please.

 Someone's here.

 That is all.

 Wet footsteps sound from behind. "Curious, isn't it?"  It is Ignatius.

 He sidles up beside you and traces the blood with his hand. "He must
 have been sicker than we thought," --he pauses-- "The plague makes
 monsters of us all."

>tell ignatius about lucca
 "Don't worry, father. He will kill no more."

 Ignatius circles the room, but he never strays far from the door.

>tell ignatius about cellar
 "I think it's empty."

 Ignatius looks you up and down, unblinking.

 Dormitory
 Dozens of openings line the hall, each leading to a separate cell,

 no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much
 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the
 northeast, Constantin's is to the southeast, and Lucca's to the
 southwest.

 The vomit marks a trail into Constantin's cell.

 Constantin's Room
 These walls are Constantin's tomb. Slime coats the floor and slides
 from the walls. The stench is trapped, harsh. It can be escaped to the
 northwest.

 The floor is soaked with vomit, making it almost slippery to walk on.

 Constantin lies on his side, vomit oozing from the side of his mouth.
 A set of keys dangles from the belt of his frock, jingling ever so
 slightly.

>take keys
 You gently try to untangle the keys from his belt, but the moment you
 touch them, they jingle as if to sound an alarm. Constantin's swollen
 eyelids snap open, revealing two bloodshot orbs.

 "Thief!" he cries, bolting up. Despite his illness, he is still a
 strong man. He flings you against the wall, knocking you unconscious.
 Despite your illness, you are still a weak man.

 You don't wake up.

 Refectory
 The only room at Saint Cuthbert's large enough to hold all the
 brothers, except for the church, the refectory seems immense.
 Normally, when you are in here the place is alive. Now, the only
 movement is that of drafts spinning between the tables and out to the
 cloister in the east. Row upon row of deserted seats stand testament
 to the damage inflicted by the plague. The kitchen lies to the south.

>go south

 Kitchen
 The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is
 practically empty. Bare tables stand with no crumbs on them, and a
 hatch through the floor leads to the cellar. The refectory lies to the

 A cutlery rack sits on one of the tables.

 A bare cupboard sits up against the wall.

 You brace yourself for the hard impact at the bottom, but it never

 bones, but at least nothing breaks. The light from the kitchen barely
 makes it down the stairs: all you see is shadows.

>light candle
 The fat sizzles for a moment as the flame comes to life but settles
 down soon after.

 Cellar
 Dozens of bodies fill the cellar: waist-high in some places. The faces
 are familiar, if not for the plague and decay. Hollow eyes drill into
 you from all sides. The flicker of the candle makes the corpses writhe
 and dance.

 There is little food left. An old cask of wine sits against one side.

 A prybar leans propped up against the cask.

 Footsteps sound through the hatch. They are faint but growing

 The pain is unbearable, but the knife to your throat ends it soon
 enough.

                                Day One












 It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five
 days since I closed the gate.

 Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot
 appeared: when the first bloody cough ensued from the mouth of an
 urchin. To have allowed the sick sanctuary at Saint Cuthbert's would
 only have damned us as well.

 But we were already damned.

 The plague came. And now we suffer.

 Six crisp chimes mark Vespers. Your heart flutters for a moment, and
 you place your head in your hands.

 Your Bedroom
 Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems
 smaller of late. With so many of your brothers gone, there has been
 little for you to do but wait. Wait for the spots to appear in this
 tiny, dark room.

 A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the
 west.

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
 from this morning.

 You can make out little. Some light streams in down the stairs, but it

 "Damn!" You hear someone curse from the kitchen. The footsteps grow
 faster as they rush towards the stairs.

>hide in bodies
 Bracing yourself for the smell, you worm your way into the pile of
 bodies. The weight is suffocating, as is the smell.

 "Come on out, father!" The voice is hoarse and broken. A candle bobs
 down the stairwell.

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 He searches around for a few moments: it appears your plan is working.

 "Come out!" he demands. "I know you're in here."

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 "Enough games, father" he says, drawing a wickedly curved knife.
 Moving with cold, swift strikes, he begins stabbing into the mound of
 bodies.

 You wait till he's close before swinging your leg as hard as you can
 into the back of his knee. He crumbles, his head smashing against the
 hard floor.

>out
 Pulling your frock tightly about you, you sigh and exit to the hall.

 Entrance Hall
 As cold as your room is, this hall is even colder. The stone walls
 dance and glisten with dampness. The warmth of your room awaits to the
 east, and the cold of the outside world through a heavy door to the
 south. Moonlight streams in from the cloister to the north, and a
 flimsy door secures the locutory to the west.

 The alms box hangs closed beside the door.

>break box

 You are too weak.

>open box

 A single coin sparkles at you from the bottom.

>steal coin
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take coin
 It feels warm in your hand.

>go north
 Bracing yourself for the cold, you lower your hood and exit to the
 cloister.

 Cloister
 In the warmer months, Brother Matteo maintains a beautiful garden in
 the cloister. Now there is nothing but a few dead vines sticking out
 from beneath a blanket of snow. Still, it has a calm dignity: the wind
 finds no entrance here. The colonnade is broken to the south by the
 exit to the hall and to the west by the entrance to the refectory. The
 brothers' dormitory lies to the east, between the calefactory in the
 southeast and the belltower in the northeast.

 The church commands from the north, its spires reaching up to Heaven.

 Brother Lucca, face flushed and cheeks wet, storms out from the bell
 tower and off to the dormitory in the east, meeting your eyes for only
 a moment.

 "Are you alright, Brother?" you ask, receiving no response.

 Thunder rumbles overhead, shaking the monastery to its foundations.

 An itch tickles beneath your skin.

>go northeast

 Base of the Bell Tower
 Nestled in the northeast corner of the cloister, the bell tower rises
 high: higher than the steeples of the church. Footsteps cut a line in
 the snow from the cloister to the southwest to the tower itself in the
 northeast.

 A loud crackle splits the sound of wind. Lightning. Stone tumbles in
 the distance.

>go up
 Panting more than a little, you make your way up the stairs to the
 top.

 Bell Tower
 High above the rest of Saint Cuthbert's, the tower affords a view of
 the surrounding land. In the spring, it is quite beautiful: now all
 you see is the endless moonlit glow of snow. Snow in the trees. Snow
 in the mountains. Snow.

 The bell sways in the breeze, its tongue almost, but never, touching
 the sides.

 Brother Matteo leans against the rails, staring into the wind.

>pray to satan
 You close your eyes, and prepare yourself. "Please, Satan," you begin.
 The words are hard. They cut your throat as they leave. "Please,
 Satan, deliver me from the plague, and you shall have my soul."  The
 words sink through the Earth: slowly, like black tar.

 A flock of dismembered hands reach up through the ground, stealing
 away the black and disease that ravages your body, both seen and
 unseen. They swirl and dance, before sinking back to the ground. One
 lingers. It crawls up your leg and across your chest. It dives in, and
 emerges clutching a tiny ball of light in its bony finger. The hand
 drops back to the Earth with its prize and slinks away.

 It is done.

>push matteo
 He turns his back to you for a moment. It is long enough. You slam
 your hands into his back, and he tumbles over the rail. As he falls,
 he casts a smile at you. His last.

>push matteo
 Not from here.

>pray to god
 His scream rips through your mind. He is anger. He is hate.

>go down

 Base of the Bell Tower
 The smooth patch of snow at the base of the tower, formerly cut only
 by a single line of footsteps, is now a mash of dirt and blood. Steps
 lead northeast and up to the tower, and to the southwest is the
 cloister.

 Brother Matteo lies upon the ground, blood trickling from the side of
 his head

>search matteo
 You dig through the folds of his frock and find a wrinkled note.

>get matteo
 Matteo was a large man. You cannot move him.

>go north
 You can go only northeast, southwest, up or in.

>in
 Panting more than a little, you make your way up the stairs to the
 top.

 Bell Tower
 You are sure that other things exist, but for now all there is is
 Matteo lying on the ground below. From here, he could easily be alive.
 He smiles at you.

 No, not a smile: a sneer. He is laughing at you. Laughing because you
 are still trapped. He was always laughing.

 The bell sways in the breeze, its tongue almost, but never, touching
 the sides.

 The church commands from the north, its spires reaching up to Heaven.

>go north

 Church (in the pews)
 Since you relegated the brothers to pray on their own, except for
 Mass, the church has been all but empty. Rows of pews part down the
 centre, ushering you up to the chancel in the north opposite the
 cloister in the south. The ceiling towers above you, its frescoes dim
 in the candlelight.

 Towering above all else is a massive wooden cross. It is awesome.

 The font glows warmly in the candlelight, not a ripple on its water's
 surface.

 The Saints look away from you, crying.

 Brother Ignatius sits in one of the pews near the front, staring
 intently at the candles.

>go north

 Church (on the chancel)
 God, to think of all the time you wasted up here. The blind leading
 the blind. A quiet laugh spreads through your heart. A joke.  The rest
 of the church lies to the south; it's not as funny of a joke.

 Towering above all else is a massive wooden cross. It is awesome.

 A beautiful glass case holds the body of Saint Cuthbert near the base
 of the chancel.

 The lectern stands in the centre of the chancel, the Bible accusing
 you from its perch.

 The Saints look away from you, crying.

>smash case
 The slam of your fist shatters the glass, sending it cascading over
 the Saint's body.

>eat corpse
 You dig your teeth into his flesh. It yields like butter, but it
 burns. Burns your teeth. Burns your throat. It settles in your stomach
 and burns there too.

 An itch tickles beneath your skin.

>break windows
 You are too weak.

>go south

 Church (in the pews)
 Cedar pews line the path from the chancel in the north to the cloister

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to

 The alms box hangs open, as poor as the people it is meant to help.

>go south
 (opening the outside door)

 Archway
 The last hint of shelter against the outside world. But it is only a
 hint. The wind rushes by like a stream of ice water to the south: only
 the curve of the arch protects you. The warmth, for as much as it can
 be called that, of the monastery awaits to the north and the cold of
 outside to the south.

>go south

 Dormitory
 Dozens of openings line the hall, each leading to a separate cell,

 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the
 northeast, Constantin's is to the southeast, and Lucca's to the
 southwest.

 A scraping sound comes from Constantin's cell, forming an eerie melody
 with the sobs from Matteo's.

 Constantin's Room
 Constantin is one of the few brothers with anything in his room
 besides a bed. A few tools lay next to the door in the northwest;
 remnants of his life as a blacksmith. A smell lingers here: a sour
 smell.

 Brother Constantin sits on the bed, a young hare dangling from his
 hand. His knife moves swiftly.

>tell constantin about matteo

 This room is small: the same as all the others. A bed is pushed up

 Lucca scrabbles frantically at the ground, his blood staining the
 stones.

 Whispers dance in your ears. Growing. Fading.

>tell lucca about matteo
 "He knows something, but he won't tell me," he sobs more heavily for a
 moment. "He tells me nothing anymore."

>read note
 Written in a slothful scrawl:

 I would normally write in my journal, but in my increasing paranoia, I
 have hidden it. Now, I kick myself as it seems so far away. Everything
 is so far away: such a burden.

 The father came to visit me earlier; he is not the same man I knew and
 respected. He looked at me with murder in his eyes. I would tell
 Lucca, but I am scared. No, I am lazy. I do not care if he kills me. I
 would do it myself were I not such a coward.

 A wolf howls in the distance. A hungry, plaintive sound.

 As you enter the hall, you hear a feeble rasping at the southern door.

 "Please, help me. Is anyone in there?" A faint voice calls over the
 wind.

 "Please, I have traveled for days. Rovato is a graveyard. The rats
 have eaten everything."

>go south
 Pushing the bar out of the way, you open the door, allowing a frail
 figure and a drift of snow to spill into the hall.

 Before you, fingers bloody and face as pale as the snow it lies in, is
 a young woman. Her clothing is little more than tatters with stains of
 blood from where her hands were resting.

 "Please," she gasps, raising herself up for a moment. "I am so cold."
 With that, she returns her face to the icy ground.

>kill girl
 You strike the woman, hard. "Wake up!" You snarl.

 She doesn't.

>get girl
 With more than a little trouble, you hoist the girl into your arms.
 Your knees feel as though they might buckle but hold for now.

 The young woman groans and kicks slightly as the cold from the

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to

 The alms box hangs open, as poor as the people it is meant to help.

>go north
 The young woman groans and kicks slightly as the cold from the

>go east
 Perhaps the locutory would be more comfortable.

>go west
 (opening the door to the locutory)
 You turn sideways and slide into the locutory, careful not to catch
 the young woman's head on the frame.

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has
 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for
 those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired
 frame supporting a light mattress.

 Near the door to the east is a fireplace, its embers cold for days.

>put girl in bed
 You lay the young girl on the bed, and she immediately relaxes. Her
 eyes remain closed but no longer twitch with discomfort.

>light fire
 After much coaxing, you finally get the wet logs to ignite. The flame
 is weak, but it will do.

>go east
 Before you leave, you close the entrance door lest the snow, or worse,
 get in.

 Bedroom
 The room is small; the same as all the others. But it seems smaller of
 late. The hall extends to the west.

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
 from this morning.

 You drape your bedding over the girl, and she seems to calm down a

 The warmth is finally enough for her to stir.

 "Food,"  she says. "Please."

 With that, she passes back into slumber.

>go north

 Cloister
 In the warmer months, Brother Matteo maintains a beautiful garden in
 the cloister. Now there is nothing but a few dead vines sticking out
 from beneath a blanket of snow. Still, it has a calm dignity: the wind
 finds no entrance here. The colonnade is broken to the south by the
 exit to the hall and to the west by the entrance to the refectory. The
 brothers' dormitory lies to the east, between the calefactory in the
 southeast and the belltower in the northeast.

 The church commands from the north, its spires reaching up to Heaven.

>go north

 Church (in the pews)
 Cedar pews line the path from the chancel in the north to the cloister
 to the south, their surfaces cold. The ceiling towers above you, its
 frescoes dim in the candlelight.

 Towering above all else is a massive wooden cross. It is awesome.

 The font glows warmly in the candlelight, not a ripple on its water's
 surface.

 The Saints look away from you, crying.

 Brother Ignatius sits in one of the pews near the front, staring
 intently at the candles.

>undo

 Refectory
 The only room at Saint Cuthbert's large enough to hold all the
 brothers, except for the church, the refectory seems immense.
 Normally, when you are in here the place is alive. Now, the only
 movement is that of drafts spinning between the tables and out to the
 cloister in the east. Row upon row of deserted seats stand testament
 to the damage inflicted by the plague. The kitchen lies to the south.

 Brother Drogo mumbles to himself, his eyes darting back and forth from
 nothing to nothing.

>go north
 You can go only south, east, in or out.

>go south

 Kitchen
 The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is
 practically empty. Bare tables stand with no crumbs on them. All the
 perishables were finished up this morning. No more will be coming if
 Rovato is as barren as you think. Hopefully, some remain in the cellar
 through the hatch in the floor. The refectory lies to the north.

 A cutlery rack sits on one of the tables.

 Against one wall is a large cupboard, its door closed.

>open cupboard
 As the door swings open, a small black shape springs from inside. A
 flash of pain sears across your arm and then quickly subsides. You
 whirl around to see a cat tearing out into the refectory, a drop of
 blood falling from its claws.

>give food to girl
 "Here," you say, holding out the food. "I have brought you something
 to eat."

 Finally, the girl stirs awake and quickly grabs the food from your
 hands. "Thank you," she says as she shoves the food into her mouth.
 Within moments, the few crumbs you had given her are gone, and she
 finally seems content.

>talk to girl
 She starts slowly.

 "Thank you for your kindness, father."  She starts, extending her hand
 for the pax. "My name is Cec--"  Just then, her words are cut off by
 the sound of a bell ringing in the distance. Her eyes widen and the
 blood drains from her cheeks.

 "There's nothing to be afraid of," you say, taking her hand gently.
 "It is only the bell of Compline."

 "That is why I am afraid." Her chin drops to her chest.

>talk to girl
 "What do you mean?" you ask.

 The girl turns her tear-stained eyes to you. "You'll see,"

 The bell continues its toll. Four. Five. Six... In place of the
 seventh ring is a scream. A scream that rips in from the cloister and
 silences the wind.

 The girl places her head in her hands with a slight sob. "I am sorry,
 Father."  Then, turning. "And to you too."

>kiss girl
 She backs away from you.

 A garbled sob is all she can give.

 The church squats to the north, Her spires clawing at the sky as She
 tries to climb away from the Earth.

 "Oh, my God!" You hear someone cry from the northeast. "Matteo!"

>go northeast

 Base of the Bell Tower
 The smooth patch of snow at the base of the tower, formerly cut only
 by a single line of footsteps, is now a mash of dirt and blood. Steps
 lead northeast and up to the tower, and to the southwest is the
 cloister.

 Brother Matteo lies upon the ground, blood trickling from the side of
 his head. Lucca kneels by his side.

 The remaining brothers are gathered around the body, shouting.

 Drogo jumps up and down, rubbing his hands with glee. "It begins," he
 squeals to you through a wide grin.

>talk to lucca
 "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," is his only reply.

 Constantin strides forward and smacks Lucca across the face, sending
 him sprawling into the snow. "Get away from him, murderer!"  He
 shouts, eyes burning.

 "Constantin!" Ignatius shouts defiantly, stepping between the two.
 Although Constantin towers above him, Ignatius looks taller than you
 have ever seen him. "Leave the boy alone."

 Drogo giggles.

>talk to drogo
 "Why do they think Lucca did it?" You ask.

 "Because he did."  He replies, confused. "Why else would one think
 such a thing?"

 "I mean, how do they know he did it."

 "Oh, well that isn't what you asked, now is it, father?" He continues.
 "Well, when we got here, Brother Lucca was already here saying 'I'm
 sorry, I'm sorry.'"

 "But he is a murderer!"  Constantin replies, stepping back, face
 flushed.

 "I know that as well as you. But that does not excuse you from God's
 wishes."

>talk to drogo
 "What happened, Drogo?" You ask.

 "Well, the way I see it is that Matteo wanted to fly, but God said
 'No, Matteo. Flying is for birds. You are not a bird, and shouldn't
 wish to be.'" Drogo starts. "Matteo was not happy with that --you know
 how he can be sometimes-- but he thought God would be mad if he tried
 to fly on his own. So Lucca helped him."

 "We will lock him up in the cellar, then the father can decide what to
 do with him."  Ignatius continues.

 Constantin chews his lip, releasing a tiny drop of blood. "No, the
 cellar will not do. We will lock him in the calefactory."

 "Fine, fine. As you wish."

>talk to drogo
 "Shhh," he hushes, holding a finger to his lips. "This is the most
 entertaining skit I have ever seen."

 With that, Constantin hoists Lucca by the shoulders and shoves him
 towards the calefactory.

 Ignatius turns towards you and says. "You should get some sleep,
 father. We all should. You can get to the bottom of all this in the
 morning."  He turns and walks towards the dormitory.

>talk to ignatius

 He isn't here.

 Drogo grins at you. "Oh, the fun we'll have!"

 Drogo ignores you to swat at an invisible fly.

 Ignatius's Room
 Ignatius's room does not smell as strongly as the others. He has spent
 so much time in the infirmary of late, taking care of the sick. He is
 a braver man than you. A bed is pushed up against one wall, opposite
 the door to the south.

 Ignatius sits upon his bed, preparing to go to sleep.

>tell ignatius about glass case
 "I am busy right now, father." He replies abruptly.

 An itch tickles beneath your skin.

>talk to ignatius
 "Do you believe that Lucca did it?" you ask.

 "I don't know," he replies calmly. "But it's best to be safe. I never
 would have thought Lucca could've had it in him, but these trying
 times make demons of us all."  He glances at you pointedly.

>talk to ignatius
 "What do you mean?"

 He thinks for a moment, and looks to the ceiling. "It's just that in
 these times we can sometimes find ourselves doing things we never
 thought we had in us."

>talk to ignatius
 "Like what?"

 His shoulders tighten. "If it's all the same to you, father," he says,
 straightening out his bed. "I think I would like to get some sleep."

 Perhaps this is the only place at Saint Cuthbert's that is a

 are incited by one another.

 You can hear Lucca gibber softly beyond the door.

 The girl sobs gently, head in her hands.

>talk to girl
 "How did you know that that would happen?  Who are you?  Why did you
 come?" The questions come faster than the words.

 "Calm down, father," she says, laying a hand on your wrist. It warms
 to the touch and spreads life and joy and peace through your body. "I
 am here to help. My name is Cecilia"

>talk to girl
 "God sent me, but I am weak. My strength depends on the faithful, and
 your brethren have lost their way. Even now they conspire against you.
 And me." She casts a frightened glance towards the door.

 "Please pray to me, father, when you go to bed. I need your strength
 in the midst of this wickedness."

>talk to girl
 "Go now, father," she says, turning over in your blanket. "Sleep." She
 casts once last look at you before closing her eyes. "But be careful,

 The room is small; the same as all the others. But it seems smaller of

 Pushed up against the wall on one side is the desk, its surface

 Your bed calls to you from the side of the room. Her song is sweet,
 but it sings of treachery.

>get in bed
 You get onto the bed.

 You lay your head down on the cold, hard bed and drift off to sleep

 A few hours later, you are awoken by the sound of heavy breathing

 Returning to your cold bed, you sleep until morning.

 You awake to the sound of a sharp pounding at your door.

 "Father!" Constantin's growl is clear. "Wake up, Lucca has escaped!"

 Morning light streams through the window, but it is a cold, heavy
 light.

 With as much effort as it took to move the desk in the first place,
 you slide it back against the wall. You're getting too old for this.
 You'll have to get off the bed first.

 Bedroom
 Cold, heavy light slides in through the window and creeps along the

 You see Drogo strolling past to the south before he catches sight of
 you and waves.

 "Father!" Drogo squeals, skipping towards you. "I was just about to
 come find you. You must come with me!  It is so beautiful!"  He says,
 grabbing you by the arm and tugging you towards the church.

>go north
 He's already dragging you that way.

 Church (in the pews)
 A tangle of pews fills the room: they part through the middle and up
 to the chancel in the north. Light hits the windows and slides down
 outside: lost. The church is dim; the frescoes are lost in shadow.

 Drogo grins widely as he drags you up to the chancel.

 "Come, father."  His eyes glow with childlike enthusiasm, but his grip
 is of steel. "We are almost there!"

 Something is different at the far end of the chancel. Is it?

 Good Lord.

>go north
 He's already dragging you that way.

 Church (on the chancel)
 God, to think of all the time you wasted up here. The blind leading
 the blind. A quiet laugh spreads through your heart. A joke.  The rest
 of the church lies to the south; it's not as funny of a joke.

 Drogo stands proudly and looks to you for approval, his grin
 tentative.

 "Look, father!" he says, dragging you before the cross. "I made it all
 by myself."

 Looking up, you see what Drogo was so excited about. Matteo dangles
 crucified from the cross, vicious holes in his hands and feet.

>laugh
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look at cross
 Matteo's corpse dangles from the cross. The wounds in his head, hands,
 and feet sparkle with crystals of frozen blood, and his eyes stare
 through you to nothing.

 Jesus always looked so beautiful on the cross. Matteo just looks dead.

 "Well, father. Isn't it beautiful?" Drogo stands, gripping your wrist
 tightly and nodding proudly to himself.

>yes
 "It is, isn't it?"  Drogo strokes his chin for a moment before
 flinging a hand up in the air. "But it's missing something, and I know
 just where to find it."

 Before you can move, he sprints out of the church.

 Matteo's Room
 He always had so many secrets. You knew it would kill him one day, but
 not Lucca. North leads out.

 One of the flagstones is tinted with blood.

>go north

 Dormitory
 Dozens of openings line the hall, each leading to a separate cell,
 except for the west, which leads to the cloister. Although there are
 no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much
 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the
 northeast, Constantin's is to the southeast, and Lucca's to the
 southwest.

>go north

 Ignatius's Room
 Ignatius's room does not smell as strongly as the others. He has spent
 so much time in the infirmary of late, taking care of the sick. He is
 a braver man than you. A bed is pushed up against one wall, opposite
 the door to the south.

 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the

>go west

 Cloister
 The sun shines in the east, but the cloister is dim. There was no snow
 last night, but it remains high. It is dirty and soaks up what little
 light makes it here.

 The colonnade is broken to the south by the exit to the hall and to
 the west by the entrance to the refectory. The brothers' dormitory
 lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the
 belltower in the northeast.

 The church cowers away from the sun. Her sins, like all sins, are
 revealed by the light of day.

>go south

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to
 the cloister and south to outside.

 The alms box hangs open, as poor as the people it is meant to help.

>go south
 (opening the outside door)

 Archway
 The last hint of shelter against the outside world. But it is only a
 hint. The wind rushes by like a stream of ice water to the south: only
 the curve of the arch protects you. The warmth, for as much as it can
 be called that, of the monastery awaits to the north and the cold of
 outside to the south.

>go south

 Path
 The sun's light does nothing to warm you, but instead it burns your
 eyes with its fury: nothing like the cool darkness inside the
 monastery to the north. It is so bright that you can barely make out
 the stables to the east: they are just a darker square in a field of
 white. The infirmary is a little clearer to the west. A tangle of
 footsteps lead south to the gate.

 A lone white dove flies off into the morning sun.

>go south

 Gate
 Lightning has torn through the gate, leaving only dark, broken rocks
 in its place. Black scorch marks twist their way through the rubble:
 stone crumbs are all that remain in some places. The snow is caked in
 soot: usually it would be lined with many footsteps, now only a few
 disturb the inky darkness. The snow covered path winds its way back
 north to the monastery and south towards Rovato.

 A series of strange mounds line the southern side of where the gate
 used to be.

>dig
 Shoveling through the snow with frostbitten hands, you eventually
 strike a rock.

 No. Not a rock. You push back the rest of the snow to uncover the icy,
 stone-hard face of a young woman. She has only two colors: black and
 white. Plague colors.

>go west
 You can go only north or out.

>out
 The fallen snow is too thick. You would not make it far on foot.

>go west

 Outside the Infirmary
 The infirmary stands well away from the rest of the monastery. Little
 good it has done, though. The plague still seeped its way in. A
 rickety door leads into the infirmary, and a well-worn path leads to
 the cemetery in the northwest and back to the main path in the east.

>go northwest

 Cemetery
 The wind whips its way through the tombstones, whistling a harsh tune.
 The air is crisp and clean, the smell of corpses is nowhere to be
 found. In a section off from the established cemetary, row upon row of
 makeshift crosses stand: plague victims. The path winds its way back
 to the infirmary in the southeast.

>dig
 You tear into the snow with your hands, struggling to hold onto your
 fingers in the cold. Eventually, you strike the soil. Clearing a
 little patch, you find the soil undisturbed. You try another hole.
 Same thing. Nothing has disturbed the ground in quite some time.

>dig
 There is nothing to find.

>go east

 Stables
 In the shadow of the stables, you can make things out a little more
 clearly. Half-a-dozen empty stalls show the plague's influence: with
 their caretakers dead, the horses starved. The smell winds its way
 through your nostrils, numb though they are. It can be escaped to the
 path in the west or the garden in the northeast. A small ladder leads
 up to the roof of the stables.

 A bale of hay sits just slightly more than neck's length from the
 horses' stalls.

>open stall
 The horse, with vitality born of starvation, bolts towards the hay as
 soon as you unlatch the gate. She knocks you to the ground with her
 head, which isn't so bad.

 It's her hooves on your neck that are.

>get hay

>feed horse
 The horse hastily starts chomping at the hay. Within moments, the
 entire bale is gone.

 A gust of wind slices across your ears. You shiver.

>open stall
 The horse eyes you as you open her stall, but makes no move to leave.

>talk to horse
 She whips her head and huffs at you.

>kill horse
 Raising your hand, you strike the horse across the muzzle. She
 flinches but stands defiant. Not to be thwarted by a dumb mule, you
 ball your hand into a fist and wail into her a few more times. It
 takes several minutes, but soon she is broken and subdued.

>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>get horse
 Just walk, she will follow you.

 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>mount horse
 Perhaps you should go somewhere more suited to riding.

>go south
 The horse trots along after you.

 Gate
 Broken stone and snow are all that remain here. A north-south path
 with but a few footsteps can be picked out through the rubble leading
 from the monastery towards Rovato.

 A tangled mass of corpses lines the southern side of the former gate.

>mount horse
 Climbing atop the horse, you drive your heels into her sides. She
 whinnies, but remains calm as she takes off to the south.

 After what seems like hours, you reach a small creek. Or at least it
 used to be a small creek. The few hours of sunlight have melted the
 snow enough that it is now a raging torrent.

 River
 The sound is deafening as the river to the south crashes its way
 through jagged stones. White plumes of water explode off the rocks,
 soaking through your already damp frock.

 The tracks end here in a bloody stain upon the snow.

>examine stain
 The tracks, orderly one-two steps before, are now a tangled mash
 leading into the river. The snow is dirty and soaked with blood.

>river
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>water
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine river
 White and blue. Its wrath is awe-inspiring. The river tears at the
 rocks, and its roar tears at your ears.

 A little downstream is a sack filled with straw. No, not a sack:
 something else.

 A little downstream is a sack filled with straw. No, not a sack:

>sack

>examine sack
 The thing flaps in the water: it looks to be burlap with a shock of
 straw sprouting from the top. Getting a little closer, you see how
 wrong you were.

 Lucca. His mouth is agape: frozen. Blood wells up from inside and
 mingles with the water as it flows by, adding a little color to the
 white and blue.

>search corpse
 Lucca stares up at you, his eyes as cold as the water around them.

 You'll have to pull him to shore before you can search him.

>get corpse
 Careful not to slip, you drag Lucca up the bank.

>search corpse
 You touch the body briefly and feel his bones ground to meal inside.
 He is soft and bruised from the fury of the water. But the deep, sharp
 wound in his back looks more like a knife wound than anything done by
 nature. Oh, Lucca.

 Digging through his frock, you find a rough piece of paper. It is wet,
 but holds together as you pull it out.

 An itch tickles beneath your skin.

>read paper
 On the front, written in ink:

 I have tried praying, but my thoughts still torment me. No one
 listens!  So I will write. They always say God sees everything, but
 maybe he just doesn't hear everything.

 I don't know what to do. Matteo tells me something strange is going
 on, but he can't tell me what. No, he won't tell me what. He's afraid
 of endangering me. Or he doesn't care. I can't tell with him anymore.

 He doesn't care about anything anymore.

 He says not to trust anyone. I wonder if that applies to him as well.
 He has changed; he never kept secrets before. He says not to trust
 even the father. He says he has changed the most.

 And on the back, written in blood:

 Matteo is dead. And he was right. Everyone has changed.

>save
>evilmonk
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>desecrate corpse
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>eat corpse
 His flesh is soft from being thrown about in the river: like it had
 been tenderized with a mallet. You dig your teeth into the side of his
 stomach. The blood is cool, but it slakes your thirst like never
 before.

>ride horse
 There is nothing more to do, and so you climb back upon the horse, and
 urge her back to Saint Cuthbert's.

 Just as the monastery comes into view, a sound echoes throughout the
 hills. A crisp, clean sound. Rock on rock.

 Mountain Pass
 Still. The wind has all but stopped. Steep, white hills tower on both
 sides, blocking you in. The monastery looms in the north.

>ride horse
 Not wanting to find out what the noise is, you get back on the horse
 and urge her on to the monastery.

 The noise continues to grow. You look up and see the side of the
 mountain sliding down in a massive avalanche. You spur the horse on,
 but she isn't fast enough.

 The roar of the snow is not the last sound you hear. Who knew horses
 could scream?

>undo

 You can't see any such thing.

>kill horse
 Slowly, trying not to alarm her, you bend down and grab the largest
 rock you can pick up. Then, with as much force as you can muster, you
 slam the rock into her head. She looks up at you in a blank stare
 before crashing to the ground.

 The cracking sound is joined another: a more diffuse sound. A rumble.

>hide under horse
 You crouch behind the dead horse and curl yourself into a ball.

 The rumble turns to a roar. Waves of snow begin coasting down the hill
 in an avalanche.

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 Trees are snapped like twigs, joining the slide.

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 It is here.

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 The waves of snow pass over you, but luckily the horse's body shields
 you from the brunt of the impact. Her residual warmth is just enough
 to carry you through to the top of the snow once the avalanche has
 passed.

>eat horse
 You're not that hungry.

>go north
 With the avalanche over and the horse gone, you have no choice but to
 make it back to the monastery on foot.

 You don't know how long it takes. All you know is now the sky has
 clouded over, and drifts of snow make their way down from above.

 with but a few footsteps can be picked out through the rubble leading

 A faint, garbled sound rises from the east.

 Half-a-dozen empty stalls show the plague's influence. As die the
 shepard, so does the flock. The smell winds its way through your
 nostrils, numb though they are. It can be escaped to the path in the
 west or the garden in the northeast. A small ladder leads up to the
 roof of the stables.

 A shrill, bleating noise comes from the northeast.

>go northeast

 Garden
 These gardens used to provide most of the food for the entire
 monastery. Now, none. A few black stalks poke through the snow, their
 appearance always perfectly predicted by the rows they were planted
 in. The wilderness is stronger here: twisted briars overrun the
 garden. The stables lie back to the southwest.

 A hole has been cut through the briars to the north.

 A garbled bleat rises through the hole in the briars.

>save
>evilmonk
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go north
 Bowing your head through the brush, you enter a clearing.

 Clearing
 A small patch of snow surrounded by briars. This used to be part of
 the garden; now nature has reclaimed it. The belltower rises out of
 the briars: a small hint of civilization in the wild.

 The hole through the briars leads back south.

 As you enter the clearing, you see what the bleat was. A lamb, no more
 than a few weeks old, is tied to a branch, struggling frantically. He
 cries out in terror as a pack of wolves encroach from the briars. They
 are hungry and confused. Do they go for the small, easy meat?  Or the
 larger, more difficult meat?

 Just then, a shout from the belltower draws your attention. "Yoohoo,
 father!" You look up to see Drogo waving happily. "You shouldn't have
 come: it's feeding time." -- he shrugs -- "Oh well. Either way,
 they'll get fed."  With that, he disappears down the stairs.

 The alpha swings his head back and forth between you and the lamb. The
 others follow in unison.

 The alpha is the first to strike. He hits your leg, but he is so weak,
 you would barely feel it, if you weren't so weak yourself. A second
 strike to the back of your other leg sends you sprawling. You struggle
 to rise, but the rest of the pack leaps on you, smothering you in a
 blanket of mange and teeth.

 Scrambling frantically, you hurl yourself up the ladder. The alpha
 grabs your heel, but you shake vigorously enough to send him flailing
 off into a snow bank. Soon, the wolves regroup and prowl around the
 base of the stables, eyeing you hungrily.

 Stables (on the roof)
 The smell is even worse up here. Snow weighs on the roof, causing it
 to sink in the middle. Sometimes hay is stored up here in the summer:
 now, the roof barely supports the snow.

 The wolves prowl around the stables, every once in a while attempting
 a little leap up the sides.

>throw lamb
 You toss the lamb into a patch of low briars, cushioning him from the
 ground. Dazed for a moment, the lamb quickly realizes his new
 surroundings and bolts off away from the wolves. The wolves are torn
 between the two of you, but eventually decide on the lamb. You've
 given them enough trouble already.

 A bleat. No, a scream sounds far off in the distance.

 frame supporting a light mattress.

 Cecilia paces back and forth.

 Calefactory
 Positioned directly between the dormitory and your own room, the
 calefactory warms both, although lately it is less than adequate.
 While the calefactory itself is stiflingly hot, its heat stays
 confined. Your brow grows damp: your body, feverish. Slightly melted
 snow creeps in from the cloister to the northwest.

 A red scrawl winds its way around the room.

>read scrawl
 It says:

 I'm sorry, God. Please forgive me. The evil of my brothers and the
 father has been an affront to you. Forgive them. Please.

 Someone's here.

 That is all.

 Wet footsteps sound from behind. "Curious, isn't it?"  It is Ignatius.

 He sidles up beside you and traces the blood with his hand. "He must
 have been sicker than we thought," --he pauses-- "The plague makes
 monsters of us all."

>talk to ignatius
 "What do you mean?" you ask, edging towards the door.

 Ignatius laughs: a cold, dead sound. "You know better than any of us,

 Ignatius circles the room, but he never strays far from the door.

 "I don't know what you're talking about," you reply. He's close. Too

 Ignatius looks you up and down, unblinking.

 You muster a weak, sickly laugh. "Right. Haha."

 All he does is stare.

 except for the west, which leads to the cloister. Although there are
 no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much
 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the

 The vomit marks a trail into Constantin's cell.

 Constantin's Room
 These walls are Constantin's tomb. Slime coats the floor and slides

 The floor is soaked with vomit, making it almost slippery to walk on.

 Constantin lies on his side, vomit oozing from the side of his mouth.
 A set of keys dangles from the belt of his frock, jingling ever so
 slightly.

 Carefully, you drip a little bit of wax into Constantin's exposed ear.
 Soon, it wells out the top before forming a hard plug.

 You gently untangle the keys from his belt. He does not stir.

 The only room at Saint Cuthbert's large enough to hold all the

 Normally, when you are in here the place is alive. Now, the only

 The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is

 The stairs are slippery with something. A particularly poor step sends
 you careening down, your candle getting snuffed out in the process.

 Cellar
 You brace yourself for the hard impact at the bottom, but it never
 comes. Instead, you fall into a soft, uneven mound. It jars your
 bones, but at least nothing breaks. The light from the kitchen barely
 makes it down the stairs: all you see is shadows.

 Just as you begin making your way up the stairs, the sound of

 "Damn!" You hear someone curse from the kitchen. The footsteps grow
 faster as they rush towards the stairs.

>hide
 Where do you want to hide?

 "Come on out, father!" The voice is hoarse and broken. A candle bobs
 down the stairwell.

>hide under bodies
 Bracing yourself for the smell, you worm your way into the pile of
 bodies. The weight is suffocating, as is the smell.

 He searches around for a few moments: it appears your plan is working.

 "Come out!" he demands. "I know you're in here."

>wait
 Time passes. Slowly.

 "Enough games, father" he says, drawing a wickedly curved knife.
 Moving with cold, swift strikes, he begins stabbing into the mound of
 bodies.

>hit him
 You can't see "him" (Constantin) at the moment.

>hit figure
 You wait till he's close before swinging your leg as hard as you can
 into the back of his knee. He crumbles, his head smashing against the
 hard floor.

>kill figure
 You raise your foot and slam it into his head. It gives, but only
 slightly. So you jump. Up and down. Up and down. When you are done, he
 is little more than a smear upon the ground.

 You grin.

 You can't while hiding.

                                Day One












 It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five
 days since I closed the gate.

 Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot
 appeared: when the first bloody cough ensued from the mouth of an
 urchin. To have allowed the sick sanctuary at Saint Cuthbert's would
 only have damned us as well.

 But we were already damned.

 The plague came. And now we suffer.

 Vespers
 (First time players should type ABOUT)
 Release 1 / Serial number 051128 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11

 Six crisp chimes mark Vespers. Your heart flutters for a moment, and
 you place your head in your hands.

 Your Bedroom
 Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems
 smaller of late. With so many of your brothers gone, there has been
 little for you to do but wait. Wait for the spots to appear in this
 tiny, dark room.

 A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the
 west.

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
 from this morning.

 Garden
 These gardens used to provide most of the food for the entire
 monastery. Now, none. A few black stalks poke through the snow, their
 appearance always perfectly predicted by the rows they were planted
 in. The wilderness is stronger here: twisted briars overrun the
 garden. The stables lie back to the southwest.

 A hole has been cut through the briars to the north.

 A garbled bleat rises through the hole in the briars.

>go north
 Bowing your head through the brush, you enter a clearing.

 Clearing
 A small patch of snow surrounded by briars. This used to be part of
 the garden; now nature has reclaimed it. The belltower rises out of
 the briars: a small hint of civilization in the wild.

 The hole through the briars leads back south.

 As you enter the clearing, you see what the bleat was. A lamb, no more
 than a few weeks old, is tied to a branch, struggling frantically. He
 cries out in terror as a pack of wolves encroach from the briars. They
 are hungry and confused. Do they go for the small, easy meat?  Or the
 larger, more difficult meat?

 Just then, a shout from the belltower draws your attention. "Yoohoo,
 father!" You look up to see Drogo waving happily. "You shouldn't have
 come: it's feeding time." -- he shrugs -- "Oh well. Either way,
 they'll get fed."  With that, he disappears down the stairs.

 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
 therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. -- Matthew 10:16

>untie lamb
 Darting quickly, you tear the lamb from the branch and clutch him to
 your chest. His quivering shakes your bones.

 The wolves eye you and the lamb hungrily, uttering low, weak growls.

>throw lamb
 You toss the lamb to the wolves, hoping to divert their attention. You
 don't. One immediately being gobbling up the lamb, but the others set
 their eyes, and their teeth, on you.

 Your own bleats echo the lamb.


     *** You have died ***

 in. The wilderness is stronger here: twisted briars overrun the

 A hole has been cut through the briars to the north.

 The wolves bound in from the north.

>go southwest
 The wolves trample through the garden after you, snow flying up in
 their wake. You pant and your legs burn with exhaustion.

 Stables
 Half-a-dozen empty stalls show the plague's influence. As die the
 shepard, so does the flock. The smell winds its way through your
 nostrils, numb though they are. It can be escaped to the path in the
 west or the garden in the northeast. A small ladder leads up to the
 roof of the stables.

 The wolves are getting closer. The alpha nips at your heels,
 attempting to drag you down.

>go up
 Scrambling frantically, you hurl yourself up the ladder. The alpha
 grabs your heel, but you shake vigorously enough to send him flailing
 off into a snow bank. Soon, the wolves regroup and prowl around the
 base of the stables, eyeing you hungrily.

 Stables (on the roof)
 The smell is even worse up here. Snow weighs on the roof, causing it
 to sink in the middle. Sometimes hay is stored up here in the summer:
 now, the roof barely supports the snow.

 The wolves prowl around the stables, every once in a while attempting
 a little leap up the sides.

>throw lamb
 You toss the lamb into a patch of low briars, cushioning him from the
 ground. Dazed for a moment, the lamb quickly realizes his new
 surroundings and bolts off away from the wolves. The wolves are torn
 between the two of you, but eventually decide on the lamb. You've
 given them enough trouble already.

 A bleat. No, a scream sounds far off in the distance.

>go down
 You descend the ladder, the roof giving a sigh of relief as you do.

 Path
 The light is gentler now. No, not gentler: weaker. Clouds block the
 sun, making it easy to see the stable to the east in a field of white.
 The infirmary lies to the west while the gate is to the south. The
 monastery offers its hollow promises of warmth to the north.

>go north

 Archway
 The last hint of shelter against the outside world. But it is only a
 hint. The wind rushes by like a stream of ice water to the south: only
 the curve of the arch protects you. The warmth, for as much as it can
 be called that, of the monastery awaits to the north and the cold of
 outside to the south.

>go north

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to
 the cloister and south to outside.

 The alms box hangs open, as poor as the people it is meant to help.

>go north
 Before you leave, you close the entrance door lest the snow, or worse,
 get in.

 Cloister
 Clouds close off the sky, blocking the light but not the snow.

 The colonnade is broken to the south by the exit to the hall and to
 the west by the entrance to the refectory. The brothers' dormitory

>go northeast

 Base of the Bell Tower
 Nestled in the northeast corner of the cloister, the bell tower rises
 high: higher than the steeples of the church. Footsteps cut a line in

 northeast.

>go up
 Panting more than a little, you make your way up the stairs to the
 top.

 Bell Tower
 The snow below is dark and broken. Yet all around is pristine. It is

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has

 those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired
 frame supporting a light mattress.

 A small circle of warmth surrounds the fireplace near the door to the
 east.

 Cecilia paces back and forth.

>talk to cecilia
 "Thank Heavens you are here," Cecilia says, embracing you: what is
 that on her back?  "You must hurry, God told me that Constantin has
 been locking the plague victims in the cellar until they die, that is

 himself. He killed Lucca to keep his secret. Go, get the cellar's key

 A chorus of rings sounds from the tower, echoing through the land.
 Five rings. None.

>eat figure
 The blood is warm, delicate. It has a hint of illness, but it still
 soothes the thirst that dries you deep inside.

>search bodies
 You find nothing of interest.

>search figure
 Warily, you lift the cowl from the man's face.

 Ignatius.

>again
 You've already done that.

>get akk
 You can't see any such thing.

>get all
 prybar: Taken.

>go up

 Kitchen
 The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is
 practically empty. Bare tables stand with no crumbs on them, and a
 hatch through the floor leads to the cellar. The refectory lies to the
 north.

 A cutlery rack sits on one of the tables.

 A bare cupboard sits up against the wall.

>close hatch
 You close the hatch.

>lock hatch with key
 A lock means nothing to ghosts.

>go east
 You can go only north, down or out.

>go north

 Refectory
 The only room at Saint Cuthbert's large enough to hold all the
 brothers, except for the church, the refectory seems immense.
 Normally, when you are in here the place is alive. Now, the only
 movement is that of drafts spinning between the tables and out to the
 cloister in the east. Row upon row of deserted seats stand testament
 to the damage inflicted by the plague. The kitchen lies to the south.

>go east

 Cloister
 Clouds close off the sky, blocking the light but not the snow.

 The colonnade is broken to the south by the exit to the hall and to
 the west by the entrance to the refectory. The brothers' dormitory
 lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the
 belltower in the northeast.

 The church rolls and laughs to the north, pointing Her sharp fingers
 in a perpetual mock at God.

>go east

 Dormitory
 Dozens of openings line the hall, each leading to a separate cell,
 except for the west, which leads to the cloister. Although there are
 no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much
 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the
 northeast, Constantin's is to the southeast, and Lucca's to the
 southwest.

>se

 Constantin's Room
 These walls are Constantin's tomb. Slime coats the floor and slides
 from the walls. The stench is trapped, harsh. It can be escaped to the
 northwest.

 Constantin's corpse sinks into his bed.

>eat constantin
 Constantin's flesh is soft and squishy. The plague has done much. You
 barely have to chew. It simply slides down your throat and into your
 belly.

 A gust of wind slices across your ears. You shiver.

>get corpse
 You can't see any such thing.

>get constantin
 He is too heavy.

>go east

 out.

>go northeast

 Drogo's Room
 He seems to have made himself right at home. The room smells of
 animals and sweat; scratches adorn the bed and lead out the door to
 the southwest.

>examine scratches
 Scratches line the posts. Some from claws, some from metal.

>bed
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Ignatius's Room
 Ignatius's room does not smell as strongly as the others. A bed is
 pushed up against one wall, opposite the door to the south.

>go south

 Whispers dance in your ears. Growing. Fading.

 Matteo's Room
 So empty. So, so empty. North leads out.

 One of the flagstones is tinted with blood.

>save
>evilmonk
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>pry flagstone
 What do you want to pry the flagstone with?

>prybar
 Fitting the bar between the cracks in the flooring, you pry the
 flagstone up. It comes out easily.

 Where it lay, in a slight hollow in the soil, are a few wrinkled
 sheets of paper.

>go north
 You're not leaving until you've read the papers that two people died
 for.

 It does not light. The dampness spoils everything here.

>go north

 Church (in the pews)
 The pews stumble over eachother, desperately crawling for the chancel
 in the north. The light outside finds no entrance: the Saints will not
 permit it. The frescoes are all but lost in the darkness above.

 Matteo welcomes you to the chancel from his perch on the cross. His
 perpetual grin consumes his face and blood drips into his eyes from
 the crown of thorns.

 A rank chamberpot sits before the chancel, human filth caking its
 sides.

 The Saints scream from their glass cages. They would run, but they are
 trapped.

>examine crown
 Matteo grins.  It spreads throughout the church.

>go north

 Church (on the chancel)
 God, to think of all the time you wasted up here. The blind leading

 of the church lies to the south; it's not as funny of a joke.

 Matteo welcomes you to the chancel from his perch on the cross. His
 perpetual grin consumes his face and blood drips into his eyes from

 Wormholes, rotted flesh, and maggots are all that remain on Saint

 The lectern has crumbled away. The weight of the Bible is crushing to
 the wicked.

 The Saints scream from their glass cages. They would run, but they are
 trapped.

 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and

 Cold, heavy light slides in through the window and creeps along the

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the

 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for
 those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired
 frame supporting a light mattress.

 A small circle of warmth surrounds the fireplace near the door to the

 Cecilia paces back and forth.

 Archway
 The last hint of shelter against the outside world. But it is only a

 the curve of the arch protects you. The warmth, for as much as it can

 outside to the south.

>go west
 You can go only north, south, in or out.

 Darkness begins to creep across the sky from atop the infirmary in the
 west. The last rays of light expose the stables to the east and the

 promises of shelter.

>go south

 Gate
 Broken stone and snow are all that remain here. A north-south path
 with but a few footsteps can be picked out through the rubble leading
 from the monastery towards Rovato.

 A tangled mass of corpses lines the southern side of the former gate.

 Outside the Infirmary
 The infirmary stands well away from the rest of the monastery. Little
 good it has done, though. The plague still seeped its way in. A
 rickety door leads into the infirmary, and a well-worn path leads to
 the cemetery in the northwest and back to the main path in the east.

>go northwest

 Cemetery
 The wind whips its way through the tombstones, whistling a harsh tune.
 The air is crisp and clean, the smell of corpses is nowhere to be
 found. In a section off from the established cemetary, row upon row of
 makeshift crosses stand: plague victims. The path winds its way back
 to the infirmary in the southeast.

>break crosses

 Dozens of bodies line the wall: the villagers of Rovato.

 nonetheless.

                                Day One












 It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five
 days since I closed the gate.

 Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot
 appeared: when the first bloody cough ensued from the mouth of an
 urchin. To have allowed the sick sanctuary at Saint Cuthbert's would
 only have damned us as well.

 But we were already damned.

 The plague came. And now we suffer.

 Six crisp chimes mark Vespers. Your heart flutters for a moment, and
 you place your head in your hands.

 Your Bedroom
 Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems
 smaller of late. With so many of your brothers gone, there has been
 little for you to do but wait. Wait for the spots to appear in this
 tiny, dark room.

 A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
 from this morning.

      General Tips









 There are no new verbs necessary to complete the game. However, one
 standard library verb has had its grammar considerably altered (and
 given the subject matter of the game, it shouldn't be too hard to
 guess which one).

 Additionally, conversation is handled a little differently. One can
 seems most pertinent at the time (you can TALK TO them several times
 in a row to carry on the conversation). Alternatively, if that doesn't
 quench your thirst for knowledge, you can ASK, TELL, or TALK TO an NPC
 avoid the headaches associated with asking someone about something but
 not telling them about it first.

 A WALKTHRU command is included if the hints aren't to your liking.
 Also, if you have trouble remembering the brothers or saints, type
 BROTHERS or SAINTS.

 Finally, if the boxed quotes bother you, you can get them to print
 QUOTES OFF at any time.  Type QUOTES ON to get things back to default.

 Cellar
 You can make out little. Some light streams in down the stairs, but it
 is not enough. The floor is covered in something lumpy and deep.

 "Damn!" You hear someone curse from the kitchen. The footsteps grow
 faster as they rush towards the stairs.

                                Day One












 It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five
 days since I closed the gate.

 Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot
 appeared: when the first bloody cough ensued from the mouth of an
 urchin. To have allowed the sick sanctuary at Saint Cuthbert's would
 only have damned us as well.

 But we were already damned.

 The plague came. And now we suffer.

 Vespers
 (First time players should type ABOUT)
 Release 1 / Serial number 051128 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11

 Six crisp chimes mark Vespers. Your heart flutters for a moment, and
 you place your head in your hands.

 Your Bedroom
 Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems
 smaller of late. With so many of your brothers gone, there has been
 little for you to do but wait. Wait for the spots to appear in this
 tiny, dark room.

 A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the
 west.

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
 from this morning.

>go west
 Pulling your frock tightly about you, you sigh and exit to the hall.

 Entrance Hall
 As cold as your room is, this hall is even colder. The stone walls
 dance and glisten with dampness. The warmth of your room awaits to the
 east, and the cold of the outside world through a heavy door to the
 south. Moonlight streams in from the cloister to the north, and a
 flimsy door secures the locutory to the west.

 The alms box hangs closed beside the door.

>go north
 Bracing yourself for the cold, you lower your hood and exit to the
 cloister.

 Cloister
 In the warmer months, Brother Matteo maintains a beautiful garden in
 the cloister. Now there is nothing but a few dead vines sticking out
 from beneath a blanket of snow. Still, it has a calm dignity: the wind
 finds no entrance here. The colonnade is broken to the south by the
 exit to the hall and to the west by the entrance to the refectory. The
 brothers' dormitory lies to the east, between the calefactory in the
 southeast and the belltower in the northeast.

 The church commands from the north, its spires reaching up to Heaven.

 Brother Lucca, face flushed and cheeks wet, storms out from the bell
 tower and off to the dormitory in the east, meeting your eyes for only
 a moment.

 "Are you alright, Brother?" you ask, receiving no response.

>go north

 Church (in the pews)
 Since you relegated the brothers to pray on their own, except for
 Mass, the church has been all but empty. Rows of pews part down the
 centre, ushering you up to the chancel in the north opposite the
 cloister in the south. The ceiling towers above you, its frescoes dim
 in the candlelight.

 Towering above all else is a massive wooden cross. It is awesome.

 The font glows warmly in the candlelight, not a ripple on its water's
 surface.

 The Saints smile cheerfully down upon you from their colorful windows.

 Brother Ignatius sits in one of the pews near the front, staring
 intently at the candles.

>talk to him
 "How are you, Ignatius?" you ask, laying your hand on his shoulder.

 He startles, whirling around, his bad eye twitching and shuddering.
 "Oh, father. You spooked me." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry, what did
 you ask."

 Church (in the pews)
 Cedar pews line the path from the chancel in the north to the cloister
 to the south, their surfaces cold. The ceiling towers above you, its
 frescoes dim in the candlelight.

 The font glows warmly in the candlelight, not a ripple on its water's

 Brother Ignatius sits in one of the pews near the front, staring

 A loud crackle splits the sound of wind. Lightning. Stone tumbles in
 the distance.

 In the warmer months, Brother Matteo maintains a beautiful garden in
 the cloister. Now there is nothing but a few dead vines sticking out
 from beneath a blanket of snow. Still, it has a calm dignity: the wind
 finds no entrance here. The colonnade is broken to the south by the

 The church commands from the north, its spires reaching up to Heaven.

>go west

 Refectory
 The only room at Saint Cuthbert's large enough to hold all the
 brothers, except for the church, the refectory seems immense.
 Normally, when you are in here the place is alive. Now, the only
 movement is that of drafts spinning between the tables and out to the
 cloister in the east. Row upon row of deserted seats stand testament
 to the damage inflicted by the plague. The kitchen lies to the south.

 Brother Drogo sits at one of the tables, scratching furiously at its
 hard surface.

 Whispers dance in your ears. Growing. Fading.

 "Oh, I am feeling quite alright. In fact, I feel like a bird who

 Dormitory
 Dozens of openings line the hall, each leading to a separate cell,
 except for the west, which leads to the cloister. Although there are
 no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much
 privacy as possible. Brother Matteo's chamber is to the south,
 Ignatius's to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the
 northeast, Constantin's is to the southeast, and Lucca's to the
 southwest.

 A scraping sound comes from Constantin's cell, forming an eerie melody
 with the sobs from Matteo's.

 Constantin's Room
 Constantin is one of the few brothers with anything in his room
 besides a bed. A few tools lay next to the door in the northwest;
 remnants of his life as a blacksmith. A smell lingers here: a sour
 smell.

 Brother Constantin sits on the bed, a young hare dangling from his
 hand. His knife moves swiftly.

 Lucca scrabbles frantically at the ground, his blood staining the

 "Why do you dig, Lucca?" you ask.

 "Matteo is hiding something. I just know it's under here."

 Entrance Hall
 There is little to be seen here but the locutory door to the west and
 your room to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to

 The alms box hangs closed beside the door.

 "Please. It is so cold."

 A wolf howls in the distance. A hungry, plaintive sound.

>open gate
 You can't see any such thing.

>go south
 Pushing the bar out of the way, you open the door, allowing a frail
 figure and a drift of snow to spill into the hall.

 Before you, fingers bloody and face as pale as the snow it lies in, is
 a young woman. Her clothing is little more than tatters with stains of
 blood from where her hands were resting.

 "Please," she gasps, raising herself up for a moment. "I am so cold."
 With that, she returns her face to the icy ground.

 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his
 sanctuary. -- Psalms 96:6

>take girl
 With more than a little trouble, you hoist the girl into your arms.
 Your knees feel as though they might buckle but hold for now.

>go west
 (opening the door to the locutory)
 You turn sideways and slide into the locutory, careful not to catch
 the young woman's head on the frame.

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has
 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for
 those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired
 frame supporting a light mattress.

 Near the door to the east is a fireplace, its embers cold for days.

>put girl in bed
 You lay the young girl on the bed, and she immediately relaxes. Her
 eyes remain closed but no longer twitch with discomfort.

 get in.

 Your Bedroom
 The room is small; the same as all the others. But it seems smaller of
 late. The hall extends to the west.

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself

 from this morning.

 You drape your bedding over the girl, and she seems to calm down a

 After much coaxing, you finally get the wet logs to ignite. The flame
 is weak, but it will do.

 The warmth is finally enough for her to stir.

 "Food,"  she says. "Please."

 With that, she passes back into slumber.

 Half of the wood he burns in the fire. He also warms himself and says,

 Locutory
 The locutory used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the
 tales of visiting brothers, but since the gate was closed, no one has
 been in here but you. A small bed is pushed up against the wall for
 those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired
 frame supporting a light mattress.

 A small circle of warmth surrounds the fireplace near the door to the
 east.

 The girl sleeps upon the bed, turning fitfully every now and then.

>ask girl about plague
 She sleeps; she cannot hear.

>load vespers
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>restore
>cf24

 Kitchen
 The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is
 practically empty. Bare tables stand with no crumbs on them, and a
 hatch through the floor leads to the cellar. The refectory lies to the
 north.

 A cutlery rack sits on one of the tables.

 A bare cupboard sits up against the wall.

 Matteo's Room
 So empty. So, so empty. North leads out.

 One of the flagstones is tinted with blood.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a prybar
   some keys
   Lucca's paper
   a Cecilia's eyes
   Drogo's eyes
   a hare
   Matteo's note
   Ignatius's eye
   Matteo's eyes
   Lucca's eyes
   Constantin's eyes
   a coin
   your tinderbox
   your candle
   your frock (being worn)

>quotes off
 Box quotes are now off.

>pry flagstone with bar
 Fitting the bar between the cracks in the flooring, you pry the
 flagstone up. It comes out easily.

 Where it lay, in a slight hollow in the soil, are a few wrinkled
 sheets of paper.

                                Day One








>quit




 It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five
 days since I closed the gate.

 Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot
 appeared: when the first bloody cough ensued from the mouth of an
 urchin. To have allowed the sick sanctuary at Saint Cuthbert's would
 only have damned us as well.

 But we were already damned.

 The plague came. And now we suffer.

 Vespers
 (First time players should type ABOUT)
 Release 1 / Serial number 051128 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11

 Six crisp chimes mark Vespers. Your heart flutters for a moment, and
 you place your head in your hands.

 Your Bedroom
 Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems
 smaller of late. With so many of your brothers gone, there has been
 little for you to do but wait. Wait for the spots to appear in this
 tiny, dark room.

 A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the
 west.

 Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
 up proudly.

 Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
 from this morning.

>quit
 Are you sure you want to quit?
>y
