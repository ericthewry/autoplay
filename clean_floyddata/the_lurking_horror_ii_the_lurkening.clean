 across campus, you finally return to...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Dorm Room</span>
 Apparently your roommate moved out today.  The room looks pretty bare
 with only your stuff left in it - not that you had much to begin with.
 The only decorations that remain are a few of your posters hanging on
 the walls.

 You hear loud noises coming from the hallway to the south.  It sounds
 like your hallmates have begun celebrating the end of the academic
 year.

 You can see your bed and your desk (on which are a medicine bottle and
 a note) here.

>read note

 It's from your roommate.  "Good luck on your final!  I've left you the
 last of my study pills.  I promise you they are perfectly safe,
 all-natural, and organic - although they may not work exactly like you
 expect."

 Your dorm room looks half empty now that your roommate has left for
 the summer.  The only decorations left are a few of your posters
 hanging on the walls.  You can hear the sounds of a loud party in the
 hallway to the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alchemy Basement</span>
 Your vision clears, and you're back in the basement of the Alchemy
 building.

 This is one of your favorite haunts on the G.U.E. campus. It's a great
 place to curl up with a book—but you really don't have time for that
 right now.

 There's a stairway here that leads up to the Department of Alchemy
 lobby, and a well-lit tunnel leads north.

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this
 time.

>inventory

 You are carrying nothing.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Alchemy Lobby</span>
 The Alchemy building feels small and defenseless in the face of the
 wild thunderstorm outside. Rain and howling wind pound at the doors to
 the north and east. A stairway leads down to the basement (and the
 tunnels).

 This lobby is especially creepy because there's an informative poster
 depicting an Elder Horror hanging on the wall.

>examine poster

 Above the picture of the Elder Horror are the words "IF YOU SEE
 SOMETHING, SAY RAENFIDHRE." Smaller text below explains: "Elder
 Horrors are a nuisance—but you don't have to let them inconvenience
 you. The incantation 'Raenfidhre' sends Elder Horrors right back where
 they came from. (Don't ask!) When you run into an Elder Horror, just
 say 'Raenfidhre' and watch it disappear."

 For years, students of the arcane arts struggled to find some logic or
 significance in the forms of these incantations. Eventually the
 experts reached the consensus that they're just random stupid words.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Construction Site</span>
 Torrents of rain lash at the earth in blind fury.

 This is the future site of the Gentry Antiquarian Center. Right now
 it's a rectangular pit with concrete walls.

 The Alchemy building is south. Another building—a despicable
 building—is further north.

>examine pit

 The cyclopean walls of the unfinished Gentry Center are slick with
 rain, and its muddy basement floor is pockmarked with oily puddles.

 Floating in one puddle is a manila envelope.

>take envelope

 There's no safe way to reach the envelope from up here.

>examine envelope

 Hard to tell from way over here, but it looks like campus mail.

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside Department of Sorcery</span>
 You break out in gooseflesh as you contemplate the eldritch
 experiments performed within these walls on a daily basis. You don't
 like visiting this place unless you have to. It even smells
 pretentious.

 The department head's office is down the hall to the east. The way
 back outside is west.

 The only person here tonight is a grad student whom you kind of know.

>examine student

 He's a sorcery student you've seen around campus, usually sitting down
 in a secluded study space you were hoping to use.

 He squints at you. "What are you doing here?"

 "None of your beeswax," you snap back. "What are <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> doing
 here?"

 He curls his lip into an odious sneer. "The department head asked me
 to help with some research, so I'm on my way to his office."

 "Well, great for you," you respond, facetiously.

>go east

 You try to walk past the sorcery student, but he blocks your path:
 "The department head doesn't need another research
 assistant—especially not from the Department of Alchemy. He asked for
 me specifically."

 You stare at each other like a pair of housecats that have just been
 introduced.

>hit student

 Really? Resorting to brute force already?

>yes

 That was a rhetorical question.

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Typical Tunnel</span>
 Before you enrolled at G.U.E. Tech, you had this romantic idea that
 the tunnels would all be dingy, claustrophobic, and dangerous. But
 these tunnels—the tunnels that most people see—are really more like
 hallways with pipes.

 This hallway and its pipes lead north and south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eerie Corner</span>
 You've reached a bend in the tunnel where the lights don't quite
 reach. You can continue east or south.

 But you can't just stand around, because an Elder Horror is flitting
 through the shadows here, gibbering in little shrieks.

>raenfidhre

 You utter the incantation, the eldritch puissance of its awful
 phonemes flowing with hideous sweetness over your tongue. The Elder
 Horror howls in response, as if to drown out your spell with its
 ululating tongues—but it is no use.

 A hole opens in space, and the Elder Horror is dragged by unknown
 forces back to its native dimension.

 Whatever the thing was holding falls to your feet: Looks like
 somebody's lecture notes.

 You hear a hissing noise as a portion of the ambient atmosphere is
 sucked away before the aperture closes itself.

 You can use the abbreviation "R" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>read notes

 A few pages of sparsely annotated Powerpoint slides. Is there anything
 good in here?

 The annotator has indicated one slide with a series of exclamation
 marks: It alludes to the incantation "Jilxube," and describes its
 applications as "gross."

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Ladder</span>
 In the middle of this east-west strip of tunnel is an open grate. In
 the grate is a ladder. The ladder leads down to the sub-basement
 level.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Well-Lit Corner</span>
 The passage from the west turns here, at the top of a gentle slope
 leading south. This would be a great place to race office chairs, if
 other concerns weren't taking precedence.

 A hacker is leaning against the wall here, taking a break from
 hacking.

>examine hacker

 You can tell she's an accomplished hacker from the unrealistically
 heavy key ring hanging from her belt loop. Anyone who has that many
 keys isn't supposed to have all of them.

 You wave to each other, and are about to exchange pleasantries when a
 massive peal of thunder from above shakes the tunnels. The lights go
 out.

 The lights come back on. The two of you grimace.

 "Hey," says the hacker. "If the lights ever go out for real, I know a
 spell that for seeing in the dark. It's 'kulehrif.' You say it just
 like that."

 You nod. "Thanks. I probably should have known that already."

 "It's okay. At least you only have to learn something for the first
 time once."

 "That is <span class="floydstyle em">so true,</span>" you say.

>jilxube

 You struggle to pronounce the abhorrent incantation properly. When you
 finally get it right, a huge mass of slime appears out of nowhere,
 draping its dreadful viscousness all over everything in the immediate
 area.

 The hacker grimaces and takes a few steps back. "Nice trick," she
 says. "Are you planning on cleaning that up?"

 "I'm really in a hurry at the moment," you tell her, and although it's
 the truth you don't think she's convinced.

 You can use the abbreviation "J" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic

 do you think you're doing?" he wails.

 You raise your palms in mock confusion. "What, is the sorcery building
 full of slime? I don't notice any difference!"

 You grin madly, having delivered the ultimate slam upon your rival. He
 only grits his teeth in response.

 You can use the abbreviation "J" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time

 The names of the vandals are lost to campus history. All that we know
 is: Someone wrote something on a wall; then, before the message could
 be summarily painted over, someone else prepended an additional word.
 Now, and since time immemorial, the wall reads:

 <span class="floydstyle em">NEVER</span>
 GIVE
  UP

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ritual Chamber</span>
 It groans sluggishly. It shrugs its unthinkable head—No. That is not
 a
 head.

 The whitish, loathsome, incomprehensible thing that oozes before you
 is Ynf-Okh-Omm, the Eldest Horror. It is sleeping, for now. Soon (very
 soon), it will awaken, and this helpless universe will suffer the
 consequences.

 The way out is east.

>raenfidhre

 You utter the incantation, the eldritch puissance of its awful
 phonemes flowing with hideous sweetness over your tongue.

 A crackle of eldritch power washes over the sleeping hulk, and your
 spell falls flat. How did it do that? Where is it getting this energy?

 Ynf-Okh-Omm stirs. The Eldest Horror rolls over. Some hideous aspect
 of its body—an eye?—a mouth?—opens, and you are the first to be
 devoured.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Ladder</span>
 In the middle of this east-west strip of tunnel is an open grate. In
 the grate is a ladder. The ladder leads down to the sub-basement
 level.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Well-Lit Corner</span>
 The passage from the west turns here, at the top of a gentle slope
 leading south. This would be a great place to race office chairs, if
 other concerns weren't taking precedence.

 A hacker is leaning against the wall here, taking a break from
 hacking.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graffito</span>
 At this intersection, the tunnels go north, south—and west, to the
 chamber of your ill-advised project.

 An old graffito is on the east wall.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Odd Corner</span>
 The tunnel turns from north to west here.

 You take another step and slip on a piece of paper.

>examine paper

 The paper has disappeared—but you <span class="floydstyle em">know</span> you slipped on
 something.

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alchemy Basement</span>
 Your vision clears, and you're back in the basement of the Alchemy
 building.

 This is one of your favorite haunts on the G.U.E. campus. It's a great
 place to curl up with a book—but you really don't have time for that
 right now.

 There's a stairway here that leads up to the Department of Alchemy
 lobby, and a well-lit tunnel leads north.

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this
 time.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Typical Tunnel</span>
 Before you enrolled at G.U.E. Tech, you had this romantic idea that
 the tunnels would all be dingy, claustrophobic, and dangerous. But
 these tunnels—the tunnels that most people see—are really more like
 hallways with pipes.

 This hallway and its pipes lead north and south.

>examine pipes

 The pipes don't even lead to or from anywhere in particular. They're
 all the same, all along this level of the tunnels.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eerie Corner</span>
 You've reached a bend in the tunnel where the lights don't quite
 reach. You can continue east or south.

 But you can't just stand around, because an Elder Horror is flitting
 through the shadows here, gibbering in little shrieks.

>raenfidhre

 You utter the incantation, the eldritch puissance of its awful
 phonemes flowing with hideous sweetness over your tongue. The Elder
 Horror howls in response, as if to drown out your spell with its
 ululating tongues—but it is no use.

 A hole opens in space, and the Elder Horror is dragged by unknown
 forces back to its native dimension.

 Whatever the thing was holding falls to your feet: Looks like
 somebody's lecture notes.

 You hear a hissing noise as a portion of the ambient atmosphere is
 sucked away before the aperture closes itself.

 You can use the abbreviation "R" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Ladder</span>
 In the middle of this east-west strip of tunnel is an open grate. In
 the grate is a ladder. The ladder leads down to the sub-basement
 level.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bottom of Ladder</span>
 These are not the fun tunnels that they show you on campus tours.
 These are the old tunnels. The evil tunnels.

 Ancient pipes clank and hiss, and beneath these noises—you wonder if
 you're imagining—the sound of something skittering behind you.

 The ladder here goes up to the main basement level. Tunnels lead east,
 south, and west.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Confusing Tunnel</span>
 Oh dear. This is one of <span class="floydstyle em">those</span> places.

 The geometry in here is incorrect. All the surfaces are inside-out.
 The physical laws of some other dimension must be impinging on this
 space from somewhere outside space.

 Dang.

>jilxube

 You struggle to pronounce the abhorrent incantation properly. When you
 finally get it right, a huge mass of slime appears out of nowhere,
 draping its dreadful viscousness all over everything in the immediate
 area.

 You can use the abbreviation "J" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go east

 You try to move in that direction, but in this particular context the
 idea of "direction" doesn't really apply, which makes it hard to get
 anywhere.

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 This damp tunnel looks like it used to be a sewer, or a pneumatic

 The way back is east. The tunnel continues south, beyond a
 waterfall-like curtain of slime.

>go south

 You reach tentatively at the curtain of slime, and the acrid substance
 burns your hand. Apparently walking through this stuff wouldn't just
 be disgusting; it could be deadly.

 So how do you get it to stop flowing?

>ebuxlij

 That verb doesn't work in this story. Sorry.

 You successfully cast the spell, but the slime that you conjure only
 adds to the curtain of slime that's already flowing down across the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Alchemy Lobby</span>
 The Alchemy building feels small and defenseless in the face of the
 wild thunderstorm outside. Rain and howling wind pound at the doors to
 the north and east. A stairway leads down to the basement (and the
 tunnels).

 This lobby is especially creepy because there's an informative poster
 depicting an Elder Horror hanging on the wall.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Construction Site</span>
 Torrents of rain lash at the earth in blind fury.

 This is the future site of the Gentry Antiquarian Center. Right now
 it's a rectangular pit with concrete walls.

 The Alchemy building is south. Another building—a despicable
 building—is further north.

>jilxube

 You struggle to pronounce the abhorrent incantation properly. When you
 finally get it right, a huge mass of slime appears out of nowhere.

 The slime, driven by an invisible and irresistible impulse, flows into
 the subterranean walls of the construction site, filling the pit until
 the level of the ghastly liquid is even with the surrounding earth. A
 manila envelope floats up to glide lazily over the surface.

 An idea creeps over your brain that the slime may have done all this
 <span class="floydstyle em">because you wanted it to</span>, and you shudder.

 You can use the abbreviation "J" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time

 You cast the spell again, and more repulsive slime flows into this

 the
 construction pit. The level of the slime doesn't rise an inch. This is
 all disturbingly convenient.

 Ultimate Frisbee players—but what with the rain, and the lightning,
 there's nobody here right now.

 To the west is the Department of Alchemy. East is the Department of
 Necromancy. North is the Department of Linguistics.

 The Alchemy building feels small and defenseless in the face of the
 wild thunderstorm outside. Rain and howling wind pound at the doors to
 the north and east. A stairway leads down to the basement (and the
 tunnels).

 This lobby is especially creepy because there's an informative poster
 depicting an Elder Horror hanging on the wall.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 Normally, this grassy courtyard is a favorite spot for joggers and
 Ultimate Frisbee players—but what with the rain, and the lightning,
 there's nobody here right now.

 To the west is the Department of Alchemy. East is the Department of
 Necromancy. North is the Department of Linguistics.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Necromancy Hallway</span>
 You seem to be in a hallway—but it's too dark to see which way it
 leads, what it leads to, or what else is in here with you. The only
 thing you can see is the way outside, to the west.

>kulehrif

 You mutter the incantation, and a greenish haze swims in front of your
 eyes. Your knees buckle, and for a giddy moment you feel as though you
 may barf.

 But when you regain your faculties, you notice your vision has
 improved, and the room does not seem so dark now:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Necromancy Hallway</span>
 Looks like there are no necromancy students here tonight, which is
 just as well.

 This hallway leads north and west.

 And there's a dead cockroach on the floor here! Gross.

 You can use the abbreviation "K" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Necromancy Lab</span>
 Lightning flashes, your hair stands on end, and then a hideous peal of
 thunder shakes the building.

 There are about a dozen workstations here for students to practice
 their necromantic arts upon, but nobody's here right now.

 There is, however, a scrap of paper on the floor.

>read paper

 The top of the page indicates that these are notes from an intro-level
 Necromancy class. The student has scribbled and crossed out a long
 list of incantations. The final attempt, "HTERWERBSET," has been
 circled triumphantly.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Necromancy Hallway</span>
 There are no necromancy students here tonight. The place is as quiet
 as the—well, it's quiet.

 This hallway leads north and west.

 That dead bug is still here. Upsetting.

>hterwerbset

 You whisper the incantation, and feel a daemoniac power crystallize in
 the air, its vertices aligned by the awful syllables as they leave
 your lips.

 The spell's angles align with something invisible and dreadful, and
 the roach on the floor springs to life. It makes a grateful hissing
 noise before crawling speedily away.

 You can use the abbreviation "H" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time

 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 There's not much here—the Linguistics department was organized with a

 The way out is south.

>examine grimoire

 You reach out to inspect the grimoire. Your hand runs into something.
 Something squishy and invisible.

 You hold still for a second: You think you can hear it breathing.

>jilxube

 You struggle to pronounce the abhorrent incantation properly. When you
 finally get it right, a huge mass of slime appears out of nowhere,
 draping its dreadful viscousness all over everything in the immediate
 area.

 You can use the abbreviation "J" the next time you want to cast this

 The forboding building to the east houses the Department of Sorcery,

 chance. The rest of the campus is south from here.

 Thunder rumbles nearby.

 You break out in gooseflesh as you contemplate the eldritch

 pretentious.

 The department head's office is down the hall to the east. The way
 back outside is west.

 The only person here tonight is a grad student whom you kind of know.

>talk to student

 He's a sorcery student you've seen around campus, usually sitting down
 in a secluded study space you were hoping to use.

 He squints at you. "What are you doing here?"

 "None of your beeswax," you snap back. "What are <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> doing

 He curls his lip into an odious sneer. "The department head asked me
 to help with some research, so I'm on my way to his office."

 "Well, great for you," you respond, facetiously.

 the subterranean walls of the construction site, filling the pit until
 the level of the ghastly liquid is even with the surrounding earth. A
 manila envelope floats up to glide lazily over the surface.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eerie Corner</span>

 A hacker is leaning against the wall here, taking a break from
 hacking.

>talk to hacker

 You can tell she's an accomplished hacker from the unrealistically
 heavy key ring hanging from her belt loop. Anyone who has that many
 keys isn't supposed to have all of them.

 You wave to each other, and are about to exchange pleasantries when a
 massive peal of thunder from above shakes the tunnels. The lights go
 out.

 The lights come back on. The two of you grimace.

 "Hey," says the hacker. "If the lights ever go out for real, I know a
 spell that for seeing in the dark. It's 'kulehrif.' You say it just
 like that."

 You nod. "Thanks. I probably should have known that already."

 "It's okay. At least you only have to learn something for the first

 "That is <span class="floydstyle em">so true,</span>" you say.

 Ancient pipes clank and hiss, and beneath these noises—you wonder if

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Power Station</span>
 Thrumming all around you are hulks of decrepit machinery, sagging
 under the weight of decades, struggling to supply power to the
 university above. And twisting through their cables are the insidious
 tentacles of Ynf-Okh-Omm, worming their way through the ceiling from
 its chamber above. The Eldest Horror is leeching power from G.U.E.'s
 electrical system! This is your fault!

 The tunnels continue north and south.

 And you can definitely hear something slithering squamously nearby.

>raenfidhre

 You utter the incantation, the eldritch puissance of its awful
 phonemes flowing with hideous sweetness over your tongue. You hear
 something squeal in shock and inhuman pain. Then you hear a sharp
 squelching noise.

 that?

 You can use the abbreviation "R" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>kulehrif

 You mutter the incantation, and a greenish haze swims in front of your

 may barf.

 But when you regain your faculties, you notice your vision has

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dim Intersection</span>

 There is a statuette sitting on the floor here.

 You can use the abbreviation "K" the next time you want to cast this

>examine statuette

 The statuette, carved in an oddly soft bluish substance, depicts a
 creature you dimly recognize as appearing in certain dreams from which
 you awoke babbling and covered in sweat. The base of the piece is
 carved with an inscription in an alien tongue that you happened to
 learn in one of those Humanities classes that they made you take. It
 says: "Yzawnzag."

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has

 Your vision clears, and you're back in the basement of the Alchemy
 building.

 This is one of your favorite haunts on the G.U.E. campus. It's a great
 place to curl up with a book—but you really don't have time for that
 right now.

 There's a stairway here that leads up to the Department of Alchemy
 lobby, and a well-lit tunnel leads north.

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this
 time.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Alchemy Lobby</span>
 The Alchemy building feels small and defenseless in the face of the
 wild thunderstorm outside. Rain and howling wind pound at the doors to
 the north and east. A stairway leads down to the basement (and the
 tunnels).

 This lobby is especially creepy because there's an informative poster
 depicting an Elder Horror hanging on the wall.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 Normally, this grassy courtyard is a favorite spot for joggers and
 Ultimate Frisbee players—but what with the rain, and the lightning,
 there's nobody here right now.

 To the west is the Department of Alchemy. East is the Department of
 Necromancy. North is the Department of Linguistics.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Linguistics</span>
 There's not much here—the Linguistics department was organized with a
 minimalist philosophy in mind. A likely-looking (and heavy-looking)
 grimoire rests on a pedestal in an alcove.

 The way out is south.

>yzawnzag

 As you pronounce the incantation, you feel your mind curl inward as if
 to defend itself. You think, or you hope, that your willpower has
 increased.

 You can use the abbreviation "Y" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>read grimoire

 You reach out to inspect the grimoire. Your hand runs into something.
 Something squishy and invisible.

 You hold still for a second: You think you can hear it breathing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Construction Site</span>
 Torrents of rain lash at the earth in blind fury.

 This is the future site of the Gentry Antiquarian Center. Right now
 it's a rectangular pit with concrete walls.

 The Alchemy building is south. Another building—a despicable
 building—is further north.

>jilxube

 You struggle to pronounce the abhorrent incantation properly. When you
 finally get it right, a huge mass of slime appears out of nowhere.

 The slime, driven by an invisible and irresistible impulse, flows into
 the subterranean walls of the construction site, filling the pit until
 the level of the ghastly liquid is even with the surrounding earth. A
 manila envelope floats up to glide lazily over the surface.

 An idea creeps over your brain that the slime may have done all this
 <span class="floydstyle em">because you wanted it to</span>, and you shudder.

 You can use the abbreviation "J" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 You cast the spell again, and more repulsive slime flows into this

 the
 construction pit. The level of the slime doesn't rise an inch. This is
 all disturbingly convenient.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Department of Sorcery</span>
 The forboding building to the east houses the Department of Sorcery,
 which frequently competes with the Alchemy department for funding and
 is always reserving the best classrooms before Alchemy can get a
 chance. The rest of the campus is south from here.

 Thunder rumbles nearby.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside Department of Sorcery</span>
 You break out in gooseflesh as you contemplate the eldritch
 experiments performed within these walls on a daily basis. You don't
 like visiting this place unless you have to. It even smells
 pretentious.

 The department head's office is down the hall to the east. The way
 back outside is west.

 The only person here tonight is a grad student whom you kind of know.

>go east

 You try to walk past the sorcery student, but he blocks your path:
 "The department head doesn't need another research
 assistant—especially not from the Department of Alchemy. He asked for
 me specifically."

 You stare at each other like a pair of housecats that have just been
 introduced.

>yzawnzag

 You cast the hypnosis-resistance spell again, and steel your mind even
 more against external influence (possibly to the point of overdoing
 it).

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has

 place to curl up with a book—but you really don't have time for that

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this
 time.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Typical Tunnel</span>
 Before you enrolled at G.U.E. Tech, you had this romantic idea that
 the tunnels would all be dingy, claustrophobic, and dangerous. But
 these tunnels—the tunnels that most people see—are really more like
 hallways with pipes.

 This hallway and its pipes lead north and south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eerie Corner</span>
 You've reached a bend in the tunnel where the lights don't quite
 reach. You can continue east or south.

 But you can't just stand around, because an Elder Horror is flitting
 through the shadows here, gibbering in little shrieks.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Ladder</span>
 In the middle of this east-west strip of tunnel is an open grate. In
 the grate is a ladder. The ladder leads down to the sub-basement
 level.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Well-Lit Corner</span>
 The passage from the west turns here, at the top of a gentle slope
 leading south. This would be a great place to race office chairs, if
 other concerns weren't taking precedence.

 A hacker is leaning against the wall here, taking a break from
 hacking.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graffito</span>
 At this intersection, the tunnels go north, south—and west, to the
 chamber of your ill-advised project.

 An old graffito is on the east wall.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Odd Corner</span>
 The tunnel turns from north to west here, but the passage to the west
 is too dark to see where it goes.

 You take another step and slip on a piece of paper.

>kulehrif

 You mutter the incantation, and a greenish haze swims in front of your
 eyes. Your knees buckle, and for a giddy moment you feel as though you
 may barf.

 But when you regain your faculties, you notice your vision has
 improved, and you can see easily what lurks in dark corners. You don't
 notice anything new right here, though.

 You can use the abbreviation "K" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dead End</span>
 The tunnel from the east terminates here at a brick wall. There are no
 lights here because it would seem that there is nothing here to
 illuminate.

 Apparently someone disagreed, and made this into their personal study
 space: A thick textbook lies forgotten on the floor.

>examine textbook

 The book's cover is immediately recognizable: This is the
 <span class="floydstyle em">Necronomicon,</span> by A. Alhazred, an infamous tome of dark magic.
 You flip through it a little bit.

 Here's a page that jogs your memory: A spell that conjures frigid wind
 from... It doesn't say where. The incantation is "bheishauph."

 Why would someone just leave a <span class="floydstyle em">Necronomicon</span> lying around?
 These books are expensive!

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 This is the future site of the Gentry Antiquarian Center. Right now
 it's a rectangular pit with concrete walls.

 The Alchemy building is south. Another building—a despicable

>bheishauph

 You breathe the incantation, and a breeze of cool air swirls around
 you. For a moment you feel the supernatural cold of the infinite space
 between the stars.

 You can use the abbreviation "B" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>jilxube

 You struggle to pronounce the abhorrent incantation properly. When you
 finally get it right, a huge mass of slime appears out of nowhere.

 The slime, driven by an invisible and irresistible impulse, flows into
 the subterranean walls of the construction site, filling the pit until
 the level of the ghastly liquid is even with the surrounding earth. A

>bheishauph

 You breathe the incantation, and a breeze of cool air swirls around
 you.

 Crystalline patterns appear in the surface of the pool of slime,
 spreading across and down through the repugnant morass. The surface of
 the fluid ceases its undulations: It has frozen straight through.

 The manila envelope sits on top of the ice.

>read envelope

 You take a cautious step onto the slime-ice.

 It seems to support your weight.

 Time being a limiting factor, you scuttle across the ice, snatch up
 the envelope, and scuttle back to solid ground as fast as you can.

 It's definitely campus mail, but the rain has washed away any
 addresses that were ever written on the outside.

 The envelope is closed.

>open envelope

 You open the manila envelope, revealing a grant application.

>examine application

 Not long ago you swore you'd never look at another one of these, but
 such oaths often prove difficult to uphold.

 The application proposes an investigation into the little-understood
 branch of "reparative spatial mechanics." The document is careful not
 to explain these terms with extraneous clarity, lest the subject
 appear too comprehensible to warrant investigation.

 But the applicant has let one specific detail slip: an incantation,
 "Vaadignephod," with apparent reparative spatio-mechanical potency.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Confusing Tunnel</span>
 Oh dear. This is one of <span class="floydstyle em">those</span> places.

 The geometry in here is incorrect. All the surfaces are inside-out.
 The physical laws of some other dimension must be impinging on this
 space from somewhere outside space.

 Dang.

>vaadignephod

 You pronounce the incantation in solemn, creaking tones, and the walls
 slowly untangle themselves as the normal laws of three-dimensional
 space reassert themselves.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Normal Tunnel</span>
 Now that you've sorted out the geometry, this is a perfectly normal

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lonely Tunnel</span>
 The tunnel from the north comes to an abrupt end here.

 On the dusty floor is a pitiful, deflated blob.

 "Ooooooh, I'm miiiiserabllllle," it groans, in a voice that makes you
 wince.

>talk to blob

 The thing on the floor manages to make eye contact despite your best
 efforts.

 "Hey, um. How're you doing?" you ask.

 "Hoooooorribllllle," it responds. "I'm sooooo huuuungry, I can barely
 moooooove."

 You nod. "That's rough."

 The blob pouts some more: "Can't you hellllllp meeeeee?".

>jilxube

 You force yourself to pronounce the nauseous formula, and a mass of
 slime appears from nowhere. The blob's eyes widen. It forces its
 boneless bulk forward for a taste.

 It begins scarfing down the vile stuff with unholy relish, moving
 unctuously up and down the hall like a formless, wheezing Roomba. It
 ceases its slobbering only when no trace of the slime you conjured
 remains.

 "Thaaaaaank yoooooou," it squeals. "That was deliiiiiiciousssss."

 "It was nothing. Honestly," you say, trying to smile.

 "Nooooooo, I have to thaaaaaaaank you," says the blob. "Looooook, I'll

 You take the blob's advice, and wave gratefully when it finally

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alchemy Basement</span>
 Your vision clears, and you're back in the basement of the Alchemy
 building.

 This is one of your favorite haunts on the G.U.E. campus. It's a great
 place to curl up with a book—but you really don't have time for that
 right now.

 There's a stairway here that leads up to the Department of Alchemy
 lobby, and a well-lit tunnel leads north.

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this
 time.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Alchemy Lobby</span>
 The Alchemy building feels small and defenseless in the face of the
 wild thunderstorm outside. Rain and howling wind pound at the doors to
 the north and east. A stairway leads down to the basement (and the
 tunnels).

 This lobby is especially creepy because there's an informative poster
 depicting an Elder Horror hanging on the wall.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Construction Site</span>
 Torrents of rain lash at the earth in blind fury.

 This is the future site of the Gentry Antiquarian Center. Right now
 it's a rectangular pit with concrete walls.

 The Alchemy building is south. Another building—a despicable
 building—is further north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Department of Sorcery</span>
 The forboding building to the east houses the Department of Sorcery,
 which frequently competes with the Alchemy department for funding and
 is always reserving the best classrooms before Alchemy can get a
 chance. The rest of the campus is south from here.

 Thunder rumbles nearby.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside Department of Sorcery</span>
 You break out in gooseflesh as you contemplate the eldritch
 experiments performed within these walls on a daily basis. You don't
 like visiting this place unless you have to. It even smells
 pretentious.

 The department head's office is down the hall to the east. The way
 back outside is west.

 The only person here tonight is a grad student whom you kind of know.

>caerlaev

 You lock eyes with the grad student as you hiss the incantation. Your
 vision swims—and then you are staring into your own eyes. They look
 back with shock, then dawning fear, and then revulsion.

 "Why'd you steal my body?" the grad student demands, in your voice.
 "That's messed up!"

 "I don't have time to explain," you grunt, in his voice. "I've got
 stuff I've gotta do."

 "Well," says the grad student, rifling through your belongings, "it
 looks like <span class="floydstyle em">I've</span> got <span class="floydstyle em">your</span> car keys. So..."

 He takes off down the hall and out into the storm.

 You can use the abbreviation "C" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department Head's Office</span>
 The head of the Sorcery department has an extremely nice office. For
 example, his desk does not look like it was dragged out of a junkyard.
 On top of the desk is what looks like a copy of the <span class="floydstyle em">Book of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Eibon</span>.

 The department head rises to greet you.

 "Thanks for coming," he says. "I could really use your help with..."

 Then, his eyes suddenly afire with evil, he waves his hand and mutters
 an eldritch invocation at you. Something in your mind disconnects from
 something else.

 "Perfect," says the professor. "Now, would you mind standing inside of
 that pentagram over there?"

>yzawnzag

 You step into the pentagram. The professor lifts the <span class="floydstyle em">Book of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Eibon</span> from his desk and begins chanting in a bizarre,
 otherworldly language.

 Something else appears in the room. It appears to have a lot of teeth.

 Uh-oh!

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Typical Tunnel</span>
 Before you enrolled at G.U.E. Tech, you had this romantic idea that
 the tunnels would all be dingy, claustrophobic, and dangerous. But
 these tunnels—the tunnels that most people see—are really more like
 hallways with pipes.

 This hallway and its pipes lead north and south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eerie Corner</span>
 You've reached a bend in the tunnel where the lights don't quite
 reach. You can continue east or south.

 But you can't just stand around, because an Elder Horror is flitting
 through the shadows here, gibbering in little shrieks.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Ladder</span>
 In the middle of this east-west strip of tunnel is an open grate. In
 the grate is a ladder. The ladder leads down to the sub-basement
 level.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Well-Lit Corner</span>
 The passage from the west turns here, at the top of a gentle slope
 leading south. This would be a great place to race office chairs, if
 other concerns weren't taking precedence.

 A hacker is leaning against the wall here, taking a break from
 hacking.

>caerlaev

 You lock eyes with the hacker as you hiss the incantation. Your vision
 swims—and then you are staring into your own eyes.

 "Did you just switch our bodies?" the hacker asks, in your voice.

 "For the time being, yes," you say.

 Your voice sounds disappointed. "That is incredibly rude," she says.
 "Could I get my key ring back, at least?"

 Embarrassed, you awkwardly unclip the heavy ring from the hacker's
 belt and toss it to your body. The hacker snatches it from the air and
 starts rummaging through your pockets. Pretty soon she finds your
 keys, and clips them onto her ring.

 "Well, I'm going to go mess with your stuff now," she explains, and
 she brushes past you on her way down the tunnel.

 She's right, you know. That was super rude.

 You can use the abbreviation "C" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>inventory

 You are carrying nothing.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graffito</span>
 At this intersection, the tunnels go north, south—and west, to the
 chamber of your ill-advised project.

 An old graffito is on the east wall.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ritual Chamber</span>
 It groans sluggishly. It shrugs its unthinkable head—No. That is not
 a
 head.

 The whitish, loathsome, incomprehensible thing that oozes before you
 is Ynf-Okh-Omm, the Eldest Horror. It is sleeping, for now. Soon (very
 soon), it will awaken, and this helpless universe will suffer the
 consequences.

 The way out is east.

>caerlaev

 You pronounce the incantation correctly, but the sound seems to fade
 away even as it exits your lips. Something is missing.

 Ynf-Okh-Omm stirs. The Eldest Horror rolls over. Some hideous aspect
 of its body—an eye?—a mouth?—opens, and you are the first to be
 devoured.

 Then, his eyes suddenly afire with evil, he waves his hand and mutters

 "That's not gonna work," you say. "I cast a Yzawnzag on myself a
 little bit ago."

 He squints. "Why would you do that?"

 "Because I knew you were gonna try to hypnotize me! Oh, also, I'm not
 really your research assistant. I switched bodies with him."

 The professor gapes at you in distress. "So—But—Where is my
 assistant?"

 You shrug. He rolls his eyes and grabs his coat. As he rushes out of
 his office he snaps at you: "Don't touch anything."

>examine book

 You open the book to a dogeared page. Oh dear.

 You turn to another page. This can't be!

 You flip wildly through the <span class="floydstyle em">Book of Eibon,</span> but it's all the
 same! It's all in Swedish!

 You do not speak Swedish.

>examine desk

 The department head may in fact be the original user of this desk. The
 idea of a <span class="floydstyle em">new piece of furniture</span> in an office at G.U.E. Tech
 is almost impossible to contemplate.

 On the desk is a copy of the <span class="floydstyle em">Book of Eibon</span>.

 These are not the fun tunnels that they show you on campus tours.
 These are the old tunnels. The evil tunnels.

 The ladder here goes up to the main basement level. Tunnels lead east,
 south, and west.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Power Station</span>
 Thrumming all around you are hulks of decrepit machinery, sagging
 under the weight of decades, struggling to supply power to the

 tentacles of Ynf-Okh-Omm, worming their way through the ceiling from
 its chamber above. The Eldest Horror is leeching power from G.U.E.'s

 The tunnels continue north and south.

 The lights have gone out in this chamber, and you can't see your own

 You mutter the incantation, and a greenish haze swims in front of your
 eyes. Your knees buckle, and for a giddy moment you feel as though you
 may barf.

 But when you regain your faculties, you notice your vision has
 improved, and the room does not seem so dark now:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dim Intersection</span>
 The lights have gone out in this chamber, but you can clearly see the

 You can also see an Elder Horror near you. Whether it can see you
 remains to be seen.

 You can use the abbreviation "K" the next time you want to cast this

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crumbled Tunnel</span>
 A wall of debris makes further progress impossible. The only way out
 is to go back west.

 There's a dead rat on the floor here. Yuckers.

>hterwerbset

 You whisper the incantation, and feel a daemoniac power crystallize in
 the air, its vertices aligned by the awful syllables as they leave
 your lips. The spell's angles align with something invisible and
 dreadful, and the rat on the floor shudders to life.

 "That was awful nice of you!" the rat would say, if rats could talk,
 but they can't; instead, it crawls into a crevice in the debris,
 kicking a crumpled note out behind it.

 You can use the abbreviation "H" the next time you want to cast this

 You uncrumple the note. This appears to be... Ooh! You're not supposed
 to have this!

 This note explains a magical formula that allows one to travel to the
 Dusky Threshold, an eerie plane of existence that exists parallel to
 the Normal World. It's very similar to—<span class="floydstyle em">but distinct</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">from</span>—the
 "Upside-Down" from that Winona Ryder show.

 Knowledge of the Dusky Threshold is kept under wraps because it's
 reportedly very dangerous and it's essentially impossible to get back
 to the Normal World once you're there. Anyway, it looks like the
 incantation for sending yourself there is "Pheimmeb."

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alchemy Basement</span>
 Your vision clears, and you're back in the basement of the Alchemy
 building.

 This is one of your favorite haunts on the G.U.E. campus. It's a great
 place to curl up with a book—but you really don't have time for that
 right now.

 There's a stairway here that leads up to the Department of Alchemy
 lobby, and a well-lit tunnel leads north.

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this
 time.

>pheimmeb

 As you pronounce the incantation, a gauzy curtain of shadow falls over
 you. The world becomes hazy, dim, and distant.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dusky Threshold</span>
 You are in a space behind space. The Normal World is barely visible
 beyond the veil of shadow: a congeries of silent and
 near-unrecognizable shapes. It basically looks like a basement.

 You can use the abbreviation "P" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go north

 After a little experimentation, you get the impression that movement
 through  the Dusky Threshold is not possible.

 You may be stuck here.

>enter veil

 You can't see any such thing.

>enter normal world

 You are close enough to the shapes already.

>examine shapes

 It basically looks like a basement.

>touch shapes

 Best to keep one's hands to oneself.

>enter basement

 You are close enough to the shapes already.

>pheimmeb

 You pronounce the incantation, but nothing happens.

 It's starting to look like you're stuck here. But! It might not be too
 late to UNDO repeatedly.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Alchemy Lobby</span>
 The Alchemy building feels small and defenseless in the face of the
 wild thunderstorm outside. Rain and howling wind pound at the doors to
 the north and east. A stairway leads down to the basement (and the
 tunnels).

 This lobby is especially creepy because there's an informative poster
 depicting an Elder Horror hanging on the wall.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 Normally, this grassy courtyard is a favorite spot for joggers and
 Ultimate Frisbee players—but what with the rain, and the lightning,
 there's nobody here right now.

 To the west is the Department of Alchemy. East is the Department of
 Necromancy. North is the Department of Linguistics.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Linguistics</span>
 There's not much here—the Linguistics department was organized with a
 minimalist philosophy in mind. A likely-looking (and heavy-looking)
 grimoire rests on a pedestal in an alcove.

 The way out is south.

>pheimmeb

 As you pronounce the incantation, a gauzy curtain of shadow falls over
 you. The world becomes hazy, dim, and distant.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dusky Threshold</span>
 You are in a space behind space. The Normal World is barely visible
 beyond the veil of shadow: a congeries of silent and
 near-unrecognizable shapes. You're pretty sure you're still "inside"
 the Linguistics building.

 A huge mass of seething fungoid tissue hangs in the space
 corresponding (you think) to the alcove.

 You can use the abbreviation "P" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>talk to fungoid

 The fungoid horror isn't very talkative.

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dusky Threshold</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>raenfidhre

 You utter the incantation, the eldritch puissance of its awful
 phonemes flowing with hideous sweetness over your tongue. A hole opens
 in the non-space of the Dusky Threshold.

 It is a big hole, big enough to tear such a hideously massive Elder
 Horror away from this realm, stretching the alien beast into
 impossible angles, and sucking great ropes of the caliginous substance
 of the Dusky Threshold along with the beast into the dimension beyond.
 Even as vaporous as you are, you feel yourself drawn into the chasm as
 well—

 But the hole shuts itself, and you are alone among the shadows.

 You can use the abbreviation "R" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>examine grimoire

 You reach out to inspect the grimoire. Your hand runs into something.
 Something squishy and invisible.

 You hold still for a second: You think you can hear it breathing.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 Normally, this grassy courtyard is a favorite spot for joggers and
 Ultimate Frisbee players—but what with the rain, and the lightning,
 there's nobody here right now.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Necromancy Hallway</span>
 You seem to be in a hallway—but it's too dark to see which way it
 leads, what it leads to, or what else is in here with you. The only
 thing you can see is the way outside, to the west.

>take roach

 You can't see any such thing.

>kulehrif

 You mutter the incantation, and a greenish haze swims in front of your
 eyes. Your knees buckle, and for a giddy moment you feel as though you
 may barf.

 But when you regain your faculties, you notice your vision has
 improved, and the room does not seem so dark now:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Necromancy Hallway</span>
 Looks like there are no necromancy students here tonight, which is
 just as well.

 This hallway leads north and west.

 And there's a dead cockroach on the floor here! Gross.

 You can use the abbreviation "K" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 There's a stairway here that leads up to the Department of Alchemy
 lobby, and a well-lit tunnel leads north.

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this
 time.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Typical Tunnel</span>
 Before you enrolled at G.U.E. Tech, you had this romantic idea that
 the tunnels would all be dingy, claustrophobic, and dangerous. But
 these tunnels—the tunnels that most people see—are really more like
 hallways with pipes.

 This hallway and its pipes lead north and south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eerie Corner</span>
 You've reached a bend in the tunnel where the lights don't quite
 reach. You can continue east or south.

 But you can't just stand around, because an Elder Horror is flitting
 through the shadows here, gibbering in little shrieks.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Ladder</span>
 In the middle of this east-west strip of tunnel is an open grate. In
 the grate is a ladder. The ladder leads down to the sub-basement
 level.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bottom of Ladder</span>
 These are not the fun tunnels that they show you on campus tours.
 These are the old tunnels. The evil tunnels.

 Ancient pipes clank and hiss, and beneath these noises—you wonder if
 you're imagining—the sound of something skittering behind you.

 The ladder here goes up to the main basement level. Tunnels lead east,
 south, and west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Circular Tunnel</span>
 This damp tunnel looks like it used to be a sewer, or a pneumatic
 railroad. The curved floor makes it difficult to walk without keeping
 a hand on the damp curved walls.

 The way back is east. The tunnel continues south, beyond a
 waterfall-like curtain of slime.

>bheishauph

 You breathe the incantation, and a breeze of cool air swirls around
 you. Unsettlingly regular patterns of frost curl across the tunnel
 walls until they reach the curtain of slime.

 The flow of slime slows, and then it stops as the waterfall freezes in
 place. You hear a crinkling sound.

 The frozen curtain of slime shatters and disappears. The way south is
 open.

 You can use the abbreviation "B" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall of Slime</span>
 The tunnel is a river of undulating slime, and there are few places
 where it's safe to set foot. The way out is north.

 Someone has written something on the walls.

>pheimmeb

 As you pronounce the incantation, a gauzy curtain of shadow falls over
 you. The world becomes hazy, dim, and distant.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dusky Threshold</span>
 You are in a space behind space. The Normal World is barely visible
 beyond the veil of shadow: a congeries of silent and
 near-unrecognizable shapes. Among them you can almost make out the
 form, such as it is, of the river of slime.

 You are not alone. An annoyed-looking spectre is here with you.

 You can use the abbreviation "P" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>talk to spectre

 You think you are looking at a humanoid form—but as you try to look
 closer, the spectre starts yelling at you.

 "What are you doing here?!"

 "It's a long story," you try to say, but the spectre has other plans.

 "I don't care! Get out of here! I specifically asked not to be
 bothered!"

 You grit your teeth. "I don't know how."

 The spectre sighs. "Just cast <span class="floydstyle em">mnymnswst,</span> okay?"

 "Sure," you say, hoping the spell is easier to pronounce than it
 sounds.

 Then it happens. Even here, where the Normal World is completely
 silent, you can hear it: something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 tunnels).

 This lobby is especially creepy because there's an informative poster

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Linguistics</span>
 There's not much here—the Linguistics department was organized with a

 As you utter the incantation, the smoky dimness around you is ripped
 away—in an instant, the Dusky Threshold has become the Normal World.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department of Linguistics</span>
 There's not much here—the Linguistics department was organized with a

 grimoire rests on a pedestal in an alcove.

 The way out is south.

 You can use the abbreviation "M" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>examine grimoire

 Now you can get a close look at the grimoire.

 Its contents are mostly theoretical, concerned with the notion
 (undoubtedly quite novel, back whenever this was written) that
 language itself is a kind of contagious disease, propagating itself by
 transmission from human mind to human mind, but having an origin quite
 distant from the sphere of human existence.

 The applications of this theory are relegated to the end notes, which
 include a formula that purportedly will "infect" its speaker with a
 Scandanavian strain of the mind-virus: "Fickordbok."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Construction Site</span>
 Torrents of rain lash at the earth in blind fury.

 This is the future site of the Gentry Antiquarian Center. Right now
 it's a rectangular pit with concrete walls.

 The Alchemy building is south. Another building—a despicable
 building—is further north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Department of Sorcery</span>
 The forboding building to the east houses the Department of Sorcery,
 which frequently competes with the Alchemy department for funding and
 is always reserving the best classrooms before Alchemy can get a
 chance. The rest of the campus is south from here.

 Thunder rumbles nearby.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside Department of Sorcery</span>
 You break out in gooseflesh as you contemplate the eldritch
 experiments performed within these walls on a daily basis. You don't
 like visiting this place unless you have to. It even smells
 pretentious.

 The department head's office is down the hall to the east. The way
 back outside is west.

 The only person here tonight is a grad student whom you kind of know.

>caerlaev

 You lock eyes with the grad student as you hiss the incantation. Your
 vision swims—and then you are staring into your own eyes. They look
 back with shock, then dawning fear, and then revulsion.

 "Why'd you steal my body?" the grad student demands, in your voice.
 "That's messed up!"

 "I don't have time to explain," you grunt, in his voice. "I've got
 stuff I've gotta do."

 "Well," says the grad student, rifling through your belongings, "it
 looks like <span class="floydstyle em">I've</span> got <span class="floydstyle em">your</span> car keys. So..."

 He takes off down the hall and out into the storm.

 You can use the abbreviation "C" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>yzawnzag

 As you pronounce the incantation, you feel your mind curl inward as if
 to defend itself. You think, or you hope, that your willpower has
 increased.

 You can use the abbreviation "Y" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department Head's Office</span>
 The head of the Sorcery department has an extremely nice office. For
 example, his desk does not look like it was dragged out of a junkyard.
 On top of the desk is what looks like a copy of the <span class="floydstyle em">Book of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Eibon</span>.

 The department head rises to greet you.

 "Thanks for coming," he says. "I could really use your help with..."

 Then, his eyes suddenly afire with evil, he waves his hand and mutters
 an eldritch invocation at you.

 "That's not gonna work," you say. "I cast a Yzawnzag on myself a
 little bit ago."

 He squints. "Why would you do that?"

 "Because I knew you were gonna try to hypnotize me! Oh, also, I'm not
 really your research assistant. I switched bodies with him."

 The professor gapes at you in distress. "So—But—Where is my
 assistant?"

 You shrug. He rolls his eyes and grabs his coat. As he rushes out of
 his office he snaps at you: "Don't touch anything."

>fickordbok

 The incantation trips liltingly over your tongue, and instantaneously
 you feel as though you have a working knowledge of the Swedish
 language.

 You can use the abbreviation "F" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>examine book

 You open the book to a dogeared page. The Swedish text is inscrutable
 to your conscious mind, but nonetheless you somehow understand
 it—well, most of it:

 There's a <span class="floydstyle em">trollformel</span> (incantation) that lets you
 <span class="floydstyle em">stiga</span> (go up) and <span class="floydstyle em">sjunka</span> (go down) through <span class="floydstyle em">tak</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">och golv</span> (ceilings and floors). And the incantation is:
 AVITHSKELT. Got it.

 Then it happens. You hear something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

>avithskelt

 You whisper the incantation, and you feel a violent, shuddering change
 in your bones, or else in your molecular structure. You have the
 impression of a bizarre untetheredness.

 You can use the abbreviation "A" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go down

 You think of the so-called "Pauli exclusion principle" and roll your
 eyes as you float down, through the ground.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Confusing Passage</span>
 Something is wrong with the angles in this passage—if it is a
 passage.
 Space seems to be turned around, or it's backwards, or... This is
 giving you a headache.

>vaadignephod

 You pronounce the incantation in solemn, creaking tones, and the walls
 slowly untangle themselves as the normal laws of three-dimensional
 space reassert themselves.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Passage</span>
 Now that everything is straightened out, you can see that this
 "passage" is actually a dead end. The only way out is east.

 You can use the abbreviation "V" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Intersection</span>
 The lights have gone out in this chamber, and you can't see your own

 And you can definitely hear something slithering squamously nearby.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alchemy Basement</span>
 Your vision clears, and you're back in the basement of the Alchemy
 building.

 This is one of your favorite haunts on the G.U.E. campus. It's a great
 place to curl up with a book—but you really don't have time for that
 right now.

 There's a stairway here that leads up to the Department of Alchemy
 lobby, and a well-lit tunnel leads north.

 You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this
 time.

>avithskelt

 You whisper the incantation, and you feel a violent, shuddering change
 in your bones, or else in your molecular structure. You have the
 impression of a bizarre untetheredness.

 You can use the abbreviation "A" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go down

 You think of the so-called "Pauli exclusion principle" and roll your
 eyes as you float down, through the ground.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Confusing Passage</span>
 Something is wrong with the angles in this passage—if it is a
 passage.
 Space seems to be turned around, or it's backwards, or... This is
 giving you a headache.

>vaadignephod

 You pronounce the incantation in solemn, creaking tones, and the walls
 slowly untangle themselves as the normal laws of three-dimensional
 space reassert themselves.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Passage</span>
 Now that everything is straightened out, you can see that this
 "passage" is actually a dead end. The only way out is east.

 You can use the abbreviation "V" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Intersection</span>
 The lights have gone out in this chamber, and you can't see your own
 hand in front of your face, but you can just make out paths to the
 north, east, and west.

 And you can definitely hear something slithering squamously nearby.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Power Station</span>
 Thrumming all around you are hulks of decrepit machinery, sagging
 under the weight of decades, struggling to supply power to the
 university above. And twisting through their cables are the insidious
 tentacles of Ynf-Okh-Omm, worming their way through the ceiling from
 its chamber above. The Eldest Horror is leeching power from G.U.E.'s
 electrical system! This is your fault!

 The tunnels continue north and south.

>go down

 You will yourself downward—but apparently this is literally as low as
 you can get. Oh well.

>go up

 Shrugging at the outmoded law of gravity, you float up, through the
 ceiling.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ritual Chamber</span>
 It groans sluggishly. It shrugs its unthinkable head—No. That is not
 a
 head.

 The whitish, loathsome, incomprehensible thing that oozes before you
 is Ynf-Okh-Omm, the Eldest Horror. It is sleeping, for now. Soon (very
 soon), it will awaken, and this helpless universe will suffer the
 consequences.

 The way out is east.

 Your body shudders again, and you no longer feel so untethered.

>yzawnzag

 As you pronounce the incantation, you feel your mind curl inward as if
 to defend itself. You think, or you hope, that your willpower has
 increased.

 You can use the abbreviation "Y" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>y

 You cast the hypnosis-resistance spell again, and steel your mind even
 more against external influence (possibly to the point of overdoing
 it).

 Ynf-Okh-Omm stirs. The Eldest Horror rolls over. Some hideous aspect
 of its body—an eye?—a mouth?—opens, and you are the first to be
 devoured.


     *** You have failed. ***



 If you RESTART, you might be able to fix this, unless you—

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ritual Chamber</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>raenfidhre

 You utter the incantation, the eldritch puissance of its awful
 phonemes flowing with hideous sweetness over your tongue.

 A crackle of eldritch power washes over the sleeping hulk, and your
 spell falls flat. How did it do that? Where is it getting this energy?

 You can use the abbreviation "R" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

 Ynf-Okh-Omm stirs. The Eldest Horror rolls over. Some hideous aspect

 time.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Typical Tunnel</span>
 Before you enrolled at G.U.E. Tech, you had this romantic idea that
 the tunnels would all be dingy, claustrophobic, and dangerous. But
 these tunnels—the tunnels that most people see—are really more like
 hallways with pipes.

 This hallway and its pipes lead north and south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eerie Corner</span>
 You've reached a bend in the tunnel where the lights don't quite
 reach. You can continue east or south.

 But you can't just stand around, because an Elder Horror is flitting
 through the shadows here, gibbering in little shrieks.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Ladder</span>
 In the middle of this east-west strip of tunnel is an open grate. In
 the grate is a ladder. The ladder leads down to the sub-basement
 level.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Well-Lit Corner</span>
 The passage from the west turns here, at the top of a gentle slope
 leading south. This would be a great place to race office chairs, if
 other concerns weren't taking precedence.

 A hacker is leaning against the wall here, taking a break from
 hacking.

>caerlaev

 You lock eyes with the hacker as you hiss the incantation. Your vision
 swims—and then you are staring into your own eyes.

 "Did you just switch our bodies?" the hacker asks, in your voice.

 "For the time being, yes," you say.

 Your voice sounds disappointed. "That is incredibly rude," she says.
 "Could I get my key ring back, at least?"

 Embarrassed, you awkwardly unclip the heavy ring from the hacker's
 belt and toss it to your body. The hacker snatches it from the air and
 starts rummaging through your pockets. Pretty soon she finds your
 keys, and clips them onto her ring.

 "Well, I'm going to go mess with your stuff now," she explains, and
 she brushes past you on her way down the tunnel.

 She's right, you know. That was super rude.

 You can use the abbreviation "C" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

 in your bones, or else in your molecular structure. You have the

>go up

 Shrugging at the outmoded law of gravity, you float up, through the
 ceiling.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Department Head's Office</span>
 The head of the Sorcery department has an extremely nice office. For
 example, his desk does not look like it was dragged out of a junkyard.
 On top of the desk is what looks like a copy of the <span class="floydstyle em">Book of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Eibon</span>.

 The department head rises to greet you.

 "What the heck are you doing here?" he says.

 You look around with a thoughtful frown. "Sorry," you say. "I've
 already finished this room."

 "What are you talking about? How did you get here?"

 You close your eyes and visualize the tortuous sequence of events. "I
 used the Avithskelt spell, which I got from the <span class="floydstyle em">Book of Eibon</span>
 over there, which I read using Fickordbok, after I used Caerlaev to
 switch bodies with your research assistant. And Yzawnzag, because you
 were going to hypnotize him. And then I traveled back in time." You
 open your eyes.

 "You know a lot of spells," says the professor.

 You shrug coyly. "I guess."

 "Do you know this one?" He gestures fiendishly and utters something
 unpronounceable.

 "I don't think I do," you almost say, as your body ages centuries in
 the space of seconds, reducing you to a desiccated husk.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bottom of Ladder</span>
 These are not the fun tunnels that they show you on campus tours.
 These are the old tunnels. The evil tunnels.

 Ancient pipes clank and hiss, and beneath these noises—you wonder if
 you're imagining—the sound of something skittering behind you.

 The ladder here goes up to the main basement level. Tunnels lead east,
 south, and west.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Power Station</span>

>raenfidhre

 You utter the incantation, the eldritch puissance of its awful
 phonemes flowing with hideous sweetness over your tongue.

 Nothing happens.

 You can use the abbreviation "R" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>jilxube

 You struggle to pronounce the abhorrent incantation properly. When you
 finally get it right, a huge mass of slime appears out of nowhere,
 draping its dreadful viscousness all over everything in the immediate
 area.

 You can use the abbreviation "J" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>bheishauph

 You breathe the incantation, and a breeze of cool air swirls around
 you. For a moment you feel the supernatural cold of the infinite space
 between the stars.

 The slime crystallizes over a period of seconds, becoming a rigid but
 no less unwholesome mass of many-faceted ice-slime.

 You can use the abbreviation "B" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

>pheimmeb

 As you pronounce the incantation, a gauzy curtain of shadow falls over
 you. The world becomes hazy, dim, and distant.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dusky Threshold</span>
 You are in a space behind space. The Normal World is barely visible
 beyond the veil of shadow: a congeries of silent and
 near-unrecognizable shapes. All that electrical equipment has been
 reduced to a series of vague rectangles.

 You can use the abbreviation "P" the next time you want to cast this
 spell. But not if you travel back in time again. That's how time
 travel works.

 Then it happens. Even here, where the Normal World is completely
 silent, you can hear it: something huge rousing itself from cosmic
 sleep. The thing groans, and the entire campus shakes. Ynf-Okh-Omm has
 awoken. Shortly it will consume G.U.E. Tech—and then the universe.

 That verb doesn't work in this story. Sorry.
