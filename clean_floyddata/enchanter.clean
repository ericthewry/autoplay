 It must be the warlock Krill. The odd disappearances, the mysterious
 dissolution of regions sacred to the Circle, the lessening of the
 Powers -- these could only be his handiwork. The Circle gathers and
 its leader, the esteemed Belboz, reveals to them an ancient document
 which portends evil days much like our own.

 "Krill's evil must be unmade," he begins, "but to send a powerful
 Enchanter is ill-omened. It would be ruinous to reveal oversoon our
 full powers." A ripple of concern spreads over the face of each
 Enchanter. Belboz pauses, and collects his resolve. "Have hope! This
 has been written by a hand far wiser than mine!"

 He recites a short spell and you appear. Belboz approaches,
 transfixing you with his gaze, and hands you the document. The other
 Enchanters await his decree. "These words, written ages ago, can have
 only one meaning. You, a novice Enchanter with but a few simple spells
 in your Book, must seek out Krill, explore the Castle he has
 overthrown, and learn his secrets. Only then may his vast evil be
 lessened or, with good fortune, destroyed."

 The Circle rises and intones a richly woven spell, whose many textures
 imbue the small, darkened chamber with warmth and hope. There is a
 surge of power; you are Sent.

 Loop
 The trail makes a hairpin turn here, swinging out to the northwest and
 northeast, where it enters a small village. Low, smoky hills stretch
 out to the west and south.

>go northeast

 Deserted Village
 This is the castle's village. Formerly, peasants lived here, going to
 their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of
 cultural activity. But now it's deserted. Or almost: there is smoke
 rising from a particularly decrepit hovel to the south. A path travels
 through the village from southwest to northeast, heading towards the
 castle, and a less-used trail heads north up the mountain.

>go south

 It is dark and smoky in here, but this is a place of great disorder,
 and its odor is indescribable. A pile of rags sits near a small pot
 which is bubbling and steaming over a tiny fire. The pile of rags
 sports a gnarled hand which busies itself with the noisome stew. A
 closer look reveals a withered crone at the other end of the hand.

 The creature looks you over keenly and speaks: "I should have thought
 they would send someone more ... more ..." She laughs in an unsettling
 way. "They've all left! A great storm is brewing in the east, my
 friend, and all have fled before it!" She starts to chuckle. "Take
 this and begone!" With a wave of her hand, you find yourself reeling
 out of the door of the hovel, holding some sort of scroll in your
 hand.

>examine scroll

 The scroll reads "rezrov spell: open even locked or enchanted
 objects".

>spell

 There was no verb in that sentence!

>spells

 The gnusto spell, the only thing you seem to have learned well after
 many years at the University, remains yours forever. Other than that,
 you have the blorb spell once and the frotz spell once committed to
 memory.

>gnusto rezrov

 Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of
 the rezrov spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the
 book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains!
 However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word
 is copied.

 Lonely Mountain
 This is the top of the Lonely Mountain. In olden days, mariners had
 named it Signal Mountain, for its glistening peak reflected the pale
 moonlight, providing an unmistakable landmark on unclouded nights. The
 bald mountain face is made of a shining substance whose nature is
 unknown to you. Looking to the west, low hills stretch to the horizon,
 and small pieces of the Long Road can be seen winding their way to
 distant lands. To the east, far away, can be seen a great castle at
 the edge of the Sea. Three turrets it has; two, old and still
 majestic, lie on either side of a third, cold, black as night and
 squat as a toad. An evil smoke seems to emanate from this tower,
 shrouding the others in a darkening fog. A small mountain trail leaves
 the peak and descends to the south into a small village far below.

 Standing in front of you to the north, however, is a door surpassing
 anything you could have imagined. For starters, its massive lock is
 wrapped in a dozen six-inch thick iron chains. In addition, a certain
 five-headed monster sporting razor-sharp spears for tongues seems to
 be imbedded within its heavy oak frame. One is almost embarrassed to
 mention the gargoyles spewing flame and sulphurous ash which ornament
 either side of the door, or the ninety-seven slimy groping tentacles
 which taunt you ever closer to certain death. A sign, floating

 A host of hunched and hairy shapes walk into the hall before you can

 Temple
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 This is the interior of a huge temple of primitive construction. A few
 flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the altar, which,
 atop a row of stairs, is still drenched with the blood of human
 sacrifice. Behind the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which
 seems to reach towards you with dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons.
 Two open doorways lead out of the temple to the east and west, while
 two wooden doors stand at the north and south. A mass of hunched
 figures in the temple are chanting a haunting tune. They don't seem
 interested in your presence.

 A low noise begins behind you, and you turn to see hundreds of hunched
 and hairy shapes. A guttural chant issues from their throats. Near you
 stands a figure draped in a robe of deepest black, brandishing a
 vicious dagger. The chant grows louder as the robed figure approaches
 the altar. As the shapes grab you, the figure in black speaks: "Take
 the victim to the tower. I shall prepare for the sacrifice!" The
 figures, whose form you can barely guess, take you from here through
 the northern door and into a prison cell. They take your possessions
 from you and close the door with a crash!

 Cell
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.

 It must be the warlock Krill. The odd disappearances, the mysterious
 dissolution of regions sacred to the Circle, the lessening of the
 Powers -- these could only be his handiwork. The Circle gathers and
 its leader, the esteemed Belboz, reveals to them an ancient document
 which portends evil days much like our own.

 "Krill's evil must be unmade," he begins, "but to send a powerful
 Enchanter is ill-omened. It would be ruinous to reveal oversoon our
 full powers." A ripple of concern spreads over the face of each
 Enchanter. Belboz pauses, and collects his resolve. "Have hope! This
 has been written by a hand far wiser than mine!"

 He recites a short spell and you appear. Belboz approaches,
 transfixing you with his gaze, and hands you the document. The other
 Enchanters await his decree. "These words, written ages ago, can have
 only one meaning. You, a novice Enchanter with but a few simple spells
 in your Book, must seek out Krill, explore the Castle he has
 overthrown, and learn his secrets. Only then may his vast evil be
 lessened or, with good fortune, destroyed."

 The Circle rises and intones a richly woven spell, whose many textures
 imbue the small, darkened chamber with warmth and hope. There is a
 surge of power; you are Sent.

 The first page of the book was the table of contents. Only two chapter

>read unseen terror

 This legend, written in an ancient tongue, goes something like this:
 At one time a shapeless and formless manifestation of evil was
 disturbed from millenia of sleep. It was so powerful that it required
 the combined wisdom of the leading enchanters of that age to conquer
 it. The legend tells how the enchanters lured the Terror "to a recess
 deep within the earth" by placing there a powerful spell scroll. When
 it had reached the scroll, the enchanters trapped it there with a
 spell that encased it in the living rock. The Terror was so horrible
 that none would dare speak of it. A comment at the end of the
 narration indicates that the story is considered to be quite fanciful;
 no other chronicles of the age mention the Terror in any form.

>read great implementors

 This legend, written in an ancient tongue, speaks of the creation of
 the world. A more absurd account can hardly be imagined. The universe,
 it seems, was created by "Implementers" who directed the running of
 great engines. These engines produced this world and others, strange
 and wondrous, as a test or puzzle for others of their kind. It goes on
 to state that these beings stand ready to aid those entrapped within
 their creation. The great magician-philosopher Helfax notes that a
 creation of this kind is morally and logically indefensible and
 discards the theory as "colossal claptrap and kludgery."

 Dungeon
 A dank and forgotten pit contains the dungeons. There is a cell to the

 away, and the block is loose.

>take block

 You pull the block out of the crumbling wall, revealing a dark passage
 leading east.
 Your stomach is starting to grumble.

>go east

 Secret Passage
 This is a crudely carved secret passage. It appears to have been
 hollowed out by (perhaps) generations of prisoners. A passage leads
 west. A short, crudely hewn passage leads up.
 Lying near the door is a silver spoon, discarded by the prisoners as
 too soft to dig with. It is only slightly worn.
 Lying on the ground, and slightly damaged, is a stained scroll.

>take all

 worn silver spoon: Taken.
 stained scroll: Taken.

 The scroll reads "exex spell: make things move with greater speed".

>gnusto exex

 Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of
 the exex spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book
 itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However,
 the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is
 copied.

 Gallery
 The east-west corridor opens into a gallery. The walls are lined with
 portraits, some of apparently great value. All of the eyes seem to
 follow you as you pass, and the entire room is subtly disturbing.

>look at paintings

 The portraits represent a wide cross-section of races. Elves, gnomes,
 dwarves, wizards, warlocks, and just plain folk are all here. Some of
 them are known to you, such as Lord Dimwit Flathead of the Great
 Underground Empire, depicted here in excessive detail, and the Wizard
 of Frobozz, shown in a typical pose of anguished bewilderment.

>look at frobozz

 The Wizard of Frobozz was a former member of the Circle of Enchanters,
 but he was removed for forgetfulness bordering on senility. The lively
 wit of his youth having been replaced by a semisadistic
 mischievousness coupled with an inability to pronounce words beginning
 with other than the letter "F", he was "retired" to a small,
 unoccupied corner of the Great Underground Empire, hopefully out of
 harm's way.

>look at flathead

 This rather dull man stumbled into royalty in the Great Underground
 Empire, and much to everyone's chagrin. Named by his people Lord
 Dimwit Flathead the Excessive, he was best known for his
 outrageousness in style, policy, and engineering. His portrait
 captures him in the classic pose of imbecility, astride his gaudy
 throne.

 This is a rocky beach along a grey and lifeless sea. There is dead

 Crawling slowly along the beach is an enormous turtle, his enamelled
 shell shining with all the colors of the rainbow.
 You hear a rustling in the brambles nearby, and you catch a glimpse of
 something small and furry as it scurries away.

 Ah, sleep! It's been a long day, indeed. The rest will do you good.
 You spread your cloak on the floor and drift off, renewing your powers

 You dream of a nondescript room in which a cartoonish figure casually
 opens a simple wooden door and ascends the flight of stairs which lies
 behind. The scene fades to black, but you awaken in a cold sweat.

 Engine Room
 The room is filled with noise: crashing and smashing, gurgling of
 water, grinding of gears, and horrible screeching of metal. Huge
 devices of obscure purpose provide these effects. The most notable is
 a huge hammer that smashes continually against the stone floor: it
 makes any crossing of the room a dangerous enterprise. The whole
 construction brings to mind the words "Infernal Machine." Far off to
 the southeast is another room. You can barely make out something on
 the floor of that room. It might be a scroll, but from here you can't
 tell for sure.

 leads into a room with machinery which would surely crush you if you
 were to attempt to enter it.
 A scroll of old, brittle parchment is here.

 Your spell book begins to glow softly. In a spectacular effort of
 magic, the powers of the gnusto spell attempt to copy the kulcad spell

 intact.

 Too fast, in fact. You can't dodge them, and you are severely
 skewered.

 A host of hunched and hairy shapes walk into the hall before you can
 do anything and, seeing you, take you in their arms and escort you to
 the west into a huge temple.

 Temple
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 This is the interior of a huge temple of primitive construction. A few
 flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the altar, which,
 atop a row of stairs, is still drenched with the blood of human
 sacrifice. Behind the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which
 seems to reach towards you with dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons.
 Two open doorways lead out of the temple to the east and west, while
 two wooden doors stand at the north and south. A mass of hunched
 figures in the temple are chanting a haunting tune. They don't seem
 interested in your presence.

 A low noise begins behind you, and you turn to see hundreds of hunched
 and hairy shapes. A guttural chant issues from their throats. Near you
 stands a figure draped in a robe of deepest black, brandishing a
 vicious dagger. The chant grows louder as the robed figure approaches
 the altar. As the shapes grab you, the figure in black speaks: "Take
 the victim to the tower. I shall prepare for the sacrifice!" The
 figures, whose form you can barely guess, take you from here through
 the northern door and into a prison cell. They take your possessions
 from you and close the door with a crash!

 Cell
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 This is a small prison cell in the north tower of the temple. Hideous
 shapes can be seen through the iron-barred window in the prison door.
 From the temple, a bloodcurdling chant can be heard.

>go east

 The door is locked from the outside. even if you could open it, the
 guards would undoubtedly return you with little difficulty.

 A host of hunched and hairy shapes appear through the window. The cell
 door opens and you are marched solemnly to the temple and, from there,
 up the steps to the altar. The large, black figure approaches
 menacingly. He reaches into his cloak and pulls out a great, glowing
 dagger. He pulls you onto the altar, and with a murmur of approval
 from the throng, he plunges the blade into your heart!

 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 This is the westernmost point in a large open courtyard. The huge
 entrance gate to the castle looms ominously to the west. The courtyard
 widens as it proceeds to the east, where a large, ivy-covered temple
 stands. On either side of the temple are small towers. Far beyond the
 temple, high above, are two large towers marking the corners of the
 castle. A squat dark turret hunches between them, blackening the sky
 around it. A small path leads into the castle to the south.

>go northeast

 Courtyard
 The northern part of the interior courtyard is grey and lifeless. The
 vast lawns are withered and covered in black ash stretching from south
 to west. The temple stands to the southeast, and the courtyard
 continues east.

>go south

 Courtyard
 You are in the center of a large courtyard, which surrounds you.
 Everything around you is ashen and grey, and the air seems miasmic and
 oppressive. The dead grass seems to grab at your feet as you stand
 gazing around. To the east is a temple flanked by two smaller towers.
 Behind it can be seen the two eastern towers of the castle, shrouded
 in blood-red fog. Between them is a dark turret, black and ominous as
 night. It sends dark streams of smoke curling around everything near
 it. From the temple can be heard a mournful chant.

>go south

 Courtyard
 This is the southern part of the courtyard, spreading north and west.
 The ground is ashen and grey, and the air heavy with death. The dead
 grass seems to grab at your feet. A narrow stretch of scorched earth
 continues to the east. To the northeast stands the temple, flanked by
 two small towers.

>go east

 Courtyard
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 You are south of a small tower which connects with the temple to the
 north. A large courtyard can be seen to the west and a smaller one to
 the northeast.
 The sun starts to set behind the Lonely Mountain in the west.
 The day is coming to an end earlier than you would have expected.

>go northeast

 Courtyard
 You are in a courtyard between an open hall to the east and a temple
 to the west. The temple is flanked, north and south, by twin towers.
 Paths cross the scarred lawn to the northwest and southwest. Nothing
 now grows here, however, and a foul stench fills the air.

>go east

 Junction
 The corridor widens here to form a large hall. To the north and south
 are small passages, and to the east is what appears to be an enormous
 spiral staircase. A passage to the west leads into a courtyard. The
 walls here are scarred and black, and a strange heaviness hangs in the
 air.

>go east

 A host of hunched and hairy shapes walk into the hall before you can
 do anything and, seeing you, take you in their arms and escort you to
 the west into a huge temple.

 Temple
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 This is the interior of a huge temple of primitive construction. A few
 flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the altar, which,
 atop a row of stairs, is still drenched with the blood of human
 sacrifice. Behind the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which
 seems to reach towards you with dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons.
 Two open doorways lead out of the temple to the east and west, while
 two wooden doors stand at the north and south. A mass of hunched
 figures in the temple are chanting a haunting tune. They don't seem
 interested in your presence.

 A low noise begins behind you, and you turn to see hundreds of hunched
 and hairy shapes. A guttural chant issues from their throats. Near you
 stands a figure draped in a robe of deepest black, brandishing a
 vicious dagger. The chant grows louder as the robed figure approaches
 the altar. As the shapes grab you, the figure in black speaks: "Take
 the victim to the tower. I shall prepare for the sacrifice!" The
 figures, whose form you can barely guess, take you from here through
 the northern door and into a prison cell. They take your possessions
 from you and close the door with a crash!

 Cell
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 This is a small prison cell in the north tower of the temple. Hideous
 shapes can be seen through the iron-barred window in the prison door.
 From the temple, a bloodcurdling chant can be heard.

 The damp corridor continues east and west from here. A dark and

 passage leads to the north.

>go north

 Closet
 This small room must have been a closet of some sort. To the north is
 a passage leading out into a courtyard. Another exit is to the south.
 In the exact center of the room is a large, jewelled box. It is
 wrapped in tight coils of thin rope. You try to follow the strands
 with your eye, but become hopelessly lost in the jumble of thousands
 of loops and knots.

>rezrov door

 The locked cell door opens with a powerful snap! Unfortunately, the
 guards seem to have heard the snap and approach!

 A host of hunched and hairy shapes appear through the window. The cell
 door opens and you are marched solemnly to the temple and, from there,
 up the steps to the altar. The large, black figure approaches
 menacingly. He reaches into his cloak and pulls out a great, glowing
 dagger. He pulls you onto the altar, and with a murmur of approval
 from the throng, he plunges the blade into your heart!

     ****  You have died  ****

 You awaken among the members of the Circle. Belboz the Necromancer
 looks tired, and scattered about are the remains of the components of
 a spell of great healing power. The other members of the Circle are
 pleased to see you revived, but worried by the setback. "I think Krill
 is too powerful," says one. "This inexperienced wizard will never
 defeat one so puissant as he." Quiet discussion ensues, with
 well-concealed acrimony beneath the surface.
 Debate ensues, with Belboz returning frequently to the contents of the
 ancient manuscript. His wishes prevail, and it is agreed to send you
 back....

 Standing in front of you to the north, however, is a door surpassing

 wrapped in a dozen six-inch thick iron chains. In addition, a certain
 five-headed monster sporting razor-sharp spears for tongues seems to
 be imbedded within its heavy oak frame. One is almost embarrassed to
 mention the gargoyles spewing flame and sulphurous ash which ornament
 either side of the door, or the ninety-seven slimy groping tentacles
 which taunt you ever closer to certain death. A sign, floating
 serenely above the door and glowing hideously in purple letters,
 offers the following rude understatement: "Don't Bother".

 As you motion toward the monstrous door, the adventurer follows the
 imaginary line which proceeds thence from your outstretched arm.

 The seemingly fearless adventurer shrugs and walks purposefully toward
 the door, ignoring all harm to his person in the form of knives,
 tentacles, and molten lead. As three buckets of the latter pour over
 his head, he casts you a perplexed look.
 "Did you try the doorknob?" he asks, as twenty-seven knives delicately
 skewer him.
 Before you can answer, he reaches for one of the gargoyle heads which,
 by sheerest coincidence, has just flooded him in red-orange flame, and
 turns it gently.
 "I think it's unlocked," he says, stoically ignoring the host of
 human-sized rats which feed on his incinerated torso.
 His left hand, broken and bloodied, pulls at the gargoyle head.
 "I'm going on ahead!" he cries, opening a simple wooden door.
 Wooden door? You rub your eyes for a moment and look again as he goes
 through it. Yes, just a plain wooden door.

 Map Room
 This room in the high tower appears to be a map room, with hundreds of
 ancient maps covering the walls. A huge globe, made of gold, sits on a
 pedestal in the center of the room. Through the tower windows can be
 seen a vast forest stretching out to the northeast and the sea,
 covered in fog, to the east and south. Stairs to the south lead to the
 bottom of the tower.
 Lying on the floor is a purple scroll.
 In one corner of the room is a badly worn pencil, inscribed with
 runes.
 Lying on the ground is an old parchment map.
 There is a bedraggled and weary adventurer standing here. He is
 carrying a sword, and a brass lantern. He seems pleased to see you and
 frequently smiles in your direction.
 The adventurer stoops over and picks up the map.

>ask adventurer for map

 The adventurer, not seeing any use in keeping the map anyway, hands it
 to you gladly.
 The adventurer waves at you and asks "Hello, Sailor?" Strange, you've
 never even been to sea.

>look at map

 The map consists of a drawing with nine points, each represented by a
 strange character, with interconnecting thin pencil lines. Using your
 native alphabet, it looks like this:

 Fork
 You stand at a point of decision on a road which makes a wide fork to
 the northeast and southeast, circling the base of the Lonely Mountain,
 which looms high overhead to the east. A very long and winding road
 starts here and stretches out of sight to the west through low, smoky
 hills.

 Trail
 The trail turns a corner here, bending out of sight to the southeast
 and southwest. The ground is higher here than to the south, allowing
 you to make out the top of the Lonely Mountain, shrouded in clouds. No
 path from here leads up the mountain, however.

 Trail Head
 You are on the northeast side of the Lonely Mountain, walking a narrow
 path through rolling hills. On one side of the path is a sign and
 behind that, to the northeast, a winding path through the thick
 undergrowth. The trail continues to the southeast.

 Shady Brook
 The trail ends here. A ruined stone foundation marks the site of the
 Old Lingolf House, which presumably was a monument of some sort. The
 trail head is off to the southwest, and a small brook flows slowly by.

 You are on a road which enters a small village to the southwest and
 comes to a fork to the northeast. The Lonely Mountain looms above but
 there is no path from here which ascends the mountain.

 You can't go that way.

>go southwest
 Deserted Village
 This is the castle's village. Formerly, peasants lived here, going to
 their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of
 cultural activity. But now it's deserted. Or almost: there is smoke
 rising from a particularly decrepit hovel to the south. A path travels
 through the village from southwest to northeast, heading towards the
 castle, and a less-used trail heads north up the mountain.

>in
 It is dark and smoky in here, but this is a place of great disorder,
 and its odor is indescribable. A pile of rags sits near a small pot
 which is bubbling and steaming over a tiny fire. The pile of rags
 sports a gnarled hand which busies itself with the noisome stew. A
 closer look reveals a withered crone at the other end of the hand.

 The creature looks you over keenly and speaks: "I should have thought
 they would send someone more ... more ..." She laughs in an unsettling
 way. "They've all left! A great storm is brewing in the east, my
 friend, and all have fled before it!" She starts to chuckle. "Take this
 and begone!" With a wave of her hand, you find yourself reeling out of
 the door of the hovel, holding some sort of scroll in your hand.

>gnusto rezrov.ne.ne.e.e.learn rezrov. rezrov gate
 Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of

 However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word

>lie
 The bed is very comfortable and soft. In fact, you feel sort of sleepy
 just lying on it.

>sleep
 You're not all that tired, but the bed is very comfortable.
 You fall asleep quickly, the bed being so comfortable. You dream as
 well, of this very room. A beautiful damsel, obviously noble, is
 standing by the bed holding a scroll in one hand and resting the other
 on the bedpost. Turning to block your view, she does something you
 can't see. Then she gets in bed and turns out the light, but before she
 does you can see she is no longer carrying the scroll... You wake.

>stand
 Ah, that was a comfortable bed! But you're now on your own feet again.

>push button. get all
 The bedpost pops open, revealing a small compartment and, nestled
 inside, a gold leaf scroll!

 fourposter feather bed: It would take more magic than you've got!

>get scroll. read it
 Taken.
 Your mouth is getting rather dry.

 The scroll reads "vaxum spell: make a hostile creature your friend".

>gnusto vaxum
 Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of
 the vaxum spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book
 itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However,

 South Hall
 The damp corridor continues east and west from here. A dark and
 forbidding stairway leads down to the south. In addition, a narrow
 passage leads to the north.

 Dungeon
 A dank and forgotten pit contains the dungeons. There is a cell to the
 north, and a partly blocked passage leads even deeper into the earth.
 It looks as if there was once a mortared stone wall blocking this
 passage, but it has crumbled and collapsed, reopening the tunnel.

>go north
 The cell door is closed.

>open door.n.move block
 The door is very rusty and reluctantly opens.

 Cell
 This is a damp and unhealthy dungeon cell with writing on the walls.
 The rusty door of the cell is open.
 You are becoming quite thirsty.

 You pull the block out of the crumbling wall, revealing a dark passage
 leading east.
 You hear, almost beyond your hearing, the soft rattle of chains, and a
 cold wind blows over the back of your neck.

>go east
 Secret Passage
 This is a crudely carved secret passage. It appears to have been
 hollowed out by (perhaps) generations of prisoners. A passage leads
 west. A short, crudely hewn passage leads up.
 Lying near the door is a silver spoon, discarded by the prisoners as
 too soft to dig with. It is only slightly worn.
 Lying on the ground, and slightly damaged, is a stained scroll.

 Library
 This is a library, or rather it was until it was ransacked and
 despoiled. Most of the contents of the room have been burned in a huge
 bonfire in the center of the room. Hundreds of charred and empty tubes
 are scattered about, as if by someone searching, so ashes are strewn
 about. There are rat tracks in the ashes.
 To the south you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural voices.
 Amid the tubes is an old and dusty book.
 The low, guttural voices seem to be coming in your direction.

 Guarded Door
 A more incongruous place than this would be difficult to believe. The
 room itself is nothing more than a small room at the base of the
 northeast tower with a narrow passageway entering from the west.
 Standing in front of you to the north, however, is a door surpassing
 anything you could have imagined. For starters, its massive lock is
 wrapped in a dozen six-inch thick iron chains. In addition, a certain
 five-headed monster sporting razor-sharp spears for tongues seems to be
 imbedded within its heavy oak frame. One is almost embarrassed to
 mention the gargoyles spewing flame and sulphurous ash which ornament
 either side of the door, or the ninety-seven slimy groping tentacles
 which taunt you ever closer to certain death. A sign, floating serenely
 above the door and glowing hideously in purple letters, offers the
 following rude understatement: "Don't Bother".

 The adventurer glances around the room in a businesslike way and makes
 a few notes on his map.
 The adventurer eyes your possessions intently.

>point at door
 As you motion toward the monstrous door, the adventurer follows the
 imaginary line which proceeds thence from your outstretched arm.

 The seemingly fearless adventurer shrugs and walks purposefully toward
 the door, ignoring all harm to his person in the form of knives,
 tentacles, and molten lead. As three buckets of the latter pour over
 his head, he casts you a perplexed look.
 "Did you try the doorknob?" he asks, as twenty-seven knives delicately
 skewer him.
 Before you can answer, he reaches for one of the gargoyle heads which,
 by sheerest coincidence, has just flooded him in red-orange flame, and
 turns it gently.
 "I think it's unlocked," he says, stoically ignoring the host of
 human-sized rats which feed on his incinerated torso.
 His left hand, broken and bloodied, pulls at the gargoyle head.
 "I'm going on ahead!" he cries, opening a simple wooden door.
 Wooden door? You rub your eyes for a moment and look again as he goes
 through it. Yes, just a plain wooden door.

>open door
 It is already open.
 A bedraggled adventurer walks into the room from the north, coming
 through the simple wooden door.

>go up
 The adventurer, proceeding cautiously, follows you. He seems to be

 Map Room
 This room in the high tower appears to be a map room, with hundreds of
 ancient maps covering the walls. A huge globe, made of gold, sits on a
 pedestal in the center of the room. Through the tower windows can be
 seen a vast forest stretching out to the northeast and the sea, covered
 in fog, to the east and south. Stairs to the south lead to the bottom
 of the tower.
 Lying on the floor is a purple scroll.
 Lying on the ground is an old parchment map.
 There is a bedraggled and weary adventurer standing here. He is
 carrying a badly worn pencil, a sword, and a brass lantern. He seems
 pleased to see you and frequently smiles in your direction.
 The adventurer asks what you would be needing treasures for.

>get pencil, map
 badly worn pencil: The adventurer, not seeing any use in keeping the

 You are becoming quite hungry.

 The adventurer stoops over and picks up the worn silver spoon and seems
 pleased by his discovery.

 The title is "My Spell Book". The book looks pretty new, and it doesn't

 the book in glowing letters, with marginal notes about how to cast them
 and what their effects are.

 My Spell Book

 The exex spell (make things move with greater speed).
 The vaxum spell (make a hostile creature your friend).
 The zifmia spell (magically summon a being).
 The krebf spell (repair willful damage).
 The cleesh spell (change a creature into a small amphibian).
 The rezrov spell (open even locked or enchanted objects).
 The blorb spell (safely protect a small object as though in a strong
 box).
 The nitfol spell (converse with the beasts in their own tongue).
 The frotz spell (cause something to give off light).
 The gnusto spell (write a magic spell into a spell book).

 Ah, sleep! It's been a long day, indeed. The rest will do you good. You
 spread your cloak on the floor and drift off, renewing your powers and
 refreshing your mind ... Time passes as you snore blissfully.

 After a while, your sleep is disturbed by a strange dream. You are
 wandering in a darkened place, for you have no light or other
 possessions. You feel that you are being watched! You are surrounded by
 faces, their eyes following you. They drift in and out, staring at you
 with proud indifference. One face, brightly lit (unlike the rest),
 draws you closer and closer. As you touch it, you wake.

 Your spell book begins to glow softly. In a spectacular effort of
 magic, the powers of the gnusto spell attempt to copy the guncho spell
 into your book, but the spell is too long, too complicated, and too
 powerful. The glow fades, but fortunately the powerful scroll remains
 intact.

 A dull aching fills your head, and your mind is again probed, more
 deeply than when you entered the castle.

>guncho presence
 As you cast the spell, the powerful scroll vanishes!
 The room fills with a horrible noise, darkens to pitch blackness, and
 then lightens. The weight of fear lifts.

 Your head is filled with a heavy sensation, as though an enormous
 weight were being borne by it. Your mind is again probed, this time
 very deeply, testing and learning. The feeling passes after a long
 moment.

 Belboz appears before you, hard and stern. "While you have quested for
 Krill's lair, the Circle has not been idle. We have tried to shield
 your presence from him, but your use of such a powerful spell might
 endanger us all! As we have sensed it, so surely must Krill! Be
 careful, brave Enchanter!" His image fades.

 This is a rocky beach along a grey and lifeless sea. There is dead
 seaweed covering many rocks, and listless waves barely stir the flotsam

 The darkening sky is lit by a waning moon.
 Crawling slowly along the beach is an enormous turtle, his enamelled

 Engine Room
 The room is filled with noise: crashing and smashing, gurgling of
 water, grinding of gears, and horrible screeching of metal. Huge
 devices of obscure purpose provide these effects. The most notable is a
 huge hammer that smashes continually against the stone floor: it makes
 any crossing of the room a dangerous enterprise. The whole construction
 brings to mind the words "Infernal Machine." Far off to the southeast
 is another room. You can barely make out something on the floor of that
 room. It might be a scroll, but from here you can't tell for sure.

 Too fast, in fact. You can't dodge them, and you are severely skewered.

 The darkened sky is now full of bright stars. It is night.

 "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor.

>cleesh me
 You are turned into a newt, and scurry off to find your friends in the
 swamp. You are distracted by various yummy insects along the way, but
 eventually settle into a nice gooey part of the morass and live happily
 ever after, at least until you are devoured by a heron.

 Your score is 145 of a possible 400, in 445 moves.

 East Hall
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 This short piece of corridor continues to the north and south.
 There is a bedraggled and weary adventurer standing here. He is
 carrying a dusty book, a beautiful, ornamented egg, a worn silver
 spoon, a sword, and a brass lantern.
 The adventurer leaves the room, heading to the north.
 Your stomach is starting to grumble.

>go north
 Banquet Hall
 This desolate hall is nearly empty, save for a few long benches which
 are scattered throughout the room. The walls seem to be scorched, and
 everywhere are signs of decay. A sickening odor pervades the room, and
 wisps of acrid black smoke can be seen to the north. A wide passage
 leads south, and a small one opens to the east.
 To the north you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural voices.

 The adventurer attempts to eat his sword. I don't think it would agree

>cleesh adventurer
 The adventurer turns into a fairly large newt, which scuttles off and
 is lost to sight.
 A group of four hunched and hairy shapes walks into your presence. They
 seem surprised to see you. After whispering a few guttural words to
 each other, they start to move toward you purposefully.

>go south
 East Hall
 The group of shapes follows you, intent on your capture! They seem to
 come alive in the desolation which fills this room.

>go south
 South Gate
 The group of shapes follows you into this undespoiled room, emboldened
 and eager for blood.

>se
 You can't go that way.
 The group of hunched and hairy shapes takes you in their arms and
 escorts you into a huge temple.

 A low noise begins behind you, and you turn to see hundreds of hunched
 and hairy shapes. A guttural chant issues from their throats. Near you
 stands a figure draped in a robe of deepest black, brandishing a
 vicious dagger. The chant grows louder as the robed figure approaches
 the altar. As the shapes grab you, the figure in black speaks: "Take
 the victim to the tower. I shall prepare for the sacrifice!" The
 figures, whose form you can barely guess, take you from here through
 the northern door and into a prison cell. They take your possessions
 from you and close the door with a crash!

 Cell
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil
 of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor.
 This is a small prison cell in the north tower of the temple. Hideous
 shapes can be seen through the iron-barred window in the prison door.
 From the temple, a bloodcurdling chant can be heard.

>sleep
 Ah, sleep! It's been a long day, indeed. The rest will do you good. You
 spread your cloak on the floor and drift off, renewing your powers and
 refreshing your mind ... Time passes as you snore blissfully.

 You sleep uneventfully, dreamlessly, and awake refreshed.

>go south
 Meadow
 This is a meadow near the sea. There is a smell of salt in the air.
 Only heather and thistles grow here. To the north is a gate leading
 into the castle. A narrow path to the southeast leads to the shore of
 the Sea.
 The sun has now risen above the hills.
 Your stomach is starting to grumble.

 Beach
 This is a rocky beach along a grey and lifeless sea. There is dead
 seaweed covering many rocks, and listless waves barely stir the flotsam
 and jetsam here. There are many shells, but all are broken. A narrow
 path to the northwest leads into a meadow.
 Crawling slowly along the beach is an enormous turtle, his enamelled
 shell shining with all the colors of the rainbow.

>se
 You make it across the room, but just barely; just as you duck through
 the door, a huge hammer crashes down behind, missing by an inch.
 Something you stepped on along the way clicked as well, and with a
 horrible screeching noise, the machinery speeds up, crashing faster and
 faster until it's twice as fast as before.

 Control Room
 Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil

 This is the control room for all the machinery nearby. The controls are
 all magical, of course. The walls are covered by blinking lights and
 shifting displays, interspersed with arcane dials and glowing buttons.
 It's all very mysterious looking. The exit, to the northwest, leads
 into a room with machinery which would surely crush you if you were to
 attempt to enter it.
 A scroll of old, brittle parchment is here.

 Engine Room
 The room is filled with noise: crashing and smashing, gurgling of
 water, grinding of gears, and horrible screeching of metal. Huge
 devices of obscure purpose provide these effects. The most notable is a
 huge hammer that smashes continually against the stone floor: it makes
 any crossing of the room a dangerous enterprise. The whole construction
 brings to mind the words "Infernal Machine." Far off to the southeast
 is another room. You can barely make out something on the floor of that
 room. It might be a scroll, but from here you can't tell for sure.

 The first page of the book was the table of contents. Only two chapter
 names can be read: The Legend of the Unseen Terror and The Legend of
 the Great Implementers.
 "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor.

>read unseen terror
 This legend, written in an ancient tongue, goes something like this: At
 one time a shapeless and formless manifestation of evil was disturbed
 from millenia of sleep. It was so powerful that it required the
 combined wisdom of the leading enchanters of that age to conquer it.
 The legend tells how the enchanters lured the Terror "to a recess deep
 within the earth" by placing there a powerful spell scroll. When it had
 reached the scroll, the enchanters trapped it there with a spell that
 encased it in the living rock. The Terror was so horrible that none
 would dare speak of it. A comment at the end of the narration indicates
 that the story is considered to be quite fanciful; no other chronicles
 of the age mention the Terror in any form.
