                              THE WEDDING
                            By Neil J Brown
                         [Press space to begin]








 "You are cordially invited to the wedding of Deborah and Malcolm at St
 Jude's Church, Westlowe at 2.30pm." And, scrawled in the corner in
 what looks like your ex-flatmate Malcolm's handwriting: "Don't forget
 the paracetamol!"

 So far so bad. You're no lover of weddings with egotistical aunts and
 uncles and squealing, hyperactive kids, but you were prepared to put
 up with it to see your old college chum get hitched. Now, though,
 things have taken a turn for the worse with a phone call from a posh
 sounding woman. "I understand you're a friend of Malcolm's" stated the
 voice on the phone. "You must come over here at once, and try to sort
 out this mess...". So that's why you find yourself tearing down the
 motorway towards Westlowe and the mysterious D'Arcy manor...

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

 You can see a security guard here.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

 As good-looking as ever.

>examine guard
 Gone are the charming doormen of yesteryear, to be replaced by
 nasty-looking guards from private security firms. This chappy is no
 different, in his stark navy blue uniform and peaked cap. He seems to
 have taken a particular dislike to you, though, and watches you
 carefully, a sneer on his face.

>talk to guard
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>guard, hi
 He stares at you but doesn't say anything.

 You can't see any such thing.

>go south
 That way only leads out of the estate, and you've still got a lot of
 interfering to do yet.

>go north
 "Oi! Where do you think you're going?" The guard takes great delight
 in rugby-tackling you to the floor and dragging you back out onto the
 pebbled car park. "Authoria... Authiroz... authorthised... proper
 people only!". You've probably just made his day.

 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>ask guard about authorised people
 "Your name's not down, you're not coming in."

>tell name to guard
 You can't see any such thing.

>tell guard about me
 He stares at you but doesn't say anything.

>tell guard about my name
 He stares at you but doesn't say anything.

 Sunshine momentarily bursts out through the grey cloud cover.

>ask guard about malcolm
 The guard affects a curiously blank expression.

>examine alarm
 From here, all you can see is a white box with the name of a security
 company on it. A blue light flickers intermittently on its side,
 suggesting that it is active.

>read alarm

 Sunshine momentarily bursts out through the grey cloud cover.

>ask guard about alarm
 "That's a special alarm, that is - it goes off when vulnerable doors
 and windows are smashed, so don't try anything, right?"

 You see nothing special about the gravel drive.

>examine rock
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east
 You make your way around the eastern side of the house, and find
 yourself at...

 The patio outside the back of the house
 A grand patio made from powder-orange slabs links the back of the
 house, which is to your south, with a beautiful garden to the north,
 beyond a gate. You look up at the house, and see a number of
 unrecognisable people pacing about at various windows. A grey-slabbed
 path runs around both sides of the house back to the front.

 The gate to the north is closed.

 The grey sky overhead turns a little darker, threatening rain.

>examine path
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine garden
 A simple and elegant gate, leading north to the gardens. It is
 currently closed.

>open gate
 You open the garden gate.

 The grey sky overhead turns a little darker, threatening rain.

>go north

 Garden path
 A simple pathway, immaculately tiled, leads north. Flower beds
 surround you, beautifully arranged, in every colour of the rainbow,
 and to the north east you can see a great apple tree.

 The gate to the south is open.

 By the side of the path, among the flowers, is a dark patch of earth.

 It looks as if someone has recently dug and filled in a hole.

>dig patch
 What do you want to dig the dark patch of earth with?

>hands
 Hands don't make good digging implements.

>examine flowers
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine tiles
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine path
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>go northeast
 The flowers are so pretty that it would be a shame to just trample all
 over them.

 You can feel a few spots of rain on your face.

>go north

 By the Crazy Golf Course
 The path from the south ends at a large crazy golf course, separated
 into several smaller sections, which all have crazy obstacle courses
 for players to putt their golf balls through in order to get to the
 hole. Flowerbeds are positioned dangerously close to the crazy course
 to the west, and a hedge blocks your progress north. You can see a
 tree (the only one in the garden, it seems) to the east.

>get ball
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east

 Corner of the garden
 You are at the north-east corner of the garden, marked by thick
 impenetrable hedges to the north and east, and a delicate flowerbed
 lies south. A single apple tree stands here; its trunk looks fragile,
 and splits prematurely into smaller branches at waist level.

>climb tree
 The tree is too weak to climb.

>shake tree
 You shake the tree, and something comes crashing down through the
 branches, hits you on the head, and lands on the grass. Isn't gravity
 the pits?

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 The patio outside the back of the house

 The gate to the north is open.

 You can feel a few spots of rain on your face.

>throw apple at window
 Which do you mean, the attic window vent or the bathroom window?

>examine vent
 A tiny window which, you presume, allows only a minimal amount of
 light into the attic. Its certainly not big enough for any person to
 get through, should they lose their keys and find that that is the
 only window open. As you watch, you suddenly glimpse a flicker of
 movement, but it might just be your eyes playing tricks on you.

>examine bathroom window
 You can't really see much through the large frosted glass window, but
 there certainly isn't any movement.

 A sudden gust of wind ruffles your hair.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>throw apple at bathroom window
 You throw the apple at the bathroom window, and it hits its target
 with pinpoint accuracy, smashing a hole through the glass. The burglar
 alarm screams into action, and the poor chap who was in there at the
 time, probably trying to hide from the other guests, pops up at the
 window and stares down at you. "Stop! Burglar!" he yells, not
 considering the fact that it would be extremely stupid of a real
 burglar to smash an upstairs window when two whole families were in
 the manor.

 That doesn't really matter now, because the security guard, having
 heard the yelling, charges round from the front of the building and
 grabs you virtually from the scruff of the neck. "Right, you, you're
 nicked!" he bellows triumphantly.

 Soon, the police arrive, and you are carted off to the station to
 explain yourself. By the time Malcolm arrives to bail you out, it is
 too late to save the wedding - it has been called off permanently.

 Some would say that this is a victory, but alas, as far as this game
 is concerned...


     *** you have failed ***


 In that game you scored 1 out of a possible 20, in 35 turns, earning

 [Previous turn undone.]

>throw apple at vent
 You throw the apple at the small window vent, and grin with pride to
 see it hit its target perfectly and shatter the glass. Suddenly, the
 burglar alarm screams out, and the sounds of general panic can be
 heard from inside. Spookily, though, no one looks out at you from the
 windows, and the security guard does not appear.

 Strange, really, as you could have sworn you saw movement behind the
 vent. You'd have thought the person up there would have given the game
 away.

 As for the apple, well, it looks like you won't get to enjoy that
 tangy fruit flavour after all.

 Sunshine momentarily bursts out through the grey cloud cover.

 You can hear an alarm screeching.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

 It is a simple push bell painted gold.

 Passage
 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 Scamp, the family dog, sits and whines, his lead tied to a door
 handle.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

 You can hear the security guard moving about close by...

 You release Scamp and he shows his appreciation by leaping up at you
 and licking your face. You quickly rise from crouching, not really
 liking the idea of dog saliva on your cheeks, and Scamp quickly loses
 interest in you.

 An alarm screeches from somewhere outside the house.

 By the sound of it, the security guard is getting closer...

>go north

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 "Damn nuisance, eh? Still, I might get a chance to nip out for a game

 An alarm screeches from somewhere outside the house.

 The security guard marches neatly up to you and seizes you by the
 collar. "The alarm might have been playing up," he says, "but at least
 I've found myself another intruder!" To your great relief, he doesn't
 beat you up or call the police, but rather ejects you out onto the car
 park. "And don't try to sneak back in, understood?"

 You are in a glorious oak-panelled room, with a large fireplace to one

 I only understood you as far as wanting to switch the television.

 With a lot of effort, the video recorder wakes up and starts playing
 the tape.

>ask chloe for remote
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine tv
 The television is large, with a wide screen and large speakers at
 either side. You can see a power switch but not the means to change
 channels - maybe that is done with a remote control.

 The television is currently switched on.

 You catch a moment of dialogue from the Australian soap opera playing

 The cover depicts a seaside pier in silouette, with a
 disproportionately large full moon behind it. "The Vampire Brood of
 Bognor Regis" reads the title, "by the acclaimed author Floella Witt".

 Drawing room
 You are in a glorious oak-panelled room, with a large fireplace to one
 side. This is where the family relaxes, assuming that such a monstrous
 family relaxes at all. An antique-style telephone rests on the
 mantelpiece, and a large hi-tech widescreen television sits on a video
 recorder in the corner. From here, you observe exits to the east and
 northeast.

 A young woman called Chloe sits nearby reading a book.

 The video recorder is making a whirring sound.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

>ask mother about wedding
 "It's all gone to pot," she wails. "Oh my oh my! My poor dear
 daughter, whatever will she do!" She then mumbles something else which
 you don't quite catch.

>go east

 Study
 This room has the air of a gentleman's private study area, though
 recently it appears to have been taken over by the lady of the house
 (that is, Sheryl D'Arcy). A hardboard set of shelves against one wall
 looks completely out of place amid the antique furniture and the
 gorgeous circular shaped painting on the ceiling. Embroidery rests on
 a pouffe to one side, and several packs of wool tower alongside the
 shelves. The front entrance is out to the west, and there is another
 room to the north.

 Barbara, an aunt of the bride, sits on an armchair with her legs
 crossed and her hands interlocked.

 "BARBARA FRANKLYN, Aunt of the bride, and mother to Chloe. Barbara is
 a moderately successful artist and sculptor, and has won numerous
 awards. She brought up Chloe singlehandedly, refusing to name Chloe's
 father."

>examine shelves
 That's merely background furniture - you don't need to worry about it.

>ask barbara about chloe
 Barbara notices you for the first time, having been in deep thought.
 "You must be Malcolm's friend," she says in the voice you recognise as
 being the one at the other end of the phone. "I can't really tell you
 anything, but you must make sure that Malcolm and Deborah get married
 today." She produces a key from her jacket pocket and places it on a
 table. "That might come in handy. I don't know what it opens; I just
 took it from the key holder at the entrance."

 Barbara leans back in her chair and lets her mind drift off to other
 things.

>take key
 Taken.

>thank barbara
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine key
 It is small and unremarkable.

>ask barbara about malcolm
 She leans forward and places a hand on your arm to stress her point.
 "You must ensure that Deborah and Malcolm are married today. I can't
 tell you any more than that." You ask why not, but Barbara gives you a
 mysterious look and settles back into her chair.

>ask barbara about chloe
 "I think black looks really good on her, don't you?"

>ask barbara about house
 "I'm sorry," she says. "I'm afraid I know little about that."

>ask barbara about me
 "Oh, I just know you can save this wedding," she says, a mischievous
 twinkle in her eye.

>ask barbara about herself
 "I'm sorry," she says. "I'm afraid I know little about that."

>ask barbara about albert
 "I'm sorry," she says. "I'm afraid I know little about that."

 The painstakingly detailed image, made of small strands of thread,
 portrays a woman zapping a man with her laser-beam eyes.

>examine ceiling
 You see nothing special about the ceiling.

>move embroidery
 Nothing obvious happens.

>take it
 Reaching for the embroidery, you are suddenly overcome with memories
 of the vicious needlework teacher at school who humiliated you in
 front of the entire class for making a mistake with the tea cosy you
 were attempting. You quickly pull your hand back.

>go north

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

>examine books
 The two shelves between them span the entire length of the room, and
 go from the floor to the ceiling. The books don't appear to be in any
 order, and it would be too daunting to try to find anything specific
 if not for an index someone has had the presence of mind to compile.
 It is a small box with a number of cards inside, and you must look up
 particular titles individually.

>look up battlebase in index
 The Battlebase Episode Guide is two books out of place, suggesting
 that someone has recently had a look at it. The cover has been coated
 in plastic and feels nice and smooth to your hands.

>read episode guide
 This book contains all you should ever want to know about the sci-fi
 show Battlebase (and probably a few hundred pages more). You will have
 to consult the book in more detail for specific items.

 Unfortunately, the enemy choose this time to attack the Caradeen and

 You can't seem to find that in the guide; oh well, probably not worth

 peaceful as he first thought. Soon, he find himself in the middle of a
 revolution, which the leaders of the planet intend to crush."

 Passage
 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 Scamp, the family dog, sits and whines, his lead tied to a door
 handle.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

>go west
 You can't, since the cellar door is in the way.

>unlock door with key
 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

>examine cellar door
 A solid metal door with the word CELLAR etched into the surface. It
 has an electronic lock.

>examine lock
 Four LEDS flicker excitedly on the lock, but it isn't immediately
 apparent how to activate it. A sticker on one side states that it is
 tamper-proof.

>go north

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

>go north
 You can't, since the hall door is in the way.

>open door
 It seems to be locked.

>unlock door with key
 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>go east

 Kitchen
 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,
 a swing-door leads into the dining hall, and the main exit is to the
 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

>go south

 Pantry
 Should Luxembourg ever suffer a famine, they need only raid this
 pantry to ensure that their citizens don't starve. The fruit,
 vegetables, meat, ingredients and drinks are all stored using
 technology that would put Nasa's space programme to shame. There is a
 tradesman's entrance to the east, but the main exit is to the north.

>go east
 The door won't open.

 Landing
 The top of the staircase ends in the middle of the landing which
 stretches to the east and west. An interesting painting, with striking
 use of deep blues and bright reds, hangs on an otherwise drab wall,
 and opposite, to the south, a large window allows light to flood onto
 the stairs.

>examine painting
 The effect is interesting, like a little comic strip without the white
 boxes to separate the action. A woman in bright pink, surrounded by
 deep blue ocean, suddenly bursts into red flame and attempts to
 destroy the world. She is thwarted by the water. Freud would have
 loved to have met the artist, whose initials are 'SAD'. Actually, now
 that you look at it, it appears to be a little lopsided, as if it was
 put up in a rush.

>look behind it
 You find nothing of interest.

>move it
 You are unable to.

>take it
 It is firmly attached to the wall - not simply hung by a nail as you
 originally thought.

>pull it
 You are unable to.

>open it
 That's not something you can open.

>turn it
 You turn the painting forty-five degrees clockwise, and a door you
 hadn't been aware of springs open in the north wall. The painting
 swivels back into its original position.

>go north
 A staircase at the other side of the door takes you up to...

 Spacious attic
 The attic has been converted into rather a spacious, if bare, room. A
 naked light bulb hangs from the ceiling, spilling light on the various
 cardboard boxes and general bricabrac. In the sloping roof is a small
 broken window-vent, and a staircase leads down.

 In one corner is your friend Malcolm, bound and gagged, pleading with
 his eyes for you to release him.

 You can also see a cooking apple here.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine malcolm
 He is bound and gagged, and saying "Mffffmmmffumffmmmf!". I think he
 is trying to tell you to release him.

>kiss malcolm
 You can't do that; it would be too much for Malcolm's macho pride to
 bear.

>untie malcolm
 You untie your friend, and help him to his feet. He seems a little
 shaky, but then, had you just spent a long time tied up in the attic,
 you would be too.

 "Thanks, mate," he says. "I was just coming up the stairs early this
 morning when someone jumped me from behind and knocked me out. I came
 to up here."

 It seems that someone is out to wreck this wedding - but who? Malcolm
 doesn't know, and he can't face Deborah until he can give her a proper
 explanation.

 "ALBERT HARDCASTLE, uncle of the groom, is a famous sociologist and
 keen golfer. He wishes his brother would join the twentieth century
 and stop fussing so much over female vicars."

>go east
 You stride off down the corridor towards the east, passing a few rooms
 where hideous relatives pace up and down within. They are best
 avoided, you think, so you don't stop until you reach the...

 East end
 The east end of the landing is pretty unremarkable in itself, but a
 door to the north demands your immediate attention - painted pink,
 with a picture of a teddy bear holding a sign reading 'Deborah'. There
 are also less interesting rooms to the east and south.

>go north

 Deborah's bedroom
 This room offers refuge from the tastelessness that seems to prevail
 around the rest of the house. Framed pictures of famous film
 actresses, Garland, Dietrich, Midler and Streisand in particular, hang
 proudly on the sky-blue walls, alongside two extra-large pink and red
 ribbons. The abundance of style extends to the curtains, the most
 attractive you have ever seen. If only the rest of the house, to the
 south, had been decorated as well as this.

 Deborah, the bride, sits on her bed flicking through an old issue of
 Cooee! magazine.

>ask deborah about wedding
 "Sorry, haven't you heard? The wedding's off. The lovely groom's done
 a bunk."

>ask deborah about enemies
 "Sorry, I don't know anything about that."

>ask deborah about malcolm
 "Who's he? Never heard of him." Her tone betrays a vein of bitterness.

>examine cooee
 Contained within are such thrilling features as a look inside the
 house of Mr and Mrs Showbiz Jake Finiky and Ruth Marmelade, fifty ways
 of telling if your partner is addicted to tap water, and a recipe for
 a very pretty but seemingly inedible dish.

>deborah, s
 You haven't solved the mystery yet. You shouldn't drag Deborah away
 from her room until you have the answers.

 Store room
 You are surprised how different this room is to all the others in the
 house - bland white walls and bare floorboards give it the 'recently
 added extension' look, which isn't appropriate. Cardboard boxes full
 of junk have been dumped in a corner. There is nowhere to go from here
 but out west to the landing.

 You can see a plastic supermarket bag (which is empty) here.

 Guest bedroom
 This room is quite small and cramped, with the single bed in the
 corner taking up most of the room. Definitely not a place for
 cat-swinging; indeed, you can't see any cat hairs on the thick rug of
 a carpet. A wardrobe has been squeezed into the room as well, and by
 the look of it (and the smell of it), one of the Aunts is taking up
 this room.

 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

 The bed is quite tall and narrow compared to yours, and has been made

 stuck it under that bed when he visited the house on one occasion,
 hoping Deborah would find it.

 with a picture of a teddy bear holding a sign reading 'Deborah'. There
 are also less interesting rooms to the east and south.

>go west

 Landing
 The top of the staircase ends in the middle of the landing which
 stretches to the east and west. An interesting painting, with striking
 use of deep blues and bright reds, hangs on an otherwise drab wall,
 and opposite, to the south, a large window allows light to flood onto
 the stairs.

 A door stands open in the north wall.

 In an attempt to steer clear of people you have no intention of

 West end
 The west end of the landing ends here with a small window which
 enables you to look out on the tiled pathway and the gardens outside.
 The bathroom door lies north, and another (closed) door prevents you
 from going south.

>look through window
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine window
 You gaze out of the window at the huge garden, its distant border
 marked by a row of imposing trees. The marquee for the reception will
 be erected here soon, assuming it hasn't already been cancelled.

>go north
 You can't, since the bathroom door is in the way.

>open bathroom door
 You try the handle, but the door is locked from the inside it seems.

>go south
 The door is locked. You try knocking, but there is no answer, and
 besides, you get the impression that you are barking up the wrong tree
 here.

>unlock door with key
 (first taking the small brass key)

 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

 A man's voice shouts from within, "Go away, I'm sulking!".

 A door stands open in the north wall.

 A staircase at the other side of the door takes you up to...

 Spacious attic
 The attic has been converted into rather a spacious, if bare, room. A
 naked light bulb hangs from the ceiling, spilling light on the various
 cardboard boxes and general bricabrac. In the sloping roof is a small
 broken window-vent, and a staircase leads down.

 Your old college chum Malcolm hovers close by.

 You can also see a cooking apple here.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

>examine painting
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

 Drawing room
 You are in a glorious oak-panelled room, with a large fireplace to one
 side. This is where the family relaxes, assuming that such a monstrous
 family relaxes at all. An antique-style telephone rests on the
 mantelpiece, and a large hi-tech widescreen television sits on a video
 recorder in the corner. From here, you observe exits to the east and
 northeast.

 A young woman called Chloe sits nearby reading a book.

>go northeast

 Passage
 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 Scamp, the family dog, sits and whines, his lead tied to a door
 handle.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

>go east

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

>unlock door with key
 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>look in jugs
 You don't need to play with the jugs, and you don't need the criminal
 record either.

 They have an amateurish appearance, and don't command your attention

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

 You can feel a few spots of rain on your face.

>go north
 "Oi! Where do you think you're going?" The guard takes great delight
 in rugby-tackling you to the floor and dragging you back out onto the

 heard that line on an old episode of The Bill and has desperately
 longed for an opportunity to say it since.

 A sudden gust of wind ruffles your hair.

>go east
 You make your way around the eastern side of the house, and find
 yourself at...

 The patio outside the back of the house
 A grand patio made from powder-orange slabs links the back of the
 house, which is to your south, with a beautiful garden to the north,
 beyond a gate. You look up at the house, and see a number of
 unrecognisable people pacing about at various windows. A grey-slabbed
 path runs around both sides of the house back to the front.

 The gate to the north is open.

>go north

 Garden path
 A simple pathway, immaculately tiled, leads north. Flower beds
 surround you, beautifully arranged, in every colour of the rainbow,
 and to the north east you can see a great apple tree.

 The gate to the south is open.

 By the side of the path, among the flowers, is a dark patch of earth.

>dig patch with spade
 You dig a hole in the ground, stopping when the spade seems to hit
 something.

 By the Crazy Golf Course
 The path from the south ends at a large crazy golf course, separated
 into several smaller sections, which all have crazy obstacle courses
 for players to putt their golf balls through in order to get to the
 hole. Flowerbeds are positioned dangerously close to the crazy course
 to the west, and a hedge blocks your progress north. You can see a
 tree (the only one in the garden, it seems) to the east.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

 You release Scamp and he shows his appreciation by leaping up at you

 Kitchen
 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,

 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

 coldly.

 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

>score
 You have so far scored 6 out of a possible 20, in 304 turns, earning
 you the rank of Amateur Dabbler.

 You find nothing of interest.

 Scamp sniffs at your hands for food.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

 Scamp trots off to the west.

 Drawing room
 You are in a glorious oak-panelled room, with a large fireplace to one
 side. This is where the family relaxes, assuming that such a monstrous
 family relaxes at all. An antique-style telephone rests on the
 mantelpiece, and a large hi-tech widescreen television sits on a video
 recorder in the corner. From here, you observe exits to the east and
 northeast.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,
 a swing-door leads into the dining hall, and the main exit is to the
 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

 The Chef tries chasing Scamp out of the kitchen, but Scamp easily
 avoids her, rapidly wagging his tail.

 Scamp examines what you are offering, but turns away, disappointed
 that it isn't edible.

 Scamp trots off to the south.

 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

 Pantry
 Should Luxembourg ever suffer a famine, they need only raid this
 pantry to ensure that their citizens don't starve. The fruit,
 vegetables, meat, ingredients and drinks are all stored using
 technology that would put Nasa's space programme to shame. There is a
 tradesman's entrance to the east, but the main exit is to the north.

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

>sit on chair
 You get onto the throne-like chair.

 It looks to be in such good condition that you suspect that people

 A sturdy table, polished to such an extent that you can see your face
 reflected on the surface.

>examine candles
 The lamps provide light in the room.

>open curtains
 You don't need to play with the curtains in this room.

>examine index
 The two shelves between them span the entire length of the room, and
 go from the floor to the ceiling. The books don't appear to be in any
 order, and it would be too daunting to try to find anything specific
 if not for an index someone has had the presence of mind to compile.
 It is a small box with a number of cards inside, and you must look up
 particular titles individually.

>stand
 You get off the throne-like chair.

 "DEBORAH D'ARCY, bride. Born in 1971, Deborah was wrapped in so much
 cotton wool by her parents Sheryl and Jerry while growing up that many
 people thought she wouldn't recognise the real world if it crashed
 through her bedroom ceiling. But Deborah somehow managed to turn out
 as a charming, realistic and down-to-earth young lady, which has only
 fuelled rumours that she must have been adopted. Deborah met her
 future to-be husband after crashing her car into his on a cold winters
 morning."

 "SHERYL & JERRY D'ARCY, extremely rich parents of the bride.
 Originally using Jerry's surname Franklyn, they changed to Sheryl's
 maiden name when she inherited the impressive D'Arcy manor off her
 eccentric uncle. They won most of their great wealth a week later on
 the National Lottery. Fortune has smiled on them rather a lot lately."

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one

>go up

 Landing
 The top of the staircase ends in the middle of the landing which
 stretches to the east and west. An interesting painting, with striking
 use of deep blues and bright reds, hangs on an otherwise drab wall,
 and opposite, to the south, a large window allows light to flood onto
 the stairs.

 A door stands open in the north wall.

>go north

 A staircase at the other side of the door takes you up to...

 Spacious attic
 The attic has been converted into rather a spacious, if bare, room. A
 naked light bulb hangs from the ceiling, spilling light on the various
 cardboard boxes and general bricabrac. In the sloping roof is a small
 broken window-vent, and a staircase leads down.

 Your old college chum Malcolm hovers close by.

>show letter to malcolm
 "Oh, I wrote that ages ago," remembers Malcolm nostalgically. "It was
 when we'd only begun courting. I was staying over, in the spare room
 because Deborah's parents wouldn't allow any hanky-panky. I hid it
 under the bed, hoping that Deborah would find it. I don't think she's
 ever seen that, actually."

 East end

 door to the north demands your immediate attention - painted pink,
 with a picture of a teddy bear holding a sign reading 'Deborah'. There
 are also less interesting rooms to the east and south.

>go north

 Deborah's bedroom
 This room offers refuge from the tastelessness that seems to prevail
 around the rest of the house. Framed pictures of famous film
 actresses, Garland, Dietrich, Midler and Streisand in particular, hang
 proudly on the sky-blue walls, alongside two extra-large pink and red
 ribbons. The abundance of style extends to the curtains, the most
 attractive you have ever seen. If only the rest of the house, to the
 south, had been decorated as well as this.

 Deborah, the bride, sits on her bed flicking through an old issue of
 Cooee! magazine.

>show letter to deborah
 Deborah takes the letter. As she reads it, she smiles warmly,
 remembering happy days. When she finishes, she folds it carefully and
 slips it into her pocket. "Why did he do it?" she asks sadly, and
 hands you a note she had kept hidden within the pages of one of her
 magazines.

>examine note
 A small piece of jotting paper bears a hastily scrawled message that
 might or might not be Malcolm's handwriting.

 "Dear Deborah,
 I'm sorry, but I can't go through with this. I need to go away to
 rediscover my inner self. I hope you can forgive me in time, and find
 someone else, someone who truly deserves you.

 All the best,
 Malcolm."

 Something fishy is going on, you are sure - Malcolm was never the type
 to "rediscover his inner self", and wasn't impressed by people who
 did.

 Malcolm takes and reads the note. "What?" he splutters suddenly. "This
 isn't my handwriting! I'm being stitched up here!"

 After a moment, his face seems to light up, and you can almost see a
 light bulb appear above his head. "I've got it!" he says. "The
 security guard has to sign in and out every day. I've seen him do it -
 this is his handwriting!".

 You consider going down and having a word with the guard.

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

 Sunshine momentarily bursts out through the grey cloud cover.

>ask guard about note
 You wish you had worn that jacket with the impressive shoulder pads
 now, but you stand up straight and try to look as fearsome as possible
 for the guard.

 "Okay, muggins," you say, "spill the beans, squeak, start talking,
 loosen your tongue..." Then you realise that you are getting carried
 away, and drop the tough cop act. "Why did you duff up my mate Malcolm
 and lock him in the attic?"

 The guard sneers at you. "I don't have to tell you anything. You've
 got nothing over me." You decide to make it your mission in life to
 find lots of things to hold over this horrible guard. Preferably very
 heavy things you can drop on him.

 The patio outside the back of the house
 A grand patio made from powder-orange slabs links the back of the
 house, which is to your south, with a beautiful garden to the north,
 beyond a gate. You look up at the house, and see a number of
 unrecognisable people pacing about at various windows. A grey-slabbed
 path runs around both sides of the house back to the front.

 into several smaller sections, which all have crazy obstacle courses
 for players to putt their golf balls through in order to get to the

 An ingenious idea, with only one small drawback: you can't reach the
 window from down here.

 You can feel a few spots of rain on your face.

>go north

 Garden path
 A simple pathway, immaculately tiled, leads north. Flower beds
 surround you, beautifully arranged, in every colour of the rainbow,
 and to the north east you can see a great apple tree.

 The gate to the south is open.

 A hole has been dug by the side of the path.

 The hole is half a metre deep.

 The grey sky overhead turns a little darker, threatening rain.

>go north

 By the Crazy Golf Course
 The path from the south ends at a large crazy golf course, separated
 into several smaller sections, which all have crazy obstacle courses
 for players to putt their golf balls through in order to get to the
 hole. Flowerbeds are positioned dangerously close to the crazy course
 to the west, and a hedge blocks your progress north. You can see a
 tree (the only one in the garden, it seems) to the east.

 The patio outside the back of the house
 A grand patio made from powder-orange slabs links the back of the
 house, which is to your south, with a beautiful garden to the north,
 beyond a gate. You look up at the house, and see a number of
 unrecognisable people pacing about at various windows. A grey-slabbed
 path runs around both sides of the house back to the front.

>go east

 Corner of the garden
 You are at the north-east corner of the garden, marked by thick
 impenetrable hedges to the north and east, and a delicate flowerbed
 lies south. A single apple tree stands here; its trunk looks fragile,
 and splits prematurely into smaller branches at waist level.

>examine tree
 Only the trunk and lower branches can be seen, the leaves blocking out
 your view of the rest of the tree.

>hit tree with spade
 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the large apple tree.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You attack the tree with gusto, kicking the trunk and snapping a few
 of the branches. There is a slight rustling sound from the heart of
 the branches as the tree shakes a little, but nothing else happens.

 It seems to be locked.

>go east
 You make your way around the eastern side of the house, and find
 yourself at...

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

 Spacious attic
 The attic has been converted into rather a spacious, if bare, room. A
 naked light bulb hangs from the ceiling, spilling light on the various
 cardboard boxes and general bricabrac. In the sloping roof is a small
 broken window-vent, and a staircase leads down.

 Your old college chum Malcolm hovers close by.

>go down
 You descend the stairs and pass through a door, finding yourself in
 the...

 Landing
 The top of the staircase ends in the middle of the landing which
 stretches to the east and west. An interesting painting, with striking
 use of deep blues and bright reds, hangs on an otherwise drab wall,
 and opposite, to the south, a large window allows light to flood onto
 the stairs.

 A door stands open in the north wall.

>go down

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

>go west

 Drawing room
 You are in a glorious oak-panelled room, with a large fireplace to one
 side. This is where the family relaxes, assuming that such a monstrous
 family relaxes at all. An antique-style telephone rests on the
 mantelpiece, and a large hi-tech widescreen television sits on a video
 recorder in the corner. From here, you observe exits to the east and
 northeast.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 A young woman called Chloe sits nearby reading a book.

>ask chloe about guard
 Chloe grins, thinking of something funny, but she decides that you
 don't need to know it. "Oh, he's an oaf, isn't he?"

 Scamp trots along here from the northeast and nuzzles Chloe's dangling

 engrossed in her book.

 The woman doesn't take kindly to your gentle requests, and compares
 you to a dictator before getting back to her book.

 Scamp trots off to the northeast.

 "I'm reading it," says Chloe irritably.

 Passage
 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

>go north

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 "I'd love to have a game, but these doors out to the gardens are
 locked, I'm afraid."

 "Sorry old bean, don't know much about that."

 "The cad! The bounder! The blackguard! And, no doubt, a whole lot of
 other old-fashioned cliched words as well."

 Kitchen
 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,
 a swing-door leads into the dining hall, and the main exit is to the
 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

 Pantry
 Should Luxembourg ever suffer a famine, they need only raid this
 pantry to ensure that their citizens don't starve. The fruit,
 vegetables, meat, ingredients and drinks are all stored using
 technology that would put Nasa's space programme to shame. There is a
 tradesman's entrance to the east, but the main exit is to the north.

 Her clothes look like they have been chosen in order to make sure that
 she isn't lost in the crowd during the wedding: a shocking pink suit
 is topped by a large (some would say overgrown) matching hat. She is
 wringing her hands and seems to be murmuring "oh my oh my".

>ask sheryl about jerry
 She is too busy fretting to answer.

 "He's here to make sure that no undesirables get in the house," she
 says, looking at you in a way that suggests that she's wondering how
 you managed to get in.

 She appears not to have heard you, though you can't shake the feeling
 that she considers you too lowly a person to grace with an answer.

 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

 Passage
 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

 The cellar door hangs open invitingly to the west.

 You can hear heavy footsteps nearby.

>go west

 Cellar
 Considering the high technology that has gone into guarding this area,
 the cellar is surprisingly lo-tech. One very dull fluorescent tube
 casts gloomy light over the brick walls. The air is damp; cobwebs line
 the ceiling. A tunnel disappears off into the darkness to the
 northeast, and a set of stone steps lead east up to the passageway.

 Discarded carelessly on a crate is something which declares itself to
 be a water detector.

 You can also see a security guard here.

 To your horror, and to his glee, you walk straight into the security
 guard. He takes great delight in lifting you up and ejecting you out
 of the house. "Your name's not down, you're NOT - COMING - IN!" he
 bellows.

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You don't notice the security guard bearing down on you until it is
 too late. "Gotcha!" he snarls, and drags you kicking and screaming out
 of the house. "Behave, you!" he bellows like an impatient father, and
 as you pick yourself up, you think spiteful thoughts involving the
 security guard and several tonnes of space debris falling to earth.

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,
 a swing-door leads into the dining hall, and the main exit is to the
 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy

 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

>go up

 Landing
 The top of the staircase ends in the middle of the landing which
 stretches to the east and west. An interesting painting, with striking
 use of deep blues and bright reds, hangs on an otherwise drab wall,
 and opposite, to the south, a large window allows light to flood onto
 the stairs.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 A door stands open in the north wall.

>go north

 A staircase at the other side of the door takes you up to...

 Spacious attic
 The attic has been converted into rather a spacious, if bare, room. A
 naked light bulb hangs from the ceiling, spilling light on the various
 cardboard boxes and general bricabrac. In the sloping roof is a small
 broken window-vent, and a staircase leads down.

 Your old college chum Malcolm hovers close by.

 Deborah's bedroom
 This room offers refuge from the tastelessness that seems to prevail
 around the rest of the house. Framed pictures of famous film
 actresses, Garland, Dietrich, Midler and Streisand in particular, hang
 proudly on the sky-blue walls, alongside two extra-large pink and red
 ribbons. The abundance of style extends to the curtains, the most
 attractive you have ever seen. If only the rest of the house, to the
 south, had been decorated as well as this.

 Study
 This room has the air of a gentleman's private study area, though
 recently it appears to have been taken over by the lady of the house
 (that is, Sheryl D'Arcy). A hardboard set of shelves against one wall
 looks completely out of place amid the antique furniture and the
 gorgeous circular shaped painting on the ceiling. Embroidery rests on
 a pouffe to one side, and several packs of wool tower alongside the
 shelves. The front entrance is out to the west, and there is another
 room to the north.

 Barbara, an aunt of the bride, sits on an armchair with her legs
 crossed and her hands interlocked.

 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

 Banging sounds and and cries of "let me out!" are coming from the
 cellar door.

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 You are in a glorious oak-panelled room, with a large fireplace to one
 side. This is where the family relaxes, assuming that such a monstrous
 family relaxes at all. An antique-style telephone rests on the
 mantelpiece, and a large hi-tech widescreen television sits on a video
 recorder in the corner. From here, you observe exits to the east and
 northeast.

 A young woman called Chloe sits nearby reading a book.

 You catch a moment of dialogue from the Australian soap opera playing

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides

 Drawing room
 You are in a glorious oak-panelled room, with a large fireplace to one
 side. This is where the family relaxes, assuming that such a monstrous
 family relaxes at all. An antique-style telephone rests on the
 mantelpiece, and a large hi-tech widescreen television sits on a video
 recorder in the corner. From here, you observe exits to the east and
 northeast.

 A young woman called Chloe sits nearby reading a book.

 You catch a moment of dialogue from the Australian soap opera playing
 on the television. "Isn't it odd that all the young people around here
 are gorgeous and have long blonde hair?" asks an inspired young man in
 a brief moment of clarity.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

 Scamp sits and watches you curiously.

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

 "Oi! Where do you think you're going?" The guard takes great delight

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food

 Should Luxembourg ever suffer a famine, they need only raid this

 That's not something you can open.

 Scamp looks restless but stays here for the sake of the pizza.


 Bathroom
 Copper seems to have been chosen as the main colour for the bathroom,
 and it has certainly produced an, erm, interesting effect. All the
 standard features are here: the toilet, the bath and shower, the sink,
 the cabinet etc. A frosted window prevents you from looking out onto
 the gardens properly, as the colours seem to merge together. As you
 expect, there is only one exit, and that is to the south.

 Uncle William sits on the side of the bath, mumbling something about
 his lunch being late.

 You can also see a bronze key here.

 Banging sounds and and cries of "let me out!" are coming from the
 cellar door.

>go north

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

>unlock door with bronze key
 You unlock the hall door.

>open hall door
 You open the hall door.

>ask albert about golf
 "Crazy golf? I'd love a game!" says Albert. In a surprising display of
 energy, he tears out of the house and down the garden.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go north

 The patio outside the back of the house
 A grand patio made from powder-orange slabs links the back of the
 house, which is to your south, with a beautiful garden to the north,
 beyond a gate. You look up at the house, and see a number of
 unrecognisable people pacing about at various windows. A grey-slabbed
 path runs around both sides of the house back to the front.

 The gate to the north is open.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go north

 Garden path
 A simple pathway, immaculately tiled, leads north. Flower beds
 surround you, beautifully arranged, in every colour of the rainbow,
 and to the north east you can see a great apple tree.

 The gate to the south is open.

 A hole has been dug by the side of the path.

 The flowers are so pretty that it would be a shame to just trample all
 over them.


 By the Crazy Golf Course
 The path from the south ends at a large crazy golf course, separated
 into several smaller sections, which all have crazy obstacle courses
 for players to putt their golf balls through in order to get to the
 hole. Flowerbeds are positioned dangerously close to the crazy course
 to the west, and a hedge blocks your progress north. You can see a
 tree (the only one in the garden, it seems) to the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

>play golf
 Albert remarks that he lost his last ball in a particularly exciting
 match almost a year ago, playing against the lady Mayoress. "That
 would have been before Godfrey died, of course," he ponders. "We were
 good mates even before Debs and Malc met up. You haven't got a golf
 ball, have you?"

>say no
 (to Uncle Albert)
 Albert takes a tiny sip of his brandy but doesn't say anything.

>ask albert about ball
 "Sorry old bean, don't know much about that."

 A sudden gust of wind ruffles your hair.

 "Oh no," insists Albert, "after you. You play first."

 "Ah, you mean the lovely bride? It was a minor miracle that she turned
 out as well as she did, considering that overbearing mother of hers."

 "I always thought it was a mistake on Godfrey's part to leave the
 house to Sheryl. He was always a bit of a gambler, really."

 You see nothing special about the north wall.

>look in flowerbeds
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

 You can't.

 You can feel a few spots of rain on your face.

 You can't see any such thing.

 A thick, apparently impenetrable hedge which blocks your way north.

>search hedge
 Aha! Searching the hedge, you see a little gap underneath which is
 just big enough to squeeze through.

 A sudden gust of wind ruffles your hair.

 You squeeze through the gap at the bottom of the hedge.

 The edge of a fast-flowing river
 You stand on the inside of a U-bend in a deep and fast flowing river -
 you are not sure of the name of it, since you didn't have much time to
 consult your A-to-Z on the way down, but it looks pretty much devoid
 of toxic waste and shopping trolleys. On the other side, you can see a
 field where the grass is overgrown and tall purple weeds have taken
 root. It reminds you of the wasteland behind your parents' house that
 you used to play in as a child. Anyway, the only way back is through
 the hole in the hedge to the south.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>search river
 Peering into the water, you can see a white ball just within reach.

 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>take ball
 Taken.

 The water runs slower by the side of the U-bend facing up-river, as it
 hits the bank. The rest of the river is probably too dangerous to mess
 about with.

 The ball is hard and white, and has indentations all over it. It looks
 pretty much like a golf ball should.

 That's plainly inedible.

 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

 Albert takes a tiny sip of his brandy but doesn't say anything.

>give ball to albert
 "Just pop it down on the crazy golf course."

 You put the golf ball on the crazy golf course.

 Albert produces two clubs from out of nowhere, and easily thrashes you
 at crazy golf, probably due to lots of practise on his part and lack
 of it on yours. The final segment holds a model of the Sphinx. Albert
 easily putts the ball through the small circular mouth, and in the
 process dislodges something trapped inside. (Needless to say, Albert
 beats you in this segment as well.)

 On close inspection the diamond turns out to be a poor fake, and it

 The grey sky overhead turns a little darker, threatening rain.

 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways

 There is a click. Then, with an electronic fanfare, the cellar door
 swings open.

 The security guard bolts out of the cellar, slams the door shut and
 rests against it, looking flustered. It takes him a moment to recover,
 then he gets his remote control from out of his pocket and presses a
 big red button. The cellar door shakes suddenly.

 "I've changed the lock number so don't try anything!" he warns before
 striding off back to the front entrance. Nice of him not to throw you
 out, but then, he was probably distracted.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

 He doesn't show the slightest interest.

 Study
 This room has the air of a gentleman's private study area, though
 recently it appears to have been taken over by the lady of the house
 (that is, Sheryl D'Arcy). A hardboard set of shelves against one wall
 looks completely out of place amid the antique furniture and the
 gorgeous circular shaped painting on the ceiling. Embroidery rests on
 a pouffe to one side, and several packs of wool tower alongside the
 shelves. The front entrance is out to the west, and there is another
 room to the north.

 Drawing room
 You are in a glorious oak-panelled room, with a large fireplace to one
 side. This is where the family relaxes, assuming that such a monstrous
 family relaxes at all. An antique-style telephone rests on the
 mantelpiece, and a large hi-tech widescreen television sits on a video
 recorder in the corner. From here, you observe exits to the east and
 northeast.

 A young woman called Chloe sits nearby reading a book.

 You can also see a video cassette here.

 Copper seems to have been chosen as the main colour for the bathroom,
 and it has certainly produced an, erm, interesting effect. All the
 standard features are here: the toilet, the bath and shower, the sink,

 the gardens properly, as the colours seem to merge together. As you
 expect, there is only one exit, and that is to the south.

 This room offers refuge from the tastelessness that seems to prevail
 around the rest of the house. Framed pictures of famous film
 actresses, Garland, Dietrich, Midler and Streisand in particular, hang
 proudly on the sky-blue walls, alongside two extra-large pink and red
 ribbons. The abundance of style extends to the curtains, the most
 attractive you have ever seen. If only the rest of the house, to the

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

 The indexing system is quite primitive and only covers single words,
 so you'll have to be a bit more specific.

 Study
 This room has the air of a gentleman's private study area, though
 recently it appears to have been taken over by the lady of the house
 (that is, Sheryl D'Arcy). A hardboard set of shelves against one wall
 looks completely out of place amid the antique furniture and the
 gorgeous circular shaped painting on the ceiling. Embroidery rests on
 a pouffe to one side, and several packs of wool tower alongside the
 shelves. The front entrance is out to the west, and there is another
 room to the north.

 Barbara, an aunt of the bride, sits on an armchair with her legs
 crossed and her hands interlocked.

>go west

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways

 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the

 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

>go north

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

>go north

 The patio outside the back of the house
 A grand patio made from powder-orange slabs links the back of the
 house, which is to your south, with a beautiful garden to the north,
 beyond a gate. You look up at the house, and see a number of
 unrecognisable people pacing about at various windows. A grey-slabbed
 path runs around both sides of the house back to the front.

 The gate to the north is open.

>go north

 Garden path
 A simple pathway, immaculately tiled, leads north. Flower beds
 surround you, beautifully arranged, in every colour of the rainbow,
 and to the north east you can see a great apple tree.

 The gate to the south is open.

 A hole has been dug by the side of the path.

>go north

 By the Crazy Golf Course
 The path from the south ends at a large crazy golf course, separated
 into several smaller sections, which all have crazy obstacle courses
 for players to putt their golf balls through in order to get to the
 hole. Flowerbeds are positioned dangerously close to the crazy course
 to the west, and a hedge blocks your progress north. You can see a
 tree (the only one in the garden, it seems) to the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 You can see a hole under the hedge to the north which is just about
 big enough to squeeze through.

 On the crazy golf course is a golf ball.

>go east

 Kitchen
 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,
 a swing-door leads into the dining hall, and the main exit is to the
 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

 The chef stares at you, and her face turns red, but she controls
 herself and gets back to her work. She obviously doesn't like to be

 On close inspection the diamond turns out to be a poor fake, and it
 would take a really dim person to be fooled. It seems someone around
 here has a strange sense of humour.

 You are carrying:
   a video cassette
   a diamond
   a plastic supermarket bag
     a small steel key
     a bronze key
     a remote control
     a cash tin box (which is open but empty)
     a Battlebase episode guide
     a spade
     a small brass key
     a wedding programme

>look up cook in programme
 Nothing in the programme about that.

 As with all chefs, she wears white overalls and a hat which looks a
 little like an elongated white mushroom. She is busy chopping up
 vegetables, stirring things in pots and shouting at the kitchen staff.
 She has obviously received orders saying that she must be nice to the
 guests at all times; she very kindly spares you the verbal mugging she
 gives everyone else.

>ask cook about sheryl

>go south

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

 You can feel a few spots of rain on your face.

>ask guard about cook
 "I don't know nothin' about nothin'."

>ask guard about cook
 "I don't know nothin' about nothin'."

>examine guard
 Gone are the charming doormen of yesteryear, to be replaced by
 nasty-looking guards from private security firms. This chappy is no
 different, in his stark navy blue uniform and peaked cap. He seems to
 have taken a particular dislike to you, though, and watches you
 carefully, a sneer on his face.

>show box to guard
 Which do you mean, the cash tin box or the burglar alarm?

>tin

 He doesn't show the slightest interest.

 "Oi! Where do you think you're going?" The guard takes great delight
 in rugby-tackling you to the floor and dragging you back out onto the
 pebbled car park. "Authoria... Authiroz... authorthised... proper
 people only!". You've probably just made his day.

 You make your way around the western side of the house, and find
 yourself at...

 The top of the staircase ends in the middle of the landing which

 the stairs.

 A door stands open in the north wall.

 A staircase at the other side of the door takes you up to...

 Spacious attic
 The attic has been converted into rather a spacious, if bare, room. A
 naked light bulb hangs from the ceiling, spilling light on the various
 cardboard boxes and general bricabrac. In the sloping roof is a small
 broken window-vent, and a staircase leads down.

 Bathroom
 Copper seems to have been chosen as the main colour for the bathroom,
 and it has certainly produced an, erm, interesting effect. All the
 standard features are here: the toilet, the bath and shower, the sink,
 the cabinet etc. A frosted window prevents you from looking out onto
 the gardens properly, as the colours seem to merge together. As you
 expect, there is only one exit, and that is to the south.

 Uncle William sits on the side of the bath, mumbling something about

 Deborah's bedroom
 This room offers refuge from the tastelessness that seems to prevail
 around the rest of the house. Framed pictures of famous film
 actresses, Garland, Dietrich, Midler and Streisand in particular, hang
 proudly on the sky-blue walls, alongside two extra-large pink and red
 ribbons. The abundance of style extends to the curtains, the most
 attractive you have ever seen. If only the rest of the house, to the
 south, had been decorated as well as this.

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

 Scamp is about to disappear out of the front door when he stops
 suddenly, sniffs the air and decides against it.

>go east

 Study
 This room has the air of a gentleman's private study area, though
 recently it appears to have been taken over by the lady of the house
 (that is, Sheryl D'Arcy). A hardboard set of shelves against one wall
 looks completely out of place amid the antique furniture and the
 gorgeous circular shaped painting on the ceiling. Embroidery rests on
 a pouffe to one side, and several packs of wool tower alongside the
 shelves. The front entrance is out to the west, and there is another
 room to the north.

 Barbara, an aunt of the bride, sits on an armchair with her legs
 crossed and her hands interlocked.

>go north

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

 You can't see any such thing.

>look up video in index
 Unfortunately, the index doesn't have anything about that. You notice
 that the index only has a couple hundred cards, whereas the number of

 Passage
 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,

 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to

 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel

 Passage
 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

 Banging sounds and and cries of "let me out!" are coming from the
 cellar door.

 There is a click. Then, with an electronic fanfare, the cellar door
 swings open.

 The security guard bolts out of the cellar, slams the door shut and
 rests against it, looking flustered. It takes him a moment to recover,
 then he gets his remote control from out of his pocket and presses a
 big red button. The cellar door shakes suddenly.

 "I've changed the lock number so don't try anything!" he warns before
 striding off back to the front entrance. Nice of him not to throw you
 out, but then, he was probably distracted.

>hit lock
 You try knocking and thumping the lock, and suddenly jump back when an
 American-accented electronic voice bursts into action. "Warning," it
 drones, "cellar lock under attack!"

 You can hear heavy footsteps nearby.

 To your horror, and to his glee, you walk straight into the security

 of the house. "Your name's not down, you're NOT - COMING - IN!" he
 bellows.

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel

 You don't notice the security guard bearing down on you until it is

 as you pick yourself up, you think spiteful thoughts involving the

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

 You make your way around the western side of the house, and find
 yourself at...

 The patio outside the back of the house
 A grand patio made from powder-orange slabs links the back of the
 house, which is to your south, with a beautiful garden to the north,
 beyond a gate. You look up at the house, and see a number of
 unrecognisable people pacing about at various windows. A grey-slabbed

 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it

 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine

 It is a small box with a number of cards inside, and you must look up
 particular titles individually.

 By the Crazy Golf Course
 The path from the south ends at a large crazy golf course, separated
 into several smaller sections, which all have crazy obstacle courses
 for players to putt their golf balls through in order to get to the
 hole. Flowerbeds are positioned dangerously close to the crazy course
 to the west, and a hedge blocks your progress north. You can see a
 tree (the only one in the garden, it seems) to the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 You can see a hole under the hedge to the north which is just about
 big enough to squeeze through.

 On the crazy golf course is a golf ball.

 Sunshine momentarily bursts out through the grey cloud cover.

 The edge of a fast-flowing river
 You stand on the inside of a U-bend in a deep and fast flowing river -
 you are not sure of the name of it, since you didn't have much time to
 consult your A-to-Z on the way down, but it looks pretty much devoid
 of toxic waste and shopping trolleys. On the other side, you can see a
 field where the grass is overgrown and tall purple weeds have taken
 root. It reminds you of the wasteland behind your parents' house that
 you used to play in as a child. Anyway, the only way back is through
 the hole in the hedge to the south.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,
 a swing-door leads into the dining hall, and the main exit is to the
 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff

 Pantry
 Should Luxembourg ever suffer a famine, they need only raid this

 tradesman's entrance to the east, but the main exit is to the north.

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 Landing
 The top of the staircase ends in the middle of the landing which
 stretches to the east and west. An interesting painting, with striking
 use of deep blues and bright reds, hangs on an otherwise drab wall,
 and opposite, to the south, a large window allows light to flood onto
 the stairs.

 A door stands open in the north wall.


 West end
 The west end of the landing ends here with a small window which
 enables you to look out on the tiled pathway and the gardens outside.
 The bathroom door lies north, and another (closed) door prevents you

 Bathroom
 Copper seems to have been chosen as the main colour for the bathroom,
 and it has certainly produced an, erm, interesting effect. All the
 standard features are here: the toilet, the bath and shower, the sink,
 the cabinet etc. A frosted window prevents you from looking out onto
 the gardens properly, as the colours seem to merge together. As you
 expect, there is only one exit, and that is to the south.

 Uncle William sits on the side of the bath, mumbling something about
 how long it took for his lunch to be delivered.

 The cash tin box is empty.

 You can't see any such thing.

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Scamp pokes his nose through the cellar door but decides against going

 Cellar
 Considering the high technology that has gone into guarding this area,
 the cellar is surprisingly lo-tech. One very dull fluorescent tube
 casts gloomy light over the brick walls. The air is damp; cobwebs line
 the ceiling. A tunnel disappears off into the darkness to the
 northeast, and a set of stone steps lead east up to the passageway.

 Discarded carelessly on a crate is something which declares itself to
 be a water detector.

>SAVE

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>take detector
 (putting the diamond into the plastic supermarket bag to make room)
 Taken.

 It has the appearance of one of those dodgy-looking devices you find
 in novelty catalogues - a chunky cousin to the TV remote control.
 "Benson's Water Detector" reads the fancy lettering above a single
 button.

 Stamped on one side is the message "Produce of Crete", but the crate
 itself is empty. How about that, a crate from Crete.


 Tunnel
 The narrow passage ends at a wooden door barring your way northeast.
 This damp air is not good for your chest, and you are worried that the
 walls might close in or collapse around you. Must be claustrophobia.
 The main cellar, positively cosy compared to this part, is back down
 to the southwest.

 The patio outside the back of the house
 A grand patio made from powder-orange slabs links the back of the
 house, which is to your south, with a beautiful garden to the north,
 beyond a gate. You look up at the house, and see a number of
 unrecognisable people pacing about at various windows. A grey-slabbed

 By the Crazy Golf Course
 The path from the south ends at a large crazy golf course, separated
 into several smaller sections, which all have crazy obstacle courses
 for players to putt their golf balls through in order to get to the
 hole. Flowerbeds are positioned dangerously close to the crazy course
 to the west, and a hedge blocks your progress north. You can see a
 tree (the only one in the garden, it seems) to the east.

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 You can see a hole under the hedge to the north which is just about
 big enough to squeeze through.

>push detector
 Curiously, the detector pulls your arm slightly to the north.

>go north
 You squeeze through the gap at the bottom of the hedge.

 The edge of a fast-flowing river
 You stand on the inside of a U-bend in a deep and fast flowing river -
 you are not sure of the name of it, since you didn't have much time to
 consult your A-to-Z on the way down, but it looks pretty much devoid
 of toxic waste and shopping trolleys. On the other side, you can see a
 field where the grass is overgrown and tall purple weeds have taken
 root. It reminds you of the wasteland behind your parents' house that
 you used to play in as a child. Anyway, the only way back is through
 the hole in the hedge to the south.

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

>ask guard about note
 You wish you had worn that jacket with the impressive shoulder pads
 now, but you stand up straight and try to look as fearsome as possible
 for the guard.

 "Okay, muggins," you say, "spill the beans, squeak, start talking,
 loosen your tongue..." Then you realise that you are getting carried
 away, and drop the tough cop act. "Why did you duff up my mate Malcolm
 and lock him in the attic?"

 The guard sneers at you. "I don't have to tell you anything. You've
 got nothing over me." You decide to make it your mission in life to
 find lots of things to hold over this horrible guard. Preferably very
 heavy things you can drop on him.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 There is a click. Then, with an electronic fanfare, the cellar door
 swings open.

 Scamp trots off to the north.

 The security guard bolts out of the cellar, slams the door shut and
 rests against it, looking flustered. It takes him a moment to recover,
 then he gets his remote control from out of his pocket and presses a
 big red button. The cellar door shakes suddenly.

 "I've changed the lock number so don't try anything!" he warns before
 striding off back to the front entrance. Nice of him not to throw you
 out, but then, he was probably distracted.

 Grand Hall
 This vast room is presumably where the D'Arcy clan eat their meals; it
 reminds you too much of your old school dinner hall for you to feel
 entirely comfortable here. A large sturdy table sits in the centre of
 the room, surrounded by ten carefully-crafted chairs, and a set of
 antique jugs rest on stools in a small alcove in the west wall. The
 walls are covered in paintings which look impressive until you examine
 them closely and see that they are certainly not in the league of the
 great masters. The back garden is accessible via a door to the north,
 a corridor leads south, and the kitchen is through the swing doors to
 the east.

 Scamp is up to mischief here.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen staff are hard at work on the meal for the reception, and
 from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
 to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,
 a swing-door leads into the dining hall, and the main exit is to the
 southwest. A pantry lies to the south.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

>push detector
 The detector pulls your arm slightly towards one of the water taps
 here.

>examine tap
 The taps are of no consequence, unless you wish to help out with the
 catering.

>turn on tap
 That's not something you can switch.

 Scamp trots along here from the west, and is immediately spotted by
 the Chef. "Get that thing out of here!" she screams at you, as if you
 are responsible for Scamp. He stands his ground, snarling slightly,
 and the Chef turns away hurriedly and gets on with something else.

>ask chef about guard
 "All these distractions!" she screams suddenly. "How am I expected to
 work with distractions?!" You suspect that, in this case, she is being
 noisy and bad tempered in order to hide something.

>scamp, bite chef
 "Woof."

 On close inspection the diamond turns out to be a poor fake, and it
 would take a really dim person to be fooled. It seems someone around
 here has a strange sense of humour.

 Scamp trots off to the southwest.

 The chef doesn't bother looking at what you are offering; she merely

 Pantry
 Should Luxembourg ever suffer a famine, they need only raid this
 pantry to ensure that their citizens don't starve. The fruit,
 vegetables, meat, ingredients and drinks are all stored using

 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the

 This room has the air of a gentleman's private study area, though
 recently it appears to have been taken over by the lady of the house

 looks completely out of place amid the antique furniture and the
 gorgeous circular shaped painting on the ceiling. Embroidery rests on

 Outside the front entrance
 You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
 it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
 touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
 alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
 above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
 drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
 south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
 (east and west) of the house.

 You can see a security guard here.

>examine box

 From here, all you can see is a white box with the name of a security

 The television is large, with a wide screen and large speakers at

 Cellar

 Perhaps the family has just emptied the cellar, or is about to fill
 it: there certainly isn't anything of any value here at the moment,
 only an empty crate.

>examine crate
 Stamped on one side is the message "Produce of Crete", but the crate
 itself is empty. How about that, a crate from Crete.

 It might be empty, but it's still heavy. You can't move it.

>enter it
 That's not something you can enter.

 These webs have caught nothing but dust recently.

>look

 Cellar
 Considering the high technology that has gone into guarding this area,
 the cellar is surprisingly lo-tech. One very dull fluorescent tube
 casts gloomy light over the brick walls. The air is damp; cobwebs line
 the ceiling. A tunnel disappears off into the darkness to the
 northeast, and a set of stone steps lead east up to the passageway.

 Perhaps the family has just emptied the cellar, or is about to fill
 it: there certainly isn't anything of any value here at the moment,

 The narrow passage ends at a wooden door barring your way northeast.
 This damp air is not good for your chest, and you are worried that the

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.

 A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
 and chopping things up.

>ask chef about guard
 "You expect me to dish the dirt on my own brother, do you?" she
 shrieks hysterically. And then quietly: "Okay, but I want something in
 return. They say diamonds are a girl's best friend. Maybe they're
 right." She increases her volume again to scream "Now stop distracting
 me!"

>give diamond to chef
 (first taking the diamond)
 She quickly pockets the diamond, and gets back to work as if she has
 forgotten your agreement.

>ask chef about guard
 "All right, all right!" she says. "Just remind him about Dartmoor, and
 he'll be sweet as a lamb."

>ask chef about dartmoor
 The chef stares at you, and her face turns red, but she controls
 herself and gets back to her work. She obviously doesn't like to be
 interrupted.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

 Entrance Hall

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

>go south

 Outside the front entrance

 You can see a security guard here.

>ask guard about dartmoor
 The guard's face burns red. "How..." he chokes, "how... how did...?"
 Obviously he has some dark secret connected to Dartmoor, but you don't
 know what. Still, HE doesn't know that. You give him your sweetest and
 most patronising smile, and remind him about Malcolm. "Look," says the
 guard, "I don't want to get into any trouble. I was just following
 orders - Mrs D'Arcy - the mother of the bride - told me to do it!"

 You are stunned into silence by this surprising revelation.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>ask guard about sheryl
 "Your name's not down, you're not coming in."

>ask guard about malcolm
 "I've already told you all I know."

 A sudden gust of wind ruffles your hair.

>go north
 The guard moves to stop you, but then remembers that you supposedly
 know his secret. Deeply unhappy, he never-the-less lets you pass.

 Entrance Hall

 The mother of the bride frets to herself in a corner; however you now
 know that it is merely a pathetic act by an apparently nasty woman (in
 an awful bright pink suit).

>ask sheryl about guard
 You stride up to the mother of the bride, and breathe in, about to
 speak, when she glances at you with a strange sparkle in her eye. You
 remember that this is a person mad enough to have the groom kidnapped.
 Who knows how she may react when you confront her?

 (Closing the camera first.)

 You start the video camera recording.

>ask sheryl about guard
 Summoning all your courage, you go for it. "Mrs D'Arcy," you say, "I'd
 like a word about Malcolm and his temporary accommodation in the
 attic." You give her what you hope is a knowing look, but which could,
 for all you know, look like you're trying to keep a fly escaping from
 your mouth.

 She looks startled for a moment, but her face quickly hardens. "Okay,
 it was me!" she barks. "I ordered the security guard to clonk Malcolm
 one and tie him up in the attic! He's not good enough for my darling
 daughter. Do you know how much he earns a year? Eighteen thousand.
 Eighteen thousand! It's a disgrace to the family!"

 She explains her cunning plan. She was going to keep Malcolm up in the
 attic until the wedding was officially called off. She would then
 release him. She had hired a lookalike to go to Scotland in his name
 and return in time for his release, thus making any accusations he may
 have made sound false.

 A cruel smile suddenly breaks across her lips. "It looks as if we have
 another problem to take care of." Before you can ponder her use of the
 word 'we', you hear movement behind you and -


 - - -

 You wake with a splitting headache, not sure how much time has passed.

 A gloomy dungeon
 You are strongly reminded of the supposedly luxurious holiday villa
 you had the misfortune to spend a week in a few years back. The air is
 damp, the bricks of the walls are crumbling, and there are no windows.
 The large wooden door to the southwest doesn't look as if it will be
 opening soon, either.

 A thick candle burns away in the middle of the room.

 You can also see a small wooden stool here.

 You feel something small and wet hit you on your scalp.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 You are carrying:
   a video camera (which is closed)
   a plastic supermarket bag
     a remote control
     a spade
     a Battlebase episode guide
     a golf ball
     a water detector
     a cash tin box (which is open but empty)
     a small steel key
     a bronze key
     a small brass key
     a wedding programme

>push detector
 The detector bleeps excitedly, and pulls your arm to a part of the
 ceiling. You memorise the spot.

 You stand on the stool.

>dig ceiling wit spade
 You can't see any such thing.

 The detector pulls your arm to the patch of the ceiling you have
 already memorised.

>dig ceiling with spade
 (the part of the ceiling with the spade)
 You can't do that.

 With a click, the video camera stops recording.

>dig patch
 What do you want to dig the part of the ceiling with?

>spade
 You can't do that.

> hit patch
 The stool is not near enough to the special part of the ceiling for
 you to be able to attempt to damage it.

>off
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>stand
 You get off the small wooden stool.

 A gloomy dungeon

 You glance at the ceiling to make sure you've remembered where the
 special part is.

 A thick candle burns away in the middle of the room.

 You can also see a small wooden stool here.

 You feel something small and wet hit you on your scalp.

 You can't go that way.

>move stool
 Nothing obvious happens.

 You feel something small and wet hit you on your scalp.

 That isn't in your possession.

 You feel something small and wet hit you on your scalp.

>put stool under patch

 You're carrying too many things to be able to pick up the stool.

 You are carrying:

   a plastic supermarket bag
     a remote control
     a spade
     a Battlebase episode guide
     a golf ball
     a water detector

 You put the small wooden stool under the part of the ceiling you
 memorised.

 Taken.

 You stand on the stool.

 You feel something small and wet hit you on your scalp.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>hit patch
 You hit this part of the ceiling hard with the palm of your hand, and
 it goes straight through the crumbling plaster and brickwork to open
 space beyond. Water and debris rains down on your head; when there is
 no more, you look up at the newly made hole and see daylight beyond.
 You make the hole as big as you can, but the rest of the ceiling seems
 quite sturdy.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go up
 With a lot of effort, you heave yourself up through the hole in the
 ceiling.

 Above the dungeon
 You stand on a curious, and slightly sagging, brick floor with an
 alarming hole in the middle. There doesn't appear to be anywhere you
 can go from here - you are trapped by a combination of bushes, hedges
 and a fast flowing river to the north. It may well be the same river
 you encountered earlier, but you have no way of knowing if this point
 is up or downstream.

 You don't need the water detector to work out that there's a river
 immediately to the north of you.

>examine bushes
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine hedges
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine river
 It looks quite deep.

>push detector
 You don't need the water detector to work out that there's a river
 immediately to the north of you.

>examine bricks
 The hole leads down to that awful place you were trapped in.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>yell
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

 Sunshine momentarily bursts out through the grey cloud cover.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>swim
 You attempt to swim in the river, but quickly find yourself out of
 control, being pulled along by the strong current. After a minute of
 useless thrashing and panicking, you manage to get to the bank on the
 inside of a U-bend in the river. This place seems awfully familiar...

 The edge of a fast-flowing river (in the river)

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go south
 You'll have to get out of the river first.

>out
 You get out of the river.

 The edge of a fast-flowing river


 The edge of a fast-flowing river
 You stand on the inside of a U-bend in a deep and fast flowing river -
 you are not sure of the name of it, since you didn't have much time to
 consult your A-to-Z on the way down, but it looks pretty much devoid
 of toxic waste and shopping trolleys. On the other side, you can see a
 field where the grass is overgrown and tall purple weeds have taken
 root. It reminds you of the wasteland behind your parents' house that
 you used to play in as a child. Anyway, the only way back is through
 the hole in the hedge to the south.

 Sunshine momentarily bursts out through the grey cloud cover.

>go south
 You squeeze through the gap at the bottom of the hedge.

 By the Crazy Golf Course

 Good old Uncle Albert stands nearby with a glass of brandy in one
 hand.

 You can see a hole under the hedge to the north which is just about
 big enough to squeeze through.

 Albert takes a tiny sip of his brandy but doesn't say anything.

 Deborah coos in wonder as you lead her through the secret passageway
 and up the stairs.

 She follows you up the stairs, sees Malcolm and freezes. "What's going
 on?" she hisses, and Malcolm cowers. "I've been trapped up here,
 love," he says. "Someone knocked me out and tied me up!"

 You step in and confirm Malcolm's story, telling Deborah that her
 mother organised the whole thing. Deborah boils over. "That just takes
 the biscuit! That's it. I'm leaving home for good." Then she notices
 Malcolm again, and her mood lightens in a flash. "Let's just forget
 the big family wedding and run off to Gretna Green," she says, taking
 his hand, and they dash off down the steps together, giggling like
 schoolchildren.

 You stand there grinning like an idiot, until a thought occurs to you.
 "Hey!" you call, "what about me? Don't mind me! I've just been dashing
 around like a wombat on steroids to sort out your problems, so hey,
 forget I'm here!" And they do.

 - - -

 A year goes by, mercifully free of weddings, security guards and
 mothers in law, with not a peep out of the (presumably) happy couple.
 A simple 'thank you' would have been nice; still, no point being
 bitter about it. Then, one bright sunny morning, you receive a letter
 from Deborah and Malcolm asking you to be their son's godparent.
 Perhaps unwisely, you accept.

 On the morning before the Christening, you are ironing your best shirt
 when the phone rings. "Mate, is that you?" a desperate-sounding
 Malcolm says at the other end of the line. "Look, you've got to get up
 here quickly and help us sort out this mess!"

 There is only one reaction you can give to that, and it is

       "Aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhh!"

 The room to the south of West End cannot be reached, but it existed in
 an early version of the code. I simply couldn't find a use for it in
 the mad rush to complete the game in time for the Acorn User IF
 Competition. There was a mirror and a four-poster bed in there, and
 possibly a wardrobe, but nothing else of any interest. It may be
 restored in the future.

 Scamp has no use in the game whatsoever (and can spend the whole game
 tied up) but he can be amusing to watch, and even offers a clue if in
 the right place. He and the chef don't get on very well, and the chef
 can say some nasty things to him when he's around. Most of the
 characters react to him when he enters a room. He will eat both the
 apple and the pizza if you give them to him.

 The video cassette has seven time segments; the camera can record from
 any room in the game. The play-back is relatively simple, but the
 puzzle doesn't require any greater level of sophistication. Due to
 inefficient distribution of code, the first segment recorded on the
 camera is never viewed. A bit of effort could have sorted this out,
 but I decided to leave it be, and put it down to the fact that the
 camera isn't a very good model.

 A lot of incidental scenery crops up in this third release, in
 response to criticisms that a lot of 'objects' (mentioned in the room
 descriptions) can't be manipulated. I imagine this will infuriate an
 equal number of players, who won't be able to tell which objects are
 useful and which aren't (though I tried to put strong hints in the
 object descriptions). The painting of the 'Angel Gabrielle' in the
 dining hall is there in honour of British soul singer Gabrielle, whose
 song 'Give Me A Little More Time' is one of my all-time favourites.

 There is a cheat mode in this game! Well, not so much of a cheat mode
 as a short cuts mode to help during the development and testing
 stages. The commands are as follows...

 TELEPORT - transports the player into the entrance hall
 TELEPORT TWO - transports the player into the bathroom
 GETTOEND - moves to the end game (you must say MALCOLM to sheryl
 first)
 WIN - sets the win condition - useful for getting to this amusing menu
 system in a hurry.
 NUMBERS - gives the numbers for dialling the pizza and opening the
 cellar door.

 To activate these, you'll need the password. Here are two clues:

 1) One of the more regal companions in Doctor Who.
 2) She was part of a Roman invasion.

 They met in a cold, dark alley, copies of a cheap right-wing tabloid
 newspaper under their arms, wearing dirty rain macs.

 "Psssst" whispered the first. "In spring, London is a beautiful city."

 "But in Birmingham, geese are flying," said the second automatically.
 They both nodded at each other. They had exchanged accepted passwords.

 "That game you got for me," said the first. "The Wedding."

 "Shhhhhh!!"

 "All right, all right! That game. It doesn't do anything for me. Do
 you have anything better?"

 "Well, I can do you some BSE, by Chris Smith, if you like."

 "That any good?"

 "Top stuff. The biz. Came first in the Acorn User 1996 Interactive
 Fiction competition. Much better than The Wedding."

 "Sounds good. Anything else?"

 "Well, the third placed entry, Leopold the Minstrel, by a guy called
 Jamie Murphy, sounds hot, but I don't know how to get hold of that
 yet."

 "So how do I get BSE?"

 The second handed the first a piece of paper. "This is the address of
 the ftp.gmd.de interactive fiction archive. Tell them I sent you."
 With that, the second disappeared into the night. Glancing nervously
 around, the first headed off in the opposite direction.

 How did I get out of the house at the end? Barbara helped you escape.
 She fetched Chloe from the Drawing Room, and the three of you walked
 out past the open-mouthed guard and Mrs D'Arcy, who didn't dare do
 anything.

 What of Sheryl D'Arcy and the guard? A few weeks later, Sheryl boarded
 a plane to Brazil, planning a nice little holiday there. Due to a
 freak series of events, she found herself parachuting out over the
 Amazon, where she was forced to fend for herself for over a month
 before her husband bothered to send out a search party for her. It
 proved to be a character-building experience, and she came back a
 changed woman. D'Arcy manor was converted into a shelter for homeless
 children.

 A near-death experience (caused by a runaway milk float) made the
 security guard see the error of his ways, and he became a New Age
 Traveller.

 How is it that I know the names of everyone in the house even though I
 haven't met them before? Telepathy? Maybe Barbara sent you a fax of
 names before you got to D'Arcy manor, which wasn't mentioned in the
 opening text. Or maybe the author's programming skills were limited
 when he first created the characters.

 Where are Malcolm's parents, Mr D'Arcy, the best man, the matron of
 honour, etc? Malcolm's parents don't get on well with Deborah's
 parents, so there's a lack of communication on that front. Mr D'Arcy
 and the best man are out looking for Malcolm, and the matron of honour
 is still in bed at home, recovering from a hangover.

 What kind of a place is D'Arcy Manor? It is a mish-mash of a place,
 based mainly on my vague idea of what a country house was like. The
 layout is admittedly very odd. Research proved that the design wasn't
 totally unfeasible, and a few touches were added here and there to the
 room descriptions, but nothing major was changed.

 How did the guard and Mrs D'Arcy get me to the dungeon? The 'dungeon'
 is in actual fact a small room in the cellar, behind the wooden door
 in the tunnel (for those who missed it). Sheryl and the guard dragged
 you down the cellar and dumped you in the cell, their only concession
 to human rights being the candle.

 Why is it that I could get Deborah to follow me after the dungeon
 experience but not before? Malcolm said that he wouldn't be able to
 face Deborah without knowing who was behind the attempts to sabotage
 the wedding. He was also a bit shaken up after the whole kidnapping
 business, and didn't want to go wandering around the house. So, you
 had to bring Deborah to him... but only after you had found out who
 had been behind it all.

 Why would she follow me anyway? You told her that it was something
 important. You must have an honest face because she believed you.

 Why is it that the guard stopped me from going in the house at the
 beginning, but didn't stop me going round to the garden? He is under
 strict instructions not to let any unauthorised people in the house.
 His instructions don't say anything about the garden, and since he
 possesses very little initiative or intelligence, he doesn't stop you.

 Well, what about X, or Y ? A unique feature of this adventure is its
 Imagine-O-Vision (TM), which, using its top secret hand-written
 software engine, allows the player to come up with their own
 explanations for holes in the plot. (Or, in other words, "Your guess
 is as good as mine.")

 Entrance Hall
 The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
 within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
 expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
 Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
 like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
 cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
 south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
 house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

 The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as
 only hysterical mothers can.

 Passage
 Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
 leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
 dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
 northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
 clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
 and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.

 A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

 The cellar door hangs open invitingly to the west.

 Library

>look up hint in index
 The 'Wedding Hints' book is exactly where it should be. As you pull it
 out, you notice with distaste that the pages are coloured bright red.

>read wedding hints
 This book, the back cover proclaims, will give you one hint for some
 obscure adventure game called The Wedding, and will automatically self
 destruct after a successful enquiry. It isn't really necessary now
 that marriage guidance is freely available - maybe someone in the
 household hates throwing things away.

>look up guard in wedding hints
 "You'll need to ask someone in the house about how to get the guard to
 talk. How about someone you're in favour with?" And with that, the
 book suddenly disintegrates in your hand.

>look up esther in wedding hints
 Nothing in the hints book about that, I'm afraid.

>look up scamp in wedding hints
 A dog is for life, not just for a wedding hints book. Scamp doesn't
 have any direct involvement with the main game, so there aren't any
 hints about him. Or is what I've just said a hint? Anyway, if it is,
 I'll give you that one for free.

>look up esther in programme
 "THE REVEREND ESTHER POTTS will be conducting the wedding service,
 despite protestations from Malcolm's father, who is dead set against
 female vicars (though he can't offer any plausible and rational
 explanations why, probably because there aren't any). Reverend Potts
 is a keen gardener, and has won the Church of England's 'God's Green
 Fingers' competition four times, with her prize vegetables."

>look up reverend in programme
 Nothing in the programme about that.

>look up cook in hints
 Nothing in the hints book about that, I'm afraid.

>look up william in hints
 "One of the books lying around the house should give you a clue as to
 how to get William to open the bathroom door. To get what you need for
 this, you'll have to use various forms of communication, and something
 in Deborah's bedroom may come in useful." And with that, the book
 suddenly disintegrates in your hand.

 Library
 Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
 with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
 literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
 shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
 closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
 attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
 the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
 anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
 corridor is out to the west.
