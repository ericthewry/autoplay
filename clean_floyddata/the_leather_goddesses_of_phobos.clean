 Some material in this story may not be suitable for children,
 especially the parts involving sex, which no one should know anything
 about until reaching the age of eighteen (twenty-one in certain
 states). This story is also unsuitable for censors, members of the
 Moral Majority, and anyone else who thinks that sex is dirty rather
 than fun.
 The attitudes expressed and language used in this story are
 representative only of the views of the author, and in no way
 represent the views of Infocom, Inc. or its employees, many of whom
 are children, censors, and members of the Moral Majority. (But very
 few of whom, based on last year's Christmas Party, think that sex is
 dirty.)
 By now, all the folks who might be offended by LEATHER GODDESSES OF
 PHOBOS have whipped their disk out of their drive and, evidence in
 hand, are indignantly huffing toward their dealer, their lawyer, or
 their favorite repression-oriented politico. So... Hit the

 The place: Upper Sandusky, Ohio. The time: 1936. The beer: at a nickel
 a mug, you don't ask for brand names. All you know is that your fifth
 one tasted as bad as the first.

 Joe's Bar
 An undistinguished bar, yet the social center of Upper Sandusky.
 The front door is almost lost amidst the hazy maze of neon that
 shrouds the grimy glass of the south wall. Doors marked "Ladies" and
 "Gents" lead, respectively, northeast and northwest.
    You feel an urge.

 Ladies' Room
 This filthy bathroom belies the existence of disinfectant. A single
 toilet and sink are the only fixtures. More breathable air can be
 found to the southwest.
    You can see a stool here.

 You trace the smell to a dubious slice of pizza, crumpled in the
 corner. [Incidentally, we had some pretty putrid scents available, all
 of which would've seemed right at home in a filthy restroom. In the
 end, we were too kind to use them -- but we were sorely tempted!]

 A brilliant flash of green light seems less unusual when followed
 by the appearance of tentacled aliens, as is the case with the current
 flash of green light. The tentacles wrap roughly around you as you
 faint.
 After an unknown amount of time... Well, let's cut the bullshit.
 7.3 hours later, you wake. Your head feels as if it's been run over by
 several locomotives, or at least one very large locomotive, and your
 clothes are now unrecognizable...

 Cell
 You are in a large cell with a soft, cushiony floor. A wide door
 (closed, naturally) forms the southern wall of the cell.
    Hanging on the wall is a painting of a pussy cat.
    You can see a flashlight, a stool and a blanket here.
 Someone thrusts a tray into your cell. A hunk of brown food on the
 tray looks unappetizing, but smells deliciously familiar.

 "Hello, Prisoner!
 You are a captive of the Leather Goddesses of Phobos. As an
 experimental subject, your unspeakably painful death will help our
 effort to enslave humanity and turn the Earth into our private
 pleasure world. Consider this to be a great honor, human."
 The remainder of the book covers the exacting rules of behavior
 expected of a prisoner of the Leather Goddesses of Phobos. For
 example, it mentions that escapees will be killed immediately and
 painfully by crack Leckbandi guards. After reading it, you stick it
 back in your back pocket.

 Other End of Hallway
 Before you can even begin to wonder what happened to the middle of
 the hallway, a guard patrol erupts from the shadows. A tall, neatly
 dressed Leckbandi tucks you under its arm. (The Leckbandi, who evolved
 in the asteroid belt, all work exclusively as security guards. This is
 odd, since there's not a single thing in the entire asteroid belt
 worth stealing.)
 Consulting a wrist computer, the Leckbandi punches in notable
 features of your appearance: size, number of heads, lack of feathers,
 and so forth. Eventually, the tiny screen flashes: "IDENTIFICATION
 COMPLETED: Prisoner, human, escaped. DISPOSITION: Death, painful,
 immediate." The Leckbandi, who, like all Leckbandis, prides itself on
 its ability to follow the orders of wrist computers, immediately and
 painfully kills you.

 "Examination" Room
 A number of hideous experiments fill this room. Their obvious
 purpose: studies of the human anatomy, especially those parts rarely
 referred to in the New York Times. A pathetic-looking human is the
 current subject; however, even an author as fond of lascivious detail
 as this one would hesitate to describe it even in LEWD mode, except to
 mention that it involves a lot of lubricants, some plastic tubing, and
 a yak.
 Before you've really gotten as sick as you know you could get, one

 As you enter, a woman sitting limply in the shadows stiffens and rises
 to her feet. "A human! They got you too? I've been here a week. When
 you opened the door, I figured it was a guard! Was it unlocked? I
 never thought of trying it. By the way, my name's Tiffany. From
 Alaska. I'm not too bright, but I'm strong as an ox, and I'm great
 with my hands. Maybe we can lick these Leather Goddesses together."

 Other Cell
 You are in a very tiny room with a rock-hard floor. A narrow cell
 door to the north is open.
 A crumpled paper lies discarded in the corner. There seems to be
 some writing on it.
    Tiffany is here, counting on her fingers and mumbling to herself.

>examine tiffany

 Tiffany is about your age and has a body worthy of envy: tall and
 well-built, with wide shoulders, a generous bosom, slim waist, and
 long, tawny legs. The only minus seems to be slightly oversized feet,
 but even oversized feet are a plus if you're into toe-sucking.

 Apparently this section of Phobos has a significant moth problem.

>turn on flashlight

 Okay, the flashlight is now on.

 Closet
 This room is barely large enough to turn around in. Just to prove
 it, you turn around. As you do, you spot a black circle, about two
 feet across, seemingly painted on the floor in the corner. A shelf
 protrudes from one wall, very close to the ceiling. The closet is open
 to the south. A strong odor of mothballs pervades the closet.
    Tiffany is here, alertly surveying your surroundings.
    Sitting on the shelf is a wicker basket.

>examine basket

 The basket is oval-shaped. A handle spans the narrow part.

>take it

 You can't reach the wicker basket.
 Tiffany trots over to you. "I've got a plan to bring these Leather
 Goddess jokers to their knees," she says, flipping you a matchbook.
 The cover of the matchbook is filled with scrawled notations. "If we
 can scrape up these items, I can whip up something that'll knock 'em
 cold! A Super-Duper Anti-Leather Goddesses of Phobos Attack
 Machine!!!"

>examine matchbook

 The cover of the matchbook is filled with scrawled notations. You
 briefly open the matchbook and see that there are no matches left.

>read matchbook

 Most of the scrawlings are a "blueprint" for a vastly complicated
 device. Below that is a parts list:
    1. a common household blender
    2. six feet of rubber hose
    3. a pair of cotton balls
    4. an eighty-two degree angle
    5. a headlight from any 1933 Ford
    6. a white mouse
    7. any size photo of Douglas Fairbanks
    8. a copy of the Cleveland phone book

 Roof
 Your view extends to the horizon, which on tiny Phobos usually
 means a few hundred feet. Thrusting up into sight beyond the horizon
 are the arching towers and curving domes of the notorious Pleasure
 Palace of the Leather Goddesses of Phobos. On a wide plain between
 here and the palace, powerful warships are poised for the imminent
 invasion of Earth.
 Mars dominates the view, a dull red orb spanning a quarter of the
 sky. Bright blue canals lace the surface, and white caps of ice are
 visible at both poles.
 A stairway leads down into the building. Near the edge, seemingly
 painted onto the roof, is a black circle. You might be able to jump to
 the ground, but frankly we advise against it.
    Tiffany enters just a few steps behind you.

 Martian Desert
 As you wander amidst these towering dunes of red Martian sand, you
 notice three distinct pathways: north, east, and west.
 A few seconds later, you see Tiffany's left buttock appear,
 followed almost immediately by the rest of her.

 Ruin
 You stand amongst the ruins of a mighty castle. The only part of
 the castle that is more than a pile of rubble is to the north. A path
 leads out of the ruin to the south.
    Tiffany trails along.

>go north

 Throne Room
 This is the Throne Room of the once-potent King Mitre, of legendary
 fame. Of course, the version you've probably heard is significantly
 warped from What Really Happened.
 In the diseased version of the legend commonly transmitted on
 Earth, Mitre is called Midas. The King was granted his wish that
 everything he touched would turn to gold. His greed caught up with him
 when he transformed even his own daughter into gold.
 King Mitre's wish was, in fact, that everything he touched would
 turn to forty-five degree angles. No one has ever explained this
 strange wish; the most likely hypothesis is a sexual fetish. In any
 case, the tale has a similar climax, with Mitre turning his own
 daughter into a forty-five degree angle.
 King Mitre sits upon the throne, looking dejected and lonely. Next
 to him is a pile of forty-five degree angles. One stands out from the
 others, thanks to its golden hair and flowing white gown. The main
 entrance of the throne room is to the south, but a tight opening leads
 north.
    Tiffany follows you.

>take angle

 Mitre growls, "Keep your hands off my daughter."

>examine angle

 The angle has the sort of golden hair and satiny robes that one
 normally associates with princesses.

>examine mitre

 The old king looks very down. His appearance is rather odd, since his
 clothes, his jewelry, his crown, even his very throne, all have a
 rather angular appearance.

>ask king about daughter

 The king weeps pitifully.

 Royal Docks
 During the peak of King Mitre's reign, a cruel joke went around the
 kingdom that Mitre's two greatest loves were his Royal Docks and his
 Royal Ducks. The joke was never very good and has long since been
 forgotten, and the ducks perished years ago from a
 sexually-transmitted disease, but the docks remain, jutting into a
 wide Martian Canal which flows from west to east. Behind you, to the
 south, is a ruined castle.
 A barge, hand-crafted from fine Martian cedarwood, is moored at the
 end of the dock.
    Tiffany loyally stays at your side.

>examine barge

 This large barge could host a host of royal guests. The barge rests
 immobile at the dockside, despite a strong current and no visible
 mooring lines. There are some simple controls on the side of the barge
 nearest the dock.

>examine controls

 The controls consist of a huge orange button, and a huge purple
 button. Both buttons have writing on them.

 As with all Martian civilization, this once-fashionable shopping

 Donald Dock
 A barge, hand-crafted from fine Martian cedarwood, is moored at the
 end of the dock.
    Tiffany follows you.

>enter barge

 You are now in the royal barge. Tiffany gets in behind you.

>push orange

 The writing on the button changes as you press it. The barge shoots
 away from the dock, into the deeper waters of the canal.

 Martian Canal, in the royal barge
 The royal barge rocks gently in the current of a wide canal. A dock
 is visible on the southern shore.
    The royal barge barges further down the canal.

 Martian Canal, in the royal barge
 The royal barge rocks gently in the current of a wide canal. The
 banks of the canal are steep and sandy. Sculpted reddish sand dunes
 rise into view beyond the banks of the canal.

>wait

 Time passes...
    The royal barge barges further down the canal.

 Martian Canal, in the royal barge
 The royal barge rocks gently in the current of a wide canal. The
 banks of the canal are steep and sandy. Just ahead, the canal curves
 sharply to the south.

>wait

 Time passes...
 The royal barge chugs quickly around the bend, ending up near the
 eastern bank of the canal.

 Martian Canal, near the east bank, in the royal barge
 The royal barge rocks gently in the current of a wide canal. There
 are docks on both banks. Just behind, the canal curves sharply to the
 west.

>push orange

 The writing on the button changes as you press it. The barge drifts
 toward the dock on the eastern shore, butting against it with a loud
 "clank."

 Now THIS Is My Kind of Dock, in the royal barge
 If I owned a pier on a major Martian canal, I'd want it to look
 just like this one -- handsome, well-proportioned, and amply endowed
 with jade and ivory. I could probably live without the alabaster stair
 which leads up at the end of the dock, to the east.

>out

 You and Tiffany get out of the royal barge.

>go east

 Main Hall of Palace
 A shaft of sunlight penetrates the stained glass windows and
 glistens off a large reflecting pool, filling this huge entry hall
 with a seductive pattern of tantalizing colors. Gleaming marble
 pillars rise majestically from the pool to support a towering, arched
 roof. You are on a branching pathway suspended above the pool, leading
 toward shadowy archways in every direction.
    Tiffany enters just a few steps behind you.

 Oriental Garden
 These twisted trees and elegant footbridges are even more beautiful
 than the gardens of the most lavish Fu Manchu films. Paths from the
 north, southeast, and west meet at a large well of hand-carved stone
 in the center of the garden.
    Tiffany trails along.

>examine well

 Totally ordinary looking well.

>enter well

 You climb down the well for a long distance. Near the bottom the
 handholds end, so you and Tiffany leap the rest of the way, landing on
 a black circle. You're sucked into the hole in a direction that isn't
 down, but neither is it one of the other directions with which you're
 familiar.

 Now THIS Is My Kind of Dock, in the royal barge
 A few seconds later, you see Tiffany's elbow appear, followed
 almost immediately by the rest of her.

 Audience Chamber
 The good news is that this hall is intoxicatingly beautiful, laid
 with the snow-white fur of the rare Martian Velvetworm and endowed
 with platinum arches and balustrades. Silky curtains embrace openings
 to the south, southwest, and west.
 The bad news is that no woman has ever entered the Audience Chamber
 of the Sultaness and departed alive.
    The Sultaness is here, enthroned.
    Tiffany loyally stays at your side.
 "Ah," says the Sultaness, "a visitor. This is pleasing; it was
 turning out to be a very dull morning." She clears her throat. "The
 rules: I will pose a riddle. If you answer it correctly, you may spend
 one hour with any of my husbands. If you answer incorrectly, you will
 die. If you do not answer, you will die. If you enter the harem before
 answering, you will die. If you attempt to leave, you will die. If you
 touch me in any way, you will die. If I happen to sneeze, you will
 die. If any situation not covered by the rules occurs, you will die."
 She motions to one of the palace eunuchs. "Go tell the animal tenders
 not to feed the tigers yet." Pause. "Are you ready?"

>yes

 "Here, then, is the riddle. Don't strain your head; no one's ever
 gotten it right." You hear a growling snarl from somewhere nearby.
    "Some say I'm pointless,
        yet many are obsessed by me.
     I have caused heroic gambles
        and sown endless frustration.
     Uncounted deaths have I caused.
        What am I?"
 Tiffany steps briskly forward. "That's easy!" she yells. "A
 grapefruit!" As the eunuchs snicker behind their weapons, the
 Sultaness cries "Wrongo!" and Tiffany is led away. As you hear, from
 nearby, a fierce roar followed by a blood-curdling scream, your eyes
 fill with tears. You hang your head in sorrow for a moment to honor
 your brave, loyal companion who gave her life that humanity might be
 safe from the terrible scourge of the Leather Goddesses of Phobos.
    "Your turn to guess," says the Sultaness, looking gleeful.

 Laundry Room
 One of the less pleasant aspects of running a palace is the sheer
 volume of dirty laundry its occupants produce. Why, the 8379 husbands
 alone could keep a crew of cleaners sleepless. Add in the servants,
 cooks, gardeners, stablehands, jesters, visiting nobles,
 brothers-in-law in virtual permanent residence... Suffice it to say
 that there's one hell of a lot of dirty laundry here. You can barely
 see the exit to the north through it all.
 Today must be drying day at the laundry, since there's only one
 clothes pin left.
    Tiffany follows you.

 make a beeline for the harem to the west.

>go west

 A well-armed male guard blocks you. "Congratulations on your
 performance," he says in a bored voice. You wonder how the guard can
 be so unmoved by your historic feat. As though sensing your thoughts,
 the guard says, "The Sultaness likes to pretend that no one's ever
 gotten the riddle, but someone got it last year, the word spread
 around, and now everyone knows the answer. You're the twelfth winner
 this week already. She sent away to Maude's House of Riddles on
 Ganymede for a new one, but the mail is so slow..." The guard shakes
 his head. "Well, pick a husband; any number from 1 to 8379. Don't
 waste time thinking; they're all clones anyway." He looks at you
 expectantly.

 It seems that the Sultaness likes her husbands to wear fine cologne.

 Time passes...
 A figure, completely cloaked in veils of silk, enters and beckons
 you deeper into the harem...

 Inner Harem
 This luxurious bedroom, presumably one of many throughout the
 harem, is appointed with a multitude of exotic furs, warm to the touch
 as though still alive. The heady aroma of cologne and incense mingle
 in the air. There's an exit to the southeast.
 Sultaness' husband #3906 touches a button at the shoulder of his
 tunic and it slowly floats to the floor. He pulls you down onto the
 furs, whispering in a husky voice, "For an hour, I am yours."

>kiss husband

 Sultaness' husband #3906 moans softly and draws closer to you.

>mount husband

 Let's not beat around the bush. Come out and say what you mean.

>fuck husband

 Sultaness' husband #3906 draws you into his arms. As your hands
 explore his firm, strong body, a faint sweaty, musky odor triggers a
 passionate fire within you, and you find yourself warming to the
 occasion. Your lovemaking is slow and gentle, and as you reach a
 crescendo of pleasure, you cry out softly, passionately, and
 repeatedly. "Oh," moans Sultaness' husband #3906, "say my number again
 ... say it in French..."
 Much later, you and Sultaness' husband #3906 fall back upon the furs,
 basking in the aura of postcoital bliss.

>kiss my kneecaps

 "Smack."

>husband, kiss my kneecaps

 "Oh," whispers Sultaness' husband #3906, "you're from the rebels!
 Here's the secret map," he says, laying a secret map at your feet,
 "and here's a reliable torch," he says, lighting a reliable torch and
 placing it next to the map. He moves some furs to reveal a secret
 entrance leading downwards. "The only way out is through the catacombs
 -- if you come back this way with the secret map, the harem guards
 will..."

 descend, reluctantly, into the gloom of the catacombs...

 brackish canal water.

 Now THIS Is My Kind of Dock, in the royal barge
 If I owned a pier on a major Martian canal, I'd want it to look
 just like this one -- handsome, well-proportioned, and amply endowed
 with jade and ivory. I could probably live without the alabaster stair
 which leads up at the end of the dock, to the east.

 glistens off a large reflecting pool, filling this huge entry hall
 with a seductive pattern of tantalizing colors. Gleaming marble
 pillars rise majestically from the pool to support a towering, arched
 roof. You are on a branching pathway suspended above the pool, leading
 toward shadowy archways in every direction.
    Tiffany trails along.

>go north

 As you approach, you realize that the archway in this direction is
 merely a design on a solid wall.

>go east

 Oriental Garden
 These twisted trees and elegant footbridges are even more beautiful
 than the gardens of the most lavish Fu Manchu films. Paths from the
 north, southeast, and west meet at a large well of hand-carved stone
 in the center of the garden.
    Tiffany follows you.

>look at well

 Totally ordinary looking well.

>look in well

 Handholds lead downward!

>go down

 You climb down the well for a long distance. Near the bottom the
 handholds end, so you and Tiffany leap the rest of the way, landing on
 a black circle. You're sucked into the hole in a direction that isn't
 down, but neither is it one of the other directions with which you're
 familiar.

 Now THIS Is My Kind of Dock, in the royal barge
 If I owned a pier on a major Martian canal, I'd want it to look
 just like this one -- handsome, well-proportioned, and amply endowed
 with jade and ivory. I could probably live without the alabaster stair
 which leads up at the end of the dock, to the east.
 A few seconds later, you see Tiffany's big toe appear, followed
 almost immediately by the rest of her.

 The good news is that this hall is intoxicatingly beautiful, laid

 A slender tower protrudes magnificently above the palace grounds. A
 stair winds up into the tower and an oriental garden spreads out to
 the northwest.
    Tiffany follows you.

>go up

 Minaret
 By standing erect at the parapet of this mighty tower, you command
 an exciting view. Below, gardens and courtyards intermingle with the
 palace buildings, forming a fertile oasis in the Martian desert. Off
 to the west, docks straddle a deep canal. On the far shore, sand dunes
 lap at crumbling buildings. On the top step of a winding stair is a
 black circle.
    Tiffany trails along.

 Okay, the flashlight is now on.

 Cramped Space
 You are in a dark space, too tiny to move around in. There are no
 visible exits.
    Tiffany is here, counting on her fingers and mumbling to herself.
 Suddenly, part of the floor collapses, and you and Tiffany tumble
 through the resulting hole...

 Cell
 You are in a large cell with a soft, cushiony floor. A wide door
 (now open) forms the southern wall of the cell.
 Among the new rubble, you notice a black circle, attached to a
 piece of (what used to be) the floor of the cramped space.
 "What a great cell!" says Tiffany, looking around. "Why didn't I
 get a cell like this? Maybe I shouldn't have kicked that guard in the
 nuts when I first got here..."

>examine barge

>examine barge

 This large barge could host a host of royal guests. The barge rests
 immobile at the dockside, despite a strong current and no visible
 mooring lines. There are some simple controls on the side of the barge
 nearest the dock.

>examine controls

 The controls consist of a huge orange button, and a huge purple
 button. Both buttons have writing on them.

 The huge purple button reads: Full Speed Ahead.

 Laundry Room
 One of the less pleasant aspects of running a palace is the sheer

 alone could keep a crew of cleaners sleepless. Add in the servants,
 cooks, gardeners, stablehands, jesters, visiting nobles,
 brothers-in-law in virtual permanent residence... Suffice it to say
 that there's one hell of a lot of dirty laundry here. You can barely

 No, not a typo. "Dessert" refers to the fifty foot Martian Cream

 Another Ruin
 This ancient castle now lies in ruins. (There do seem to be quite a
 few of them around here, eh?) All that remains of its once-proud
 ramparts are dust and rubble, and an occasional stone block. A path
 leads away from the ruin to the west. To the east: unchartable desert.
 Sitting on one of the stone blocks is a large green frog. Something
 about it catches your eye.

 You realize what aroused your attention: the tiny gold crown on the

 frog, that is. By any other measure it is a repulsive creature, with
 swollen eyes, oozing warts, slimy skin, and a grating croak.

>put pin on nose

 You pin your proboscis.

>cover ears with hands

 Many sounds seem muffled now that you're covering your ears with your
 hands.

>close eyes

 Your eyes are now closed.

>kiss frog

 You lean forward with your eyes closed, your nose shut and your ears
 covered, but just as you are about to kiss the frog the thought of
 slimy frog lips pressing against your own makes you shudder away.

>open eyes

 You can once again sense with your eyes.

>drop ears

 You can once again sense with your ears.

>take balm

 Taken.

>put balm on lips

 You coat your lips with the glistening balm, using up the whole stick.

>cover ears

 [What do you want to cover the ears with?]

>hands

 Many sounds seem muffled now that you're covering your ears with your
 hands.

>close eyes

 Your eyes are now closed.

>kiss frog

 You lean forward with your eyes closed, your nose shut, your ears
 covered and your lips smeared with balm. Planting your mouth solidly
 against the frog's, you kiss deeply. When you feel a tongue sliding
 into your mouth, revulsion gives way to pleasure, as the
 no-longer-enchanted but quite enchanting prince presses against you.
 As your arms grip his naked, muscular back, he effortlessly slips off
 your brass bikini. A warm and wild feeling springs from your loins,
 spreading like a fiery potion through your veins. Within moments you
 are joined in passionate love, and just as a quick and lustful orgasm
 seems inevitable, a force crackles in the air, and you are alone,
 naked, sweating, and unsatisfied.
 As you gather up your garment and put it on, you notice a common
 household blender on the ground. There's an engraving on its side.
 Tiffany is at the other end of the ruin, sifting through some rubble,
 oblivious to your "experience."

>take blender

 You have a rabbit, an unreliable torch, a raft, a Cleveland phone
 book, a secret map, a stool, a wicker basket, a flashlight, a common
 household blender, a stick of lip balm (smeared all over your lips), a
 clothes pin (pinned to your nose), a rule book (stuck in your back
 pocket) and a brass bikini (being worn). It seems that the wicker
 basket contains a hunk of chocolate, a blanket, a scrap of paper, a
 matchbook and a coded message.

>read scrap

 There's a seemingly meaningless matrix of letters on the paper:

 Another Ruin
 This ancient castle now lies in ruins. (There do seem to be quite a
 few of them around here, eh?) All that remains of its once-proud
 ramparts are dust and rubble, and an occasional stone block. A path
 leads away from the ruin to the west. To the east: unchartable desert.
    Tiffany is here, alertly surveying your surroundings.

>go west

 Martian Desert
 As you wander amidst these towering dunes of red Martian sand, you
 notice three distinct pathways: north, east, and west.
    Tiffany loyally stays at your side.

>go west

 Yet Another Ruin
 Wind whistles among the fallen archways, crumbled balustrades, and
 black circle of this ruined castle. (It's no wonder this section of
 Mars is considered the Ruined Castle Capital of the Solar System.)
 Paths lead east and northwest through the rubble.
    Tiffany loyally stays at your side.

 You're sucked into the hole in a direction that isn't down, but
 neither is it one of the other directions with which you're familiar.

 Basement
    This is a moist cellar. Soft light trickles down the stairway.
 A few seconds later, you see Tiffany's big toe appear, followed
 almost immediately by the rest of her.

 End of Hallway
 A wide cell door lies open to the north, and a narrow cell door
 lies open to the south. The hallway ends at a gleaming metal door to
 the west, and continues east. Something, possibly this very sentence,
 tells you that it would be dangerous to travel east or west. A sign is
 posted next to the stairs which lead both upwards and downwards.
    Tiffany enters just a few steps behind you.

 Hickory & Dickory Dock
 This dock, which extends north into a broad canal, is crafted of
 fine woods from across the solar system: hickory wood from the forests
 of Earth, and dickory wood from the jungles of Venus. A path leads
 south.
    You spot a little white marsmouse running along the dock.
    Tiffany follows you.

 The little fellow scurries easily away from you.
