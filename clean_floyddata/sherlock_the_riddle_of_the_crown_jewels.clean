 <span class="floydstyle subheader">221-B Baker Street</span>

 You are standing in the spill of a gas streetlight outside Holmes's
 house. The street disappears into the fog to the north and south. The
 door to the house is to the west.

 You have come in response to an urgent summons from your old landlady,
 Mrs Hudson. As the fog swirls around you, you huddle into your coat
 and shiver in the predawn chill.

 In your pocket you see a pound note.

 Why, haven't you ever seen a pound note before?

 You do not see anything unusual about the whistle.

 You open the black bag.
 Inside you see a brown bottle and a blue bottle.

 The label on the bottle reads: "Belladonna. For bradycardia and other
 decelerated arrhythmias."

>examine blue bottle


 The label on the bottle reads: "Digitalis leaf. For tachycardia and
 other accelerated arrhythmias."

>sing


 You sing tunelessly for a few moments until you remember that you're
 tone deaf and know next to nothing about music.

>knock on door


 You hear a bolt sliding back and the door opens to reveal a worried
 Mrs Hudson.

 "Oh Doctor Watson, I'm so glad to see you. It's Mr Holmes, sir. Three
 days have come and gone since he's been out of his rooms. He won't eat
 and I know he hasn't slept. Now there's a visitor who says he's here
 about some important government business. I tried to send him away,
 but he insisted on waiting in the parlour. That's when I sent for you.
 Thank God you've come."

 You step inside and Mrs Hudson closes the door behind you. The entry
 hall is just as you remember it - small, underheated, and lit by a
 feeble gas light. The door to the parlour is to the north, and a
 flight of well-worn stairs leads up to the first floor.

>examine gas


 You cannot see any gas here.

>examine gas light


 You do not see anything interesting about the gas light.

>talk to mrs hudson


 Mrs Hudson does not respond.

>ask mrs hudson about sherlock


 "He doesn't eat. He doesn't drink. He doesn't read the newspaper. I'm
 very worried about him."

>ask mrs hudson about whistle


 Mrs Hudson wrings her hands and looks at you anxiously. "I'm too
 worried to think, Doctor. Won't you see what you can do for Mr
 Holmes?"

>go north


 Mrs Hudson apologetically stands in front of the closed door. "I'm
 terribly worried about Mr Holmes, Doctor. Won't you please attend to
 him right away?"

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>

 You climb the stairs and pause outside the door to Holmes's study,
 nervous about what you might find inside.

 Holmes's study is to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Holmes's Study</span>

 You step back through time to your bachelor days, when you shared
 these cluttered digs with the world's only consulting detective.
 Despite the mess, you can see that the room is unchanged. The
 fireplace to the north has a pile of letters transfixed to its
 mantelpiece by a jackknife. Next to them lies Holmes's six-shot
 revolver, the tobacco slipper, and Holmes's favorite pipe. The violin
 has been carelessly tossed onto a stack of obviously unread
 newspapers.

 Holmes is slouched on the sofa, lost in a black mood of despair. He is
 pale and emaciated, and his sharp eyes burn with fever. He is staring
 at a phial that he holds in one hand. His free hand rests near a
 hypodermic syringe in a neat morocco case at his side. You realize
 that he is fighting a depression brought on by what he calls "the dull
 routine of existence."

 The bedroom door to the west is closed. The only other exit is the
 door to the south.

>ask holmes about holmes


 Holmes seems to hear you, but he does not respond.

 It is an old and oily black clay pipe, the companion of Holmes's
 deepest meditations.

>get gun


 You take the pistol off of the mantelpiece.

>read newspaper


 It's the newspaper that came in your game package.

>show paper to holmes


 Holmes glances at the paper and his eye falls on the notice about the
 Tower of London. He immediately leaps to his feet and hurls the phial
 and the case into the fireplace. The phial and the syringe shatter,
 and the liquid evaporates instantly, but the detective does not even
 notice. "They've closed the Tower?" he exclaims. "Most singular."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">[Your score just went up by 5 points. The total is now 9 out of</span>
 100.]

 Holmes strides to the door and calls down to Mrs Hudson to bring up a
 tray of food. Then he plops back down on the sofa, makes a steeple of
 his fingertips and focuses his intense gaze upon you.

>ask holmes about tower


 "The Tower is the safest stronghold in the nation. Our adversary must
 be formidable indeed."

>ask holmes about watson


 "Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point in a changing age. I am
 honoured that you have become my biographer."

>ask holmes about mrs hudson


 "A splendid housekeeper, Watson, although she worries about me too
 much."

 Mrs Hudson appears at the door, accompanied by a worried-looking
 gentleman.

 Holmes jumps up and ushers the gentleman to the armchair, dismissing
 Mrs Hudson at the same time. "Watson," he says, "I am sure you
 recognize our distinguished visitor. I presume, sir, that you have
 come about the Jewels."

 The visitor half rises from his chair in protest and sputters,
 "But...but, how...?"

 Holmes calms him with a glance. "Come, sir. What else could it be? The
 Tower is suddenly closed, and within hours I receive a call from the
 highest official of Her Majesty's government. A simple deduction. Now
 then, tell me about the theft."

 The visitor settles back into his chair and says, "We know very
 little. Only that the Crown Jewels were stolen from the Tower sometime
 Thursday night. The theft was discovered Friday morning, and we
 immediately closed and searched the Tower. All we found was this verse
 which was left behind in the empty jewel case."

 The visitor removes a folded piece of paper from his pocket and gives
 it to Holmes, who glances at it and passes it on to you.

>read note


 [taking the pound note out of your pocket first].
 There's nothing written on it.

>read paper


 Which paper do you mean, the clue paper or the newspaper?

>read clue paper


 Mortality, behold and fear!
 What a change of flesh is here!
 Think how many royal bones
 Sleep within this heap of stones:
 Here they lie, had realms and lands,
 Who now want strength
     to stir their hands.

          **********

 For two-score years I reigned alone,
 A virgin queen on England's throne.
 My navy caused Armada's shame,
 And with me died the Tudor name.

          **********

 The apple sorely tempted Eve,
 And Tell another aimed to cleave.
 But when one fell, it showed to me,
 The mighty pull of gravity.

          **********

 My father, it was said, would die,
 Beneath the Holy City's sky.
 Jerusalem his body claimed,
 And it is after him I'm named.

          **********

          **********

 O stately Holmes of England,
 In Baker Street abide.
 For even you must surely fail,
 To save your country's pride.

>ask holmes about note


 "You must draw your own inferences, Watson."

 The visitor looks at his pocket watch and stands up. "Thank you,
 gentlemen. I must go now. Remember, this calamity can only be hidden
 from the public until Monday morning at nine o'clock. If the Regalia
 is not at Buckingham Palace in time for the Coronation Day
 festivities, then all is lost."

 The gentleman leaves, and Holmes unlocks the door to the bedroom, goes
 in, and reappears moments later wearing his Inverness cape and
 deerstalker hat.

 "Come when you're ready, Watson. I'll wait for you outside."

>take knife


 You take the knife off of the mantelpiece.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Holmes's Study</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">221-B Baker Street</span>

 You emerge from the house into Baker Street.

 You are standing in the spill of a gas streetlight outside Holmes's
 house. The street disappears into the fog to the north and south. The
 door to the house is to the west.

 Holmes says, "Ah, there you are Watson. While you were inside I gave
 our little problem some thought. Obviously the person who stole the
 Crown Jewels wanted the authorities to turn to me for help, and it is
 equally obvious that the thief has laid down a trail for me to follow,
 in hopes of somehow entrapping me.

 "So let's play his game, Doctor. But let's play it by our rules. The
 thief will have tried to anticipate the sequence of my actions, and
 I'm sure he has laid his trap accordingly. But if <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> were to
 guide the course of our investigations, he will certainly be thrown
 off the scent.

 "Therefore, let us take surprise onto our side and rely on your
 instincts as the man of action I know you to be - despite your
 frequent modest assertions to the contrary." He steps to one side and
 says, "Lead on, good Doctor. I will follow." Holmes gestures for you
 to lead the way.

>blow whistle

 towers of the Abbey loom in the fog above you, and you marvel at this
 perfect example of Gothic architecture, as generations have done
 before you.

 The Abbey door is closed.

 On the wall next to the door is a small, discreet sign.

 Visibility increases in the gathering light of the new day. Tourists
 are beginning to crowd into the streets.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Broad Sanctuary</span>

 You are standing in the midst of a crowd of tourists in front of the
 west door of Westminster Abbey. The towers of the Abbey soar high

 Your companion trails along after you.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nave</span>

 You enter the Abbey and pause in the Nave, struck by the sheer
 magnificence of the building. Massive Purbeck columns march the length
 of the Nave, and they rise in perfect proportion to meet each other in
 a series of pointed arches that are the hallmark of the Gothic style.

 The interior of the Abbey is dark, cold, and gloomy - but after a few
 moments your eyes adjust and you can make out a tomb at the far end of
 the room.

 Holmes trails along after you.

>examine tomb


 It's a white marble sarcophagus with "ISAACVS NEWTON   Eques Auratus"
 written on the front. Above it is a marble statue of Newton, and a
 carving of two cherubs who are holding a diagram of the solar system.

 A shaft of sunlight comes through the stained-glass window, lighting
 up one of the tombs, and relieving the general gloom of the Abbey's
 dark interior.

 Your companion joins you and starts looking around with interest.

 The oldest of the tombs is that of Geoffrey Chaucer, who died in the
 year 1400.

 Holmes follows you.

>examine chaucer


 [Geoffrey Chaucer's tomb]

 It's the tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer, who died in 1400 and became the
 first person to be buried in Poet's Corner. The inscription above the
 sarcophagus is so faded that it is almost illegible.

 of one of the Italian masters.

 Your friend drifts in after you, apparently lost in thought.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Confessor Chapel</span>

 The Confessor Chapel is dominated by the tomb of the founder of the

 that first gave Westminster the name "Burial place of kings."

 The detective trails along after you.

 dark interior.

 The detective joins you and starts looking around with interest.

 You are standing in the midst of a crowd of tourists in front of the

 above you, and you marvel at this perfect example of Gothic
 architecture, as generations have done before you.

 The Abbey door is open.

 On the wall next to the door is a small, discreet sign.

 Holmes follows you.

 The cab speeds through the streets, deftly weaving in and out of the
 jubilee traffic and whizzing past famous landmarks. Only a few minutes
 later, you arrive at your destination.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Whitehall</span>

 Impressive government buildings line the street on either side. The

 librarian here, on whose desk sits a handwritten sign that reads
 "Quiet, please." There are thousands of books behind glass cases, but
 one is lying unattended on a table. The only exit is to the west.

 The librarian - who is as dusty as the books - looks up in surprise as
 you come in. He says loudly, "Oh, I say! Hello! I don't get many
 visitors here. Is there something I can help you with? Some
 information about the Jubilee, perhaps? It's quite rare, you know, for
 a British ruler to celebrate 50 years on the throne. Unique, in fact.
 The closest anyone else came was Elizabeth, who ruled 45 years -
 although our records are somewhat vague before the year 900. The
 Anglo-Saxon chronicles do get rather sketchy, what? Still, they're the
 best we have. I think I can find a copy for you somewhere here."

 The librarian's voice trails off as he bustles from shelf to shelf,
 squinting at the books to find the one he thinks you want.

 Holmes drifts in after you, apparently lost in thought.

 Holmes takes you aside and whispers, "Watson, you must keep the
 ampoule hidden."

 The librarian launches off into another speech, and it distracts you
 from what you wanted to do. "The vases of the fourth dynasty of the
 ancient Sumerians differed significantly from those of the third
 dynasty. The most pronounced change involved a slight flaring of the
 handles from one dynasty to the next. Most experts agree that this
 symbolized a drastic change in the Sumerians' perception of the
 goddess Ashtoreth. Others however, believe it made the vases easier to
 carry."

 labourers building a new pyramid in Thebes learned that their payroll

 Ra Ra.'"

>ask librarian about book


 The librarian interrupts you as you attempt to speak, and says, "The
 confusion between the usage of the present subjunctive and the past
 subjunctive is easily resolved as long as one remembers that the terms
 refer not to different times, but to differing sorts of uncertainty.
 Reference to time itself is only implied by the use of the past
 perfect subjunctive. While no deaths have as yet resulted from
 incorrect usage, it would be prudent not to take chances."

 Your companion's eyes are half-closed, but they miss nothing.

 As you look around, the librarian says loudly, "While uncovering one's
 head is a symbol of respect in many cultures, in others the opposite
 is true. Some Indian religions, for example, require that a man's head
 remain covered at all times, giving rise to the use of the turban, or
 'imamah.' The tabu against removing one's turban eventually became so
 strong that thieves who thought nothing of stealing a victim's clothes
 would nevertheless leave his turban undisturbed."

 The librarian launches off into another speech, and it distracts you
 from what you wanted to do. "Most historians ascribe Catherine de
 Medicis's poor reputation among the French to her ordering the
 wholesale massacre of French citizens in 1572. Recent research,
 however, has revealed that years before, in 1533, she brought into the
 country such vegetables as broccoli, artichokes, cabbage and haricot
 beans - and it is now widely accepted that this alone was sufficient
 to make the French hate her."

 The librarian interrupts you as you attempt to speak, and says, "The
 confusion between the usage of the present subjunctive and the past
 subjunctive is easily resolved as long as one remembers that the terms
 refer not to different times, but to differing sorts of uncertainty.
 Reference to time itself is only implied by the use of the past

 incorrect usage, it would be prudent not to take chances."

 The librarian interrupts you as you attempt to speak, and says, "While
 uncovering one's head is a symbol of respect in many cultures, in
 others the opposite is true. Some Indian religions, for example,
 require that a man's head remain covered at all times, giving rise to
 the use of the turban, or 'imamah.' The tabu against removing one's
 turban eventually became so strong that thieves who thought nothing of
 stealing a victim's clothes would nevertheless leave his turban
 undisturbed."

 The librarian says loudly, "Most historians ascribe Catherine de
 Medicis's poor reputation among the French to her ordering the
 wholesale massacre of French citizens in 1572. Recent research,
 however, has revealed that years before, in 1533, she brought into the
 country such vegetables as broccoli, artichokes, cabbage and haricot
 beans - and it is now widely accepted that this alone was sufficient
 to make the French hate her."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Manuscript Room</span>

 You are in the manuscript room, which contains a dusty collection of
 old books on obscure subjects. There is an old librarian here, on
 whose desk sits a handwritten sign that reads "Quiet, please." There
 are thousands of books behind glass cases. The only exit is to the
 west.

 You see an old book on the table.

 The detective is looking around with interest.

 As you look around, the librarian says loudly, "Louis I, son of
 Charlemagne, ascended France's throne in 814 A.D. He was the first to
 implement that country's secret policy of naming all their kings Louis
 in order to confuse enemy agents, historians, and their own peasants."

>hit librarian with oar


 The librarian launches off into another speech, and it distracts you
 from what you wanted to do. "The first workers' strike on record took
 place in Egypt in 1170 B.C., when labourers building a new pyramid in
 Thebes learned that their payroll had been delayed. They organized a
 protest, stopped working, and picketed the construction site carrying
 papyrus signs that read, 'Cash on the line, or you don't get your
 shrine.' Tradition also has it that the slogan they chanted was 'Stuff

 to the west, and King William Street continues to the southeast. On
 the wall is a small sign.

 A bank guard is lounging up against the wall, idly jangling some keys
 in his pocket while he watches a group of urchins playing in the
 street.

 One of the urchins looks strangely familiar to you.

 After staring at his dirty face for a few moments, you suddenly

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clock Tower</span>

 You are in the interior of the clock tower, high above the Houses of
 Parliament.

 The immense bell known as Big Ben is hanging from the ceiling,
 suspended over a hollow shaft that is so deep it might as well be
 bottomless. A wooden railing runs around the shaft for safety.

 Inside the bell, you see an enormous clapper, to which is glued a
 beautiful, deep-blue sapphire.

 Your friend is here, awaiting your next move.

 The bell swings towards you, ringing unbearably loud. BONG! You and
 Holmes clap your hands to your ears in an attempt to protect them,
 dropping everything you are carrying in the process.

>put paper in ears


 [The white piece of paper]

 You cannot do that because your hands are covering your ears.

 The bell swings away from you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Houses Of Parliament</span>

 You descend the stairs into the jam-packed entrance hall of the House
 of Commons.

 There are hundreds of people lined up to get in. But off to one side
 you see a flight of old stone steps leading up into the darkness.

 The detective walks into the room alongside you.

 Holmes says, "Watson, take that ridiculous thing out of your ears."
 You breath a sigh of relief as you take your hands away from your

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clock Tower</span>

 The stairs seem to wind up forever. Finally, you emerge into the
 interior of the clock tower, high above the Houses of Parliament.

 The immense bell known as Big Ben is hanging from the ceiling,
 suspended over a hollow shaft that is so deep it might as well be
 bottomless. A wooden railing runs around the shaft for safety.

 Inside the bell, you see an enormous clapper, to which is glued a
 beautiful, deep-blue sapphire.

 You see a black bag, a clue paper, a pound note, a pacquet of paper,
 an orange piece of paper, a brown piece of paper, a green piece of
 paper, a lamp, a magnifying glass, Captain Bligh's oar, a pistol and
 an old book.

 Your companion enters and begins pacing back and forth nervously.

 Holmes says, "Watson, take that ridiculous thing out of your ears."

 This is an attractive square at the foot of Whitehall. Large crowds

 The detective joins you and starts looking around with interest.

 A hansom cab pulls up beside you.

 The cab speeds through the streets, deftly weaving in and out of the
 jubilee traffic and whizzing past famous landmarks. Only a few minutes
 later, you arrive at your destination.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kensington Gardens</span>

 A tide of perambulators pushed by well-starched nannies surges along
 the crowded walk. Everywhere you look there are rows and rows of
 beautiful flowers.

 You see daisies, petunias, roses, peonies, marigolds, and a host of
 golden daffodils.

 You and Holmes get out of the cab. After you get out, it drives off.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sherman's Shop</span>

 You enter the cramped quarters of Sherman's shop. The old
 animal-trainer's eyes brighten up when he sees you.

 "You've probably come looking for Toby," he says. "But I'm afraid I
 won't be able to help you this time. Toby's not feeling too well, and
 all my other animals are already out on loan. All I have left is a
 half-trained pigeon."

 Your companion joins you and starts looking around with interest.

 Sherman is holding the pigeon.

 It isn't polite to take things without asking.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marylebone Road</span>

 You find yourself in a cab in front of Madame Tussaud's famous wax
 museum. From here the street continues east and west.

 The museum is closed for renovations, and there is a guard and a dog
 patrolling the street outside the entrance, which is just to the north
 of you. The guard lights a cigarette, tips his hat, and says, "Good
 day, Mr Holmes."

 In the distance, you hear Big Ben strike the hour.
 [Press any key to continue.]

 The guard has his collar turned up against the cold. He is pacing back

 futile effort to keep warm.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Madame Tussaud's</span>

 You come in off the street and are now standing in the lobby.

 All around you are wax statues of famous people. To the west is a dark
 and ominous-looking doorway with a sign over it. The exit to the
 street is to the south.

 Holmes drops to his hands and knees and begins a minute examination of
 the floor. After a few moments he cries, "Aha! Look here, Watson." He
 points to a miniscule speck of ash on the floor.

>examine holmes


 Your friend's brow is furrowed in intense concentration.

>examine sign



>examine ash


 It is dark, almost black, in colour, and quite flakey.

>ask holmes about ash


 "Note the characteristic texture, Watson. It is the ash of a
 Trichinopoly cigar, which is made from the dark tobacco that grows
 only in the Madras district of India.

 Unless I miss my guess, Watson, our mastermind friend has joined
 forces with an Indian accomplice who does his dirty work for him."

>examine ash with glass


 You train the magnifying glass on the cigar ash.
 It appears much larger now.

>examine ash


 It is dark, almost black, in colour, and quite flakey.

>examine statues


 The statues are of King John, Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh,
 and William the Conqueror.

>examine raleigh


 The sculpture shows Sir Walter Raleigh spreading his cloak across a
 mud puddle so Elizabeth could walk across without dirtying her shoes.

>examine drake


 The statue is of Sir Francis Drake finishing his game of bowls before
 sailing off to defeat the Spanish Armada.

 The statue is of William the Conqueror kneeling on the sand at
 Pevensey, where he landed before the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

 The statues are of Guy Fawkes, Charles I, and Saint Thomas Becket.

 Mortality, behold and fear!
 What a change of flesh is here!
 Think how many royal bones
 Sleep within this heap of stones:
 Here they lie, had realms and lands,
 Who now want strength
     to stir their hands.

          **********

 For two-score years I reigned alone,
 A virgin queen on England's throne.
 My navy caused Armada's shame,
 And with me died the Tudor name.

 The apple sorely tempted Eve,
 And Tell another aimed to cleave.
 But when one fell, it showed to me,
 The mighty pull of gravity.

 My father, it was said, would die,
 Beneath the Holy City's sky.
 Jerusalem his body claimed,
 And it is after him I'm named.

 Pigeons, pigeons, everywhere. You are in a cab in one of the great

 in 1805. Streets come in and go out at all angles, and everywhere you
 look there are people feeding pigeons.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Swan Lane</span>

 With increasing apprehension, you descend into Swan Lane, which runs
 along the waterfront of the Thames.

 It is a seedy, disreputable, run-down part of town that normally you
 wouldn't be caught dead in. After a moment's reflection, you wish you
 hadn't thought of it in quite those terms.

 To the west is the entrance to one of the least savory buildings you

 that the establishment was, in better days, known as the Bar of Gold.

 Fortunately, it is only a short walk back up the stairs to Lower
 Thames Street.

 Your friend joins you and starts looking around with interest.

 You arrive at the Victoria Embankment, on the left bank of the Thames.
 The river is crowded with pleasure boats here for the Jubilee.

 There is an incredibly old rowboat here. It's got one empty oarlock,

 Only a few minutes later, you arrive at your destination.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parliament Square</span>

 The Chamber is closed, but off to one side you see a flight of old
 stone steps leading up into the darkness.

 Your companion trails along after you.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clock Tower</span>

 The stairs seem to wind up forever. Finally, you emerge into the
 interior of the clock tower, high above the Houses of Parliament.

 The immense bell known as Big Ben is hanging from the ceiling,
 suspended over a hollow shaft that is so deep it might as well be
 bottomless. A wooden railing runs around the shaft for safety.

 Inside the bell, you see an enormous clapper, to which is glued a
 beautiful, deep-blue sapphire.

 Holmes walks into the room alongside you.

>wait


 Time passes...

 The bell swings towards you, ringing loudly, but the cotton protects
 your ears. Holmes claps his hands to his ears in an attempt to protect
 them. The clapper swings up within reach.

 Do you want to continue waiting?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Birdcage Walk</span>

 As you enter Birdcage Walk, your attention is diverted to a man who
 has set up a small souvenir stand near where the parade will pass on
 Tuesday. Oblivious to the fact that there are no crowds here to buy
 his wares, he is waving a handful of overpriced trinkets over his
 head.

 As soon as he sees you, the salesman says, "'Ere, Guv. Come early for

 You enter Threadneedle Street and are now in front of the Bank of
 England. The entrance to the bank is to the north, Cheapside leads off
 to the west, and King William Street disappears off into the darkness

 A bank guard is lounging up against the wall, idly jangling some keys
 in his pocket while he watches a group of urchins playing in the
 street.

 Wiggins is here.

 Wiggins casually strolls past the guard and says, "Cor blimey. That
 bird isn't 'alf built, is she?" While the guard's attention is
 diverted, Wiggins's hand flashes in and out of his pocket. Then just
 as casually as before, he strolls back to you, slips something into
 your hand, and whispers, "Sorry I couldn't get everything, guv. I 'ope

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Evangelist Chapel</span>

 Light! Warmth! There is a bank of candles here lit by devoted

 moments you actually become uncomfortable.

 One of the most unusual tombs in the Abbey is here.

 Your friend appears lost in deep thought.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Transept</span>

 You enter the North Transept of the Abbey, which is dominated by a
 beautiful rose window set high into the wall.

 A shaft of sunlight comes through the stained-glass window, lighting
 up one of the tombs, and relieving the general gloom of the Abbey's
 dark interior.

 The detective enters and begins pacing back and forth nervously.

 You are standing in the midst of a crowd of tourists in front of the
 west door of Westminster Abbey. The towers of the Abbey soar high
 above you, and you marvel at this perfect example of Gothic
 architecture, as generations have done before you.

 The Abbey door is open.

 On the wall next to the door is a small, discreet sign.

 Holmes drifts along after you, apparently lost in thought.

 "You've probably come looking for Toby," he says. "But I'm afraid I
 won't be able to help you this time. Toby's not feeling too well, and
 all my other animals are already out on loan. All I have left is a
 half-trained pigeon."

 You enter Covent Garden, which is the central market for all of
 London. Everywhere you look there are stalls packed with produce from
 the English countryside.

 The open-air market is crowded with housewives who are shopping for
 fruits and vegetables.

 After looking around for a few moments, you see a crowd of women
 gathered around a girl who has collapsed on the ground. Her lifeless
 hand clutches a bunch of flowers.

 Your companion drifts along after you, apparently lost in thought.

 she opens her eyes.

 The crowd breaks into applause, and they help her to her feet. When
 she is standing, she smiles at you shyly and puts a lovely carnation
 in your lapel as a gesture of thanks.

 Just then, a distinguished-looking gentleman appears on the scene,
 takes her by the arm, and says, "Come, Eliza. We mustn't be late for
 the ball."

 He escorts her away, but as she leaves, she glances back at you once
 more with a grateful expression in her lovely eyes.

 You come in off the street and are now standing in the lobby.

 All around you are wax statues of famous people. To the west is a dark

 Holmes drops to his hands and knees and begins a minute examination of
 the floor. After a few moments he cries, "Aha! Look here, Watson." He
 points to a miniscule speck of ash on the floor.

 Holmes says, "It's obviously not one of the Crown Jewels, Watson. In
 fact, this gem belongs to the Agra treasure, which was stolen in India
 many years ago and has never been recovered."

 "The case grows more complex, Watson. We are in more danger than I had
 at first suspected." He removes a ring from one of his long, slender
 fingers and hands it to you. "Here, Watson. Take this signet ring of
 mine. If anything should happen to me, take it to my brother Mycroft
 at the Diogenes Club. He'll tell you what to do."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marylebone Road</span>

 You go out the door and are now standing in front of Madame Tussaud's
 famous wax museum. From here the street continues east and west.

 The museum is closed for renovations, and there is a guard and a dog
 patrolling the street outside the entrance, which is just to the north
 of you. The guard lights a cigarette, tips his hat, and says,
 "Goodbye, Mr Holmes."

 You see a matchbook, a burnt match and a lamp.

 jubilee traffic and whizzing past famous landmarks. Only a few minutes
 later, you arrive at your destination.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Covent Garden</span>

 You enter Covent Garden, which is the central market for all of
 London. Everywhere you look there are stalls packed with produce from
 the English countryside.

 The open-air market is crowded with housewives who are shopping for
 fruits and vegetables.

 After looking around for a few moments, you see a crowd of women
 gathered around a girl who has collapsed on the ground. Her lifeless
 hand clutches a bunch of flowers.

 You take the yellow pill out of the brown bottle.

 You give her the yellow pill.

 Nothing happens for a moment, but then her eyelids flutter briefly and
 she opens her eyes.

 The crowd breaks into applause, and they help her to her feet. When
 she is standing, she smiles at you shyly and puts a lovely carnation
 in your lapel as a gesture of thanks.

 Just then, a distinguished-looking gentleman appears on the scene,
 takes her by the arm, and says, "Come, Eliza. We mustn't be late for
 the ball."

 He escorts her away, but as she leaves, she glances back at you once
 more with a grateful expression in her lovely eyes.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sherman's Shop</span>

 You enter the cramped quarters of Sherman's shop. The old
 animal-trainer's eyes brighten up when he sees you.

 "You've probably come looking for Toby," he says. "But I'm afraid I
 won't be able to help you this time. Toby's not feeling too well, and
 all my other animals are already out on loan. All I have left is a
 half-trained pigeon."

 in 1805. Streets come in and go out at all angles, and everywhere you
 look there are people feeding pigeons.

 The square is dominated by Nelson's Column, a 167 foot tall Corinthian

 As you enter Birdcage Walk, your attention is diverted to a man who

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Threadneedle Street</span>

 You emerge into Threadneedle Street and are now in front of the Bank
 of England. The entrance to the bank is to the north, Cheapside leads
 off to the west, and King William Street disappears off into the
 darkness to the southeast. On the wall is a small sign.

 A group of urchins is playing in the street.

 Wiggins is here.

 Your friend walks alongside you.

 Suddenly, someone grabs you from behind, pins your arms to your sides,
 and covers up your head. You struggle fiercely to get loose, but to no
 avail. Then you hear a voice shout, "Let him go, we've got the other
 one."

 The person holding you knocks you on the head and flings you to the
 ground. You lose consciousness for a few moments, and when you awake,
 you are alone.

 Sherlock Holmes has been kidnapped.

 Wiggins says, "I saw it all, guv'nor. But it was over before I could

 "Right-o."

 The cab speeds through the streets, whizzing past famous landmarks.
 Only a few minutes later, you arrive at your destination.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trafalgar Square</span>

 Pigeons, pigeons, everywhere. You are in a cab in one of the great
 open spaces of London, named for Nelson's naval victory over Napoleon
 in 1805. Streets come in and go out at all angles, and everywhere you
 look there are pigeons.

 The square is dominated by Nelson's Column, a 167 foot tall Corinthian
 column with a statue of Nelson on the top and a bronze relief on the
 pedestal at the bottom.

 The entrance to the Diogenes Club is to the west.

 The fog swirls around you.

 You and Wiggins get out of the cab. After you get out, it drives off.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Diogenes Club</span>

 You enter the hushed atmosphere of the Diogenes Club. The furnishings
 are aging and opulent. The members are aging and asleep. The only exit
 is to the east.

 An ancient butler totters forward to greet you and says in a barely
 audible whisper, "May I be of some assistance?"

 The boy follows you.

>ask butler about mycroft


 The butler listens to you and then leaves. He comes back shortly.

 "Mr Mycroft Holmes requires that you offer some token to verify that
 you are indeed the person you claim to be. Give whatever it is to me
 and I will take it to him."

>give ring to butler


 The butler accepts the item and asks you to wait while he takes it to
 Mr Mycroft Holmes.

 After a few moments, Mycroft Holmes appears. He looks very worried.

 "Sherlock warned me that you might come," he says. "And the fact that
 you are here indicates that he is indeed in trouble. I believe that in
 order to solve this mystery, you are going to have to go to the Tower
 of London. It will be closed, but you can give the password 'Cleves'
 to the guard at the Byward Tower. He will let you in. Good luck."

 Mycroft pauses before he goes and looks at you meditatively, as if
 trying to decide if he can put his faith in you to rescue his brother.
 After a moment he gives his head an unconscious nod, then turns around
 and disappears back into the club.

 You see an old boat.

 The urchin joins you and starts looking around with interest.

 The boat drifts down the river. Downstream you see the open seas...
 the strong currents would surely leave you stranded in your small boat
 if you were to drift further.

>row w


 You do not have any oars.

 Fighting against the current, you paddle upstream. Upstream, you see
 the London Bridge, to the north you see the Traitors Gate.

 As you and Wiggins get out of the boat, its red-faced owner runs up
 and yells, "You again?!!" He gives you a swift kick in the rear.

 The man jumps into the boat, launches it, and suddenly realizes he has
 no way to steer it. The last you see of him, he is drifting down the
 Thames, screaming and shaking his fist at you.

 Only a few minutes later, you arrive at your destination.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Swan Lane</span>

 With increasing apprehension, you descend into Swan Lane, which runs
 along the waterfront of the Thames.

 It is a seedy, disreputable, run-down part of town that normally you
 wouldn't be caught dead in. After a moment's reflection, you wish you
 hadn't thought of it in quite those terms.

 To the west is the entrance to one of the least savory buildings you
 have ever seen. There is a faded sign above the door that informs you
 that the establishment was, in better days, known as the Bar of Gold.

 Fortunately, it is only a short walk back up the stairs to Lower
 Thames Street.

 Your companion drifts along after you.

 Wiggins jumps nervously and then says, "Crikey! You scared me. Don't
 sneak up on people that way."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Embankment</span>

 You are standing on the Victoria Embankment, on the left bank of the
 Thames. The river is barely visible through the thick fog.

 Your companion appears fascinated by everything.

>go to bar of gold


 [You must be more specific.]

 In the distance, you hear Big Ben strike the hour.
 [Press any key to continue.]
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Thames Street</span>

 Upper Thames Street runs east and west between the Embankment and
 Lower Thames Street.

 Your assistant drifts along after you.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Thames Street</span>

 You enter Lower Thames Street. Roads lead off in many directions, some
 more savory than others. There is a set of particularly slovenly
 stairs leading down to an alley that runs alongside the river.

 Wiggins follows you.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Swan Lane</span>

 With increasing apprehension, you descend into Swan Lane, which runs
 along the waterfront of the Thames.

 It is a seedy, disreputable, run-down part of town that normally you
 wouldn't be caught dead in. After a moment's reflection, you wish you
 hadn't thought of it in quite those terms.

 To the west is the entrance to one of the least savory buildings you
 have ever seen. There is a faded sign above the door that informs you
 that the establishment was, in better days, known as the Bar of Gold.

 Fortunately, it is only a short walk back up the stairs to Lower
 Thames Street.

 The boy walks alongside you.

>go west


 Wiggins says, "You must be stark raving bonkers. That's the most
 dangerous place in London. I'll wait out here, thank you very much!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bar Of Gold</span>

 After fighting the urge to turn and run, you enter and find yourself
 in the Bar of Gold, the most infamous opium den in London. The
 proprietor is a most unsavory character who gives you a sidelong
 glance as you enter and then ignores you.

 Akbar takes the garnet and examines it closely. Then he says, "I must
 ask you to come with me, sir. But first, I ask that you give me all
 that you carry." He takes everything you give him, and then apologizes
 as he places a blindfold over your eyes. He leads you down a series of
 long winding corridors. You hear a door close behind you, and when he
 finally removes the blindfold, you are standing in Moriarty's lair.
 Akbar locks the door behind you, drops the key on Moriarty's desk, and
 piles most of what you were carrying onto the floor.

 At last you come face to face with the evil Professor. He is sitting
 placidly behind his desk, looking at you as if you were some botanical
 specimen.

 As you look around the room, you see Sherlock Holmes tied to a chair.
 He is only inches away from the Crown Jewels, which Moriarty has
 spread out on his desk, the better to taunt Holmes.

 Holmes looks up and says, "Ah, there you are Watson." He turns his
 head towards Moriarty and says, "You see, Professor, you grossly
 underestimate the intelligence and determination of your fellow
 countrymen."

 "Watson," he continues. "The Professor and I have just been chatting
 about why he led us on this merry chase. If you care to ask him, I'm
 sure he would be happy to fill you in as well."

 That's impossible.

 You take a deep breath. Holmes notices your action and surreptitiously
 does likewise.

>take ampoule


 Moriarty's normally emotionless features dissolve in rage. He shouts
 at Akbar, "Why didn't you take that from him when you brought him in?"

 The outburst startles Akbar into momentary inaction, but he quickly

>break ampoule


 You break open the ampoule. The etherium is released into the room.
 You see everyone but Holmes pass out.

>untie holmes


 You untie Holmes, keeping the rope.

 You can't hold your breath much longer...

>tie akbar to moriarty


 You tie Akbar to Moriarty.

 Your lungs scream for air. You take a deep breath.

 The etherium knocks you out.

 You awaken slowly and stumble to your feet. Moriarty and Akbar have
 already recovered, and they are struggling fiercely to free
 themselves. It seems as if you were unconscious for quite a while, but
 it's hard to tell. You probably don't have a lot of time.

 When you emerge from the lair you are momentarily disoriented,
 blinking your eyes in the bright sunlight. After a few moments, you

 You notice that the sun has risen... as much as it ever does in
 England.

 A hansom cab pulls up beside you.

 You and Holmes get into the cab.

 "Where to, guv'nor?"

 "Right-o."

 The cab speeds through the streets, deftly weaving in and out of the
 jubilee traffic and whizzing past famous landmarks. Only a few minutes
 later, you arrive at your destination.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Queens Gardens</span>

 You are in a cab outside the gate to Buckingham Palace.

 A Palace guard is here.

>out


 You and Holmes get out of the cab. After you get out, it drives off.

>show jewels to guard


 The Palace guard examines the regalia closely and then disappears
 inside the palace. Moments later, he reappears with the Prime
 Minister, who quickly ushers you and Holmes into the presence of the
 Queen.

 Overcome by emotion, for a few moments she says nothing. Finally she
 smiles and says, "Once again, Mr Holmes, we find ourselves in your
 debt. Until now you have always refused our offers of gratitude. Do
 you intend to refuse your Queen yet again?"

 Holmes returns her smile. "I do, Your Majesty. But only because your
 thanks would be misdirected. It is Doctor Watson here who deserves
 your gratitude."

 The Queen turns her gaze towards you. "Indeed? And what reward would
 you ask of us, Doctor?"

 Flustered, you stammer something about the service itself being reward
 enough, and before you know it you have been royally thanked and
 ushered back out of the palace into Queens Gardens. There, you and
 Holmes join the cheering multitudes who greet the Queen when, promptly
 at 9:00 and wearing the full regalia, she steps onto the balcony to
 begin the Coronation Day festivities.
