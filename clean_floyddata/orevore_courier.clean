 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 The OKAY button is blinking again.

 Its ridiculously bright yellow light makes everyone in the room appear
 to be suffering from inttermittent jaundice.  Fortunately you're the
 only one in the room, because there's no room in here for anyone else.
 The OKAY button is also buzzing, with the patented Elevated
 Responsiveness Tone guaranteed to remain irritating no matter how
 often one is forced to hear it.  Somehow the most annoying part,
 though, is that the blinking and the buzzing are slightly out of sync.

 Your "station" is a solid metal enclosure just barely large enough to
 accommodate your chair and yourself.  On the wall in front of you are
 the many brightly-colored controls of the security console and a
 black-and-white monitor.

 On the monitor you can see Engineer Ghee performing calisthenics in
 the engine room.  Presumably the machinery is operating normally.

 With a great deal of effort, you chew and swallow the nutricube.  You

 The Freezer Room button lights up, and the Cargo Bay button goes dark.

 On the monitor you can see the orevore still slowly pulsating exactly
 as expected, and though this should be reassuring, it nevertheless
 gives you the free-floating yoamies.

 The OKAY button continues its blinking and buzzing efforts to attract
 your attention.

>examine orevore
 The orevore is so remarkable an animal as to strain credulity.  It's a
 100-pound gelatinous lump with a convoluted surface, very much
 resembling a grotesquely oversized cerebrum.  It eats almost anything,
 including solid rock, and it excretes chemically-pure nodules of any
 element it ingests with an atomic number greater than 77.  For this
 reason it is the most prized possession of every mining colony that
 can manage to acquire one.  The orevore goes dormant at temperatures
 below 23 degrees, which is why the freezer room is so important.

 The OKAY button continues its blinking and buzzing efforts to attract
 your attention.

>push brdg
 The Bridge button lights up, and the Freezer Room button goes dark.

 On the monitor you can see Pilot Sharl assiduously studying his

 The OKAY button continues its blinking and buzzing efforts to attract

 The Docking Bay button lights up, and the Bridge button goes dark.

 On the monitor you can see the clean, empty expanse of the docking
 bay.  It serves primarily as a buffer between the hull and the
 precious contents of the freezer room.

 The OKAY button continues its blinking and buzzing efforts to attract
 your attention.

>push okay
 As you press the OKAY button, the noise gets even louder, and you
 instinctively draw back your hand, wondering what you've done wrong.
 Along with the sound of the Onboard Emergency Oscillator, you hear a
 serious voice say "Warning!  Shielding is offline.  Alert!  There is a
 hull breach on the bridge.  Please remain seated as pressure suits are
 automatically deployed."

 The Engine Room button lights up, and the Docking Bay button goes
 dark.

 On the monitor you can see Ghee is hastening back to his seat.

 A pressure suit falls heavily from the ceiling, landing right next to
 your chair.

>wear suit
 (first taking the pressure suit)
 You lean over the side of your chair and drag the pressure suit into
 your lap.

 It's easily as heavy as it looks, with its recirculating air filters,
 automated thermal regulators, waste handling units, and integrated
 speakers.  If there's a lightweight version of all this paraphernalia,
 it must be more expensive than the heavy stuff.

 You put on the pressure suit despite your misgivings about its
 comfort.

 A satisfied voice says "Air pressure on the bridge has stabilized at
 zero point three atmospheres."

 On the monitor you can see Ghee struggling to get into his pressure
 suit.  It looks like he's putting it on backwards.

>examine ghee
 His surprisingly uncoordinated efforts at dressing himself scarcely
 detract from his character.

 On the monitor you can see Ghee continuing to wrestle with his
 pressure suit.  He trips into the machinery with one leg in the suit
 and one leg out.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to laugh.

>laugh
 You manage a forced-sounding chuckle.

 On the monitor you can see Ghee disentangling himself from the
 machinery and stumbling backwards.

 You can hear something just outside your door.

>laugh
 You manage a forced-sounding chuckle.

 On the monitor you can see Ghee working his hands into his gloves.
 You're fairly certain that he has only the usual number of fingers.

 You can hear something just outside your door.

>sing
 You begin to sing "The Orevore Sonnet":

 In caverns measureless to man
 Within a certain planet's core

 On the monitor you can see Ghee finally sealing up his pressure suit.
 He uses some colorful metaphors as he works the latches on his helmet.

 You can hear something just outside your door.

>push cargo
 The Cargo Bay button lights up, and the Engine Room button goes dark.

 The monitor shows Pilot Sharl turning slowly toward the camera.  He's
 all right!  Except... Except that he shouldn't be all right.  With a
 sizable fragment of rock jutting out of a gaping wound in his skull,
 he shouldn't be all right at all.

 On the monitor you can see Sharl clawing at your door, moaning
 "Brains!  Braaaaaaaaaains!" and other less intelligible noises.  How
 ironic it is that the fellow who wants you for your brains is a
 walking corpse.

 You feel the reverberation of a distant explosion.

 A wary voice calls out "Alert!  An explosion has been detected in the
 docking bay.  The hatch mechanisms have been damaged.  Please use
 caution when effecting repairs."

>examine sharl
 He couldn't possibly have survived an injury like that, but he's still
 walking around.

>push dock
 The Docking Bay button lights up, and the Cargo Bay button goes dark.

 The monitor shows four persons in the docking bay who are completely
 unknown to you.  That they wear shabby spacesuits without
 organizational insignia, however, suggests only one likely explanation
 for their unexpected presence on your vessel.  These men must be
 pirates.

 On the monitor you can see the cargo bay door automatically opening as
 the burly pirate approaches.  Noting this, the bearded pirate barks
 "Meat!  You and Filthy go plunder the cargo.  We'll divvy the booty
 later."  Quickly obeying, the dirt-covered pirate follows the burly
 pirate through the open door.

 The image of Ghee's crushed corpse bears silent testimony to the
 violence of the attack upon your ship.

 Which do you mean, the nervous-looking pirate or the bearded pirate?

 His bushy beard and anachronistic eyeglasses look just as out-of-place
 as a peg leg or a parrot would be.  He seems to be completely serious
 about his profession, however.

 On the monitor you can see the bearded pirate sizing up the freezer
 room door.  He sagaciously determines that the adjacent wall is not as
 formidably reinforced, and starts sawing into the wall with his
 cutmore.  "Keep a sharp lookout, Puppet", he adds as an afterthought.
 "Aye, Captain", the nervous-looking pirate replies.  Almost
 immediately, a plume of vapor erupts from the area being perforated.

 An insistent voice says "Alert!  The freezer room cooling systems are
 no longer functional.  This is a critical repair item which supersedes
 all non-critical priorities."

>examine nervous
 Always in motion, the fellow is.  His arms, legs, and face twitch
 constantly as he looks all around for potential dangers.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain slicing through the wall
 to the freezer room.  His cutmore spits sparks as he makes progress
 with his work.

 A quick glance at the Chiller Thermostat shows the temperature of the
 freezer room to be about 40 degrees and rising.

>push open
 On the monitor you can see the doors to the cargo bay and the engine
 room open for a few seconds.  The freezer room door must be jammed.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain slicing through the wall

>push xmit
 The Transmit button lights up to indicate that subsequent video
 playback will be transmitted to the location being monitored.  If you
 were to now press the Play button, a remote display in the docking bay
 would show your most recent recording.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain slicing through the wall
 to the freezer room.  His cutmore spits sparks as he makes progress
 with his work.

 You are separated from the docking bay by no fewer than two walls that
 you have no means of breaching.  The image on the monitor is just
 that, an image.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain opening a hole in the
 wall with his cutmore.  As he peers into the freezer room, he says
 "Arr!  We've found the beastie!  Puppet, fetch the hoversled!"
 Through the hatch, Puppet exits the ship.

>push copy
 The Copy button beeps cheerfully to indicate that it has accomplished
 its function.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain standing around looking
 as gruff as possible.  He taps his foot impatiently.

>push play
 The remote display in the docking bay plays a recording of the pirates
 breaching the freezer room wall.

 Directly addressing your camera, the pirate captain says "Keep an even
 keel, lad, and there'll be no harm coming to ye."

 On the monitor you can see Puppet entering the docking bay with a
 hoversled just as Meat and Filthy enter with blood in their eyes and
 "Brains!" on their lips.  As the pirate captain takes command of the
 hoversled and pushes it towards the freezer room, he says "Hold fast,
 me hearty!"

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet frantically firing his dissolver,
 but this does not prevent Meat and Filthy from knocking him to the
 ground and fighting over his corpse.

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet acquiring the same creepy
 characteristics as Meat and Filthy.  The three cadaverous creatures
 march into the freezer room searching for more "brains!"

>wait

 On the monitor you can see the once-pristine docking bay, now a scene
 of carnage.

>wait

 On the monitor you can see the two pirates suddenly faced by a
 ravening Sharl who charges them with a bellowing call for
 "Braaaains!".  They both somehow remember to fire their weapons, and
 blast several holes straight through their attacker.  Sharl continues
 his advance undaunted.

 An insistent voice says "Alert!  The freezer room cooling systems are

>push open
 On the monitor you can see the doors to the bridge and the docking bay

 On the monitor you can see Sharl knock down the dirt-covered pirate,
 who is so stunned that he scarcely resists.  As Sharl gnaws on his
 victim's skull, the larger pirate backs away from the gruesome scene,
 no longer trusting in the efficacy of his dissolver.

 A quick glance at the Chiller Thermostat shows the temperature of the
 freezer room to be about 40 degrees and rising.

>push lock
 The Lock button makes three clanging sounds in rapid succession,
 indicating that the cargo bay is secure.

 On the monitor you can see the burly pirate discovering an extensible
 support beam in the cargo, which he lifts with great effort.  He then
 swings it at Sharl and completely decapitates your unfortunate
 colleague.  The twice-dead pilot's body immediately collapses.

 he holds his arms stiffly in front of him.

 You set the Ship Thermostat to 100 degrees.

 On the monitor you can see the door to the cargo bay opening
 automatically as Sharl lurches through.  His pressure suit plugs a
 hole in the hull.

 The ship's powerful engines quickly heat the crew areas.

>wear suit
 (first taking the pressure suit)
 You lean over the side of your chair and drag the pressure suit into
 your lap.

 It's easily as heavy as it looks, with its recirculating air filters,
 automated thermal regulators, waste handling units, and integrated
 speakers.  If there's a lightweight version of all this paraphernalia,
 it must be more expensive than the heavy stuff.

 You put on the pressure suit despite your misgivings about its
 comfort.

 On the monitor you can see the abandoned bridge.  Sharl's instruments
 continue their flickering in his absence.  His pressure suit plugs a
 hole in the hull.

 You can hear something just outside your door.

>push freezer
 The Freezer Room button lights up, and the Bridge button goes dark.

 On the monitor you can see the orevore starting to pulse in a less
 than relaxing fashion.  As it recovers from its slumber it begins
 exploring the environment.

 You can hear something just outside your door.

>examine orevore
 The orevore is so remarkable an animal as to strain credulity.  It's a
 100-pound gelatinous lump with a convoluted surface, very much
 resembling a grotesquely oversized cerebrum.  It eats almost anything,
 including solid rock, and it excretes chemically-pure nodules of any
 element it ingests with an atomic number greater than 77.  For this
 reason it is the most prized possession of every mining colony that
 can manage to acquire one.  The orevore goes dormant at temperatures
 below 23 degrees, which is why the freezer room is so important.

 On the monitor you can see the orevore eating through the wall between
 the freezer room and the engine room.  This doesn't bode well for the
 highly important equipment located in the latter.  The orevore is
 probably uninterested in the alternate uses and functions of its food.

 You can hear something just outside your door.

 air handlers.

 The monitor shows four persons in the docking bay who are completely
 unknown to you.  That they wear shabby spacesuits without
 organizational insignia, however, suggests only one likely explanation
 for their unexpected presence on your vessel.  These men must be
 pirates.

 On the monitor you can see them searching the debris with dissolvers
 drawn.   The bearded one cruelly kicks at the lifeless body of poor
 Ghee.

 The image of Ghee's crushed corpse bears silent testimony to the
 violence of the attack upon your ship.

 You can hear something just outside your door.

 You feel the reverberation of a distant explosion.

 A perplexed voice begins rattling off a lengthy list of systems that

 The uniform is emblazoned with the logo of Transport High Command and
 a tiny black pip indicating your rank of Security Officer.

 A satisfied voice says "Air pressure on the bridge has stabilized at
 zero point three atmospheres."

 The monitor shows Pilot Sharl turning slowly toward the camera.  He's
 all right!  Except... Except that he shouldn't be all right.  With a
 sizable fragment of rock jutting out of a gaping wound in his skull,
 he shouldn't be all right at all.

 On the monitor you can see Sharl stagger unnaturally towards the door

 spirit haunting your own widely dispersed molecules is briefly
 amusing.

 You can hear something just outside your door.

 I didn't understand that number.

 You set the Chiller Thermostat to 100 degrees.

 room door.  He sagaciously determines that the adjacent wall is not as
 formidably reinforced, and starts sawing into the wall with his
 cutmore.  "Keep a sharp lookout, Puppet", he adds as an afterthought.
 "Aye, Captain", the nervous-looking pirate replies.  Almost
 immediately, a plume of vapor erupts from the area being perforated.

 An insistent voice says "Alert!  The freezer room cooling systems are
 no longer functional.  This is a critical repair item which supersedes
 all non-critical priorities."

>examine cutmore
 The cutmore is a portable power saw capable of slicing through almost
 anything with varying degrees of effort.  It is particularly favored
 by those who desire access to something which other persons have
 attempted to prevent them from accessing.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain slicing through the wall
 to the freezer room.  His cutmore spits sparks as he makes progress
 with his work.

>push cargo
 The Cargo Bay button lights up, and the Docking Bay button goes dark.

 On the monitor you can see the dirt-covered pirate and the burly
 pirate searching through the supplies in a desultory fashion.  They
 don't seem to be very satisfied with the selection.

>examine dirt
 From his appearance, one might conclude that his vessel is powered by
 coal, or perhaps recycled biological waste.  It's not clear that he
 has any familiarity with modern sanitation.

>examine burly
 From the way he ducks under the ceiling, he appears to be nearly seven
 feet tall, and more than proportionately wide.  The dissolver held in
 his massive hand only extends the reach of his destructive power.

>push lock
 The Lock button makes three clanging sounds in rapid succession,
 indicating that the cargo bay is secure.

>push open
 On the monitor you can see the doors to the bridge and the docking bay
 open for a few seconds.

 On the monitor you can see the two pirates suddenly faced by a
 ravening Sharl who charges them with a bellowing call for
 "Braaaains!".  They both somehow remember to fire their weapons, and
 blast several holes straight through their attacker.  Sharl continues
 his advance undaunted.

 You can only watch the monitor helplessly as the pirate captain fires
 his dissolver through the open door into the engine room.

 The Lock button makes a clanging sound meant to evoke the sound of a

 On the monitor you can see Ghee creating some complicated contraption
 on his workbench.  He frequently glances nervously at the door.

 You feel the reverberation of a distant explosion.

 A wary voice calls out "Alert!  An explosion has been detected in the
 docking bay.  The hatch mechanisms have been damaged.  Please use
 caution when effecting repairs."

>push dock
 The Docking Bay button lights up, and the Engine Room button goes

 Smoke clears from the docking bay, efficiently filtered by the ship's
 air handlers.

 The monitor shows four persons in the docking bay who are completely
 unknown to you.  That they wear shabby spacesuits without
 organizational insignia, however, suggests only one likely explanation
 for their unexpected presence on your vessel.  These men must be
 pirates.

 On the monitor you can see them searching the debris with dissolvers
 drawn.

>push copy
 The Copy button beeps cheerfully to indicate that it has accomplished
 its function.

 On the monitor you can see the cargo bay door automatically opening as
 the burly pirate approaches.  Noting this, the bearded pirate barks
 "Meat!  You and Filthy go plunder the cargo.  We'll divvy the booty
 later."  Quickly obeying, the dirt-covered pirate follows the burly
 pirate through the open door.

>push play
 The remote display in the engine room plays a recording of pirates in
 the docking bay.

 In the engine room, Ghee says "I'm working on it, okay?"

 A quick glance at the Chiller Thermostat shows the temperature of the

 The OKAY button is blinking again.

 Its ridiculously bright yellow light makes everyone in the room appear
 to be suffering from inttermittent jaundice.  Fortunately you're the
 only one in the room, because there's no room in here for anyone else.
 The OKAY button is also buzzing, with the patented Elevated
 Responsiveness Tone guaranteed to remain irritating no matter how
 often one is forced to hear it.  Somehow the most annoying part,
 though, is that the blinking and the buzzing are slightly out of sync.

 Orevore Courier
 An Interactive Adventure by Brian Rapp
 Release 2 / Serial number 071116 / Inform 7 build 4X60 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/11N)

 HELP is available.

 Your "station" is a solid metal enclosure just barely large enough to
 accommodate your chair and yourself.  On the wall in front of you are
 the many brightly-colored controls of the security console and a
 black-and-white monitor.

 On the monitor you can see Engineer Ghee performing calisthenics in
 the engine room.  Presumably the machinery is operating normally.

>push frzr
 The Freezer Room button lights up, and the Engine Room button goes

 On the monitor you can see the orevore still slowly pulsating exactly
 as expected, and though this should be reassuring, it nevertheless
 gives you the free-floating yoamies.

 The OKAY button continues its blinking and buzzing efforts to attract
 your attention.

>push okay
 As you press the OKAY button, the noise gets even louder, and you
 instinctively draw back your hand, wondering what you've done wrong.
 Along with the sound of the Onboard Emergency Oscillator, you hear a
 serious voice say "Warning!  Shielding is offline.  Alert!  There is a
 hull breach on the bridge.  Please remain seated as pressure suits are
 automatically deployed."

>push bridge
 The Bridge button lights up, and the Freezer Room button goes dark.

 On the monitor you can see Sharl slumped over his instruments,
 unmoving.  His pressure suit is wedged into a hole in the wall in
 front of him.

 A pressure suit falls heavily from the ceiling, landing right next to
 your chair.

>wear suit
 (first taking the pressure suit)
 You lean over the side of your chair and drag the pressure suit into
 your lap.

 It's easily as heavy as it looks, with its recirculating air filters,
 automated thermal regulators, waste handling units, and integrated
 speakers.  If there's a lightweight version of all this paraphernalia,
 it must be more expensive than the heavy stuff.

 You put on the pressure suit despite your misgivings about its
 comfort.

 A satisfied voice says "Air pressure on the bridge has stabilized at
 zero point three atmospheres."

 The monitor shows Pilot Sharl turning slowly toward the camera.  He's
 all right!  Except... Except that he shouldn't be all right.  With a
 sizable fragment of rock jutting out of a gaping wound in his skull,
 he shouldn't be all right at all.

 On the monitor you can see Sharl stagger unnaturally towards the door
 to the cargo bay.  His eyes stare vacantly, his mouth hangs slack, and
 he holds his arms stiffly in front of him.

>push copy
 The Copy button beeps cheerfully to indicate that it has accomplished
 its function.

 On the monitor you can see the door to the cargo bay opening
 automatically as Sharl lurches through.  His pressure suit plugs a

 ironic it is that the fellow who wants you for your brains is a
 walking corpse.

 On the monitor you can see Ghee finally sealing up his pressure suit.
 He uses some colorful metaphors as he works the latches on his helmet.

 The remote display in the engine room plays a recording of Sharl
 staggering to his feet.

 On the monitor you can see Ghee standing motionless as he watches the

 room, gathering every tool and gadget he can lay his hands on.  These
 he adds to the heap of technology on his workbench.

>push lock
 The Lock button makes a clanging sound meant to evoke the sound of a
 lock being securely locked.  The engine room is now secured.

 On the monitor you can see Ghee creating some complicated contraption
 on his workbench.  He frequently glances nervously at the door.

 You feel the reverberation of a distant explosion.

 A wary voice calls out "Alert!  An explosion has been detected in the
 docking bay.  The hatch mechanisms have been damaged.  Please use
 caution when effecting repairs."

>wait
 Time passes.

 The monitor shows two persons in the cargo bay who are completely
 unknown to you.  That they wear shabby spacesuits without
 organizational insignia, however, suggests only one likely explanation
 for their unexpected presence on your vessel.  These men must be
 pirates.

 On the monitor you can see the burly pirate and the dirt-covered
 pirate coming through the door to the cargo bay from the docking bay.

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see the two pirates suddenly faced by a
 ravening Sharl who charges them with a bellowing call for
 "Braaaains!".  They both somehow remember to fire their weapons, and
 blast several holes straight through their attacker.  Sharl continues
 his advance undaunted.

 An insistent voice says "Alert!  The freezer room cooling systems are
 no longer functional.  This is a critical repair item which supersedes
 all non-critical priorities."

>heat 0
 You set the Ship Thermostat to 0 degrees.

 On the monitor you can see Sharl knock down the dirt-covered pirate,
 who is so stunned that he scarcely resists.  As Sharl gnaws on his
 victim's skull, the larger pirate backs away from the gruesome scene,
 no longer trusting in the efficacy of his dissolver.

>cool 0
 The Chiller Thermostat is already set to 0 degrees.

 On the monitor you can see the burly pirate discovering an extensible
 support beam in the cargo, which he lifts with great effort.  He then
 swings it at Sharl and completely decapitates your unfortunate
 colleague.  The twice-dead pilot's body immediately collapses.

>push dock

 On the monitor you can see the bearded pirate slicing through the wall
 to the freezer room.  His cutmore spits sparks as he makes progress
 with his work.

 Always in motion, the fellow is.  His arms, legs, and face twitch
 constantly as he looks all around for potential dangers.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain opening a hole in the
 wall with his cutmore.  As he peers into the freezer room, he says
 "Arr!  We've found the beastie!  Puppet, fetch the hoversled!"
 Through the hatch, Puppet exits the ship.

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain standing around looking
 as gruff as possible.  He taps his foot impatiently.

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet entering the docking bay with a
 hoversled just as the burly pirate and the dirt-covered pirate enter
 with blood in their eyes and "Brains!" on their lips.  As the pirate
 captain takes command of the hoversled and pushes it towards the
 freezer room, he says "Hold fast, me hearty!"

 captain takes command of the hoversled and pushes it towards the
 freezer room, he says "Hold fast, me hearty!"

>push play
 The remote display in the docking bay plays a recording of a pirate
 decapitating Sharl.

 The recording clearly attracts the attention of Puppet.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet frantically firing his dissolver,
 but this does not prevent the burly pirate and the dirt-covered pirate
 from knocking him to the ground and fighting over his corpse.

>restore
>cf5
 Enter saved game to load: Ok.

>push cargo
 The Cargo Bay button lights up, and the Docking Bay button goes dark.

 On the monitor you can see the dirt-covered pirate and the burly
 pirate searching through the supplies in a desultory fashion.  They
 don't seem to be very satisfied with the selection.

>push open
 On the monitor you can see the doors to the bridge and the docking bay
 open for a few seconds.

 On the monitor you can see the two pirates suddenly faced by a
 ravening Sharl who charges them with a bellowing call for
 "Braaaains!".  They both somehow remember to fire their weapons, and
 blast several holes straight through their attacker.  Sharl continues
 his advance undaunted.

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Sharl knock down the dirt-covered pirate,
 who is so stunned that he scarcely resists.  As Sharl gnaws on his
 victim's skull, the larger pirate backs away from the gruesome scene,
 no longer trusting in the efficacy of his dissolver.

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see the burly pirate discovering an extensible
 support beam in the cargo, which he lifts with great effort.  He then
 swings it at Sharl and completely decapitates your unfortunate
 colleague.  The twice-dead pilot's body immediately collapses.

>push copy
 The Copy button beeps cheerfully to indicate that it has accomplished
 its function.

 On the monitor you can see the burly pirate bending down to check the
 vitals of his fallen comrade.  As he does so, the dirt-covered pirate
 abruptly reaches up to enfold him in a deadly embrace.

>push dock
 The Docking Bay button lights up, and the Cargo Bay button goes dark.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain opening a hole in the
 wall with his cutmore.  As he peers into the freezer room, he says
 "Arr!  We've found the beastie!  Puppet, fetch the hoversled!"
 Through the hatch, Puppet exits the ship.

>push play
 The remote display in the docking bay plays a recording of a pirate
 decapitating Sharl.

 Upon viewing the scene, the pirate captain exclaims "Well, blow me
 down!"

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain standing around looking
 as gruff as possible.  He taps his foot impatiently.

>push play
 The remote display in the docking bay plays a recording of a pirate
 decapitating Sharl.

 In the docking bay, the pirate captain scratches his head.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet entering the docking bay with a
 hoversled just as the burly pirate and the dirt-covered pirate enter
 with blood in their eyes and "Brains!" on their lips.  As the pirate
 captain takes command of the hoversled and pushes it towards the
 freezer room, he tosses Puppet his cutmore and says "Lop off their
 noggins, me hearty!"

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet deftly dispatching the dirt-covered
 pirate with a single swing of his cutmore.  His larger undead comrade
 just bellows "Brains!" all the louder.

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet chopping off the burly pirate's legs
 as an expedient method of reaching his neck with the cutmore.  Another
 swing effectively finishes the massive monster.

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet whispering to the decapitated pirate
 directly in front of your camera:  "Sorry, mate, but Captain will be
 getting his, you can be certain."

>push copy
 The Copy button beeps cheerfully to indicate that it has accomplished
 its function.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet striding away from the decapitated
 bodies of his comrades and into the freezer room.

>push freezer

 The Freezer Room button lights up, and the Docking Bay button goes
 dark.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet helping the pirate captain to load
 the orevore onto a hoversled.

>push play
 The remote display in the freezer room plays a recording of an
 incautious promise being made.

 The recording clearly attracts the attention of Puppet.

 On the monitor you can see the pirate captain aiming his dissolver
 directly at Puppet and saying "So, I'll be getting mine, will I?  And
 just what might that mean, you scurvy dog?"

> z
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet saying "Er, that you'll be getting
 your customary 70% of the profits, Captain..."

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet saying "Of course, with Meat and
 Filthy gone, that'll be, uh, 90% for you, Captain..."

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see Puppet being reduced to inchoate pleading
 sobs as he attempts to beg the pirate captain for mercy.  Finally the
 latter relents and says "Off with you, now, and don't think I won't
 have both eyes on you the whole way home."

>wait
 Time passes.

 On the monitor you can see the orevore being pushed out of the freezer
 room on a hoversled.

>push dock
 The Docking Bay button lights up, and the Freezer Room button goes
 dark.

 On the monitor you can see the orevore being hurriedly pushed out of
 the ship on a hoversled.

 The OKAY button starts blinking and buzzing again.

 contraption like a life preserver.

 At the appointed time exactly, the engines cut off, and you begin to
 float freely as you await contact from the colonists.  The silence is
 broken, however, by a very discomforting rattle as the entire ship
 begins to shudder.  You have just enough time to suspect that the
 deceleration equation has gone wrong before this hypothesis is
 thorougly confirmed by a titanic impact.

 The end of your voyage is almost as violent as the recent unpleasant
 events, as the ship's engines suddenly increase to maximum overthrust
 power.  You feel fairly flattened by the force of the sudden
 deceleration, but soon it eases and you feel trancendentally
 weightless.  When the colonists make their appointed contact they are
 perplexed by the additional craft attached to yours like a remora, but
 eager to solve the problem for you.  Ghee has some sharp words for
 Transport High Command when he learns that you've been dismissed for
 dereliction of duty, and tells them to come get their own pooilous
 ship.  Covetous is about to become wildly profitable, and the
 colonists invite you to accept new employment.  Soon you and Ghee are
 plying the spacelanes in your very own reconditioned pirate ship.  As
 plenipotentiary trade representatives, the universe is yours to
 explore.

>amusing

 The concept for "Orevore Courier" was essentially "Zombie Pirates in
 Space", a brutal combination of suggested themes.  That the
 protagonist is hermetically sealed away from the zombie pirates is the
 fault of the author alone.  There's not nearly enough button-pushing
 in your average zombie pirate story, right?  For less noise, try
 breaking the nutricube.  For more noise, try singing!

 The OKAY button is blinking again.

 Its ridiculously bright yellow light makes everyone in the room appear
 to be suffering from inttermittent jaundice.  Fortunately you're the
 only one in the room, because there's no room in here for anyone else.
 The OKAY button is also buzzing, with the patented Elevated
 Responsiveness Tone guaranteed to remain irritating no matter how
 often one is forced to hear it.  Somehow the most annoying part,
 though, is that the blinking and the buzzing are slightly out of sync.

 Orevore Courier
 An Interactive Adventure by Brian Rapp
 Release 2 / Serial number 071116 / Inform 7 build 4X60 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/11N)

 HELP is available.

 Your "station" is a solid metal enclosure just barely large enough to
 accommodate your chair and yourself.  On the wall in front of you are
 the many brightly-colored controls of the security console and a
 black-and-white monitor.

 On the monitor you can see Engineer Ghee performing calisthenics in
 the engine room.  Presumably the machinery is operating normally.

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

 The OKAY button continues its blinking and buzzing efforts to attract
 your attention.

>push food
 The console briefly opens a compartment and spits a nutricube into
 your lap as if happy to be rid of it.

 The OKAY button continues its blinking and buzzing efforts to attract
 your attention.

>break cube
 The nutricube bursts, showering the bottom of the console with
 unappetizing goo.  As it seeps into the circuitry, you hear a sad
 voice stammer: "Security... is not permitted... Daisy..." and then die
 out.

 The OKAY button silently flashes.

>sing
 You begin to sing "The Orevore Sonnet":

 In caverns measureless to man
 Within a certain planet's core

 The OKAY button silently flashes.

 There lives the untamed native clan
 Of nature's freak, the orevore.

 Soon hatched a cunning master plan
