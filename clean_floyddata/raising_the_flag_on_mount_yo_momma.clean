 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 "Yo momma's so fat when they take aerial photos they have to ask her
 to move out of the way!"

 Your heart is pounding and you find it hard to breathe. You didn't
 supect that the quips would hit this hard in real situation. Focus.
 Focus!

 "Yo momma's so ugly because her face is so ugly..."

 Oh man. You didn't just say that. You did. Oh man.

 The crowd starts booing and whistling. It's over. You blew it. Gus
 grins like a retard who has just plucked the last leg off a spider.
 You're not sure that you can find it in you to challenge him again.

 You're standing dumbfounded and humiliated on the stage of the Compass
 Club. There's nothing left to do than to swallow your defeat and climb
 down the stage.

>examine me
 This is it. You're here to win the insult battle championship, and
 you're ready for it. Maybe.

 Your hair is on a tight ponytail and you're wearing the most credible
 street clothes you own.

>inventory
 You're wearing your street clothes and a track jacket.

 The Stage
 You're standing dumbfounded and humiliated on the stage of the Compass
 Club. There's nothing left to do than to swallow your defeat and climb
 down the stage.

>go down

 Dance floor (center of the club)
 This is the center of the Compass Club. Most people don't orient
 themselves in relation to compass directions, but here it's more than
 natural. A huge compass rose is painted to the ceiling and the
 abbreviations of cardinal directions are painted on the walls.

 To north there's the stage where you can challenge Gus by just
 climbing on to it. The club continues in every other direction.

 It looks as if somebody in a dark corner table to the southeast is
 making a "come here" gesture.

>swallow defeat
 Gulp.

 Dark corner (SE corner)
 The sharp spotlights in this corner of the club create dark and gloomy
 shadows around the tables.

 A mysterious stranger sits behind a table, gesturing you to sit on the
 chair opposite to him.

>examine stranger
 Shadows cover the mysterious stranger completely, showing only a dark
 silhouette.

>sit on chair
 "You blew it up there, kid," the stranger says. "Blew it big time."

 You feel your cheeks getting red. "Oh yeah? Who are you to judge?"

 You're about to get up but he raises his hand. "I speak from
 experience. But don't worry, kid, I see you have potential. The game
 is not over yet. I can help you win the championship. If you're up for
 it."

 "Who... Who are you?"

 He leans forward into the spotlight and reveals his face. An eyepatch
 covers the old man's right eye and a wide scar runs below it, from the
 right temple to the left side of his neck. You jolt backwards, not
 because of the grotesque sight, but because you recognize him.

 It's Joe Mahma.

>insult joe
 "Uh... Yo momma's so fat because she eats a lot..."

 "If I insulted you back, you couldn't sleep for months without
 horrible nightmares," he remarks dryly.

 "Joe Mahma! No way!" you gasp.

 "I see you know me, kid. Good to know somebody still does."

 Of course you know who Joe Mahma is. Everybody knows Joe Mahma. He's a
 living legend, the infamous grandmaster of Yo Momma insult battles.

 "Look, kid, you want my help or not?"

>Joe, yes
>yes
 "Ok then. Listen carefully. I know and you know you're not ready to
 take Gus head on. But here's the thing. A sharp tongue is all good and
 fine but when you really want to knock your opponent off their feet
 you have to strike hard. And nothing hurts more than truth. You follow
 me?"

 "Not really," you confess.

 "Pay attention now! Do some reconnaissance. Dig out some facts and use
 them against him. When you have enough information, just think of what
 you have learned and the right insult will come to you. Got it?"

 "Snoop around for embarassing facts, draw inspiration from them. Got
 it."

 "That's the spirit! Go for it, kid!"

>ask joe about gus
 (To interact with people you can TALK TO them, INSULT them or SHOW
 things to them.)

>talk to joe
 "So you want me to snoop around for inspiration?"

 "Yes! Find your opponent's soft spots. Once you've found what would
 really push him off his feet, challenge him again with renewed
 confidence."

 You spot a thermostat mounted on the wall next to the doors.

 club by simply typing the name of the location where you want to go,
 or a name of a person in the location. You can also see the list of
 all locations by commanding MAP.)

 Bar (western side)
 A club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a bar. The selection is
 written on a chalkboard behind the counter next to an educational
 poster.

 The barkeep is busy serving drinks to thirsty clubbers.

 A bouncer is standing next to the door with his arms crossed.

 You spot a thermostat mounted on the wall next to the doors.

>talk to bouncer
 There's nothing you really want to say to him.

>examine thermostat
 The thermostat has only two settings: warm and cool. It's currently in
 the "cool" position.

>set thermostat to warm
 "Hey! Keep your hands off that!" the bouncer shouts. "With this amount
 of people here they would sweat their clothes off if the air
 conditioning wouldn't keep them cooled!"

>examine bouncer
 The bouncer doesn't look like he's in the perfect job for him, being
 quite scrawny actually.

>insult bouncer
 You don't want to get thrown out!

>hit bouncer
 Probably not a good idea. He's scrawny for a bouncer, but you're no
 muscleman either.

 Arcade corner (SW corner)
 In this corner of the club there's a collection of arcade machines.
 This is where all the tough kids like to hang out.

 Speaking of tough kids, Vincent is hacking away on one of the
 machines.

 There's a tall plant standing in the corner.

>examine plant
 It's possibly some sort of small palm tree, creating atmosphere.

>search tree
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine vincent
 Vincent is a bully. There's nothing that makes him happier than
 beating up people, and that's the only thing he's good at.

>talk to vincent
 There's really nothing to discuss with Vincent. It's a small miracle
 he can form even basic sentences.

>insult vincent
 "Hey Vincent," you say. "Word on the street is that yo momma's so fat
 she weighs a lot."

 Vincent stops in his tracks. You can hear gears turning in his head.
 He turns around, grabs you by the collar and lifts you in the air.
 "Who's been sayin' that? Talk ya little punk!"

 Good ol' Vincent. No matter how lame the insult, you can count on him
 getting agitated.

 ?
>talk to vincent
 Better not use that many words. Anything above one word is probably
 too much for Vincent's pea-brain to understand.

 ?
>go north
>examine arcade
 "You're just joking, right?" he says and shoves you off before turning
 to the arcade machine again.

 You recognize some of the names: Bubble Bobble, Pong, Zork, Tetris.
 Really old stuff. Vincent is fervously bashing the keys of something
 called 'Escapade!'.

>vincent, bouncer

 Vincent looks like he's thinking hard, even though that's unlikely. "I

 finish my game," he concludes and lets you go.

 You're not here to play games.

 Bar (western side)
 A club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a bar. The selection is
 written on a chalkboard behind the counter next to an educational
 poster.

 The barkeep is busy serving drinks to thirsty clubbers.

 A dubious-looking guy is leaning on the counter.

>examine barkeep
 You see nothing special about the barkeep.

>examine dubious
 The dubious-looking guy is an obnoxious mix of overconfidence and
 desperation in its mid-30s. He wears a cheap white suit with large
 collars and matching shoes. His shirt is unbuttoned halfway down
 showcasing an uneven patch of chest hair. A thick layer of grease
 keeps his hair combed back.

 The guy notices you looking at him and flashes a bleached smile.

 "Well hello there sparkly-eyes!" the guy says. "My name is Sleazeball
 McDouchebag, but you can call me Sleaze."

 (That's not what he actually says, but that's what your brain hears.)

>insult sleaze
 "Ooh, I love it when women talk dirty! Let me have it, girl!"

>buy drink
 Which do you mean, the cola, the tonic, the gin, the wine, the beer,
 or the vodka?

>hit him

 "Ooh, feisty! Show me your claws, tiger girl!"

>buy vodka
 You don't have any money. Besides it's very hard to get a drink
 without papers here.

>talk to barkeep
 "Sorry, too busy to chat," the barkeep says and moves on to the next
 customer.

>read poster
 "Watch out! Don't leave your drink unguarded!" It has a picture of a
 boogey man dropping a skull-marked pill into a cocktail glass.

>talk to guy

 "How old are you, angelface?"

 "Sevent--"

 "Twenty-one, eh? Perfect." He pulls mouthspray from his pocket and
 squirts it five or six times in his mouth.

 The menu shows they have cola, tonic, gin, wine, beer, and vodka in
 their selection.

>buy cola
 You don't have any money.

 This is not a karaoke bar.

 You bust a few moves.

>go north

 VIP lounge (NW corner)
 The area is reserved to those with VIP passes. There are cushy red
 sofas to sit on and you don't have to worry about drunken idiots
 crashing your table.

 A guard is making sure no-one without a pass gets in.

 Britney, the bimbo girlfriend of Gus, sits on a couch looking bored.

>examine britney
 Britney and Gus are a perfect match. He's full of hot air and her head
 is full of air. She sits there in her tiny tiny skirt and top looking
 like a circus clown in her face plastered with makeup.

>talk to britney
 "Ma'am, this area is off limits for anyone without a VIP pass," the
 guard says when you try to approach Britney.

>insult guard
 You don't feel like you would gain much from insulting the guard.

>inventory
 You're wearing your street clothes and a track jacket.

>talk to guard
 "On duty. Can't talk," the guard says bluntly.

>examine jacket
 The track jacket is the latest craze. Everybody who's somebody has to
 have one. It's way oversized, just like it should be.

>examine street clothes
 You express your individuality by wearing baggy hip-hop clothes, just
 like everyone else.

>insult britney
 "Ma'am, this area is off limits for anyone without a VIP pass," the
 guard says when you try to approach Britney.

 Norbert is standing here near the dance floor.

>examine norbert
 Norbert is, to be blunt, a nerd. He's swaying there in his striped
 collar shirt, just too short pants and glasses with lenses thicher
 than his legs. What he's doing here is anybody's guess.

>insult norbert
 "Yo momma's so fat and stupid!"

 "El oh el! I see what you did there!"

 If you can't taunt even Norbert, you're really in a big trouble.

>talk to norbert
 "What are you doing here, Norbert?"

 He corrects the position of his glasses. "Well... uh... hello there!
 Say, I am in fact in the process of researching for my essay about
 this contemporary art of verbal derogatory assertions of one's
 contender's maternal parent. My theory is that it is, in fact, a
 thespian artform by..."

 she doesn't have any money."

 Vincent stops in his tracks. You can hear gears turning in his head.

 "Who's been sayin' that? Talk ya little punk!"

>norbert
 "That pencilneck? He'll eat through a straw for a month," Vincent says
 and storms to the dance floor.

 He goes straight to Norbert, exchanges a few words and starts to slap
 him around. The bouncer sees this and leaves his post to cool things
 down.

 Hall of Fame (eastern side)
 Just being here makes your heart beat faster. The walls are adorned by
 portraits of past champions, each of them a part of great history.

 Ralph, one of Gus's goons, is sitting here with a satchel.

 An old jukebox sits under the pictures.

>examine ralph
 Ralph is one of those dungbeetles who cling onto Gus for hopes that
 his fame would somehow rub off and transfer onto them. He must have
 some task, otherwise he wouldn't be so far away from his hero.

 Looks like the commotion on the dance floor is dying down.

>talk to ralph
 "What's going on, Ralph?"

 "Get lost, squirt. There's nothing here for you," he says.

>examine satchel
 You recognize Gus's satchel. Or man-purse, as you like to call it.

>insult ralph
 You don't feel like you would gain much from insulting Ralph.

>open satchel
 "Hey, you little twerp! Get away from Gus's bag!" Ralph shouts.

>examine jukebox
 The jukebox looks like a retro vinyl player but under the hood it
 plays MP3s like everything else. The machine controls all the music
 playing in the club, so when somebody chooses a new song, the whole
 club has to listen to that.

 The buttons are labeled "rap", "r&b", "jazz", "rock", "techno", and
 something that has most of the letters scraped off, leaving only
 "ass". The button labeled "rap" is currently selected.

 The jukebox is operated by inserting coins into the slot.

>set jukebox to ass
 No, you can't set that to anything.

>press ass
 The button refuses to budge. The machine must require a coin to be
 inserted first.

>look under jukebox
 (searching the jukebox)
 On the back side of the jukebox you find a knob.

>examine knob
 The knob is apparently for adjusting the volume of the music being
 played. It can be set to low, medium or high. At the moment it's set
 on medium.

>turn knob to high
 You turn the music up.

 Some rap is playing at ear-pearcing volume.

 rejected coins.

 You have a handful of coins, straight from the depths of a sofa.

 The coin tumbles inside the machine.

 You push the "ass" button and a smoothing classical symphony starts
 playing. The "rap" button pops back up.

 "What the... Who changed the music?" Ralph shouts and gets up the
 chair. "Get away from the jukebox, you twerp!"

 Artist hangout (NE corner)
 The people who are performing in the club usually hang around here by
 the stage.

 Gus stands here chatting with his posse.

 A massive loudspeaker is booming tunes next to the stage.

 "Man, it's really hot in here, dontcha think?" Gus says. His posse
 nods in unison, competing who can agree most with him. Assflies. He
 takes his sweater off and hangs it on the back of a nearby chair.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine posse
 When you're famous, you get all kinds of mindless drones following you
 around doing nothing but sucking up to you. It's so lame and childish.
 And so unfair that you don't have a posse. Yet.

>examine sweater
 It's Gus's hooded blue sweater with white decorations. A tag is sewn
 to it.

 For some reason a thought that the tag is somehow important crosses
 your mind.

>examine tag
 It's too dark to make out what it says on the tag. It looks important,
 or at least as important as a clothes tag ever can.

 You need to scrape it off the table, and you need gloves or a tool to

 Norbert puts his hand above his eyes as to shield his eyes from the
 sun, which is somewhat unnecessary during the night in a dim club
 without windows.

 the stage.

 Gus stands here chatting with his posse.

 A massive loudspeaker is booming tunes next to the stage.

>look under loudspeaker
 (searching the speaker)
 Under the speaker near the wall you spot a bulging glass object. It
 can't be anything else than the lens from Norbert's glasses!

>take lens
 You can't quite reach far enough under the speaker to get the lens.

>push speaker
 It is fixed in place.

 Ralph, one of Gus's goons, is sitting here with a satchel.

 An old jukebox sits under the pictures.

>examine jukebox
 The jukebox looks like a retro vinyl player but under the hood it
 plays MP3s like everything else. The machine controls all the music
 playing in the club, so when somebody chooses a new song, the whole
 club has to listen to that.

 The buttons are labeled "rap", "r&b", "jazz", "rock", "techno", and
 something that has most of the letters scraped off, leaving only
 "ass". The button labeled "rap" is currently selected.

 The jukebox is operated by inserting coins into the slot.

>put coin in jukebox
 The coin tumbles inside the machine.

>press techno
 You push the "techno" button and a steady stream of low
 thump-thump-thump beats fill the air. The "rap" button pops back up.

>take lens
 You reach under the speaker and grab the lens.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>floor
 Dance floor (center of the club)
 This is the center of the Compass Club. Most people don't orient
 themselves in relation to compass directions, but here it's more than
 natural. A huge compass rose is painted to the ceiling and the
 abbreviations of cardinal directions are painted on the walls.

 To north there's the stage where you can challenge Gus by just
 climbing on to it. The club continues in every other direction.

 Norbert is standing here near the dance floor.

 Norbert searches the table carefully but finds nothing.

>look through lens
 The world looks distorted through the lens. And huge.

>look at tag through lens
 Through the lens the text on the tag would be large enough to read,
 but it's too dark here to make out the letters.

 Norbert searches the table carefully but finds nothing.

>take gum with lens
 You can't scrape the gum with the lens.

>give lens to norbert
 That's a nice thing to do, but the lens could be useful yet.

 Norbert tries to look under the table. "Ow, my back," he complains.

 The area is reserved to those with VIP passes. There are cushy red
 sofas to sit on and you don't have to worry about drunken idiots

 The Sleaze is leaning on the counter, eyeing you and giving an
 occasional wink.

 The barkeep is busy serving drinks to thirsty clubbers.

>tase sleaze
 (with the taser)
 You take the taser and thrust it in the Sleaze's ribs. "YeeOW! That's
 way too kinky for my tastes!"

>point at coke
 You point at the cola in the menu. "Bartender! One cola!" the Sleaze
 declares and takes a stack of bills from his pocket. He counts the sum
 with grand gestures and pays for the drink. The bartender places the
 cola on the counter.

>drink coke
 You can't drink it.

 "I bet your parents were angels, because I would like to..." the
 Sleaze says and ends the sentence with a short but vomit-inducing
 gesture show.

>inventory
 You're carrying a lens, a taser, and a handful of coins, and wearing a
 sweater, your street clothes, and a track jacket.

 The Sleaze licks a toothpick from his martini slowly from end to end,
 all the while looking you straight in the eyes.

 There's no reason to attack the cola.

 Doc Stockholm portrait, the Hetty R portrait, the Slick Joe Mittens
 portrait, or the missing portrait?

>gus
 The Gus portrait is out of reach.

>get missy
 The Missy Maestro portrait is out of reach.

>examine missing
 The first portrait is missing. It used to be the picture of Joe Mahma.
 The empty frame is a memorial of his defamation.

>examine hetty r
 In the picture there's a thin older woman with a scarf around her
 head. "Hetty had time for the art even with three kids to feed. Just
 like Yo Momma who has three chins to feed."

>examine missy maestro
 The portrait is of a serious-looking girl with a collar shirt and
 blonde hair combed back. Below it reads: "Missy Maestro could command
 words like an orchestra, but nobody could command Yo Momma away from
 that third bucket of chicken."

>examine doc stockholm
 The guy in the portrait wears a white jacket and rubber gloves. It
 reads: "Doc could tie your intestines to a knot with a single quip.
 Too bad for Yo Momma that he isn't a cosmetic surgeon."

>examine slick joe
 The picture depicts a young bald guy with tattoos and hip hop clothes.
 The text says: "Slick Joe had his rhymes and his wits of which he let
 everyone have their share. Yo Momma has her tub-o-lard and that she
 never shares."

>examine gus
 Gus, that smug twit. The inscription reads: "They say to beat Gus in
 his game is an impossible task, but not as hard as raising a flag on
 Mount Yo Momma."

>get frame
 The missing portrait is out of reach.

 You climb on the stage. The music pauses and an announcement booms
 from the speakers: "We haaave a challenger!"

 [press space to continue]

 A crowd starts gathering on the dance floor. The anticipation of a
 battle is thick in the air.

 "Our challenger tonight is Jen, a local girl who is taking on the
 current champion, Gus!"

 Gus trots on the stage, clapping his hands, working the crowd. The
 masses cheer and yell his name.

 "It takes three wins to beat the prevailing champion. With no
 victories so far she still has a long road ahead of her!"

 Gus stomps on his side of the stage and turns to face you. The crowd
 goes silent.

 "Yo momma's so stupid she needs a dictionary to read the alphabet!"

 Here the quip comes, all ready to whip Gus's ass. "Yo momma's so fat
 she fell into the whale pool and the staff rescued the whale by
 mistake."

 You can practically hear Gus's jaw fall on the floor. "Yo... Yo... Yo
 momma's so ugly because her face is so ugly..."

 The crowd is cheering, and they're cheering for you.

 "The challenger wins! She is now one third on her way to becoming the
 champion! Give a big hand for Jen everybody!"

 "Beginner's luck," Gus mutters when you step down the stage.

>examine spotlights
 The spotlights cover the tables in sharp light and at the same time

 It's too dark to make out what it says on the tag. It looks important,
 or at least as important as a clothes tag ever can.

 You put the sweater on the corner table. The spotlight lights it

 With sufficient light and magnification you can easily make out what
 it says on the tag. Washing instructions... wash separately... may

 masses cheer and yell his name.

 "She has succeeded in one battle, but was it just a stroke of luck?
 We'll soon find out -- our challenger needs two more victories to win
 the championship!"

 Gus stomps on his side of the stage and turns to face you. The crowd
 goes silent.

 "Yo momma's so old she had a pet dodo!"

 Without blinking you look him straight in the eye and say: "Yo momma's
 so poor she shops for yo rags at the Cheap-O-Mart."

 The crowd gasps. Gus's face turns white. "I... Your... Yo momma's so
 fat everyone says she's really fat!" he stammers. The crowd hesitates,
 as if not knowing what happened. Then they start booing.

 "The challenger wins again! Uuun-be-lievable! That's two wins for her
 and she is only one victory away from becoming the new champion!"

 Gus is looking considerably nervous. He avoids eye contact when you
 walk past him and into the cheering crowd.

 "Who's been sayin' that? Talk ya little punk!"

 ?
>sleaze
 "The greasehair over there? He's goin' to be picking his teeth from
 the floor in about five seconds," Vincent barks and storms into the
 bar. You witness a gruesome act that includes screaming, punching, and
 unhealthy amount of excruciating pain. You almost feel sorry for the
 Sleaze. Almost.

 Vincent storms back, shaking his head. "What a weasel," he mutters and
 returns to his game.

>bar
 Bar (western side)
 A club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a bar. The selection is
 written on a chalkboard behind the counter next to an educational
 poster.

 The Sleaze is lying face down on the floor.

 The barkeep is busy serving drinks to thirsty clubbers.

 The Sleaze picks himself up from the floor and sways back to the
 counter. "Sheez, I wonder what that guy's problem was," he mutters.

>examine sleaze
 The Sleaze is an obnoxious mix of overconfidence and desperation in
 its mid-30s. He wears a cheap white suit with large collars and
 matching shoes. His shirt is unbuttoned halfway down showcasing an
 uneven patch of chest hair. A thick layer of grease keeps his hair
 combed back.
 He looks quite ruffled after the Vincent incident.

>talk to sleaze
 "Hey sweet-lips, can I buy you a drink? Just point at what you want
 from the menu and" -- he pauses to make a tongue-clicking and akimbo
 finger guns -- "it's yours."

>point at beer
 You point at the beer in the menu. "Bartender! One beer!" the Sleaze
 declares and takes a stack of bills from his pocket. He counts the sum
 with grand gestures and pays for the drink. The bartender places the
 beer on the counter.

>take beer
 Taken.

>give beer to sleaze
 At the last moment you decide not to do that.

>hug sleaze
 You. Would. Rather. Die.

>arcade
 Arcade corner (SW corner)
 In this corner of the club there's a collection of arcade machines.
 This is where all the tough kids like to hang out.

 Speaking of tough kids, Vincent is hacking away on one of the
 machines.

 There's a tall plant standing in the corner.

>insult vincent
 "Hey Vincent," you say. "Word on the street is that yo momma's so fat
 she weighs a lot."

 Vincent stops in his tracks. You can hear gears turning in his head.
 He turns around, grabs you by the collar and lifts you in the air.
 "Who's been sayin' that? Talk ya little punk!"

 ?
>sleaze
 "That smug bastard again? He's goin' to be picking his teeth from the
 floor in about five seconds," Vincent barks and storms into the bar.
 You witness a gruesome act that includes screaming, punching, and
 unhealthy amount of excruciating pain. You almost feel sorry for the
 Sleaze. Almost.

 Vincent storms back, shaking his head. "What a weasel," he mutters and
 returns to his game.

>bar
 Bar (western side)
 A club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a bar. The selection is
 written on a chalkboard behind the counter next to an educational
 poster.

 There's a business card lying on the floor.

 The Sleaze is lying face down on the floor.

 The barkeep is busy serving drinks to thirsty clubbers.

 The Sleaze picks himself up from the floor and sways back to the
 counter. "I guess some people just can't handle my good looks," he
 mutters.

 You're not sure that you can find it in you to challenge him again.

 Dance floor (center of the club)
 This is the center of the Compass Club. Most people don't orient
 themselves in relation to compass directions, but here it's more than
 natural. A huge compass rose is painted to the ceiling and the
 abbreviations of cardinal directions are painted on the walls.

 To north there's the stage where you can challenge Gus by just
 climbing on to it. The club continues in every other direction.

 "Hey! What's wrong with this stupid machine?" Ralph swears and pounds
 on the jukebox buttons.

>examine books
 Let's see, a Jack Mills pocket book... something about gardening...
 man, he reads crappy books too.

 "Stupid piece of junk," Ralph says.

>examine wallet
 Huh, it's Gus's wallet. Might be interesting.

 Ralph has a fit and pounds himself instead of the jukebox.

>open wallet
 You go through the wallet quckily and discover a photograph. Looks
 like... well, it's an ugly old hag... wait, could it be Gus's momma?

 Yes! It must be! She has this horrible wart in the middle of her
 face... Now that just gets your creative juices moving, not to mention
 your dinner. You quickly replace the picture and the wallet.

 Ralph finally gets the bubblegum scraped off the button and gets the
 music changed. He comes back to his seat, steaming from the ears.

 You climb on the stage. The music pauses and an announcement booms
 from the speakers: "We haaave a challenger!"

 [press space to continue]

 A crowd starts gathering on the dance floor. The anticipation of a
 battle is thick in the air.

 "Our challenger tonight is Jen, a local girl who is taking on the
 current champion, Gus!"

 Gus trots on the stage, clapping his hands, working the crowd. The
 masses cheer and yell his name.

 "With two victories under her belt, she is only one, yes, one win away
 from the championship title!"

 Gus stomps on his side of the stage and turns to face you. The crowd
 goes silent.

 "Yo momma's so stupid she got locked inside a grocery store and
 starved!"

 You have the insult and you know how to use it. "Yo momma's so ugly
 her warts went to see the doctor to have her removed."

 The crowd goes wild. They can barely hear Gus stuttering: "..no way...
 Yo momma's so stupid she doesn't know anything! I mean Yo momma's so
 ugly because her face is so ugly!"


 [press space to continue]



 Suddenly lights of all colors start flashing and music turns into
 heroic fanfares. The announcer goes ballistic. "U-U-U-UNBELIEVABLE!
 Ladies and Gentlemen! We have a NEW CHAMPION!"

 The sound of the crowd is incredible. They cheer for their new hero --
 you! You are carried out above the crowds chanting your name. A life
 of celebrity, fame and fortune has just opened before you.

 Just as the celebrating masses carry you out the door you see Joe
 Mahma in the corner table, giving a brief nod of approval before
 retreating back into the shadows. He is smiling and you're almost sure
 you saw a glint of a tear in his eye.
