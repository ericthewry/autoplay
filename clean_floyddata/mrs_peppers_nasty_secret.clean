 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.




 Walking home from school is mostly okay, except for one big problem:
 Every day you have to pass right by Mrs. Pepper's house.  She may not
 actually be a witch, but she sure acts like one.  She's ugly and
 crabby, and she seems to go out of her way to cause trouble for you.
 The time she came at you with the garden rake, swinging it like it was
 a giant claw ... you still shudder when you think of it.

 Last Friday was a new low.  You would never, ever skateboard in her
 driveway -- that would be practically suicidal.  But somehow when you
 got to the driveway your skateboard swerved, all by itself, as if
 somebody had put a spell on it.  And then you fell off.

 While you were picking grit out of the ugly scrape on your skinned
 elbow, Mrs. Pepper appeared out of nowhere and snatched up your
 skateboard!  She screeched something about rowdy children,
 trespassing, and needing to be taught a lesson.  She swung the
 skateboard at you like it was a bat, and then ran off with it,
 cackling.  Afterward you rang her doorbell for what seemed like an
 hour, begging her to give the skateboard back, and she wouldn't even
 come to the door.

 And now it's Monday afternoon, and here you are, on your way home from
 school as usual (but with no skateboard).  Just up ahead is Mrs.
 Pepper's driveway....



 Mrs. Pepper's Nasty Secret

 On the Sidewalk
 This stretch of sidewalk runs more or less east-west between the busy
 street to the south and a tall, water-stained fence to the north.
 Just a few yards further west the fence ends where Mrs. Pepper's
 driveway thrusts into the roadway.  Unfortunately there's no option
 but to cross that driveway if you want to get home.

 Just a few yards further west the fence ends where Mrs. Pepper's
 driveway thrusts into the roadway.  Unfortunately there's no option

>go south
 There's too much traffic for you to consider crossing the street.

>go west
 You step gingerly off the sidewalk into the mouth of Mrs. Pepper's
 driveway.  There's no way of avoiding it, but that doesn't make it any
 less hazardous.  More than once the nasty old woman has backed her car
 out quite rapidly just as you were crossing, as if bent on running you
 over, so this step across Mrs. Pepper's driveway is the part of your
 daily walk home that you've most come to dread....

 But today you're in luck.  Her car isn't moving, and she's not in it.

 At the End of the Driveway
 You're at the outer end of Mrs. Pepper's driveway, which extends to
 the north alongside her house.  Her old gray car is parked beside the
 house, and before the house is a square of sadly neglected lawn.  The
 sidewalk runs east and west from here, and the street is to the south.

>examine car
 The car is an Oldsmobile, a boxy model that's at least 20 years old.
 It's slate-gray, and the rear fender droops at one side, as if perhaps
 Mrs. Pepper has succeeded in hitting something -- or someone -- with
 it.

>examine lawn
 The lawn is patchy and mostly dead, mottled with patches of bare dirt.

>enter car
 The car is too far away.

>examine driveway
 (the driveway)
 The driveway runs northward along the right side of Mrs. Pepper's
 house.  Standing in the drive next to the house is Mrs. Pepper's old
 gray car.

>go west
 On the Sidewalk by the Front Yard
 To the north, across a sadly dried-up and decrepit yard, stands Mrs.
 Pepper's house.  You can also go east or west along the sidewalk.  The
 busy street is to the south.  A telephone pole plastered with the
 scraps of old posters stands here.

>examine posters
 Many are faded, many are torn, and many are both.  The ones that
 remain legible advertise everything from last year's flower show to
 the merits of the Independent Candidate in some long-forgotten
 election.  Amongst this mass of posters well past their read-by date
 is an advertising flyer that looks crisp and new.

>examine advertising flyer
 The flyer is crisp, new, and colorful.  In big bright letters it
 advertises a special sale at Flogg & Grabby's Stufftown, a shopping
 mall that lies just half a mile down the road.  If the flyer is to be
 believed, the sale ends this very afternoon.  "INCREDIBLY LOW PRICES
 ON GORGEOUS LADIES' WIGS!!!" it promises.

 Mrs. Pepper is not your idea of a gorgeous lady (if anything, just the
 opposite).  But she certainly is fond of wigs.  Every time you see
 her, it seems, her wig is a different color and style, each more
 outlandish and ill-fitting than the last.  What they all have in
 common is that they look as if she bought them in a thrift shop.

>info
 The word "info" is not necessary in this story.

>examine house
 Mrs. Pepper's house is two stories tall, and narrow.  It hasn't been
 painted in a long time.  A small covered porch is attached to the
 front, and the driveway runs along the right side.  A short flight of
 steps leads up from the yard to the porch.

>go east
 At the End of the Driveway
 You're at the outer end of Mrs. Pepper's driveway, which extends to
 the north alongside her house.  Her old gray car is parked beside the
 house, and before the house is a square of sadly neglected lawn.  The
 sidewalk runs east and west from here, and the street is to the south.

>go north
 You take a cautious step onto Mrs. Pepper's property.  When nothing
 terrible happens, you take another, your curiosity overcoming your
 apprehension of the batty old woman.

 Driveway
 The driveway continues northward along the side of the house, where an
 old gray car is parked, and leads south out to sidewalk and beyond it
 the street.  On the east the driveway is bordered by a high fence, and
 Mrs. Pepper's front yard lies to the west.

>open car
 The car is too far away.

>go north
 Driveway by House
 Mrs. Pepper's house lies directly to the west; the drive continues to
 the south, and a gravel path leads around the house to the northwest.
 Standing directly to the north is a detached garage.

 A trash can is standing in the driveway.

 A battered old car is parked in the drive, just under an open window.

>examine can
 The old, dented trash can is made of gray metal, and has a sturdy lid.

>open can
 You remove the lid from the trash can.

>summon oscar the grouch
 The word "oscar" is not necessary in this story.

>enter car
 You rattle the car's door handle, but the door is securely locked.

>look under car
 There's nothing interesting under the car, not even those odd patches
 of liquid your parents worry might mean there's something wrong with
 theirs.

>smash window
 Painful experience has taught you that breaking things quite often
 gets you into trouble.

>look through window
 You can't see much through the window from here.

>examine window
 The window is standing open, and doesn't appear to have a screen.
 It's six or seven feet up the wall from the paved surface of the
 driveway.

>stand on car
 Okay, you're now standing on the car.

>climb window
>jump
 That is not something you can climb.

 You jump off the car and land back on the ground.

 paint has sealed it up.

>turn can upside down
 The word "upside" is not necessary in this story.

>open door
 It seems to have been shut for so long that the most recent layer of
 paint has sealed it up.

>go west
 You can't reach the window from where you're standing.

>go down
 There are no visible entrances to caves in the vicinity.

>go south
 Driveway
 The driveway continues northward along the side of the house, where an
 old gray car is parked, and leads south out to sidewalk and beyond it
 the street.  On the east the driveway is bordered by a high fence, and
 Mrs. Pepper's front yard lies to the west.

>go west
 Front Yard
 The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except
 for a few hardy weeds.  A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the
 sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The
 driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards
 what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the
 walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree.

 As you're crossing the front yard, a momentary lull in the traffic
 noise allows you to hear something very odd.  Weakly, somewhere in the
 near distance, a voice is crying, "Help me!  Oh, please, help me!" The
 voice is high-pitched and very hoarse, as if whoever is calling for
 help can barely speak at all.

 You stop dead in your tracks, looking around to see where the voice
 might be coming from.  It seems to be coming from the upstairs window
 in Mrs. Pepper's house.  You stare hard at the window, and for a
 moment it seems something might be moving there -- but you can't make
 out what it might be.  After a moment the movement stops, and the
 voice falls silent.

 Could it have been your imagination?  No, you're certain you heard
 something.  And it was coming from inside the house.

>go north
 Front Porch
 The front door lies immediately to the north; the front yard is to the
 south.  There's a doorbell button just by the front door.

>push button
>push doorbell
 Do you really want Mrs. Pepper to come to the door and see that you've
 been playing with her trash can?  That might not be so smart.

 (You can use the TYPO command to disable the typo-correction feature.)

 Precious time slips by, never to be recovered.

 The door flies open, and Mrs. Pepper glares down at you.  "You again!"
 she says with a sneer.  "Why don't you go play in the street,
 good-for-nothing brat?" Mrs. Pepper is wearing one of her outlandish
 wigs, as usual.  This one is fire-engine red, and the hair is crimped
 from scalp to tip in tiny waves, like a very bad imitation of a
 waterfall.  Also, it's on a bit crooked.

 You try to ask her if maybe you can have your skateboard back, but
 before you can get more than two words out, she laughs nastily and
 slams the door in your face.

>take doorbell
 You can't take that.

>SAVE
>cf1

>ring bell
 You thumb the doorbell.  Within the house a rather discordant chime
 sounds.

>wait
 Precious time slips by, never to be recovered.

 After a somewhat longer delay than the first time, the door flies
 open.  Mrs. Pepper snarls at you.  "Why are you bothering me?  Do you
 want me to call the police?" The door slams again, leaving you on the
 outside and Mrs. Pepper on the inside.

>put flyer on door
 The front door doeesn't look much good for putting things on.

>go south
 Front Yard
 The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except

 A battered old car is parked in the drive, just under an open window.

 You see a trash can here.

>go northwest
 Back Yard
 The back yard is in a dreadful state.  Except for a few sorry weeds,
 nothing grows here.  Someone has dug holes of various sizes, leaving
 mounds of dirt and gravel everywhere.  A concrete birdbath stands in
 the center of the yard.  The back porch of the house lies directly to
 the south.

 The driveway is off to the southeast, past the corner of the garage.
 The garage itself stands directly to the east.

 A neighbor is working in the garden next door.

>examine birdbath
 The gray concrete birdbath is thick and ugly, and looks as if it
 hasn't held water for a long time.  The bottom of the basin is coated
 with a thin layer of grime.

>examine neighbor
 She's tall and thin, and is wearing a big floppy hat of straw.  She
 has rather a kindly look.

>examine holes
 Holes of various sizes have been dug across the lawn, seemingly at
 random, as if some demented fortune-seeker were desperately seeking
 buried treasure.  The more prosaic explanation, given the state of the
 back yard, is that the holes are due to energetic but incompetent
 gardening efforts.

>remove grime
 You really don't need to mess with the grime.

>examine porch
 The back porch is a plain wooden structure, with no railing or
 decoration.  It looks as if it was tacked onto the house as an
 afterthought.  It's several feet above the ground, with a ramp leading
 up to one side.  The crawl space beneath it is deep in shadow.

>search crawl space
 There's nothing in the crawl space.

>enter crawl space
 It's a very small crawl space -- there isn't even enough room for you
 to crawl into it.

>talk to neighbour
 "Hi," you say.  "Who are you?"

 "I'm Mrs. Dogwood, Mrs. Pepper's neighbor," she replies.

 (You could ask her about Mr. Pepper, gardening, Mrs. Pepper's old car,
 herself, or Mrs. Pepper.  You could also ask or tell her about various
 other things that might occur to you.)

>ask about pepper
 "Do you know Mrs. Pepper well?" you ask.

 "As well as I want to!" Mrs. Dogwood replies.  Lowering her voice, she
 adds in a near whisper, "I don't normally go in for tittle-tattle, but
 she really is the meanest....  Well, I dropped a fine gold brooch one
 day when I was working near the fence.  At least, I don't know where
 else I could have dropped it.  A few minutes later I'm sure I saw her
 arm snaking right through the fence, down near the ground.  By the
 time I put down my shears and came to take a closer look, she was
 trotting into the house. I never did find that brooch.  I'm sure she
 took it, but when I asked, quite politely, if she might have seen it
 or know where it could be, she got all huffy and claimed not to know
 what I was talking about.  Swears she never saw it, she does!"

>ask about gardening
 "I was just admiring your wonderful garden," you tell Mrs. Dogwood
 politely.

 "Why, thank you, dear!" she replies.

 "It's much nicer than Mrs. Pepper's," you add.

 "I don't like to speak ill of anyone," Mrs. Dogwood says piously, "but
 I think it's fair to say Mrs. Pepper doesn't have a green thumb."

 A fat toad that you hadn't noticed before hops away under the back
 porch.

 feet out of reach.

 Mrs. Dogwood returns to her gardening.

>inventory
>ask about car
 You are carrying an advertising flyer.

 "Hello again," you say.

 "Hi there, youngster," she replies.

 "I saw Mrs. Pepper's old car in her driveway," you remark.  "Is it
 always there?"

 "If she's home, it is," Mrs. Dogwood replies promptly.  "Sometimes in
 the afternoon she goes out driving, if there's a special sale on at
 the mall.  You know, Flogg & Grabby's, down the road?"

>ask about mr pepper
 "What happened to Mrs. Pepper's husband," you ask.

 "Such a tragic accident," the neighbor replies.  "If it was an
 accident.  I've always wondered about that.  But really, I mustn't
 gossip."

>ask about herself
 "You seem to be quite a fine gardener," you venture.  "Have you lived
 in that house for a long time?"

 "Oh, long enough," she replies vaguely.  "I daresay I'm not a very
 interesting person."

>ask about skateboarding toad
 "Some other time, perhaps," she suggests, with a lopsided smile.

>ask about dr pepper
>ask about toad
 She bends over a little bush to inspect it, and then straightens up
 when you start to speak.  "I'm sorry, dear, I didn't quite catch that.
 I thought I saw an aphid.  Horrid things, aphids."

 "Do you know anything about frogs and toads?" you ask Mrs. Dogwood.

 "My goodness, what a question!  Not so very much, no.  I've noticed a
 fat old toad hopping about from time to time.  I believe he lives
 under Mrs. Pepper's back porch.  If you find him, I do hope you won't
 catch him in a jar or anything.  That would be very cruel."

 what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the
 walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree.

>examine tree
 A few green leaves cling to the crooked branches of the tree, but
 really it looks more dead than alive.  Mrs. Pepper calls it her orange
 tree -- in fact, one of your more memorable run-ins with her occurred
 when she accused you of stealing oranges from the tree.  But in truth
 you've never seen an orange growing on the tree.  The idea that it's
 an orange tree is purely a theory, as far as you're concerned.

>take branch
 As sickly as the orange tree looks, its branches are still firmly
 attached to it.

>take orange
 It doesn't look too healthy, but it's probably best left where it is.

>break branch
 Painful experience has taught you that breaking things quite often

 After a brief pause, the front door opens.  Mrs. Pepper ventures out
 on the porch, looks around to make sure no one is close enough to
 sneak past her into the house, and then bends to retrieve the flyer.
 For long seconds, she peers at it closely, holding it in both hands.
 Maybe it's only your imagination, but it looks as if her hands are
 actually trembling with desire.  Then she turns on her heel and dives
 back into the house.

 A moment later she bursts out again, a large purse over her arm.
 After carefully locking the door, she strides off in the direction of
 the driveway.  You hear her car coughing to life, and in a squeal of
 tires it backs down the driveway, careens into the street, reverses
 direction, and roars away in a cloud of blue exhaust vapors.

 the south, and a gravel path leads around the house to the northwest.
 Standing directly to the north is a detached garage.

 You see a trash can here.

>go west
 You can't reach the window from where you're standing.

>get can
 You pick up the trash can.

>put can against window
 You see no can against window here.

>throw can
 What do you want to throw it at?

>at window
 The trash can hits the window without any obvious effect, and falls to
 the ground.

>smash window
 Painful experience has taught you that breaking things quite often
 gets you into trouble.

>examine window
 The window is standing open, and doesn't appear to have a screen.
 It's six or seven feet up the wall from the paved surface of the
 driveway.

>go window
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>drop can
 You're not carrying that.

>get can
 You pick up the trash can.

>drop can
 You set down the trash can.

 (Your score has just increased by two points.)

>stand on window
 You can't stand on that.

>stand on can
 Okay, you're now standing on the trash can.

>enter window
 You manage to clamber through the window -- but as you do so, you
 accidentally knock the lid off the can.

 Kitchen
 You glance nervously around as your feet land on the floor, but so far
 as you can tell the house really is empty now -- at least, you can't
 hear anybody about.

 Compared to your parents' kitchen, Mrs. Pepper's seems, well, a bit
 mean and cramped, just like its owner.  Most of the space is taken up
 by the old wooden table standing right in the middle.  Beneath the lip
 of the table is a wide, shallow drawer.  Completing the furnishings
 are a cupboard, a sink, a stove, and a refrigerator.  The back door
 leads out to the north, while to the south is an open doorway, its
 door long since removed.  The window through which you've just climbed
 is set in the east wall, and on the opposite side of the room a flight
 of steps leads down into darkness.

 (Your score has just increased by three points.)

>examine drawer
 It's just a plain wooden drawer.  It's closed.

>open drawer
 Opening the drawer reveals a small flashlight.

>get it
 You can't have that; it's part of the kitchen table.

>get torch
 You pick up the small flashlight.

>examine table
 It's a big square wooden table, old and scratched.  Beneath one edge
 is a single drawer.

>look under table
 The only thing under the table is its drawer.

>open cupboard
 Opening the cabinet reveals a glass and a butter knife.

>examine glass
 It's chipped on one edge.  It's currently empty.

>get all
 fridge: You can't take that.
 kitchen table: The kitchen table is too heavy.
 glass: You pick up the glass.
 butter knife: You pick up the butter knife.

>fill glass
 (from the faucet)
 (first turning on the faucet, then putting the glass under it)
 You hold the glass under the faucet until it fills up with water.

>open fridge
 Opening the fridge reveals a stale loaf of bread and a large wedge of
 blue cheese.

 There's an overpowering smell of over-ripe cheese.

>examine cheese
 The cheese is runny in some spots and dried and crusty in other spots,
 all at the same time.  Its odor is remarkable: If it gets much riper,
 it'll probably come when you call it.  Phewww!  It smells horrible.

>get cheese and bread
 large wedge of blue cheese: You'd rather leave it where it is.
 stale loaf of bread: You'd rather not touch it.

>examine bread
 It looks like one of your more successful school biology experiments
 -- the one where you're meant to grow a culture of mold.

>smell cheese
 Phewww!  It smells horrible.

>examine stove
 The stove is not as nice as the one your family has, and not as clean
 either.  Bits of this and that have dribbled down the front and dried
 there.  It's closed.

>open stove, examine it
 Opened.

 The stove is not as nice as the one your family has, and not as clean
 either.  Bits of this and that have dribbled down the front and dried
 there.  It's open.

>examine sink
 The large porcelain sink is built against the east wall, near the
 window.  A faucet is mounted above the sink.

>turn on flashlight
 You thumb the switch, but the flashlight fails to turn on.

>open flashlight
 Opened.

>examine flashlight
 The flashlight is slim, and about four inches long.  There's a switch
 on one side, and an opening in the end through which a battery can be
 inserted.  It's open.

>go south
 Hall
 This hall is little more than a narrow passage connecting the rooms to
 north and south.  On the east side a flight of stairs leads up to the
 floor above, and there's an opening to the west, with a black button
 next to it at waist height.

>press button
 You push the black button, but nothing happens.

>examine button
 It's an ordinary black button, set in a little brass plate.

>examine plate
 It's an ordinary black button, set in a little brass plate.

>take button
 You can't take that.

>go up
 Landing
 The landing runs north-south past a steel door to the west.  A
 staircase leads down to the floor below, and there's a black button
 low on the west wall.  Immediately to the south the bedroom door is
 closed.

>knock on bedroom door
 You think you hear a faint answering croak on the other side of the
 door, but you can't be quite sure.

>go north
 Back Bedroom
 This small, square room is furnished in a plain, unattractive style.
 Opposite the bed stands a dressing table, on which is a row of
 styrofoam heads.  Arranged on the heads are some rather ugly wigs.
 The way out is to the south, and there's a bathroom to the east.

>examine wigs
 green wig: The green wig is a mass of greasy green ringlets.  Attached
 to the elastic band at the back is a little hand-lettered cardboard
 tag, which reads: TGPXH XKHHW.

 auburn wig: The auburn wig is short and balloon-shaped.  Attached to
 the elastic band at the back is a little hand-lettered cardboard tag,
 which reads: ZGBH YAHHKHU EHAQTKHX XYHFEH.

 blond wig: The hair of the blond wig sticks straight out, as if it's
 made of clumps of straw.  Attached to the elastic band at the back is
 a little hand-lettered cardboard tag, which reads: XPZZDS FGQS.

 black wig: The black wig is very long, and the curls are tangled.
 Attached to the elastic band at the back is a little hand-lettered
 cardboard tag, which reads: ZGOQTGK KDTBQSO.

>take wigs
 green wig: You pick up the green wig.
 auburn wig: You pick up the auburn wig.
 blond wig: You pick up the blond wig.
 black wig: You pick up the black wig.

>examine table
 The dressing table is unusually large.  A mirror is mounted above it,
 and a single drawer is tucked away beneath.  A row of white styrofoam
 heads stands on the table.

>open drawer
 Opening the dressing table reveals a brush and a musical score.

>examine score
 It appears to be the score for an opera called Die Zauberokarina by
 A.W.  Trazom.

>examine brush
 Judging from the multi-colored strands caught in its bristles, Mrs.
 Pepper uses this cheap black plastic brush on her wigs.  There's some
 kind of emblem on the back of the brush.

>examine emblem
 It's fairly schematic, but it looks like a scarlet fish.  Underneath
 it is some tiny lettering.

>examine emblem
 It's fairly schematic, but it looks like a scarlet fish.  Underneath

>read lettering
 You can't make it out.  It appears to be in Arabic or some other
 alphabet you have no idea how to read.

>examine bed
 The king-size bed is covered with a brown comforter.

>examine comforter
 It's a brown quilted coverlet.

>get it
 You don't want to encumber yourself with the thing.

>look under bed
 You peer under the bed and see nothing but the floor.

>inventory
 You are carrying a small flashlight, a glass (full of water), a butter
 knife, and four wigs (one green, one auburn, one blond, and one
 black).

>go east
 Bathroom
 The way out is to the west.  The normal bathroom stuff is here,
 including a bath, a washbasin and a toilet.

>examine bath
 It's a plain white enamel bath, matching the sink; at least, it was
 white once, it's now mostly off-white with a number of distinctly
 brown stains.

>examine basin
 It's just a plain white enamel basin, matching the bath.  A faucet is
 mounted above it.

>examine toilet
 It's a standard enough model.

>get toilet roll
 You see no toilet roll here.

>look behind toilet
 You don't need to use it right now, and you're not so sure of Mrs.
 Pepper's standards of hygiene that you want to mess with this part of
 her plumbing.

>flush toilet
 The word "flush" is not necessary in this story.

>get toilet paper
 You see no toilet paper here.

>examine faucet
>get toilet brush
 You see nothing unusual about it.

 You see no toilet brush here.

>go west
 Back Bedroom
 This small, square room is furnished in a plain, unattractive style.
 Opposite the bed stands a dressing table, on which is a row of
 styrofoam heads.  The way out is to the south, and there's a bathroom
 to the east.

 The dressing table contains a brush and a musical score.

>examine heads
 The four white styrofoam heads stand stiffly on the dressing table.
 They look rather ominously ghostly, as they have no faces.

>push heads
 You consider rearranging the styrofoam heads, but the dressing table
 doesn't really have room for any pattern apart from the row they're
 already in.

>get brush
 You pick up the brush.

>get score
 You pick up the musical score.  Moving the musical score reveals an
 ocarina underneath.

>get ocarina
 You pick up the ocarina.

>examine it
>get ocarina
 The plastic ocarina is about the shape and color of a potato.  There
 are a few holes across the top, and a sort of mouthpiece at one side
 for blowing into.

 You are already carrying the ocarina.

>play score
 The score is far too complex for you to cope with --
 hemisemidemiquavers by the bushel!

>play ocarina
 You tootle a few sour notes on the ocarina.

>brush hair
 You give your hair a good brush.  Maybe it ends up just a little
 tidier.

>go south
 Landing
 The landing runs north-south past a steel door to the west.  A
 staircase leads down to the floor below, and there's a black button
 low on the west wall.  Immediately to the south the bedroom door is
 closed.

>examine steel door
 The door has no visible knob or handle.  It's recessed slightly in the
 wall.

>SAVE
>cf3
 Saved.

>open door
 (the bedroom door)
 The bedroom door won't budge; it resists your attempts to open it with
 almost supernatural determination.

>barge door
 The word "barge" is not necessary in this story.

>open brush
 That is not something you can open.

>open ocarina
 That is not something you can open.

>examine score
 It appears to be the score for an opera called Die Zauberokarina by
 A.W.  Trazom.

>and two button-doors
 The word "button-doors" is not necessary in this story.

>play okerina
 (play ocarina)

 You tootle a few sour notes on the ocarina.  You fancy you detect a
 momentary shimmering across the surface of the bedroom door, but
 possibly your eyes are playing tricks on you.

>knock on door
 (the bedroom door)
 You think you hear a faint answering croak on the other side of the
 door, but you can't be quite sure.

>go north
 Back Bedroom
 This small, square room is furnished in a plain, unattractive style.
 Opposite the bed stands a dressing table, on which is a row of
 styrofoam heads.  The way out is to the south, and there's a bathroom
 to the east.

>examine brush in mirror
 You see no brush in the mirror.

>look in mirror
 You look almost exactly the same as the last time you looked in a
 mirror.

>enter mirror
 That is not something you can enter.

>hold brush
 You are already carrying the brush.

>reflect brush
 The word "reflect" is not necessary in this story.

>examine knife
 It's a small knife, made of stainless steel.  It looks as if it should
 cut through butter readily enough, but it probably wouldn't make much
 of an impression on a rump steak.

>put green wig on DavidW
 The word "DavidW" is not necessary in this story.

>go down
 You can't go that way.  Obvious exits lead south, back to the landing;
 and east, to the bathroom.

>go south
 Landing
 The landing runs north-south past a steel door to the west.  A
 staircase leads down to the floor below, and there's a black button
 low on the west wall.  Immediately to the south the bedroom door is
 closed.

>press button
 You push the black button, but nothing happens.

>go down
 Hall
 This hall is little more than a narrow passage connecting the rooms to
 north and south.  On the east side a flight of stairs leads up to the
 floor above, and there's an opening to the west, with a black button
 next to it at waist height.

>go down
 You can't go that way.  Obvious exits lead north, to the kitchen;
 south; west; and up, back to the landing.

>go north
 Kitchen
 The kitchen is small, and equipped with the usual appliances,
 including a cupboard, a sink, a stove, and a refrigerator, though most
 of the space is taken up by the unusually bulky wooden table standing
 in the middle of the room.  The back door leads north, while to the
 south is an open doorway.  A flight of stairs on the west side of the
 room leads down, roughly opposite the window in the east wall.

 The fridge contains a large wedge of blue cheese and a stale loaf of
 bread.

 There's an overpowering smell of over-ripe cheese.

>go down
 You tiptoe down the stairs into the cellar.  It certainly is dark down
 here....

 Cellar (in pitch darkness)
 You can't see anything in here, apart from the dim outline of the
 stairs leading back up.

 Sitting Room
 This boxy little room is furnished in a fussy, old-fashioned style.
 The one modern touch is a wide-screen TV, with a couch facing it.  A
 low coffee table sits in front of the couch, and a fireplace is set in
 another wall.  There's a door to the south, and the open doorway to
 the hall is on the north.

 On the mantel is a framed photo.  On the coffee table are a yellow
 book and a remote control.

>examine control
 The remote is studded with buttons, but two of them are especially
 large and appear well-thumbed.  One is red, the other blue.  Around
 the back is a sort of plastic hatch cover.

>examine fireplace
 The fireplace has an artificial gas log in it, and a mantel above.

>examine log
 The gas log is gray.  Its bark is wrinkled in an unconvincing way.

>get log
 You really don't need to mess with the gas log.

>look under couch
 You get down on your hands and knees to peer under the couch but see
 nothing apart from the floor and a whole lot of dust and fluff.

>examine buttons
 The main buttons of interest are the red button marked ON and the blue
 button marked CHAN.

>examine table
 The coffee table is made of dark wood.  On the coffee table are a
 yellow book and a remote control.

>examine book
 The book is a thick paperback with a yellow cover.  It's entitled
 Spell-Casting for Dummies.

>take remote
 You pick up the remote control.

>open remote
 Opening the remote control reveals an AA battery.

>read book
 (first taking the yellow book)
 As you open the book, a piece of paper falls out and flutters to the
 floor.

>take battery
 You pick up the AA battery.

>put battery in flashlight
 You put the battery in the flashlight and close it.

>take paper
 You pick up the piece of paper.

>take all
 framed photo: You pick up the framed photo.
 wide-screen TV: The wide-screen TV is too heavy.
 couch: The couch is too heavy.
 coffee table: The coffee table is too heavy.

>examine couch
 The couch, which is easily long enough for you to lie on, is set
 facing the wide-screen TV.  It's covered in a rather depressing shade
 of brown leather, which has become more than a little shiny in some
 places, and scuffed in others.

>turn on torch
 Okay, the small flashlight is now on.

 (Your score has just increased by two points.)

>look under couch
 You get down on your hands and knees to peer under the couch but see
 nothing apart from the floor and a whole lot of dust and fluff.

>look under table
 You can see at a glance that there's nothing under the coffee table,
 unless you count the floor.

>turn on tv
 It looks like you have to use the remote to do that.

>open flashlight
 Opening the small flashlight reveals an AA battery.

>close flashlight
 Closed.

>get paper
 You are already carrying the piece of paper.

>examine paper
 On the piece of paper someone has written, in block capitals with a
 stubby pencil, the phrase "THE MIND POWER OF GLAMOROUS HAIR CLUSTERS."
 Below this is another phrase, which oddly enough is total gibberish:
 "JAH ZQSU WDYHF DI OKGZDFDPX AGQF TKPXJHFX."

>examine green wig
 The green wig is a mass of greasy green ringlets.  Attached to the
 elastic band at the back is a little hand-lettered cardboard tag,
 which reads: TGPXH XKHHW.

>inventory
 You are carrying a small flashlight (providing light), a glass (full
 of water), a butter knife, four wigs (one green, one auburn, one
 blond, and one black), a brush, a musical score, an ocarina, a remote
 control, a yellow book, a piece of paper, and a framed photo.

>examine book
 The book is a thick paperback with a yellow cover.  It's entitled
 Spell-Casting for Dummies.

>read book
 There's an index at the back of the book, where you might be able to
 look up specific topics if any interest you.  Ignoring the index for
 the moment, you flip through the book at random, and encounter a
 recipe for a love potion, the principle ingredients of which seem to
 be onions and vacuum cleaner lint.

>look up toads
 (in the yellow book)
 The yellow book doesn't seem to have much to say on that subject --
 nothing you can find in the index, at any rate.

>read index
 There's an index at the back of the book, where you might be able to
 look up specific topics if any interest you.  Ignoring the index for
 the moment, you flip through the book at random, and encounter a
 numbingly complex description of Polynesian astrology, complete with
 pages of smudgy diagrams.

>look up wig
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index.  There's nothing under "wigs," but purely
 by chance you spot an entry for "garments, magical, uses of." This
 section of the book proves to be devoted almost entirely to full-page,
 exotically lighted photos of pointed black hats with wide brims -- but
 a short paragraph reveals that the working of a spell usually requires
 both the wearing of a magically enhanced garment and the performance
 of some other action, such as shooting off firecrackers or plucking
 the feathers from a recently deceased chicken.

>look up sleep
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and find a listing for "sleep, inducing."
 On the indicated page, the book explains that to put someone to sleep,
 you need to be wearing a magically prepared garment or head-covering
 and chant a brief incantation while wielding the Sign of the Scarlet
 Fish.  Unfortunately, the incantation is written in an alphabet you've
 never seen before, although it may be in the same script as the
 writing on the hairbrush.  It looks rather like Arabic, but with a lot
 more squiggles.

>look up wheeled vehicles
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and after hunting for a bit, find a
 listing for "vehicles, wheeled, causing to swerve." The indicated page
 seems to have been torn out, however.

>look up vehicles
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and after hunting for a bit, find a
 listing for "vehicles, wheeled, causing to swerve." The indicated page
 seems to have been torn out, however.

>look up rain
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and find a listing for "rain, summoning."
 On that page, the book explains that rain can be induced to fall by
 wearing a garment or head-covering imbued with the proper power while
 pouring water on the ground and holding a bamboo stick.  The spell for
 adding this power to an ordinary garment is quite intimidatingly
 complex, sad to say, and requires several ingredients that you not
 only don't have but have never even heard of.

>look up locking
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and find a listing for "locks, magical."
 On that page is printed the following verse:

    Behold I stand at the door and play
    A melody it must obey
    To free the lock that I was glad
    To conjure up when rightly clad.

>examine blond wig
 The hair of the blond wig sticks straight out, as if it's made of
 clumps of straw.  Attached to the elastic band at the back is a little
 hand-lettered cardboard tag, which reads: XPZZDS FGQS.

>inventory
 You are carrying a small flashlight (providing light), a glass (full
 of water), a butter knife, four wigs (one green, one auburn, one
 blond, and one black), a brush, a musical score, an ocarina, a remote
 control, a yellow book, a piece of paper, and a framed photo.

>examine auburn wig
 The auburn wig is short and balloon-shaped.  Attached to the elastic
 band at the back is a little hand-lettered cardboard tag, which reads:
 ZGBH YAHHKHU EHAQTKHX XYHFEH.

>examine green
 The green wig is a mass of greasy green ringlets.  Attached to the
 elastic band at the back is a little hand-lettered cardboard tag,
 which reads: TGPXH XKHHW.

>examine black
 The black wig is very long, and the curls are tangled.  Attached to
 the elastic band at the back is a little hand-lettered cardboard tag,
 which reads: ZGOQTGK KDTBQSO.

>wear black wig
 After a quick glance in all directions to make sure no one is watching
 while you make such a fool of yourself, you don the wig.

>play score
 The score is far too complex for you to cope with --
 hemisemidemiquavers by the bushel!

>play ocarina
 You tootle a few sour notes on the ocarina.  The front door vibrates
 for a moment in a dull, heavy way, as if it's becoming darker and more
 massive.

>look up sleep
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and find a listing for "sleep, inducing."
 On the indicated page, the book explains that to put someone to sleep,
 you need to be wearing a magically prepared garment or head-covering

 The fridge contains a large wedge of blue cheese and a stale loaf of
 bread.

 There's an overpowering smell of over-ripe cheese.

>go down
 Cellar
 The cellar is dim and dismal.  A flight of stairs leads up.  Near the
 foot of the stairs a slim chain dangles from the ceiling.  Off to one
 side squats a heavy piece of machinery, and a plank shelf has been
 built into the opposite wall.

 A battered old wheelchair slumps in one corner.

>pull chain
 You pull the chain, and the cellar is illuminated by a bare lightbulb
 mounted on a rafter at the upper end of the chain.

>turn off flashlight
 Okay, the small flashlight is now off.

>examine chari
 (x chair)

 It may still be functional, but it has clearly seen better days, and
 has hardly been treated with tender loving care.  Part of the fabric
 is torn, and several spots of rust are appearing, not least on the
 brake lever.

 You recall your mother telling you how poor Mr. Pepper was found dead
 at the foot of the cellar stairs following a tragic accident involving
 his wheelchair.  After your various encounters with his widow, you
 find yourself wondering just how accidental his accident actually was.

>examine chair
 It may still be functional, but it has clearly seen better days, and
 has hardly been treated with tender loving care.  Part of the fabric
 is torn, and several spots of rust are appearing, not least on the
 brake lever.

>examine lever
 It's just a short lever with a worn rubber grip at the end.  The
 exposed metal part is beginning to look a bit rusty.  Apparently the
 brake is on.  It looks as if something may be jamming the lever from
 underneath, but you can't quite see what's back there without looking
 behind the lever.

>sit in chair
 Okay, you're now sitting in the wheelchair.

>look behind lever
 Behind the brake lever is a bunch of keys.  It looks like they must
 have fallen there from the owner's pocket.

>get keys
 The keys seem to be stuck behind the lever; you'll need something to
 move them with, something thin enough to fit behind the lever but
 sturdy enough to dislodge the keys.

>dislodge keys with knife
 The word "dislodge" is not necessary in this story.

>get keys with knife
 You poke the knife behind the brake lever, and manage to dislodge the
 bunch of keys, which promptly falls onto the ground.

 (Your score has just increased by two points.)

>take keys
 (first standing up)
 You pick up the bunch of keys.

>examine shelf
 The shelf is built high against one wall. On the shelf is a glass jar
 (which contains a small metallic object).

>examine jar
 The glass jar seems to have been used at one time to hold paint.  The
 interior surface is splattered with flecks of white, and a few
 dribbles have flowed down the outside and dried.  The jar is quite
 dusty on the outside.  It contains a small metallic object.

>get jar
 You can't reach the glass jar because the shelf is too high.

>stand on wheelchair
 Okay, you're now standing on the wheelchair.

>get jar
 (first getting off of the wheelchair)
 You can't reach the glass jar because the shelf is too high.

>push wheelchair to wall
 (the north wall)
 Something is stopping the wheelchair from moving -- probably the
 brake.

>pull lever
 You pull the brake lever to its stop.

>push lever
 You push the brake lever to its stop.

>remove brake
 (from the wheelchair)
 You can't have that; it's part of the wheelchair.

>push wheelchair
 Something is stopping the wheelchair from moving -- probably the
 brake.

>examine machine
>pull lever
 The innards of the machine are concealed by a metal housing.  On one
 side is a large vertically mounted wheel, around both sides of which a
 sturdy cable runs up through the ceiling.  Not far from the cable a
 black-coated wire dangles down from the ceiling.  The lower end of the
 wire swings free not far from a screw that protrudes from the top of
 the machine.  Mounted in the north wall just behind the machine is a
 small metal door.

 You pull the brake lever to its stop.

>push wheelchair
 You'll need to be more specific about where you want to push it.

>push wheelchair to wall
>push wheelchair to shelf
 (the north wall)
 You manage to push the wheelchair over to the north wall.

 You manage to push the wheelchair over to the shelf.

>stand on wheelchair
 The wheelchair starts to roll away as soon as you try to stand on it.

>push lever
 You push the brake lever to its stop.

>stand on wheelchair
 Okay, you're now standing on the wheelchair.

>get jar
 You pick up the glass jar.

 (Your score has just increased by three points.)

>examine jr
 (x jar)

 The glass jar seems to have been used at one time to hold paint.  The
 interior surface is splattered with flecks of white, and a few
 dribbles have flowed down the outside and dried.  The jar is quite
 dusty on the outside.  It contains a small metallic object.

>get object
 That would be difficult, since the jar isn't open.

>open jar
 The lid seems to be stuck.

>open lid with knife

 Cellar (standing on the wheelchair)
 The cellar is dim and dismal.  A flight of stairs leads up.  Near the
 foot of the stairs a slim chain dangles from the ceiling.  Off to one
 side squats a heavy piece of machinery, and a plank shelf has been
 built into the opposite wall.

 The old wheelchair is resting just by the shelf.

 You see a glass jar (broken) (which contains a small metallic object)
 here.

>get jar
 (first getting off of the wheelchair)
 You pick up the glass jar.

>take object
 You pick up the small metallic object.

>examine object
 It's an antique gold brooch, roughly round and about an inch and a
 half in diameter.

>examine machine
 The innards of the machine are concealed by a metal housing.  On one
 side is a large vertically mounted wheel, around both sides of which a
 sturdy cable runs up through the ceiling.  Not far from the cable a
 black-coated wire dangles down from the ceiling.  The lower end of the
 wire swings free not far from a screw that protrudes from the top of
 the machine.  Mounted in the north wall just behind the machine is a
 small metal door.

>examine door
 It's a small, gray, metal door set into the north wall.  A thick cable
 runs up from the door to the ceiling.  It's closed.

>open door
 Opening the metal door reveals a small box containing a large red
 switch.

>pull wire
 Touching the wire gives you a severe shock, so you let go of it at
 once.

>hit switch
 Which switch do you mean, the large red switch, or the small
 flashlight?

>red switch
 (the large red switch)
 You cannot attack that.

>press red
 Which red do you mean, the red button, or the large red switch?

>flip red switch
 Okay, the large red switch is now off.

>pull wire
 You grip the end of the wire between two fingers and give it a little
 tug.  It seems to be securely attached to something up in the ceiling,
 but this end is dangling loose -- not the usual situation, with
 electrical wires.

>climb wire
 That is not something you can climb.

>attach wire to screw
 To do that, you'll need a screwdriver.

>examine screw
 The screw protrudes from the top plate of the machine housing.

>turn wheel
 It proves to be too stiff to turn by hand.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is small, and equipped with the usual appliances,
 including a cupboard, a sink, a stove, and a refrigerator, though most
 of the space is taken up by the unusually bulky wooden table standing
 in the middle of the room.  The back door leads north, while to the
 south is an open doorway.  A flight of stairs on the west side of the
 room leads down, roughly opposite the window in the east wall.

 The fridge contains a large wedge of blue cheese and a stale loaf of
 bread.

 There's an overpowering smell of over-ripe cheese.

>remove wig
 Okay, you're no longer wearing the black wig.

 Back Porch
 The back porch is a plain wooden structure, with no railing or
 decoration.  It looks as if it was tacked onto the house as an
 afterthought.  It's several feet above the ground, with a ramp leading
 up to one side.  The back door leading into the house is just to the
 south.

 Mrs. Dogwood is working in the garden next door.

 Mrs. Dogwood doesn't appear to hear you.  Perhaps if you were closer

 Back Yard
 The back yard is in a dreadful state.  Except for a few sorry weeds,
 nothing grows here.  Someone has dug holes of various sizes, leaving
 mounds of dirt and gravel everywhere.  A concrete birdbath stands in
 the center of the yard.  The back porch of the house lies directly to
 the south.

 The driveway is off to the southeast, past the corner of the garage.
 The garage itself stands directly to the east.

 Mrs. Dogwood is working in the garden next door.

>give brooch to dogwood
 "Hello again," you say.

 "Hi there, youngster," she replies.

 "Do you recognize this brooch, by any chance, Mrs. Dogwood?" you ask.

 "Yes!  That's it!  It's mine!  I thought it was gone forever.  Thank
 you so much for finding it for me." She takes the brooch and pins it
 to her jacket.

>ask dogwood about spells

 She titters.  "Magic?  You mean like spells and witchcraft and such
 muck?  Certainly not!  I'm a sensible modern woman.  All the same, one
 hears tales...."

>ask dogwood about music
 "I hardly know what to say!" she declares.

>ask about wigs
 "Can you tell me anything about Mrs. Pepper's wigs?" you ask.

 "Hideous, aren't they?" Mrs. Dogwood responds promptly.  "I don't know
 why she's so fond of them, or where she buys them, but I daresay
 there's no accounting for taste."

>ask dogwood about financial crisis
 "That's a bit complicated to go into right now, dear," she tells you.

>ask about writing on brush
 "Well..." she begins, then shakes her head, "No, I don't have time to
 explain all that now."

>ask about mozart
 "To tell you the truth," she begins, and then goes off into a rambling
 explanation you lose the thread of somewhere in the middle of the
 third sentence.

>ask about brush
 "That's a bit complicated to go into right now, dear," she tells you.

>give ocarina to dogwood
 You show the ocarina to Mrs. Dogwood, and her face wrinkles in a
 disgusted frown.  "That awful thing?  I've heard Mrs. Pepper tootling
 on it, though I don't think she could carry a tune in a basket.  She
 only plays it inside the house, thank goodness -- and I fancy the
 noise comes from upstairs."

>ask dogwood to play ocarina
 You suspect that trying to boss Mrs. Dogwood around may not be the
 best way to secure her friendly co-operation.

>examine me
 You're not wearing anything special today -- just a shirt, jeans, and
 a pair of sneakers.

>given brush to dogwood

 "I'm afraid I'm not all that interested in that right now, dear," she
 replies, with a quick glance at the brush.

>cast sleep

>wear green wig
 Okay, you're now wearing the green wig.

 "My goodness," Mrs. Dogwood exclaims.  "What's that on your head?  It
 looks just like one of Mrs. Pepper's awful wigs.  It looks rather
 silly on you, I must say, but I suppose young people's sense of what's
 fashionable or trendy is not quite the same as mine."

>cause sleep
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>look up sleep
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and find a listing for "sleep, inducing."
 On the indicated page, the book explains that to put someone to sleep,
 you need to be wearing a magically prepared garment or head-covering
 and chant a brief incantation while wielding the Sign of the Scarlet
 Fish.  Unfortunately, the incantation is written in an alphabet you've
 never seen before, although it may be in the same script as the
 writing on the hairbrush.  It looks rather like Arabic, but with a lot
 more squiggles.

 This boxy room is mostly unfurnished.  Its most interesting feature is

 brownish-green person.

 The door is to the north, and there's a window in the opposite wall.

 A pamphlet is lying on the floor.

 (Your score has just increased by three points.)

>read pamphlet
 (first taking the pamphlet)
 You flip through the pamphlet.  A lot of it is both boring and
 unlikely, but you manage to pick up one or two tidbits of information
 that might somehow be useful.  First, the odd-looking little man in
 the pot is undoubtedly a garden elf, and not a pixie, leprechaun, or
 hobbit.  The illustrations, though crudely drawn, make that pretty
 clear.  Second, garden elves are reputed to be a type of plant, not an
 animal at all, though they look like little people.  In the wild
 they're quite mobile: They can pop up out of the soil, duck down, and
 pop up again a hundred yards away in the blink of an eye -- but they
 can never venture more than a step or two away from the soil, as they
 have roots, not feet.

>get planter
 To pick up the pot, you'll need both hands free.

>pour water on elf
 When you lean over the pot and start to tip the glass of tap water
 into it, the elf writhes and convulses as if an electrical current
 were shooting through him.  "Nooooo!" he cries in a quivering little
 voice.  "Nasty chemicals!  Nooo, please.  Need nice fresh water, not
 nasty chemical water." He falls back, sobbing.

 She crosses her garden and returns a few moments later bearing a stick
 of bamboo, which she hands to you over the fence.  "Well, I believe
 I've done enough gardening for this afternoon," she finishes.  "I'm

 than like real thunder -- but all the same, the cloud dumps a downpour
 of rain onto the ground for about ten seconds before dissipating as
 abruptly as it gathered.  As the day is warm, the water on the ground
 swiftly evaporates in tendrils of steam.  A good bit of water has
 fallen into the birdbath, however -- so much that it's in no danger of
 evaporating.  The birdbath is now full of fresh rainwater.

 room leads down, roughly opposite the window in the east wall.

 The fridge contains a large wedge of blue cheese and a stale loaf of
 bread.

 There's an overpowering smell of over-ripe cheese.

>go south
 Hall
 This hall is little more than a narrow passage connecting the rooms to
 north and south.  On the east side a flight of stairs leads up to the
 floor above, and there's an opening to the west, with a black button
 next to it at waist height.

>go up
 Landing
 The landing runs north-south past a steel door to the west.  A
 staircase leads down to the floor below, and there's a black button
 low on the west wall.  Immediately to the south the bedroom door is
 open.

>go south
 Front Bedroom
 This boxy room is mostly unfurnished.  Its most interesting feature is
 a large pot or planter -- the sort of thing you'd expect to see a
 potted palm growing in.  In this pot, however, is a small
 brownish-green person.

 The door is to the north, and there's a window in the opposite wall.

>give water
 (to the elf)
 "Hi there!" you say.

 As the fresh rainwater trickles into the soil of the pot, the elf
 begins to uncurl and stretch.  No longer a shriveled ball cowering in
 the pot, he stands up straight, his eyes bright.  "Ahh ... ahh!  You
 don't know how wonderful that feels!  I think maybe I won't die today
 after all. I'd hug you if I could, but --" He bends his knees as if
 trying to lift his feet free of the soil in the pot.  "-- I've been
 rather planted, you see.  I'm an elf, by the way, in case you hadn't
 guessed."

 (Your score has just increased by four points.)

>talk to elf
 You already have the elf's attention.

 (You could ask him about himself, Mrs. Pepper, your skateboard, or the
 pot, or tell him about your skateboard.  You could also ask or tell
 him about various other things that might occur to you.)

>ask elf about skateboard
 "Can you tell me how I might be able to get my skateboard out from
 under the porch?" you ask.  "I think the space under there is just too
 small for me to crawl in."

 "If you could get me downstairs and outdoors, I could certainly
 retrieve it for you," the elf replies.  "I did notice that beneath the
 porch is only bare soil, not pavement, so I could go there.  But how
 you'll be able to get me downstairs I don't know. This pot looks
 awfully heavy!"

>ask elf for page
 "Could you give me...?" you begin.

 "I doubt it," the elf replies, before you can even complete your
 request.  "My powers are very limited, you see."

>look up sleep
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and find a listing for "sleep, inducing."
 On the indicated page, the book explains that to put someone to sleep,
 you need to be wearing a magically prepared garment or head-covering
 and chant a brief incantation while wielding the Sign of the Scarlet
 Fish.  Unfortunately, the incantation is written in an alphabet you've
 never seen before, although it may be in the same script as the
 writing on the hairbrush.  It looks rather like Arabic, but with a lot
 more squiggles.

>ask elf for page
 "Could you give me...?" you begin.

 "I doubt it," the elf replies, before you can even complete your
 request.  "My powers are very limited, you see."

>ask elf to read script
 The elf sees no script.

>ask elf about writing
 "I'm more concerned about how I might be returned to my native soil,"
 the elf says.

>break pot
 Painful experience has taught you that breaking things quite often
 gets you into trouble.

>give brush to elf
 "I don't have any use for that, I'm afraid," the elf says.  "Thank you
 for showing it to me, though."

>ask elf to read transcription
 The word "transcription" is not necessary in this story.

>look up swerve
 (in the yellow book)
 You thumb through the index and after hunting for a bit, find a
 listing for "vehicles, wheeled, causing to swerve." The indicated page
 seems to have been torn out, however.

>ask about car
 "I'm not much of a conversationalist," he admits.  "You've stumped me
 ... if you'll forgive the term."

>ask elf about black button
 "That's not something I know very much about," he responds.  "I'm very
 sorry."

>ask elf about locked door
 "I don't know what to tell you about that," the elf says, shaking his
 head.

>ask elf about machine
 "You humans must lead such interesting lives," the elf says.  "You're
 just bursting with questions and comments!"

>ask elf about bamboo
 "Have you noticed the beautiful bamboo plant growing in the neighbor's
 yard?" you ask.

 "Oh, yes," the elf replies.  "From time to time I've seen humans using
 bamboo sticks for magical purposes, but I really don't know anything
 about how that might work.  Perhaps you could look it up in the
 Encyclopedia Enchantica, if you can find a copy."

>give book to elf
 "I don't have any use for that, I'm afraid," the elf says.  "Thank you
 for showing it to me, though."

>ask elf about screwdriver
 "I'm more concerned about how I might be returned to my native soil,"
 the elf says.

>dig soil
 You really don't need to mess with the dirt in the pot.

>move pot
 You push and tug at the pot, but it fails to scoot more than an inch
 or so across the floor.  It's too heavy to slide so easily.

>take soil
 You can't have that; it's part of the heavy pot.

>eat dirt
 You really don't need to mess with the dirt in the pot.

>put elf in glass
 (first trying to take the elf)
 His legs seem to be firmly rooted in the soil in the pot.

 The cellar is dim and dismal.  A flight of stairs leads up.  Near the

 side squats a heavy piece of machinery, and a plank shelf has been
 built into the opposite wall.

 The old wheelchair is resting just by the shelf.

>examine machine
 The innards of the machine are concealed by a metal housing.  On one
 side is a large vertically mounted wheel, around both sides of which a
 sturdy cable runs up through the ceiling.  Not far from the cable a
 black-coated wire dangles down from the ceiling.  The lower end of the
 wire swings free not far from a screw that protrudes from the top of
 the machine.  Mounted in the north wall just behind the machine is a
 small metal door.

>examine screw
 The screw protrudes from the top plate of the machine housing.

 The photo is of Mrs. Pepper and a man you've never seen.  She is
 standing with her hand on his shoulder; he is sitting in a wheelchair,

 Sitting Room
 This boxy little room is furnished in a fussy, old-fashioned style.
 The one modern touch is a wide-screen TV, with a couch facing it.  A

 the President wants to invade Liechtenstein as the next step in the
 War on Error, but no one in the administration knows where it is.  Or
 at least, that's the impression you're left with.  Naturally, they
 claim to know precisely where it is, and the newscaster is too
 cowardly or too oblivious to point out that they obviously don't.

 Front Yard
 The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except
 for a few hardy weeds.  A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the
 sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The
 driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards
 what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the
 walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree.

 Driveway by House
 Mrs. Pepper's house lies directly to the west; the drive continues to

 Standing directly to the north is a detached garage.

 You see a trash can and a trash can lid here.

 Back Porch
 The back porch is a plain wooden structure, with no railing or

 afterthought.  It's several feet above the ground, with a ramp leading
 up to one side.  The back door leading into the house is just to the
 south.

>go north
 Back Yard
 The back yard is in a dreadful state.  Except for a few sorry weeds,
 nothing grows here.  Someone has dug holes of various sizes, leaving
 mounds of dirt and gravel everywhere.  A concrete birdbath stands in

 the south.

 The driveway is off to the southeast, past the corner of the garage.
 The garage itself stands directly to the east.

>examine holes
 Which holes do you mean, the excavations, or the ocarina?

>excavation
 Holes of various sizes have been dug across the lawn, seemingly at
 random, as if some demented fortune-seeker were desperately seeking
 buried treasure.  The more prosaic explanation, given the state of the
 back yard, is that the holes are due to energetic but incompetent
 gardening efforts.

 Sitting Room
 This boxy little room is furnished in a fussy, old-fashioned style.
 The one modern touch is a wide-screen TV, with a couch facing it.  A
 low coffee table sits in front of the couch, and a fireplace is set in
 another wall.  There's a door to the south, and the open doorway to
 the hall is on the north.

>go south
 Front Porch
 The front door lies immediately to the north; the front yard is to the
 south.  There's a doorbell button just by the front door.

>go south
 Front Yard
 The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except
 for a few hardy weeds.  A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the
 sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The
 driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards
 what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the
 walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree.

>examine tree
 A few green leaves cling to the crooked branches of the tree, but
 really it looks more dead than alive.  Mrs. Pepper calls it her orange
 tree -- in fact, one of your more memorable run-ins with her occurred
 when she accused you of stealing oranges from the tree.  But in truth
 you've never seen an orange growing on the tree.  The idea that it's
 an orange tree is purely a theory, as far as you're concerned.

>get orange
 It doesn't look too healthy, but it's probably best left where it is.

 If the game is not understanding you, try issuing your commands in the
 imperative: e.g., THROW THE KNIFE, but not I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO
 THROW THE KNIFE.  Chatty sentences such as YOU ARE A VERY STUPID GAME
 will only prove themselves true.

 If you really feel that the game is looking for a word that is not a
 verb (as the solution to a riddle, eg.) try some variations, such as
 SAY FLOOBLE.

 If you need more help, try the HELP command.

 Moving rather carefully, the elf lifts one foot out of the soil of the
 pot and extends his leg until the foot (it doesn't really look much
 like a foot, but you don't get a very good glimpse) touches the soil.
 In the blink of an eye, his leg takes root. He repeats the procedure
 with the other foot, and then stands before you quite proudly in the
 rocky soil of the yard.

 "You've saved me!" he cries.  "I'm free from that horrible woman's
 schemes! It was my own fault," he says, looking chagrined.  "Her
 garden is such a disaster, so dreadful and dismal and abysmal.  Day
 after day I would see her out there raking, and nothing to rake but
 rocks!  Finally, one day it was too much for me.  I popped up and told
 her in no uncertain terms what a shameful mess she'd made of it.

 "She asked for my help.  Demanded it, truth be told.  I told her,
 there's not much I can do with a garden so decrepit.  I can encourage
 a seed to sprout, or perhaps coax a tree to bring forth a few extra
 blossoms, but fill a garden of gravel with flowers and vegetables?  It
 would take a hundred elves a hundred days to do it.

 "She listened to me, nodding all the while.  I thought she understood.
 But then she did -- something, I'm not sure what, except that I think
 it was a magic spell that came from the absurd thing she was wearing
 on her head.  I felt myself getting sleepy, and when I awoke I was in
 that lonely room, in this pot, completely cut off from the soil of the
 Earth.

 "And then she told me if I wouldn't promise to make her garden grow,
 she would never let me go!  I told her it was beyond my poor powers,
 but she didn't want to believe me.  Lately she's begun tormenting me
 by not watering me.  As if that would convince me to promise something
 I can't possibly achieve.  We elves know better than to make promises
 we can't keep.  If you hadn't come along, I'm sure I would have dried
 up and blown away before another day had gone by. I'd like to give you
 a reward -- but sad to say, I'm not a leprechaun.  I haven't any gold.
 I'm just a common garden elf, with only a tiny bit of vegetable magic
 at my disposal.

 "Oh, I know what I could do.  Let's go to the front yard."

>take pot
 The heavy pot is too far away.

>get skateboard
 Your skateboard is too far away.

>go south
 "No!  No!  Not that way!" the elf stops you, his voice strangely
 compelling, "We must go that way!" He nods towards the section of
 driveway beside the house.

>se
 The elf leads the way to the side of the house.

 Driveway by House
 Mrs. Pepper's house lies directly to the west; the drive continues to
 the south, and a gravel path leads around the house to the northwest.
 Standing directly to the north is a detached garage.

 You see a trash can and a trash can lid here.

 The elf beckons you to follow him south along the driveway.

>go south
 The elf strides ahead of you into the drive.

 Driveway
 The driveway continues northward along the side of the house, and
 leads south out to sidewalk and beyond it the street.  On the east the
 driveway is bordered by a high fence, and Mrs. Pepper's front yard
 lies to the west.

 The elf nods towards the front yard, indicating that you are to follow
 him westwards.

>go west
 The elf accompanies you into the front yard.

 Front Yard
 The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except
 for a few hardy weeds.  A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the
 sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The
 driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards
 what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the
 walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree.

 The elf stops in the middle of the front yard and nods towards the
 tree.  "Do you see that poor bedraggled orange tree there?  It hasn't
 borne fruit in years, and may never again, unless someone else buys
 this house and nurtures it back to health.  But it's not quite dead,
 no indeed.  Watch closely now."

 He gestures at the nearest branch with his long, slim, gnarled
 fingers.  As you watch, a single bud bursts forth at the end of the
 branch.  At first no more than a tiny green nub, it swells rapidly.
 In a few seconds a plump, ripe orange is hanging from the branch.

 "Go ahead," says the elf.  "Pick the orange and enjoy it.  It's yours.
 Oh," he adds, handing you your skateboard, "you nearly forgot this."
 Before you can stammer your thanks -- before you can blurt out the
 dozen questions jostling in your head about what it's like being an
 elf, and where he came from, and whether you'll ever see him again --
 the elf has somehow folded himself inward, like a fast-motion film of
 a growing plant when the film is run backwards.  He shrinks and runs
 downward into the soil, and he's gone.

 Driveway
 The driveway continues northward along the side of the house, and

 The fence looks to be quite solid, and there's no gate.

 At the End of the Driveway
 You're at the outer end of Mrs. Pepper's driveway, which extends to

 neglected lawn.  The sidewalk runs east and west from here, and the
 street is to the south.

>inventory
 You are carrying your skateboard.

>go east
 On the Sidewalk
 This stretch of sidewalk runs more or less east-west between the busy
 street to the south and a tall, water-stained fence to the north.
 Just a few yards further west the fence ends where Mrs. Pepper's
 driveway thrusts into the roadway.

>go east
 You've just finished school for the day -- you don't want to go back
 there now!

>go south
 There's too much traffic for you to consider crossing the street.

>go west
 On the Sidewalk by the Front Yard
 To the north, across a sadly dried-up and decrepit yard, stands Mrs.
 Pepper's house.  You can also go east or west along the sidewalk.  The
 busy street is to the south.  A telephone pole plastered with the
 scraps of old posters stands here.

>go west
 After taking a hurried detour to put Mrs. Pepper's possessions back
 where you found them, lock her house and garage, and toss the keys
 under the back porch, you head home, happy as can be: Not only did you
 meet an elf and save him from certain death, but you got your
 skateboard back too.

 Cellar
 The cellar is dim and dismal.  A flight of stairs leads up.  Near the
 foot of the stairs a slim chain dangles from the ceiling.  Off to one
 side squats a heavy piece of machinery, and a plank shelf has been
 built into the opposite wall.

 The old wheelchair is resting just by the shelf.

 Back Porch
 The back porch is a plain wooden structure, with no railing or
 decoration.  It looks as if it was tacked onto the house as an
 afterthought.  It's several feet above the ground, with a ramp leading
 up to one side.  The back door leading into the house is just to the
 south.

>go north
 Back Yard
 The back yard is in a dreadful state.  Except for a few sorry weeds,
 nothing grows here.  Someone has dug holes of various sizes, leaving
 mounds of dirt and gravel everywhere.  A concrete birdbath stands in

 Garage
 The interior of the garage smells dank and musty.  A little sunlight
 leaks in through cracks and knotholes, and a pile of clutter occupies
 one corner.  A workbench runs along the wall.

 A long-handled rake leans against the wall.

 On the workbench is a toolbox.

>search debris
>open toolbox
 The word "debris" is not necessary in this story.

 Opening the toolbox reveals a screwdriver.

>examine box
 The toolbox is made of metal, and has a hinged lid.  Except for a few
 dents and dribbles of paint, it appears to be in good condition.  It's
 open, and contains a screwdriver.

>take screwdriver
 You pick up the screwdriver.

>examine clutter
 The pile of clutter in the corner seems to consist mostly of discarded
 cardboard cartons, which are covered with dust and cobwebs.

>search clutter
 You poke around among the cartons for a minute, but there seems to be
 nothing of any interest lurking there.

>examine workbench
 The workbench is built along one wall of the garage.  It's rather
 stained and nicked, as if someone used it at one time, but now it's
 mostly bare of tools.  On the workbench is a toolbox.

>get rake
 You pick up the rake.

 The old wheelchair is resting just by the shelf.

>examine machinery
 The innards of the machine are concealed by a metal housing.  On one
 side is a large vertically mounted wheel, around both sides of which a
 sturdy cable runs up through the ceiling.  Not far from the cable a
 black-coated wire dangles down from the ceiling.  The lower end of the
 wire swings free not far from a screw that protrudes from the top of
 the machine.  Mounted in the north wall just behind the machine is a
 small metal door.

 Front Bedroom
 This boxy room is mostly unfurnished.  Its most interesting feature is

 The door is to the north, and there's a window in the opposite wall.

>ask elf about skateboard
 With some pride, you tell the elf how you got your skateboard out from
 under the porch using the rake.  "I'm very happy for you," he says,
 not sounding particularly happy.  "I've seen young humans racing down
 the walk on skateboards, and it does look like fun.  But I've never
 been on one myself, nor am ever likely to be, since I have roots in
 place of feet."

>ask elf about elevator
 "Did you know there's an elevator in this house?" you ask the elf.

 "What's an elevator?" he replies.  "I'm a creature of the Great
 Outdoors, you'll understand.  I know very little about what's inside
 houses."

 "It's ... well, it's a little room that goes up and down," you
 explain.

 "You mean, like a bird?"

 "Well, no," you admit.  "An elevator isn't really very much like a
 bird.  It's more like ... oh, never mind."

>ask elf about elf
 "I don't know very much about ... little people," you venture.  "Are
 you by any chance an elf?"

 "Why, that I am.  A good guess.  Not a very important elf, though,
 just a common garden elf.  My name is Turlix." He bows.

>ask elf about me
 "That's not something I know very much about," he responds.  "I'm very
 sorry."

>ask turlix about mr pepper
 "I'm not much of a conversationalist," he admits.  "You've stumped me

 "You humans must lead such interesting lives," the elf says.  "You're
 just bursting with questions and comments!"

>ask elf about wheelchair
 "I don't know what to tell you about that," the elf says, shaking his
 head.

>ask elf about elves
 "Do all garden elves live in pots in houses?" you ask.  "I mean, I
 wouldn't have guessed."

 "Oh, no," he says, shaking his head sadly.  "I'm being held captive by
 that awful woman. It was my own fault," he says, looking chagrined.
 "Her garden is such a disaster, so dreadful and dismal and abysmal.
 Day after day I would see her out there raking, and nothing to rake
 but rocks!  Finally, one day it was too much for me.  I popped up and
 told her in no uncertain terms what a shameful mess she'd made of it.

 "She asked for my help.  Demanded it, truth be told.  I told her,
 there's not much I can do with a garden so decrepit.  I can encourage
 a seed to sprout, or perhaps coax a tree to bring forth a few extra
 blossoms, but fill a garden of gravel with flowers and vegetables?  It
 would take a hundred elves a hundred days to do it.

 "She listened to me, nodding all the while.  I thought she understood.
 But then she did -- something, I'm not sure what, except that I think
 it was a magic spell that came from the absurd thing she was wearing
 on her head.  I felt myself getting sleepy, and when I awoke I was up
 here in this room, in this pot, completely cut off from the soil of
 the Earth.

 "And then she told me if I wouldn't promise to make her garden grow,
 she would never let me go!  I told her it was beyond my poor powers,
 but she didn't want to believe me.  Lately she's begun tormenting me
 by not watering me.  As if that would convince me to promise something
 I can't possibly achieve.  We elves know better than to make promises
 we can't keep.  If you hadn't come along, I'm sure I would have dried
 up and blown away before another day had gone by."

>inventory
 You are carrying a screwdriver, a small flashlight, a glass, a butter
 knife, four wigs (one green, one auburn, one blond, and one black), a
 brush, a musical score, an ocarina, a remote control, a yellow book, a
 piece of paper, a framed photo, a glass jar (broken), a pamphlet, a
 bunch of keys, a bamboo stick, a rake, and your skateboard.

>ask him about pot
 "Are you comfortable in that pot?" you ask the elf.

 "Oh, it's not too bad," he replies.  "It will be months before I'm
 root-bound, and if I can't escape from here before then I'm sure I'll
 be dead."

>ask elf about escape
 "I'm more concerned about how I might be returned to my native soil,"
 the elf says.

 Front Bedroom
 This boxy room is mostly unfurnished.  Its most interesting feature is
 a large pot or planter -- the sort of thing you'd expect to see a
 potted palm growing in.  In this pot, however, is a small
 brownish-green person.

 The door is to the north, and there's a window in the opposite wall.

 Landing
 The landing runs north-south past a steel door to the west.  A
 staircase leads down to the floor below, and there's a black button
 low on the west wall.  Immediately to the south the bedroom door is

 Hall
 This hall is little more than a narrow passage connecting the rooms to

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is small, and equipped with the usual appliances,
 including a cupboard, a sink, a stove, and a refrigerator, though most
 of the space is taken up by the unusually bulky wooden table standing
 in the middle of the room.  The back door leads north, while to the
 south is an open doorway.  A flight of stairs on the west side of the
 room leads down, roughly opposite the window in the east wall.

 The fridge contains a large wedge of blue cheese and a stale loaf of
 bread.

 There's an overpowering smell of over-ripe cheese.

>examine cupboard
 It's seen better days, but it still appears functional.  It's open.

>examine cheese
 The cheese is runny in some spots and dried and crusty in other spots,
 all at the same time.  Its odor is remarkable: If it gets much riper,
 it'll probably come when you call it.  Phewww!  It smells horrible.

>take chees
 The word "chees" is not necessary in this story.

 Back Porch
 The back porch is a plain wooden structure, with no railing or

 Back Yard
 The back yard is in a dreadful state.  Except for a few sorry weeds,
 nothing grows here.  Someone has dug holes of various sizes, leaving
 mounds of dirt and gravel everywhere.  A concrete birdbath stands in
 the center of the yard.  The back porch of the house lies directly to
 the south.

 The driveway is off to the southeast, past the corner of the garage.
 The garage itself stands directly to the east.

 "That's not something I know very much about," he responds.  "I'm very
 sorry."

>ask elf about native soil
 "Where do you usually live?" you ask the elf.  "Or grow, or whatever
 it is you do?"

 "Almost anywhere there's a bit of soil," he replies.  "Even if it's
 gravelly or parched, I don't mind too much."

>examine pot
 The fat brown pot looks to be made of earthenware.  It's full of dirt,
 and a small, wrinkled, brownish-green person is standing in it.

 Cellar
 The cellar is dim and dismal.  A flight of stairs leads up.  Near the

 side squats a heavy piece of machinery, and a plank shelf has been
 built into the opposite wall.

 The old wheelchair is resting just by the shelf.

>get wheelchair
 The old wheelchair would be far too awkward to carry.

>pull wheelchair e
 Something is stopping the wheelchair from moving -- probably the

 nothing grows here.  Someone has dug holes of various sizes, leaving
 mounds of dirt and gravel everywhere.  A concrete birdbath stands in
 the center of the yard.  The back porch of the house lies directly to
 the south.

 The driveway is off to the southeast, past the corner of the garage.
 The garage itself stands directly to the east.

 The elf is standing in the pot that's on your skateboard.

 Your skateboard comes to rest in the back yard.

 Moving rather carefully, the elf lifts one foot out of the soil of the
 pot and extends his leg until the foot (it doesn't really look much
 like a foot, but you don't get a very good glimpse) touches the soil.
 In the blink of an eye, his leg takes root. He repeats the procedure
 with the other foot, and then stands before you quite proudly in the
 rocky soil of the yard.

 "You've saved me!" he cries.  "I'm free from that horrible woman's
 schemes! I'd like to give you a reward -- but sad to say, I'm not a
 leprechaun.  I haven't any gold.  I'm just a common garden elf, with
 only a tiny bit of vegetable magic at my disposal.

 "Oh, I know what I could do.  Let's go to the front yard."

>se
 The elf leads the way to the side of the house.

 Driveway by House
 Mrs. Pepper's house lies directly to the west; the drive continues to
 the south, and a gravel path leads around the house to the northwest.
 Standing directly to the north is a detached garage.

 You see a trash can and a trash can lid here.

 The elf beckons you to follow him south along the driveway.

>go south
 The elf strides ahead of you into the drive.

 Driveway
 The driveway continues northward along the side of the house, and
 leads south out to sidewalk and beyond it the street.  On the east the
 driveway is bordered by a high fence, and Mrs. Pepper's front yard
 lies to the west.

 The elf nods towards the front yard, indicating that you are to follow
 him westwards.

>go west
 The elf accompanies you into the front yard.

 Front Yard
 The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except
 for a few hardy weeds.  A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the
 sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The
 driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards
 what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the
 walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree.

 The elf stops in the middle of the front yard and nods towards the
 tree.  "Do you see that poor bedraggled orange tree there?  It hasn't
 borne fruit in years, and may never again, unless someone else buys
 this house and nurtures it back to health.  But it's not quite dead,
 no indeed.  Watch closely now."

 He gestures at the nearest branch with his long, slim, gnarled
 fingers.  As you watch, a single bud bursts forth at the end of the
 branch.  At first no more than a tiny green nub, it swells rapidly.
 In a few seconds a plump, ripe orange is hanging from the branch.

 "Go ahead," says the elf.  "Pick the orange and enjoy it.  It's yours.
 Oh," he adds, handing you your skateboard, "you nearly forgot this."
 Before you can stammer your thanks -- before you can blurt out the
 dozen questions jostling in your head about what it's like being an
 elf, and where he came from, and whether you'll ever see him again --
 the elf has somehow folded himself inward, like a fast-motion film of
 a growing plant when the film is run backwards.  He shrinks and runs
 downward into the soil, and he's gone.

 (Your score has just increased by six points.)

>score
 In 645 moves, you have scored 50 of a possible 50 points.

>go south
 On the Sidewalk by the Front Yard
 To the north, across a sadly dried-up and decrepit yard, stands Mrs.
 Pepper's house.  You can also go east or west along the sidewalk.  The
 busy street is to the south.  A telephone pole plastered with the
 scraps of old posters stands here.

>go west
 After taking a hurried detour to put Mrs. Pepper's possessions back
 where you found them, lock her house and garage, and toss the keys
 under the back porch, you head home, happy as can be: Not only did you
 meet an elf and save him from certain death, but you got your
 skateboard back too.
