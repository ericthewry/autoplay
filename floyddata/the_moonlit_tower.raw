The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>The Moonlit Tower</i>, written by Yoon&nbsp;Ha&nbsp;Lee.  <i>The Moonlit Tower</i> was originally released as part of the 2002 IF Competition, where it took fourth place. It was also nominated for Xyzzies for Best Writing, Best Story, and Best Setting; it ultimately won the Xyzzy for Best Writing.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1925"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | The Moonlit Tower was written by Yoon Ha Lee, a dabbler in math, sf/f
<b>Floyd</b> | writing, linguistics, and other things, as an entry in IFComp 2002. I

<b>Floyd</b> | began coding it in the summer of 2002 when my sister introduced me to
<b>Floyd</b> | the evils of Interactive Fiction with Emily Short's Pytho's Mask and
<b>Floyd</b> | Andrew Plotkin's Shade. I've since encountered other wonderful
<b>Floyd</b> | examples, but those were my first, and what got me hooked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is my first attempt at creating Interactive Fiction if you don't

<b>Floyd</b> | count Choose Your Own Adventure-type juvenalia written in grade
<b>Floyd</b> | school; it's certainly my first effort programming in Inform.

<b>Floyd</b> | Silent Symphony

<b>Floyd</b> | A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center.
<b>Floyd</b> | There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court
<b>Floyd</b> | ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay
<b>Floyd</b> | ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in
<b>Floyd</b> | evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an
<b>Floyd</b> | illusion of greater depth.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game's genesis can be blamed on two things: my sister's sudden
<b>Floyd</b> | discovery of and addiction to Interactive Fiction (IF), and my
<b>Floyd</b> | fascination with myth and symbol.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | For the first, it's probably several kinds of insane to enter one's
<b>Floyd</b> | first work of IF in the IFComp. (I'm told that "this is my first game"
<b>Floyd</b> | is a bad way to start an entry...?) I found it to be several kinds of
<b>Floyd</b> | educational, though--I knew beta-testers were helpful and generous
<b>Floyd</b> | souls, but I hadn't realized how helpful and generous they were!--and
<b>Floyd</b> | the deadline encouraged me to finish the project instead of leaving it

<b>Floyd</b> | to float in limbo.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The fact that this is my first game also led to certain design
<b>Floyd</b> | decisions. For one thing, no NPCs. I admire the depth of conversation
<b>Floyd</b> | available in games like Emily Short's Pytho's Mask, but I peeked at
<b>Floyd</b> | the coding necessary to implement the most basic ASK/TELL system and

<b>Floyd</b> | concluded there was no way I was going to learn enough Inform to do a
<b>Floyd</b> | convincing job with one NPC, let alone several, within the time frame
<b>Floyd</b> | available. Implementing the inanimate jade compass and its associated
<b>Floyd</b> | seasonal changes turned out to be enough of a headache. I thought of
<b>Floyd</b> | having the player wake up in a tomb (generally a good reason for other
<b>Floyd</b> | people to be absent), the opening lines "No, not a prison..." came to

<b>Floyd</b> | me, and I was off and running.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (Aside: For an idea of the time I had available: I started learning
<b>Floyd</b> | Inform sometime in July. I got married on 3 August 2002, which was
<b>Floyd</b> | rather more of a priority, and moved from Ithaca, NY to Boston in
<b>Floyd</b> | mid-August. And my husband is already resigned to the fact that he's

<b>Floyd</b> | going to hear me muttering arcanely about "forgot to give it
<b>Floyd</b> | pluralname" and "you should be scenery" when I'm at my computer.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For another, the tower was a deliberately extensible (or collapsible)
<b>Floyd</b> | design in that I figured I could add as many "levels" or floors as I
<b>Floyd</b> | had time for, with a small number of rooms per level. Hence, a wimpy

<b>Floyd</b> | three-storey tower with only half-a-dozen rooms. And no, I don't plan
<b>Floyd</b> | on adding more floors. I think I'm burned out on towers.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I also made the mistake of making up puzzles as I went along, which
<b>Floyd</b> | will not happen again. The only reason I got away with it (or not, as
<b>Floyd</b> | the case may be) was the small size of the game. It has, however,

<b>Floyd</b> | gotten me thinking about modular puzzle design, which might be a good
<b>Floyd</b> | thing, though unfortunately it isn't immediately useful to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The setting itself draws loosely from Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and
<b>Floyd</b> | Mongolian sources, though you won't find any isomorphisms. I took
<b>Floyd</b> | considerable liberty with the phoenix and dragon; the Heavenly Horse,

<b>Floyd</b> | which appears in a famous Shilla (Korean) tomb, was co-opted into a
<b>Floyd</b> | Moon-figure. The tale of the White Archer was adapted from "The Legend
<b>Floyd</b> | of Erkhii Mergen, the Archer," which you can find in Hillary Roe
<b>Floyd</b> | Metternich's Mongolian Folktales, but I collided it with the Japanese
<b>Floyd</b> | and Chinese tales of the sun going into hiding and having to be sung
<b>Floyd</b> | back into the world. The chrysanthemum is a familiar Japanese symbol,

<b>Floyd</b> | and some of the earliest ocarinas were found in China. Kite-flying
<b>Floyd</b> | (and sometimes fighting, as well as various militant uses) were
<b>Floyd</b> | recorded from early times in China, Korea, and/or Japan. And for
<b>Floyd</b> | seasonal motifs I drew freely on my years in Korea, where my parents
<b>Floyd</b> | were born.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | One element had nothing to do with mythology, and came from a homebrew
<b>Floyd</b> | roleplaying setting: the Brixten Shanai, a tower whose starry stairs
<b>Floyd</b> | stretched endlessly into the void. A minor thing, perhaps, but it has
<b>Floyd</b> | some nostalgia value for me and my sister.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, one of the attractions of this medium for me is that it

<b>Floyd</b> | allows me both to exercise rusty computer programming skills (though
<b>Floyd</b> | arguably Andrew Plotkin's Lists and Lists would do that too!) and my
<b>Floyd</b> | writing skills. After getting used to linear storytelling, it was an
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting exercise trying to find some way of conveying a sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | story and setting without "railroading" the player overmuch. I've also
<b>Floyd</b> | been on a crusade for non-visual sensory details ever since I read

<b>Floyd</b> | Poul Anderson's rule of thumb for at least one non-visual detail per
<b>Floyd</b> | page. I don't know if I succeeded entirely--puzzle design in
<b>Floyd</b> | particular is going to be an Achilles heel for some time--but now I
<b>Floyd</b> | have a better idea of how to go about it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now that you've heard more than you ever wanted to know about the

<b>Floyd</b> | game, it's time to send you on your way so I can start working on my
<b>Floyd</b> | next crazy project!
