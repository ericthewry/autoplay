The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>All Things Devours</i>, written by half sick of shadows.  <I>All Things Devours</I> was released as part of the 2004 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took third place.  It was nominated for Xyzzies for Best Puzzles and Best Use of Medium, and won the Xyzzy for Best Individual Puzzle.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/All_Things_Devours'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All Things Devours is a short piece of interactive fiction, leaning
<b>Floyd</b> | strongly towards the text-adventure end of the spectrum. It explores
<b>Floyd</b> | an all-too-familiar science fiction paradigm in what I hope is a
<b>Floyd</b> | rather refreshing and satisfying manner. However, due to the intrinsic
<b>Floyd</b> | nature of its subject matter, it is not as fair as one might hope for
<b>Floyd</b> | a modern piece of interactive fiction. In particular, any move you
<b>Floyd</b> | make may put things into an unwinnable state. You are therefore
<b>Floyd</b> | encouraged to save frequently, and also to realise that you will
<b>Floyd</b> | probably have to start over several times to find the most
<b>Floyd</b> | satisfactory ending.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You had built the prototype to get a strong negative result, to show
<b>Floyd</b> | that the standard model of Quantum Mechanics led to demonstrably false
<b>Floyd</b> | claims involving reverse causation. You were mistaken. One by one,
<b>Floyd</b> | your experiments showed your preliminary calculations to have been
<b>Floyd</b> | correct. When the military removed you from your project, only one
<b>Floyd</b> | aspect remained untested  -- an aspect you had been loath to test
<b>Floyd</b> | before you could predict the results -- inconsistent observation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What would happen if anomalies were observed by those in the original
<b>Floyd</b> | time-line? Your prior experiments had heavily shielded the prototype
<b>Floyd</b> | from outside interaction to avoid the very possibility. And as the
<b>Floyd</b> | calculations came out time and again, that is the only reason you are
<b>Floyd</b> | alive today. When an observer in the original time-line has an
<b>Floyd</b> | anomolous observation, the wave function of the temporally relocated
<b>Floyd</b> | object collapses and the relocation retrospectively fails, preserving
<b>Floyd</b> | chronological consistency. There is just one side effect: total
<b>Floyd</b> | transformation of the object's mass into a burst of photons -- pure
<b>Floyd</b> | energy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You tried to tell them over and again. They assumed you were merely
<b>Floyd</b> | jealous of the takeover. Now, the night before their scheduled 'first
<b>Floyd</b> | main experiment', you have come to put an end to it all. To destroy
<b>Floyd</b> | your prototype and avoid tomorrow's nightmare.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The prototype itself a six foot tall, four foot wide cylinder, clad
<b>Floyd</b> | with brushed steel. The frame and door were fitted with quantum
<b>Floyd</b> | shielding to prevent decoherence of the wave function, but now the
<b>Floyd</b> | door has been removed and any use of the machine is potentially
<b>Floyd</b> | disastrous.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On close inspection, it appears that an attempt is in progress to move
<b>Floyd</b> | the control panel so that it can be operated from the inside. As it

<b>Floyd</b> | Tuesday 12th October 2004
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At precisely 4:21 am this morning a catastrophe of unprecedented scale
<b>Floyd</b> | occurred. An immense explosion -- that could only have been atomic in
<b>Floyd</b> | nature -- tore through the city and suburbs of Boston MA, destroying
<b>Floyd</b> | all in its path. Casualties are expected to number in the millions.
<b>Floyd</b> | The President has declared a state of emergency across the nation and
<b>Floyd</b> | the military is mobilizing for a possible war with the as yet unknown
<b>Floyd</b> | enemy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This thing all things devours:
<b>Floyd</b> | birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
<b>Floyd</b> | gnaws iron, bites steel;
<b>Floyd</b> | grinds hard stones to meal;
<b>Floyd</b> | slays king, ruins town;
<b>Floyd</b> | and beats high mountain down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |     *** You have failed ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move

<b>Floyd</b> | Nearby, against the north wall is the prototype, a six foot cylinder

<b>Floyd</b> | Tuesday 12th October 2004
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At precisely 4:20 am this morning a catastrophe of unprecedented scale
<b>Floyd</b> | occurred. An immense explosion -- that could only have been atomic in
<b>Floyd</b> | nature -- tore through the city and suburbs of Boston MA, destroying
<b>Floyd</b> | all in its path. Casualties are expected to number in the millions.
<b>Floyd</b> | The President has declared a state of emergency across the nation and
<b>Floyd</b> | the military is mobilizing for a possible war with the as yet unknown
<b>Floyd</b> | enemy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This thing all things devours:
<b>Floyd</b> | birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
<b>Floyd</b> | gnaws iron, bites steel;
<b>Floyd</b> | grinds hard stones to meal;
<b>Floyd</b> | slays king, ruins town;
<b>Floyd</b> | and beats high mountain down.
<b>Floyd</b> | You hold your breath and activate the prototype.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |     *** You have failed ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move
<b>Floyd</b> | or QUIT?

<b>Floyd</b> | Tuesday 12th October 2004
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At precisely 4:20 am this morning a catastrophe of unprecedented scale
<b>Floyd</b> | occurred. An immense explosion -- that could only have been atomic in
<b>Floyd</b> | nature -- tore through the city and suburbs of Boston MA, destroying
<b>Floyd</b> | all in its path. Casualties are expected to number in the millions.
<b>Floyd</b> | The President has declared a state of emergency across the nation and
<b>Floyd</b> | the military is mobilizing for a possible war with the as yet unknown
<b>Floyd</b> | enemy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This thing all things devours:
<b>Floyd</b> | birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
<b>Floyd</b> | gnaws iron, bites steel;
<b>Floyd</b> | grinds hard stones to meal;
<b>Floyd</b> | slays king, ruins town;
<b>Floyd</b> | and beats high mountain down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |     *** You have failed ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move
