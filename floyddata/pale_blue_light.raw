					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of <em>Pale Blue Light and My Girfriend's an Evil Bitch
Pale Blue Light and My Girfriend's an Evil Bitch</em>, written
						by Kazuki Mishima and Divarin, respectively. These games were both released in 2011; ClubFloyd played them because the XyzzyAwards nomination period was open and they were exploring 2011 games that they hadn't yet played.
						
						You can learn more about the games, including how to download them, by visiting

<b>Floyd</b> | Johann found the whole rattling car empty save one seat occupied by a
<b>Floyd</b> | girl about his age, whose face was hidden behind a large folding star
<b>Floyd</b> | chart, labeled MAP in one corner. He approached softly. There was
<b>Floyd</b> | something perhaps familiar about her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mind if I sit here, Miss?" he asked. She looked up from the map, and
<b>Floyd</b> | Johann at once recognized her as his sister, and wondered how in the
<b>Floyd</b> | world he hadn't known who she was earlier. She smiled to see him, but
<b>Floyd</b> | he thought he saw her wiping a tear from her eye as turned to put down
<b>Floyd</b> | his coat. Taking the seat opposite her, and looking for a moment at the
<b>Floyd</b> | near-total desolation outside the train, punctuated only by a few
<b>Floyd</b> | swimming blue lamps, he asked, "Where did you get that map?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "They gave it to me at the station, of course. Didn't they give you one
<b>Floyd</b> | too?" But Johann could not remember any station. In fact, he could not
<b>Floyd</b> | remember boarding the train at all.

<b>Floyd</b> | a story by Kazuki Mishima
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 2 / Serial number 110708 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> | Inspired by the life and work of Kenji Miyazawa.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Je tiu tago ni vidos kaj esperon kaj harmonion, kaj chu estos pli au
<b>Floyd</b> | malpli bela sunlevigho de tiu tago ol sunlevigho estas hodiau?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sophie actually enjoyed the festival every year. She enjoyed the
<b>Floyd</b> | lights, the songs, and the crispness of the air. It was only the crowds
<b>Floyd</b> | that made her uneasy and drove her into the solitude she had learned to
<b>Floyd</b> | appreciate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The River's Northern Bank
<b>Floyd</b> | There the river was at its widest, flowing with a stealthy swiftness.
<b>Floyd</b> | The only way back to the city was to the northwest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Painted lanterns undulated just barely within view.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She was surprised to see Franz there.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Franz had trouble catching his breaths in the mighty current. He and
<b>Floyd</b> | Sophie met in the water, and she tried to help him stay afloat, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | water began to overwhelm her. There was a tumbling, a scratching, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | stabilization. Somehow, they had landed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Crane Island, Western Shore
<b>Floyd</b> | This part of the island consisted mainly of smooth sedimentary rock,
<b>Floyd</b> | while she was on a small sandy bit of shore that connected to the east
<b>Floyd</b> | with a path guarded by an ancient spirit gate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The ancient spirit gate was closed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Painted lanterns undulated just barely within view.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sorry I made you come down to the river, Sophie," Franz said when
<b>Floyd</b> | he had finally stopped coughing up water. "I just wanted to catch one
<b>Floyd</b> | more painted lantern." Then he shuddered and once again adopted his

<b>Floyd</b> | II. Avery's Diary
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I am Avery Jones, and I am a schoolteacher.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 15 December 1921.
<b>Floyd</b> | Am working on a new story I'm calling "Johann's Ticket." Have sketched
<b>Floyd</b> | out the basic arc already, and am trying to round it out into something
<b>Floyd</b> | to send off to the city publishers again, though I suspect I'll just
<b>Floyd</b> | end up having a small run printed at my own expense, as I did with "One
<b>Floyd</b> | More Painted Lantern" and the poetry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Noticed today that it's been over a month since I started teaching.
<b>Floyd</b> | Think I may have developed a knack for it. Seems the trick is to pay
<b>Floyd</b> | textbooks only the very little attention they're due, and to keep the
<b>Floyd</b> | children excited. Mme S. didn't seem much too pleased with this method
<b>Floyd</b> | at first, but I seem to have won the children's admiration, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | respect of my superiors has gradually followed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Had a real shock today when Benjamin Harker became ill during rehearsal
<b>Floyd</b> | for the play. When I had sent for his parents, I started cleaning up,
<b>Floyd</b> | at which point I confirmed my suspicions that the Harker family has it
<b>Floyd</b> | bad enough that they're eating mostly kelp. This prompted me to at last
<b>Floyd</b> | discuss the possibility of an agronomics curriculum with Mme S. She
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't seem too adverse to the idea. Also convinced Mr. Harker to let
<b>Floyd</b> | me have a look at his soil.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Everyone seems to be catching the autumn sickness. Lately my coughing
<b>Floyd</b> | has been deeper and more difficult, and Lucy's begun coughing as well.
<b>Floyd</b> | Am doing my best to encourage hygiene among my pupils, but convincing
<b>Floyd</b> | any of them to show any concern for his own health is a struggle.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 27 November 1922.
<b>Floyd</b> | Went out for a walk today. Couldn't do anything else. I had walked all
<b>Floyd</b> | the way down to the creek before I even realized how far I'd gone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Back when it all started, when she coughed up blood for the first time,
<b>Floyd</b> | I'd gone there looking for a maple branch. "I want one full of sap,"
<b>Floyd</b> | she'd said, "and with icicles hanging down." I'd thought it selfish and
<b>Floyd</b> | frivolous of her to ask, when it seemed so necessary that I remain. It
<b>Floyd</b> | occurred to me only today that it was the most selfless thing she could
<b>Floyd</b> | have done -- to give me leave when I most needed it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This evening I thought, for a moment, that I had seen a bird. I
<b>Floyd</b> | thought, for a moment, that I was saved. But it was not a flurry of
<b>Floyd</b> | wings. It was only the dead falling of snow from the limb of an oak. It
<b>Floyd</b> | took some time to disinter my face from the wet folds of my
<b>Floyd</b> | handkerchief.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When I had finished a prayer for the repose of Lucy's soul, I observed
<b>Floyd</b> | the noise of the water's currents below. The wind ran its fingers
<b>Floyd</b> | through my hair. It was calling me home. The water was pulling me in.
<b>Floyd</b> | It was calling me to jump.

<b>Floyd</b> | Kenji (1896 - 1933) was a Japanese Nichiren Buddhist, naturalist,

<b>Floyd</b> | in relative obscurity in rural and destitute Hanamaki of Iwate province
<b>Floyd</b> | but gained great fame and admiration in Japan for his poetry and

<b>Floyd</b> | Kenji is Hiroaki Sato's Miyazawa Kenji: Selections, which contains a

<b>Floyd</b> | II. Avery's Diary
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I am Avery Jones, and I am a schoolteacher.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 15 December 1921.
<b>Floyd</b> | Am working on a new story I'm calling "Johann's Ticket." Have sketched
<b>Floyd</b> | out the basic arc already, and am trying to round it out into something
<b>Floyd</b> | to send off to the city publishers again, though I suspect I'll just
<b>Floyd</b> | end up having a small run printed at my own expense, as I did with "One
<b>Floyd</b> | More Painted Lantern" and the poetry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Noticed today that it's been over a month since I started teaching.
<b>Floyd</b> | Think I may have developed a knack for it. Seems the trick is to pay
<b>Floyd</b> | textbooks only the very little attention they're due, and to keep the
<b>Floyd</b> | children excited. Mme S. didn't seem much too pleased with this method
<b>Floyd</b> | at first, but I seem to have won the children's admiration, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | respect of my superiors has gradually followed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Had a real shock today when Benjamin Harker became ill during rehearsal
<b>Floyd</b> | for the play. When I had sent for his parents, I started cleaning up,
<b>Floyd</b> | at which point I confirmed my suspicions that the Harker family has it
<b>Floyd</b> | bad enough that they're eating mostly kelp. This prompted me to at last
<b>Floyd</b> | discuss the possibility of an agronomics curriculum with Mme S. She
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't seem too adverse to the idea. Also convinced Mr. Harker to let
<b>Floyd</b> | me have a look at his soil.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Everyone seems to be catching the autumn sickness. Lately my coughing
<b>Floyd</b> | has been deeper and more difficult, and Lucy's begun coughing as well.
<b>Floyd</b> | Am doing my best to encourage hygiene among my pupils, but convincing
<b>Floyd</b> | any of them to show any concern for his own health is a struggle.

<b>Floyd</b> | 21 September 1933.
<b>Floyd</b> | Am coughing up more blood than usual. Chills have set in harder. Some

<b>Floyd</b> | I am Avery Jones, and I am in despair.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 27 November 1922.
<b>Floyd</b> | Went out for a walk today. Couldn't do anything else. I had walked all
<b>Floyd</b> | the way down to the creek before I even realized how far I'd gone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Back when it all started, when she coughed up blood for the first time,
<b>Floyd</b> | I'd gone there looking for a maple branch. "I want one full of sap,"
<b>Floyd</b> | she'd said, "and with icicles hanging down." I'd thought it selfish and
<b>Floyd</b> | frivolous of her to ask, when it seemed so necessary that I remain. It
<b>Floyd</b> | occurred to me only today that it was the most selfless thing she could
<b>Floyd</b> | have done -- to give me leave when I most needed it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This evening I thought, for a moment, that I had seen a bird. I
<b>Floyd</b> | thought, for a moment, that I was saved. But it was not a flurry of
<b>Floyd</b> | wings. It was only the dead falling of snow from the limb of an oak. It
<b>Floyd</b> | took some time to disinter my face from the wet folds of my
<b>Floyd</b> | handkerchief.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When I had finished a prayer for the repose of Lucy's soul, I observed
<b>Floyd</b> | the noise of the water's currents below. The wind ran its fingers
<b>Floyd</b> | through my hair. It was calling me home. The water was pulling me in.
<b>Floyd</b> | It was calling me to jump.

<b>Floyd</b> | My Girlfriend's an Evil Bitch.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  I would like to start off by saying this game is not dedicated to
<b>Floyd</b> | anyone and there is no one in my life who serves as inspiration for the
<b>Floyd</b> | Colleen character.  Any similarity between her and anyone you know is
<b>Floyd</b> | not only an amazing coincidence but also should serve as a serious
<b>Floyd</b> | concern to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is my first attempt at making an interactive fiction, or a story
<b>Floyd</b> | of any kind.  I have focused on making the game challenging, funny, and
<b>Floyd</b> | free of bugs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This focus may have the cost of some descriptive narratives.
<b>Floyd</b> | Personally, though, when I play IF I'm a little annoyed at too much
<b>Floyd</b> | description and it makes me wonder which parts are actually things I
<b>Floyd</b> | should pay attention to and which are just there to set the mood.
<b>Floyd</b> | Therefore, I have chosen to keep the descriptions in this game short
<b>Floyd</b> | and simple giving you just about as much as you need to develop as much
<b>Floyd</b> | of a picture of the scene as is required to understand the story and to
<b>Floyd</b> | solve the puzzles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you find any mistakes, typos, or you're just so stuck that it's not
<b>Floyd</b> | even fun anymore please let me know, divarin@yahoo.com, and I will
<b>Floyd</b> | certainly help you out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The unique concepts of this game (although other games may have used
<b>Floyd</b> | these as well) are:
<b>Floyd</b> |  * Crafting (combining items to form other items)
<b>Floyd</b> |  * Buying and selling
<b>Floyd</b> |  * Survival (the need to get and consume food and drink)
<b>Floyd</b> |  * Out of game clues (optional puzzles)
<b>Floyd</b> |  and whatever else I feel like throwing in later.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My one word of advice to players, take time to buy and read the books
<b>Floyd</b> | in the bookstore.  They contain valuable information that will help you
<b>Floyd</b> | solve the puzzles.  Plus the lady at the pawn shop will buy them, but
<b>Floyd</b> | you won't make a profit off of them.

<b>Floyd</b> | "You Are Screwed Insurance" because they spend a large part of their
<b>Floyd</b> | profits on lawyers to find creative ways to not pay on claims).  This
<b>Floyd</b> | is Colleen's employer but she isn't here at the moment and besides it's
<b>Floyd</b> | the weekend and they're closed.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  It can take a long time to make a good shelter.  Afterwards you will
<b>Floyd</b> | want to make a fire and that will take time as well.  If you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | think you have enough time to pull it off, you should try to find a
<b>Floyd</b> | ready-made shelter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Quick and dirty shelters include: A cave, a hole (if you have a shovel
<b>Floyd</b> | you can make one) it's not pretty but it will keep the wind off of you,
<b>Floyd</b> | pointless in the rain though, or a hollowed out tree (as good as a
<b>Floyd</b> | cave, but smaller).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  If you are ready to try to make a shelter you will need some
<b>Floyd</b> | materials.  Aside from a roof to keep rain off of you, you should
<b>Floyd</b> | consider what you will sleep on.  You will want some place dry, and to
<b>Floyd</b> | make it difficult for insects to get to you.  Some boards raised up by
<b>Floyd</b> | some stones might do the trick, although some creepy crawlies will
<b>Floyd</b> | manage to get up the stones and around the boards it at least makes it
<b>Floyd</b> | diffcult.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Flying insects can be kept at bay by the smoke of a nearby campfire
<b>Floyd</b> | just outside of your sleeping area, which you'll want to have anyway
<b>Floyd</b> | for your own warmth.  See Chapter Three for information about fires.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  The simpliest shelter is made by using a low-hanging tree branch as
<b>Floyd</b> | the roof support and leaning logs against it.  Then fasten the tarp or
<b>Floyd</b> | other covering to those logs.  If you don't have any covering you can
<b>Floyd</b> | use branches from pine trees, cut them off with a knife and tie each
<b>Floyd</b> | branch to your logs.

<b>Floyd</b> |  There are discusting mushrooms (which is the kind you get at the local

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  In the event that you *think* that you've eaten poisonous mushrooms,

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Chapter Three - Fires
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  To start a fire you will need many different types of burning material
<b>Floyd</b> | and an ignition source.  You will need to be in a relativly calm
<b>Floyd</b> | environment (away from winds and rain) and you will need patience.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  To get started you need to set aside an area where the fire will burn,
<b>Floyd</b> | this is called the firepit.  To do this simply MAKE FIREPIT, then it's
<b>Floyd</b> | just a matter of putting the right kinds of things into the pit, and
<b>Floyd</b> | then igniting it somehow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  There are 3 main types of material you will need; tinder, kindling,
<b>Floyd</b> | and logs.  Tinder refers to a very light, very flamable material that
<b>Floyd</b> | usually burns up very quickly.  This could be as simple as pocket lint.
<b>Floyd</b> | Or, you can create tinder by using a knife on wood to create wood
<b>Floyd</b> | shavings.  Kindling refers to small twigs which burn fairly easily once
<b>Floyd</b> | exposed to a fire, but are difficult to ignite on their own.  And logs
<b>Floyd</b> | can refer to any size log from 1/2 inch diameter up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  All material will need to be completely dry.  You will not be able to
<b>Floyd</b> | get wood from a freshly cut tree to burn easily.  Such wood will only
<b>Floyd</b> | burn once a hot fire has evaporated all the water from within it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Your ignition source would be, ideally, a cigarette lighter or some
<b>Floyd</b> | matches.  Failing that there are a plethora of other means of starting
<b>Floyd</b> | fires.  These include: Sunlight magnification, sparks from flint &
<b>Floyd</b> | steel, and friction from rubbing dry wood together.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  To use sunlight magnification, use a lens (such as from eyeglasses) to
<b>Floyd</b> | focus the sun's light onto your tinder.  Make the "dot" as tiny as
<b>Floyd</b> | possible.  Once the tinder starts to burn quickly deposit it under your
<b>Floyd</b> | stacked up kindling.  Blowing on it gently might help it ignite.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Flint combined with Steel can produce sparks which can ignite tinder.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you have something made of steel and a flint stone you can COMBINE
<b>Floyd</b> | those two which will give you a decent fire starter.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Chapter Four - Rescue
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Rescue depends on one simple principal: You coming on contact with
<b>Floyd</b> | others!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  This can be achieved in one of two ways, and it is best to try both as
<b>Floyd</b> | much as possible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  First, try to make yourself visible as much as possible.  Try
<b>Floyd</b> | arranging rocks in the form of an arrow in the direction of your
<b>Floyd</b> | travel.  This will not only help others find you but should keep you
<b>Floyd</b> | from running around in circles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Keeping a fire going is essential, fires produce smoke and smoke may
<b>Floyd</b> | be the only sign of your existance that's visible over the tree-line.
<b>Floyd</b> | A smokey fire will greatly enhance your odds of being rescued.  Once
<b>Floyd</b> | you have a fire going put some smoldering material on the fire, such as
<b>Floyd</b> | dry leaves, which don't burn well but do cause a lot of smoke.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Of course, it would be ideal if you could simply talk to civilization.
<b>Floyd</b> | Cell phones are usually not useable in remote areas however shortwave
<b>Floyd</b> | radios may be helpful.  Small portable radios may not transmit very
<b>Floyd</b> | far, especially when their batteries are weak or they have ineffective
<b>Floyd</b> | antennas.  But there are things you can do to increase the transmition
<b>Floyd</b> | radius: If you could break open such a radio and solder on some other
<b>Floyd</b> | kind of antenna (such as a copper wire) to the antenna leads then
<b>Floyd</b> | perhaps you could make yourself heard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Doing these things will increase your chances of being seen but they
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't a guarantee.  You should try to find civilization rather than
<b>Floyd</b> | simply waiting to be rescued.  If you see a source of water, follow it,
<b>Floyd</b> | towns and cities are always formed along rivers and small mountain
<b>Floyd</b> | streams often flow into rivers.  Certainly if you see any power lines
<b>Floyd</b> | then following them is a good bet, however they can go on for many
<b>Floyd</b> | miles without entering a town.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  When foraging for food it is important to consider that there are
<b>Floyd</b> | three kinds of mushrooms:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  There are discusting mushrooms (which is the kind you get at the local
<b>Floyd</b> | supermarket), there are poisonous mushrooms which will either make your
<b>Floyd</b> | life a living hell for a few days or kill you (or both), and there are
<b>Floyd</b> | psychadelic (magic) mushrooms which will make you think you've
<b>Floyd</b> | accidently eaten poisonous mushrooms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  In the event that you *think* that you've eaten poisonous mushrooms,
<b>Floyd</b> | you should change your thought pattern to assume that you have eaten
<b>Floyd</b> | magic mushrooms.  This will keep you from having a bad trip and maybe
<b>Floyd</b> | you'll even be given a vision or something, who knows.  If it turns out
<b>Floyd</b> | that they were poisonous, there really isn't much you could have done
<b>Floyd</b> | about it anyway being stranded out in the middle of nowhere on your

<b>Floyd</b> |

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Chapter Three - Fires
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  To start a fire you will need many different types of burning material
<b>Floyd</b> | and an ignition source.  You will need to be in a relativly calm
<b>Floyd</b> | environment (away from winds and rain) and you will need patience.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  To get started you need to set aside an area where the fire will burn,
<b>Floyd</b> | this is called the firepit.  To do this simply MAKE FIREPIT, then it's
<b>Floyd</b> | just a matter of putting the right kinds of things into the pit, and
<b>Floyd</b> | then igniting it somehow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  There are 3 main types of material you will need; tinder, kindling,
<b>Floyd</b> | and logs.  Tinder refers to a very light, very flamable material that
<b>Floyd</b> | usually burns up very quickly.  This could be as simple as pocket lint.
<b>Floyd</b> | Or, you can create tinder by using a knife on wood to create wood
<b>Floyd</b> | shavings.  Kindling refers to small twigs which burn fairly easily once
<b>Floyd</b> | exposed to a fire, but are difficult to ignite on their own.  And logs
<b>Floyd</b> | can refer to any size log from 1/2 inch diameter up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  All material will need to be completely dry.  You will not be able to
<b>Floyd</b> | get wood from a freshly cut tree to burn easily.  Such wood will only
<b>Floyd</b> | burn once a hot fire has evaporated all the water from within it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Your ignition source would be, ideally, a cigarette lighter or some
<b>Floyd</b> | matches.  Failing that there are a plethora of other means of starting
<b>Floyd</b> | fires.  These include: Sunlight magnification, sparks from flint &
<b>Floyd</b> | steel, and friction from rubbing dry wood together.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  To use sunlight magnification, use a lens (such as from eyeglasses) to
<b>Floyd</b> | focus the sun's light onto your tinder.  Make the "dot" as tiny as
<b>Floyd</b> | possible.  Once the tinder starts to burn quickly deposit it under your
<b>Floyd</b> | stacked up kindling.  Blowing on it gently might help it ignite.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Flint combined with Steel can produce sparks which can ignite tinder.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you have something made of steel and a flint stone you can COMBINE
<b>Floyd</b> | those two which will give you a decent fire starter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the radio:
<b>Floyd</b> | MAXSTED: No I have no relatives who suffer from a cataleptic illness.

<b>Floyd</b> |  MAXSTED: Well I can't help you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the radio:
<b>Floyd</b> | JOE: What now? Do I go along to the police and say, Look I stole a

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Chapter One - Shelters
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  It can take a long time to make a good shelter.  Afterwards you will
<b>Floyd</b> | want to make a fire and that will take time as well.  If you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | think you have enough time to pull it off, you should try to find a
<b>Floyd</b> | ready-made shelter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Quick and dirty shelters include: A cave, a hole (if you have a shovel
<b>Floyd</b> | you can make one) it's not pretty but it will keep the wind off of you,
<b>Floyd</b> | pointless in the rain though, or a hollowed out tree (as good as a
<b>Floyd</b> | cave, but smaller).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  If you are ready to try to make a shelter you will need some
<b>Floyd</b> | materials.  Aside from a roof to keep rain off of you, you should
<b>Floyd</b> | consider what you will sleep on.  You will want some place dry, and to
<b>Floyd</b> | make it difficult for insects to get to you.  Some boards raised up by
<b>Floyd</b> | some stones might do the trick, although some creepy crawlies will
<b>Floyd</b> | manage to get up the stones and around the boards it at least makes it
<b>Floyd</b> | diffcult.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Flying insects can be kept at bay by the smoke of a nearby campfire
<b>Floyd</b> | just outside of your sleeping area, which you'll want to have anyway
<b>Floyd</b> | for your own warmth.  See Chapter Three for information about fires.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  The simpliest shelter is made by using a low-hanging tree branch as
<b>Floyd</b> | the roof support and leaning logs against it.  Then fasten the tarp or
<b>Floyd</b> | other covering to those logs.  If you don't have any covering you can
<b>Floyd</b> | use branches from pine trees, cut them off with a knife and tie each
<b>Floyd</b> | branch to your logs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the radio:
<b>Floyd</b> | JOE: Give me ten bob. Do you have any change? I need some silver. I
<b>Floyd</b> | have to telephone. I won't be long.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Chapter Four - Rescue
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Rescue depends on one simple principal: You coming on contact with
<b>Floyd</b> | others!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  This can be achieved in one of two ways, and it is best to try both as
<b>Floyd</b> | much as possible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  First, try to make yourself visible as much as possible.  Try
<b>Floyd</b> | arranging rocks in the form of an arrow in the direction of your
<b>Floyd</b> | travel.  This will not only help others find you but should keep you
<b>Floyd</b> | from running around in circles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Keeping a fire going is essential, fires produce smoke and smoke may
<b>Floyd</b> | be the only sign of your existance that's visible over the tree-line.
<b>Floyd</b> | A smokey fire will greatly enhance your odds of being rescued.  Once
<b>Floyd</b> | you have a fire going put some smoldering material on the fire, such as
<b>Floyd</b> | dry leaves, which don't burn well but do cause a lot of smoke.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Of course, it would be ideal if you could simply talk to civilization.
<b>Floyd</b> | Cell phones are usually not useable in remote areas however shortwave
<b>Floyd</b> | radios may be helpful.  Small portable radios may not transmit very
<b>Floyd</b> | far, especially when their batteries are weak or they have ineffective
<b>Floyd</b> | antennas.  But there are things you can do to increase the transmition
<b>Floyd</b> | radius: If you could break open such a radio and solder on some other
<b>Floyd</b> | kind of antenna (such as a copper wire) to the antenna leads then
<b>Floyd</b> | perhaps you could make yourself heard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Doing these things will increase your chances of being seen but they
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't a guarantee.  You should try to find civilization rather than
<b>Floyd</b> | simply waiting to be rescued.  If you see a source of water, follow it,
<b>Floyd</b> | towns and cities are always formed along rivers and small mountain
<b>Floyd</b> | streams often flow into rivers.  Certainly if you see any power lines
<b>Floyd</b> | then following them is a good bet, however they can go on for many
<b>Floyd</b> | miles without entering a town.

<b>Floyd</b> | You have climbed Mt. Everest.  It is tall enough to see over the young

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  You can get off the hill by going north or south.  It appears that

<b>Floyd</b> |  In the continuing saga of Mr. Kramer, the motorist now believed to
<b>Floyd</b> | have died in the horrific bridge collapse during the recent flash
<b>Floyd</b> | floods, we have had the great fortune to speak one-on-one in an
<b>Floyd</b> | exclusive interview with his widow, young Marla Kramer.  Marla and Jeff
<b>Floyd</b> | have been a couple for only a few months but, as Mrs. Kramer states,
<b>Floyd</b> | they were inseparable.  Choking back tears Mrs. Kramer has thanked the
<b>Floyd</b> | community for their support during this emotional ordeal but would like
<b>Floyd</b> | to assure everyone that she will be okay, financially, and does not
<b>Floyd</b> | require any aid.  Mr. Kramer had purchased a life insurance policy from
<b>Floyd</b> | URS Insurance for some $500,000 which Marla will receive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  The search for Jeffery's body has been called off as the lead (infact
<b>Floyd</b> | only) member of the search and rescue team, Cpt. Hornblow, has assured
<b>Floyd</b> | the community that he has personally explored the area thoroughly and
<b>Floyd</b> | there is no trace that Jeffery, or anyone else, has been there.  It is
<b>Floyd</b> | believed that he may have fallen from a cliff near where his car was
<b>Floyd</b> | found.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  (A photo of the widow choking back tears is in the margins.  Although
<b>Floyd</b> | only someone who knows her intimately would recognize this, the widow
<b>Floyd</b> | is clearly Colleen in disguise.  It is also interesting to note that
<b>Floyd</b> | Hornblow has never once searched for, or rescued anyone.)

<b>Floyd</b> | Beach
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a beach along the bay.  To the north you can see the cliff
<b>Floyd</b> | which you were trapped on and the small brook falling off of it down
<b>Floyd</b> | into this bay.  The beach is rocky to the north and south but this area
<b>Floyd</b> | has been kept clear of stones and is sandy enough to be comfortable to
<b>Floyd</b> | run around on without shoes (although this isn't the season for that).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  There are circles of stones out in the water which are underwater
<b>Floyd</b> | during high-tide and exposed during low-tide.  It appears that they use
<b>Floyd</b> | this as an easy way to fish, fish get trapped in the circles when the
<b>Floyd</b> | tide goes out, they come out and take what they need, then the tide
<b>Floyd</b> | comes back and the remainder of the fish are free to go.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You see Julieanne out in one of the stone circles collecting fish.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | bottom of her white dress is soaking wet from the water.  Even though
<b>Floyd</b> | it is an unusually warm day, in this season that water must be pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | cold.  Yet, somehow, Julieanne seems unaffected by it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  There is definately a beauty and simplicity here which you find

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  A path leads up to the east toward the commune center.  You can see

<b>Floyd</b> | This is a beach along the bay.  To the north you can see the cliff

<b>Floyd</b> | has been kept clear of stones and is sandy enough to be comfortable to
<b>Floyd</b> | run around on without shoes (although this isn't the season for that).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  There are circles of stones out in the water which are underwater
<b>Floyd</b> | during high-tide and exposed during low-tide.  It appears that they use
<b>Floyd</b> | this as an easy way to fish, fish get trapped in the circles when the
<b>Floyd</b> | tide goes out, they come out and take what they need, then the tide
<b>Floyd</b> | comes back and the remainder of the fish are free to go.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You see Julieanne out in one of the stone circles collecting fish.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | bottom of her white dress is soaking wet from the water.  Even though
<b>Floyd</b> | it is an unusually warm day, in this season that water must be pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | cold.  Yet, somehow, Julieanne seems unaffected by it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  There is definately a beauty and simplicity here which you find

<b>Floyd</b> | The Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a sparse dining room with parque flooring. The kitchen is to
<b>Floyd</b> | the east and to the north is the living room. The table is circa 1950
<b>Floyd</b> | with a strange black and white checkerboard pattern. On the table sits
<b>Floyd</b> | a small Bonzai tree, looking longingly out the west facing window.

<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | The kitchen sports the usual kitchiny things, and a counter which

<b>Floyd</b> | door south of here leads out to the car port. There is a pile of junk
<b>Floyd</b> | mail on the counter. The French door is open.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Car Port
<b>Floyd</b> |  This is the car port.  To the east is the back yard.  The drive way
<b>Floyd</b> | extends west toward the street. The door into your house is to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north. Hanging from the ceiling (which extends beyond the house and
<b>Floyd</b> | over the car port) is a thermometer. A trash can is here, opened. The

<b>Floyd</b> | Maple Drive
<b>Floyd</b> | This is Maple Drive.  This large avenue was designed to serve a large
<b>Floyd</b> | commercial district.  The construction on Maple ended prematurely not
<b>Floyd</b> | long after it started, to the west is a long and winding gravel road
<b>Floyd</b> | that seems to stretch on into infinity
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Along Maple five businesses were constructed, all but one went under
<b>Floyd</b> | either before their construction completed or soon after.  The only
<b>Floyd</b> | remaining business is "URS Insurance" (which the locals say stands for
<b>Floyd</b> | "You Are Screwed Insurance" because they spend a large part of their
<b>Floyd</b> | profits on lawyers to find creative ways to not pay on claims).  This
<b>Floyd</b> | is Colleen's employer but she isn't here at the moment and besides it's
<b>Floyd</b> | the weekend and they're closed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | URS Insurance's entrance is to the south.

<b>Floyd</b> | The public house, or The Pub, is a large wood cabin with a large open
<b>Floyd</b> | stone fireplace in the center.  A chimney vents the fire's smoke up
<b>Floyd</b> | through the ceiling.  There are various tables, benches, sofas, and
<b>Floyd</b> | bean-bags.  It appears that a lot of socializing goes on here as most
<b>Floyd</b> | of the seating is faced in toward each other in groups of about 8 or 9.
<b>Floyd</b> | There are various books in shelves along the walls while a wide array
<b>Floyd</b> | of musical instruments are strewn about.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  There is a long bench along one wall. Julieanne's elderly grandfather,
<b>Floyd</b> | Billy is here. Julieanne, the love of your life, smiles at you.
