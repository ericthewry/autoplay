NightFloyd Transcript:<BR><B><I>The Multi-Dimensional Thief</I> by Joel Finch</b></FONT><FONT FACE='arial, sans-serif, helvetica' SIZE='1'></BR>As played on ifMUD on August 31, 2011</FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</BR></BR>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often (but not always) takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions.  NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does.  NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.</BR></BR>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Multi-Dimensional Thief</i>, written by Joel Finch.  <I>The Multi-Dimensional Thief</I> was released in 1991 as shareware and received first place in the Softworks AGT Contest that year  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.wurb.com/if/game/136'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br>Of particularly special note, this historic transcript marks the first time that NightFloyd ever officially met.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | ======================================================================
<b>Floyd</b> | =========
<b>Floyd</b> |   Here's the plot: You are a thief; an exceptionally good one.
<b>Floyd</b> | Naturally, you
<b>Floyd</b> | aspire to join the largest and most prestigious of organised thieving
<b>Floyd</b> | bodies,
<b>Floyd</b> | the Multi-Dimensional Thieves' Guild. One day you are approached by a
<b>Floyd</b> | tall man
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing a long cloak. His face is hidden in the folds of the hood and
<b>Floyd</b> | his voice
<b>Floyd</b> | is deliberately muffled. Making no introductions, he tells you that
<b>Floyd</b> | your recent
<b>Floyd</b> | activities have been monitored with interest, and offers you a
<b>Floyd</b> | provisional
<b>Floyd</b> | membership in the M-D.T.G. All you have to do is pass a simple test.
<b>Floyd</b> | Since this
<b>Floyd</b> | is a childhood dream come true, you eagerly accept.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The test goes like this; you begin in a specially prepared set of
<b>Floyd</b> | rooms, and your only objective is to get out of them. Your prowess as
<b>Floyd</b> | a thief is not in question, however there are other talents to be
<b>Floyd</b> | tested. The rooms are pieces "borrowed" from other universes and
<b>Floyd</b> | magically spliced together to test your ability to deal with rapid
<b>Floyd</b> | changes of scenery, a prerequisite for any work in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Multi-Dimensional Thieves' Guild. A number of useful items have been
<b>Floyd</b> | added to the rooms, to make your test just that much more interesting.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |   Oh, and one more thing. Here's a few basic clues: examine everything
<b>Floyd</b> | you
<b>Floyd</b> | find, read most things, and, above all, think symmetrically. Good
<b>Floyd</b> | luck!

<b>Floyd</b> |   Here's the plot: You are a thief; an exceptionally good one.
<b>Floyd</b> | Naturally, you
<b>Floyd</b> | aspire to join the largest and most prestigious of organised thieving
<b>Floyd</b> | bodies,
<b>Floyd</b> | the Multi-Dimensional Thieves' Guild. One day you are approached by a
<b>Floyd</b> | tall man
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing a long cloak. His face is hidden in the folds of the hood and
<b>Floyd</b> | his voice
<b>Floyd</b> | is deliberately muffled. Making no introductions, he tells you that
<b>Floyd</b> | your recent
<b>Floyd</b> | activities have been monitored with interest, and offers you a
<b>Floyd</b> | provisional
<b>Floyd</b> | membership in the M-D.T.G. All you have to do is pass a simple test.
<b>Floyd</b> | Since this
<b>Floyd</b> | is a childhood dream come true, you eagerly accept.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The test goes like this; you begin in a specially prepared set of
<b>Floyd</b> | rooms, and your only objective is to get out of them. Your prowess as
<b>Floyd</b> | a thief is not in question, however there are other talents to be
<b>Floyd</b> | tested. The rooms are pieces "borrowed" from other universes and
<b>Floyd</b> | magically spliced together to test your ability to deal with rapid
<b>Floyd</b> | changes of scenery, a prerequisite for any work in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Multi-Dimensional Thieves' Guild. A number of useful items have been
<b>Floyd</b> | added to the rooms, to make your test just that much more interesting.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |   Oh, and one more thing. Here's a few basic clues: examine everything
<b>Floyd</b> | you
<b>Floyd</b> | find, read most things, and, above all, think symmetrically. Good
<b>Floyd</b> | luck!

<b>Floyd</b> | The painting depicts a typical farmyard setting, with a quaint old
<b>Floyd</b> | farm house, and a large red barn in the left of the scene. A tiny,
<b>Floyd</b> | ominous tornado is shown in the distant background, approaching the
<b>Floyd</b> | farm. The artist has done a truly remarkable job; the painting looks
<b>Floyd</b> | so lifelike that it's almost as if you could step right into it.

<b>Floyd</b> | Aquarium
<b>Floyd</b> | In the centre of the room is a large fishtank, so named because of the
<b>Floyd</b> | many little fishies currently swimming in it. It occupies most of the
<b>Floyd</b> | room, and appears to rate at "hernia" in weight. There is a doorway to
<b>Floyd</b> | the west.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You note that the tank is completely sealed.
<b>Floyd</b> |    There is a portable hole here.
