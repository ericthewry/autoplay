						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Foo Foo</em> written by Buster Hudson.
						 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

<b>Floyd</b> |           Little bunny Foo Foo went hopping through the forest,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You piece the evening back together. A late day at work, a rainy

<b>Floyd</b> | By morning, the summer sun is busy hiding the evidence of the previous

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good, you're here," he says. That's your name. Good Fairy, Senior
<b>Floyd</b> | Detective. Though it's good that you're here, too. Makes for awkward
<b>Floyd</b> | moments when your arrival is not so good.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We got an anonymous tip that Foo Foo's hiding in this part of
<b>Floyd</b> | Fieldtown," Murphy continues before popping in a few more sticks of
<b>Floyd</b> | chewing gum. He's the kind of rookie who chews more gum than he can
<b>Floyd</b> | handle, and no, that's not just an expression. There's way too much
<b>Floyd</b> | gum in his mouth right now.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Fe schreet'sh a dead end, an fere'sh no way he'sh gettin by me an Big

<b>Floyd</b> | Returning to the subterranean chamber, you find the albino rattlesnake
<b>Floyd</b> | now docile, coiled up the corner. Sabado looks worn down, but still
<b>Floyd</b> | grumpy. They speak to each other in hushed tones. You hear the words
<b>Floyd</b> | "trespassed illegally".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sometimes the best defense is a good offense. You work yourself up
<b>Floyd</b> | into a mock rage. "Just what in Gaia's name is going on down here?"
<b>Floyd</b> | you shout, stomping across the stone floor, waving a fist in the air.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The snake shrinks away apologetically. Sabado isn't as easily cowed,
<b>Floyd</b> | but he decides to play nice. "Detective, I'd like you to meet my
<b>Floyd</b> | business associate, Mr. Sistrum. Mr. Sistrum, Detective Good Fairy."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pleassse, call me Hannibal," the snake says. He bows slightly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Forgive me if I forget my manners," you say. "It sometimes happens
<b>Floyd</b> | when I'm almost crushed to death."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hannibal suffers from allergies," says Sabado. "His most severe being
<b>Floyd</b> | wish powder. Even being in the same room is enough to send him into a
<b>Floyd</b> | fit." He thrusts a finger at you. "And it was your dirty,
<b>Floyd</b> | powder-covered trick which caused this latest attack."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hannibal rests his rattle on the rat's shoulder. "Peace, friend. She
<b>Floyd</b> | couldn't have known about my allergy."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I want to know why she tried to fool us in the first place," Sabado

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Every Tuesday is scavenger night," he says with a resigned huff. "All

<b>Floyd</b> | weren't the field mice."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Then what happened to the field mice?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now he's angry. "I don't know what you want me to say. They packed up

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hannibal grins and settles back into his coils. "For the record, I

<b>Floyd</b> | "But you're soaking wet!" You stand over him. Anger swells. Yes, you
<b>Floyd</b> | were betrayed. Yes, you were fooled. But surely not to this degree.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Foo Foo lowers his eyes and sags to the floor. "I have a heart, you
<b>Floyd</b> | know. She made one out of red felt and filled it with wish powder.
<b>Floyd</b> | Simple, yet effective. Makes you wonder why no one thought of it
<b>Floyd</b> | before. Anyway, it's almost all used up."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1) No. You can't believe it.
