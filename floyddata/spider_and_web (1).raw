The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Spider and Web</i>, written by Andrew&nbsp;Plotkin.  <i>Spider and Web</i> was originally released in 1998. It was nominated for nine Xyzzy awards (everything but Best NPCs).  It ultimately took a total of five Xyzzies (for Best Game, Best Puzzles, Best Individual NPC, Best Individual Puzzle, and Best Use of Medium).  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Spider_And_Web"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</BR></BR>The game was played during two sessions: the first was on September 28, 2008, and the second (we finished the game at the request of someone who was sad to see the transcript end prematurely) was on January 18, 2009.  You can skip straight to the second session by clicking [<a href="#jan">HERE</A>].  </br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and
<b>Floyd</b> | grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The

<b>Floyd</b> | mountains were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is
<b>Floyd</b> | crusted with squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still
<b>Floyd</b> | flashes of its historic charm. You've seen spires above the streets --

<b>Floyd</b> | tiny green parks below tenements -- hidden jewels of fountains beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | walls. Any bland alley can conceal balconies wrought into iron gardens,
<b>Floyd</b> | fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers nurtured by who knows who.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty
<b>Floyd</b> | brick, and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the

<b>Floyd</b> | courtesy of a handle. Maybe you should call it a day.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For acknowledgements and credits, please type "credits".

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An introductory note: To simplify the problem of dialogue in

<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction, the "tell" and "ask" commands are not used in this
<b>Floyd</b> | game. Your conversational options are limited to "yes," "no," and
<b>Floyd</b> | saying nothing at all. Trust me -- this isn't as big a deal as it
<b>Floyd</b> | sounds.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Also, after some consideration, I have decided not to implement body

<b>Floyd</b> | parts -- head, arms, legs, hands -- as separate objects. If you feel a
<b>Floyd</b> | desire to refer to yourself, "me" will suffice.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is possible to make a fatal mistake in this game, but you will

<b>Floyd</b> | immediately know you have done so. You can always "undo" after death,
<b>Floyd</b> | and then fix the mistake. Therefore, the game is best played straight

<b>Floyd</b> | through. Accept any non-fatal mistakes that you may make; you will have
<b>Floyd</b> | a second chance. If you back up and replay each scene for maximum
<b>Floyd</b> | efficiency, avoiding all mistakes, certain aspects of the game will be
<b>Floyd</b> | lost.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However -- you will eventually reach a point where things become

<b>Floyd</b> | dangerous. You'll know when. Beyond that, you're playing for keeps and
<b>Floyd</b> | heartbeats count. Save early and often.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do not expect Spider And Web to be anything like So Far or A Change in

<b>Floyd</b> | the Weather. It's not. In a certain sense, this is my first
<b>Floyd</b> | conventional game. In another sense, it's the strangest game I know,

<b>Floyd</b> | and understanding what's happening is entirely your problem.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is free. But if you feel like sending me money, I won't
<b>Floyd</b> | refuse. If you feel like sending me comments or bug reports, I'll be

<b>Floyd</b> | ecstatic. As of the beginning of 1998, I am at

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An introductory note: To simplify the problem of dialogue in

<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction, the "tell" and "ask" commands are not used in this

<b>Floyd</b> | game. Your conversational options are limited to "yes," "no," and
<b>Floyd</b> | saying nothing at all. Trust me -- this isn't as big a deal as it
<b>Floyd</b> | sounds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Also, after some consideration, I have decided not to implement body

<b>Floyd</b> | parts -- head, arms, legs, hands -- as separate objects. If you feel a

<b>Floyd</b> | desire to refer to yourself, "me" will suffice.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is possible to make a fatal mistake in this game, but you will
<b>Floyd</b> | immediately know you have done so. You can always "undo" after death,
<b>Floyd</b> | and then fix the mistake. Therefore, the game is best played straight

<b>Floyd</b> | through. Accept any non-fatal mistakes that you may make; you will have

<b>Floyd</b> | a second chance. If you back up and replay each scene for maximum
<b>Floyd</b> | efficiency, avoiding all mistakes, certain aspects of the game will be
<b>Floyd</b> | lost.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However -- you will eventually reach a point where things become

<b>Floyd</b> | dangerous. You'll know when. Beyond that, you're playing for keeps and

<b>Floyd</b> | heartbeats count. Save early and often.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do not expect Spider And Web to be anything like So Far or A Change in
<b>Floyd</b> | the Weather. It's not. In a certain sense, this is my first
<b>Floyd</b> | conventional game. In another sense, it's the strangest game I know,

<b>Floyd</b> | and understanding what's happening is entirely your problem.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is free. But if you feel like sending me money, I won't
<b>Floyd</b> | refuse. If you feel like sending me comments or bug reports, I'll be
<b>Floyd</b> | ecstatic. As of the beginning of 1998, I am at

<b>Floyd</b> | On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and

<b>Floyd</b> | mountains were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is
<b>Floyd</b> | crusted with squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still
<b>Floyd</b> | flashes of its historic charm. You've seen spires above the streets --
<b>Floyd</b> | tiny green parks below tenements -- hidden jewels of fountains beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | walls. Any bland alley can conceal balconies wrought into iron

<b>Floyd</b> | gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers nurtured by who knows
<b>Floyd</b> | who.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty
<b>Floyd</b> | brick, and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the

<b>Floyd</b> | panel beside it.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | At the center of the chaos, and its focus, is a great silver platform
<b>Floyd</b> | which is wrapped in a glittering cage of scan-web. A control console
<b>Floyd</b> | stands next to it. Cables run out across the floor, from the platform
<b>Floyd</b> | to the console, from the console to the walls, and tangle around a low
<b>Floyd</b> | cabinet off to one side.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Much paper and clutter rests on a long wooden table against one wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The table also supports a notably large black device. By the other

<b>Floyd</b> | it. A steel cube sits on the mat.
