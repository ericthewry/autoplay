The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>To Hell in a Hamper</i>, written by J. J. Guest.  <I>To Hell in a Hamper</I> was originally released as part of the ADRIFT Spring Comp 2003, where it took first place. It went on to win first place in the ADRIFT End of Year Comp 2003, as well as Best Game, Most Unusual Setting/Plot, and Best Small Game in the InsideADRIFT Awards 2003. <I>To Hell in a Hamper</I> also went on to be nominated for Best Game, Best Writing, Best Story, Best Setting, and Best use of Medium Xyzzy Awards.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From the log of Professor Pettibone, eminent Victorian Balloonist:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Twenty-fourth of February, 1876.  The English Channel.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Our Journey begins!  A large crowd gathered this morning in Berkeley
<b>Floyd</b> | Square as we made our final preparations for what is to be one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | most daring expeditions ever undertaken; a journey around the world by
<b>Floyd</b> | balloon.  Our vessel, which I have christened Titania, consists of a
<b>Floyd</b> | strong wicker basket borne aloft by a sealed balloon containing 30,000
<b>Floyd</b> | cubic feet of hydrogen, an amount which, according to my calculations,
<b>Floyd</b> | should be quite sufficient to carry myself, Mr.  Booby and all of our
<b>Floyd</b> | supplies and equipment.  Mr.  Booby is travelling with me as a
<b>Floyd</b> | last-minute replacement for Doctor Cox, who was suddenly taken ill
<b>Floyd</b> | with a serious case of the dreaded badly-bruised knees just days
<b>Floyd</b> | before the launch.  Dressed in a huge, shapeless overcoat, he cuts
<b>Floyd</b> | rather a strange figure, but I am confident that he will prove to be
<b>Floyd</b> | as good company as his predecessor, and as competent an aeronaut as he
<b>Floyd</b> | claims.  At eleven o'clock, amid cries of "Huzzah!"  I cut the ropes
<b>Floyd</b> | binding the balloon to the earth and we soared aloft on the first leg
<b>Floyd</b> | of our journey...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fourteenth of September, 1876.  Fujian province, China.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I began to have my doubts about Mr.  Booby almost as soon as the
<b>Floyd</b> | balloon had made its ascent from Berkeley Square.  The instant we left
<b>Floyd</b> | the earth, Mr.  Booby got into such convulsions of nausea that I began
<b>Floyd</b> | to doubt his credentials as a balloonist, and as a suitable
<b>Floyd</b> | replacement for poor Dr.  Cox, who was suddenly taken ill just days
<b>Floyd</b> | before our take-off.  Though I have expressed to him many times the
<b>Floyd</b> | importance of keeping the weight of the balloon down to a minimum, I
<b>Floyd</b> | am beginning to suspect that Mr.  Booby has, against my wishes, been
<b>Floyd</b> | smuggling souvenirs of our journey into the balloon under that great
<b>Floyd</b> | coat of his.  Only this morning I caught sight of him in a
<b>Floyd</b> | marketplace, haggling over the price of a particularly ugly vase.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | was not exactly a small man even before we set out, and he seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | grow larger and larger as our journey progresses.  There is something
<b>Floyd</b> | about that strange, mis-shapen coat of his that arouses my suspicions.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Twenty-sixth of June, 1877.  The Ecuadorian Andes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Our situation is desperate.  A fierce wind from the south-west carries
<b>Floyd</b> | us ever closer to the mouth of an erupting volcano.  If my
<b>Floyd</b> | calculations are correct (and there is no reason to suppose otherwise)
<b>Floyd</b> | we are headed directly for the mouth of Mount Cotopaxi, highest
<b>Floyd</b> | volcano in the Americas!  Our altitude is twelve thousand feet, and in
<b>Floyd</b> | in spite of all my efforts, I am unable to raise the balloon any
<b>Floyd</b> | higher.  I have been forced to throw out all four sandbags, our food
<b>Floyd</b> | and water supplies, our first-aid kit, our compass, variometer and
<b>Floyd</b> | theodolite, and yet still we are too low to safely clear the volcano!
<b>Floyd</b> | In a moment I shall be compelled to throw out this very log-book,
<b>Floyd</b> | along with the pencil I am writing with, and all my outer garments, in
<b>Floyd</b> | a last ditch effort to gain the necessary altitude of twenty thousand
<b>Floyd</b> | feet.  Mr.  Booby assures me that he has disposed of all unnecessary
<b>Floyd</b> | weight, and yet somehow I doubt his veracity.  If there is anything at
<b>Floyd</b> | all concealed beneath that voluminous coat of his, I must find it now
<b>Floyd</b> | and dispose of it over the side of the basket, or we are both doomed!

<b>Floyd</b> | In the basket of a balloon
<b>Floyd</b> |    I am in the basket of the balloon, high, though not high enough
<b>Floyd</b> | above the foothills of the Andes.  Directly ahead of us is a glow in
<b>Floyd</b> | the sky; the heavens themselves seem to be ablaze as the wind carries
<b>Floyd</b> | us ever nearer to an erupting volcano!  Attached to the ropes that
<b>Floyd</b> | hold the balloon aloft is a brass altimeter, the one and only piece of
<b>Floyd</b> | aeronautical equipment that has not been sacrificed.  The basket is
<b>Floyd</b> | otherwise quite empty.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Hubert Booby stands in the corner of the basket, peering into
<b>Floyd</b> | space.

<b>Floyd</b> | In the basket of a balloon
<b>Floyd</b> |    I am in the basket of the balloon, high, though not high enough
<b>Floyd</b> | above the foothills of the Andes.  We are now practically on top of
<b>Floyd</b> | the volcano.  It is as though we are entering the mouth of hell
<b>Floyd</b> | itself!  Attached to the ropes that hold the balloon aloft is a brass
<b>Floyd</b> | altimeter, the one and only piece of aeronautical equipment that has
<b>Floyd</b> | not been sacrificed.  The basket is otherwise quite empty.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Hubert picks absently at the frayed cuff of his overcoat.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Aunt Gertie hobbles about the basket, prodding things with her
<b>Floyd</b> | cane.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My command of the English language is, alas, inadequate to describe

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You...  you...  you...  LOONY!"  before leaping after her.  The great

<b>Floyd</b> | Excerpt from "To Hell in a Hamper, Travels by Balloon with a Buffoon"
<b>Floyd</b> | by Prof.  P.  Pettibone, Oxford University Press, 1895.
<b>Floyd</b> | "...when my senses returned to me the volcano was far behind me.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | balloon had come to rest on the slopes of the lower Andes.  There I
<b>Floyd</b> | was found, frostbitten and in a state of nervous exhaustion, by a
<b>Floyd</b> | party of llama herdsmen. I had reached 37,000 feet, an altitude
<b>Floyd</b> | heretofore unattained by any balloonist in history, and had lived to
<b>Floyd</b> | tell the tale.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Without the means to replace my supply of hydrogen further travel by
<b>Floyd</b> | balloon was impossible.  When I had recovered fully I travelled to
<b>Floyd</b> | Quito by pack horse, and from there arranged passage to England by
<b>Floyd</b> | land and sea.  The journey was uneventful, but my trials were not yet
<b>Floyd</b> | over, for soon after my arrival I was called to account for the
<b>Floyd</b> | various transgressions comitted by my travelling companion during our
<b>Floyd</b> | adventures.  There was the small matter of a Rembrandt painting stolen
<b>Floyd</b> | from the Louvre the previous year (secreted, no doubt beneath that
<b>Floyd</b> | voluminous overcoat), and the matter of the desecration of an Egyptian
<b>Floyd</b> | tomb, as well as a dozen other infractions of a lesser nature.
<b>Floyd</b> | Fortunately I was able to absolve myself of blame for these crimes,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it was a great shame that Hubert was not around to be held
<b>Floyd</b> | accountable for his actions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Rembrandt, fortunately, was not one of his better pieces, owing to
<b>Floyd</b> | a lapse of judgement on the part of the master in his choice of
<b>Floyd</b> | subject matter.  It is generally agreed that the great artist's
<b>Floyd</b> | reputation has benefitted, rather than suffered for the loss of "Three
<b>Floyd</b> | Kittens in a Chamber Pot."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The mummy was a different matter however.  It turned out to have been
<b>Floyd</b> | the corpse of Imhotep, architect of the Great Pyramid.  The Egyptian
<b>Floyd</b> | government were most upset to learn that the builder of their most
<b>Floyd</b> | exalted monument was last seen tumbling towards a hasty reburial on
<b>Floyd</b> | the frozen slopes of the Andes.  As I understand it, negotiations
<b>Floyd</b> | between the British, Egyptian and Ecuadorian governments are still
<b>Floyd</b> | ongoing with regard to the mummy's recovery and safe return to its
<b>Floyd</b> | tomb.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As for Hubert and his disagreeable Aunt Gertie, I never saw them
<b>Floyd</b> | again.  However, a party of Germans trekking in the foothills of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Andes five years later reported seeing a large fat man and an old
<b>Floyd</b> | woman who lived together in a stone hut with a Saint Bernard dog.
<b>Floyd</b> | According to the Germans, the pair spoke fluent English, but what they
<b>Floyd</b> | said made little sense.  She kept muttering something about "clean
<b>Floyd</b> | underwear" and he did nothing all day but lament the loss of a cuckoo
<b>Floyd</b> | clock.
<b>Floyd</b> | I myself retired from ballooning in 1890, having travelled in nearly
<b>Floyd</b> | every country in the world.  I am now dedicated to submarine
<b>Floyd</b> | exploration, in which science I am swiftly becoming the world's
<b>Floyd</b> | foremost authority."
