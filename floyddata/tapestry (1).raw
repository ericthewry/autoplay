The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Tapestry</i>, written by Daniel Ravipinto.  <i>Tapestry</i> was originally released as part of the 1996 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took second place. It went on to garner a Xyzzy nomination for Best Writing and took the Xyzzy for Best Story.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Tapestry"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your sight fails you. For that matter, you don't know if your eyes are

<b>Floyd</b> | Ruined Tower
<b>Floyd</b> | The Ivory Tower, where you started this strange adventure, now lies in
<b>Floyd</b> | ruins. Its walls lie scorched about you, the roof rent to the open sky.
<b>Floyd</b> | The stars, in their impassive brilliance, illuminate the devastation

<b>Floyd</b> | below. Over the Tower's remains you catch glimpses of the fires below,
<b>Floyd</b> | trees smoldering in the darkness.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Tapestry seems to have survived the Tower's destruction intact.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Morningstar is here.

<b>Floyd</b> | IV-tube, leading to a machine which stands at the bedside.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a brief, horrible moment, you think that you're too late ... she's
<b>Floyd</b> | gone. But then, you see her chest slowly lift, then lower. She's
<b>Floyd</b> | breathing ... she's alive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Her eyes flutter for a moment, then slowly open. Her pupils unfocused,

<b>Floyd</b> | she looks around the room, finally catching sight of you. She pauses,
<b>Floyd</b> | then smiles.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh Timmy..." she says. You heart catches in your throat as you hear
<b>Floyd</b> | how weak her voice is; barely a whisper, hardly stronger than a soft
<b>Floyd</b> | breeze. You must have flinched, because her brow furrows and she looks
<b>Floyd</b> | at you, concerned. "What's wrong...?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wrong!  Everything, everything's wrong. You're dying and I don't know
<b>Floyd</b> | what to do, you're leaving and I don't know how to say goodbye...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Nothing, Mama."  You slowly approach the bed and grasp her hand. It's
<b>Floyd</b> | cold, and her skin is almost translucent, revealing her tiny bones

<b>Floyd</b> | beneath. She's so fragile and so helpless. And she was such a vibrant
<b>Floyd</b> | woman, so full of life ... just like Sarah.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sarah. The thought makes you pause. Why?  Why did this happen?  They
<b>Floyd</b> | were both so wonderful, so caring. They didn't deserve this. She had so
<b>Floyd</b> | many years ahead of her, so much to live for.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She smiles again. "Oh. That's good. You know I worry..." she pauses,
<b>Floyd</b> | catching her breath. "You know I worry so much about you..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You stroke her hand, biting your lip to stop from crying. "Yeah, yeah I
<b>Floyd</b> | know."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She lifts her head to look up at you, and suddenly you can see a little
<b>Floyd</b> | bit of a glint in her eye, a hint at the vibrance that she was so known
<b>Floyd</b> | for. She peers at you. "Why ... why aren't you at work?  Aren't you
<b>Floyd</b> | always busy at..." The rest is lost in a wheeze as she sags back into
<b>Floyd</b> | her pillow.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Don't worry, Mom. It's fine. I just thought ... I, I just wanted to
<b>Floyd</b> | visit you."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She smiles. "Well, that's ok, but you've got to take..."  She suddenly
<b>Floyd</b> | stops.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mom?  Mama?  Can you hear me?  Are you all..."  Oh no please ...
<b>Floyd</b> | please ...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Her jaw goes slack, then she blinks once or twice. "Oh, oh Timmy ... I
<b>Floyd</b> | think ... I think it's time..."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You begin babbling, not even realizing what you're saying. "No, no
<b>Floyd</b> | please. No!  No, you're fine, everything's fine, you'll be ok. Please,
<b>Floyd</b> | please!  You're fine!"  Hands grasp your shoulders and begin pulling
<b>Floyd</b> | you backwards, you can vaguely hear Doctor Hughes's voice telling you
<b>Floyd</b> | that there's nothing you can do, that it's her time, but you don't

<b>Floyd</b> | listen to him. You can't. You struggle forwards, trying to get closer
<b>Floyd</b> | to the bed. "Please ... please, you're all right, aren't you?  Tell me
<b>Floyd</b> | you're all right!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks up to you serenely, seemingly unaware of your panic. "Shhh.
<b>Floyd</b> | It'll be ok, Timmy. Everything will be ok."  She pauses again, then

<b>Floyd</b> | closes her eyes, and whispers "I love you Timmy..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then she's gone. You can feel it, she's gone...the room's empty
<b>Floyd</b> | now. And then you're falling, clutching her cold form against you and

<b>Floyd</b> | MERCY HOSPITAL TO BEGIN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PROGRAM
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yesterday in a press conference, Dr. Robert Albero announced that Mercy
<b>Floyd</b> | Hospital has been chosen to head a newly implemented experimental
<b>Floyd</b> | program for the possible treatment of Apentrylic Syndrome. The

<b>Floyd</b> | program's main component is phenylhydroxythiol (Phenotol), a drug newly
<b>Floyd</b> | developed at Ciba-Gigey Laboratories with government funding. Dr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Albero will head the experiment that will give pre-selected groups the
<b>Floyd</b> | treatment over a period of six weeks to gauge its effectiveness on
<b>Floyd</b> | human subjects.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The drug has been shown to successfully combat the disease in
<b>Floyd</b> | laboratory animals, and, if the current experiments are successful, Dr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Albero hopes to see FDA approval for distribution by as early as next
<b>Floyd</b> | year. Subjects for the experiment have been chosen with specific
<b>Floyd</b> | criteria used to test the treatment's effectiveness on humans of
<b>Floyd</b> | varying characteristics such as sex and age. Several groups will be

<b>Floyd</b> | tested, with certain groups given placebos as a control.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, not all of Dr. Albero's associates are as optimistic about the
<b>Floyd</b> | results. "There's absolutely no reason to assume the treatment will be
<b>Floyd</b> | as effective on humans as it has been on laboratory animals," said one
<b>Floyd</b> | who asked to remain anonymous. "He's putting it totally out of

<b>Floyd</b> | proportion to say that it'll be approved by next year. I'd be surprised
<b>Floyd</b> | if it's available within the next five. There still remains an
<b>Floyd</b> | extensive amount of research to be done."

<b>Floyd</b> | Hospital Room
<b>Floyd</b> | Like a horribly cycling nightmare, you find yourself back in this white
<b>Floyd</b> | room stinking of disinfectant. How many times have you been here
<b>Floyd</b> | before, in your mind, replaying this possible scene of being here with
<b>Floyd</b> | your mother when she died?  And now, it looks as if perhaps you'll get
<b>Floyd</b> | your second chance after all...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Here, unmoving on the hospital bed, lies your mother.

<b>Floyd</b> | locks over her face and from her arm protrudes the clear line of an
<b>Floyd</b> | IV-tube, leading to a machine which stands at the bedside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a brief, horrible moment, you think that you're too late ... she's
<b>Floyd</b> | gone. But then, you see her chest slowly lift, then lower. She's
<b>Floyd</b> | breathing ... she's alive.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Her eyes flutter for a moment, then slowly open. Her pupils unfocused,
<b>Floyd</b> | she looks around the room, finally catching sight of you. She pauses,
<b>Floyd</b> | then smiles.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh Timmy..." she says. You heart catches in your throat as you hear
<b>Floyd</b> | how weak her voice is; barely a whisper, hardly stronger than a soft

<b>Floyd</b> | breeze. You must have flinched, because her brow furrows and she looks
<b>Floyd</b> | at you, concerned. "What's wrong...?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wrong!  Everything, everything's wrong. You're dying and I don't know
<b>Floyd</b> | what to do, you're leaving and I don't know how to say goodbye...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Nothing, Mama."  You slowly approach the bed and grasp her hand. It's
<b>Floyd</b> | cold, and her skin is almost translucent, revealing her tiny bones
<b>Floyd</b> | beneath. She's so fragile and so helpless. And she was such a vibrant
<b>Floyd</b> | woman, so full of life ... just like Sarah.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sarah. The thought makes you pause. Why?  Why did this happen?  They

<b>Floyd</b> | were both so wonderful, so caring. They didn't deserve this. She had so
<b>Floyd</b> | many years ahead of her, so much to live for.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She smiles again. "Oh. That's good. You know I worry..." she pauses,
<b>Floyd</b> | catching her breath. "You know I worry so much about you..."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You stroke her hand, biting your lip to stop from crying. "Yeah, yeah I
<b>Floyd</b> | know."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She lifts her head to look up at you, and suddenly you can see a little
<b>Floyd</b> | bit of a glint in her eye, a hint at the vibrance that she was so known
<b>Floyd</b> | for. She peers at you. "Why ... why aren't you at work?  Aren't you

<b>Floyd</b> | always busy at..." The rest is lost in a wheeze as she sags back into
<b>Floyd</b> | her pillow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Don't worry, Mom. It's fine. I just thought ... I, I just wanted to
<b>Floyd</b> | visit you."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | She smiles. "Well, that's ok, but you've got to take..."  She suddenly
<b>Floyd</b> | stops.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mom?  Mama?  Can you hear me?  Are you all..."  Oh no please ...
<b>Floyd</b> | please ...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Her jaw goes slack, then she blinks once or twice. "Oh, oh Timmy ... I
<b>Floyd</b> | think ... I think it's time..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You begin babbling, not even realizing what you're saying. "No, no
<b>Floyd</b> | please. No!  No, you're fine, everything's fine, you'll be ok. Please,
<b>Floyd</b> | please!  You're fine!"  Hands grasp your shoulders and begin pulling

<b>Floyd</b> | you backwards, you can vaguely hear Doctor Hughes's voice telling you
<b>Floyd</b> | that there's nothing you can do, that it's her time, but you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | listen to him. You can't. You struggle forwards, trying to get closer
<b>Floyd</b> | to the bed. "Please ... please, you're all right, aren't you?  Tell me
<b>Floyd</b> | you're all right!"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | She looks up to you serenely, seemingly unaware of your panic. "Shhh.
<b>Floyd</b> | It'll be ok, Timmy. Everything will be ok."  She pauses again, then
<b>Floyd</b> | closes her eyes, and whispers "I love you Timmy..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then she's gone. You can feel it, she's gone...the room's empty
<b>Floyd</b> | now. And then you're falling, clutching her cold form against you and

<b>Floyd</b> | crying, lost and alone.

<b>Floyd</b> | MERCY HOSPITAL TO BEGIN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PROGRAM
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yesterday in a press conference, Dr. Robert Albero announced that Mercy

<b>Floyd</b> | Hospital has been chosen to head a newly implemented experimental
<b>Floyd</b> | program for the possible treatment of Apentrylic Syndrome. The
<b>Floyd</b> | program's main component is phenylhydroxythiol (Phenotol), a drug newly
<b>Floyd</b> | developed at Ciba-Gigey Laboratories with government funding. Dr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Albero will head the experiment that will give pre-selected groups the
<b>Floyd</b> | treatment over a period of six weeks to gauge its effectiveness on

<b>Floyd</b> | human subjects.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The drug has been shown to successfully combat the disease in
<b>Floyd</b> | laboratory animals, and, if the current experiments are successful, Dr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Albero hopes to see FDA approval for distribution by as early as next
<b>Floyd</b> | year. Subjects for the experiment have been chosen with specific

<b>Floyd</b> | criteria used to test the treatment's effectiveness on humans of
<b>Floyd</b> | varying characteristics such as sex and age. Several groups will be
<b>Floyd</b> | tested, with certain groups given placebos as a control.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, not all of Dr. Albero's associates are as optimistic about the
<b>Floyd</b> | results. "There's absolutely no reason to assume the treatment will be

<b>Floyd</b> | as effective on humans as it has been on laboratory animals," said one
<b>Floyd</b> | who asked to remain anonymous. "He's putting it totally out of
<b>Floyd</b> | proportion to say that it'll be approved by next year. I'd be surprised
<b>Floyd</b> | if it's available within the next five. There still remains an
<b>Floyd</b> | extensive amount of research to be done."

<b>Floyd</b> | Bedroom

<b>Floyd</b> | Your bedroom has been one of the few areas where Sarah's influence has
<b>Floyd</b> | been at work. You felt the presence of her long after she had gone, and
<b>Floyd</b> | a few months after her death put it back the way it had been. A door to
<b>Floyd</b> | the east leads back to the den and to the south is the bathroom.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Somehow, in this strange world of the past, Sarah still lives. She's

<b>Floyd</b> | lying, half asleep, in bed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beside the bed is a small endtable.

<b>Floyd</b> | "What is it, Tim?"  Excitedly, you tell her about the program at Mercy

<b>Floyd</b> | as one of the ones who will really receive the treatment. You omit how

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sarah's reaction surprises you. Rather than being happy, she seems sad.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Really?  A possible cure. I never thought of that."  She shakes her

<b>Floyd</b> | head. "No, Timmy, I don't think I could go through that. Not another

<b>Floyd</b> | Den
<b>Floyd</b> | The living room of your small home has changed little since your
<b>Floyd</b> | bachelor days, although Sarah's being here has altered it in some small
<b>Floyd</b> | ways. She keeps saying how the place needs more of "a woman's touch,"
<b>Floyd</b> | but for all her talk, her work kept her too busy to do much, and now
<b>Floyd</b> | ... well, she can't do much at all. To the south lies your office, and

<b>Floyd</b> | You turn the corner with a sigh, glancing at the street sign in a
<b>Floyd</b> | feeble, half-hearted attempt to figure out where you are. You've left
<b>Floyd</b> | the old familiar neighborhood far behind you tonight, as you have

<b>Floyd</b> | almost every night. Each outing seems to take you a little further, to
<b>Floyd</b> | an area a little stranger and more dangerous.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tonight, you didn't even bother giving yourself an excuse. Before, it
<b>Floyd</b> | had been that you had somewhere to go, something to do. Not tonight.
<b>Floyd</b> | Some indeterminate time ago, you stumbled out of the house, stuck the

<b>Floyd</b> | key in the ignition, and just started driving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sharp honk of a nearby car breaks your musings. You glance upward
<b>Floyd</b> | to see a pair of girls, jump ropes under their arms, pigtails flying
<b>Floyd</b> | behind them, run across the street, right in front of your car...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Time slows as you slam down on your brakes. For a moment, you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | think you'll make it, but with a squeal of the tires, your old Dodge
<b>Floyd</b> | manages to grind to a halt in time. The girls make it across, laughing
<b>Floyd</b> | all the while, unaware of how close death has come.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your Car

<b>Floyd</b> | The old hunk of junk has served you pretty well in the past few years.
<b>Floyd</b> | You could probably afford something better, but why bother?  It runs,
<b>Floyd</b> | it gets you to work and back. What more could you want?  What more do
<b>Floyd</b> | you need?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The buildings outside seem mostly tenements, their residents escaping

<b>Floyd</b> | the sweltering evening by sitting outside on the stone porches, the
<b>Floyd</b> | sidewalks. The girls continue on their way, and soon enter a tenement.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With a sigh a relief, you step on the gas and continue on your way.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This was only natural, being mortal. The life he led was probably most
<b>Floyd</b> | unusual in its normalcy; his childhood so much so as to be mundane.

<b>Floyd</b> | Neither praised nor reviled, neither a leader nor an outcast, he was
<b>Floyd</b> | simply another face in the crowd. He went to school, he studied, he did
<b>Floyd</b> | well enough to get by. After graduation he found a job he was good at
<b>Floyd</b> | and paid well enough. He bought a little house and lived there, a
<b>Floyd</b> | bother to no one, and the days just flowed one into the other...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | In fact, the first event of any importance in his life was the death of
<b>Floyd</b> | his mother.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She had been ill for some time, but Timothy tried not to think about
<b>Floyd</b> | it. He'd placed her in Mercy Hospital mostly to forget about her, to
<b>Floyd</b> | get on with his life. Apparently, however, it wasn't good enough. His

<b>Floyd</b> | work suffered, his productivity slipped. On the Sunday that she died,
<b>Floyd</b> | he realized that the charity case he had been doing for the firm wasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | yet finished. Half-way through his frantic working, he received a phone
<b>Floyd</b> | call from Mercy Hospital. They gave her an hour at the most.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Something must have happened then; the guilt that Timothy had felt at

<b>Floyd</b> | putting her in the Hospital must have caught up with him. On the spot,
<b>Floyd</b> | he decided that he couldn't finish the Thompson account.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Calling his friend Mike at the firm, he quickly described his mother's
<b>Floyd</b> | condition and that the Thompson account would not be finished on time.
<b>Floyd</b> | Racing to his mother's side, he was there in her final moments,

<b>Floyd</b> | comforting her as best he could, apologizing for what he had done.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Thompson's lost everything they had ever worked for.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The time after his mother's death was a lonely one for Timothy, perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | because, for the first time, he realized he was truly alone. Then, he

<b>Floyd</b> | met Sarah, and everything changed. She was so loving, so full of life,
<b>Floyd</b> | so willing to drag him from the small, empty world he had built for
<b>Floyd</b> | himself. They complemented each other so well: her spontaneity to his
<b>Floyd</b> | structure, her boundless energy to his complacency. Their whirlwind
<b>Floyd</b> | romance caught him totally unawares, and when she accepted his proposal
<b>Floyd</b> | of marriage, he thought himself the happiest man on earth.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Truly, their first five years together were the happiest time of his
<b>Floyd</b> | life. The experience of having his life so intricately tied to another
<b>Floyd</b> | was exhiliarating; he built his entire existence around her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Which is why her falling ill struck him so hard.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was agonizing for Timothy to see her wasting away. "Apentrylic
<b>Floyd</b> | Syndrome" they called it, a metabolic disorder carried in a recessive
<b>Floyd</b> | gene. There wasn't a cure, they told him, and they didn't think she'd
<b>Floyd</b> | last more than a year.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | They were wrong. For five years, Timothy watched his wife slowly
<b>Floyd</b> | rotting away from the inside. Her energy faded, her strength tapped
<b>Floyd</b> | away. The similarity to his mother was horrifying, both women clinging
<b>Floyd</b> | to life in a way that was almost unnatural. The strain on Timothy was
<b>Floyd</b> | telling, and when he happened upon the article discussing a possible
<b>Floyd</b> | cure to the Syndrome, he was overjoyed.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But, upon realizing it was Dr. Albero who was running the program, he
<b>Floyd</b> | fell into a rage. Calling the hospital, he angrily demanded why Sarah
<b>Floyd</b> | had not been entered into the program. The doctor's excuses of placebos
<b>Floyd</b> | and control groups meant nothing to him and, in an attempt to make the
<b>Floyd</b> | bastard agree to let her in the program, happened upon the project's

<b>Floyd</b> | budget. Calling the good doctor back, he causally mentioned the
<b>Floyd</b> | discrepancy in the monies.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Under the threat of blackmail, Albero agreed to allow Sarah the
<b>Floyd</b> | treatment. And, miraculously, it worked. Sarah got better, although she
<b>Floyd</b> | was never again the vibrant woman Timothy remembered.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Halfway through the program, Dr. Albero mysteriously committed suicide,
<b>Floyd</b> | for reasons unknown.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The time after Sarah's crisis was much like it had been before his
<b>Floyd</b> | mother's death; his life mundane, his existence centered around his

<b>Floyd</b> | work. The disease had taken away much of Sarah's vitality, and her zest
<b>Floyd</b> | for life was never the same. His time devoted more and more to himself
<b>Floyd</b> | and his work, he began to withdraw more and more from the world at
<b>Floyd</b> | large. At night, he drove around the city alone, trying to find the
<b>Floyd</b> | meaning of what had happened to him, of why such things had happened to
<b>Floyd</b> | him.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The night he died was such a night. He had been driving for hours, only
<b>Floyd</b> | half paying attention to what was going on. Then, from nowhere, a young
<b>Floyd</b> | girl ran into the middle of the road. With a cry and acting purely on
<b>Floyd</b> | what must have been instinct, he wrenched the wheel to the right,
<b>Floyd</b> | narrowly missing the young woman and almost flipping the car over. In

<b>Floyd</b> | an attempt to right himself, he swerved to the left ... and struck a
<b>Floyd</b> | young man standing on the sidewalk. Both he and Timothy were killed on
<b>Floyd</b> | impact. Afterwards, it was revealed that the young man was the woman's
<b>Floyd</b> | boyfriend. They had had an argument and in an attempt to get away from
<b>Floyd</b> | him, she had half pushed, half been pushed into the the road. Timothy's
<b>Floyd</b> | quick thinking had merely exchanged the death of one of the lovers for

<b>Floyd</b> | the other.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died. To say anything more would
<b>Floyd</b> | be futile speculation.

<b>Floyd</b> | First, I would like to thank the following people for their invaluable

<b>Floyd</b> | help:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |      Timothy "Hunter" Evanson -- for being there at the story's
<b>Floyd</b> | conception.
<b>Floyd</b> |           It wouldn't be half the game it became without him.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Sabrina "Stinky" Ravipinto -- for love, support, and MORE patience

<b>Floyd</b> |           than any human being could possibly require.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Steph "Psych-o" Barnett -- for story ideas and all that important
<b>Floyd</b> |           rat-training info.
<b>Floyd</b> |      David "Astro" Walton -- for nitpicking above and beyond the call
<b>Floyd</b> | of duty.
<b>Floyd</b> |      David "OG" Learn -- for makin' Astro's nitpickin' look like

<b>Floyd</b> | nothin'.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Allison "Squeaky" Tumarkin -- for writing something even odder
<b>Floyd</b> | than
<b>Floyd</b> |           TAPESTRY.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Niki "Willow" Hinson -- for smartening up the parser by whining
<b>Floyd</b> | that

<b>Floyd</b> |           it was stupid.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Andy "The Boy" Olson -- for a million-and-one Bible references.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Audra "Oh I Had A Little Chicken" Senato -- for alpha-testing and
<b>Floyd</b> |           backup-singing.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Mike "Milk" Shultz -- for fitting me into his ever-busy schedule.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Erika "Erika" Stoll -- for putting up with my eccentricities long

<b>Floyd</b> |           enough to beta-test.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A BIG thank you to the IF Competition Betatesters:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |      Michael "The Legend" Kinyon -- Simply the best tester I've ever

<b>Floyd</b> | had the
<b>Floyd</b> |            pleasure to work with. Period.
<b>Floyd</b> |      "V. BALAVAGE" -- for great comments and a ton of information for
<b>Floyd</b> |            my NEXT game.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Also thanks to Charles Carr and Jarrod Henry.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game was an attempt to see if a serious and interesting story
<b>Floyd</b> | could be merged with traditional IF 'puzzle' elements without one
<b>Floyd</b> | overshadowing the other. Also, I attempted to tackle a few of the
<b>Floyd</b> | issues that have been discussed recently on r.a.i-f, including
<b>Floyd</b> | mutually-exclusive paths, a pre-defined main character, moral dilemmas,

<b>Floyd</b> | 'puzzle-less' IF, and semi-realistic NPCs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hope that I've come close to achieving my goals and have entertained
<b>Floyd</b> | you in the process. I would love to hear any and all comments or
<b>Floyd</b> | constructive criticism you may have. My current e-mail address can be
<b>Floyd</b> | found by using the 'AUTHOR' command.

<b>Floyd</b> | You remember nightmares as a child like this, where no matter how fast
<b>Floyd</b> | you went, you knew it was never quite fast enough...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Mike's driving like a maniac, but some part of you already knows that
<b>Floyd</b> | it's too late. You've already been through this and it's too late. And
<b>Floyd</b> | yet...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And yet there's some part of you that's hoping that somehow, someway,
<b>Floyd</b> | she'll be ok, that it won't be the same this time ... it won't ... just

<b>Floyd</b> | somehow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mike pulls up in front of Mercy with a screech, yelling at you as you
<b>Floyd</b> | slam into the front doors to go ahead, he'll be up right behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You rush past the front desk, running for the elevators and slip

<b>Floyd</b> | between the doors just as they're closing. You frantically stab at the
<b>Floyd</b> | buttons, and then slump against the back wall. First, second, third,
<b>Floyd</b> | fourth, hurry god-damn you hurry ... please ... please ... fourth, come
<b>Floyd</b> | on ... come on you ... fifth!   The doors slide back and you rush down
<b>Floyd</b> | the corridor, almost slipping on the tiles and finally come to a
<b>Floyd</b> | screetching halt at the door to your mother's room.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No!"  But it's too late. She's dead. It takes a moment for you to

<b>Floyd</b> | You didn't mean to abandon her. You wanted to be here...

<b>Floyd</b> | ONE WEEK LATER...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The past few days have been a blur; the funeral arrangements, the
<b>Floyd</b> | reading of the will, the unending visits by family and friends,
<b>Floyd</b> | offering their condolences, all of it running and smearing together in
<b>Floyd</b> | a confused muddle...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Funeral Parlor
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mother specified in her will exactly how she wanted everything:
<b>Floyd</b> | the open-casket viewing, whom she wanted to speak the eulogies. It's
<b>Floyd</b> | almost over now, the last of the remaining mourners (mostly old friends
<b>Floyd</b> | of your mother's you haven't seen in years) having already spoken with
<b>Floyd</b> | you. Some stragglers are still making their way past the coffin. As for

<b>Floyd</b> | you, you've been in the back of the room, shaking hands, saying thanks
<b>Floyd</b> | for their condolences, and feeling utterly numb. You haven't had the
<b>Floyd</b> | courage all afternoon to head to the north end of the parlor and see
<b>Floyd</b> | your mother lying there...

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | There is no response...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As suddenly as it appeared, the Wraith vanishes, and in its place
<b>Floyd</b> | stands Clotho of the Parcae.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You have chosen well, Timothy," she says. "You have learned of your

<b>Floyd</b> | Moira and chosen, as you should, to live within it. You have learned to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She gently takes you by the hand and leads you through the frozen crowd

<b>Floyd</b> | and peer inside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks beautiful. Her hair falls across her face, just covering her
<b>Floyd</b> | eyes, and the dress she wears was always one of her favorites. "I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | sorry, Mom, I'm sorry..." you whisper. And suddenly, somehow, you know.

<b>Floyd</b> | You know that she understands, that it wasn't your fault. She knows
<b>Floyd</b> | that you didn't abandon her, that you were trying to help. You turn to
<b>Floyd</b> | Clotho, eyes bright with tears, and she nods.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes, Timothy. She always knew. And, perhaps in a way, you did as well.

<b>Floyd</b> | you have faced the Wraith, you have stopped what happened before."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Memory floods back. The funeral. How you fled, how you couldn't face

<b>Floyd</b> | Clotho nods once more. "Yes, Timothy. Well done."

<b>Floyd</b> | "You have taken the first step along my path, Timothy. Once chosen, it

<b>Floyd</b> | Den
<b>Floyd</b> | The living room of your small home has changed little since your
<b>Floyd</b> | bachelor days, although Sarah's being here has altered it in some small
<b>Floyd</b> | ways. She keeps saying how the place needs more of "a woman's touch,"
<b>Floyd</b> | but for all her talk, her work kept her too busy to do much, and now
<b>Floyd</b> | ... well, she can't do much at all. To the south lies your office, and

<b>Floyd</b> | to the west is the bedroom. The doorway to the north leads outside to
<b>Floyd</b> | the driveway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Off to one side, built into the wall, is a small fireplace.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the

<b>Floyd</b> | eastern wall.

<b>Floyd</b> | You've had a place to do work for years, but only recently have you

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The remainder of your work papers lie on your desk, next to the

<b>Floyd</b> | You turn the corner with a sigh, glancing at the street sign in a

<b>Floyd</b> | feeble, half-hearted attempt to figure out where you are. You've left
<b>Floyd</b> | the old familiar neighborhood far behind you tonight, as you have
<b>Floyd</b> | almost every night. Each outing seems to take you a little further, to
<b>Floyd</b> | an area a little stranger and more dangerous.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tonight, you didn't even bother giving yourself an excuse. Before, it

<b>Floyd</b> | had been that you had somewhere to go, something to do. Not tonight.
<b>Floyd</b> | Some indeterminate time ago, you stumbled out of the house, stuck the
<b>Floyd</b> | key in the ignition, and just started driving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sharp honk of a nearby car breaks your musings. You glance upward
<b>Floyd</b> | to see a pair of girls, jump ropes under their arms, pigtails flying

<b>Floyd</b> | behind them, run across the street, right in front of your car...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time slows as you slam down on your brakes. For a moment, you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | think you'll make it, but with a squeal of the tires, your old Dodge
<b>Floyd</b> | manages to grind to a halt in time. The girls make it across, laughing
<b>Floyd</b> | all the while, unaware of how close death has come.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your Car
<b>Floyd</b> | The old hunk of junk has served you pretty well in the past few years.
<b>Floyd</b> | You could probably afford something better, but why bother?  It runs,
<b>Floyd</b> | it gets you to work and back. What more could you want?  What more do
<b>Floyd</b> | you need?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The buildings outside seem mostly tenements, their residents escaping
<b>Floyd</b> | the sweltering evening by sitting outside on the stone porches, the

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The wraith laughs coldly. "So, we meet again!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Three times have me met, mortal, and three times have you fled!  Know
<b>Floyd</b> | you the master of your Moira, know you the Spectre of your guilt!"  The
<b>Floyd</b> | creature throws back its hidden head and laughs, the sound chilling

<b>Floyd</b> | stands before you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The circle is now complete, Timothy. You have acted rightly, and the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She turns and looks towards the churning waters. As she does so, the
<b>Floyd</b> | orb's light fades, and the black waters rise. Sinking from sight, the
<b>Floyd</b> | now-dead moon vanishes, and the waters are quiet, still and dark.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Some places should stay hidden in darkness, Timothy," she whispers.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Illumination is not always a good thing."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Atropos turns back to you. "The final step has been taken, Timothy. The

<b>Floyd</b> | you. I wish you well."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This was only natural, being mortal. The life he led was probably most

<b>Floyd</b> | unusual in its normalcy; his childhood so much so as to be mundane.
<b>Floyd</b> | Neither praised nor reviled, neither a leader nor an outcast, he was
<b>Floyd</b> | simply another face in the crowd. He went to school, he studied, he did
<b>Floyd</b> | well enough to get by. After graduation he found a job he was good at
<b>Floyd</b> | and paid well enough. He bought a little house and lived there, a
<b>Floyd</b> | bother to no one, and the days just flowed one into the other...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In fact, the first event of any importance in his life was the death of
<b>Floyd</b> | his mother.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She had been ill for quite a while, and during this time, Timothy was
<b>Floyd</b> | under a great deal of stress. His small, comfortable world fell apart

<b>Floyd</b> | around him as he realized that something had ended; an innocent part of
<b>Floyd</b> | his life where he had thought she would always be with him was over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Thompson account had totally slipped his mind, and he had been
<b>Floyd</b> | frantically trying to finish it when he heard the news that she was
<b>Floyd</b> | dying. An hour they gave her at the most. Faced with the agonizing

<b>Floyd</b> | choice of being with her in her final moments on this earth, or helping
<b>Floyd</b> | the Thompson from losing everything they had, he chose to go to City
<b>Floyd</b> | Hall to get the papers that were necessary signed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | His frantic attempt to arrive at the Hospital afterwards was too late,
<b>Floyd</b> | and he never forgave himself for that. Ever afterward, he imagined his

<b>Floyd</b> | mother slowly dying in that horrible white room, the worst part of her
<b>Floyd</b> | death knowing that her son had abandoned her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The funeral was too much for Timothy. Faced with the tremendous guilt
<b>Floyd</b> | at betraying his mother, he fled the service, forever missing the
<b>Floyd</b> | chance to see his mother's face one last time.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The time after his mother's death was a lonely one for Timothy, perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | because, for the first time, he realized he was truly alone. Then, he
<b>Floyd</b> | met Sarah, and everything changed. She was so loving, so full of life,
<b>Floyd</b> | so willing to drag him from the small, empty world he had built for
<b>Floyd</b> | himself. They complemented each other so well: her spontaneity to his

<b>Floyd</b> | structure, her boundless energy to his complacency. Their whirlwind
<b>Floyd</b> | romance caught him totally unawares, and when she accepted his proposal
<b>Floyd</b> | of marriage, he thought himself the happiest man on earth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Truly, their first five years together were the happiest time of his
<b>Floyd</b> | life. The experience of having his life so intricately tied to another

<b>Floyd</b> | was exhiliarating; he built his entire existence around her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Which is why her falling ill struck him so hard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was agonizing for Timothy to see her wasting away. "Apentrylic
<b>Floyd</b> | Syndrome" they called it, a metabolic disorder carried in a recessive

<b>Floyd</b> | gene. There wasn't a cure, they told him, and they didn't think she'd
<b>Floyd</b> | last more than a year.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | They were wrong. For five years, Timothy watched his wife slowly
<b>Floyd</b> | rotting away from the inside. Her energy faded, her strength tapped
<b>Floyd</b> | away. The woman who had filled his life with motion and vitality now

<b>Floyd</b> | could barely lift her head to take the countless pills the doctors
<b>Floyd</b> | prescribed. But she never complained, she never once told him how much
<b>Floyd</b> | pain she was in, how tired she was. But Timothy knew just the same.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After five years, it seemed as though it would never end. Not wishing
<b>Floyd</b> | to see her suffer further, not understanding why she had to continue

<b>Floyd</b> | such an agonized existence, he tried his best to help her. Putting her
<b>Floyd</b> | to sleep, he smothered her, praying that her death had been peaceful
<b>Floyd</b> | and painless. There was never any investigation of her death, the
<b>Floyd</b> | report said she died in her sleep.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ironically, on the day Sarah died, her doctor announced that a new

<b>Floyd</b> | treatment program was to be instituted that would test an experimental
<b>Floyd</b> | drug touted as the cure for Apentrylic Syndrome. Timothy, still
<b>Floyd</b> | suffering from the guilt he felt for killing Sarah, was overwhelmed. It
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't matter that the doctor told him she wouldn't have been let into
<b>Floyd</b> | the program anyway, he knew he should have found a way to do it. The
<b>Floyd</b> | guilt of what he had done never left him, and ate away at him with an

<b>Floyd</b> | intensity mirroring the Syndrome from which his wife suffered for so
<b>Floyd</b> | long.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The time after Sarah's death was much like it had been before his
<b>Floyd</b> | mother's; his life mundane, his existence centered around his work. But
<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy's experiences and the guilt he felt for his actions irrevocably

<b>Floyd</b> | changed him. He was no longer the same man. Haunted and ill at ease, he
<b>Floyd</b> | slept less and less, and found himself driving the streets at night in
<b>Floyd</b> | attempt to escape something not even he could put a name to.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The night he died he had been driving for hours in a trance-like state,
<b>Floyd</b> | hardly aware of the world around him. When the young girl came flailing

<b>Floyd</b> | into the middle of the street, it was too late. Timothy had already
<b>Floyd</b> | been dead years before.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It turned out that the young woman had been arguing with her boyfriend,
<b>Floyd</b> | and in a struggle, had half been was pushed, half pushed herself into
<b>Floyd</b> | the road. If Timothy had survived the accident, that knowledge would

<b>Floyd</b> | have meant nothing to him. He probably would have blamed himself
<b>Floyd</b> | anyway...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died. To say anything more would
<b>Floyd</b> | be futile speculation.

<b>Floyd</b> | MERCY HOSPITAL TO BEGIN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PROGRAM
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yesterday in a press conference, Dr. Robert Albero announced that Mercy
<b>Floyd</b> | Hospital has been chosen to head a newly implemented experimental

<b>Floyd</b> | program for the possible treatment of Apentrylic Syndrome. The
<b>Floyd</b> | program's main component is phenylhydroxythiol (Phenotol), a drug newly
<b>Floyd</b> | developed at Ciba-Gigey Laboratories with government funding. Dr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Albero will head the experiment that will give pre-selected groups the
<b>Floyd</b> | treatment over a period of six weeks to gauge its effectiveness on
<b>Floyd</b> | human subjects.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The drug has been shown to successfully combat the disease in
<b>Floyd</b> | laboratory animals, and, if the current experiments are successful, Dr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Albero hopes to see FDA approval for distribution by as early as next
<b>Floyd</b> | year. Subjects for the experiment have been chosen with specific
<b>Floyd</b> | criteria used to test the treatment's effectiveness on humans of

<b>Floyd</b> | varying characteristics such as sex and age. Several groups will be
<b>Floyd</b> | tested, with certain groups given placebos as a control.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, not all of Dr. Albero's associates are as optimistic about the
<b>Floyd</b> | results. "There's absolutely no reason to assume the treatment will be
<b>Floyd</b> | as effective on humans as it has been on laboratory animals," said one

<b>Floyd</b> | who asked to remain anonymous. "He's putting it totally out of
<b>Floyd</b> | proportion to say that it'll be approved by next year. I'd be surprised
<b>Floyd</b> | if it's available within the next five. There still remains an
<b>Floyd</b> | extensive amount of research to be done."

<b>Floyd</b> | "Well done, Timothy!  Once again, you have faced your fears and been
<b>Floyd</b> | victorious!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Clotho turns from you and approaches the endtable. Silently, she opens
<b>Floyd</b> | the drawer within it, rather anticlimactically revealing a small,
<b>Floyd</b> | folded note. She retrieves it and hands it to you. You see that it

<b>Floyd</b> | bears your name written on the front in Sarah's hand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It reads:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My Dearest Timothy,
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |      If you are reading this then either I have taken my own life, or
<b>Floyd</b> | you have helped me to. In either case, there are things I wish you to
<b>Floyd</b> | understand. Please do not think me selfish, my love, to do this. The
<b>Floyd</b> | pain we have both suffered is needless and my choice was to relieve us
<b>Floyd</b> | both of it. [9]If you have helped me to do this, then I know you have
<b>Floyd</b> | done so out of love. Do not let guilt get in the way of your knowing

<b>Floyd</b> | this, for I go to a better place, where I know someday you will join
<b>Floyd</b> | me. I will always love you, dearest, as I know you love me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yours always,
<b>Floyd</b> | Sarah
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You stand there, silent for a moment. You don't remember ever reading
<b>Floyd</b> | this note. Maybe your facing the Wraith changed something.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Clotho nods, as if reading your thoughts. "Yes, Timothy. While you have
<b>Floyd</b> | followed your choices for the most part, your Moira has, in fact, been
<b>Floyd</b> | changed. Your confrontation with your guilt has allowed you to see the

<b>Floyd</b> | truth. To see that Sarah was in pain and she wanted you to do this."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "And so, you have taken the second path along your altered Moira. The
<b>Floyd</b> | threads of your Destiny are changing Timothy ... do not falter now. Be
<b>Floyd</b> | brave, for the final step you do not take alone."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into
<b>Floyd</b> | their heaving embrace. They leave you, gasping, back in the Tower...

<b>Floyd</b> | You turn the corner with a sigh, glancing at the street sign in a
<b>Floyd</b> | feeble, half-hearted attempt to figure out where you are. You've left

<b>Floyd</b> | the old familiar neighborhood far behind you tonight, as you have
<b>Floyd</b> | almost every night. Each outing seems to take you a little further, to
<b>Floyd</b> | an area a little stranger and more dangerous.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tonight, you didn't even bother giving yourself an excuse. Before, it
<b>Floyd</b> | had been that you had somewhere to go, something to do. Not tonight.

<b>Floyd</b> | Some indeterminate time ago, you stumbled out of the house, stuck the
<b>Floyd</b> | key in the ignition, and just started driving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sharp honk of a nearby car breaks your musings. You glance upward
<b>Floyd</b> | to see a pair of girls, jump ropes under their arms, pigtails flying
<b>Floyd</b> | behind them, run across the street, right in front of your car...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time slows as you slam down on your brakes. For a moment, you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | think you'll make it, but with a squeal of the tires, your old Dodge
<b>Floyd</b> | manages to grind to a halt in time. The girls make it across, laughing
<b>Floyd</b> | all the while, unaware of how close death has come.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Your Car
<b>Floyd</b> | The old hunk of junk has served you pretty well in the past few years.
<b>Floyd</b> | You could probably afford something better, but why bother?  It runs,
<b>Floyd</b> | it gets you to work and back. What more could you want?  What more do
<b>Floyd</b> | you need?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The buildings outside seem mostly tenements, their residents escaping
<b>Floyd</b> | the sweltering evening by sitting outside on the stone porches, the
<b>Floyd</b> | sidewalks. The girls continue on their way, and soon enter a tenement.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With a sigh a relief, you step on the gas and continue on your way.

<b>Floyd</b> | to stand against it and the fear and guilt you have felt. Then, as
<b>Floyd</b> | suddenly as it appeared, the Wraith vanishes, and in its place stands
<b>Floyd</b> | Clotho of the Parcae.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "You have done it!" she cries, her face and eyes bright with tears. "Oh
<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy, you have defeated the Wraith, the guilt and darkness within
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself, the embodiment of all you feared ... "
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She turns and faces the battling forces behind her. As you both watch,
<b>Floyd</b> | the glow from the orb slowly begins to increase in intensity, flooding

<b>Floyd</b> | the buckling waters with shafts of brilliant light. Wailing in pain and
<b>Floyd</b> | defeat, the blackness begins to subside, and the river begin to
<b>Floyd</b> | brighten. In moments, there is nothing left of the foul substance, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the waters flowing outward from the font are crystal-clear.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Approaching the edge of the bank, Clotho reaches out and grasps the orb

<b>Floyd</b> | in both hands. With a sly smile, she places it in her robes, where it
<b>Floyd</b> | vanishes between the folds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Come Timothy," she says as she motions you towards the fount. "Come
<b>Floyd</b> | drink..."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The water is cold as it passes your lips and after drinking deeply, you

<b>Floyd</b> | continue, gulping draught after draught, you find your mind opening,
<b>Floyd</b> | the light of the illuminating water brightening some hidden darkness
<b>Floyd</b> | deep within you. As you stand and turn back to Clotho, you reach an
<b>Floyd</b> | epiphany: that the guilt you felt for the accident was unwarranted.

<b>Floyd</b> | Certainly, you should have paid more attention, but that would not have
<b>Floyd</b> | saved the girl. Attention or not, her sudden appearance in the middle
<b>Floyd</b> | of the road is what caught you by surprise.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Clotho nods. "Yes Timothy, the light you have drawn down from the skies
<b>Floyd</b> | has illuminated the the secrets you have kept from yourself. Well

<b>Floyd</b> | done."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The final step has been taken, Timothy. The Tapestry is finished, your
<b>Floyd</b> | Moira secure. The fear and guilt of your past you have faced bravely,
<b>Floyd</b> | and perhaps this fate you have woven for yourself is better then the
<b>Floyd</b> | one We originally wove for you. The time has come to leave this place

<b>Floyd</b> | of indecision, mortal, and face whatever destiny lies before you. I
<b>Floyd</b> | wish you well."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This was only natural, being mortal. The life he led was probably most
<b>Floyd</b> | unusual in its normalcy; his childhood so much so as to be mundane.
<b>Floyd</b> | Neither praised nor reviled, neither a leader nor an outcast, he was
<b>Floyd</b> | simply another face in the crowd. He went to school, he studied, he did

<b>Floyd</b> | well enough to get by. After graduation he found a job he was good at
<b>Floyd</b> | and paid well enough. He bought a little house and lived there, a
<b>Floyd</b> | bother to no one, and the days just flowed one into the other...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In fact, the first event of any importance in his life was the death of
<b>Floyd</b> | his mother.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She had been ill for quite a while, and during this time, Timothy was
<b>Floyd</b> | under a great deal of stress. His small, comfortable world fell apart
<b>Floyd</b> | around him as he realized that something had ended; an innocent part of
<b>Floyd</b> | his life where he had thought she would always be with him was over.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The Thompson account had totally slipped his mind, and he had been
<b>Floyd</b> | frantically trying to finish it when he heard the news that she was
<b>Floyd</b> | dying. An hour they gave her at the most. Faced with the agonizing
<b>Floyd</b> | choice of being with her in her final moments on this earth, or helping
<b>Floyd</b> | the Thompson's from losing everything they had, he chose to go to City
<b>Floyd</b> | Hall to get the papers that were necessary signed.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As quickly as he could, he rushed to his mother's side, only to realize
<b>Floyd</b> | it was to late. The guilt and self-loathing he felt for what he thought
<b>Floyd</b> | to be abandoning her were terrible. It took him a long time to realize
<b>Floyd</b> | that it was probably what his mother would have wanted him to do. He
<b>Floyd</b> | had stayed with her as much as he could when she was alive, had checked

<b>Floyd</b> | up on her at every opportunity, and the Thompsons had a great deal more
<b>Floyd</b> | to lose than she. He was very glad that he had a last opportunity to
<b>Floyd</b> | say farewell to her at the funeral. He knew she understood.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The time after his mother's death was a lonely one for Timothy, perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | because, for the first time, he realized he was truly alone. Then, he

<b>Floyd</b> | met Sarah, and everything changed. She was so loving, so full of life,
<b>Floyd</b> | so willing to drag him from the small, empty world he had built for
<b>Floyd</b> | himself. They complemented each other so well: her spontaneity to his
<b>Floyd</b> | structure, her boundless energy to his complacency. Their whirlwind
<b>Floyd</b> | romance caught him totally unawares, and when she accepted his proposal
<b>Floyd</b> | of marriage, he thought himself the happiest man on earth.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Truly, their first five years together were the happiest time of his
<b>Floyd</b> | life. The experience of having his life so intricately tied to another
<b>Floyd</b> | was exhiliarating; he built his entire existence around her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Which is why her falling ill struck him so hard.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was agonizing for Timothy to see her wasting away. "Apentrylic
<b>Floyd</b> | Syndrome" they called it, a metabolic disorder carried in a recessive
<b>Floyd</b> | gene. There wasn't a cure, they told him, and they didn't think she'd
<b>Floyd</b> | last more than a year.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | They were wrong. For five years, Timothy watched his wife slowly
<b>Floyd</b> | rotting away from the inside. Her energy faded, her strength tapped
<b>Floyd</b> | away. The woman who had filled his life with motion and vitality now
<b>Floyd</b> | could barely lift her head to take the countless pills the doctors
<b>Floyd</b> | prescribed. But she never complained, she never once told him how much
<b>Floyd</b> | pain she was in, how tired she was. But Timothy knew just the same.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After five years, it seemed as though it would never end. Not wishing
<b>Floyd</b> | to see her suffer further, not understanding why she had to continue
<b>Floyd</b> | such an agonized existence, he tried his best to help her. Putting her
<b>Floyd</b> | to sleep, he smothered her, praying that her death had been peaceful
<b>Floyd</b> | and painless. There was never any investigation of her death, the

<b>Floyd</b> | report said she died in her sleep.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The guilt of Sarah's death on his hands was horrible for Timothy,
<b>Floyd</b> | especially in the face of a possible cure. Facing his fears and his

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | guilt, Timothy forced himself to face his wife's suffering, to realize
<b>Floyd</b> | that he had helped her in the best way he knew how, and that he hoped
<b>Floyd</b> | she would understand why he had done it. When he found a final note
<b>Floyd</b> | among Sarah's possessions, he knew she had.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The time after Sarah's death was much like it had been before his

<b>Floyd</b> | mother's; his life mundane, his existence centered around his work. But
<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy's experiences irrevocably changed him; he was no longer the
<b>Floyd</b> | same man. Timothy thought a great deal of his life, of what he'd seen
<b>Floyd</b> | and what he had done. It seemed so unfair that bad things happened
<b>Floyd</b> | again and again to good people. Some nights he would go driving, trying
<b>Floyd</b> | to ease his mind, trying to find an answer to a question he couldn't

<b>Floyd</b> | formulate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The night he died he had been driving for hours, hardly aware of the
<b>Floyd</b> | world around him. When the young girl came flailing into the middle of
<b>Floyd</b> | the street, it was too late to stop in time. Both of them were killed
<b>Floyd</b> | instantly.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It turned out that the young woman had been arguing with her boyfriend,
<b>Floyd</b> | and in a struggle, had half been pushed, half pushed herself into the
<b>Floyd</b> | road.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died. To say anything more would

<b>Floyd</b> | be futile speculation.

<b>Floyd</b> | First, I would like to thank the following people for their invaluable
<b>Floyd</b> | help:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |      Timothy "Hunter" Evanson -- for being there at the story's
<b>Floyd</b> | conception.
<b>Floyd</b> |           It wouldn't be half the game it became without him.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Sabrina "Stinky" Ravipinto -- for love, support, and MORE patience
<b>Floyd</b> |           than any human being could possibly require.

<b>Floyd</b> |      Steph "Psych-o" Barnett -- for story ideas and all that important
<b>Floyd</b> |           rat-training info.
<b>Floyd</b> |      David "Astro" Walton -- for nitpicking above and beyond the call
<b>Floyd</b> | of duty.
<b>Floyd</b> |      David "OG" Learn -- for makin' Astro's nitpickin' look like
<b>Floyd</b> | nothin'.

<b>Floyd</b> |      Allison "Squeaky" Tumarkin -- for writing something even odder
<b>Floyd</b> | than
<b>Floyd</b> |           TAPESTRY.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Niki "Willow" Hinson -- for smartening up the parser by whining
<b>Floyd</b> | that
<b>Floyd</b> |           it was stupid.

<b>Floyd</b> |      Andy "The Boy" Olson -- for a million-and-one Bible references.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Audra "Oh I Had A Little Chicken" Senato -- for alpha-testing and
<b>Floyd</b> |           backup-singing.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Mike "Milk" Shultz -- for fitting me into his ever-busy schedule.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Erika "Erika" Stoll -- for putting up with my eccentricities long
<b>Floyd</b> |           enough to beta-test.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A BIG thank you to the IF Competition Betatesters:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |      Michael "The Legend" Kinyon -- Simply the best tester I've ever
<b>Floyd</b> | had the

<b>Floyd</b> |            pleasure to work with. Period.
<b>Floyd</b> |      "V. BALAVAGE" -- for great comments and a ton of information for
<b>Floyd</b> |            my NEXT game.
<b>Floyd</b> |      Also thanks to Charles Carr and Jarrod Henry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | This game was an attempt to see if a serious and interesting story
<b>Floyd</b> | could be merged with traditional IF 'puzzle' elements without one
<b>Floyd</b> | overshadowing the other. Also, I attempted to tackle a few of the
<b>Floyd</b> | issues that have been discussed recently on r.a.i-f, including
<b>Floyd</b> | mutually-exclusive paths, a pre-defined main character, moral dilemmas,
<b>Floyd</b> | 'puzzle-less' IF, and semi-realistic NPCs.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hope that I've come close to achieving my goals and have entertained
<b>Floyd</b> | you in the process. I would love to hear any and all comments or
<b>Floyd</b> | constructive criticism you may have. My current e-mail address can be
<b>Floyd</b> | found by using the 'AUTHOR' command.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your sight fails you. For that matter, you don't know if your eyes are

<b>Floyd</b> | opened or closed. Concepts like time and place have no meaning here.
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mind attempts to impose something, some order, some structure,
<b>Floyd</b> | upon the space in which you exist, and fails. There is only the void.
<b>Floyd</b> | For all you know, that is all there ever was.
