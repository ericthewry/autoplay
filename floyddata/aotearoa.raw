The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Aotearoa</i>, written by Matt Wigdahl.  <I>Aotearoa</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 Interactive Fiction Competiton, where it took first place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Aotearoa'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Polynesian Character Display Test:   *+ LM jk
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If the characters above are vowels with horizontal lines over them,
<b>Floyd</b> | your interpreter can properly display the special letters in this
<b>Floyd</b> | story. If not, you will need to change your interpreter's font to one
<b>Floyd</b> | that supports Polynesian characters. If you know your font already
<b>Floyd</b> | supports such characters, you may need to consider switching to an
<b>Floyd</b> | alternative interpreter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Interpreters known to function correctly with Aotearoa include (but are
<b>Floyd</b> | not limited to):
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Gargoyle (the 2009-08-25 build or newer)
<b>Floyd</b> | Zoom 1.1.4 or newer
<b>Floyd</b> | Filfre 0.987 or newer
<b>Floyd</b> | Quixe 1.0.2 or newer (using the CSS provided at
<b>Floyd</b> | [<A HREF="http://www.wigdahl.net/Aotearoa">LINK</A>] or the IFComp website)
<b>Floyd</b> | Other browsers based on Glulxe 0.4.4 or newer or Git 1.2.4 or newer
<b>Floyd</b> | should work as well.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fonts known to render well include (but, again, are not limited to):
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Linux Libertine (free for download and recommended if you have it)
<b>Floyd</b> | Georgia
<b>Floyd</b> | Palatino Linotype
<b>Floyd</b> | Times New Roman
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Known issues: The older, 2009-08-25 build of Gargoyle, out of the box,
<b>Floyd</b> | defaults to the Charter BT font, which is known to not support
<b>Floyd</b> | Polynesian characters. This can be fixed by changing the font settings
<b>Floyd</b> | in the garglk.ini configuration file to point to a font (such as one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the ones above) that does support the characters. The newest (2010.1)
<b>Floyd</b> | build of Gargoyle does not have this problem as it uses Linux Libertine
<b>Floyd</b> | by default.  And although Filfre supports the proper characters out of
<b>Floyd</b> | the box, it doesn't render them correctly. Regardless of the
<b>Floyd</b> | interpreter you use, you may need to configure it for best appearance.

<b>Floyd</b> | The waka floats in the deep ocean, the sun motionless and searing in
<b>Floyd</b> | the clear sky. Mui, the trickster, casts his fishing line into the
<b>Floyd</b> | depths of the ocean, tied to his magic hook made from a human jawbone.
<b>Floyd</b> | Almost immediately the hook catches, and he pulls up an enormous fish
<b>Floyd</b> | that somehow becomes, as you watch, an entire continent. On that new
<b>Floyd</b> | continent magnificent dinosaurs -- taniwha -- prowl the dark forests.
<b>Floyd</b> | Volcanoes dim the sky with smoke and stain the air with the stench of
<b>Floyd</b> | sulfur, but the land is rich and fertile, and Mui's older brothers
<b>Floyd</b> | look on it with greed in their eyes. Mui watches them, deep in
<b>Floyd</b> | thought, with a faraway expression you can't read. Then he turns to
<b>Floyd</b> | look directly into your eyes, and says, "You know that some of my
<b>Floyd</b> | brothers cannot be trusted. You must keep them from carving up this
<b>Floyd</b> | great fish until I return from the gods with the proper karakia."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And suddenly he's gone, flying away into the sun in the form of a
<b>Floyd</b> | seabird, and you're left floating in the waka with Mui's brothers as
<b>Floyd</b> | they smile secret half-smiles to each other and reach for their knives,
<b>Floyd</b> | and you wonder what in the world Mui thinks that you, twelve-year-old
<b>Floyd</b> | Tim Cooper, can do to stop them before they carve up and defile...

<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Adventure by Matt Wigdahl
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 100928 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> | Difficulty Level: Introductory            Cruelty Level: Polite
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *** First-time players should type ABOUT ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A hand gently shakes your shoulder, and the in-flight magazine falls
<b>Floyd</b> | off your chest as you startle awake. "Sorry, Tim. We've arrived," the
<b>Floyd</b> | stewardess says, and passes on. But the dreams don't leave with her,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the rest of the trip passes in a haze: the terminal; the tall Mori
<b>Floyd</b> | man with fierce tattoos on his face who greets you on arrival; the trip
<b>Floyd</b> | through unfamiliar streets to a Conservation Service cutter. In a way
<b>Floyd</b> | it's a good thing. If you had to think about what you're getting
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself into, you might be too afraid to go through with it. You stand
<b>Floyd</b> | on the prow of the small ship, fear and excitement swirling around
<b>Floyd</b> | inside you so you can hardly tell them apart. You're going to see real,
<b>Floyd</b> | live dinosaurs, and that's great, but you're alone and afraid, and
<b>Floyd</b> | nothing is familiar here, and that's... not great.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The man, Eruera, walks up to stand beside you, taking in the same view,
<b>Floyd</b> | shading his eyes with a powerful hand as he looks forward. The whipping
<b>Floyd</b> | ocean wind tries to carry his words away, and his accent is thick, but
<b>Floyd</b> | he has a friendly, open smile. "Don't worry about your flight getting
<b>Floyd</b> | delayed. We'll catch you up to the other group in no time." He studies
<b>Floyd</b> | your face, sees the concern. "Come now, you must be excited to start,
<b>Floyd</b> | yes? Everyone is! You are ready to work?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Excitement gets the upper hand for now and you grin just a bit -- you
<b>Floyd</b> | can't help it. "I still can't believe I got picked to come! I get to
<b>Floyd</b> | see real dinosaurs? That's so cool!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Eruera laughs, a startling, wild sound. "You may not think it is quite
<b>Floyd</b> | so 'cool' after picking through dinosaur roka for a few days, Tim."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You cock your head a bit, not quite sure you understood. "Roka"?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He just looks back at you silently, the friendly grin growing a bit
<b>Floyd</b> | wider.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Oh.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prow
<b>Floyd</b> | The cutter's hydrofoil brings the ship high out of the water -- high
<b>Floyd</b> | enough that there's very little spray. The wind whips past as the boat
<b>Floyd</b> | glides across the ocean off the coast to port. Thick, deep green bands
<b>Floyd</b> | of forest snake along the coastline to port. The treeline tracks
<b>Floyd</b> | stretches of black sand beach, sharp cliffs of dark volcanic rock, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the occasional salt marsh. The ocean glares as you look at the shore,
<b>Floyd</b> | almost overpoweringly blue.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A dark feather from some sort of seabird flutters in the wind, caught
<b>Floyd</b> | in a small gap in the guardrail.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear an incomprehensible yell from the general direction of the
<b>Floyd</b> | bridge. Eruera turns toward it, then closes his eyes for an instant. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | told them to double-check those gaskets," he sighs. "I'd better go help
<b>Floyd</b> | them before we're dead in the water."

<b>Floyd</b> | Aotearoa is an interactive fiction adventure story, designed to be fun
<b>Floyd</b> | for all ages!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Interactive Fiction" is a kind of writing that puts you, the reader,
<b>Floyd</b> | into the story as the main character! You make the decisions as to what
<b>Floyd</b> | your character will do and where to go by typing in instructions to the
<b>Floyd</b> | computer at the "&gt;" prompt. The story will then decide what happens
<b>Floyd</b> | next, tell you what happens, and then give you a chance to type in
<b>Floyd</b> | another instruction. Play continues in this way until you reach an end
<b>Floyd</b> | to the story. But remember that there might be several different
<b>Floyd</b> | endings, and some may be better, more successful, or more fun endings
<b>Floyd</b> | than others. You can always try different decisions in the story to try
<b>Floyd</b> | to reach different endings.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you have never played an interactive fiction story before, please
<b>Floyd</b> | read the "Instructions for Play" section in the main help menu for much
<b>Floyd</b> | more detailed advice on how to play and what kinds of commands the
<b>Floyd</b> | computer can understand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Aotearoa takes place in an alternate history where the ancient
<b>Floyd</b> | continent of Zealandia never sank below the waves in the late
<b>Floyd</b> | Cretaceous period, and retains its Mori name of Aotearoa. Many
<b>Floyd</b> | prehistoric and other extinct animals still live on the continent --
<b>Floyd</b> | including dinosaurs! And you, as the character of 12-year-old Tim
<b>Floyd</b> | Cooper, will have a chance to visit and interact with them!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Please note -- although the game depicts a fictional continent of
<b>Floyd</b> | Zealandia, and dinosaurs are involved in the game, great effort was
<b>Floyd</b> | made to remain faithful to the history and geography of the real New
<b>Floyd</b> | Zealand where possible, and to present an accurate picture of the
<b>Floyd</b> | language and culture of the Mori people. We hope you have fun and
<b>Floyd</b> | learn something new (maybe several somethings new) at the same time!

<b>Floyd</b> | For the most part, the standard IF verbs apply, but there are a few
<b>Floyd</b> | extra actions you can take that are fairly non-standard:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | RIDE will allow you to attempt to ride a vehicle or animal.
<b>Floyd</b> | Once you are on an animal, you can control it by trying to go FASTER or
<b>Floyd</b> | SLOWER, or turn LEFT or RIGHT.
<b>Floyd</b> | NAME will allow you to give an animal a nickname that will then be used
<b>Floyd</b> | in the text and be recognized by the parser.
<b>Floyd</b> | UNNAME will allow you to remove a nickname from an animal that already
<b>Floyd</b> | has one.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Additional meta-commands (commands that help you control the game
<b>Floyd</b> | without affecting the game world) are:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | THINGS will print out a list of all the items in the area that you
<b>Floyd</b> | might be able to interact with. Note that this will also include
<b>Floyd</b> | scenery and other things that only support limited interaction.
<b>Floyd</b> | EXITS prints out a list of the directions you can go from the area
<b>Floyd</b> | you're in.
<b>Floyd</b> | EXIT COLOR rotates through the available colors for the status line
<b>Floyd</b> | exit lister.
<b>Floyd</b> | EXITS OFF turns off the status line exit lister altogether.
<b>Floyd</b> | EXITS ON turns the status line exit lister back on.
<b>Floyd</b> | KEYWORDS brings up a menu that lets you change how object and topic
<b>Floyd</b> | keywords are presented.
<b>Floyd</b> | TUTORIAL MODE OFF turns off the built-in tutorial.
<b>Floyd</b> | TUTORIAL MODE ON turns on the built-in tutorial.
<b>Floyd</b> | SKIP will make the tutorial system skip the current step and move on to
<b>Floyd</b> | the next one.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Prow
<b>Floyd</b> | The cutter's hydrofoil brings the ship high out of the water -- high
<b>Floyd</b> | enough that there's very little spray. The wind whips past as the boat
<b>Floyd</b> | glides across the ocean off the coast to port. Gathering clouds dim the
<b>Floyd</b> | light, almost hiding the dark green bands of thick forest snaking along
<b>Floyd</b> | the coastline's inky beach and charcoal cliffs to port.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You spend a couple of minutes looking out over the ocean, watching the
<b>Floyd</b> | waves rise as dim lightning glows in the depths of the stormclouds and
<b>Floyd</b> | distant booms of thunder shake the air. It's a breathtaking scene, and
<b>Floyd</b> | for a moment you don't notice Eruera pushing through the wind from aft
<b>Floyd</b> | to stand beside you. He watches the approaching storm in silence with
<b>Floyd</b> | you for a moment as the light dims. "It looks like quite an wh coming
<b>Floyd</b> | our way. Perhaps you should come back in to the bridge before it hits.
<b>Floyd</b> | I would hate for you to get soaked and miserable before we even get to
<b>Floyd</b> | camp."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You consider it as the sky darkens further. It's not a bad idea. But as
<b>Floyd</b> | you start to agree, Eruera snaps his head up, startled by something in
<b>Floyd</b> | the distance to port, and cuts you off with a raised hand. "Tim, did
<b>Floyd</b> | you see..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Without warning, he seizes you in a powerful grip! In one smooth motion
<b>Floyd</b> | he wrenches you off of your feet and pitches you over the starboard
<b>Floyd</b> | railing, so quickly you don't even have time for a scream before you're
<b>Floyd</b> | tumbling towards the sea, arms pinwheeling. Just before you hit the
<b>Floyd</b> | water you catch a single brief glimpse of Eruera poised to leap, one
<b>Floyd</b> | hand on the railing and a wide-eyed look of panic on his face. Then you
<b>Floyd</b> | plunge into the ocean with a stinging jolt, seawater jetting up your
<b>Floyd</b> | nose and your limbs painfully forced into unnatural positions by the
<b>Floyd</b> | water's drag.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you tumble and slow, there's a terribly loud crash of thunder. You
<b>Floyd</b> | flounder, stunned, trying to remember your swimming survival lessons.
<b>Floyd</b> | By the time you orient yourself and manage to look around, it's all
<b>Floyd</b> | over. But everything has changed. The cutter is half-submerged and
<b>Floyd</b> | leaning way over on its side, a huge, ragged hole punched in its port
<b>Floyd</b> | side near the stern. Twisted pieces of deck and the remains of crates
<b>Floyd</b> | are strewn over the ocean, visible in brief peeks over the rolling
<b>Floyd</b> | waves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But even though the panic rises up and your breathing is shallow and
<b>Floyd</b> | fast, you know you have to stay afloat. You start paddling toward the
<b>Floyd</b> | ship, but before you can cover even half the distance it has sunk low
<b>Floyd</b> | in the water and you realize there's no point -- it will be gone before
<b>Floyd</b> | you can reach it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You tread water for a moment as you look around, thrashing your legs
<b>Floyd</b> | wildly to keep your head above water and continuing to force down the
<b>Floyd</b> | panic. It seems you've gotten turned around somehow -- which way was
<b>Floyd</b> | the coast?

<b>Floyd</b> | In the Ocean
<b>Floyd</b> | You are treading water alone in the ocean as a sudden summer storm
<b>Floyd</b> | drenches your face with sheets of rain. Lightning flashes and

<b>Floyd</b> | taste and the floating debris are the only reminders that there was a
<b>Floyd</b> | ship with a living crew skimming over this water just minutes ago. The
<b>Floyd</b> | rise and fall of the ocean waves all around you limit how far you can
<b>Floyd</b> | see, and the storm blocks out the summer sun like an eclipse.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the confusion, you lose your grip on what you were holding, and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You must be alive -- you feel too miserable to be dead. Despite your
<b>Floyd</b> | aching leg muscles and the burning sensation in your lungs you'd rather
<b>Floyd</b> | stay unconscious -- if it weren't for the surf slapping your face every
<b>Floyd</b> | few seconds, making you choke and splutter. Very reluctantly, you shove
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself up the beach a bit farther to get away from the tide. After
<b>Floyd</b> | what seems like another hour, you open your stinging eyes and look
<b>Floyd</b> | around. You're on a strand of black sand in a shallow bay, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | lying sky is now innocent blue and filled with harmless-looking, puffy
<b>Floyd</b> | clouds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Strand
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand on a thin strip of black sand lining the shallow curve of a
<b>Floyd</b> | bay to the east. A few seabirds fly overhead, and various clumps of
<b>Floyd</b> | driftwood, seaweed, and other shore debris litter the shore, the only
<b>Floyd</b> | visible evidence of the recent storm. A steep tumble of volcanic rock
<b>Floyd</b> | looms over the beach to the west and south, blocking travel in all
<b>Floyd</b> | directions except into the forest to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You slowly stagger to your feet, your battered body and abused muscles
<b>Floyd</b> | protesting all the while. You look around with a dull stare, not really
<b>Floyd</b> | understanding yet what you're seeing and unsure what to make of the
<b>Floyd</b> | black beach you stand upon. You wonder what happened to Eruera.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Thank you, Tim. That's much better!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He gathers strength for a minute, panting for air a bit after downing
<b>Floyd</b> | the water. Finally he beckons you closer. "Tim, I'm sure the cutter was

<b>Floyd</b> | illegally sneak ashore to capture the taniwha and sell them abroad. I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | not completely certain where we are at the moment, but if I'm right

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He grins and spreads his hands. "Obviously I'm in no shape for such a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He steels himself, then twists, reaches into the pile of debris, and
<b>Floyd</b> | pulls out a solid-looking metal case. A huge smile spreads over his
<b>Floyd</b> | face. "By blind luck, that crate we stumbled across in the ocean had a

<b>Floyd</b> | gotten your chance to see them yet, so I'll indulge your curiosity. In
<b>Floyd</b> | many ways, Tim, the taniwha are the living symbols of this whole
<b>Floyd</b> | nation. When the Mori first arrived in Aotearoa, they fought the
<b>Floyd</b> | taniwha simply to exist here. In those days, they covered the
<b>Floyd</b> | continent, for the most part, and weren't really willing to share it
<b>Floyd</b> | with humans."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "But eventually the Mori learned how to coexist with the taniwha, and
<b>Floyd</b> | even partially domesticate some of them. When the pkeh came, bringing
<b>Floyd</b> | guns and colonists and looking for land to clear and farm, the Mori
<b>Floyd</b> | met their firearms with kairkau mounted on taniwha. Their mana was
<b>Floyd</b> | strong -- the British guns had some effect, but the bony plates on the
<b>Floyd</b> | taniwha's heads served as shields and made the riders difficult
<b>Floyd</b> | targets. The pkeh were unable to simply take Mori land, but they
<b>Floyd</b> | weren't willing to give up. Years of fighting ensued, until Pitiroi --
<b>Floyd</b> | Robert FitzRoy -- was sent here from Great Britain and met with the
<b>Floyd</b> | great chiefs -- the rangatira -- and signed the Treaty of Waitangi."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The Treaty established a permanent state of alliance between Great
<b>Floyd</b> | Britain and Aotearoa. Mori sovereignty was guaranteed, but the pkeh
<b>Floyd</b> | were granted rights and brought into the iwi, or family, of Aotearoa.
<b>Floyd</b> | Many speculate that if the taniwha had not existed, we might have ended
<b>Floyd</b> | up like the aboriginal people of the Australian or American colonies --

<b>Floyd</b> | Animal Trail
<b>Floyd</b> | The ground cover has been pushed aside by passing animals just enough
<b>Floyd</b> | to make this weaving trail the path of least resistance. There is a
<b>Floyd</b> | very tall kauri tree here, its thick roots snaking in and out of the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground. You can hear swiftly running water from somewhere off to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north. To the southwest you can see the forest lighten as it thins out,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the trail forks here, continuing to both the northeast and the
<b>Floyd</b> | north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dina, who stands no taller than your shin, is nearby. She slowly moves
<b>Floyd</b> | from tree to tree, searching for something while always managing to
<b>Floyd</b> | keep you in view.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A shiny battery, apparently discarded or lost by someone, lies
<b>Floyd</b> | half-hidden by a pile of leaves that Dina is using as a nest.

<b>Floyd</b> | Streamside Tree
<b>Floyd</b> | You are perched on a fairly thick branch of a kauri tree about thirty
<b>Floyd</b> | feet above the ground, which is about as high as you can climb, and
<b>Floyd</b> | higher than you feel truly comfortable with anyway. Above this level
<b>Floyd</b> | the bark is too smooth to climb, and you can't imagine trying to climb
<b>Floyd</b> | any higher even if it wasn't. The branch extends north out over the
<b>Floyd</b> | river.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Across the river, you notice Nagi watching you climb with great
<b>Floyd</b> | interest. She hops onto what looks like a dead or dying kauri on the
<b>Floyd</b> | north bank, juggling her rock to try to keep hold of it. Nagi's tree
<b>Floyd</b> | appears to have some sort of major trunk damage near the ground, but

<b>Floyd</b> | that reaches south across the stream.

<b>Floyd</b> | The trail descends into a hollow here, free of trees. Centered in the

<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, there's kind of a mini-volcano in the middle of a clearing

<b>Floyd</b> | Eruera interrupts you, sounding amused. "Well, it probably is! There is
<b>Floyd</b> | a great deal of volcanic activity all over Aotearoa, and it certainly
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't be unusual to run across hot springs or a fumarole."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh! I didn't know they were that common. Are they safe?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Reasonably. Don't go jumping into one, but most of the time these
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't particularly active. They might lead to hot rock, somewhere
<b>Floyd</b> | below, but around here there's not much risk of a full-scale eruption."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "OK, thanks." You eye the moa as it paces back and forth, then click

<b>Floyd</b> | almost faster than you can track. Dina seems to win the fight, pinning
<b>Floyd</b> | Tony down and chirruping at him before releasing him to stand again.
<b>Floyd</b> | From there they move into some sort of complicated mating dance. From

<b>Floyd</b> | be cultivated over time. That you have this gift is... interesting."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You continue. "It looks like it might be itchy or something -- it keeps

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Eruera is silent for a moment. "I think I see. Let me tell you a brief
<b>Floyd</b> | story that might help you out. It's a legend about how the Mori first
<b>Floyd</b> | learned to tame the taniwha."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You wait, and in a moment he starts. "Long ago, the people came to Mui
<b>Floyd</b> | with a problem. 'Every year we plant kkmara -- sweet potatoes -- and
<b>Floyd</b> | take great care to guard them. We build tall fences to keep away the
<b>Floyd</b> | pkkeko -- the swamp hen -- and the old men chase them away night and
<b>Floyd</b> | day. Every year the kkmara grow, and every year we prepare for the
<b>Floyd</b> | harvest. And every year, the great taniwha come, break down the fences,
<b>Floyd</b> | and ravage our crop. We try to fight and chase them away, but they
<b>Floyd</b> | charge with heads down and scatter us like raindrops!'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | They pleaded with Mui to help them. 'We cannot continue to live when
<b>Floyd</b> | the taniwha eat most of our crops. Please, slay these taniwha and you
<b>Floyd</b> | may have anything you want as a reward.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mui agreed, saying 'I will end the threat of these taniwha for you,'
<b>Floyd</b> | for he had heard stories of the giant taniwha and had a plan."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Eruera pauses for a moment to catch his breath, then continues. "Mui
<b>Floyd</b> | lived among the people of the village as their honored guest all year,
<b>Floyd</b> | and there was much grumbling as the year went on, for Mui ate very
<b>Floyd</b> | well indeed and food was scarce.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But finally the harvest drew near, and Mui set forth for the fields to
<b>Floyd</b> | confront the taniwha. The villagers were confused, as he took no
<b>Floyd</b> | weapon, only a large sack. 'How can he slay the taniwha without a
<b>Floyd</b> | spear?' they asked themselves, and the grumbling grew greater. Finally
<b>Floyd</b> | the villagers sent a small boy to follow Mui to make sure he did what
<b>Floyd</b> | he had agreed to do and didn't just run away.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The boy saw something amazing. As the first of the taniwha approached,
<b>Floyd</b> | Mui stood still and silent. The taniwha stopped. Mui moved very
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly and smoothly, giving no offense to the great beast, and it
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't charge. Mui was able to walk right up to it and put his hand on
<b>Floyd</b> | it. Then Mui opened the bag, and inside were the kkmara he'd pretended
<b>Floyd</b> | to stuff himself with all year. As the boy watched, Mui pulled out a
<b>Floyd</b> | kkmara and fed it to the taniwha."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Eruera pauses for a few moments. "Hours later, the boy came running
<b>Floyd</b> | back into the village. But before he could explain what he had seen to
<b>Floyd</b> | the elders, Mui appeared, riding proudly on the back of the great
<b>Floyd</b> | taniwha, and tossed down the empty sack. The elders were furious. 'You
<b>Floyd</b> | agreed to slay the taniwha, and you bring it here into our village?'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'I never promised to slay the taniwha,' Mui responded. 'I have done
<b>Floyd</b> | what I promised. Remember my words. I have ended the threat of these
<b>Floyd</b> | taniwha to you.' The elders remembered, and although they were still
<b>Floyd</b> | furious, they had to agree that Mui had succeeded."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Eruera concludes, "So the point of that story is that these taniwha
<b>Floyd</b> | react well to friendliness. Approach them slowly and respectfully, and
<b>Floyd</b> | work out a way to scratch this one's itch, and you should be quite
<b>Floyd</b> | safe."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wow, Eruera, that's a cool story." You pause for a moment, thinking.
<b>Floyd</b> | It makes sense. But you do have one question. "So what did Mui choose
<b>Floyd</b> | as his reward?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can hear the smile in Eruera's voice. "That is a story for another

<b>Floyd</b> | He flicks one hand at the dinosaur without taking his eyes off you, and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fred surges to its feet, bellows, and crashes off through the forest as

<b>Floyd</b> | Poacher Camp
<b>Floyd</b> | You set out to the west, hoping to use the exodus of the dinosaurs to
<b>Floyd</b> | cover your escape, and staying low. As you near the outskirts of camp,
<b>Floyd</b> | you duck behind a partially-disassembled jeep for some cover.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The poachers' camp borders the wilderness here. Deep ruts in the ground
<b>Floyd</b> | mark the likely spot where their vehicle is parked when it's not in

<b>Floyd</b> | leads back into the forest, and you could also reach the forest to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southwest over a short rise and across a stretch of open field. The
<b>Floyd</b> | main portion of the camp is to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nagi is nearby, zigzagging back and forth as you run and occasionally
<b>Floyd</b> | surging towards the southwest before returning to circle you again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The dinosaurs are fleeing the camp, pursued by poachers with guns, who

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the west, a very shallow slope of mixed scree and debris leads up to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The trail descends into a hollow here, free of trees. Centered in the

<b>Floyd</b> | main danger isn't behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Kai a te kur+! Gotcha, you little troublemaker!" A tall Mori man
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing camouflage clothing and carrying a rifle rounds the corner
<b>Floyd</b> | directly ahead of you and grabs your shoulder, crunching the bones
<b>Floyd</b> | painfully. Almost before you realize what's happening, Nagi leaps onto
<b>Floyd</b> | your shoulder with a great bound and sinks her sharp little teeth into
<b>Floyd</b> | the man's hand! "hah, what the hell?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He whips his hand off your shoulder to smack little Nagi, evoking a
<b>Floyd</b> | screech of rage. You twist free, sprinting towards the forest to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north, hoping there aren't any more poachers ahead of you on the trail.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The narrow forest trail opens onto a small clearing here, where the
<b>Floyd</b> | kauri gives way to unhealthy-looking ferns and thin, yellowish grass.
<b>Floyd</b> | The trail leaves the clearing to both north and south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you continue, you hear a shout of rage, and then a horrible,

<b>Floyd</b> | second and risk a quick glance behind you. No sign of Nagi.

<b>Floyd</b> | You keep running, glancing to the side and over your shoulder, hoping
<b>Floyd</b> | to catch a glimpse of brown fur or beady yellow eyes, but you don't see
<b>Floyd</b> | anything. The forest seems silent, aside from the breath burning in and

<b>Floyd</b> | found earlier.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The breeze blowing the tops of the thickly-clustered kauri makes the
<b>Floyd</b> | few flashes of light dance and whirl around you. The trail is all but
<b>Floyd</b> | lost here. A tall, sheer, charcoal-gray ridge stretches as far as you
<b>Floyd</b> | can see from the east to the west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fred stands here, complacent and slowly munching plants with its
<b>Floyd</b> | powerful jaws as it watches you arrive, at a run and out of breath. It
<b>Floyd</b> | holds your gaze for a few eternal seconds, then slowly kneels down, as
<b>Floyd</b> | if in invitation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You stumble to a stop in front of the dinosaur. Maybe it's the fatigue

<b>Floyd</b> | double vision -- as the powerful lord of the forest, but also as the

<b>Floyd</b> | poachers' camp to the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The jeep closes, almost upon you. You can see the men on the sides
<b>Floyd</b> | moving frantically, likely getting their guns ready to shoot.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Poacher Camp (on Fred, facing southeast and running)
<b>Floyd</b> | The poachers' camp borders the wilderness here. Deep ruts in the ground

<b>Floyd</b> | wide, raising their hands in a futile instinctive attempt to ward off
<b>Floyd</b> | the charging beast. And then you're upon them, Fred's bony head
<b>Floyd</b> | slamming into the side of the jeep with a tremendous crash as you brace

<b>Floyd</b> | and sends men sprawling in all directions! You're thrown forward by the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The jeep's engine cuts out with a heavy sound of clunking metal, and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Center of Camp
<b>Floyd</b> | Fred barrels into the center of the camp in a berserk fury, charging at
<b>Floyd</b> | the tents and lashing out at the cages, whirling and stomping in a
<b>Floyd</b> | frenzy. You hold on for dear life, but when the taniwha rears and
<b>Floyd</b> | twists almost completely around, your grip loosens and you spin to the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground in a painful heap. You scramble to the side to avoid being
<b>Floyd</b> | trampled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This seems to be the center of the poachers' encampment. A banked
<b>Floyd</b> | campfire is in the center of a small cleared space here, a small, newer
<b>Floyd</b> | tent is set up to the north, and a collection of large cages is set to
<b>Floyd</b> | the south. To the east, a short trail leads down a slope to a beach,
<b>Floyd</b> | where the poachers keep their boats.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the general chaos you think you might again slip away unnoticed, but
<b>Floyd</b> | one of the cowering poachers to the west has apparently spotted you and
<b>Floyd</b> | is moving to intercept as Fred continues its destructive frenzy. You
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly shift to the side to avoid being stepped on, and consider your

<b>Floyd</b> | North Beach
<b>Floyd</b> | You scramble in what seems to be the only safe direction -- down

<b>Floyd</b> | being followed or not, but the chaos won't last forever. You scan the
<b>Floyd</b> | shoreline, evaluating your possible escape options.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This thin beach of grey sand curves around a shallow bay, with rough,
<b>Floyd</b> | broken rock blocking travel to the north and south. Waves lap at the
<b>Floyd</b> | shore in the mild breeze, rocking the boats moored here. A path rises
<b>Floyd</b> | up to the west towards the poachers' camp.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A fairly large and weathered transport ship is here, partially hidden

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A small speedboat, patched and covered with camouflage netting, is

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you move toward the shoreline, the poacher you noticed earlier
<b>Floyd</b> | crests the top of the ridge, rifle slung over his back. He scans the

<b>Floyd</b> | in a bit too much of a hurry to take much time going over the controls

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The armed man starts to run, visibly agitated. "Get away from the

<b>Floyd</b> | You grit your teeth, hoping the motor is fueled and ready to go, and
<b>Floyd</b> | stab the red ignition button. After a couple seconds of grinding, the
<b>Floyd</b> | motor roars to life and a wave of relief washes over you. You ease the
<b>Floyd</b> | throttle lever up to a middling range and pull away from shore just as
<b>Floyd</b> | the man with the gun reaches the beach at a dead sprint and levels his
<b>Floyd</b> | rifle at you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All of a sudden, you spot something small, furry and familiar sprinting
<b>Floyd</b> | through the poacher's legs and running toward the boat. As she reaches
<b>Floyd</b> | the shore, Nagi makes an impossible leap into the air, arms stretched
<b>Floyd</b> | out wide, towards the speedboat. And she almost makes it. She manages
<b>Floyd</b> | to grab at the back end of the boat, but ends up pulling the life
<b>Floyd</b> | preserver overboard and both she and it fall into the ocean.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As the boat moves out into the bay, Nagi and the life preserver float
<b>Floyd</b> | behind, but the line starts to silently spool out of its coil, and you
<b>Floyd</b> | notice the line's other end isn't tied to anything. In a short time, it
<b>Floyd</b> | and Nagi will be gone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You glance back to shore, just in time to see the flash of a shot that
<b>Floyd</b> | apparently missed you, since you still seem to be alive.
<b>Floyd</b> | The boat motors away from shore, further into the clear blue waters of
<b>Floyd</b> | the bay. The shoreline runs from north to south here, with nothing but
<b>Floyd</b> | the wide ocean to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nagi, sopping wet and struggling, hangs onto the life preserver with a
<b>Floyd</b> | deathgrip as the boat pulls away. The line attached to the life
<b>Floyd</b> | preserver continues to spool smoothly into the sea as the distance
<b>Floyd</b> | increases, but there's still some left.

<b>Floyd</b> | no shot but wild ones. You can feel a power -- strong mana surrounding

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nagi scampers forward and leaps onto your shoulder, dripping seawater

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The clearing is nothing but a light green dot in the darker green of

<b>Floyd</b> | believe it's over already; it seems like only a day or two since you
