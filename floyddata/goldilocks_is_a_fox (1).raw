The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Goldilocks Is A Fox!</i>, written by Jason Guest.  <I>Goldilocks Is a Fox!</I> was originally released as part of the 2002 ADRIFT Summer Comp, where it took second place. It went on to take first place in the 2002 ADRIFT End of the Year Comp, and it was also nominated for a Xyzzy in the category of Best Individual PC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Goldilocks_Is_A_Fox!'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What

<b>Floyd</b> | Lost in the forest
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm walking in a trackless wilderness of tall, straight trees whose
<b>Floyd</b> | mighty trunks remind me of the time I got lost among the Axminsters at

<b>Floyd</b> | In the garden
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
<b>Floyd</b> | in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
<b>Floyd</b> | attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
<b>Floyd</b> | more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
<b>Floyd</b> | horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
<b>Floyd</b> | into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
<b>Floyd</b> | and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.

<b>Floyd</b> | In the garden
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
<b>Floyd</b> | in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
<b>Floyd</b> | attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
<b>Floyd</b> | more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
<b>Floyd</b> | horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
<b>Floyd</b> | into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
<b>Floyd</b> | and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.

<b>Floyd</b> | In the bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply
<b>Floyd</b> | sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a
<b>Floyd</b> | tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a full sized snooker table. A
<b>Floyd</b> | narrow staircase leads down to the hall.
<b>Floyd</b> | A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.
<b>Floyd</b> | For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on

<b>Floyd</b> | In the kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have
<b>Floyd</b> | come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original
<b>Floyd</b> | features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits
<b>Floyd</b> | in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
<b>Floyd</b> | half the room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the dining table are a large bowl (which is empty), a medium-sized
<b>Floyd</b> | bowl (which is empty) and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.

<b>Floyd</b> | In the hall
<b>Floyd</b> | My first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three
<b>Floyd</b> | Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from
<b>Floyd</b> | every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew
<b>Floyd</b> | to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting
<b>Floyd</b> | trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of
<b>Floyd</b> | these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the
<b>Floyd</b> | bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to
<b>Floyd</b> | the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten
<b>Floyd</b> | bearskin rug.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the
<b>Floyd</b> | direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or
<b>Floyd</b> | I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'

<b>Floyd</b> | of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting

<b>Floyd</b> | designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A

<b>Floyd</b> | Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
<b>Floyd</b> | half the room.
<b>Floyd</b> | The Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the dining table are a large bowl (which is empty), a medium-sized

<b>Floyd</b> | Bear's private den, a place of sanctuary away from the rigours of
<b>Floyd</b> | family life. The walls are plastered with posters of football teams
<b>Floyd</b> | and pin-ups from 'Playbear.' A solid metal door, set into the western
<b>Floyd</b> | wall of the cave looks almost impenetrable. There's an electric socket
<b>Floyd</b> | in the wall next to the door. The large chair is now facing a

<b>Floyd</b> | room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.
<b>Floyd</b> | Two chairs are arranged around small coffee table; a large chair and a
<b>Floyd</b> | medium-sized chair. There used to be a tiny little chair but I'd
<b>Floyd</b> | rather not talk about it. There's a low-pitched hum coming from

<b>Floyd</b> | mire of their own porridge can rouse me from my sleep.
<b>Floyd</b> |   At just after noon I have a strange dream. Three ghostly bears, each
<b>Floyd</b> | with a pair of wings and holding a golden harp, float up through the
<b>Floyd</b> | bedroom floorboards. Papa Bear hovers above me like a translucent
<b>Floyd</b> | bear-shaped cloud, glaring at me through baleful yellow eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> |   'Who's been sleeping in my bed?' he growls, his hot, stinky breath
<b>Floyd</b> | on my face.
<b>Floyd</b> |   'Who's been sleeping in my bed?' snarls Mama Bear nudging her
<b>Floyd</b> | husband out of the way.
<b>Floyd</b> |   'Mater, Pater,' says Baby Bear who has obviously had the benefit of
<b>Floyd</b> | a public school education, 'it's patently obvious who has been
<b>Floyd</b> | sleeping in our beds, eating our porridge and destroying our
<b>Floyd</b> | furniture, since the shameless hussy is still sprawled across my cot.
<b>Floyd</b> | But it's all academic now - we're dead! The little monster got the
<b>Floyd</b> | better of us this time! Come, parents, I hear that heaven is full of
<b>Floyd</b> | succulent young ladies such as this and that the clouds are made of
<b>Floyd</b> | porridge!' With that the Three Bears float up through the ceiling and
<b>Floyd</b> | on to paradise.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few moments later, they're back again, wingless now and dropping
<b>Floyd</b> | like stones towards the fires of hell. The last I hear of them is the
<b>Floyd</b> | anguished cry
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'No! Please! Not the poker!'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |   I awake at around six, having had a full night's, or rather day's

<b>Floyd</b> |   That's if I can ever find my way out of the enchanted forest...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |   ...but that's another story! The important thing is, our plan
<b>Floyd</b> | worked! The Three Bears are no more and foxy young chicks are free to

<b>Floyd</b> | ending up as a Bondage Barbie for a family of furry freaks! Thanks for
