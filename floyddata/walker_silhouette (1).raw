The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Walker & Silhouette</i>, written by C.E.J. Pacian.  <I>Walker & Silhouette</I> was originally released in 2009.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Walker_%26_Silhouette'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | I clear my throat.  Everyone looks at me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm, uh, not really good at public speaking.  Graffiti is more my
<b>Floyd</b> | medium.  Okay, here goes.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Look, I know we're a right pair of misfits, but all we've ever tried
<b>Floyd</b> | to do is what we thought was right.  If we can help people who need
<b>Floyd</b> | help and don't often get it, then I think, you know, that'd be a real
<b>Floyd</b> | opportunity for us."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My voice sounds really squeaky.  I swallow.  "And, you know, maybe

<b>Floyd</b> | some people who don't think the Pharaoh cares about them will, you
<b>Floyd</b> | know..."  I trail off.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Haqikah raises an eyebrow.  At least Nate seems pleased with my little
<b>Floyd</b> | speech.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Very well," the Pharaoh's voice says.  "You shall bring My justice to
<b>Floyd</b> | the destitute and filthy in their narrow streets."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nate brushes his hair back from his eyes... and smiles.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | They step out of the museum side by side - the young man in the
<b>Floyd</b> | bowler, leaning on his cane; the young woman in the battered jacket,
<b>Floyd</b> | her hat brim low over her eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Our first case together," she says, "and we wrestle a mechanised
<b>Floyd</b> | squid and have an audience with the Pharaoh.  Is it always like this?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He looks thoughtful.  "Sometimes it's like this."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So... what now?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Tea", he says.  "There'll be crime and mystery soon enough.  Before
<b>Floyd</b> | all that, we need a cup of tea."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | They walk to the motor car in silence - the only sounds their
<b>Floyd</b> | footsteps and the low murmur of the city.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mine's with three sugars," she adds.
