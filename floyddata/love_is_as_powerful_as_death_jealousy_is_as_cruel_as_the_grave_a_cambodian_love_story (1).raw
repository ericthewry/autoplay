The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Love Is as Powerful as Death, Jealousy Is as Cruel as the Grave</i>, written by Michael Whittington.  <I>Love Is as Powerful as Death, Jealousy Is as Cruel as the Grave: A Cambodian Ghost Story</I> was originally released as part of the 2009 Saugus.net Halloween Ghost Story Contest, where it took third place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Love_Is_as_Powerful_as_Death,_Jealousy_Is_as_Cruel_as_the_Grave'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;

<b>Floyd</b> | Your wallet is far less important here in Cambodia than at home.  Your
<b>Floyd</b> | driver's license, bearing the name Roger West, would be useless to the
<b>Floyd</b> | police, as most of them can't read English, and no license is required
<b>Floyd</b> | to drive anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Like most ex-patriots, you keep your really important stuff - your ATM

<b>Floyd</b> | card and your passport, which contains your visa - safely at home.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cambodians use American money, mostly - paper dollars.  They use their
<b>Floyd</b> | own currency as small change.  4,000 reil to a dollar.  Or sometimes
<b>Floyd</b> | 4,400.  It depends on which way the transaction is going.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It makes you do a double-take.  Yes, indeed: Joe, of all people, is

<b>Floyd</b> | here, of all places, and he and Paridy are so absorbed in looking at

<b>Floyd</b> | middle of a story.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "When they are bad, they go to bad place.  They get no feed.  When

<b>Floyd</b> | You must throw it on the ground for dirty, or rot.  Rotted?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Paridy continues, "But they only can come out one day.  One day year.
<b>Floyd</b> | Very hungry then.  If their family not to monks, they can not eat one

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "So how does the family know the right day?"  Joe asks, speaking
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, yes," Paridy says, laughing.  "There are many pagoda in Cambodia.
<b>Floyd</b> | If the family go the wrong pagoda, they not get feed.  But the family
<b>Floyd</b> | talk monks.  Monks say what pagoda, what day.  Very important talk

<b>Floyd</b> | monks."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's a well-organized afterlife," Joe says.  Paridy doesn't

<b>Floyd</b> |
