					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</BR></BR>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often (but not always) takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions.  NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does.  NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.</br></br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Heist</em> written by Andy Phillips.
						<I>Heist</I> was released in 1997.  It was a Xyzzy Awards finalist for Best Puzzles and Best Individual Puzzle (for setting the digital clock).

<b>Floyd</b> | CHAPTER ONE: HAPPY FAMILY
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wet, tired and incredibly bored.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That just about sums up your present frame of mind. Standing in an
<b>Floyd</b> | almost empty churchyard in a ghostly nondescript town, all the while
<b>Floyd</b> | being soaked by constant rainfall, would be bad enough at the best of
<b>Floyd</b> | times.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What makes it even worse is the very fact you're here. An all too often
<b>Floyd</b> | forgotten niece at her uncle's funeral. You're starting to wish you
<b>Floyd</b> | hadn't made the long journey up north after all. It's not like Uncle
<b>Floyd</b> | Henry actually cared about anything except his money and his ego, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you just wish the priest would get on with this tiresome ceremony.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After it's finished you could go home, emptying any lingering thoughts
<b>Floyd</b> | of the selfish, arrogant man from your mind.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your uncle's final resting place is a simple hole in the ground. No
<b>Floyd</b> | decorations, no glossing over. Just a sloppily dug pit. You doubt he
<b>Floyd</b> | would have appreciated the ordinariness of it all. Uncle Henry was
<b>Floyd</b> | definitely a man in favour of the grand occasion.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can sense a feeling of pity in the priest's eyes as he looks
<b>Floyd</b> | straight at you, as if he is fully aware of the pain you have suffered
<b>Floyd</b> | over the past few years.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Entering the grave at this moment in time could hardly be recommended

<b>Floyd</b> | The priest takes one last look at the grave, making the sign of the
<b>Floyd</b> | cross on his chest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Amen."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The crowd of mourners begin to leave the graveyard one by one. It is
<b>Floyd</b> | only after they have all left that you become aware of a man loitering
<b>Floyd</b> | behind you. As the priest follows the crowd through the gates the man
<b>Floyd</b> | moves over to you, thrusting a curious envelope into your hands. In
<b>Floyd</b> | response to your bewilderment he can offer only a cryptic explanation.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A plain white envelope which to anyone else would seem so ordinary.

</b><b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; OPEN ENVELOPE</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You carefully open the envelope, and with equal caution remove the
<b>Floyd</b> | folded letter from inside. The envelope blows away in a sudden gust of
<b>Floyd</b> | wind. Your hands tremble slightly as you unfold the letter. The
<b>Floyd</b> | signature at the bottom almost makes you tear up the letter in an
<b>Floyd</b> | outburst of rage, but your curiosity gets the better of you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The words are almost perfectly written and the flowing blue ink
<b>Floyd</b> | contrasts brilliantly with the bright yellow background. You begin to
<b>Floyd</b> | read,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "My dear Elaine,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is with some regret that I look out of the back window of my flat
<b>Floyd</b> | across the street. The dirty run-down buildings beyond the pavement
<b>Floyd</b> | opposite seem almost fitting. I have become lost in the labyrinth, too
<b>Floyd</b> | late I have realised I had a family out there which needed more from
<b>Floyd</b> | me than what I gave them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You were always the brightest my dear. If anyone deserves my
<b>Floyd</b> | inheritance it is you. You have what it takes: the determination, the
<b>Floyd</b> | intelligence, and most importantly the finesse. But time grows short.
<b>Floyd</b> | I am unable to explain in detail what would undoubtedly be the coup of
<b>Floyd</b> | the century.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I beg you Elaine: take up the challenge and finish my dream for me.
<b>Floyd</b> | You will surely appreciate the danger, the sense of adventure. Maybe
<b>Floyd</b> | you will even find the final secret. If you decide to follow the same
<b>Floyd</b> | path as me, I wish you good luck. But I must warn you, it will not be
<b>Floyd</b> | easy. Even the first steps will require a certain degree of
<b>Floyd</b> | intelligence to overcome. I know in my heart that you will succeed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your dear Uncle,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (Signed) Henry Lambert.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | PS: Remember the rhyme: One, Two,......"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It takes a few moments to sink in. Defiance grips you, there is no way
<b>Floyd</b> | whatsoever you will become like him. The very idea of it is laughable.
<b>Floyd</b> | You, a thief? You wouldn't even know where to start. Then something
<b>Floyd</b> | happens. Perhaps in ten years time you will look back on this as the
<b>Floyd</b> | moment it all changed. Something within you makes you want to accept
<b>Floyd</b> | this challenge, to prove yourself. The raining seems to subside
<b>Floyd</b> | slightly. It looks as if the sun is about to come out from behind the
<b>Floyd</b> | clouds. Everything seems to be happening more slowly. The calmly
<b>Floyd</b> | delivered statement from the man disturbs your train of thought.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's time to make the choice."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The man tightens his long grey coat.

<b>Floyd</b> | The central part of town is fairly quiet. Only the occasional

<b>Floyd</b> | heads off to the north in the direction of a set of residential
<b>Floyd</b> | buildings.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the south side of the street is a store. From the steel shutters
<b>Floyd</b> | and armoured glass windows evidently it's a jewellers, and the shop is
<b>Floyd</b> | open for business.

<b>Floyd</b> | The central part of town is fairly quiet. Only the occasional
<b>Floyd</b> | pedestrian trudges wearily along the heavily littered pavement. While
<b>Floyd</b> | the main street runs from east to west, a somewhat more minor road
<b>Floyd</b> | heads off to the north in the direction of a set of residential
<b>Floyd</b> | buildings.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the south side of the street is a store. From the steel shutters
<b>Floyd</b> | and armoured glass windows evidently it's a jewellers, and the shop is
<b>Floyd</b> | open for business.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A solitary car moves along the main road, disappearing out of sight to
<b>Floyd</b> | the west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You must have been the last customer, for just after you leave the
<b>Floyd</b> | jeweller comes out of the front door and seems to spend an age locking
<b>Floyd</b> | it. Obviously he prides himself on his security. Satisfied that he has
<b>Floyd</b> | properly checked whatever devices he has in place to prevent people
<b>Floyd</b> | borrowing items from his store without permission, he walks off to the
<b>Floyd</b> | west. The tune he hums to himself becomes gradually softer as he
<b>Floyd</b> | disappears from sight.

<b>Floyd</b> | Kindness and love always seemed totally alien to your uncle, yet the
<b>Floyd</b> | interior of the flat where he spent his final days feels warm and
<b>Floyd</b> | cosy. Now that all his belongings have been taken away, the room has
<b>Floyd</b> | an aura of emptiness about it. All that remain are a comfy armchair
<b>Floyd</b> | and a cuckoo clock on one of the walls. The front door is to the west,
<b>Floyd</b> | while the rest of the flat is in the opposite direction.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The door to the flat lies invitingly open.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The three minutes the landlady gave you are almost up.

<b>Floyd</b> | With its poor lighting and wooden reception desk the entrance to this

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The building's landlady is in the middle of performing the unenviable

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another tourist has also found his way to the information desk. This
<b>Floyd</b> | one seems to be very frustrated.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You seem to have been spared the agony of a further encounter. An
<b>Floyd</b> | apologetic sign is on the counter next to a bowl of sweets.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The tourist turns round to greet you as you walk over to the desk.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hello there, I wish you the best of luck with these people here at
<b>Floyd</b> | the information booth. Their service leaves much to be desired. They
<b>Floyd</b> | haven't served Gordon Palmers since he's been here. And that's me if

<b>Floyd</b> | A crowd of tourists have gathered and seem to block your exit. You try
<b>Floyd</b> | to move away, but they are everywhere you turn. You seem to have been
<b>Floyd</b> | the unlucky one who got pushed to the front, and as a result will have
<b>Floyd</b> | to suffer the agony of being next to the tour guide while she drones
<b>Floyd</b> | on in a rather dull voice. You are one of the first people to be moved
<b>Floyd</b> | down the stairs as the gruelling torture commences.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Octagonal Chamber</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | The octagonal chamber is the room that stores the pride of the
<b>Floyd</b> | museum's collection. Everything considered of any value from trinkets
<b>Floyd</b> | of Ancient Rome, to a statue supposedly from the lost continent of
<b>Floyd</b> | Atlantis is present. The centrepiece is a well protected display case
<b>Floyd</b> | elevated on a wooden pedestal.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A museum tour guide is conducting her final duty for the day.
<b>Floyd</b> | Unfortunately this involves sharing her rather boring knowledge with
<b>Floyd</b> | you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The tour guide launches into her prerehearsed speech.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "For years this museum has prided itself on the excellence of its
<b>Floyd</b> | exhibits, and we have continuously striven to add only the finest of
<b>Floyd</b> | items to our collection."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A glass case in the centre of the room. It's on top of a wooden

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The woman pauses hoping for a round of applause, but realising she
<b>Floyd</b> | won't receive any she continues with her lecture.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Around the room you can see items from all over the world and across

<b>Floyd</b> | Seeing the rapidly decreasing interest of the tourists, the woman
<b>Floyd</b> | turns her attention to the central exhibit. She spends about five
<b>Floyd</b> | minutes talking about how the hollow octagon belonged to some Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | emperor, and then how it was recovered from his tomb. Eventually she
<b>Floyd</b> | reaches a point of some interest to you: the security measures.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Balcony</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You are on the south side of a balcony that runs around the entirety
<b>Floyd</b> | of the octagonal chamber which holds the museum's prime exhibit. A
<b>Floyd</b> | staircase just in front of you provides access to the floor below.
<b>Floyd</b> | Around the rest of the balcony are other less important collections
<b>Floyd</b> | which can be reached to the east and west. The corridor you entered
<b>Floyd</b> | this chamber by is to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of the tourists has dropped a block of vanilla ice cream at the

<b>Floyd</b> | This corridor seems to give the impression it is the most trodden in

<b>Floyd</b> | ornaments dangle far above your head. The north end of the corridor

<b>Floyd</b> | More often than not back gardens are an untidy mess of long grass and
<b>Floyd</b> | weeds, but this one is definitely an exception to that rule. Well
<b>Floyd</b> | trimmed hedges are in abundance, some have even been formed into
<b>Floyd</b> | realistic animal shapes. An impressive fountain lies eastwards from
<b>Floyd</b> | here, and the side of the house is to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The moment you enter the garden a fierce guard dog comes rushing
<b>Floyd</b> | towards you, growling with unpleasant undertones.
