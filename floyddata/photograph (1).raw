The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Photograph</i>, written by Steve Evans.  <i>Photograph</i> was originally released as part of the 2002 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took third place. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Photograph"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | You're seated comfortably, hunched forward in your armchair. The frame
<b>Floyd</b> | rests on your lap, cradled in both hands, the continuing focus of your
<b>Floyd</b> | attention.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You no longer sense change...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the periphery of your vision you see something of the room - the
<b>Floyd</b> | wood stove, a window. Beyond your field of view there is nothing but
<b>Floyd</b> | clutter and increasing irrelevance. You're pleased that you'll never
<b>Floyd</b> | have to look on any of it again.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The initial euphoria has subsided. Replaced by a sense of ease, of
<b>Floyd</b> | place, of things being, well... right.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It can't be long now...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Photograph' features many non-standard verbs and puts some standard
<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction verbs to different uses. Most instances of the
<b>Floyd</b> | latter should be self evident, but one new verb that requires special
<b>Floyd</b> | mention is CONSIDER (or synonyms such as THINK ABOUT, REMEMBER, WONDER

<b>Floyd</b> | ABOUT, etc). You can CONSIDER (or 'C') many of the objects, topics, and
<b>Floyd</b> | even abstract concepts in the story. This will sometimes provide useful
<b>Floyd</b> | background detail, but more importantly, its use at certain points is
<b>Floyd</b> | vital to the development of the plot. Also, CONSIDER-ing things at
<b>Floyd</b> | different times may produce different responses. So, CONSIDER and
<b>Floyd</b> | CONSIDER often.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of the verbs that have non-standard uses, one that warrants mention is
<b>Floyd</b> | WAKE. This verb may be used when your character is merely distracted or
<b>Floyd</b> | daydreaming and not actually asleep.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Conversation in 'Photograph' uses most of the standard constructs (eg:

<b>Floyd</b> | "ASK X ABOUT Y", "TELL X ABOUT Y", "ASK X FOR Y, "X, Hello", "SAY Y to
<b>Floyd</b> | X", etc.). However, there are other possibilities that can optionally
<b>Floyd</b> | be used, including MENTION Y TO X, DISCUSS Y WITH X, and so on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In short, if you think something should provide a sensible response
<b>Floyd</b> | even though the verb is not standard issue, then try it. If it doesn't

<b>Floyd</b> | work, then please send me a bug report.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Please note that the BRIEF and SUPERBRIEF print states have been
<b>Floyd</b> | disabled in this story. VERBOSE is therefore the only printing 'option'
<b>Floyd</b> | available.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Something else I should mention is that there are scenes that can be
<b>Floyd</b> | replayed within the story with different outcomes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It shouldn't be possible to put the story into an unfinishable state,
<b>Floyd</b> | and it is exceedingly unlikely that the player character will die
<b>Floyd</b> | during play. Dying is possible, but I'd be surprised if anyone manages

<b>Floyd</b> | to do it without resorting to decompiling the story file.

<b>Floyd</b> | that lit up her face and almost made you go weak at the knees. That

<b>Floyd</b> | night was the beginning of a tempestuous casual relationship.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nadia looks for the hidden beauty in everything and everyone; believing
<b>Floyd</b> | in astrology, the healing powers of crystals and reincarnation (to her
<b>Floyd</b> | everyone has been someone in a former life). You, on the other hand,
<b>Floyd</b> | consider yourself to be practical and down-to-earth. Despite your

<b>Floyd</b> | differences, you initially found Nadia's optimism refreshing - were
<b>Floyd</b> | almost prepared to believe that you had known each other previously (in
<b>Floyd</b> | a Biblical sense, and era) and enjoyed being called Akhnaten: "my
<b>Floyd</b> | little sun king" (to her Nefertiti).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Within a few months of meeting, it was Nadia - while remarking on your

<b>Floyd</b> | tenseness, offering short-term relief through massage, then telling you
<b>Floyd</b> | to "be true to the creature you are" - who gave you the impetus to
<b>Floyd</b> | return to the mountain.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You sold your business and moved together to a caravan on a steep block
<b>Floyd</b> | high in the foothills while building your bush home from mud brick,

<b>Floyd</b> | local stone and recycled materials. Later, to keep yourself busy, you
<b>Floyd</b> | began trading in second-hand furniture and junk (a passion for which

<b>Floyd</b> | house) and, much to Nadia's horror and chagrin, by cutting and selling
<b>Floyd</b> | firewood. ("Trees have feelings too, you know.")
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | But recently things have not been going well. Nadia is beginning to
<b>Floyd</b> | tire of your scepticism, and you, of the Bohemian world she inhabits.
<b>Floyd</b> | You frequently get on each other's nerves. She is sometimes away from

<b>Floyd</b> | Nadia pushes her way through the crowd and arrives at your stall. She's
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing a thin, ankle-length blue dress and is well bedecked with
<b>Floyd</b> | jewellery - gaudy paste rings, gold-coloured bangles and bands coiled
<b>Floyd</b> | around her bare arms and large lapis lazuli earrings shaped like asps.

<b>Floyd</b> | At her side is someone you haven't met. He's a youngish man, perhaps in
<b>Floyd</b> | his early twenties, tall and athletic - all chin, with a physique that
<b>Floyd</b> | looks as though it could have been carved from marble - and a crop of
<b>Floyd</b> | short dark curly hair. Nadia has a firm grip on his elbow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hello, Jack." (There's that smile.)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "'lo, Nadia. It's been a while. Are you going to introduce us?" You
<b>Floyd</b> | glance towards her companion.

<b>Floyd</b> | Downer."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hello, Mark."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Er...It's Michael, actually...," stammers Nadia's friend.

<b>Floyd</b> | "You're Mark Anthony," corrects Nadia, and he nervously shifts his

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I was Cleopatra, of course. Time moves on, Jack, and we must move with

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For once you find yourself lost for words. Looking away from Nadia's

<b>Floyd</b> | and for once not covered in clouds. The surrounding stalls have
<b>Floyd</b> | brightly coloured awnings, making yours appear somewhat drab in
<b>Floyd</b> | comparison. To the south a busker plays a violin, while from the north
<b>Floyd</b> | come the strains of South American folk music played on guitar and
<b>Floyd</b> | pan-pipes. Nearby, a man dressed as a clown twists balloons into animal

<b>Floyd</b> | shapes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's a hot day and the place is busy, though not for you. You haven't

<b>Floyd</b> | Nadia pushes her way through the crowd and arrives at your stall. She's
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing a thin, ankle-length blue dress and is well bedecked with
<b>Floyd</b> | jewellery - gaudy paste rings, gold-coloured bangles and bands coiled
<b>Floyd</b> | around her bare arms and large lapis lazuli earrings shaped like asps.
<b>Floyd</b> | At her side is someone you haven't met. He's a youngish man, perhaps in
<b>Floyd</b> | his early twenties, tall and athletic - all chin, with a physique that

<b>Floyd</b> | looks as though it could have been carved from marble - and a crop of
<b>Floyd</b> | short dark curly hair. Nadia has a firm grip on his elbow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hello, Jack." (There's that smile.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "'lo, Nadia. It's been a while. Are you going to introduce us?" You

<b>Floyd</b> | glance towards her companion.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "This is Mark," says Nadia. "He's an artist. Mark, meet Jack. Jack
<b>Floyd</b> | Downer."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hello, Mark."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Er...It's Michael, actually...," stammers Nadia's friend.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You're Mark Anthony," corrects Nadia, and he nervously shifts his
<b>Floyd</b> | feet.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "I see," you reply, then turning to Nadia - "And you are...?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I was Cleopatra, of course. Time moves on, Jack, and we must move with
<b>Floyd</b> | it. We had our share of good times, but now it's over. You know it as
<b>Floyd</b> | well as I. Mark and I are going up to the house to get my stuff. I came
<b>Floyd</b> | to say good-bye."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For once you find yourself lost for words. Looking away from Nadia's
<b>Floyd</b> | face your attention is drawn to the brass ankh she wears around her
<b>Floyd</b> | neck. She once bought it for you as a present, a symbol, as she put it,

<b>Floyd</b> | The light is fading fast. Tea coloured water cascades and swirls over

<b>Floyd</b> | track. You hear the harsh cry of a currawong. Although only twenty

<b>Floyd</b> | minutes from the car park, you could easily be many miles from
<b>Floyd</b> | civilisation. You would normally have been at ease in these
<b>Floyd</b> | surroundings, but you are not. For an instant, you see Melanie lying
<b>Floyd</b> | face down in the stream, water-boatmen in her raven hair, then you
<b>Floyd</b> | shudder and look ahead through the growing gloom.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "How's the knee?"

<b>Floyd</b> | The cottage is a log cabin with a grey shingled roof of untreated

<b>Floyd</b> | Melanie's knee, you share the cooking of a meal and eat together in
<b>Floyd</b> | silence.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Jack?" You glance up from your empty plate to find Mel looking at you
<b>Floyd</b> | intently, with those big dark eyes you know you could drown in. The
<b>Floyd</b> | anger has gone from her face, replaced by a more familiar gentleness.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Have we made up?" she asks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I guess so," you reply, without conviction.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, here we are then," she says. "And there's no TV. So, how about
<b>Floyd</b> | bed?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You lie in bed watching Mel undress, admiring her pale skinned beauty.
<b>Floyd</b> | Your resolve does not waver on contact with her softness, the touch of

<b>Floyd</b> | her breasts and thighs, her smell. Her fingers press into your back,
<b>Floyd</b> | yours into hers, feeling the outline of her ribs and arch of her spine
<b>Floyd</b> | as you move together. "Careful of my knee." You enjoy each other's
<b>Floyd</b> | presence and bodies, with a tenderness and sureness that comes from
<b>Floyd</b> | knowing one another well. But only you know it will be for the last
<b>Floyd</b> | time. Later, lying close:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Do you love me, Jack?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You know I do." (How could you have doubted it?)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So are you ready to go ahead with it? Are you finally ready to move

<b>Floyd</b> | out of that dump of yours and show some commitment to this
<b>Floyd</b> | relationship?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's late, Mel. Sleep now. We'll talk about it in the morning."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Uh-uh, Jack Downer. You don't get out of it that easily. We'll talk

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You break the news the next morning while packing the car ready to

<b>Floyd</b> | fixing her attention on putting things in boxes, then the boxes in the
<b>Floyd</b> | car. The silence grows as you drive back towards town, finally erupting
<b>Floyd</b> | into a heated argument, ending with the last words ever spoken between

<b>Floyd</b> |

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | It's difficult to say when the wheels started falling off your life.
<b>Floyd</b> | You were fine when Nadia left you. Your depression came years later,
<b>Floyd</b> | the onset gradual and seemingly without cause. You began to withdraw
<b>Floyd</b> | from the things and people around you, as though a filter had been
<b>Floyd</b> | placed between you and the rest of the world, or perhaps a small rip

<b>Floyd</b> | had developed in the fabric that bound you to it. Your fondness for the
<b>Floyd</b> | bush and those of the local community began to pale, and your
<b>Floyd</b> | recollections became tinged with sadness and regret. Over time you
<b>Floyd</b> | found it more difficult to keep your mind focused and you developed a
<b>Floyd</b> | propensity for self-doubt - doubts that led to failures, perceived as
<b>Floyd</b> | well as actual, that further fuelled your lack of confidence.

<b>Floyd</b> | Eventually, you fell into a descending spiral of despondency and
<b>Floyd</b> | despair, and the small rip in the fabric of your existence became a
<b>Floyd</b> | gaping rift.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | By the time you realised something had gone wrong, you were already
<b>Floyd</b> | powerless to do anything about it, and had nothing left to fight with.

<b>Floyd</b> | While still physically fit, you were an emotional cripple. And in this
<b>Floyd</b> | state, you would sit in your armchair for hours on end, wrestling inner
<b>Floyd</b> | demons, rerunning the events of your life in your mind, looking for
<b>Floyd</b> | someone or something to blame, before ultimately deciding that at some
<b>Floyd</b> | point in your life...

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The discovery of the photograph had been largely fortuitous. Some time
<b>Floyd</b> | after the onset of your depression, you had been sitting in your
<b>Floyd</b> | armchair feeling choked by the clutter that surrounded you and had
<b>Floyd</b> | resolved to do something about it. Your clean up began with a dust
<b>Floyd</b> | covered cardboard box of old possessions from before your return to the

<b>Floyd</b> | mountain, and that was as far as you got. As you went through the
<b>Floyd</b> | contents of the box you came across a number of photographs scattered
<b>Floyd</b> | loose, among them the photo of Melanie and yourself at the waterfall.
<b>Floyd</b> | For a moment you had trouble recalling the photograph, where it had
<b>Floyd</b> | been taken, and even who the girl was that you were with. Then you
<b>Floyd</b> | remembered, and were instantly overwhelmed by feelings of melancholy

<b>Floyd</b> | and nostalgia. It was an almost palpable experience, like breaking open
<b>Floyd</b> | an exotic fruit and being immersed in the smell of its rich fleshy pulp
<b>Floyd</b> | - sickly sweet, but turning at the core. The scene in the photograph,
<b>Floyd</b> | which you had barely given a thought for years, was instantly
<b>Floyd</b> | transformed into a pivotal moment; while only one point in the millions
<b>Floyd</b> | that had made up your life, for you it became the critical one, the

<b>Floyd</b> | point where your life had started to go wrong.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | As you bathe you notice that the sensation of impeded movement is still

<b>Floyd</b> | though your mind and body are operating at different speeds, with
<b>Floyd</b> | messages from your brain taking time to filter through your nervous
<b>Floyd</b> | system.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | After you've bathed and dressed you pick up the photograph, then take
<b>Floyd</b> | it to the armchair and sit with it on your lap. The couple at the
<b>Floyd</b> | waterfall are now facing each other. Melanie has her mouth open and you
<b>Floyd</b> | are now sure you can see the movement in the picture, although it is
<b>Floyd</b> | agonisingly slow. She is speaking and you silently mouth the words in

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, you go. I'll wait here."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sweat pours from your hands and forehead and your heart is in your
<b>Floyd</b> | mouth as you watch for over an hour while the image of your younger

<b>Floyd</b> | self removes the day pack from his shoulder and hands it to Melanie. As
<b>Floyd</b> | the broad grin begins to appear on the face of the boy, you desperately
<b>Floyd</b> | wish you could reach into the scene to wipe away the conceited
<b>Floyd</b> | expression and shake some sense into the young fool. You wait with
<b>Floyd</b> | resignation for the boy to turn and start up the track to the top of
<b>Floyd</b> | the falls, but for a long time he just stands there unmoving - then by

<b>Floyd</b> | degrees he moves towards the girl and puts his arm around her waist.
<b>Floyd</b> | Only when the boy has taken the pack and the pair begin walking back

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Melanie and your younger self are eating a meal in the cottage. You
<b>Floyd</b> | watch every mouthful of food as it leaves the plate to their mouths,
<b>Floyd</b> | then the empty forks return to the plate, and you see Melanie's
<b>Floyd</b> | inquiring gaze well before it is noticed by the boy. Then you smile to
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself as the boy looks up into those big dark eyes you know he must
<b>Floyd</b> | drown in, and follows the girl to the bedroom. As voyeur you are with

<b>Floyd</b> | them as they make love, and afterwards you watch them talk in soft
<b>Floyd</b> | tones and laugh at shared jokes as they lie in each other's arms. By
<b>Floyd</b> | the time they are packing the car ready to return to town the scene in
<b>Floyd</b> | the picture is changing at life speed, and you feel as though you are
<b>Floyd</b> | there as they chat and joke on the journey in the car. You tense as
<b>Floyd</b> | they approach a forested turn, anticipating the screech of brakes and

<b>Floyd</b> | thud of impact, but then relax as they round the bend without incident.
<b>Floyd</b> | The pace of the unfolding scene continues to increase. And as the world
<b>Floyd</b> | in the photograph gains momentum you are increasingly aware of things
<b>Floyd</b> | around you slowing down. You have no difficulty in following the
<b>Floyd</b> | couple's return to the city, the boy moving in with Melanie, and
<b>Floyd</b> | something of their first days of living together. While the scene is

<b>Floyd</b> | soon moving too quickly to follow, you know what will happen. You know
<b>Floyd</b> | that you will stay in your legal practice, that you and Melanie will
<b>Floyd</b> | have children, that your lives together will be happy. You have been
<b>Floyd</b> | there many times in your mind and don't need the visual confirmation.

<b>Floyd</b> | father, and now of course it was too late. It had been two weeks since

<b>Floyd</b> | his death and still she hadn't cried. She knew she should feel guilty,
<b>Floyd</b> | but somehow was more angry that he had chosen her eighteenth birthday
<b>Floyd</b> | as the day to have a massive cardiac arrest. She was also angry that
<b>Floyd</b> | all chance had now gone for him to make up for those broken promises;
<b>Floyd</b> | of getting back from work in time to help with her homework, or of
<b>Floyd</b> | spending some time with her, or just showing some interest in her life.

<b>Floyd</b> | Instead he had spent all his time working himself into an early grave
<b>Floyd</b> | at age forty-two. Heather sat cross-legged on the floor, helping her
<b>Floyd</b> | mother sort through her dad's things. She had before her a cardboard
<b>Floyd</b> | box of some of his older possessions, childhood books, photos, a tennis
<b>Floyd</b> | racquet, and was saddened to think that he once had a life like anybody
<b>Floyd</b> | else's, with interests and hobbies. If only things could have been

<b>Floyd</b> | different. She brushed away strands of her long black hair that had
<b>Floyd</b> | fallen forward into her eyes, and a tear with them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hey, mum. Who's this old wrinkly?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Melanie Downer was on the other side of the room and came across to

<b>Floyd</b> | look at the framed photograph in her daughter's hand. "I don't know,
<b>Floyd</b> | dear. Perhaps it was a relative of your father's. I can certainly see a
<b>Floyd</b> | resemblance. Although, I don't remember Jack ever talking about having
<b>Floyd</b> | close family."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "A relative? Do you think so? Look at the way he's sitting there in

<b>Floyd</b> | that disgusting old chair, with all that junk everywhere, just staring
<b>Floyd</b> | like that. It gives me the creeps. I don't want it in the house. Can I
<b>Floyd</b> | toss it?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I suppose so, we can't keep all his things. It's a nice frame though,
<b>Floyd</b> | Baltic pine by the look of it. Keep that. You can put the photograph

<b>Floyd</b> | over there with his appendix. I don't know why he kept that either,"
<b>Floyd</b> | Melanie said pointing to a jar containing a small shrivelled object.
<b>Floyd</b> | "They can go out together."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...and await the arrival of the boat of Ra.
