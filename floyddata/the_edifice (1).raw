The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>The Edifice</i>, written by Lucian Smith.  <i>The Edifice</i> was originally released as part of the 1997 IF Competition, where it took first place. It went on to garner Xyzzy nominations for Best Game and Best Individual NPC, and took home the Xyzzies for Best Puzzles and Best Individual Puzzle (for the language puzzle).  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Edifice"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | The main feature of this area of the grassland is a large, squat,

<b>Floyd</b> | Some day, this will be little more than a rise in the countryside.

<b>Floyd</b> | Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the

<b>Floyd</b> | The land here is divided by a stream, which has collected to form a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Weeds and long grasses choke the sides of the pool all around, but a
<b>Floyd</b> | long, flat rock juts out into the pool. The sun shines through a gap in
<b>Floyd</b> | a tree to the north, bathing the rock in sunlight.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as
<b>Floyd</b> | it whispers over the water.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sitting on Flat Rock you see a handful of grass, some twisty branches,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Inside Hut
<b>Floyd</b> | You are inside the hut where it seems you have lived all your life. You
<b>Floyd</b> | live here with Grandmother (your Mother), Wife, and Son. The normally

<b>Floyd</b> | homey smell you associate with this place is currently masked by the
<b>Floyd</b> | smell of sickness. Stray light and fresh air come in around a
<b>Floyd</b> | hide-covered doorway, back to the west, but they do little to mask the
<b>Floyd</b> | sense of dread and concern that hangs over everyone in this room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A hushed conversation is coming from the two women of the house, as

<b>Floyd</b> | they do what they can for your boy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Grandmother looks up as you enter, and you proudly display the Fever
<b>Floyd</b> | Leaf. Not much time is spent on congratulations, however, as you are
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly given the task to build a fire and boil some water.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The next several hours are an anxious blur. The fire is built, a tea is
<b>Floyd</b> | prepared, and carefully spooned to Son. After that, there's not much
<b>Floyd</b> | more you can do, and the three of you take turns through the night
<b>Floyd</b> | staying up and changing wet rags on Son's forehead. Finally, the next
<b>Floyd</b> | morning, Son stops mumbling and coughing, and falls into a truly
<b>Floyd</b> | restful sleep. A few hours later, Grandmother announces that his fever

<b>Floyd</b> | has gone down, and you and Wife nearly cry with relief.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just then, there is movement near the Hut door, so you grab your weapon
<b>Floyd</b> | and see what it is. You throw back the hide doorway and see, to your
<b>Floyd</b> | surprise, Stranger standing there, with his son.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Selme?" he asks, hesitantly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "A selme," you reply, with relief. "Ne rema y akne." You hesitate a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment, not knowing the right words, and finally give up, and finish,
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thank you."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Stranger thinks for a second, then hazards, "Well-come?" The two of you
<b>Floyd</b> | exchange huge smiles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the end, Son does indeed get better, and he and Stranger's Boy
<b>Floyd</b> | become good friends.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | River
<b>Floyd</b> | Here, a river wider across than you can throw a stone flows past. You
<b>Floyd</b> | sometimes catch fish here, and your son loves to come here and skip
<b>Floyd</b> | rocks across the river's surface. Many white-barked trees grow close to
<b>Floyd</b> | the river's edge here, of a different variety than you usually see in
<b>Floyd</b> | the depths of the forest.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The two children are here, laughing and playing together next to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Wife is here, watching the two kids.

<b>Floyd</b> | Village
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the small Village you seem to lead. It consists of several

<b>Floyd</b> | down in the Canyon, trying to learn how to ride a Horse like you did.

<b>Floyd</b> | The ground slopes down to the northeast, and a path leads along a ridge
<b>Floyd</b> | to the northwest. A small stream collects here, and follows the slope
<b>Floyd</b> | down to the northeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your own hut is just to the west, slightly larger than the others.

<b>Floyd</b> | Level One
<b>Floyd</b> | Green sunlight filters in from the west through the open recess,

<b>Floyd</b> | illuminating a small, round room, simple but totally foreign to you. A
<b>Floyd</b> | staircase (when did you learn that word?) winds up along the curved
<b>Floyd</b> | wall to another level above you, and, oddly, another doorway leads
<b>Floyd</b> | east, as if it would lead back into the forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You see etchings on the wall here, pictures of a grassland with a

<b>Floyd</b> | stream running through it, which stretch around the entire room, from
<b>Floyd</b> | the doorway to the staircase.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The simple door is open. Oddly, you see grassland on the other side,

<b>Floyd</b> | Near the Arch
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, this certainly isn't the Forest you've come to know and love. You
<b>Floyd</b> | are standing in the middle of a vast grassland, broken only by the

<b>Floyd</b> | you can see back into the dimly-lit Edifice to the west, a sharp
<b>Floyd</b> | contrast to the bright sunlight all around you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water away to the
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of smoke as
<b>Floyd</b> | it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you pass through the arch, the door closes behind you. You watch in
<b>Floyd</b> | wonderment as it shimmers, then disappears from view. You wander around

<b>Floyd</b> | the spot where it was, but absolutely nothing remains--even the grass
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to have grown up where the arch's posts once stood. Finally, you
<b>Floyd</b> | turn and make your way across the grassland to the place you suddenly
<b>Floyd</b> | remember is home,...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the next panel, the two men are conversing. It seems the first is
