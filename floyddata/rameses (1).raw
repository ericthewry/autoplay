The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Rameses</i>, written by Stephen&nbsp;Bond.  <i>Rameses</i> was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Competition, where it took thirteenth place.  It was also nominated for several Xyzzy Awards: Best Use of Medium, Best NPCs, Best Individual PC, Best Story, Best Writing, and Best Game.  It ultimately took home a Xyzzy for Best Individual PC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/922"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing these games, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played these games, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | I am standing on the platform of a railway station - it's miserable,

<b>Floyd</b> | it's damp, and all the seats are taken by stuck-up grannies and biddies
<b>Floyd</b> | and ghastly yacht-clubbers. While waiting for the train, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | taking ages, I peer over to the opposite platform, and notice a
<b>Floyd</b> | familiar figure. I can't believe it! It's Daniel! After all these
<b>Floyd</b> | years! But he hasn't noticed me yet. Barely able to conceal the joy in
<b>Floyd</b> | my voice, I step over to the edge of the platform and shout "Daniel

<b>Floyd</b> | Maguire! What the FUCK are you doing here?" And he notices me and
<b>Floyd</b> | shouts "Alex Moran, would you ever shut the FUCK up, you cross-eyed
<b>Floyd</b> | WANKER!" And I reply "Go FUCK yourself, ASSHOLE!" and he replies "Suck
<b>Floyd</b> | me off, you BENT BASTARD!". And the two of us run up and down the
<b>Floyd</b> | platforms, joyously shouting abuse at each other across three lines of
<b>Floyd</b> | track. And all the stuck-up grannies and biddies and ghastly

<b>Floyd</b> | yacht-clubbers waiting at the station stare at us as if we are mad. But
<b>Floyd</b> | we carry on, running up and down, screaming profanities, and let the
<b>Floyd</b> | rest of the world GO FUCK ITSELF!

<b>Floyd</b> | Dormitory Room (on my bunkbed)

<b>Floyd</b> | I wake up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With horror I realise that I'll have to spend another day in St. Enda's
<b>Floyd</b> | college. A familiar fact I have to face each morning - but four years
<b>Floyd</b> | here have not made it any easier to face. St. Enda's - how I have come
<b>Floyd</b> | to despise this place. A decrepit old red-brick shagpile which has

<b>Floyd</b> | become the focal point of this filthy little town in the arse-end of
<b>Floyd</b> | nowhere. The cheapest boarding school in the country, probably, but
<b>Floyd</b> | also surely the most pompous and inflated. A haven for the worst kind
<b>Floyd</b> | of social climbers, parvenus, thick, ignorant farmers' sons...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With horror I also realise that I am an asshole. Another familiar fact,

<b>Floyd</b> | and the last seventeen years have given me little reason to doubt it. I
<b>Floyd</b> | could happily pick apart my faults all day - I'm too short, too shy,
<b>Floyd</b> | indecisive, and uncharismatic. And I've got terrible posture.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The dormitory is a small, frequently claustrophobic room that somehow
<b>Floyd</b> | fits four bunkbeds, which are stacked up on opposite walls. There is a

<b>Floyd</b> | sink in one corner and an old wardrobe in another. The doorway leads
<b>Floyd</b> | east. A solitary window allows a cold light into the room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On Wayne's bunkbed is Wayne.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On Paddy's bunkbed is Paddy.

<b>Floyd</b> | miserable lapdog of Gordon, a sort of feeble court jester, constantly

<b>Floyd</b> | making up jokes and thinking of new ways to entertain his master.
<b>Floyd</b> | Gordon rewards this behaviour by ignoring Wayne anytime his rugby pals
<b>Floyd</b> | are around. Wayne seems to accept this treatment, as if it were part of
<b>Floyd</b> | the natural order of things, hoping that one day Gordon will accept him
<b>Floyd</b> | into his clique on an equal footing.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Wayne is an asshole, in other words.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He's also an asshole. Well, maybe that's a bit harsh - it's just that I

<b>Floyd</b> | call everyone else an asshole, and if I didn't call Paddy an asshole,
<b>Floyd</b> | you might think I liked him or something. Which I don't. You see, Paddy
<b>Floyd</b> | is a terrible bore. He never says anything that hasn't been said about
<b>Floyd</b> | ten times already by other people. His friends are all timid, boring,
<b>Floyd</b> | fat people like him, and when they get together they talk in timid,
<b>Floyd</b> | quiet, frightened voices about really boring things. Paddy and his

<b>Floyd</b> | friends are harmless, really. They're just not the kind of people I
<b>Floyd</b> | want to hang around with.

<b>Floyd</b> | Gordon struts into the room, fresh and dripping from the shower. He is
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing nothing apart from a towel which is wrapped loosely around his
<b>Floyd</b> | waist. Very loosely around his waist. As he walks in, the towel falls
<b>Floyd</b> | off. He tries to make out it was an accident, but it obviously wasn't.

<b>Floyd</b> | And this year, he became a member of the St. Enda's under-18 rugby

<b>Floyd</b> | Declan the Seminarian is an asshole. He tries to be too friendly with

<b>Floyd</b> | "Really?" says Wayne. "Who's the lucky fella?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't know her name yet. Ferdia knows her." Ferdia is my 'best
<b>Floyd</b> | friend'. You'll meet him soon. "Ferdia is coming as well, with another

<b>Floyd</b> | convincing.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Are you sure Ferdia is telling the truth about these girls?" says

<b>Floyd</b> | and have his way with you..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Where are you going with them?" says Gordon, ignoring him.

<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't know that yet either. I'm meeting Ferdia in the dining hall

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And so on. But I can't listen to them anymore. All I can think about is
<b>Floyd</b> | tonight. I'm a bit nervous about meeting these girls. I know I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | seventeen and all, but, to tell the truth, I haven't ever been out with
<b>Floyd</b> | a girl before. I haven't even spoken to a girl for so long. What will I

<b>Floyd</b> | say? What will I do? I know I'm going to make an absolute asshole of
<b>Floyd</b> | myself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Girls frighten the shit out of me, to be honest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I remember when I was fourteen, when we all went back to school after

<b>Floyd</b> | the summer holidays, and everyone was suddenly talking about girls. And
<b>Floyd</b> | not in the way we'd usually snigger - everyone was now talking about
<b>Floyd</b> | them in a serious way. Girls they kissed, girls they fancied, meeting
<b>Floyd</b> | girls in discos. And I remember feeling bewildered, nauseated - I
<b>Floyd</b> | really didn't want any of this to be happening. It's not that I was
<b>Floyd</b> | jealous of anyone - I wasn't - I just didn't even want them to be

<b>Floyd</b> | interested in that sort of thing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was like being suddenly thrust into an uncertain, dangerous world -
<b>Floyd</b> | a world of aftershave, hairiness and croaking voices, a world of
<b>Floyd</b> | constant worrying, a world of acne, Adidas and Calvin Klein. And I
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't want any of it. I wanted to be twelve again, when I was innocent

<b>Floyd</b> | and free, and happy. I wanted to be twelve again and be with Daniel,
<b>Floyd</b> | and we'd roam through forests and climb rocks and explore the
<b>Floyd</b> | countryside, and everything would be full of mystery and magic. And
<b>Floyd</b> | we'd sneak into a hay-barn and tell each other stories and he'd teach
<b>Floyd</b> | me bad language. And we'd shout out swear-words at the top of our
<b>Floyd</b> | voices, where no-one would hear us. "Go fuck yourself, asshole!" he'd

<b>Floyd</b> | say, and I'd say "Fuck you, you bent bastard!" and we'd go on like
<b>Floyd</b> | that, shouting for ages, and we could say anything we wanted, and do
<b>Floyd</b> | anything we wanted, and we didn't worry about a single thing in the
<b>Floyd</b> | whole fucking world.

<b>Floyd</b> | Sometimes I am surprised by the ferocity of my hatred for Ferdia. At

<b>Floyd</b> | screams "Look at me! Look at how great I am! Look at me!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And whenever we speak, it's as if Ferdia is demanding that I

<b>Floyd</b> | acknowledge all his perfections and concede his superiority in all
<b>Floyd</b> | things. So most of the time he feels less like a friend and more like a
<b>Floyd</b> | leech, drawing all of my attention, sucking away at my self esteem.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But I'm starting to rant - so let's just listen to him:
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Okay then," he continues, "Well, we're meeting at half five. Alice is
<b>Floyd</b> | coming along, and she's bringing her friend, who's called Claire. Alice

<b>Floyd</b> | I had a friend once. A real friend, not a parasite like Ferdia. Someone
<b>Floyd</b> | with whom I could be myself, someone with whom I could relax, someone
<b>Floyd</b> | with whom I could share my hopes and dreams.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | His name was Daniel Maguire. I first met him when I was ten years old,
<b>Floyd</b> | before I went to St. Enda's, when I was going to the local primary

<b>Floyd</b> | school out in the country. He was the new boy in class, and for no
<b>Floyd</b> | apparent reason he was very nice to me. We became friendly, and pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | soon we became inseparable. Whenever we were together, it was so
<b>Floyd</b> | special! I remember the summers we had...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I can honestly say that the only times I felt free, the only times I

<b>Floyd</b> | felt liberated from all my inhibitions, were the times I spent with
<b>Floyd</b> | Daniel. We didn't have any secrets from each other. I didn't have to
<b>Floyd</b> | feign interest in anything just to please him, I didn't feel the need
<b>Floyd</b> | to impress him with long words and insincere feelings, I didn't have to
<b>Floyd</b> | be anything other than myself.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | But I know my parents weren't too fond of him. They were always trying
<b>Floyd</b> | to get me to play with some ghastly yacht-club children, and I don't
<b>Floyd</b> | think they liked some of the language I picked up from Daniel, either.
<b>Floyd</b> | Somehow I began to see him less and less. Then, when I was thirteen,
<b>Floyd</b> | disaster struck. I was packed off to St. Enda's, and Daniel went to
<b>Floyd</b> | some other secondary school. And after that, I didn't get to see him at

<b>Floyd</b> | all.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shortly after that, Daniel sent me a letter. It was a very funny
<b>Floyd</b> | letter, describing some events and people at his new school. It was
<b>Floyd</b> | like a flash of the old Daniel, the one who used to tell funny stories
<b>Floyd</b> | in a hay-barn. It cheered me up no end during the misery of St. Enda's,
<b>Floyd</b> | let me tell you. I knew I had to reply, and it had to be a really

<b>Floyd</b> | well-written and funny letter, too.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | God, I tried so often to write that letter. Practically every night I
<b>Floyd</b> | would stare at a page that was blank except for the words "Dear Daniel"
<b>Floyd</b> | at the top. I just couldn't think of anything to say. "Just be
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself," I kept thinking, "And write down whatever comes into your

<b>Floyd</b> | head." But nothing came into my head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few weeks passed, and I still hadn't written a reply. And then I
<b>Floyd</b> | couldn't think of any excuses for my lateness. The longer it went on,
<b>Floyd</b> | the more ashamed I became about the delay, and the harder it was to
<b>Floyd</b> | write. I must have read and re-read Daniel's letter fifty times,

<b>Floyd</b> | looking for inspiration. I still have that letter. I still haven't
<b>Floyd</b> | replied.

<b>Floyd</b> | street.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But if I ever do meet Daniel again, I hope I'll be standing on the
<b>Floyd</b> | platform of a railway station - a miserable, damp railway station,
<b>Floyd</b> | where all the seats are taken by stuck-up grannies and biddies and
<b>Floyd</b> | ghastly yacht-clubbers. And while waiting for the train, which is

<b>Floyd</b> | taking ages, I'll peer over to the opposite platform, and notice a
<b>Floyd</b> | familiar figure. Daniel! Barely able to conceal the joy in my voice,
<b>Floyd</b> | I'll step over to the edge of the platform and shout "Daniel Maguire!
<b>Floyd</b> | What the FUCK are you doing here?" And he'll notice me and shout "Alex
<b>Floyd</b> | Moran, would you ever shut the FUCK up, you cross-eyed WANKER!" And
<b>Floyd</b> | I'll reply "Go FUCK yourself, ASSHOLE!" and he'll reply "Suck me off,

<b>Floyd</b> | you BENT BASTARD!". And the two of us will run up and down the
<b>Floyd</b> | platforms, joyously shouting abuse at each other across three lines of
<b>Floyd</b> | track. And all the stuck-up grannies and biddies and ghastly
<b>Floyd</b> | yacht-clubbers waiting at the station will stare at us as if we are

<TR><td></td><TD><b>Floyd</b> asks, "That game over already?  It was just getting good.  Wanna play another?"
</TD><td></td><TD><b>yandexx</b>  says, "this can't be reality"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "Wow."

</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "So, that's the game."

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "Oh, huh"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "I know!  Let's play it again and see if we can get a different ending!"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>yandexx</b>  says, "Nice game, really."
</TD><td></td></TR>

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "Hey, that was kinda sweet"

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Taleslinger</b>  asks (of fang), "What, It happens quite often in my life. "I hate you! Do you want to marry me?"

</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>DavidW</b>  says, "That ending was suspiciously similar to how he remembered Daniel."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "I guess there's multiple interpretations of what just happened"

</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  asks, "Are there?"

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says, "I only see one."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "Well, I didn't like it, but I wasn't meant to.  It was a good game, just not enjoyable.  Great writing, and well executed, given its intent."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  asks (of Bert), "So what just happened?"
</TD><td></td></TR>

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>inky</b>  says (to Bert), "yeah, I think it's pretty obvious Daniel is your alternate personality playing out your internal fantasies, causing you to stand around in the street swearing at nothing"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Emily</b>  says, "I think the only way to understand it is that, having totally failed to connect with Claire in reality, he has made her the basis of a substitute fantasy for the discarded Daniel fantasy"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says, "We went to being exactly the same as we were at the start of the game."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>DavidW</b>  says (to Emily), "yes"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Taleslinger</b>  says (to emily), "I agree."

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Taleslinger</b>  says, "(based on this review I just read)"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "No, there's no ambiguity.  We now live in a magical fantasy land where moles no longer wigs us out."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>DavidW</b>  says, "It's possible the status line would've made the last scene more explicit. Not sure."
</TD><td></td></TR>

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "s/wigs/wig"

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "Darn.  Another joke ruined by typo."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says, "It was pretty damn explicit if you ask me."

</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "Well, I was thinking that the preceeding bit could be him imagining what would happen, and then what he really did"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>DavidW</b>  says, "if the status line says '(dreaming)', for example, then."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  asks, "At any rate, I'd be fine with stopping here and saving Punk Points for another week, since we're already at nearly 1.5 hours.  Thoughts?"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>yandexx</b>  says, "Agree."
</TD><td></td></TR>

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says (to W), "Then that would be ham-fisted an redundant."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  asks, "Will Punk Points make  us feel better?"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says (to Fang), "heh"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says, "It can't make you feel any worse, I don't think."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "then I'm pro-punk points"

</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Taleslinger</b>  says, "&gt;SCORE. You have 32 out of 55 punk points."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says (to DW), "Yeah, I think a status bar clarification would be redundant at best and, at worst, ruin the effect."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>DavidW</b>  says (to Jacqueline), "hm. You could be right."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says, "So, personally, I absolutely loathe this game."

</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "Well, anyways, that was technically proficient and artistically interesting"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says, "More than any other IF game I can think of."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says, "Which is a tribute to the author's skill."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "but deeply frustrating"
</TD><td></td></TR>

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says, "But I am not going to thank him for it."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "like a well made torture machine"

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "well, right"

</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says (to Jacq), "Which fits his analogy well."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "I think the author fully achieved what he set out to do"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "So, if you all would like to play Punk Points, you may start at will.  I need to step afk for a moment."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>DavidW</b>  says, "I didn't realize it'd take 1.5hrs to play Rameses."

<TR><td></td><TD><b>yandexx</b> says, "Let's go back to the Lounge."
</TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "mostly because we were fighting the game every step of the way"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  says (to Fang), "Vice versa."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b>  says, "indeed"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>inky</b>  says, "come to think of it, a better pairing for this one would have been A Mome of Hope"

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>inky</b>  says, "er, Moment"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>DavidW</b>  says, "I think the one and only place you can significantly stall the game is by never taking the folder from Paddy."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Bert</b>  asks (of inky), "So we wouldn't have the risk of inadvertant cheerfulness afterward?"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>yandexx</b>  says, "The PC would probably take the book himself."
</TD><td></td></TR>

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Emily</b>  says, "and finish up with On Optimism"
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>yandexx</b>  says, "Er, the folder."
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><b>Fang</b> disappears through an invisible gap in the MUD. You think you may have heard the sounds of chatting before the gap closed again.
